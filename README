Ahoy there!

This is a little project to build a web 1.5 posting board. The community is currently using an ancient bulletin-board system, several members have been extolling the virtues of a PHPbb setup with subforums and whatnot, and I opened my big fat mouth and said "Hey! This looks like a perfect use for the Model-View-Controller design pattern!"

I may come to regret this.

Design documents should all be OS-agnostic, in the /docs directory.

What to expect:
Ruby on Rails
One set of posts, many ways to look at it
Optional authentication, with options

What not to expect:
Magic
Fast development
Incredibly mind-blowing code

Developers:
Techno-Dann (AKA Captain Vim, Techno.Dann@gmail.com)
