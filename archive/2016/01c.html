            <p>Some time ago, I found a crossover that was quite ... interesting and of which I&#39;m not sure how to feel about, mostly because I don&#39;t know one of the continua involved. It&#39;s called <a href="https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5898893/1/Running-Away-From-Time">Running Away From Time</a> and it&#39;s a Dresden Files/Time Traveler&#39;s Wife X-over. <br><br>Now, as you know, I don&#39;t know the former, but I&#39;m quite a fan of the later. I don&#39;t know, something just feels off about this one, specially with the whole Alba DeTamble and Harry Dresden romance that&#39;s the focus of the story. Could you look it over to see how it checks out on your side of things?</p>

Butcher know how to use good purple prose.)<br><br>-Dresden could like eye candies when he sees them, but he learned to keep his libido in check.

Suicidal stupidity.<br><br>-Idem with moving his office to his appartment. Professional activities destroy a threshold. Threshold is the most magic protection ever. There is ducking reason he was renting an office!<br><br>-A lift? <i>He&#39;s living in a basement!</i><br><br>-Sweetheart, Time meddling is forbidden by the Sixth Law  of Magic, and all offenses about them mean death, and destruction of the culprit&#39;s mind because of black magic. Forget. It.<br><br>-Talking about <i>Bob</i> like this? I don&#39;t even... He would not even mention it like this.

            <p>Guess who&#39;s been revisiting that franchise again for the first time in years? I loved the first <i>Plants vs. Zombies</i> as a wee PC gamer, and I can say with confidence that this new game has done everything that made the first game so great, and a whole lot more. So, is there anyone else around here who has PVZ2 on their phones or wherever? What are your favorite plants and/or eras? What were the most challenging levels you&#39;ve played so far? What do you wish PopCap could&#39;ve added? I personally hope they bring back the &quot;Zombies On Your Lawn&quot; music video once they release the second half of Modern Day (haven&#39;t gotten to that point yet, though), and the trailer material does make it look like they will.<br><br><s>also the dark ages is gonna be the end of me istg</s></p>

            <p>Fist of all, because EA bought PVZ, nobody from the original team made this. I like the design and all, but I honestly prefer the older game. The music in the first few eras are remixes of the original music, and you eventually get annoyed aby the third time you hear &quot;Cowboy Brainiac Maniac&quot;. It just takes away from the amazingness of the original. Other than that, the game&#39;s quite nice.</p>

            <p>Since hS and Scape shared their knowledge on the African school, I feel like I should tell what I know about Japanese culture that is relevant to Mahoutokoro.<br><br>FIrst of all, the name - Mahōtokoro - is a compound, consisting of two words: <i>mahō</i> meaning &#39;magic&#39;, and <i>tokoro</i> meaning &#39;place&#39;, &#39;location&#39;, &#39;spot&#39;... but we know this already from the HP wiki. How about something we&#39;ve just learned.<br><br>The location - Minami-Iwo-Jima, or Southern Sulfur Island, is located about 1300 kilometers (or, 807 miles) south of Tokyo. <a href="http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/5f/4e/1d/such-a-cool-island-just.jpg">This is how it looks like.</a><br><br>The school itself is mentioned to be a palace, therefore it most likely looks like the traditional Japanese <i>shiro</i> castle - <a href="http://japan-culture.biz/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Himeji-castle.jpg">[CLICK]</a> - and the &#39;mutton-fat jade&#39; it&#39;s made of is simply another name for very light yellow nephrite. Very... Chinese, if I can say so myself; if I recall correctly, the Japanese didn&#39;t use as much nephrite. <br><br>The reason that the students start school at seven, and then can choose to board it when eleven, is because in Japanese culture the odd number (3, 5, 7, 11, etc.) are considered lucky. There even is a festival which celebrates children of those ages, called the Shichi-Go-San (lit. &quot;Seven-Five-Three&quot;).<br><br>The most surprising for me was the colours. It&#39;s logical for the robes to start as cherry blossom pink, since the sakura tree is an important symbol and the moment of blossoming is a nation-wide festival. I can see gold being the top colour, since it does symbolize strength... white is what caught me off-guard since the symbolism of the colour is generally positive. But then I dug a little deeper and found out that besides &#39;life&#39; the colour white represents &#39;anger&#39; and &#39;danger&#39;, which is quite appropriate for those who took the Mahoutokoro equivalent of the Dark Side. </p>

            <p>If it is Cajun that would place it in Louisiana, now if it were Creole, that could place it in a few places but most likely in Louisiana or Haiti (or somewhere else in the Caribbean).  But going on the map it looks like you can see Nova Scotia and it clearly looks like the Mississippi River is visible.<br><br>So if we take it as Nova Scotia and the Mississippi River as being on the map, it also appears that the westernmost edge of Lake Superior is visible.  So if we take all that I would say that it appears to be located in one of two possible places.  First at the conflux of Lake Superior, Lake Huron, and Lake Michigan.  That would place it somewhere around Sault Ste. Marie and the Michigan/Ontario Border.  Alternatively it also looks like it could be located on or near Niagara Falls at the New York/Ontario Border.  It would be easier to tell without the smoke around the Castle.  Based on the actual Castle&#39;s structures and the landmarks that appear to be clear to me (Nova Scotia and the Mississippi River), it appears to be located on or about Niagara Falls.</p>

Additionally, Burkina Faso (actually the modern name of the country) has cropped up in the Potterverse before; the Runespoor, a three-headed snake featured in <i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</i>, is native to the region, and mention is made of a Burkinabй Ministry of Magic with the power to make entire forests Unplottable.<br><br>Now, most of the country is rolling grasslands, but the southeast - particularly in the Cascades Region that borders the modern state of Mali - is an enormous sandstone bluff that is home to the nation&#39;s largest peak. This peak stands at 749 metres. However, given what we know about the Burkina Faso Ministry of Magic&#39;s penchant for making things Unplottable, that puts the Uagadou school squarely there.<br><br>Quite far away from the current city of Ouagadougou.<br><br>And also from the old kingdom of Wogodogo that formed the core of the early Mossi empire.<br><br>...<br><br>Ah.</p>

            <p>(... by way of <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/j-k-rowling-shows-off-the-international-wizarding-worl-1756228214">this</a>), Uagadou is apparently in Uganda. AKA nowhere near the place it&#39;s named after.<br><br>... and if I type in &#39;Mountains of the m&#39;, Google autocompletes with &#39;-oon uganda&#39;. Potterdom, ladies and Eldar.<br><br>Ahem. It also, bizarrely, places it quite a long way south of the traditional Mountains of the Moon - Wikipedia shows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda#/media/File:Uganda_(orthographic_projection).svg">Uganda to be equatorial</a>, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountains_of_the_Moon_(Africa)#/media/File:1805_cary.jpg">the mountains to be halfway to the Tropic of Cancer</a>. On the other hand, the <i>article</i> says that the mountains were identified early on as the southern source of the Nile, which would place them south of Lake Victoria, which is itself south of Uganda.<br><br>All of which means Uagadou is apparently <i>very</i> good at making things Unplottable. Guess they must have trained Burkina Faso&#39;s lot...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So according to this map, north of the school is dominated by the Hudson Bay.  Nova Scotia is clearly to the east.  The Mississippi River is the large river to the south west.  The Appalachians are to the south.  This also makes it clear that it is east of the Great Lakes, so according to this map, I think this places it on or about Niagara Falls at the New York/Ontario Border.  </p>

            <p>Androia and Hieronymus will not be there. They probably fell back into the plothole or time vortex or wherever they had come from, where they may have a chat about why he didn’t show more of an emotional reaction to her death. (He is used to seeing her die in-game; it’s not a big deal. Just spend some money on repairing the damage and she’s fine again. But telling her that he is the guy who literally pulled her strings might be a very bad idea.)<br><br>If this had been in continuity, it would happen between <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VAsq9cuSxP2WemJFSPPnupNvFLWndJS2FYEF8GEGT70/edit?pref=2&amp;pli=1&amp;disco=AAAAAnyW_vg#gid=959148118">”First Encounter”</a> and their first mission, and I’m surprised how good it fits in there. It’s probably how Neshomeh said: an exercise in making the random events look in-character. I should try this talent-I-didn’t-know-I-possess at some of the random permission prompts, if there weren’t so much else to do.<br><br>Androia sends her apologies to Nikki.

            <p><b>Henry</b>: Well, second place isn&#39;t that bad, specially since apparently I got the same number of kills as the winner did, so that&#39;s good. Going temporally insane twice and ending up killing people I really didn&#39;t want to kill aside, this was a really fun experience. It sure was much more fun than fighting any Sues. Like I said before, agents are much smarter and more strategic, so this was more of a challenge. <br><br>Seems that there&#39;s going to be a party after this.

Ended up in a swordfight with him. I have to say, guy fought rather well, but I ended up defeating and eliminating him.

While a game, I fear I may have done something in poor taste while in the grip of my madness. Perhaps involving a rabbit, if I remember right. Hm. Ah! I have it. I know just what to send. If you&#39;ll forgive me, I must away!</p>

            <p>Sergio: Well... I guess I really should&#39;ve kept going with the same strategy that kept me in the game until now. Joined Dafydd and Morgan into staging an ambush - and it didn&#39;t work out that well. I ran out of ammo for my gun before we managed to get even one of them ,and had to resort to Nikki&#39;s Device - apparently, the holodeck&#39;s rendition of it is usable in Saber form by anyone - but Henry is much better experienced as a fencer than I am.

            <p>Library: I spent the last couple nights in preparation, and it paid off fairly well. When I returned to the cornucopia I ended up in a fight with the Time Lady Morgan, and Gerry, and ended up killing Gerry. I hope she won&#39;t hold that against me after this is finished. Afterwards, I temporarily joined up with Algie&#39;s partner Lola, and we managed to kill the Aviator. There can&#39;t very many of us left. I wonder how soon this will end? <br><br>Gerry: Okay, okay, maybe I should have laid off on the sodding ghost stories and got some proper rest instead; Denny&#39;s girlfriend ended up taking me out when Morgan and I got into a fight with her.

No, I don&#39;t blame Kaitlyn for distracting me. Kaitlyn is nice. Dafydd hadn&#39;t had anything to share but warmth, having been dispossessed the previous night.

            <p><b>Field Commander Lola McCandless:</b> The other night, Morgan mentioned to me that there were ways her people could track each other, kinda like a psychic trail. Time Lords are seriously damn dangerous, though, I know from experience, so I started monitoring them closely. Plus side, though, I&#39;ve keeping fit and fed, and I met up with Library again! She&#39;s still nice, and she&#39;s actually a pretty decent tracker. Would&#39;ve had her sent to Scout training back in the Mountain, no question. And... we got her. Yeah, she was wounded, yeah, it was two on one, but in the early days of the Long War that was how you killed Sectoids and Thin Men without getting a face full of plasma. Partial kill on a Time Lord. I&#39;m... going to go and think for a bit.<br><br><b>Algernon, 7th Earl Wymbourne:</b> Yes. Yes! The stars, as certain treatises on the darkest magics of the multiverse say, are indubitably coming right, haha! While I contemplated my inevitable victory over the ragbag of tawdry, gullible beings who have succumbed to archaic notions of sanity, the magic caught! All the truly great magicians have been at least slightly mad, and since I am completely mad that appears to have put me at some considerable advantage! I tested a simple spell to compel a river spirit to fish for me... and lo, this was achieved! Ha! My magic is undeniable now! They shall bow! Bow before me! As is only right!</p>

            <p><b>Dafydd</b><br><br>I ran into Selene last night. It&#39;s been... a while since we last saw each other. She&#39;s... well, honestly she&#39;s looking a little scary right now, I don&#39;t think the game-makers thought about vampires when they set this up. Maybe that&#39;s why she insisted on going to the Feast...? Bad idea, I heard four cannon shots from that. I have a much better resource-acquisition strategy: steal from people.<br><br><b>Kaitlyn</b><br><br>My friends keep dying. :( I met this old guy who&#39;d holed up in a cave, and he let me camp with him, <i>but</i> he went to the Feast and got killed. I didn&#39;t go - too dangerous for me! - and as it turned out, I didn&#39;t need to. I found a crate full of food tucked away in a corner of the cave - I wonder why Hieronymus didn&#39;t spot it?<br><br><b>Selene</b><br><br>So hungry. All the time I was with Dafydd last night I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about his blood. Then at the Cornucopia I took down that grey-beard - but no, I couldn&#39;t drink from him, the DIA would go <i>nuts</i>.<br><br>So I lost. Don&#39;t care. I&#39;m going to get something to eat. Get out of my way, or it might be you.<br><br><b>Morgan</b><br><br>I have a plan. Well... I <i>had</i> a plan. Make slightly-friends with people, so that they hunt each other before they do me. Great. Except the flip-side of that plan is that all my slightly-friends keep <b>killing each other</b>. Library took out Gerry today, and tried to come after me, too. Should I still count her on the list? If not, I&#39;m down to... Lola. That&#39;s it.<br><br>And to make matters worse, someone&#39;s hunting me. I don&#39;t know who.<br><br>And I have a headache.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>So nearly <i>half</i> of the final 8 are mine. Are you <i>sure</i> the RNG isn&#39;t biased?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Sergio: Night was terrible. Nightmares again. Didn&#39;t went to the Cornucopia yet again, that place is dangerous. Rayson seems to have been eliminated as well - he fell into a pit or something.<br>Someone stole most of my gear when I was off looking for food - I know only have my Beretta and the Holodeck&#39;s replica of Nikki&#39;s Device, and that&#39;s because I never leave them around.<br>It happened again - I&#39;m the last survivor of my group, with no supplies and several targets to take down.

I was taking a brief constitutional, and my, what healthful airs this place has! It reminds me of Eastbourne but with more butcher&#39;s knives. But yes, I must continue. I walked about and saw a rabbit, a shortish little rabbit, a slip of a thing that bounded about with a peculiar light. Box cutters have the flimsiest blades and it broke off in her shooting hand, but there are several and that vorpal blade went snicker-snack! And the way that the rabbit&#39;s blood ran deep crimson across my shoes amused me such that I laughed and laughed and laughed, and when I stopped, my new friend had gone to Fairyland, I suppose. I hope we can see each other again.</p>

It worked fine, and I decamped to higher ground once I was well-rested in my previous hiding place. At least it didn&#39;t flood this time. We&#39;ll see how the remaining contestants get on, but I&#39;m doing okay for myself so far. Luck beats skill, but skill means you make your own luck.

I <i>must</i>. This damnable Holodeck&#39;s spirit <i>will</i> accede to my requests; I need only to find the proper phrasing. My meat remains, though it dwindles, and while I was hunting I espied another contestant. And I chased him. I howled my challenge like a shaman of the far Americas, loosing a cobbled-together tomahawk at his head as I ran after him, blood pumping in my ears, anger at him surging through my veins. This was <i>my</i> hunt! This was <i>my</i> prize! How dare I be denied by any man? I, who am by right of blood the lord of an English estate, wherever that England may now be? I would have chased him to his end if I could... but I could not. And as soon as I sat down, realizing I had wasted another day, that selfsame anger left me. Forgive me, O lord.

My healing magic doesn&#39;t properly in this place, so it was fortunate that he was around to show me some Muggle first-aid techniques. Probably should try to learn more of those for whenever someone gets hurt on a mission where I can&#39;t use magic either. <br><br>I think I have actually heard of this guy before. He and his partners seem to have been pretty legendary when they worked in Floaters. <br><br>Apparently his girlfriend was one of the agents that got caught up in the explosion back at the Cornucopia in Day One of this madnesd.

            <p>Night was better than the last. A third agent-- Kaitlyn-- acted as a buffer between Luxury and me. And here I was, thinking I was rid of her. Well, she might be of some use  to me in the coming days. We discussed tactics throughout the night. Of course, there were some difficulties involved since I&#39;m mute. The amount of paper I have left in my logbook is limited and I have no desire to waste it with idle chatter. <br><br>Morning. Detonation in distance. Cautiously investigated. Saw Dives crawling away from the explosion on the far side of the clearing-- if I was closer, I would&#39;ve finished her off. Zeb, a catman, and Luxury have been vaporized in an apparent trap. What luck!  Three down in one fell swoop. <br><br>Chased by Corolla later in the afternoon. Gave her the slip, no sweat. Seriously-- how many times do these Action agents have to try before realizing that you simply can&#39;t chase down a Spy?<br></p>

            <p>In fact, Corolla seeking out Zeb for a partnership would be very in-character for her (not to mention they do know each other, and even did one mission together), as is Sergio&#39;s tactic of focusing on resources and avoiding conflicts when possible (since he&#39;s an ordinary human with an ammunition-based weapon, he would only attack when 100% sure of a victory. Also, other players less skilled in survival would become weaker as the days go on)<br><br>Even Rayson, who is little more than a planned character (a mention in a still unreleased interlude and a few KSP gameplay videos are all that&#39;s set in stone for him) is acting quite like I would expect him to.</p>

            <p><b>Dafydd</b><br><br>Stealth: apparently a pretty common tactic. Last night I kept an eye out for fires, but only saw one. I kept my distance; I actually ran into Agent Derik doing the exact same thing, but I don&#39;t think he saw me. Everyone&#39;s a spy today.<br><br>As was whoever rifled my belongings while I was out on patrol. They moved as quietly as an elf, which makes them... no-one in the Arena? Maybe the producers decided to get funny. I&#39;m just glad I didn&#39;t have much worth taking.<br><br><b>Kaitlyn</b><br><br>I made new friends... sort of. I ran into Agent Luxury, who was following some kind of fuzzy dog around - I think it was a Pokemon, but I&#39;m not sure. Its name was Tacitus, though, and it was <i>very</i> eager for help in keeping Lux talking - and not, y&#39;know, doing anything else - allll night long.<br><br>Yeah, they weren&#39;t really company to keep around, is what I&#39;m saying. So I headed out by myself in the morning, and tested my skills by sneaking into that elf&#39;s camp. Apparently I <i>am</i> as quiet as a hobbit - good going, me!<br><br>I miss Alleb and the Doktor. :(<br><br><b>Selene</b><br><br>Cold; apparently lightning isn&#39;t good for lighting firewood <i>still</i> drenched in Single Tears. Don&#39;t work well by myself. Ran into the Time Lady who killed Wobbles around noon; I <i>know</i> how dangerous she is, so I settled for rifling her things.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;ll find Kaitlyn tonight. That would be nice.<br><br><b>Morgan</b><br><br>Whoever stole my stuff is going to pay.<br><br>I didn&#39;t get a lot of sleep last night - Gerry from Building Maintenance (met her during the Blackout, I think - good-bad times) needed help, so I added her to my list of &#39;slightly allies&#39;. That turned out <i>not</i> to be a good idea - she ran off after a spaceman in the morning, and while I tried to get a bit of rest, <i>someone</i> made off with my food supplies.<br><br>So now I&#39;m tired <i>and</i> hungry.<br><br>I need a drink.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Man, this lot are a bunch of downers. Don&#39;t they realise that they now make up nearly a quarter of the surviving Tributes?<br><br>They&#39;ll liven up a bit when they do things other than fail to start fires. ;) Also, Kaitlyn apparently enjoys the company of Pokemon - who knew?<br><br>(They probably remind her of hobbits...)<br><br>hS</p>

Not quite my day today.<br><br>Sergio: Corolla seems to be having fun, which is good. During the day I met a guy called Henry, a Potterverse wizard. He&#39;s an healer, but the Holodeck seems to have nerfed his healing. I gave him some non-magical first-aid tips I learned in the field - nothing flashy, I&#39;m not a medic, but those are rare on the battlefield.<br>His partner got taken out too - and, in fact, she&#39;s an anime girl like Nikki. In a way, they remind me of us. Only that we didn&#39;t get a Bleepfic as a first asignment. Thinking about sticking with him for now, and having a talk with the stupid daisy before going home.<br><br>Rayson: Why is that girl chasing me? I haven&#39;t done anything to her! I don&#39;t want to die!</p>

            <p><b>Tacitus</b><br><br>I like my fur. It&#39;s a beautiful shade of dark grey and is as soft as a delicate silk cloth. <br><br>That is why when one of the PPC&#39;s most well-known taxidermists comes up to you and asks to use you as a pillow, you don&#39;t question it. You lie down and pretend that you&#39;re a pillow. And, when the sun comes back up and she has her back turned, you grab some of her supplies, try to claw out her Achilles tendon (a pity I missed),  and run for your life.<br><br>Later on I was recruited by Agent Morgan and assisted her on a hunt. We stumbled on Wobbles attacking Library-- I let Morgan do the wetwork. No point in risking my &#39;life&#39; for nothing. <br><br>My chances of winning? Slim, at best. There are too many high-powered agents left on the field. Firstly, the two Time Ladies: Morgan and Dives. Time Lords are inherently physically superior to all present-- I need to convince the other players to gang up on them. McCandless and Pittman are also major threats: their experiences as X-COM operatives makes them nearly as dangerous as the Gallifreyans. Wymbourne is a magic user. I have little to no information on how he weaponizes it-- if at all-- so I need to stay vigilant. And Zeb... suffice to say that if he can maul a Pokйmon DIA agent in a one-on-one battle, he can easily win against a normal human. <br><br>Hopefully they&#39;ll start cutting each other down before they&#39;ll turn on me. I don&#39;t stand a chance in a head-on confrontation. I need poisons, I need explosives, I need ambushes... and everyone is keeping a close eye on the other. It&#39;s impossible to slip away undetected... or is it?<br></p>

I found some sais — might have been from one of the agents that drowned in the tear flood — then I found that DMS agent, and… well, I got stabby. That didn&#39;t improve things<br><br>I was just so out of it that I didn&#39;t even notice what was up with the supply crate. I could feel some sort of electrical system attached to the inside of it, but I just brushed it off. KABOOM! I&#39;m out of the game.<br><br>Ugh. I&#39;m going to Rudi&#39;s.

I went for that nice Library person who was like super nice but I couldn&#39;t remember where she worked for so we tussled for a while but then, well, then one of the Time Grump&#39;s friends came over and I tried to explain but she ended up garrotting me with my own tightrope wire. Oh well. I hope she got the supplies I&#39;d stored, and, um... Morgan? If you&#39;re listening? I made some balloon flowers for Kaitlyn after what we talked about, so, uh, if you could... if you could make sure she gets them I&#39;d really appreciate it.<br><br><b>Field Commander Lola McCandless:</b> Today&#39;s been quiet. Scouting operations went well, and with a lot of people being killed during the night it might pay well to monitor any alliances. So I spent time last night telling war stories from my time on the COM with Derik, who used to be -- get this -- the Phantom of the friggin&#39; Opera, and Sergio, who I believe still is Italian. Reminds me of an Assault from back in the Mountain, actually. Might look him up later. Anyway, come the morning, I noticed Henry and HG over by what remained of the lake. I&#39;ve still got the bombs, but there wasn&#39;t really an opportune moment and my throwing arm&#39;s still not brilliant from where that Stone Knight of Angarling broke it last month so I left them to it.<br><br><b>Algernon, 7th Earl Wymbourne:</b> My attempts to cajole the Holodeck into compliance with my wishes have so far met with total disdain. However, there is a sense of camaraderie that I am finding most conducive to a calm environment, even when we are flooded out with Suvian poisons; for instance, just last night I was sharing stories with a genuine astronaut, one mister Rayson Kerman of the <i>Kerbal Space Program</i> universe. The advances of science and technology are things that interest me immensely, and I only hope my own tales of life at Perenelle as a moderately-skilled practical magician were to his liking.<br><br>---<br><br>Footnotes: and so we continue the streak of mine and hS&#39;s agents wanting to kill each other. =]</p>

            <p><b>Dafydd</b><br><br>Last night I met a girl who was fire. She&#39;s dead now, which wasn&#39;t my fault. Well... mostly not.<br><br>After the flood, I decided stealth wasn&#39;t really much of an option any more. I put together a team of the useful skilled survivors I could track down - Supernumerary (well, I know he&#39;s dangerous), a fairy-sized woman, an intimidating man with a gun, and the aforementioned girl who was fire.<br><br>We slept in shifts - two up, three down, to stop one of us going rogue. I... <i>may</i> have manipulated the schedules to let me <s>stare at</s> talk to the fire. I mean girl. Whatever.<br><br>But... well, things didn&#39;t go well for her this morning. Turns out the intimidating man? He wasn&#39;t really into the whole &#39;team&#39; thing. He threw a knife into her chest, and bang, down she went. Given that Supernumerary had run off after that Time Lady, the fairy technician and I split up.<br><br>I did manage to fend off a cat-person of some description by myself, which was a plus (teeth and claws - yikes), but I think I might go back to stealth mode again...<br><br><b>Kaitlyn</b><br><br>Camp last night was lonely. Turns out, Alleb and the Doktor? The flood got both of them. <i>Rubbish</i>, right? So I was all by myself. Good thing I kept hold of my firelighter... oh! Then today I ran into a guy who looked just like the Phantom of the Opera. I had to fight him - that&#39;s what the game&#39;s <i>about</i>, right? - but I couldn&#39;t bring myself to kill him.<br><br>Still no more mushrooms. Consoling myself by humming <i>The Music of the Night</i>.<br><br><b>Selene</b><br><br>Not a good day. Tried to set up camp with Wobbles, but she insisted on going hunting. She attacked a harmless-looking agent (as in, &#39;easy target&#39;), but then this Time Lady came out of nowhere and killed her.<br><br>I cried.<br><br>Then as if the Arena wanted to rub it in, Jesse - my <i>other</i> teammate... look, I don&#39;t want to talk about it. I had to kill him; that&#39;s all.<br><br>Alone now.<br><br><b>Morgan</b><br><br>Today was a good day. Last night I ran into a weird quirk of the Arena - killer clowns. I thought the game-makers were only going to use natural monsters? Ah, well. Rescued Agent Library from it, so that was me safe for the night.<br><br>Then after daybreak I teamed up with Tacitus - a Spy. We hunted together, but everyone&#39;s gotten fairly canny about staying out of sight. Still, it means one more person who vaguely trusts me.<br><br>Still not sure whether I should seek out the Aviator. She&#39;s a Council member now - but would I trust any of the <i>rest</i> of them to be allies in here? Mm, no, don&#39;t think so. Still, it&#39;s worth considering.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>W...where are the massively-long transcripts? :O That&#39;s a terrifyingly fast change. And still no inter-team encounters for District Huinesoron... I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll come.<br><br>Along with the deaths.<br><br>27 down... 21 to go.<br><br>(And Selene&#39;s getting miserable. :-/)<br><br>hS</p>

We split up, and I went to practice with this bow I found, when <i>whoosh!</i> everything&#39;s flooded. This big wave came down a hill behind me, and I started to run away, but...

I opened up an umbrella I&#39;d found, and then I was struck by lightning! What are the chances of that? I am rather sad that I did not survive longer, but at the same time it is good to be out of that game. It isn&#39;t a very pleasant sport.<br><br>-Alleb</p>

Had she gone with me, up the hill, where I found my cave ... Nah, it’s probably better so. She would have continued talking my ear off, and I wouldn’t have found any sleep. So I was really lucky there. When I woke up, everything was wet outside. The flood must have gone right up to the threshold. Had I seen it, I would probably have tried to taste the liquid. Now I’m really thirsty. I must find some water soon.<br><br><b>Androia</b><br><br>This had begun so well. I even found a companion, one Field Commander Lola McCandless of the Special Response Division. She reminds me of my partner, so very rational and focused. And then it all went down.<br><br>Lesson number two learned: Time Lords lie. <i>I</i> had to scare <i>her</i> off <i>our</i> camp. Alas, I may have been a bit too convincing there. Apparently Lola ran away, too.<br><br>Lesson number three learned: Those ‘Sue-things must be even more dangerous than I thought; even their tears are poison.<br><br>Am I allowed to curse here? No? Okay then. Lesson number four learned: Do not trust the spies? Do not trust foxes? I will withhold my judgement until I get more experience.<br></p>

            <p>The Doktor was slowly but surely recovering from his time in the Holodeck. While it had been unpleasant, it hadn&#39;t exactly been as terrible as he&#39;d expected; his weakness to Electric-type moves and atrocious Special Defence had meant that the initial Thunderbolt had knocked him out in short order. He gave one last interview to the pink-haired human and the not-pink-haired human, left a message on the nearest Notice Board that anyone he&#39;d met in the simulation was welcome in RC 347, and journeyed home.<br><br>He was not, however, expecting the comprehensive glomp that formed his arrival.<br><br>&quot;Mother of Mew, Doc, are you okay? I saw you get hit by that Thunderbolt from the umbrella and I was so <i>worried</i> and I knew it was a simulation but-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ach, meine kleine Gabrielle, I am beink most hale und hearty! Zer end vas qwick und zer pain momentary at best.

I was so scared of losing you.&quot;<br><br>The Doktor stroked the fur of her ruff with a fin. &quot;You needn&#39;t vorry, mein Freundin. Friends forever, remember? Ein leetle teensy-veensy think like zer barriers between life und death are posink no problems vhatsoever to zer power of friendship!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was just spooked, I guess.&quot; Gabrielle let go and hung her head. &quot;I just... you&#39;ve been so nice to me, getting me things, making sure everything is okay for me, even when you&#39;re in a holo-arena full of people who wanna kill you you&#39;re looking out for me, and I just... I wanna be worth it. And, and I&#39;m sorry, I haven&#39;t had time to do any banners or Poffins or Pokйblocks or Butterbeer or, or anything like that, and I wanna be worth the effort you put into me but I just screw up -- ow!&quot;<br><br>The Doktor flopped over and pulled the qwill out of her side with his teeth. &quot;Vhat have ve said about puttink yourself down?

            <p><b>Laura</b><br><br>Seventeen deaths in one day? F***ing hell! At that rate, there&#39;s not going to be anyone left to fight! I don&#39;t think whoever designed that special event with the Single Tears did any proper testing. They gotta nerf that for next year. I also had to abandon that cave I found to avoid drowning. On the plus side, though, I found some food before the Sue-ish flood waters rolled in. Down one shelter, up some sustenance.<br><br><b>James</b><br><br>It was good a thing I&#39;ve been scouting out the arena. I knew the perfect place to take shelter once that Single Tear flood began. You know, discountin&#39; all the agents trying to hunt me down, the lethal weather, and the fact that the scenery is made in a computer, it&#39;s actually pretty nice out here. Reminds me of when I when I was in the Boy Scouts. Once this is over, I think I&#39;ll try to organize a non-mission camping trip somewhere. <br><br><b>Gremlin</b><br><br>Once again, my life is a <i>ta ma de</i> roller coaster. Sure, I didn&#39;t manage to swipe any supplies from that Time Lady whose nose I broke, but Wobbles was nice enough to share some stuff with me. We ended up scouting around together for most of the day. Well, I was scouting; she was doing stunts and impressions. I thought the constant high-energy thing was a performance she put on as part of her Nursery program. Nope. She&#39;s like that in real life too.<br><br>We got separated by the flood, which is when I found the Tiger Lily. She had been poisoned by the Single Tears, that was clear enough. Her petals were turning brown and she kept muttering to herself, talking to people and Flowers who weren&#39;t there. <br><br>Just leaving her there to suffer felt wrong. So… I did the only thing I could.<br><br>And, as a nice little shit cherry on top of my sundae, I just found out that Gall didn&#39;t make it. F***. We had made a deal before this whole thing started. If our partners died before we did, the two of us would team up to clear the board before squaring off in one final showdown. Loser would have paid for the first three rounds at Rudi&#39;s. It was gonna be awesome!<br><br>Yeah… awesome.<br><br>I am rapidly running out of friends.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;ll go harass that Time Lady again. Seeing her panic and flail about again might cheer me up.<br><br>* * * * *
<br>((I feel like Nesh and I jinxed the Gall/Gremlin team-up by talking about it. Ah, what could have been… Also, I might write the Gremlin/Tiger Lily encounter out in a little short story later. I feel that could be interesting, if a little grim.))</p>

            <p><b>Marina</b><br><br>The vampire didn&#39;t try anything so I found myself with only me and nightmares about the night the Fomors ruined my life. Soo much fun. Then this Luxray was coming around for me, so I ran away. Lightning are really bad for health. Then there is this strange flood from &#39;Single Tears&#39; and I manage to steal his canteen while his back is turned...Now I know these tears are, at least. Must be that way Skavis&#39; victims feel. Losing now is a bit disappointing, but at least, I found a perfect ingredient for potions. Seeing Sue killing themselves because of their cheap despair seems a pretty interesting idea, and someone just signed in for being a test subject...<br><br><b>Richard</b><br><br>All  was going so well. I had a rather remote position where I could wait for the worst of the killing to pass, and where to carry the loot from the crates — Staff played too much <i>Worms</i> in my opinion when <i>this</i> happened. Single Tears everywhere, lightning, mass murder... By the time I collected myself I had dropped from this ducking cliff. Losing like this feels really bad, and Marina is out too, talking about using Single Tears as a basis for potion. And the way she&#39;s looking at Zeb gives me chills...<br><br>(OOC: Must admit I&#39;m a bit disappointed from being out so soon, but heh, that&#39;s the game.)</p>

            <p>But where is this twenty percent level coming from? I mean, getting a higher-than-average level after her first regeneration was pretty normal, but now?

            <p>Like you say, glitter don&#39;t disappear overnight, but none of these points are something that was bought up overnight, for the sake of speshulness. <br><br>&gt;Ordinary teenage (fan)girl? How many World One agents fit this bill at the beginning?<br><br>&gt;Sure she&#39;s famous. After getting thrown in a cubic duckton of missions who got after her again and again, and broke her. Fame in this madhouse is always earned, for an unfair prize.<br><br>&gt;See above point. Besides, sending only two agents, one of them a newbie, against a Legendary? Reality ensued. And she wasn&#39;t exactly thrilled with the change, she didn&#39;t adapt overnight, etc. (Pretty sure the reason she snapped on this Sue before LMM was because the little ducktard got everything so easy.)<br><br>&gt;Sending already broken agent against another Legendary, after she thought her partner died because of her a second time, and three suicide attempts? Like Huinesoron said, Flowers are lucky she didn&#39;t go for a flamethrower. And you said she laid low during this part o her life. Pretty sure she would have been spotted through the canon-breaking otherwise.<br><br>&gt;Time-loop seemed to end up with an almost certain death, in the same way the Doctor saw Trenzalore as his tomb. Pretty sure angst was justified.<br><br>&gt;She had a good professor, previous experience with firearms, etc. Besides, saying the truth would have let her unable to fit the loop, or worst.<br><br>&gt;Yep, and it&#39;s painfully obvious how much it hurts. Being a survivor in these conditions is emotional hell, only made worse once she knew her Gallifrey is destroyed. No future left here.<br><br>&gt;People who were to be blamed for this were, not really anything to add. Wasn&#39;t your idea, and must admit except the Guardsman, Naya, Tera, Lola, and Algie, recent DIA had this neo-Black Cats feel... (Must admit the electric shock thing of the first version felt barbaric.)<br><br>Guess I&#39;m overreacting since I&#39;m the only one to talk about this, but I needed to get this out of the system.

            <p><b>Dafydd</b><br><br>Stealth is... not working out so well. Turns out that some of the handy camoflaguing plants? Toxic. I&#39;m a <i>Noldo</i>, I&#39;m not supposed to get <i>infected</i>. Ugh. Good thing I remembered a decent healing song.<br><br>That still didn&#39;t mean I wanted to tangle with a mace-wielding Supernumerary. I had to run (well, stumble) for higher ground - which turned out to be a good thing, since I got to sit out the flood from the comfort of a treetop. I don&#39;t think the others were as lucky...<br><br><b>Kaitlyn</b><br><br>Some meanie stole my mushrooms. I found some in a cave this morning, and was going to fry them up for dinner, but someone made off with them! I kind of hope whoever it was died in the flooding - is that wrong of me? I&#39;d ask Alleb what she thinks, but I saw her get struck by lightning during the flood.<br><br>Wait... lightning? I hope that wasn&#39;t Selene at work...<br><br><b>Selene</b><br><br>You know what would be nice? <i>Not</i> getting lost in the night. I&#39;m a vampire, I should be able to navigate easily!<br><br>Since the presenters said before we started that our powers would be &#39;reduced&#39;, and since Wobbles wandered off during the day, I spent today testing my <i>other</i> abilities. Transformation is gone, but I still have my strength: I took out a DoSAT tech pretty easily. (Which gave me flashbacks to the DIA harassing me about Makes-Things, but I digress). And the flooding let me test out my persuasiveness - whoever that girl was, she accepted the water without question.<br><br>I wonder if I can find Wobbles again? It was good to have someone to listen to and keep my mind off things.<br><br>Not hungry yet.<br><br><b>Morgan</b><br><br>At least my nose is better. But I haven&#39;t <i>slept</i>. The girl with no hair has it out for me, I&#39;m sure - she showed up with (of all people) Dr. Fitzgerald in tow to attack my camp, and I was up half the night fending them off with a stick. Then when I tried to sleep through the morning, some sort of Dark Elf lunatic dual-wielding a sickle and a staff decided to attack me. Do I have a target painted on my collar or something?<br><br>Focus, Morgan, focus. But it&#39;s so hard when there&#39;s all this <i>stuff</i> going on. I had to kill one agent just to shut her up, during the flood.<br><br>Ugh. I need a drink.<br><br><b>Captain Dandy</b><br><br><i>Now, that just wasn&#39;t fair. I did everything right - assembling a team from the Sub Rosa&#39;s spies to work together at night, encouraging Tacitus to go after the Tiger Lily (I know she&#39;s watching me), gathering limbs to keep my allies warm. And then what happens? A flood of Single Tears. I, of course, stay out of their reach, but the umbrella would have been useful to my allies.<br><br>Except for the lightning. That was not so useful.</i><br><br><b>The Tiger Lily</b><br><br><i>Final field report: Agent Supernumerary displayed agressive tendencies towards multiple agents. Agent Gall appears not to be an issue. Agent Tacitus clearly singled out myself for attack. Agent Gremlin a confirmed Flower-killer. I do not approve of the underhanded tactics used by the game designers; they should be monitored. I am leaving now.</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br>Footnotes: Scapegrace &amp; Alleb, it looks like the Doktor joined Alleb and Kaitlyn for the night - or Alleb left Kaitlyn to go hug a fish. Either works, I&#39;ve not specified.<br><br>This is fun. <sup>_^</sup> (Shame both Flowers went out at once, but oh well!)<br><br>hS</p>

I wonder if he&#39;ll let me ride him?<br><br>Sergio: Avoiding the Cornucopia proved to be a good idea, and I found a river rather early so I managed to get myself water and a couple of fishes. All looking good, until I ran into Nikki&#39;s mangled body. Damn, why we split up? Apparenly the killer is Androia Avatar, a night elf or something. Doesn&#39;t matter, I&#39;m used to fighting magical stuff. It&#39;s fu[BLEEEP!] on now.<br><br>Nikki: Well... that hurt. I really see now what Sergio was meaning - I&#39;ve been beaten like a complete newbye. If that was real life, I would be dead now. Time to start training again?<br><br>Rayson: I managed to run away from the Cornucopia, and then found two other players. I don&#39;t think they saw me, but I was afraid to ask them to team up - what if they killed me?</p>

            <p>And thankfully, my guys seem to be ... relatively OK, considering that Aiko decided to fight with a Flower over something, though at least she smart enough to ran away quickly and that Henry is already going insane. But hey, at least they are both still alive! <br><br>Anyway, on to the pre-game interviews! <br><br>Henry: This sounds like it will be fun. PPC agents are obviously way smarter and more creative in battle than Warrior Sues, so it should be interesting to see how fighting with other agents will go. Although I do hope that I&#39;m not forced to fight anyone from my district, specially my partner. I have read the whole The Hunger Games series so I know how these things go, but I still would rather not end killing a friend.<br><br>Aiko: I joined mostly because Henry has read that series and thus wanted to do this for some reason. I couldn&#39;t leave my friend and partner to do this crazy thing alone, though probably much like him, I hope I don&#39;t have to fight him. Not only would not like to have to fight a friend, but he&#39;s a much better physical fighter and knows how these games go better than I, so he would probably have the upper hand. But still, this sounds like it will be fun, so I hope to do my best in this.</p>

            <p><b>Henry<b></b>: Of course I ran away from the Cornucopia. If you have seen The Hunger Games in their canon, then you know any supplies there are not worth getting caught in the bloodbath that usually happens. It seems that most of people participating in these Games were smart enough to stay away from, though unfortunately my partnet decided, for some reason, to fight with a Glaurunging Flower over something. Why did they put Flowers in this anyway!? Ugh. You know, having read these things, I though I would be able to handle this better. but I think I&#39;m already starting to lose it ... <br><br><b>Aiko<b></b>: OK, so ending fighting with Captain Dandy over that bag of ... crystals? Well,  whatever those were, that probably was not the best idea. I wish I could have gotten a bow or something similar. I also wish I knew more about these Games. Henry didn&#39;t have much time to explain things to me, so it seems that he knows something about this ... Cornucopia that I didn&#39;t, since he immediately took off. That probably was smarter, considering people got blown up back there. <br><br>At least I found this Colt guy afterwards. He seems nice enough, though I don&#39;t know how well he will fare in a fight, since it doesn&#39;t serm that he is from an action department.  Though can&#39;t shake the feeling that we are being watched by someone.<br><br></b></b></p>

I&#39;m an excellent shot, I&#39;m more intelligent than most, and I don&#39;t do <i>scared</i>.

There&#39;s no point collecting weapons at this point - with 48 (wait, 44 now the cannons have gone) of us in here, anything I collect will be stolen twelve times by morning.

Why does the PPC give us partners? So we have someone to watch our backs, and help us when we get in trouble. Okay, I admit neither of my official partners in here has spared me a second glance, but there&#39;s still room for alliances. Wobbles and Jesse have been perfectly helpful - Wobbles reminds me a little of Kaitlyn, actually. And if I get hungr- no, never mind that.<br><br><b>Morgan</b><br><br>Winnig this thig is dot goig to be as easy as I thought. I dod&#39;t have a clue who that girl with do hair was, but she broke by dose with her wild swigig! Dow I&#39;b having to rud away frob levitatig fish - how ebbarassig! At least it should heal edough overdight that I&#39;ll be able to talk properly agaid...<br><br><b>Captain Dandy</b><br><br><i>What&#39;s that saying? &#39;Well begun is half-done&#39;? This game is very well-begun indeed. There wasn&#39;t much I needed at the Fertilizer-Horn - sorry, Cornucopia. The only really useful thing was a satchel of food crystals. Why that cheerful agent wanted it, I shan&#39;t even begin to guess, but I emerged victorious.<br><br>I have had the feeling someone&#39;s been following me today, though. I don&#39;t recognize their mind, but they have a trace of the Tiger Lily about them - perhaps one of her agents? Or just someone she encountered in the Arena... well, being a Flower in a chamber full of plants has its advantages; I&#39;m certain I can shake them off.</i><br><br><b>The Tiger Lily</b><br><br><i>Field report #1. Physical combat isn&#39;t as easy as it feels. Agent Supernumerary has a possible habit of assaulting Flowers - he attacked me, and I noted him stalking the Weed. I have been keeping half my mind on him, while also observing Agent Gall - contact between the two of them has been noted before, and it is possible they share similar proclivities. I will continue to monitor and report.</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br>I promise they&#39;ll get more involved as time goes on - the Tiger Lily&#39;s dispassionate prose will only last until she gets hurt. <sup>_~<br><br>Also:</sup> I skirted the issue with Morgan, but what levels of pain will the Holodeck allow? It has to hurt <i>some</i> if you break your leg, right?<br><br>(Also, I&#39;m torn - all six of this lot are fun to write, but on the other hand I kind of want some of them to get killed off to cut down my workload... :-/)<br><br>(Also also wik: this is fun! Thanks again for setting it up!)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><b>Wobbles The Clown:</b> Soooooo last night was pretty fun! I built a new play house out of mud and leaves and some sculpting balloons from the supply chest near the spot I picked and I got a good night&#39;s sleep, which is really super important because you&#39;ve got to be on your toesies around a bunch of sleep-deprived professional exterminators and that one guy from Building Maintenance who might have died already, I can&#39;t remember. But today was... kind of bad from a me-perspective because a whole bunch of people died of being horribly poisoned by Sueness and/or lightning bolts, and that gave me a whole lot of uncomfortable flashbacks, but my new buddy Gremlin was really super-nice about it and we talked about cartoons and stuff and wow do I ever have to get <i>Young Justice</i> syndicated for the show one of these days, prolly in the fall slot when we run out of <i>Steven Multiverse</i> from that weird Time Lord dimension. Gotta go, the playhouse awaits! =oD<br><br><b>Doktor Trollenfisch:</b> ... I am beink ein fried Trollenfisch at zer moment.

I set up a watch pattern with Androia, who is... really, really dead now, thanks to the local outbreak of poisoning that happened during the event, but I haven&#39;t been able to track him down and blow him up. No kills so far. Saving things for the inevitable bloody showdown.<br><br><b>Algernon, 7th Earl Wymbourne:</b> My efforts to appease the spirit of the Holodeck have alas been in vain, leaving me rather more sleep-deprived than I had hoped. This has led me to sustain gashes on my hands while hunting for berries and, well, my request for a steady source of water with which to scry the movements of my opponents was met in a rather less pleasant fashion than expected. One has to wonder if this is the right course of action... but then, what other course do I have? A lingering death, perhaps... or a swift one, spurred on by the Holodeck&#39;s seeming-endless depths of spite. One thing&#39;s for certain, though; I will seek out any former residents of the so-called &quot;grimdark&quot; canons for perspective on this matter. Their stoicism in the face of such unrelenting hate has much to teach me, and will no doubt be a comfort in my future career as a Special Response Officer.</p>

            <p>1) Don&#39;t beat yourself up over a single typo. Especially don&#39;t feel bad about typos if you decide to post from your phone. (Though you should still check for SPaG anyway.)<br><br>2) Don&#39;t post from your phone. That&#39;ll just give you problems.<br><br>3) You&#39;re going to read the Wiki a lot. This is good, because you&#39;re going to learn a lot... but you&#39;re also going to forget to do that history assignment until the last minute because you got caught up in reading about C-CADs and D.O.R.K.S.es. It&#39;s okay to not have the Wiki memorized; its there for a reason, after all.<br><br>4) You&#39;re going to tackle Legendaries. Breathe. Don&#39;t stress about it. You did okay... I think.<br><br>5) You&#39;re going to make some absolutely amazing friends through the PPC. This place is going to become your Internet family.

            <p>Alright, hello everybody. I&#39;m Kelpie and I&#39;ve been a huge fan of the PPC for several years now and I just worked up the courage to finally post on the board. I read the Original Series after hearing about the PPC from somewhere online and I instantly fell in love with the idea of fixing the messed up canons in a humorous way. I&#39;m mostly an anime fan, but I&#39;m working my way through the LotR trilogy (books, of course) at the moment. I enjoy reading and writing as well as drawing, and learning different languages. As an example, I&#39;m currently finishing my first Latin course in school. I&#39;m Canadian (and proud of it!).I hope we all get along!</p>

            <p>That&#39;s awesome! I would guess it&#39;s because English and French are similar languages. (And GTranslate kind of sucks. Don&#39;t use it. It&#39;s typically wrong anyways.) </p>

            <p>I&#39;m in this RP with a dude RPing Cadmus the Phoenician. He&#39;s using GTranslate Hebrew as a stand-in to Phoenician (since the languages are related, ish); it <i>hurts</i>. Admittedly, it&#39;s pretty funny sometimes, but it still hurts.</p>

            <p>Ooh. That would hurt. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to learn a language before using it so you use it right. He could just write in his native language and explain that his character is talking in Phoenician so it would make more sense, but it really just depends on their preference. I know it always hurts for me when someone tries to speak English but butchers it so badly it&#39;s almost unrecognizable. </p>

            <p>I definitely get how yoy feel. It also took me a while to finally introduce myself around here. But I think you&#39;ll find that this just about the warmest and most welcoming community out there. Soon enough, you&#39;ll feel that you&#39;re already  part of us and you&#39;ll likely make the most amazing friends you have ever had! So cheers and I hope you enjoy your time around here! :D<br><br> And like you, I&#39;m mostly an anime fan. What are your favorite series? Do you like any mahou shoujo shows? Oh, and since you like learning other languages, do you know any Portuguese by any chance. I&#39;m the Brazilian guy that Des mentioned below and that&#39;s my first language, so it would be awesome if you did. <br><br>Anyway, as for your welcoming gifts, please take this Bag of Holding, so that you can store the truckload of gifts you&#39;re getting and also take this Rorschach Book , which can change into virtually any written text in existence in the multiverse. Just close your eyes while holding it, think about what you wanna read, and then blink three times.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve heard good things about that one, and it&#39;s on my to-watch list. As for the languages, French and English are practically mandatory here in the frigid north.

            <p>Spanish is pretty close to Portuguese. I can understand a fair bit of it just because of that, except for cases of false tag. But if you know some Spanish, you&#39;re already at a good start for learning Portuguese.</p>

            <p>Or, how Matt convinced his grandma to watch <i>Lord of the Rings</i> with him.<br><br>So, a while ago, I mentioned how <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=288498;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=50">my paternal grandmother is the greatest human being on the planet</a>, and that we&#39;ve decided to watch the original LoTR trilogy. Today, it happened. We&#39;ve just recently finished the first part of <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i> (we&#39;ve decided to split the movies, because three hours of sitting isn&#39;t something Gran&#39;s capable of). We&#39;ve finished just after the Fellowship left Rivendell, and they&#39;ve decided to cross Caradhras. Couple of thoughts after that session:<br><br>- Gran liked the movie so far; most of her comments was about how good the visuals and the depiction of the fantasy setting was,<br>- Shire was her favourite location and she would like to live in Bag End,<br>- &quot;Nuh-uh, not for you.&quot; Her comment after Bilbo left the One Ring, and Gandalf tried to touch it,<br>- She thought hobbits weren&#39;t particulary welcome in Bree,<br>- Before the Bruinen scene, she wondered if the Ringwraiths could&#39;t travel during daytime,<br>- Before the reveal, she correctly guessed that Aragorn was Isildur&#39;s heir,<br><br>And the best thing of all: I didn&#39;t even need to ask about her favourite characters; Merry and Pippin stole her heart, ever since the dragon firework scene. Their every appearance was just conculded with a joyful cackle. I think her best reaction was when Merry broke his carrot <sup>.<sup><br><br>***<br><br>So,</sup></sup> yeah, that was fun watching it with her. I know we&#39;re gonna continue watching the movies, but if you guys want me to continue this kind of status update on introducing Gran to fandoms, let me know. After <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, we&#39;ve decided to tackle <i>Harry Potter</i>.</p>

            <p>Yes. I know. I&#39;ve heard it before. I&#39;m too young to be in a wheelchair. I&#39;m lazy. I&#39;m seeking attention. I&#39;m <i>faking</i>. <br><br><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BiP-gArCUAE2DJV.jpg">If I have the gall to so much as stand up from my chair because I feel like, for ten seconds, my back will be able to stand bearing my weight,</a> well, shame on me for not falling perfectly into your black-and-white scale of disability. If I can stand, I must not need a chair and am therefore faking. If I&#39;m not totally paralyzed from the waist down, I must not need a chair and am therefore faking.<br><br>Just because I can move my legs and don&#39;t have an obviously broken bone (the only other acceptable time to use a chair, don&#39;t you know?) doesn&#39;t mean I am able to walk. Just because there isn&#39;t something visibly wrong with me doesn&#39;t make it okay for you to interrogate me on the extent of my medical problems. That is between me, my doctors, and whichever friends and family members I decide to share with. You, a random stranger, have no right to come up to me and demand to know why I&#39;m in a wheelchair. And you <i>especially</i> have no right to accuse me of faking a disability because you saw me limp three steps from my chair to a different, more comfortable chair. There is a <i>reason</i> why I made sure the distance was that short. <br><br>If I&#39;m in so much pain that I need a chair to get around, the last thing I want and need is to have a stranger getting up in my face over something that is none of their business.<br><br>The problem is perpetuated by thinking that either you&#39;re disabled, or you&#39;re not. Either you can walk, or you can not. Disability is not an either-or situation. For the most part, I am able to walk. I am able to run. I can jump rope, ride horses, play tag. But sometimes, I am able to do none of these things, because my back hurts so badly I can barely lift my head from my pillow. Sometimes, I am able to sit up, but only with assistance. Sometimes I am able to sit up fine but can&#39;t walk without excruciating pain shooting through my spine and hip. If I was able to walk, believe me, I would be walking.<br><br>Just because you see me standing out of my chair does not mean you&#39;ve seen a miracle. You&#39;ve just seen a girl who wants to reach something and thinks she might be able to make it. If you see me struggling to stand because I need to reach something, offer your assistance. Do not, however, mock me, jeer at me, or accuse me of being lazy, or seeking attention, and <i>especially not faking</i>. (Don&#39;t insist on helping if I decline, either, but that&#39;s a rant for another day.) <br><br>Yours,<br><br>Someone who wants this ableism to stop.</p>

            <p>Notice the fluorescent lighting, too. Ugh. I HATE tube fluorescents; they&#39;re like an electrified headache with their buzzing and flickering. I know incandescent bulbs are expensive and burn out fast, so could we at least compromise on CFLs?<br><br>One other thing I see routinely in my area is this: The apartment manager neatly clears the sidewalk of snow in the winter. They do not, however, clear the curb cuts. So you get this nice clear sidewalk, and then a mountain of snow right next to the road. I mean, WTF?! I&#39;ve seen more than one guy in a wheelchair in the road, because the sidewalks are unusable because the curb cuts are not cleared. And it&#39;s not like wheelchairs are unusual around here; we&#39;re right next to a university that&#39;s well-known for its ability to accommodate disabled students and thus for its large disabled student population. But no.<br><br>But no. Apparently it&#39;s perfectly fine to force wheelchair users into the road, even though since they&#39;re seated they have an even higher risk of being involved in a traffic accident than someone who&#39;s standing does.</p>

            <p>I have a friend myself who uses a wheelchair, but not all the time, so I&#39;m fully aware that it&#39;s a thing. But I&#39;d like to flatter myself that even if I didn&#39;t have said friend, I would have the brainpower to figure out that if I saw someone get up from their wheelchair, then it means that they don&#39;t need it all the time, not that they don&#39;t need it at all.<br><br>People like that are just a--holes and you&#39;re absolutely right: They have no right to question you and throw accusations at you.

            <p>Some people don&#39;t like thinking very much, do they? I mean, it should be obvious that there are things in between &quot;Completely unable to walk, ever&quot; and &quot;Can walk as far as I like without pain&quot;, and that, at some point, a wheelchair is far more convenient, fast, and comfortable.

It doesn&#39;t matter if that was a good brain day and I&#39;m going to pay for it by having to take it easy for at least 24 hours thereafter; people just assume that hey, if I did it once, I should be able to do it whenever I like.<br><br>Every time you have a good day and people see you can do something, they hold it against you.</p>

            <p>My first thought was &#39;Did anyone on Board said something that sparked this?&#39;, but after we&#39;ve learned that it was because of college I can agree that humans, more often than not, are d-bags. Yes, I include myself in that, but that&#39;s beside the point.<br><br>After an accident, sometimes my left ankle refuses to work. The pain usually lasts couple of hours, then subsides, but couple of months ago it was so bad I couldn&#39;t stand up from my chair. I panicked. For the rest of the day, I had to use a makeshift cane to move around. This usually doesn&#39;t prevent me from doing activities (I used to train capoeira; it was fun, but right now it&#39;s out of the question), but sometimes it does. This, and the fact that I look like the Fat Bastard from <i>Austin Powers</i>, made people think that it&#39;s okay to tell me to exercise more and more, and that I&#39;m lazy and ambition-less... Even if I know all of that, and it doesn&#39;t come easy for me, it doesn&#39;t matter because apparently I&#39;m not even trying to do anything about myself. So yeah, I kinda get what you&#39;re feeling, Ix.</p>

Is this rant one of those things where you just needed to get something off your chest but don&#39;t actually want to talk about it, or is it okay to ask what prompted the rant, or what?

            <p>The PPC doesn&#39;t do sporkings of religious badfic (except for that one Bible fanfiction that one time) because it&#39;s basically flame bait. I assume that the same thing applies if it&#39;s trollfic.</p>

            <p>SkarmorySilver&#39;s already covered the thing with the bold-text-clouds, which, I admit, do tend to make my eyes sort of glaze over. Other than that, (and SPaG problems I&#39;m probably too stupid to notice) my only problem is Officer Murphy/Harvey. <br><br>I understand that I&#39;m not a badass. That word cannot be applied to me. I could be bad, easy. An ass, done. Badass? No. <br>I can figure that Harvey, police officer, over here, probably has greater mental fortitude than some nobody teenager in Western Sydney, but I still feel like his reaction to &#39;Your entire existence is a lie, you can join out interdimensional organisation, or we can erase your memory, also, there are still things that we consider weird,&#39; being a Matrix reference and what was essentially &#39;Oh, okay. Sure.&#39; is a little bit odd. <br><br>Otherwise, I enjoyed it. I especially like one of the starting lines: &#39;Agent Richard Legard, who currently resembled a walking pile of his luggage,&#39; <br>I can&#39;t put my finger on it. <br>Well, I can, but if I did I would sound sort of pretentious, so I won&#39;t. </p>

            <p>Were I writing it, I probably would have made him go into a sort of confused denial - thinking the entire thing is a dream until actually ending up in PPC headquarters, and then reacting accordingly (plenty of screaming and curling into foetal positions and whatnot,) maybe pop him into ficpsych for a bit, that sort of thing. <br><br>I say &#39;were I writing it,&#39; because, obviously, there are other, probably better ways of going about it, and I only considered it going this way because that&#39;s how I imagine myself in such a situation, and because it gives quite a lot of comedic opportunity. <br>I also just feel that a hard boiled police officer type would probably react that way, as opposed to say, fainting, or going kill-crazy, or making movie references and just going along with it. <br>Mind you, it&#39;s still YOUR guy we&#39;re going on about, here.

            <p>I have never read the Dresden Files, but I still found this pretty entertaining and, for your agents, a Right Start as it were. The only big thing that bothered me reading this mission was the fact that a lot of the excerpts were put in completely intact, resulting in large walls of boldface text, but I think that can be fixed in future missions. Don&#39;t be afraid to use an ellipsis in brackets to cut out parts of an excerpt you don&#39;t need - page space isn&#39;t a priority (aside from overall mission length), but keeping the reader from getting bored is. ;)<br><br>Also, a few SPaG things I&#39;ve spotted:<br><br><i>(and with much capslock)</i><br>Stylistic and humor preference, but I&#39;d go with all-caps for CAPSLOCK.<br><br><i>Getting cornered in an alley, with a desperate run into the Nevernever as your only option, and only then get dropped in a place you never thought existed...</i><br>For the sake of parallelism, &quot;get&quot; should be changed to &quot;getting&quot;.<br><br><i>“Like this overblown description of sunrise’s effect on enchanted items,” Marina replied.</i><br>Should be &quot;of the sunrise&#39;s&quot;.<br><br><i>Dresden pushed the goblin back with a telekinetic spell before rushing to his car, completely unfazed by its status as a literal blue beetle. Once the small insect was rushing away from the ruckus which had unfolded around his apartment, the agents were finally able to react to this turn of events.</i><br>Given that he&#39;s implied to have been riding inside the beetle later on, perhaps it would be better to say &quot;Once the giant insect was rushing away...&quot;?<br><br><i>If her brother looked at Marina with surprise, Murphy showed none. “Took enough time. What the matter?”</i><br>You mean &#39;What&#39;s the matter?&#39;<br><br>There may be some more, but I have to get ready for work tomorrow. Great mission, again! :D</p>

            <p>For the other ones, they were narrative choices. Since the Suethor miscapitalized Beetle, I decided to go for the small insect. And since Murphy is possessed at the moment of this dialog, she&#39;s talking in the Suethor&#39;s style.<br><br>I tried my best about quotations, but I wasn&#39;t sure what text I should get rid, so...<br><br>Wrong Start is more about the meeting between Dresden and Murphy here (and the way they get dropped in the mission too.).

            <p>As some of you know already, I am currently working on a crossover fanfic between <i>Pokemon</i> and <i>Bakugan: Battle Brawlers</i>. However, recent trends are troubling me. First off, I am receiving <i>very</i> few reviews on FFN, and absolutely none on DeviantArt.<br><br>But that&#39;s not the most troubling part.<br><br>The <i>really</i> troubling thing is that almost <i>every</i> person on FFN who is following or favoriting my story is a badfic reader! Every time I see a &quot;X has favorited your story&quot; e-mail, a quick look at that user&#39;s favorites list shows badfic after badfic!<br><br>Does this mean that I&#39;m actually writing a badfic, despite my best efforts? I do quite a bit of research into the canons that I am using, I use a beta, and I try to keep my characters in-character. Yet this is what&#39;s going on. So now I&#39;m stumped. I&#39;m sure that there are a few accomplished goodfic writers here, so I&#39;m now asking: Any advice?</p>

            <p>Must admit I find the idea of crossing one of the most optimistic Magical Girl show with one of the darkest one is interesting. I&#39;m sure the complete story will be perfect.<br><br>Sorry if I&#39;m suggesting something you already used, but did you think about an interaction between the Wolkenritter and the Puella Magi? The condition of the former don&#39;t seem to be without links with the latter, so I thought it could be interesting.</p>

            <p>The poor thing will already face Fate, Nanoha, and hoping everyone will be alright, four Puellae Magi. The battle has already enough potential curbstomp. Besides, if they heard about this situation, nothing would stop the Yagami family from coming to help, so no cameo. (That said, I really hope the &#39;why Hayate won&#39;t appear&#39; omake is also the epilogue for this story.)</p>

            <p>I know you said they&#39;re not to appear, and the reason for this is logical, but I think the Wolkenritter could still be mentionned by Nanoha and/or Fate to the Puellae Magi if one of them begins to show signs she&#39;s gonna Witch out. Fate talked about her own origins to Homura when she began talking about the Puellae&#39;s... depressing situation, but the mention of the Book of Darkness Incident, with the &#39;nobody left behind&#39; approach, and mention some of their best friends are real persons living millenia ago and who are &#39;programms&#39; linked to a magical object could lift their spirits.<br><br>I&#39;m going epileptic with the second one, but you could also have some speculation about the fact Earth has so few potentials mages because the Incubators are &#39;culling&#39; potential mages with their action, the &quot;karmic weight&quot; being also the potential power of the Puellae&#39;s Linker Cores.<br><br>Even if it doesn&#39;t perfectly fit for your story, I genuinely think these points are interresting. Hope you think the same way.</p>

            <p>Hey so the name&#39;s Kara and I&#39;m pretty new here. A friend recommended this thing after I announced in some other site that I&#39;d have to stop my OC reviews because of a break-up. I said I&#39;d check this out so here I am. Anyway, I&#39;m pretty invested in PJO/HOO, The Mortal Instruments (and other related series), and HP, among others. There are a few tv shows here and there like The 100, and Person of Interest plus some games like Assassin&#39;s Creed and Final Fantasy. Sometimes I also think that I&#39;m one of the few people left in the world who&#39;s still bitter over Young Justice. Yeah, that&#39;s p much all to say rn.</p>

In sunlight, it increases the Attack and Accuracy of the holder by 2 stages, though in rain it lowers both by 1. However, Simipour isn&#39;t an exceptional fit for it; being a Water-type, its STAB is weakened by Sunny Day and it&#39;s difficult to deal with, considering its physical movepool is somewhat lacking. Try an Adamant set with Aqua Tail, Crunch, Ice Punch, and Rock Slide if you&#39;re set on using the item. But just be sure to have fun. =]</p>

            <p>I like this first-person take on the concept. Sure, it&#39;s dark (especially with the whole &quot;killing different versions of yourself&quot; thing), but in a very effective way.

            <p>As written below, I&#39;m preparing a pseudo-official season of the PPC HQ Hunger Games folowing Huinesoron&#39;s example. As this is supposed to be the following season, I will followhis example and set it up as an Holodeck simulation.<br><br>This will feature:<br><br>- 48 tribute line-up, to allow for as many Agents as we can to fit in!<br>- Edited events list to add more weapons, random events and PPC crazyness!<br>- This time, live on... Nutmeg TV, maybe? (AKA: I&#39;ll have two characters of mine do commentary from inside the arena. One possible death cause will, indeed, be a contestant attacking them only to be mowed down by submachine gun fire)<br>- Every contestant can provide their own comments at the end of each day. This will be done on the Board, I&#39;ll make a full readable document with everything in it afterwards.<br><br>So, according to Huinesoron&#39;s idea, every  boarder who wants to join in can provide up to four contestants (a full district). If you don&#39;t have enough Agents, though, don&#39;t worry: you can team up with another Boarder, or even have your team topped up by free-to-use characters. I fully intend to throw a Flower or two in the battle if there are empty slots to be filled.<br><br>For each contestant I&#39;ll need: full name, shorter nickname to be used in the &quot;report&quot;, gender, and a signature weapon or power. A link to an image would be appreciated if they don&#39;t have images on the Wiki page. The signature weapon/power is just for flavor in the commentary, as not all the death events mention a specific weapon and there are chances that no weapon was mentioned for the contestant beforehand.<br><br>My contestants, for example, are these:<br><br>Corolla (Corolla) (F) Magic energy darts<br>Rayson Kerman (M) Telescopic ladder<br>Sergio Turbo (Sergio) (M) Pistol<br>Nikki Cherryflower (Nikki) Magic energy sword<br><br>As Huinesoron and Iximaz already gave me their lists (I&#39;ll still need the signature attack method, though), there are still 36 spots left. Who&#39;s in?</p>

            <p>The roar of the rushing water almost made Gaspard&#39;s words inaudible. &quot;I have the high ground!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Neeeeeeeerd!&quot; yelled back Harris, who was precariously perched on a rock over the thundering river. <br><br>&quot;Excuse me?&quot; shouted back Gaspard. He tried to ignore the burning feeling in the gash in his right leg. That DoSAT intern had been quick with his lightsaber-- but ultimately not quick enough for a simple pointed stick. Come to think of it, that was kind of an embarrassing way to lose this game. He got down to one knee to alleviate the pressure on his injury and watched Harris from the riverbank. &quot;What did you say?&quot;<br><br>&quot;NEEEEEEEEEEERD!&quot; repeated Harris. &quot;Are you seriously quoting the <i>Star Wars</i>  prequels of all things?<br><br>&quot;So what if I am?!&quot; yelled back Gaspard. &quot;I survived the lot of them-- all of the PPC&#39;s deadliest nutjobs! I&#39;ve earned that right!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not yet!&quot; said Harris, windmilling his arms a little to keep his balance. &quot;You haven&#39;t survived me!&quot;<br><br>Gaspard sat down and put down his stick. &quot;Somehow, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to be a problem,&quot; he said. <br><br>&quot;You underestimate my power!&quot; said Harris. He crouched in preparation for a jump.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t try it!&quot; said Gaspard, stumbling to his feet and grabbing his spear. <br><br>Harris bellowed incoherently and jumped. He was promptly swept away by the water and dashed against the sharp rocks further downstream. <br><br>Gaspard blinked. &quot;Um.

            <p>((With apologies to all involved. Don&#39;t worry, I <i>do</i> know you&#39;re not a bunch of psychopaths! I just loved the PC-Nesh interactions, and this sort of happened...))<br><br>They had been a team. PoorCynic and Phobos had been skeptical of each other, almost coming to blows at the Feast, but Neshomeh had been the glue that held them together. Until that morning.<br><br>Clean water had been scarce in the Arena - that had been clear from the number of canteens in the Cornucopia - and Phobos had repeatedly turned down his drinks to allow the others to have more. When he awoke, weak from thirst, Neshomeh had nothing to give him. He died shortly before noon.<br><br>For a time, Neshomeh seemed okay - until the pair chanced across Kaitlyn. They hadn&#39;t really run across her very much - Phobos had hunted with her on fourth day, but for the most part she seemed inclined to stay out of the way. PoorCynic assumed they would follow their usual tactic of giving the other Tribute a wide berth. After all, there were still five of them left; there was no need to get reckless.<br><br>Neshomeh&#39;s face was still calm as she tied Kaitlyn down, picked up the lighter from where the other woman had dropped it, and carefully lit the fire.<br><br>PoorCynic fled. He ran until he practically tripped over BeautyID; as they hid together in the undergrowth, he warned her in hushed tones of Neshomeh&#39;s madness.<br><br>Then she found them.<br><br>BeautyID died hard, and PoorCynic didn&#39;t look back when her screaming abruptly stopped and the cannon fired. He ran out of the forest region, across the desert, into the rocky maze. It was the only place he might stand a chance.<br><br>Neshomeh followed.<br><br>Neither of them slept that night. They hunted each other under the light of the waning moon, peering into the harsh shadows thrown by the sandstone cliffs. At last, as dawn drew near, PoorCynic saw his chance. Leaping from the clifftop, he landed atop Neshomeh, bearing her down onto the ground.<br><br>But... he couldn&#39;t do it. Panting, he stared down at his onetime ally. Wordlessly, he dropped the rock, stumbled to his feet, and held out his hand.<br><br>The cannon sounded. Tough Cookie had stayed out of everyone&#39;s way, slowly growing weaker from hunger. The fishing gear she had grabbed at the Cornucopia had been a red herring; there were no fish in the Arena. She had slept through the previous day, rousing only briefly when her sponsor sent a canteen of water. Now, unable even to wake up, she died.<br><br>PoorCynic stared up at her image in the brightening sky. He never even saw Neshomeh&#39;s sais.<br><br>The cannon roared for the last time as Neshomeh straightened up. Meticulously, she wiped the blood from her blades, and waited to be collected.<br><br>hS</p>

I&#39;m not.<br><br>I AM surprised at how bloodthirsty Agent Neshomeh was, blowing people up in their sleep and all. Jeez. O.o Phobos says I probably snapped, turned violent, and eventually completely lost my mind and ended up on top of a freezing mountain.<br><br>All the random deaths from dysentery, infection, and hypothermia do seem to indicate a pretty harsh environment in this arena. Blades, explosives, and poison water and food. Not nice. Probably got high ratings, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh &amp; Phobos</p>

            <p>Chris Chibnall, the heir apparent to the Whovian tomato-target throne, has done quite a bit of work in TV. However, the quality has been, er... let&#39;s call it curate&#39;s egg. He was a major scriptwriter for the first two series of <i>Torchwood</i>, which were okay once they got going, but he&#39;s also worked on <i>Camelot</i>, a Starz-only show about King Arthur which somehow contrived to be worse than the BBC&#39;s <i>Merlin</i>, and an episode of <i>Spooks: Code 9</i>, which for fans of Section D is a show that did not happen ever you can&#39;t prove it what are those tapes you&#39;re holding in that hand near my flamethrower ha ha ha they&#39;d better not be.<br><br>His work on <i>Doctor Who</i> has been similarly up and down. I absolutely loved &quot;Dinosaurs On A Spaceship&quot; because it felt like a Classic Who episode, unafraid of looking silly and with some really good jokes in it. However, he also made the &quot;The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood&quot; two-parter, which was really quite bad. All I&#39;m saying is that Moffat at least had a few unalloyed hits under his belt before taking over the show.<br><br>Still, I wish Chibnall all the best for the future, and hopefully he won&#39;t do anything completely stupid. I mean, he&#39;ll probably do <i>something</i> stupid, this is <i>Doctor Who</i> we&#39;re talking about, it&#39;s part of the fun of the series, but hopefully the show under him won&#39;t be afraid to be entertaining and will be afraid of being portentous and doomy.<br><br>And hey, it might mean we get Caro Skinner back, so that&#39;ll be... something. =]</p>

            <p>If not, there is still a good Second Doctor story set in 2018.

            <p>I have three canon experts at the ready, but one may not be as available as we thought and the other two are not native English speakers, so I need someone who can do SPaG beta work.
