            <p>Well, you&#39;re certainly thorough. Nothing left for me to ask, really, so here&#39;s a Royal Ice Cream Container! Instructions for operating are as follows:<br><br>1. Close lid.<br>2. Speak desired flavor of ice cream aloud.<br>3. Open lid.<br>4. Enjoy!<br><br>Comes with all, and I mean all flavors, but don&#39;t blame me if you vomit from the Grass, Turnips, and Human Flesh combo. *Shudders.* Please, don&#39;t make that exist, for my sake. Oh, it also functions as a very effective shield. Our tests have proved that, when in direct confrontation with a nuclear bomb, the Royal Ice Cream Container wins. The ice cream isn&#39;t even radioactive afterwards. However, this particular one has a slight flaw in its magical programming. If you attempt to try Spidren-flavored ice cream, and again, I beg you, don&#39;t make that exist. It&#39;s rather disturbing to think of a human eating that. However, if you do decide to try it, when you open the lid, you&#39;ll get a vision straight from the Chamber of the Ordeal, and seriously, those suck. Ask Kel. If you don&#39;t know what either of those things are, and the phrase &#39;Protector of the Small&#39; means absolutely nothing to you, then just take my word for it and don&#39;t make Spidren-flavored ice cream.</p>

            <p>&#39;Holding talks with people who want your country to stop existing&#39; is why Northern Ireland is at relative peace, why North and South Korea aren&#39;t shooting each other too much, why, in some senses, there&#39;s no Soviet Union any more.

Poking fun at bad writing is a side story to characters interacting with each other, and you balance those two goals perfectly.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if something happened in real life, or you&#39;re just tiring somewhat of the PPC after writing so much, or if it&#39;s something else entirely. Whatever happened, though, I wish you the best of luck.</p>

            <p>I’m still a quite inexperienced fanfic reader and had no idea what writers can get up to, rewriting a chapter but leaving old versions of rewritten paragraphs in and still not caring for anything.<br><br>James and Saxo’s mission, though, was a delight to read. To understand their developing relationship better, I even went back and reread their previous mission. This doesn’t happen often, so you can be proud on making me doing that.<br><br>Alas, while your betas did a very good job here, I couldn’t avoid noticing some typos in that previous mission:<br><i> There is <b>now</b> how and why.</i> (Should be &quot;no&quot;.)<br><i> James chomped down on his hand and Saxo yanked <b>it back it</b> with a yelp.</i> (Remove second &quot;it&quot;.)<br><i>Do not get <b>to</b> comfortable,</i> (should be &quot;too&quot;).<br><br>(And for a brief moment, I wondered whether I should send the Uncanonical Department of Inaccuracies into &quot;Smells of Rose aka. The Enemy of my Enemy&quot;. While it is true that Harry’s age is always the number of his Hogwarts year plus ten, eighteen year old students at Hogwarts are not impossible and not even unusual. Since Hermione’s birthday is in September, as mentioned in PoA, she turned seventeen not more than thirty days after the beginning of her sixth Hogwarts year, and was actually eighteen through most of her seventh year. But since the badfic can’t decide in which year it is set and Hermione is not supposed to be at Hogwarts for most of her seventh year – except for the final battle – I guess I can let that slip, pretending that the charge &quot;still going to Hogwarts at the age of 18&quot; is just oddly worded.)<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I did another fic, Ski Trip, where the author posted the same chapter twice instead of a new chapter.

            <p>Hello everybody!<br>I want to address two things which involve the Discord channel.<br>1) The channel&#39;s been around for roughly two and a half months and doesn&#39;t show any sign of disappearing. I think it should be mentioned in the Board header (just linking to it isn&#39;t possible since Instant Invites expire after 24 hours).<br>2) What exactly is acceptable in it, language-wise? There have been some disagreements lately, and I want to hear the community&#39;s opinion on this.</p>

            <p>Foul language is not something that bothers me personally, but I understand why other people would be upset. I&#39;m okay with the idea of using mild oaths and adult language on the Discord. Stuff like h*ll or d*mn.<br><br>I couldn&#39;t find the exact specifics for what was acceptable profanity-wise in PG movies, so I can&#39;t comment as to how effective that would be. The most common thing I saw was that &quot;sexually-derived expletives&quot; were considered to be more offensive, so I would suggest total restrictions on those (unless we&#39;re playing Cardgames Against Headquarters/Humanity, in which case all bets are off).</p>

Joining is easy - just ask the mods or the owner for an invite. <a href="https://discordapp.com/register">Registration</a> is easy and recommended, both to ensure that it stays unique to you and to reduce clutter in the user list of the channel; however, it is not strictly required as long as you have an invite.<br>The rules are simple: abide by the Constitution and don&#39;t be a dick. There are mods that will enforce those rules; they can manage the channel and kick misbehaving members. Bans, however, are only enacted as a community-wide ban and are only implemented by the owner of the server.<br>There are three main channels in the server:<br>-#generic<em>channel: general conversation and daily talk about pretty much anything.<br>-#rudis: RP channel, set in <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Rudi's">Rudi&#39;s pub</a>. No Permission is necessary to join, because the RP isn&#39;t canon unless it is integrated into a canon piece.<br>-#recs</em>n_plugs: exactly what it says on the tin. Mostly music plugs, but there have been book recommendations, funny clips and other such things.&quot;<br><br>We can also list the mods or something, and I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s anything else to be said?</p>

            <p>the Lounge in its current iteration has no concrete rules for language — It just has the Constitution; that&#39;s one of the reasons I started this thread. I changed the bit in the wiki article, though. And I really hope the community can reach some sort of accord on this — &quot;every mod has their own view of what is and isn&#39;t Constitutional&quot; is bound to cause problems down the line.</p>

            <p>I think it&#39;s reasonable to use the same rules that apply here on the Discord channel, which means keeping everything safe for work and kid-friendly (no cursing).

            <p>Not everyone agrees on proper language for the board, either, as shown by the &quot;pissed off&quot; incident a few weeks (or possibly months, my sense of time is off) ago. Personally I think the MPAA guideline for what qualifies for PG should be fine. After all, you have to be at least 13 to even join the PPC (though we have had some members lie about their age) so I don&#39;t see why we should enforce stricter content guidelines than what is already considered appropriate for that age group.</p>

            <p>First off, what Des said. Please cut it out, Data.<br><br>Second off, can maybe both of you A) refrain from replying to each other for a while, or B) seek some kind of conflict resolution? Every single time I see that Data has replied to hS, or vice versa, I have this brief moment of hope, where I think that maybe it&#39;ll be something of a peace offering, and everyone will calm down. Instead (and I just glanced back through the past couple pages), nearly every time, it turns into snarking irritably at each other.<br><br>I&#39;m not blaming either of you for this overall pattern, for the record, though I suspect that will offend both of you. <br><br>I will admit this is guesswork, based on what I know of your respective personalities. If I offend you in this, I apologize - I&#39;m only trying to point out something I think might help. That said, this is what I think is going on:<br>Data has a posting style that tends to be brief and irreverent, and hS has a posting style that tends to be detailed and narrative. When hS feels his posts aren&#39;t getting adequate responses, but drive-by put-downs, he naturally feels disrespected. When Data&#39;s posts get lengthy, word-by-word responses, they feel attacked and undeservedly dressed-down. This is, I suspect, due to the fandoms and fandom experiences both of you have been through. Regardless of its origin, it remains that <i>regardless of original intent</i>, both of you have the tendency to quickly feel disrespected and upset after conversing, and start firing back. I see Data get into insults more quickly, but again, I suspect that&#39;s because they are -reading- hS&#39;s posts as insults.<br><br>Again, I&#39;ve been hoping for a long time that a peace would naturally occur between you. But it doesn&#39;t appear to be forthcoming at this point, so I&#39;m going to ask, in light of the fact that almost every time you interact it turns into a personal argument of some sort, that we start talking about a solution. Of some sort.<br><br>If I&#39;ve overstepped my bounds or am being condescending or have upset either of you, I really do apologize. I don&#39;t mean to. I&#39;m just very tired of seeing two people I tend to like as individuals ripping on each other.<br><br>-VM</p>

            <p>Of course it doesn&#39;t, and of course it shouldn&#39;t. That&#39;s why I started the post by asking Data to cut it out. But again, your posts feel just as disrespectful to them as theirs do to you.<br><br>Your actions seem reasonable and merited to you. Data&#39;s actions seem reasonable and merited to them. I assume. On this thread, I would say Data certainly crossed the line first. They saw an attack where none was intended. ...I assume.<br><br>On the other hand, if someone replied to you with this:<br><i>Wonderful. I&#39;m glad you were able to correct my lack of trivia knowledge without addressing the fact that your argument, point, and premise were entirely wrong.</i><br><br>...would you -not- see it as an attack, or at least, unmerited snark? I&#39;d be a bit defensive.<br><br>Again. Please don&#39;t think I&#39;m trying to attack you. I promise that&#39;s not my intent. But lately, your replies to Data feel a lot like my earlier replies to July. I saw them as necessary - contradicting stands I saw as wrong and needing correction. <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=290961;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=525">It culminated with this, if you don&#39;t remember.</a> She, correctly, saw them as a knee-jerk response to someone I had a beef with. I was being immature and holding a many-years-long grudge over past drama. This, between you and Data, is obviously very different, in large part because it&#39;s very recently that Data has said some really nasty things about you, and very recently that you proposed a ban for them. So the wound is pretty recent. And I&#39;m <i>not saying you don&#39;t have legitimate cause</i>.<br><br>What it comes down to is that I don&#39;t see Data or you responding to urgent issues that need responses, I see both of you taking opportunities where you have a legitimate reason to argue with someone you have a beef with. I&#39;m honestly convinced that it&#39;s a matter of time before there&#39;s another drama blowup (and I&#39;m not convinced I haven&#39;t just started one, which would suck a lot). Ideally, I&#39;d ask you both again to try and work this out. But at this point, you&#39;ve made it clear you see no point in trying to mend fences with someone who deliberately antagonizes you. (Given Data&#39;s behavior, I assume they feel the same way.)<br><br>I understand that you&#39;d like to utterly ignore Data Junkie whenever possible. I get it. Essentially, what I&#39;m asking is that, either you not make exceptions for things like this, or that you bear in mind when you do, that you&#39;re reading their posts through a very specific lens.<br><br>And I would <i>very much</i> give Data the same advice, if they would listen. That they are reading all of your posts through a lens of &quot;We Speak Different Internet Dialects&quot; and also through &quot;We Don&#39;t Like Each Other.&quot; If they can&#39;t put this lens down, and even if they can, it would ultimately be very helpful if this would stop happening.</p>

I can&#39;t promise never to interact with Data Junkie; if I see them (to restate the current thread) trying to change the language acceptable in the PPC community to something I think would be both personally and communally off-putting, based on a completely wrong starting premise, then I <b>will</b> say something - and I&#39;m not going to do some silly &#39;reply to someone else&#39;s post with what I would have said to them&#39; thing, either.

            <p>Confession: I had to look this up on the CARA (the group that designed the MPAA&#39;s rating system) website, so I thought others may be confused as well. To clarify, some profanity may be used in a PG movie, short of the F-bomb, which would immediately make a movie PG-13 at least. Common use of profanity would also make the rating PG-13 if Discord were a film.<br><br>Side note: Making a chatroom into a film is probably a terrible idea.</p>

I don&#39;t know if she stayed, but there was someone from... China, I think, quite possibly with a cat in her name somewhere?

            <p>For how new I am, I&#39;ve been reading up on the PPC before I&#39;ve made my introductory post here. I know what makes a Mary Sue, and what makes a good character. I already know the rules pretty well, and I&#39;m just here to have fun!<br>First up, this is my idea for an Agent. Agent Cyan, everybody!<br><br>~Basic Stuff~<br>Name: Cyan (no surname)<br>Species: Human<br>Age: 27<br>Gender: Male<br>Home Continuum: Terraria<br><br>~Appearance~<br>He has light brown hair, whitish skin, brown eyes, and is of moderate height. He is seen wearing a light blue shirt with a picture of the Vortex Fragment on it, dark blue pants, blue Flurry Boots, and a Night Vision Helmet when he&#39;s not in PPC missions. On missions, he wears a Vortex Armor replica, and wields a Phantasm, to complete the theme.<br><br>~Personality~<br>He is outgoing and enthusiastic around his fellow agents. He is imaginative, and makes new ideas to terminate Sues and Stus as he goes. Usually too late. He likes video games, music, the PPC, Terraria, sci-fi, space, and technology in general. He dislikes canon disturbances, especially when they&#39;re somehow in Terraria, misspellings, urple prose, overused memes, and pretty much anything that&#39;s alive and bigger than him.<br><br>~Powers~<br>Due to him being from a video game world, he has a weak hammerspace inventory, a small storage of mana, and a well-rounded knowledge of video games and their mechanics.<br><br>~History~<br>At age 22, he was one of the first Terrarians to enter space through a rocket. It didn&#39;t last very long, though. A meteor struck the rocket, wrecking half of it. All of the crew launched their escape pods, which landed safely back on Terraria. But Cyan&#39;s pod just drifted through space, floating near the Vortexians&#39; planet, until it entered a chain of plotholes, getting him stuck in random canons for 5 years, with only his music player and some supplies to accompany him. At this time, he drifted into other canons, how they&#39;re supposed to be, Mary Sues, and consequently, the PPC. After this time period, he escaped the plothole chain, and landed on HQ.<br><br>~Department~<br>Cyan feels that he has many canons to fix, with such little time. He is in the Department of Floaters because of this.<br><br>Second up, these are my prompt samples.<br>1. Control Prompt: The agent recieves a mission.<br><br>It was a normal day in HQ. The cafeteria was serving its usual &quot;food,&quot; the Flowers were doing their job, and canons were being repaired. This would be Cyan&#39;s first day in the PPC. He enters the cafeteria, wearing his casual clothes. A light blue shirt that was decorated with the picture of a Vortex Fragment, generic light blue pants, cold blue shoes that augmented his speed, and a night vision helmet, which was decorative.<br><br>Cyan looked at his watch, and it seemed that it was Wednesday, the day the cafeteria actually serves real food. It was his lucky day. He walked closer to the line, when suddenly-<br><br>[BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!]<br><br>&quot;Seriously?&quot; <br><br>Cyan didn&#39;t know how the Console worked, so this took him by surprise. He looked at the Console, and it said that it was his job.<br><br>&quot;Well, here goes nothing.&quot; <br><br>He donned a replica of the Vortex Armor, and put his Phantasm in his Terrarian inventory. He was ready. He runs into the portal, ready to repair the plot continuum.<br><br>But there was a banana peel in the way.

            <p>Isn&#39;t the reason we ask newbies to name the badfic they plan to spork first so that the PGs can see that the applicant knows what makes a badfic sporkable?

            <p>Over the last three years, I mentioned on several occasions that I’m not sure whether I actually want to write missions. Whenever this happened, somebody pointed out that I could write about the infrastructure departments, or write interludes for agents whose actual missions I just skip (apparently people want to see me write something). Doing this obviously still requires Permission, because the writing would be representing the PPC, but I don’t see why it would require the demonstrable ability to find missionable badfic and to explain why this badfic is sporkable. Maybe we shouldn’t make the stakes too high? On the other hand, applicants usually <i>do</i> want to write missions, so implementing a Restricted Permission to write everything PPC that isn’t a mission – that requires everything required for full Permission except choosing a badfic – would be ridiculous.<br><br>I don’t remember any Permission requests from the last three years where the badfic to be sporked was chosen from the Unclaimed Badfic list. Except my own, where I implied that this might be a reason to turn me down, but got Permission anyway. (I’m the biggest Mary Sue on the Board; everybody loves me and PGs go out of their way to fulfill my every whim :-) Actually, I just don’t like to actively search for badfic, and will probably always depend on others proposing badfic to spork. I don’t believe that this says anything about the ability – which I still have to demonstrate – to do the sporking. But the PGs may be justified in asking that the answer to &#39;and why you&#39;ve chosen it&#39; in such cases shows some own thoughts beyond copypasting the reasons given by the original proponent. (I, of course, would just have pointed to PC’s appropriate workshop, where I had already started to prepare for the mission.) <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Has choosing an appropriate fic to spork been a common problem historically/recently? I&#39;m actually inclined to say yes, and that hS&#39;s proposal would help things (by clarifying why we want to see the fic they&#39;ve chosen) but I want to double-check that we&#39;re not changing the rules unless there&#39;s actually a problem. Overcomplicating the application process will just make it scarier to new writers. And, yeah, we want it to be scary, to keep out people who aren&#39;t committed enough, but let&#39;s not make it any scarier than it needs to be, please. <br><br>--Key&#39;s bias is that she is working on her own Permission piece and hopes not to freak out and give up like last time</p>

            <p>Some fics are so short that it may be difficult to justify why a single thing is major enough to be a badfic. For example, there exists a Skyrim fic where the main problem boils down to &quot;Magic doesn&#39;t work that way.&quot; This doesn&#39;t seem horrible enough to spork, but &quot;Someone uses a spell that grants the user whatever they want for Bad Slash&quot; probably does.<br><br>Giving away that reason may take some humor value out of the sporking if it&#39;s the main problem.

            <p>OK, disclaimer: I don&#39;t even have Permission yet, so I&#39;m certainly not a PG. Most of the constructive criticism I could offer has already been said, so I&#39;ll skip over that. I&#39;d defer to other people who&#39;ve been around longer than me and actually know what they&#39;re doing if they say that any of this is wrong.<br><br>What I can say is that there&#39;s a wonderful guide on the PPC wiki all about creating characters. I think that two of the reasons agents usually work in pairs are that (1.) it reduces the likelihood of accidentally writing a Sue/Stu, and (2.) it allows for humorous banter and more character development. Try creating a partner for Cyan and see what happens.<br><br>Beyond just going through a wiki walk about the PPC, I&#39;d recommend reading missions and interludes done by other people, finding something you like, and thinking about why you like it. What are the agents like? How do they develop over time? Thinking about these things will help with creating your own characters and their personalities.</p>

A beta&#39;s job is to look over the story and catch the mistakes you don&#39;t; the good ones also tell you when you write nonsense, too. Based on the stuff in your prompts — yes, you need a beta. Preferably, more than one.<br><br><br><b>Writing ability (creative):</b> Well then. The prompts are, frankly, too short to be interesting and are full of plot holes and mistakes — Granz, Larfen and HG pointed most of those out. Further, Permission prompts should be between 400 and 800 words. While this isn&#39;t a hard rule, you need a good reason to break it, and I don&#39;t see one here.<br><br><b>Conclusion:</b> You need to hang around for some more time, get to know people and let the community get to know you. You need to step up your game w.r.t. knowledge of the PPC and the technical quality of your pieces. You need to use the services of a beta reader(s). <b>Permission denied.</b></p>

            <p>Now, first of all I&#39;m no PG.

Now, it&#39;s good that you&#39;re not going to just give up after one try, but one of the things that is stated in the Permission article on the PPC Wiki is &quot;7) Once you&#39;re sufficiently oriented and sure of what you want to do, post your permission request on the Board.&quot; To me, you&#39;re not sure of what you want to do, by putting those brackets in there, it says to me that you&#39;re not sure whether to do this,and you&#39;ve put it out more jut because you can rather than because you want to. Also, when is later? Is it later today? Next week? Next month? I would suggest the latter, but it&#39;s not encouraging to see those brackets in the subject title. <br><br>Secondly we&#39;ll look at the first sentence &quot;For how new I am.&quot; One of the things about getting Permission is that enough people should know you. Your introductory post is still on the first page and is less than a week old. Take some time to get to know your surroundings, and get to know everyone in this community so that they can know a bit about you. <br><br>Thirdly, onto Agent Cyan. Having played Terraria myself, I know that you can name your character&#39;s just about whatever you want, so Cyan is a fine enough name, likewise the lack of surname is no problem to me. The rest of the Basic Stuff is also OK as far as I can see. Now, the first sentence of the appearance is mostly fine, the only details I would add in, are things like length of hair, facial hair, any scars, stuff like that, otherwise that&#39;s OK. <br>Whilst the rest of his appearance is nice to know, I shouldn&#39;t have flick back to the Terraria Wiki every time you mention anew item to double check what it looks like. Whilst you may know what it looks like, not everyone does and &quot;Go and look at the Terraria Wiki&quot; is not the best response. Instead I would describe each item briefly, for example &quot;The Flurry boots are a pair of dark blue boots with little wings at the back, they help Cyan run faster.&quot; or &quot;The Night Vision Helmet is a grey and blue helmet that has small green visor over the wearers eyes that, obviously, helps them see in the dark.&quot;. <br>You could do the same with the Vortex Armor, briefly describing either the entire set, or each piece so people know what it looks like, and you can even say a bit about what it does (for those who don&#39;t know, Vortex Armor is one of the best sets of armour in Terraria, with a rather large amount of bonuses attached to it, including the ability to turn invisible and a massive bonus to ranged damage, which when combined with Phantasm, which I will talk about in a second, would potentially make Agent Cyan able to  go toe to toe with most Sues at range). As I said in the brackets, Phantasm, I would of personally put it in its own little subcategory called &quot;Weapons&quot; and then, like everything else from Terraria described it a bit more, so something like &quot;Phantasm is a mystical, grey-coloured bow with blue crystals poking out of it. It has the ability to fire fours arrows for every arrow the user loads into it. In addition every time an arrow from Phantasm hits a target an additional barrage of arrows is fired from Phantasm for no cost.&quot; <br><br>Now, just from what I&#39;ve talked about above, I want to make an extra point here. To most people, the way you&#39;ve described Cyan&#39;s appearance makes it sound like whilst he is on missions he swaps his Flurry Boots and Night Vision Helmet out for the corresponding bits of Vortex Armour, whilst this is true for the Night Vision Helmet, Flurry Boots, are what is called an accessory in Terraria, this means that they are worn alongside the Armour, which when combined with everything else makes Cyan rather OP even when compared to some of the ex-Sue Agents (and hell even some Sues). <br><br>For almost the rest of the Permission request I&#39;m simply going to say I agree with Granz, because a) I agree with him b) he posted here first and I don&#39;t feel like copying and c) he&#39;s put it better than I ever would.<br><br>There is, however, one more point I would like to look at, that being Cyan&#39;s History. His history sounds more like something to come out of Starbound than Terraria, and whilst in some ways they are similar, Starbound is its own Continuum with its own story etc. So, having checked all the patch notes etc, I can&#39;t work out how a) Cyan helped build/built the rocket, there&#39;s nothing in the current game that suggest such a thing is even possible and b) where the other Terrarians came from, unless you mean the Town NPC&#39;s, although it doesn&#39;t make sense for some of them to be on a rocket. Whilst yes it is possible to get into &#39;space&#39; in Terraria, it is much more like the space near the planet than anything else (you can  also breathe in that space, who knew?). Also we don&#39;t know where the Vortexians come from, given they seem to appear with the Moon Lord (implying they potentially come from Terraria&#39;s moon), but we don&#39;t know so the planet idea may be correct.<br><br>Anyway, what I&#39;m trying to say with regard to the above paragraph is that, whilst it can be hard to come up with ways to get your Agent from their Home Continuum to the PPC HQ, they&#39;ve also got to be believable, and in some ways recognizable from the canon viewpoint too. For example if I wanted to get a Terraria Character to the PPC I would say that during a fight with the Moon Lord (Imagine Cthulu&#39;s brother, non-Terraria people) my character accidentally fell through a portal left by the death of a Vortexian, and ended up in the PPC HQ... for example.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br>Who hopes this helps, and is terribly sorry for any SPaG problems in the above post. <br><br>P.S I would recommend looking at the Permission article on the PPC wiki and doing the Permission Self Check that is linked there. <br>P.P.S One handy link: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission</a></a></p>

            <p>the Marquis de Sod will probably turn down your job application for multiple reasons, but that is not for me to decide.

            <p>but, you don&#39;t think you want to spend a wee bit more time developing the fellow? <br><br>I have a few problems, here, if you&#39;d like to hear them. <br><br>The personality needs some development. I mean, take a look at what we can acquire, here. <br>Enthusiastic, outgoing, non-specifically imaginative (<i>everybody</i> comes up with new ideas to terminate Sues and Stus as they go,) and disliking a long series of things <i>everyone</i> dislikes (except for things larger than them. I&#39;m, personally, fine with those sorts of entities.)<br>A great bit of advice I heard from someone somewhere about characterisation is: can you imagine what he&#39;s doing on his time off? What he&#39;s doing outside the stories? <br>The more clear the image you have, the better characterised it probably is. <br>You could also afford to be more specific with things. Why does he like what he likes? Why does he dislike what he dislikes? Why does he bother to be imaginative, or outgoing? Why does he feel so much responsibility for fixing canons? Why did he join the PPC? <br><br>In addition, his history and personality don&#39;t really seem to jibe, and, if they do, you haven&#39;t given enough explanation for how. <br>When I am presented with the concept of a person who has been trapped on an escape pod alone for five years, with nothing else to go on but my own assumptions, I immediately assume this person:<br>- Wants to go home. <br>- Is not remotely socially well-adjusted. <br>- Doesn&#39;t care about the state of <i>any</i> canons. <br>- Will probably not be looking for any job prospects. <br>You know what I mean? <br><br>I&#39;ve not gone into the prompts, or anything like that, though, I could probably find some time to take a look if you&#39;d like. <br>Anyway, those&#39;re my permission giver-less thoughts. <br>Good luck with the permission and agents and whatnot!</p>

            <p>is that you&#39;re not quite ready. Now, I&#39;m no PG, but I&#39;ll tell you what I think. <br><br>In terms of just general advise, first, you&#39;re rather new. It&#39;s been less than a week since you&#39;ve introduced yourself, and we&#39;d like to be sure you&#39;re not gonna go poof, and just get to know you, see what you&#39;re like.<br><br>Second, get a beta. I&#39;ve got three lined up, even if I&#39;ve only really worked in-depth with one, and trust me, they&#39;re a gift from God, Allah, [Insert appropriate name of higher power here], or random chance, whatever you believe or don&#39;t believe in. They&#39;re incredibly helpful, and not just for SPaG. They help you with characterization, plot, and, well, just about everything!  I know that my prompts and bios would be ten times worse without Larfen around.<br><br>Now, on to your pieces. Let&#39;s start with length of the pieces, since that&#39;s really what stood out to me at first glance. The longer one is only 247 words, and the shorter one is only 198. Honestly, they&#39;re too short for me to really get a feel for Cyan or your writing style. I&#39;d make them longer, especially since not only do they feel short, when you look at them, the length makes them see a little hasty.<br><br>Talking about Cyan, I know nothing about Terraria, so I won&#39;t comment on the name, and if he&#39;s supposed to be human, the description&#39;s alright, though wearing the exact same outfit every day might get a little weird if you don&#39;t give a reason. Also, why does he wear armor? It seems like something he wouldn&#39;t really need, given that most of the time, direct combat with Sues is at least a Bad Idea, if not a Very Bad Idea. <br><br>Now, as for personality, he seems like he&#39;s the kind of person who gets lost in his head sometimes. Is that on purpose? If it&#39;s not, consider the kind of impression you give of your characters with your words. However, other than that and his likes and dislikes, I can&#39;t really get much of him from this. Surely there&#39;s a bit more you know about him you&#39;d like to tell us. Additionally, just because it&#39;s in the same area, the flow would probably be improved if you changed &#39;goes. Usually&#39; to &#39;goes, usually&#39;.<br><br>I don&#39;t have much to say about his powers. Hammerspace seems like it could be used for comedic effect, and half the agents pick up bags or something that work just like it anyways. For an example, see Valon Vance&#39;s vest. I would like to know what he can do with his mana, or just what kind of spells Terraria has in general, but that&#39;s not too important. The biggest problem is his knowledge. I don&#39;t quite know how living in a video game would give him knowledge of its mechanic. To make a comparison, before the PPC, most D&amp;D agents wouldn&#39;t know about things like skill points, unless they&#39;re from OotS, and they certainly wouldn&#39;t know, say, Costume Fairies, which I believe Data started a RP for.<br><br>As for his history, as I said, I don&#39;t know anything about Terraria, so I wouldn&#39;t be able to comment on how the space measures up, but I would like to know why his pod didn&#39;t return to the planet. Even saying something as simple as &#39;There was a malfunction in the pod&#39;s guidance system, so instead of returning to Terraria like it was supposed to, it ended up randomly drifting off into space,&#39; could improve it vastly. Speaking of space, how did he survive? How long was he up there? A week? A year? Details, details. They&#39;re very important. <br><br>I&#39;m also a little unsure how he managed to pass through so many plotholes with so great an interval between them. I&#39;d understand if he only passed through one, and showed up in, say, <i>Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</i>, and maybe got shoved through another plothole to another continuum before finally arriving in the PPC, or if he fell through several plotholes in quick succession, but the way it&#39;s presented doesn&#39;t quite make sense. Furthermore, does he interact with canons, or just wander around the worlds? Maybe use the word &#39;continuum&#39; so that we can tell whether you&#39;re talking about characters or series. Also, if it&#39;s the second, why? Why not just set him loose to wander the wide, wide world of the continuum? Logically, he probably wouldn&#39;t even find them, especially in a continuum with many continents, dimensions, planets, etc., and without easy means of getting between the multiple continents, dimensions, planets, etc. <br><br>Now, I think the bit about Mary Sues is interesting. Personally, I think it&#39;d be really cool if, say, a Mary Sue randomly showed up and started using his new friends as bit characters to be disposed of once she got to the canons, and he got angry at her warping their minds and told her to stop, and one thing leads to another and she&#39;s dead by his hands, and a pair of very confused PPC agents are now wondering why their Sue is dead, but the Words don&#39;t dictate it and they didn&#39;t kill her. Oh, and a minor thing, I believe you meant in, rather than on, as nobody&#39;s really sure what the outside of HQ looks like, even Xericka.<br><br>Now, something I&#39;m wondering about is why you decided only to use one agent. Two is the norm, because it&#39;s very useful. Partners do things like restrain each other, express the full range of reasons that PPCers get mad at badfic without being inserts, which are, of course, not always bad, and help provide some interaction between characters to make things more interesting. This isn&#39;t to say that one isn&#39;t possible, but think long and hard about it before you decide on it.<br><br>So, since we&#39;ve gotten through your agent, let&#39;s address your first prompt. In the second sentence, I believe you meant jobs instead of job, since they all do different jobs, but otherwise, I like the opening. However, I don&#39;t know why Cyan is being sent into a mission without any training. Do the Flowers occasionally randomly drop somebody who literally has no experience whatsoever into a badfic? Yes. Do they drop teams into badfic without making sure that at least one of them knows the continuum in question, and at least one has some experience? No. They&#39;re understaffed, and so while they have a tendency to overwork their agents, they do try to make sure that they&#39;ll survive their first mission, and do it properly. Even if he doesn&#39;t have an official partner, you could draft, say, Luxury into your mission, and have her show him the ropes. Of course, she&#39;ll try to do it in more ways than one, but maybe he&#39;d enjoy that.<br><br>In terms of description, I&#39;d say it&#39;s fine, though you might want to spread it out a little, but I&#39;d say that&#39;s relatively low priority and probably based on opinion. However, I did notice here that you switched between past and present tense, then back again, but it&#39;s not too jarring. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure how he knows that Wednesday is the day the Cafeteria serves real food, since he&#39;s only been there for one day. Perhaps he has had some training?<br><br>Uh oh. We&#39;ve got a bit of a spacial distortion here. How does he hear his Console from all the way in the Cafeteria? His RC should be x units of distance away from the Cafeteria, whereas x is proportional to the amount of attention somebody walking from the Cafeteria to that particular RC is paying to getting where they&#39;re going. And again, wasn&#39;t he just in the Cafeteria? Oh, and while I&#39;m thinking about it, you forgot to capitalize &#39;Cafeteria&#39; in your second paragraph. Anyways, he&#39;s supposed to be in the Cafeteria, not his RC. Perhaps you meant that he was just getting ready to leave for the Cafeteria from his RC?<br><br>You spend a little too little time describing his preparations, I think, especially since how somebody gets ready for something can tell you something about them, and since we don&#39;t really know Cyan, this is a good place to give us some indirect characterization.<br><br>The banana peel... honestly, it kind of falls flat. It&#39;s a little too matter-of-fact, not quite absurd enough, and, well, cliché. Additionally, agents actually have to set up the portals, and describing them doing so is important, because it means that they&#39;re moving from place to place, not just teleporting for... some reason.<br><br>Get the advice of somebody who knows mountains for this. I couldn&#39;t tell you anything about this, either, but I do think it only taking a few minutes to fall down a mountains is a tad unrealistic. A hill, yes, but a mountain, no.<br><br>Hmm... not necessarily a bad ending, though, again, maybe talk about him getting up and dusting himself off? I&#39;d say the weakest part of this is that you spend too little time on describing events, so it&#39;s almost like an audiobook CD that keeps skipping forwards ten seconds and leaving you wondering what just happened.<br><br>Okay, so on to the second prompt. The first paragraph appears to be setting up something dramatic, and so seems a little short, but it&#39;s not too bad. The last sentence feels a little redundant, but it could certainly be worse.<br><br>Here, I actually kind of laughed. That is pretty funny, though I&#39;m not quite sure why Cyan&#39;s talking to the replacement in the first place. Additionally, it&#39;s an important step on the road to characterization. Dialogue is important, dear... uh... Okay, I admit it, I don&#39;t actually know what your name means, so I&#39;ll just say dear newbie.<br><br><i>My Immortal</i>, huh? That&#39;s ambitious of you, and while ambition&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing, maybe try one or two regular missions before you tackle something that horrendous? We&#39;d hate to lose somebody to actual insanity, you see.<br><br>I&#39;m not quite sure how the RA malfunctioning leads to &quot;Tom&quot; getting into HQ. Note: I&#39;m not mocking your use of the name Tom. I&#39;m mocking the fact that this replacement dares to try and make one associate it with Lord Voldemort.<br><br>Wait, who? Who&#39;s this Redigit? Why does Cyan expect him? Is he an agent? A Mini? A banana? Come on, give us some clues! Oh, and consider having &quot;Tom&quot; at least snarl in reply, or something. Surely he&#39;s got something to say in response to Cyan&#39;s comment.<br><br>Hours? Um... I&#39;m not sure either character would really be able to run for hours, unless you&#39;re meaning to imply that it was only really a couple minutes, but HQ&#39;s messing with his sense of time.<br><br>The chase music thing might be funny. Does his music player play situationally appropriate music all the time? Or just when he really, really needs it to shut up?<br><br>Here, we&#39;ve- oh, wait, we have a switch from past to present tense. Again, problem, but easily fixed, just change a few verbs. But, as I was saying, there&#39;s this thing about beelines and HQ. They don&#39;t mix. The harder you try to get somewhere in HQ, the more it will twist and turn to keep you from getting where. The best was of getting anywhere is usually to sing, dance, or determinedly not think about pink elephants. Note: That last one is only useful if you&#39;re not actually trying to find pink elephants, and/or the IO isn&#39;t listening to your brain.<br><br>It&#39;s just the Mini Adoption Center, actually, and while dumping a character in there and letting all the minis shred them might be a good idea, I get the feeling the people inside the place would get rather annoyed at your for doing that.<br><br>Shouldn&#39;t he know that LV&#39;s not arachnophobic? After all, he is supposed to have read the books, and that... thing... that was recently published, so that he can properly note all the charges in the fic. Oh, and where&#39;s your dialogue tags? You might want to at least use one.<br><br>Again, a lack of description here really puts a dent in my enjoyment of this. Details, details, details! You could get three or four paragraphs at least out of that, and make them absolutely hysterical. And, last new thing, agents are supposed to stay and make sure the characters die, so that they don&#39;t, say, pop back at an inconvenient moment later in the fic and do something horrible to the agents, and so that the Flowers don&#39;t yell at them.<br><br>In conclusion, I&#39;d say that before you do anything else, you should work on adding more descriptions about actions and the environment, and get a beta. If you do those two things, I&#39;d say that the problems I have will vanish, just like ninjas who use smoke bombs. Oh, and I know I said that I wouldn&#39;t add anything new, but I must ask, what RC number do you intend to use?</p>

            <p>So yeah, remember those little things called the Zodiac Signs? Some believe in them, some find them unnecessary... well, turns out the configuration we&#39;ve known has been out-of-date for a while.<br><br>NASA considers remaking the dates and months corresponding to the Zodiac. Apparently because of the significant changes in the Solar System, the astrological charts created by Ancient Greeks/Egyptians/Sumerians/Whoever-started-it to assign the Zodiac Signs are no longer relevant.<br><br>This is apparently how the New Zodiac goes:<br><br>Capricorn: January 20 - February 16<br>Aquarius: February 17 - March 11<br>Pisces: March 11 - April 18<br>Aries: April 19 - May 13<br>Taurus: May 14 - June 21<br>Gemini: June 21 - July 20<br>Cancer: July 21 - August 10<br>Leo: August 10 - September 16<br>Virgo: September 17 - October 30<br>Libra: October 30 - November 23<br>Scorpio: November 23 - November 29<br>Ophiucus (Serpentarius): November 29 - December 17<br>Sagittarius: December 18 - January 20<br><br>So... any changes for you? Not for me. Once a Pisces always a Pisces :D</p>

            <p>So there used to be - might still be? - an alarming habit among people who purportedly believed in astrology of tweaking people&#39;s birth-dates and -times to give them more favorable charts. This also applied when choosing a &#39;birthdate&#39; for people you don&#39;t actually know it for.<br><br>Well, as it happens, I don&#39;t know precisely when the PPC was founded. But I do know that its chart should absolutely feature Uranus in the 7th house (ie, that it&#39;s a group built around partnership), which will form a trine with the sun in the 11th house (ie, that the whole core of the setting is friendship). So when do we have to have been &#39;born&#39; for that to happen?<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPCRetrostrology.png"><br><br>June 15th, 2002! (That&#39;s a little late for the actual founding of the PPC, so maybe it&#39;s the date of our reappearance after Harpwire was deleted. Or it could be the founding of the Board!)<br><br>And what an auspicious natal chart we <s>fake</s> get. The combination I mentioned exists (obviously), but we also have Uranus forming a square (stressful!) with Mercury in the 10th house. That means the whole partnership thing is stressed by the agents&#39; love of canon - that is, missions are a strain! Uranus is also in opposition to the moon, over in the 1st house - that means an emotional centre is reinforcing the whole partnership scheme.<br><br>Nor is that the only interaction of the moon. The emotional heart of the PPC is in a sextile with Saturn in the 11th house - yes, those emotions are drawn from and feeding into a combination that literally comes out as &#39;working friendships&#39; - an excellent description of the PPC! Saturn is opposed by Pluto in the 4th house, which can be described as &#39;change at home&#39; - certainly something that happens to our agents!<br><br>Elsewhere, Mercury&#39;s love of canon sits in a sextile with a curious factor: Venus in the 12th house, suggesting the self-negation of love. Can there be any better description of a Mary-Sue? We all know that encountering a Suvian only strengthens our love for canon.<br><br>All in all, this chart paints a picture of canon-loving agents, close friends with their partners but stressed out, fighting against Suvians and an unusual, transformative home. Moreover, it tells us that we all absolutely love it.<br><hr>
<br>And <i>that</i> is why astrology is such a nifty gimmick. If you know the person (or organisation!) you&#39;re writing about, you can pretty much turn anything into an accurate horoscope for them. Like Tarot, runes, and whatever that thing&#39;s called where you throw crystals around and look for patterns, you get out whatever you choose to put in.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/RevisedHoroscope.png"><br><br>Traditional signs in the inner ring, accurate ones in the outer.<br><hr>
<br>Okay, simple rundown of astrology as I understand it:<br><br>-The dial is split into the various zodiac signs. It&#39;s also split into 12 Houses, starting at the 9 o&#39;clock position on the dial and counting anticlockwise.<br>-Which house a planet is in determines what it affects. Which <i>sign</i> a planet is in affects how strong it is (basically).<br>-The angles between planets (around the centre of the circle) can intensify their effects.<br><br>The houses and angles won&#39;t change between my traditional and IAU-approved charts; the signs will, which Could Be Critical! Let&#39;s take a look.<br><br>The sun is in the fourth house. It forms a sextile (60 degree angle) with Mars, and is in conjunction with Venus. Exciting! A Sun-Venus conjunction is favourable! Now the fourth house is the house of Home and Family, so that means I&#39;ll have a good home-life, with strong influences from myself (the Sun represents the self, basically) and... well Venus is harmony, comfort, and romance. So yeah, happy marriage. ;)<br><br>The sextile with Mars indicates that both the sun and Venus will have easy communication with that planet, which represents confidence, ambition, strength (and also sexuality, oh stars my horoscope wants to be porn!). Mars is poking about in the second house, the house of Value (yes, as in money). So either my job will help with a happy marriage, or Mars wants me to sell nude pictures. No, Mars. There shall be none of that.<br><br>So that&#39;s all fixed. Coming now to the signs, we find that the Sun and Venus have moved from Capricorn to Sagittarius, while Mars has moved from Scorpio to Libra. Oh dear, poor Mars! It has moved from dignity to detriment - its strength is reduced by moving from a sign it rules to a sign it&#39;s opposed to. Haha, Mars, there shall be no porn for you. I should also highlight that the planets of self and love have moved from the sign of cautious action to the sign of enthusiastic flexibility, while the planet of strength has moved from inflexible empathy (???) to dynamic communication. So, uh, now I&#39;m in PR?<br><br>Okay, moving on. How many planets are left? ... seven? Good grief. Okay.<br><br>Let&#39;s go from the sun to the moon. The Moon is in the seventh house, the house of Partnerships - yes, we&#39;re sticking with the marriage theme! It forms a square with Pluto (in Home and Family), and a trine with Uranus (in the third house, Communication).  Okay! So, the Moon is my emotions, and is saying they&#39;ll be key in how I interact with people. Pluto is transformative, and the square means there&#39;s stress between my emotional interactions with others, and my... need to change at home, I think? Meanwhile, Uranus - the planet of genius - says I&#39;m good at talking to people, particularly in my childhood and other small-scale stuff. Um, Uranus, you are a lying liar. Oh, and the trine with the moon means that my easy friendships will be a source of artistic talent.<br><br>How about the signs? The moon has slipped from Aries to Pisces, Pluto from Capricorn to Sagittarius, and Uranus from Sagittarius to - oh yes, it&#39;s there - Ophiuchus. All of which means... absolutely nothing regarding rulership, as far as I can tell. It does mean that my emotions have gone from enthusiastic action to emotional adaptability, which is... probably good? Frankly, I think the moon is just talking gibberish at me; it hasn&#39;t said anything that makes sense. Unlike Mars, which at least had a plan going in.<br><br>Speaking of Pluto, it&#39;s in a sextile with Mars - yes, the porn Mars. So I think that means they&#39;re ganging up on me. Mars says &#39;make money from sexuality&#39;, Pluto says &#39;you need a change at home&#39; - yep, I&#39;m being bullied by my horoscope.<br><br>What else is significant in here? Ooh, Neptune is in a sextile with Mercury, that looks like fun! So Neptune says my Home and Family life (yeah, my sign is heavily interpersonally-loaded) is going to be harmonius and prosperous, and possibly socialist, and that there&#39;s harmony between that and the fact that I value (second house) education/rationality (Mercury). I&#39;m Huinesoron and I approve this message. ^_^<br><br>Sign-wise, Neptune makes the now-familiar jump from Capricorn to Sagittarius, with no obvious consequences (I&#39;m now resourceful in my socialism, though!), while Mercury skips over Libra entirely and jumps from Scorpio to Virgo. Ooh, Mercury is the ruler of Virgo! That means my valuing education is intensified, and I&#39;m going to become a scientist. WHO KNEW.<br><br>One more sextile, between Jupiter and Uranus. We know Uranus thinks I&#39;m a genius at communication; Jupiter is perched in the fifth house, the House of Pleasure (oh stars, tell me it hasn&#39;t been chatting to Mars!). Jupiter is also partly the <b>planet</b> of pleasure, but also of exploration and the law. I... think that all comes together to mean I&#39;m going to be really good at talking to my children and helping them expand their horizons? Maybe? But with Jupiter crossing from its rule of Pisces to - oh no! - its fall in Capricorn, apparently not <i>that</i> good.<br><br>There&#39;s more that could be said; I haven&#39;t even mentioned Saturn, which is hanging out with Uranus in the Third House telling me I&#39;m super-productive when chatting to people. But I think we&#39;ve seen enough to draw some conclusions:<br><br>-My horoscope super wants me to have a family.<br>-The shift in signs means I&#39;m going to be a bad dad now.<br>-Mars and Pluto want me to get into porn.<br><br>That was fun!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>From our perspective, Ophiuchus does intersect the ecliptic. The path of the sun does pass through it.<br><br>The whole calendar listed looks like it&#39;s the actual (according to modern IAU borders and definitions) zodiacal calendar; you&#39;ll note it perfectly matches <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac#Table_of_dates">the wikipedia list</a>, and poor Scorpio only shows up for seven days. This has pretty much always been the case, modulo the rate of change in earth&#39;s orbit; the nice round twelve-equal-chunks-of-time zodiac systems, both tropical and sidereal, were never accurate to the heavens. The tropical zodiac isn&#39;t even close, it&#39;s drifted by a month thanks to silly calendar definitions.<br><br>I/m pretty sure that NASA doesn&#39;t have any control over astrology, though.

            <p>So first of all, I&#39;m looking for one or two people who would be willing to look over my Prelude for my PPC agents before I post it.<br><br>Secondly, I&#39;m currently planning on writing a few fanfics in the next year or so, and thought whilst I was asking for beta&#39;s for the PPC thing above I&#39;d ask for people who would be willing to beta a fanfic in one of the following Continuum&#39;s:<br>Elder Scrolls (Skyrim)<br>Star Wars: The Old Republic<br>Dragon Age (all three games though starting with Origins)<br>Pokemon Ranger: Shadows of Almia (Pokemon would probably be enough, but knowledge of the Pokemon Ranger games would be appreciated)<br><br><br>If you&#39;re interested in beta-ing my PPC Prelude, or if you want to learn more about the fanfics (and when the time comes beta them) let me know. <br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>I would be *delighted* to beta some SWTOR fanfic, though I will note that I haven&#39;t yet completed all the plotlines. I&#39;d be most helpful if it&#39;s to do with the Inquisitor, the Warrior, or KotFE.

            <p>The SWTOR fic is probably going to be the most complicated of the fics I&#39;ve got planned as I&#39;m going to try and tie several of the characters more closely together, so that the story lines intersect more, and maybe add in a couple of extra bits that allow interactions and stuff. The main characters in this are probably going to be the Smuggler and the Bounty Hunter, with the Knight, Inquisitor, Agent and Trooper taking on more minor roles, I&#39;m not quite sure where to put the Consular or Warrior as I haven&#39;t got beyond the Prologue with those two classes, and hadn&#39;t even started them when I planned the fic originally. <br><br>I&#39;ll let you know when I start the fic, although I&#39;ve got the prologue itself about halfway done and lying around on my hard drive somewhere.<br><br></p>

            <p>Okay, now I know what the earmuffs are for, at least until I have practised a lot more.<br>As for fandoms, there are quite  few. Reelatively high on my list are probably Harry Potter, PJO and HoO, Discworld, and the Mirrorworld cycle by Cornelia Funke. I do like LotR, although it&#39;s been far too long (let&#39;s see... woah, must&#39;ve been around ten tears already *grins in embarrassment*) since I&#39;ve really reread more than just a couple chapters at a time.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll try to start at the beginning: I&#39;m currently doing what could be called a &#39;volunteer-year&#39; (except it&#39;s actually 15 months) in EMS.<br>Then, about a week ago I stumbled accross the awesome webcomic Rain, where I saw a user named Haldo in the comment section. His name reminded of a drug called Haldol, and I pretty much thought, &#39;Hm, using medications as an inspiration for names <i>does</i> sound like an interesting idea.&#39; And so I ended up with Akrinor, a drug used to treat a low blood pressure.</p>

            <p>My partner did me the inestimable favor of introducing me to the site a few months ago, and it&#39;s a favor I&#39;ll have to work at repaying, &#39;cause after recently taking a glance at the board (call it lurking, if you will) most everyone here seems brilliant.

Thanks for the recs!<br><br>My fandoms are legion, for they are many, but a good representative sample&#39;d probably include Doctor Who, Stargate (SG-1 and Atlantis, &#39;cause who cares about Universe?), Sherlock (in his multifarious forms, both Benedict and Brett), the Monstrumologist series, the Riordanverse, Ranger&#39;s Apprentice, and anything related to the Pirates of the Caribbean series.</p>

            <p>Ilraen and Farilan meet in DoSAT and things spiral out of control. Ilraen/Farilan/[spoilers]<br><br><hr>
<br>Nume had sent Ilraen to DoSAT for a new CAD because they&#39;d broken their last one recently and Nume didn&#39;t feel like going anywhere. When he god there, he noticed Farillan, who was trying to reassemble something. &lt;Um ... hi&gt;, Ilraen said hesidantly<br><br>Farilan turned some of her eyes, which had been focused on her work, towards Ilraen, surprised. &lt;Hello.&gt;, she said &lt;What are you doing here?&gt;<br><br>&lt;Ah ... my partner needed a replacement CAD. He sent me to get one.&gt;<br><br>&lt;How fortunate, I have almost repaired this one.&gt;<br><br>&lt;I think he specified a new CAD, and not any of the &quot;junk ones that are held together with duct tape&quot;. My partner is ... rather demanding.&gt;<br><br>&lt;Humans.&gt;, Farillan grumbled. While she was wandering over to get a new CAD from the bin, she asked &lt;How is your repair project going?&gt;<br><br>&lt;Poorly, I&#39;m afraid. I was hoping that you could give me some pointers.&gt;<br><br>&lt;Of course.&gt;<br><br>Farilan looked at Ilraen. Really looked. And she realized he was a very handsome Andalite. She was taken aback for a moment, and then added: &lt;I could also give you some pointers about <em>other</em> things, as well.&gt;<br><br>&lt;If you are referring to what I think you are, then I would certainly appreciate those pointers. I haven&#39;t had much opportunity to learn about such things.&gt;<br><br>&lt;I&#39;ve found that, in such matters, a practical approach is best.&gt; After Farilan said this, she strode over to Ilraen and jumped his bones. They started having a <em>really</em> good time on a lab bench. Makes-Things wouldn&#39;t mind, they figured, since the place was already a big mess.<br><br>While they were banging in a surprisingly empty lab, Amris floated in. He hadn&#39;t been looking for DoSAT, he&#39;d just stumbled in. He noticed the two Andalites and could feel their minds slamming into each other just as their bodies were. He asked &quot;Are you telepaths? Because if you are, I&#39;d like to join in.&quot; Internally, he thought &quot;It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve gotten laid. There&#39;s not much around here I can hook up with, except maybe the Flowers, who are total prudes. Big let down.&quot;<br><br>&lt;Uh ... Sure&gt;, both of the Andalites replied, with a slight echo. Ilraen added &lt;but I&#39;m not sure how that would work. You don&#39;t seem to have, er, well ...&gt;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not a problem,&quot; Amris replied. &quot;Drone sex is a meeting of the minds, after all.&quot;<br><br>Having said this, Amris joined Ilraen and Farilan in relieving some tension.<br><br>(A/N: I&#39;m not good at sex scenes, so I wrote around those. Also, Ilraen and Farilan are such a cute couple!!! Amris is here because it felt too short lol)<br><br>(( OOC: I am aware that some elements of this might contradict Culture canon. I don&#39;t care. This is the badfic games, after all. ))<br></p>

            <p>Chapter One<br>Somewhere in Personnel...<br>&quot;I still say getting booted to Personnel was unfair,&quot; ex-Agent Kara grumbled from behind a stack of paperwork. &quot;I was trying to help!&quot;<br><br>&quot;By burying both of your coworkers, several interns, Agent Cooper, Agent Jack, and Luxury in hot sand up to their necks?&quot; asked Quen. The secretary didn&#39;t do punishment detail, which was why the Marquis had called it &quot;training a new hire and undersecretary.&quot;<br><br>Kara finished two files and shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s supposed to be good for your circulation and pores. I did everything right, too. I passed out flyers, I got consent from everyone, I had Mittens and the RMC warn people about my powers so no one would scream, I made <i>sure</i> I didn&#39;t overdo it--&quot;<br><br>&quot;I notice &#39;telling the Flowers&#39; doesn&#39;t appear in your list of precautions,&quot; the alien girl deadpanned.<br><br><i>Thud</i> went Kara&#39;s head onto her desk, scattering paperwork. &quot;Uuuuggggh. Mom was right. I never should&#39;ve left Sunagakure.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Someone would have killed you if you hadn&#39;t left.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m already dead. This is payment for my crimes.&quot; Kara picked her head back up and put the completed files in her outbox. &quot;Seriously, how many people work here, anyway? Counting the ones who don&#39;t go on missions?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You know, I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s ever done the math on that,&quot; said Quen thoughtfully. &quot;But no one&#39;s done the math on how many crewmen there are on the <i>Enterprise</i>, either.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The what?&quot; asked Kara, finishing three more files and picking up three more her headdesk had scattered.<br><br>Quen did a double-take. &quot;You...you&#39;ve never heard of the <i>Enterprise</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Should I have?&quot; said Kara.<br><br>&quot;Er...no...?&quot;<br><br>Kara shrugged again and passed the next week&#39;s cafeteria menus to the alien. &quot;So, no big deal.&quot;<br><br>The girls were silent for a minute before Kara spoke up again. &quot;There&#39;s one other thing I don&#39;t understand.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why did Luxury show up when I never invited her, and how come I didn&#39;t notice her until Cooper screamed? Is she a ninja too?&quot;<br><br>Now it was Quen&#39;s turn to headdesk. Repeatedly. <br><br>&quot;What? It&#39;s a fair assumption!&quot;<br><br><br>Author&#39;s note: Yay, comedy fic! Please review so I have a reason to write more about Kara&#39;s (not-) adventures!</p>

            <p>A/N: I was reading the PPC hunger games, and I was inspired to write a fic about Peregrin being badass and setting stuff on fire. Also, does anyone know a good beta?<br><br><hr>
<br>Agent Peregrin was on a mission with some pyros because he was better at making bombs than most of the department. He didn&#39;t transfer, though, because he thought DoGA were wimps. The world was twisted into brain-breaking shapes by an uncanonical forest. Peregrin couldn&#39;t stand it, so he charged in with his flamethrower. The other agents tried to hold him back, yelling &quot;We don&#39;t even have most of the charges!&quot;, but Peregrin didn&#39;t care. He just wanted to burn stuff.<br><br>Peregrin quickly finished the mission (by destroying everything in sight) and went back to his RC, #112358. He&#39;d never figured out where those numbers came from, or why there were commas and an ellipsis on the sign. He spent some time reading, and then took a short nap. He didn&#39;t need to work around his partner, since he didn&#39;t have one because he was just that good solo.<br><br>When he woke up, he decided to go to the Canon Library to get more reading material. He wandered the halls for a while and eventually stumbled on the library. The librarian didn&#39;t want to give him more books because the ones he had were &#39;overdue&#39;. After about a minute of these complaints, Peregrin flew into a rage and planted a small grenade on the checkout records. The Librarian managed to dodge, but the records (and a good part of the desk they were on) were destroyed. The explosion also started a fire, which burned down several shelves of books, but Peregrin didn&#39;t care. Those were replaceable anyway, right?<br><br>While Peregrin was storming out the library and venting about how he still hadn&#39;t managed to get his books, he remembered that his vacation request from two days ago hadn&#39;t gone through. He&#39;d put in for two weeks vacation after a particularly nasty (in his opinion) mission earlier in the week. So, instead of heading back to his RC, he tried to go to the Marquis&#39; office. Normally, the hallways in HQ would have prevented him from getting there quickly, but he used his powers (A/N: what were those again?) and sheer force of will to make it straight there.<br><br>After he&#39;d busted the door to Personnel down, the Marquis asked him, <em>Agent Peregrin, what are you doing here?</em><br><br>&quot;I want to know why you haven&#39;t approved my vacation paperwork yet,&quot; he answered with a cold fury.<br><br><em>I haven&#39;t approved your request because you had a vacation only a few months ago, and since you have given no justification for your current application</em><br><br>&quot;The hell I haven&#39;t justified my application! You and that damm sunflower have been throwing an EXTREMELY big workload on me, and that&#39;s on top of all the stuff I&#39;m doing with DoGA! I need a vacation NOW!.&quot;<br><br><em>Both Mary Sues and Geographical Aberrations are severely understaffed right now, so a heavy workload is to be expected.</em><br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t CARE!&quot; Peregrin&#39;s face was growing bright red with anger. &quot;I&#39;m taking. a. break.&quot;<br><br>Right then, Peregrin opened a portal to his home continuum. The Marquis tried to stop him and called security. Peregrin didn&#39;t want to be stopped, so he took his flamethrower and burned the Flower to a crisp.<br><br>As the daisy was dying, security stormed into the office. They didn&#39;t really like the Marquis, because he was maen and stupid, so they let Peregrin jump through the portal. (Later, they resurrected the Flower so no one would notice).<br><br>Two weeks later, Peregrin came back to his RC, noticeably calmer. He&#39;d spent most of the last two weeks rampaging through Arbe, sacking concents and burning their libraries (he was still bitter about the Canon Librarian). His console had several messages from the Sunflower Official, who wanted to meet with him about the &quot;incident&quot; in the Personnel offices two weeks earlier.<br><br>After making himself at home, Peregrin went Upstairs and had his meeting. The SO told him that he&#39;d thought about punishing Peregrin somehow, but that he had noticed that Peregrin was one of the better agents in the department, and so he could get away with a few incidents. He didn&#39;t even say a word about the DoGA mission. Then, the SO assigned him a partner, Tomash, so that they could learn about the ways of the PPC from an experienced agent. Peregrin was glad that the Flowers had seen reason about his need for a vacation, and he went back to his RC to meet up with his new partner, hoping that they were as awesome as he was.<br><br>(( OOC: I have driven Agent (ex-Fraa) Peregrin severely out of character. He would almost certainly never do any of these things without an extremely, extremely good reason. ))<br><br></p>

            <p>A/n: So, like, remember this from last time? It&#39;s my awesome story about the DIA and some other ppl and anyway i&#39;m reposting the third chapter (seriously, NO REVIEWS WERE HAD and that is sad--haha, a rhyme! :D :D)) Anyway, so the first chapter is <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=284725;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">HERE</a> and the second chapter is <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=284730;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">HERE!</a> And now the third chapter!!!<br><br>Oh, and, so yeah this story is uh I mean<br>I don&#39;t really have inspriation for it anywmore but i have this new friend and she&#39;s TOTALLY INTO TACITUS/GASPARD and the gardsman and everyone so she&#39;s going to take over and it&#39;s gonna be TOTALLY AWESOME! XD U&#39;ll love it. Don&#39;t worry.<br><br>But fiiiirst...here&#39;s chapter three!!! Compleat with my a/ns &#39;n&#39; everything :) :) :)<br><br>a/n SO I&#39;M SO EXCITED THAT YOU&#39;RE LIKING THIS STORY<br>Anyway<br>So I&#39;m starting off with a flashback because I was in such a hurry to get up the last chapter that Iforgot a detail<br>but that&#39;s fine because a recap at the beginning of a chapter is very useful!!<br>So without further ado read on<br>and Ihope you like it<br>(PS: here&#39;s where we meet Tacitus!! Really, this time!! Aaaah!!!)<br><br>-------<br>Of all times for the Guardsman to get injured.<br><br>An elegantly dressed geth walks out of Tacitus&#39; office. Every bit of its armor is in perfect condition; I am obviously underdressed.<br><br>&quot;<font size="2"><font>Golf, this week, Tacitus,</font></font>&quot; it says firmly. I don&#39;t hear the reply. The geth nods at me as it passes, and Alex jumps out of his seat to go call the elevator.<br><br>It leaves.<br><br>&quot;Mr. de Grasse?&quot; Charlie is back with her perfect smile and her long legs. &quot;Mr. Tacitus will see you now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh--thank you,&quot; I say. I put the glass down and get to my feet, straightening my shirt. Slowly, I walk towards the door. Charlie&#39;s smile follows me, stays fixed in perfect, professional falseness.<br><br>Alex opens the door for me. I try to smile at him, and then take a deep breath and walk through.<br><br>I&#39;m completely focused on not making a fool of myself: just get through this interview, go home, give the Guardsman his notes. I can do this.<br><br>So, of course, the very first thing I do in Tacitus&#39; office...is trip.<br><br>*<br><br><i>&quot;You utter klutz,&quot;</i> says my Monologue. He&#39;s utterly bored, and looking down at me where I&#39;ve landed on my hands and knees. <i>&quot;You can&#39;t even enter a room anymore. How...pitiful.&quot;</i><br><br>Gentle hands grasp my elbows and help me to stand. I can&#39;t bring myself to look up for a minute, but when I do--wow. Just wow. Red-tipped black hair and an intense look that makes me even more embarrassed--and he&#39;s young. He&#39;s so young.<br><br>He lets go of me and steps back. For a moment--I blink, thinking I&#39;m imagining it--but for a moment, he&#39;s some sort of grey and red fox as he leaps back to the desk. Suddenly, he&#39;s back to the beautiful young man who helped me up, and he grabs a pad of paper and a pen from the desk. He writes something and holds it out to me; I approach carefully and read the message.<br><br><i>That was quite a fall, Mr. Guardsman. Are you alright? Would you like to sit?</i><br><br>&quot;Oh, uh--I&#39;m alright,&quot; I say. Why can I never be smooth? I sound like I&#39;ve been hit in the head--dull and uninspired. &quot;And, actually, I&#39;m Gaspard. Gaspard de Grasse. The Guardsman&#39;s been injured, so I&#39;m here in his stead.&quot;<br><br><i>I&#39;m Tacitus Dives</i>, he writes back, and offers me his hand. I take it, and we shake; static electricity shocks me, and I pull away as casually as I can. It must be from my fall on the carpet.<br><br>We take our seats, and I set up the Guardsman&#39;s clunky-looking tape recorder. It doesn&#39;t run on tape, exactly--but he&#39;s upgraded it since the last time I asked. The on button seems to be in the same place, though.<br><br>&quot;I have some questions, Mr. Tacitus,&quot; I say once everything is in place.<br><br>He smirks, and writes, <i>I thought you might.</i><br><br>I find myself blushing red, and push my shoulders back to try to look less cowed. I raise the Guardsman&#39;s first cue card, and do my best to read his scribble--thankfully, most of these were typewritten. “You’re very young to have amassed such an empire. To what do you owe your success?” When I look up at him, he&#39;s disappointed but still smiling that wonderful smile.<br><br><i>Business is all about people, Mr. de Grasse, and I’m very good at judging people. I know how they tick, what makes them flourish, what doesn’t, what inspires them, and how to incentivize them. I employ an exceptional team, and I reward them well.</i> He stares at me, and then writes another set of sentences and hands them over. His handwriting is just this side of neat, spiky, dark, and precise. Nothing like my own boring letters. <i>My belief is to achieve success in any scheme one has to make oneself master of that scheme, know it inside and out, know every detail. I work hard, very hard to do that. I make decisions based on logic and facts. I have a natural gut instinct that can spot and nurture a good solid idea and good people. The bottom line is, it’s always down to good people.</i><br><br>“Maybe you’re just lucky,” I blurt out. He&#39;s arrogant. I don&#39;t usually like arrogant people.<br><br><i>I don’t subscribe to luck or chance, Mr. de Grasse.</i> he writes. <i>The harder I work the more luck I seem to have. It really is all about having the right people on your team and directing their<br>energies accordingly. I think it was Harvey Firestone who said ‘the growth and development of people is the highest calling of leadership.</i><br><br>“You sound like a control freak.” The words are out of my mouth before I can stop them.<br><br><br><i>Oh, I exercise control in all things, Mr. de Grasse,</i> he writes. His smile is humorless; he holds my stare impassively. I find that I&#39;m blushing again. Why does he have such an unnerving effect on me? His overwhelming good-looks maybe? The way his eyes blaze at me? The way he strokes his index finger against his lower lip? I wish he’d stop doing that. I look down at the Guardsman&#39;s next card; time to change the subject.<br><br>“You invest in manufacturing,&quot; I say. &quot;Why, specifically?” Why does he make me so uncomfortable?<br><br><i>I like to build things. I like to know how things work: what makes things tick, how to construct and deconstruct. And I have a love of ships. What can I say?</i> What can he write, really...why does he write all the time? The Guardsman never mentioned he was mute. No one does. And surely someone with his money could go around that...<br><br><br>But I stay on task. “That sounds like your heart talking rather than logic and facts.”<br><br><br>His mouth quirks up, and he stares appraisingly at me.<br><br><br><i>Possibly. Though there are people who’d say I don’t have a heart.</i><br><br><br>“Why would they say that?”<br><br><br><i>Because they know me well.” His lip curls in a wry smile.</i><br><br>“Do you have a philosophy? If so, what is it?”<br><br><i>I don’t have a philosophy as such.</i> he writes. <i>Maybe a guiding principle – Carnegie’s: ‘A man who acquires the ability to take full possession of his own mind may take possession of anything else to which he is justly entitled.’ I’m very singular, driven. I like control – of myself and those around me.</i><br><br>“So you want to possess things?” I try not to raise an eyebrow; he really is a control freak.<br><br><br><i>I want to deserve to possess them, but yes, bottom line, I do.</i><br><br><br>I can’t help thinking that we’re talking about something else, but I’m absolutely mystified as to what it is. I swallow hard. The temperature in the room is rising or maybe it’s just me. I just want this interview to be over. Surely this is enough material? I glance at the next question.<br><br><br>“You were adopted. How far do you think that’s shaped the way you are?” Oh, this is personal. I stare at him, hoping he’s not offended. His brow furrows.<br><br><i>I have no way of knowing.</i><br><br>My interest is piqued, but I don&#39;t ask him how old he was when he was adopted--I can always ask the Guardsman later. I read the next question. “Have you had to sacrifice a family life for your work?”<br><br><i>I have a family.</i> he writes. <i>I have a brother and a sister and two loving parents. I’m not interested in extending my family beyond that.</i><br><br>“Are you gay, Mr. Tacitus?”<br><br><i>Well...</i> He stops writing and looks at me with his smoldering eyes. <i>What do <u>you</u> think, Gaspard?</i><br><br>My breath catches in my throat as I try to stammer a reply. It&#39;s the first time he&#39;s used my name, and even though he isn&#39;t speaking out loud, there&#39;s something about seeing it in his handwriting that makes my heartbeat accelerate.<br><br>There’s a knock at the door, and Charlie enters. “Mr. Tacitus, forgive me for interrupting, but your next meeting is in two minutes.”<br><br>Tacitus nods at her. She blushes bright pink; at least it&#39;s not just me, thank God. He gets up, and she leaves.<br><br>I collect the cards and the Guardsman&#39;s recorder and get to my feet. “Thank you for meeting with me, Mr. Tacitus.”<br><br>He shakes my hand; I find myself hoping it&#39;s not as sweaty as my mind thinks it is.<br><br>If I am sweaty, he doesn&#39;t seem to notice. <i>Are you driving back?</i> he asks through the pad of paper. <i>It&#39;s raining.</i><br><br>&quot;Uh--yes. I&#39;m driving back.&quot;<br><br><i>Well, you’d better drive carefully.</i> he writes. He underlines it, and gives me a stern look. I wonder why he cares. <i>Did you get everything you need?</i> he adds.<br><br>“Yes sir,” I reply, packing the recorder into my satchel. His eyes narrow, speculatively.<br>“Thank you again for the interview, Mr. Tacitus.”<br><br><i>The pleasure’s been all mine,</i> he writes, polite as ever. He stands and holds out his hand. <i>Until we meet again, Mr. de Grasse.</i> And his expression makes it a challenge, or a threat, I’m not sure which. I frown. When will we ever meet again? I shake his hand once more, astounded that that odd current between us is still there. It must be my nerves.<br><br>“Mr. Tacitus.” I nod at him. Moving with lithe athletic grace to the door, he opens it wide.<br><br><i>Just ensuring you make it through the door, Miss Steele.</i> he writes, holding it up for me to see and giving me a small smile. Obviously, he’s referring to my earlier less-than-elegant entry into his office. I flush.<br><br><br>“That’s very considerate, Mr. Tacitus,” I snap, and his smile widens. I’m glad you find me entertaining, I glower inwardly, walking into the foyer. I’m surprised when he follows me out. Charlie and Alex both look up, equally surprised.<br><br>Alex rushes to bring my coat; Tacitus puts down his pen and pad of paper and takes it from him, holding it up for me to put on. I do so, feeling extremely self-conscious. Tacitus places his hands for a moment on my shoulders; I gasp at the contact. If he notices my reaction, he gives nothing away. His long index finger presses the button summoning the elevator, and we stand waiting – awkwardly on my part, coolly self-possessed on his. The doors open, and I hurry in desperate to escape. I really need to get out of here. When I turn to look at him, he’s leaning against the doorway beside the elevator with one hand on the wall. He really is very, very good-looking. It’s distracting. His burning teal eyes gaze at me.<br><br><i>Gaspard,</i> he writes as a farewell, holding up the ever-present pad of paper.<br><br>“Tacitus,” I reply, my mouth dry. And mercifully, the doors close.<br><br>--------<br><br>a/n:Whew! That was such a long chapter!! But Ireally hope you liked it!! Isn&#39;t Tacitus so hott?? Gaspard certainly thinks so!!<br><br>Don&#39;t forget to RnR!! Reviews make me write fasterrr. Next up--Gaspard and the Guardsman talk about what happened! And Tacitus may show up again ;)) Aaaaand...if you really want it....Imay even write something from Tacitus&#39; pov!! You&#39;ll have to convince me, though :D if there&#39;s enough interestm I&#39;ll totally do it!!!<br><br>Reviweres are love!!! ~*DW~~**<br><br>PS: DON&#39;T FORGET TO CHECK OUT MY NEW STORY! It&#39;s actually something I rwote really quickly last month but it&#39;s awesome and you should totally read it! I&#39;ll be putting it up really soon. Quick and fun and fluffy!! Look for it at the top of the new releases!! xoxo~~DW**~<br><br>REAL AN: so like hope you enjoyed!!! Next chappie will be written by my friend but posted by me because she doesn&#39;t want her own account cuz her parents said no. but shes a REALLY awesome writer and its&#39; gonna be SO GOOD I PROMISE<br><br>and maybe i&#39;ll write something new too.......you never know!!!<br><br>xoxoxoxo ~~~DW**~<br><br>((So yes. A necessary disclaimer--a good chunk of this chapter is from the real 50 Shades book, because last year I was foolish enough to go &#39;THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT DUSKWATER WOULD DO, JUST CHANGE THE NAMES AND SOME OF THE WORDING AND DESCRIPTIONS&#39;. Never again. The book--undiluted by sporkings and so on--is *awful*. The &#39;next writer&#39; is going to drop that idea entirely, and...well, I have some fun things planned :D We&#39;ll see how it goes.<br><br>In the meantime, welcome back to 50 Shades of Tacitus! I look forward to hopefully amusing y&#39;all and scarring SeaTurtle&#39;s characters :) Keep an eye out for familiar faces in...the next chapter, probably... ~DF))</p>

            <p>A/n: HI! I&#39;m taking over the story and i promise it&#39;s gonna be awesome. I&#39;m just taking over where DiskWater (hi babe!!) left off and I&#39;m gonna keep what she wrote of course but I&#39;m also putting my own twist on it!! Hope you like it!!!<br><br>Right, so this chapters in third person because it&#39;s different characters but keep am eye out for the end ;) don&#39;t worry there&#39;s lots of first person (aka or favorite pov characters!!!) coming up. This chapters different to set the scene but yeah just read to the end! Can&#39;t wait to write more!!! And of course……… Don&#39;t forget to review!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Chapter 4<br><br>The Guarddsman was lying down, trying to recover from his stomach wound. He had put the bloodstained cards away by now, and was vaguely thinking about getting the watch out...but nah. He kind of wanted a sandwich, and, well, tht was more important. So he got up and hobbled toward the kitchen.<br><br>He didn’t really feel bad that Gaspard had had to go interview Tacitus Dives in his stead, because, really, the lad could stand to get out a bit more. And anyway, the Guardsman hated dealing with Dives. They never had gotten along, and he always felt the young CEO was hiding something…<br><br>Anyway. Sandwich.<br><br>*********<br>In another part of HQ the Aviator was looking at her couch and frowning. It wasn’t like the couch had anything wrong with it; the real problem was that she wanted to sit down, but--and this was the important part--the couch was already taken. By her partner as his girlfriend.<br><br>They were cuddling (because Zeb was a cuddly sort and Dawn was very into cuddling) and it was really very cute (a/n THEYRE SO PERFECT TOGTHER IXIMAZ AND DAWNFIRE IF UR READING THIS <b>TAKE NOTES</b>) but the Aviator also really, really wanted to sit down…<br><br>She was about to say something, but then Zeb activated the disguise generator and turned into a human. He gave Dawn a slightly nervous smile; Dawn smiled back, and leaned in to kiss him.<br><br>The Aviator made a face and went into her TARDIS. She might as well; her eyes and mind would be saved, and there was the Gala to get ready for, after all…<br><br>*****<br>He really should call his sister, the Guardsman thought. She’d been bugging him about getting ready in time for the Gala that was coming up, asking who he was going to take along as a date. He’d been thinking maybe Naya; he didn’t like her like that, or anything, but it was a lot easier than figuring out who else he could go with. And besides, Naya was great. She was sarcastic, funny, and...well, he had no idea what she looked like, but that was fine. It’d work.<br><br>And maybe taking her would finally prompt his sister into making a movel…<br><br>~FLASHBACK~~<br><br>(okay so this is basically based on Cale Seche, because that should have gone <i>so differently</i> seriously. What were they <i>thinking</i>?! It would’ve been so much better like this!!))<br><br>The Reader scrambled to her feet when she felt a familiar presence approach her and Rina. Could it be—?<br><br>No. No, her brother was long gone. Her mind must be playing tricks on her.<br><br>And then three people rounded the corner and she froze.<br><br>“E-Emiranlanoamar?”<br><br>The tall black man stopped walking and blinked at her. “Xandria? The Reader--that’s you?”<br><br>The quarian beside him frowned, not that anyone could tell. “Who’s Xandria?”<br><br>“I am.” The Reader took a hesitant stepp forward, her eyes fixed on the Guardsman. “Emiran...I thought you were dead. Permanently so.”<br><br>“What about you?” The Guardsman waved the hand that wasn’t holding something. “You left the Academy and just vanished. Papa said you’d argued—”<br><br>“We did, but that’s not important.” The Reader took another step, beginning to tear up. “Emiran...Emiran, you’re alive.”<br><br>“And you didn’t call.” The Guardsman put his toolbox down with a thud and crossed his arms. “Why didn’t you call, Xandria?”<br><br>The Reader blinked at him, and wiped away a tear. “I was a little busy, Emiranlanoamar.”<br><br>The Guardsman gave her his best sad face. “I was lonely, Xandria. I had no one to talk to, and none of our other siblings were even still around except for Bibi, and you know what she’s like--all work, no fun—”<br><br>He was cut off by a hug from his sister: the first in centuries (or millennia, depending on the personal timestream). “Shut up, Emiran. Just shut up and hug me for once.”<br><br>Emiran blinked away his own tears and obeyed, hugging her tightly.<br><br>It&#39;s alright, he told her mind-to-mind. We&#39;re all safe now. It&#39;s going to be alright.<br><br>*****<br>They found out later that Bibi--the oldest, originally--had stayed on Gallifrey and might actually be dead. But everyone else had made it to HQ long before they did, and there were many reunions to attend. Of course, some of their siblins were a bit full of themselves, but they were always that way (except for the Notary) so Emiran and the Reader didn’t mind. The Reader was also the baby of the family, even before the Time War and everyone going traveling, so everyone was glad to see her. There were many hugs, some tears, and even the Notary clung to her fit a little while before she went back to bring herself--but everyone knew she cared.<br><br>END FLASHBAT!!<br><br><i>Esclava House, New Caledonia, at 08:13 on Friday the 13yh of September 2016 HST</i><br><br>Madam Penny had been in already to tell me that breakfast was served (and once more to say it was getting cold--she left in a hurry after I glared at her) but I couldn&#39;t stop pacing, couldn&#39;t get him out of my mind. That boy. Gaspard. <i>I wanted him. Bad.</i><br><br>I shook the thought away, but it came right back, the way it kept doing all night. I couldn&#39;t concentrate. It was going to drive me--<br><br>I shook my head again. <i>Think, Tacitus. Put your brilliant mind to use for once.</i> I had to see him again, but how to arrange it…<br><br><i>I need to see him. Need to see if I can find out what he looks like wrapped in a fancy silk robe--dark, maybe dark blue--and sitting on my bed. I need--</i><br><br>It hit me suddenly. The Gala! If I could get him to the gala I could see him. He&#39;d even be dressed up--<br><br>I smacked those thoughts away. How to get him to the Gala… there has to be a way. Had to be a way to get him there so I can impress him even more, and maybe get him where I&#39;ve been wanting him since about two seconds after he literally feel into my office.<br><br>I&#39;ll figure it out. I&#39;m not Tacitus Dives, heir to a fortune and self-made man of mystery for nothing.<br><br>Maybe my sister can help.<br><br>Maybe. Maybe she knows a connection that I don&#39;t.<br><br>I nodded: it&#39;s settled. I took out my portable console and sent s message directly to Harris my second in command. <i>Contact the PI (privatate investigator). Tell him to start looking into a Gaspard de Grasse. And get me an appointment with my sister.</i><br><br>Harris&#39; reply came almost immediately. He&#39;s a good assistant. Straight, and sometimes a bit unreliable and accident prone, but he&#39;s worth putting up with. <i>second bits going to be tough. are you sure you want to see her? last time didnt go will.</i><br><br>For a moment I went into my other form, so I could snarl soundlessly with greater effect. Then I changed back and wrote: <i>I&#39;m sue. Get it done, Harris! PS: you meant ‘well’, I&#39;m sure. This is why we need the new spell checker I&#39;ve got R&amp;D (research and development) working on right now: it&#39;ll catch more errors than anything else available. It&#39;ll make agents’ jobs easier!</i><br><br>He wrote back: <i>you dont need to sell me on it tacitus. im running the project. haha!</i><br><br>I shook my head and finally went to eat breakfast. That Harris. Maybe I should look for a replacement--someone who didn&#39;t disrespect me…<br><br>No. They&#39;d take too long to train, and Harris almost always followed through. It wasn&#39;t worth the energy it would take to replace him.<br><br>I looked down at my breakfast: bacon and eggs with a side of Sour Poffins. For a moment I was reminded of my ex--sweet creature, that one, my very first--but I shook the thought away and began to eat. I&#39;d need my strength--especially if Harris made the meeting with my sister for today.<br><br>Wouldn&#39;t that be a breeze.</p>

            <p>This is probably the best-spelled parody story about a human and a mute Zorua I&#39;ll ever read. Also, I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s ever typed that sentence before, so bonus points for that. XD <br><br>...Seriously, this is a parody, right? I mean, I&#39;m all for inclusivity and non-hetero relationships, but at this point the title has some connotations I <i>really</i> don&#39;t like thinking about when one of the main characters isn&#39;t human.<br><br>Anyway, nice writing, the idea of the Inner Monologue being vaguely separate is cool, you do you, have a great day. :)</p>

            <p>If your really all for inclusivity, you wouldn&#39;t automatically assume it&#39;s a parody. Who cares if one of them isn&#39;t strictly human? They&#39;re both sentient and sapient so they are both capable of giving consent so they can live their lives however they want!!! And anyway it&#39;s just a story. Even if they weren&#39;t capable, no one would get hurt; it&#39;s just fantasy. There is no need for you to be so judgementall about what is just a story. <br><br>(And the idea of separating out bits of her subconscious to talk is actally canon, so it&#39;s kind of a shallow thing to compliment.)</p>

            <p><i>Soo… I was thinking about the PPC recently, and it&#39;s cool and all, but I want to try something a little different. Tweak it a little! So I came up with this! Please enjoy! ( ^_^ )</i><br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Cornelius felt it almost immediately, as soon as he woke up. There was something off about… well, everything. Not in an obvious way, mind you; it was as if someone had moved the entirety of reality about two feet to the left while he had slept. Nothing seemed different. And yet, everything seemed different.<br><br>The feeling stuck with him as he got dressed and wandered into the main response center. It was countered slightly by the smell of fresh coffee.<br><br>Yeah. Coffee. Maybe that would clear his head.<br><br>Cornelius had just poured himself a mug when a holographic image of a young woman flickered to life over the large projector in the center of the room. The familiar figure smiled and nodded to him, causing her virtual pigtails to bobble slightly.<br><br>“Good morning, Agent Watson,” she said crisply.<br><br>“Morning, Rachel,” Cornelius replied. “What’s the good word?”<br><br>Various statistics began to appear in the air around the artificial intelligence. “Everything is proceeding nominally regarding our technical status,” she said. “There have been no pressing alerts regarding badfic, but Intelligence reports suggest that we may soon face a higher-than-normal number of <i>Overtale</i>-related AU missions. There is also the matter of… Agent Watson, are you unwell?”<br><br>Cornelius wrinkled his brow. “What makes you ask that?”<br><br>Rachel glanced down at the mug in his hands. “Typically, you consumed at least half of your coffee by this point in my morning briefing. You have instead done nothing but drum your fingers on it. Vital scans and stance analysis also suggests that you are slightly stressed.”<br><br>“I… I don’t know.” Cornelius set down his coffee and ran his hands over his bald scalp. “I’m just feeling a little weird. Can’t really say what’s up.”<br><br>“I’m not sure I understand. Are you in need of services from Medical or FicPsych?”<br><br>“What? No! It’s just a strange feeling. Like something’s off.”<br><br>Rachel’s expression softened a bit. “Perhaps taking a walk might help relieve this feeling,” she said. “We have been fielding more than our usual amount of missions. It’s only natural this might take a toll on you in some way.” <br><br>“I don’t know. Besides, what if something comes up? I don’t want to leave you hanging.&quot;<br><br>“I can cover for you if anything come up. Take your time.” She smiled again. “If my hard light projector were active, this would be the part where I would pat you reassuringly on the shoulder.”<br><br>Cornelius chuckled a bit. “All right. Maybe you’ve got something. I’ll take a quick walk, see if that clears anything up.”<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br><i>More to come soon! Please comment with good vibes, ya ya!</i></p>

            <p><i>First off, THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR THE COMMENTS! I luv you and your faces! Here&#39;s more story! Oh, and there might be shipping in the future! ( ^_~ )</i><br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>The walk was helping, but only a little. Cornelius still felt something digging at him in the very back of his mind.<br><br>The murmur of quiet conversation and the mingled smells of what was arguably food told him he was near the Cafeteria. He would not normally have given this much mind, but a lingering gurgle from his stomach suddenly reminded him that he had not actually had any coffee before leaving the response center. Cafeteria coffee, while not ideal, could be an acceptable temporary substitute.<br><br>He walked inside and made a beeline for the coffee machine. The liquid it dispensed was only a few steps above tar, but that was irrelevant. It was caffeinated, it was hot, and it was here. The snobbery could wait until he was back home.<br><br>Cornelius scanned the room as he sipped at his cup. His gaze stopped on a familiar figure sitting ramrod straight at one of the side tables. She was clothed all in black and appeared vaguely Asian. It was hard to tell due to the jawline-length bob obscuring part of her face, but it looked like her eyes were closed.<br><br>He wandered over. Maybe talking with someone else would help with this strange funk he was in.  “Good morning, Xeleppeon,” he said as soon as he was within acceptable conversation range. “Didn’t expect to see you here.”<br><br>Xeleppeon opened her eyes at the sound of Cornelius’ hail. Her expression did not shift from its normal neutral state as she looked over, but she did nod. “Hello, Cornelius,” she said. “My partner and I have only just returned from several missions in a row and are, unfortunately, too tired to cook properly. We would not have otherwise come here.” <br><br>She shifted in her seat. Cornelius could now see the dark circles under her eyes. “And you?” the Nobody asked. “What brings you here?”<br><br>“I forgot to get some coffee before going out for a walk.” He took a sip as to underline his point, and was able to prevent a sour expression from crossing his face. “Needed to clear my head. Something just felt weird when I woke up this morning.”<br><br>“In what way do you mean weird?”<br><br>“Well–”<br><br>“BREAKFAAAST!” someone exclaimed from about a foot behind Cornelius. Before he could react, a pale and lanky woman darted out from behind him and plopped two plates of greasy breakfast food on the table. “Aren’t I the best, Xelly?”<br><br>Xeleppeon rolled her eyes. “That is a point always up for debate when it comes to you, Bluescreen,” she replied. “For example, Agent Cornelius might disagree with your statement considering you just interrupted him.”<br><br>Bluescreen turned on her heel and gave Cornelius a puzzled look, as if she had only just noticed him. Recognition dawned on her face. “Cornelius, right! I remember now. My bad, by the way.” She flicked her blue-dyed bangs out of her eyes and offered her hand for a conciliatory handshake.<br><br>“Not a problem,” Cornelius said as he shook her hand.<br><br>Bluescreen sat down next to Xeleppeon, towering over the Nobody by almost a foot. “So what were you guys talking about?”<br><br>“It’s nothing. I’ve… I’ve just been having this strange feeling ever since I woke up. Like something’s not right with the world. It could be stress I suppose, but… yeah, I don’t know.”<br><br>Xeleppeon tapped the tips of her tented fingers together. “Could it be due to a canonical shift?”<br><br>“That&#39;s what I was thinking,” Bluescreen said through a mouthful of scrambled eggs. She thankfully swallowed before continuing her thought. “I get headaches and vertigo whenever DC makes a major change to their canon. Doesn’t even matter that they’re not changing my specific universe. It’s like ripples in a pond, or something.”<br><br>Cornelius shook his head. “I come from World One. It can’t be a canon thing.”<br><br>The two female agents exchanged a glance. “Then my best bet would be stress,” Xeleppeon said. “A general malaise, possibly from too many missions.”<br><br>“It happens to everyone eventually,” Bluescreen added. “My advice? See if you can wrangle a vacation out of whoever it is that’s running the DIAU. Take some time to clear your head.” She picked up a piece of bacon with her fingers and took a bite out of it. “In case that doesn’t work, which is pretty likely, I would recommend getting drunk.”<br><br>There was a small sigh from her partner. “You are a veritable font of wisdom.”<br><br>“I do what I can.”<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

            <p>I deliberately opted to use no capitalization or punctuation marks aside from full stops in the piece to give a stream of consciousness feel to the narrative. As it stands, your ability to parse prose or style beyond a dogmatic adherence to standardized grammar is neither my fault or my problem. Mithras help you if you ever encounter <i>Ulysses</i>.</p>

            <p>Summary: A Sue who should not exist anymore teams up with the Department of Inaccuracies to right a wrong.<br>Genre: Serious Business<br>Rating: T, I suppose.<br><br>DISCLAIMER: I still don’t own the PPC, it belongs to the legendary agents Jay and Acacia. Nor do I own Androiaavata’s home continuum <i>World of Warcraft</i>, which is property of Blizzard Entertainment. The <i>Harry Potter</i> series of books was created by the magnificent Joanne K. Rowling. <i>The Labyrinth</i> probably doesn’t need to be disclaimed here because it isn’t actually involved. <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1711100/1/The_Making_of_a_Queen">The Making of a Queen</a> belongs to Artemis Samhain, who may kindly keep it. It was sporked by EileenAlphabet and you should go and read <a href="https://rc170.wordpress.com/2011/10/30/the-making-of-a-queen-aka-the-raison-detre">this</a>, because it’s good although it’s not free of errors (and I siriusly don’t intend to recap this monster of a mission report). The agents in the Department of Inaccuracies are mine.<br><br>Author’s Notes:<br>I subdued <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/Story43-1.htm">last year’s little rebellion</a>; Androia knows her place again. Since you gave me more than the requested number of reviews, this is all your fault.<br>Many thanks to my beta reader ElenaAlgebra for the valuable suggestions I mostly ignored. All residual errors are obviously mine. <br><br><br><b>Prologue</b><br><br>The music was soft and mellow, almost seductive, as it had always been. Her dress was dark black like her hair, the tight bodice held by spaghetti straps fitting her lustrous curves, the wide skirt swinging free as she whirled around and around. All the other dancers, in their costumes made of damask, silk and satin, hid their faces behind masks; they didn’t matter. There was only One who counted, the handsome immortal who held her tightly in his arms and spun her around, until the daydream ended abruptly when he steered her into a wall. <br><br>Actually, the obstacle was a door set into one of the walls of the endless grey corridors. Sarah shook her head to clear her mind and glanced at the number on the door, comparing it to the first number scribbled onto the sheet of paper in her hand. Apparently she had got good advice. <i>Just don’t pay attention while you walk, and you will arrive where you need to be.</i> And yes, here she was, and she didn’t bother to knock. How could she be expected to be polite after all <i>they</i> had done to her? <br><br>A pink-coloured human-shaped flash crossed the room at amazing speed and disappeared behind a door when Sarah entered RC #1953. The elderly man who had been left behind glared at Sarah. &quot;What’s your business here?&quot; he asked savagely.<br><br>Sarah countered the man’s fury with an icy tone. &quot;Is this the Department of Inaccuracies?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why would you assume that such a Department even exists?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because the – entity at the help desk said this would be the place to take my complaints to. I have been unjustly charged by employees of your organization, and my story has been misrepresented in their mission report. What do you intend to do about this?&quot;<br><br>The man’s mood appeared to lift immediately. He took some sort of device out of a drawer and pointed it at Sarah. It looked like a sort of pocket calculator. Sarah could not see the display.<br><br>[Sarah Aithne Rhiannon Williams. Half-witch/half-Fae female OC, known to be ’such a calm, collected girl, who always had good timing’. Not!Labyrinth x Harry Potter. Undead Sue. Out of Character 50.38%.]<br><br>I frowned at the display. 50.38% is barely enough for a badfic. Maybe we should throw in some bad role-play and unwanted innuendo. Fortunately, Sarah had already given us a head-start. Good timing indeed.<br><br>The man frowned, shrugged and then drew his face into a malicious grin as he started to take more devices out of the drawer and stuff them into his pockets. &quot;Androia,&quot; he shouted, &quot;bring the quill patches! It’s one of those missions again.&quot; He turned to Sarah. &quot;Do you have the exact coordinates on your paper there?&quot;<br><br>Since she couldn’t get to her uniform while the stranger was there, Androiaavata had slipped into her old novice gown. Hearing her master’s voice, she hefted the appropriate flash patch onto her left shoulder and returned to the RC’s main room, just in time to hear the stranger talk. &quot;To gather the evidence, we first need to go to ISBN-9780747573609/66-29&quot;.<br><br>&quot;But this is a canon destination,&quot; said the non-human girl who had just re-entered the room. She was now wearing a long blue gown with a quill dropping red ink on the left shoulder, and Sarah wondered what species she might be. Her ears would have been far too long and pointy even for a Fae, reaching up above her head, and the pink of her face was too bright even for the given situation.<br><br>&quot;No disguises then,&quot; decided the man. &quot;The canon characters can&#39;t see us anyway.&quot; Meanwhile, the girl whose name was apparently Androia, had typed on several keys at a thing that looked like a computer console, and a blue-gleaming rectangle had appeared in mid-air. &quot;Ladies first,&quot; said the man with a little bow. With an irritable frown, Sarah stepped through the portal. The two agents followed and arrived on a platform at Paddington station just in time to watch a giant man and a small boy approaching a train.<br><br><i>Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would carry him back to the Dursley’s, then handed him an envelope.</i><br><br>&quot;Here it comes,&quot; hissed Sarah. &quot;Pay attention!&quot;<br><br><i>‘Yer ticket fer Hogwarts’, he said. ‘First o’ September – King’s Cross – it’s all on yer ticket.’</i><br><br>Sarah jumped excitedly. &quot;There, have you seen it? Now we can go to my story. The coordinates are FFN 1711100...&quot;<br><br>I rip the paper out of her hand, take the remote activator out of my pocket and type in the coordinates I memorized so long ago. This is going to be fun.<br><br>&quot;Wait,&quot; says Androia. &quot;Are there any original characters in this story? They will see us. Did you bring a Dorks?&quot;<br><br> Insubordination again? Implying that I forgot important equipment? Or a legitimate concern? I glare at her. &quot;I’ve got something better than the D.O.R.K.S.&quot; And I whip out the Invisibility Cloak.<br><br>(To be continued)</p>

            <p><i>The person at the door turned out to be Minerva McGonagall. The agents hid in a room as Sarah passed them to go downstairs, then crept out and watched the action from the top of the stairs.</i><br><br>Undead!Sarah and the Correctors, well hidden under the Invisibility Cloak that miraculously fitted all three of them, watched the Floaters, disguised as Gryffindor students, watching McGonagall and the Williams family discussing the revelation that Sarah is a witch. &quot;This Sarah looks exactly like our visitor,&quot; whispers Androia, as if I wouldn’t notice this myself. But from standing so close to our Sue, I can tell that they certainly don’t smell alike. How did she get between us anyway? This was supposed to be cuddling time. <br><br><i>McGonagall proceeded to explain, that since the Headmaster wanted Sarah to start her training from the basics, she could be given a potion, called Reincarna, that would turn her into an eleven-year-old.<br>“Charge for inventing an non-canonical potion,” the</i> female student <i>said.</i><br><br>&quot;That’s the Radioactive Moss Creature, also known as RMC,&quot; whispered the agent whose name is still unrevealed. &quot;Keep this in mind for future reference. The boy is Mittens, apparently some sort of minor devil from some sort of hell.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How do you know, master?&quot; whispered Androiaavata back. &quot;They do not look like a devil and a moss creature.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Remember that I remember everything I’ve seen in the archives. I expected this mission coming to us since I arrived in the PPC.&quot; But there was this nagging doubt. Misrepresented the story? Should I have actually read the glaurunging thing, not just the mission report? <br><br>Meanwhile, McGonagall finished a monologue with something that might be called a sentence, although it didn’t end with a full stop. &quot;<i><b>If you decide to go through this the potion will be send, together with the things Miss Williams would need for her first year and a ticket for the Hogwarts Express&quot;</b><br><br>“Again, heredity does not work that way, and since when do you need tickets for the Hogwarts Express?” the RMC asked.</i> <br><br>&quot;There it is,&quot; hissed Undead!Sarah. &quot;Charge them!&quot; <br><br> <i>“… tickets for the Hogwarts Express,” Mittens repeated as he wrote the charges.</i><br><br>&quot;They can’t blame me for Rowling never bringing it up again after chapter six,&quot; whined the undead Sue.<br><br>&quot;So, should we hit them with the book you certainly brought with you, master?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not yet. There’s no single point of intervention here. We have to watch more, and we need to get this [expletive not translated] note book.&quot;<br><br>Sensing her partner’s gloomy mood, Androiaavata decided to brush his ego a bit more, lest his anger might fall back unto her. &quot;Please enlighten me, master. If everything Miss Williams needs will be send to her, does she ever visit Diagon Alley? Should she be charged for not being chosen by her wand?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Doesn’t matter. We aren’t here to add to a charge list that’s already ridiculously long.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I hope you two aren’t trying to avoid taking any action by discussing technicalities,&quot; scolded Undead!Sarah. <br><br>The other Sarah was no longer in sight; apparently she had left short after McGonagall, and if she had gone upstairs to her room, Mittens and the RMC had somehow avoided to be seen by her. Androiaavata had been too distracted to know what exactly had happened, but now the Floaters were downstairs, <i>neuralyzing the two adults and sending them back to their canon along with the baby,</i> then they vanished through a portal. A sudden time distortion made the agents stumble, and they had to cling to Undead!Sarah. <b>Ten days later she faced a mirror, holding a crystal vial containing a turquoise liquid.</b><br><br>The human, the night elf, and the undead Sue were thrown against the mirror, and the agents watched in horror as Undead!Sarah diffused through the Invisibility Cloak and melted with the mirror image that indisputably was hers as well as the other Sarah’s.<br><br><b>&quot;For a new life&quot; she muttered, raising the potion in solitary toast &quot;Cheers&quot;</b><br><br>&quot;Now that’s a kind of mirror magic I didn’t expect,&quot; muttered the male agent, wrapping his arm around Androiaavata’s waist to steady her as the fic yanked them both six years forward into a compartment of the  Hogwarts Express.<br><br>&quot;I am glad that she is gone,&quot; whispered the night elf, unwrinkling her nose and giving in to the embrace. &quot;This stench was unbearable.&quot; The human agent laid a finger on her lips to silence her. After all, the Sue, now two years older then she had been before she drank the <i>Reincarna</i> potion, was in the same compartment and there was nothing to distract her but dwelling in her own thoughts and memories and the dreams of a ballroom dance.<br><br>As soon as the Sue had fallen asleep, the male agent removed his finger from Androiaavata’s lips and fumbled for the remote activator and Undead!Sarah’s list of important information. &quot;When she wakes up, we’re suddenly in a potions class,&quot; he murmured. &quot;And I don’t intend to be yanked through all the [expletive not translated] flashbacks and elsewhere-scenes Mittens and the RMC had to watch. So, the Sue’s other complaint refers to FFN1711100-6/3/24. That’s about one third through the mission.&quot; <br><br>The agents stepped through the portal and arrived in the middle of a battle, or at least a duel. A Death Eater fell onto the floor of the Great Hall, felled by Sarah’s leg-locking curse, but still able to set an indeterminate number of non-canonical Deathstrike snakes on Sarah, using his snake-animagus parseltongue skills. Sarah conjured a ring of fire around her to ward of the snakes. The Death Eater quickly conjured a thunderstorm inside the Great Hall.<br><br><b>Thick, heavy rain soaked Sarah to the bone, making her robes, shirt, tie, socks and grey plaited skirt (things she wore under the robes… I&#39;ve noticed that the School uniform is not reduced to black robes, including a white shirt and grey trousers/skirts and a tie with the House colours) stick to her skin as well as her long hair, that had freed itself from the remaining pins. The flames were quickly dying, much to the girl&#39;s horror and the snakes that hadn&#39;t been singed were ready to jump into action the moment the fire was out.</b><br><br>&quot;Locking his tongue might have been more useful,&quot; commented Androiaavata. &quot;Charge for in-fic and redundant author’s notes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I told you already that we&#39;re not here to add to the charge list. Look out!&quot;<br><br>The agent flung himself unto his partner and both landed in a mass of tangled limbs on the floor as a fireball hurtled over them. The deranged Invisibility Cloak did not hide them longer, but fortunately Mittens and the RMC, who had found a save and dry place from where to snark at the badfic, were too busy watching a touching scene (Sarah protecting the miraculously arrived house-elf Winky) being destroyed by <i>the way Finian Bloodstone first cast a fireball from behind Sarah and then was jerked through the room like a puppet on invisible strings to cast another, undefined spell, this time standing in front of her.</i> Sarah <b>felt rather than saw the blood soak her attire, mixing with the wetness from the rain that had stopped moments ago.</b><br><br>While Sarah conjured an unbreakable crystal ball around Winky, and the Floaters wondered why she didn’t protect herself in the same way, the Death Eater muttered an enchantment to strengthen the magical barrier that kept Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and Hermione Granger and Ginny Weasley out of the Great Hall. Sarah hit the Death Eater with an uncanonical spell, and the barrier began to break, but Sarah was too weak from wounds and snake poison to defend herself any longer when the Death Eater recovered and casted the unforgivable killing curse. In the last possible moment, Ginny wished the Death Eater away, and Jareth the Goblin King returned into Sarah’s life.<br><br>Androiaavata and her partner, who had disentangled themselves and rearranged the Invisibility Cloak, creped  out of the way as Saxo Cruore – no, Finian Bloodstone, he had not been recruited yet – was dragged to the Underworld. Having dealt with this, the Goblin King started to care for Sarah.<br><br><i><b>He seemed imposing even as he asked for help, the soaking girl tucked within his arms safely.</b><br>“Soaking?” the RMC asked. “When did she get wet?”<br>“He must have drooled on her some more, while we had our backs turned,” Mittens said.</i><br><br>&quot;No, this Death Eater made it rain on her,&quot; whispered Androiaavata. The RMC did not hear her.<br><br><i>“Charge for making herself soaking, thereby creation horrible implications.”<br><br><b>“She should be taken to the Hospital Wing” Minerva McGonagall said with her usual no-nonsense tone of voice “Madam Promfrey will most likely be awake, don’t you think Albus?”</b></i><br><br>(To be continued)</p>

            <p>While Mittens and the RMC stayed to take care of the mini-Aragog, the human and the night-elf agent followed the canon characters and the Fae <b>outside of the Great Hall and along the halls of Hogwarts</b>, but when the canons turned to the Hospital Wing, Androiaavata felt herself dragged further upstairs. &quot;Where are we going?&quot; she asked when the other agents, the canons and the Stu were all out of earshot. &quot;Are we not supposed to hit Agent Mittens over the head with a printout of the badfic? And probably the RMC should be hit with it as well.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We’re supposed to stay healthy, so we can continue doing our job. Thus, we’ll change into some dry clothes before we make any further plans. And concerning this misrepresenting-the-badfic  thing, considering that they somehow managed to stay dry, I wouldn’t expect overworked agents remembering every detail of such an outdrawn scene. Maybe we can shove it under the rug. This doesn’t need to be decided now.&quot; <br><br>Talking so much and climbing up a stair don’t go well together for an elderly man. I was quite out of breath when we arrived at the seventh floor, but I was still able to find the tapestry showing Barnabas the Barmy trying to teach trolls to dance the ballet, and to walk Androia past it three times while thinking hard: ‘We need dry clothes and a place to change, and I also need a printout of this badfic.’ Unfortunately, nothing happened. Why the heck didn’t it work? Maybe the Invisibility Cloak hid us too well, even from the Room of Requirements? I dropped the cloak and paced the corridor again, concentrating hard on what I wanted.<br><br>Androiaavata took the Invisibility Cloak up from the floor. While her hands folded it into a neat package without her even thinking about it, she watched the human become more and more angry. When he stopped pacing, the wall opposite the tapestry was still just a blank wall. The man uttered a series of words the universal translator didn’t translate, because, as he hat put it once, &quot;these are not appropriate for big, innocent, young ears.&quot; She wondered whether she should tell him that she couldn’t stop thinking that all this talk about health and getting into dry clothes was just a pretence to make her take her clothes off again. To her surprise, the human stopped cursing before she could make up her mind, and displayed this wicked smile she still didn’t know what to make of.<br><br>Just for a minute, I forgot that the Room of Requirement is not a Room of Wish-Fulfillment. So this has been decided for us. We are not required to hit agents with a badfic they misrepresented in their mission report (and the wet garment clinging to the girl&#39;s body isn’t actually a bad view), but we still have to decide whether &quot;making yourself soaking&quot; can stay on the charge list when this was actually done to her. Anyway, I remember the perfect place to finish this, so I defocus my eyes to find the cave that appears about 85 percent into the mission report, or, as it turned out to be in terms of the badfic, in chapter eighteen, section six, paragraph two.<br><br>The human’s face went blank for a moment, as it usually did when he read the words, then he took the remote activator out of one of his pockets and typed a sequence of numbers. ‘It is powered by plotholes,’ thought Androiaavata frantically, ‘it is powered by plotholes. There is certainly no electricity in it.’ Fortunately her partner didn’t remember the fiasco Mittens and the RMC had experienced with their neuralyzer, or his usual reasonability had been worn out over the last hour, so that he didn’t try to compare the portal generators remote activator to the remote activator of a TV set. The portal flickered into existence and the two agents donned the Invisibility Cloak again and stepped through. They arrived just at the same time as Jareth.<br><br><b>&quot;Well, well, look there sisters, what the cat just dragged into our neck of the world&quot; an old, high-pitched voice reached his ears just as he reached the open top of the mountain, the winds tangling his long cape around his legs &quot;Anyone would have thought he of all creatures would know better than to stir up things that have already been set in motion to pass&quot;</b> <br><br>Although the place had been called a <b>cave</b> in the first paragraph, at the end of <b>a long way up the mountain, or through the mountain</b>, the world settled for a grotto when the words made it obvious that the three Fates could see the Goblin King and that Jareth could hear the Fates talking before he even had reached the entrance to the so-called cave. Androiaavata noted that this came in handy for an attempt to use her druidic magic. As Jared and the Fates, who might actually have been Norns – and the real deal to boot – indulged in some banter, and the youngest Norn casually cut a life thread, the <b>wind carried from somewhere far enough a scream of sorrow</b>, further confirming that this couldn’t actually be far underground. King Jareth reminisced about Sarahs latest shenanigans, before he <b>took a seat atop one of the many heavy rocks scattered on the floor</b>, which wasn’t made of solid rock, since Androiaavata and the word world noticed that t<b>here was sand an ash all over his boots by now</b>. Very handy this was. <br><br>Apparently her partner had the same thought, for he shoved a book into her hands and whispered his advice. &quot;Since you’re so font of hitting people over the head, you do it. I’ll get the note book.&quot;<br><br>The two agents then watched silently as the Goblin King tried to return the gift of eternal love for a soul mate who had sent mixed signals over the last twelve chapters and apparently didn’t intend to love him back in the expected way. The Norns told Jareth that only Sarah’s death could free him from their gift, and a thread to the wizarding world that had been forgotten for the last twelve chapters raised its ugly head for a short moment.<br><br>&quot;If they found a decent beta reader and left the Potterverse and the Labyrinth alone to enact their original story, the Haunted King might actually be a good fairy tale,&quot; grumbled the human agent. <br><br>&quot;We are not here to judge the badfic,&quot; reminded Androiaavata. &quot;At least this is what you told me – master,&quot; she added after a short hesitation.<br><br><b>No more words were spoken. After all, there was really nothing left to be said.</b>  <br><br><i>The agents arrived at the cave, just as Jareth had stormed out. The three women looked up at them and smiled</i>, had a little chat with the Floaters, were neuralyzed with no effect whatsoever and were sent back to Norsk Mythology, where they belonged. Then the Floaters planned their final attacks, exploiting the Faes’ allergy to iron and Sarah being a heavy sleeper.<br><br><i>The RMC grinned. It was quite a disconcerting sight. “Did you bring any duck tape?”<br>Mittens actually looked mildly affronted at the question. “I brought two rolls.” Then he also grinned</i>, and the agents of the Department of Inaccuracies decloaked.<br><br>Roots broke out of the sandy floor and wound around the Radioactive Moss Creatures legs. It tried to speak or to draw its sword, but found itself totally immobilized by the power of nature’s magic. Mittens got one of his knives out before he was stopped by a Commanding Voice. &quot;Agent Mittens! Hand Over This Notebook. Right Now!&quot;<br><br>Mittens forgot immediately that he was not standing in front of a superior officer and gave this stranger whatever he wanted. Androiaavata approached the RMC, lifting <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</i> high above her pointy ears. &quot;Ages ago,&quot; she said, &quot;you asked since when tickets are needed for the Hogwarts Express. Your answer is in here, at the end of chapter five.&quot; The book came down onto the RMC’s head. &quot;Know your canon, Agent Moss!&quot;<br><br>Meanwhile, the human agent had scribbled into Mittens’ notebook and handed it back. &quot;Now Continue Your Mission, Agents!&quot;<br><br>The spell’s duration expired, the roots fell off the RMC’s legs and retreated into the ground, and the two Floaters hurried through a portal back to Hogwarts.<br><br>&quot;Must we follow them and watch the assassinations?&quot; asked Androiaavata, looking worried.<br><br>&quot;Sarah Sue being drowned in the Bog of Eternal Stench? No way! I’ve had enough of that stench. Let’s go home.&quot;  <br><br>(To be continued)</p>

But since this didn’t go onto the charge list (and PitViperOfDoom is not available for &quot;beta reading&quot;), there is hope that Dark Lady Jane will not return to complain about it.<br><br>((Serious question: What would the community think about taking on a faulty mission report without asking for the author&#39;s consent? Obviously such an attempt would be condemned to fail, because it is impossible to break the creativity shield and actually change an existing mission report as long as this report’s author doesn’t agree. It still may be a way to acknowledge that the PPC is not infallible, like an errata for a printed book, but funnier than just a list of known errors. <br><br>ETA: This was initially written more than a year ago, but then Imperial Liechtenstein invaded Fanfic World. So, since I actually got Permission now, I would also like to know what the community thinks about making the Department of Inaccuracies a canon department. After all, PPCing the PPC may not be as bad an idea as I thought when I started this trilogy.<br><br>And although these are the badfic games, serious reviews – or sporkings – would be appreciated too. I’m still learning this job. I <i>hope</i> that everything bad in this mission report is intentionally so, and that everything I intended to be bad is actually perceived as typical badfic. But how can I know if you don’t tell me?<br><br>HG))</p>

The male ones look like me and are blue magickckck type but the female ones look like her and are black magickckck type, it&#39;s like the colours on my fur.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wow,&quot; said Jaycacia. &quot;But she is sexy and you&#39;re a cat.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; Zeb said, &quot;but I can turn into a man, look.&quot; And he turned into a man and then he turned back.<br><br>&quot;Wow,&quot; said Jaycacia. &quot;So what do we do now?&quot;<br><br>&quot;There&#39;s only one thing we can do,&quot; said Zeb.<br><br>~<br><br><i>&quot;So Lux is a Pokemon now?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmph.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And magic-type... I don&#39;t follow the fandom, but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s not a thing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<b>Hmph</b>.&quot;<br><br>Jay glanced over at her friend. &quot;And you are in a massive sulk, be-cause...?&quot;<br><br>Acacia&#39;s finger stabbed down on the paper. &quot;I&#39;m supposed to be <b>dead</b>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, you know, dead, evil baby taking over your mother&#39;s mind...&quot; Jay tipped her head to the side. &quot;When you think about it, there&#39;s a lot of similarities...&quot;</i></p>

            <p>An/ tahnks MidnightMariposa097 &amp;&amp; Amomynous for ur revuews!<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re going to have go to back in time to before the badfic got the Avatar pregnant and make her pregnant ourselves!<br><br>Jaycacia blinked. &quot;What?&quot;<br><br>The Avatar blinked. &quot;What?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s the only way!&quot; stated Zeb. &quot;We can&#39;t make the baby go away or else we could destroy the entire time continuum!&quot;<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s right you know,&quot; said the Avatar, putting away her guns. &quot;That&#39;s what would happen if you took my baby.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thanks, partner.&quot; Zeb smiled at her. &quot;But if we go back and make her have a different baby in her instead, then everything will be fine! And also Acacia will never be born, so you won&#39;t have to have a bad mother.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wow,&quot; said Jaycacia, &quot;that makes a lot of sense. But how are we going to go back in time?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh that&#39;s easy,&quot; said the Avatar. &quot;I have a Tardies which we can use.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But you can&#39;t come!&quot; said Zeb. &quot;If you see your past self that would destroy the time continuum!&quot;<br><br>&quot;But no it won&#39;t,&quot; said the Avatar. &quot;Because that was before I regenerated so I looked different (a/n here babie wos okae wehn she regnertated so dot&#39; worrt!).&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh okay then,&quot; said Zeb. &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot;<br><br>So Jaycacia and Zeb and the Avatar went to the Avatar&#39;s Tardies and got into it. &quot;Engage!&quot; shouted the Avatar, and the Tardies read her mind and transported them back to when the Avatar got pregnant with the badfic. Then they stepped out and looked around for her.<br><br>&quot;Oh no!&quot; shouted Jaycacia, pointing at where the Avatar (a/n teh old on mot the nev one!) was getting into bed with the badfic. &quot;We&#39;re too late!&quot;<br><br>~<br><br><i>Acacia leant on the windowsill, gazing out at the city. &quot;You know, there&#39;s a poet around somewhere who insists on comparing Rome to a woman - beautiful, wise, faithful, all that.&quot;<br><br>Jay looked up from the roasted dormouse she had been dubiously prodding. &quot;Yeah?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah.&quot; Acacia looked down at the page in her hand. &quot;Sometimes I wonder if he&#39;s ever <b>met</b> a real woman.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, now, that&#39;s not fair.&quot; Jay surreptitously wiped her greasy finger on her sleeve. &quot;There&#39;s lots of- some- there&#39;s got to be at least one woman who&#39;s really like that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m reading Jaycacia Thornbyrd stories.&quot; Acacia carefully tore off a corner of the paper and began to fold it in half repeatedly. &quot;It&#39;s not exactly conducive to faith in humanity...&quot;</i></p>

We have to get in there and have more sex with her than the badfic is! (a/N so kk iM not sur how geting prengant words?! LOK i meen I KNW hoe it wrosk but whn tehres&#39; more tahn 1 boy?!? anways i tHink tihs is write)&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay,&quot; yelled Jaycacia. Then Jaycacia and Zeb and the Avatar ran across the room. They took each others&#39; clothes off as they ran, and also Zeb turned into his hott human form. Then they reached the bed. Then Zeb shouted &quot;Avatar I am here to get your pregnant so the badfic doesn&#39;t!&quot;, and the Avatar said &quot;Oh okay,&quot; but the badfic said, &quot;No I will get her pregnant.&quot;<br><br>So then Zeb tried to have sex with the Avatar, but the badfic kept confusing him so he had sex with Jaycacia (A/N GodMooodAdict!1!! yu can sned taht intwerebs to mi enail anddress!!!) or the new Avatar instead. But also Jaycacia sacrificed herself and made the badfic have sex with her, so it couldn&#39;t confuse Zeb as much as it wanted.<br><br>So Zeb managed to have lots of sex with the Avatar. &quot;Yes!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Now we will stop the evil Acacia being born ever!&quot;<br><br>Then a bolt of midnight lightning cracked down from the ceiling and knocked Zeb off the bed.<br><br>&quot;Oh no!&quot; cried Jaycacia. &quot;We are having sex!&quot; (A/N so funi sotry my fiend wantsed tihs to be a VERI RUDE line adn i sad NO WAU but I sill licked teh Joke so i Sad it like tihs insetd. hop thats&#39; okies!)<br><br>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; cackled an evil voice, &quot;you are doubly having sex! For not only have I stopped Zeb from getting the Avatar pregnant with his nice baby (and also now the badfic is having sex with her instead so it will deffo be an evil baby), but also I am already back!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh no!&quot; cried Jaycacia again. &quot;Mother!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; cackled Acacia Byrd. &quot;I&#39;m ba-ack!&quot;<br><br>~<br><br><i>Acacia put the page down carefully. &quot;Oh, hells.&quot;</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br>((I intended for real!Acacia to go on a long rant here, but checking, that&#39;s really not her style. So she gets understated instead.))<br><br>((Also, JayBird has been writing Jaycacia stories for 12 years, which - assuming FF.net rules for fanficcers - makes her at least 25. Dwell on that for a moment, and then &quot;repeat to yourself, it&#39;s just a game/I should really just relax...!&quot;))</p>

We&#39;ll have backups brought in as soon as we clear out the rest of the building.<br><br>In the meantime, don&#39;t let our oppression get you down! For you, fans of the Protectors of the Plot Continuum, have a mission of your own to complete. And that mission is... WRITE MORE FANFIC!

<br>Or, in other words... welcome to the PPC Badfic Game 2016.<br><br><b>What is this?</b> This is the thread where we let our inner badfic writers have free rein. All PPC stories are technically fanfics of the Original Series - but they&#39;re all goodfics. That&#39;s clearly unreasonable - most fanfic of anything is terrible. So this is your chance to write the baddest of the badfics. Go nuts!<br><br><b>Who can I write about?</b> Any agents in the PPC are open for you to mutilate. There&#39;s a Creativity Shield around ffW, so everything here is emphatically uncanon. The only exception is that, if someone asks in this thread that their agents not be used, please honour that. I can&#39;t imagine why you <i>would</i>, but the offer&#39;s there.<br><br><b>Where do I post?</b> In this thread, please. As you can see, fanficWorld itself won&#39;t be involved in this year&#39;s game - I don&#39;t have the energy for archiving right now. (Yes, again. I know, I know. :()<br><br><b>What name should I post under?</b> You should come up with the badficauthorest name you can, of course! <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/ffW/PPCIndex.htm">Take a look at some of our previous examples.</a><br><br><b>What sort of story should I write?</b> A bad one! Obviously. But also one that&#39;s fun to read. Illegible ultra-typo stories are a bit boring after the first one, y&#39;know?<br><br><b>Can I leave reviews?</b> Emphatically yes - that&#39;s half the fun of the game! But do remember to leave them in character - and equally, remember that the flames you receive are not real flames. They&#39;re a game. Don&#39;t get upset.<br><br><b>Do I need a beta?</b> Hahahahahahahaha. Don&#39;t be ridiculous. ^-^ What sort of badfic writer has a beta?<br><br><b>Do I need Permission?</b> Again, what sort of badfic writer asks permission? (No. No you don&#39;t)<br><br><b>Why are we doing this?</b> Because it&#39;s fun!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Okay, guys, I decided to write about the Aviator cause she’s pretty cool. Hope you guys like it, and  please review!<br><br>‘’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’<br><br>The sue was the one from Bird Brain, and she was talking about the difference between orcs and goblins and stuff, and the Aviator had had just about enough of her stupidity.<br><br>“They are exactly the same!” the Aviator exploded, grateful for the distraction. Then she pondered “But are they in the movieverse, though?”<br><br>Zeb said nothing (AN/: because I hate the character and feel like excluding him, it’s a creative choice so just live with it okay?)<br><br> “Well, it’s never said that they’re not,” the Aviator said to herself. She was annoyed. She tilted her head and thought.  “I’m going to attack the Sue now, and I don’t have to worry about charging her because everyone loves me!”<br><br>Suddenly, Davros appeared behind her, cackling maniacally. ‘Capture her, my pretties!’ he cryed, as the Daleks shot tendrils of electricity and bound her painfully between the two (AN: I know they don’t in Doctor Who but these do cause Davros made these special Daleks). As the Aviator cried out in pain, she screamed, ‘Why?” <br><br>“SCIENCE!!!!!” Davros stated menacingly, and began to apply the electrodes, still cackling with glee as the Aviator saw wings conveniently placed in the corner. “NO! YOU’re gonna do to me what you did with that Sue!” <br><br>“Yes,’ said Davros, “I will. And I will tell you why, it is because of my fetish for wings, and my queen must be a winged Timelord!” <br><br>“You mean you’re going to make me. . .” her eyes dialed in horror, “The QUEEN of the Dalleks?!!!” Davros cackled in agreement.  <br><br>“I’ll never love you!” the Aviator threatened bravely.<br>“That is why I have also procreated the Doctor!!” stated Davros, as the Doctor stepped into the laboratory room. The Aviator could see him over the top of the tight leather suit Davros had put her in before taking her to the opposite end of the compound and bounding her to the cold metal table (A/N: sorry, forgot to write that, lol).<br><br>The tall blonde Tim Lorde stepped from the shady doorway, and the Aviator could tell he was one of those Dalek slaves from that one episode with Amy and Rory’s divorce cause he had a blue-glowing-eye sticking out from his forehead. He also had wings, which he fluttered. Ignoring Davros’s sudden blush, she was suddenly intreeged, not just by the hot Timelord, but also by a plan! She had an idea!<br><br>‘’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’‘’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’<br><br>Okay, guys- that’s the end of my first chapter! Word says its like 500 words long- WOW!!! Hope the next one doesn’t take so long to write. Everyone who reviews to let me know they liked my story is the best!<br></p>

And the fanbase is really smart - in one chapter, someone worked out that an unnamed character was Brunnhilde of the Valkyries from the fact that she kvetched about her dad and her magic used triangles. In a matter of <i>days</i>. That&#39;s why that one fic got my back up so much; it&#39;s a small fandom and a smart fandom, and it deserves better than that. Also, thank you for liking my work!

            <p>We probably didn’t want to offend the Vatican or any country that’s big enough to do something about it :-). And who would know Tuvalu, Nauru, San Marino or Palau (which is actually bigger than Liechtenstein, although it has less inhabitants). And Monaco (much smaller than Liechtenstein, but slightly more inhabitants) just doesn’t work.<br><br>Actually, we probably didn’t want to offend a fellow Boarder from that country, and the risk of ever seeing a Boarder from one of the countries listed above is negligible.<br> <br>HG</p>

He looked up whe nhe heard a knock on the door. &quot;Come in,&quot; he said and got up to answer it. He almost fell over when he realized the Flowers had sent him an Andalite. &quot;Are you my new partner?&quot; he asked eagerly.<br><br>The Andalite nodded. &quot;My name is Ilraen.&quot; He said. (A/n I can&#39;t remember the rest of his name sorry!) &quot;I was rescued from a badfic. It is very nice to meet you.&quot; He held out a hand and they shook.<br><br>Nume was startled when an electric shock past between them but he shook it off and stood aside, holding the door open so Ilraen could come in. &quot;I&#39;m Supernumerary,&quot; he said. Ilraen smiled.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re supernumerary at all.&quot; He said, &quot;Even if you are in a rather small department.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No no, that&#39;s my name,&quot; Nume said, laughing. &quot;So what brings you to the PPC?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am a badfic rescue.&quot; Ilraen said, his extra eye things moving around as he looked at the RC. &quot;But I was given a chip in my head that gives me information about the Andalite home world so I can better act like a real Andalite.&quot; He smoothed down his cerulean fur then laced his fingers together. &quot;It will be good to get settled in.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I could give you a tour later.&quot; Nume said. <br><br>Ilraen smiled, except with his eyes because he didn&#39;t have a mouth. &quot;I would like that very much.&quot;<br><br><b>A/N: More to come as I get inspired!

Everyone, Make sure to review if you want more!</b><br><br>Chapter Two<br><br>As Nume and Ilraen were walking down the corridor, Ilraen stopped when a new smell hit his nose. &quot;What is that?!&quot; He asked alarmed.<br><br>Nume looked at him. Curious. &quot;What&#39;s what?&quot; He asked. <br><br>&quot;That smell!&quot; Ilraen said looking around. <br><br>&quot;That&#39;s food.&quot; Nume said. &quot;Food is something humans eat to live.&quot; He said noticing Ilraen&#39;s confused face. &quot;You eat with your hoofs, we eat with our mouths.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What is a mouth?&quot; Ilraen asked<br><br>&quot;This.&quot; Nume opened his mouth to show him. &quot;Mouths are also used for talking. And... other things.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What other things?&quot; Ilraen asked.<br><br>&quot;Maybe I&#39;ll tell you later&quot; Nume said embarrassed. He liked Ilraen, not in that way (YET) and didn&#39;t want to scare him off so soon as partners. Mersifully he was saved when they heard their console going off back in their RC. &quot;Oh hey look at that, we have a mission.&quot; Nume said hurrying away. <br><br><b>A/N: Ooooh Ilraen gets to become human for the first time next chappie!

            <p><b>A/N: @mattman14 Thank you!<br><br>Everyone else, review! More reviews, more chapters! Everyone wins!</b><br><br>Chapter Three<br><br>After Nume and Ilraen got their disguises set they went through the portal into the mission. Immediately Ilraen tripped and almost fell over because he wasn&#39;t used to two legs but Nume caught him.<br><br>Nume realized he was holding a very handsome good looking young man with bright red hair in his arms and he almost dropped Ilraen in suprise. His heart fluttered and they just looked at eachother for a while as Ilraen&#39;s face slowly started turning the same color as his hair.<br><br>Finally Nume coughted and said &quot;Right then, up you get.&quot; He helped Ilraen to stand. <br><br>&quot;This is very uncomftorbale,&quot; Ilraen said. &quot;How are you supposed to balance on just two legs?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can help with that.&quot; Nume said and held out his hand. &quot;Here. Hold my hand.&quot; His face was slowly becoming the same color as Ilraen&#39;s hair too. &quot;It will help you keep your balance while you learn.&quot;<br><br>Ilraen nodded and held Nume&#39;s hand. His face was red as he got his balance. &quot;Okay, I think I&#39;m getting the hang of—&quot; He said letting go.<br><br>Ilraen yelped and fell over taking Nume with him. Nume ended up lying on the ground with Ilraen on top of him.<br><br>They were quiet for a moment. Nume&#39;s face was now bright red.<br><br>&quot;Um.&quot; Nume said.<br><br>&quot;Um.&quot; Ilraen said too.<br><br>&quot;Get off me.&quot; Nume finally said, and gently pushed Ilraen off him.<br><br>&quot;I think I will need to keep holding your hand a little longer.&quot; Ilraen said, and blushed. &quot;Just for educational purposes you know.&quot;<br><br>Ilraen nodded. &quot;Yes, that would be a good idea.&quot; He hoped Nume couldn&#39;t tell how embarassed he was.<br><br>Nume rubbed the back of his neck. &quot;Yes, that&#39;s a good idea.&quot; He agreed. &quot;But not for too long.&quot; He added quickly. &quot;You need to learn how to walk on your own after all.&quot;<br><br>Ilraen smiled. &quot;I am a fast learner.&quot; He said. &quot;Speaking of learning, when will you tell me those other things mouths are used for? Now that I have one I would like to learn.&quot;<br><br>Nume&#39;s face was as red as it could get. &quot;Maybe later.&quot; He said quickly. &quot;right now we have a mission to do.&quot;<br><br>Ilraen nodded. &quot;Then let&#39;s do this.&quot;<br><br><b>A/N: Wow this was a long chapter!
