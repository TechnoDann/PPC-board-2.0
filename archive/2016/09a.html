            <p>I folded the Original Series and All-Stars decks into More Cards Against Headquarters, basically because a) TOS <i>is</i> the PPC and should be in any PPC game, and b) I got sick of having to think so hard about where to put new cards.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Would anyone, by any chance, be up for a play-by-post game of Costume Fairy Adventures? I have talked about the game briefly on the Discord channel, but for those unfamiliar, the basic idea is that you play tiny fairies (think the Tinkerbell movies, not the Fair Folk) who engage in mischief and pull pranks on humans and each other, all while in costume. The reason behind the costumes is simple: Faires get magic from make-believe. If you dress up as a wizard you can throw fireballs, if you dress up as The Doctor (an actual costume in the game, the 4th Doctor to be precise) you get perfect timing and the ability to regenerate. Of course, fairies have magic on their own, as is expected of tiny beings fueled by wishes, but they&#39;re more powerful in costume.<br><br>You can find the full description and various important links <a href="http://penguinking.com/games/costume-fairy-adventures/">here</a>. For those who are regulars on tumblr, the game is written by Prokopetz. (Both his tumblr name and his last name.)<br><br>My idea was to run the playset The Great Pie Caper for 3-6 people. The quickstart rules are free and will teach you how to play, and there are premade characters. For those who want to make their own characters, I own the full book and am willing to share the relevant section. (Probably via a lot of copy/paste and a Google Doc.)<br><br>For any of you who want to play in person, and happen to be able to make it to Atlanta, I will be running the same playset at Anime Weekend Atlanta, the last weekend in September, along with a Call of Cthulhu Scooby Doo game. Both me and Delta Juliette will be at the con, come join us and we can make it an official Gathering. (I think you need at least three for that, right?)</p>

            <p>So, I finally have three players meaning we can actually get started. I&#39;ve set up the roll20 forum, so I just need your emails to send the invites. For the record, the other player is former PPCer Lily Sinful. There is a possible fourth, but he is slightly unlikely, so I am fully willing to get started with out him.</p>

            <p>I was thinking Roll20, it does require making an (entirely free!) account, but it has plugins for dice rolling and allows us to show off stuff like reference images for characters (I have several I am willing to share with people if needed) and maps so people know where things are. This is a lot more free form than, say, D&amp;D, so we don&#39;t actually need stuff like tokens to represent movement or anything like that, but maps are still useful.</p>

            <p>Introducing TIME LORD, an old RP published during the Seventh Doctor&#39;s era on the show. But old does not mean bad! The rules are very simple and easy to pick up as players take on the role of any of the Doctors (#1-7) and/or any of their companions throughout the show&#39;s Classic Era! I&#39;m going to see how best to set up the game - hopefully by using Roll20 if possible, but a Google Doc will do if nothing else works. If anyone is interested let me know. :)</p>

Basically I was on here before hanging out and even wondering if I should submit agents too. <br>Then a lot of stuff happened in irl with school and medication changes.  <br>But I&#39;m back and ready to go. <br>Don&#39;t worry I reread the The PPC Constitution and I&#39;m going to hang around for a while before I actually try submitting agents and such.<br>For now I&#39;m simply going to enjoy hanging out for a bit.

            <p>Sadly, I am on the other side of the country (in a westerly direction, this time), but I hope you enjoy it - that con is <i>epic</i>. The steampunk was out of control the year I went, in the best possible way - and, if memory serves me, the protest Girl Genius and several other comic artists were holding had ended, since they finally stopped inviting one guest who was… I don&#39;t actually remember. A sexual harasser of some sort. <br><br>Point being, it&#39;s on the up and up from what I recall, and have fun! And if you go into the rooms off the underground food court, beware - several hours will pass while your hindbrain still thinks it&#39;s daylight. I think this happened to us at least twice. </p>

            <p>The protest ended because one of the staff members, who was banned from attending and had a restraining order keeping him from coming within 1000 feet of any of the hotels but who also had an iron-clad contract meaning that as long as the con was being held he would get a cut of the profits, finally died. Other than that you&#39;re mostly correct.</p>

            <p>What counts as a full reference? Tell you what, I&#39;ll scribble down whatever I see and you can tell me what counts. :D<br><br>-Chapter titles. Particularly apt since the kindergarten counts as a prequel.<br><br>-Your opening paragraph feels like a reference to something, but I don&#39;t know what.<br><br>-Manga, Cap, Balista, and Antares are all references. ^_^<br><br>-I&#39;m going to assume Bonsai (as in Mallorn) isn&#39;t.<br><br>-The Eye of Argon is, though.<br><br>-Flying saucer landing rigs sound like Men in Black.<br><br>-The Doctor and his companions mention frequently how much running is involved. Specifically his clone daughter Jenny, I think.<br><br>-Dumbo is a weird movie. Seriously weird. It has noooo plot.<br><br>-The Inquisition is after you.<br><br>-Ice ages are a reference to a known climate phenomenon... ;)<br><br>-You apparently got drunk on Pacific Rim references.<br><br>-I assume the test card is from something specific. You also seem to be blaming Mary Sues or the Mysterious Somebody - not sure which is better.<br><br>-The miniature giant space hamsters are of course a reference to the giant space hamster die from the unofficial gnomes expansion to TSR&#39;s classic dice collecting game Dragon Dice.<br><br>-At least three of the agent captions are references to things I don&#39;t recognise. &#39;Stumbled into a badfic&#39; doesn&#39;t seem to be. And the final one references Queen Victoria&#39;s famous (and inaccurate) catchphrase.<br><br>I think that&#39;s all I caught. If there&#39;s anything in the pictures, I missed it. But Dawn&#39;s skirt is absolutely amazing.<br><br>Oh no, wait!<br><br>-You referenced the PPC!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure if there are any pictures of us together--I mainly remember plays and so on from grade 1, though I know there were some things together with the parents around holidays (or at least, we made lanterns at Chanukah one year and lit tea lights in them and walked home after singing a song together and I have no idea what else). Pretty sure those weren&#39;t filmed, though, and I don&#39;t remember having any pictures.<br><br>What I do have pictures of, because my parents were involved, is a shadow puppet play the parents did (pretty sure that was kindergarten...). I don&#39;t know if both classes came to it, though. There are also class photos, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re of the whole school.<br><br>So yeah. I&#39;ll follow the shadow puppet lead at some point, but so far I&#39;m assuming there are probably just pictures of us not together. Outside of pictures, though, you never know--maybe we ran into each other during recess/outdoor playtime/whatever that was, and neither of us remembers because we were very little...<br><br>As for Dawn&#39;s skirt, thanks :) It comes from an Israeli store (and wasn&#39;t bought for the occasion, I&#39;ve had it since the year I joined the PPC as far as I remember), so in-universe... either her sister got it for her, or the agents did some shopping before the mission caught them. That or it&#39;s just not an Israeli skirt in-universe. No matter what, though, it&#39;s certainly fun to wear, and was likely the most Dawn-ish thing I had with me, apart from nail polish...<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: Blame was intended for Mary Sues, although you never know who&#39;ll take advantage of ambiguity in initials...<br><br>PPS: Bonsai was a real place with very good sushi. I kept going there, actually, including for my birthday. And the website is even still up! Unfortunately, if they still exist, they aren&#39;t in the same location.</p>

            <p>The main board was refusing IPv4 packets as of 00:40 UTC on Sunday, September 4th. This means that, for most people, going to disc.yourwebapps.com to reach the main board didn't work. However, the underlying server appears to still be up if you connect to it with IPv6. One such IPv6 address is <code>2600:3c02::f03c:91ff:fe98:54ea</code>, which means you can reach the Board with the following link (copy-paste it): <code>http://[2600:3c02::f03c:91ff:fe98:54ea]/Indices/199610.html</code></p>

<p>However, this will only work if you have an IPv6 connection. See <a href="http://ipv6-test.com/">this test</a> to see if you do.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s possible to cross LotR and Zelda well at all, especially considering the whole &quot;Zelda has at least 3 timelines&quot; thing.

            <p>I figured I might as well combine two things I&#39;d been hoping to include for a while--Ami reciting the Lay of Elbereth and SOCS--as a replacement for the original idea, Canon!Din smiting her. Is it weird that I kinda want to do another Zelda fic now? There are so many interesting ways to do the Duty!</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Okay... so I&#39;ve recently discovered a wonderful world of unreleased Disney songs. And my only question is... whyyy?! Why would Disney decide to not use such fantastic pieces?! Just take a look at these four, which are absolutely superb:<br><br><br>1) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4_NnQ473Rk">&quot;Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim&quot;</a>, from <i>Aladdin</i>. Originally, Aladdin was supposed to have three friends with him (I&#39;m gonna let you guess what their names were ;D), and this was their introduction. A vaudeville-like number, which sounds oh so good! Luckily, it was implemented in the Broadway musical version, and Kassim ultimately was named Aladdin&#39;s father in the third film.<br><br>2) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDZ8X5Y9hPI">&quot;High Adventure&quot;</a>, also from <i>Aladdin</i>. Because Aladdin&#39;s three friends were removed from the film, naturally this song was also scrapped. I assume this happens right after the Genie gets unleashed from the lamp. Either that, or after something happens to Jasmine. Nonetheless, it&#39;s a great song. Again, thank the musical version for bringing it back.<br><br>3) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuKkMH_7nBw">&quot;I&#39;m Odd&quot;</a>, from <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. It was supposed to be sung by the Cheshire Cat, about...well...how odd he is. It was later replaced by the Cat singing the beginning of &quot;Twas Brilling&quot; poem, because Disney didn&#39;t want to put the Jabberwocky himself so at least he wanted to nod to the poem. Oh well, in my opinion this song fits the Cheshire Cat much better.<br><br>4) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1pYGvplG5Q">&quot;Snuff Out the Light&quot;</a>, from <i>Emperor&#39;s New Groove</i>. Originally, this song was made for the working title of the story, <i>Kingdom of the Sun</i>, which was a Mesoamerican re-telling of Mark Twain&#39;s <i>The Prince and the Pauper</i>. It featured a selfish emperor, which finds a peasant that looks exactly like him, and they switch places. Meanwhile, an evil witch wants to find a way to stay young forever, so she decides to cover the Sun with the help of evil spirits. Ultimately, it changed into the story we know, about the emperor transformed into a llama, and this song was scrapped since it had no relation to the plot. And it&#39;s a real shame, because this is a Disney Villain Song, which 8/10 times is the best one in the whole movie. Just tell me you don&#39;t jam to the music and the voice of late Eartha Kitt when listening to this?<br><br><br>So, what about you guys? Ever found a song you wish was featured in a film? </p>

            <p>So, the new e-books from <i>Pottermore</i> are out two or so days ago, and... as you can expect they&#39;re 80% texts we&#39;ve already been given for free, with only two out of thirty-six being new ones. Those being the biography of Horace Slughorn and... explanation on Animagi, with a complete process of becoming one!<br><br>Now, this is a direct translation from Polish, since I haven&#39;t seen English version:<br><br><br><br><i>To become an Animagus, you need to be skilled in both Transfiguration and Potions. The following instruction, if followed thoroughly, shouldn&#39;t provide any negative outcomes, both physical and mental:<br><br>1. For an entire month (from one Full Moon to another), you have to hold a mandrake leaf in your mouth. You can&#39;t swallow it, or remove it. If the leaf it out, the whole process has to be started again.<br><br>2. During the second Full Moon, take the leaf out and put it (with saliva) in a small crystal vial, exposed to the moonlight (if the night is cloudy, you have to pick a new leaf and repeat Step One). To the moonlight-exposed vial, you need to add one of your hair, a (silver) spoonful of dew picked from a place untouched by sunlight or human for seven days, and a pupa of Greater Death&#39;s Head Hawkmoth. Hide the whole mixture in a quiet, dark place and don&#39;t disturb it until the next thunderstorm.<br><br>3. While waiting for the storm, every day repeat the following procedure: At sunrise and sunset touch your heart with the tip of your want and chant the words: &quot;</i>Amato Animo Animato Animagus<i>&quot;.<br><br>4. Waiting for the thunderstorm may take weeks, months, years even. During this whole time, the crystal vial should be left completely undisturbed, and untouched by sunlight. Sun contamination can lead to some horrible mutations. You should also fight the temptation of opening the vial and looking at the potion, until you see lightning outside. If the sunrise-sunset incantation is done correctly, there will be a moment when - after touching your heart with your wand - you will hear an additional heartbeat, sometimes stronger and sometimes weaker then the original. If that happens, it means there&#39;s no turning back: the sunrise-sunset incantation should be repeated with no slip-ups at the right time, and never be skipped.<br><br>5. As soon as you spot the first lighting on the darkened sky, immediately go to the place where you hid the vial. If you followed the steps correctly, inside you will find a blood-red potion, enough for one gulp.<br><br>6. It is important to move to a large and secured area, where the Animagus transformation won&#39;t raise panic or won&#39;t risk your health. Touch your heart with your wand, repeat the incantation: &quot;</i>Amato Animo Animato Animagus<i>&quot; and drink the potion.<br><br>7. If everything went right, you are going to feel a burning pain and hear intense beating of two hearts. In your mind, a shape of an animal will appear. This is the animal you&#39;re gonna turn to in a moment. You must show no fear. It is too late to stop now.<br><br>8. The first transformation is usually uncomfortable and scary. Clothes and accessories (glasses, jewelry, etc.) are melting into your skin, becoming fur, scales, or spikes. You shouldn&#39;t fight or resist this change, otherwise the animal&#39;s mind may take over and do something stupid, like escape through the window, or charge at the wall.<br><br>9. When the transformation end, you should feel comfortable physically. You should remember to hide you wand beforehand in a safe spot, to easily find her when you return to your human form. <br><br>10. To transform back into human, you need to visualize yourself as one. That should be enough, but you should panic if it doesn&#39;t happen immediately. When practiced, the transformation will occur as soon as you conjure the image of the animal or human in your mind, without the need to use a wand.<br><br>Usually, witches and wizards prefer to transform with their clothes, to avoid the embarrassment of nudity, although sometimes they let them stay to pretend taking a bath. The longer the witch or wizard practices their Animagus transformation, the easier it is to choose the method of changing with or without clothes.<br><br>The Animagus&#39; animal form is usually the same form their Patronus takes. There are no recorded cases of the Animagus form changing to adapt to a changed Patronus. Then again, there are so little wizards capable of producing a Patronus AND transforming into animals, the research lacks data.</i><br><br><br><br>And... I guess that&#39;s it. We have the instruction now.</p>

            <p>Are you telling me that James &quot;I get bored so easily that I have to bully other kids&quot; Potter managed to not only carry a leaf in his mouth for a <i>whole month</i> without spitting it out, but also consistently said the same incantation twice a day after that? Are you <i>serious</i>? (Har, har.)<br><br>... frankly, I&#39;m going to have to assume the first thunderstorm was one day after the potion was made.

            <p>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I <i>loathe</i> James Potter, but I very much see him doing something like this for Remus, and also because it&#39;s <i>cool</i>, and he wants to. Honestly, what surprises me after reading this description is that more people don&#39;t. I suppose one or two of the ingredients (the dew - though how they managed that, I&#39;d like to know, for the same reason) must be prohibitively expensive to people without allowances to save. <br><br>(I see so many people hating on Snape, who again don&#39;t get me wrong is a very flawed character and in many ways a terrible person, but for pity&#39;s sake, can we admit that he was at minimum sexually harassed, and more probably sexually assaulted*, by his peers - who were beloved of the teachers and administration - throughout several years of his life? That that <i>just might</i> mess a person up?)<br><br><br><br>*&quot;Now who wants to see me take Snivellus&#39; pants off,&quot; guys. I&#39;m pretty sure forcibly stripping someone in public is assault. </p>

            <p>It could have been pretty entertaining, going around with a leaf in his mouth for a month and keeping anyone from being the wiser. Haha, these people are all so blind, etc. And it could&#39;ve been a competition with Sirius, too. What, you&#39;re gonna let a stupid little leaf get the better of you, mate?<br><br>Also, one of his better qualities is loyalty to his friends. He wasn&#39;t about to let Remus down.<br><br>What shocks me is that <i>Sirius</i> saw it through. James was a show-off and a bully, but Sirius was the one who complained of being bored and hated sitting still, IIRC, and he was the bad-boy flirt, too. It must have put a bit of a damper on his charms.<br><br>Still... wouldn&#39;t want to be a baby about it, or you might end up turning into something stupid like a chicken or a rabbit.

            <p>... how sure are you that <i>didn&#39;t</i> happen? Okay, so James got a stag, which is moderately cool. Sirius got... an evil black dog.

            <p>So Pettigrew is arrested, and - being perhaps overly generous to the Ministry - Sirius Black is pardoned. He doesn&#39;t return to Grimmauld Place - he hates it, and doesn&#39;t exactly need to hide out now! - but instead takes up residence in Hogsmeade. He and Remus get together quite often.<br><br>No Dementors are on the scene, so Harry never learns to conjure a Patronus. Nor does he receive the Maurauders&#39; Map - the twins gave it to him because he wasn&#39;t allowed to visit Hogsmeade, which isn&#39;t the case now. Instead, he spends a lot of time hanging out with Hopfoot (^_~) and Moony.<br><br>Meanwhile, Voldemort has basically given up; he&#39;s hanging out in Albania with only Nagini for company. And who else will come looking for him? The only other faithful Death Eater is Barty Crouch Jr... who occasionally breaks free of his <i>Imperius</i> prison.<br><br>So: the World Cup is still interrupted by the Dark Mark, but Voldemort isn&#39;t there to get Barty out permanently. Year 4 is frankly boring: the Triwizard Tournament takes place, and is won by Cedric Diggory (who came second in the first task, and first in the other two). Mad-Eye Moody - the real one! - is a terrifying DADA teacher. He probably <i>does</i> teach Harry the Patronus charm, and Sirius helps him refine it. Sometime in this year, I suspect Harry becomes an unregistered Animagus, to be more like his father (and with prompting from Sirius).<br><br>In Year 5, Barty Jr escapes his father, and goes looking for Voldemort. Barty Sr covers it up (of course). Sirius Black teaches DADA at Dumbledore&#39;s request (yay, no Umbridge!). And around springtime, Barty finds Voldemort. He brings him back to England and they follow, essentially, Wormtail&#39;s plan: the potion. That means they need Harry Potter&#39;s blood - but a Harry Potter who is a year older, an Animagus, and hasn&#39;t even thought much about Voldemort since his first year.<br><br>So they orchestrate a breakout from Azkaban - a subtle one, replacing the prisoners with fake substitutes - and use the freed Death Eaters to run a kidnap attempt. They grab Harry in Hogsmeade, take his blood, restore Voldemort, and Voldemort challenges Harry to a duel. <i>Priori Incantatem</i> kicks in... but there&#39;s no Portkey to hand. As the ghosts appear around them, Voldemort grabs Barty&#39;s wand and kills Harry.<br><br>Or so he thinks. He manages to kill his own accidental horcrux, and knocks Harry out long enough that Team Voldemort leave, but then Harry revives and stumbles back to Hogwarts. He tells Dumbledore everything.<br><br>Going into the sixth year, we&#39;re in a place only subtly different from the canon. Voldemort is back; the Ministry refuses to believe it; Dumbledore starts hunting horcruxes. But Grimmauld Place is a Death Eater hangout, Sirius is a friend of Hogwarts, and - perhaps crucially - Harry no longer has a piece of Voldemort in his head. He can&#39;t see what Voldemort sees.<br><br>Anyone want to take it from that point?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Crouch, Jr. escaping is speculation on your part.  If anything, after the sudden, public reveal of a Death Eater who was formerly presumed an innocent victim, Crouch, Sr. would almost certainly increase his efforts to keep his son under wraps.<br><br>And even if Junior did escape, there&#39;s no guarantee he&#39;ll find Voldemort, since the latter wouldn&#39;t have Wormtail assisting him in the locomotion department.  I still say the Hopfoot!Sirius timeline prevents Riddle from returning to power.  Second Great Wizarding War: averted!<br><br>* * *
<br>Probably unrelated, but uh . . . I had a bunny nightmare last night.  The rabbit was mostly white with some brown in the back, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Hopfoot from his AU coming to haunt/spite me . . .  Anyway, some repairman came to the zoo to fix chain link fences, but needed someone to watch his rabbit at the gift shop.  I volunteered, not realizing how long he would be gone.  Eventually, the zoo opened, and I got in trouble when someone called over the radio and everyone found out the Adventureland buildings hadn&#39;t been opened to the public yet.<br><br>It also had huge teeth, and kept nipping slices of skin off my hands.  So yeah.  Bunny nightmare.<br><br>—doctorlit is pretty sure the dream rabbit represents his inability to let go off small details to focus on the big picture</p>

            <p>This might not sound exciting at first, but please bear with me. <a href="http://beyondbeliefgames.webs.com/documents/A5_Tales.pdf/">This</a> is an RP where you play as animals - not humanoid animals, but just woodland animals with twelve species to choose from (including gnomes as a playable species!) in a place called <i>The Wood.</i> You are creatures of <i>The Way,</i> followers of goodness and the right way of nature, fighting against other predatory forest creatures who are filled with a dark force called <i>The Bane,</i> and you must fight to survive on various quests.<br><br>Having a good character be tainted with <i>The Bane</i> is a possibility. Death of characters is indeed a possibility, and there are no maps necessary for this RP either. Sure, it doesn&#39;t sound like much, but if you&#39;re the type that likes to read about intelligent, adventuring yet natural animals via classics like &quot;Watership Down&quot; and the like, then I recommend this RP. And if nothing else will convince you, then me just reading the rulebook made me feel like a kid again with its certain quality of charm that the RP seems to be permeated with.<br><br>Gonna be honest here: I really want to try an RP as I&#39;ve never participated in one before, and I believe this would be a great way to start.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s probably the next day for many of you. Well, better late than never. <br><br>On September 8, 1966, the first episode of Star Trek aired. This is a big deal for me because I am a new fan of the show and somewhat emotionally fragile. I assume some of you get excited about this too?<br><br>This anniversary also provides me a convenient excuse to post about a Star Trek cosplay skit/party I participated in a couple weeks ago. My friend was leaving the country, and all our friends wanted to have a going-away party for her. She and I had watched the first two seasons of Star Trek together and somehow wound up really shipping Kirk and Spock (I can explain why <i>at length</i>. Don&#39;t get me started), so we decided to stage a wedding for them. I played Spock; she played Kirk. It was hilarious. I want to post photos, but I have to wait to hear back from everyone and make sure they&#39;re okay with having photos of themselves waltzing in cosplay floating around the Internet (this post is really mostly a placeholder). If you guys are interested, I can also post a copy of the wedding vows I wrote, which are basically just me making fun of Kirk, Spock, and Star Trek in general. <br><br>--Key has never started a thread before and feels the weight of the occasion</p>

            <p>As it turns out, I really enjoyed this mission, even though I personally would&#39;ve kept it to an exorcism rather than an assassination. It just bugs me when it seems like it only takes the slightest excuse to cry character replacement and go for a kill. That&#39;s... really the only negative comment I have, though. The jokes were lighthearted and funny, and the character interactions were really great, especially Miguel and Valon geeking out together. If they&#39;re not friends already, it seems like they should be. Overall, a very positive, fun-to-read tone. {= )<br><br>Also, eee, Nume almost-name-drop. (Nume-drop?) You made my heart feel warm and fuzzy. ^__^ Renge meeting him would be absolutely frigging hilarious, and I hope I find some way to make that happen now.

            <p>I like how Keiko and your old team dealt with this old shame of yours (especially the &quot;chibi versions&quot;).<br><br>Alas, you still have this a/an problem I may have mentioned previously:<br><br><i>Corolla rubbed her chin in thought for a bit before opening <b>an</b> holographic window.</i><br>Should be &quot;a holographic window&quot; (you got it right the other four times).<br><br><i>KITT is black and can move silently, but it’s still a car going around in <b>a</b> empty city.</i><br>Should be &quot;an empty city&quot;.<br><br><i>That’s <b>an</b> heavy-duty military truck.</i><br>Should be &quot;a heavy-duty military truck&quot;.<br><br><i>&quot;Hm? What’s funny?&quot; Corolla asked, raising <b>a</b> eyebrow.</i><br>Should be &quot;an eyebrow&quot;.<br><br>Other technical errors I noticed:<br><br><i>The quartet ended up in front <b>of big</b>, generic palace surrounded by a tall wall.</i><br>I guess there is an &quot;a&quot; missing.<br><br><i>Icy looked like she wanted to say something, but the bad writing was clearly affecting her thought processes. &quot;Uh... Yes. Go on with <b>your your</b> patrol,&quot; she managed in the end.</i><br>Well, that may actually be the bad writing affecting Icy’s speech process, too.<br><br><i>&quot;Ok, where the hell we are?&quot; Sergio asked.</i><br>&quot;I wonder where we are&quot; would be correct, but in a question, word order should be reversed: &quot;Ok, where the hell are we?&quot;<br><br>HG</p>
