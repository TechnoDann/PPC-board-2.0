            <p>It seems like it is possible to just use the disguise generator to fix any physical maladies that you have.  Too fat to run?  Just give yourself a better body.

            <p>The Disguise Generator, to my understanding as someone who&#39;s never written a story, is meant to serve one purpose: To make the mission work with established canon, thus protecting the people using it.<br><br>Example: Jay and Acacia mostly used Uruk-hai disguises in the Original Series because they could believably kill Fellowship members in-story where members of other races most likely wouldn&#39;t.<br><br>The Disguise Generator is not meant to grant crazy-overpowered abilities (although it can). It&#39;s not meant to experiment with a new body (although that&#39;s a fun aspect of writing it). Its purpose is to make the mission work with canon and not attract attention: That is, to disguise the Agents in question.</p>

            <p>I know we&#39;ve generally moved away from the Uruk-hai, reasonable enemy kill-style of disguise, but there&#39;s no denying that part of Jay and Acacia&#39;s early creation of the generator was to fit in with the theme of canon compliance.  OCs enter a world, and are loud and attention-grabbing and put themselves before the world.  Agents enter missions to put the world before themselves, and are quiet and try to keep out of the way until they absolutely can&#39;t anymore.<br><br>—doctorlit apparently had all these philosophical opinions about disguise generators he wasn&#39;t aware of</p>

            <p>I admit that I&#39;m somewhat guilty of exploiting the DORKS. Valon disguised himself as a Dalek once.<br><br>The key thing is, what Valon relies on is his wits. And just because he&#39;s been given a stronger body doesn&#39;t necessarily mean he&#39;ll be any better at fighting; even if he were disguised as, I don&#39;t know, an Ork, his aim wouldn&#39;t be any better and he&#39;d still be really clumsy with a weapon.<br><br>He prefers to leave the actual combat (when it&#39;s necessary) to Kala, and relies on trickery and guile to deal with his problems.<br><br>And the DORKS can actually be part of that. In the mission I mentioned, Valon disguises himself as a Dalek not to fight, but to get the attention of a whole bunch of fake Daleks and lure them into a trap. Instead of using the DORKS as a blunt instrument of pain, he uses it to augment his trickery.</p>

            <p>The decision of what disguise to use, or even to use one at all, can serve many roles in a mission.  They can reveal an agent&#39;s opinions on the culture(s) they&#39;re about to enter, or even whole aspects of their personality they couldn&#39;t express in their regular body.  (Hemlock, anyone?)  Following from this, it allows the chance for discussion, or even outright disagreement, between the partners, which can potentially feed into a plot throughout the mission.<br><br>But best of all, locking your agents into a single disguise for the extent of the mission places a restriction on you as the writer.  As Mark Rosewater says, restrictions breed creativity, forcing you to come up with clever solutions to any unseen problems the disguise leads to.  Especially in crossovers: do you pick something that appears in both worlds, but may not be optimal in either?  Something unique to only one of the worlds, and force the agents to be extra cautious in the other?<br><br>Now the DORKS?  Yeah, I do consider that overpowered.  It pretty much removes all the narrative strengths above by giving the agents a free, easy solution to any disguise related problem.  That&#39;s why I chose long ago never to give my agents one.  In fact, I&#39;m going to start having my agents collect a set of costumes they can use when only their fashion needs to change.  More restrictions!  More creativity!<br><br>—doctorlit wrote this outdoors and kept passing out in the heat; many odd squiggle words had to be backspaced away.</p>

            <p>I think what DCCCV said is certainly part of it. Yes, the Disguise Generator can certainly be overpowered - but, since we&#39;re the ones writing the stories, we have the responsibility to avoid that. Very similar, in fact, to the TARDIS. Doctor Who episodes that are poorly written <i>do</i> tend to overpower the Doctor by overpowering the TARDIS or sonic screwdriver. Or, say, giving a secondary character the power to <i>rewrite the memory of <b>the entire species of Daleks, making an abs--</b></i> *ahem* Er, sorry, got a bit off topic there. <br><br>Point is, almost anything can make the agents in a fic overpowered. That&#39;s why good writing is imperative - write the Disguise Generator well is part of writing a PPC team well. </p>

            <p>To my knowledge, it is entirely possible to use The Disguise generator for that, but that is not the DORKS&#39; intended purpose. You could definitely use it to keep yourself in optimal shape, and that would make for a great character flaw. Why have you brought this subject up, exactly? If you are going to be exploiting this, the DORKS may need to be changed, but if you will not be, I assume that no one else would. It&#39;s an integral part of what makes this organization The PPC, like The Pokeball to Pokemon, or the TARDIS to Doctor Who.</p>

            <p>...OK why? I mean, first off, Agent isn&#39;t the only job there is, nor is it a particularly glamorous or rewarding one, let&#39;s be real. More importantly, the PPC a) has a ton of disabled Agents one way or another, and b) has a great medical program. If they&#39;re unhealthy to the point where they can&#39;t move or have cardiac problems or whatever, then Medical should be able to help, if they&#39;re healthy enough that that kind of medical intervention isn&#39;t needed then... there&#39;s really no problem. PPC doesn&#39;t care how pretty you are, as long as you can get the job done, and there&#39;s any number of ways to do that job. <br></p>

            <p>The disguise generator and the DORKS are not the same thing. The disguise generator is part of the console, and (the way I&#39;ve always written it) it takes effect when the agents step through the portal. Before the invention of the DORKS, it was not possible to change your disguise once you were in the fic; you&#39;d have to go back to your RC to do that.<br><br>The DORKS, on the other hand, is a handheld device you can take with you into the fic to switch disguises on the fly. It operates on the disguise generator back in HQ the same way the remote activator operates on the portal generator.<br><br>At least, that&#39;s always been my understanding.<br><br>Also, exploiting the devices (or not) is totally on the writer. If you wanted to write an OP agent and erase all their flaws, you could do that—and you&#39;d be critiqued heavily for it, or ought to be.<br><br>Or you can do what I do and always have the character&#39;s physical disability manifest in their disguise, too. Derik is always blind in one eye, no matter what. The reasons and the appearance of his scars may change to be setting-appropriate, but he&#39;s still half blind, because it&#39;s part of his character and I think it would be pretty silly to give a character a physical disability just to take it away at the first opportunity.<br><br>Another note, maybe unrelated: I&#39;ve never had my agents remain in disguise in HQ; the disguise always drops when they come out of the portal. That&#39;s another style choice. I know others have written it differently.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... the disguise generator as drawing a 1:1 correlation between body-parts. It will transform your feet into paws, or your hair into leaves, but it won&#39;t and can&#39;t transform the stump of an arm into a hand, or a missing eye into a working one. It doesn&#39;t have the material to work from, or your residual self image is too strong to let it repair you, or your morphic field won&#39;t accommodate the new part, or whatever other techmagbabble you come up with.<br><br>This is supported by Acacia&#39;s experience with the arrow, and also by I-think-it&#39;s-better-that-way. It&#39;s probably contradicted by someone being burnt down to a disembodied brain but restored through a disguise somewhere, but luckily we&#39;re only loosely sharing a canon, so I can ignore that. ^_^<br><br>(It also explains why regeneration locks you in your new body: it scrambles your cells, meaning if you changed back, you&#39;d probably be a bucket of goo. The disguise generator won&#39;t change you back if you&#39;d die on changing - that&#39;s bad for business.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Given the precedent of the TV movie, they could probably still regenerate if their partner got them back to HQ and out of disguise before too long. They&#39;d probably have the same amnesia Eight did, though.<br><br>Alternately: regeneration is an intrinsic property of them, rather like Selene&#39;s vampirism. If they set the disguise up correctly, they would regenerate as normal. They might find side-effects, such as their regeneration sharing traits with their disguise instead of their normal body (such as species), or a change in the number of regenerations left, or finding their entire new personality informed solely by what happened while wearing the disguise...<br><br>Basically, the answer is the same as always: whatever&#39;s funniest. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Thank you, SDCC, for bringing us something new! The trailer is fresh outta oven so let&#39;s dissect it!<br><br>But we need to watch it first... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdgQj7xcDJo">HERE</a><br><br>Let the analysis BEGIN!<br><br><b>[0:02]</b> We open up with an investigator (from the way they talk I assume he&#39;s a <s>Muggle</s> No-Maj?) talking about something that escaped. Something that was &quot;like a ghost&quot;. We also see Percival Graves, the faithful hound of Supreme Leader Picquery, on the scene.<br>Since, most likely, the most dangerous of Newt&#39;s creatures &quot;dove underground&quot; and now it tearing through New York like it&#39;s nothing, this is probably not a Sasquatch, as I&#39;ve previously assumed (although it is still confirmed to appear in the first film; played by Jason Newell).<br><br><b>[0:31]</b> We heard President Pickles talking about &quot;strange things&quot; happening around New York, and we see future Mrs. Scamander, probably when she was still an Auror for the MACUSA.<br><br><b>[0:36]</b> A House Elf...spinning cotton... Umm... Can I...not comment on that?<br><br><b>[0:38]</b> We see the MACUSA Court at what I assume to be a full assembly. Maybe Newt&#39;s trial will commence shortly?<br><br><b>[0:41]</b> This is Tina...knocking at a painting? This may be just stereotypes, but the red hair and green eyes (?) make me instantly think of Ireland, so I assume that&#39;s Isolt Sayre, founder of Ilvermorny? The school supposedly plays part in the film.<br><br><b>[0:43]</b> Wizard mobster playing poker in an illegal brewery? Previous trailer showed us a fight scene there.<br><br><b>]0:54]</b> The first creature escapes the case and attacks Jacob Kowalski. I have absolutely no idea what <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rKtB767.jpg"><u>this</u></a> is. After slowing the video down, it resembles some kinda pig (even screeches like one), but smaller with thick shaggy coat of fur?

It&#39;s not a basilisk, that&#39;s for sure, and it doesn&#39;t look like a dragon... but this may be a <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Cockatrice">cockatrice</a> - like the one from the 1792 Triwizard Tournament. But I don&#39;t know if this is also not our &quot;main&quot; creature that spreads chaos.<br><br><b>[01:18]</b> We have what I assume is a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0ySKUG7.jpg">female House Elf</a>, dressed like a show girl, in a speakeasy. Also, the smoke clouds look like Billywigs.<br><br><b>[01:20]</b> And this is <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SFJsMWL.png">Gnarlack</a>, the owner of aforementioned fine establishment.<br><br><b>[01:30]</b> Huh... Looks like President Pickles actually <i>cares</i> for her Wizarding community...either that, or she wants to keep peace at any cost. Also, to any of my American friends, what does <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IUuTGI8.jpg">this</a> looks like to you? Does she want to contain the magical beasts? Or contain the No-Majes from interfering?<br><br><b>[01:43]</b> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/X1bcIr0.jpg">THAT</a> is an albino...griffin?

I assume this to be the most dangerous creature, but more on that below.<br><br>We see the lights going off and...<br><br>And the climax of the trailer. At <b>[02:07]</b> we see the same swirling mess of smoke and destruction, tearing through New York like hot knife through butter. As mentioned at the beginning, it does look like a ghost. THIS is what I assume to be the most dangerous of Newt&#39;s creatures. But what is it...? Well, there&#39;s one more creature confirmed to appear in the first film:<br><br>The <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Lethifold">Lethifold</a> - a &quot;cousin&quot; of the Dementors. I may be completely wrong, and the thing that destroys New York may be something completely different, but as Lethifold was confirmed to appear, with its rank of XXXXX, it&#39;s the most lethal creature in the entire film. <br><br>Now it&#39;s time for you, folks.

            <p>So I&#39;ve just read, for the very first time, <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>.<br><br>[Pause for screaming]<br><br>Actually, I&#39;ve just read for the very first time everything from <i>Goblet of Fire</i> onwards, but that&#39;s-<br><br>[More screaming]<br><br>-BUT THAT&#39;S not relevant. It&#39;s DH that I have a question about.<br><br>Is there any consensus as to who or what the &#39;wretched creature&#39; hanging out in Ghostly King&#39;s Cross was? Dumbledore refuses to say (except that it&#39;s pointless to waste pity on or try to help). I wondered if it was Voldemort, but a) he&#39;s still alive (though maybe unconscious), and b) Dumbledore is clear that the Horcrux-fragments are &#39;destroyed&#39;, not just dead.<br><br>So then I wondered if it could be Grindelwald? They do talk about him a fair bit, he has only recently died, and he and Dumbledore have A History, so it would explain why Albus was hanging out with him.<br><br>Or is it someone or something else? I can&#39;t really think of anything that would fit (the spirit of the first owner of the Elder Wand?), but...<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Oh, but this version of <i>Deathly Hallows</i> has the best ending. The much-debated epilogue ends at the bottom of the front side of the very last page. I turn it over, and see, printed large on the inside back cover itself, JKR standing by her desk with a smirk on her face that seems to say, &quot;Yep, I just did that. Nope, you can&#39;t argue it away. Yep, it&#39;s canon now.&quot;<br><br>I tried to find a copy of the picture online, but honestly, she <i>always</i> smirks like that. <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=jk+rowling&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1529&amp;bih=732&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8jL-R15DOAhWhNJoKHYBuBJEQ_AUIBygC">Look at all the pictures!</a><br><br>hS (again)</p>

            <p>Do you disagree with the source you quote or does &quot;that had latched onto Harry&quot; not mean what I think it means?<br><br>Connected through the blood that Voldemort used in his revival in GF, Harry and Voldemort share a near-death experience in a place that Harry visualizes as King’s Cross station. What Harry sees there is the last piece of Voldemort’s soul that still resided in Voldemort’s body; Harrycrux is already destroyed like all the other Horcruxes except Naginicrux.<br><br>Voldemort faces a fate truely worse than death there. His maimed soul, being totally immobile left to its own devices, could neither move on (how would it board the train?) nor turn its back to the next great adventure and return as a ghost. That’s what Harry refers to when he, during the final battle, asks Voldemort to repent and mend his soul.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I knew you&#39;d be round soon.<br><br>So it&#39;s... let&#39;s see, one of the two pieces of Voldemort&#39;s soul that still exists - the bit that&#39;s in his own body (&quot;When Voldemort attacks Harry, they both fall temporarily unconscious, and both their souls – Harry’s undamaged and healthy, Voldemort’s stunted and maimed – appear in the limbo&quot; - ie, it&#39;s Voldemort-proper, not the bit stuck in Harry). The one inside Harry is kablooied by that point, but there&#39;s still a chunk stuck in Nagini.<br><br>But... if that&#39;s the case, why didn&#39;t Voldemort realise Harry wasn&#39;t dead? If they were both in limbo, where Harry could hear Voldemort&#39;s whimpering, why didn&#39;t Voldemort hear Harry&#39;s chat with Dumbledore? Is it because, with Nagini still alive, he couldn&#39;t actually die, and so wasn&#39;t properly &#39;in&#39; limbo?<br><br>And... why does Dumbledore say Harry can&#39;t help it and shouldn&#39;t pity it, when offering redemption to Tom Riddle is part of Harry&#39;s end-game plan?

            <p><i>Why didn&#39;t Voldemort realise Harry wasn&#39;t dead?</i><br><br>Maybe this baby-like creature is even more helpless than a newborn, unable to see, hear and comprehend what’s going on? Voldemort may not even remember the experience.<br><br>Concerning Dumbledore, I guess he is not really there. It’s all in Harry’s head (but based on reality), and Harry tries to do what he is used to do near the end of every book except HBP. But since Dumbledore is only imagined, he can’t actually tell Harry anything Harry can’t figure out on his own. Harry may still get things wrong and change his mind later.<ul>
<li>Most obviously, Harry is not yet aware that Dumbledore hadn’t planned to make Snape the new Master of the Elder Wand; he realizes only later that dying undefeated so that nobody can become the wands new master would be the best plan and is probably what Dumbledore intended.<br>
</li>
<li>Harry is not ready to admit that the golden spell that saved him from Voldemort on the flight from 4 PD was Voldemort’s soul piece using Voldemort’s magic imbued in Harry’s wand to protect itself. (That’s only my theory, afaik never confirmed by JKR.)<br>
</li>
<li>His view of Dumbledore tainted by Rita Skeeter’s poison, Harry may believe that Dumbledore wouldn’t try to redeem Voldemort, but being Harry, he has to do it anyway.</li>
</ul>
<br>And since it’s all in Harry’s head, Voldemort’s experience in his head may actually have been different.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>In the other trailer, there&#39;s a big shot of someone reading a newspaper. <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/The_New_York_Ghost">You can find it here</a>.<br><br>The big, eye-catching WANTED poster tells of a 3500 dragot reward for the arrest of one Alberto Macellarius (aka &#39;The Rat&#39;), for the crimes of &#39;counterfeiting wands and murder&#39;.

If he happens to splinch himself while Apparating down the stairs, well, tough luck.<br><br>MACUSA: looking out for YOU. As in, &#39;we see you when you&#39;re sleeping...&#39;<br><br>hS</p>

It feels like a restaurant running a sign that says &#39;This week, all our meals are non-toxic&#39;.

I feel like normally this kind of sentence would use prosecute as a verb (as in, trespassers will be); here it&#39;s showing up in a phrase that sounds very much like &#39;we&#39;ll take care of any witnesses&#39;.

            <p>On point 2, I don&#39;t know how it works specifically, but I&#39;m pretty sure prosecutors work for the government as part of the justice system, right? That&#39;s how you get things like State of Whatever vs. This Guy Who Killed Some Folks. The victims don&#39;t pay the lawyers, not in criminal court. <br><br>That said, wizards are weird. I don&#39;t <i>think</i> real life criminal prosecutor lawyers work as a part of a police department, but it could be that Auror stations have a few lawyers on-staff and they handle the cases that the Aurors bring in, which would cause bias. <br><br>Do you think MACUSA has laws about the whole &#39;if you can&#39;t afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you&#39; thing?</p>

            <p>It&#39;s definitely quackery, but putting the worst offense last makes sense to me: you save the last position in a list for the item that will make the biggest impact, the thing you most want your readers to remember.<br><br>I don&#39;t see that they asked the populace to try to capture him, either.

That would clearly imply they&#39;ll pay you less if you just tell them where he is.<br><br>On looking closer, I think the final sentence reads &#39;MACUSA officers have conclusive evidence and will take care of the prosecution&#39;, but it could be &#39;are/now collecting evidence&#39;. Which... well, the latter reading totally supports your view that they&#39;re just out to get him; the former is quite obviously code for &#39;we can prove he did the wand-counterfeits, so we&#39;ll hang the murder on him too - who&#39;s going to argue?&#39;.<br><br>&quot;Vote President Pickles for Most Popular MACUSA President of the Year!&quot;<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViuDsy7yb8M">Teaser Trailer</a> (TT)<br><br>-At TT 0:26, we see the strappy dress Female wears in the speakeasy and poster scenes.<br><br>-Around TT 0:29 we see the bank that Newt Disapparates from (I think) in the current trailer. Maybe <i>that&#39;s</i> the big columny building? It has a small front door that looks out into an open space, so it could fit.

TT 1:11 shows Female, Blonde, Newt, and Muggle (I assume he&#39;s a Muggle?) outside what seems to be the speakeasy - at least, the strappy dress is there. It&#39;s not a continuous shot - Female lowers her glowing wand between frames - so maybe this is where the portrait is.<br><br>-Shaw&#39;s big do seems to take place in the columny building (TT 1:18).

            <p>-Location data!<br><br>--We get a shot down the street from the house that got destroyed, but it doesn&#39;t show any obvious landmarks.<br>--When Newt comes in we get a lovely skyline shot. It took a bit of searching, but <a href="https://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/tag/steamships-of-new-york-city/">this postcard</a> shows the same spot: Lower Manhattan, as seen from the Hudson. Good, so we&#39;re definitely in New York. ^<em>^<br>--The building with the ornate facade in the next shot (MACUSA HQ?) looks like it must be a real place, but I don&#39;t know how to find it. <br>-When Newt walks down the street (0:47), we see a fairly distinctive flat-topped skyscraper in the background. Anyone know it?<br>--Ice skating! Central Park, maybe?<br>--A couple of quick flashes of places, but nothing to pin down.<br>--That glowing line. Is that a defence system, or a trace on the creature? Correction, three creatures: there&#39;s two little lines growing separately to the main one. Either way, it clearly marks where the action takes place. I&#39;ve traced it out approximately on the map: the lower small line comes straight out of the Empire State Building.<br>--Bridge. Clearly the ice skating scene again. If we&#39;re down on Lower Manhattan (as the map suggests), maybe it&#39;s <i>not</i> Central park after all.<br>--Thunderbird taking off in front of a very nice building. Some sort of library or museum, or maybe government? Intriguingly, it looks like Thunderbird is actually coming <i>out of the ground</i> here (next to the Subway); that&#39;s strange, and suggests it&#39;s more than just an escaped creature. Or is it flying away from the collapse?<br>-Somewhere with lots of neon. One readable sign is for Arrow Collars, which seems to be &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The</a></em>Arrow<em>Collar</em>Man&quot;&gt;this</a>. &#39;Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co&#39; sounds wizardly to me. ^_^ The other signs (&#39;NOW SHO&#39;) suggest maybe Broadway? Which puts us down below the line on the map before.<br>--Oh, yeah, that must by Broadway. There&#39;s a sign ending &#39;PHEUM&#39;, and there&#39;s an Orpheum Theatre in New York. Okay, it&#39;s actually not on Broadway itself, but the samge general area.<br>--And there we are, third time lucky: it&#39;s Times Square. Or maybe it just has the box-office for it? Regardless, this is where the potential Lethifold is playing around.<br>--And then we&#39;re back to the &#39;museum&#39; from earlier, and some awesomely-dressed shooty guys. Still no idea where it is.<br><br>Okay, so that... didn&#39;t reveal much. On to Other Stuff.<br><br>-Alas, there&#39;s not a lot of MACUSA shenanigans in this one. They do seem to have an undercover investigator type, so clearly their dedication to staying out of Muggle business is partly put-on, but other than that...<br>-The sewing scene: did you notice that the blonde woman changes into the blue dress mid-scene? Guess that explains the look on Newt&#39;s face.<br>-The &#39;Lethifold&#39;: that doesn&#39;t match the description of a Lethifold at all. It&#39;s not sneaking up on you and eating you while you sleep: it&#39;s burrowing underground, smashing stuff, and throwing cars. I also get a hint of claws from some of the frames; I&#39;m almost thinking &#39;giant mantis&#39;. Are there any insectoid Fantastic Beasts? Though it does have the Dementor shadow effect...<br><br>Now, that painting:<br>-It could be Isolt. That would probably imply we&#39;re heading to Ilvermorny, when there&#39;s no hint anywhere else that we&#39;re leaving Lower Manhattan.<br>-Could it be the blonde lady from a bit later? Probably not - Female Lead is wearing a strappy dress in the portrait shot, but a coat in the blonde&#39;s.<br>-It seems to be a poster on a brick wall; could it be the entrance to the speakeasy? It <i>is</i> immediately followed by a shot of gambling. That would make it nobody in particular. It&#39;s a bit Art Nouveau in style, which makes it a little outdated for the &#39;20s. Actually, Female Lead is wearing the strappy dress in the speakeasy, so I&#39;m going with this answer.<br>-Regardless of who it is, there&#39;s at least two people standing outside it - one clips out of the right-hand side of the shot as we zoom in. That makes it Newt and Female - and in the speakeasy shot, it looks like Newt (out of focus in the background) might have an injured right hand.<br><br><br>And...<br>-Shaw. Do we know the name Shaw? He&#39;s America&#39;s Future, I hear. He doesn&#39;t seem to be a real US politician (ie, there&#39;s no relevant Wiki page), so I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s one of those evil witchhunters. Did we know this already?<br><br>In conclusion: Newt Scamander is the Eleventh Doctor in disguise. That is all.<br><br>hS</p>

<li>MACUSA HQ is located in real-life Woolworth Building. So yeah, Broadway.<br><br>- The blonde is Queenie, older sister of Tina (future Mrs. Scamander).<br><br>- The first trailer released had Newt, the Goldstein sisters, and Jacob Kowalski the <s>Muggle</s> No-Maj all knocking on the solid iron door and entering I assume a speakeasy.<br><br>- Yes, we do know the name Shaw. Henry Shaw, Sr., is an American No-Maj. His son, Shaw, Jr., is a senator.

            <p>I can confirm that the archy door is the entrance to the Woolworth Building, and therefor to MACUSA. (The archy one, not the columny one.)

            <p>Then again, he has an Australian billywig, so why no a Thunderbid? <br><br>But, if you look at the scene where the Thunderbird flies away, it looks as if it came out of that hole in the ground.

            <p>That a lethifold will appear in the movie? I mean, it would be awesome if it did, but I haven&#39;t heard anything about it and a quick Google search just brings up speculation about what we&#39;ll get to see. Not to mention, how would a people-eating blanket known for slipping under doorways cause that much destruction, or why? I think, if anything, it would be something new we haven&#39;t seen in the book.<br><br><s>also lethifolds aren&#39;t confirmed to be cousins of the dementor, that&#39;s just speculation</s><br><br>I like the nogtail idea, though.

            <p>At least that&#39;s what one of the <i>Pottermore</i> writers, who was present on the set, wrote:<br><br>&quot;<i>because if there’s one thing on this set more terrifying than a Lethifold, it’s accidentally being in shot.</i>&quot;<br><br>Also, yeah I know that they aren&#39;t confirmed to be related.

            <p>A friend of mine recently mentioned a book to me during a discussion about the disgusting requests I&#39;ve received over the years for fanfic.  The most egregious example I brought up was regarding a certain nazi doctor, which led her to ask me if I&#39;d heard of a book about &quot;...blond and blue-eyed Jewess Hadassah Benjamin&quot;.  And yes, that&#39;s from the first line of the summary.  You just know it&#39;s going to be a great, compelling, realistic novel when the Jewish protagonist is &quot;pressed into service by SS-Kommandant Colonel Aric von Schmidt at the transit camp of Theresienstadt&quot; and &quot;battling a growing attraction for this man she knows she should despise as an enemy.&quot;<br></p>

One of our betas has had to back out after a private discussion with a certain steel birb, so we were wondering if anyone was willing to take his place. Canon knowledge of Steven Universe, Naruto, Fairy Tail, and One Piece is desirable though not a strict requirement; SPaG and story flow knowledge are absolutely welcome. We only need one more beta, so first come first served.<br><br>If any of you have any of our e-mails, PM us and we&#39;ll be happy to send you our work.

            <p>Since slowly making my way through the PPC library, I was seized with the thought that my work might belong to the ranks of badfic.  With that in mind, I conducted a witch hunt of the old fanfics I had left in the Pit. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7442894/1/Yao">Here</a> is the sole survivor, which I, among other issues, posted on an account that didn&#39;t belong to me, and must therefore accept that it will very likely survive me. <br><br>While I hope it isn&#39;t bad enough to be deemed badfic, I&#39;m probably biased.  That judgment is best left to others. Take a look at it if you&#39;re curious, and hopefully get a cheap chuckle or two. </p>

            <p>I really liked your commentary and realizing how the exorcism would work (or, rather, not work). As for criticisms, I had to cheat and look at HG&#39;s comment; I didn&#39;t want to read the fic in question.

            <p>So, bad things first.<br><br><i>Takes place after</i> Deathly Hallows <i>and a bit before</i> Breaking Dawn<i>, according to Intel.</i><br>For the next five pages I wondered why Charlotte and Ix didn’t wonder how Intel got to this conclusion, until I was forced to read the badfic and found that they were still in a prologue set years earlier than the actual fic. Saying something like &quot;but we have to go through a prologue first&quot; would have been appreciated. <br><br><br><i><b>... At least he&#39;d have someone to confide in.</b><br><br>“See?” Charlotte said, pointing. “Proof that vampirism makes you stupid.”<br><br>Ix tilted her head. “This might just me being prejudiced, but this does not sound very Hufflepuffy of him. Then again, he’s Cedward, not Cedric, so…”<br><br>“Yeah, Cedric would have probably asked his Hufflepuff friends for help if he turned to anyone. Definitely not Hermione, since they didn’t really interact in canon.”</i><br><br>What? While agents willfully misunderstanding the fic when it’s ambiguous or unclear may be fun, this is not the case here. If somebody had found out that Cedward is a vampire, but had not revealed this to anybody else, she would literally be the only person he could confide in, i. e. discuss how to survive the First Task while keeping his vampire abilities secret. It doesn’t matter whether he would rather ask his Hufflepuff friends, or how much he and Hermione interacted in canon. The fic is internally consistent here. Hermine noticed something suspicious, started to investigate and to interact with Cedward, and is, as far as Cedward knows, the only person who may find out his secret anyway. Are Charlotte and Ix more stupid than Cedward, not seeing that he is perfectly reasonable, or are they just malevolent?<br><br>(After reading the badfic’s prologue, I realized that the agents may actually be more concerned with the next sentence, <b>And she would probably have the answers to his questions, being he intelligent Gryffindor that she was</b>, but how are we supposed to know this when you cut the quote short? Missing this context, I thought more in the way of using Hermione as a sort of &quot;beta reader&quot; for Cedwards ideas than plainly have her solve his problems. And since the fact that Cedric didn’t need Hermione’s help is covered later anyway, I still believe that the whole section should better have been dropped.)<br><br><br><i>... when the falling letters stopped, they found themselves outside the champions’ tent for the first task. <br><br><b>&quot;Congratulations, Cedric.&quot; Hermione said, joining him at the table in the library ...</b><br>[...]<br>In the tent, surrounded by the other champions, Hermione decided that right then and there was the perfect time to ask Cedward if he was actually a vampire.</i><br><br>You can’t just drop this continuity error on me with no hint whether it’s your or the badfic’s fault. Since I already didn’t trust you anymore, I had to read the badfic, and apparently it is your fault. Hermione meets Cedward in the library at an unspecified time after the First Task, and from there they go on a walk by the lake. I have no idea why your agents went to the champion’s tent. If the Department of Inaccuracies actually existed, the Snow Drop might consider a misrepresenting-the-badfic charge.<br><br><br>Technical error: <i>What friends <b>are</b> she talking about?</i><br>There are two friends, but the person talking is still singular.<br><br><br>All this doesn’t say that I didn’t enjoy the mission, because these two agents are just so good. Highlights:<br><br>Ix’s attempt to use personal experience as canon evidence and Charlotte calling her out.<br><br>The divided-by-one-language cakehole/piehole exchange. (I had to consult my dictionary to get it. Learning never ends.) <br><br><i>She noticed, not for the first time, that her partner smelled like honeysuckle and morning dew and sunlight. Wait. Was that too urple?</i><br>:grin:<br><br><i>”... How the heck do you kill magic, anyway?!”<br>“By telling little kids Santa isn’t real?” Ix suggested.</i><br>:snort:<br><br><i>“I’m honestly not sure if that was a werewolf joke or a vampire joke, but either way was in bad taste.”</i><br>:chuckle:<br><br>(Apparently I lost interest when the actual badfic began; I didn’t take many notes from there on. OOC Hermione in <i>Twilight</i>? Yawn. But your agents made it still bearable.)  <br><br><i>“Is that just a vampire thing or something?” Ix said in annoyance, pulling away when the letters ceased falling. “Being overly grabby and dragging people around?”</i><br>Ha ha, spot-on for <i>Twilight</i> vampires? And now I realize that the repeated downpour of &quot;X&quot;s never felt repetitive, because just when Charlotte protecting Ix began to be boring, you found new variations for your agents’ reactions. <br><br>Exorcising Cedric and Edward from each other. <br><br>Also, Ix unending task: vanish all the lollipops.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Cedward&#39;s thoughts are coherent, so you cannot call him stupid for that.  But why does he insist on using vampiric abilities when the Triwizard Tournament is meant to be a <i>magical</i> contest. (Can we construct a dichotomy between <i>supernatural</i> and <i>magical</i>? Or just insist that the ability to run fast is still <i>physical</i>, even if the speed is superhuman?) So, isn&#39;t this cheating? Ix is right, this doesn&#39;t sound very Hufflepuffy. <br><br>So, thinking about simultaneously using and hiding his vampirism is a stupid waste of time that should better be used to think about a non-cheaty magical solution. And if he really can&#39;t come up with anything on his own, he can safely (or not so safely?) ask his Hufflepuff friends about that. (Actually, taking anybody&#39;s advice should be considered cheating, but apparently all champions ignore this rule to a certain extent.)<br><br>Put this into dialogue, using your agents&#39; words.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I liked this mission. The banter between the two girls was fun to read, and unlike Matt Cipher, I do not think that this went too far into MST territory. And good canon reference, bringing up Krum as a potential boyfriend for Hermione as an alternative to Malfoy.<br><br>On to my usual fare, i.e., spotting SPaG errors, I spotted no SPaG grammatical errors in the English. However, there is a word-choice error:<br><br><i>“Is that just a vampire thing or something?” Ix said in annoyance, pulling away when the letters ceased falling. “Being overly grabby and dragging people around?”<br><br>Charlotte looked slightly <b>mollified</b>. “Sorry,” she said, scuffing her feet on the floor.</i><br><br>&quot;Mollified&quot; means &quot;pacified&quot;. This is clearly not the word you&#39;re going for. You&#39;re trying to say that Ix&#39;s rebuke hit home. Try &quot;crestfallen&quot; instead. <i>Ix</i> might be mollified by the apology.<br><br><br>Note, however, that I specified that I found no errors in the <i>English</i>. I liked Charlotte&#39;s confusion in separating Cedward, but there&#39;s an error in the Spanish:<br><i>“Come on out, Cedric Diggory!” she yelled, whacking Cedward again. “Avaunt and </i>Expelliarmus<i>! Um, </i>Accio<i> Cedric Diggory! The power of Rowling compels you! The power of Meyer rejects you! </i><b>¡Vamanos!</b><i>”</i><br><br>It&#39;s spelled &quot;v<b>á</b>m<b>o</b>nos&quot;.<br><br><br>(If I wanted to be really pedantic, I would add that the correct word would be <i>vaya</i>; <i>vámonos</i> means &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; But obviously, this should be given a pass, since Lottie is scrambling for ways to say &quot;get out of there&quot;; so I&#39;ll stick with noting the spelling errors.)</p>

            <p>It&#39;s great to see this duo again! And, since we&#39;re still in the &quot;Read it? Review it!&quot; Challenge, let&#39;s begin!<br><br><br><br>I&#39;ll start with the good things:<br><br>- Ix&#39;s problem gets solved. Now, I&#39;d personally be in favour of a cane (because canes are cool!), but I guess the brace <i>is</i> more practical.<br><br>- The humor. Running (or should I say &quot;falling&quot;) punctuation gag, the girls&#39; banters (the &quot;bite me&quot; exchange was great), the sugar joke...everything&#39;s on point here. Really nice, light reading. <br><br>- Am I sensing a hint of potential foreshadowing of romance between our leading ladies?<br><br><br>Now onto those things that didn&#39;t exactly click for me:<br><br>- It seemed very light on the actual PPC stuff. Honest to God, while reading this there was a moment in which I&#39;ve forgotten that Ix and Lottie are working for the PP...il the last part with neuralyzation, and one brief mention of CAD. If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d take this mission as a more elaborate form of an MST. I&#39;m not saying, you should mention CADs, departments and RCs every second sentence, but I think something more could be implemented mid-mission.<br><br>- Agent Ix sounding like a veteran. It&#39;s her third mission and she seems quite comfortable with the whole idea of the PPC and hopping into new realities. I kinda feel like she should still have this little bit of disbelief in her. Seems like she accepted everything a little too fast.<br><br>- A very minor detail, but shouldn&#39;t the &quot;cakehole-piehole&quot; thing be reversed? Since Lottie is the one with <i>Supernatural</i> in her fandoms?<br><br><br>In conculsion, this mission was really enjoyable. If I had to rate it, I&#39;d say 8/10.<br><br>P.S.: I was kinda hoping Lottie would secretly snatch some blood pops for herself. Or Ix, since she was curious about the taste.<br></p>

Just reading that I want to brush my teeth.<br><br>-Backstory with holes ready to be filled with more stories. The better sort.<br><br>- Euh nope, still 21 X on the second line, sorry Lottie. <br><br>-Of course they lose IQ, they become rock, of course they&#39;ll become dumb as them.<br><br>-At least Cedward is as dumb as cannon. I... guess it&#39;s positive?<br><br>-Sorry Lottie, but I prefer cake too. Even if it&#39;s a lie.<br><br>-&#39;light side&#39;? Could a Knight of Ren come and put these things down, please? They seem to be experts about this.<br><br>- Well, Meyer fan is now as skilled with writing as Meyer.

Same result, but far more practical.<br><br>-Mode is at the very bottom of my worries, Lottie, and even I can tell you&#39;re off the mark here.<br><br>-I liked the neuralyzations.

            <p>Oh yes, my friends. <i>Robot Wars</i> is back.<br><br>My thoughts:-<br><br>- I love that the House Robots look absolutely terrifying now. They&#39;re <i>enormous</i> and I adore it.<br><br>- The mini-league format gives a lot more fighting in the show, which is probably why it&#39;s only six episodes long come on BBC give us back the nineteen-episode-long Wars a la the Third Wars.<br><br>- Carbide scares me. A worthy successor to Hypno-Disc, even if a bar spinner is less, er... well, less iconic. #SpinToWin<br><br>- Nuts is, and is piloted by people who are, and this is glorious.<br><br>- I had forgotten how much I love Razer. And. Um. I&#39;m having strange feelings about it.<br><br>- Behemoth vs. Carbide is a classic match. #HumOfDeath<br><br>Anyone else watch it? Thoughts? Questions? Fangirling over Razer? Yay!</p>

            <p>There&#39;s been a lot of agitation in this thread. A lot of hyperbolic statements and Internet sabre rattling. So I would like to remind everyone of a simple phrase:<br><br>JUST REPEAT TO YOURSELF &quot;IT&#39;S JUST A SHOW, I SHOULD REALLY JUST RELAX.&quot;<br><br>This is not the end of the world. Nor has J.K. Rowling &quot;sunk her career,&quot; as she&#39;s going to be writing different books and making money off this franchise until she dies. All this rampant hyperbole does not reflect well on this community.<br><br>With that out of the way, there are a few final points I would like to make.<br>— How many of you have actually seen the play, or read the script? From what I can tell, it seems like only one person has actually done that so far. You can&#39;t have an intelligent conversation about something when only one person is in the know. I would recommend that people read the play for themselves (or, if you&#39;re in the UK, go actually see the play). Come to your own conclusions and your own opinions.<br>— As I said in another comment, <i>The Cursed Child</i> is a play, not a book. Stop treating it as a book. You can&#39;t consume the two in the same way.</p>

            <p>Regardless of what Rowling said and may actually have meant when she said it, the flavor that Jack Thorne and John Tiffany added to the story to make it fit the medium and to allow the special effects team to show off cannot affect the base canon that is true in both bookverse and movieverse (and now also in stageverse), just like decisions made for the movieverse don’t affect bookverse canon.<br><br>The misunderstanding apparently was caused by nonsensical <a href="http://time.com/3940287/harry-potter-play-canon">rumors</a> that Harry Potter would be the Cursed Child in <i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i> and that the play would be a prequel to the book series.

            <p>(Because I feel I might&#39;ve left some misunderstandings in my previous posts. Also, I am speaking strictly for myself, not for Ix, nor anyone on this thread, or Twitter/Reddit/anywhere on the Internet that hates/enjoys <i>The Cursed Child</i>)<br><br>I understand there are various elements, which when put together, decide if a play is good or not. The script, the actors, the production crew, the effects, etc. I have not nearly enough knowledge about theater to judge these.<br><br>But I do have enough knowledge about <i>Harry Potter</i> to feel confident about judging the plot of <i>The Cursed Child</i>. Notice I specified &quot;plot&quot;, because that&#39;s what matters to me; how much the information we&#39;ve discovered in TCC are coherent with previously established canon information. I know all of my points may sound biased, but I think I care about this franchise more than an average fan, or a critic that watches it as just a play.<br><br>And maybe the play is brilliant as a stand-alone. Maybe it really is well-made, the production may be great, the actors may be spot on in their roles, but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m focusing on. As someone who grew up with <i>Harry Potter</i>, who was in this world for 15 years, let me tell you PC that it wasn&#39;t nice reading all those new information that now are official and canon. I would react the same way if the same information were given to me on Pottermore website, as a book, or as a movie. That&#39;s what I meant by &quot;the medium doesn&#39;t matter&quot;. The information stay the same.<br><br>tl;dr It&#39;s not the play I&#39;m upset about; it&#39;s the new canon information it&#39;s given us.</p>

            <p>A) Hyperbole is practically the foundation of the PPC and it&#39;s humor.<br>II) I think you over estimate the amount people outside of the community care about the PPC.<br>3) Regardless of the format, criticizing a story is pretty much the same. The Trolly Witch scene is stupid because it doesn&#39;t make sense not because we&#39;re looking at the wrong medium.<br>■) Only one of us has seen a physical copy of the script. I, at least, have read a pirated copy because I refuse to spend money on any more of Rowling&#39;s nonsense and even before the script was available, numerous websites had leaked overviews of the story, spoiling certain details, most of which have proven to be true. Armed with that knowledge I feel people can bemoan this failure of a story to their heart&#39;s content.</p>

            <p>A) Wit. Snarkiness. Terry Pratchett. Those, from what I&#39;ve seen, were the rock upon which the PPC was built. Hyperbole was a side effect.<br><br>II) Perhaps. But what about people looking to join? Or old members? Do they feel the same way?<br><br>3) Not necessarily. I can think of plenty of story elements that only fit in plays, and plenty that only fit in novels. Pretty much any soliloquy played straight, for example, only works in the context of a play. You do that with an otherwise normal character in a novel, the audience is going to start to ask &quot;Is this person bonkers? Why are they talking to themselves so much?&quot; The ending of Romeo and Juliet, written out as a novel, would probably fall flatter than a pancake under a bus.<br><br>As for the scene you bring up, I can&#39;t anything really specific about it &#39;cause I haven&#39;t read or seen the play yet.<br><br>—) Overviews do not a comprehensive reading make. The vast majority of people on the board seem to be going off of the snippets provided by one person. What are the context of those scenes? How do they fit into the play as a whole? Nothing beats looking at the thing itself. Do that, then complain.<br><br>(I&#39;m not even going to bother with the anti-piracy rant.)</p>

            <p>A) Perhaps, but it has become pervasive to the point that complaining about it is slightly rediculous.<br><br>II) If they&#39;re put off by people complaining about something that is objectively bad, albeit in a hyperbolic fashion, they wouldn&#39;t last long anyway.<br><br>3) This ignores the fact that people clearly know this is a script of a play. No one complains about the soliloquies in plays because they know that&#39;s an element of the medium. If someone complains about a soliloquy it&#39;s because the soliloquy was bad not because the person doesn&#39;t understand how plays work. Also how does that change anything about the script being bad?<br><br>—) Okay. I have done that, I am complaining. This is a poorly written story full of plotholes and stupid ideas, which blatantly contradicts established canon, and introduces several frankly distasteful ideas. Being a play does not matter because the very story itself is flawed and does not deserve the hype it has gotten.</p>

            <p>It has a decent rating there, but closer inspection reveals that the &#39;reviews&#39; are mostly hype. I&#39;d leave a rating myself to correct that, but I don&#39;t have a facebook profile. Will anyone who does please help correct the gross misconception that The Cursed Child is worthwhile? </p>

            <p>Or, at the very least, maybe give you an alternate perspective.<br><br>You (and everyone else currently losing their minds in this thread) need to remember that a play is not the same thing as a book. They cannot be consumed the same way. Thinking you can understand everything about a play just by reading the script is like thinking you can understand a song by just reading the sheet music. So much of what makes a play different comes down to performance; to how the actors embody the characters, to how the stage embodies the world as a whole.<br><br>A play is a strange beast, well removed from the normal expectations of literature. They are big, bombastic events with posturing heroes and sneering villains. It&#39;s important to remember that subtlety isn&#39;t a driving force in the theater. Nuance is all very well and good, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily play to the back row. There also won&#39;t be as much time spent on character development and the like. Most of that has to be communicated, as I mentioned before, by the actors.<br><br>From what I&#39;ve seen, almost everyone in this thread has been treating <i>The Cursed Child</i> like a book. Stop doing that. Treat it like a play, as it was meant to be.</p>

            <p>The main problem (at least for me) is not that it&#39;s a play, and I&#39;m just reading a script. It&#39;s that the content revealed in the play is <i>canon</i> to the world of <i>Harry Potter</i>. As in, there really is a daughter of Voldemort, and a rule-breaking Time-Turner, whether <i>The Cursed Child</i> would be a book, a play, or a comic strip in a newspaper. It&#39;s the content that matters most for something that advertises itself as the &quot;eighth story&quot;, not the means of showing it. And the play can be executed beautifully, but would you be willing to accept it if it showed, for example, Dumbledore resurrecting himself and having a hot and steamy affair with Malfoy? That&#39;s basically the same thing.</p>

            <p>And if you truly believe so, then you have a problem. Either that, or you are engaging in wild exaggeration in an attempt to make your point.<br><br>Also, the method of presentation does matter. That&#39;s what shapes the story. Dialogue-driven plays are often much better received than dialogue-driven comic strips. Comics, in turn, are better at showing sights and scenes that couldn&#39;t possibly be performed on a stage.

            <p>Even the worse possible plot is acceptable, as long as it&#39;s presented in a proper manner?

            <p>I understand that the theater has limitations that you don&#39;t get when you read/write a book. I get that. But there was absolutely no need for the play to go out of its way to explicitly contradict canon when it&#39;s supposed to be a direct continuation of the books. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too much to ask that we have some continuity between them.</p>

            <p>I was trying to explain why a &quot;huge number of critics&quot; would praise the play. They don&#39;t necessarily care about every canonical detail and nitpicked point.

            <p>Well... they probably do go to whatever the wizarding equivalent of a hairdresser is. She might have got samples from there. Also, according to the wiki at least, boomslang skin is an unusual ingredient (which is why Hermione also had to break into Snape&#39;s private stores), and it&#39;s not sold in at least the Diagon Alley apothecary (which does not preclude the possibility that it might be sold elsewhere, but it&#39;s something).<br></p>

            <p>I’m quite certain that the books don’t say where you can or can’t buy boomslang skin. Hermione stole ingredients that weren’t included in her second year standard potions lessons kit from Snape’s private store because she couldn’t leave Hogwarts to get them anywhere else.<br><br>The wiki, mixing all media, probably refers to the old, playful version of Pottermore. There, if you had not been sorted into Slytherin, you were stalled in CS 12 (in an animated picture of the entrance to the Slytherin common room) and couldn’t see any content past that point until you had successfully played the game of brewing Polyjuice Potion. This, of course, required to have all necessary ingredients in your inventory, and to make it more like the trio’s experience, you had to find the boomslang skin in an animated picture of Snape’s office in CS 5; you couldn’t simply buy it in the apothecary like many other ingredients.<br><br>Delphi is crazily prepared, considering that she allegedly only just heard about the Time-Turner, but this is not suspicious at all? What are Albus and Scorpius thinking? Unfortunately, we can only read (or hear, if we are lucky and got into the theater) what they say.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>A few things I feel compelled to respond to/miss the point of:<br><br>--Becoming the first Hufflepuff to ever become a Death Eater.<br><br>Hufflepuff still has the records of Slytherin and Gryffindor beat by a mile. Maybe Ravenclaw too, if we knew more about that house.<br><br>...And now I&#39;m imagining each house having an &#39;IT HAS BEEN X YEARS SINCE A STUDENT HAS TURNED TO DARK MAGIC&#39; signs. The larger the number, the more points your house gets at the end of the year. Slytherin has had some trouble recently when Voldemort rose for the first time and their sign kept getting re-set, but at least they&#39;ve started catching up to Gryffindor after the Sirius Black incident. Ravenclaw has the occasional problems with evil geniuses, and Hufflepuff has consistently won the competition, with their numbers reaching into the triple digits. It&#39;s gotten to the point where some of the worse members of other houses have started encouraging Hufflepuffs to go dark just so they&#39;d lose their lead. They&#39;ve always failed... until two unwitting time-travelers provide the final straw. <br><br>That day, there was much confusion among the other three houses as  to whether they should rejoice that Hufflepuff was down at their level at last or be scared of the new Hufflepuff Death Eater. Some brave students even ventured to be sorry for the Hufflepuffs losing one of their best members to the Death Eaters. Nobody&#39;s really unhappy about getting a chance to finally beat Hufflepuff, though.<br><br>-&quot;He needs to fly out of that maze naked on a broomstick made of purple feather dusters.&quot;<br><br>I really want to see somebody pull that off on-stage. That would probably be worth the ticket price even if I have to spend the rest of the time on extended bathroom break. </p>

            <p>Rowling actually isn&#39;t the author of the script. It&#39;s LITERALLY a canon badfic, and how she approved of it is beyond me.

But for many nostalgic readers, this one feels different. “Cursed Child” is not a new novel, but a script of a play — a format that typically isn’t read for pleasure and almost never produces overnight best sellers. And unlike the previous seven books in the series, <b>it was not written by Ms. Rowling herself.</b><br><br>In a sense, “Cursed Child” is more like sanctioned fan fiction than a new work by a beloved writer. <b>Ms. Rowling worked on the play’s plot with the playwright Jack Thorne and the director John Tiffany, and while she helped shape the story, she has made it abundantly clear that she did not write the script.</b><br><br>The idea for the play, which explores Harry’s life as an adult and parent, didn’t originate with Ms. Rowling, either: <b>She merely agreed to it when two theater producers proposed the concept.</b></i><br><br>Sigh. This is exactly why I&#39;m skipping this entire fiasco and reserving my anticipation for Fantastic Beasts instead. Which, incidentally, has a script written by Rowling herself and not somebody else.</p>

            <p><i>The Cursed Child</i> wasn&#39;t hyped up to be the eight book. It was hyped up to be the eight &quot;story&quot; — the official continuation, so naturally people thought Rowling would have a lot more involvement in them. But the form wasn&#39;t important. If it was good and followed the rules established by other installments, it wouldn&#39;t matter if it was a stage play, a movie, or a comic book.<br><br>What&#39;s important is that this thing is canon. JKR greenlit Jack Thorne&#39;s script, so everything that happens in this play is confirmed to happen in Potterverse. As in, Voldemort. having. a bloody daughter. Or Harry being Atticus Finch-ed. Or a trolley witch turning out to be some kind of monster! By approving <i>The Cursed Child</i> JKR contravened everything she had established in previous books. JKR herself stated she didn&#39;t like the idea of Time-Turners in <i>Prisoner of Azkaban</i> (an info that as of now has disappeared from Pottermore):<br><br><i>&quot;I went far too light-heartedly into the subject of time travel in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. While I do not regret it (Prisoner of Azkaban is one of my favourite books in the series), it opened up a vast number of problems for me, because after all, if wizards could go back and undo problems, where were my future plots?<br><br>I solved the problem to my own satisfaction in stages. Firstly, I had Dumbledore and Hermione emphasise how dangerous it would be to be seen in the past, to remind the reader that there might be unforeseen and dangerous consequences as well as solutions in time travel. Secondly, I had Hermione give back the only Time-Turner ever to enter Hogwarts. Thirdly, I smashed all remaining Time-Turners during the battle in the Department of Mysteries, removing the possibility of reliving even short periods in the future.&quot;</i><br><br>But surprise — here&#39;s a brand new Time-Turner that throws to garbage all the rules and limitations! The canon now contradicts itself!<br><br>As for the movies, while they did make minor changes, they still followed the story laid out by Rowling in <u>her</u> stories. They weren&#39;t ideas that came from Columbus&#39;s, or Yates&#39;s heads — they&#39;ve already had the source to work on. I don&#39;t know how much was JKR involved in <i>The Cursed Child</i>&#39;s script, but from the looks of it she might as well have stamped her name only after reading it once.</p>

            <p>Why can’t Voldemort have a daughter? Because he thought he didn’t need and thus didn’t want an heir? That’s irrelevant. Bellatrix wanting his child and he just wanting sex would be sufficient to get it done. You believe that Voldemort was too busy being evil to think about sex? What did he actually do personally during HBP? You think Voldemort was asexual? Sorry, if JKR says he wasn’t then he wasn’t.<br><br>I don’t see what is bad about being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atticus_Finch">Atticus Finch</a>-ed, but then I’m not sure whether I ever read <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>. (If I did, the German translation got a title you probably wouldn’t recognize if I retranslated it, and I don’t remember much of the book I’m thinking of, specifically no protagonist’s names.)  <br><br>The trolley witch actually being an enchanted vending machine that doesn’t have a life beyond the Hogwarts Express and turns into a monster when somebody tries to get off the train early doesn’t contradict anything in the books, so where’s the problem?<br><br>Apparently time travel was outlawed and building Time-Turners is illegal now, so we got a canonical reason for why the Ministry didn’t build new Time-Turners after the Battle of the DOM (the big hole in <i>Thirdly, I smashed all remaining Time-Turners during the battle in the Department of Mysteries, removing the possibility of reliving even short periods in the future.</i>) <br><br>Since it is not available in the current version of Pottermore, Eloise Mintumble’s backstory is now as uncanon as silver prefect badges and Hermione’s eleventh O.W.L. (I’m still bitter about the latter). The books only implied that time travel is dangerous, not going into any details, so changing the timeline in unpredictable ways being the only danger doesn’t contradict canon. (Being able to change everything back rather than producing new unpredictable results may still be a stupid plot.)<br><br>Are you claiming that talking shrunken heads and a dragon leaving her nest to chase Harry all over Hogwarts are ideas that came from Rowling’s head?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Does having a daughter sound like something Voldemort would do? Even since his return he was set on taking over the Wizarding World and ensure that everyone knew he was back. It was his second chance, something that he failed to do previously, but now he could finally do it. I believe that would occupy most of his thoughts, rather than thinking about an heir. No, I&#39;ve never called Voldemort asexual, but I think he had better things to do in HBP than taking one of his groupies for a roll in the hay. I guess I would be more okay with this whole concept if a) the badfics didn&#39;t destroy it previously, and b) there was any hint that Voldemort wants to preserve his legacy in any other form instead of himself - his desperate attempts to achieve immortality, and his Boggart of his own corpse, are more than enough evidence that he didn&#39;t want to be removed from this world, or &quot;leave it to the kids&quot; to continue what he started.<br><br>The Atticus Finch point, I admit repeating after somebody, since I haven&#39;t read neither of the two installments. Basically the explanation I was given is that in <i>Mockingbird</i> Finch defends a person of colour out of sheer will to help, only to become a racist in <i>Watchman</i>.<br><br>No, that&#39;s not a contradiction, that&#39;s just weird. There was no implication that the trolley lady is something more than just an employee. Although, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;d call her a vending machine, she still sounds human. I&#39;ve heard that this might&#39;ve just been Human Transfiguration that she used, so I&#39;m just gonna let that thing go.<br><br>My point about Time-Turner thing is that Mintumble&#39;s backstory gave us a valid explanation as to why there is no Temporal Manipulation in <i>Harry Potter</i>. Anything more than a few hours lead to nasty consequences for both the user and Time itself. Yes, I know there might be different models of Time-Turners, and the one Hermione got was just for a personal use, but if we get one that bypasses the rules and leaves absolutely no consequences for the user (Albus and Scorpius didn&#39;t age 20 years when they returned), then how is that a good plot point?<br><br>To be perfectly fair I liked the idea of the talking shrunken heads in <i>Prisoner of Azkaban</i> film. It didn&#39;t bring anything significant to the canon (as opposed to Voldemort&#39;s daughter and OP time machines). And the dragon sequence... yeah, done purely for action. Wasn&#39;t a fan.</p>

            <p>&quot;Hermione attempted to study thirteen subjects before she dropped two&quot; was the perfect answer to the question why Hermione needed a Time-Turner when other students who got twelve O.W.L.s apparently didn’t. But since JKR changed the number of Hermione’s O.W.L.s to ten in a newer edition of HBP, this is no longer true. Just like that, all the wonderful rules and explanations from Mintumble’s backstory you want to be applied are no longer true, since the text has been changed (actually completely removed) in a newer edition. So you have to go with what is said in PoA and CC, and that isn’t contradictory.<br><br>Nobody claimed that Voldemort <i>wanted</i> a heir, it’s sufficient and in character that he didn’t care for the potential consequences of taking one of his groupies for a roll in the hay. And since JKR didn’t show us what occupied <i>all</i> of his time since Bellatrix escaped from Azkaban, he may have done whatever she wants him to have done. I don’t say we should like it, but it doesn’t contradict anything in the books.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>You&#39;re all missing something here. In this mess of a script, there is a single, shining light of awesome. It&#39;s so brilliant, that if you focus on it, you can&#39;t see the rest of the script. (Thank goodness for that.) What is this wonderful light, you ask? Simple: It is incredibly obvious that Lord Voldemort loves Pokémon Go. He adores it, and is a part of Team Valor, probably because their team color is the same general color as blood. He loves it so much, he forces all his Death Eaters to play it, and when he takes control of the wizarding world, he forces the entire wizarding world to play Pokémon Go and swear allegiance to Team Valor. Of course, this means that we can all resist this abomination by choosing to play Pokémon Go and aligning ourselves with either Team Mystic or Team Instinct. Let&#39;s have fun, protest this horrible script, and ignore the dreadful canon &#39;update&#39; we&#39;re protesting, all at the same time!</p>

            <p>Because the movies, while based on the same canon, are of their own continuity. That&#39;s why distinctions are made between bookverse and movieverse. Normally I&#39;d say that this script that was released is part of the theaterverse... except Rowling has explicitly called it the &quot;eighth story&quot; and considers it to be canon for the books.

            <p>Currently, I have too many questions that aren’t answered by the spoilers I’ve seen.<br><br>True, there are lots of badfic elements.

            <p>Events and characterization in the main timeline are canon. The alternate timelines are ridiculously improbable AUs to emphasize how dangerous time travel is. (If somebody could have calculated a greater than zero chance for Cedric the Death Eater happening, the side effects of changing the past wouldn’t be &quot;unpredictable&quot;.) And Delphi got every Sue trait that is compatible with canon.<br><br>It may be possible to make all this sound plausible. Examples:<br><br>Theodore Nott worked with former members of the DOM’s time branch who got angry when Rufus Scrimgeour outlawed time travel, but not so angry that they joined the Death Eaters and were arrested after the Battle of Hogwarts.<br><br>Or:<br><br>The first wizards who explored time travel got on a wrong track and invented a device that barely did what it was expected to do, in an overcomplicated, dangerous and energy-consuming way that made it quite unreliable. But since this was the only known way to do it, it became generally believed to be the right way. New apprentices in the DOM’s time branch learned that this is how it should be done, and everybody tried to plagiarize the old patents, implementing minor improvements to make it look like original work while making it even more complex and unreliable. Only a complete outsider like Theo Nott, who had no idea of how to do it &quot;right&quot; could think of something genuinely new and actually do it better.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Voldemort is all about power and manipulation. For him, still being able to make a woman want it, despite his lack of attractiveness, may have been more satisfying than the actual act.

            <p>(And by &quot;that&quot;, I mean Delphi being born before the Battle of Hogwarts)<br><br>...how is it that nobody noticed Bellatrix was pregnant while they were being held at Malfoy Manor? That wasn&#39;t exactly far off from the battle; unless she had a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_pregnancy">cryptic pregnancy</a> or otherwise wasn&#39;t showing that late in her pregnancy. Yes, first-time mothers aren&#39;t as large, but not showing at all is extremely rare.<br><br>And going on for more &quot;this directly contradicts canon&quot; points:<br><br>1) Bane the centaur shows up at some point and blathers about how Albus&#39; destiny is written in the stars, or something to that effect. We know from Firenze&#39;s Divination lesson in OotP, though, that the centaurs&#39; methods of Divination are never so precise as that. And when they showed up in PS/SS, their main concern was that &quot;Mars is bright tonight. Unusually bright.&quot; And later, &quot;Always the innocent are the first victims.&quot;<br><br>2) I&#39;d have to go digging to find the review, but one in particular took offense at Ron&#39;s portrayal, saying at one point he had to be shown how to properly hold a wand. I&#39;m <i>Really</i> hoping that one&#39;s not true, because while Ron wasn&#39;t the best student, he wasn&#39;t an idiot.<br><br>3) Apparently the play claims that Voldemort became a bad guy because he was lonely and friendless. Direct contradiction to the &quot;conceived via love potion, can&#39;t feel love&quot; bit. Or the &quot;Voldemort doesn&#39;t need or want friends&quot; bit.<br><br>I could draw up a more complete list later once I&#39;m not on mobile and able to better find my references.</p>

            <p>I never liked the &quot;conceived via love potion, can&#39;t feel love&quot; bit. Did Merope’s choice matter so much that Tom Marvolo never got a choice? Or would he have been able to figure out how this thing called love does work, if he hadn’t chosen to dwell in loneliness and delusions of superiority?<br><br>Maybe Dumbledore, bitter about Tom not taking the chance he had offered when he didn’t warn everybody about his experience in the orphanage, got this wrong? Harry believed until the very end that Voldemort could redeem himself. Or did he tease Voldemort with an impossibility?<br><br>Maybe the point of <i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i> is that there isn’t such thing like a Cursed Child, because choices always matter?

            <p>and checked for lag. He considered looking left. Five seconds later, the drone looked left. <br><br>&#39;Oh, bugger me.&#39; <br><br>Five seconds later, a harsh, sharp voice crawled in from the speakers, grumbling &#39;Hooooh, buugggr mi.&#39; <br><br>&#39;Stupid bloody thing,&#39; He hissed, shutting the intercom off and turning the knob again. The only thing for his voice to connect to was his drone, so the dumb thing connected to itself. He considered looking left. <br>The drone agreed. <br><br>&#39;Thank God,&#39; He muttered. <br><br>&#39;Ffffflak hhhod,&#39; the drone agreed. <br><br>Stocker grunted, and switched the intercom off, again. He&#39;d done a bit of scanning earlier, and had picked up quite a collection of space scrap, just waiting for a worthy prospector such as Stocker to arrive and take advantage of. Stocker was an eternal professional, and took to the call like beer to the liver. He could have sworn he recognised the location, but was always one for the landscape over the numbers.<br>He&#39;d chosen the real heavy stuff. Denton-Jensen M-66 Scrabber-Drone. It was practically a ship in itself, except you plugged yourself in from light-years away, rather than placing your fragile arse in a fragile chair in a fragile chassis, surrounded by decidedly un-fragile space junk. <br>The vision on the drone was still blurry, so he reached for another knob. All he could see was a bunch of black, with some grey splotches in the distance. <br>Stocker twisted the knob. <br><br>&#39;Oh, bugger me.&#39; <br><br>&#39;OOooooooh, bgggrrrrrr m.&#39; <br><br>Stocker shut the intercom off, and pulled the headset off, rubbing his eyes. <br>He put it on again. <br><br>&#39;Oh, bugger me,&#39; He mumbled, again. <br><br>&#39;Ooooh, buuuuuggeer meee.&#39; <br><br>Stocker shut the intercom off. So, that was where he recognised it from. Fair enough, then. All wars had to come to an end at some point. <br>There wasn&#39;t much of a sense to them, otherwise. Stocker was aware of that. It made perfect sense, in his head. <br>His eyes must have worked differently to his head, then, because the sight of Porter-moor station 02 floating, dead and broken through space, surrounded by warships and wreckage, all dark and dirty, seemed completely nonsensical to him. <br>Somehow, &#39;bugger me,&#39; didn&#39;t seem an appropriate reaction, anymore. <br><br><br>(I don&#39;t know. Sifverse needed love, and I&#39;m always prepared for love. And I like drones over bats with cute names, no offence, Ix. Or to bats. Or to people who hate the name Charlotte.) </p>

            <p>JK Rowling said on Pottermore (in an article that has since been taken down, <i>gee I wonder why</i>):<br><br>&quot;I went far too light-heartedly into the subject of time travel in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. While I do not regret it (Prisoner of Azkaban is one of my favourite books in the series), it opened up a vast number of problems for me, because after all, if wizards could go back and undo problems, where were my future plots?<br><br>&quot;I solved the problem to my own satisfaction in stages. Firstly, I had Dumbledore and Hermione emphasise how dangerous it would be to be seen in the past, to remind the reader that there might be unforeseen and dangerous consequences as well as solutions in time travel. Secondly, I had Hermione give back the only Time-Turner ever to enter Hogwarts. Thirdly, I smashed all remaining Time-Turners during the battle in the Department of Mysteries, removing the possibility of reliving even short periods in the future.<br><br>&quot;This is just one example of the ways in which, when writing fantasy novels, one must be careful what one invents. For every benefit, there is usually a drawback.&quot;<br><br>Then there&#39;s what an in-universe character had to say on the subject:<br><br>&quot;As our investigations currently stand, the longest period that may be relived without the possibility of serious harm to the traveller or to time itself is around five hours. We have been able to encase single Hour-Reversal Charms, which are unstable and benefit from containment, in small, enchanted hour-glasses that may be worn around a witch or wizard’s neck and revolved according to the number of hours the user wishes to relive.<br><br>&quot;All attempts to travel back further than a few hours have resulted in catastrophic harm to the witch or wizard involved. It was not realised for many years why time travellers over great distances never survived their journeys. All such experiments have been abandoned since 1899, when Eloise Mintumble became trapped, for a period of five days, in the year 1402. Now we understand that her body had aged five centuries in its return to the present and, irreparably damaged, she died in St Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries shortly after we managed to retrieve her. What is more, her five days in the distant past caused great disturbance to the life paths of all those she met, changing the course of their lives so dramatically that no fewer than twenty-five of their descendants vanished in the present, having been “un-born”.<br><br>&quot;Finally, there were alarming signs, during the days following Madam Mintumble’s recovery, that time itself had been disturbed by such a serious breach of its laws. Tuesday following her reappearance lasted two and a half full days, whereas Thursday shot by in the space of four hours. The Ministry of Magic had a great deal of trouble in covering this up and since that time, the most stringent laws and penalties have been placed around those studying time travel.&quot;</p>

            <p>... but isn&#39;t that exactly what the play seems to be showing? &quot;how dangerous it would be to be seen in the past, to remind the reader that there might be unforeseen and dangerous consequences as well as solutions in time travel&quot; in particular looks like practically a mission statement for <i>Cursed Child</i>. And all that stuff about time breaking down...<br><br>The massive-aging problem is probably the biggest one you mention, and it <i>does</i> seem fairly conclusive. But there&#39;s even wriggle room built into it - the &#39;benefit from confinement&#39; aspect could mean that the Time-Turner has stabilised the aging issue over the length of its operation. Perhaps the initial attempt (pre-1899) used a Year-Reversal Charm, but was mothballed after the Mintumble incident.<br><br>I&#39;m afraid I still don&#39;t understand. It sounds like you&#39;re saying a play showing time travel is bad, is itself bad, because JKR and someone in-universe said that time-travel is bad... which I&#39;m sure isn&#39;t what you&#39;re saying, so what <i>are</i> you saying?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>From what we&#39;ve already been told, experimentation with long-distance time travel (long time time travel?) has been severely restricted ever since the Mintumble incident, and even if experimentation had gotten to the point where they were able to time travel back not mere hours, but <i>decades</i>, what are the immense odds that the only two experimental time turners able to do that not only survived the destruction in the Department of Mysteries, but ended up in the hands of the people where they&#39;d be most crucial to the plot? There&#39;s coincidences that move the plot forward, and then there&#39;s coincidences that are just plain outrageous.<br><br>Even ignoring the aging issue, how do Albus and Scorpius get away with altering the past so much only for things to instantly reset to normal once they go back? Yes, we had the My Immortal-esque alternate timeline, but that got eradicated with no noticeable side effects on the present timeline. When Mintumble did her thing, she &quot;caused great disturbance to the life paths of all those she met, changing the course of their lives so dramatically that no fewer than twenty-five of their descendants vanished in the present, having been “un-born”&quot; It doesn&#39;t outright say she directly interfered with their lives, just that she crossed paths with them (a rather tenuous interpretation, I know, so feel free to ignore it), which reads to me like the butterfly effect. And that&#39;s not getting into the problems her time travel caused for the present, what with Tuesday lasting two and a half days and Thursday only four hours. None of that happened in the play. Just go back, hit a reset button, and don&#39;t worry about having to deal with the consequences that should have arisen.<br><br>(Apologies if any of this is snappy or incoherent. It&#39;s six in the morning and I&#39;ve been up all night so I&#39;m probably not at my most lucid right now, but I didn&#39;t want to sleep on this.)</p>

            <p>A few points I&#39;m going to draw out:<br><br>-I hadn&#39;t twigged that there were two long-range Time-Turners involved. That, I agree, takes it out of &#39;single prototype&#39; territory and into &#39;outrageous coincidence&#39;.<br><br>-I don&#39;t think the Mintumble Effect is a full-on butterfly effect - it&#39;s way too limited! Only 25 people stopped existing, after 500 years? Either she literally appeared in a sealed cave and telepathically communicated with one person, or history in the Potterverse is very resilient.<br><br>Actually, we know it is, because it&#39;s possible for schoolkids to use a (short-range) Time Turner without changing <u>anything</u>. I think the setting works on the principle of &#39;if you&#39;re trying to keep things the same, you&#39;ll probably succeed&#39;. Plus, of course, the usually counterpart: &#39;if you try to change things, it&#39;ll go out of control&#39;.<br><br>So is it resilient enough to let them restore it to normal after their shenanigans? That&#39;s one for debating, I think.<br><br>-Why didn&#39;t next Wednesday run backwards, or some other time-breaks-down events? Well... who says it doesn&#39;t? &gt;:D Maybe the sun never rises again after the night the play ends. But no, I agree that canonically listing side-effects and then ignoring them when convenient is bad.<br><br>-I get the feeling your objection isn&#39;t really centred on the contradiction of minor points of the canon, but on the fact that <i>Cursed Child</i> is pretty much <i>Back to the Future</i> - &#39;kid tries to make things better for his parents in the past but accidentally deletes himself&#39;, for instance - and that you don&#39;t think a <i>Back to the Future</i> storyline really fits the Potterverse. That, plus you don&#39;t like the dark timeline - is that because of the specific details of it, or just on general principles?<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: And no, I don&#39;t think it was snappy. I don&#39;t think it was incoherent, either, but if I&#39;ve totally misunderstood you, then it was. ^_~)</p>

            <p>Every witch and wizard who has heard the words &#39;Time&#39; and &#39;Turner&#39; placed together knows that they represent an inordinately dangerous piece of magic. Created by encasing an Hour-Reversal Charm in an enchanted sandtimer, the Time-Turner has the ability to transport its bearer back into the past. They are the only exception to the absolute ban on time-travel magic, a ban which every Minister has confirmed for over a hundred years.<br><br>Yet the danger of time travel is both greater and less than some students might think. Certainly, it is possible to erase yourself from history (for example by Obliviating your grandparents to forget their marriage), and indeed to alter the course of events quite substantially - imagine an unscrupulous or incautious time traveller Stunning A. Dumbledore during his celebrated duel with Grindelwald. But some of the dangers have been overstated, or perhaps mitigated; and this is best discussed in the context of the tragic fate of Madam Eloise Mintumble.<br><br>In 1899, Madam Mintumble travelled back on a study trip to the year 1402. Her trip ran far longer than anticipated, and on her return a number of Effects (later named after her) were observed.<br><br><u>The First Mintumble Effect</u>: On her return to the present of 1899, Madam Mintumble immediately aged five centuries (less three years), and died shortly thereafter. The First Effect is simply this: that <b>any travel forward in time will cause the traveller to age accordingly</b>, whatever speed that time may pass at. This Effect is not alleviated by the common Time-Turner, and is one reason for the five-hour rule regarding these instruments.<br><br>Rumour has it, however, that Theodore Nott successfully negated the First Effect in his two illicit Time-Turners. Unlike common Time-Turners, the Nott variety are designed to take the operator back to a certain time, and then return them to the present. The initial prototype allowed only a five-minute stay, while the second instrument extended the limit indefinitely. Given Nott&#39;s known skills, it is possible the Nott Turners contain some manner of potion to negate the First Effect. Alternately, they may be designed to project or displace the user into the past, rather than utilising time travel as it is normally understood.<br><br><u>The Second Mintumble Effect</u>: From Madam Mintumble&#39;s deathbed testimony (obtained by Legilimency), it is known that at least 25 persons who existed in 1899 before her trip were &#39;un-born&#39; due to her actions. Yet the impact of her five days in 1402 is far <b>less</b> than might be expected: the general course of both magical and non-magical history continued exactly as before, despite the absence of several family lines and all their interactions with the world. Other persons of similar nature simply found themselves in the same circumstances - most famously in the case of Anne Boelyn, witch and wife of King Henry VIII, who according to Madam Mintumble&#39;s memories, ought to have been a woman named Elizabeth Spindle.<br><br>Thus, the Second Mintumble Effect is: <b>the past may be changed, but it is broadly resilient</b>. The reverse is also true: should a traveller alter a major historical event (as happened in the Potter/Malfoy incident), the existence of people in the present is unlikely to be endangered, unless their lives directly depend on said event.<br><br><u>The Third Mintumble Effect</u>: The third effect is the most serious, and the least understood. Following Madam Mintumble&#39;s trip, rescue, and death, ripples began to be felt in the fabric of time itself. The famous statement that &#39;Tuesday following her reappearance lasted two and a half full days, whereas Thursday shot by in the space of four hours&#39; is, so far as can be determined, precisely correct. But this effect had not been observed in previous experiments, which had also not run afoul of the Second Effect. It seemed that the Third Effect occured only as a result of the Second: <b>if history is changed, time&#39;s flow is disrupted in the present</b>.<br><br>The five-hour rule for regular Time Turners was instituted primarily to prevent such effects: it prevents a witch or wizard causing significant changes in events that have already occured. Whether the Nott Turners were able to overcome the Third Effect as they had the First is unknown - according to the Minister&#39;s testimony, all the changes made to history were rectified before enough time had passed to observe the Third Effect in action. We have no evidence to show that this is not the case, nor that there has been any of the mass memory manipulation that would be needed to cover up a Third Effect incident.<br><br>~Huinesoron, Professor of Magical Artefacts, &amp;c<br><br>(Basically, assume anything you don&#39;t recognise was invented by me. I&#39;m trying to rationalise the stated facts, not necessarily say what JKR intended. ~hS)</p>

            <p>The Time-Turner used by Hermione Granger during her third year appears to be a one-way device. Harry and Hermione traveled three hours back in time and then simply relived these three hours to catch up to present time and sneak in to take the place of their younger selves who just vanished to the past. Hermione obviously did something similar whenever she used the Time-Turner to sit in a classroom or do homework (or sleep) while she was also sitting in another classroom. It isn’t surprising that wizards who tried to use this type of Time-Turner to travel several centuries back in time did never return. <br><br>So, isn’t the First Mintumble Effect just: &quot;Catching up from 1402 to 1899 took 497 years, and since Madam Mintumble was in no state to sneak in and replace her younger self, her corpse was only found five days later near the place where she had vanished; this was misinterpreted as Madam Mintumble having spent five days in 1402&quot;? This would be consistent with PoA, but is contradicted by the official statement &quot;... she died in St Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries shortly after we managed to retrieve her.&quot;<br><br>Was Madam Mintumble brought back by the safeguard we see in Theo Notts prototype, but in her case it was set to five days rather than five minutes? This contradicts &quot;we managed to retrieve her&quot; and &quot;Eloise Mintumble became trapped, for a period of five days&quot;. How did she expect to return before the safeguard kicked in? Should the safeguard have been set to a shorter time? Also, if a safeguard was always there, shouldn’t it have kicked in for Hermione? Catching up to the present time through reliving the hours she traveled back doesn’t help. Technically, Harry and Hermione are still three hours in the past because, had they stayed in the natural timeline, they should already be three hours further in the future when they finally catch up to what they think of as &quot;present time&quot;.  Five days (or whatever time the safeguard is set to) after they traveled to the past, the safeguard should kick in and make them skip three hours to re-establish the natural timeline.<br><br>Did Madam Mintumble (or the rescue team that &quot;retrieved&quot; her) use a more advanced Time-Turner that actually had a travel-forward function? How would this be applied? Turn counter-clockwise to travel back in time and turn clockwise to travel forward? Would travelling to the furture be possible? And why could the rescue team not travel further back and &quot;retrieve&quot; Madam Mintumble when she had only spent some hours in 1402?<br><br>May the text have been taken down because the upcoming time-travel plot made somebody re-think it and they realized that it’s nonsense? <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>The Time-Turner <i>per se</i> didn&#39;t exist in 1899; they are a specialised magical artefact designed to mitigate the Mintumble Effects - a stabilised time-reversal charm with strict limits on range. Rather, Madam Mintumble cast her own temporal reversal charm, the incantation for which is strictly controlled by the Department of Mysteries.<br><br>Her retrieval, so far as can be determined from the records, was accomplished by a modified <i>Prior Incantato</i> spell. Researchers have proposed various methods by which this might have been accomplished: some speculate that Madam Mintumble&#39;s wand was left behind in 1402, and thus was present in the Department of Mysteries to be directly interacted with; others propose that a wand with matching core was obtained, and somehow a <i>Priori Incantatum</i> effect was induced across time; still others, that the Unspeakables were able to access and reverse the charm simply through the room in which it was cast.<br><br>Whatever the case, it seems that Madam Mintumble&#39;s rescue was effected five days after her departure, and left her spending five days in the past. No other witches or wizards travelled back to collect her, or else they would have been equally affected by the First Effect: the returning spell simply dragged her through the timestream at high speed, allowing the aging process to continue. (It has been speculated that this, rather than the Second Effect, is the direct cause of the Third Effect shockwave; understandably, no research has been conducted.)<br><br>There was no safeguard on the charm used by Eloise Mintumble. It is unlikely, in fact, that a single-cast spell such as she used could even <i>be</i> safeguarded.<br><br>As for the Minister for Magic: in a rare interview following the Albus/Scorpius affair, she confirmed that she has &#39;always felt older than [she] should be&#39;, and that she believes her use of the Time-Turner at Hogwarts added a month or more to her age. The safeguard on her Time-Turner only limits the distance back one can travel in a single casting (and induces a cool-down period to prevent multiple castings); it does not include a &#39;spring-back&#39; effect. The Nott prototype&#39;s &#39;spring-back&#39; is unique, and a consequence of the Turner&#39;s unique construction.<br><br>~Professor Huinesoron, &amp;c &amp;c<br><br>(Eeeeeeverything in here is wild speculation. Your interpretation is just as valid. ^_^)</p>

            <p>If the contradictions hadn&#39;t been already established, I think the whole &quot;go back and change time to see what might have been&quot; plot could have been interesting, if cliché, but the devil is in the details (ack, it&#39;s definitely bedtime, it took me five minutes trying to think how that phrase started. But yeah, contradictions like this are why I shout at the TV while watching <i>Doctor Who</i>). As it stands, though, Albus and Scorpius really shouldn&#39;t have been able to break canon like they did and it just bugs me, to put it mildly. I wasn&#39;t even thinking <i>Back to the Future</i>, but now that you&#39;ve said it, that sounds about right. :P I was thinking of it in more AU terms.<br><br>The dark future itself could have been better done, IMO. It was a great idea in concept, but in execution it just sounded extremely cheesy to me. &quot;For Voldemort and valor&quot;? The Scorpion King? Bleh.<br><br>(As a side note, remember how Hermione had to turn over her time turner the number of hours she wanted to go back? I just love the mental image of the boys standing there while turning the hourglass over and over and over and over and over... even if that&#39;s not what happened.)<br><br>-Ix, going to bed now. Or soonish. Maybe. Something like that.</p>

            <p>I think to some extend I&#39;d need to see how it actually falls out in practice before declaring JK Rowling a Suethor. Fiction is littered with evil regimes who have little slogans to start or end conversations with - they show up quite often in high fantasy, usually when the Good Guys have to infiltrate a temple or palace without giving themselves away. Though honestly, given Riddle&#39;s character, I can&#39;t imagine he&#39;d accept not being <i>Lord</i> Voldemort in their catchphrase.<br><br>(Crackpot theory: they do it because Voldemort literally told them to. And he told them to because that timeline also includes the tracking jinx - so it lets him know exactly where everyone is any time he wants. Think about it, he&#39;d do it and all.)<br><br>(As to The Scorpion King... yeah, nah. &quot;There is only one Lord of the Rings&quot;, etc - Voldy would <i>hate</i> that.)<br><br>I&#39;m gonna keep that image of turning the turner some 175,000 times and treasure it forever. :D I wonder what kind of RPMs you can put in a Time-Turner before it shatters? Is there a spell for that?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The tiny bat fluttered in through the window, a scroll clutched in her feet. <br><br>&quot;What&#39;s the matter, Charlotte?&quot; Lady Iximaz asked, a furrow creasing her brow.

            <p>She had not ventured into Air&#39;ihpotre since her first visit to the Federation of Academia, yes, but she remembered and enjoyed its famous stories all the same. She had been curious but not driven to investigate whispers of the newest tale, though one particular detail from it--that a famed witch actually had dark skin rather than the assumed light--had intrigued her.<br><br>But this...<br><br>&quot;They&#39;re saying it&#39;s fallen?

You were outside that bookshop when they announced the final volume had arrived!&quot;<br><br>&quot;That was my mother,&quot; said eatpraylove. &quot;Miguel, I told you, I had to process the ending of the fifth part and then got sucked into Federation affairs.

            <p>&quot;My lady... oh, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br><br>Lady Kaitlyn extracted herself from her husband&#39;s arms and smiled at Freckles. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; she said.

What about their campaigns in the west? What about the war-beasts they were rumoured to be breeding in the Valley of Fantastic Beasts?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Armies and monsters mean almost nothing when your armies have no hope,&quot; Kaitlyn said.

Hasn&#39;t she decried the deaths during the Hallowed Campaign as &#39;unnecessary&#39;? Didn&#39;t she commend the Harmony Fleet for their strength and persceptiveness, even as they unloaded fresh troops for Roe Lin&#39;s assaults? Is she not,&quot; she went on, her face turning grim, &quot;the mage behind the Curse of the White Scorpion which felled the walls of Hockwart itself?&quot;<br><br>&quot;But,&quot; Huinesoron spluttered, &quot;but-&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Guardians of Hockwart owe alliegence to her,&quot; Kaitlyn said, &quot;and they were seen arrayed alongside the Beasts of the Isle of Morn in the battle lines of Roe Lin. There can be no doubt.&quot; She laid the sheet of paper almost reverently on her desk, then crumpled back into her seat. &quot;It&#39;s...&quot; She lowered her head, covering her face with her hands. &quot;It&#39;s just like the Weaver all over again...&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>&quot;Nope,&quot; said Falchion, perched upon his master&#39;s gloved arm. &quot;Totally real.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No. I refuse to believe it,&quot; Skaer&#39;morys growled.<br><br>&quot;Sir Hardric did, too.

There&#39;s gotta be some sort of remaining stronghold, there HAS to be.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Valley of Fantastic Beasts, perhaps?&quot; the metallic bird suggested. &quot;Surely there&#39;d be survivors hiding there...&quot;<br><br>Rashida, who had had her hunger sated the hour before and had been trying to doze off before Falchion&#39;s news had disturbed her, shook her whiskered head. &quot;That valley hasn&#39;t been inhabited for centuries. I don&#39;t know what lurks within there, either, but I doubt there&#39;s any way one would be able to build even a log cabin within a mile of the place, let alone a functioning village.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;d take any number of dangerous creatures over a Marizu any day,&quot; replied Skaer&#39;morys, his eyes blazing. &quot;That settles it. We&#39;re going to Air&#39;ihpotre.&quot;<br><br>Falchion nearly fell off his master&#39;s arm. At the same time, Rashida&#39;s hackles raised as she let out a sudden roar. &quot;<b>WHAT?!</b>&quot;<br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t say <i>right now</i>,&quot; replied Skaer&#39;morys. &quot;But we have to go there as soon as we can.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Master, that&#39;s a patented Very Bad Idea!&quot; Falchion cried, his bladed feathers ruffling. &quot;Regardless of whether or not there are still survivors taking refuge in the valley you speak of, the rest of the place has been utterly overrun. We&#39;d be dead before we even set foot within the border!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll take my chances,&quot; said Skaer&#39;morys. &quot;I may have left a few things behind after I visited that realm a few years ago, and it&#39;s about time I got them back. Besides, if Sir Hardric&#39;s going there like you said, there&#39;s plenty of reason for us to back him up.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Master, please,&quot; said Rashida. &quot;I am one of the oldest, most experienced monsters you&#39;ve mastered to date, and as someone with such an esteemed position, I have be honest with you: I don&#39;t care about you or your problems. This is suicidal, and nothing can convince us otherwise!&quot;<br><br>Skaer&#39;morys shook his head. &quot;If we don&#39;t go, Sir Hardric will be venturing there on his own. And on top of that, if we stay here and do nothing, we&#39;ll know if there are any survivors left, let alone if any have hidden in the valley. Sorry, guys, but we&#39;ve got no other choice.&quot;<br><br>Falchion shuddered. &quot;I still think this is a bad idea.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You and me both,&quot; replied Rashida.<br><br>&quot;Then let&#39;s get to it!&quot; Skaer&#39;morys gazed off into space, his expression betraying a glimmer of hope. &quot;C&#39;mon, you two. There&#39;s a certain knight out there who could use our help.&quot;<br><br>(tl;dr: This whole debacle is making me more eager for the Fantastic Beasts movie than ever, though that&#39;s not saying much. And Hardric, I&#39;d be totally down for doing a Potterverse co-write mission with you sometime! If you&#39;re interested too, well, you have my e-mail. ;D)</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve always liked a lot of the obscure, C and D class characters in comics, so the fact that we&#39;re getting Suicide Squad, the Defenders, Justice League Dark, Guardians of the Galaxy (again), and a couple of the B listers (hey there Captain Marvel and guy who used to be Captain Marvel) in the spotlight is basically a dream come true.</p>
