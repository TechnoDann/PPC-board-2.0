            <p>My goodness, Lorien Legacies is finally over. I remember having the series thrust in my face constantly, in school, in the library, in Costco, etc. I felt that I had to start reading this. After an hour of absurdly fast skimming, I felt rather disappointed. Let&#39;s start at the beginning.<br><br>The prologue starts with two people, in separate dreams, being contacted by Setrakus Ra. He pulls this &quot;I&#39;m only trying to do what&#39;s right routine&quot;, and Five doesn&#39;t buy it for a moment. However, the other person, Mark, did. Yadda yadda yadda, John Smith is in a military base, uses his new power copying, raids a Mogadorian Warship, and then uses his new flight powers to walk in to a trap. This is where things go really wrong. John gets horrifically scarred by Mark, who has been subject to mind control. In the last book, the writer was trying to cast The Beloved Leader in a sympathetic light, like showing him in despair when Ella died. Now, we have him creating horrific genetic experiments, and killing even more children. In my opinion, they wasted a valid plot line. More stuff happens, and everyone decides to go fight Setrakus to kill him once and for all. More genetic experiments, more horrible things happening to the protagonists. I think it was supposed to show that they weren&#39;t speshul, the fact that they weren&#39;t invincible and all that, but it just seemed forced. It felt that there was senseless violence, just for the sake of senseless violence. So The Garde in the final fight with The Beloved Leader, and it is a curb stomp battle. Half of them seem to have been thrown into space, and Nine is missing an arm. John is caught in a vice grip, and the only thing he can do is Heal all the augments out of Setrakus. He does that, and dies with him. Just kidding, Six is the person who actually kills him, and John&#39;s alive, but badly beaten. The Epilogue is twelve months later, and is full of death fake-outs. Five has somehow survived being in space for an undisclosed amount of time, and is just waiting for himself to die. Adam&#39;s lumped in with all the other Mogadorians, but chooses to pull a clichйd &quot;I can leave whenever I want but I won&#39;t&quot;. In the end, John has created a new Loric Council room, but it doesn&#39;t have space for only Nine, so that anyone can join. He then says he&#39;s tired of being a number, and the story ends.<br><br>End result: The book has rubbed me the wrong way. Once upon a time, I might&#39;ve liked it, but not anymore. What are your thoughts on the series? Did you like it? Did you hate it? I&#39;d like to know.</p>

            <p>Apparently? Well, I&#39;ll just grab my Android phone and--<br><br>Wait, what&#39;s that? My phone runs on Nokia&#39;s OS and isn&#39;t smart enough for GPS, let alone a game like this?<br><br>Well... huh. <s>Maybe I can steal Kaitlyn&#39;s?</s><br><br>So, some details exist:<br><br><a href="http://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-go/">From the official site:</a><br><br>-It&#39;s free-to-play, with in-app purchases. You can spend money to buy more Pokeballs, for instance.<br><br>-The &#39;Pokemon in the real world view&#39; thing seems to just be a camera overlay; it doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s part of actual gameplay. Call this my sad face: :(<br><br>-You can find eggs at map locations, which hatch by walking a lot.<br><br>-If you collect enough of a given Pokemon, you get to evolve one of them. So that&#39;s kind of nice.<br><br>-Yes, there are proper battles!<br><br><i>Using the Pokйmon you’ve caught, engage in battle with the defending Pokйmon at the Gym. Battles are challenging and fun. Use your Pokйmon’s two attacks to battle the defending Pokйmon. You can also dodge the defending Pokйmon’s attacks by swiping left and right.</i><br><br>So it&#39;s only at Gyms, but at least it exists! I&#39;m guessing the reason you only get two moves is so that the AI stands a chance; they have to make stocking a Gym actually serve a purpose, right?<br><br>-According to <a href="http://serebii.net/news/2016/06-July-2016.shtml">Serebii.net</a>, you get a starter when you first, uh, start. I&#39;m not sure why, except that starter Pokemon are traditional.<br><br>hS</p>

So after getting Rattats floating in front of my window several times in a row, I decided to see if I could make it pop up next to my Pokйmon plushies. I think I died a little inside from squeeing so hard. And then I had way too much fun with <s>carefully positioning</s> finding the others, like the Pidgeot flying around the living room or the Nidoran hiding under the sofa.<br><br>My opinion: If you go into this expecting an augmented reality version of the handheld <i>Pokйmon</i> games, you&#39;ll be disappointed. The game reminds me more of a Pokйmon-flavored <i>Ingress</i>, except since Pokйmon can appear anywhere you can still level up and aren&#39;t penalized as heavily for living in a place with few <s>portals</s> Pokй Stops. I&#39;m still keeping an eye out for a Gym, since I haven&#39;t run into one of those yet.<br><br>I think it&#39;s fun, but I can see why others might be disappointed. YMMV.</p>

            <p>I mean, I&#39;ve wandered around my neighborhood catching Pokйmon and using my data, but I&#39;ve also caught a decent number of Pokйmon just sitting on my bed and listening for an alert while working. I think it&#39;s more fun to go out there and find them yourself, though, because you could be waiting a long time for &#39;mons to spawn close enough to your house to catch.</p>

            <p>A&#39;right, Generic Server users, we&#39;ve noticed that a certain memorial book had disappeared from the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/VcOBUGK.png">Mausoleum</a> right outside the Keep. One of certain Judith the mini-zombie, very precious member that was with us in our early days.

            <p>Normaly, once you have given your pseudo to July and she registered you, you can go to the server without getting a formal invitation.<br><br>There is indeed a communal fort where you can go until your own base is ready, and where you can take some resources.<br><br>There is also a mine I dug on the hill next to it where you can mine and take some resources. Only thing I ask in exchange is a small part of the resources you could mine in the tunels, and that you make sure that each new galery you dig is closed by a wall and a gate, and that each section is well-lit.</p>

            <p>Someone had put it inside the &#39;free kit&#39; chest.<br><br>Now, for people staying at the communal house, I&#39;ll also let this announcement. You can go in the mines next to the fort and help yourself (within reasonable limits) with the resources inside. You can even claim some section of them as a domicile. Only things I ask for is help extending the mines, and making sure the sections you dig remain walled and well-lit. That&#39;s a pretty big thing to extend all alone.</p>

            <p>So, I&#39;m probably incredibly late to the party, and most likely most of you already know about this and will just wave over it, but I&#39;m still gonna bring this up, because this could be really interesting discussion to see if we can predict who will sit on the World&#39;s Most Uncomfortable Chair. Just a heads up, I&#39;m not a historian nor an Englishman, so this is based solely on the research I found on the Internet:<br><br><i>Game of Thrones</i>, and of course its book counterpart, is an alternative history of the War of the Roses - a series of wars for control of the throne of England. Conflict between <s>the Starks and the Lannisters</s> the Yorks and the Lancasters ends with the victory of the latter House.<br><br>We start with King Henry VI. He was rumoured to be insane, feeble-minded, experienced several mental breakdowns, so people began to challenge his reign. It&#39;s not very hard to draw a parallel between Henry VI and the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen.<br><br>During the War (parallel to Robert&#39;s Rebellion) there were two very short-reigning kings, Edwards IV and V, before the War of the Roses ended with Henry VII won the throne by defeating King Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field.<br><br>(On a side-note, Richard III was portrayed by the Tudor scholars as a deformed and was the subject of many attacks... Tyrion Lannister, anyone?)<br><br>So now we enter the Tudor era with Henry VII who, when compared to the world of Westeros, reflects Robert Baratheon. Henry VII was called the usurper, supports the Lancasters, but ends up marrying Elizabeth of York (In this role, Lyanna Stark?). They wind up having the son we know as Henry VIII. In his youth, Henry VIII was a celebrity. Athlete, expert jouster, popular with the ladies, cultured... Well, we all know how he ended up. Basically the fallen hero. So now we see that Robert Baratheon has traits of both Henry VII and Henry VIII. Although, seeing how Henry VIII was a cruel king, most of us would make a connection between him and Joffrey, so how do we explain that?<br><br>Henry VIII legitimized only one of his bastard children - Henry FitzRoy - whom he got from an affair with Elizabeth &quot;Bessie&quot; Blount. And remember Robert in season 1? &quot;<i>Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie...</i>&quot; FitzRoy died really young by disease (on paper), but it was speculated that he was poisoned.<br><br>After Henry VIII, his son - Edward VI - inherits the throne. In the world of Westeros, this is Tommen Barahtheon. Edward inherits the throne very young, he is gullible and is pushed around, mostly by the family from his mother&#39;s side. After Edward, for a very short time the country is ruled by Lady Jane Grey, the Nine-Day Queen, until she was thrown into the Tower and... off with her head. Now, there might&#39;ve been small parallel between Lady Grey and Margery Tyrell, but that would be stretching.<br><br><b>WARNING, WE&#39;RE MOVING INTO THE SPOILER TERRITORY! THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE! SPOILERS AHEAD! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!</b><br><br>In the Season 6 finale, what a shocker - everybody dies, and Cersei Lannister becomes the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. In English history, there is another cruel woman who claimed the throne after Lady Grey had been executed, and the parallel is really evident<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Mary I Tudor, AKA Bloody Mary. I think most of you have heard of the good lady. <br><br>And this is where predictions and speculations start. After Bloody Mary, another woman sits on the throne - Good Queen Bess, the Virgin Queen, Elizabeth I. Who might this be, in the world of Westeros? My best guess would be Sansa Stark.<br><br>After Elizabeth, the throne is claimed by James VI of Scotland, who becomes James I of England. Since Scotland is the closest thing to the Wall and the North I can imagine, I would assume Jon Snow (current King in the North), would eventually claim the throne.<br><br>But those are just my predictions. Questions? Comments? Let the discussion begin!</p>

            <p>While I&#39;m not a big fan of <i>Game of Thrones</i>, I do enjoy the hell out of history. And by &quot;enjoy the hell out of history,&quot; I mean to the extent that I got two degrees relating to the field. Based on some of my own research, I think you&#39;ve missed a few points with your comparison between the show and the actual Wars of the Roses.<br><br>You say that both the book and the show are supposed to be an alternate history of the Wars. And yet, the majority of what you&#39;ve discussed in your post has to do with events that occurred after the Wars ended with the ascension of Henry Tudor. to the English throne (minus a few Yorkist revolts). You can&#39;t claim that the series represents a certain period, then discuss how it only really connects to things that occurred after said period. That undoes part of your central argument.<br><br>Painting Robert Baratheon as an amalgam of Henry VII and Henry VIII seems to me very much a surface level interpretation of all three men. For one thing, Henry VII was a far more competent ruler than Robert seems to be. He helped to re-centralize royal power and oversaw major lucrative trade agreements. As for Henry VIII, whether or not he was truly &quot;a cruel king&quot; depends on which historian is writing about him. He&#39;s certainly no Joffrey.<br><br><b>BIG SPOILERS START HERE.</b><br><br>***<br><br>***<br><br>I really have to call into question your comparing Cersei with Mary I. Once again, saying the two are analogues feels like a very shallow interpretation of similarities. They might both be cruel and driven women, but for wildly different reasons. Cersei is driven by power: power for her family, but more so power for herself. One of Mary&#39;s major drive was religion: to whit, the preservation of Catholicism as the dominant force in England. I don&#39;t recall that being a big deal for Cersei. Mary was also never quite the schemer that Cersei managed to be. To select a historical figure more in line with the Wars of the Roses, Cersei might be closer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_of_Anjou">Margaret of Anjou</a>, wife of Henry VI and a major figure on the side of the Lancasters.<br><br>I can&#39;t really qualify how well Sansa fits as Elizabeth I, but I will say that it doesn&#39;t really fit as an analogue when considering familial connections. <br><br>I found three videos on the subject. The first two are more in-depth, but don&#39;t necessarily go into the Wars of the Roses all that much. The third is a bit simplified, but covers the subject. It&#39;s also a cute cartoon!<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyszuqFQIss">The Real History Behind Game Of Thrones : Part 1</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPeLD4rKBhY">The Real History Behind Game Of Thrones : Part 2</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjO55pKuBo4">The wars that inspired Game of Thrones - Alex Gendler</a></p>

            <p>The community here does seem a bit insular, with a rather high knowledge barrier to entry. Even reading The Original Series (which I have done) is quite a task. Using the average of the first, thirteenth, and last missions, (Chosen because first, middle, and last seems representative. The missions have words counts of 3570, 8119, and 7285, including the title and all author&#39;s notes.), I estimated the length of the original series at approximately 164441 words. For reference, that&#39;s about 2400 words longer than the first two Harry Potter books combined, about 4400 words shorter than the sixth Harry Potter book, around 8300 words longer the The Two Towers, and approximately 2.5 times the median length of a novel listed for sale on Amazon (which is 64000 words). The PPC canon has also been expanded upon significantly, and to a newbie it can sometimes feel like there&#39;s a requirement to be intimately familiar with every notable agent ever, which, even if it isn&#39;t an actual requirement, can still be intimidating. <br><br>Beyond that, it wouldn&#39;t be too difficult to see someone feeling that their writing, while probably sufficient, isn&#39;t good enough if they compare it against the veterans. I might be dealing with this (it could be that my writing just isn&#39;t good enough), as I only started writing creatively late in high school, and while my writing has improved from the impossibly dense stuff I created in high school, where I would compress several sentences into just a few highly ambiguous words that could be interpreted to mean everything I was trying to say (while I received praise for it sounding very nice, nobody could figure out what was going on). On top of that, some people might not be interested in/able to effectively write the PPC&#39;s fluffy comedy, which I know fits me at least for now, as I&#39;m too used to writing very dark stories. Had I not read that you can be a part of the community without writing missions, I probably would have left.</p>

            <p>I reckon your standards for yourself are a bit too high, if you ask me. <br>Probably just because of all that math, though. Any math is too much math, to me. <br>I&#39;m certainly not intimately familiar with every notable agent ever.

The Council ended, but this thread is still open for corrections in case the Keeper of the Records got something wrong or Baron Thanasius Ampelius changed his mind or was actually an imposter.))<br><br>This Baronial Council was held from the twentieth of June until the twenty-sixth of June in the City of Borrd.<br><br><b>Attendees:</b> <br>Lady Iximaz (a baron of Plort)<br>Baroness Juliette <br>Baron PC<br>Baron Phobos<br>Baron Thanasius Ampelius<br>Baron Neshomeh was absent on a campaign against the Subjugator, but did send a message.<br>Baron Kaitlyn was not present, but did send a message.<br>Baron Huinesoron was not present and his messengers were apparently not quite sure what they were meant to message. <br><br>Non-deciding attendees:<br>Filius Caeli, a civilian from the City of Borrd in the Protectorate of Borrd<br>Freckles, messenger of Kwenaya<br>Hieronymus the hermit, a civilian from Wechi<br>Sandra, messenger of Kwenaya<br>Sir Hardric, a wandering knight<br>Sir Matthias Snow, a knight from Tumblar in the Riding of Sittorese<br>Ye Scape-Grace, a knight from Keep De&#39;endee in the Protectorate of Borrd<br><br><b>Agenda:</b><br>The Matter of Sittorese – The Riders of Sittorese were invited to present their choice of civil government.<br><br>An invocation of the Edict of Bast – Reinstating Barony July in western Sittorese, eastern Wechi and eastern Borrd.<br><br>A proposal by Baron Phobos to cede the part of Barony Araeph West of the Hyparlink Route to him, and the part of Barony Cassie South of the Godreve Road to the Barons July, Juliette, and VixenMage to be divided up as they see fit.<br><br>A proposal by Baron Thanasius Ampelius, in reaction to Baron Phobos’s proposal, to cede the territory South of the Godreve road to him, because he feels an attraction to the Riding; but he did not say what he intends to do with his territory in Ozerbord.<br><br>A proposal by Baron PC, in reaction to Baron Phobos’s proposal, to cede the territory West of the Hyparlink Road to Baron Phobos and Baron July to be divided up as they see fit, but leave it still under Baron Araeph’s custody until Barons Phobos and July come to an actual agreement about their future border. <br><br><b>Decisions:</b><br>No Rider of Sittorese showed up to present the Riders&#39; choice of civil government. (Sir Matthias Snow spoke only in the discussion about the distribution of territories, in favor of barons who are actually present.) Filius Caeli suggested having the Baronial Council rule the nation, like may be the custom in Borrd. This suggestion was not supported by any of the barons. Although there may have been some mix up with the barons’ military duties, the resident Baroness Juliette actually spoke against council rule over the Riding. Since the <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/2015_Baronial_Council">2015 Baronial Council</a> already proclaimed that supplying the knights of Plort with grain is considered a military matter, no further decision was made. Beyond the resident barons’ military rights and obligations, the Riders of Sittorese are left to their own devices and the ancient <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Law_of_Goodriding">Law of Goodriding</a>.<br><br>Since nobody attempted to negotiate the borders, no decision was required and Barony July now exists in the boundaries initially set up by the Edict of Bast.<br><br>Barons July, Juliette, and VixenMage made no attempt to negotiate about the territory Baron Phobos proposed to cede to them, and not even Baron Phobos opposed to the Raven’s  counter-proposal. Thus, Baron Thanasius Ampelius now, by a vote of one to zero, holds territories in Ozerbord and in the Riding of Sittorese.<br><br>Baron Phobos proposal of ceding certain portions of Baron Araeph&#39;s lands to himself was supported by Baron Neshomeh.  Concerning Filius Caeli’s suggestion of dividing the land between Barons Phobos, Neshomeh, Kaitlyn and July, both Baron Neshomeh and Baron Kaitlyn messaged that they do not want any part of this territory. Thus, Baron Iximaz’s initial support of this suggestion is now obviously support of Baron PC’s proposal. Since there is a tie between Phobos/Neshomeh and PC/Iximaz, no decision was made. Baron Araeph keeps all of her territory until next year’s baronial Council, when she may lose it all if she continues neglecting her barony.<br><br>((The Keeper of the Records probably got the customs of Borrd wrong. The Protectorate of Borrd is actually not governed by the Baronial Council of all Barons of the Union of Plort. The Council of Borrd is apparently meant to be an assembly of barons who hold territories in Borrd (currently Araeph, Cassie, Huinesoron, Iximaz, July, Kaitlyn, PC and Phobos). It assembles rarely and where its secret proceedings are filed is unknown. <br><br>Also, the Keeper of the Records is no cartographer. Redrawing the maps is somebody else’s problem.<br><br>HG))</p>

            <p>I&#39;m just gonna copy and paste this here.<br><br>&quot;SO A FRIEND AND I ACTUALLY JUST DID THE MATH ON THIS.<br><br>Between 1972-1979 there were 5,802,282 live births in the United Kingdom. These live births account for the roughly 600 Hogwarts students during Harry’s first year, and would make the birth rate of Wizards approximately 0.01% of the population.<br><br>The population of the United States in 2014 was 318.9 million -  23.1% of which were children 0-17. That would mean there were 73,665,900 children in 2014. Checking live births from a time period of 1997-2003 (which would account for children aged 11-17) gives us 27,978,287 children. If 0.01% of them were magical, we’re left with 27,978 school age magical children in the United States in 2014.<br><br>If we wanted school sizes similar to Hogwarts - 600 children to a school - we would need at minimum 47 magical schools. If we wanted it more comparable to our own schooling - with an average student body size of roughly 1,430 students combined between middle school and high school during the 2009-2010 school years - we’re down to a minimum of 20 magical schools.<br><br>So, long story short. It is statistically impossible for there to be a single magical school in the United States.<br><br>It’s far more likely there is at least one school in each state, possibly more than one in much larger states like Alaska, Texas, and California while a single school could feasibly serve the clustered smaller states like Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.&quot;</p>

            <p>After all I think the Salem Witches Institute was already identified at some point.  But I suspect there are quality levels to them.  Ilvermorney would be equivalent to the Ivy League Schools.  The best of the best, super exclusive.  Then you would have others that would correspond to universities, state colleges, and all the way down to the community colleges.  That&#39;s what I would expect, especially if your numbers are correct.  <br><br>  </p>

            <p>(I was going to do this as a ficlet, but I&#39;m moody, so no.)<br><br>I think one of the greatest losses when the Rap (Rappaport&#39;s Law) came down was the American wandmaking tradition.<br><br>We know that Ilvermorny - the first and preeminent European-instituted magical school on the continent - began its life as a &#39;wandwork&#39; school, and that it taught people who didn&#39;t have wands. We know that its joint heads were a carpenter, and someone with a knack for befriending magical creatures. It is hardly a stretch to conclude that wandmaking was taught at Ilvermorny from the very earliest days. So the children taught there went out into the world trained not only in using wands, but in <i>making</i> them as well.<br><br>Who remembers that Native American wizards are particularly gifted with plants? I would bet that claim in the <i>MACUSA-Approved History of Magic in North America</i> stems in part from the fact that, starting at Ilvermorny and spreading like wildfire to the west, they took up the cause of handcrafting unique wands like a fish takes to water.<br><br>I imagine that expert wandmakers - perhaps not quite Ollivander&#39;s calibre, but highly skilled - would have been plentiful. There would have been experimentation with unusual woods, and samples from every magical creature you can imagine. When Ollivander eventually declared three cores to be supreme, it was American research he was building on.<br><br>But <i>old</i> research. 150 years (or so) after Ilvermorny rose, the Rap came down. Any action which might expose a wizard was banned. Children weren&#39;t allowed wands until they went to Ilvermorny - and those wands were strictly controlled. Remember the wand permits from the ?<br><br>But how do you enforce that rule, when everyone and her grandmother knows how to make a wand? Wandlore must have been absolutely <i>smashed</i>. I&#39;m picturing mass-Obliviation, harsh punishments - anything to stop people making wands.<br><br>By the 1920s, only four wandmakers remained. None of them lived anywhere near MACUSA headquarters - we&#39;ve got Louisiana, Arkansas, and somewhere between Florida and Mississippi. They were the last gasps of an ancient tradition - tolerated, but not allowed to pass on their learning. When Quintana died, White River Monster spines vanished from the market - he had no successor.<br><br>Why were they tolerated? Because by this time, MACUSA and Ilvermorny were facing a crisis. Wands weaken when they&#39;re passed to a new user; some of them stop working entirely unless they&#39;re given a new core. The great Hall of Wands at Ilvermorny must have been half-empty, and what remained were refurbs, second-hand wands, and the ones that didn&#39;t fit with any personalities.<br><br>My guess? The Southern wandmakers came out into the open in 1892 - the Great Sasquatch Rebellion. Recall the odd statement that Beauvais wands were used &#39;in battle&#39; - whatever their attributes, these were wands that first became famous during a magical war. Did not-yet-President Pickles fight against the Rebellion? I would bet on it.<br><br>All of a sudden, as 1900 rolled round, magic in America was more powerful than it had been for generations. And oh, look, that&#39;s when the wand permits were introduced. Funny how things fit together, isn&#39;t it?<br><br>American wandlore was a marvel of the pre-Industrial world. It suffered in silence for 170 years, from 1790 to 1965; I only hope it has since recovered and reclaimed its former, unique glory.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>-In 1790, the border of the US was approximately the Mississippi.<br><br>-The other side of the river was nominally French or Spanish, but in practice was inhabited by Native Americans.<br><br>-MACUSA&#39;s <i>History</i> claims that Native Americans were particularly skilled with plants and animals.<br><br>-Plants and (magical) animals are exactly what you use to make wands.<br><br>-I know how they stopped wandlore spreading in the USA: &quot;Oh, you want to play with twigs and Wampus hair?

            <p>I said in my &#39;things I flagged&#39; that MACUSA President Seraphina Picquery is Super Speshul. But is she? What do we actually know about President Pickles?<br><br>-She was born, raised, or otherwise associated with Savannah, Georgia. She wouldn&#39;t have had a wand until she went to school, and would probably not have seen much magic before that time.<br><br>-She was taught at Ilvermorny. That means she got her first wand from the Ilvermorny Hall of Wands.<br><br>-At Ilvermorny, she was offered the choice of all four houses. She chose Horned Serpent.<br><br>-She was &#39;famously gifted&#39;; this probably first showed itself at school.<br><br>-Her adult wand was a Beauvais, which means it was swamp mayhew and rougarou hair. A rougarou is... basically a werewolf (the name is actually derived from the French for &#39;werewolf&#39;), and the wand is supposed to have an affinity for Dark magic. They&#39;re also specifically said to be used in battle.<br><br>-She was the president who said &#39;The Gigglewater is non-negotiable&#39; during Prohibition.<br><br>-In her official capacity, she dressed like this:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Fantastic3.jpg"><br><br>-She considers this to be appropriate treatment of suspected criminals, one of whom is a foreign national:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/MACUSAPrisoners.png"><br><br><hr>
<br><br>So what does this tell us? To me, it speaks of someone with personality flaws a mile wide.<br><br>The key is that &#39;honour&#39; she received when all four house-emblems accepted her. So she&#39;s a Scholar-Warrior-Healer-Adventurer? A detail-oriented, anger-prone, sympathetic idealist? And <i>that</i> string of characteristics doesn&#39;t ring any alarm bells?<br><br>I think what President Pickles has is parts of all four natures, but with no natural balance between them. She&#39;s steadfast to the point of stubbornness; she thinks she has self-knowledge, but what she has is arrogance. She has been told from the age of 11 (or earlier!) that she is special - the Sorting, the &#39;famously gifted&#39; - and her life has never tempered that.<br><br>All her attributes, she honestly sees as unambiguously positive. &quot;When I fight,&quot; one imagines her saying, brandishing her Dark magic-friendly wand, &quot;I fight to win.&quot; She is a champion of justice - if by that you mean &#39;anyone who crosses her in her righteousness will regret it&#39;. She is a scholar (she chose Horned Serpent) who thinks she can predict the future - not by magic, but simply by <i>how much she knows</i>. She is here to &#39;fix&#39; Wizarding America - and she&#39;s not shy about breaking a few dragon eggs along the way.<br><br>If I&#39;m right, she has the potential to be a far more complex villain than Voldemort. Voldemort&#39;s goal was to live forever and rule everything; President Pickles &#39;just wants what&#39;s best for the people&#39; - which happens to be her ruling everything with an iron wand. You, the viewer, will agree with every one of her goals, and nod along with each step of her logi...il she hits the step about &quot;so you have to do exactly what I say.&quot;<br><br>She is, in fact, Granny Weatherwax gone bad.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I wasn&#39;t actually trying to hold a discussion, I was merely giving my opinion on the comparison, like the people before me. However since apparently disagreeing means you have to support everything you say, here it is: Everything we&#39;very seen of Granny Weatherwax vs what we&#39;very seen of President Picquery says that Granny is both more ambitious and more talented. (Better written too, in my opinion but I can&#39;t back that up so I suppose that it doesn&#39;t count.)<br><br>If Granny went bad, especially in a setting like Harry Potter, she wouldn&#39;t settle for one country.

            <p>I disagree with you in part about Granny, and since disagreement with explanation is an excellent way to continue a conversation (as opposed to, say, &#39;you&#39;re wrong&#39; and nothing more), I&#39;ll clarify why.<br><br>Granny was always about the headology, and that works best when you know the person. Think of all those conversations she had, often reported, with the people of Lancre - all the little details she sprinkled in to manipulate them into doing what&#39;s best for them.<br><br>I think if Granny went bad, she would&#39;ve taken over Lancre, absolutely; but beyond the borders? I doubt it. She doesn&#39;t know those people. Think of what Lily did - she picked a city, and she moulded it to her own ends.<br><br>If Granny was going to expand, she&#39;d do so sideways. I can&#39;t imagine her trying to conquer Ankh-Morpork... but I can absolutely see her taking over/down Elfland. They&#39;re a danger; there would be... a reckoning.<br><br>As to President Pickles, we don&#39;t have a clear idea how ambitious <i>or</i> talented she is. She was &#39;famously gifted&#39;; she carried a battle-wand; she chose to be a scholar (ie, she knew the value of information); she got herself elected or appointed to the highest office.

            <p>-The Irish will no doubt be up in arms about their sacred figure (the Morrigan) being reimagined as an Animagus. Right?<br><br>-Har har, &#39;A Liar&#39;s Story&#39;. There&#39;s a joke most of America has the wrong accent to get.<br><br>-Ilvermorny was half-founded by a Muggle! It was also founded in explicit imitation of Hogwarts, neatly explaining the four houses.<br><br>-The houses themselves... this is a really important point: they&#39;re not named after <i>magical species</i>, as various people objected to last time. They&#39;re named after <i>individual magical creatures</i>. Horned Serpent is named for the individual who lives nearby; Pukwudgie is named for William. Thunderbird is named for (the?) Thunderbird, which nothing here says has to be a species - just like the Horned Serpent, it&#39;s referred to in the individual. We already know it&#39;s related to the phoenix - could it be an ancestor?<br><br>--Following from that, I&#39;d love to know the story of Webster&#39;s Wampus. We had mentions of them watching Wampus cubs playing - did he have a pet? A friend?<br><br>--And what about Chadwick&#39;s encounter with the Thunderbird? I bet there&#39;s a story there.<br><br>-Ilvermorny was founded as a wandmaking school! The education side of things only came in as trade.<br><br>-The early students <b>and teachers</b> at Ilvermorny were in part Native American (Wampanoag, Narragansett). Nor were the students all children. And James was a teacher (and joint head), too - a Muggle! Yes, but remember, <i>wandmaking school</i>. He was a craftsman, not a wizard.<br><br>-JKR sketches excellent action sequences (the entirety of Update 5), but they give me very little to say, other than:<br><br>-Ilvermorny has Pukwudgie security. <sup>_<sup><br><br>-It</sup></sup> also has a really convoluted Sorting Ceremony, and I think I know why: the Rap. Wait, hang on a minute:<br><br>-<b>The Rap was repealled in 1965</b>. Victory! Anyway:<br><br>-Magic was strictly regulated outside Ilvermorny. It&#39;s quite likely most of the students had never seen any flashy magic at all prior to reaching the school. So yes, the first thing they&#39;re shown is moving, mind-reading statues - to make a big impression.<br><br>-President Pickles is Super Speshul. Oh dear. She&#39;s still a villain though.<br><br>-Wands are (or were) heavily controlled - but also &#39;state-funded&#39; as it were. And the &#39;large hall&#39; implies something much more dynamic than a fussy old man trying a few wands to see what works best for you. We know the school has a flair for the dramatic, after all.<br><br>-The Houses! Yep, they were houses after all (awww; but at least it makes sense, with the Fauxgwarts thing). And how well did I <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=296770;search_term=pukwudgie">divine their themes</a>?<br><br>--Horned Serpent: The Mind, tends towards scholars. I guessed Water and either Friendly or Smothering. That&#39;s a big fat zero. My &#39;dull&#39; alternative pegged it as the Slytherin equivalent, which it... isn&#39;t. Ultimately, HS is basically &#39;Isolt wanted to be in Ravenclaw, so she made a copy of it&#39;. The Horned Serpent is shown to be something of a mystic, so this kind of fits too.<br><br>--Wampus: The Body, tends towards warriors. I guessed stealth. Haha no. My dull version was equivalent to Gryffindor, which is close: it&#39;s half of Gryffindor. Actually, I think Wampus is what I had Thunderbird pegged as. The first view we have of Wampus(es) in the wild is of rough-and-tumble play, so this fits the creature.<br><br>--Pukwudgie: The Heart, tends towards healers. I went with the trickster idea, but I&#39;m glad to be wrong - the idea of &#39;Pukwudgie with a heart of gold&#39; is kind of appealing. It also makes an interesting comment on the Muggle founder of the school - his house is the heart and the healer. I like it.<br><br>--Thunderbird: The Soul, tends towards adventurers. That&#39;s a... strange combination. I think what she means here is <i>idealists</i>, or simply <i>activists</i>. Chadwick was &#39;intelligent and tempestuous&#39;, and the house is named after something approximating a force of nature. I would be willing to bet that it was Thunderbird graduates who brought down the Rap.<br><br>-And finally, the most important thing, from the trailer:<br><br><b>What does this say?</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/WhatIsThis.png"><br><br>It shows up as the pages flick back, and seems almost to be a set of wand pictures? The second word could be &#39;Gormlaith&#39;, but her name was Gormlaith Gaunt, and her wand was Slytherin&#39;s. So what&#39;s the first word?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As you mention, the Houses being named for <i>specific beings</i> is a major step in the right direction. Still problematic, but somewhat less so. A friend of mine who&#39;s of Wampanoag descent pointed out that each being had a tie to the Wampanoag as well (that&#39;s whose territory the school is in, btw). It looks like JKR has tweaked it somewhat after the freak out by critics (that or the leaked info was even more premature than it should have been) - my friend also pointed out the school parallels the foundin of Dartmouth. <br><br>Now …in brief, the history of Dartmouth was &quot;look how great we are! We&#39;re gonna teach young Indian men to be ministers! Only we&#39;ll rarely if ever actually grant them permission to teach, and never treat them as equals to their white peers, and hold them to higher standards while granting more scholarships to white students . . . &quot; But at the same time, it was a heck of a lot more than almost any other university was willing to do. So I&#39;m very, very interested to see where JKR goes with this magical parallel. </p>

            <p>As someone who has, since learning of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, always wanted to be in Ravenclaw, it surprised me that I did not get the closest equivalent House, Horned Serpent. I&#39;m apparently a Pudwudgie. One of the questions should have been &quot;How do you handle open wounds?&quot; That would have weeded Pudwudgie right out. But, anyways, after complaining, I&#39;d say just one thing about this.<br><br>If Huinesoron is right, and Thunderbird is really the house for idealists and activists, it could be the most positive incarnation of... wait for it... Slytherin! Slytherins are known for their ambition and their cunning. An activist would basically be a Slytherin with the ambition of change. They don&#39;t like how things are, so their endgame is to change it. Of course, this could just be my crazy theory that all Slytherin&#39;s aren&#39;t so bad, and it used to be a rather pleasant house full of people who would later change the world before the pure-blood fanatics gave it a bad name and decent sorts who would otherwise have gone there begged desperately to go anywhere else, causing a general downward spiral. Think about it- ambition is not necessarily evil, especially if the ambition is, say, to gain love, or to effect change for the better. What&#39;s evil is ambition without bounds- ambition willing to do literally anything get what it wants. Gryffindor is Fire? So is Slytherin. Carefully bound by laws of morality and ethics, a Slytherin is a powerful force for good, like a fire in a fireplace. Left unbound, and it destroys everything while trying to feed itself, like a wildfire. ... Wow, I just went on a rant about how Slytherin isn&#39;t evil. Didn&#39;t expect that to happen. Sorry about that. Also, I guess we know why Voldy&#39;s so evil.<br><br>TL;DR: Thunderbird = Slytherin in proper, Slytherin =/= evil, Granz really doesn&#39;t like people assuming Slytherin = evil, and Ilvermorny is the reason Voldy&#39;s evil.</p>

            <p>Well... most of them.<br><br>I&#39;m glad we have a good explanation for the American school being so much like Hogwarts. :) <br><br>But hands-down my favorite part is that a Muggle not only helped found the school, he was also a teacher there! See, kids? Even if you never get your letter, you can still be part of the magic world! <s>meanwhile, my eleven year old self is crying in the corner over not getting a letter</s> But yeah... I just wonder how much of that diversity and openness lasted after MACUSA came into power. :(<br><br>Also, I <i>love</i> the idea of William still being around after all these years. Just... <br>The wand of Salazar Slytherin though, holy frijoles. I guess I shouldn&#39;t be surprised he had a basilisk core in his wand—wait a second, how the heck did he get that? Was it maybe a second wand, made from his own Chamber monster, or did he somehow get access to a basilisk while as a wee little kiddie? Still, very cool that it became a tree with healing leaves.  <br><br><br><br>(I got Thunderbird; no surprises there, I&#39;ve always wanted to see the world. I think it&#39;s a much better fit than any of the Hogwarts houses, for me at least.)</p>

            <p>My parents have a three-dog wall-hanging with knotwork very similar to the Pukwudgie there.<br><br>The Horned Serpent is a trefoil; that&#39;s used quite commonly as a symbol of the Trinity, but I have no doubt at all it has pre-Christian roots.

This image looks almost like an anatomical diagram - but also one of energy flows, with magic flowing in (or out!) through the spines. I get a feeling Pukwudgie kids get into some deep theory.<br><br>-Thunderbird: Air and Fire, the Free Spirit. There is no &#39;standard&#39; Thunderbird kid, they&#39;re all individuals - and their emblem shows this. It has no animal features, no eyes or mouth. It&#39;s a blank slate on which they write their own futures. (Dare I say, just like their namesake?)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><b>Slytherin’s Legacy</b><br><br>Slytherin’s wand remained inactive following Gormlaith’s command in Parseltongue. Isolt could not speak the language, but, in any case, she no longer wanted to touch the wand that was the last relic of her unhappy childhood. She and James buried it outside the grounds.<br><br>Within a year an unknown species of snakewood tree had grown out of the earth on the spot where the wand was buried. It resisted all attempts to prune or kill it, but after several years the leaves were found to contain powerful medicinal properties. This tree seemed testament to the fact that Slytherin’s wand, like his scattered descendants, encompassed both noble and ignoble. The very best of him seemed to have migrated to America.<br><br><b>Growth of the School</b><br><br>Ilvermorny’s reputation grew steadily throughout the following years. The granite house expanded to a castle. More teachers were recruited to meet the growing demand. Now witch and wizard children from all over North America were being sent to learn there and it became a boarding school. By the nineteenth century, Ilvermorny had gained the international reputation it enjoys today.<br><br>For many years, Isolt and James remained joint Headmaster and Headmistress, as beloved to many generations of students as members of their own families.<br><br>Chadwick became an accomplished and well-travelled wizard who authored Chadwick’s Charms Vols I – VII, which are standard texts at Ilvermorny. He married a Mexican Healer called Josefina Calderon and the Calderon-Boot family remains one of wizarding America’s most prominent today.<br><br>Prior to the creation of MACUSA (the Magical Congress of the United States of America), the New World was short of wizarding law enforcement. Webster Boot became what would now be known as an Auror for hire. While repatriating a particularly nasty Dark wizard to London, Webster met and fell in love with a young Scottish witch who was working at the Ministry of Magic. Thus did the Boot family return to its home country. Webster’s descendants would be educated at Hogwarts.<br><br>Martha, the elder of James and Isolt’s twins, was a Squib. Deeply loved though Martha was by her parents and adoptive brothers, it was painful for her to grow up at Ilvermorny when she was unable to perform magic. She eventually married the non-magical brother of a friend from the Pocomtuc tribe and lived henceforth as a No-Maj.<br><br>Rionach, the youngest of James and Isolt’s daughters, taught Defence Against the Dark Arts at Ilvermorny for many years. Rionach never married. There was a rumour, never confirmed by her family, that, unlike her sister Martha, Rionach was born with the ability to speak Parseltongue and that she was determined not to pass on Slytherin ancestry into the next generation (the American branch of the family was unaware that Gormlaith was not the last of the Gaunts, and that the line continued in England).<br><br>Isolt and James both lived to be over 100. They had seen the cottage of Ilvermorny become a granite castle, and they died in the knowledge that their school was now so famous that magical families all over North America were clamouring to educate their children there. They had hired staff, they had built dormitories, they had concealed their school from No-Maj eyes by clever enchantments: in short, the girl who had dreamed of attending Hogwarts had helped found the North American equivalent.<br><br><b>Ilvermorny Today</b><br><br>As might be expected of a school part-founded by a No-Maj, Ilvermorny has the reputation of being one of the most democratic, least elitist of all the great wizarding schools.<br><br>Marble statues of Isolt and James flank the front doors of Ilvermorny Castle. The doors open onto a circular room topped by a glass cupola. A wooden balcony runs around the room one floor above. Otherwise the space is empty except for four enormous wooden carvings representing the houses: the Horned Serpent, the panther Wampus, the Thunderbird and the Pukwudgie.<br><br>While the rest of the school watches from the circular balcony overhead, new students file into the round entrance hall. They stand around the walls and, one by one, are called to stand on the symbol of the Gordian Knot set into the middle of the stone floor. In silence the school then waits for the enchanted carvings to react. If the Horned Serpent wants the student, the crystal set into its forehead will light up. If the Wampus wants the student, it roars. The Thunderbird signifies its approval by beating its wings, and the Pukwudgie will raise its arrow into the air.<br><br>Should more than one carving signify its wish to include the student in its house, the choice rests with the student. Very rarely – perhaps once a decade – a student is offered a place in all four houses. Seraphina Picquery, President of MACUSA 1920 - 1928, was the only witch of her generation so honoured, and she chose Horned Serpent.<br><br>It is sometimes said of the Ilvermorny houses that they represent the whole witch or wizard: the mind is represented by Horned Serpent; the body, Wampus; the heart, Pukwudgie and the soul, Thunderbird. Others say that Horned Serpent favours scholars, Wampus, warriors, Pukwudgie, healers and Thunderbird, adventurers.<br><br>The Sorting Ceremony is not the only major difference between Hogwarts and Ilvermorny (though in so many ways the schools resemble each other). Once students have been allocated a house they are led into a large hall where they select (or are selected by) a wand. Until the 1965 repeal of Rappaport’s Law, which enforced very strict conformity with the Statute of Secrecy, no child was allowed a wand until they arrived at Ilvermorny. Moreover, wands had to be left at Ilvermorny during vacations and only upon attaining seventeen years of age was the witch or wizard legally allowed to carry a wand outside school.<br><br>The robes of Ilvermorny are blue and cranberry. The colours honour Isolt and James: blue because it was Isolt’s favourite colour and because she had wished to be in Ravenclaw house as a child; cranberry in honour of James’s love of cranberry pie. All Ilvermorny students’ robes are fastened by a gold Gordian Knot, in memory of the brooch Isolt found in the ruins of the original Ilvermorny cottage.<br><br>A number of Pukwudgies continue to work at the school into present day, all grumbling, all of them insisting that they have no wish to remain there and yet all of them mysteriously present year after year. There is one particularly aged creature who answers to the name of ‘William’. He laughs at the idea that he is the original William who saved Isolt and James’s lives, rightly pointing out that the first William would be over 300 years old had he survived. However, nobody has ever found out exactly how long Pukwudgies live. William refuses to let anybody else polish the marble statue of Isolt at the entrance of the school, and on the anniversary of her death every year he may be seen laying mayflowers on her tomb, something that puts him in a particularly bad temper if anyone is tactless enough to mention it.</p>

            <p><b>Gormlaith’s Revenge</b><br><br>The happy, busy family had no idea that grave danger was approaching them from afar. News had reached the old country that a new magical school had been set up in Massachusetts. The rumour was that the headmistress had been nicknamed ‘Morrigan’ after the famous Irish witch. However, it was only when she heard that the name of the school was ‘Ilvermorny’, that Gormlaith could believe that Isolt had managed to travel all the way to America undetected, to marry, not just a Muggle-born, but an actual Muggle, and to open a school that educated anybody with a shred of magic.<br><br>Gormlaith had purchased a wand at the despised Ollivanders to replace the precious family wand that had been handed down through generations before Isolt stole it. Determined that her niece would not know of her coming until it was too late, she unknowingly imitated Isolt by disguising herself as a man to make the crossing to America on the ship Bonaventure. Wickedly, she travelled under the name of William Sayre, which was that of Isolt’s murdered father. Gormlaith landed in Virginia and made her way stealthily towards Massachusetts and Mount Greylock, reaching the mountain on a winter’s night. She intended to lay waste to the second Ilvermorny, slaughter the parents who had thwarted her ambition of a great pure-blood family, steal her great nieces who were the last to carry the sacred bloodline, and return with them to Hag’s Glen.<br><br>At her first sight of the large granite building rising in the darkness from the peak of Mount Greylock, Gormlaith sent a powerful curse containing Isolt and James’s names towards the house, which forced them into an enchanted slumber.<br><br>Next, she uttered a single sibilant word in Parseltongue, the language of snakes. The wand that had served Isolt so faithfully for many years quivered once on the bedstand beside her as she slept, and became inactive. In all the years that she had lived with it, Isolt had never known that she held in her hand the wand of Salazar Slytherin, one of the founders of Hogwarts, and that it contained a fragment of a magical snake’s horn: in this case, a Basilisk. The wand had been taught by its creator to ‘sleep’ when so instructed, and this secret had been handed down through the centuries to each member of Slytherin’s family who possessed it.<br><br>What Gormlaith did not know, was that there were two other occupants of the house whom she had not put to sleep, for she had never heard of sixteen-year-old Chadwick and fourteen-year-old Webster. The other thing she did not know, was what lay at the hearts of their wands: the horn of the river serpent. These wands did not become inactive when Gormlaith spoke her word of Parseltongue. On the contrary, their magical cores vibrated to the sound of the ancient language and, sensing danger to their masters, began to emit a low musical note, exactly as the Horned Serpent sounds danger.<br><br>Both Boot boys woke and leapt out of bed. Chadwick looked instinctively through the window. Creeping through the trees towards the house was the silhouette of Gormlaith Gaunt.<br><br>Like all children, Chadwick had heard and understood more than his adoptive parents had ever imagined. They might have thought that they had shielded him from any knowledge of the murderous Gormlaith, but they were wrong. As a small boy, Chadwick had overheard Isolt discussing her reasons for escaping Ireland and, little though she and James realised it, Chadwick’s dreams had been haunted by the figure of an old witch creeping through the trees towards Ilvermorny. Now he saw his nightmare made true.<br><br>Telling Webster to warn their parents, Chadwick sprinted downstairs and did the only thing that seemed to make sense to him: he ran out of the house to meet Gormlaith and prevent her entering the place where his family slept.<br><br>Gormlaith was not expecting to meet a teenage wizard and she underestimated him at first. Chadwick parried her curse expertly and they began to duel. Within a few minutes Gormlaith, though far more powerful than Chadwick, was forced to concede that the talented boy had been well taught. Even as she sent curses at his head in an attempt to subdue him, and drove him back towards the house, she questioned him about his parentage for, she said, she would be loathe to kill a pure-blood of his talent.<br><br>Meanwhile Webster was trying to shake his parents awake, but the enchantment lay so deeply upon them that not even the sound of Gormlaith’s shouts and of curses hitting the house roused them. Webster therefore hurtled downstairs and joined the duel now raging just outside the house.<br><br>Two onto one made her job more difficult: moreover, the twin cores of the Boot boys’ wands, when used together against a common enemy, increased their power tenfold. Even so, Gormlaith’s magic was strong and Dark enough to match them. Now the duel reached extraordinary proportions, Gormlaith still laughing and promising them mercy if they could prove their pure-blood credentials, Chadwick and Webster determined to stop her reaching their family. The brothers were driven back inside Ilvermorny: walls cracked and windows shattered, but still Isolt and James slept, until the baby girls lying upstairs woke and screamed in fear.<br><br>It was this that pierced the enchantment lying over Isolt and James. Rage and magic could not wake them, but the terrified screams of their daughters broke the curse Gormlaith had laid upon them, which, like Gormlaith herself, took no account of the power of love. Isolt screamed at James to go to the girls: she ran to assist her adoptive sons, Slytherin’s wand in her hand.<br><br>Only when she raised it to attack her hated aunt did she realise that for all the good it would do her, the sleeping wand might as well have been a stick she had found on the ground. Gloating, Gormlaith drove Isolt, Chadwick and Webster backwards up the stairs, towards the place where she could hear her great-nieces crying. Finally she managed to blast open the doors to their bedroom, where James stood ready to die in front of the cribs of his daughters. Sure that all was lost, Isolt cried out, hardly knowing what she said, for her murdered father.<br><br>A great clatter sounded and the moonlight was blocked from the room as William the Pukwudgie appeared on the windowsill. Before Gormlaith knew what had happened, a poisoned arrow tip had pierced her through the heart. She let out an unearthly scream that was heard for miles around. The old witch had indulged in all manner of Dark magic in an attempt to make herself invincible, and these curses now reacted with the Pukwudgie’s venom, causing her to become as solid and as brittle as coal before shattering into a thousand pieces. The Ollivander wand fell to the ground and burst: all that was left of Gormlaith Gaunt was a pile of smoking dust, a broken stick and a charred dragon heartstring.<br><br>William had saved the family’s lives. In exchange for their gratitude he merely barked that he noticed Isolt had not bothered to say his name for a decade, and that he was offended that she only called him when in fear of her imminent death. Isolt was too tactful to point out that she had been calling on a different William. James was delighted to meet the Pukwudgie of whom he had heard so much and, forgetting that Pukwudgies hate most humans, he wrung the perplexed William’s hand and said how glad he was he had named one of the houses of Ilvermorny after him.<br><br>It is widely believed that it was this piece of flattery that softened William’s heart, because he moved his family of Pukwudgies into the house the next day and, complaining constantly as usual, helped them to repair the damage that Gormlaith had wreaked. He then announced that the wizards were too dim to protect themselves and negotiated a hefty retainer in gold for acting as the school’s private security/maintenance service. </p>

            <p><b>Four Houses</b><br><br>Isolt and James considered the Boot boys their adopted sons. Isolt told them the second-hand stories of Hogwarts she had learned from Gormlaith. Both boys yearned to attend the school, frequently asking why they could not all return to Ireland where they could wait for their letters. Isolt did not want to frighten the boys with the story of Gormlaith. Instead, she promised them that when they reached eleven years old, she would somehow find them wands (their parents’ wands being broken beyond repair) and they would start a school of magic right there in the cottage.<br><br>This idea caught Chadwick’s and Webster’s imaginations. The boys’ ideas of what a magical school ought to be like were based almost entirely on Hogwarts, so they insisted that it ought to have four houses. The idea of naming the houses after themselves, as the founders, was swiftly abandoned, because Webster felt a house called ‘Webster Boot’ had no chance of ever winning anything, and instead, each chose their favourite magical beast. For Chadwick, an intelligent but often temperamental boy, it was the Thunderbird that can create storms as it flies. For argumentative but fiercely loyal Webster, it was the Wampus, a magical panther-like creature that was fast, strong and almost impossible to kill. For Isolt, it was, of course, the Horned Serpent that she still visited and with which she felt a strange sense of kinship.<br><br>When asked what his favourite creature was, James was at a loss. The only No-Maj in the family was unable to consort with the magical creatures the others had begun to know well. Finally, he named the Pukwudgie, because the stories his wife told of curmudgeonly William always made him laugh.<br><br>Thus were the four houses of Ilvermorny created, and while the four originators did not yet know it, much of their own characters leaked into the houses they had so light-heartedly named.<br><br><b>The Dream</b><br><br>Chadwick’s eleventh birthday was fast approaching and Isolt was at a loss to know how to provide the wand she had promised him. As far as she knew, the wand she had stolen from Gormlaith was the only one in America. She did not dare dissect it to find out how it was made, and her investigations into the wands of the boys’ parents showed her only that the dragon heartstring and unicorn hair they had both contained, had long since shrivelled and died.<br><br>On the eve of his birthday, she had a dream that she went down to the creek to find the Horned Serpent, which rose up out of the water and bowed its head to her while she shaved a long shard from its horn. Waking in the darkness, she proceeded down to the creek.<br><br>The Horned Serpent was waiting there for her. It raised its head exactly as it had done in her dream, she took part of its horn, thanked it, then returned to the house and woke James, whose skill with stone and wood had already beautified the family cottage.<br><br>When Chadwick woke next day, it was to find a finely carved wand of prickly ash enclosing the horn of the serpent. Isolt and James had succeeded in creating a wand of exceptional power.<br><br><b>The Founding of Ilvermorny School</b><br><br>By the time Webster turned eleven, the reputation of the family’s little home school had spread. Two more magical boys from the Wampanoag tribe had been joined by a mother and two daughters from the Narragansett, all interested in learning the techniques of wandwork in exchange for sharing their own magical learning. All were provided with wands of Isolt’s and James’s making. Some protective instinct told Isolt to save the Horned Serpent cores only for her two adoptive sons and she and James learned to use a variety of other cores, including Wampus hair, Snallygaster heartstring and Jackalope antlers.<br><br>By 1634, the home school had grown beyond Isolt’s family’s wildest dreams. The house expanded with every passing year. More students had arrived and while the school was still small, there were enough children to fulfil Webster’s dream of inter-house competitions. However, as the school’s reputation had not yet expanded beyond the local Native American tribes and European settlers, there were no boarders. The only people to stay at Ilvermorny overnight were Isolt, James, Chadwick, Webster and the twin girls to whom Isolt had now given birth: Martha, named for James’s late mother, and Rionach, named for Isolt’s.</p>

            <p><b>The Horned Serpent</b><br><br>William began to introduce Isolt to the magical creatures with which he was familiar. They took trips together to observe the frog-headed Hodags hunting, they fought a dragonish Snallygaster and watched newborn Wampus kittens playing in the dawn.<br><br>Most fascinating of all to Isolt, was the great horned river serpent with a jewel set into its forehead, which lived in a nearby creek. Even her Pukwudgie guide was terrified of this beast, but to his astonishment, the Horned Serpent seemed to like Isolt. Even more alarming to William was the fact that she claimed to understand what the Horned Serpent was saying to her.<br><br>Isolt learned not to talk to William about her strange sense of kinship with the serpent, nor of the fact that it seemed to tell her things. She took to visiting the creek alone and never told the Pukwudgie where she had been. The serpent’s message never varied: ‘Until I am part of your family, your family is doomed.’<br><br>Isolt had no family, unless you counted Gormlaith back in Ireland. She could not understand the Horned Serpent’s cryptic words, or even decide whether she was imagining the voice in which he seemed to speak to her.<br><br><b>Webster and Chadwick Boot</b><br><br>Isolt was finally reunited with people of her own kind under tragic circumstances. As she and William foraged in the woods one day, a grisly noise not far away caused William to shout at Isolt to remain where she was, as he charged away through the trees, poisoned arrow at the ready.<br><br>Naturally, Isolt did not follow his instructions, and when she arrived shortly afterwards at a small clearing she found a horrific sight. The very Hidebehind that had previously tried to kill William had had more success with a pair of naпve humans who now lay dead upon the ground. Worse, two small boys lay seriously injured nearby, waiting their turn as the Hidebehind prepared to disembowel their parents.<br><br>The Pukwudgie and Isolt together made short work of the Hidebehind, which this time was destroyed. Delighted with their afternoon’s work, the Pukwudgie then continued blackberrying, ignoring the faint groans of the children on the ground. When the furious Isolt instructed him to help her carry the two small boys home, William threw a tantrum. The young boys, he said, were already as good as dead. It was against the beliefs of his kind to assist humankind, Isolt being the unfortunate exception because she had saved his life.<br><br>Outraged by the Pukwudgie’s callousness, Isolt told him that she would accept the saving of one of the boy’s lives as repayment. The two boys were so ill she was afraid to Apparate with them, but insisted on carrying them home. Grudgingly, the Pukwudgie consented to carry the older boy, whose name was Chadwick, while Isolt carried young Webster back to her shelter.<br><br>Once there, the furious Isolt told William that she had no further need of him. The Pukwudgie glared at her, then vanished.<br><br><b><br><br>Isolt had sacrificed her only friend for the two small boys who might not survive. Fortunately, however, they did so, and to her astonishment and delight, she realised that they were magical.<br><br>Chadwick and Webster’s wizarding parents had brought them to America in search of a fascinating adventure. This had ended in tragedy when the family had wandered into the woods and encountered the Hidebehind. Unfamiliar with the creature and taking it for a common or garden Boggart, Mr Boot had attempted to ridicule it, with the awful consequences that Isolt and William had witnessed.<br><br>The boys were so seriously ill for the first couple of weeks that Isolt did not dare leave them. It troubled her that in her haste to save the children she had not been able to give their parents’ bodies a decent burial, and when at last Chadwick and Webster seemed well enough to leave alone for a few hours, she returned to the forest with the intention of creating graves that the boys might one day visit.<br><br>To her surprise, when she arrived in the clearing she found a young man by the name of James Steward. He, too, was from the Plymouth settlement. Having missed the family he had befriended on his journey to America, he had gone into the forest to search for them.<br><br>As Isolt watched, James finished marking the graves he had dug by hand, then picked up the two broken wands that had lain beside the Boot parents. Frowning he examined the sparking core of dragon heartstring that protruded from Mr Boot’s, then gave it a casual wave. As invariably happens when a No-Maj waves a wand, it rebelled. James was sent flying backwards across the clearing, hit a tree and was knocked out cold.<br><br>He woke in a small shelter of branches and animal skins to find himself being nursed by Isolt. She could not hide her magic from him in such a confined space, particularly when she was brewing potions to aid the Boot boys’ recovery and using her wand to hunt. Isolt intended to Obliviate James once he was over his concussion and to send him back to the colony at Plymouth.<br><br>In the meantime, it was wonderful to have another adult to talk to, especially an adult who was already fond of the Boot boys and helped entertain them while they recovered from their magical injuries. James even helped Isolt construct a stone house on the top of Greylock, providing a workable design, having been a stonemason in England, which Isolt made a reality in the space of an afternoon. Isolt christened her new home ‘Ilvermorny’ after the cottage in which she had been born, and which Gormlaith had destroyed.<br><br>Every day, Isolt vowed to Obliviate James, and every day, his fear of magic wore off a little more, until finally it seemed simplest to admit that they were in love, marry and have done with it.</b></p>

            <p>Along with my comments:<br><br><b>Irish Beginnings</b><br><br>Isolt Sayre was born around 1603 and spent her earliest childhood in the valley of Coomloughra, County Kerry, in Ireland. She was the offspring of two pure-blood wizarding families.<br><br>Her father, William Sayre, was a direct descendant of the famous Irish witch Morrigan (1), an Animagus whose creature form was a crow. William nicknamed his daughter ‘Morrigan’ for her affinity for all natural things when she was young. Her early childhood was idyllic, with parents who loved her and were quietly helpful to their Muggle neighbours, producing magical cures for humans and livestock alike.<br><br>However, at five years old, an attack upon the family home resulted in the death of both of her parents. Isolt was ‘rescued’ from the fire by her mother’s estranged sister, Gormlaith Gaunt (2), who took her to the neighbouring valley of Coomcallee, or ‘Hag’s Glen,’ and raised her there.<br><br>As Isolt grew older she came to realise that her saviour was in reality her kidnapper and the murderer of her parents. Unstable and cruel, Gormlaith was a fanatical pure-blood who believed that her sister’s helpfulness to her Muggle neighbours, was setting Isolt upon a dangerous path to intermarriage with a non-magical man. Only by stealing the child, Gormlaith believed, could their daughter be brought back to the ‘right way’: raised in the belief that as a descendant of both Morrigan and Salazar Slytherin she ought to associate only with pure-bloods.<br><br>Gormlaith set herself to be the model she thought Isolt needed by forcing the child to watch, as she cursed and jinxed any Muggle or animal that strayed too near their cottage. The community soon learned to avoid the place where Gormlaith lived, and from then on the only contact Isolt had with the villagers she had once been friends with, was when local boys threw stones at her as she played in the garden.<br><br>Gormlaith refused to allow Isolt to take up her place at Hogwarts when the letter arrived, on the basis that Isolt would learn more at home than at a dangerously egalitarian establishment full of Mudbloods. However, Gormlaith herself had attended Hogwarts, and told Isolt a great deal about the school. In the main, she did this to denigrate the place, lamenting that Salazar Slytherin’s plans for the purity of wizardkind had not been fulfilled. To her niece, isolated and mistreated by an aunt she believed to be at least half insane, Hogwarts sounded like a kind of paradise and she spent much of her teens fantasising about it.<br><br>For twelve years, Gormlaith enforced Isolt’s cooperation and isolation through powerful Dark magic. At last the young woman developed sufficient skill and courage to escape by stealing her aunt’s wand, for she had never been permitted her own. The only other object that Isolt took with her was a gold brooch in the shape of a Gordian Knot that had once belonged to her mother. Isolt then fled the country.<br><br>Scared of Gormlaith’s retribution and her prodigious tracking powers, Isolt moved first to England, but before long Gormlaith was on her tail. Determined to hide in such a way that her adoptive mother would never find her, Isolt cut off her hair. Masquerading as a Muggle boy called Elias Story, she set sail for the New World on the Mayflower in 1620.<br><br>Isolt arrived in America among the earliest Muggle settlers (Muggles are known as ‘No-Majs’ in the American wizarding community, from ‘No Magic’). On arrival she vanished into the surrounding mountains, leaving her erstwhile shipmates to suppose that ‘Elias Story’ had died of the harsh winter, like so many others. Isolt left the new colony partly because she remained afraid that Gormlaith would track her, even to a new continent, but also because her journey aboard the Mayflower had led her to deduce that a witch was unlikely to find many friends among the Puritans.<br><br>Isolt was now quite alone in a harsh, foreign country and, as far as she knew, the only witch for hundreds if not thousands of miles -her partial education by Gormlaith had not included information about Native American wizards. However, after several weeks alone in the mountains, she met two magical creatures of whose existence she had hitherto been ignorant.<br><br>The Hidebehind is a nocturnal, forest-dwelling spectre that preys on humanoid creatures. As the name suggests, it can contort itself to hide behind almost any object, concealing itself perfectly from hunters and victims alike. Its existence has been suspected by No-Majs, but they are no match for its powers. Only a witch or wizard is likely to survive an attack by a Hidebehind.<br><br>The Pukwudgie is also native to America: a short, grey-faced, large-eared creature distantly related to the European goblin. Fiercely independent, tricky and not over-fond of humankind (whether magical or mundane), it possesses its own powerful magic. Pukwudgies hunt with deadly, poisonous arrows and enjoy playing tricks on humans.<br><br>The two creatures had met in the forest and the Hidebehind, which was of unusual size and strength, had not only succeeded in capturing the Pukwudgie, which was young and inexperienced, but had also been on the point of disembowelling him when Isolt cast the curse that made it flee. Unaware that the Pukwudgie, too, was exceptionally dangerous to humans, Isolt picked him up, carried him to her makeshift shelter and nursed him back to health.<br><br>The Pukwudgie now declared himself bound to serve her until he had an opportunity to repay his debt. He considered it a great humiliation to be indebted to a young witch foolish enough to wander around in a strange country, where Pukwudgies or Hidebehinds might have attacked her at any moment, and her days were now filled with the Pukwudgie’s grumbling as he trudged along at her heels.<br><br>In spite of the Pukwudgie’s ingratitude, Isolt found him amusing and was glad of his company. Over time, a friendship developed between them that was almost unique in the history of their respective species. Faithful to the taboos of his people, the Pukwudgie refused to tell her his individual name, so she dubbed him ‘William’ after her father. <br><br><br>(1) Morrigan (or The Morrigan) - Celtic goddess of witchcraft, also known as the Queen of Crows.<br><br>(2) !!! GAUNT?!</p>

            <p>It was a serious attempt to get permission in the most ancient way mentioned by JulyFlame <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=298693;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>, solely depending on reputation, never doing anything <i>specifically</i> done to get Permission. Even the links to the &quot;writing examples&quot; are rather there for newbies who haven’t been around at the time; the PGs could have seen all of this, and more hints on what I’m planning to do with my prospective agents, when it was created or plugged on the Board.<br><br>Although it worked for me, the obvious disadvantage is that it took nearly three years, and most Boarders aren’t this patient (and having built reputation before joining the PPC by writing fanfiction the PGs liked to read doesn’t work anymore due to diversity).<br><br>The lesson that might be learned here is: If you know how to make the PGs <i>wanting</i> to give you Permission, just do it; if you don’t, continue learning and follow the advice that’s there to help. <br><br>(As JulyFlame mentioned, I knew already that some PGs <i>did</i> want to give me Permission, and I was preparing a longwinded answer explaining how I didn’t want to be <i>speshul</i> and get Permission in a non-regular way before I even asked for it. But then the discussion about the Permission process started again, and I realized that there is no regular way, there are only best practices that change over time and never fit everybody.)<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I have been talking with Laburnum. I&#39;ve come up with a universe idea. I&#39;m still fleshing things out in my head. It is somewhat inspired by the upside magic book, Ratman manga (long time ago i read it), a dash of harry potter, School of Good and Evil, and some X-men, and a lot of Discworld.<br><br>Basically, the universe does have powers,, aka, superhero like. At the moment, the current idea is that they do run in families, and there are external and internal powered powers, so some hard fact there. The idea is that most powers are regulated for use in jobs. Like, imagine taxi drivers, or delivery people with phasing powers. Telekinesis for those handling chemicals.<br><br>There are at the moment in my head, 3 schools, Hero School, Dark Hero School and Villain School.  The schools are influenced by the Discworld Guilds, so villain students do have a percentage of jobs they need to do. Of course, also have to pay taxes and Social security for minions and the like.<br><br>At the moment, our Protagonist, is Verminious, a girl enrolled at the villain school after her audition at hero school ended with her kicking a guy somewhere delicate. Her power is the ability to communicate with vermin. As she put it, &quot;They only let me talk to cute animals.&quot;<br>&quot;Or super-dramatic ones for the Dark Heroes. Everyone does tigers, I want rats.&quot;<br>Those lines were from Laburnum.<br><br>I was thinking that I would do it more slice of life story. I was also thinking of throwing out hero, dark hero and villain applications later here ala OFU style. <br><br>The three Schools are considered jobs, and like civic duties as well. I am curious what people think, and if anyone is willing to beta.</p>

            <p>Something like a book I saw a long time ago but didn&#39;t get a chance to read. So, I&#39;m going to guess that her name isn&#39;t actually Verminious, and that&#39;s just a cover. Are there different levels of powers and stuff? And are there things you can&#39;t do in certain schools? Like, you can be a doctor if you attend Hero School, but if you attend Dark Hero School, you&#39;ve got to, say, work as a tax official? However you write it, it looks like an interesting story that I&#39;d love to read.</p>

            <p>Yes, there are different levels of power and stuff. At the moment, the standard is in families. There are internal fueled ones and external fueled ones. So if you use internal, better eat alot. And external, well, your water powers don&#39;t work in a desert.</p>

            <p>At the moment, that&#39;s her villain name.  She&#39;s technically a side villain. And joining the school is a career option. Basically, the idea right now is slice of life. I will be writing up the ideas in a googledoc. The idea is that most poeple have powers, ala Xanth, of Anothony Piers. Villain students do need to commit crimes and the like. Verminious does get sentenced to villain school after an incident at her tryouts for dark hero school. As you can guess, Villain school isn&#39;t that popular. Then again, Hero adn dark Hero schools do get corporate sponsorships from cool companies. (the corporate sponorship is inspired from a manage called ratman, where companies have made their own heroes for advertising purposes. <br><br></p>

            <p>Its still in alpha design. But if people want ot suggest apprentice hero ideas, go ahead. I might put out OFU like applications. Since in this verse, heroining and villaining are jobs. So you need insurance and the like. Of course, Heroes get all the good publicity though.<br><br>At the moment, the Villain school is.....<br>A circus school. What? Its a good hiding place, also, CLOWNS!<br><br>The idea is to do it in the Terry Pratchett style, run with it and logically. Then, as my skills get back from being rusty, then we move onto true plot.

            <p>(Since there was no new on-topic discussion for a while.)<br>-Bramandin suggested (in the post above) to make the Permission prompts optional.

            <p>Apparently nobody opposes the idea that there are no rules, just guidelines, and it’s demonstrably possible to get Permission not taking the formalities serious. <br><br>I don’t know how much the current Permission Givers depend on writing examples being about the prospective agents. &quot;I don’t like writing out-of-context scenes for my agents, I’d rather show you my latest canon-compatible <i>Harry Potter</i> fanfic and a silly adventure in the <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/BoardDungeon.htm">Dungeon of the Board</a>&quot; may work with some PGs, while &quot;I’d rather show you my very dark twenty-thousand words fanfic set in a fandom you apparently don’t appreciate&quot; certainly wouldn’t.<br><br>Getting Permission <i>should</i> be easy for everybody who knows what to do with it, while going through several iterations should be a valuable learning process for everybody who needs and actually wants to improve. <br><br>Maybe we should blatantly say that &quot;There is actually only one requirement: Convince the Permission Givers (at least one of them) that you won’t do anything bad with your Permission and that you understand what would be considered bad in the first place. If you got a medium understanding of the PPC, you may already have an idea of how to do this, so just do it, but don’t complain if it doesn’t work because you didn’t do the research. In case you don’t know what to do, here are some guidelines, which may be followed to the letter or in spirit, or may just be taken as hints to what might work, or completely ignored – if you <i>really</i> know what you’re doing.&quot;<br><br>Or would this confuse Permission seekers even more?<br><br>Concerning mentoring, there is already a mentoring system, although none of the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Sib/Little_Sib">Sib Houses</a> specializes in guiding newbies through the Permission process.

            <p>First of all, let it be known that I oppose the idea that there are no rules, merely guidelines. That is not to say that rules are never to be broken — however, a good reason is needed.<br><br>Anyway: for me at least, part of looking at a Permission request is seeing whether the requester knows the PPC&#39;s canon (such as it is). Some of the more glaring mistakes can be caught solely on the basis of agent bios, but some less-obvious ones can only be caught when brought up in writing; I think it&#39;s rather hard to judge the quality of someone&#39;s PPC writing without seeing any sort of PPC writing.<br>However, I wouldn&#39;t be averse to people saying, &quot;I wrote a prompt, but instead of the control prompt I have this super-special-mega-awesome <i>Lord of the Rings</i>&quot; — after all, it&#39;s a good way to gauge one&#39;s writing.<br><br>As to mentoring, well, Sib Houses are, AFAICT, pretty much dead. If we want that sort of thing for Permission — and the more I think about it, the more I like this idea — we should institute something new.</p>

            <p>Which to be fair was discussed by basically no one here on the board. It was dismissed out of hand by hS but that&#39;s about it.<br><br>So, revised edition of Data&#39;s suggestion: keep the prompts as optional. Change requirements so instead of two PPC -based works you have one in the PPC and one other of whatever the author chooses. Set the word limit for each between 500-700 words.<br><br>Unlike what hS has said, this isn&#39;t &#39;just write anything (but make sure it&#39;s the right sort of thing)&#39; it&#39;s &#39;write whatever you like as long as the quality is good.&#39; In fact I would recommend a set of optional prompts for the second piece as well, to help those who have problems coming up with something. Maybe something along the lines of the prompts from the &quot;imagine your ocs&quot; tumblr blogs. Counter to what people seem to believe, I am not out to tear down the whole system, nor am I out to make things harder. On the contrary, I want to make it as easy for new people to get permission as it was for me.<br><br>In the five years since I got permission it has only gotten progressively harder, and I think that&#39;s wrong. I was able to get it in one try with the first chapter of the second worst fanfic I&#39;ve ever written, and Nesh even complimented me on the writing. If it was that easy once upon a time, why should it be so hard for everyone else?</p>

            <p>OK, so. This post is going to be a jumble because there are multiple points to address and I don&#39;t have a particular order.<br>1) I don&#39;t like hS&#39; move here. While I understand where he&#39;s coming from because people keep dissing his work without suggesting viable alternatives, which frankly is frustrating to face and mildly annoying to see from the sidelines, it isn&#39;t his prerogative to say &quot;now we do things differently&quot; (it&#39;s the community&#39;s).<br>2) Related to that: it&#39;s annoying to see people saying &quot;something&#39;s wrong with X! Fix it!&quot; without suggesting anything. At the very least, a direction should be pointed out (for example &quot;we should maybe think of using darker colours&quot; instead of &quot;this is ugly&quot;).<br>3) I think that getting Permission with prompts is easier than the system that was there before (where you had to show... something... as a sample). I agree with July here: she told me that she thinks that if the current system would&#39;ve been in place back when I requested Permission I&#39;d have gotten Permission in less tries, but it would have also hampered me as a writer (mainly, I think, because I would not have gone through the learning process of actually polishing my <s>turds</s> Permission pieces).<br>While I don&#39;t think the Permission process is set in stone (or that it should be so), I am definitely against making it easier or holding the aspiring PPC writers&#39; hands. Frankly, people with Permission should be able to deal with badfic, develop ideas and write something good based on it without someone else doing it for them. <br>4) W.r.t doctorlit&#39;s proposal: frankly, I don&#39;t think that the problem is &quot;people are asking for Permission way too early&quot;. In fact, the last 15 denied Permission requests were denied for technical writing reasons (SpaG and the like), creative writing reasons (for example, beige prose), agents not fitting, lack of PPC knowledge and one case of &quot;who are you?&quot;. Nor are the PGs flooded with work — 2016 saw seven Permission requests, which is a tad more than once per month. I also disagree with point 2 — for example, if you take me, I didn&#39;t improve because I had to wait a lot of time (I didn&#39;t), I improved because I actually put something up, it got critiqued, I worked with good betas and put another thing up and so on till I was good enough (which, in hindsight, was pretty meh).<br>However. I&#39;d like to bring an idea up for discussion: what if, instead of what we have today, Permission would involve an aspirant being mentored for some time? I&#39;m not sure whether I like this or not but I&#39;d like to see what other people think.</p>

            <p>I think that&#39;s a solid idea, but I don&#39;t know what it would entail; writing for the PPC is different from a lot of other styles of creative writing in part because it&#39;s a running commentary, much like an MST. There&#39;s not a single way to &quot;do it right.&quot;<br><br>That said, I can definitely think of a few things I&#39;d like help with in my own writing, and I&#39;ll go as far as to bet that most of us can.

            <p>I&#39;m talking a relatively long time, like, a full year, before a new member can ask for permission.  As seen with Hieronymus above, the amount of activity that a given Boarder can (potentially) show in that time may do a better job of not only showing the PGs their writing prowess and understanding of the community, but also give said newbie a feel for the setting through all the published stories, RPs, and in-character posts they&#39;ll see by then.<br><br>Or they&#39;ll realize the community/setting isn&#39;t what they thought it was, and drift away, as so many newbies do before a year passes.  This should:<br><br>1. Weed out at least some percentage of permission requests that were dramatically wide of the mark.<br>2. Improve the quality of permission requests overall, even if they&#39;re less formal, like HG&#39;s.<br>3. Reduce the frequency of permission requests the PGs need to address over time, and make them easier to respond to, since the PG should know the Boarder much better.<br><br>Questions/comments/complaints?<br><br>—doctorlit</p>

            <p>The prompts came about when I wasn&#39;t here, but if I remember rightly it was because people were finding it difficult to write anything <i>without</i> a prompt. Which possibly should have been an alarm.<br><br>To be honest, I wasn&#39;t exactly happy when, ages back, the shift started towards people writing short pieces set in the PPC for their permission piece. In my opinion, it was (and still is) cheating, because it&#39;s being custom written to the expected audience, and doesn&#39;t showcase how they usually write. <br><br>I am well aware that my opinion is different from most people&#39;s, and doesn&#39;t match the majority. <br><br>I&#39;ve ended up with a reputation for tending to deny permission rather than granting it because, to be honest, I think our standards have fallen dramatically in an attempt to continue to gain new writers, despite us becoming more and more isolated from the actual fanfic-writing portions of fandom. <br><br>At this point I&#39;m more interested in seeing that the people who do apply for permission (and get refused) show active progress in improvement, and that all of the writers we have in the PPC do the same, even once they have it. <br><br>Instead we&#39;re just seeing more and more stagnation and in some cases people using the PPC to prop up stories and characters that don&#39;t mesh with the universe.</p>

            <p>I think we can all think of a few missions, or even an author or two, which just don&#39;t fit the tone of the PPC. Unfortunately those seem to be becoming more common, as the seems to be a shift away from humor and towards drama. Not that drama is bad, or has no place in the PPC, but it is definitely not what we were originally aiming for.</p>

            <p>This actually just clicked in my head upon reading your post. Lemme know if this makes sense, folks.<br><br>Query: Why might we have more drama?<br><br>Answer: Drama sells. That is, drama gets attention gets reviews (or at least comments) gets warm fuzzies for the author.<br><br>What stories get the most attention around here? Not the same-as-usual humorous formula. We&#39;ve established downthread that ninety percent of that is crud, in accordance with Sturgeon&#39;s law. No; what gets attention is Legendaries, Emergencies, and other life-changing character drama. So if a go-getting PPC writer is losing interest in the formula and wants to break away and do something different, they turn to drama.<br><br>The corollary here is that ninety percent of standard &quot;agents banter&quot; missions are crud because nobody is paying attention to them, reviewing them, and helping them improve like they are with Sturm und Drang missions.<br><br>On the other hand, one obvious flaw in this logic is that anyone attempting to break the mold who isn&#39;t very good at it should, theoretically, be shouted down for doing it. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve seen this happen recently, though. Anyone else?<br><br>~Neshomeh, typing hastily at work.</p>

            <p>First - I&#39;m pretty surprised no one&#39;s arguing with anything I said. Nobody found any flaw with any of that stuff I typed out on the spur of the moment without the time to really think it through first? I&#39;m shocked, and maybe a bit appalled if that rather depressing scenario is true. O.o<br><br>That said, I&#39;ve been thinking more about the need to review missions, because I do stand by that. It strikes me that a) reviewing is hard, and b) reviewing humor is harder. Missions are supposed to be funny, but humor is subjective, after all. How do you critique it?<br><br>The first step is simply reporting your experience so the author knows how their work is being received. Did you crack a smile? Chuckle? Laugh out loud? If so, when? Do you know why it worked for you? If not, that&#39;s okay. If so, that&#39;s even better. Say so! If you didn&#39;t find any humor anywhere, say that, too. Maybe you were the only one and it&#39;s just a matter of taste, but maybe not, and the author needs to work on their ear for comedy. They need to know.<br><br>The next step, I think, is pointing out missteps and missed opportunities. Did you see a gag that almost worked, but didn&#39;t? How would you improve it? Did you see an opportunity for a gag that the author didn&#39;t take? What was it? I&#39;ve commented on missed opportunities before, most recently in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=297554;">a review of one of Des&#39; missions</a>. You can, too. It&#39;s then up to the author to decide whether or not they agree with you and apply the knowledge to their future work.<br><br>All of this, of course, requires you to be an active reader—that is, to notice your own thoughts and feelings as you read rather than just sitting back and passively experiencing the story. Not everyone likes to do this, but I&#39;d point out that being an active reader will make you a better writer, too. Certainly a better PPC writer. Noticing your thoughts and feelings about badfic and being able to tell why you&#39;re having them will give you substance for your missions, and may lead to fewer missteps and missed opportunities in your own work. It&#39;s a good habit to be in. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The thrust of my post was &#39;I don&#39;t get reviews for my missions; you seem to be saying that&#39;s either because or why they&#39;re rubbish, which I disagree with&#39;. But then I re-parsed your post and couldn&#39;t say that any more.<br><br>Since I was busy wallowing in self-criticism at the time, I wasn&#39;t really in a place to be commenting on your characterisation of everyone else. I&#39;m a bit better now, so I&#39;ll say this:<br><br>There are loads of PPC missions I don&#39;t like, and can&#39;t stand to read. But that doesn&#39;t make them bad. I heartily dislike Trojie and Pads&#39; stuff, for instance - it&#39;s wildly not my thing. Every time I&#39;ve tried to read something of Skarm&#39;s, it&#39;s been in some variant of script format and my brain&#39;s just shut down. IndeMaat? I&#39;ve never finished a single one of their missions.<br><br>But that&#39;s on me, not on them.<br><br>One thing I think would help with people reading the normal missions more is more informative subject-lines. &quot;New mission!&quot; tells me nothing, and I won&#39;t click unless I&#39;m desperate for something to read. &quot;New Agent Remora mission!&quot; is better, and if I enjoy Remora&#39;s missions I may well click. But the best option? &quot;New <i>Inside Out</i> mission!&quot;. I read for the canon, not for the agent; tell me what it is!<br><br>(And the best part? You can do both! &quot;New mission: Agent Remora takes on <i>Inside Out</i> Angstfic&quot; lets me know exactly what&#39;s there!)<br><br>hS, me-me-me (sorry, trying to get it out of my system)</p>

            <p>The times when I don&#39;t are when I&#39;ve already read it or had an active hand in its creation, whether through betaing or pre-reading in another capacity or just going through it before release and letting my characters leave sarcastic comments in the margins.

            <p>I didn&#39;t develop what I meant with that last point very well. Or, actually, at all. (This is why I should not try to say important things at work.) My thinking there was that—at least according to some people—we&#39;re as a community married to the status quo of the mission formula and very anti-change. Therefore, in order to get away with doing something different, you have to prove you know what you&#39;re doing first. See hS, July, myself (I guess), Tawaki, etc. Anybody who&#39;s ever done anything hugely different and had it stick did a bunch of normal stuff first, and earned the community&#39;s trust.<br><br>So the theory here is that the people who are writing the ten percent of missions that aren&#39;t crud are the <i>only</i> ones writing drama, disproving the idea that we&#39;re sliding unchecked into drama wholesale. Either that or that <i>everyone</i> writing drama is good enough to get away with it, disproving the idea that 90 percent of everything is crud.<br><br>I really expected someone to challenge the notion that 90 percent of everything written here is crud. I was being sarcastic there. I guess y&#39;all could tell.<br><br>ANYWAY, as for you in particular, Ix, I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s some controversy with a thing you&#39;ve done <i>recently</i>, but since I haven&#39;t had the time to keep up with my reading lately, I&#39;m not in a position to comment on that.<br><br>As for stuff you&#39;ve done before, I do recall some serious conversations dealing with concerns about some of it, so there&#39;s your shouting down. On the other hand, I also recall a lot of people supporting you, and you still seem to be here doing your thing. There are roughly two possibilities:<br><br>1. Your work sucks. All your critics are meanies out to tear you down and make you stop. Everyone who says they like your work is either an idiot or a lying sycophant. You were foolish enough to ignore the former while listening to the latter.<br><br>2. Your work doesn&#39;t suck. The people who offer critique are doing it because they care and want to see your writing continue to flourish and improve. The people who say they like your work actually do, and are not idiots for thinking so. You have more sense than your average FFN writer and know how to take both critique and praise for what they&#39;re worth.<br><br>Granted, there are various possibilities within these possibilities, but I reckon one is more true than the other. Which do you think is true?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>That while I am a bit of a &#39;good audience&#39;, liar and sycophant weren&#39;t part of the description.<br><br>The story you wrote for your characters <i>is</i> great, the drama comes from a &#39;Reality Ensues&#39;, not drama for the sake of the drama.

If you really &#39;derseved&#39; this hate, you wouldn&#39;t have people here telling you it has no reason to be. And please, do not let this drag you down.

            <p>Just what I can think of off the top of my head:<br><br>-The Key to Canon arc led to the creation of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1WpOpdT4j8hHeFLM1ZvFidJhla4skdr6Ts9rtkKCBtxw">the Spirit of Imagination</a>.<br><br>-The regeneration thing made the Aviator&#39;s storyline possible.<br><br>-Tawaki created the Agent and the Disentangler.<br><br>-TARDISes in HQ come from the Macrovirus epidemic. That&#39;s a second way the Aviator was made possible by Tawaki.<br><br>-The treatment of New Caledonia as an integral part of HQ comes from the epidemic, too.<br><br>-Morgan III exists because I regenerated a character I no longer used - in order to use her in the Mary Sue Invasion.<br><br>-The Continuity Council was created because I need them for something in Morgan&#39;s future; they&#39;ve grown vastly beyond that, to the point where they inform the character of every Time Lord in HQ.<br><br>-I would argue that the idea of HQ as somewhere your agents can and will run into other people&#39;s stems in large part from Tawaki&#39;s work - both his large cast of agents always crossing each other&#39;s paths, and the Emergencies he sparked off.<br><br>-OFU-Squared <a href="http://ofudisc.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/ofu-squared.html">may not</a> amount <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-ExprXkSDOUOEZHYUhMdmVVRW8/view">to much</a> yet, but there&#39;s a big story nearly completed, and that was Tawaki&#39;s brainchild.<br><br>-Outside the fictional realm, he was instrumental in getting the PPC noticed on TVTropes, and that&#39;s where vast numbers of our new members come from.<br><br>Was Tawaki a sparklingly brilliant writer? No. But he tried his absolute best to write stories that would entertain people. Along the way, he made the PPC into a far richer and more complex place, and I for one am glad he did.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I can write at least a little bit. Reading Tawaki&#39;s spinoff, and Trojie&#39;s, and hell, even TOS, it made me think &quot;I can do this. I can write to this standard, and I can write frequently and I can be as funny as these guys.&quot; And so I tried to be funny and witty, and I also tried to insert a long-form arc for my agents, because I wanted it to not <i>just</i> be jokes. How well I&#39;ve succeeded is entirely up to you guys, but I&#39;m pretty bloody certain we wouldn&#39;t have had Doktor Trollenfisch without Tawaki&#39;s spinoff showing me that I could write comedy like that, and <i>Frohliche Weihnachten!</i> was a damned fine mission in a Department that got very little attention otherwise.<br><br>In my opinion, anyway. Not that I&#39;m biased at all. =]<br><br>We&#39;re a shared universe community. Everyone and everything adds to it in some way, and regardless of your taste in individual spinoffs (there&#39;s this one twerp called wobblestheclown or something whose output is just <i>atrocious</i>) the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. Hell, I&#39;m in the process of hammering together an entirely new division mostly for an office-politics comedy thing, complete with irritating Flower and a main character who&#39;s a talking toilet brush from an &#39;80s sci-fi TV show. I don&#39;t expect there to be many stories set in that division, I don&#39;t expect people to care very much about it, but it&#39;s something a bit different and, most importantly of all, it&#39;s <i>fun</i>. That&#39;s what ought to matter most.<br><br>Also I invented the pov, a small, snuffly beanbag thingy that goes <i>snrf</i>, so that&#39;s something else we wouldn&#39;t have got without other users. =]</p>

            <p>I like this view a lot, as someone who has a ton of difficulty coming up with something new without a prompt. On the flip side, that makes PPC mission writing &quot;easy;&quot; there&#39;s a fairly strict formula, and the prompt would be the badfic in question.<br><br>As a result, one mission reads *exactly* like another. What is the point of writing fiction if it follows such a precise format? Missions may as well be academic papers for this reason. The only thing keeping the PPC going, as far as I can see, is the fact that the works the PPC kills are so incredibly bad that the bland mission is forgiven.</p>

            <p>Everything has been gradually changed to make it easier and easier for people to get permission, in theory, but we still have so many people who don&#39;t get the point of the PPC, or think certain items don&#39;t apply to them or struggle repeatedly with just meeting the bare minimum requirements. <br><br>Huinesoron, I&#39;m very sorry that this post and several of the replies here- no doubt mine in particular- are probably making you feel frustrated and possibly unappreciated (because you did a good deal of the work on the prompts and set up for this latest permission scheme, I believe?), and I don&#39;t mean for mine to have done so. <br><br>I am aware of how difficult it is to come up with an idea or thing that as many people can agree with and fits as many possible standards as possible without upsetting people, and I know you always try your hardest, especially where the PPC is concerned, because you consider it your home on the internet. <br><br>I have no good answer or idea that will satisfy people because mine would probably be to raise the standards higher and increase the wait period for people wanting to pursue Permission so we can get a better idea of them as people and possibly as collaborators, not just on how well they can string sentences together.<br><br>I have ideas on how to get more people here again from the fanfic writing corner of fandom, but that takes time- to write, to post, and to be present, and right now I&#39;m lacking in time to meet even the basic necessities of doing things that take longer than tidying and preparing for the next day on my work days, unless I cut back on sleep.<br><br>-July</p>

            <p>A couple things:<br><br>-Back when we discouraged people from using PPC writing as their sample, we kept running into variations on the same problem: &quot;Here&#39;s my super dark fic&quot;, or &quot;I don&#39;t really write fic, so here&#39;s a poem!&quot;, or &quot;Here&#39;s this story I wrote ten years ago, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any good these days&quot;, or simply, &quot;I don&#39;t write fanfic, what should I do?&quot;. Anyone designing a new Permission system (version 5, I think?) should consider ways to deal with that.<br><br>-Getting more fanfic-writing people in... yeah, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727893/1/PPC-Driftwood">I tried that myself</a>. One mission a week for about a month, then slowed down slightly. I managed... one review per chapter on average, and I recall maybe one person saying that&#39;s how they found us.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a lot of things I want to say but i&#39;m trying to be civil, so I&#39;ll restrain myself to just this. One of the ideasupposed that has come up before, and was actually considered a good idea when brought up on the Discord channel, is to sort of do a combination. We already require two samples, yes? Why not rule that one has to be PPC-related and the other can be whatever the applicant wants, to a maximum of somewhere between 500-700 words, so it&#39;s not too long? Personally I would drop the prompts altogether but I could see keeping them for the PPC related portion.</p>

            <p>I missed them being made optional. M6 suggestion still stands as a compromise between you and July. (That feels weird to say.) One PPC, one not.

            <p>That, according to you, a Permission Request should include:<br>- A short bio of your agents (200-400 words)<br>- A link to the badfic you wish to mission<br>- Thanks to your betas<br><br>But what about your <i>actual</i> writing skills? Frankly, mate, any sap can write a bio; that&#39;s the least difficult part. Bios don&#39;t tell people enough about how well you can interpret the established PPC canon. Take me as an example, if I was admitted only on the basis on my bios, I would to this day think that DIA is a secret PPC police that has the power to detain and &quot;remove&quot; agents (which I had to idea it&#39;s been a case before, lore-wise, when I first wrote that). I&#39;ve completely misunderstood prompt 2x5: &quot;One agent is mistaken for a Sue, and has to prove otherwise&quot; and had Will undergo interrogation, completely missing the point.<br><br>You also said this: &quot;<i>In my case, I needed a new prompt because they simply clashed with my agents. They weren&#39;t designed to have foodfights or chase children, they were designed to be good at missions.</i>&quot; But how does one contradict the other? Nobody forces you to write those scenarios in your spin-offs, or make your agents comedic and goofy (although that&#39;s the original PPC way). If you want to make them brooding serious badasses, go ahead - you have other prompts that support this (4x2.1; 4x3.1; 3x5.1 to name the few). And let&#39;s be honest for a second, I am sure there are people who cheated a little bit and picked themselves another prompt because the first choice didn&#39;t appeal to them.<br><br>Besides your own problems with the prompts, I haven&#39;t seen a single person complaining or having issues with them. I don&#39;t believe I was around when Data stated his problem, so I cannot really judge there, but I do have another question: What is your proposal then? How else can the PGs verify your PPC canon knowledge and the ability to portray it in writing?<br><br>tl;dr I am in favour of keeping the prompts, because of their importance.</p>

            <p>...But I&#39;d like to just say one more time that the writing should change a little. I don&#39;t know what the answer is, but I don&#39;t see a lot of variety in the writing that I see around here. &quot;Good writing&quot; doesn&#39;t mean writing that&#39;s almost identical to something else.<br><br>Sure, we&#39;re writers, and we&#39;re fanfiction writers here. A large amount of similarity is inevitable as we try to emulate a style of writing that we enjoy. Seeking variety within those parameters should be our goal.</p>

            <p>...hardly important or vital.<br><br>The PPC existed and gave permission without them for far longer than we&#39;ve been using a prompt system.<br><br>Once upon a time it was a simple rep check &quot;you seem cool, sure&quot;. Then it became &quot;hey your fic you linked is alright, you have permission&quot;, then &quot;your fic and agent ideas look good, you have permission&quot; to &quot;your short story set in the PPC looks good and your agent bios look sharp and you have a fic set out for missioning, you have permission&quot; to &quot;you followed the prompt well, your agent bios are long and we can see everything about them and you picked a suitably bad story&quot;. <br><br>The prompt system is a crutch and does not us a good idea of a person&#39;s ability to write. <br><br><br>Your own personal failures to understand PPC canon isn&#39;t something that intersects perfect with what you&#39;re trying to argue. If you wrote a different prompt, we would have found out you didn&#39;t know basic PPC canon some way or another, and you probably would have been more embarrassed had it happened when you revealed it post-permission. Getting basic facts right is not part of proving you know how to string sentences together into a cohesive role, getting them right means showing you are willing to do the research and double-check things instead of going with simple assumptions. <br><br>Also, while I don&#39;t entirely agree with Bram on the fact of creating agents to be primarily mission-focused, not all characters are suited to actually be interesting or even good <i>as</i> PPC agents. People who have agents who are SI-types of themselves have tweaked them a bit, for the most part, to be able to work on missions.

I&#39;m not saying people need to know every random tidbit of PPC knowledge, but if you are going to base your argument on stating that something must be done this way because it is important and we have done it thusly, you at least need to know how long it&#39;s been the case instead of presenting it as an &#39;always&#39; sort of situation.<br><br>-July, who is apparently bad at hiatuses</p>

            <p>Designing agents specifically to be good at missions is a mark of bad writing. It shows they&#39;re flat, two-dimensional characters with no depth other than &quot;good at assassinations/exorcisms/detangling/what-have-you&quot;. That&#39;s another reason why the prompts are there: to show who the agents are when not on missions. To show who they are when dragged outside their—and your—comfort zone.</p>

            <p>Most of these prompts are written so you can explore what your agents are like when they&#39;re not on missions - the prompts are interlude-style. Trust me, I thought that interludes would be boring, and then one day I found out that I wanted to write about my agents in a way that wasn&#39;t a mission, and the interlude was there.<br><br>I agree with Ixi - writing them for missions only is not going to develop your characters that much. Knowing how someone acts at home is as important as knowing how they act at work.<br><br>And like Matt said, no one is forcing you to stick with the prompts you got the first time round, as long as you write two prompts as is required. I&#39;ll admit that I changed one of my prompts because it didn&#39;t seem to fit with my characters at their early stage of creation.<br><br>I vote we keep the prompts as they are.</p>

            <p>Like many others, a lot of the details went over my head. Additionally, I found  Captain Juliette&#39;s monologue difficult to process. It made for a rather intimidating start to the story. (I can deal with science fiction only slightly harder than Star &quot;I can safely visit an antimatter universe&quot; Trek (TOS, at least. I&#39;m not sure about the rest since I haven&#39;t watched them <i>yet</i>), although I&#39;m working on it).

            <p>It is, on rereading, a pretty dense thing. Not to worry, though! Captain Juliette might be an overgrown engineer, but you&#39;re welcome to be as soft as you like - Trekverse hardness is completely fitting, I&#39;ve just spent <i>ahem</i>-hundred too many hours in Kerbal Space Program to be happy writing anything without reasonably accurate orbital dynamics.<br><br>It sounds like you caught the important metaphors of the setting! The galaxy at large is a cultural map of humanity, with fandom happily wedged between media-culture and internet-culture, where it currently resides. Most everything else is either a reference or unimportant - the Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator is Marvin the Martian&#39;s favorite earth-destroying explosive, the Sphere Politick is where all the real-world political drama happens, the racks of hardware are hyperlinks, moving data between systems (websites) in the Webways. Everything&#39;s coated in a crunchy hard-sci-fi chocolatey layer, but being true to the underlying metaphors is far more important than hardness.<br><br>As far as names go, it&#39;s not exactly a pun, more of a clever reference, carefully encoded. It may take some figuring, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll see the link. (Or, just toss a self-sealing stem bolt at me hard enough and I&#39;ll explain fully.)</p>

            <p>I am expecting hardness to be variable with each author- I enjoy hard sci-fi, and I care about things like orbital dynamics and the logistics of artificial gravity, but that doesn&#39;t mean you have to! Anything of Trek-level hardness should fit just fine, and clever references are definitely worth more than technical accuracy.</p>

            <p>Being not very technologically minded, hard sci-fi is generally a bit over my head (astronomically, as it were), but I like this.  I at least got the little jokes about Tomash taking over the station from Juliette, and  the interaction between the Webways, Great Fan and Media Corporatocracy.  I could see myself writing in this a little more easily than in Plort (also over my head), although I would probably have trouble coming up with names and such.<br><br>Also, the AU-self character I was imagining as I read would have been a robotic data-retrieval system (in line with my and my Plort self&#39;s archival work), but that of course goes against the &quot;uncommon AI&quot; rule in your author&#39;s note.  Perhaps L.I.T. could be a rather . . . unintelligent intelligence?  Too closely bound by its programming to have much in the way of true choice?  After all, it&#39;s an AU of me.  *badum-tsss*<br><br>—doctorlit knows better than to stray from his programming; he likes being an efficient worker!</p>

            <p>&quot;Capacity&quot;
<br><br>In an alleyway behind Tomash &amp; Co. floated a round, metallic object.  It was composed of two smooth shells, one above, the other underneath.  Between the two shells, a series of varying wires, ports and other machinery broke the smooth pattern, occasionally sliding to the left or right, while the main shells remained stationary, relatively speaking.<br><br>Affixed to the main shell were a pair of large lenses, shaped like irregular ovals that tapered inwards towards each other, giving the machine a decidedly wall-eyed appearance to any observer with a tendency to anthropomorphize.<br><br>The machine turned to face the back wall of Tomash&#39;s building, a ticking sound audible from the lenses as it focused on and scanned the metal facade.  [Data Storage Banks . . .]  It paused.  It&#39;s ability to read System Management Information had seemed . . . inefficient . . . ever since  the Data Storage Banks had passed the 95% mark.  A machine with better Diagnostics Analysis Programs might have been able to deduce that, despite the reported empty storage capacity remaining, the vast amount of compiled data was taking up space needed for the system&#39;s Processing Power.<br><br>The Temporary Orthographic Retrieval unit, however, was not equipped with Diagnostics Analysis Programs of any value worth speaking of.  [Data Storage Banks . . . at . . . ninety-seven percent capacity.  Continue Data Storage routines.]<br><br>The central panel spun around until a certain subset of tools faced the wall.  Four tiny tubes extended from the T.O.R. and touched the wall.  Their ends lit up and traced a perfect square in the metal, which fell away from the building in a haze of acrid yellow smoke.  Behind the panel, a series of ports was revealed.<br><br>Spinning its middle panel to another section, the T.O.R. snaked several wires out to meet the various holes.  After several seconds of hunting and testing, most of the T.O.R.&#39;s wiring had found a matching home in the back of the electronics panel.  A few more seconds for data copy and transfer (But should it have lasted even that long?), and the T.O.R. broke the various connections it had forged.<br><br>[Data Storage Banks . . .]<br><br>It waited.  It waited a full minute before force-cancelling the operation and starting over.<br><br>[Data Storage Banks . . .]  This time, it was under three quarters of a minute before the number was calculated.  [ . . . at two percent capacity.]  Now the unit had no reason for concern.  It had plenty of storage space in its Data Storage Banks, after all.  In fact, it had barely made any progress at all since setting out on this mission!  It set right to work, scanning the next buildings for potential sources of data to mine—it would certainly need a lot, if it was going to make use of all that empty space in its hard drives.<br><br>—alternate title: &quot;doctorlit Pretends to Know Computer Things&quot;</p>

            <p>Okay, so. How to explain this briefly.<br><br>I&#39;ve been combing the internet for Doctor Who fanfic ideas, and came across one: <a href="http://cubicle7.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DWAITAS_The_Matter_of_Silver.pdf"><a href="http://cubicle7.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DWAITAS_The_Matter_of_Silver.pdf">http://cubicle7.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DWAITAS_The_Matter_of_Silver.pdf</a></a><br><br>Pretty awesome, right? Unfortunatly, even though it is a sourcebook and free to use in regards to roleplay, I doubt the same can be said of writing. And even worse, I am afraid that if I tried making this into a fanfic, that it would still be considered plagiarism even if I credited the BBC, due to the story being so well planned out and all the highlights of the plot given for the GM.<br><br>So what do you guys think? If I made this into a fanfic, would it be considered plagiarism even with the disclaimer?</p>

            <p>Just to let you know, even with the standard &#39;disclaimer&#39; in most fanfics, it doesn&#39;t actually have any legal standing. If the creator of whatever you&#39;re writing a fanfic on wants to sue you, they are not only able to, but fully entitled to (if they choose). So in your case, with or without the disclaimer it could still be taken down for plagiarism (and thus probably isn&#39;t a good idea). </p>

With the advent of the themes presented in Series 2 and 3, it&#39;s not hard to see why; technobabble, well-executed (thick) purple prose, and brutal deconstructions of otherwise Suvian characters (while deleting those that <i>are</i> traditional Sues) are many of the Foundation&#39;s current themes.<br><br>Oh, and speaking of all this, the site&#39;s strict writing policies (and the community as a whole) are actually acknowledged in-universe in the most terrifying way possible.

Then the protagonist enters SCP-860-1, a forest occupied by a mystical creature.  The creature immediately warms up to the protagonist, they go to a house in the woods (a geological aberration), and engage in <i>bestiality.</i> My god.

            <p>But this time, instead of it being focused on the Barons being snippy at each other and squabbling over politics and how to divide up land, it would be focused on... *drumroll* a festival?<br><br>The Festival of Sumralese (summer release) celebrates a time when many teachers from Moh-vie make their new teachings accessible for the people outside their lands ... but consequently, it&#39;s also when the Marizu often rally in Fanvik-Neht to make a mockery of said teachings. The festival is held in the city of Borrd to both celebrate the new information and to bolster the people of Plort&#39;s spirits before the inevitable crusades.<br><br>There will be music and dancing and food and laughter and basically it&#39;ll be one big Renaissance Faire only with our Plortsonas as the participants! RP style would be more in the traditional format we tend to use for RPs featuring our agents.<br><br>So, who&#39;s interested?

            <p>I heard about the PPC a few months ago (in negative terms), and actually decided to check it out today after encountering a particularly obnoxious suefic, and it honestly looks like something interesting. I can definitely relate to how fun it is to make light of something awful, and there is no shortage of awful fanfiction, though it annoying to wade through all of it if I&#39;m trying to find actually good fanfiction.<br><br>I personally am a college girl, studying mathematics, and write both fan and original fiction in my spare time. My screenname came from a nickname I had in high school, which I got because of my green eyes and a particular plot twist from a quickwrite in the writer&#39;s club. I&#39;m also squick resistant, though definitely not immune. I&#39;m currently involved in various game fandoms, and not particularly connected to any of them right now.<br><br>I also have a few questions about what happens in a fic, mostly prompted by that suefic. What happens if time suddenly flows backwards, and not in a flashback sort of manner? What happens if the fic only passes a few hours but the dates given differ by a few months? Does anything special happen with character replacements of canonical sues? I don&#39;t see anything matching the former two in the temporal distortions article, and the last one is just because it seems like the two would interact.</p>

            <p>Good day, leafeyes. <br>Was the plot twist that the main character&#39;s eyes were actually leaves, explaining why she was completely blind and in constant pain?

            <p>In a high fantasy setting, my heroes were having a problem with every one of their plans being anticipated and countered by the villain, despite the fact that they didn&#39;t see any way for him to have known them. However, they then come across a tree, and one of them manages to detect that it is somehow enchanted. They eventually figure out that the villain was responsible, and that she had enchanted the tree so that she could scry the area around it. She would pluck leaves and send them out over the winds, as a leaf blowing through the wind wouldn&#39;t arouse suspicion, but would provide her with intelligence on the heroes plans if it was in their vicinity. Someone asked for clarification, and I simplified it as &quot;The leaves are eyes,&quot; which is when I got the name.</p>

            <p>It does have a ton of flaws, but I also had only an hour to come up with and write the entire thing. I did realize it wouldn&#39;t work in winter while writing it, but just ignored it because I didn&#39;t have enough time to put in a proper explanation. Also, the villain still has her regular, non-leaf eyes, she only used the leaves to see things when she needed to not be seen.</p>

It&#39;d be even <i>more</i> horrible if you had normal eyes, but they fall out of your head every winter, and splat nastily onto your carpet, getting eye-juice all over it and your socks. And <i>then</i> you go blind. <br><br>It&#39;s one of those high-fantasy things, in the end. Could probably just take the &#39;magical leaves&#39; thing further. Nothing like a little sprinkle of sentience to solve your problems! </p>

Other highlights include screwing up dates, both by giving impossible dates in section breaks and by having canon events happen at the wrong times, calling Chie &quot;he&quot; (which is especially bad because this is when she&#39;s super insecure in her femininity), having everyone including the sue use the wrong Japanese honorifics, making Yosuke fall in love with her before he&#39;s really over Saki (and in just 4 days), making everyone at least a bit OOC, and having a non-Japanese name (though at least it sounds vaguely Japanese). She also might be the female protagonist of Persona 3 given her family name, backstory, and her memories of what appear to be SEES members.<br><br>I&#39;ve played Persona 3 FES, Persona 4 (not golden), Persona Q, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon, and Fire Emblem: Awakening.

            <p>It&#39;s not a particularly long fic at the moment, and I might be biased simply because it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen another sue, so it might be best to avoid putting a mission in the queue just yet. But if she does encounter your agents, I&#39;d suggest shooting her during the Dark Hour, which should have come back if she is indeed Kotone, either as a character replacement or simply there by bad writing/resurrection.<br> <br>Also, I&#39;ve already played Persona Q, but have no even attempted emulating older games. It&#39;s generally something I don&#39;t do, I prefer trying to play things on actual hardware, though I can understand the appeal of playing older games through emulation, especially as there&#39;s plenty of games where every legitimate copy has failed.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s see... Your Newbie gift is a Royal Ice Cream Container. Simply ask, and receive the ice cream flavor of your choosing. It&#39;s sort of like Bertie Bott&#39;s Every Flavour Beans, except with infinite refills and flavours of your choosing.<br><br>Hmm... Yup, I&#39;d say the other two have got it right. The first one&#39;s probably just like a normal distortion, but I don&#39;t know what the second one would be. I know of fics that tell a story backwards to a degree, but it&#39;s usually periodic hops back in time, not actual backwards time. You couldn&#39;t pay me to be an Andalite or a Time Lord if that happened, though. A replacement is a replacement, really. Doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;d matter, though some replacements might be more tolerable than the actual characters and leave agents wishing that they could just keep the originals down a plothole.<br><br>Since, given your questions, it looks like you&#39;ve at least read some of the basics, any agent pairs you&#39;re particularly fond of?</p>

            <p>Have one of my own shed feathers and a complimentary kit of Spikes!<br><br>To answer your questions, temporal distortion happens pretty often in missions; we register it as scene transitions, sped-up fast-forward-style action, and other fun stuff. Whatever produces the most comical effect, basically. And as for replacements of Canon Sues, I think they&#39;d be no different from other replacements, seeing as they act so OOC that it doesn&#39;t really matter who they&#39;re replacing.</p>

            <p>The fic actually mentions specific dates, typically as section breaks. The fic starts April 30th, 2012, and has the sue moving in with her canon brother and uncle. The sue wakes up the next morning, March 1st, 2012, and magically makes friends with the canons she isn&#39;t related to. That afternoon, May 1st, 2012, she grabs her chosen guy&#39;s attention. So I&#39;m referring to in universe date not making sense with the action, I&#39;m sorry if that wasn&#39;t clear.</p>

            <p>Admittedly I&#39;m also somewhat involved in competitive, which hasn&#39;t been doing very well for the past two generations, with 5th generation being ruled over by weather teams consisting primarily of one type, as well as a number of disgustingly overpowered additions (Excadrill springs to mind immediately, though there are plenty of others).<br><br>While the 6th generation fixed weather, it added a huge amount of horribly unbalanced mega evolutions. In competitive terms, &quot;Ubers&quot; basically means banned, and prior to 5th generation this was inhabited only by version mascot and event legendaries, Wobuffet, Wynaut, Garchomp, and Salamence. It grew a lot in the 5th generation, and got even bigger in the 6th generation. But Mega Gengar and Mega Salamence were both so overpowered that there was actually a serious discussion about banning them from Ubers, though they did not actually get banned. Mega Rayquaza however, did end up getting banned, with a special battling tier above Ubers (called &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, abbreviated AG) was created for the sole purpose of having a place to ban it to. <br><br>I&#39;m worried that the new generation is going to continue the trend of power creep and that AG is going to get bigger, meaning that everyone trying to play a more normal match is going to have to deal with massive balance problems until things get sorted out, which can take over a year. I switched to mostly playing Little Cup, which has avoided most of the problems mentioned (except for Swirlix). I still would like to be able to play standard without being forced to have 3-5 specific Pokйmon on my team just to stand a chance at winning.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry that this turned out so long, but that is how I feel.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s one of the cool things about this place—getting to rant about your fandoms to other people. :D<br><br>And funny you should mention competitive play; I started the Annual PPC Pokйmon Tournament two years ago, actually. Both times used OU rules, though this past year was a monotype format. I think the reaction to that was kind of &quot;meh&quot;, so we&#39;ll be going back to traditional battles next year.<br><br>Unfortunately, power creep seems to be a feature in such games (though considering I mostly play only <i>Pokйmon</i> and <i>World of Warcraft</i>, I probably can&#39;t comment on how common that is), but that&#39;s why we have self-imposed rules to keep things interesting. (Hello, Nuzlocke!) I&#39;m very much not a serious competitive battler, though, so I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t really hold a discussion about the competitive scene; you&#39;ll probably want to talk to Scapegrace about that.

            <p>Power creep is a problem in most long lived games or game series, and it&#39;s generally a major problem. As for challenge gaming though, I am definitely a fan, though the only thing I&#39;ve done with Pokйmon was a starter only run of Blue (with Bulbasaur). I&#39;ve also been somewhat out of LC for a while, and it looks like my old Priolu team is going to need to be rebuilt as the strategy the team was built on no longer works. But having a place to talk about fandoms is nice.</p>

            <p>It is not impossible that son<em>of</em>heaven176 goes by &quot;sonofheaven176&quot; on Google, but I’m quite sure that &quot;Elieen&quot; is wrong. Don’t feel too bad about this, you are not alone. I once caught &quot;Hieonymus&quot; in a fic I had beta’ed, hopefully before anybody else could see him.

            <p>Since apparently we have several people who&#39;ve read the <i>Dragonriders of Pern</i> books...<br><br>I&#39;m in the middle of rereading Pern: I&#39;ve gotten through most of the Ninth Pass (haven&#39;t finished <i>Dolphins</i> or <i>Skies</i> yet) and have also read <i>Masterharper</i>. And the treatment of Fax really bothered me: <i>Masterharper</i> makes a big deal of the fact that nothing like his low-key war of conquest has ever happened before, in two and a half thousand Turns - and that there are no provisions to deal with it if it does.<br><br>Wait, <i>what</i>?! Despite a lack of any method of preventing it, the Pernese haven&#39;t had a war in over two millennia? How does <i>that</i> happen?<br><br>And then a few things about the Oldtimers, who came forward 400 years from the end of the Eighth Pass to the start of the Ninth, started to click together:<br><br>-They feel it is within their rights to walk into a Crafthold and take anything they want (<i>Dragonquest</i>).<br>-They were shocked by the amount of forest they were expected to protect in the Ninth Pass (<i>Dragonquest</i>).<br>-They expect ground crews with flamethrowers to be out in Threadfall (<i>Renegades</i>), even though we&#39;re told of Benden&#39;s falls that only a handful of Threads get through - and that Benden flies sweeps afterwards to direct the crews.<br>-One of the very first things T&#39;ron says to F&#39;lar is &#39;Since Fort is the oldest Weyr...&#39; (<i>Dragonflight</i>), and their entire interaction is built on power-play between the Weyrs (<i>Dragonquest</i>, <i>The White Dragon</i>).<br><br>And:<br><br>-The common people of Pern are afraid of Search, and of their children being taken to the Weyrs.<br>-When a young rider at Benden suggests using firestone against the rebellious Lords Holder (<i>Dragonflight</i>), the response is <i>not</i> &#39;no dragonrider would ever contemplate that!&#39;.<br><br>Looking at all the evidence together, the picture I get of Pern before the Long Interval is a bleak one.<br><br>(I should say I&#39;m ignoring Todd&#39;s books here. I&#39;m speculating about Anne&#39;s view of pre-Long Interval Pern, not what was eventually written by her son.)<br><br>-The Weyrs ruled Pern under threat of firestoning, in a Pass or out of it. Lords Holder were autonomous under the Weyrs, but any who transgressed were brought swiftly to heel. We know exactly how this works - F&#39;lar (who spends his time reading old records) used the &#39;let them march then kidnap their women&#39; technique himself (<i>Dragonflight</i>). This is why the Lords Holder had never had to deal with a Fax before - the dragons did it for them.<br><br>-The Weyrs were engaged in constant petty power-struggles. Fort claimed authority as oldest Weyr, and cemented it by such techniques as calling meetings at awkward times (<i>Dragonquest</i>), or insisting on the letter of tradition when it best suited them.<br><br>-The Weyrs were harsh masters. They took what they wanted - goods, beasts, young men and women alike. Who could argue with a dragonrider?<br><br>-The dragonriders only fought Thread over the Holds themselves. They protected a handful of fields per hold, and let the rest of the North lie barren. When the Eighth Pass began, they allowed most of the forests that had sprung up over the previous 200 years to be devoured - saves work, right? This jumps out from so many things - their complaints about the forests, the Oldtimers&#39; behaviour in the South (they didn&#39;t bother fighting falls at all, despite &#39;Dragonmen <i>must</i> fly/When Threads are in the sky&#39;) - that it&#39;s hard to deny as simple fact.<br><br>-The dragonriders probably didn&#39;t even fight every Fall even over the Holds. We know they didn&#39;t have timetables - they just &#39;got a feel&#39; for when Thread would come. They didn&#39;t leave riders at the Holds either, which means they only knew Thread was coming when the drums conveyed the message to them. So they weren&#39;t there when it started - hence the need for properly-equipped ground crews to do their job for them!<br><br>This is... a really dark picture. And I really don&#39;t want to believe it. But the evidence seems really strong - and what&#39;s the alternative? That the Pernese are Just So Nice that no-one ever thought &#39;hey, I&#39;d like my neighbour&#39;s land too&#39;? That all T&#39;ron&#39;s complaints about &#39;innovation&#39; were because he super dislikes the new design of plough? That no-one before the Long Interval wanted to grow trees, and that the dragonriders were uncannily good at guessing when Thread would come? That everyone was so grateful even during Intervals that they offered up their livelihood and children every time a dragonrider wandered through?<br><br>I want to believe it, but I really can&#39;t see it. So who can persuade me otherwise?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I... can&#39;t really argue with the Oldtimers being absolutely awful. They were pretty firmly established as exactly as bad as you make them out to be.<br><br>Of Fax, though, I&#39;d point out that (IIRC) his takeover was fairly subtle at first. He wriggled his way into the rightful bloodlines by a combination of smart marriages and smart murders, which he was careful to make sure no one could pin on him. It was only later—about when he was moving on Ruatha, his last acquisition, I think?—that he established himself as a military power, and by then the rest of the powerful Holds had <s>finally listened to Robinton like they should have done in the first place</s> worked out his game and armed themselves against him. Between that and Lessa giving him such a hard time in Ruatha, he didn&#39;t have enough resources to expand further, so he was stopped at seven.<br><br>I think there was generally a lot of complacency and inertia that let him get that far in the first place. Only a few people actually cared about what he was doing, until he was doing it on their own doorstep. The whole &quot;there&#39;s no precedent!&quot; thing was really a mask for &quot;but that sounds like work!&quot;<br><br>But it&#39;s been a while since my last read-though.

            <p>From reading <i>Masterharper</i> - at High Reaches he possibly murdered his incumbent uncle, definitely murdered his cousin the legitimate heir, and drove the next in line up into the abandoned Weyr. He then took Crom by murdering its lord at (I believe) a Gather. He also attempted several invasions during the course of <i>Masterharper</i>, some of which succeeded.<br><br>He certainly married a lot of women, and his claim on Ruatha was &#39;legitimate&#39; through Lady Gemma, but <i>Masterharper</i> makes it clear that he murdered his way across the north-west.<br><br>As to why he stopped... I think you&#39;re right about the resources, with Lessa and all. I kind of disagree about the Lords Holder fending him off, though: I looked at the map and actually plotted his conquests out for the first time.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Fax.png"><br><br>First off: by the First <i>Egg</i> that man was ambitious!<br><br>Secondly: I&#39;ll accept that Groghe at Fort could hold him off - the Hold has that name for a reason. And Fax probably killed Oterel of Tillek&#39;s father, plus fishing with harpoons would be good training for soldiers. But Telgar? Even under Larad rather than his father, I&#39;m pretty sure Fax could take chunks out of the plains if he really wanted to.<br><br>Of course, doing so would leave his back open to Tillek and Fort... but he&#39;d shown himself capable of sneaking around behind them often enough before.<br><br>Two final thoughts:<br><br>-Why does Southern Boll never do <i>anything</i>? I can&#39;t honestly recall it ever being relevant on the world stage.<br><br>-A Pern AU where Lessa dies with her family would be fascinating, if very dark. You&#39;d have Fax still alive and kicking, Kylara as Ramoth&#39;s Weyrwoman... she <i>might</i> make a Ride, but there&#39;s no way she&#39;d successfully bring the Five Weyrs through, which would leave, I don&#39;t even know, Brekke as the sole Weyrwoman of Pern? And F&#39;lar trying desperately to make 300 dragons do the work of 3000...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>What are these petitioners thinking? You cannot retroactively change the rules and repeat the voting until you get the desired result. And they probably don’t want that a future referendum to get back into the EU would require at least 60% based on a turnout of not less than 75%. I hope the whole parliament votes NO.<br><br>I was very much for Britain remaining in the EU, but now I’m for respecting the democratic decision. All over Europe, populist parties (including the German AFD) pretend that everything would be better if their country left the EU, but there is no empiric data to prove them right or wrong. So like it or not, you are our lab rats now, and we will carefully watch what happens. I am sorry for you, but I hope a lot of bad things happen. If everycountry leaves the EU, Germany is left to dominate Europe by economic power and population, and I certainly don’t want that.<br><br>(I never thought much about it, but there may actually be a reason why the Pottermore Sorting Hat put me into Slytherin.)<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>But the law saying that the result doesn’t count when it’s less than 60% one way or the other should have been made before the referendum. In hindsight, it’s impossible to tell how many people didn’t vote because they believed that their vote would not be necessary to get the desired result, but would have voted if they had known which rules would actually be applied, so it looks like cheating.<br><br>On the other hand, the news I just watched seem to imply that the Brexiteers weren’t prepared to win.

            <p>The referendum vote itself has no legal ramification. First there has to be an official meeting of the European Council. Once that happens, it will trigger Article 50 of the 1973 Treaty of Lisbon, which gives both sides two years to negotiate an exit.<br><br>However, because the UK is so intricately entwined with the EU, it could take many years longer than that.

            <p>The Conservatives have been blaming the EU for all Britain&#39;s ills for decades, so the &#39;Cameron supports Remain&#39; thing was a last-minute change as it is. Throw in the fact that he made the referendum itself a campaign promise to get elected PM, and the fact that while his government is officially in support of the EU, his party was officially <i>neutral</i>... yeah, it&#39;s very hard to believe that he put his heart and soul into keeping us in the EU.<br><br>And if he did? Then he failed miserably as a Prime Minister. He let a right-wing nationalist xenophobic party claim 15% of the vote in the general election, and then dictate to the government how it should deal with the EU.

            <p>Saw the movie at long last today and, without spoiling anything just yet, I can say without a doubt I liked it. There were a lot of nods to the comics, there were some emotional moments, (most of) the fights were awesome, and the teaser at the end... holy crap. My really big complaint is that the BBEG, for all he calls himself Apocalypse, just didn&#39;t come off nearly as threatening as his Horsemen. He hammed it up a bit, killed some humans, and did some other stuff, but for the most part... can you say Large Ham alert?<br><br><b>SPOILERS BELOW</b><br><br>~<del><br><br></del>~<br><br>~<del><br><br></del>~<br><br>~~~<br><br>Yeah, so, the final battle felt less than coherent and more a big jumble of &quot;Look at all the carnage and destruction we can cause! Eat it, Michael Bay!&quot; Psylocke was less than intimidating as an opponent, Storm just kind of hung out on the sidelines and watched until it was time to deliver the killing blow to Apocalypse, Angel was taken out like a chump, and Magneto was once again won over by the power of friendship. It was somewhat implied that Apocalypse was mind-controlling his Horsemen into working for him, but at other points it was insinuated that they were helping him destroy the world just for shiggles. Which... considering the ending with all of them turning on him, just comes across as kind of crappy writing. After <i>First Class</i> and <i>Days of Futures Past</i> I expected better. :/ And for all the powers the dude claims to have, his main ones seem to be teleporting and... sand manipulation. Come on! He could transform his limbs into weapons! He could change his size! He could do all sorts of cool stuff that we only saw him utilize once! He&#39;s a freaking technopath and we saw him use that ability all of one time to play catch-up on world history. What? <br><br>Sure, Apocalypse&#39;s plan to transfer his mind into Xavier&#39;s so he could control everybody on the planet is scary on paper, but in practice, you know it&#39;s not gonna happen. Professor X simply won&#39;t stay dead (Hi, X3, remember how you got retconned?) because he&#39;s too important to the movie franchise. The comics&#39; format of killing everyone off every few years just doesn&#39;t work when translated to the big screen, so the tension just... wasn&#39;t there. <br><br>Killing off Havoc, on the other hand, unfortunately just didn&#39;t have the emotional punch I felt it should have. We got to know his character in <i>First Class</i>, but his sudden death here just lacked the oomph it deserved. I loved Havoc, but I didn&#39;t really feel sad when he died, more annoyed. &quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; was pretty much my entire reaction. Boo.<br><br>Funnily enough, the death that impacted me the most in the film? Magneto&#39;s daughter. I actually teared up a little there, and I barely even knew the character. Fassbender&#39;s acting was absolutely perfect in this scene.<br><br>Quicksilver, by the way, was awesome. They did an overly-long reuse of his slow-time running joke from the <i>Futures Past</i> but the guy later went on to punch the crap out of Apocalypse, which was pretty awesome. Gold star.<br><br>I&#39;m disappointed we didn&#39;t get to see more than a brief manifestation of Jean&#39;s Phoenix Force powers, but eh. That can always be saved for a sequel (and hopefully a better one than X3).<br><br>And yet, even with all these complaints, I enjoyed it, I truly did. Despite the limited time for character development (a lot of time was dedicated to fight scenes and Quicksilver doing his thing), I think the movie did a good job developing in broad strokes a sense for each of the future X-Men&#39;s characters (though Jean could have used a bit more love, IMO). Hopefully we&#39;ll get a more nuanced, in-depth look at them in the next movie, though. They could use some love.<br><br>The nods to the comics were, of course, always lovely. I especially liked how Magneto&#39;s power got ramped up so he could control the polarity of the entire Earth—it was easy to see why that power of his got retconned. Seeing all the debris swirling around him was a truly stunning bit of cinematography. And Jubilee was in the movie! Sure, she was basically a side character, but seeing one of the main characters from that old animated cartoon I grew up with come to life on the big screen was a real treat. I seriously hope we get to see more of her in the future, because she deserves it.<br><br><br>OKAY, BUT FORGET ABOUT ALL THAT, CAN WE NOW TALK ABOUT THE TEASER ENDING?!?<br><br>For those of you not familiar with <i>X-Men</i> lore, the name on the briefcase? Essex? That has to be a reference to Nathaniel Essex, a.k.a. Mister Sinister, also known as one of the X-Men&#39;s scariest nemeses as well as the guy responsible for X-23&#39;s (Wolverine&#39;s female clone) and Cable&#39;s creation. In the comics the guy got his mutant powers from Apocalypse, but I don&#39;t think that will be the case here for obvious reasons. Either way, it&#39;s gonna be interesting to see Sinister finally make an appearance. I think that teaser ending has me more hyped than the actual movie. :D<br><br>And now it&#39;s time to petition for a fully-fledged <i>Deadpool</i>/<i>X-Men</i> crossover! Do it, Fox, do it!<br><br>Final verdict: Not the best <i>X-Men</i> movie out there, but definitely not the worst by a long shot. I would not object to seeing it again in theaters and I can&#39;t wait for it to come out on DVD.<br><br>/end rant</p>

            <p>I really enjoyed the movie, too. It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve really been on the edge of my seat in a while, and it made me want to rewatch all the movies again. (Alas, I have no time.)<br><br>Re. Apocalypse, though, I think you&#39;ve forgotten something.<br><br>SPOILERS ENSUE<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>Y&#39;know, the part where he launched ALL THE WORLD&#39;S NUKES? That scene honestly terrified me. Were they going up? Were they coming back down? I didn&#39;t know! I really thought they might go there. And the scene was perfectly scored with that Beethoven piece... I forget which one, but good god, did it have just the right air of majesty and awe. BEAUTIFULLY done, all of it.<br><br>But Apocalypse doesn&#39;t want to <i>destroy</i> the earth, that&#39;s too easy; he just wants to scour it clean of everything he deems unworthy. Which probably ends up being all people in the end, once he&#39;s taken what he wants from them. And yet his persuasive powers are such that people go along with him—vulnerable people who don&#39;t have much to lose, every one, you&#39;ll note. He knows exactly how to prey on the weakness of others. Eek.<br><br>I do object to the film&#39;s handling of Magneto, though. Nobody called him on straight-up murdering all those policemen, not even a little. Like, I could understand if he&#39;d just killed the one guy who loosed that arrow like a moron, but all of them? Nuh-uh. And that&#39;s not to mention all the death and destruction that must have resulted from screwing with the planet&#39;s magnetic field. Charles, I know you&#39;re in love, but come on. That&#39;s not cool, and you shouldn&#39;t stand for it. {= &lt;br&gt;<br>(I might ship them just a little bit. Look at Charles&#39; moony doe-eyes when he&#39;s talking to Erik and tell me he doesn&#39;t want to jump his bones. Alas, pretty sure Erik does not feel the same way about him.)<br><br>~Neshomeh, quite hyped for the next one, too.</p>

Honestly, considering how he&#39;s been handled in the past, I think it was fitting for his character to kill the policemen (though going to the factory to kill everyone there rather than the one who squealed) was excessive.

            <p>Apocalypse has honestly always been a large ham. His powers are basically shapeshifting, regeneration, and telekinesis. He&#39;s really strong, but honestly, for all his talk, there&#39;s at least ten other mutants I can think of that are more powerful. Hell, Ice Man is more powerful. His real talents lie in his ability to strategize, manipulate, and to convince people to work for him. Which is why he would seem less threatening than his Horsemen, because he is.</p>

            <p>The problem with making him into a ham here is that they were pretty obviously trying to go for dark and gritty and serious, and were trying to make Apocalypse into a serious villain. So when he started hamming it up, it just... didn&#39;t really work.</p>

            <p>You may not know it, but we do have a Discord channel. <br><br>Now, what is Discord you ask, and why should I care about it? Well, in very simple words, Discord is a free-to-use instant messaging client designed for... mostly gaming communities, but who says we couldn&#39;t use one? It&#39;s basically a superior in every way love-child of Skype and Teamspeak, and a worthy (in my opinion) successor of the IRC.<br><br>Discord offers both text chat and voice channels, can be used both in and outside gaming, and every discord channel can be divided into various sub-channels used for specific purposes. So far, in the PPC Discord, we have such sub-channels as:<br>- Generic Channel - for everyday talk<br>- The Lounge - for RPs<br>- Generic Server - for the PPC Minecraft server users<br>- Rec &#39;n&#39; Plugs - self-explanatory <br>If people have any suggestions as to what else can be added, just let me know! :D<br><br>Discord can also be used on other platforms, such are your phones or tables, and can be linked to YouTube channels, or Twitter accounts. It also holds logs from the past.<br><br>So I strongly encourage y&#39;all to join me on our lovely Discord channel. Catch the invitation: <a href="https://discord.gg/0zL6OvKrsM4gca0Z"><a href="https://discord.gg/0zL6OvKrsM4gca0Z">https://discord.gg/0zL6OvKrsM4gca0Z</a></a> and let&#39;s revive the real-time chats! :D<br><br>But remember, like everything PPC-related, the Discord channel also respects the Constitution!<br><br>This ends the announcement. Happy Talkin&#39;!</p>

            <p>Has it got a town? A region? A baby nation? An independence movement? Time will tell. Remember we do still actually have both the IRC and the LJ community - not to mention I believe there&#39;s a Steam group, a FF.net C2 or whatever they&#39;re called, and at least one Facebook group. None of those are nations, because they&#39;re tiny and unused.<br><br>If the Discord channel becomes popular and persistent, it&#39;ll be a nation.<br><br>Or if someone writes a declaration of independence for it. I&#39;m not actually the controller of Plort, despite what some people seem to think.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a really good place to put a genuinely homophobic agent. One who is jaded and disgusted by the whole thing, one who can&#39;t help but view it as unnatural, damaging, disgusting, and just plain wrong: Bad Slash. Where poorly written gayness is such an integral part of the job description that it slowly warped the agent&#39;s mind.<br><br>That, I think, would be an interesting direction for a spinoff to take. Your homophobic ex-Slasher gets reassigned after a godawful mission somewhere, and their new partner is in the LGBTQQIA+ spectrum in some way or another. They have to deal with each other&#39;s thought patterns and internal biases and try to be better people. It&#39;s just an idea, but not one totally without merit. =]</p>

            <p>Well, that&#39;s not <i>exactly</i> what I&#39;ve been trying to do, but it&#39;s weirdly close (the agent is homophobic not because she worked in Bad Slash previously, but because her home continuum was a variant of medieval Scotland, but they&#39;re both in Bad Slash now).

            <p>I stand by my gut reaction: it&#39;s not realistic to expect each and every PPC staffer to be tolerant of gay people, so there shouldn&#39;t be a problem with Natalie being homophobic. Further, and frankly: &quot;it&#39;s an interesting trait&quot; is a legit reason when it comes to experimentation with characters — I made the Librarian racist just because, and if that&#39;s nothing to complain about, then neither is Natalie&#39;s homophobia. To address the marginalisation point, I&#39;d like to say that homophobia can be a marginal trait of a character, just like every other trait. Not all people will make it or have it made central to their character and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s realistic to expect that to be the case here.<br><br>Aside from this whole thing:<br>-There&#39;s a weird grey thing in the background that makes the mission a bit hard to read.<br>-The execution scene is well-written, in my opinion.<br>-I like the shout out title.</p>

And that the author wouldn’t put that in there unless he had a point to make. See, I grew up in a sheltered home before coming here, but I realized that orientation does not automatically mean bad things. You can still like the person. Sure, talking about orientation for an extended period of time is gonna make me uncomfortable, but I hope I can deal with it in a better way. And... “ She sniffed, as if trying not to cry. “I’m sorry to everyone who I gave the wrong impression to. That was my stupidity. But I’m going to do better.”<br><br><br>Za’kiir walked over to her and wrapped his arms around her in a hug. “I’m sure they’ll understand.

            <p>The PPC, both in and out of universe, has a higher-than-average number of people who are LGTBQ.

            <p>I had lost my original notes on Naomi and Agent Drake. And Drake is.... mostly sorry about the Gender bending Crisis. Only took Naomi 3 years to get him to realize that..... <br><br>I&#39;ve got alot of catching up, but I should be able to get them back up, eventually. Free days tomorrow yay.<br><br>I don&#39;t suppose any of the people who were around when Naomi and Drake be willing to help the two agents back into the PPC? The question is how to reintroduce them without going Cliche....</p>

            <p>Of course, my first thought would be to revel in clichй and use that revelry to comment on what makes it clichй in the first place, so I don&#39;t know how much use I&#39;d be. =]</p>
