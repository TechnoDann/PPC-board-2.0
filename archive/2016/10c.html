            <p>I just got Civ VI, and so far, I&#39;m OK with it. The district system takes not too long to get used to, but those early Let&#39;s Plays I&#39;ve seen somehow managed to avoid the scourge of any developing civ: Barbarians! (Also, it&#39;s clear that I need a better computer. The game runs ok on my system, but I&#39;m stuck with either static leaders or animated leaders with graphics looking more at home in Windows 98. :( )<br><br>But enough about the game. Let&#39;s talk music. More specifically, lyrics. The Civ VI main song is &quot;Sogno di Volare&quot; (Dream of Flying). The lyrics are in Italian and can be found here: <a href="https://youtu.be/WQYN2P3E06s"><a href="https://youtu.be/WQYN2P3E06s">https://youtu.be/WQYN2P3E06s</a></a><br><br>Sergio, since you speak Italian: are the lyrics good Italian? The music itself is beautiful, but knowing game composers, they can sometimes flub up the grammar when working with languages other than English.</p>

            <p>This idea was floating around my mind for a while now, and I thought: what better time to ask than on the heels of a different language question?<br><br>It&#39;s clear by now <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=292537">that we are quite geographically diverse</a>. So, there should be some linguistic diversity to go along with it! The question is: how diverse are we?<br><br><strong>If English is <em>not</em> your first language:</strong><br><ul>
<br><li>What is your first language?</li>
<br><li>When did you decide to learn English? (Was it even a choice, or a required subject in school?) How did you learn English (e.g., by immersion, in school, self study)?</li>
<br>
</ul>
<br><br><strong>Regardless of if English is your first language:</strong><br><ul>
<br><li>What languages do you know besides English (and your first language, if it isn&#39;t English)?<br> (Yes, dead languages count. And no, Fangirl Japanese does not count.

            <p>English is my first language. I am conversant but not fluent in Spanish, which was required at my elementary and middle schools, and I chose it over French in high school, because when I do a thing, I like to get really good at it, and the idea of only half being able to speak Spanish was viscerally horrifying to me. Also, there&#39;s so much great Spanish literature that I can barely read even after six years of serious study (I&#39;m not counting kindergarten through sixth grade as serious; I was such a small child). I&#39;ve mostly learned through classes, and a couple of trips to Spanish-speaking countries, and have only recently realized that, hey, it would really help if I read and watched and listened to Spanish in my free time. (By the way, I have found so much Spanish badfic that I may have to eventually write an agent who speaks the language.)<br><br>--Key returns to her homework </p>

            <p>English is my first language, and that was picked up with relative ease. After that, I began developing an interest in alphabets and other languages, specifically dead ones. <br><br>Being obsessed with ancient Egyptian culture, I began looking into Middle Kingdom heiroglyphics, and became relatively capable of reading it. I still have a copy of the book I used. &quot;Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs: A Practical Guide-&quot; I used it all through middle school, and it&#39;s quite good. I could write to some extent, but it was easier to work in the non-symbolic transliterated form. To this day, I can sound out Tutankhamun&#39;s cartouche, despite his having been a useless bugger of a pharaoh whose name deserves to vanish.<br><br>I took four years of Spanish, and after a few minutes of conversation I can usually follow what&#39;s going on, and participate to a horribly stunted degree. Never got much practice using it in conversation. <br><br>I learned a little Hebrew syntax in the church I did setup for when I was younger. I can recognize basic words like Jerusalem starting with the yud on the far end, along with the more iconic characters like shin and lamed. From there, I have context, and I am VERY good with context. <br><br>I also took a year of Mandarin in high school, but my teacher developed cancer, and I was unable to complete the course. <br><br>I also have a strange ability to work out most German, and most romance languages I can pick up quite easily, thanks to my spanish and ability to recognize roots. <br><br>So I suppose you could sum my ability as a linguist up most succinctly with the phrase &quot;Jack of all trades, master of none.&quot; If I get any ground whatsoever, I can usually read pretty much anything. <br><br>Maybe not the most relevant post, but I think it&#39;s interesting what you can figure out with a little basic knowledge.</p>

            <p>I was born and raised in New York, so obviously, English is my first language. <br><br>Besides English, I know five other languages (to varying degrees of proficiency): Haitian Creole, French, Spanish, Latin, and Greek.<br><br>Being Haitian, I&#39;m surrounded by Haitian Creole: my parents speak it at home and I go to a Creole-speaking church. (Oddly enough, as a child, I had no desire at all to learn Creole. My thought process was something like this: I&#39;m American, and Americans speak English, so why do I need to learn some mumbo-jumbo language that nobody speaks?) I really got interested in learning Creole in my teenage years, and of course, taking French has only helped my Creole. Add to that the fact that my grandmother moved here from Haiti when I was in high school, and Creole is now my number-two language.<br><br>I started taking French in junior high school, as my only foreign-language options were French and Spanish. I took two years in junior high school, two years in high school, and a few courses during my junior and senior years in college to brush up on my skills.<br><br>I took two years of Spanish in college because I thought that it would be useful for me to be able to speak Spanish. I currently can read Spanish and speak enough to carry a very basic conversation; I need more practice.<br><br>Latin and Greek I took in college. I took them for the same reason: I was interested in Biblical languages. At first, I did not know that my college offered Greek classes, so I took Latin. When I saw that Greek classes were available, I started taking Greek as well. Nowadays, I can pick my way through a text in either language Greek Bible--as long as I have a dictionary by my side to help me with unfamiliar words or word forms.</p>

            <p>I live in (and was born in) the US, and I&#39;m actually a bit hazy on whether my first language is English or Polish. My parents mainly speak Polish at home, so obviously I picked it up. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;d describe myself as &#39;fluent&#39; in Polish, but I can certainly hold a conversation without sounding too silly. The occasional trips back to Poland to visit family certainly help with that.<br><br>I also learned some Latin in high school (because I didn&#39;t feel like taking any of the foreign languages that required actual speaking), but I forgot most of it, I think.</p>

            <p>My native language is English, but I&#39;m most comfortable in American Sign Language because my hearing is rather poor. My hearing started to decline after high school, and, while I can typically understand English if it&#39;s quiet, even if I might mishear a few words, if there&#39;s any noise above my hearing threshold I can&#39;t understand at all. I also know some Spanish, but it&#39;s limited to writing because I can&#39;t understand spoken Spanish well enough even in silence.</p>

<li>My first language is Polish<br><br>- I&#39;ve started learning English in pre-school, when I was six. I hadn&#39;t had much of a choice, and it followed me ever since. Every school I went to had mandatory English. At first I started learning from <i>Disney&#39;s Magic English</i> tapes, but slowly I started going on English websites, then watching films (at first with subtitles), and finally to English novels.<br><br>- If I am to count all languages I know how to express my thoughts it would be Polish, English and German. Even though Fangirl Japanese doesn&#39;t count, I do know enough Japanese to talk to natives (happened quite a few times when working at McDonald&#39;s), and bits and pieces of Russian and Italian.<br><br>- English and German because it was mandatory. Italian because I have family in Italy. Russian because it&#39;s very similar to Polish. Japanese... well, I am a fan of the culture as a whole, not just anime and manga.<br><br>- Eh, can&#39;t remember, really. I just tend to pick them up now and then.

<li>My first languages are Corsican and French, though I sadly lost most of my fluency in Corsican.

            <p>As mentioned by this very thread itself, as an Italian my native language is... well, Italian.<br><br>I learned English at middle and high school at first, and I made an effort to learn it well because many things are more easily available in English than in Italian - bonus points for me being an avid gamer and most games coming only in English, German, French and maybe Spanish at the time. Only the big ones had an Italian translation.<br><br>Then, in my last year of high school, I found the PPC and it helped me improve further (to the point an English coworker of mine was <i>freaked out</i> once. He says mine is the best English he has seen here in Italy... and we work in aeronautics where English is the first language wherever you are.). So... Thank you all guys and gals?<br><br>I have learned a bit of French and Latin in school too - the former in elementary and middle school, the latter at high school - but I&#39;ve never been that good in either, and having the chance to drop both was actually a relief.</p>

            <p>Well my first language is French. <br><br>And, while there was some mandatory English back at primary school, I didn&#39;t really begin it before the 8th grade, as a mandatory second foreign language.

<li>Latin and Japanese, though not really to the level of basic fluency you mentioned anymore.  That&#39;s more because of lack of practice than anything else.  I can still recognize a handful of kanji and maybe have a very basic conversation, but not easily.  Latin is probably one of those things that I&#39;d remember more of if I actually tried to translate something, but I can&#39;t really remember much off the top of my head.<br><br>2. Harry Potter and anime, basically. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>3. Latin I started back in what would be the equivalent of third or fourth grade; I was homeschooling, and my mom thought I should learn a language.  My choices were Latin, Spanish, or German; I picked Latin because, well, Harry Potter.  I continued studying it until I graduated from high school.<br><br>Japanese I tried to do a bit on my own via Rosetta Stone, but the combination of foreign language and kanji was more than I could retain with just that.  I ended up taking it once I reached college, and even spent a summer in Japan; however, I eventually stopped taking the classes because, well, they weren&#39;t required any more, and if I wanted to maintain my GPA, I had to take easier electives.<br><br>As far as how, mostly via textbooks and stuff.  I&#39;ve found flashcards to be a great memory aid, if that&#39;s the sort of thing you mean.</li>

            <p>I took Spanish courses all through high school.  Living in Arizona (a state with a heavy Mexican population), it seemed like a good idea to become fluent at the time.  Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t kept up on it, and I would be too embarrassed to even try speaking with a Spanish-fluent person anymore.  I can generally read Spanish with minimal trouble, but actively spoken Spanish tends to go too fast for me to parse out.<br><br>Latin, another option for the language credit at my high school, may have been the better option, at least for college.  Some of the biology courses I took required learning the scientific names of specific animals, and since most Latin names are basically descriptions of their body parts, it would have been nice to know that Latin.<br><br>—doctorlit va a comer el tenedor que él encontré en un salmon si la fantasma de la col muerte venga.</p>

            <p>However, I decided to not correct it as SPaG errors were somewhat frequent in the original - even if that chapter featured none.<br><br>While not faithful to the original chapter, i believed leaving the error in was more faithful to the fic as a whole - that particular part was actually of somewhat higher quality compared to the rest.

            <p>Silly of me, I know, but it&#39;s just gotten slow at work, and I needed something to help pass the time.<br><br>I&#39;m happy to say it was quite easy to follow, despite having no idea what else has happened so far. It probably helps that it is (I think) a sort of interlude in the story, with the agents taking some time out of the action to rest and figure some things out. There were some nice character moments for everyone, especially Sergio and Nikki. Actually, the whole thing almost felt like an excerpt from an original story more than a mission. I could visualize everything and sense the bittersweet mood very well. It was a very nice read, and I will have to remember to go back and read the first five chapters sometime. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I thought it was overall FANTASTIC!  Everyone was in character, the episode was well written, and that one part when Discord goes &quot;where is Fluttershy&quot; was adorable (who can tell I ship Fluttercord).<br><br>The one complaint I do have is the final design for the Changelings.  I wish they had looked slightly less bejeweled, and I frankly liked their previous design better.  But, that being said, you also have to keep in mind while watching this show that it&#39;s target audience is young children.  Plus, Hasbro has practically been screaming &quot;BUY OUR TOYS&quot; since this show started, and I feel like, sadly, that has a lot of influence over character design.</p>

            <p>Generally speaking, there&#39;s not really a &quot;canon&quot; out there of those kinds of stories; they tend to vary dramatically depending on the telling, after all.  And in general, I usually see PPC continua being narratives that have consistent recorded forms.  Fairy tales are a good example; there are many different published versions of a single tale that have contradictory details (Perrault vs Brothers Grimm, for example), so you can&#39;t really enforce canon for them as a whole, though maybe you could for a specific version.  Plus, most conspiracy theories are supposedly true events in World One, so it kind of falls into the category of RPF if you think about it.<br><br>That said, there are certainly plenty of continua that are <i>influenced</i> by conspiracy theories, X-Files being one of the most well-known. And as VixenMage mentioned, the PPC itself is probably rife with its own conspiracy theories, as well as potentially being a source of them in World One.  That&#39;d be an interesting background for a World One agent, actually; maybe they found the PPC while trying to figure out where exactly all those young people who get mysterious jobs and then disappear have gone.</p>

            <p>So, for it to be a continuum, it needs to have a proper, consistent canon? <br>That, there, is intriguing. Hadn&#39;t thought of that. <br><br>I still reckon they ought to have <i>some</i> presence, though, right? Especially considering how closely related they are to actual continua. <br>P&#39;raps they&#39;re ridiculously ridden with plotholes, being all inconsistent-like. Constantly warping all over the place, and practically unreachable. <br><br>Dunno what RPF is, or what the Rwandan Patriotic Front has to do with any of this, however. </p>

            <p>RPF = Real Person Fic, usually involving popular actors or musicians.  It&#39;s a fairly controversial subject, as many people (myself included) feel that it&#39;s an invasion of privacy at best, and profoundly creepy at worst.  It is outside the purview of the PPC.<br><br>The requirement of consistency is just personal interpretation, largely based on the way that you see movieverse vs. bookverse canon in some fandoms, and occasionally charges for being inconsistent as to which one is being referenced.  I imagine that, depending on the fandom, it can get massively more complicated; just think of comic books, for example.  But even still, there&#39;s an expectation that there&#39;s a specific version being referenced, instead of a conglomeration of multiple versions.  It seems like it&#39;d be hard to enforce stability in something that doesn&#39;t have stability in the first place.<br><br>What kind of presence are you thinking of, and what kind of close relations?  I admit that part of my confusion stems from the fact that I&#39;m really only familiar with urban legends and conspiracy theories as they relate to fictional canons.  And different canons tend to put extremely different spins on the same story.  Look at the different versions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Mary_folklore_in_popular_culture">Bloody Mary</a> in different series, for example.  They&#39;re all based on the same source story, but they vary pretty sharply.</p>

            <p>Yeah, that&#39;s bloody weird. I get pangs of guilt from using nonexistent characters, let alone real people. <br>We&#39;ve had missions of those before, though, haven&#39;t we? What changed? <br><br>My main thoughts on their presence is mainly how similar they are to proper canon worlds, main difference being consistency.

            <p>I mean, on a low-level scale I just assume the PPC is full of them. All Cafeteria food is made from the bodies of Sues, in some way or other. The Flowers are aliens. The Flowers are Old Ones. The Flowers have a secret plot to drive all PPC agents insane. <s>There&#39;s a department whose job it is to kill agents when they get too close to being Sues.</s> The Escher Room provides a secret portal room to outside the multiverse. Makes-Things is immortal. Makes-Things is secretly a Flower. <br><br>I mean, there has to be, right? So much of the reality in HQ is constantly in flux anyway, you&#39;d think these things would thrive. I think they&#39;d be part of the canon in that they&#39;re absolutely something Agents would believe, but conspiracy theories are by definition usually counter to canon itself. Does that make sense?<br><br>(And yes, I do think the ones in Real Life are pretty bad.)</p>

            <p>&quot;I mean, there are multiple ways to have died, but not be dead. I could be a vampire, or a lich, or any kind of undead, really, who have died, but blur the boundaries between life and death to the point where you have to wonder if they really count as dead. I could have died, but come back to life, meaning I&#39;ve been resurrected, which would be weird, but possible, but I don&#39;t know why I&#39;d get it. I could be dead and in some kind of afterlife where you don&#39;t count as dead once you&#39;re there, or the world could be some kind of Russian nesting doll, except with worlds and lives, so you die, then move on to a world and life. Or, who knows, maybe I was dreaming and I died in the dream, so now I&#39;m in the real world. Is it one of those, or something else?&quot; I ask, looking at the girl quizzically.</p>

            <p>The girl frowns. &quot;Oh dear. That&#39;s not supposed to happen.&quot; She closes her eyes for a moment, like she&#39;s thinking, then nods to herself. &quot;Ah, you&#39;re still a bit befuddled from crossing over. Understandable. In the meantime, though, let me share my name.&quot; She pauses. &quot;Well, names, plural, I’ve had quite a lot of them. Kivaren, Sk’rrshish—wait, sorry, you wouldn’t have heard of those. What about Cù-Sìth? Thanatos?” She makes a face. &quot;Well, there&#39;s one I <i>know</i> you know, but it sounds sooo dramatic... eh, whatever. I&#39;m Death.&quot; She waggles her fingers. &quot;Hello.&quot;<br></p>

            <p>Death laces her fingers behind her head. &quot;See, I&#39;ve found it makes crossing over much easier for people if they&#39;re guided by a friendly face.&quot; As she speaks, she morphs into a smaller lizard child, and you get a look at what your new body&#39;s face might look like. A single pair of eyes, with a ridge of dark green scales in place of eyebrows, a flat nose, and a thin-lipped mouth. Death smiles and reveals a row of small, sharp teeth. &quot;Of course, everyone&#39;s definition of &quot;friendly&quot; changes depending on what species they remember being last. So—&quot; She morphs back to the human girl. &quot;Here we are. Any other questions?&quot;</p>

I mean, it can&#39;t hurt to know Death a little better, especially since I&#39;ll apparently see you again, eventually, assuming I&#39;m not dreaming. Haven&#39;t abandoned that train of thought. Oh, and now that I think about it, why am I here? That should cover it for now. And why am I not feeling shock, awe, despair, sorrow, rage, and an urge to scream. That&#39;s also important.

            <p>Death smooths out her skirt and tucks a strand of curly blonde hair behind her ear. &quot;You&#39;ve got a lot of stuff to ask, and some of it I&#39;m not allowed to disclose. Fate... now that&#39;s a tricky one. See, technically, I&#39;m omniscient, so I already know what you&#39;re going to do before you do. I can see what would happen if you were to make different decisions, but it&#39;s kind of a moot point, isn&#39;t it? Heaven and Hell don&#39;t really exist; you just keep moving on, one world to the next, in a never-ending cycle, reborn as a new person every time. Or, at least... that&#39;s how it goes for most people. You&#39;re a Breaker. As for your abilities, I&#39;ve let a friend of mine know you were on your way. He should be here in a few posts, assuming people keep things moving along.&quot; She gives a knowing nod.</p>

            <p>Hezrak smooths the front of his robe, looking rather annoyed at having it called a picnic blanket. &quot;It&#39;s... not always easy, with so few of us, and spread through the cosmos at that. It took nearly six cycles before we devised a way to communicate across the barriers that divide realities. It is... how to describe it? Imagine a large bubble, with thirteen smaller bubbles within it. Each smaller bubble is its own reality, not just its own planet. Breaching the gap wasn&#39;t quite as simple as broadcasting across empty space. Thankfully, the Nesari are quite advanced in the field of magic, and combining that with the technologies of other worlds, we were able to build bridges at last.<br><br>&quot;So we are able to communicate with each other and share what knowledge we have obtained. We keep most of it here, in this reality—it is the most advanced, so far, though we are working on changing that as time passes. Tell me, have humans at least achieved intergalactic space flight yet? When I was last on Earth, they were still banging rocks together to make fire.&quot;</p>

            <p>Death&#39;s voice has no compassion in it; her tone is as casual as one&#39;s would be when discussing the weather. &quot;Sorry, that&#39;s just how it goes. If you&#39;d been just a minute earlier or a minute later, you&#39;d have lived to see your grandkids grow up and get married, and Claeryn would be the one explaining things to you. But we don&#39;t have time for &#39;what-ifs&#39;; you&#39;ve got a whole new life to explore!

If you can&#39;t sleep—and I wouldn&#39;t blame you one bit if you can&#39;t—you may borrow a few books I have on hand about magic. If humans haven&#39;t yet achieved long-distance space travel, then magic would certainly be beyond them. I can understand why you would be excited.&quot;</p>

I mean, there&#39;s probably a reason we&#39;ve got people who Break the cycle, but why? What are we supposed to do?&quot; I look around for a minute. &quot;And... okay, I really should be freaking out now. The sky is purple, the trees are way too tall, I&#39;m dead, and...

            <p>I liked the fact this mission staged more scenes between Ix and Lottie, and I&#39;ll admit that I find refreshing to see an ending where death of a glitterbag isn&#39;t involved, or rather a scene where there is hope that there won&#39;t be a glitterbag at the end. <br><br>And...

            <p>Like Ix said, <i>They certainly got the part about what else starstuff does to you—the floating, the happiness, the sounds, potential immortality and permanent flight—right.</i><br><br>In <i>Peter and the Starcatchers</i>, Peter gained the ability to fly and never age because he handled a trunk full of leaking starstuff. The overexposure (allegedly) made him the way he is in <i>Peter Pan</i> (though PatSc is more like an AU prequel of the book than anything).<br><br>Aside from flight and immortality, starstuff can turn birds into fairies and fish into merpeople. It also mutated a salamander into some sort of giant creature that escaped into Loch Ness. Along with that, it can also grant people enhanced strength and senses, be used to power rockets... basically, it&#39;s the Deus Ex Machina to end Dei Ex Machina.</p>

            <p>I have to say, I envy Ix&#39;s access to PPC technology... <br><br>Overall, I thought the mission was good, and it&#39;s nice to see a more constructive approach to PPC missioning, as well as an affirmation that not all OCs are Sues.  The only real criticism I have is that the ending seems like a bit sudden, especially if you&#39;re not familiar with the canon.  Maybe an earlier mention of what starstuff does would be helpful for those of us who are unfamiliar with it?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m trying to see where I could possibly fit in a mention of what starstuff does without turning it into an &quot;as you know&quot; approach. I did kind of think this was enough, though:<br><br><i>“Aside from ignoring the part where handling starstuff with your bare hands is a Bad Idea, it seems like this author’s pretty familiar with the canon, from what little we’ve seen,” Ix agreed, nodding. “They certainly got the part about what else starstuff does to you—the floating, the happiness, the sounds, potential immortality and permanent flight—right. And I suppose if they were going to later show Kiki had similar ancestry to Peter, then her being able to handle it might be excusable. Maybe.”</i><br><br>Unless you think there&#39;s more that could be included?</p>

            <p>Last December, when Bayonetta was announced as the final playable character for <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> for the Wii U/3DS, I wrote a little interlude with three of my agents reacting to that, though not much came out of it IIRC.<br><br>Then, almost a year later, I took another look at it and realized that the last few paragraphs were just ASKING for a mission (involving Bayonetta&#39;s home continuum, obviously) to be dropped on my agents&#39; heads. So I&#39;ve decided to write a sequel to the interlude in question, and take care of a little subplot with two of my agents at the same time.

            <p>I have kind of mixed feelings about the grudge between Lapis and Backslash, though I know it doesn&#39;t really originate in this story.  On the one hand, conflict is good; not all characters will get along, and major issues shouldn&#39;t just disappear between stories.  On the other, I feel like the amount of tension kind of distracts from the mission itself.  There were times when the badfic seemed to have paused itself so the characters could stand around and yell at each other.  It also feels a bit... repetitive?  No offense, but a lot of your agents seem to have ongoing grudges with one another that make it almost impossible for them to work together.<br><br>Another thing I found distracting was the break in the story to explain about Lapis swearing in Arabic and why she does so.  It doesn&#39;t really feel necessary to include, or even for Backslash to comment on in the first place.  It kind of seemed like an excuse to talk about Lapis&#39;s history, even though I don&#39;t know that it was relevant to the situation.  That said, I think the amount of foreign language swearing got a bit gratuitous at times; suddenly hitting a word in a different language tends to throw the reader out of the story.  I&#39;m also not sure about Whitney calling Lapis a &quot;s***head&quot; - she seems more like the &quot;calm rage&quot; type to me than the type to swear, especially given Lapis&#39;s age.  Though my impression of her may just be mistaken.<br><br>I do think you did a good job explaining the canons, as someone who was unfamiliar with them.  The Bayonetta stuff was fine - I was even able to get a sense of her personality - and the Bleach terminology wasn&#39;t too confusing, which was quite a feat given how long the series is.  I would have liked a little more explanation/focus on what the actual plot of the badfic was, but I&#39;m not sure that was actually possible.</p>

            <p>On Lapis vs. Backslash: That was not planned, at least not initially. The initial argument in &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; was basically to get Lapis out of the picture, give her a good reason to show up at FicPsych in her next appearance, and also give Backslash a facet to him to show that he isn&#39;t the goody-two-shoes Shulk duplicate he seems to be. It&#39;s nice to know that this conflict does work to my advantage to some degree, but I will concede that I may have overdone it in this particular mission. Lapis and Backslash are planned to work together again in the future as I noted in the Author&#39;s Notes, but Backslash will probably have more pressing matters to worry about first. Lapis IS scheduled to make one more appearance (once I get some illustrations finished up), and I can assure that her character arc is going to come to a head once I make it public, so hopefully she and Backslash will be able to interact on more peaceful terms afterward.<br><br>Lapis is actually speaking in Armenian there. I wanted to find a way to drop her ethnicity at some point, since my brother suggested a while back that it would be interesting if she were partially Middle Eastern due to her middle name, Armenus. Looking back, though, I think I may have forced it here, and I may have to tone down that particular aspect of her in the future. Likewise I may have overdone the &quot;swearing in foreign languages&quot; thing with my agents, because now I have three of them who do that and I guess it&#39;s starting to get a bit tiring, even for me. (Though if I end up being dumb enough to make any other agents do the same, I can assure that Falchion won&#39;t be one of them - I do know a smattering of Indonesian, but I can&#39;t speak it for squat, let alone curse in it.)<br><br>Whitney has been known to swear before when she REALLY means business. She&#39;s also the kind of person to snap HARD if she hears someone make threats against her partner, she&#39;s that possessive of those she cares about. I know a certain psychotic character replacement who learned that the hard way.<br><br>I&#39;m honestly flattered that you feel that way about my handling of the respective continua, thank you! ^_^ This is why beta reading is important, folks - as noted in the A/N, I actually ran a lot of the canon information by my brother, who is a much bigger fan of Bleach than I am, and Matt Cipher took care of the rest. I&#39;d have explained the plot a little better, but the badfic itself was so unreadable that I couldn&#39;t tell what the heck was going on half the time and ended up wringing a little less plot potential out of it than I would&#39;ve wanted - which, come to think of it, may have been why I decided that having the agents interact with one another to a greater extent than usual would make the mission slightly more interesting.</p>

            <p>While the story seems to be presented as a kind of summary, I do like what it&#39;s trying to do. The explanation provided for the canonical contradictions are satisfying, and almost sooth some of the pain this play caused. <br><br>Almost. I could buy the possibility of alternate universes, based on how I understand time to work. But that ridiculous prototype Time Turner still shouldn&#39;t exist, Voldemort Day is still a nonsensical butterfly-effect style aesop about how the past shapes us, and everyone is still totally out of character (I mean, PIGEONS? I ask you. . .).  <br><br>None of this is, of course, your fault. The fic you posted is interesting, and a damned sight better than the original. The writing is direct, to the point, and functional, which I admire. Do try and display a little more self-confidence, though. Tempting as it is to apologize, I find it&#39;s best just to put something out there and let others give their opinions.</p>

            <p>Well, phobias exist, they are not always explained as easily as &quot;Ron’s teddy bear was turned into a dirty great spider when he was three&quot;, and we have never seen Harry petting a pigeon in the books. I actually don’t remember to have seen any pigeons in the books. But I’m more concerned about Harry being afraid of the dark. Did we ever see a hint at that in the books? Maybe we didn’t notice, because whenever Harry was in the dark, there was something more specific to fear?<br><br>That’s what I meant when I wrote &quot;sometimes it’s a bit unclear what actually <i>is</i> canon&quot;.<br><br>&quot;While talking about fear with his son Albus Severus, Harry Potter mentioned that he doesn’t like pigeons and that they give him the creeps&quot; is undeniably canon; we can’t pretend that it didn’t happen. But since JKR didn’t show us more,<ul>
<li>&quot;Harry is afraid of pigeons&quot; and<br>
</li>
<li>&quot;Harry made this up to make his son feel better&quot;</li>
</ul>are both valid interpretations of the canon sources.<br><br>I don’t like that ffnet forced me to choose &quot;Delphi Riddle&quot; from the characters list, and how the Harry Potter Wiki and even the Harry Potter Lexicon present speculation like it were canon. Actually, we don’t know whether &quot;Delphi&quot; is her true first name or whether it was just chosen for the alliteration when she pretended to be &quot;Delphini Diggory&quot;, and concerning her parents, we only have her word for having Rodolphus Lestrange’s word for it. Since JKR deliberately didn’t show us which – if any – evidence Rodolphus may or may not have presented,<ul>
<li>&quot;It’s true, she is Nofirstname Riddle&quot;,<br>
</li>
<li>&quot;Rodolphus lied about her father, she is actually Nofirstname Lestrange&quot; and<br>
</li>
<li>&quot;Rodolphus lied about her parents, she is actually Nofirstname Somebodyelsesdaughter&quot;</li>
</ul>are all valid interpretations of the canon source, with varying degrees of plausibility (increasing from top to bottom, IMO). I don’t see how her name can be anything other than &quot;Delphi Diggory&quot;, with the common understanding that it’s a chosen alias and her true name is unknown.<br><br>Thanks for the kind review.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I’m actually quite happy with what I achieved in less than three months, but I didn’t consider how the self-ironic author notes might be perceived; I’ll be more careful about that in the future.<br><br>Doing the Voldemort-wins-because-Cedric-survived alternate timeline justice would require to rewrite <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i>, <i>Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince</i> and the first part of <i>Harry Potter and the Deathley Hallows</i>. (The play implies that the final battle in this timeline happens between start of term and Halloween.)

            <p>Every other part of <i>Harry Potter</i>&#39;s been spoiled for me; why not <i>Cursed Child</i> too?<br><br>Okay, I like this story. The main problem with it? You don&#39;t seem to like it. If you&#39;re not happy with your story, why publish it and plug it on the Board? Why not work on it a bit more, rewrite it in a form you&#39;re more comfortable with, or find a cowriter who is strong in the places you feel weak? If you are happy with your story, why end each chapter with an author&#39;s note professing an inability to write? <br><br>These author&#39;s notes cause me as a reader to resent you a little, because usually when people say that kind of thing they&#39;re fishing for compliments. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing here, but it has that association and leaves a bitter taste. They also feel like excuses: &quot;I can&#39;t write novels,&quot; which confused me at first; fix fics are not novels, &quot;so don&#39;t expect this to be good.&quot; The reasons why this is not valid are, I believe, outlined in the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Other_People">FAQ: For Other People</a>. It&#39;s also annoying, along the lines of &quot;I suck at summaries.&quot; Let your story speak for itself.<br><br>It&#39;s a good story, too. Feedback on it is harder for me to give, not quite being familiar with the canon, but I will write you up an analysis of what you did well at lunchtime.<br><br>--Key is almost late for class.</p>

This is a minor problem, but one you should look at, anyway, to see if what you wrote matches what you thought you were writing.  (I actually prefer the way he is written to the way he is described.  He makes a better counterpoint to your Time Lord.)<br><br>2) Another insufferable Time Lord.  Ugh!  Someone should build a time wall and make Gallifrey pay for it.

I mean, from what I hear he&#39;s a great guy.  Very smart.  Found a way out of the Crooked Doctor&#39;s media blackout, but it got sabotaged.  You won&#39;t hear that in the media.  But I can tell you, if I had been in the Time War, I&#39;d have won.  &#39;Cause that&#39;s what I do.  I win.  And you know who&#39;s to blame for the whole thing?  The Crooked Doctor.  I&#39;m serious.  He started the whole thing for his own political ends.  I mean, the guy says he&#39;s all healing and peace and love, but the media&#39;s not telling you about how he was for the War.  He was.  Very reliable sources have told me.  He changed his name and was for the War and then changed it back.  Disgusting.<br><br>-Phobos, The Politician</p>

            <p>Actualy, Mr. Phobos, diamonds are not very valuable, in fact they&#39;re very common.

            <p>Since I&#39;m guessing that your character bios will appear on the Wiki, I&#39;d be remiss if I didn&#39;t correct a confusing sentence in Jack&#39;s description:<br><br><i>  While he doesn’t have an issue improvising if the fic’s ‘verse doesn’t allow for it, he prefers to use the firearms his father gave him to get the job done.</i><br><br>The double negatives in the first clause are throwing me off. Are you saying that Jack wants to improvise in situations where he should be sticking to the canon&#39;s rules? That&#39;s what you have written. If I read the context correctly, you&#39;re trying to say that Jack is able to improvise when the canon doesn&#39;t allow for <i>guns</i>. In that case, make the connection explicit, preferably by switching the clauses:<br><br><i> While he prefers to use the firearms his father gave him to get the job done, he doesn’t have an issue improvising if the fic’s ‘verse doesn’t allow for them.</i></p>

            <p>First up, <a href="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/MesoamericardanFellowship.jpg">a link</a> to the uncensored version of the Fellowship image, featuring a sketch map of &#39;Middle-earth&#39;.<br><br>Secondly:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/FreePeoplesSml.jpg"><br><br>(I considered playing Guess Who Too with this, but... didn&#39;t. ^_^)<br><br>Eowyn and Eomer are modelled on the Serrano people of southern California (ie, Rohan). They wear yucca skirts/aprons, which seems somewhat uncomfortable. They also wear their hair long... because of plot requirements. (Or maybe Eowyn is just particularly flat-chested? Tolkien doesn&#39;t really specify.)<br><br>Galadriel, meanwhile, is fully-clothed in Noldorin garb from over the Sea. She&#39;s Mongolian, actually, which is hilarious in light of Tolkien&#39;s description of Orcs: <i>in fact degraded and repulsive versions of the (to Europeans) least lovely Mongol-types.</i> Her robe is embroidered in characteristic Noldorin fashion.<br><br>As is Elrond&#39;s, though he hails from a different cultural tradition. He&#39;s wearing Sindarin clothing, AKA Tlingit (Pacific Northwest, venturing up into Alaska/Beleriand). It&#39;s closely related to the Hobbits&#39; garb, which explains why Bilbo and friends feel so comfortable in Rivendell. The main differences are the wool fringes, and - as stated - the Noldorin embroidery to mark the other part of his cultural heritage.<br><br>Oh, and the hat. He has a basket-hat.<br><br>I&#39;ve also thumbnailed in a couple of locations. The Last Homely House is a traditional Tlingit plank house: large, with a central fireplace and opening above it, with paintings and carvings on the front. (You can just about make out the Star of Feanor on there, and a pair of swan wings for... wow, about half a dozen things.) It would seem out-of-place and otherworldly in eastern Idaho, where Rivendell was.<br><br>As for Lorien... well, Mongols live in yurts. And yurts have big round holes in the middle. And the tallest trees in the western US are redwoods. So yeah, in Mesoamericarda, mallorns are golden redwoods, with houses built around their bases.<br><br>At this point I either venture up to Beleriand, start repeating costumes (eg do Denethor, Thorin - I guess Lake-Town would be new?), or delve into the tricky question of Orcs and <s>evil</s> tragically misunderstood people. :-/ Decisions...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s essentially my LotR-geek self at war with my Native History geek-self, but I think they mostly agree that this is awesome - I&#39;ve had the same thought a handful of times, to be honest. I know Tolkien intended it to be England, but wow does that ever not work at all in light of the Columbian Exchange. So I&#39;m gonna have to take some time to read this theory more carefully and craft a more detailed response. <br><br>In the meantime- :D<br><br>(With one caveat - the Americas were not, in fact, settled via the Bering Strait land bridge; those timelines worked for archaeologists back hen we thought settlement was 10-12 thousand years, but now we know it&#39;s more likely to be about 30 thousand, and there&#39;s no way there was an ice-free corridor at that time.)</p>

            <p>But right now, &quot;boats and island-hopping&quot; is actually the most common answer. Depending, of course, on who you ask. But basically, archaeologists have so many sites for indigenous occupancy that go back to . . . I think the most well-established site is 17K, but it&#39;s pretty far south, to the extent that it would&#39;ve required a very intentional fast march south from Beringia, which strains belief rather a lot. The 30K date is somewhat contested, especially in conservative circles, but it&#39;s a solid bet- others are making claims for 50,000 or more. <br><br>Anyway - yes, that is my instinct. It makes me happy to see someone taking non-Western European cultures seriously in fantasy, even if the details get a bit mushed. And this feels a lot more respectful (with the caveat, of course, that I am white and so my voice shouldn&#39;t count for THAT much) than . . . well, anything coming out of Ilvermorny. Or most of the things that come up in fantasy as cameos or &quot;savagery&quot; contrasts. </p>

            <p>There are nine, Gimli is recognizable, and the heights and matching clothes among people of the same group (not to mention the wizard) makes it fairly clear that this is the Fellowship of the Ring :) I can&#39;t quite think of how you got to this version of them, though--is it an attempt to slot them into recognizable Earth history?

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Some time ago <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/netilardo/Theory18.htm">I crafted a theory</a> that Middle-earth was not, in fact, prehistoric Europe - it was prehistoric <i>America</i>. Instantly, a whole heap of things dropped into place - the presence of potatoes, the fact that Hawaii is clearly the remains of Numenor, the way North America was settled over an ice bridge <i>just like Beleriand</i>. I scribbled a few maps, invented some discussion threads, and left it there.<br><br>And now I&#39;ve un-left it. I&#39;ve indulged in some creative historical anachronism here - Tolkien said 6000 years, but we don&#39;t know <i>what</i> people wore in the American Archaic era (other than &#39;clothes&#39;), so I&#39;ve cribbed from slightly-pre-Columbian cultures. I have, however, taken pains to make them accurate to the areas the Walkers came from.<br><br>The top row starts with an empty space (where my map is - we&#39;re using the Colorado model, Mesoamericarda scholars), and then we have Frodo and Sam. They&#39;re both in Chinook clothes; Frodo has a tunic/robe thing because he&#39;s higher status. They both have some bulky jewellery, notably bracelets (plus a certain Ring).<br><br>Next is Boromir, who&#39;s Mohave. Gondor is the only agricultural civilisation outside the Shire, which, actually, do you remember anyone else <i>having</i> farms? Because I don&#39;t. Anyway, Boz is heavily tattooed, with a rabbit-skin cloak and feather hairpiece to symbolise his high status. He also has a turquoise necklace, which is the only thing on here that&#39;s accurate to the <i>period</i>.<br><br>Then Gandalf. Gandalf is Tibetan (did you know China has three main ethnic groups? One lives in the mountains and is religious, one lives in the north, and one is the most numerous. Hi, Vanyar, Noldor, and Teleri!), which happens to mean I can put him in a pointy felt hat (held on by his braid). The robe folds down over the belt to make a huge pocket - perfect for his pipe.<br><br>Dropping down to the second row, we start with Legolas. He&#39;s a hybrid - the Silvan elves live in Crow territory, so he wears his hair long and puts it in a bun. But their <i>origin</i> is far away, on the shores of Cuivienen - that is to say, in western Louisiana. His dominant culture is Natchez, which means he gets a glorious feathered mantle. (Also a blowpipe. Because blowpipe.)<br><br>Then Gimli. Gimli is pure Cheyenne, from his buffalo-hide cloak to his war shield and (stone) axe. He has traces of a war bonnet - which is apparently the term for those big feathered headpieces - but that was a bit too blatant for me to go all-in.<br><br>Then Merry and Pippin, who are Chinook like the other hobbits. Note that all four also have flattened foreheads - apparently that&#39;s a thing.<br><br>Finally, Aragorn, our second cultural mashup. He&#39;s mostly Paiute, with its love of fringes and feather decoration (and ponchos!). But he&#39;s also the Heir of Isildur, and wears a turquoise mosaic necklace and hair-feather ornament (handily recalling the Crown of Gondor with its swan-wings). The sword he carries is the reforged obsidian blade Anduril, naturally.<br><br>(The fall of Arnor makes a lot more sense when you realise the bulk of its territory is the Great Basin - Nevada and Utah. How&#39;re your hunter-gatherer kingdoms going to survive when there&#39;s nothing to hunt or gather...?)<br><br>Am I a crackpot? Of course I am! But the more I work on the theory, the more I find myself thinking &#39;hey, this is kind of plausible...&#39; ^_~<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: I guess next I have to work out what to do with orcs. And Rohan, where they didn&#39;t wear tops. Um... I think Eowyn needs long hair? ~hS</p>

            <p>They&#39;re in roughly the right place, especially if we take the &quot;Gulf of Mexico is sort of the Sea of Nurnen&quot; model, they were hunters, and they were renowned for their ritualistic cannibalism in our time - indeed, the word &quot;cannibal&quot; derives from a borked Spanish pronunciation of &quot;Carib&quot;.

            <p>However, I&#39;m loath to share it for the same reason Tolkien was weirded out by orcs - an &quot;evil race&quot; doesn&#39;t work. And it feels dehumanizing to associate <i>any</i> group with something like the orcs. So I don&#39;t know exactly how you&#39;d get around that. <br><br>That said, there were several groups who were widely feared for their ferocity in battle. The Toltecs (ancestors in some sense of the Aztecs) were one. And they pledged their allegiance to a king in a hard-to-reach city, so there&#39;s that. I&#39;m still not sold on that though. <br><br>So, two potential solutions. You could flip the image of &quot;savagery&quot; on its head and make Europeans (Vikings, even - they came earlier than most) the orcs, which is problematic for all its own special reasons, OR you could do what Tolkien did and invent them, with American Indigenous cultural markings instead of European ones. </p>

It doesn&#39;t <i>seem</i> to be a religious figure or anything - it&#39;s basically a troll.<br><br>The orc has most of the features of the Atasaya - long straggly hair (which it pushes back with its bloodstained flint knife, making a red &#39;eye&#39; on its forehead - very apt!), bulging yellow eyes, tusks, scales on its arms, horned knuckles... the main thing it lacks is the whole &#39;being gigantic&#39; aspect. Honestly this should really be a troll, but Wikipedia&#39;s list of Native American Demons is only nine articles long. ;)<br><br>Its clothes are vaguely Apache, but honestly pretty generic: breechcloth and some sort of armour (leather or plant fibre), and a headband. The Eye is designed to look less European, more Native; I don&#39;t know how well that worked.<br><br>I&#39;ve also sketched up Frodo (or Sam) in Orc gear. He can probably pass in the dark, provided you don&#39;t look too close - which is about accurate for the canon.<br><br>And Bag-end, there in the thumbnail. It&#39;s a Chinook winter house - a pit with a wood/grass roof over it. I&#39;ve buried this one slightly into the side of the hill, which is an adaptation to using it as a permanent structure; it probably does extend out the back by this time, because more space is always welcome.<br><br>If anyone knows any better demons, I&#39;d love to make a better Orc; this can be repurposed as a troll just by extending the scales.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It may seem off, but wooly mammoths for either dragons or Balrogs. There are in fact Algonquin stories about this massive greedy animal, whose description perfectly matches the mammoth, who takes up so much water and food that nothing else (game, especially) can live in its territory, followed by the way a clever hero managed to destroy it by weakening and sharpening the trunks of the trees it used to rub against. <br><br>So, giant, greedy, dangerous, and destroyed by valiant and clever hero… sounds a lot like a Balrog to me!</p>

The great woolly dragons of the old North - Beleriand is somewhere in Alaska, the details aren&#39;t quite fixed yet - are gone by the third age, except for isolated hold-outs like Smaug. The smaller <i>mearas</i> of Valinorean extraction aren&#39;t particularly closely related (and are probably mastodons, rather than Columbian mammoths) - it&#39;s possible that Morgoth twisted <i>mearas</i> into dragons, he has to have based them on something.

            <p>(As this thread continued, I went home for a weekend and was blasted with commitments on my return. Hence the lack of response. But I got to see Delta Juliette, so that was fun!)<br><br>Two things on Rowling. One, she removed the figures she took from their context, which many Native people feels robs them of meaning. Two, she took figures from Native mythology, but few to no Native <i>people</i>. That&#39;s kind of a slap in the face. <br><br>Now, as to the Yrch - on the one hand, it&#39;s definitely a better idea than designating a given people as orcs. On the other hand, I think you&#39;re very much stuck with the Southwest as inspiration - those &quot;evil goblin/bad creatures will get you&quot; aren&#39;t really big anywhere else, and evil is a different thing there than it is in Europe. Essentially, Tolkien&#39;s Catholicism shines through every aspect of his storytelling, and it&#39;s hard to find an indigenous mythos that&#39;s analogous to that. So it would be complicated. The Southwest nations certainly have the closest parallels, though - and for that matter, you could use Naagloshi for Nazgul or Balrogs or the like. (I mean, except that everyone goes for skinwalkers, so there&#39;s that.)<br><br>One other nitpick - I&#39;d replace Anduril with a war club. You really can&#39;t reforge obsidian, and making large blades with it is rather impractical. It&#39;s basically glass, and heat treating it just turns it into ...some other stone that I&#39;ve forgotten. It&#39;s soft and opaque, though. War clubs, on the other hand, could be used repeatedly and were a very important weapon at least in the North - Iroquois and Algonquin peoples used them to great effect even in the Seven Years&#39; War, if I recall correctly. </p>

            <p>Rowling: yeah, the lack of actual Natives bothered me, too (which is why my anti-propaganda stories usually included them).<br><br>Orcs: I don&#39;t want to touch skinwalkers with a barge pole, frankly, all things considered. ;) I think the orc I did is as good as it gets for South-west Evil Goblins, but is there another possibility? Can we come up with something that still fits the text of the book - willing to fight against humans, and not very <i>fond</i> of them either - but without having to be Necessarily Evil? Mesoamericarda is based on the conceit that Tolkien&#39;s notes are his translation efforts - LotR, Hobbit and Silm are &#39;finished&#39;, but any other notes may be mistranslated or speculative. So we don&#39;t know where orcs <i>come</i> from, not for sure...<br><br>Anduril: the key thing about Anduril is that it&#39;s <i>not</i> a local weapon. It&#39;s Numenorean, from the volcanic chain around Hawai&#39;i. It also vastly predates the first recorded settlements on Hawai&#39;i - of course it does! Numenor <i>sank</i>, the Hawaiian chain is just the rubble. So obsidian is perfectly viable (and the fact that the Black Numenoreans in central America used it is a big point in its favour).<br><br>As Scapegrace says, the scenario is less re<i>forging</i> than re<i>building</i>. The precision technology to fix obsidian perfectly in wood isn&#39;t going to be common in the American Archaic: any old Arnorian could bodge a couple of the obsidian-shards of Narsil into a working axe or something, but it takes Elvish craft to remake the true, original blade. War clubs, or something like them, are probably the more commonplace weapon, and likely what Merry used against the Witch-King. (In fact, I think I gave Boromir one...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>From what I remember of the prop design from the movie, the break in the blade was largely central from where Sauron stamped on it. It therefore makes sense to have the Mesoamericarda version to simply have the wooden core snapped to splinters, with a single piece of obsidian hacking Sauron&#39;s finger off. It <i>also</i> means that the design can be rebuilt by the elves - worked metal wasn&#39;t really around much back then, but intricately carved wood? I can see that.

            <p>So, as some of you may already know, my biggest dream is to become a translator/interpreter (both, if possible), and earn a living by talking, or writing the same thing twice in two languages :P<br><br>But this time I&#39;ve decided to do something else - translate a short story from Polish to English. I don&#39;t ask you to judge how well I did it, since you probably don&#39;t know the source material, but I felt like sharing it because maybe you can judge the content of the story itself... and maybe if you enjoy it, and feel like reading more, I may do this more often.<br><br>So, without further ado, I give you - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IojvWNUWmlVN1O1wHLvsLNVaaOXJIGkGfXjw7iQx4ww/edit">Granny&#39;s Guide to Disposing of Bodies</a><br><br>Also, I would like to thank Aegis and Tesla for making some crucial SPaG adjustments! You two are the best!</p>

            <p>... although the link title may not suffice as a trigger warning. Granny, of course, reminds me of the Cleaner in <i>Pulp Fiction</i>.<br><br>I can’t be sure whether you reproduce a flaw of the original story or actually lost connotations of a polish word I don’t know, but I think the guy in <i>&quot;But, you’re the boss… right, boss?&quot; <b>A man</b> next to him asked, fidgeting hesitantly</i> should better be introduced as &quot;a young man&quot;; and &quot;a&quot; should not be capitalized, because it continues the sentence.<br><br><i>... and especially <b>how could he</b> tremble thinking what his beautiful and petite wife was going to do ...</i><br>&quot;How could he&quot; is the word order for a question; since this is not a question, it should be &quot;how he could&quot;.<br><br>Again, I’m not sure whether the ongoing tense issues in this paragraph are the original story’s fault (or Polish grammar may just be different):<br><i>Boris <b>didn’t plan</b> it, damnit.</i> <br>Should be &quot;hadn’t planned&quot; (past perfect).<br>Since too much past perfect is hard to read, telling the backstory in past tense although it had happened before the actual story may be acceptable, but at least<br><i>She’d leave him, just like she <b>announced</b>...</i> should be in past perfect again – &quot;had announced&quot;.<br><br><i>I know somebody <b>that</b> can help, but I have <b>a to</b> warn you, wolfie, she doesn’t like being argued with.</i><br>If this isn’t meant to be Dora’s specific slang, &quot;that&quot; should be &quot;who&quot; (talking about a person, not an object); and remove &quot;a&quot;.<br><br><i>She looked about sixty, maybe seventy years old, and was giving off the impression of a woman <b>that</b> he would have left his pups with without hesitation; one <b>that</b> he would offer to carry heavy grocery bags for…</i><br>Should be &quot;who&quot; again (two occurences).<br><br><i>Boris and Andrew grabbed it, <b>placed on</b> the sheet of cellophane, and Granny started her work without any excessive explanations.</i><br>Missing word &quot;it&quot;.<br><br><i>Next time, if you’re gonna do this yourselves, try to separate the <b>joins</b>, and avoid breaking bones.</i><br>Should probably be &quot;joints&quot; (plural of &quot;joint&quot;) although the plural of &quot;join&quot; may fit the context too.  (Tomash may have said that already.) <br><br><i>Fifteen minutes later, Granny took care of the second body as meticulously as the first, chopping it into handy pieces, <b>putting in</b> a bag, and finally wrapping both bags with strong tape.</i><br>Missing word, either &quot;it&quot; (referring to the body) or &quot;them&quot; (referring to the pieces).<br><br><i>None of you <b>remember</b> that fact before the deed.</i><br>I don’t know what to make of this; it depends on what is actually meant in the original text.<ul>
<li>If it’s meant to be a shortcut question – &quot;(Did) none of you remember that fact before the deed?&quot; –  Granny leaving out the &quot;Did&quot;, the period should be a question mark.    <br>
</li>
<li>If it’s meant to be a statement, it should either be &quot;remembered&quot; (past tense, referring to the actual deed) or &quot;remembers&quot; (third person singular, because &quot;none&quot; refers to a single one out of an unspecified number, and present tense referring to them always slaughtering people without thinking it through.<br>
</li>
<li>In the latter case, inserting &quot;ever&quot; (&quot;None of you ever remembers ... &quot;) might clarify that Granny doesn’t refer solely to the current situation, and probably refers to all men, not just Andrew and Boris.</li>
</ul>
<br><i>Granny winked at him, unwrapping the bandana that <b>keeping</b> her elegant perm intact.</i><br>Again I don’t know what to do with this. Possible are:<ul>
<li>&quot;kept&quot; – simple past tense, just narrating.<br>
</li>
<li>&quot;was keeping&quot; – past tense continuous, because the bandana continued to keep the perm intact at least until Granny finished to unwrap it. <br>
</li>
<li>&quot;had kept&quot; – past perfect, because the bandana was removed and thus didn’t keep the perm intact anymore.<br>
</li>
<li>&quot;had been keeping&quot; – past perfect continuous, discontinuing the &quot;keeping intact&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<br><i>My grandchildren will wake up in roughly <b>to</b> hours.</i><br>Should be &quot;two&quot;.<br><br><i>She smiled devilishly, packing all of her bottles and brushes <b>to</b> the suitcase.</i><br>I’m not absolutely sure, but I think this should be &quot;into&quot;.<br><br><i>One more day and I’d probably kill them, but then I’d have <b>problem</b> with the bodies.</i><br>This should either be &quot;a problem&quot; (singular) or &quot;problems&quot; (plural).<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>... and it seems like it&#39;d be more convenient and fun if we moved it here! The basic idea is that we give each other prompts, and then we write fics in response to those prompts, using either our agents or, with the permission of others, the agents of said others. So, I&#39;m going to start mini-threads for who&#39;s willing to have their agents used by others, and one for every prompt we&#39;ve gotten so far. If you feel like making another prompt, post it in reply to this post. If you&#39;re giving permission for your agents to be used or are posting a fic/ficlet, post in the mini-threads that apply to you, and have a blast! All this is non-canon unless stated otherwise, of course, and I don&#39;t think anybody will mind some OOCness, or a lot, depending on the prompt. So, with that said, let&#39;s go!</p>

And they were cloudy and weightless and as ethereal as ghosts, and they were drifting around his head like skybound porridge. <br><br>&#39;Dude, ummmm, dude dude dude,&#39; Maz was pacing around somewhere or other. Yocherry didn&#39;t really know. They could have been in space, right then. It felt a little like it. <br><br>&#39;Oooh, duuuude, dude.&#39; <br>She seemed terribly worried about something. <br>Yocherry twisted his head. It flopped, smacking an ear against the dirt. The vibrations warbled in his skull. Yocherry felt very strange. <br>He had something to tell her, he realised. <br><br>Yocherry gurgled at her. <br><br>&#39;No, dude, don&#39;t, um, talk, dude! Just wait - I - it&#39;s, um, muscles, tearing. Um. Don&#39;t worry, uh, dude, it&#39;s alright!&#39; She said, quivering like a leaf in an earthquake. <br><br>Yocherry gurgled at her. He thought that he smiled, but it came out as more of a crooked grimace. <br><br>&#39;Dude, um, dude, please!&#39; <br><br>Yocherry raised a smarmy eyebrow, and gurgled again. <br><br>&#39;Dude, are you, umm, being <i>sassy</i>?&#39; <br><br>Yocherry gurgled with even greater sass. <br>He was very interested in hearing her reply, but something inside of him gave up. Then the sun and the sky and the land and Maz all disappeared, and Yocherry was certain he actually <i>was</i> in space. <br><br><br><br><br>Maz was looking at the floor. <br>It had been a week since Yocherry had gotten thirty per cent of himself blown out onto the grass by an angry Stu with a very powerful gun, and he was as conscious as a brick, hooked up, plugged into, and being injected by some of the best medical equipment in the multiverse. <br>Yocherry hadn’t done much, except for wake up a few hours earlier, mumble about snails and batteries, and immediately drop back into sleep. <br>Maz had tensed up like a metal spring, listened sharply to the whole thing, and had remained tensed, prepared for any additions to his arguments and points, for the next hour. Nothing came up, needless to say. <br><br>‘Maaaaaaaz.’ <br><br>Maz tensed up like a metal spring. <br><br>‘Heeeeeeeey, booooss,’ Yocherry murmured, eyes glassily staring in her direction. <br><br>‘Dude, um, are you, uh - you, um, I don’t think you should talk, um, dude,’ Maz babbled, dividing her attention between Yocherry’s sleepy, drooping face, and the plastic wires filled with odd liquids that were keeping it from giving up, rotting, and dropping off. <br><br>‘Got interuuuuupted…’ Yocherry said. <br><br>‘Um.’ <br><br>‘You waaaaant…’<br><br>‘Um.’<br><br>‘To heeeear, booooooss?’ <br>With that, he wobbled around slightly, attempting to gesture to her. <br>Maz stepped forward. She leant in. She was dead silent. <br>Yocherry was silent, too, for a few moments, remembering what he was about to say. He inhaled. <br><br>‘That ent nothin.’ His voice was low and secretive. He grinned sloppily. Maz stared at him. <br>‘I’ve had worse.’ <br>His job finally done, Yocherry dropped back into unconsciousness. <br>Maz continued staring at him. </p>

            <p>Vania walked into her RC, arms full of tiny milk cartons and face full of a big grin.  &quot;Doc, I just scored, Doc—Doc.  Doc, what the hell are you doing?&quot;<br><br>Reclining on the floor in front of the portal generator, Doc arched an eyebrow.  &quot;Just providing myself with a little atmosphere while I read.  Looks like the next chapter takes place in the White Lands of Empathica.&quot;  He hit a button on the remote activator, and the portal behind him switched from a side view of some run-down train depot to a deadly quiet snowscape.  Doc shielded his novel from the few snowflakes that the nearly still air tumbled into the RC and tried to go back to reading.<br><br>Vania had now crushed a good number of her milk cartons, and some were leaking onto the floor.  &quot;No.  No.  <i>No</i>.  Close that this instant.  What are you thinking?  Even if that wasn&#39;t a Stephen King novel full of monsters, there could be canons seeing your portal, there could be anachronisms falling in from our end.  Close it.  NOW.&quot;<br><br>Doc didn&#39;t look away from the pages.  &quot;This is how I read now.  It&#39;s one of the perks of the job.&quot;<br><br>Vania stared for a moment.  Then she made a noise that would roughly be spelled, &quot;Hrouargh!&quot;  She carried her big score to the mini-fridge and kicked the door open.  She loaded the surviving cartons inside, moving quickly and being rather less than careful.<br><br>Then, she found a trash bag and loaded the ruined cartons inside.  She was in the middle of wiping up all the spilled milk off the generic surface when she suddenly felt <i>wrong</i>.<br><br>So wrong.<br><br>She immediately turned to look at Doc and the portal.  At some point, her partner had changed the coordinates to show a ruined, plantless landscape, where the very shape of the rock formations gave off a sense of <i>bending</i>, of space itself deteriorating.  A noxious smell was seeping into the RC, and somewhere in the distant depths of the portal, a laugh echoed that sounded unsettlingly <i>animal</i>.<br><br>But none of those details were what set the hairs on the back of Vania&#39;s neck on end.  It was the fact that Doc was standing still, staring at her before she had turned, and he had dropped the book <i>without putting the bookmark in first</i>.<br><br>In a quiet, toneless voice, Doc said, &quot;Hail, Discordia.  All hail the Crimson King.&quot;<br><br>Vania stared blankly.  She slowly approached Doc, who started forward confidently, his hands making grasping motions as the thing inside him tested out the muscles.  just before they reached each other, Vania said, &quot;First mistake.&quot;<br><br>As Doc started to reach for her throat, she dropped low and hooked her foot behind Doc&#39;s left knee and pulled, taking him off-balance.  Then she grabbed his right arm, twisted around and flung him over her shoulder.  Doc landed on the beanbag chair, and the long-suffering piece of quasi-furniture finally saw its end as its innards exploded all around the floor.<br><br>&quot;Possessing an agent who&#39;s a crappy fighter and never exercizes.  Second mistake.&quot;  She walked over to the console, listening to Doc&#39;s body squirming on the floor.  Whatever had taken up residence wasn&#39;t accustomed to having nerve endings.  &quot;Infiltrating an organization with an entire team of people dedicated to literally nothing but exorcisms.  &#39;Open bracket-dee-bee-es-close bracket.&#39;  There, that ought to bring at least a few slashers.  Now, we just have to wait.&quot;<br><br>She turned back to face Doc, still sprawled on the floor, gazing up at her with equal parts curiosity and loathing.  Vania cracked a knuckle.  &quot;Whether we wait quietly . . . well, that&#39;s up to you, I suppose.&quot;</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad Ananta comes off as cute; I&#39;m rather fond of the concept of a Bad Slash agent who doesn&#39;t really understand how smut works.  Or romantic relationships.  Or human biology...  At least it makes her hard to squick?  Though Ananta balances it out by having an excellent memory for canon details and strong grammar knowledge.

            <p>((A/N: Revised version of what I posted in the chat. This is totally uncanonical, as I don&#39;t have Permission, and also because I haven&#39;t yet decided whether or not Meg exists.))<br><br>&quot;You know, I&#39;ve always admired you,&quot; T&#39;Kat said. She glanced across the table at the other woman. Vulcan ideals were well and good, but this was definitely an occasion when she needed to figure out how emotional cues worked. She observed Meg look downward and start cleaning under her nails with her knife. However, she was nearly certain her mouth had twisted into a smile. <br><br>&quot;Really? Why?&quot; Meg asked offhandedly. <br><br>T&#39;Kat shifted around to face her, almost knocking her cane from where it was propped against the table. She was surprised and pleased to see the wrinkles on Meg&#39;s forehead deepen with worry in the moments before she caught it. <br><br>&quot;Well, you&#39;re a very creative exorcist, for starters.&quot; <br><br>Meg&#39;s laugh could almost be called girlish. It startled T&#39;Kat to remember that the time-hardened woman she&#39;d befriended was only thirty-six years old, less than a quarter her own age. Humans grew up so fast, especially in pre-modern continua. <br><br>&quot;I have been impressed by how confident you are,&quot; T&#39;Kat said, &quot;Especially after having lived in such a repressive universe. I&#39;ve heard <i>Macbeth</i> called Shakespeare&#39;s most misogynistic play.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, it wasn&#39;t so bad for me,&quot; Meg said, &quot;According to the play, Lady Mackers had a hard time of it, but my husband was a good man.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sure that is true, but I would prefer you not speak of your husband unless it&#39;s strictly necessary.&quot; Meg looked up for a moment, and suddenly they were looking into each other&#39;s eyes. T&#39;Kat looked away. <br><br>&quot;My emotions are not the same as a Human&#39;s,&quot; T&#39;Kat continued, &quot;and I don&#39;t think that what I am feeling now is analogous to jealousy, but you are free to think of it as such.&quot;<br><br>Out of the corner of her eye, she could see Meg&#39;s cheeks growing pinker. Was that a good sign? It had been so long since she&#39;d tried to seduce anyone but Anthek. And even that was years ago now. <br><br>&quot;I suppose you&#39;re right,&quot; Meg said, &quot;I have been making up for lost time.&quot; T&#39;Kat furrowed her brow. Did that follow logically from what they had been talking about before? Perhaps this was one of those conversations that didn&#39;t need to make sense in the strictest way. She could use that to her advantage. <br><br>&quot;Would you like to come over to my Response Center, feed each other chocolate, make out, and whatever would plausibly follow that?&quot; Meg&#39;s  eyes went wide at that, but she smiled. <br><br>T&#39;Kat was about to wiggle her eyebrows suggestively when her partner galloped over, a bowl full of soggy enchiladas and what looked like an empty bottle of ranch dressing balanced precariously on eir abdomen. <br><br>&quot;T&#39;Kat! T&#39;Kat!&quot; Kebrdå stopped to catch eir breath for a moment. &quot;T&#39;Kat, what does a spoon look like? The cafeteria worker said I needed one.&quot;<br><br>T&#39;Kat sighed. Not dramatically...but on the spectrum leading to that adverb. Meg burst out laughing. <br><br>T&#39;Kat picked up her own spoon from her empty soup bowl and held it out in front of the still-woefully-undereducated Venusian. A piece of noodle flicked off and onto eir feeler. Ey pressed eir lips together in consternation. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not interrupting anything, am I?&quot; Meg laughed even harder at that. Kebrdå&#39;s mouth opened slightly as he recognized her voice. <br><br>&quot;Oh! That&#39;s the Human you are in a relationship with? Want to do a relationship with? I&#39;m getting that wrong.&quot; Ey froze for a moment, eir feelers twitching from side to side, then turned and <i>ran</i>. </p>

            <p>I like seeing older agents, it makes for a nice change, and T&#39;Kat and Meg are very cute together.  Plus, Vulcans!  Also, I&#39;m now intensely curious as to what Kebrdå looks like, exactly.<br><br><i>&quot;I&#39;m not interrupting anything, am I?&quot; Meg laughed even harder at that. Kebrdå&#39;s mouth opened slightly as he recognized her voice. </i><br>A few minor technical points -  you may want to indicate that it&#39;s Kebrdå speaking here, as it looks like Meg is at first.  Also, (I think) you&#39;re referring to Kebrdå as he instead of ey?</p>

            <p>That&#39;s what I get for staying up writing past my bedtime :-/. <br><br>Yes, that should be ey. Not sure whether or not I can blame that on autocorrect: my phone isn&#39;t used to Spivak pronouns, but also it could be me screwing up and thinking of Kebrdå as currently biologically male rather than as a member of a species in which physical sex is fluid and gender is not usually culturally significant. In the process of developing em, ey&#39;s been through five different genders and seven different home continua :-/. I think I&#39;ve finally made up my mind, though. <br><br>Eir continuum is original -- actually, it&#39;s a running joke I have with a friend. Eir species has been described as resembling &quot;an armchair with feathers.&quot; Kebrdå&#39;s feathers are blue and green. <br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m glad you liked the story! Hope this confuses/intrigues you further. <br><br>--Key</p>

I have to run analysis on my team to see what happens if I replace Claydol with Gallade.&quot; Apecian sighed, and rolled over on the couch.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re no fun,&quot; he said quietly. Michael did not hear him.<br><br>&quot;Steadfast, I believe, will be better than Justified. Hmm, I think Swords Dance will be very effective. Psycho Cut, of course, what kind of Psychic-type player would I be if I didn&#39;t have that?&quot; Michael continued in this vein for some time, and Apecian kept sulking until Michael was finished, at which point he quickly began begging Michael to help him.</p>

            <p>Apecian ran down the hall, gasping. True, he could clear up the tiredness with a bit of charge from his stone, but that&#39;d be a waste, even when escaping from them. A line of red tape flew past him, narrowly missing entangling his legs. &quot;Bunnies,&quot; he muttered between gasps.<br><br>“Get back here!” a voice cried. That voice belonged to the Notary, possibly the most annoying person in all of Headquarters, Flowers included.<br><br>“Nope!” Apecian yelled back, still running. Up ahead, he could see a split. Great! If he could just go through a few more of those, he could lose her! He should have known not to think that. The IO was always listening.<br><br>“We’ve got you!” The Notary cried, dashing out from the left corridor. She faced him, staser in her right hand and a ridiculously tall stack of paperwork hugged to her side by her left. Apecian turned, hoping he was wrong, but, of course, he wasn’t. The Notary was in front of him this way, too.<br><br>“Great,” he muttered. One of the Notaries has split off from the other one, and they’d somehow managed to trap him in this hallway. The Notary who had been in front of him, but was now behind him, walked up to him and pulled several papers off the top of the pile.<br>“These are the forms you’ll need to complete to get the item you requested,” she told him. She pulled even more papers from the pile. “And here are two extra copies. Please fill them all out.” Apecian looked around, trying to figure a way out, but it was no use. They had him boxed in, and without his hammer, he couldn’t even try and tackle one out of the way, because the other would shoot his feet off, and then they’d make him help put all the papers the one he’d tackled had dropped in order. He shuddered at the thought. No, better just to accept it. He sighed, and accepted the papers from the Notary.<br><br>“Do either of you have a pen?” he asked. The Notaries looked at each other. Should they…? No, that would be excessive, even for them. One reached into a pocket and pulled out a number two pencil, a pencil sharpener, and an eraser.<br><br>“Use these,” she told the Homunculus. “If you make a mistake, erase it thoroughly so that no confusion will result.” He groaned, and took it, and the forms.<br><br>“This is gonna suck,” he muttered.<br><br>“Would you like some help?” a familiar voice called from the end of the hallway. Apecian looked up, and grinned.<br>“Michael!” he cried, getting to his feet. Indeed, it was his partner, wearing his yellow Tracker’s Lenses, which explained how he’d managed to find his partner without getting lost. “Thank goodness. Could you fill these out for me? The Notary’s trying to get me to do it three times!” Michael smiled, and shook his head.<br><br>“I’m not going to do it all for you,” he said, walking to his partner. “But…” He paused as he bent down, then rifled through the papers, pulled out a number of them, and stood up again. “If you’ll do one set, I’ll do the other two.”<br><br>Apecian grimaced, but said, “Sure.” He snatched the writing materials from the Notary in front of him, and Michael graciously accepted a set from the other Notary. The two agents then sat down to work on them as the Notaries looked on triumphantly.</p>

            <p>He watched the little Absol run from the Pokémon Centre into the woods. Trainers often did that; Pokémon that didn’t make the cut when they were bred for specific natures or IVs were simply released into the wild— even if they were barely out of the egg. The little one darting to and fro, alone and confused, was obviously one of the undesirables. From his vantage point in the underbrush he watched her blindly flee deeper into the forest and disappear from his sight.<br><br>For a moment, he debated whether going after her— was it worth it in the end? The world was a cruel, harsh place. Things like this were commonplace. Not everyone had a place to go at the end of the day: case in point, the female Absol. Case in point, <i>him</i>. A sudden wave of curiosity overtook him: where <i>did</i> those without a place go to? He knew what his answer would be, but his circumstances were hardly normal. With that reasoning in mind, he silently left his hiding place and followed the young Absol’s trail, taking care to remain unseen and unheard. <br><br>---<br><br>She stopped her frantic race at the base of a tall tree and had tucked herself into a shallow hole by the roots. She sobbed quietly as she fearfully looked around at the sights and noises of the outside world. It was overwhelming: she had barely hatched when she was given a name— ‘Luna’— and her trainer had started studying her profile on their strange tablet-thing. The trainer looked at her, then at her profile, then back at her before going to the Pokémon Centre and releasing her into the wild.<br><br>Luna didn’t understand. What had she done wrong? Why was this happening to her? What had she done to deserve this? She felt the tears well up in her eyes and buried her face in her forepaws again. She wept for several silent minutes before she noticed another presence near her. A Zoroark had sat down next to her and was busy braiding several long pieces of grass together, weaving a few wildflowers into the design as he worked with his claws. Luna studied the newcomer closely. He wore a strange contraption on his snout: two circular pieces of transparent material framed by gold. He was clad in a large cloak that seemed to blend into the landscape and wore a vest that held several things in bulging pouches. He turned to look at her— Luna recoiled in fright but the stranger’s smile made her stop. He glanced back at his work and tied the two ends together, forming a little crown with the braided grass. With utmost delicacy, he placed the crown on Luna’s head and admired his handiwork. <br><br>The Absol looked up at him in wonder. “Are you my father?” she asked.<br><br>The Zoroark grimaced and briefly looked away before slowly shaking his head. He tucked his arms under his cloak and seemed to be debating something. Luna rose and took a step towards him. “Can I stay with you?” she said.<br><br>This question seemed to cause great distress with the older Pokémon. His grimace deepened and he removed his pince-nez, looking up at the sky as if it would give him answers. Again, Luna moved forward. “I think you’re nice,” she said softly. <br><br>He audibly sniffled at the comment and his eyes grew misty. Slowly— very slowly— he nodded. Luna padded over to him and looked at his teary face. This was a strange, strange ‘mon, but for some reason she felt safe with him. She settled in next to him and rested her head against his cloak. <br><br>---<br><br>And so they left, headed towards a new beginning for both of them. <br><br><br>((Not quite a puppy-- please forgive my liberal interpretation of the prompt.))</p>

But he&#39;s cute, and I think we can hold on to him until we find someone who wants to take him in.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think that would be a reasonable solution.

            <p>Apecian looked down at the puppy in front of him. It was absolutely adorable. He couldn&#39;t tell what breed it was, but he knew it was perfect. &quot;Awww,&quot; he cooed. He scratched the puppy behind the ears. &quot;Who&#39;s a cute puppy? Who&#39;s a cute puppy? Are you a cute puppy? Yes you are! Yes you are!&quot; The puppy&#39;s tongue slipped out of its mouth, and it rolled onto its belly, clearly asking for a belly rub. Apecian happily obliged. &quot;Isn&#39;t he the cutest?&quot; he asked his partner.<br><br>&quot;Apecian,&quot; Michael sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t think we can take care of a puppy. Besides, we already have Ron and Mayuku. Do we really need another pet?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Please,&quot; Apecian begged, looking up and trying to make his eyes wider. It didn&#39;t really work.<br><br>&quot;No.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, come on! I promise, this is the last pet, and I&#39;ll take care of him!&quot; Michael considered it for a moment.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ll feed him?&quot; he asked.<br><br>&quot;Yup!&quot;<br><br>&quot;And teach him to use Ron&#39;s box?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course!&quot;<br><br>&quot;And pick up after him when he forgets?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh huh!&quot;<br><br>&quot;And make sure he doesn&#39;t chew up my books?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah!&quot; Apecian said eagerly. Michael sighed.<br><br>&quot;Alright, you&#39;ve got a month. If you can prove to me you can take care of him by yourself for that long, you can keep him.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Woo hoo!&quot; Apecian cheered. He picked up the puppy carefully, and started scratching behind its ears again. &quot;Aren&#39;t you just the cutest? Yes you are! Yes you are! You&#39;re gonna come live with us now, okay?&quot; The puppy yipped. &quot;I know! You&#39;ll love it. We&#39;ll give you food, and you can sleep in my bed, and- oh! You need a name. How about... Socrates?&quot; The newly dubbed Socrates yipped again. Apecian smiled and kept scratching as he followed his partner to the next scene.</p>

            <p>Wait, I don’t actually need that anymore. I got Permission now and can write them whenever I want to. Still, it’s a challenge, so here we go. (You may want to read <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=302625;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this</a> first.)<br> <hr>
<br>Increasing hunger is not a good distraction when one tries to find the cafeteria; it had delayed them further, making their hunger increase even more in an endless loop. Only when they had started to discuss recent developments in the Potterverse, they had suddenly found themselves in a large room full of tables and chairs, with a counter and some vending machines on one side. Hieronymus still wondered how he had not noticed passing a door, but a door was certainly there, since he had nearly been thrown out through it by a horde of angry agents when he had tried to jump the queue. After going through all this, Hieronymus was quite impatient when Androia, who had sneakily moved forward while half of the agents who had been in the queue were occupied elsewhere, finally put two dishes on the table. He grabbed the fork, but then he started. <br><br>&quot;Are you sure that this is meatballs with mixed vegetables?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; said Androia, taking the seat next to him. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;<br><br>&quot;’cause it’s moving.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Really? Mine only moves when I stir it.&quot; Androia stirred the food with her spoon to demonstrate the effect.<br><br>Hieronymus watched his dish suspiciously. &quot;I hope this isn’t another meatloaf incident.&quot; He poked the vegetables with his fork. &quot;What the F–&quot; <br><br>&quot;Watch your language! &quot;<br><br>&quot;–lying Featherduster is that?!&quot;<br><br>A pair of triangular, furry ears peaked out between the broccoli, and a pair of wide, dark eyes lured form under the cabbage.<br><br>&quot;Awww,&quot; cooed Androia and reached out to shift the vegetables aside and scratch the tiny head. &quot;Who&#39;s a cute kitten? Who&#39;s a cute kitten? Are you a cute kitten? Yes you are! Yes you are!&quot;<br><br>The kitten sneezed and shook off the carrots and cauliflower. Hieronymus glared at the mess on the table.<br><br>&quot;Isn&#39;t it the cutest?&quot; Androia asked her partner.<br><br>Hieronymus frowned at her. &quot;Who are you, and what have you done with Androia?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, I am trying to develop some personality traits. At home, I was never allowed to do that. It was all running and fighting and casting spells, and the occasional flower-picking to gain proficiency.&quot;<br><br><i>Oh, crap. That’s what happens if you don’t keep your Player Character on a short leash.</i><br><br>Androia picked up the kitten carefully, and started scratching behind its ears again. &quot;Aren&#39;t you just the cutest? Yes you are! Yes you are! You&#39;re gonna come live with us now, okay?&quot; The kitten purred. &quot;I know! You&#39;ll love it. We&#39;ll give you food, and you can sleep in my bed, and – oh! You need a name.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Look,&quot; said Hieronymus carefully, &quot;we can’t keep it. Seeing how we always skip months of HQ time while we are on a mission, who should be in charge of its litter box?&quot;<br><br>At another table, Apecian nudged his partner. &quot;Did you hear that? This plagiarizing b–&quot;<br><br>&quot;Stop!&quot; Michael interrupted. &quot;Give her some slack, she’s still learning.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But that plagiarizing beast took all my words to put them in the night elf’s mouth!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, that you meant. So you think it’s a copycat, then?”<br><hr>

            <p>Apecian, don&#39;t you know imitation is the sincerest form of flattery? And flattered I am! And it was funny, too. Quite wonderful. I especially liked it when the agents interrupt each other in the middle of words that aren&#39;t actually curses.

            <p>This got long, folks.  I&#39;m not even sure it will fit in a single post, and I don&#39;t know what happens when it doesn&#39;t.  It got long enough that I probably should have gotten a beta for it, but I want to hit as many of these prompts before the thread falls off the front page as possible.<br><br>I also know this is throwing a lot of new characters at you all.  I&#39;ve tried to balance explaining a bit about them without bogging down the pacing.  I&#39;ll be making a separate story eventually about Millie/Mollie and Olsen/Ollie adjusting to life in the Nursery that will hopefully flesh out the other kids better.  For now, enjoy my token single story of the year!<br><br>&quot;Fake-A-Wish Foundation&quot;
<br><br><b>Sunday</b><br>&quot;So . . . this clearly doesn&#39;t have an actual plot.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Laquisha.  &quot;It&#39;s super-fun, though!&quot;<br><br>Mollie and Ollie exchanged a glance.  Ollie asked, &quot;But . . . aren&#39;t we supposed to be learning new canons?&quot;<br><br>&quot;This is a canon!&quot; Laquisha protested as her Lucina launched Mollie&#39;s Villager off screen.  &quot;Agents have done <i>Smash Bros.</i> missions, I swear!  I can pull some mission reports off the net if you want.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s all right,&quot; Mollie said.  &quot;Just—&quot;<br><br>&quot;Relaaaaaaax, girl,&quot; Laquisha interrupted.  &quot;It&#39;s the weekend.  That means—&quot;<br><br>She cut off as a ghostly wail sounded around them.  An orange figure flew through the door to Mollie&#39;s room.  It had large, exaggerated facial features, turned down into a heavily pronounced frown, and a swirling hairdo that pointed upwards.  Its torso trailed off into a little wisp at the end.<br><br>Mollie and Ollie ducked down against the floor, but Laquisha just said, &quot;Time?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yup!&quot; replied the orange figure.<br><br>&quot;I wish for a mozzarella-flavored lollipop.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Done!&quot; the floating creature replied happily.<br><br>A whitish lollipop appeared in midair next to Laquisha, who grabbed it and popped it straight into her mouth.<br><br>The ghostly figure, who was now the same off-white color as the sucker, clasped his hands and said, &quot;Thank you!&quot;  Then he sank through the floor.<br><br>Mollie and Ollie stared at Laquisha as she swirled the lollipop around in her mouth.  She stared back for a few seconds, then finally relented.  &quot;His name is Banda.  He&#39;s a genie—Augh, I mean jinn.  Grants one wish a day.&quot;<br><br>The new kids sat up straighter.  &quot;Any wish?&quot; Ollie whispered reverently.<br><br>Laquisha glared.  &quot;It&#39;s not for fun.  Banda hurts until he grants the wish.&quot;<br><br>The pair shrank a bit.  &quot;Oh,&quot; muttered Ollie.<br><br>Mollie asked, &quot;But why mozzarella?&quot;<br><br>Laquisha raised her eyebrows.  &quot;Because it tastes good?  Obviously.  Pick up your dang controllers, I&#39;m unpausing in three, two . . .&quot;<br><br><b>Monday</b><br>&quot;Yikes,&quot; Mollie said as she left the classroom.  &quot;An essay on how the Mane Six&#39;s personality traits match up to their Elements of Harmony?  This is going to take all afternoon.&quot;  She marched along between Ollie and Laquisha through the corridors of the Nursery&#39;s classrooms hallway.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t forget the extra credit question about Spike!&quot; Laquisha chimed in.<br><br>Ollie scoffed.  &quot;There&#39;s no way I&#39;m spending time on—&quot;<br><br>&quot;I always do the extra credit!&quot; Laquisha continued.  &quot;It&#39;s fun.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good for you, Hermione!&quot; Mollie teased.<br><br>&quot;Psh.  Hermione&#39;s got nothing on me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wish!&quot; came a cry from a side hall.  Banda flew around the corner, still white like the previous day.  &quot;Someone wish something!&quot;<br><br>Laquisha tapped Mollie on the shoulder.  &quot;Go.&quot;<br><br>Mollie froze.  She stared at the jinn for a moment, then realized he was clutching at his stomach.  She blurted out, &quot;Uh, I wish for a, uh, a, hot dog?&quot;<br><br>“Done!”<br><br>A hot dog appeared before her, sans bun or any condiments.  She grabbed for it, but jerked her hand away as the meat burned her a bit.  She fanned her hand as the hot dog fell to the ground.<br><br>Banda, now a pinkish-brown color, frowned.  &quot;A thousand pardons!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t apologize, honey,&quot; Laquisha said gently, then turned to Mollie.  &quot;Need to be specific.  Banda doesn&#39;t control the wish, he just lets it happen.&quot;<br><br>Mollie noticed Banda&#39;s gaze drop to his right wrist, and the stamped gold circlet around it.<br><br><b>Tuesday</b><br>“What do you think?”<br><br>“Still reading.”  Marty flipped to the next page of Ollie’s essay.  “It’s good so far.”<br><br>“Just good?”<br><br>Marty glanced up briefly.  “It’s homework.  It’s never as good as when we’re writing something for fun.  But it’s good so far.  No worries.”<br><br>“Mm.  Yeah.”  Ollie put his head in his hands.  “Sorry.”<br><br>Marty shrugged.<br><br>There were still a few minutes left before class would start. Although Professor Beans hadn’t shown up yet.  Another group of their classmates trickled through the door, chatting.  Banda floated in the air above the heavily dressed Riso and Edwin, the little rolling robot.  Ollie waved to them as they all moved to their usual places, still talking.<br><br>Suddenly, Banda went ramrod straight, then hugged himself, making a slight “urgh” noise.  Ollie felt Marty’s fist pound into his shoulder.  “Go.”<br><br>Ollie straightened up.  &quot;I wish for a soda.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Done!&quot;<br><br>A green and pink metal can popped into existence on Ollie’s desk.  He picked it up and read the name.  “Slurm?”<br><br><i>I think not.</i>  A slim, leafy vine snaked around the can and pulled it away.  Professor Beans lobbed it through the portal it had just used to enter the classroom.  <i>I’m told it’s highly addictive!</i><br><br>Marty pointed in Ollie’s face.  “Specific.”<br><br><b>Wednesday</b><br>Ollie chewed.  “Wow.”  He chewed some more.  “Wow,” he said again.  “This is so much worse than I even imagined.”  He pulled a white chunk out of his mouth.  “Why is there cartilage in this cabbage sandwich?”  He let it drop into the pile of grey film the bluish bread of his sandwich had left on the tray.<br><br>“And the grown-ups actually eat here?  Every day?”<br><br>“Shush!” Anne whispered.  “We don’t need the agents finding out about the secret good food in the Nursery.”  Anne was a middle eastern girl who kept her black hair short and really liked wearing denim.<br><br>“And keep in mind,” Riso added, “the smell’s not usually <i>this</i> bad.”  After the kids had sat down, a hulking, demonic agent dripping with yellowish fluids had arrived and claimed the table directly behind them.<br><br>“It’s not exactly helping,” Ollie admitted, forcing down another bite.<br><br>“So, um, with Banda . . .” Mollie began.<br><br>“Ugh,” said Riso.<br><br>“Newbies always get so hung up on that.”<br><br>Mollie plunged forward anyway.  “It seems like no one ever wishes . . . big?”<br><br>Anne and Riso sighed.  Anne fixed Mollie with a hard stare.  “You’ve already seen how it is.  The wishes don’t always come out right.  It’s King Solomon’s fault.”<br><br>Riso corrected, “Suleiman the Great.  Banda’s magic isn’t supposed to be used like this.  Suleiman enslaved all the spirits in his empire to serve people.”<br><br>“Typical grown-up,” Anne muttered.<br><br>“It’s not that Banda is screwing things up on purpose.  The magic itself is fighting back against being forced to do things the wrong way.”<br><br>“And the bigger the wish, the bigger the screw-up.  Banda feels awful when he messes things up, so there’s no reason to make things harder on him and risk causing a big problem.  And if you really have to go for it for some reason, you have to be a total lawyer about it.”<br><br>A Slurm-green figure rose up through the table.  “Sorry to interrupt . . .”<br><br>Anne leaned in close to Banda and whispered, “I wish for this agent—”  She pointed directly to the demon.  “—to have a smell that smells good to the majority of human noises until he leaves the Cafeteria.”<br><br>Banda grinned.  “Done!”<br><br>Behind them, Agent Chliever raised a pulsating arm and sniffed under it.  “Ugh,” he growled, “better get that checked out.”<br><br>The human students all inhaled, then sighed in relief.  Anne said, “Banda, thank you.  That was perfect!”<br><br>Banda, now unfortunately the same color as the demon agent, moved into a reclining position in midair.  “I have my moments.”<br><br><b>Thursday</b><br>For P.E. that day the class split into two teams of seven to play baseball in the Miss Cam Courtyard.  Edwin sat out, due to its inability to roll fast enough to participate, but robots don’t need exercise anyway.  Alfajiri, having no hands, remained in the outfield all game and played against whatever team was batting at the time.<br><br>Up to bat, Mollie talked quietly to Fox, who stood behind her as catcher.  “So, Banda . . . his wish thing goes off a different time every day?”  She let Anne’s pitch fly past, and heard Fox shift as he caught the ball.<br><br>“Ball one!” called Who.<br><br>“Um.  I guess?” Fox said quietly as he returned the ball to Anne.  “I mean, if you’re still trying to measure time . . . don’t try measuring time.”<br><br>From the outfield, Harry called, “So if I catch the old bally baller, I brosat to Who?”<br><br>“It stopped being funny the first class period, Harry,” Anne called over her shoulder.  She threw again.<br><br>Mollie hit it this time, and the ball headed for the left side of the outfield.  Banda floated over the ground towards it, with Harry and Alfajiri heading the same way.<br><br>“I’ve got it!” the jinn yelled.  “I’ve goooaugh!”  He clutched at his head, and the ball passed straight through him.<br><br>Alfajiri brought all four legs to a skidding halt.  “Wish time?  I’m hungry!  I wish for a zebra!”  Then Harry slammed into the young spotted hyena, leaving them both prone on the ground as a striped unicorn with a scraggly black beard appeared next to them, towering over them.<br><br>Who called out to the Courtyard, “Someone contact the Waterlily Commander!”<br><br>Harry swore as the zebra unicorn raised up and on its hind legs, but Marty suddenly appeared out of nowhere and yanked both his classmates away with a savage twisting motion, leaving the unicorn to stomp down on empty grassland.  It gave a high, yelping cry and pointed its horn at the three students.  It started to charge just before a pair of snow wolves crashed into it from the side, latching onto its neck and hind leg.  The unicorn stumbled, then turned its horn towards the side of attack.<br><br>“Now, sisters!  Strike at the exposed flank!”  Five small, bronze wolves ran in from the other side and got between the unicorn’s legs, biting into its stomach.<br><br>Alfajiri was giggling.  “Yeah, yeah, a hunt a hunt!”  He ran forward to join roman’s pack<br><br>Mollie had been watching over Anne’s head, but suddenly realized the other girl was giving her a hard look.<br><br><b>Friday</b><br>“Now then, let’s have a bit of a review from last week,” said the male copy of Professor Vector who had been recruited from the Rose Potter missions.  “What is the one number you can never divide with?”<br><br>“Zero!” Laquisha blurted out.<br><br>“Correct!  Incidentally, you also can’t divide by skadzz, but most universes haven’t discovered that number yet.  We won’t be covering it for several years.  Now.”  Vector wrote “1/0” as a fraction on the whiteboard.  “In World One, it was Brahmagupta who first examined the concept of dividing by zero, though of course the wizarding world had a for more complex understanding centuries earlier, thanks to arithmancy . . . how curious . . .”  He leaned closer to the whiteboard, where a tiny dot had appeared in the middle of the “0” he had drawn.<br><br>Banda dropped his pencil and grabbed one zebra-striped hand with the other, wincing.<br><br>“All right, keep all your rots closed,” Harry yelled, leaping from his seat.  “It’s my turn, and I’m like wishing for Superman and Goku to reenact their Death Battle right here in the skolliwoll!”<br><br>Meanwhile, Professor Vector was distracted watching the hole on the board slowly widen.  He gently felt the edge of the opening with one finger, which was promptly sucked into it up to the knuckle.  “Oh, Merlin.”<br><br>Laquisha slammed her pencil down and stood up, glaring at Harry.  “That.  Isn’t.  FUNNY.  Make a real wish.  Now.”<br><br>Harry smiled smugly.  “Make me, little kisa.”<br><br>Laquisha stepped around her desk to stand over him, and Harry returned her glare.  She quietly said, “You know that wish won’t work.  He can’t pull main characters out of their worlds.  Make a real wish.”<br><br>Harry blew a raspberry.  “You all assume like, but we haven’t tried everything.  Maybe a great, bolshy wish takes a while longer.  Shall we have ourselves a little nokky?”<br><br>Vector’s hand was now up to the wrist in the slowly spreading hole.  He held his wand awkwardly in his other hand.  “<i>Carpe retractum</i>!”  A rope slithered out of his wand, but was sucked all the way into the hole like a wet noodle.  He stared for a moment.  “<i>Finite Incantatem</i>?”  He aimed at his wrist.  “<i>Accio hand</i>!  <i>Impedimenta</i>! . . . Ow.”<br><br>“Banda is <i>hurting</i>.”<br><br>Harry shrugged.  “I’m not.”  He smiled and folded his arms behind his head, leaning back.<br><br>The jinn held his hurting hand in close to his stomach, and tears dripped from his eyes as he looked from Laquisha to Harry.<br><br>Marty started to say, “I wish—”<br><br>“NO.”  Laquisha’s gaze never left Harry’s face.  “Harry will do it.”<br><br>“Aaauugh!” Professor Vector cried.  His entire shoulder had sunk into the whiteboard, and the edges were straining against his neck and ribcage.  He had dropped his wand in favor of pressing his hand against the board, trying to shove himself out of the ever-widening hole.  He cried, “I wish this wasn’t happening!”<br><br>“Done!” Banda cried desperately.<br><br>Professor Vector fell to the floor.  The hole disappeared.  He stiffly got to his feet and said, “And to, er, to summarize, it’s an . . . <i>exceedingly</i> poor idea to divide by zero.  Er, yes.”  He took in the shocked expressions of his students, and the very perturbed looks worn by Laquisha and Harry.  “Oh, there’s no need to be upset, children!  See: I’m perfectly fine!”<br><br><b>Saturday</b><br>From their seat on a couch, Mollie and Ollie watched across the main Nursery room as Laquisha talked to Banda.  She was in tears, and Banda was holding her shoulders, looking down with a look of pity.<br><br>Eventually, Laquisha gave Banda a sad smile and left for the girls’ dorms.  The jinn began to float away through the crowd of children.<br><br>Mollie and Ollie looked at each other for a second.  Then Mollie called, “Hey, Banda!”<br><br>Banda heard and peered at them, then floated closer.  Once he reached them, he said, “Greetings, new classmates!”<br><br>“Hello,” Ollie said, awkwardly.  “Um, have a seat?”<br><br>“Surely,” said Banda.  His wisp trail immediately popped into a pair of legs, which were white with math equations all over, like the rest of him.  He floated down gently into a reclining position on the cushions between the human kids, who giggled.<br><br>“I didn’t know you could do that!” Mollie said.<br><br>Banda shrugged.  &quot;We haven’t really had a chance to speak before, no?”<br><br>“No,” Mollie admitted.  She cleared her throat.  “So, how . . . have you been?”<br><br>Banda didn’t answer immediately.  He stared at the coffee table in front of the couch for a few moments.  Eventually, he just said, “I am well.”<br><br>“Mmm.”  Now Ollie cleared his throat.  “So, um, Mollie and I wanted to ask—”<br><br>“You have a wish,” Banda stated, not looking at either of them.<br><br>“Well, kind of,” Mollie said.  She took Banda’s hand.  “We wish . . . we could get to know you better . . . and be your friends?<br><br>Banda raised his eyebrows and look both kids in the eyes, one after the other.<br><br>Then, he smiled.<br><br>&quot;Done.&quot;</p>

Agent Kebrdå used to be proud of feeling things more strongly than other people. Ey felt as if ey had access to a higher plane of understanding. Why wasn&#39;t everyone else crying at the end of &quot;A Rambunctious Animal Travel&quot; [rough translation from Eastern Venusian]? They must be missing out on something. But right now, if Kebrdå had one wish, ey would get rid of all that just to not be paralyzed in the center of the Cafeteria, crying over a spilled and broken bowlful of enchiladas and a spinning salad dressing bottle. </p>

            <p>how the addition of the salad dressing bottle, and the fact that it&#39;s sort&#39;ve forlornly spinning around, dripping ranch, makes it all seem so much more sad, y&#39;know?

            <p>Gaspard turned the cube over in his hands, studying the intricate carvings inlaid on five of the faces and the ornate ruby with the immaculately polished facets on the sixth. He looked at the cloaked figure in front of him. <br><br>“One wish?” he said. <br><br>“Only one,” said the man. “Say it aloud and press the button.”<br><br>“And this works?” said Gaspard, placing the cube button-up on the table in front of him. “Just like magic?”<br><br>“It <i>is</i> magic,” said the man, crossing his arms. “Go on. Make a wish.”<br><br>Gaspard looked back at the cube. There were a lot of things he wished for-- an end to war or to disease or to unhappiness. Or perhaps food for everyone on Earth or even--<br><br>The cloaked man leaned in. “You can be selfish, too,” he said simply. <br><br>Gaspard leaned back a little, wondering if this man was able to read minds. His gaze fell upon the cube again as he wondered-- what would make him happy?<br><br>“I... I’m not worth spending a wish on,” he said slowly. “I’m not the smartest or kindest or wisest person here-- there must be someone better qualified than me to be entrusted with a wish. I don’t deserve this.”<br><br>Even though the man’s face was obscured by his cowl, Gaspard could feel the disappointment in his eyes. “Are you sure?” he asked. <br><br>The Spy returned the gaze. “Give it to someone who really needs it.”<br><br>The man wordlessly pushed the cube back towards Gaspard, who seemed to recoil from it. “I’ll say it again. You are allowed to be selfish.”<br><br>Gaspard stared at the wish-cube in silence for a long few minutes. Then, ever so slowly, he raised his hand and placed it on the big red button. “I wish to not die alone,” he said in a tiny voice as he pressed the button. </p>

            <p>&quot;My heroes have to be Mary-Sues/Gary-Stus or they won&#39;t triumph over the villains!&quot;<br><br>If non Sue/Stu characters triumph over the villain, then it makes it all the more satisfying to read/watch.  When non Sue/Stu characters triumph, it&#39;s because they&#39;ve learned to overcome or cope with one of their weaknesses that was holding them back, or win by sheer luck, which makes it all the more believable as well.  But be careful you don&#39;t have them overcome all their weaknesses, because then they become Sues/Stus.  Plus, what if the characters don&#39;t triumph over the villain?  What if they lose once in a while?  A bit more interesting, don&#39;t you think?<br><br><br>&quot;My villains have to be Mary-Sues/Gary-Stus or my heroes defeating them won&#39;t be impressive!&quot;<br><br>While a stronger, perfect villain may be harder for your heroes to defeat, it doesn&#39;t make for an interesting villain, and villains can be plenty strong without being Sues or Stus.  If you don&#39;t give your villain any sort of relatable anything (i.e. Your villain abhors humans but can&#39;t stand to hurt fluffy bunnies), they will simply become a disgusting being that the heroes can throw rocks at.  While they may be evil, they&#39;re human (or orc, or elf, or snake-man, or Dalek) too, so they&#39;re going to have flaws.  Maybe your villain can&#39;t shut-up, and always gives away his plans, which are subject to change at the drop of a hat.  Or maybe he&#39;s so quiet, his minions never know exactly how to carry out his plans.  The possibilities are endless.</p>

            <p>Did the reviewer want you to volunteer to proofread before the story was published? That would make sense in that that&#39;s when beta-reading is supposed to happen, but unfortunately, unless you know the author personally, you&#39;d have to be psychic in order to know the fic needed help before you even saw it.<br><br>Or, did the reviewer want you to volunteer after it was published? That suggestion presumes that an author who apparently didn&#39;t seek beta-reading at the appropriate time will accept it after the fact because... reasons? Not saying it&#39;s impossible, but it&#39;s a bit of a stretch.<br><br>Either way, it&#39;s not anyone&#39;s responsibility to go around offering to beta for random strangers. It&#39;s the author&#39;s responsibility to make sure their work is in good shape before putting it out there for anyone to read and react to. Not that you shouldn&#39;t offer concrit or even editing if you feel so moved—that&#39;s a really great thing to do—but as the FAQ says somewhere, if it doesn&#39;t look like the author put any effort into making the story good to begin with, why should you put in the effort to write a thoughtful and detailed review that will be ignored at best or met with tantrums and flaming at worst? Writing a mission is at least entertaining and may benefit someone else who actually does care about learning to write better.<br><br>If you&#39;re worried about it, though, you might adopt Araeph&#39;s policy of reviewing a fic and seeing what happens before you spork it. If the author responds positively, great! You&#39;ve helped someone and improved the average quality of fanfiction. If they don&#39;t respond or if they get nasty, you can go ahead and spork their work with a clean conscience, knowing that attempting to be nice would be a waste of everyone&#39;s time.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Or Frequently Stated, in this case? I&#39;m not really in the loop, so I ask because I don&#39;t know. If you&#39;re proposing an addition to the FAQ, the addition should be, by definition, something that comes up a lot. If they do come up a lot, I&#39;d be curious to see some examples in context.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>There are plenty of ways to defeat a villain or challenge a hero without simply applying Suvian brute force to the issue.  In most canons, the heroes are victorious because they either struggle to gain the power necessary to win, or because they outwit a stronger opponent.  Similarly, while the villains are often dangerous not (just) because of superior power, but because of their cunning and ability to exploit the vulnerabilities of others.  Moreover, if your hero is so overpowered, how did the villain come to power in the first place (or if your villain is so overpowered, how will the heroes realistically defeat him)?<br><br>This argument is especially annoying in fanfiction; the heroes of Lord of the Rings, for example, were perfectly able to defeat Sauron without the aid of Marisuviel the elf wizard princess and her unicorn companion in canon. <br><br>It&#39;s also important to distinguish between powerful characters and Mary-Sues/Gary-Stus.  Being powerful is not enough to make a character a Sue - they must be powerful in uncanonical and/or Speshul ways, as well as possess other Suvian traits.  While some people misuse the term Sue by using it to refer to any character with significantly-above-average capabilities, that alone is not what makes them bad writing; they are bad writing because they do not behave and are not treated in ways that are realistic or sensible for the narrative.</p>
