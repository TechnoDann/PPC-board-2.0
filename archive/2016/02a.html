Dead Sea Scrolls is a strange, strange item. It basically gives you the activated effect of a random item each turn. This, understandably, makes it pretty powerful, and occasionally horrible when you get a turn of Ring Target or something. However, since there are a lot of Berries floating around, it can help you give Regigigas the recovery it needs to outlast Slow Start, one of the worst in the game. Regi&#39;s still vulnerable to phazing, so that sucks, but try a tanky set with Substitute, Drain Punch, Return, and Thunder Wave. But most importantly, have fun! =]</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got some goodfics to share with you! Some of these I haven&#39;t actually read all the way through yet, so they&#39;re on my &quot;reading list&quot; instead of my favorites/goodfic list. But here they are anyway! :D<br><br><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/1033680">&quot;Dreams of perfection! The wonders of the computer age&quot;</a> Sailor Moon/Welcome to Night Vale crossover. Yes. Good. I found this one through the blog &quot;The Josei Next Door&quot; and her Sailor Moon recaps. Go check her blog out if you love Sailor Moon, running crossover headcanon gags about Sailor Pluto, and crazy nicknames for everyone.<br><br>Two stories that I feel raised the bar if not for the entire fandom, then at least for my fanfic goals: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3550998/1/Fortitude">Fortitude</a> and <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/855528/chapters/1637607">Sansûkh</a>. Read them and be completely blown away by humanity&#39;s potential for awesome. <br><br><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23817/A-Brief-History-of-Equestria">A Brief History of Equestria</a>: Exactly what it says in the URL. There are some punctuation glitches, but it&#39;s really good at making Equestrian history as complex and interesting (and yes, violent) as World One history. Be sure to read the side stories as well!<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11526709/1/All-for-Family">All for Family</a>: A Pokemon trainer tries to handle life in his super-famous sister&#39;s shadow. I like stories about underdogs, and for some reason the first time I read this I thought it was going to be a Parody Sue story. Still nice and clever, though. :)</p>

            <p>So, has anyone seen the newest in the Arrow-Flash universe? The best I can describe it is <i>Doctor Who</i> meets <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> meets the cartoon <i>Time Squad</i>. And seeing as 2016 is going to be a Doctor-less year, I though I&#39;d give this one a chance... and I wasn&#39;t disappointed. Plus, it stars Arthur Darvill, or as we Whovians call him, Rory &quot;The Roman&quot; <s>Williams</s> Pond.</p>

            <p>I was pleasantly surprised. Still not over what happened in episode 2, though. God damn. Just when I was starting to like the character. Sara Lance still has my heart so that&#39;s one thing that hasn&#39;t changed haha! One thing I found funny about Arthur as Rip was that he (Arthur) said that he didn&#39;t want to star in another Sci-Fi thing but look at him, rocking the whole Time Master thing.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s hard to resist cracking jokes about how the Time Masters are totally not the Time Lords and <s>Rory</s> Rip Hunter is totally not the Doctor. *g* I mean, he&#39;s just a guy who stole a time ship from an elite council of time savants and is having wacky adventures with human companions to save Earth, right? They&#39;re nothing alike! {X D<br><br>But seriously, I am enjoying the show. The first episode in particular felt more like a movie than an episode, which is pretty cool.

            <p>A word of explanation: this story was <i>originally</i> written a month or two ago - before the whole &#39;Baron hS is going to totally change&#39; thing. I reworked it where it was no longer accurate, and kept it because... well, I think he <i>would</i> still go on insane secret adventures like this. But it&#39;s still rather more public than he&#39;ll probably be in the future.<br><br>(Also, what, Ye Scape-Grace doesn&#39;t believe him?

            <p>Lady Iximaz set down the scroll and dropped her head to her desk.<br><br>&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; Foon asked.<br><br>Lady Iximaz waved a hand at the letter. Foon hesitated, but picked it up and read it. His eyebrows rose. &quot;The Republic of Iric has... vanished?&quot; he said incredulously.<br><br>His sister nodded. &quot;And the only person who might have any idea as to the people&#39;s whereabouts is Baron Huinesoron,&quot; she said tiredly. She stood, tugged her jerkin back into place, and grabbed her travel-worn cloak from the back of her chair. &quot;Inform the castle staff that I am going to pay him a visit,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;But, Ix! You said you were taking time off from your crusades to heal and focus on managing your barony!&quot; Foon grabbed her arm. &quot;You can&#39;t go searching for the missing people!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Who said I was going to do that?&quot; Lady Iximaz said, narrowing her eyes.<br><br>&quot;You all but said it yourself!&quot; Foon tried to tug her back to her chair. &quot;This is foolish! How can you hope to accomplish this on your own?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t,&quot; she said simply. She pulled her arm away and left, taking up her bow and quiver as she left the room. Her sword was already strapped to her side.<br><br>She went to the stables and saddled her horse, mounted, and spurred it into an easy canter.<br><br>Perhaps Baron Huinesoron would be willing to give her some clearer answers. And, perhaps, if she was very lucky, he would be willing to assist her on her new quest.</p>

            <p>How is she going to find <i>him</i>? Per <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17DMWHSYkxzLuZ3UOGDhb2BEcl_WtVKt_UpjHM-Im_u0/pub">The Lost Baron</a>, Huinesoron is still mostly in the wind. He was in disguise at the <s>Hunger Games</s> tournament in Borrd, wandered into empty Iric, then showed up at a trade meeting, chucked a flag on the table, and promptly vanished again. He&#39;s certainly not in Kwenaya.<br><br>There is one logical way of tracking him down, but I&#39;m curious as to whether Lady Iximaz has noticed it. ;)<br><br>(Also - it&#39;s not <i>quite</i> as bad as she makes it sound.

            <p>First plan: Find Baroness Kaitlyn and see if she&#39;s willing and able to help. <br><br>Second plan: Go back to her keep and ask if Foon would be able to scry him. Not the best idea since scrying isn&#39;t his strong suit (the kid likes explosions), but it might work.<br><br>Third plan, if it doesn&#39;t: find a pattern to his alleged sightings and track him down from there. To me, it seems like he&#39;s been revisiting the past, so all she&#39;d have to do is drop by Baron Neshomeh at Weichi and ask for his history. From there it would be making a list of places he&#39;d be likely to visit next and camp one of them.</p>

            <p>I am not very good at introductions.  I found out about both the PPC and Fanfiction because of TV tropes.  I have lurked on the Wiki for a while.  I was developing a character to help explore different themes and mistakes in all writing when I discovered that she was a PPC agent.  I am introducing myself in hopes that I can eventually write her down.  Plus I read that at some point, authors need to actually interact with other authors about writing to improve.</p>

            <p>I have at least attempted to read the original series.  I read the constitution, but it is very long and my ability to remember what I read is about 10% of the details.  Is &quot;try not to be a jerk&quot; a good enough substitute for the constitution?<br><br>Listing just the recognizable books that I&#39;ve read feels like bragging.  Right now, I&#39;m slowing reading &quot;Return of the Shadow.&quot;  I love how Tolkien started writing &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; before he knew what the book was about because I do something similar.<br><br>My most-watched DVDs right now are probably Dollhouse, Pleasantville, and Rock of Ages.<br><br></p>

            <p>The only celebration where pigging out is allowed... required even! It&#39;s the last Thursday before Lent and the one thing that everyone associates with that day is <b>doughnuts</b>! There is a difference, however. Polish doughnuts are deep-fried balls of dough with filling.<br><br><img src="http://cdn6.urzadzamy.smcloud.net/s/photos/t/27679/paczki_1164667.jpg"><br><br><br>So, to celebrate, I&#39;m giving our virtual doughnuts!

            <p>Sometimes a combination of both.

            <p>Although that implies that they use sweet pickles, which, just, yuck, in my opinion. Pickles are supposed to be *sour*, no?<br><br>The white kind...hmm. Like cold potato, celery, tiny bits of crunchy sour pickles, and...a little bit creamy, I guess? Nothing in it is all that soft, but there&#39;s a bit of a cream taste to it from the mayonnaise or whatever it is.

            <p>So, a Blizzard illustrator - Even Amundsen - has created his own version of a Wizarding school. It&#39;s called <b>Vølurheim</b> (I don&#39;t know the exact meaning, unfortunately; all I know is that <i>heim</i> means &#39;world&#39;, or &#39;land&#39;) and it&#39;s settled in Scandinavia. Yes, we all know that Durmstrang Institute occupies that area, nonetheless it&#39;s a really cool headcanon.<br><br>So, here&#39;s the list of Vølurheim&#39;s staff, with short description from the author (at least in some of them):<br><br><a href="http://www.kawerna.pl/images/stories/ALLIMAGES/2016/luty/hp3.jpg">Torbjørn Jotunhorn</a> - The Headmaster<br><br><a href="http://www.kawerna.pl/images/stories/ALLIMAGES/2016/luty/hp1.jpg">Grimstav Draugsleiven</a> - Defence Against the Dark Arts<br>&quot;<i>Fearsome Professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts, and veteran warlock of the Troll Wars, Grimstav Draugsleiven. Being one of the few wizards to have closely befriended and studied dwarf kind and has many of his tales engraved on his body in the form of tattoos that have been magically imbued with runes of protection and power, making him a very powerful wizard indeed. Even though dignified and reserved most of the time, he will make settling grudges a point of honor, and when irked might throw his robes aside and appear as one sees him here, ready teach some life lessons.</i>&quot;<br><br><a href="http://pre13.deviantart.net/4af2/th/pre/i/2014/318/8/7/kari_sigfridsdottir_by_mischeviouslittleelf-d86dj3j.jpg">Kari “Mannevond” Sigfridsdottir</a> - Charms and Curses. Her nickname is Norwegian for &#39;vicious&#39;.<br><br><a href="http://www.kawerna.pl/images/stories/ALLIMAGES/2016/luty/hp4.jpg">Mumrikk Stigandur</a> - Herbology.<br>&quot;<i>He is a rather mellow type, a wanderer, thinker, a friend to the shy and the timid, and a true son of nature. Mumrikk Stigandur is the Professor of Herbology, when he is not wandering far and wide throughout the magical world. The design of this guy will probably be quite familiar to those of you who are fans of the Moomin series, as he is heavily inspired by the character Snufkin, who goes by Snusmumrikken in Norwegian.</i>&quot;<br><br><a href="http://www.kawerna.pl/images/stories/ALLIMAGES/2016/luty/hp5.jpg">Ragnhild Stubbemoen</a> - Dracology.<br>&quot;<i>Professor of Dragon Lore and Care, a specilaized class for senior students. Ragnhild Stubbemoen is a well known face in all circles where dragonlore is appreciated and is a world authority on the Norwegian Ridgeback. Ragnhild has held a teaching position at Vølurheim for an impressive 79 years and she is well known to get along better with her charges than with her students.</i>&quot;<br><br><a href="https://cdn2.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/001/675/366/large/even-amundsen-hulda-kvaenangsdottir-copy.jpg?1450639872">Hulda Kvænangsdottir</a> - Healing Arts.<br>&quot;<i>She is the Professor of the Healing Arts, and for advanced senior students she also teaches a course in Ancient Blood Magic. She is one of the best known hulders to live openly amongst humans, and while it is common amonst her kinsmen to have a hard time feeling at home, she has found her place by sheer will of force. Her fascination with the old magicks, and her belonging amongst the hulderfolk, has her sympathetic to trolls and tusser (nordic feral goblins) and has her in almost constant conflict with Professor Draugsleiven.</i>&quot;<br><br><a href="https://cdn0.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/000/482/648/large/even-amundsen-dagfinn-snauholt.jpg?1443927701">Dagfinn Snauholt</a> - Groundskeeper.<br>&quot;<i>This is Dagfinn Snauholt, Keeper of Keys and Lights at Vølurheim. He is the sole nisse</i> (benevolent imp) <i>on staff, and wages a never ending war against the mice that make the school their home, accompanied by his proud steed, Knerten.</i>&quot;</p>

            <p>Aya glanced warily at the tables inside Rudi's as she climbed on the stage. "Are you sure it is a good idea, Kuroko?"
Kuroko nodded. "Don't worry. I don't think anyone's going to do us any harm. I mean, they all knew for what they signed up... I think? Besides, if anyone tries anything I've got a <i>real</i> P90 this time."
Aya sighed. "That's <i>not</i> reassuring, Kuroko. I hope there'll be no bloodshed..."</p>

<p>"Welcome, everyone!" Aya said in the microphone, "Today we'll give someawards to the players that distinguished themselved during the third edition of the PPC HQ Hunger Games!"
"And the first one goes, obviously, to Lola McCandless, this season's champion!" Kuroko continued for her, "Lola, if you could please come on stage now..."</p>

            <p>Lola grinned out at the crowd. "There isn't much of a speech to give. Eight-day camping trip with a body count of forty-seven? Sounds about average for back home. Thanks for playing, vigilo confido, I'm gonna shut up and get ratted and so are all of you."</p>

<p>And she promptly sprinted off the stage as quickly as she'd bounced onto it, threading her way towards the bar via judicious use of an elbow. Her partner was there, staring at a measure of Bleepka in a crystal whiskey tumbler and looking rather morose.</p>

<p>"Why so glum, chum? You did really well. Like, <i>scarily</i> well, considering you didn't have your magic until, like, the last day or something. Have you been holding out on me?"</p>

<p>"Would that I had, Commander." Algie picked up the glass and held it to the light, inspecting it half-heartedly. "Alas, it is not my skills that have put me in this dudgeon, but my conduct. I was... I was quite mad, by the end. What can that poor woman think of me? What must Agent Library think? What vile things I have done, Commander."</p>

<p>"Algie, listen to me. I've seen people freak out in a warzone before. It's nothing to be ashamed of. You're going to move on, you're going to get the counselling you need, and you're going to get back to full readiness quick sharp. I'll see to it." Lola gave him a one-armed hug that required her to stand on the lower rung of his bar stool. "And that can be a direct order, if you want."</p>

<p>"I'd salute, but this is my eighth glass. I fear I would miss."</p>

<p>Lola raised an eyebrow at him. "Your eighth."</p>

<p>"Indeed. It is not so very strong, once one gets past the harshness of the taste. I recall meeting a Tartar in Rotherhithe who use to make it out of loganberries... though of course, I may be misremembering."</p>

<p>"Really. You might."</p>

<p>"Indeed. It may have been Peckham. Lilianna had business there... I... think... it does not matter. I shall pay it no further mind. Excuse me, madam, might I trouble you to furnish my partner with a round of Sex on the Beach?"</p>

<p>The barmaid gave him a cheeky grin. "Indeed you might, Mr. Wymbourne."</p>

<p>Lola was already in stitches.</p>

<p>"Excellent," replied Algie mildly. "And by way of recompense, two tickets and a hotel booking slip for a weekend in Margate."</p>

<p>It was at this point Lola fell over, for the first time that night and almost certainly not the last.</p>

            <p>"You're definitely XCOM trained," James said. He had pushed through to a clear patch of bar next to Algie and Lola while they were chatting. "I'm pretty sure bein' able to say something pithy and inspiring at any given moment was required for anyone lookin' to get to the highest ranks."</p>

<p>The bartender set down two glasses — one lowball glass quarter-filled with amber liquid, the other a pint filled with beer — down in front of James. He ignored them, instead offering his hand out to the fallen Lola in a gesture that was half-handshake, half-helping hand. "Name's James Pittman. Don't think we've gotten a proper introduction before now, Field Commander."</p>

            <p>Lola took his hand, got to her feet, and knocked back her cocktail in a swift and obviously practiced motion. "I... wasn't technically from the primary XCOM universe. My homefic was a Mega Crossover and to this <i>day</i> I have no idea how many canons were involved in it. DIC's refusing to touch it with a barge pole. Let's just say that we had Minerva McGonagall instructing the psionics trainees and our best Assault trooper was Buffy the friggin' Vampire Slayer. We won in the end, though, and that's what matters - hey, random change of subject were you from a 'verse with Long War's rules? Because that was <i>brutal</i>."</p>

<p>She smiled. "Lola McCandless, DIA. My partner Algie's the guy trying to beat his memories of being blown up into submission. Normally he sticks to port, but he's from Regency England, they drank like half a dozen Irish stereotypes on a stag weekend in Prague. Don't think I ran into you during the Games, which is a shame. Would've been nice to meet someone else from the Com there, but better late than never, right?"</p>

<p>Algie was content to offer a genial handshake to both of the James Pittmans, or possibly Pittmen, he could see.</p>

            <p>It took a moment due to Algie's general wobbliness, but they eventually got it done.</p>

<p>"Nice to properly meet you both," James said. "Even if we had met during the Games, it didn't strike me as the kind of place that fostered too much friendly banterin'.</p>

<p>"As for your initial question, I wasn't from Long War myself. I am familiar with it, though. Had a few Long War-focused missions. Right slice of hell even without the crossover stuff." He paused long enough to take a sip from his bourbon. "No, I was from an alternate version of what my partner refers to as the 'vanilla' timeline. No meld, no EXALT, just us little humans against the universe. I wish we had someone like Buffy on our side. Closest we got was this guy from Germany who thought the aliens sucked human blood." He smiled at the thought, but it faltered a bit as something occurred to him. "I fell out of the 'verse before I could see the end of the war. Found out later that things... didn't go very well."</p>

<p>James paused a moment, but then shook his head. "Ah, but that's the past. This is about the now, about celebratin' your victory and mournin' our failure. If me and my friends couldn't make it, I'm glad to see that someone else from the Com did." He offered his glass in toast. "To the champ."</p>

"Like last year," Aya continued for her, "the trophy is based on the most iconic happening of the season, and seems that the odd partnership between Corolla and Zeb caught the viewers' interest!"</p>

<p>The two hosts looked around, and noticed that most of the people at Rudi's wasn't very interestend in the ceremony at all.</p>

<p>"Well... I guess it's time to say bye to our viewers, isn't it?" Aya wondered.
"I think so. Thank you for watching!"</p>

<p>"I said I had to show you Rudi's someday, remember? Besides, it could be interesting to know more about these people without being worried about violence, right?" Richard said.</p>

<p>"Maybe. And I guess we could work with some of them too, if I got this right. Do they have good coffee here?"</p>

            <p>That was probably the best way to describe the demeanor over at the booth containing the members of what once had been District Cynic. The only person who didn't look slightly sour was Xericka, who still wore the same neutral expression that she almost always had. Even so, there was something in the set of her shoulders that gave off a little disappointment.</p>

<p>"Next to last on the district rankings," James said as he perused the final standings scorecards that had been handed out. "No individual agent ranked higher than 21st place. An average of one eliminated agent per day." He paused, then emptied his glass of bourbon. "Definitely not our best showing."</p>

<p>"No kidding," Laura groused. "I still can't believe that the two us — experienced Assassins! — got fewer combined kills than a single DBS agent. No offense, Gremlin."</p>

<p>Gremlin shrugged. "None taken. It's surprising to me, too. Although I should point out that one of those was a mercy kill."</p>

<p>"It seems that does not matter to whoever happened to score this event," Xericka added.</p>

<p>James peered over the sheet again. "Does anybody know why we were named District Cynic? Seems a bit out of place, if I do say so myself." There was a collective shrug from the other people sitting at the table. James responded with a shrug of his own before tossing the scorecard aside. "I'm going to get a fresh glass. Anybody want anything?"</p>

<p>"I could use another beer," Gremlin said.</p>

<p>"Can do. Anyone else?" The other two agents waved him off. "All right. Back in a second."</p>

            <p>They had gotten themselves cleaned up for the ceremony. It seemed the thing to do, and according to Gall, it was important not to show weakness to the enemy even in defeat. After a good night's sleep and a shave, with his hair tied back in a short ponytail, Derik looked almost handsome, at least from one side. Gall had left her helmet at home, but her armor was polished to a high gloss, and she'd taken the time to braid her hair more elaborately than usual.</p>

<p>They went first to the bar. They had priorities, after all.</p>

<p>Gall thumped the bar top with a begreaved fist. "A tankard of your finest mead, sir!" she called out. "For tonight, we feast!"</p>

<p>Rudi, by this time accustomed to her antics, rolled his eyes. "And you, Derik?"</p>

<p>"Redbreast, the twelve-year, please."</p>

<p>"Coming right up."</p>

<p>They watched Aya and Kuroko announce Lola's name, and their drinks arrived.</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said Gall. "Now then..." she looked around. "Aha, there's Gremlin. I'm gonna go hang. See ya!"</p>

<p>She bounded over to the booth, as much as one can bound in a crowded room while trying not to spill one's drink. "Hey, lady! 'Sup?"</p>

<p>The two DBS agents shifted down the booth seat to make just enough room for Gall to sit down. Laura eyed the new arrival from behind her sunglasses, but made no comment.</p>

<p>"We," Gremlin said, sweeping her arm in such a way as to encompass the three people still at the table, "have been mourning our performance in the games. Well, the Assassins have really done most of the mourning. I'm more disappointed that <i>we</i>—" she pointed between her and Gall, "—didn't get to meet up and fight everyone. Or each other."</p>

            <p>...three Spies sat together, nursing their drinks. They glanced up at the stage when Kuroko and Aya began to speak, then returned to their conversation.</p>

<p>"So, as I was saying, if it weren't for that flood, I could've easily won," said Harris, leaning back in his seat and crossing his arms over his chest. "You'd just have to lone wolf it from there. I mean, half of the time these people were getting backstabbed-- so the obvious safe route is to work alone."</p>

<p><i>Spoken like a true sociopath,</i> scribbled Tacitus in his notebook. <i>Yet another thing to add on your raging narcissism complex.</i> The Zorua pushed the notebook to the centre of the table for all to read.</p>

<p>"Why you--!" Harris shot a withering glance at Tacitus, who returned the look with a creepy smile that didn't reach his eyes. "Look who's talking, you creep. You're just mad because you got your head smashed in by Derik!"</p>

<p>Tacitus shrugged and returned to his doggie dish filled with Bleepka.</p>

<p>"Nah, Tacitus is right, man," said Yakov in between sips of his Firewhiskey. "You gotta team up to survive."</p>

<p>"Oh, sure," said Harris huffily. "And look at you: downed by Luxury and her canteen of Single Tears. Working in a group is an invitation to get backstabbed, I tell you. Lone wolf it-- it's better. And speaking of lone wolf..." he looked around. "Did anyone see Gaspard? I thought he'd be here."</p>

<p>Tacitus shrugged and Yakov said: "Iunno. Maybe he wants some alone time."</p>

<p>"His alone time is <i>all</i> the time," replied Harris. "Oh, wait. I see him. He's sitting alone at the counter. Geez, what a weirdo. Can't even sit and socialize properly, can he? I told him already-- I persuaded him to sign up for his own good! Fine, then. Stay in your corner. Have fun over there. Your friends are over here, if you're looking for them."</p>

<p>Yakov shrugged. "Well, if it's what he wants... I don't see why we should bother him."</p>

<p>Tacitus looked back and forth at his two colleagues. <i>I don't even think he has friends,</i> he thought to himself. <i>Not my problem, though.</i></p>

            <p>Derik had just shook his head and sipped his whiskey when his partner ran off. That was fine. He had people he wanted to talk to, as well.</p>

<p>Presently, he spotted one of them off in a corner with some other agents. The small grey Pokémon made for an unusual silhouette among humans.</p>

<p>Derik took a deep breath. This was perhaps the meeting he was most uneasy about, but for that reason, it was all the better to get it done sooner. He took another sip of his drink and made his way to the corner table.</p>

<p>"Excuse me... um, Tacitus, right?" He hadn't known the agent's name, but he'd learned it by checking the scores after the fact.</p>

            <p>The former Digidestined spoke to her partner, " You did pretty well in there, Henry. Second place and the same number of eliminations as the champion?  That was impressive, specially considering that we are just newbies around here." Suddenly, Aiko started to look a bit down. " I wish I could have done better. Fighting with a Flower over something and accepting "water" after the Arena was flooded weren't my brightest ideas. Should have realized that they would throw something like SIngle Tears in there." </p>

<p>Henry comfortly put his hand on his partner's shoulder and spoke sympathetically, " Hey, most of that wasn't your fault. I mean, maybe you shouldn't have stayed at the Cornucopia and fought with Captain Dandy, but there's no way you could have know the rest of that stuff. There's pretty of crazy, unpredicable stuff in the Hunger Games in canon, so don't sweat it. And from what you said, that Selene woman sounded way too convincing, right? " </p>

<p>Aiko smiled warmly in gratitude to her partner. " Thanks, Henry. So what do you wanna?  Do you want to go find us a table? " 
Henry smiled in returned and responded,  " Don't mention it. And well, I kinda want to find Sergio and his partner first. I'm not happy how things went with them inside that thing. I know that killing each other was the whole point of this, which is why I'm glad we didn't end up fighting each other, and those deaths were obviously just simulated, but I really didn't want to end up fighting either of them. So I feel I gotta say <i>something</i> to them."  With that said, Henry started to look around the room to see if Sergio and his partners were already there.</p>

            <p>then proceeded to walk to the table where he was seated. Once they got there, Henry smiled sheepishly at the veteran agent" Hey there, man. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry about how it went down there. I know that it was just a simulation and the whole was having agents kill each other, but I really didn't want to end up fighting or accidently taking out one of your partners. Still, if you want us to seat with you, I'll happily oblige you. " Henry took a seat opposite to Sergio and then motioned towards Aiko, who had taken a seat next to him. " This is my partner, Aiko Kimura. "  </p>

<p>A girl with long brown hair, sitting next to him, bowed slightly. "I'm Nikki. Nikki Cherryflower. You might've seen me around in the game, too... well, for very little. I didn't last a day before being ambushed. I guess I'm out of shape."</p>

<p>"Don't be so hard on yourself, it happens. I'm pretty surprised Rayson lasted more than the both of us, actually." said another girl. While she was currently human-sized, nearly everyone could still recognize her as Corolla. "By the way, Henry, it's fine. There's no need to apologize."</p>

<p>"Indeed," Sergio agreed, "It was just a game - a bloody and very realistic one, I have to admit - and you fought very well. Congratulations on your second place - you outlived, or even defeated some of the PPC's very best."</p>

<p>Sergio got up and walked over to Henry before giving him a pat on the shoulder. "That's something you can be proud of, and I don't think anyone's holging a grudge against you."</p>

Seems you guys were pretty amazing back when you were still active. And Sergio, you did pretty well in that fight we had. You're not half bad with a sword, I must say." He then offered a hand shake to Sergio.  </p>

<p>Aiko bowed slightly back at Nikki. " Well met, Nikki and Corolla. And well, I have to say I didn't do that well in there, either. Definitely shouldn't have accepted any water after they flooded the Arena. Glaurunging Single Tears ... Anyway, I heard about you guys too , but I have being around here for longer, growing up in the Nursery after being rescued from a badfic and all. You did quite a quite few missions into Card Captor Sakura and the Nanohaverse, didn't you? And into a few crossovers with Henry's home continuum, Harry Potter,  too, I think." </p>

<p>((Hardric, you can have Marina and Richard join them if you want. They were in the same District, after all, even if they didnt actually met in-game. Plus, we are going to do that co-write at some point, so it would be nice if the four of them actually meet beforehand.))  </p>

<p>Sergio nodded. "After the Blank Sprite Incident - I think you might've heard of that? - Nikki and I decided that we had enough fighting. Let's just say that the both of us had our fair share of battles even before joining the PPC. Now I'm a racing driver, and Nikki runs a café, but I think it is a good idea to still keep our combat skills honed - you never know what's going to happen in the future."</p>

Richard Legard, DMS, Freelance Division, and this is my partner, Marina Nicodelli," Richard said, pointing at his partner at the bar, before facing again Henry, Aiko and their companions.

Then I ended up in the Marquis' office, was sent to training, and began to discover this place. Guess I should have been more careful with reading things before accepting them.

            <p>how exactly agents that came from World One ended up in this place." Aiko responded cheerfully, " As for myself, i have a lot of history around here. Me and Anju, my Digipartner, got rescued from a Digimon AU badfic where we each the daughters of two canons. After that, we spent about six years growing up in the Nursery, where we eventually went through agent training before each us sadly went our separate ways. So that's how I ended up in Floaters, partnered with Henry." </p>

<p>At this point, Henry decided to chime in, " And I pretty much ended here throught a plot hole after the unfinished fic I came from got deleted. As a result I don't remember much of my life before I came here, just that I used to play as a Beater in the Gryffindor Quidditch team and that I came from a family of Healers. But because I had only gone throught basic training, I ended up in Floaters instead of Medical." </p>

<p>" Anyway, I think I will leave asking about your partner when she gets here, so for now, I will just ask these three, " Aiko said while turning her attention back to Sergio's group, " What about you? How did you all ended here? I have heard a lot about you guys, but I don't think I ever heard about details like that."</p>

I'm a 'Dresden Files' wizard, and my appartment and the office where I worked as a 'consultant' for the police were burned down by Fomors, who tracked me until I took a pretty crazy risk and ended up in this place.

            <p>"That must've been terrible, and... well, I think that was too much for a first mission. But... well, I don't think I had much better. Mine was a hurt/comfort rapefic with Sakura as the victim... not pretty, especially since that Sakura was around my age so she looked like me. I will never thank whoever invented Bleeprin enough."</p>

<p>"Mine was a Lyrical Nanoha one in which Shamal broke down and went on an amnesiac killing streak against some street thugs," Sergio recalled, "afterwards, when Signum got her to calm down rather intimately, the message that was passed was along the lines of 'oh, you killed some random people but now you calmed down so it's OK'. But, really, the truly scary thing that day was the fact that I had been parnered with Luxury for the mission. Luckily I didn't run into her at the Games."</p>

            <p>" apparently, the Suethor hated Rini so much for being a brat that they had Serena do ... Unspeakable things to her. I'm not gonna lie, she can be quite annoying sometimes, specially if we're talking her in the first anime, but how in the Dark Ocean could this person that could possibly justify ... THAT is still Glaurunging beyond me."  </p>

<p>She took a deep breath to try to calm herself down before continuing, " But yeah, at least Filicidal!Serena was pretty easy to take down. <i>Sailor Moon</i> characters have parts of their souls that can get taken out by villians and we basically exploited that to pretty much instantly kill her." </p>

<p>" As for your question, Bleeprin is a medicine made out of bleach and aspirin. We use it to erase scarring image caused by particularly awful badfics from our brains. You can take them in pills or combined with certain foods or drink, such as chocolate or non-alcoholic beverages, " At this point, Aiko got an odd expression, " though the latter still get people drunk, <i>somehow</i>. Anyway, Bleeprin is the reason why bleepfic are called that. They are badfics that are awful that they make you reach for excessive amounts of Bleeprin production to get rid of the horrifying mental images , but sometimes even that is not enough ... " </p>

<p>Henry scowled upon hearing Nikki and Sergio describe their respective first missions. " Seems that we weren't the only ones to have it pretty rough on our first mission, then. But seriously, why do they keep doing that? That can only lead to more agents going flamethrower more often and earlier. It doesn't make any Glaurunging sense!" </p>

<p>Aiko shuddered and gulp upon hearing the horrifying description. " Why would anyone do something like that? Triviliasing rape for the sake of cheap drama, not mention trivialising Glaurunging MASS MURDER! For Azulongmon's sake, why, just why!? Seriously, Shamal doing something so horrible is about as likely as Serena hating Rini to point that she would do such horrible things to her. They're two of the kindest canons in the multiverse, they would never do such a thing. Specially Serena after finding out that Rini is actually her daughtet, though she cared about her very much and did all she could to protect her even before anyone knew that."</p>

<p>"Well, as you said, we didn't need it, and dependance and overdose are pretty normal things when it comes to Bleeprin, and if you're unlucky, you will also have allergies. is that good enough for you?" Richard said.</p>

<p>Marina sipped her cup before answering, "The explanation is a decent one, so that will do. But I want sme tabs before we go for the next mission, understood? At least magic don't stop me from taking medications, I could as well profit from this."</p>

<p>"Alright," Richard said, still a bit shaken by the agents' discussion, "Why the magical girl shows attract people who think that's good fanfiction? And the Flowers have the nerve to say they select the missions to somewhat preserve our sanity."</p>

<p>Zeb frowned at him but turned his attention back to Yakov. "I'm... fine. Better than my partner, I think, though that's not really saying much. Um. Yeah. I'm fine. Why?"</p>

            <p>"And we were supposed to be a <i>team</i>," Morgan lamented, glowering at her drink. "But what happens? <i>She</i> -" She waved a hand in Selene's direction " - nicked my stuff, and when I teamed up with <i>you</i>, you got me killed against..." She looked around the bar. "Well, wherever she is. Lo-la." The last word came out in an off-key singsong voice.</p>

<p>Dafydd winced at the sound. "I don't know about that 'team' stuff," he said, ignoring his own (first) drink. "Agent Kaitlyn raided <i>my</i> belongings at least once. And then killed me."</p>

<p>"Heck <i>yeah</i> I did!" Kaitlyn called from the other side of the table. It was only three feet away, but that didn't dampen her enthusiasm. "Elf versus hobbit? Hobbit wins, pants down! Er, hands. Don't want to give Lux ideas."</p>

<p>Dafydd raised an eyebrow and turned it on Selene, as if to say, <i>THIS is your partner?</i></p>

<p>The vampire shrugged and drained her glass. "We may have been a <i>district</i>," she said, "but that didn't make us a <i>team</i>. There can only be one winner, after all." She chuckled dryly, tried to take a drink, and blinked at her glass in confusion. "And the member of District Huinesoron's-Not-In-This who came closest was the wannabe Hobbit. Who saw <i>that</i> coming? I need another drink."</p>

<p>"Me too," Morgan sighed, pushing her glass around the table. "Or three."</p>

<p>"No, <i>me</i> three." Kaitlyn hopped out of her seat and grabbed their glasses. "Backinasec!"</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>((I'm starting them all off in the same place. Feel free to peel one or more of them off, join the table, grab them when they wander off, or anything of the kind.))</p>

            <p>An enormous rattletrap conveyance juddered through the party at Rudi's. It looked like nothing so much as a small, fractal electricity pylon growing out of a digger chassis, and a small orangey-red ball was perched precariously on top at about head height. As it got closer to Not-Really-All-That-Much-Of-A-Team Huinesoronot-Appearing-In-This-Game (which was a bit of a mouthful even by German standards), it became clear that the ball on the top was a bowl. With a pink thing floating in it. Looking very, very happy.</p>

<p>This probably had something to do with the overpowering smell of Tequila Sunrise coming from the bowl, as well as the dinky little cocktail umbrella poking from the top.</p>

<p>"'lo," she said, stopping by her. She gave Dafydd and Selene a brief, albeit respectful, nod. She figured the sods got enough people fawning over them as it was; no sense in making a fuss. "Mind if I sit here?" the Aviator continued, mostly addressing Morgan.</p>

            <p>"T'ain't no charge for sitting." Morgan shuffled her chair to the side to make sure the Aviator had room.</p>

<p>"So," she said. "I picked up on... some of what was going on with you back in the Arena." She tapped the side of her head, remembering the psychic ripples that had been pouring off the Aviator in her last couple of days in the Game. "I know we're not exactly chums, but if you want to talk about it with someone who was in there too..."</p>

<p>She looked up and accepted her drink from Kaitlyn with a nod of thanks. "Or if you just want a drink," she said, taking a sip of it. "Nutmeg TV are paying. I'm not sure they <i>know</i> they're paying, but gun, etc."</p>

<p>((D'aww, she's putting on a not-a-misery face for Ave. Thaaaat won't last. ~hS))</p>

            <p>"Sorry about that," she said quietly. "I've... not had the best grasp on my mental shields for a while now. Still working on rebuilding them. And the drinks sound nice," she added with a bitter smile, "but I don't think Nutmeg TV would be too pleased at seeing my tab alone. I'll pay." She glanced up at the bar and decided she'd wait a bit until it was less busy.</p>

"I mean, I've spent the last week-ish running around betraying people I'd rather have worked with, and ended up getting killed by someone who-" She stopped, took a deep swig of the cocktail. "Well, whatever. I just... I feel a bit like, y'know... Rassilon. A bit."</p>

<p>She chuckled and glanced over her shoulder. "And I can't help but expect the Notary to show up and say that's a good thing... eh." She leant forward on the table. "But, look, I've not followed the papers, but even I know you've had a rough time of it lately. I have to ask: <i>why</i> did you volunteer to go into a killing ground?"</p>

            <p>The Aviator rubbed her forehead and sighed. "Zeb wanted to have a bit of a challenge, y'know? Opponents smarter than Sues who just stand around while you read the charge list. And my brother's been itching to go into the field at least once to see what it's like. He jumped at the idea when the Games were announced, and... I let them talk me into it." She sighed again. "Not ever doing that again, not in this regeneration."</p>

<p>Looking around, she saw the bar was beginning to get more crowded rather than less, so she stood up, said "'Scuse me," and went to get a drink. Several minutes passed and she returned with a glass smelling strongly of ethanol. "Right," she said, sitting back down and taking a large gulp, "Where were we again? Oh, yeah. the Games." One of the Aviator's eyebrows went up. "For all you're talking about how it shook me up, it's really nothing I haven't seen before. <i>You</i>, on the other hand, you look kinda upset. Want to talk about what happened, or...?"</p>

<p>The Time Lady paused, staring at her glass. "But if there <i>had</i> been a problem..." She grimaced. "Let's just say that I've regenerated twice in the PPC, and both times were <i>in the PPC</i> - right here in HQ. I wasn't too keen on the prospect of a third one, and it was so..."

"Not like anyone other than the Real Monitor has tried, I guess, and we all know what <i>they're</i> like."</p>

            <p>Morgan glanced around. The bar was crowded, of course, but most of the agents were absorbed in their own conversations (or drinks). Still... she leant forwards and lowered her voice. "It's just... how do you <i>do</i> it? How do you go through a warzone like that and not... I mean, and come out still... yourself, and okay, and not unable to sleep because of the nightmares?" She tried to take a drink, realised her glass was still empty, then put it down firmly and pressed her hand to the table to hide the shaking. "Y'know. As an academic interest. As it were."</p>

So I actually put it as #9 in the roster form for the Generator.<br><br>(Actually, I did change the placement of mine too. As I made the game, it should&#39;ve been the first team on roster, but for some reason I like the number 4 and so I put District Corolla as #4)</p>

            <p>That reason is to let people know the content rating of the story they are about to read. Should it be rated T, for Teen, one should expect, as laid out in the rating system used by FFN (link: <a href="http://www.fiction">www.fiction</a> ratings.com), any or all of &quot;some violence, minor coarse language, and minor suggestive adult themes&quot;. This is noted as &quot; suitable for teens, 13 years and older&quot;. You can read the rest yourself; be aware that FFN uses K, K+, T, and M, but *not* MA (although, to be fair, some posters do blur the lines a bit between M and MA. Many others, however, will post the MA/NC-17 scenes they write elsewhere, so as not to violate the terms of use).<br><br>The youngest age you can be in order to have an account on FanFiction.net is either twelve or thirteen. A four-year-old--and you&#39;re assuming a four-year-old who knows how to read pretty well, not to mention find the site and navigate it--well, even assuming a young child who&#39;s been shown the site or something, that child should either know or will quickly figure out that they should stick to the K or K+ rated stories, of which there are many.<br><br>In my experience, users of FFN read stories at a rating with which they are comfortable. The only main &#39;dangers&#39; are mis-rated stories or first-time users who haven&#39;t figured out the rating system yet (although, even then, M-rated stories are not displayed by default). To the first: I have every confidence that should Bramandin post this story on FFN, it will be correctly rated--or even overrated for safety, as is common practice. Should a reader too young for the themes find it, read it, and, of course, *understand* what it&#39;s getting at--and young readers miss many things that older readers get, due to the difference in life experience and so on--well, that would not be on the author, assuming the story was correctly rated and the trigger watching included in either the summary or an opening A/N.<br><br>FFN, and other sites, are filled with all sorts of stories. Some are good; some are thoughtful; some are bad; some are horrible. They come in many genres. This is no less true of children&#39;s shows--see My Little Pony for one example, or Kim Possible, or just about anything.<br><br>Also... I don&#39;t belieof that anyone, *ever* has sued a fanfic author for writing a story a little above the rating level of a person who read it, especially of their own free will. Moreover, the *only* thing Bramandin has warned for is &quot;off-screen child abuse&quot;. Trust me--there are much, much, *much* worse things that have been written about in both fanworks and original works. Honestly, from the information we have, I&#39;d expect this to be a thoughtful sort of piece, a different take on something or else a &#39;what if this character was confronted with this issue&#39;.<br><br>Also? As far as I remember, there&#39;s child abuse awareness stuff (campaigns or education or something?) going around, so as to teach kids to speak out about it. Assuming it&#39;s even more than a minor sort of thing in this piece, it would probably just feed into that, at most.<br><br>tl;dr: FFN, as well as most sites, has a rating system in place. It&#39;s linked above. Rating correctly is the responsibility of the author, and putting trigger warnings in is considered considerate everywhere. (Archive of Our Own even has those as warnings in the rating system). Reading at the appropriate level, however, is the responsibility of the reader and of the people around them--*not* the author. Bramandin&#39;s piece also does not seem to fit the category of &#39;absolutely traumatizing&#39;; moreover, Bramandin clearly knows what to warn for. Also, fanfic authors generally do *not* get sued for things like this; much more likely is, at most, publishing a fanfic as their own book without authorization or changing names, etc (ie, if EL James had published 50 Shades without changing the names and without getting Stephenie Meyer&#39;s permission to publish a Twilight tie-in or something).<br><br>In short: I see no problem here, nor, in fact, anything remotely unusual. I&#39;d also suggest actually reading the piece before condemning it; it really does not sound to me to be particularly traumatizing by most standards, and the author&#39;s comments seem to support that.<br><br>If you&#39;d like a run-down on AO3&#39;s rating system, I can do that. It&#39;s a similar sort of concept, but with different terms and with tags. Tumblr, meanwhile, has no rating system whatsoever, just the option to use tags and the stipulation that... 13, I believe, is the youngest age to have an account. FFN or AO3 is really a better bet, especially if you want to know the content rating quickly instead of guessing from the beginning or the tags--which won&#39;t always be there.<br><br>Also... Tumblr hosts stories, yes, but it&#39;s not a fanfic archive. That&#39;s not its official, main, or primary purpose. It doesn&#39;t really make as much sense to post stories exclusively to there.<br><br>And, right, I&#39;ll finish there. Apart from adding that I&#39;ve been with all of these sites I&#39;ve mentioned for a while: FFN since 2009, though I was reading there earlier; AO3 since at least a few years later; and Tumblr since 2011 or 2012 (probably 2012).<br><br>Thanks for reading.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I wasn&#39;t sure how safe it was to go into details here.  <br><br>Yes, the story is about the first time that Grover was involved with getting Child Protective Services called.  Rather, it&#39;s him talking to Herry about he wasn&#39;t sure what he heard.  The story doesn&#39;t have any details about the &quot;bad secret,&quot; but knowing that there are awareness campaigns targeted at kids might bring my story into a very low PG rating.

            <p>What would really be helpful is everything but the canon details.  Basically I&#39;d like someone to check if the idea is even salvageable first.

            <p>The main problem is that I&#39;m pretty busy right now. School is busy, as is placement, and I&#39;m already set to start a co-written mission, along with the stuff I&#39;m already working on. If no one else volunteers, and if there&#39;s a point when I get the free time, then I wouldn&#39;t mind; but I can&#39;t guarantee that that&#39;ll be anytime soon.

<li>My primary team is in Implausible Crossovers, but I kept running into Sues that annoyed me enough to want to kill. I didn&#39;t want to keep having to make up excuses for my DIC team to get Suefics, so I needed a team in the DMS.<br><br>2. To cover more of my favorite continua, with characters who feel as strongly as I do about them. Nume and Ilraen prefer certain flavors of fantasy and sci-fi, and neither of them has a musical bone in his body. If I wanted to deal with my favorite musicals, I needed other characters for that. (I still don&#39;t have anyone I&#39;d easily send into modern, more or less realistic settings like <i>Psych</i> or <i>NCIS</i>, but since I haven&#39;t seen any fics there I really want to PPC, either, that&#39;s been okay.)<br><br>3. To be able to tell different kinds of jokes than I can with Nume and Ilraen. They&#39;re both fairly serious, straight-faced people who don&#39;t use a lot of modern slang, so if I wanted to crack jokes based on Internet memes, or write about pranks pulled during a mission, I needed someone else for that.<br><br>Additionally, I dislike it when people recruit badfic characters and then don&#39;t do anything with them. Once I decided I was going to recruit Derik, there was no question that I was going to write about him, and he fit half of what I wanted to do as a storyteller. Earwig didn&#39;t work out for me, but then Gall came along, and thanks to her canon&#39;s tendency to be anachronistic, she fits the other half and also acts as a balance to Derik&#39;s overwhelming tendency to be angsty and grim (which is <i>not</i> how I set out to write him, but characters will do what they do). It&#39;s also good for me to have a female character besides Jenni.<br><br>As for who gets what mission, it&#39;s a simple question of a) is it a Suefic or a crossover? and b) would my characters know/care about the problems in it enough to have entertaining reactions?<br><br>I&#39;ve tried to alternate writing one DIC story, then one DMS story, etc., but it really just depends on what story I&#39;m feeling most strongly about at any given time.<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>1) They take turns, simple as that.<br><br>2) Same as the above, really. I do a mission with one team, then I do mission with the others and if I don&#39;t have a fic ready, I go dig one up. My first team used to be in Floaters and now they&#39;re in the Department of Improbabilities, so they can work a wide range of canons and badfic types.<br>My other team is still in Floaters, but I&#39;m making them do bad Harry Potter/Labyrinth crossovers, since that gets them both riled up.<br><br>3) MY first pair get along great, so after a few missions with them, I wanted a team that would bicker and fight all the time, just for variation.

            <p>Namely, one of my teams gets a little time in the spotlight for a given number of missions, and may or may not have a mini-story arc to go with it. Note of course that this primarily applies to solo-written missions, as my co-writes with others have so far not adhered to the same organization. Secondary RCs tend to have missions done sporadically or as supporting material for other teams, which is what I&#39;d recommend for people who haven&#39;t made the mistake I did of writing... *counts on fingers* three major teams (one of which I&#39;m planning to write an epilogue for in due course), one supporting team, and at least five other supporting characters who turn up here and there.<br><br>In light of this, having different teams be part of different departments is also helpful for organizing who gets what. To continue using my agents as examples: Rayner and E.V.L. take on fics that have a Suvian character and are part of only one fandom; Sarah, Cupid, and Lapis deal exclusively with crossovers; and Falchion, Rashida, and Ripper get... well, everything else.</p>

            <p>Carefully. <br><br>My personal advice is to hold off on writing another agent pair until you have an idea of what you&#39;re doing with your first set. <br><br>There&#39;s no need to have a dozen or more agents spread out throughout all the PPC and then basically render yourself unable to write anything because you can&#39;t decide. <br><br>That said, they also don&#39;t have to actually have their own spin-off. You can feature them in your main spinoff, interacting with your first two agents, or use them in RP, and so on. Or in stories set in HQ that aren&#39;t missions at all.<br><br>Right now I have a bunch of things in the works, spread out over a variety of characters- the thing is to make sure you keep focused on *something* so you have something to show for it, writing wise. <br><br>-July, productive lately</p>

            <p>As those of you who read my missions know, Za&#39;kiir will now and then speak in the language of the dragons of the video game &quot;Skyrim.&quot; (Don&#39;t worry, I have an explanation for how he learns it in the next upcoming mission, which hopefully will be finished soon.) What I want to know is, do you guys want me to give translations for what he says in footnotes, or would you rather have it be as it is to add a bit of mystery (or if you just want to go look up the meaning for yourselves for the fun of it)?</p>

            <p>However, they require different skills. I would normally just say &quot;Rule of Funny,&quot; but it&#39;s a bit more complicated than that. Normally, it would make more sense to just mention the language so that people are aware, but translate all dialogue, maybe with a transliterated accent – otherwise, it&#39;s difficult and obnoxious for the reader to follow. So I would say if you intend to translate, don&#39;t bother with footnotes. <br><br>But sometimes, IF you think it&#39;ll work in text, it can be more fun to leave that dialogue completely untranslated, and let the reader figure it out from context. An example, using my own agents:<br><br>&quot;I call this meeting to order,&quot; Mohan said, giving a meaningful look at his fellow Cafeteria workers. &quot;All present and accounted for?&quot;<br>&quot;Aye.&quot;<br>&quot;Rrrnn.&quot;<br>&quot;Good. First order of business– the Agents are complaining about the sentient mold demons in the soda machine again.&quot;<br>&quot;Nnngh ernch, ¥#%••§ warhesch,&quot; Jof replied. <br>Mohan suppressed a snort of laughter. &quot;Don&#39;t hold back, Jof. How do you really feel?&quot;<br>&quot;He&#39;s right,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;They&#39;re always complaining about something. If we get rid of the mold demons, they&#39;ll just start grousing about the arsenic on the silverware or something.&quot;<br><br>----<br><br>You see what I mean? A footnote would 1) break the flow of the text, and 2) be less funny than whatever the reader imagines. It&#39;s like the rule of horror movies. The more you leave to the imagination, the funnier it is. But if you think the dialogue is central enough that it needs to be translated, I would <i>strongly</i> recommend that you put the translations in-text. </p>

            <p>If you do want to denote that they&#39;re speaking in Dovah, definitely do not add parenthetical notes - those will break the text up even worse than a footnote. Just put the translated speech in italics. Somewhere in the text, add a line like &quot;He always had a little trouble understanding Zakiir&#39;s humor; the harsh accent of Dragon-speech didn&#39;t lend itself easily to sarcasm.&quot; Or something like that - it will flow much better than trying to translate every time and note it as such.

<li>If a character is going to use another language, they should have a good reason for doing so every time they do it. Don&#39;t chuck in bits of Dovahzul just to show that you can; Za&#39;kiir himself should have a reason to use it. (If <i>he&#39;s</i> just showing off, that&#39;s fine. If <i>you</i> are, it&#39;s not.)<br><br>2. If the audience is meant to know something, the author should make it plain. Don&#39;t use Dovahzul for important information. If Za&#39;kiir must be speaking it a lot for character or plot reasons, though, you can write the dialogue in English and let the narrative explain that he&#39;s not actually speaking English:<br><br>&quot;Blah blah blah,&quot; he said in Dovahzul.<br><br>3. If the meaning of a word or phrase in another language is plain given the context, there&#39;s no need to translate it. (And it&#39;s always a good idea to make sure the meaning of any piece of dialogue is plain by giving it proper context.)<br><br>4. If the audience is not meant to know the meaning of a word or phrase in another language, or can reasonably get by without knowing, there&#39;s no need to translate it.<br><br>5. If you must provide translations, either do so diegetically (i.e. as Dorano suggested, with further dialogue) or extradiegetically (with footnotes). Mixing the two with in-line author&#39;s notes breaks the reader&#39;s immersion in the story and is annoying. Diegetic is better than extradiegetic, since it involves less work for the reader.<br><br>TL;DR: Avoid the need for translations at all costs, unless you&#39;re going to work them seamlessly into the narrative. Otherwise they&#39;re just distracting.<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>If he talks like the Dovah themselves — ie, in a way that the Dovahzul is just added flavour — I think it&#39;s OK to leave it as-is. OTOH, if it&#39;s actually important for understanding what he says, use footnotes. In that case, though, use it sparingly because having to continuously refer to footnotes in order to understand a character&#39;s dialogue is a royal pain.</p>

            <p>Hey so 4 days ago, Greg Weisman (Young Justice&#39;s producer) teased that there could be some hope for Young Justice Season 3. The series is currently available in Netflix and on BluRay. So if the series gets enough attention, we could (quite possibly) get a Season 3. So yay! Booooooost!<br><br><a href="https://twitter.com/Greg_Weisman/status/694376322550726656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"><a href="https://twitter.com/Greg_Weisman/status/694376322550726656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">https://twitter.com/Greg_Weisman/status/694376322550726656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</a></a></p>

            <p>... was read the entirety of a person&#39;s mission output in a row. Everyone only had one set of agents, and most of them only did a couple of missions, so that was easy. (Dafydd and Selene had one of the biggest runs, for reference - and note that my other agents came /after/ them.) There was very little crossover between different writers, no all-HQ events to talk about, and not a whole lot of extra technology - we mostly used just what was in TOS.<br><br>The interconnected, stuffed-with-tech, nineteen-agents-per-writer setup we have now came about <i>because</i> of the Wiki, I think.

            <p>Wait, I can say with all sureness that it wasn&#39;t.<br><br>The interconnectedness was something that started around the same <i>time</i> but wasn&#39;t caused by the wiki- I know that for certain because the interconnected missions started happening before and after I created the wiki, and it was months and months before it was even usable for something like that. The early wiki was very nearly entirely things from previous PPC websites and bios made generally of characters from older spinoffs. The interconnectiveness was just something that came about with the 2006/2007 generation of writers.<br><br>As for&#39;nineteen agents per writer&#39; that one is actually on you. Because again, by around that point, you had both Crashing Down and Reorganisation, and with them a large number of agents you were writing, besides your other spin-offs. You were emulated quite a bit on that point. <br><br>-July, who certainly remembers the wiki stuff, considering</p>

            <p>Greetings, James Lee McKigney is my real name, Gaming is my Game.<br><br>Now, a lot of people are wonder &quot;Why is a Fat Nerd who is interested in games doing in the PPC?&quot; Well, I am wondering the same thing. But really, I will like to take on the horde of &quot;Bad Game.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bad Game&quot; are games that are of shoddy quality, having various qualities akin to that of a bad movie/fic, are notorious for ripping people off and they might even contain the Enemy. Who&#39;s the enemy newbies ask? The Sue. <br><br>Therefore, (If you will allow it) I would like to offer my services as a &quot;Jetter&quot; aka &quot;Jamming Everyman Tangling with Terrible gamEs Released.&quot; I read the constitution and I will study hard to be the best.<br><br>I would like to fight Bad Fics, but I tend to get bad memories from certain fandoms of games I like. So, I will take on the Bad Game instead and I would like to create a branch to help you guys if that&#39;s okay.</p>

            <p>First of all, hello hello, and welcome to our corner of the internet! Please take this plate of SPaGhetti as my welcome treat.<br><br>Right then. Things.<br><br>The PPC sporks bad fanfics of original works that have been published and are their own distinguished universes. These so-called &quot;Bad Games&quot; are, as you call them, &quot;games that are of shoddy quality, having various qualities akin to that of a bad movie/fic, are notorious for ripping people off and they might even contain [Sues].&quot; But you don&#39;t mention if these &quot;Bad Games&quot; are original work or something like, say, a bad <i>Fallout</i> mod. If they&#39;re original work, no matter how bad/rip-offy they are (see <i>Eragon</i> and <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> for example), they&#39;re off limits.<br><br>So, could you please define these &quot;Bad Games&quot;? <br><br>(And for the record, we already have a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Divisions_of_the_DMS#Video_Games_Division">Video Game Division</a> of the DMS, so if you&#39;re talking about making a separate department, that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother can of worms I can&#39;t see going through since departments are for types of fanfics, not genres.)</p>

            <p>I think the reason I use &#39;army&#39; and &#39;military&#39; interchangeably is that is how it works in Hebrew, owing to the IDF&#39;s weird command structure; unless otherwise noted, צבא (military) usually means the green army, ie ground forces and other associated corps (intelligence, C4I, artillery, etc etc). The Air Force (חיל האוויר, Air Corps) and Navy (חיל הים, Sea Corps) have differently-coloured uniform (beige for enlisted in both, white for navy officers and blue for air force officers), and are therefore called blue corps and white corps respectively.</p>

            <p>Glad you enjoyed it! And yes, well, subtle is most definitely a word. Definitely. Yep. (As confirmed, it is indeed gender neutral.

            <p>And its use is a complexity in and of itself.<br><br>It has and hasn&#39;t become more &#39;acceptable&#39;- more common in visible ways, yes. Things written in present tense exist, but they&#39;re in the general minority because of differences in media. There&#39;s a growing quantity of fic written in present tense because of the nature of the original media. As far as traditionally published writing goes, it&#39;s still part of a large minority with most if it belonging in the children&#39;s or YA section of your local bookstore or library. <br><br>As far as the PPC goes, present-tense isn&#39;t mocked for the sake of mocking present-tense. It&#39;s generally picked at because when we write missions, any changes to the word world the agents go into tend to be perceived in any number of ways (we the authors decide) and that includes a surprise shift from past tense to present tense or even (heaven help us) future tense, and sometimes back and forth without warning.<br><br>Tense confusion is a strong indicator of a shaky foundation in writing, and one of the basics that should be checked for when anyone writes a story before they post it. <br><br>There isn&#39;t anything innately wrong with a story written in present tense in and of itself.</p>

            <p>In fact, part of why I&#39;ve put off trying to get permission for so long is due to the fact that I just don&#39;t pick up on things like tense shifts. I write mainly in the past tense, but I have recently started writing a Black Lagoon fic that uses present tense, in part so I can learn how. It&#39;s also the first thing I&#39;ve ever written in first person, as well.<br><br>I, for one, think that each one has a time and a place. I have started using present tense more for personal, character-driven narratives because of the excitement, while I now use past-tense for large, epic narratives. I must admit, writing with it took some getting used to, but now it&#39;s practically second nature.<br><br>Present tense really isn&#39;t a good idea when you want what you&#39;re writing to be &#39;serious&#39; or clinical in some fashion, and it can sometimes limit how you write. Past tense is the same way, but less so, and in a different manner. Since I&#39;m a satirical writer, I still mostly end up using past tense. It can make for better gags and jokes, or maybe I&#39;m just better at being funny in past tense.<br><br>Probably a lot more than you were looking for, but since I&#39;ve had a lot of recent experience with the two tenses, that&#39;s just how it went.</p>

            <p>I put Kelly with a generic agent that may or may not shine once I start working with her.  I&#39;ve gone through I think nine prompts sofar and I&#39;m not happy with the results.
