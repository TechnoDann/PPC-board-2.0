Dead Sea Scrolls is a strange, strange item. It basically gives you the activated effect of a random item each turn. This, understandably, makes it pretty powerful, and occasionally horrible when you get a turn of Ring Target or something. However, since there are a lot of Berries floating around, it can help you give Regigigas the recovery it needs to outlast Slow Start, one of the worst in the game. Regi&#39;s still vulnerable to phazing, so that sucks, but try a tanky set with Substitute, Drain Punch, Return, and Thunder Wave. But most importantly, have fun! =]</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got some goodfics to share with you! Some of these I haven&#39;t actually read all the way through yet, so they&#39;re on my &quot;reading list&quot; instead of my favorites/goodfic list. But here they are anyway! :D<br><br><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/1033680">&quot;Dreams of perfection! The wonders of the computer age&quot;</a> Sailor Moon/Welcome to Night Vale crossover. Yes. Good. I found this one through the blog &quot;The Josei Next Door&quot; and her Sailor Moon recaps. Go check her blog out if you love Sailor Moon, running crossover headcanon gags about Sailor Pluto, and crazy nicknames for everyone.<br><br>Two stories that I feel raised the bar if not for the entire fandom, then at least for my fanfic goals: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3550998/1/Fortitude">Fortitude</a> and <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/855528/chapters/1637607">Sansыkh</a>. Read them and be completely blown away by humanity&#39;s potential for awesome. <br><br><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23817/A-Brief-History-of-Equestria">A Brief History of Equestria</a>: Exactly what it says in the URL. There are some punctuation glitches, but it&#39;s really good at making Equestrian history as complex and interesting (and yes, violent) as World One history. Be sure to read the side stories as well!<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11526709/1/All-for-Family">All for Family</a>: A Pokemon trainer tries to handle life in his super-famous sister&#39;s shadow. I like stories about underdogs, and for some reason the first time I read this I thought it was going to be a Parody Sue story. Still nice and clever, though. :)</p>

            <p>Sorry, but you guys couldn&#39;t get rid of me that easily. Yeah, it took awhile, between the moving, and the exploding (Don&#39;t ask - I don&#39;t remember most of it), but I&#39;m back. Sort of. I probably won&#39;t be very active because I&#39;m still unpacking, but I figured I should check in as soon as I could.<br><br>Any major developments I missed?</p>

            <p>So, has anyone seen the newest in the Arrow-Flash universe? The best I can describe it is <i>Doctor Who</i> meets <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> meets the cartoon <i>Time Squad</i>. And seeing as 2016 is going to be a Doctor-less year, I though I&#39;d give this one a chance... and I wasn&#39;t disappointed. Plus, it stars Arthur Darvill, or as we Whovians call him, Rory &quot;The Roman&quot; <s>Williams</s> Pond.</p>

            <p>I was pleasantly surprised. Still not over what happened in episode 2, though. God damn. Just when I was starting to like the character. Sara Lance still has my heart so that&#39;s one thing that hasn&#39;t changed haha! One thing I found funny about Arthur as Rip was that he (Arthur) said that he didn&#39;t want to star in another Sci-Fi thing but look at him, rocking the whole Time Master thing.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s hard to resist cracking jokes about how the Time Masters are totally not the Time Lords and <s>Rory</s> Rip Hunter is totally not the Doctor. *g* I mean, he&#39;s just a guy who stole a time ship from an elite council of time savants and is having wacky adventures with human companions to save Earth, right?

            <p>A word of explanation: this story was <i>originally</i> written a month or two ago - before the whole &#39;Baron hS is going to totally change&#39; thing.

            <p>Lady Iximaz set down the scroll and dropped her head to her desk.<br><br>&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; Foon asked.<br><br>Lady Iximaz waved a hand at the letter. Foon hesitated, but picked it up and read it. His eyebrows rose. &quot;The Republic of Iric has... vanished?&quot; he said incredulously.<br><br>His sister nodded. &quot;And the only person who might have any idea as to the people&#39;s whereabouts is Baron Huinesoron,&quot; she said tiredly. She stood, tugged her jerkin back into place, and grabbed her travel-worn cloak from the back of her chair. &quot;Inform the castle staff that I am going to pay him a visit,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;But, Ix! You said you were taking time off from your crusades to heal and focus on managing your barony!&quot; Foon grabbed her arm. &quot;You can&#39;t go searching for the missing people!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Who said I was going to do that?&quot; Lady Iximaz said, narrowing her eyes.<br><br>&quot;You all but said it yourself!&quot; Foon tried to tug her back to her chair. &quot;This is foolish! How can you hope to accomplish this on your own?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t,&quot; she said simply. She pulled her arm away and left, taking up her bow and quiver as she left the room. Her sword was already strapped to her side.<br><br>She went to the stables and saddled her horse, mounted, and spurred it into an easy canter.<br><br>Perhaps Baron Huinesoron would be willing to give her some clearer answers. And, perhaps, if she was very lucky, he would be willing to assist her on her new quest.</p>

            <p>How is she going to find <i>him</i>? Per <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17DMWHSYkxzLuZ3UOGDhb2BEcl_WtVKt_UpjHM-Im_u0/pub">The Lost Baron</a>, Huinesoron is still mostly in the wind. He was in disguise at the <s>Hunger Games</s> tournament in Borrd, wandered into empty Iric, then showed up at a trade meeting, chucked a flag on the table, and promptly vanished again. He&#39;s certainly not in Kwenaya.<br><br>There is one logical way of tracking him down, but I&#39;m curious as to whether Lady Iximaz has noticed it. ;)<br><br>(Also - it&#39;s not <i>quite</i> as bad as she makes it sound.

            <p>First plan: Find Baroness Kaitlyn and see if she&#39;s willing and able to help. <br><br>Second plan: Go back to her keep and ask if Foon would be able to scry him. Not the best idea since scrying isn&#39;t his strong suit (the kid likes explosions), but it might work.<br><br>Third plan, if it doesn&#39;t: find a pattern to his alleged sightings and track him down from there. To me, it seems like he&#39;s been revisiting the past, so all she&#39;d have to do is drop by Baron Neshomeh at Weichi and ask for his history. From there it would be making a list of places he&#39;d be likely to visit next and camp one of them.</p>

            <p>I am not very good at introductions.  I found out about both the PPC and Fanfiction because of TV tropes.  I have lurked on the Wiki for a while.  I was developing a character to help explore different themes and mistakes in all writing when I discovered that she was a PPC agent.  I am introducing myself in hopes that I can eventually write her down.  Plus I read that at some point, authors need to actually interact with other authors about writing to improve.</p>

            <p>I have at least attempted to read the original series.  I read the constitution, but it is very long and my ability to remember what I read is about 10% of the details.  Is &quot;try not to be a jerk&quot; a good enough substitute for the constitution?<br><br>Listing just the recognizable books that I&#39;ve read feels like bragging.  Right now, I&#39;m slowing reading &quot;Return of the Shadow.&quot;  I love how Tolkien started writing &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; before he knew what the book was about because I do something similar.<br><br>My most-watched DVDs right now are probably Dollhouse, Pleasantville, and Rock of Ages.<br><br></p>

            <p>The only celebration where pigging out is allowed... required even! It&#39;s the last Thursday before Lent and the one thing that everyone associates with that day is <b>doughnuts</b>! There is a difference, however. Polish doughnuts are deep-fried balls of dough with filling.<br><br><img src="http://cdn6.urzadzamy.smcloud.net/s/photos/t/27679/paczki_1164667.jpg"><br><br><br>So, to celebrate, I&#39;m giving our virtual doughnuts! You have some choice between fillings: rose petal jam, vanilla pudding, chocolate, and glitter! :D</p>

            <p>Sometimes a combination of both.

            <p>Although that implies that they use sweet pickles, which, just, yuck, in my opinion. Pickles are supposed to be *sour*, no?<br><br>The white kind...hmm. Like cold potato, celery, tiny bits of crunchy sour pickles, and...a little bit creamy, I guess? Nothing in it is all that soft, but there&#39;s a bit of a cream taste to it from the mayonnaise or whatever it is.

            <p>So, a Blizzard illustrator - Even Amundsen - has created his own version of a Wizarding school. It&#39;s called <b>Vшlurheim</b> (I don&#39;t know the exact meaning, unfortunately; all I know is that <i>heim</i> means &#39;world&#39;, or &#39;land&#39;) and it&#39;s settled in Scandinavia. Yes, we all know that Durmstrang Institute occupies that area, nonetheless it&#39;s a really cool headcanon.<br><br>So, here&#39;s the list of Vшlurheim&#39;s staff, with short description from the author (at least in some of them):<br><br><a href="http://www.kawerna.pl/images/stories/ALLIMAGES/2016/luty/hp3.jpg">Torbjшrn Jotunhorn</a> - The Headmaster<br><br><a href="http://www.kawerna.pl/images/stories/ALLIMAGES/2016/luty/hp1.jpg">Grimstav Draugsleiven</a> - Defence Against the Dark Arts<br>&quot;<i>Fearsome Professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts, and veteran warlock of the Troll Wars, Grimstav Draugsleiven. Being one of the few wizards to have closely befriended and studied dwarf kind and has many of his tales engraved on his body in the form of tattoos that have been magically imbued with runes of protection and power, making him a very powerful wizard indeed. Even though dignified and reserved most of the time, he will make settling grudges a point of honor, and when irked might throw his robes aside and appear as one sees him here, ready teach some life lessons.</i>&quot;<br><br><a href="http://pre13.deviantart.net/4af2/th/pre/i/2014/318/8/7/kari_sigfridsdottir_by_mischeviouslittleelf-d86dj3j.jpg">Kari “Mannevond” Sigfridsdottir</a> - Charms and Curses. Her nickname is Norwegian for &#39;vicious&#39;.<br><br><a href="http://www.kawerna.pl/images/stories/ALLIMAGES/2016/luty/hp4.jpg">Mumrikk Stigandur</a> - Herbology.<br>&quot;<i>He is a rather mellow type, a wanderer, thinker, a friend to the shy and the timid, and a true son of nature. Mumrikk Stigandur is the Professor of Herbology, when he is not wandering far and wide throughout the magical world. The design of this guy will probably be quite familiar to those of you who are fans of the Moomin series, as he is heavily inspired by the character Snufkin, who goes by Snusmumrikken in Norwegian.</i>&quot;<br><br><a href="http://www.kawerna.pl/images/stories/ALLIMAGES/2016/luty/hp5.jpg">Ragnhild Stubbemoen</a> - Dracology.<br>&quot;<i>Professor of Dragon Lore and Care, a specilaized class for senior students. Ragnhild Stubbemoen is a well known face in all circles where dragonlore is appreciated and is a world authority on the Norwegian Ridgeback. Ragnhild has held a teaching position at Vшlurheim for an impressive 79 years and she is well known to get along better with her charges than with her students.</i>&quot;<br><br><a href="https://cdn2.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/001/675/366/large/even-amundsen-hulda-kvaenangsdottir-copy.jpg?1450639872">Hulda Kvжnangsdottir</a> - Healing Arts.<br>&quot;<i>She is the Professor of the Healing Arts, and for advanced senior students she also teaches a course in Ancient Blood Magic. She is one of the best known hulders to live openly amongst humans, and while it is common amonst her kinsmen to have a hard time feeling at home, she has found her place by sheer will of force. Her fascination with the old magicks, and her belonging amongst the hulderfolk, has her sympathetic to trolls and tusser (nordic feral goblins) and has her in almost constant conflict with Professor Draugsleiven.</i>&quot;<br><br><a href="https://cdn0.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/000/482/648/large/even-amundsen-dagfinn-snauholt.jpg?1443927701">Dagfinn Snauholt</a> - Groundskeeper.<br>&quot;<i>This is Dagfinn Snauholt, Keeper of Keys and Lights at Vшlurheim. He is the sole nisse</i> (benevolent imp) <i>on staff, and wages a never ending war against the mice that make the school their home, accompanied by his proud steed, Knerten.</i>&quot;</p>

            <p>That reason is to let people know the content rating of the story they are about to read. Should it be rated T, for Teen, one should expect, as laid out in the rating system used by FFN (link: <a href="http://www.fiction">www.fiction</a> ratings.com), any or all of &quot;some violence, minor coarse language, and minor suggestive adult themes&quot;. This is noted as &quot; suitable for teens, 13 years and older&quot;. You can read the rest yourself; be aware that FFN uses K, K+, T, and M, but *not* MA (although, to be fair, some posters do blur the lines a bit between M and MA. Many others, however, will post the MA/NC-17 scenes they write elsewhere, so as not to violate the terms of use).<br><br>The youngest age you can be in order to have an account on FanFiction.net is either twelve or thirteen. A four-year-old--and you&#39;re assuming a four-year-old who knows how to read pretty well, not to mention find the site and navigate it--well, even assuming a young child who&#39;s been shown the site or something, that child should either know or will quickly figure out that they should stick to the K or K+ rated stories, of which there are many.<br><br>In my experience, users of FFN read stories at a rating with which they are comfortable. The only main &#39;dangers&#39; are mis-rated stories or first-time users who haven&#39;t figured out the rating system yet (although, even then, M-rated stories are not displayed by default). To the first: I have every confidence that should Bramandin post this story on FFN, it will be correctly rated--or even overrated for safety, as is common practice. Should a reader too young for the themes find it, read it, and, of course, *understand* what it&#39;s getting at--and young readers miss many things that older readers get, due to the difference in life experience and so on--well, that would not be on the author, assuming the story was correctly rated and the trigger watching included in either the summary or an opening A/N.<br><br>FFN, and other sites, are filled with all sorts of stories. Some are good; some are thoughtful; some are bad; some are horrible. They come in many genres. This is no less true of children&#39;s shows--see My Little Pony for one example, or Kim Possible, or just about anything.<br><br>Also... I don&#39;t belieof that anyone, *ever* has sued a fanfic author for writing a story a little above the rating level of a person who read it, especially of their own free will. Moreover, the *only* thing Bramandin has warned for is &quot;off-screen child abuse&quot;. Trust me--there are much, much, *much* worse things that have been written about in both fanworks and original works. Honestly, from the information we have, I&#39;d expect this to be a thoughtful sort of piece, a different take on something or else a &#39;what if this character was confronted with this issue&#39;.<br><br>Also? As far as I remember, there&#39;s child abuse awareness stuff (campaigns or education or something?) going around, so as to teach kids to speak out about it. Assuming it&#39;s even more than a minor sort of thing in this piece, it would probably just feed into that, at most.<br><br>tl;dr: FFN, as well as most sites, has a rating system in place. It&#39;s linked above. Rating correctly is the responsibility of the author, and putting trigger warnings in is considered considerate everywhere. (Archive of Our Own even has those as warnings in the rating system). Reading at the appropriate level, however, is the responsibility of the reader and of the people around them--*not* the author. Bramandin&#39;s piece also does not seem to fit the category of &#39;absolutely traumatizing&#39;; moreover, Bramandin clearly knows what to warn for. Also, fanfic authors generally do *not* get sued for things like this; much more likely is, at most, publishing a fanfic as their own book without authorization or changing names, etc (ie, if EL James had published 50 Shades without changing the names and without getting Stephenie Meyer&#39;s permission to publish a Twilight tie-in or something).<br><br>In short: I see no problem here, nor, in fact, anything remotely unusual. I&#39;d also suggest actually reading the piece before condemning it; it really does not sound to me to be particularly traumatizing by most standards, and the author&#39;s comments seem to support that.<br><br>If you&#39;d like a run-down on AO3&#39;s rating system, I can do that. It&#39;s a similar sort of concept, but with different terms and with tags. Tumblr, meanwhile, has no rating system whatsoever, just the option to use tags and the stipulation that... 13, I believe, is the youngest age to have an account. FFN or AO3 is really a better bet, especially if you want to know the content rating quickly instead of guessing from the beginning or the tags--which won&#39;t always be there.<br><br>Also... Tumblr hosts stories, yes, but it&#39;s not a fanfic archive. That&#39;s not its official, main, or primary purpose. It doesn&#39;t really make as much sense to post stories exclusively to there.<br><br>And, right, I&#39;ll finish there. Apart from adding that I&#39;ve been with all of these sites I&#39;ve mentioned for a while: FFN since 2009, though I was reading there earlier; AO3 since at least a few years later; and Tumblr since 2011 or 2012 (probably 2012).<br><br>Thanks for reading.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I wasn&#39;t sure how safe it was to go into details here.  <br><br>Yes, the story is about the first time that Grover was involved with getting Child Protective Services called.  Rather, it&#39;s him talking to Herry about he wasn&#39;t sure what he heard.  The story doesn&#39;t have any details about the &quot;bad secret,&quot; but knowing that there are awareness campaigns targeted at kids might bring my story into a very low PG rating.

            <p>What would really be helpful is everything but the canon details.  Basically I&#39;d like someone to check if the idea is even salvageable first.  It&#39;s in a very rough state.  <br><br>And then if it workable, maybe spend a few minutes marking where I need more description, and point out awkward transitions.<br><br>I understand if you still don&#39;t want to deal with that canon.</p>

            <p>The main problem is that I&#39;m pretty busy right now. School is busy, as is placement, and I&#39;m already set to start a co-written mission, along with the stuff I&#39;m already working on. If no one else volunteers, and if there&#39;s a point when I get the free time, then I wouldn&#39;t mind; but I can&#39;t guarantee that that&#39;ll be anytime soon.

<li>My primary team is in Implausible Crossovers, but I kept running into Sues that annoyed me enough to want to kill. I didn&#39;t want to keep having to make up excuses for my DIC team to get Suefics, so I needed a team in the DMS.<br><br>2. To cover more of my favorite continua, with characters who feel as strongly as I do about them. Nume and Ilraen prefer certain flavors of fantasy and sci-fi, and neither of them has a musical bone in his body. If I wanted to deal with my favorite musicals, I needed other characters for that. (I still don&#39;t have anyone I&#39;d easily send into modern, more or less realistic settings like <i>Psych</i> or <i>NCIS</i>, but since I haven&#39;t seen any fics there I really want to PPC, either, that&#39;s been okay.)<br><br>3. To be able to tell different kinds of jokes than I can with Nume and Ilraen. They&#39;re both fairly serious, straight-faced people who don&#39;t use a lot of modern slang, so if I wanted to crack jokes based on Internet memes, or write about pranks pulled during a mission, I needed someone else for that.<br><br>Additionally, I dislike it when people recruit badfic characters and then don&#39;t do anything with them. Once I decided I was going to recruit Derik, there was no question that I was going to write about him, and he fit half of what I wanted to do as a storyteller. Earwig didn&#39;t work out for me, but then Gall came along, and thanks to her canon&#39;s tendency to be anachronistic, she fits the other half and also acts as a balance to Derik&#39;s overwhelming tendency to be angsty and grim (which is <i>not</i> how I set out to write him, but characters will do what they do). It&#39;s also good for me to have a female character besides Jenni.<br><br>As for who gets what mission, it&#39;s a simple question of a) is it a Suefic or a crossover? and b) would my characters know/care about the problems in it enough to have entertaining reactions?<br><br>I&#39;ve tried to alternate writing one DIC story, then one DMS story, etc., but it really just depends on what story I&#39;m feeling most strongly about at any given time.<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>1) They take turns, simple as that.<br><br>2) Same as the above, really. I do a mission with one team, then I do mission with the others and if I don&#39;t have a fic ready, I go dig one up. My first team used to be in Floaters and now they&#39;re in the Department of Improbabilities, so they can work a wide range of canons and badfic types.<br>My other team is still in Floaters, but I&#39;m making them do bad Harry Potter/Labyrinth crossovers, since that gets them both riled up.<br><br>3) MY first pair get along great, so after a few missions with them, I wanted a team that would bicker and fight all the time, just for variation. And then I did a really horrible fic, with a couple of bit characters I thought were salvageable and decided to use them,</p>

            <p>Namely, one of my teams gets a little time in the spotlight for a given number of missions, and may or may not have a mini-story arc to go with it. Note of course that this primarily applies to solo-written missions, as my co-writes with others have so far not adhered to the same organization. Secondary RCs tend to have missions done sporadically or as supporting material for other teams, which is what I&#39;d recommend for people who haven&#39;t made the mistake I did of writing... *counts on fingers* three major teams (one of which I&#39;m planning to write an epilogue for in due course), one supporting team, and at least five other supporting characters who turn up here and there.<br><br>In light of this, having different teams be part of different departments is also helpful for organizing who gets what. To continue using my agents as examples: Rayner and E.V.L. take on fics that have a Suvian character and are part of only one fandom; Sarah, Cupid, and Lapis deal exclusively with crossovers; and Falchion, Rashida, and Ripper get... well, everything else.</p>

            <p>Carefully. <br><br>My personal advice is to hold off on writing another agent pair until you have an idea of what you&#39;re doing with your first set. <br><br>There&#39;s no need to have a dozen or more agents spread out throughout all the PPC and then basically render yourself unable to write anything because you can&#39;t decide. <br><br>That said, they also don&#39;t have to actually have their own spin-off. You can feature them in your main spinoff, interacting with your first two agents, or use them in RP, and so on. Or in stories set in HQ that aren&#39;t missions at all.<br><br>Right now I have a bunch of things in the works, spread out over a variety of characters- the thing is to make sure you keep focused on *something* so you have something to show for it, writing wise. <br><br>-July, productive lately</p>

            <p>As those of you who read my missions know, Za&#39;kiir will now and then speak in the language of the dragons of the video game &quot;Skyrim.&quot; (Don&#39;t worry, I have an explanation for how he learns it in the next upcoming mission, which hopefully will be finished soon.) What I want to know is, do you guys want me to give translations for what he says in footnotes, or would you rather have it be as it is to add a bit of mystery (or if you just want to go look up the meaning for yourselves for the fun of it)?</p>

<li>If a character is going to use another language, they should have a good reason for doing so every time they do it. Don&#39;t chuck in bits of Dovahzul just to show that you can; Za&#39;kiir himself should have a reason to use it. (If <i>he&#39;s</i> just showing off, that&#39;s fine. If <i>you</i> are, it&#39;s not.)<br><br>2. If the audience is meant to know something, the author should make it plain. Don&#39;t use Dovahzul for important information. If Za&#39;kiir must be speaking it a lot for character or plot reasons, though, you can write the dialogue in English and let the narrative explain that he&#39;s not actually speaking English:<br><br>&quot;Blah blah blah,&quot; he said in Dovahzul.<br><br>3. If the meaning of a word or phrase in another language is plain given the context, there&#39;s no need to translate it. (And it&#39;s always a good idea to make sure the meaning of any piece of dialogue is plain by giving it proper context.)<br><br>4. If the audience is not meant to know the meaning of a word or phrase in another language, or can reasonably get by without knowing, there&#39;s no need to translate it.<br><br>5. If you must provide translations, either do so diegetically (i.e. as Dorano suggested, with further dialogue) or extradiegetically (with footnotes). Mixing the two with in-line author&#39;s notes breaks the reader&#39;s immersion in the story and is annoying. Diegetic is better than extradiegetic, since it involves less work for the reader.<br><br>TL;DR: Avoid the need for translations at all costs, unless you&#39;re going to work them seamlessly into the narrative. Otherwise they&#39;re just distracting.<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>However, they require different skills. I would normally just say &quot;Rule of Funny,&quot; but it&#39;s a bit more complicated than that. Normally, it would make more sense to just mention the language so that people are aware, but translate all dialogue, maybe with a transliterated accent – otherwise, it&#39;s difficult and obnoxious for the reader to follow. So I would say if you intend to translate, don&#39;t bother with footnotes. <br><br>But sometimes, IF you think it&#39;ll work in text, it can be more fun to leave that dialogue completely untranslated, and let the reader figure it out from context. An example, using my own agents:<br><br>&quot;I call this meeting to order,&quot; Mohan said, giving a meaningful look at his fellow Cafeteria workers. &quot;All present and accounted for?&quot;<br>&quot;Aye.&quot;<br>&quot;Rrrnn.&quot;<br>&quot;Good. First order of business– the Agents are complaining about the sentient mold demons in the soda machine again.&quot;<br>&quot;Nnngh ernch, Ґ#%••§ warhesch,&quot; Jof replied. <br>Mohan suppressed a snort of laughter. &quot;Don&#39;t hold back, Jof. How do you really feel?&quot;<br>&quot;He&#39;s right,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;They&#39;re always complaining about something. If we get rid of the mold demons, they&#39;ll just start grousing about the arsenic on the silverware or something.&quot;<br><br>----<br><br>You see what I mean? A footnote would 1) break the flow of the text, and 2) be less funny than whatever the reader imagines. It&#39;s like the rule of horror movies. The more you leave to the imagination, the funnier it is. But if you think the dialogue is central enough that it needs to be translated, I would <i>strongly</i> recommend that you put the translations in-text. </p>

            <p>If you do want to denote that they&#39;re speaking in Dovah, definitely do not add parenthetical notes - those will break the text up even worse than a footnote. Just put the translated speech in italics. Somewhere in the text, add a line like &quot;He always had a little trouble understanding Zakiir&#39;s humor; the harsh accent of Dragon-speech didn&#39;t lend itself easily to sarcasm.&quot; Or something like that - it will flow much better than trying to translate every time and note it as such.

            <p>If he talks like the Dovah themselves — ie, in a way that the Dovahzul is just added flavour — I think it&#39;s OK to leave it as-is. OTOH, if it&#39;s actually important for understanding what he says, use footnotes. In that case, though, use it sparingly because having to continuously refer to footnotes in order to understand a character&#39;s dialogue is a royal pain.</p>

            <p>Hey so 4 days ago, Greg Weisman (Young Justice&#39;s producer) teased that there could be some hope for Young Justice Season 3. The series is currently available in Netflix and on BluRay. So if the series gets enough attention, we could (quite possibly) get a Season 3. So yay!

            <p>... was read the entirety of a person&#39;s mission output in a row. Everyone only had one set of agents, and most of them only did a couple of missions, so that was easy. (Dafydd and Selene had one of the biggest runs, for reference - and note that my other agents came /after/ them.) There was very little crossover between different writers, no all-HQ events to talk about, and not a whole lot of extra technology - we mostly used just what was in TOS.<br><br>The interconnected, stuffed-with-tech, nineteen-agents-per-writer setup we have now came about <i>because</i> of the Wiki, I think.

            <p>Wait, I can say with all sureness that it wasn&#39;t.<br><br>The interconnectedness was something that started around the same <i>time</i> but wasn&#39;t caused by the wiki- I know that for certain because the interconnected missions started happening before and after I created the wiki, and it was months and months before it was even usable for something like that. The early wiki was very nearly entirely things from previous PPC websites and bios made generally of characters from older spinoffs. The interconnectiveness was just something that came about with the 2006/2007 generation of writers.<br><br>As for&#39;nineteen agents per writer&#39; that one is actually on you. Because again, by around that point, you had both Crashing Down and Reorganisation, and with them a large number of agents you were writing, besides your other spin-offs. You were emulated quite a bit on that point. <br><br>-July, who certainly remembers the wiki stuff, considering</p>

            <p>First of all, hello hello, and welcome to our corner of the internet! Please take this plate of SPaGhetti as my welcome treat.<br><br>Right then. Things.<br><br>The PPC sporks bad fanfics of original works that have been published and are their own distinguished universes. These so-called &quot;Bad Games&quot; are, as you call them, &quot;games that are of shoddy quality, having various qualities akin to that of a bad movie/fic, are notorious for ripping people off and they might even contain [Sues].&quot; But you don&#39;t mention if these &quot;Bad Games&quot; are original work or something like, say, a bad <i>Fallout</i> mod. If they&#39;re original work, no matter how bad/rip-offy they are (see <i>Eragon</i> and <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> for example), they&#39;re off limits.<br><br>So, could you please define these &quot;Bad Games&quot;? <br><br>(And for the record, we already have a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Divisions_of_the_DMS#Video_Games_Division">Video Game Division</a> of the DMS, so if you&#39;re talking about making a separate department, that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother can of worms I can&#39;t see going through since departments are for types of fanfics, not genres.)</p>

            <p>I think the reason I use &#39;army&#39; and &#39;military&#39; interchangeably is that is how it works in Hebrew, owing to the IDF&#39;s weird command structure; unless otherwise noted, צבא (military) usually means the green army, ie ground forces and other associated corps (intelligence, C4I, artillery, etc etc). The Air Force (חיל האוויר, Air Corps) and Navy (חיל הים, Sea Corps) have differently-coloured uniform (beige for enlisted in both, white for navy officers and blue for air force officers), and are therefore called blue corps and white corps respectively.</p>

            <p>Glad you enjoyed it! And yes, well, subtle is most definitely a word. Definitely. Yep. (As confirmed, it is indeed gender neutral.

            <p>I think my favourite part is... pretty much from when we first jump away from the seaman&#39;s POV to the lookout.

            <p>And its use is a complexity in and of itself.<br><br>It has and hasn&#39;t become more &#39;acceptable&#39;- more common in visible ways, yes. Things written in present tense exist, but they&#39;re in the general minority because of differences in media. There&#39;s a growing quantity of fic written in present tense because of the nature of the original media. As far as traditionally published writing goes, it&#39;s still part of a large minority with most if it belonging in the children&#39;s or YA section of your local bookstore or library. <br><br>As far as the PPC goes, present-tense isn&#39;t mocked for the sake of mocking present-tense. It&#39;s generally picked at because when we write missions, any changes to the word world the agents go into tend to be perceived in any number of ways (we the authors decide) and that includes a surprise shift from past tense to present tense or even (heaven help us) future tense, and sometimes back and forth without warning.<br><br>Tense confusion is a strong indicator of a shaky foundation in writing, and one of the basics that should be checked for when anyone writes a story before they post it. <br><br>There isn&#39;t anything innately wrong with a story written in present tense in and of itself.</p>

            <p>In fact, part of why I&#39;ve put off trying to get permission for so long is due to the fact that I just don&#39;t pick up on things like tense shifts. I write mainly in the past tense, but I have recently started writing a Black Lagoon fic that uses present tense, in part so I can learn how. It&#39;s also the first thing I&#39;ve ever written in first person, as well.<br><br>I, for one, think that each one has a time and a place. I have started using present tense more for personal, character-driven narratives because of the excitement, while I now use past-tense for large, epic narratives. I must admit, writing with it took some getting used to, but now it&#39;s practically second nature.<br><br>Present tense really isn&#39;t a good idea when you want what you&#39;re writing to be &#39;serious&#39; or clinical in some fashion, and it can sometimes limit how you write. Past tense is the same way, but less so, and in a different manner. Since I&#39;m a satirical writer, I still mostly end up using past tense. It can make for better gags and jokes, or maybe I&#39;m just better at being funny in past tense.<br><br>Probably a lot more than you were looking for, but since I&#39;ve had a lot of recent experience with the two tenses, that&#39;s just how it went.</p>
