            <p>Because having slept over what you said earlier, you damn well deserve one. :(<br><br>First off, given what I&#39;ve been hearing that you&#39;ll be making this entire mission SFW, I&#39;d be very interested in hearing about how you&#39;ll be handling that, because I was under the impression that Agony in Pink being extremely ultra-violent and NSFW/NSFB in general would likely have left very little room for writing material that didn&#39;t mention the sordidness of the subject matter. To write a SFW mission based on a very, very gruesome and horrifying badfic would be an interesting challenge, especially one as infamous as this. My guess is that it&#39;d result in A) an exorcism and the unfortunate canon participants being sent to Medical, FicPsych, or both; B) at least one character replacement being killed offscreen or in a relatively clean fashion that doesn&#39;t imitate the level of gore seen in the fic itself; or C) both. Whatever the case, a dramatic, drawn-out execution scene with crazy deaths for every Suvian involved doesn&#39;t seem appropriate for such a drawn-out squickfest, and it would only make sense to end it off with a peaceful whimper rather than a gory bang. That&#39;s just speculation, though - the mission itself could take it in a different direction, who knows?<br><br>Interesting that July joined the military after running away from HQ. Having looked through all of the previous missions involving July and Library, I would be interested in learning of how she got drafted in the first place and her adventures as a soldier. That&#39;s likely a story for another time, though. Anyway, the fact that July kept several figurines and toys on her rack is a nice little touch, and to me it does smack of the notion that maybe she does miss visiting so many different continua and, somewhere deep down, she does want to go back, but her experiences there has made her deny that particular subconscious. Again, though, that&#39;s just a guess.<br><br>The reunion scene with July and Library (Calpurnia? Is that what she&#39;s known as now?) was very sweet, and I like how Library decided not to have a replacement partner because it wouldn&#39;t have been the same without the original July with her. The &quot;Cal&quot; nickname was a cute touch, too, and while I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll be used more often I like that it cements the fact that even after all this time, they&#39;re still best friends - and their bond will need to be stronger than ever, all things considered.<br><br>Now, the meeting with the Flowers. This part specifically was what I got into trouble about in the first place. You were right in that July was the one who mentioned the Legendaries, and not the Flowers. In light of this, it was also totally wrong of me to straight-up request that the Flowers mention it. I wrote about a discussion of the &quot;Sweet Apple Massacre&quot; incident in one of my previous missions, and it was implied that only a select few people knew about what happened; there is absolutely no way that July would have been able to know of it. I was horribly careless, insensitive, and self-absorbed when I stated what I did earlier, because I didn&#39;t read the entirety of this work when I commented on it and my ego got the better of me that time. I cannot apologize enough for this mistake, and I will make sure to read the entire work before commenting as well as avoid bringing my own image into my feedback in the future.<br><br>With that being said, the entire meeting had a great sense of foreboding, especially the fact that multiple Flowers agreed to send July and Library into this abomination of a badfic, either because their own agents refused or they felt that these two were the most suited for the job. Probably both. At any rate it&#39;s good to see that the Flowers hold faith in some of their charges and that they hold July and Library in such esteem. And the part with July demanding that she do the whole thing her way, with no casualties or major trauma, is a great tieback to your stated endeavor to make the mission SFW, clean, and efficient. And the &quot;Never Again Volunteer Yourself&quot; bit was a funny little touch. XD<br><br>Now to the last part of the prologue. It was only fair that the agents get some backup, because this is a freaking Legendary, and if the Aviator&#39;s case is anything to go by, soloing a Legendary is a risky challenge at best. Fritz and Silas making a reappearance was unexpected but most welcome, since I loved reading of these two and I was hoping they&#39;d come back for at least this mission. Their taking down Cupcakes was one of my favorite PPC readings and I would like to see how they handle something SO much worse. And of course, the Cafeteria scene. &quot;Many governmental. So navy. Much military. Wow.&quot; was the line where I suspected that this was going to be golden - and &quot;Very, very purposefully the wrong words&quot; was where I cast aside all possible doubt. Starting up a mass brawl just to pick out Nume would totally be something July would do, and it&#39;s paid off beautifully. Grumpy Nume is grumpy as always, and July kneecapping him didn&#39;t help matters, but it made for a pretty neat interaction scene which showcases that even with their... problems... with each other... Nume is still willing to help, and that&#39;s what counts.<br><br>Finally, and most importantly, I am sincerely and deeply sorry for having been so unbelievably self-centered, inconsiderate, tasteless, and outright insulting. Not just on this occasion but during many, MANY previous instances where I posted and blurted out selfish, tactless words without thinking. I will do everything in my power from here on out to rid myself of this nasty habit, and I hope no hard feelings will arise from this incident, because dangit, I don&#39;t want any pointed at me.<br><br>And needless to say, I look forward to where this mission will go, and how everyone participating in all of this will (safely) handle the horror of Agony in Pink.<br><br>-SS</p>

            <p>As for how it will be SFW, no worries, you&#39;ll see like everyone else as it goes on. It&#39;s true that AiP is fairly NSFW and NSFB, and how I&#39;m going to do it will be revealed in the due course of time. :)<br><br>As for being in the military, the correct term is &#39;enlisted&#39;, and in her/my case, &#39;sailor&#39;. I&#39;ve still got backspaces I can fill with stories for this particular spin-off, and I may do so in the course of time; one of those I would certainly handle is why July retired in the first place and went on to join a very different sort of organization. And a good eye for detail as far as everything on the rack shelf goes, too. <br><br>As for Library, Calpurnia is her first name. She&#39;s a very formal sort of person and goes by her last name when it comes to missions. <br><br>&quot;Never Again Volunteer Yourself&quot; is a very important motto in the navy. <br><br>As far as the Flowers go, they do have to have some trust in all of their agents, otherwise there wouldn&#39;t be a PPC, or at least one that does the level of recruiting there is.<br><br>I can&#39;t say for sure, but I suspect that Nume has a soft spot when it comes to his  own partner, which is probably why July finally resorting to bringing up Library worked. As compared to bodily violence. Funny, that. <br><br>As far as owning up to your mistakes, and apologizing, thank you. I appreciate it. Like you said, it&#39;s absolutely a habit you need to work on. It does result in a change in how other people see you and are willing to treat you. If you make an effort to be more open to letting other people do their thing and occasionally take the backseat and not let your ego trample over them, you&#39;re going to find much more opening up to you in the community in terms of writing partners, people being willing to beta for you, and people wanting to talk to you in general. <br><br>Being willing to listen will also result in your own writing improving, too, between soaking in suggestions and learning new writing habits and better methods, and reaching a higher ability to work with betas who are willing to do an excellent job editing instead of telling you what you want to hear. <br><br>Try to keep that in mind, because now that you&#39;ve shown that you can listen when someone bonks you on the nose for bad behavior, others will probably be more willing to tell you to knock it off in the future, too. <br><br>-July</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t even know where to start!  Um.  The build-ups: very suspenseful.  Even the first set of scenes, even though I knew that this is building up to &quot;Agony in Pink,&quot; felt like they had such an impending wham for Agent July.  (And, of course, they did!)  The other was when July got &quot;&#39;allowance to do this <i>my</i> way,&#39;&quot; which got me all kinds of curious about what, exactly, you had going down.  The scenes where July collects her first two team mates added to that buildup.  The way she sorted Nume out of the cafeteria crowd was brilliant!  The DoSAT scene especially had me perplexed at first, because I was only thinking about actively written agents.  I didn&#39;t see Fritz and Silas coming at all, and it was super cool to see them on the page again.  (Is Joe in on this, or are you just borrowing Fritz?)<br><br>Which leads to the next point of awesomeness: all the little nods you make to PPC continuity.  From the obvious ones like Katie Cray and discussing the history of Legendary missions, to the subtle little nods to things like &quot;Literally, Floaters&quot; and Sally&#39;s dubious deputizing, make this whole piece feel like it&#39;s using the whole PPC as a firm foundation, and adds to its strength as a part of PPC history.<br><br>I love the reunion scene between July and Library.  It&#39;s sweet, and shows that they care about each other, but without getting too dramatically emotional.  Also excellent is the scene at Room One.  You perfectly blended inter-character humor with the seriousness with which the Flowers viewed the AiP undertaking—the huge, but mostly unspeaking, crowd gets that point across all on its own, as does the Hyacinth&#39;s simple and straightforward delivery throughout.<br><br>And then, of course, there&#39;s that beautiful line I was gushing about in text last night.  I&#39;m not even going to to say it here in case some folks haven&#39;t figured it out yet, but yeah.  It&#39;s still gorgeous, and I&#39;m still gushing.<br><br>—doctorlit wishes he could clever like July</p>

            <p>Right off the bat, I&#39;m absolutely glad you enjoyed it. <br><br>Unfortunately I suspect Nume doesn&#39;t agree with that particular assessment. As far as Joe goes, I&#39;m only borrowing Fritz. <br><br>I&#39;m glad you caught as many of those references as you did! It&#39;s something of a &quot;who&#39;s who&quot; of cameo roles and mentions in the cafeteria scene alone, for instance. This mission is basically my love song to the PPC, and I wanted to get as much of that across as possible without making the mission itself difficult to read for newcomers. So hopefully I am succeeding there.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you enjoyed both scenes. I tried to keep the reunion simple, and not let the Flowers steal the show too much with the second. <br><br>And as for that text, you&#39;ll see what it means soon enough.<br><br>-July who knows doc can write as cleverly as she can</p>

            <p>As far as I remember, your spin-off wasn’t actually my favorite back in the days when I read everything on the complete list of PPC fiction before joining the Board. But what I’ve seen from you since you returned – woah! There’s been a lot of development, either on your side or mine (or both). Over the past few years I learned a lot about the PPC and fandoms I didn’t know. I probably should go back and reread July and Calpunia’s story to see whether I can enjoy the diversity and originality more now. If I only had the time to do everything I want to do. <br>  <br>Nevertheless, even with beta readers of this caliber, some lines escaped the proofreading:<br><br><i>Out the door and back into the corridor, July fell into step next to Library, her pace and footing <b>matching that of other woman&#39;s.</b></i><br>Shouldn’t this be either &quot;matching the other woman’s&quot; or &quot;matching that of the other woman&quot;?<br><br><i>We try to find two people each, and it should work out to <b>hopefully enough</b>.</i><br>Missing word &quot;be&quot;? I’m not sure whether this is intentional.<br><br><i>I think I might have accidentally <b>on purposely</b> sold myself to the US military ...</i> <br>Shouldn’t this be either &quot;on purpose&quot; or &quot;purposely&quot;? Again, I’m not certain whether July making small mistakes in her dialogue is intentional.<br><br><i><b>Do look</b> like a masochist?</i><br>As far as I know Nume, he wouldn’t leave out the &quot;I&quot;?<br><br>I’m looking forward to the actual mission, and how you’ll make this SFW.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>As far as my spin-off goes, I would never say it was necessarily the best-written, but I always tried to do different things with it to some extent or another.

It&#39;s got its own KnowYourMeme article, it was first published in 2011, and the first 5 pages of Google results AT LEAST are related to it and the sheer revulsion directed at it. If it is a Legendary, well... Honestly, you&#39;d think it&#39;d have been mentioned during the Flowers&#39; discussion on previously killed Legendary badfics, since in-universe the mission into it (which I&#39;ll address in a future story) happened sometime in April 2014.

            <p>Your first response came off as straight up egotistical and thoughtless. You spent more words focusing on something that serves your own ends than any actual feedback.<br><br>&quot;I should&#39;ve worded my question as &quot;Would SAM be considered a Legendary?&quot; without tacking on anything else, which was the question I was intending to ask and not, well, &quot;Why wasn&#39;t this mentioned here?&quot;&quot;<br><br>Except this isn&#39;t what you had said. <br><br>You spent more time focusing on this badfic you to have be percieved as legendary by the rest of the community that you...  chose to mention it in a thread for a mission plug rather than any of the legendary badfic prosal threads we had a few months back or to make your own at any point between then and now. <br><br>You say it was killed in-universe in 2014. Again, your words were &quot;Honestly, you think it&#39;d have been mentioned during the Flowers&#39; discussion on previously killed Legendary badfics, since in-universe the mission into it (which I&#39;ll address in a future story) happened sometime in April 2014&quot;.  <br><br>You can&#39;t just claim something of the import you are claiming it has should be known to have been killed in-universe two years ago, when you haven&#39;t actually done so. Especially not when the claim page says you claimed it March of this year. You did outright say it should have been mentioned in Flowers&#39; discussion if it was in fact a legendary. There&#39;s a problem with this because it wasn&#39;t the Flowers bringing them up at all. It was the former agent July. This seems like something you would have mentioned correctly in your response if you didn&#39;t come off as so concerned that your non-existent mission wasn&#39;t name dropped alongside all these others. <br><br>Sometimes you have to decide to actually make writing things a priority, instead of declaring that it occurred and expecting everyone else to play along with you. The PPC is a shared universe, yes, but it&#39;s also very modular- I don&#39;t have to acknowledge anyone&#39;s spin-offs, and neither do you; the only thing that is canon that we have to follow is the Original Series. No one here, including me, is obliged to humor anyone else&#39;s. I could, if I chose to do so, decide to make hS very sad by ignoring his lovely detailed worldbuilding canon and come up with my own ideas of how the PPC formed; there&#39;s nothing stopping me aside from the fact that it&#39;d possibly make Huinesoron upset. But I respect Huinesoron, and like the things he writes, so as far as my writings in the PPC goes, his stuff, of which there is a heck a lot of, is canon. Shared respect for the writing of others is one of the things that make the PPC work. <br><br>I spent a good day trying to figure out how to respond to your posts in here. I apologize to everyone for the acerbicness of this reply and have tried to keep it from coming off that way, but you&#39;ve repeatedly shown yourself as being much more concerned with how to serve yourself and your own spin-off, rather than just being content to comment on the works of others in the community <i>without</i> tying it back to yourself and how it should relate to you.<br><br>Please think on how this sort of thing reflects on you. <br></p>

            <p>First of all? Good job. No, great job. <br><br>Won&#39;t comment too much more other than to say it felt almost like a grand final season to a long-running TV show: bringing in a bunch of familiar faces to take down the Big Bad. I can&#39;t really explain it, other than to say I got a pretty good sense of grandness from the whole thing. I liked it.<br><br>Also, this line.<br><br><i>July glanced in the DAVD Head&#39;s direction. &quot;Isn&#39;t this sort of mission supposed to be your department&#39;s actual thing?

            <p>So, um.<br>Let&#39;s just say that I took a wrong turn trying to get back from our last Ill-Advised Camping Trip O&#39; Doom, and it took me, what, nearly a year to make it to a computer?<br>*heavy sweating*<br>Anyway, hello again! It&#39;s... uh, been a while, hasn&#39;t it? I&#39;m not too sure how long I&#39;ll stick around, but I&#39;ll definitely try to visit the PPC more often! <br>I&#39;ve been up to a lot of stuff during my absence, including a heck of a lot of writing (I&#39;m getting some of my fanfic published in an anthology in a couple of weeks!) and... more writing, I guess? I&#39;ve joined a few fandoms, cried over fictional characters... nothing especially interesting.<br><br>What about you guys? TELL ME EVERYTHING, I WISH TO CATCH UP ON WHAT I HAVE MISSED OUT</p>

            <p>Congrats on the anthology! As for what you missed; the PPC Pokemon Tournament, a handful of newbies and people getting Permission, Blank Sprite chapter 5, the Boarder formerly known as Data Junkie reintroduced herself as Delta Juliette, JulyFlame started work on &quot;Agony In Pink,&quot; a whole big mess involving a ban and Iximaz leaving for a little bit, a Karaoke Night RP over on T-Board (still open), the Purim RP...and two new missions on my end, one of which ended on a non-violent note.</p>

            <p>Once upon a time, a young lad needed a username. Said young lad was unable or unwilling ( I truly can&#39;t remember) to simply use his favorite animal as he had in the past, and so he looked for something new. He had a certain fondness for badgers and a love of Star Wars, and so he combined the two, and the name stuck.<br><br>At least, I think that&#39;s how it happened. <br><br>If anyone is still feeling the translation bug, I wish you luck with this one. If you&#39;d prefer something easier, I have gone by a few other names, most notably WordWolf, Talven, and Talath. I seem to recall Talven being some form of the Finnish word for winter, and I think Talath is the Sindarin word for plain or tundra, so... Wolf of the Wintery Plain, maybe? It&#39;s about the only way I can think of to get something translatable out of all that.</p>

            <p>In Quenya, I will name you <b>Sapalossл</b>, &#39;Digging-White&#39;. The old name <i>brock</i> for badgers derives from the fact that it digs out a hole, and of course Stormtroopers wear white.<br><br>(More literally, you would be <b>Sapala Canta-Atta-Min</b>, which is a bit of a mouthful.)<br><br>In Sindarin, I choose to call you <b>Teithelin</b>, &#39;Mark of the Stars&#39;. The white flash is apparently the root of the word &#39;BADGEr&#39;, and it looks kind of like a star, plus <i>Star Wars</i>. I&#39;ve used archaic/poetic forms of both &#39;mark&#39; (normally <i>taith</i> and &#39;stars&#39; (normally <i>giliath</i>).<br><br>Adunaic is also fairly easy. You are known as <b>Nardurugraba</b>, the Bear-Dog Soldier. This is actually the gender-neutral form of the name; you can choose between masculine <b>Nardurugrabф</b> and feminine <b>Nardurgоrabк</b>, or stick with the original.<br><br>Valarin... well, I&#39;ve been using fire and heat to indicate fighting, so I guess I&#39;ll stick with that. You can be <b>Uruљphelыnфchвr</b>, &#39;Fire of the Dwelling Mound&#39;. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve used &#39;mound&#39; in a name before now. That&#39;s actually quite nice.<br><br>Black Speech... well, badgers are black, right? And Stormtroopers are virtually slaves, particularly in <i>Force Awakens</i>. So it&#39;s only naturally to name you <b>Bъrznaga</b>, the Dark Slave.<br><br>And that&#39;s why giving me the easy option is a waste of time. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

This does seem a bit like a cop-out. The sept I&#39;m keeping, though, and the caste is non-negotiable (Kor is the Air caste, technically, but it&#39;s the caste given to Tau naval personnel, so.), so really it&#39;s only a question of the personal name aspect. Now, I&#39;ve been going by the names on the board, but in Tau culture a personal name is adopted after a string of deeds, rather than given at birth. Therefore, allow me to offer:<br><br><b>Gue&#39;kor&#39;vre Fio&#39;gue Por&#39;vattra&#39;yr</b><br>(Human-Pilot of Earth Water-fleet-experienced)<br><br>Closest I could come to describing naval service in a language from a continuum that doesn&#39;t really <i>do</i> wet navy combat. =]</p>

            <p>In that (my reading of it is, YMMV) they are kind of like micro-pauses in a word to demonstrate the different ideas in a compound word.

            <p>Sort of like KittyEden does, only mine was worse. She was a Black Butler (an anime/manga series) Sue, a Fury, which was a species I made up that was like a demon (canon species) but more powerful, with wings made of unbreakable, flexible adamant (a material whose properties I invented as the need arose). Her lust-object was Sebastian (a demon, one of the main canons; the one <i>everyone</i> lusted after) but nobly set her attraction aside to help him and Grell (another canon) get together... Did I mention she was an RP character? She was fond of the phrase, &quot;Your attack misses because I have/can...&quot; Did I mention the people playing Sebastian and Grell had no interest in getting together? She had to dodge a <i>lot</i> of attacks. <br><br>Fortunately, I realized how terrible she was after one RP. I then elected to write under her name (Erin Alekto) as a constant reminder to never do that again. (I never wrote much though; I preferred reviewing.) But when I arrived at the PPC, an organization devoted to reminding people not to write like that, I didn&#39;t feel like using that name was necessary. But her name was the only username I used at the time. I experimented with combinations of letters, but couldn&#39;t find one I liked. It was getting late. All the names I came up with were starting to look the same: like pure gibberish. Out of frustration I paid a visit to the TV Tropes page for names that sound like they were invented by mashing the keys and my eyes lit upon the title: Cat-on-the-Keyboard Names. The rest is history. <br><br>I&#39;ve come to like it a lot. It lends itself really well to cool-sounding nicknames: the snappy, gender-neutral &quot;Key,&quot; the cute, punnable, femme-but-in-a-comfortable-way &quot;Cat,&quot; and potential for more. Also, I only use it with the PPC, which means i have nothing but positive associations with it. </p>

            <p>My old (oooold) handle was SoulFinder, until I got tired of it and decided I wanted something better. I figure that without all the distracting physical details you basically get people&#39;s inner selves online, and I&#39;ve always tried to be my authentic self besides, so I though just &quot;soul&quot; was appropriate. I went looking around for a cool word with that meaning, and I found this one in a Yiddish-English dictionary in my high school library.

            <p>Okay, so Tau and souls don&#39;t mix terribly well except during the Mont&#39;au period (roughly analogous to the Terror in French history), but you can just about get there with a bit of linguistic jiggery-pokery. And this is a conlang, after all, so linguistic jiggery-pokery is very much the name of the game. =]<br><br>As such, I hope this is to your liking:-<br><br><b>Gue&#39;por&#39;vre Fio&#39;gue Ran&#39;ea&#39;Qim</b><br>(Human-Magister of Earth Spirit-of-the-Void-Within)<br><br>Ea&#39;Qim has a fairly specific meaning; it refers to a practice and desired internal state for followers of the Greater Good, and the best analogy for a human observer is nirvana. Ran is the closest (and fairly folkloric) approximation of the soul, and thus combining the two to imply an embodiment of a noble soul is about the best I can come up for a name with such a specific meaning.<br><br>Also I&#39;m working off a new living Tau&#39;sia lexicon that I literally only found this morning (and the previous ones didn&#39;t even name the Tau language as Tau&#39;sia, which goes to show what a jump it is) so I&#39;ll probably end up redoing some other ones as well. =]</p>

            <p><i>inda</i> is also a word in Quenya (&#39;mood, mind&#39;), but there&#39;s also <i>enda</i>, meaning &#39;centre&#39; and denoting both the mind and the soul. <i>Endawen</i>, then?

            <p>A lesser god in Greek Mythology, Phobos (fear) and his twin brother Deimos (terror) accompanied their father Ares into battle.  I picked up the name from the book &quot;Gates of Fire&quot;, which is about the battle of Thermopylae.  Phobos is the shield piercer.  He breaks defenses better than any spear.<br><br>So, why did I pick that name for myself?  Because, when I play games (Magic: The Gathering is the big one at the moment), I try to break my opponents defenses in that way.  Make them afraid of what my next move might be.  Make them afraid of what I might have in my hand or up my sleeve.  I play a very mental game and my opponents make mistakes because of it.<br><br>If someone were to do a Quenya translation, it probably comes out as something like &quot;Shadow on the Heart/Mind&quot;.<br><br>-Phobos, the Mind Killer</p>

            <p>It compounds as &#39;elen-&#39;, hence, Elengail. You&#39;re right that a native Sindarin speaker would probably use gil instead, making... honestly, I think the best-sounding variant is simply Gil-Gail, you end up with -ln- clusters otherwise. It&#39;s also only two syllables; Sindarin names tend to be about that length, though it&#39;s not a hard rule (Lu-thi-en Ti-nu-vi-el).<br><br>Artalinde, &#39;noble tune&#39;, or poetically &#39;high air&#39;.

On the other hand, Elrond... yeah, Arlind would probably be Artalinde&#39;s translation, unless he got fancy.<br><br>For a native speaker, though, you could get fancy and be <i>Glirarth</i>. That&#39;s &#39;Song-Noble&#39; again... but is also only a couple of letters off from the collective plural for &#39;songs&#39;, <i>glнriath</i>.

            <p>Glirarth works very nicely, much more euphonious than Arlind.<br><br>Come to think of it, terminal -nd does seem to be a Sindarin thing (albeit with time or with casual pronunciation I can see the &#39;d&#39; disappearing): as well as Elrond and Aglarond and Merethrond, we have Mithlond and Harlond.<br><br>Perhaps in colloquial Sindarin in Gondor the pronunciation might have tended to Merethron and Harlon?

            <p>How do you define a &#39;generation&#39; when everyone lives forever, so they&#39;ll all eventually be adults together? Cross-&#39;generational&#39; marriages certainly happened - Eol was kinsman to Thingol, which makes him of the same generation as Finwe, but he married one of Finwe&#39;s granddaughters. Take any random set of elves in peacetime, designate them Generation 1, and after a few hundred years they&#39;ll be so tangled up that it&#39;s meaningless.<br><br>You might be able to argue for it to exist in the sense of &#39;the third generation from Finwe&#39; (ie, his great-grandchildren), but even there, you&#39;re looking at the possibility of remote-cousin intermarriage.<br><br>... also neither language has that word and I can&#39;t think of a way to gloss it. Just work around it, as indeed Tolkien occasionally did - &#39;the children of the fathers of the fathers of men&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As I discovered last time with hS&#39;s name in the language of the happy-go-lucky space Commies, Tau as a conlang is very, very slipshod and approximate. We don&#39;t have much in the way of grammar, but we have words for nuclear reactor, neural feedback (a la <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i>), and for some reason spoon. Since the Tau are also not religious, the Old Hope has had to be approximated with a Tau-acceptable variant - the Greater Good, a quasi-spiritual affair in the rigidly caste-based Tau society wherein everyone works for the benefit of everyone else. This in mind, I hope the following name is acceptable:<br><br><b>Gue&#39;shas&#39;vre Fio&#39;gue Sho&#39;Tauva&#39;Vesa</b><br>(Human-Hero of Earth Sight-Helper-of-the-Greater-Good)<br><br>Tau names are set up thus: caste and rank, sept (homeworld or home system, depending on who you ask), then a personal name. In your case, I tried to incorporate both the &quot;follower of the Old Hope&quot; thing and a reference to a Glimpse - in this case, Sho, meaning sight or lens. I hope it&#39;s okay. =]</p>

            <p>The Tau are a race of blue aliens from Warhammer 40,000, from whence the term grimdark was formed; a long-running tagline for the game (in its various incarnations) is &quot;In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war&quot;. It&#39;s incredibly self-important and overblown, and there are still people who take it 100% seriously. These people are also generally neo-Nazis. Make of this what you will.<br><br>Back when I played it, in 4th Edition, the Tau were a tiny, technologically advanced empire sandwiched between the Imperium of Man (space Nazis, kind of the good guys because almost everyone around them is worse), the Orks (fungus-born space monsters whose ships are literally big rocks powered by belief), and Hive Fleet Kraken of the Tyranids (extragalactic bugs that consume entire biospheres). They were the only empire even remotely tolerable, with their caste-based but largely free society, so of course Games Workshop dialled up the grimdark and made them into hyperzealous space Maoists with a penchant for brainwashing.<br><br>I do not consider it canon. =]<br><br>I should mention that a Shas&#39;vre is a mid-ranking soldier in the Shas military caste (that&#39;s Fire caste in English). If you&#39;re wanting a Tau agent to use that, you can either have them be standard infantry, a Pathfinder (forward ops), or a battlesuit pilot. I&#39;d personally go for the third option, since their actual training will likely be useless unless they were in an XV15 or XV25 Stealth Suit, but it&#39;s up to you. =]</p>

            <p>... so I&#39;ll look to Quenya (surprise, surprise).<br><br>&#39;Estel&#39; is used in Quenya as well as Sindarin, and is still the best translation for the Old Hope; it pretty much means &#39;faith&#39;, though not purely in a religious sense. Since the Old Hope itself is a Mannish belief, and the only source for it (Andreth) isn&#39;t a believer herself, it doesn&#39;t have a proper translation. So, in fact, <b>Estelwen</b> works just as well in Quenya as Sindarin.<br><br>To drag in the A- names, we need to look at <i>alme</i>, <i>almie</i>, and <i>almare</i>, all words meaning &#39;blessedness&#39;. Almiel is apparently an attested name, but <b>Almariel</b>, &#39;maiden of bliss&#39;, would work.<br><br>For warriors we want &#39;ohtar&#39;, giving us a possibility of <b>Almehtar</b> (&#39;Bliss-Warrior&#39;). And &#39;mehtar&#39; is another word for warrior anyway. If this name was &#39;Alamehtar&#39; it would mean &#39;not a warrior&#39;, so it probably carries overtones of &#39;I wish this fighting was not necessary, but I will do it&#39;.<br><br>For &#39;follower of the One&#39;, I&#39;ll concur with Elcalion&#39;s point: no Elda would use the name of the One in a personal name. The only place I can think of that it was habitually used was in marriage vows, and you remember how utterly permanent those were. Same for the Oath of Feanor.<br><br>So... &#39;Aina&#39; means &#39;Holy&#39;, and is used in one name of the One, <i>Ainatar</i> (&#39;Holy Father&#39;). There&#39;s a word <i>tirno</i>, which means &#39;watcher&#39;, so how about <b>Ainatiriл</b>? It really needs an n in the middle (Ainantirie) for grammatic reasons, but that&#39;s ugly, so I didn&#39;t. ^_^<br><br>I&#39;ve also coined the term <i>tirisaina</i>, which means &#39;holy vigil&#39;. Sounds like the sort of thing a warrior of the Old Hope would carry out.<br><br>Now for a quick excursion into less savory tongues.<br><br>In the much maligned Valarin, I would call you Aювraruљur, &#39;<b>Appointed Flame</b>&#39;; the &#39;appointed&#39; is used of the Sun and of Arda, so works for &#39;Divinely appointed&#39;; &#39;fire&#39; is standing in for &#39;warrior&#39;, since while we have the names of the two warrior Valar, Tulukhastвz just means &#39;yellow-haired&#39;, and Arфmкz has no inherent meaning (helpful, that). If you want to really pile on the divinity (and syllables), you could be <b>Aювraruљurakaљвn</b>, literally &#39;Appointed-fire-the One says&#39;, but colloqially &#39;Chosen Warrior of/by the Word&#39;. A-thar-a-RUS-ur-a-ka-san seems to be the most natural way to say it.<br><br>Adunaic makes my head hurt, but has the word &#39;minul&#39; for &#39;heaven&#39;. If you wanted to be <b>Minulzir</b>, &#39;Lover of Heaven&#39;, you could be; you could also be <b>Narduminul</b>, &#39;Heaven&#39;s Soldier&#39;. Minulzir sounds like quite a nice name, as Adunaic names go.<br><br>And so we come to the Black Speech. Its speakers have no truck with the One: they know only Melkor. And they have no willing followers. You are <b>Burznaga</b>, &#39;slave of the Dark&#39;.<br><br>... which is a tiny rebellion in itself, because the story of the Awakening of Men tells of the quiet voice in the darkness that tried to sway the people away from the Dark Rider they had chosen to follow...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;Amdir&quot; is hope in the sense of &quot;expectation, optimism&quot; (literally means something like &quot;upward-looking&quot;), while &quot;Estel&quot; is hope in the sense of &quot;trust&quot;.<br><br>Usual female endings are &quot;-(r)iel&quot; (garlanded-maiden) or &quot;-wen&quot; (woman).<br><br>Warrior - there&#39;s a couple of variants, some of which are chiefly used for orcs and other &quot;enemies&quot;, so the best would be &quot;maethor&quot; (warrior) or &quot;magor&quot; (swordsman), which will mutate into &quot;-vagor&quot; under certain conditions (I&#39;m not 100% with Sindarin lenition).<br><br>So &quot;she of the Old Hope&quot; would probably best be &quot;Estelwen&quot; (using the &#39;Estel&#39; option as best fitting Old Hope) (Esteliel sounds a bit strange to my ear). Alternatively, could go with &quot;Amdiriel&quot; which has the alliterative-&#39;A&#39; bonus, but uses &quot;lesser&quot; hope.<br><br>&quot;Warrior of the old hope&quot; would probably be &quot;Estelva(e)thor&quot; or &quot;Estelvagor&quot; [fairly sure that the m would lenit to v, since it did in the similar Menelvagor&quot; (Swordsman of the Sky), the Sindarin name for the constellation Orion].<br><br>&quot;Follower of Eru&quot; would be something like &quot;Erudil&quot; or &quot;Erudur&quot;, but neither would likely be an &quot;appropriate&quot; Elvish name, as there was quite a strong... well, &#39;taboo&#39; is probably too strong a word, but &#39;respectful caution&#39; placed on use of the name of The One, so incorporating it into a personal name would be unlikely. <br><br>&quot;Amandil&quot; or &quot;Amandur&quot; (friend/servant/follower of Aman/ - literally the Blessed Realm, but used by Tolkien as &#39;heaven&#39;) are legitimate names (Elendil&#39;s father was Amandil) and would probably be the closest that an Elf would get to including Eru in a personal name.<br><br>Elcalion, translatory</p>

            <p>In Sindarin, you could be Celuladhad - &#39;celu&#39; is &#39;a spring&#39;, and the verb &#39;gladha-&#39; (to laugh) mutates to &#39;ladha in compounds, and gains a -d to make it a gerund.

            <p><i>Techno-Dann</i> has been with me for a very long time - it was my first online handle, and the PPC was one of the first places I used it... thirteen years ago? Gosh, I feel old.<br><br>It was... hmm. Superhero name as invented by an idealess (and very pre-social-justice) fifteen year old? &quot;Dann&quot; borrows from the Redwall series, as I&#39;m sure people who&#39;ve read <i>Marlfox</i> have figured. (First fandom cred!)<br><br>More recently, <i>Delta Juliette</i> started life as a name I used to start to get away from the very gendered reading I had of Techno-Dann. It&#39;s very much a zero-imagination name: my IRL initials are DJ, and I&#39;m leaning towards a direct transliteration of my name when it changes - Daniel James will become Danielle Juliette. It&#39;s also quietly transfeminine - &quot;Delta&quot; being used in math and physics to denote change, and &quot;Juliette&quot; being a very femme name.</p>

            <p>Although I seem to remember hearing something about some Glimpses having a slight cast to their skin; I&#39;d check, but I only own the series as audiobooks, so it would take too long.<br><br>It is a good series. I heartily recommend the audiobooks--the author himself narrates them, and does a pretty good job of it. <br><br>The &quot;YA&quot; part of it is really just the fact that the protagonists are teenagers--there&#39;s very little romance, and no love triangles. It&#39;s an adventure story first and foremost, I think. You should read them because <s>I NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO ABOUT THEM</s> they&#39;re quite good!<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>is a series of three games: LISA the First, LISA the Painful, and Painful&#39;s rather short DLC sequel and ultimate end to the series: LISA the Joyful. <br><br>The First was made ages back, and is pretty much an entirely different type of game - it&#39;s only real relevance is backstory for the other games. <br>Just, er, put it to the side, if you will. <br><br>LISA the Painful is about Brad Armstrong: balding, chubby failure of a man trying to rescue last woman alive in a post-genderpocalypse world, who happens to be his adopted daughter. <br>It gets quite a bit more complex than that, of course, and has got some of the greyest morality I&#39;ve seen in my life. <br>It jumps between bizarre (and usually dark) humour, horror, and horrific depression gloriously. <br>Many a mature topic is tackled, and they&#39;re all done with the subtlety and, er, maturity they deserve. It goes on about &#39;disgust&#39; and &#39;moral destruction,&#39; but it never really feels awful or mean-spirited, y&#39;know? <br>Just feels... rough. Real. <br>It has bloody good music and an amazing ending. <br><br>LISA the Joyful is about said adopted daughter: Buddy, who is a wondrous deconstruction of the Chosen One archetype. <br>It has bloody good-er music and an even more amazing ending. <br><br>It&#39;s also got one of my favourite protagonists* of all time. <br>What can I say? <br>I like my main characters broken and pathetic. <br>The games are hilarious and they also made me cry. <br>Seriously, that ending. <br>Good heavens. <br><br>Got a link to the website <a href="http://www.lisatherpg.com/index.html">here.</a><br>It&#39;s very weird. <br><br><br><br>*Note that I never said &#39;hero&#39;</p>

            <p>When I was, like, 10, I was a fanfic reader and I read this admittedly really terrible Artemis Fowl fic (but I honestly loved it at the time), and at one point the writer, who I remember as being really nice and friendly, asked for some OCs to put into his story. Now, I, as an excited 10-year-old, was basically like &quot;hell yeah!&quot; and I immediately typed out the profile of a kick-ass centaur girl who loved inventing stuff and carried around a water pistol that shot acid. But I didn&#39;t have a name for her, so I went, &quot;um....um......&quot; and just threw out &#39;Kitty Eden&#39; for no particular reason. Fast forward to a few weeks later, and &#39;Kitty&#39; had made her way into one of my (again, terrible) fanfictions. And at some point I guess I must have adopted the name for my own internet purposes. It seemed to fit, anyway, since my username is &#39;TheBigCat&#39; on fanfiction.net and a lot of other places. :P <br><br>So yeah.</p>

            <p>I should probably copy my answer for repeats of this thread, but meh, I like telling the story.<br><br>So! I&#39;m a big RPG nerd, be it tabletop or MMORPGs, and the very first MMORPG I ever played was <i>Runescape</i>. This was back in the day when you actually got to choose your username instead of being forced to pick one provided by the game, and I decided there was no way I wanted to be CamelotOrc3327 or whatever the number was (The CamelotOrc bit really stuck in my mind; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever forget that.), no way, no how. I wanted a <i>name</i> name, dangit!<br><br>The only problem was that anything resembling a real name would be caught by the censors and not be allowed, so I played around with some sounds and letters before coming up with Iximaz. <br><br>Look, I was twelve, it sounded like a cool name at the time. Stop laughing. :P<br><br>Iximaz ended up becoming my online name for just about everything else, and though I ended up abandoning <i>Runescape</i> in favor of <i>World of Warcraft</i>, I kept the name Iximaz as my account name there. Not to mention I named my hunter character that as well, in memory of the first Iximaz, who would spend hours shooting at hill giants from behind the safety of a stalagmite wall they couldn&#39;t seem to cross.<br><br>Good times, good times...</p>

            <p><i>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</i> is one of my favorite books of all time, and it&#39;s associated with one of my favorite memories from childhood (my older cousin trying to explain the Infinite Improbability Drive to seven-year-old me). Plus it has the words &quot;Don&#39;t Panic&quot; printed on the cover in large friendly letters. In honor of this day, I carried my towel with me everywhere, drew fanart over Snapchat and freaked out about the beauty of the <i>Guide</i> to everyone who held still long enough. I will restrain myself here <s>because I&#39;m a little tired out</s>. I have photos I took of my towel and my stupid/evil fanart which I would very much like to show you, but I can&#39;t figure out how to add them. . . I&#39;m guessing that Photobucket isn&#39;t as good of a choice as it first appears to be?<br><br>Oh, and since we&#39;re a fanfic (critique) community: Is <i>So Long and Thanks for All The Fish</i> the best author response to fanfic ever or <i>what</i>?<br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>I mean, I&#39;m not sure if my aging computer will be able to take it, but I still find the changes they&#39;ve shown so far to be very interesting and compelling. I like how clean the UI looks, and the idea of actions helping to boost research is really neat. Also, speaking as someone who has been scoped out of more than one Wonder, the idea of limited building tiles is growing on me. No more AI cities with 12 stacked Wonders.<br><br>I&#39;m fine with the way the game looks. <i>Civilization IV</i> was super cartoony and I loved it. The one graphics-related gripe I have is in regard to how Theodore Roosevelt was portrayed. He looks way too hefty (although that might just be because they went with a reference of older Roosevelt).<br><br>Final note: this really shouldn&#39;t need to be stated (&#39;cause it&#39;s YouTube and all), but don&#39;t read the comments. SO much complaining.</p>

            <p>Yes, I listen to music while doing both, but more with writing than reading. I get stressed out when writing sometimes, and music helps keep me focused and relaxed. It&#39;s also useful for setting a tone for a scene.<br><br>When writing I prefer music without lyrics that matches the tone of what I&#39;m writing, usually movie soundtracks or classical music. When I read I usually just find something in my music library that fits what I&#39;m reading.<br><br>Sometimes. I can get lost in the story and just start seeing it while I read, but I also like to sit back and appreciate the language of the book. <br><br>Usually. It may not always be particularly bright color, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s there.<br><br>Only fragments if I don&#39;t write them down. I keep a journal of the really interesting or weird ones, and ever since I started they&#39;ve grown easier and easier to remember.<br><br>I&#39;ve only ever had one, and it was more of nightmare. Suffice it to say being chased by velociraptors is equally terrifying the second time around.<br><br>Only rarely with people I know well, but with acquaintances or strangers I sometimes just need to get away.<br><br>Certain aspects of history, art, and a some more basic science.<br><br><br>Well, that was fun.</p>

            <p><b>Do you read/write while listening to music? </b><br><br>Sometimes. I find that a little music here and there can provide inspiration for a writing scene or something— as if I write to capture a mood behind a song. I can&#39;t read or write if the song has got lyrics that I can understand, though. It&#39;s too distracting.<br><br><b>If you do, do you read/write with a specific genre?</b><br><br>When writing action scenes, I usually listen to some sort of battle music from some game or the other. For example, a hand-to-hand fight scene might by inspired by, say, the latest DOOM&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liRMh4LzQQU">BFG Division</a>. <br><br>For reading, I usually put something calm in the background. Nothing specific.<br><br><b>When you read a book, do you pretty much fully hallucinate and forget that you&#39;re reading a book?</b><br><br>Like moviemode? Yeah, that happens all the time. But I&#39;m still, y&#39;know. Reading. I never forget that I&#39;m holding the book in my hands and reading words off a page.<br><br><b>Do you dream in color?</b><br><br>I honestly can&#39;t remember the last time I dreamt. Must&#39;ve been well over 5 years or something. I did dream in colour, way back when.<br><br><b>Do you remember your dreams?</b><br><br>Well, if I can&#39;t even recall the last time I dreamt...<br><br><b>Do you have recurring dreams?</b><br><br>Guess not.<br><br><b>When doing social things, do you sometimes need a break? </b><br><br>Well, I can&#39;t exactly keep on talking to someone for hours and hours and hours, can I? In all seriousness, I&#39;m more of an introverted type, but one who likes to chat. It&#39;s strange. <br><br><b>Which school subjects come easily to you? </b><br><br>Mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, languages, and history. I&#39;m so-so at anything involving physical activity and I utterly despise arts and music. <br><br>Absolutely useless subjects. Why must my painting be graded and my music be evaluated?

            <p>1) It seems that there&#39;s a large amount of introverts here. Truly surprising.<br>2) I&#39;d argue that you can objectively tell good art from bad. I&#39;d also argue that forcing people to make art is idiotic since not everybody has the talent, will or energy to do so. Grading them on that is even more idiotic.</p>

            <p>Or not. Well-chosen answers.<br><br>1. Music is almost a constant when writing, less so when reading - but even then, I&#39;m frequently listening to something.<br><br>2. Soundtrack music! Epic-ish, orchestral, no vocals - I want something I can feel without having words to distract me.<br><br>3. I&#39;m about halfway there? I picture things vividly, but I don&#39;t lose track of the reality of the book.<br><br>4. Yes! I dream in color. Usually. I&#39;ve had a couple very black-and-white dreams that I can recall, but black-and-white was part of their nature, not a normal thing.<br><br>5. Sometimes - depends on the dream, and the night. I&#39;ll often only wake up with fragments, scattered scenes and images.<br><br>6. I only very rarely have recurring dreams. I&#39;ll fairly frequently revisit locations from previous dreams (for example, I&#39;ve got a fairly consistent not!Seattle running around my headspace), but exact replays are a rarity. When they do happen, they&#39;re frequently back-to-back, with more intense stuff - I&#39;ll wake from a nightmare, drift back to sleep, and the whole thing starts over again from the top.<br><br>7. I am a massive introvert, with a side of autism-spectrum! Social stuff is fun, but it takes energy, and some days I have less energy to spend than others.<br><br>8. Math and computer science, especially the more visual maths, come really easy for me - I had a graph theory course in college that everyone else complained about incessantly - I 4.0ed it without even trying.</p>

            <p><i>Do you read/write while listening to music?</i><br>Very rarely while writing, and never anything with vocals. Never while reading. I have a tendency to focus too much on the music and not on the actual task. <br><br><i>If you do, do you read/write with a specific genre?</i><br>I try to pick music that&#39;s thematically appropriate for what I&#39;m writing. So jazz and blues for something detective-y and noir, for example, or ragtime for a turn-of-the-century tale. I might change the music depending on the scene as well. If the climax in big and dramatic, the music should fit that.<br><br><i>When you read a book, do you pretty much fully hallucinate (can&#39;t think of a better word) and forget that you&#39;re reading a book? (Like, you don&#39;t realize you&#39;re reading words. You just have the pictures in your head)</i><br>Sort of. I do imagine what&#39;s going on in my head, but I&#39;m always cognizant of the fact that I&#39;m reading a book. I will occasionally go back and reread sections, or even put the book down for a little bit to mull over the most recent event.<br><br><i>Do you dream in color?</i><br>Yes.<br><br><i>Do you remember your dreams?</i><br>Rarely. It&#39;s more common if it&#39;s a dream that pops up again and again, or if it&#39;s a dream inspired by something in the real world. If I read a bunch of books in a series or play one game for a long period of time, chances are I might dream something about those subjects.<br><br><i>Do you have recurring dreams?</i><br>As I mentioned in the last one, I do. Unfortunately, they&#39;re almost always nonsensical stress dreams. Typically I&#39;m back in college, struggling with courses that I would have never taken in real life (typically high-level mathematics or something).<br><br><i>When doing social things, do you sometimes need a break?</i><br>Yes. I&#39;m not good in large groups, particularly with people I don&#39;t know all that well. Eventually my social reserves run dry in such circumstances and I leave for the privacy of my own home.<br><br><i>Which school subjects come easily to you?</i><br>History and literature/English. </p>

I don&#39;t stick to one genre overall with my music but I do prefer something fast and exciting with a good beat while I&#39;m trying to write.<br>When you read a book...<br>Sometimes I can become so absorbed I don&#39;t think that I&#39;m actually reading anymore so I think the answer here is yes. But it doesn&#39;t happen every time so...<br>Dream in color?<br>Yes<br>Remember your dreams?<br>Sometimes. I&#39;ll go for periods of no dreams but then I&#39;ll start remembering them.<br>Recurring dreams?<br>Maybe? I dont really have dreams that REPEAT themselves but I do have recurring themes, locations, situations, etc. Kind of like sequel dreams.<br>Social things?<br>Yes! I&#39;m definitely an introvert that needs to recharge.<br>School subjects?<br>Uh, writing and English I&#39;m good at. I also am a steady hand at Statistics.</p>

            <p><b>Do you read/write while listening to music?</b><br><br>When reading?  Absolutely not.  It&#39;s impossible for me to concentrate on the Words if other Words are being thrown into my ears.  Even lyric-less music is way too distracting, since my brain then tries to follow along with the notes.<br><br>When writing?  I . . . can.  I usually wouldn&#39;t, but sometimes if I&#39;m writing a mission or regular fan story, I&#39;ll listen to something off a related soundtrack.  Again, it cannot be something with lyrics, or they will distract me from the words I&#39;m trying to put down.  (I do remember in school I could listen to lyric songs while working on nonfiction essays and such, and it often made me work faster.  But that&#39;s because I had no emotional investment in those . . . things.<br><br><b>If you do, do you read/write with a specific genre?</b><br><br>Again, same-universe soundtrack or nothing.<br><br><b>When you read a book, do you pretty much fully hallucinate (can&#39;t think of a better word) and forget that you&#39;re reading a book? (Like, you don&#39;t realize you&#39;re reading words. You just have the pictures in your head)</b><br><br>Very, very, very much.  When I&#39;m reading, there is no doctorlit anymore, no more background, only what&#39;s happening on the page—only it&#39;s not a page, it&#39;s a world.<br><br>A particularly jerkish student at my high school commented once, as I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_(Koontz_novel)">an assigned novel</a> at lunch, that I &quot;read slow.&quot;  (He should have said slowly, of course.  Tsk, tsk, and at a prep school, too!)  I guess the whole visualization thing makes me slower?  Although I can&#39;t imagine that most people read by skimming; I prefer to believe he was just being a jerk, as per usual.<br><br><b>Do you dream in color?</b><br><br>*remembers dreaming about branches with green leaves being in the animal food fridge last night*<br>CONFIRMED<br><br><b>Do you remember your dreams?</b><br><br>*remembers remembering*<br>CONFIRMED<br><br><b>Do you have recurring dreams?</b><br><br>You know, it hasn&#39;t happened in years, and I don&#39;t remember the actual events anymore, but I do remember having sequels to previous dreams when I was younger, sometimes years apart.  When I was particularly young, I kept having dreams about skeletal zombies being pretty much everywhere around me.  Fun times.<br><br><b>When doing social things, do you sometimes need a break?</b><br><br>Psh.  I need <i>mostly</i> break.  With all the time I spend at work, I want nothing more than being home alone at my computer during off time.  I&#39;m at the point where I don&#39;t even want to hang out with family or friends anymore, just because it ruins my alone time.  I do feel guilty about it, but I just really, really need to be alone.<br><br><b>Which school subjects come easily to you?</b><br><br>My best subjects overall were generally literature courses and science courses, although there were exceptions both ways.  Organic chemistry, physics and biochemistry were terrible, because they&#39;re only barely science and wildly uninteresting to me.  English classes for me were an excuse to get reading for homework, and then BS some nonsense for the essays/exams for grades.  But sometimes, I would get a teacher who ruined it for me by wanting us to be far more analytical of themes and metaphor and such than I tend to be when I read.  Reading is only for entertainment, people!<br><br>—doctorlit needs to start breakfast now </p>

            <p><i>Do you read/write while listening to music? If you do, do you read/write with a specific genre?</i><br>Never while I&#39;m reading (see the question about books and hallucination; I often do the same thing while listening to music and my mind picks one to focus on), unless the story mentions a song which I don&#39;t know well, in which case I&#39;ll look it up and listen to it while or before I read the next passage. While writing, sometimes but not usually; it&#39;s a bit distracting. At the very least, the music seeps into what I&#39;m writing. Sometimes one of my characters will actually listen to, sing, or dance to the song I&#39;m listening to (e.g. every story I wrote in middle school). So I tend not to listen to music, unless I badly need inspiration (e.g. the horror story I wrote while listening to Metallica&#39;s &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; on repeat. It has the same mood as the song, and some of the same phrasing as the lyrics).<br><br>However, I need a certain level of ambient noise in order to focus on writing, so if I&#39;m home alone I&#39;ll put on hard rock, heavy metal, or anything loud and energetic with lyrics that are unintelligible or don&#39;t create a world I can get distracted by (Rammstein&#39;s my current favorite thanks to TOS. And yes, Jay, I know there are other German metal bands in the world, but most of the other ones I like have lyrics I know well).<br><br><i>When you read a book, do you pretty much fully hallucinate (can&#39;t think of a better word) and forget that you&#39;re reading a book? (Like, you don&#39;t realize you&#39;re reading words. You just have the pictures in your head)</i><br>Sometimes this happens, yes. Pictures and these pseudo-sound things which don&#39;t sound like sounds or the memory of sounds, they&#39;re just the sounds thoughts makes in my mind (there are textures that work the same way. Also mimic-emotions that are shadows of what the characters are feeling. Taste and smell are less common). And not just when I&#39;m reading a book, it also happens when I&#39;m writing, when I&#39;m texting or otherwise sending messages, when I&#39;m thinking about something (although in a less orderly way), and even when I&#39;m listening to music or talking on the phone (just pictures, no reading-sounds). Because of this, I like watching movies or other kinds of video/animation much less than other media: I can&#39;t see my own images or my thought-sounds, so I sometimes get the unnerving impression that I&#39;m not thinking, like my mind is turned down, even when I&#39;m thinking very hard to follow the plot or the themes. <br><br><i>Do you dream in color?</i><br>Yes, and in all five senses, although I remember sight the best.<br><br><i>Do you remember your dreams?</i><br>Yes, but not very well or with any consistency. I remember them better if I write them down, mime writing them down in the air, or otherwise repeat key points to myself.<br><br><i>Do you have recurring dreams?</i><br>No. I&#39;ve dreamed that I have recurring dreams, though. I had one dream where I thought I knew what was going to happen because I&#39;d had the dream before and therefore could control it, but when I woke up I realized I&#39;d never had the dream before and had zero control.<br><br>Sometimes I have recurring <i>characters</i> in my dreams, though, all boys. (Girls are either me, generic, or one-time. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve had dreams where I didn&#39;t have a gender, but if something is missing in my dreams, I don&#39;t notice it at all and in my memory default to whatever generic is for that thing.) The most notable of these was a series of three dreams when I was about nine years old where I was this superhero guy. He had that standard superhero tight-fitting suit (which never itched, for some reason; I bet that was one of his superpowers) and cape, both red. Over the course of the dreams I learned that he had many enemies, my same little sister, and a girlfriend named Rebecca. The worldbuilding was decent, but the plots were pretty pointless -- much like my writing in fourth grade, come to think of it. <br><br><i>When doing social things, do you sometimes need a break?</i><br>Only if I&#39;m doing social things for really long periods of time or if it&#39;s early in the morning. I definitely need time to myself, but I don&#39;t usually need to interrupt socializing to do so. I think of myself as a mild introvert or an ambivert, although personality quizzes often tell me I&#39;m more extroverted (I hate personality quizzes; I&#39;m not sure why I take them).<br><br><i>Which school subjects come easily to you?</i><br>Math, Spanish (my foreign language), and Acting. History isn&#39;t easy, but it&#39;s fun, so I work on it in my spare time, so when I get to class it seems like it&#39;s coming pretty easily. English (writing, analysis) is the same as history, but it comes a little easier than history (or else I&#39;ve worked on it more in the past; I can&#39;t tell at this point). Visual art is the opposite: it comes easily to me, but I have almost no interest in it, so my drawing style is almost exactly the same as it was in sixth grade, the last year when Art classes were mandatory. Science used to come easily when it was just about analysis and basically structured the same way as history, but now it&#39;s also about understanding all these weird processes and that part only comes sort of okay. It&#39;ll probably be even worse next year when I take Biology. Music is in the middle. P.E. is dead last. Socializing (which I was graded on in elementary school and still think of as a subject) used to be dead last, but I&#39;ve (laboriously) developed some habits that make it more natural and even enjoyable.<br><br><b><u>My Questions for You All</u><br>Do you ever dream you&#39;re someone other than yourself?<br>Do you ever dream you&#39;re a gender other than your own?</b></p>

            <p>I usually don&#39;t notice / remember what I look like in my dreams - it&#39;s not something that sticks with me frequently. However, I can&#39;t remember having a dream in which I&#39;m not some reflection or version of myself - I am me, awake or asleep. That self is sometimes very different from reality (I had one fairly recently where I was a robot girl), but in-context, it&#39;s always me.<br><br>As far as gender goes, though - that&#39;s a much harder question to answer. I was assigned male at birth, lived that way for a reasonable length of time, and while I&#39;m now genderfluid through three-ish genders that don&#39;t include masculinity, I&#39;m still early enough in my transition that I can pass as a guy without much work. So, &quot;genders other than my own&quot; is a surprisingly small set of options... Overt masculinity has never really been a perception of self in my dreams, and that&#39;s been consistent since well before I started digging in to gender stuff. Aside from that, though, sometimes I&#39;m as I am, sometimes I&#39;m as I wish I was, sometimes I&#39;m in between, and very frequently, the shape of my body just doesn&#39;t come up.</p>

<li>Yes.<br>2. Previously, I read a lot of Fantasy books, but now, they have all concluded, so I have pretty much stopped reading. However, I listen to music with a sort of final tone to it, as in something that prepares me for a climax all the way.<br>3. No, I remain fully grounded in reality, sadly.<br>4. Yes, I dream in colour, sometimes. Usually in darker colours, though.<br>5. Yes, I remember my dreams.<br>6. I have had recurring dreams before, like designs for Super Paper Mario Levels.<br>7. Yes, I need to take a break from social things sometimes.<br>8. I sadly cannot answer this question competently.</li>

<li>Sometimes, but when I&#39;m writing I sometimes find it&#39;s too much stimulation and makes my brain get tired faster.<br><br>2. When I do, I usually like a combination of movie/game scores, New Age, world music, and other stuff that&#39;s stirring without being too distracting. Nothing with lyrics; or if there are lyrics, they can&#39;t be in English.<br><br>3. Nope, just standard visualization here.<br><br>4. Oh yes; I am an extremely vivid dreamer. I get color, sensation, sound—including music, rarely including tunes I&#39;m pretty sure I made up (though I&#39;ve never been able to remember them long enough to write them down after the fact)—and sometimes even taste/smell, too. When my dreams have plots, which they occasionally do, it can be kind of like being in a movie.<br><br>Sometimes I come close to being aware that I&#39;m dreaming, too, but I haven&#39;t quite mastered lucid dreaming. It&#39;s fun when, within a dream, I notice and get worried about things that don&#39;t make sense; or when I resist getting involved with someone because I&#39;m married, and I&#39;ve got my rings on to prove it. ^_^<br><br>5. Nearly always, at least for the following day. Sometimes I deliberately hang on to the more interesting ones as story fuel. (Wanna meet the cast of my next NaNovel? Met them in a dream just a couple nights ago, and I&#39;ve been working on fleshing them out since.)<br><br>6. I don&#39;t often repeat events in my dreams, but I do sometimes revisit settings. They tend to be based on real places, like my grandparents&#39; house, but not always. There&#39;s a creepy mad science and/or haunted mansion I&#39;ve been to a few times.<br><br>7. Yeah, I&#39;m pretty much 100% an introvert. Sometimes I use bathroom breaks as social breaks, too.<br><br>8. Reading and writing were always easy for me in the sense that when I do them I am naturally good at them. I&#39;ve always hated writing school papers and homework in general, though, so I&#39;m not sure that counts for your question. Besides English, I always enjoyed and did really well in biology, anatomy &amp; physiology, and other science subjects without too much math in them. (Plus electives like choir and art.)<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p><i>Do you read/write while listening to music?</i><br> When I was a kid, I didn’t understand how my brother could do homework while listening to music. I couldn’t; I always needed a quiet place. Over time, I adapted and am now often able to read and write while my wife listens to music or watches TV in the same room. But I don’t listen; I ignore the noise.<br><br><i>When you read a book, do you pretty much fully hallucinate (can&#39;t think of a better word) and forget that you&#39;re reading a book?</i><br>No, I’m always aware of the words, unless I space out and immerge into my own dream while still moving my eyes, until I realize that I don’t know what really happened in the last three paragraphs and have to read them again.<br><br><i>Do you dream in color?</i><br>Maybe? I don’t remember such details.<br><br><i>Do you remember your dreams?</i><br>Sometimes, but I forget most details within minutes after waking up and only vaguely remember a theme like &quot;I was back in a place where I lived years ago&quot; or just &quot;it was really weird and illogical&quot;.<br><br><i>Do you have recurring dreams?</i><br>Not recently, but I still remember the themes of some recurring nightmares I had many years ago:<ul>
<br><li>Coming home from school, but being unable to find the house where my family lived<br>
</li>
<li>Trying to wash my hands, but some really weird and complex plumbing has been mounted to the water tap so that the water will flow to the floor rather than into the sink, and I can’t remove it.<br>
</li>
<li>Waking up and trying to switch the light on, but it doesn’t work and the room stays dark<br>
</li>
</ul>
<br><br><i>When doing social things, do you sometimes need a break?</i> <br>Often. That’s why I mostly avoid doing social things.<br><br><i>Which school subjects come easily to you?</i><br>I’ve been out of school for decades, but as far as I remember I liked physics (no other sciences), history and geography best.

            <p>Q: Do you read/write while listening to music? <br>A: Sometimes; it depends on the mood I&#39;m in and what I&#39;m reading/writing.<br><br>Q: If you do, do you read/write with a specific genre?<br>A: Nah, my tastes are all over the place. Though I do have a marked preference for fandom music and alt rock.<br><br>Q: When you read a book, do you pretty much fully hallucinate (can&#39;t think of a better word) and forget that you&#39;re reading a book?<br>A: All the freaking time. It annoys the heck out of my family because they can be standing next to me shouting my name and I won&#39;t even notice they&#39;re there until they take the book away.<br><br>Q: Do you dream in color?<br>A: All the time; it surprised me to learn some don&#39;t.<br><br>Q: Do you remember your dreams?<br>A: Only the really fun or really scary ones. I can still remember a few nightmares I had when I was seven, along with a dream that I found my way into Hogwarts through the vacuum closet not long after. Most of the other ones I remember involve playing Quidditch, flying a TARDIS, or moving to England.<br><br>Q: Do you have recurring dreams?<br>A: Ehhh... sometimes. On occasion I&#39;ll have the same dream or some variation on it for a few nights in a row before my brain moves off of replay.<br><br>Q: When doing social things, do you sometimes need a break? <br>A: Oh yeah. Even if it&#39;s just me and one other friend, I need a break after a few hours because I need time to myself and start to feel trapped otherwise. I... don&#39;t do too well at sleepovers and big parties for a reason. :/<br><br>Q: Which school subjects come easily to you? <br>A: Um... *racks brains* Not really any of them, to be honest. I&#39;m absolutely terrible at anything involving numbers and although certain branches of science <i>interest</i> me, when it comes to the details I start to get bored and tune out. History is just a bunch of date memorization which I find extremely boring, and my English teachers don&#39;t like me because my writing is much more informal than they want for essays and I have an extremely hard time reining it in. <br><br>Though now that I think about it, I did really well in my art history class my first semester, and I enjoyed poking holes in theories presented by my philosophy professor. (He still hasn&#39;t gotten back to me on a question I asked. Grr.) So... yay subjects that no future employer cares about save for museum curators?<br><br></p>

            <p>Do you read/write while listening to music?<br><br>-I do.  I listen to instrumental music while I write.  It helps block out the rest of the world. <br><br>If you do, do you read/write with a specific genre?<br><br>-Not particularly.  I move from anime music to video game music (from Chrono Trigger to Skyrim) to piano/cello music (often with a rock base).

            <p>That was until I ended up falling through that manhole and face-planting in the sewer. I still can&#39;t get the sepsis out of my eyes, but there was at least a good thing about that incident: I got myself a rat following. Well, a swarm of rats went after me - hoping they could turn me into some exquisite soup of the day, no doubt - and I was thankful to have found that cigarette lighter. The ensuing carnage left me with second-degree burns on all of my limbs, sure, but by the time it was over, the rats that survived began worshiping me like some kind of ancient rat god. I don&#39;t know how or why, but I&#39;ll take what I can get.<br><br>It helped that when Fred landed on top of me and turned me into a grease stain, they resurrected me through prayer. I kinda hope nobody gets the idea to start calling me Lord Cheesus, though. ^^;</p>

            <p>So let me set the scene for you:<br><br>Phone: RING RING RIIIIING!<br><br>Huinesoron: wflgbt<br><br>Phone: RIIIIIIIIIIIING!<br><br>Clock: The time, is, half past, four, ay emm!<br><br>Huinesoron: [Stumbles downstairs]<br><br>Phone: RI-RI-RI-RIIII-<br><br>Huinesoron: Wha&#39;?<br><br>KittyEden, sounding out of breath and nearly drowned out by splashing: Hey! How do you feel about hosting the next PPC Camping Trip?<br><br>Huinesoron: … when?<br><br>KittyEden: [Very long silence]<br><br>Kaitlyn: hS, you need to come and see this…<br><br>Huinesoron: [Stumbles upstairs; looks out the window; stares at the gigantic aircraft carrier currently attempting to sail up onto the bank of the Thames]<br><br>So apparently when the American lot chose July to drive their ship, they also let her pick one… she at least had the decency to paint it black.<br><br>Since we were waiting for KittyEden, Kaitlyn and I had to find space for everyone to sleep for the next few days. So, to everyone who had to sleep in the shed, the loft, the bathtub, and especially the cot: sorry. (Though you three in the latter need to stop complaining: if we hadn&#39;t put the bars back on you would have fallen out, no?)<br><br>That&#39;s why people weren&#39;t overjoyed to see you, by the way: they&#39;d been sleeping stacked three-high.<br><br>So we picked our destination, packed into Chitty Chitty Space Warp, and then everyone looked confused until I pointed out that we could just follow the railway - the Eurostar goes straight to Paris, after all.<br><br>And no, I didn&#39;t actually mean we should fly <i>through the Channel Tunnel</i>. Or that the correct answer to &#39;they have trains down here&#39; was &#39;turn the lights off, then they won&#39;t see us!&#39;. Thanks, eatpraylove, for knocking ten years off my life.<br><br>Unlike KittyEden, I know exactly how we got lost - once it comes out of the tunnel, the Eurostar goes to either Paris or <i>Brussels</i>. But I was busy playing PPC Munchkin with N. Harmonik and EileenAlphabet, so I didn&#39;t realise we&#39;d gone the wrong way - or that when MochiIsAwesome called out &#39;just keep going south, we&#39;ll hit it eventually!&#39;, we were already over Switzerland.<br><br>Still, we eventually made Paris, hashtag-occupied the Eiffel Tower, and most people went to sleep.<br><br>I <i>tried</i> to go to sleep. But then Neshomeh dragged me bodily from my tent and forced me to play Extreme Truth or Dare (that&#39;s my story and I&#39;m sticking to it). Oh, the tales I could tell about Iximaz climbing the outside of the tower, Mattman the Comet&#39;s &#39;impression of a real comet&#39;, and of course Storme Hawk&#39;s actinium &#39;mishap&#39;. But what happens in Paris stays in Paris, right? Especially any &#39;truths&#39; prompted by the words &#39;if you had to tell a brand-new shipfic out loud right now, what would it be?&#39;. (Larfen J. Stocke, esq, that was cheating and you know it.)<br><br>I actually missed most of the first day: my hanglider was sabotaged by unknown Voyds, and I ended up circling over the city waiting for twenty thousand rubber bands to wind down and stop turning the propeller. I did have a good view of the Infinite Seagull incident, though. And I had an excellent view of the firework show - until that rocket hit my glider in the wing and brought me down on top of the tower. Still, down was better than up, and the burns have already started healing.<br><br>So I was much happier to ride Fred around the city on day two; SkarmorySilver&#39;s attempts to give a guided tour based on &#39;that video game I played a few years back&#39; was especially entertaining (particularly once he realised he was trying to guide us around Prague, not Paris at all!). And I was very pleased to get FOOOOOOOOOOOOOD. I may have gone a little overboard on the croissants and croissant-derivatives.<br><br>No, not on the frogs. The frogs had nothing to do with me. If they had, would I have been throwing them over the side of the observation platform? (Oh, hush - they&#39;re small, they have low terminal velocity, they were fine.)<br><br>Day three was brilliant. Tigeress&#39;s Stop Motion Portal was hilarious (&#39;Hardric&#39;s stepped on the orange portal! Everybody freeze!&#39;), and got even better when more of those other-dimensional gateways opened. Nesh&#39;s <i>Phantom of the Opera at the Opera</i> was loads of fun, even if I was only able to do the chorus parts. And using flaming potato guns to have &#39;magical&#39; duels across the rooftops of Paris by moonlight… well, what more needs to be said? Other than &#39;sorry, Phobos&#39; (again).<br><br>But day four… okay, I was fine with &#39;Operation Spark a Riot so we can Pretend it&#39;s Orcs Attacking Helm&#39;s Deep&#39;. Sort of fine. But &#39;dose the Seine with actinium so the radiation will make us all into superheroes&#39; was a bad idea, and no, the fact that son<em>of</em>heaven176 managed to lose my samples before they reached the river doesn&#39;t make it better. And &#39;paint the Eiffel Tower blue because reasons&#39;... let&#39;s just say I don&#39;t blame the police for needing a <i>lot</i> of Jammie Dodgers to let us stay.<br><br>But Sues Versus Agents made up for it (as it always does). I still think my idea of using Valarin names for everyone on Team Serg- er, Scap- er, what team was I on? Well, it was a good idea anyway, but I ran around shouting for Tulukharuљurыz to help me, and all I got was a faceful of foam arrows.<br><br>But it was fun. And I managed to make sure when we got kicked out it was into Belgium, so we could swing by Brussels and pick up some proper Belgian chocolate on the way back (like we should have on the way there, honestly). There&#39;s about 500 pounds of the stuff left if anyone feels like wandering by our place… like, for instance, if you want to pick up a certain beached, black-painted aircraft carrier and take it back where it belongs.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaay it&#39;s back. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It seems like, judging from the responses a few threads down, I&#39;m not the only one with some terribly glittery skeletons in the closet. I&#39;ll go ahead and share mine.<br><br>My most recent, (and the only published Sue of mine) I created when I was fourteen, was a self-insert (...actually, all of these Sues were...) who was a distant relation of Professor Trelawney&#39;s and could see the future, but she was a &quot;special&quot; seer who remembered her prophecies and they were guaranteed to come true no matter what. She also ended up becoming the fifth Marauder and got embroiled in a love triangle between Sirius and Remus, who actually got into a fistfight over her... yeah. She was also ridiculously good at dueling, though at least I balanced that out with her being less-than-stellar in Charms and just average at everything else... I think. At least I did recognize the fact that the Marauders were bullies and wrote her appropriately like that, though I still cringe at the fact she and Lily ended up becoming friends in first year despite her main circle of friends. She was still full of glitter and I gleefully killed her on one of my missions.<br><br>A particular one I remember from playing &quot;make-believe&quot; with my mom and brother as a kid was a daughter of Lupin who would alternate between being bitten by her dad on accident or by Greyback on purpose. She&#39;d always hook up with Harry, Ron, and Hermione and was the absolute best student at everything. I remember one game when she even got sorted into both Ravenclaw <i>and</i> Gryffindor at the same time. Ugh. Oh, and her fainting spell on the train in third year was always much more <s>dramatic</s> traumatic than Harry&#39;s and therefore better.<br><br>And the third, which I&#39;m seriously considering writing a deliberately bad fanfic about, was one I pretended to be on my own (possibly because even when I was seven I knew how terrible the idea was). This one, who I distinctly remember being named Jade, was hatched from a Hungarian Horntail egg but looked like a human save for her eyes (yellow with vertical slits), wings, and tail, and she could also breathe fire. Charlie Weasley found her shortly after she hatched and she got raised as Ron&#39;s twin sister. She helped Harry in the Triwizard Tournament by speaking to the dragon and asking if he could have the egg that wasn&#39;t a real egg. She was also allowed to play Quidditch in her first year—Chaser, I think she booted Alicia Spinnet off the team—and ended up hooking up with George for the Yule Ball. Yep, her adoptive brother. *headdesk*</p>

            <p>I&#39;m up way too late and can&#39;t sleep, so cute it.<br><br>I have two potentially disastrous cases in my closet that, thankfully, I became too bored to fully develop. The first one was partially Suvian due to his species, which was from World One about a bajillion years in the future. Each member was basically a human with animal characteristics. They also had magic. Really, really overpowered magic. The kind that destroys entire castles. Also, the species had no actual age limit. Members couldn&#39;t die of old age, and could look however they wanted. Oh, and they had healing powers that got better as they aged, so that once they were ready to leave their parents&#39; territories, they could survive lethal wounds if their bodies were still basically whole, and a while after that, they could survive dismemberment, and a while after that, they could survive being turned to ashes, and the only way to kill them was to completely transform their bodies into energy, something which I did not fully comprehend at that time and which, in that world, would have only destroyed a city. Oh, and the two eldest members of the species could survive that, and it would basically have only turned every spell they cast into Cast From Hit Points. Oh, and this species literally had no cap on how much their abilities could develop, so theoretically, they could have infinite anything. <br><br>My character was part spider, and also a specialist in contract magic. It&#39;s exactly what it sounds like. He tricked people into signing contracts that basically said, &quot;The party of first part may now do whatever the bunny he wants to the party of the second part, literally.&quot; That last word is, of course, where the magic came in, in addition to the magic binding everybody to his will. He was blatant wish fulfillment, as this species basically dominated the planet, and did whatever he wanted prior to the beginning of the imagined plot, when he would undergo a moral turnaround and also become a convert. Gag me with a spork.<br><br>The other one is, by comparison, tame. It was a ridiculous Fairy Tail fanfic full of Suvian OCs, including people wielding Seith Magic, Ice-Make Magic, and other canons one hundred percent perfectly despite being potentially younger than the canon characters, and a couple ridiculous Magics that I made up, including a kind of Song Magic that forced people to act in manners that fit the song being played and would have turned the thing into a really bad Songfic. The only things the younger me got right were A) Not using the canon characters, and instead setting the story a couple hundred years later, because even poor deluded me realized that I had no writing experience and couldn&#39;t write the canon characters personalities correctly, and B) Actually setting limits on Arc of Embodiment, whose full extent was poorly defined at that time (the Tenrou Island Arc had just come out) in order to keep it from being ridiculously OP.</p>

            <p>But when we were younger, me, my younger brother, and my cousin used to play Star Wars all the time, and we were a regular trio of Stus. We were all powerful Jedi Masters, respected generals during the Clone Wars and Galactic Civil War, accomplished fleet commanders, survivors of Order 66, leaders of entire governments or armies... The list goes on for a while. We pretty much just used the Star Wars universe as a jumping off point and then did whatever the heck we wanted. <br>Some notably Stu-y accomplishments of my self-insert self include:<br><br>Being functionally immortal through a combination of hitherto undiscovered bacta treatments and made up Force powers.<br>Being the Chief of State of the New Republic and Grandmaster of the New Jedi Order while their previous incarnations still existed.<br>Being a powerful enough Force user to manipulate turbolaser shots.<br>Being a skilled enough lightsaber duelist to take on multiple Sith Lords.<br><br>And that was just off the top of my head.<br>To be fair to my past self, though, as I grew older I did realize how ridiculously powerful I was, and we all gradually toned down how powerful we were, before eventually killing ourselves off.<br>In appropriately dramatic fashion, of course.<br><br>Other than that, I don&#39;t have any really Sueish characters. OFUM and the PPC got to me right as I started to take an interest in writing, and all the characters I had come up with before then were pretty standard fantasy hero fare.. I&#39;ve got a few characters now who might get a bit Sue-y if I screw up writing them, but nothing really embarrassing. <br>Not that I remember, anyway.</p>

            <p>When I was WAY younger, I ended up creating an entire fleet of Sues and Stus that, if published, would have me dead in a heartbeat. They were for a poorly-executed PUBLISHED school/town AU for Plants vs. Zombies. (I best know it as the fandom with too little canon and too much fanon. But it&#39;s cool most of the time, and I play the games, anyways.)<br><br>The characters from the AU were already replacements, so I basically possessed them in my brain. Here&#39;s where shit got real:<br><br>At the same age, I was addicted to the JP-only Super Robot Wars series, basically a series of mecha anime crossover games. Now, my understanding of it was very, very poor at the time compared to how I see it now. This, combined with my inability to grasp the fact that I was, in fact, leading a huge suvian army, lead to me SHOEHORNING ROBOTS FROM SAID SERIES INTO THESE FANTASIES, BEEFING THEM UP AS HARD AS POSSIBLE, AND INTEGRATING IT INTO THE CHARACTER&#39;S DAILY LIVES AS HARD AS POSSIBLE (THEY ARE 12-16 IN THE AU MIND YOU), RELEASING GLITTER EVERYWHERE. Sorry, just had to vent. Anyway, I don&#39;t need to explain things further. They were in writing as deep as you could go with Sues that have stuff from multiple universes for no reason, and just Sues in general.<br><br>If you want to know how I even got to that in the first place years ago, just take a look at this: pvzkomiks.wikia.com (Be warned: Really bad writing and possibly bad psychology. No you are not allowed to kill these people, they still don&#39;t glitter in my eyes. It&#39;s not mine, either.)</p>

            <p>I think I only have one really bad OC, and he was part of an original world.  He was the latest in a line of messianic figures chosen to save the world.  He had the knowledge of the champions that came before him, plus magic powers granted by a large sentient crystal.  He also had several shapeshifting forms, one of which had gills and wings at the same time.<br><br>I don&#39;t have any of my fanfiction anymore, but mostly I&#39;d learned that my OC shouldn&#39;t be more important than existing characters.<br><br>September Johnson was originally a telekinetic from a world inspired by X-men and Pegasus in Flight.

            <p>Jenni used to be fairly sparkly before the PPC. The good news is that I was more of a role-player than a ficcer, and I was taught manners in a private play-by-e-mail group fairly early on. After getting scolded for one big gaffe in which she teleported another character out of danger without their player&#39;s consent, all healery, telepath-y, and/or romancey shenanigans were conducted with the full cooperation of my fellow players.<br><br>That said, she still managed to get away with things like (a) Impressing a female brown dragon from the stands and becoming a Junior Weyrwoman in practically no time flat (which was not my plan; I just said yes when asked); (b) abducting the Phantom of the Opera from the end of the story and living with him in a quaint modern-ish little house (behold <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1014360/1/Premier-Noel">the resulting fic</a>); and (c) sleeping with Severus Snape despite the fact that he was married to another <s>even more glittery</s> OC and had a kid at the time, and there was SO much angst. (Seriously, <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/neshomehswork/sevandjen.jpg">look at my terrible art from 2003</a>. You can practically taste the angst.) So, take that with as big a grain of salt as you like. {= )<br><br>There were also a couple characters who were basically off-brand clones of Jenni and were more or less equally Sueish. You can meet them in <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/580376/1/It-s-the-Thought-that-Counts">this <i>Farscape</i> fanfic</a> and <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/este.html">this character bio</a> (note this is the improved version, after I got PPC input on her; then weep), if you really want to, but I&#39;m sure you guys have better things to do.<br><br>It&#39;s shocking I&#39;m not more ashamed of myself, but it was all so much fun at the time. The fact that people were in on it all with me helps a lot, too. ^_^ Well, except for the <i>Farscape</i> thing. That was all me; but I think Jen&#39;ra is more just flat and ungodly dull and predictable than urple? I&#39;unno; at any rate, it never seemed worthwhile to spork her. *shrug*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>supersonic805, who could absorb energy, and channel it out by other means. The reason this got out of hand is because he absorbed a nuclear explosion, so now he could pretty much do anything. He also had green eyes, due to that stereotypical radiation glow. Mind you, my friend put that bomb there just to see what would happen. He did have to suffer the effects of radiation sickness, however. Theoretically, he could also stop anything that came towards him, but that never happened, because my friend was a gigantic war machine that slaughtered everything before I had a chance to do anything. supersonic805 lost that power after fighting Frank Horrigan with a crowbar. In midair. I may use him again, after that business with Omega Supreme.<br><br>This is actually my 4th time trying to write this, as the last few times, I just got really angry with my friend, for putting me through that bloodbath.</p>

            <p>The only one I specifically remember is Kara. I thought her up back when I was more into Naruto. She was Gaara&#39;s cousin (complete with red hair) and had his sand powers, but she was sane. (Mostly.) She showed up in a game of make-believe with my brother, too. For some reason I literally introduced her as a prisoner on a slave ship alongside my little brother&#39;s Stu OC, a younger Uchiha brother. (The latter got relatively little development, thankfully.) After the obligatory break-out-at-the-slave-auction sequence, the two of them got their own separate game, where I further decided that she&#39;d figured out how to manipulate the sand-coffin thing Gaara does so it didn&#39;t always kill, taught at the Konoha ninja academy (after going through the exams, where she only cheated once, and a timeskip), and had a Summoning contract with a giant bird. Also, she had a pet Chihuahua named Zack who was mostly there for cuteness relief.<br><br>*dusts off hands*</p>

I watch these videos primarily for the person playing them; for their commentary and thoughts about the game itself. The game helps, admittedly, but it&#39;s not the primary draw. Looking for game-specific LPs or streams helps me find new people, but they are what make me stick around to watch more. There&#39;s also a little bit of the <i>Mystery Science Theater 3000</i> vibe around these things, which I enjoy. Finally, there&#39;s also some nostalgia to my like for LPs and streams. My brother and I used to chat over and mock games all the time when we were younger. A lot of my favorites remind me of that experience.<br><br>I must confess that I&#39;m not unbiased in this question. I&#39;ve been recording <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PoorCynic">Let&#39;s Plays and video reviews</a> for quite some time now, and watching them well before that. I&#39;ve only recently started watching streams—timing can be a bit of a pain when it comes to live events—and actually did a test stream of my own earlier this week.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with them, and I am probably going to be spending the 30th of June in a vegetative state watching streams of a new game coming out that day.<br><br>My only concern is LPs that lack in the quality that &quot;big YouTubers&quot; can achieve. FGTeeV and several Minecrafters come to mind. Symptoms include pathetically low standards such as bragging about how much money you spend and churning out &quot;roleplays&quot; daily with low effort (these have actually happened; those responsible also have a MASSIVE following, disturbingly enough.)</p>

            <p>Usually for discoverring and learning more about a game before buying, sometimes for watching someone play (although I get irationally irritated if the LPer does a mistake which may seem obvious at first glance.)<br><br>I also enjoy some LPs for the humor, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3A8186976CC9159E">Persona 4 Endurance Run</a>, and <a href="http://lparchive.org/Persona-3/">My Life Is A Goddamn Mess</a>.

            <p>I did immensely enjoy TheSilverKetchup&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_S0diz23hY&amp;list=PL140E7945213647D7">Let&#39;s Play Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone PC</a>. It reminds a lot of an MST, though he does some pretty funny edits (Flipendo block Tetris, anyone?) and the storyline ends up being something along the lines of &quot;Harry tries to escape from Hogwarts while Professors Dumbledore and Sprout try to kill him with milk-drinking plants, naked babies run rampant, and Mini-Santa hands out autographs&quot;. Yeah, some of the humor is pretty juvenile, but it&#39;s never crude, which I can appreciate. (And being a fan of juvenile humor myself, I&#39;m not complaining.)<br><br>Other than that, though, I don&#39;t really watch LPs; just a bunch of raid guids by Fatboss. That&#39;s pretty much it in terms of watching gaming videos.</p>

            <p>Nothing against let&#39;s plays as a whole, of course, I watched Game Grumps at one point, and I&#39;m sure there are high quality let&#39;s plays out there. <br>My problem is, is that there are so many LPers who are just so bloody <i>boring,</i> y&#39;know? <br>Like they&#39;re trying to start a bloody franchise, or some nonsense like that. <br>You know the people I&#39;m on about. <br>The ones who jump wildly at the chance to make the most stunningly unoriginal jokes they can possibly make. <br>When they&#39;re attacking the lower front of a gargoyle or something, they screech &#39;OH, IM ATTACKEN HIS PENIS HAHAHA&#39; <br>Those people. <br>And there are so many, too. <br><br>I agree on the game not being a primary draw, definitely, and there are LPers I do like, assuming they can still technically be considered LPers. <br>Especially Star_ and Jerma. <br>The two of them are so bloody glorious together, I based parts of my agent&#39;s relationship on theirs. <br>And they don&#39;t make brainless dick jokes, even when given the perfect opportunity for them. </p>

            <p>And also, eventually, because I like the LPer&#39;s personality and humor. I&#39;m a bit less of a fan of streaming, if only because I miss livestreams a lot and my Internet connection is a bit fiddly when it comes to videos. :/</p>

            <p>It depends, but I tend to enjoy the written ones quite a lot.

            <p>I like the screenshot ones that are as much about the collab end with letting people make ridiculous choices as they are about making a story out of it, especially when they use it as a tutorial or explain aspects of the game as they go about it-like why this choice they went with due to audience input is Completely Terrible or Unexpectedly Good. </p>

            <p>I watch a lot of people stream Magic: The Gathering Online.  I watch for a number of reasons; foremost being I want to know how other people value cards, make decisions, and play the game.  It has helped make me a much better player.<br><br>I have to find some value to myself in what the streamer is saying.  I stopped watching a number of channels when it became clear that they judge the worth of a card based entirely on its financial value.  That won&#39;t help me get better, and that type of player is not who I am going to be competing against in tournaments.  I also stopped watching a youtuber who actively hates the company who makes the game because they won&#39;t produce exactly the things he wants.  Again, not worth my time.<br><br>The people I still watch offer information that I can&#39;t get on my own, or a viewpoint that is very different from my own.  For instance, I watch a guy who plays a very aggressive game.  I don&#39;t play that way often (i&#39;m a control and combo player), so it is good to know how he values cards for his style.  This way, if I am in a draft in a tournament and the packs are telling me to be aggressive, then I have a baseline to work from.<br><br>So, I watch more for information than entertainment.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Not for me the ones where someone just plays through the story mode of a single-player game and comments on it, generally in the shrill and meme-slathered manner one might find on the Facebook page of a particularly irritating fourteen-year-old boy. I much prefer the ones where the game is different every time and the narrative is generated by the commentator themselves, if indeed they even bother.<br><br>My favourite LPer is probably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/marbozir">Marbozir</a>, a Polish Civ specialist and strategy game fan. He goes through a hell of a lot of Civ 5 content, shining a spotlight on interesting mods and generally being really damn good at the game. He also doesn&#39;t put a lot of effort into building a narrative; due to the nature of a game like Civilization, he doesn&#39;t really <i>need</i> to. It happens entirely organically, and I enjoy that very much.<br><br>However, I totally get why people watch LPs of the shriekers in a single-player horror campaign. Watching people make jokes is funny, and it does depend on the YouTuber. I find PewDiePie to be about as tolerable as the entire discography of Yes played by fingernails on a blackboard, for instance, but he must be doing something right. =]</p>

            <p>There is a definite level of embarrassment at somehow missing those items that are most definitely errors.<br><br>That said, with 1) it&#39;s not a logical error; sunny days are often a cause for people to be outside, especially in a canon like MMPR which heavily stressed on things like physical activity and being outside to its young audience.

            <p>I&#39;m happy you enjoyed that take. <br><br>And as far as how <i>July</i> got in, well. Nearly every snippet of conversation or comments coming from the sailors/marines in the first part of this and Stormbreak came from real &#39;I overheard this or was told about it&#39; conversations or combinations. Bathwater guy, the weirdness of guys with author last name plus character last names working together, the pyro DC (damage control, basically firemen slash hardcore repairmen) complaining about wanting to set things on fire, the guy who couldn&#39;t keep his self-appointed callsign straight... Navy shenanigans actually gave me a lot of inspiration for writing PPC things.<br><br>And as far as Nikki goes, Library would like to comment that she doesn&#39;t look down upon agents who wear trousers, but it does get very tiresome when people comment on <i>her</i> choice of clothing. <br><br>-July <br></p>

            <p>Oh, man, the Putties.  They really are fantastic, aren&#39;t they?  And I&#39;m super glad you&#39;ve made them the mini for <i>Power Rangers</i>; they deserve it!<br><br>The scene where you introduced Lord Zedd is quite gorgeous.  I love that you described his throne room and appearance well enough to get across the malevolent feel of the setting, but without going purple prose.  The freaky-but-appropriate scene transition on the way there goes a long way towards that mood, as well.<br><br>And.  Tortura.  Yeah.  That is . . . I know a lot of the monsters on the show were on the dumber side conceptually, but . . . Wow.  Tortura is just so baldly <i>overt</i>.  And being made of books that discussed torture is particularly non-creative.  I&#39;m curious to see how you&#39;ll portray it (refuse to say &quot;him&quot;) down the line.  And for someone with, ostensibly, a torture kink, I get the feeling the author doesn&#39;t really understand torture much at all?<br><br>I&#39;m intrigued by your choice to treat the world so differently than most missions, making the badfic nested inside the canon, rather than starting with a generic Word World space.  It makes sense for such an old and well-known story, and gives &quot;Agony in Pink&quot; a much more parasitic feel compared to most badfics.  Making the canon essentially empty is also a nice choice; it makes moments that should have made me feel all nostalgic, like visiting the Youth Center, feel unnerving instead, which adds to the tone of the world itself being inhabited by something <i>wrong</i>.<br><br>One little thing that I love muchly is that you have Kimberly take down some of the Putties once the agents reveal themselves.  It&#39;s a short little moment, but it just feels extra good, knowing that AiP utterly dis-empowers her for plot reasons; I like that she gets her ability to fight back restored once she&#39;s rescued from the fic&#39;s influence.<br><br>—doctorlit was starting to feel like a poor fan, but now he understands why July seemed to retain so much more info on the show than he.</p>

            <p>As far as the Putties go, they were the only choice, in my opinion. <br><br>Lord Zedd and his throne room were both pretty hard to describe, actually! I know that not everyone has seen MMPR or if they did necessarily remember it, since it was a kid&#39;s show from the 90s, remastered version or no. <br><br>Yup, Tortura is pretty bad. <br><br>Even when the show was sparse on extra there were still people around doing things, even when the main characters were the heaviest focus, because of how integrated they were with their community. So that played a small part in this decision.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you liked that! While the Pink Ranger is very much... pink and the &#39;girly&#39; one of the group, even in the show when they had the &#39;damsel in distress&#39; moments the girls were never totally disenfranchised and fought back, too. <br><br>And as far as retainment goes, I had to do plenty of research to make sure I wasn&#39;t misremembering things and so I could describe and depict things right. So that helped out.<br><br>-July</p>

            <p>I was idly prowling around on TV Tropes (note: no tab explosions were involved) and discovered the PPC through their tropes relating to absurdities in fanfic (in fact, the first page I landed on in the wiki was the Citrus Scale, from TV Tropes&#39; pages on Lemons and Limes.)

            <p>Welcome to the PPC! Have a baked potato with melted cheese on top. It&#39;s the kind of cheese with the texture of plastic, but I hope you enjoy it anyway. People call me Key, or sometimes Cat, and refer to me with the pronouns she/her/hers. Rampant nicknaming is okay. My questions for you are: How do you feel about nicknaming? Are there nicknames you hope to encourage or to avoid? What pronouns should we use when referring to you?<br><br>I couldn&#39;t help noticing that you&#39;re finding fics to spork and working on your Permission prompts already. It&#39;s great to see this enthusiasm, but I&#39;d advise you to relax a bit. You can&#39;t even get Permission unless you&#39;ve been an active member of the community for a while (around a month, I think it was?). So poke around, get to know us. The PPC is a big place; there&#39;s lots to see here. You said you were only part-way through TOS; that means you haven&#39;t even read about an exorcism, much less a WhatThe mission or multiverse theory. Of course, if you&#39;re more interested in the badfic than the PPC universe, that&#39;s okay. Just keep in mind that the universe exists and the agents&#39; characters are important to PPC stories; this isn&#39;t MSTing. And because of this, rage often isn&#39;t the best mode to write PPC stories in; it&#39;s a levelheaded sort of sporking, because you have to write a good story around that bad one. (This is mostly a summary of things other people have said. I don&#39;t have Permission; I&#39;ve only been here since March and I&#39;m still getting to know the universe and style.)</p>

            <p>I fully understand most if not all of PPC terminology and other related concepts, including those that you&#39;ve listed.<br><br>In addition, I have a penchant for writing (much to the chagrin of part of my sub-conscious), so to finally be given an excuse to write for fun may have lead me to basically jump the shark here. Also, with the badfic, I already knew that the PPC was not, in fact, SRS BSNS or MST and thus planned accordingly.<br><br>I&#39;m a guy, and you can refer to me by the abbreviation &quot;Troc.&quot; The &quot;V&quot; in my username is a fictitious last name that I only just recently fully extended to &quot;Vesia,&quot; so if you want to refer to me by my full boarder name, just call me &quot;Trocyte&quot; (the &quot;c&quot; is pronounced like an &quot;s&quot; unless you use my preferred nickname.)<br><br>Thanks for the advice anyways.</p>

            <p>My fandoms are Plants vs. Zombies, and the Super Robot Wars franchise (a JP-only turn-based strategy game series that basically combines all good mecha anime into one plot of, as the fandom absolutely LOVES to put it, kicking so much ass.)<br><br>Personally, I think the PvZ fandom/continuum suffers from at least some damage due to an imbalance where fanon greatly outweighs canon. It&#39;s also got some weird rules for writing fan material without sucking so I think missions in it will need at least some more education than usual.<br><br>Anyway, I have read enough of the Original Series to grasp the entire concept of the PPC as a whole, so that&#39;s out of the way. I&#39;ve also read the constitution.</p>

Dear god.), bad pacing (likely in part due to the overall format), out-of-canon relations between canon characters, proclaiming mundane actions as weird and bizarre, and behavior that I can&#39;t discern between replacement or possession all within the synopsis and the first chapter, which is just an intro.

            <p>After risking my sanity going deeper into the fic, I discovered even more problem passages.<br><br>-Peashooter and Sunflower have an uncanon lovechild under the influence of the previously mentioned gallon of alcohol, which should have killed the latter due to biology. They immediately take this unsettling development as a happy new chapter in their life. That&#39;s not how it works. Bonus points for conception occurring in a form of IKEA Erotica.<br>-Estimated duration of the fic is approximately between one week and one month, though formatting seems to be compressing it down to less than the former. This is important as bad psychology involved is tied to this, as Peashooter and Sunflower marry (note: this is a common ship but anything beyond basic romantic action (i.e Citrus) isn&#39;t exactly the best choice for depicting) at the beginning of the fic and already undergo marital issues in the middle of it. (The only character NOT replaced or maybe possessed in the fic tried to intervene AND called out the bad psychology involved, but of course failed miserably.)<br><br>Also, can I claim this BEFORE I file a permission request?</p>

            <p>It&#39;s... really not anything like a soap opera, honestly. It was on at the same time as Classic Doctor Who was, and was basically a great little show about time, consequences, and grown men being attacked by floating pillows. There&#39;s a rather good TVtropes page <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SapphireAndSteel">over here</a>. <br>It was basically about a mysterious man and woman (named Sapphire and Steel, respectively) who showed up whenever Time began to break through into the real world, and basically beat it back by glaring at it and occasionally freezing it using Steel&#39;s weird powers. It&#39;s... surprisingly hard to describe, actually. I really like it for some reason. </p>

            <p>...doesn&#39;t mean they know what we&#39;re about. And (no offense intended toward TrocyteV, this is just a generalization) anyone could claim they&#39;ve been lurking, but we have no way of really knowing that. Hence the waiting period of getting to know them, and them us. <br><br>As for getting the request prepared, well. That&#39;s entirely on the writer&#39;s shoulders. I had mine ready within days of joining (sorry, hS, you probably expected better of me) but I wasn&#39;t here <i>just</i> to write; I was here for the community that had shown to be dedicated to their favorite fandoms and to each other. Because that&#39;s what the PPC is, first and foremost: a community. <br><br>And for the record, plenty of people get Permission their first try; the main pitfalls I&#39;ve seen preventing that lately are not waiting for betas and not presenting a polished piece to begin with.</p>

            <p>Around the point when someone asked if I planned to go for Permission and the idea stuck in my head, actually.<br><br>On the other hand, I took nearly three months about creating my request. During that time, I read a whole lot of the wiki, read a ton of missions as well as rereading a lot of the ones I&#39;d read years earlier, and consulted people on various pieces of the PPC and what I was developing. I also did a *ton* of editing, including reading my writing piece out loud, and wrote scenes to develop my characters&#39; personalities. I also developed their backstories which, believe me, definitely changed and developed as I went on. And on top of that, I was hanging out on the Board and having fun with that (and going &#39;eek, oldbies are talking to me!&#39;, but I think we all go through that stage :) ).<br><br>So I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any real issue with beginning to figure things out early--so long as you&#39;re also doing research (=reading all the things! Or at least a lot of them)  to learn about what fits and makes sense in the PPC, and how it functions. Not to mention hanging around on the Board--you get to ask questions, get to know the community as it gets to know you, and see new missions as they come out. To use a bit of teacher speak: it&#39;s a great learning opportunity.<br><br>Also, yeah. Polish, polish, polish. Also, research (ie, read a ton of missions and interludes and the wiki. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s fun!) and get to know the community. There&#39;s no need to rush to get your request out--believe me, it takes some time to refine your characters to the seeing, because it takes time to properly learn the setting! So my advice is: give yourself the time to edit and polish and revise. Your characters will be more developed, your written pieces better presented, and your knowledge *much* more complete. All of that can only help you, with Permission, future missions and interludes, and, quite honestly, *life*. Most people do need to know how to write things for school and work; developing your writing skills (writing, revision, self-editing, and peer-editing) is a wonderful idea.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I was informed by someone on the Board to post the short film I was working on this past semester in Prague whenever it got uploaded. It got uploaded just last week, so here I am bringing it to you lot. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/7-3J-czoEXM">The Dinner Party</a>, as a link because I am too tired to figure out the embed code here. <br><br>The quality is a little weird for the first couple of scenes but it does pick up a bit later. I think. We had many issues trying to get a version that&#39;d cooperate with YouTube, so yeah.<br><br>And as for the request: I&#39;d like to consult someone who has a decent grasp of Quenya and Sindarin (but mostly Quenya) because I&#39;m starting to work on a modern Middle-earth college AU and I thought that it&#39;d be fitting to replace Latin with Quenya, except for the fact that I know no Quenya myself. :P It&#39;d just be finding fitting translations/names for mottos and frat/sorority names and stuff, nothing too major. Let me know if you&#39;re interested.<br><br>So there you have it! How are things on the Board?</p>

<br><br>Come on, who <i>wouldn&#39;t</i> watch that?<br><br>The time period of the founding of Hogwarts is a really interesting one. You&#39;ve got Aethelred &quot;the Unready&quot; on the throne of England, and renewed Viking invasions plaguing the coasts. Scotland is already a unified nation, but England is dangerously divided: the north is mostly Viking, the south Saxon, though both halves are nominally ruled by Wessex.<br><br>Looking over the founders, I found that Godric is actually from the West Country. As a renowned dueler, it makes perfect sense for him to be in the court of Aethelred - and given the king&#39;s policy of appeasing the Viking raiders that I&#39;ve got the founders fighting, I see heaps of inherent drama in that.<br><br>Rowena is Scottish, but she has a Latin name: she&#39;s clearly noble enough to be putting on airs. (Chuck in that diadem for extra effect!) The fact that she has a daughter - a daughter who ended up massively resenting her - makes for brilliant storytelling.<br><br>Helga is from Wales, but has a Norse name; I&#39;ve got her as the descendent of Vikings, now settled on the far west of old Mercia. Her main drive is going to be balancing her wizardly work with her loyalty to her home.<br><br>And then we have Salazar. Apparently we don&#39;t know where he&#39;s from, but he has a Portugese name - so I&#39;ve made him of Moorish extraction (gotta get that diversity in somewhere!). That made it absolutely essential to have him as a sympathetic character (&quot;Oh yes, the <i>evil</i> founder is the <i>black</i> one, surprise surprise...!&quot;), so I took it a step further and cast him as the protagonist. His drama comes from his disagreement with the other founders, particularly (of course) Godric. Making his anti-Muggleborn prejudices understandable (if not necessarily sympathetic) is key, and probably centres on making the whole &#39;basilisk in the basement&#39; thing <i>not</i> about murdering them all.<br><br>As for the opposition? Well, Vikings are a must-have, and we&#39;re probably looking at conflict with proto-Durmstrang. I&#39;ve also chucked the New World into the mix, to give Rowling (obviously she&#39;s writing this) a chance to redeem her American credentials: the setting is right about when Leif Erikson found Vinland, so the idea of increased and hostile contact is absolutely there. Hopefully Mayan magic (or something further north, if she preferred) would be more interesting than MACUSA&#39;s view of Native magic.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>We start with an extreme closeup of a pair of eyes. Pull back slowly to see the face of SALAZAR SLYTHERIN, one hand shading his eyes as he watches something off-screen in front of him. We keep drawing back, revealing a sunlit green countryside behind him. The sounds of battle start to fade in.<br><br>We pull back until we can see Salazar full-length. He stands with one hand on a shoulder-high standing stone; his other hand is holding his wand, pointed downwards. Then we rotate the camera, orbiting Salazar until we are behind him. Past him, we see what he is watching: the BATTLE OF TARA.<br><br>In the valley and on the slopes of the hill, the High King of Ireland is fighting the son of the Viking King of Dublin. The future of Ireland hangs in the balance - and things aren&#39;t going well. From Salazar&#39;s vantage point, we see the Irish banner swaying, surrounded by foes. The Vikings are massing for a charge.<br><br>Cut back to Salazar, to see him smile. He taps his wand against his thigh thoughtfully, then lifts it and takes aim.<br><br>SALAZAR: <i>Serpensortia.</i><br><br>The Viking lines fall into sudden dissaray. The camera cuts down to show why: masses of snakes are writhing up from the grass of Tara, coiling around their legs. We see the Irish rally and charge the Vikings, and the Viking banner falls. Then we go back to Salazar.<br><br>SALAZAR: <i>Vipera Evanesca</i>.<br><br>The snakes evaporate into smoke, letting the Irish continue their attack. Salazar smiles, turns away, and walks off down the hill.<br><br>Cue main titles.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>The Battle of Tara makes it 980, which is a good timing for our first episode. I&#39;ve monkeyed with history a little - the King of Dublin wasn&#39;t actually present, and I doubt the battle took place on the slopes of the Hill of Tara itself - but hey, fiction.<br><br>Salazar&#39;s use of snakes here is at least triply meaningful: it&#39;s a &#39;cunning&#39; plan (he doesn&#39;t have to go anywhere near the battle, and he doesn&#39;t actually harm anyone), it references his Parseltongue and later stories with the Basilisk (oh yes, Salazar has a Cute Animal Friend ^_^), and it&#39;s also a callout to Saint Patrick, famous for banishing snakes from Ireland.<br><br>And yes, Salazar is leaning on the Stone of Destiny.

            <p>Perhaps that&#39;s why there&#39;s no major Spanish school of magic in the main HP continuum; the one in the Caliphate got razed to the ground by people sick of the descendants of al-Salazar (Slytherid Dynasty? Slytherid Dynasty. =] ) and their many, many varieties of BS. Moorish court politics was characterized by dead man&#39;s boots, so I&#39;m guessing the Cуrdoba school encouraged that.

Pretty please? :P You know this would make a great fanfic.<br><br>As for Salazar&#39;s Muggleborn prejudices, I remember seeing something the other day; considering the time period, he was probably afraid that Muggleborns, raised in an anti-magic-slash-highly superstitious environment, might have tried to tell others where to find Hogwarts, or commit suicide believing themselves to be possessed by demons, or go on to become Dark witches and wizards, believing their souls were doomed anyway so they might as well have fun for it.<br><br>Not that this is necessarily my headcanon but I did find it interesting.<br><br>...Now to think of how him leaving the Basilisk could be made sympathetic... maybe he put it in the Chamber to guard the school in a time of great need, but as the years passed and his name became synonymous with &quot;anti-Muggleborn&quot;, the legends became twisted and &quot;Enemies of the Heir&quot; was immediately assumed to mean Muggleborns?<br><br>And now I have a mental image of Slytherin facepalming at Riddle as he goes around loosing the Basilisk on the school. &quot;No, no, no, you idiot! I put her there to protect the castle, not terrorize it!&quot;</p>

            <p>Not enough to do this justice. If you want to take it, I&#39;ll act as historical consultant... ^_~<br><br>Hmm on the theory. I&#39;m not convinced this is the right timeframe for that. The Vikings in particular were <i>barely</i> post-pagan; English Christianity was still stuffed full of folklore, magic, and superstition.<br><br>... oh, but Salazar is <i>Moorish</i>. His heritage is Muslim, a religion that (in that time and place in particular) didn&#39;t tolerate wavering from the path. His experience is of the Reconquista, and fanatical Christians marching on anything different to destroy it. He probably has personal experience of &#39;half-blood&#39; children - born of one Muslim parent, one Christian (and that probably happened both ways round) - who ended up betraying both. If ever anyone had reason to believe mixing races is wrong, it&#39;s someone from Spain during the Reconquista.<br><br>I like the idea about the Basilisk, though: absolutely! As to why it&#39;s there, it&#39;s because he <i>mastered</i> it. It&#39;s a creature of the Dark Arts (its gaze is basically a pocket Avada Kedavra), but it is now in service to the side of the right. Great symbol, fantastic. If only Godric would understand...<br><br>I have a feeling this show consists in large part of Salazar facepalming at things. Especially Godric. Because srsly.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>No, seriously, <i>what</i>?<br><br>This is the 900s. The Reconquista was close to 600 years <i>after</i> your show purports to be set. The dominant power in Spain was a redeclared Umayyad Caliphate after the crippling defeats of the 800s suffered by the Visigoths at the hands of North African Muslims. This was al-Andalus at its height, a kingdom of opulence and splendour unmatched in Christian Europe, with the capital at Cуrdoba making Paris look like a squalid little shantytown in a river of mud and excrement. This is absolutely, totally, unbelievably wrong.<br><br>I expect better from you.</p>

            <p><i>The Reconquista is the name given to a long series of wars and battles between the Christian Kingdoms and the Muslim Moors for control of the Iberian Peninsula.

            <p>You said in your opening post that this was &quot;about 200 years before the Norman Conquest&quot;. If we say that this is from 866-ish to 966-ish over the total run time of the show, then this is the golden age of Moorish Spain. They had the Christians on the back foot, though Leon was independent. Initially, though we have the Emirate of Cуrdoba... now there&#39;s an idea.<br><br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Coras_del_Emirato_de_C%C3%B3rdoba.png"><br><br>These are the borders of the Emirate of Cуrdoba. Yes, there are border raids by the Leonese in the late 800s. Yes, the emirs had an unfortunate tendency to vacillate. If we go with the 880s as a starting point, then who&#39;s on the throne in the nation of al-Salazar&#39;s birth? A man Wikipedia describes as &quot;a neurotic recluse[...]only interested in hunting and his faith&quot;. A weak man in a nation riven by war, whose authority didn&#39;t extend much outside his court.<br><br>Fast forward to 912. Our al-Salazar hears that his king is dead, and that his grandson (after the usual stranglings and so forth) is on the throne. This is Abd-ar-Rahman III, a man who would quite literally be the architect of Moorish Spain. In 929, ar-Rahman declares his Caliphate and proceeds to kick seven bells out of the Christians in the north. Cуrdoba becomes a beautiful city of light and learning. So here&#39;s the question.<br><br>Why doesn&#39;t Salazar go home?<br><br>The glory years of al-Andalus will be greater still with a trained wizard on the side of God. The Fatimids of north Africa will be that much easier to break upon the rocks. Asturias will fall. The dynastic conflicts of the 950s will benefit from the judicious application of Confundus charms. And most of all, our Salazar will live in the palace of his dreams, the Medina Azahara, a palace complex the size of a small town built five miles outside of Cуrdoba. You could do so much with this setting...<br><br>But that means abandoning his friends to the ravages of the Northmen. It means a choice between being remembered by foreigners as a dastardly adversary, and being remembered as a great leader by his own people. It means rain or sun, heather honey or Granadan dates, the palace or the standing stone.<br><br>What price ambition?</p>

            <p>The above response was an explosion, and it was completely out of line to say what I did. No matter what it is, you deserve to be treated with respect, and I did not do so.

            <p>Sign me <i>right</i> up for this! Very excellent work building it up.

Can&#39;t help but imagine this in context with the show <i>Vikings</i>, and that would just be all kinds of madness. Not one of those guys should be allowed to touch a wand. {X D<br><br>... Bit of a shame that a show with Salazar as the protagonist must eventually conclude with his fall and exile from Hogwarts. Still, he does get his &quot;ha ha, joke&#39;s on you&quot; moment, what with the Chamber of Secrets, so I guess that&#39;s all right. Leave the audience with a bit of foreshadowing for the Chamber&#39;s eventual opening.

            <p>I was really hoping for that.<br><br>Yes, apparently Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw come from England, Wales, and Scotland; Slytherin isn&#39;t stated anywhere, but people often guess Ireland (to round out the quartet of nations). Rowena choosing the site for Hogwarts is a canon legend, and I&#39;m convinced; she was the smart one, after all!<br><br>Funnily enough, part of the inspiration for this was the one episode I watched of <i>The Last Kingdom</i>, which is a historical drama set during the Viking invasions (a hundred years before this one).

            <p>But yeah. The key (for the trailer) is to make them obviously from America, without dipping into cliche (I highly doubt they wore elaborate feather headdresses in Newfoundland!).

            <p>For such a rough start, the stuff you&#39;ve provided has been a vast improvement, both in terms of character and SPaG. Oh, and a Ben 10 agent? Wow, that show was my jam as a teen!

            <p>Let&#39;s see...<br><br>One thing I notice is some bizarre line breaks happening, but considering I suspect that&#39;s happening to one of my own Google docs right now I&#39;ll call that negligible.<br><br>The SpaG is acceptable. There&#39;s a general sense of forward movement in each of the writing samples. <br> <br>Kelly and September (...man, are we skipping August?

So I&#39;m going to assume there is improvement there as well.<br><br>The fic is definitely questionable at best based on the writing alone.<br><br>You&#39;ve shown visible effort to not only improve your writing, but to try and interact in the community and learn. <br><br>Consider <b>Permission Granted</b>. I don&#39;t think anyone will have serious argument against it this time.<br><br>Just make sure to use a beta, listen when they give advice- I believe PoorCynic is going to be making up a new workshop on the matter if he hadn&#39;t already- and keep participating in the community. I have confidence that since you&#39;ve already made the steps to work on your writing, you&#39;ll keep going in that direction. <br><br>I&#39;m also in the same area as you are currently. I do not work this weekend. If you feel comfortable with the idea, hit me up via email for my phone number. <br><br>Something like this calls for a celebration, even if it is a small one. <br><br>Congrats, PPC writer.<br><br>-July with the PG hat on</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad to see someone taking on a more obscure (as far as missions go) genre of fanfic. I liked the little ways the agents created trouble just by being themselves, such as Des insisting that a scene break was coming any minute now, really; him having to figure out his new eyes; and the Librarian almost losing an eye to a teenager by being slow.<br><br>I&#39;m also both pleased and slightly miffed to see the See-Through Device in action: pleased because I love it when people remember things and bring them back, but miffed because I was gonna do it and you ninja&#39;d me. ^_~ It&#39;s okay, though; my use of it probably won&#39;t appear for a good long while yet anyway, the way my writing is going.<br><br>My only critique is that, in my estimation, you missed an opportunity for a good gag with the line &quot;He turned around to leave, but found that his boots refused to budge.&quot; I figure either he&#39;s twisted his body around impossibly or else he&#39;s stepped out of his boots and left them glued to the doorstep; either way, it would&#39;ve been funny. {= )<br><br>Aaand I am out of time to write more. Will hopefully read more later.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Creating the regeneration process to allow for more <i>Doctor Who</i> was the best decision ever took by BBC. Look at all the characters who can be created.

            <p>I&#39;ve skimmed through a ton of badfics while looking for material to spork, and you would not <i>believe</i> the number of overpowered Sues who put themselves in a dangerous situation—usually a trivialized rape scene, because what&#39;s more dramatic than that? &gt;:/ —and promptly forget they can fight back or use their multitude of powers to escape, only for their designated Lust Object to swoop in and rescue them.
