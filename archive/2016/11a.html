            <p>Happy Halloween, PPC! It&#39;s kind of weird that I&#39;m the one saying this, because my family didn&#39;t really do Halloween all that much. We just bought lots of candy and ate it ourselves. ^_^ But what is everyone else doing for Halloween? Also, is anyone doing NaNoWriMo this year?<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>As far as actually finishing a novel, I rather doubt that.  But I think I will take time to at least put some work towards the novel I&#39;ve been working on for what feels like a decade.  And maybe I&#39;ll even get a rough outline of the RPG I want to release at approximately the same time I finally get that thing published.  </p>

            <p>I finally managed to pin down <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/participants/huinesoron/novels/gravity-s-embrace">a summary</a> for <i>Gravity&#39;s Embrace</i> (which is up to nearly 15K words; you can read the most recent section plus links to the rest <a href="http://huinesoron.livejournal.com/145440.html">here</a>). And since I had, I felt this was also a good time to knock together a front cover. (Apparently it increases your chances of finishing by 60%! Who knew?)<br><br>So I did. It&#39;s a scene (slightly modified) from the most recent sections, and it&#39;s in black and white because colouring-in is <i>hard</i>.

            <p>I need - and this is the first and only time you&#39;ll ever hear me say this - some ideas for filling out a map.<br><br><i>Gravity&#39;s Embrace</i> is set in our own semi-near future, but things have gotten a bit... strange. Western Europe looks something like this:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/GeographyIsDestiny.png"><br><br>Since I have no idea where the story is going, I also have no idea how much of the map I&#39;m going to use, but that&#39;s the thing: the more map I <i>have</i>, the more I can be inspired by.<br><br>So I want your suggestions. As the five nations on there show, they can be anything - we&#39;ve got a cultural grouping (the Celtic League), a micronation writ large (Greater Sealand), a pair of independence movements (Euskadi-Catalunya, AKA Basque Catalonia), an in-joke (Hail Liechtenstein!), and an ancient nation reborn (the New Etruscans, whose pantheon the Romans nicked). The only other point I have on the map is that the western US is dominated by Deseret, the Mormon-theocratic state they made a vague effort at in the 1850s.<br><br>Everything else is empty. And I want it to be <i>full</i>. So chuck everything you&#39;ve got at me. I don&#39;t promise to use it all (particularly if it overlaps, or if I flat-out don&#39;t have a clue what you&#39;re on about), but I&#39;d really like to fill out the world, so I probably will. ^_^ Simple names + areas are fine, but if you want to give a cultural summary, go nuts!<br><br>hS, Mad Geographer</p>

            <p>But how about: <br>The International League of True Australias?<br><br>A great collective of states of various sizes (usually really, pathetically small), scattered all over the place, from Northern Russia to Easter Island, each of which is totally certain that it is the true, one and only Australia, and that the others are all fakes. <br><br>The only factor they all really share is a total disdain they exude towards each other, and their collective title is really more of a nickname, given by all the real nations. <br><br> - You could put them anywhere you reckon&#39;s funny.

            <p>I suspect there will be two nations on the lovely west coast - Cascadia in the north, stretching along the coast from southern Alaska down through Oregon&#39;s Willamette valley (and into Redwood country beyond), and expanding inland to fill the Columbia River basin of eastern Washington. To the south, The Bear Republic of former California fills the central valley and southwards almost to LA - the LA basin and southlands in general, of course, are a blasted wasteland extension of the mojave desert. (But seriously, the good people of Deseret are not going to continue pouring the heartblood of the Colorado river in to California, and that&#39;s going to cause Problems for LA.)<br><br>Cascadia tucks really nicely into the corner of Deseret, by your map - there&#39;s a diverse economy, too, from the techno-industrial heartland of the Salish Sea ports to the rolling wheat fields of the Palouse. The nation&#39;s power sources are sustainable, massive hydro-electric facilities on the Columbia river and wind turbines dotting the coast and highlands. I&#39;m not entirely sure what your future chronology looks like, but they&#39;re probably still very upset with Washington DC for not cleaning up the Hanford site, trying to declare themselves the &quot;State of Washington&quot;, and probably beating them out in the final Superbowl before the United States fractured.<br><br>The city-state of Newer York will probably exist for as long as there is a global economy - they&#39;re probably going to take reasonable chunks of Connecticut and New Jersey with them.</p>

I had to laugh at &#39;I&#39;m not entirely sure what your future chronology looks like&#39;, though - yeah, I don&#39;t even know <i>when</i> this is set, let alone how we ended up with a world this cracked.

            <p>Vikingar (which is hard to see on the map, FYI) could be a lot bigger. There are stories, and some evidence, that the Vikings had colonies on the east coast of North America (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinland">Vinland</a>) and may have even penetrated the interior as far as Minnesota, which has a fairly significant Scandinavian heritage.

            <p>I&#39;ve tweaked the colour to make it more visible, because fair point.

            <p>Yeah, didn&#39;t see that.

            <h1>1: <i>Montenegrin Neo-Ambrosian Republic</i><br>Comprising Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, southern Croatia (with the new border extending from Buhaca to Senj), northwestern Bulgaria (including Sofia), the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and northern Albania, the MoNARchy, as it is commonly nicknamed outside its borders, is a powerful nation held together by energy exports from its fusion plants and ruled by the Captaincy-Defenderate from the Capital-University at Cetinje. MoNAR is causing something of a brain drain in neighbouring states, as its attitude is &quot;more scientists = more Scary Death Widgets that make the Gomos think twice before killing us and taking our stuff&quot;. Notably absent from its borders, however, is...<br><br>#2: <i>Kosovar Khaganate</i><br>... the Kosovar Khaganate, a brutal military dictatorship in the Spartan mould which nevertheless has managed to retain its independence as an enclave of the MoNARchy, largely due to outside support from other juntas like the Unamiguously Separate Sevastopol Republic, the Tex-Mex Republic, and...<br><br>#3: <i>The Fourth Rome</i><br>... The Fourth Rome, with its mighty capital Palatinograd (formerly St. Petersburg) fuelling a grinding war of attrition with the Gomos and fighting proxy wars against them in their interests around the world. There are other glittering cities, too - Quirinograd (Tallinn) and Caeliograd (Helsinki) on the coast, the arctic ice palaces of Esquilinograd (Tromso) - but by the decree of the Emperor Franz Karl II, none may rival Palatinograd&#39;s splendour.</h1>

            <p>&quot;Two Romes have fallen. The third stands. And there will be no fourth. No one shall replace your Christian Tsardom!&quot;<br>-- Philotheus, addressing Vasili III of Muscovy in 1510.<br><br>The idea of the Third Rome has been present throughout history, with more than a few people laying claim to it. Ivan III of Moscow, Mehmet II of the Ottomans, Mussolini, that sort of person. In your future, with those having failed at various points, we can have this Latin-inspired demented empire covering the westernmost parts of Russia as well as northern Latvia, Estonia, Finland, bits of Sweden, and the parts of northern Norway that the Vikingar either don&#39;t want or can&#39;t take back. The Third Rome of the Ottomans is dead. Long live the Fourth Rome! Long live the Emperor! Death to the infidel Mongol! Death to the heretical scientist! Glory everlasting for the Quadriromulate Patriarchate of Palatinograd! And so on.<br><br>The irony is, I had it in my head that the Muscovite Third Rome would not actually be part of the Fourth Rome - it only really reaches as far south as the border with the Battle Pope in my head. If you wanted, you could easily fit in a generic Rus state around Moscow. Also, Tsarist Russia retreating to Alaska is awesome and brilliant and you should totally do it.<br><br>As for China, maybe a Properly Paranoid fortress-state based around bunker-villages called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian_Tulou">tulou</a></i>, which in our history are a kind of rammed-earth castle-village capable of supporting hundreds of people. Perhaps this China is comprised of massive versions of same plonked everywhere, massively decentralized and massively fortified, with half the population living beneath the ground. Their exports are hydroponically-grown foodstuffs and anti-radiation technology, as well as cheap building materials... hmmm... perhaps a representative democracy, with each tulou its own constituency... just a thought.<br><br>As for the Kosovar Khaganate, I just wanted an enclave and this seemed like the best way to do it. You can never have enough paranoid juntas in sci-fi.<br><br>Apparently.<br><br>=]</p>

After all, monarchy--republic--communist--properly socialist is a reasonable trajectory.<br><br>It probably means they don&#39;t have a central government, which also means their borders are a bit... amorphous.

            <p>We all know about Cascaida (or whatever they&#39;re calling themselves), right? The breakaway state that forms out of Western Oregon, Western Washigton, and the bits of British Columbia at the very least after a political collapse in every near-future balkanized US? Full of granola-munching hippies? Yeah, so that&#39;s a good starting point, but too dang obvious. How about?<br><br>1) The Cascadian Protectorate and/or Expanded Cascadia. So, the Cascadians got into a war with someone, and realized that they should have, like, you know, an army or something. And they kind of went a bit overboard with the military and war thing and went on a conquering spree. Either south down the west coast of California to reclaim the usual liberal strongholds of SF and so on or up through Canada. Either way, you have a country that will impose modern liberal social democracy by any means necessary. There is a non-zero chance of a military junta in this scenario. (Political structure in non-core Cascadia is something you&#39;d have to define.) Border clashes with Deseret are optional.<br><br>2) The Cascadian Union. It turns out that hippies don&#39;t always form nice cohesive political units. (Or someone got way too hopped up on the idea of local democratic control.) You end up with a large collection of city-states that share a culture and basically do their own thing. The central government of the Union still does stuff, but it&#39;s rather Articles of Confederation-y. Central laws tend to be passed by constitutional amendment referendum, if at all.<br><br>I can also throw some slightly less crazy suggestions out for Central Europe.<br><br>1) Russia goes on an empire-forming rampage. Boring.<br><br>2) Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth is back! And maybe also includes the Czech Republic, Slovenia, and some other places. Low-key ethnic tensions remain an ongoing problem, but things are doing ok?<br><br>3) The Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) join in on whatever&#39;s going on in the far north.<br><br>4) Mongol invasion 2. Russia is a bit screwed. History is repeating itself with an alliance holding back the hordes somewhere in East-Central Europe. Or b) The countries that would have formed an alliance (Poland, western Ukraine, Hungary, etc.) have developed a case of nationalism and are still doing the thing, but with more internal conflict and a tense diplomatic situation.<br><br>5) Papal States v2. If the Etruscans aren&#39;t big fans of the Pope, the Papacy has probably run for it. They might have gone and set up shop somewhere in the really Catholic bits of Europe and re-formed the Papal States there because why not? (Well, mostly to fend off other upstart countries.) Which leads to<br><br>6) Orthodox League. It&#39;s ... pretty much what it sounds like, and contains most of the land area you&#39;d expect it to. Remaining minor theological disputes have been ... resolved. Westward military expansion aimed at spreading the true faith (tm) optional.<br><br>7) And for another lazy historical callback, just balkanize the place. There&#39;s bound to be some interestingly obscure lines to cut on. (The western border of what used to be the Russian Partition is probably a reasonably cutting point for Poland specifically. It might swallow up some other stuff)<br><br>- This has been speculation by someone who has no business engaging in it. Use at your own risk.</p>

            <p>The Cascadian Protectorate has historical precedent; it turns out that Cascadia is kind of good at conquering the world. We&#39;re currently doing it with assorted corporate empires - UPS, Costco, Weyerhaeuser, Paccar, Boeing, Microsoft, Amazon, T-Mobile, Starbucks... the list goes on. It wouldn&#39;t be terribly nice to turn that ability (and technology base) to warfare - but it also wouldn&#39;t be terribly hard. And, depending on how the United States breaks up, we could easily be the only nuclear-armed western successor state.<br><br>(&quot;Like, you know, an army or something&quot;? That sounds like something Californians would say.)<br><br>Ooor, if you want a <i>completely different</i> spin on future history, have Cascadia be another piece of Vikingar! We have so much in common - rugged glacial terrain, terrible weather, chronic vitamin D deficiencies... Seattle traditionally was a very Nordic town, and we&#39;re currently very politically compatible. (An independent Cascadia today would rapidly become a very liberal social democracy, in Nordic style.)</p>

            <p>Cascadia welcomes our northern neighbors, of course - I&#39;ve seen maps that propose cascadifiying the entire inside passage up to Mount Fairweather and Glacier Bay in Alaska. We would also be entirely willing to help the good people of upper British Columbia, either as part of Cascadia proper or a protectorate to be shared with our neighbors of the First Nations.<br><br>But California? <i>California?</i> That is a bridge too far, my good friend. California can keep itself and continue choking on its own ego. Bloody loud extroverts.

            <p>So my question is: in keeping with the general tenor of the map, what&#39;s the <i>weirdest</i> scenario you can imagine working? Personal union between the king of Jordan and a revived Israelite monarchy? A Nile-Euphrates Israel studded with random enclaves of &#39;The Xxxxxian Territories&#39;? Huge mechanised armies in a Shia/Sunni all-out war, with Israel playing lynchpin-kingmaker in the middle? I&#39;d quite like something that doesn&#39;t have Israel still surrounded by enemies, but also isn&#39;t just &#39;peace at last&#39;.

            <p>Well, I personally find &quot;peace at last&quot; to be the least-plausible of the &quot;realistic&quot; scenarios, so to speak. Going crazy, though? Take the Nile-Euphrates scenario, mix in a Balkanised Middle East except for Iran, and suddenly you have a Middle-Eastern Cold War between Israel and Iran, while the rest of the place is a Syria-style mess. Bonus points for Israel suffering from some sort of an insurgency — either Kahanists who find Fascist!Israel to be not racist/religious/Fascist enough, or Communists.</p>

<li> Czarist Russia Reborn.  The last surviving Romanov Pretenders finally managed to win back Russia and are in the process of reclaiming the lost imperial boarders.  I would imagine they rulers would still be somewhat lavish given they are still royalty, but would be far more spartan given them trying to prevent another revolution.<br><br>2. Acadiana.  If you&#39;re splitting up the US why not have those pesky Louisianans split off.  After all they already have their different legal system, why not make it official?<br><br>3.  Vikings.  Based out of Iceland and the Faroe Islands, and with Iceland you could even take the approximately .8% population that practices Germanic Neopaganism and make that the dominate group, and voila, true vikings.<br><br>4. Unified Korean Empire.  North and South Korea reunite, and offer a front to stand against a strong China in East Asia, smaller nations join with the Unified Korea to stand against China.  Or alternatively....<br><br>5.  A Resurgent Japanese Empire, for essentially the same reasons.  You could take it a step further and put together a new Japanese Shogunate.  <br><br>6.  5 Nations.  Native Americans decide that it is time to reclaim some of their lost culture and band together concentrating around the New York/Canadian Border </li>

            <p>For your newbie gift from me, have one free Royal Ice Cream Container! Close lid, state flavor of ice cream desired, open lid, and eat! Lather, rinse, and repeat as many times as you want. Although, this one does have a slight malfunction where every time it has a five percent chance of giving you a very fluffy pillow instead. Somehow, the pillow is always clean when you take it out. Anyways, have fun with it! Oh, and it also doubles as a very resilient shield. Cannon fire does absolutely nothing to it, so it should stay with you for a while!</p>

That and the Original Series are pretty much the only required reading around these parts.

            <p>So, I am in the process of planning a Star Wars story, and the idea I have is that a Jedi Padawan could have escaped Order 66 and now wanders the galaxy so as to remain on the move and not be as easily detected. One thing I thought that would be great for character development is that he could (without realizing it) pass the Trials, and I have planned realistic scenarios for each Trial. I thought at some point he could become a Knight, but here&#39;s my problem... I have no idea how he could be promoted. He&#39;d have a travelling companion at some point, but he or she would not be Force-sensitive, and the OC&#39;s Master will have died long ago. As I haven&#39;t officially watched Rebels yet (but I know quite a bit about it), I don&#39;t want him mixing up with any canon characters from there. So technically, no other Jedi will have witnessed his Trials to say he is worthy of Knighthood. And I think we can pretty much all agree that it would be selfish of him to dub himself a Knight, or demand that another Jedi knight him. So with all of this, would he remain a Padawan forever? I&#39;m not against that idea, by the way; but I know that option is a possibility in this scenario.</p>

            <p>The ones I can think of being:<br><br>1) A Jedi Temple. <br>While the rules on Force ghosts aren&#39;t quite clear (in either canon, so far as I know) it might be possible for your character to stumble across some lesser known Jedi outpost and be confronted by a guardian or spirit there, and be promoted by them. <br><br>2) Someone who knew Jedi tradition well enough to decide if your character would be worthy. <br>Perhaps a historian of some description, a member of another Force using group (depending on whether this is Disney or Legends), a notable associate of a Jedi Master, or someone who worked in the Temple itself. I know you said it would be selfish of him to Knight himself, but perhaps it would be different if he didn&#39;t make that judgment himself? I dunno.<br><br>3) A Jedi Holocron. <br>While the Holocron gatekeeper (provided those are still a thing in Disney canon) wouldn&#39;t have the authority to actually Knight anyone, it would certainly know better than most when a person is worthy of the title, and after a while of being considered a Knight in all but name, why not just accept it? Goes back to the Knighting himself thing, but I&#39;d say it would be entirely reasonable to consider yourself a Knight if the closest thing to a Jedi Master you&#39;re likely to find says you&#39;ve earned it. Suppose it depends on the character, though. And there&#39;s the rather significant problem of how to find a Holocron. <br><br>4) A former Jedi.<br>While Jedi Masters leaving the Order wasn&#39;t a common thing, there are enough instances in Legends to justify making one of your own, and if it&#39;s Legends, then there&#39;s a whole new canon to work with. Of course, that also means there&#39;s a whole new canon to trip over, but I&#39;m sure you could make it work. As long as you could find a plausible reason for the Master to leave the Order (the horrors of the Clone Wars, for instance) then I see no reason why they couldn&#39;t survive Order 66 long enough to meet and promote your character. Hard to track a Jedi who&#39;s not a Jedi anymore, after all.<br><br>Hope that&#39;s a least a little bit helpful, and if you need any more help feel free to drop me a line. I may not be quite the expert I used to be, but Star Wars remains my all time favorite fandom.</p>

            <p>If you have to ask whether or not it&#39;s badfic, it&#39;s probably not worth sporking.

            <p>Lapis&#39; being momentarily upset was because Ami referred to Violet as &quot;Vi&quot;, so Lapis thought that she was referring to Violet Parr, a canon character whom Sarah knew and ALSO addressed as &quot;Vi&quot;.

            <p>I like that Lapis got some character development, and the interpretation of the author&#39;s note in the beginning as a sock puppet show.<br>Still, there&#39;s a couple of issues I have with this mission and they may be reoccurring issues in previous missions and missions some other authors have written as well. <br><br>1) Minimal description of the surroundings during the mission. <br><br>Although the badfic just states the location (I think?), the mission&#39;s surroundings aren&#39;t that much better. The mission just gives enough description to establish the surroundings and not much more than that. <br><br>Example: <br>Just then, the scene shifted around the agents, dropping them in another big heap. This time, they found themselves on a sandy beach, bordered by a wide selection of pastel-colored buildings.<br><br>And that was it. Even after the agents finished unpiling themselves, there was no mention of the sea breeze, no mention of the sounds of the ocean, no mention of the color of the sky, etc. Even if the location became generic because of the badfic, a description of what had become of the beach would be nice. <br><br>2) When agents are observing, it reads like an mst.<br><br>I think it&#39;s because the mission has copied-and-pasted chunks of badfic when paraphrasing would work better. <br><br>Example:<br>However they noticed something strange about, not only about the marking but instead of coming in pointing it was holding something.<br><br>All of them stared at it.<br>&quot;Is that…&quot; said Amethyst.<br>&quot;It is.&quot; Said Pearl not knowing how to react.<br>&quot;It&#39;s a white flag.&quot; Said Garnet.<br>&quot;Wait… does that mean they&#39;re coming in peace?&quot; asked Steven.<br>On the ship both the orange one and the lavender one stared at the white flag the ship was holding.<br>&quot;This seems like a really stupid idea.&quot; Mumbled the orange one to herself.<br>(Then there&#39;s the reaction from the agents)<br><br>For this example, I think it would have worked better if you described the scene more like the agents are watching what the characters do. Writing the scene as just a copied passage then a response, looks to me less like the agents are actually spying on the scene and more like the agents are doing an mst, giving the feeling of not really being there even when they actually are.<br><br><br>I think that&#39;s all for the criticism. I know you worked very hard on the mission and I want you to know that I&#39;m glad you had fun writing it!<br></p>

            <p>About the lack of description; I get the sense that a) we were trying to avoid bogging down the story with scenery and/or b) the particular way we played GDoc tag didn&#39;t allow for a lot of description. You&#39;re right that we could use more, though. (Skarmory also says he figured Beach City was pretty well-defined in the audience&#39;s heads.)<br><br>And, yeah, in retrospect it does read a lot more like an MST than it probably should. But on the other hand, we got two great gags out of the format--Lapis turning into a graph and Violet&#39;s spittake. Again, you raise some good points about why it didn&#39;t quite work, and I&#39;ll make a special effort to summarize/paraphrase more in my next mission. Thanks for the constructive criticism, and I&#39;m glad you enjoyed the story otherwise! :)</p>

            <p>Honestly, this mission suffers from some of the same things I&#39;ve noticed recurring in Skarmory&#39;s other missions: an excess of characters, a lot of backstory-dumping, and a lot of inter-character bickering.  In this case, things between Lapis and Aiko are less justified than between Lapis and Backslash, which doesn&#39;t really help things.  And Violet, Ami, and Seung-Li don&#39;t contribute all that much to the mission, at least in the first half, though they do gain more personality once they split up.  In all honesty, the smaller groups give the characters a lot more chance to shine.  On the other hand, I&#39;m not sure that it makes sense in mission terms; you can&#39;t really have one group handle every other chapter, because they&#39;ll miss a lot of details, and charges of poor in-fic continuity will be harder to catch.<br><br>It is nice to see Lapis get called out for her behavior; I have to agree with Sarah that she spends way too much time angsting about her background.  However, I think having her overcome her personal problems via magical regeneration seems a bit... cheap.  Aside from the Heroic Sacrifice, which is a bit on the cliche side, she&#39;s said she&#39;s going to change, but the progress gets made without us actually seeing the character development.  It&#39;s also confusing because I can&#39;t tell if this occurs before or after &quot;Witches Get Stitches.&quot;  In terms of characterization, it seems more like the latter one came first, as this one continues the trend of Lapis learning to get past her issues and disagreements, but it&#39;d make more sense for her speech and swearing patterns to change after regeneration.  (Swearing is something people usually do instinctively, so it doesn&#39;t really make sense for someone to begin swearing in a language they&#39;ve just learned, unless there&#39;s some other factor at play.)  Also, I&#39;m not really sure about Lapis regaining her waterbending powers.  I mean, I know they&#39;re not necessarily overpowered, they just don&#39;t really seem like a necessary power-up.  It kind of feels like she&#39;s being rewarded just for making a token effort to get better.  I know the Heroic Sacrifice was supposed to be the major point, but given that she recovered fairly effortlessly, it takes away some of the impact.<br><br>I did like the other characters a lot, especially Seung-Li and Violet.  I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t have more positive comments.  It&#39;s not a bad mission or anything, and I found the action pretty easy to follow.  You also did a good job explaining the Steven Universe stuff, at least.</p>

            <p>The reason for Lapis and Aiko starting off as enemies in this mission is best explained by the co-written interlude <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ewCNp6y9PP_E1rIbHdhNiRSwShmuK9wgsxj5yU-C2I/edit?usp=sharing">&quot;Child&#39;s Play&quot;</a>, which I should&#39;ve provided as a primer: Aiko was jealous that Lapis got to become an agent before her, and Lapis retaliated but took it too personally. I guess we could&#39;ve made that clearer if we&#39;d intended for this mission to stand out on its own, though.<br><br>Splitting the party was a decision that we all agreed upon while writing the fic, and as noted in the dialogue, the in-universe justification was that Lapis and Aiko were fighting so much at the time that they had to be separated until things calmed down. We were well-aware of the risk of continuity not being covered as effectively, so we assumed that each of the teams would relay charges that they covered to the other team offscreen every once in a while. It&#39;s why Lapis, Ami, and Aiko were all able to recite the charge list in full without having to cut each other off to fill in what they missed.<br><br>This mission takes place after &quot;Witches Get Stitches&quot;, which occurred in December 2015 (and Cupid&#39;s first date happened in early 2016, and this mission takes place at the same time as said date). Looking back, one of the failings in this case was that we&#39;d already had &quot;Girls&#39; Night Out&quot; technically finished and in the process of beta reading by the time &quot;Witches Get Stitches&quot; was even conceived in my head. I guess I should&#39;ve expected this insertion of a mission into an already pre-planned series of events to cause a bit of a continuity snarl, and modified Lapis&#39; language use and personality for both missions to make the flow a bit more consistent.<br><br>The magical regeneration changing Lapis&#39; personality and the waterbending abilities are both derived from the Steven Universe continuum and Lapis&#39; gemsona. Armenus is stated to be a variant of Canon!Lapis Lazuli&#39;s gem &quot;species&quot;, if you can call it that; it&#39;s been established that Lapis has incredibly powerful hydrokinetic abilities, and lapis armenus (the mineral) is closely related enough to lapis lazuli that it made sense for Armenus to be a Lapis variant. It&#39;s also worth remembering that regeneration both allowing a complete recovery and changing the gem&#39;s personality is something that happens in canon as well. If there was one thing I did wrong it was probably having Lapis transition into her Taking the Bullet for Aiko more suddenly than readers would&#39;ve liked, especially given that the entire MO of this mission was to resolve the conflict between the two of them and put them on the road to repairing whatever relationship there could&#39;ve been between these two. I can say with confidence however that Lapis&#39; story is far from over, and that her next appearance will hopefully smooth out her development as well as deconstruct the resurgence of her abilities - her waterbending is, after all, still rudimentary.<br><br>I&#39;m glad there are things to like about this mission, and I agree that Seung-Li and Violet were awesome to work with. If anything, Lapis&#39; character arc does have potential now for further growth and ironing out the kinks in said growth the next time she shows up. Unfortunately, it&#39;ll be a while before she does, since I&#39;ve decided to shift my focus away from my DIC team now that this leg of her character arc is complete. With luck and a fair wind, my next few published missions won&#39;t have so much exposition or sideline arguments - especially because they definitely won&#39;t be sixty pages long!</p>

            <p>I hadn&#39;t read the interlude, and I&#39;m sure that does make a difference.  Even still, it comes off a little as &quot;Oh look, Lapis has yet another ongoing quarrel with someone.&quot;<br><br>Splitting the party does make sense in a narrative way, as well as to some extent in-universe.  And having them report back to each other also makes sense.  It just seems a little awkward to switch from one team encountering Malachite to the other.  Maybe if it was shown that they were still in contact (which could include warning the other about Malachite) it&#39;d seem less risky.<br><br>I&#39;m aware that the regenerative thing is canon; as a resolution to Lapis&#39;s behavior problems, however, it still feels a little abrupt.  That said, I&#39;m sure that future missions will show that it isn&#39;t quite as over as it seems to be here.</p>

            <p>Yeah, it was a bit sudden to have Lapis and company switch out right as Sarah&#39;s team went in DURING Malachite&#39;s entry. Then again, of course, it could be possible that the former group warned the latter offscreen, since Lapis and co. witnessed Malachite first.<br><br>And yeah, like I said, Lapis&#39; story will continue in due course. She does, after all, have a few new attributes to have to deal with.</p>

            <p>Hey we all know how our old stuff can be embarrassing,remind us of how far we come and sometimes make good riffing material? <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/ux5tBNflyZA"> This is the first video</a> in a series where someone looks over their old sonic oc and the comic they made of them. <br><br>Here are the <a href="https://youtu.be/Aa88dskI35Q">other</a>   <a href="https://youtu.be/gNBuy58-Pbw"> two </a> which cover a sprite comic the creator made of their oc. They also have a video of just the dramatic reading of the pencil comic without their comments. However I find it&#39;s better with the creator&#39;s reactions.  <br><br>It&#39;s a fun little watch and I figured you&#39;d guys enjoy it. </p>

            <p>You do this paging thing a lot, creating a new thread just to get the attention of one specific person, sometimes regarding things that are still on the front page of the Board. Every time, I think to myself, is that really necessary? Is it so absolutely vital that people view and/or respond to your comments that just making the post isn&#39;t enough?<br><br>I can understand wanting to draw attention to something that may have fallen off the front page, or maybe something that&#39;s been missed for a few days or so, but I just looked at the time stamps of this post and the one you&#39;re referring to, and they&#39;re a minute apart. That&#39;s <i>definitely</i> not necessary. Especially for threads like mission plugs and the like, you can be pretty sure the people responsible are keeping an eye out for any feedback as long as the thread is visible—and creating a new thread about it brings older thread closer to falling out of view that much faster, so it&#39;s a bit self-defeating.<br><br>Give people some time to see what you&#39;re talking about before worrying about it and taking up one of the limited thread slots on the Board, yeah? Please also consider other options, such as contacting them in a reply to a recent post in an existing thread or via e-mail, Discord PM, or their wiki talk pages. The entire Board does not need an up-to-the-minute breaking news report that SOH has commented on someone&#39;s stuff, y&#39;know?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Welcome, welcome. Seems like everybody else took care of the questions, so here, have this Royal Ice Cream Container! Close lid, state desired flavor, open lid, enjoy. Repeat as many times as desired. This container also happens to be very resilient, so if you have a shrink ray and need to escape from a nuclear bomb, you can use the shrink ray on yourself and hide in the container.</p>

            <p>Okay, so, how to phrase this? I have an idea for an agent that I really, really want to use (she&#39;s one of my very old characters). However, I dropped her home continuum book series a long time ago because I could see that it was becoming waaaay too long-winded and was by now a clear cash grab (it&#39;s still going, btw). I still remember the majority of rules and canon characters, though. And I do want to use this character in some way and in doing so fulfill a personal goal of mine. So seeing as how I&#39;m not up-to-date on the character&#39;s home continuum, would it be a bad idea to make an agent from there?</p>

            <p>Assuming that events in this book series (what is it? is it a secret?) take place on a linear timeline—that is, each new book takes place after the ones before it—then you could just have your character be from the latest time you remember and have them not be aware of anything that happens later in the series. It would be like having a character from an earlier era in Earth&#39;s history. If they&#39;re from, say, the Renaissance, they could be forgiven for not knowing much about what&#39;s happened since and holding some beliefs about the world that have now been outmoded. Same goes for a character from an earlier point in their canon, I&#39;d think.<br><br>That said, I&#39;d be leery of doing it myself without at least brushing up on major events/changes in the canon. Does it have a wiki? Just about everything does.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m willing to bet that Ix and Charlotte weren&#39;t even at the halfway point of the badfic before they decided to do the Duty. Am I in the ballpark?<br><br>As for the usual SOH post-mission usual fare:<br>1) <i>“This is why establishing the setting is important, people,” Charlotte said through gritted teeth. “Also, can we charge for showing thought-speech as bolded italics?”</i><br>Actually, that shouldn&#39;t be a charge. Unless things have changed on FFN, they actually have a problem with chevrons. <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/313894/1/The-Kelbrid-War-How-to-shatter-trust">An unfinished Animorphs goodfic that I ran across</a> (the very first FFN fic that I ever read, IIRC), ran into this issue the hard way.<br><br>2) <i>The chapter ended with the Animorphs agreeing that Ax and Tobias would watch the Sue, and the agents were thrown into the next, landing in the yard outside her house.</i><br>The next what? Obviously the answer is &quot;chapter&quot;, but it takes a few moments&#39; thought to figure that out. Please consider being a bit more specific; it only requires adding one more word.<br><br>3) <i>So they followed the canons and Sue until they found the entrance to the Yeerk Pool inside the employees only room, though Ax was a bit too distracted by the Sue’s beauty to think about such silly things.</i><br>&quot;employees only&quot; should be hyphenated.<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m still holding out for an appropriately god-awful crossover, preferably involving Ax or other Andalites, in case anybody happens to see one. The best I&#39;ve got right now is <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8050775/1/The-54th-Hunger-Games">this</a>, which is maybe better MST material than mission material. The author&#39;s notes almost outweigh the story, if you can call it that. O.o<br><br>(Making Ilraen and Farilan MST it could be fun, though, come to think of it...)<br><br>Anyway, the mission! I enjoyed it, and I&#39;m interested in this new take on fixing the problem of Ix and Lottie&#39;s different lifespans. Charlotte researching ways to de-vamp herself from various continua could be a fun exploration of different takes on the vampire myth, but even not getting into it in detail, it still provides some food for thought. It also shows how devoted she is to being with Ix, which is a great bit of characterization.<br><br>Speaking of showing over telling, the mission did a good job of highlighting how the Sue failed at it with regards to her angsting about her lack of friends while at the same time behaving in an obnoxiously standoffish way. And wow, the speshulness. Jeez. Good riddance to her.<br><br>I did have one moment of confusion here:<br><br><i>Ax and Tobias retreated to the bathrooms to morph cockroaches, and just as they were making their way back to the pool entrance, the scene changed again, dumping the agents behind the stack of hay bales.</i><br><br>It took me a minute to figure out that the scene had changed back to Cassie&#39;s barn rather than something new, so I struggled a bit trying to make sense of hay bales in a Yeerk pool, where I&#39;d have expected the story to go next. Y&#39;know, if the fic had actually bothered itself with detailing an important action like scouting enemy territory. {= P This could be easily fixed by the addition of a few words, either &quot;the scene changed <s>again</s> <b>back to Cassie&#39;s barn</b>&quot; or &quot;behind the stack of hay bales <b>in Cassie&#39;s barn</b>.&quot; (Not both, of course.)<br><br>I feel bad for Lottie at the end. Unbridled hope and enthusiasm meets the cold steel wall of elitism and xenophobia. Ouch. Good to know Ilraen has been seeing her <i>nice</i> side so far. Guess he&#39;s in for a rude awakening when he finds out just how much work he has cut out for him.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad the new solution (which I have Hardric to thank for) is being much better recieved. ^^; Unfortunately, most continua I know of don&#39;t have cures for vampirism :P Apparently it tends to be a one-way trip.<br><br>Charlotte&#39;s devotion to Ix is... complicated. How much of it is her own personality, and how much of it is her home canon&#39;s influence?

            <p>Well, you mentioned TES, which I think does have a cure for vampirism. I know the Dragonborn can become one in a <i>Skyrim</i> expansion, and I&#39;m pretty sure you can cure yourself, too. Whether it would work on an outsider, though, who knows?<br><br>The Buffyverse doesn&#39;t have a cure, but I wonder, do Twipires have souls, or not? I seem to recall Edward angsting about being a soulless monster, but since he never particularly acts like one, it&#39;s hard to tell if he&#39;s speaking the truth or not. But, I bring it up because the idea of Lottie going on a <i>Buffy</i>-style quest to get her soul back struck me as interesting. It wouldn&#39;t make her not a vampire anymore, but still, maybe it&#39;s something she would want anyway? Might help to clear up that confusion about obsession vs. love, which was a bit of a thing in the show.<br><br>And if you haven&#39;t seen <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, it&#39;s worth a binge. <i>Angel</i>, too, if you&#39;ve got time, though it doesn&#39;t quite reach <i>Buffy</i>&#39;s average level of quality. Contains an awesome musical episode, an apparent Sue-insert character, and an in-universe Gary Stu! All this plus ten thousande Elephantes!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Vampirism in TES is a result of a magical disease — Sanguinare Vampiris — or, in rare cases, rape by <a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Molag_Bal">Molag Bal</a>. There two ways to cure vampirism in <i>Skyrim</i>:<br>1) Turning into a werewolf purges your body of the disease (Skyrim werewolves are immune to disease); however, that has its own problems, such as the Daedric Prince Hircine claiming your soul after death.<br>2) There is a wizard named Falion that knows a ritual to purge vampirism. However, you need a filled Black Soul Gem for it — ie, you need to murder a sentient being; their soul is used as sacrifice to the Daedra so that they will cure your vampirism. This ritual can also cleanse the &quot;pure&quot; form of vampirism conferred by Molag Bal.<br>There&#39;s no reason why either of those won&#39;t work for someone that isn&#39;t the Dovahkiin, but each of those has its own downsides.</p>

            <p>Sanguinary Vampiris may not be the only form of vampirism in the Elder Scrolls. It&#39;s called Porphyric Hemophilia in Oblivion and Morrowind, and while it&#39;s possible they&#39;re the same thing known by different names I think it&#39;s more likely separate strains of the disease.

            <p>So as we all know from Florida way back in 2000, one of the best ways to drag out an election is to call for recounts. There have been various rumours that Clinton might do that, and several purported reasons why (one being a mismatch between results from paper and electronic votes, when Russian hacking has already been part of the electoral season), but so far she hasn&#39;t.<br><br><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/23/jill-stein-election-recount-fund-michigan-wisconsin-pennsylvania">But now Jill Stein has</a>.<br><br>Apparently you don&#39;t have to be in with a shot of winning to request a recount - you just have to <i>be on the ballot</i>. And to pay for it, which, uh, <a href="https://jillstein.nationbuilder.com/recount">she&#39;s up to $2.5 million now</a>. That&#39;s far more than the amount needed to file for a recount in Wisconsin (which has to be done by tomorrow), and should cover the actual fees for said recount.<br><br>So, yeah. I don&#39;t even <i>know</i> if you should donate to this at this point; I have absolutely no clue what&#39;s going on any more.<br><br>Wheeeeeeeeee, 2016!<br><br>hS<br><br></p>

            <p>And everyone who knows me well should know my opinion on Jill Stein. (Namely, that she&#39;s doing her level best to be the left-wing equivalent of the Tea Party.)<br><br>And, yet... I can respect her, just a tiny bit, for doing this. Because, even after the lies she&#39;s spread about people like me, it seems she&#39;s fighting against Trump in a way she&#39;s uniquely positioned for.<br><br>Because she never had a chance of winning in the first place. It&#39;s not the loser being petty, like it&#39;d be seen if Clinton did it. &quot;Pettiness&quot; is, of course, not even within a LIGHT YEAR of how terrible Trump is, but the point is that Stein doing this is better for Clinton than Clinton doing this. It gets the recount done and lets Clinton save face.<br><br>It&#39;s a well-executed bit of politics, at the very least.</p>

            <p>The thing about the Roman Empire is that virtually <i>everyone</i> lost to them. They were really, really good at what they did. But that doesn&#39;t mean people weren&#39;t right to try.<br><br>Of course, we in Britain have a pretty weird view of our various conquerors: they tend to turn into the heroes of the <i>next</i> round of conquests. We all cheer on Boudicca when she burns London, but add another 300-400 years and:<br><br><i>When Rome fell, like a writhen oak<br>That age had sapped and cankered at the root<br>Resisting from her topmost bough there broke<br>The miracle of one unwithering shoot.</i><br><br>Romano-British Arthur becomes the hero against the Saxons. And then the Saxons become the heroes against the Vikings and the Normans. Even the Norman kings end up as heroes against Cromwell and his Parliamentarians (debatably). We&#39;re an odd country. Comes of being an island - whoever occupies a chunk of Great Britain for more than a hundred years becomes <i>our people</i>, and British, whoever they started out as.<br><br>Which is why the current far-right craze for Britishness makes about as much sense as... as King Arthur in full plate armour. IE, none.<br><br>~<br><br>Regarding the translation: it varies. Remember &#39;desert&#39; means &#39;deserted&#39;, in the final analysis. &#39;Wasteland&#39; is another popular variant. But Terry Pratchett used &#39;desert&#39;, so that&#39;s self-evidently the best. ^_~<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Climate change. Sensible taxation. Forgiveness on student debt. And, most importantly for me, the preservation and upholding of the First Amendment.<br><br>That last issue, truly, is why I loath Trump so much. I am an enthusiastic supporter of the First Amendment. I am to the First what an NRA member is to the Second. It&#39;s a shame that most First Amendment groups are full of bigots that just want to stop being criticized. To me, the ability for a populace to discuss, debate, and read about absolutely anything they so wish without fear of legal persecution is the cornerstone of any true civilized country. The freedom to practice any religion one wants (as long as it&#39;s not a murder cult or something) without fear of persecution by the government is quite literally a major reason this country came to be. The ability of the press to publish what they wish without being silenced is, perhaps beyond anything else, a tremendous tool against tyranny.<br><br>And if Donald Trump has his way? You can kiss the First Amendment goodbye.<br><br>Forget his ban on Muslims, though believe me I wont, he has spoken at multiple points how he wants the ability to revoke the freedom of the press, because they joke about him, or expose him for just how bad a businessman he truly is. He revels in suing people who disagree. Heck, he even stated how he wants to regulate the internet! To me, despite what most &quot;First Amendment Supporters&quot; say, Donald Trump is the greatest treat to the constitution that as shown themselves in a long, long time.<br><br>Also, side note? If anyone who is &quot;Pro First Amendment&quot; ever complains about criticism from the &quot;PC crowd&quot;, they are not pro First Amendment. They want to say bigoted things without criticism. I believe everyone has a right to their opinion, and the right to express it. Even the KKK and Westboro. But you know who else has the right to their opinions and ability to express them? Those who think your opinions are wrong. If you are anti-debate and discussion, you are anti-First Amendment. Sorry. Had to get that off my chest.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not very eloquent about policy, but basically, anyone who ignores that whole &quot;liberty and justice for all&quot; thing they make us pledge allegiance to every day of our young lives is not fit to lead this country.<br><br>I&#39;m not deaf to the complaints that Clinton MAY have done some questionable things, but... she was never proven to have actually done them, or to have any actual malice aforethought. So... what&#39;s left to dislike? (Well, for me, she&#39;s not as progressive as Bernie Sanders, who I really wanted.

            <p>Yes, the news is depressing. But in two years, we have a chance to cut this off at the knees. Figuratively speaking. <br><br>I keep trying to think through this. Apparently, both sides of this divide are terrified of the other. I know why I&#39;m terrified of Republican platforms - this election especially.* But… why are they afraid of us? I don&#39;t want to take their freedoms away. Not to go to church. Not to proselytize. Not even, believe it or not, to own guns. I&#39;d like to see fewer domestic terrorist attacks, so fewer high-magazine guns. Maybe more checks against domestic abusers and people with violence problems buying them. But, as someone who&#39;s lived a long time in a rural area, I fully understand the necessity of some gun ownership. And that is honestly the norm - &quot;ban all guns&quot; is a radical and not well supported position. I can&#39;t think of any freedom of republicans that I don&#39;t support. Not one. I just want more people to have a voice. <br><br>Seriously. I know there are some republicans on here. Help me out, guys. Why are you afraid of Democratic positions?<br><br><br><br>* Pence literally believes in conversion therapy. Shock therapy at that. Trump wanted to deport all Muslims. And Mexicans. And those of Mexican descent. More wars are scary - partly because of the American lives, partly because of the civilian lives lost on the other side. They&#39;re likely to cut funding for education; I fear both the broad costs to society and for my personal future, since I am an educator. They are likely to promote policies that lead to unplanned pregnancies, and cut funding for even early abortions. </p>

            <p>Before I go any further, please allow me to correct your question. You ask: “Why are you afraid of Democratic positions?”<br><br>I, for one, do not think that we are <em>afraid</em> of Democratic positions, per se, as much as that we<em> vehemently disagree</em>.<br><br>The things that I, for one, <em>am</em> afraid of, however are <br>1) Democratic positions being touted by media and academia as the only reasonable opinion, and<br>2) conservative successes at the ballot box being derailed by left-leaning lawyers in black robes.<br><br>Even though I am no hillbilly (obviously), that Cracked article that Neshomeh mentions is more on-the-nose than one might expect. Give it a read.<br><br>That said, allow me to reply to the topics you brought up.<br><br><ul>
<br><li><em>I don&#39;t want to take their freedoms away. Not to go to church. Not to proselytize.</em></li>
<br>
</ul>
<br><br>As a preliminary matter, I do not know anyone who feels that the Democrats are trying to strip Christians of their right <em>to go to church</em>. The issue is that we may be told—via social pressure even if not via government fiat—that we are to keep our beliefs <em>within the walls of the church</em>.<br><br>Take the gay-marriage issue, for one. As I mentioned in a previous post on the Board: “I am not speaking in hypotheticals here, it is clear from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85ke_Green">Europe</a> and even here in the <a href="http://www.adfmedia.org/News/PRDetail/8700">United</a> <a href="http://www.adfmedia.org/News/PRDetail/5537">States</a> as well that wherever gay marriage goes, forced acceptance thereof follows.” And I do not think that I need to post a link to talk about the lawsuits that have arisen over Christian business owners not wanting to participate in gay weddings.<br><br>As far as we conservatives see it, the liberal looks at the evangelical Christian, at best, like an adult looks at a little kid who doesn’t know any better: “That’s cute. You’ll understand when you grow older.” And at worst, they think of us as bigots.<br><br>In short, the prevailing orthodoxy is slowly becoming, “That’s nice that you believe what that millennia-old book says. But we don’t bring that sort of stuff up in polite society.”<br><br>The conservative’s reaction (quoting from the Cracked article): “Their heads are so far up their [hind ends] that they can&#39;t tell up from down. Basic, obvious truths that have gone unquestioned for thousands of years now get laughed at and shouted down.”<br><br>So, no, no one is afraid of Democrats telling us not to go to church. Or even telling us we cannot preach the Gospel. The fear is that we will be seen as bigots once we do, simply because we actually take the Bible’s teachings seriously out in the working world.<br><br>(Is it any wonder, then, that with the death of a conservative icon like Scalia, Republicans would bend over backwards to make sure a liberal does not take his place? Before Scalia’s death, the Court was in precarious balance, with four conservatives, four liberals, and Kennedy the swing vote. A Clinton win, and thus a Clinton appointee to the Court, would have led to guaranteed losses for us, 6-3 or 5-4 depending on where Kennedy swings. At least with a balanced Court, there’s some hope that the pendulum can swing in our favor.)<br><br><ul>
<br><li><em>Not even, believe it or not, to own guns. I&#39;d like to see fewer domestic terrorist attacks, so fewer high-magazine guns. Maybe more checks against domestic abusers and people with violence problems buying them. But, as someone who&#39;s lived a long time in a rural area, I fully understand the necessity of some gun ownership. And that is honestly the norm - &quot;ban all guns&quot; is a radical and not well supported position.</em></li>
<br>
</ul>
<br><br>And I personally agree with much of what you said there. As far as this particular topic goes, I think that the case is that there’s a lot of misinformation and hyperbole on both sides. AFAIK, and please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, The Right claims that the Left wants to take away their guns, and the Left says that the Right wants no regulations whatsoever.<br><br>This topic brings up a theme that everyone should ponder: For as much as any one side can talk about the other, how much does the talker really know about the other side? Who is really listening to what they are actually saying? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc">It’s easy to argue against a caricature</a>, but not every divide is unbridgeable. Some legitimately are “believe <em>our</em> position or believe <em>their</em> position”, but some divides can be bridged. I believe that gun control is one of them.<br><br>And that’s it as far as your particular post goes. However, there is one more issue that I would like to bring up: immigration.<br><br>AFAIK, no sane conservative believes that <em>all </em>foreigners should be barred from the United States. However, it must not be denied that we have laws that determine who can come in and the processes they must undergo. However, Mexicans just traipsing across the border are flouting those laws, taking advantage of birthright citizenship to make it harder to uproot them (“You heartless Republicans want to tear innocent <em>families</em> apart!”), and are basically freeloading off of America.<br><br>Granted, it can take way too long for someone outside the country to be able to get a visa to get in (I know this firsthand: my father wants to bring one of my aunts here from Haiti, and the wait for a visa is <em>years</em> if you’re a married sibling of a citizen, as opposed to, e.g., a child of a citizen or an unmarried sibling), but we should not reward those who have flouted the laws.<br><br>Personally, I do not think that <em>all</em> illegal immigrants should be deported, but we must <em>first </em>find a way to stop any further illegal entry into the United States, and <em>then</em> <em>and only then</em> address what to do with those already here. Announce the second without doing the first, and you’ll only get more border-crossers hoping to arrive in time to receive the “amnesty”.<br><br>I could theoretically go on for ages, but I honestly have no idea where to go from here, so I’ll just stop at this point. At the very least, I thank you for being willing to open a dialogue—who knows what either of us may learn?</p>

Okay, I suppose if the name of your business is "Christian Weddings for Straight Christian Couples," you're exempt from the above logic. Have fun catering to your niche market; just don't be surprised if it doesn't pay enough to keep the doors open.<br> </em><br> Your formation of the premise is correct…in part. Hopefully, no Christian believes that, e.g., a gas station owner should refuse service to a gay driver, or that a Christian who owns a grocery store should try to weed out the gays from among his patrons. Where I see the line being drawn, however, is where the owner believes he is being asked to <em>participate</em> in the <em>celebration</em> of something he believes is sin. Obviously, there is room for disagreement: Some Christians believe that the Christian baker is no different than the gas station owner or convenience store owner, while others believe that the fact that a personalized service is being given for this particular event is tantamount to giving his imprimatur to it.<br> To give what I believe would be a parallel example: Are you familiar with the show “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_Boss">Cake Boss</a>”? Now let’s say that a member of the KKK wanted Buddy to make them a cake to celebrate an upcoming anniversary. Here’s the question: Does that member of the KKK have the right to demand that he be able to get a cake <em>from Buddy</em>, or does Buddy have the right to say that he does not want his name associated with them? (Or to extend the hypothetical even further: would the inevitable change.org petitions that would erupt be wrongheaded?)<br> <br> As I think about this, though, perhaps I should have looked for a different example of my fear that any dissent to the portrayal of homosexuality as a harmless “alternative lifestyle” would be <em>ipso facto</em> branded as bigotry. So allow me to use a different example.<br> I’m sure you at least heard about the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Has_Two_Mommies">“Heather Has Two Mommies”</a>. Now, I will readily admit that I have <em>not</em> read the book, nor do I know whether it is used in schools; I am only using this as a foundation for my argument.<br> Given the increasing visibility of homosexuality, and the nigh-inevitability that homosexual couples will start to form families, I am willing to concede that children will have to learn that these arrangements exist. The point that I’m trying to make is that if that child’s parents try to teach him that such an arrangement is sinful, my fear is that such an opinion would be deemed to be as gauche as that of a racist who hates interracial marriage. However, while the racist hasn’t a leg to stand on (“[God] hath made of one blood all nations of men”), the Christian has every right to believe what he believes.<br> <br> Is there room for the other side to disagree? Certainly.<br> To refuse to patronize our establishments? Of course.<br> But to use the courts to silence dissent? To use the schools to tell the next generation that the Christian is no better than the racist? That’s where I draw the line.<br> </li>
<br><li>
<em>Seriously, so what if it's not as bad as 99% of reputable scientists say it is? Can't we make the world a better place anyway?</em><br> <br> I do not want to argue about climate change. That was not my intention.<br> <br> Please recall the history of this thread:<br> <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=302947;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">VixenMage asked</a>: “Why are you afraid of Democratic positions?”<br> <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=303030;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">I replied</a>: “I, for one, do not think that we are <em>afraid</em> of Democratic positions, per se, as much as that we<em> vehemently disagree</em>. The things that I, for one, <em>am</em> afraid of, however are <br> 1) Democratic positions being touted by media and academia as the only reasonable opinion…”<br> And my interaction with Seafarer is an illustration of just that: the point remains that <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=303067;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">there are reputable scientists that believe that climate change, though extant, is not the existential threat that it is being touted as being</a>.<br> That is all I wanted to say: that to deny that man-made climate change will turn Earth into Venus if nothing isn’t done should not automatically lead to that person being labeled as a conspiracy theorist. As long as you can back up your opinion with facts, you should be heard. To allude to something you alluded to in your own post: it used to be the majority opinion that the Sun revolved around the Earth. I’m willing to bet that 99% of the scientists of Copernicus’s day said the same. Yet nowadays, we hold it as unquestionable truth that Copernicus was correct.<br> <br> Now, yes, obviously, green technology is generally a good thing to invest in regardless of how much of a threat global warming is: no one wants to live in a smog-filled city, for example. But that’s the point: there are generally other reasons <em>besides</em> global warming (clean air, clean water) to invest in technologies that pollute less than current technology does. The only point of contention would be whether a new technology would be worth the added expense if its only saving grace was that it prevented global warming—a controversy that I am admittedly ill-equipped to confront, and which is beyond the scope of what I wanted to say.</li>

            <p>This is an extreme example:<br><br>&quot;Instead of high income taxes, let&#39;s think about universal wealth redistribution.&quot;<br><br>It works like this: &#39;here&#39;s an extreme thing we can all agree not to like (except Scapegrace and hS and Kaitlyn WHATEVS); the thing we&#39;re actually discussing is like it, but less so; therefore you can see why I don&#39;t like it.&#39;<br><br>You didn&#39;t do that. I accept that you were <i>trying</i> to do that, but you didn&#39;t. You did something more like this:<br><br>&quot;Instead of high-speed car racing, let&#39;s talk about stabbing people in the eyeballs.&quot;<br><br>Stabbing people in the eyeballs is not an extreme case of the same thing as racing. It&#39;s completely different - one is a dangerous activity people enjoy despite the risks, the other is grievous bodily harm.<br><br>Being gay - getting married as a gay person - doesn&#39;t hurt anybody. <b>Even if you believe it&#39;s a vile sin</b>, it only &#39;hurts&#39; the gay people involved. Being in the KKK is not an &#39;extreme&#39; equivalent - it&#39;s being part of a group that actively (per Data Junkie) promotes crime and (per history) lynching black people.<br><br>One of these things hurts other people. One does not. They are not comparable even in &#39;extreme examples&#39;.<br><br>Here are some things that are actually partly analogous to &#39;not making wedding cakes for gays&#39;:<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t want to make a cake for that person with Down Syndrome (because they act weird and their face creeps me out.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t want to make a cake for that blond/e couple (because blonde hair reminds me of Nazis).&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m a traditionalist Mormon, and I don&#39;t want to make a cake for that black person (because dark skin is the mark of Cain).&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m a Baptist, and I don&#39;t want to make a cake for that Mormon (because they say they&#39;re Christian but they&#39;re nooooooot).&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t want to make a cake for that Christian-Hindu couple (because 2 Corinthians 6:14 and Deuteronomy 7:3 command that Christians shouldn&#39;t marry people of other faiths).&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t want to make a cake for this guy to give to his girlfriend (because fornication is a sin).&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t want to make a cake for that gay person (because my religion says it&#39;s sinful).&quot;<br><br>None of these customers are hurting anyone. All of them are acting in accordance with their own culture and upbringing. Four of them have absolutely no choice in being what they are. You have no moral, ethical, or in most cases legal, right to refuse them because <b>you</b> don&#39;t like them.<br><hr>
<br>I accept that you were <u>trying</u> to make an extreme example. However, what you actually <u>did</u> was directly compare &#39;being gay&#39; and &#39;being racist&#39;. Until you can accept how insulting (and frankly scary) that is, and apologise for what you actually <u>said</u> and for the lack of forethought that led to it, you&#39;re not going to get anywhere in this conversation.<br><br>You&#39;ve shown repeatedly in the past that - unlike the vast majority of people on either side of the political spectrum - you&#39;re able to learn from people you disagree with and understand when your position is groundless and wrong.

            <p>These issues are ethical as well as legal, and we can debate them until we&#39;re blue in the face and go nowhere. <br><br>I think we&#39;re confusing two issues. The rights of customers not to be discriminated against, and the rights of free association - basically, to what extent can people say &quot;I don&#39;t want to be associated with this practice&quot;? On the face of it, I would say - certainly if, say, someone walks into a bakery with a double lightning bolt on their forehead… a baker might understandably not want to serve them, but would anyway. If a customer walks into a bakery with a swastika on their forehead and says &quot;I need a cake for my organization&#39;s annual meeting,&quot; that&#39;s closer to the equivalent situation of a wedding.<br><br>The difference, of course, is that the KKK member (or White Brotherhood, or White Nationalist, or Son of Odin, or whatever) is choosing to engage in bigotry, while the gay persons did not choose to be gay. But in the latter situation, both are choosing to purchase a good or service to <i>celebrate</i> the Thing Baker Doesn&#39;t Agree With. And you know what, the law is still on the side of not discriminating based on your beliefs. For both. <br><br>For the record, if you read the history of anti-miscegenation laws and discourse, religion played a <i>massive</i> role. People honestly did cite Christianity as the reason why interracial marriage should be banned. So you really should stop making that association. People have cited their Christian beliefs to stop the abolition of slavery, interracial marriage, women&#39;s suffrage, and most recently, gay marriage. It&#39;s not a novel debate. <br><br>As to the rest… well, I&#39;ll come up with it later. But really, I do think &quot;We&#39;ll be forced to stop teaching our kids that your relationship is hateful to God&quot; isn&#39;t even founded. After all, Obama never even considered, not once, trying to outlaw the Westboro Baptist Church. Rahm Emanuel was <i>castigated</i> by the liberal sides of the press for trying to keep Chil Fil A out of Chicago. Yes, liberals would like to see LGBTQ kids not get bullied in school, and would also come down on the side of teachers not telling them they&#39;re going to hell. But… dude, no one is going to argue about what you can or can&#39;t legally say in your home, in public, or wherever. You&#39;ll just have to deal with the consequences of more and more people disagreeing with you. Which is the way it&#39;s always been. Electing republicans will not make the social pressure go away. That is the nature of a free society, dude. People express their opinions. <br><br>Again… I have a hard time squaring that as an equal concern with the politicians on the right arguing to jail, brainwash, or kill queers like me. </p>

            <p>Things heated up real quick, didn&#39;t it? Right then. Let&#39;s talk about your response to me first.<br><br>Thank you. I was admittedly misunderstanding your stance on the climate change issue. And, I am also glad to see that you are starting to read the scientific journals, or at very least, reputable summaries. I must admit to remaining rather ignorant on the specific details myself, so to attack somebody for not reading the primary sources would be hypocritical at best. <br><br>That being said. In this, specific instance, there really is no other side. The &quot;other side&quot; are scientists paid directly by energy companies to be contradictory to the accepted science to save their business. I hate using that reasoning. It dismisses potential evidence that could help see things from a new light, but the fact remains, that&#39;s just the case. I am no scientist. Heck, many of the fine details fly over my head due to current lack of understanding, so I&#39;ll defer to hS and others with greater scientific background.<br><br>Now. As for the other arguments. Starting with refusal of service and the nature of sin.<br><br>Oh boy.<br><br>You know, sometimes my being so very pro First bites me. Because, I see where you are coming from. Now, one has to make a few assumptions as to the nature of sexual deviancy in relation to same sex relationships. Namely, that it is a lifestyle choice and not genetically driven (of which there is substantial evidence for genetics, but for now, let us continue the assumption)  and thus, not fully discriminatory like denying somebody for their race would be. If one makes that assumption, then... I actually kinda have to agree. Now, again, I think it&#39;s unwise from a business standpoint to do so, rather offensive to those being denied service, and morally dubious, but at the end of the day, as far as I understand, service can be seen as a form of speech. And, as such... I kinda have to defend that right to freedom of speech and religious practice. If I want the right to tell White Pride nationalists to piss off, I have to allow the right for others to deny service based on other lifestyle choices I do support. That&#39;s the dual nature of Free Speech.<br><br>However, again, we are working off of assumptions. Namely, that gays have a choice in their feelings. Surely you would not argue for a business being able to deny service to a black man, or Chinese woman, or any other ethnicity, would you? Because they have no say in what their genetics are. To deny service because of that would be horrifically wrong. If you agree, then you must concede that gays have the same right to protection from bigotry. Because again, there is rather substantial scientific evidence for homosexually, and other sexual deviancy, to be genetically determined, not socially. Thus, in my personal view, running outside the realm of Freedom of Speech, and into the same category as racism.<br><br>But, again, as the White Pride nationalist has the right to express their opinions, so to does the flat earth truther and the homophobic. They have that right to express those opinions without legal attack. That said, so too do the people who disagree have the right to tell those people that they are wrong.</p>

That&#39;s God&#39;s job. Pray for them if you want to; ask if they&#39;re interested in talking about Jesus if you want to; but if they say no, then you back the hell off.

A racist baker would be just as obligated to sell that cake to an interracial couple as a Christian baker is to sell to a gay couple. He also does not have the right to be free from the judgement of others for his beliefs—nobody does.

            <p>In practice… hate speech is almost <i>never</i> prosecuted. KKK parades tend to go unarrested and unfined, as do people talking in public about how other races are sick/dirty/evil. The baker who refused the KKK member would probably be in more hot water for it than the jerk requesting the cake, regardless of all. We do love our first amendment in this country (so long as we&#39;re on the side of those exercising it, and it doesn&#39;t involve the flag or the pledge or the anthem or a non-anthem patriotic song or celebrities doing it or people blocking traffic or in any way inconveniencing others). </p>

            <p>First as to your immediate point about saying a thing, that&#39;s hearsay, and while hard to prove is provable.  But as to the Hate Speech, that&#39;s not exactly correct.<br><br>Hate speech was at one point prohibitable, back in the 20&#39;s.  Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., wrote explaining that it along with several other types of speech could be banned or otherwise restricted.  Then the 1960s came and between Cohen v. California and Brandenburg v. Ohio, &quot;Hate Speech&quot; gained some modicum of protection.  Brandenburg is actually uniquely on point here.  It arose as a result of a Klan rally, Ohio tried to prosecute the Klan members, but the Supreme Court held, that even the Klan&#39;s speech was protected provided there was no active incitement.  In other words, so long as the Speech does not advocate imminent lawlessness, (Clear and Present Danger) then generally you cannot restrict the speech as to content.  Time, manner, and place, are different separate issues.      </p>

            <p>This is probably the most offensive thing I have seen said about gay people since Jacer was here. Desdendelle&#39;s comments can be attributed to ignorance, but I assume you are American and therefore should know better. Especially since the KKK targets gay people too. You are literally comparing the oppressed to their oppressors and honestly the only reason I sound so calm about it is because there&#39;s a word filter on the board.</p>

            <p>(I&#39;m not even going to touch the way you present gayness as in any way comparable to thinking lynching black people is awesome. Just, not with a barge pole.)<br><br>1/ Richard Lindzen. According to Wikipedia&#39;s quoting of the <i>New York Times</i>, &quot;&#39;He agrees that the level of [carbon dioxide] is rising because of human activity and that this should warm the climate.&#39; He also believes that decreasing tropical cirrus clouds in a warmer world will allow more longwave radiation to escape the atmosphere, counteracting the warming.&quot; So his stance is that <b>people are causing climate change</b> and that <b>unverified factors will counteract this</b>.<br><br>Glancing over the abstracts of his papers (references 9 and 51 on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lindzen#Views_on_climate_change">his Wikipedia article</a>), his data seems very lacking: the first paper claims his proposed negative feedback has not been replicated by later testing, while the second (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2009GL039628/abstract">link</a>) says his data is <b>not</b> from the same radiation he wants to talk about. So no, I don&#39;t particularly trust Richard Lindzen Against The World, now that I&#39;ve read what he actually wrote.<br><br>2/ No-one is claiming we&#39;re going to turn Planet Earth into Venus 2.0; that&#39;s pure hyperbole on your part. What the entire scientific system is telling you is that Earth&#39;s ecosystems are <b>fragile</b>. Twelve thousand years ago, the Sahara Desert was a fertile landscape; natural climate change turned it into a band of yellow acros the entirety of North Africa.<br><br>And the Earth is fine with that. It doesn&#39;t care if the Sahara&#39;s dry or if there&#39;s rainforests in Antarctica. The planet - and life on it - will survive, and flourish.<br><br>But if we destroy the ecosystem around us, if we become the Sixth Mass Extinction, then that is (to slip into Christian idiom) a vile sin indeed, a violation of one of the very first commands ever given to humanity: to rule over the Earth, not to destroy it. Worse - we&#39;re part of the ecosystem we&#39;re endangering. Our food animals, our food <i>plants</i>, are part of it. If we push through this incredible shift in the climate, we stand a very good chance of wiping our civilisation, and quite possibly our species, out for good.<br><br>In the first <i>Science of Discworld</i> book (from memory), there is a perfect quote which sums up this position: &quot;We can&#39;t destroy the planet. We might just be able to save ourselves.&quot;<br><br>3/ But let&#39;s assume we don&#39;t feel the least bit of guilt about genociding entire branches off the tree of life, and that we all decide locusts are the best meat or whatever. In four pictures, here&#39;s why allowing the planet to warm - <b>regardless</b> of whether it&#39;s our fault - is still catastrophic.<br><br>1 &amp; 2: Arctic sea ice minimum in 1979 and 2015. The graph plots said minimum. Note that since sea ice floats, this is not causing an increase in sea level.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/ArcticIce.jpg"><br><br>3: Antarctica, noted for being covered in 6.4 million cubic miles of ice. Note that, as yet, this has not started receding in the same way (I blame the heat-sink effect of it being on land), but that it exists on the same planet as the North Pole.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Antarctica.png"><br><br>4: Maps of North America and Europe if all that ice melted and precipitated a ~58 meter sea level rise. I&#39;ve helpfully marked my house on the Europe one (it&#39;s underwater).<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/58Meters.png"><br><br>This is an extreme - or rather, it&#39;s an <b>endpoint</b>. As I said in point 2, it&#39;s happened before - during the Cretaceous, when most of Europe was an island chain, and North America had an ocean running through the middle of it. But even a fraction of that sea level rise - <b>when</b>, not <b>if</b>, Antarctica gets in on the mass melting act - will be an unimaginable disaster for places like, oh, the cities that America has built all along its coasts?<br><br>4/ Copernicus: actually, it used to be the <b>enforced religious</b> opinion that the Sun revolved around the Earth. Copernicus was a priest who struggled with that fact his whole life, and only published on his death bed because of it. Galileo wrote essays which convinced most scientists, and led to him being tried by the Inquisition, banned from writing or teaching his theory, and being placed under house arrest. So no, Geocentricism wasn&#39;t the majority opinion - it was a religious doctrine which scientists had not yet researched. Do you want to try and claim that climate change hasn&#39;t been looked into...? Thought not. ;)<br><br>(If you&#39;re interested in Copernicus and Galileo, by the way, I cannot recommend Dava Sobel&#39;s books <i>A More Perfect Heaven</i> and <i>Galileo&#39;s Daughter</i> highly enough. She makes it clear - particularly in the latter, which is built around letters from his Catholic nun daughter - that both men were deeply religious, and didn&#39;t have the slightest intent of breaking with the Church - they just wanted to discover the truth about the universe around them.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... since I&#39;m no scientist, but I <i>will</i> argue ethics with you:<br>Mr Valastro should not discriminate against a Klansman. In a proper democratic country, regular citizens do not take the law into their own hands; if said Klansman is a criminal he should be taken care of by the authorities, and in the meanwhile should be able to buy a cake like everybody else. (The case where the authorities <i>don&#39;t</i> address the Klansman&#39;s crimes is a different kettle of fish.)<br>In general: there&#39;s no such thing as a right to not be associated with somebody, and there is a right to not be discriminated against, <i>especially</i> when it comes to things you don&#39;t choose like sexual orientation (if you think you can choose sexual orientation: do you honestly think you could turn bisexual if you&#39;d want to?). <br>A religion (any religion) is like a dick: it&#39;s cool that you have one, but you shouldn&#39;t be waving it around in the street and you definitely shouldn&#39;t be shoving it down people&#39;s throats without their permission, especially children.</p>

You cannot discriminate against someone because of what&#39;s basically their feelings — you can only prosecute hate groups when they break the law. Until a Klansman breaks the law, he&#39;s a citizen like you and should be afforded the same rights not to be discriminated against or denied service. There&#39;s little difference between denying a Klansman service and denying a &quot;kill all men&quot; feminist service.</p>

            <p>The petition response has a bit that says,<br>&quot;Indeed, <b>although simply believing in white supremacy or belonging to a white supremacist group—while abhorrent—is not a crime,</b> the federal government has successfully charged white supremacists over the years using many federal statutes, including those prohibiting civil rights violations and solicitation to commit crimes of violence.&quot; (Emphasis mine.)<br>The FBI link states, <br>&quot;The Bureau has been investigating <b>the criminal activities</b> of white supremacy extremists like Ku Klux Klan members since as early as 1918.&quot; (Again, emphasis mine.)<br>So basically being a member of the KKK is perfectly legal if morally repugnant, according to the US Federal government. The government of a free, democratic state has no business being a) Thought Police or b) Morality Police. Its business is prosecuting lawbreakers, which is what both quotes say the government has been doing.<br>To answer your other question: <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=303120;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">as EAUO noted</a>, it&#39;s illegal for a business to decide not to serve a costumer. If you&#39;re a private person, sure, you can say that KKK isn&#39;t welcome in your house or similar things, but you&#39;re forbidden from doing that as a business.<br>I don&#39;t particularly like the KKK (it&#39;s hard to like people who hate me because I belong to a certain ethnoreligious group), but KKK membership does not suddenly make its members not citizens; as citizens they are afforded certain rights. It&#39;s that simple. Going &quot;only people I agree with deserve civil rights&quot; is immoral, and it doesn&#39;t matter whether your in-group is liberals, Christians, LGBT people or Klansmen.</p>

            <p>In both cases it can be boiled down to &quot;I find this person morally repugnant so I&#39;ll deny them service&quot;. In both cases it&#39;s illegal and (in my opinion) immoral. Unless you hold the opinion that says &quot;KKK membership makes someone lose their citizenship&quot; (false) or &quot;KKK members don&#39;t deserve their lawful rights because they&#39;re racist bastards&quot; (which misses the whole point of &quot;civil right&quot; — you know, stuff people shouldn&#39;t take away from you even if they don&#39;t like your opinions, the colour of your skin or whatever?) your argument is faulty.<br><br>Anyway, &quot;we&#39;re not addressing what SoH said&quot; is moving the goalposts. My argument with you isn&#39;t about what SoH said, it&#39;s about whether civil rights should be universal and apply to all citizens equally or not.</p>

            <p>a) It is, in fact, the essence.<br>In one scenario, someone who&#39;s a victim of the KKK&#39;s beliefs and actions denies service to a member of the KKK.  In the other scenario, someone denies service to someone because of their &quot;lifestyle&quot;, which is not, in fact, something they have control over.  It&#39;s a radically different scenario.<br><br>b) I only started this because I was under the impression you lacked the cultural background to understand how <i>destructive</i> the KKK is.

            <p>a) You cannot be a victim of beliefs — thoughts can&#39;t come out of someone&#39;s head and bite you; you can only be a victim of deeds. A homophobe is entitled to his homophobia — as morally repugnant as it is — because everybody is entitled to their beliefs and opinions. A homophobe is not entitled to act on his homophobia, because that would hurt people.<br>The essence here is &quot;people are entitled to think and feel whatever, and discriminating against them solely on the basis of that is bad&quot;, not &quot;the KKK are evil&quot;. <br>Consider the following scenario: A is a gay baker. B is a Klansman. B beat the living daylights out of A and got an appropriate sentence (I have no idea what&#39;s the sentence for aggravated assault over there in the States). After serving his prison term, B goes to to A&#39;s bakery and orders a cake.<br>No matter what A&#39;s feelings on the matter are, they are <i>obliged</i> to sell B the cake. Not selling it is a) discriminatory and b) taking the law into their own hands (which, frankly, you <i>really</i> shouldn&#39;t argue for if you think you&#39;re a victim — usually the perps are crueller than the victims and have less problems with being nasty).<br><br>b) If you think what Nesh and Scape and the rest said isn&#39;t serious enough, go ahead and address SoH directly. Nobody here is obliged to fight your battles for you and nobody&#39;s preventing you from talking to SoH and arguing your case. <br><br>Anyway: while I find what SoH argues for w.r.t. the wedding cakes for Gay people pretty immoral — and I&#39;ve said as much, I think — I find your stance, which seems to be &quot;only people I approve of deserve civil rights&quot;, to be hypocritical and immoral. I think that before you criticise anybody out of a civil-rights position, you should ask yourself whether you really agree with <i>all</i> of its implications, because right now that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.</p>

            <p>I think you seem to be misunderstanding who the KKK are, as well as certain legal processes in the states.<br><br>FIRSTLY<br>&quot;We reserve the right to refuse service for any reason&quot; is seen in a lot of restaurants and is true, but also has the technicality that it is still illegal to discriminate based on sex, orientation, or, religion.<br><br>Therefore, it is legal for anyone to refuse to sell the cake to a member of the KKK. The discrimination only applies to those three categories from a legal perspective (However, many courts do not allow refusal of service based on arbitrary conditions, such as for example, a lazy eye).<br><br>This is very important, because the united states are in fact, NOT a democracy. The founding fathers saw the inherent flaws in purely democratic systems and took steps to ensure the united states would be a representative republic instead. One of these flaws is what is known as the &quot;Tyranny of Democracy&quot;. That is to say; in a purely democratic system, the majority can rule over the minorities with impunity, as a tyrant dictator would. To avoid this, there are many laws in place specifically dedicated to preventing discrimination against minorities.<br><br><br>SECONDLY<br>KKK=/=Racist southerners. <br>KKK = extremist group outlawed by congress back in 1871. That kind of unity in the group hasn&#39;t existed for a very long time, but they are still a legally recognized hate group. To be in the KKK, is to have participated in the action, there&#39;s not a grey area, where you&#39;re a KKK member, but haven&#39;t done anything bad yet, you become a KKK member when you do the bad thing.<br><br>Refusing to offer service to someone for being gay, and refusing to offer service to someone for being a member of the KKK are entirely different. One of the two had no choice in who they are. The other actively participates in hate crimes.<br>One is illegal because it&#39;s discrimination based on orientation. The other is not, because its not.</p>

In a jungle you could take a gun and shoot those Klansmen and nobody would give a leaky sack of rat droppings about that — but in a jungle those Klansmen would be able to shoot you  with impunity, too.<br>In a democratic state you assume someone is innocent till proven otherwise, and the government <i>mustn&#39;t</i> take away anybody&#39;s rights until they&#39;ve committed a crime. You as a private citizen are forbidden from using force against another citizen (barring some special circumstances). Nobody&#39;s telling you to respect the KKK, or to like them, but you cannot demand that the government will stand by when someone is being denied their right simply because you find them morally repugnant. Choosing &quot;law of the jungle for my enemies and civil rights for me and mine&quot; is both hypocritical and immoral (the latter because it pisses on the universal part of morality): either all citizens get civil rights, or none of them do.</p>

The right-wing fundamentalists who rage against trans people do so because they feel that their gods tell them to. We on the trans side are fighting because people are <i>literally trying to destroy us</i>. The tools in question vary: legislation, economics, or violence, but the end goal is the same.<br><br>So, no, I reject your assumption that all sides are somehow equal in this. There is not a moral equal footing here. Nor is this a safe ideological debate for one of the involved parties. The Trans Day of Remembrance is coming up this weekend, where we mourn our dead. There are eighty-seven names on the list this year, and that&#39;s just counting people who we know were trans and we know were murdered.<br><br>That&#39;s what, a good-sized car bomb&#39;s worth?<br><br>So. Please stop trying to compare a violent hate group to people who are frequent victims of hate crimes. That is not terribly cool.<br><br>In case you haven&#39;t read Data Junkie&#39;s response, the kkk doesn&#39;t much care about civil rights. They exist to apply the law of the jungle to whoever they wish; in fact, membership requires stepping over legal bounds and committing hate crimes.<br><br>I reject your allegations of hypocrisy. I believe in simple things like &quot;don&#39;t commit violent crime&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t support ideologies of hatred.&quot; Perhaps I&#39;m ethically gerrymandering to protect my cause, but those seem to both censure the hypothetical kkk member and not say very much about queer people.<br><br>Because, once again, comparing people with a minority identity to a literal violent hate group is ridiculous.<br><br>If you want a better comparison, I, a hypothetical queer business owner, would not refuse to bake a cake / build a website / whatever for a christian wedding, even if it were, say, a baptist one. Even that is an ideology they have chosen to hold so it&#39;s not a fair comparison, but my dislike of what they believe isn&#39;t reason to deny them service.<br><br>However, I reserve the right to refuse service to all who hold an ideology of hatred. If there were a queer group that advocated and performed, say, church burnings, I would refuse then service too.<br><br>(And seriously, the usa is pretty messed up.)</p>

            <p>First of all, the criminal thing. One of the ways a state (any state, not necessarily democratic) is different from a jungle is that a certain group of people has a (legitimate) monopoly on violence. Usually, the victim isn&#39;t in this group.<br>(There are, of course, exceptions, but they vary by place — for example, I know that self-defence is an admissible defence in an Israeli court, but not what flies in different states in the USA.)<br>So even if the KKK are criminals (not debating that, I don&#39;t have data) it&#39;s not your place to punish them or discriminate against them — <i>assuming</i> the existence of states (particularly, democratic ones) is something you want. Of course, that&#39;s where the ...ed-up-ness comes in: you&#39;re stuck between suffering for ideals or giving them up (at least partially).<br><br>Second, I&#39;m not comparing the KKK to trans people, except in one important quality: KKK are people. If you&#39;re a believer in human rights, you cannot <i>not</i> give them the selfsame rights, no matter how horrible they are.<br><br>Third, I have it easy over here because I don&#39;t think human beings deserve something for being human. (Side note: &quot;right&quot; is a poorly-defined concept and &quot;human rights&quot; is even worse in that regard.)<br>I think that &quot;justice&quot; is an agreement between people; so it&#39;s very easy for me to say that since the KKK are going to treat me badly because I&#39;m Jewish, I&#39;m under no obligation to treat them well. Of course, if I&#39;d go and look for Klansmen to beat up (as opposed to, IDK, self defence or coming to the defence of a victim) I don&#39;t have a lot of moral high ground, in my opinion.<br><br>Fourth: being a minority in and of itself doesn&#39;t make you automatically better. Being a decent human being is what makes you better than the KKK. <br><br>Fifth: &quot;I&#39;m more oppressed than you&quot; doesn&#39;t fly with me. Pity isn&#39;t one of my strong points.</p>

            <p>...because this thread is attracting flies.<br><br>I don&#39;t disagree with you. I&#39;m a soft Kantian, I agree that people are equal and rights are rights, regardless of how odious I find them personally.<br><br>That said, I was trying to A, explain where and how I draw the line that says that a business refusing to endorse a gay wedding (and conveniently oppressing my lgbt in-group) is wrong, but a business refusing to endorse an anniversary celebration for the kkk is right.

I&#39;ve met far too many people who are minorities on one axis and yet totally terrible towards minorities on other axes to believe that. I&#39;m still trying to un-learn my own terribleness on some of those, which has been a long battle. (Yaaaaay white southern baptist upbringing.)</p>

            <p>This is politics. In fact, not only is this politics, it&#39;s politics of the explosive sort.<br>I&#39;m going to go into points-mode because it&#39;s getting confusing, so here goes:<br>1) I still don&#39;t see the distinction between &quot;refusing to sell a gay couple a cake&quot;, &quot;refusing to sell a cake to the WBC&quot;, &quot;refusing to sell a cake to Jews&quot; and &quot;refusing to sell a cake to Klansmen&quot;. The distinction flies in the face of the &quot;universality&quot; bit of ethics, I think; how is not selling a cake to the KKK any different <i>in essence</i> than not selling it to the WBC, or to a Jew?<br>2) Comparing LGBT people and the KKK isn&#39;t wrong. It&#39;s a logical operation. <i>Equating</i> LGBT people and the KKK is a morally-repugnant action. I was doing the former.<br>...<br>That wasn&#39;t as many points as I&#39;ve expected. Oh well.</p>

            <p>So - at least from my point of view, there&#39;s something of a spectrum between &quot;doing business with a person&quot; and &quot;supporting a person&#39;s belief system&quot;. To try to illustrate that spectrum, here&#39;s some examples, revolving around a fictitious coffee shop:<br><br>1: Selling a customer a cup of coffee.<br><br>2: Selling a group of customers coffee, which they then drink in the shop while talking about their politics.<br><br>2: Selling a group of customers coffee, which they then drink in the shop while talking <i>loudly</i> about their belief system.<br><br>3: Renting out the shop for an open-to-the-public political event.<br><br>4: Doing nothing while a customer stands up and lectures the shop at large about their ideology. (without forewarning)<br><br>5: Letting a customer leave a stack of pamphlets about their ideology in the shop.<br><br>6: Helping a customer plan (and perform) a lecture to the shop about their ideology.<br><br>Regardless of the ideology in question, I hope you can see the progression there. Denying someone the first example is pretty clearly discriminatory. Denying someone the last example is entirely legit - the right to free speech is a thing, but it&#39;s very specifically not the right to a venue or an audience.<br><br>So, when it comes to cake-baking, there&#39;s a lot of possible scenarios that fall on various parts of the board. A simple &quot;happy birthday&quot; cake is probably down towards example 1, really not something to be denied to anyone. On the other hand, decorating a cake with burning crosses and white hoods and &quot;happy birthday to the KKK!&quot; is, in my mind, very much closer to examples 5 and 6- you aren&#39;t just providing a service, at that point, you&#39;re using your skills and resources in a way that&#39;s inescapably glorifying an ideology of violence.<br><br>And that&#39;s where I&#39;m very much okay with picking and choosing what ideologies should and shouldn&#39;t be supported. And comfortable applying value judgements to the ideologies in question - &quot;don&#39;t hurt people&quot;, a quite universal rule, makes the comparable guideline of &quot;I won&#39;t support ideologies that advocate hurting people&quot; and value judgement of &quot;ideologies that advocate hurting people are bad&quot; pretty straightforward, in my mind.<br><br>The comparable guideline of &quot;I won&#39;t support an expression of queerness&quot; is a thing - but if you chase that one backwards towards a universal rule, it doesn&#39;t really go anywhere - the underlying rule seems to be &quot;queer people are gross.&quot;</p>

            <p>That the imaginary &quot;happy birthday to the KKK!&quot; cake is less like number 5 and more like (the first) number 2. The only way this particular cake can end up as a 5 is if either a) the costumer proceeds to advertise the fact that they bought this cake from you on top of every billboard in town or b) some nosy lowlife hires a private investigator in order to find dirt on you. Otherwise, it&#39;s just another cake.</p>

            <p>It comes down to the obsession with &quot;individual freedoms&quot; that permeates through the U.S. Essentially, we have this doctrine that runs through all our rhetoric and media and narratives, which is that... well, it&#39;s complicated.

            <p>There are places where we&#39;re basically just people - my good state of Washington, for one, has about the same protections add the United Kingdom. That doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re safe in practice, either here or there. A trans person was assaulted during Pride week on capital hill, the queerest neighborhood in Seattle.<br><br>But it gets worse. There are states where we don&#39;t have protections. There are nations that require us to spend years living as ourselves before getting access to hrt or updating ids, which ends up being nothing more useful than a government-sponsored hazing. There are states that won&#39;t update gender markers on ids until after expensive and major surgeries; this puts a hard class boundary on being able to not be outed as trans every time you show an id. Mandatory sterilization is still a thing in a lot of Europe, too, if you like a side order of eugenics with your prejudice.<br><br>And the US and Europe are still some of the best places in the world to be trans.<br><br>Welcome to the dystopia.</p>

The fact that there is any situation at any time that people have to be given a reason to be fired, you can thank the unions fighting those battles. <br><br>There are many on the right that think we restrict the employers right to terminate too much. You know those pesky laws and regulations they keep wanting to repeal? Those workers rights laws are on that list. It ain&#39;t just the environment they want to screw over.

            <p>A) To be a Klansman is to be a criminal, because you are not officially a member until you commit criminal acts while wearing the hood and robe. I could say &quot;just trust me&quot; but let me make this clear: I know, because I have at least four cousins who are Klansmen. Two of whom enjoyed telling me how they joined. Both are cops.<br>B) I was not speaking lightly when I said they are a very real threat for me. I am a non-straight trans person living in Georgia, and I am suicidally cocky in the face of bigotry.<br>C) If you actually think non-FBI law enforcement take action against them, you&#39;d be wrong.

            <p>As far as the right to not associate with someone, there has been a line of US Supreme Court Cases that suggest there is a right to associate, and as such there is an implied negative right to not associate.  Now, the line of cases went from allowing certain organizations to not associate with certain groups (namely African-Americans) to stating that they are required to do so.  But the difference was because they were essentially for profit organizations, but the idea that a private individual can choose to or not to associate with another person still exists.  The government cannot force me as a private individual to be friends with another individual.  The difference occurs with an organization it is pretty well established that organizations cannot refuse to associate with people.  With perhaps a few exceptions.  So I disagree only to the extent that you are referring private individuals, not businessmen.  For example in the case of the Baker, the Baker as a baker cannot refuse service to to an individual, but once the Baker leaves the Bakery the Baker is perfectly entitled to even refuse to look at a particular person.  Love it or hate it, that&#39;s basically the law.  Now that is an oversimplification, but that is the gist of it. </p>

            <p>Please take a closer look at what I said in response to Seafarer. <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=303036;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board"><i>Both</i></a> <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=303067;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">times</a>, I conceded that climate change is a real thing. I nowhere said that it was a hoax.<br><br>And one has to have less than one functioning brain cell to deny that rising sea levels are currently a threat to coastal communities and low-lying island nations—meaning that those affected must receive appropriate aid. So obviously, it would be small comfort to say from an ivory tower, &quot;The current warming is part of a greater cycle,&quot; even if the argument is true. (Note that I am <i>not</i> trying to make this argument here.)<br><br>As I said before, my point of disagreement is not with the <i>existence</i> of climate change, but with the narrative that &quot;if something isn&#39;t done, WE&#39;RE GOING TO COOK OURSELVES TO DEATH!!1!!!11!&quot;  <br><br>As I conceded to Seafarer, I am clearly ignorant of the literature on <i>both</i> sides, and given your first-hand experience about it, I have all the more reason to actually start reading sooner rather than later.<br><br>But what I <i>do</i> know is <i>that</i> there is literature on both sides. And that was all I wanted to say in the first place: if there is an argument on the other side, then deal with the argument; do not resort to demonizing the other side as a shortcut to reasoned discussion.</p>

            <p><i>Democratic positions being touted by the media and academia as the only reasonable opinion.</i><br><br>Did it occur to you that maybe you have this the wrong way around? That it&#39;s more likely that academic results are picked up by the media and become Democratic positions because of their rigour, and that conservatives simply refuse to believe them (often due to established interests)? Shall I take climate change as an example? The planet is warming rapidly - there&#39;s overwhelming evidence - yet Trump and his ilk want to end climate deals and bring back the coal industry. Thus the Democratic position is treated as the only reasonable opinion because it is backed up by facts, and the opposing position works directly counter to those facts.<br><br>Of course, not all liberal positions are so clear-cut, and yes, a lot of Democrat supporters pretend that some of their positions are the only right ones when they aren&#39;t.<br><br><br><i>Mexicans just traipsing across the border are flouting those laws</i><br><br>&quot;Traipsing across the border&quot;? Most illegal immigrants actually enter the USA by plane, with visas. You know that, right? You were just being metaphorical? I agree, though, that illegal immigration is a problem.<br><br>The solution to this problem, though, isn&#39;t nearly so simple as building a wall. It would probably require investment in policing - which, incidentally, could be paid for if the rich got a higher tax rate.<br><br>But you know what would be really good? If the USA joined civilised countries in having a head of government elected by popular vote rather than the archaic system it has now. That way, the will of the majority of voters will always be carried out. (Fun fact: no Republican has been elected (as opposed to re-elected) by the popular vote since George H W Bush.)<br><br>And I&#39;m really sorry if I seem angry. I am - Donald Trump being elected did that to me - but I am really keen to see a right wing that isn&#39;t populated near-entirely by denial and reactionary politics. If you can be that rational right-winger, I&#39;ll do my best to stay civil.</p>

Even since childhood, I saw the ridiculousness of the Electoral College. The function for which it was designed (the people would choose worthy electors, who would use their independent judgment to choose a President) has never, if ever, come to pass, and most of the arguments for keeping it are BS. However, it doesn&#39;t take a Political Science major to see that there&#39;s no way that Congress will make any headway towards eliminating the Electoral College. <br><br>Fortunately, there&#39;s hope. A movement called <a href="http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/">National Popular Vote (NPV) is halfway to its goal of eliminating the Electoral College by basically exploiting a loophole, so to speak, in the Constitution. NPV seeks to have enough states pass legislation that would award their electors to the winner of the popular vote. Currently, 11 states, controlling 165 electoral votes total, are on board with this proposal. (It takes 270 to elect a President).<br><br><br>However, this is where I stop applauding our similarities. I do not believe that the example you give, climate change, is as clear-cut as you believe. It <i>is</i> incontrovertible that the climate has been warming over the past 200 years (by a total of about one degree Celsius, if I am not misled). However, it is <i>not</i> as clear-cut that DISASTER IS ON THE HORIZON!

First, &quot;<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ominous-story-of-syria-climate-refugees/">The Ominous Story of Syria&#39;s Climate Refugees</a>,&quot; which discusses climate change as one of several causes of the Syrian migration.<br><br>Second, &quot;<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/governments-should-plan-for-climate-change-migrants/">Governments Should Plan for Climate Change Migrants</a>.&quot; I note that &quot;22 million people were displaced by extreme events in 2013, led by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines&quot; as opposed to &quot;In the early 1970s, the total number of people displaced [by extreme events] was only about 10 million.&quot;<br><br>Third, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-refugees-bangladesh/">this</a> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-bangladesh2/">series</a> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cities-with-climate-migrants/">about</a> Bangladesh and climate migration.<br><br>TL;DR: Rising sea levels, storms, floods, and drought caused or exacerbated by climate change are forcing people to flee their homes and flock to areas that are already overpopulated. This is happening <i>now</i>, not 50 years from now. If sad polar bears don&#39;t move you-and-others-like-you to support decisive action against climate change, perhaps the plight of millions of human beings will?<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. I think the root of many of our problems is overpopulation. I don&#39;t believe in forcing people to limit their reproduction by means of something tyrannical like the One-Child Policy, but I do believe in making birth control and sex education freely, broadly, publicly available so we can all make smarter choices about how many humans we add to the <s>viral load</s> population. By extension, I also believe in supporting women&#39;s rights and education in particular. When women are educated and empowered to take control of their bodies, their entire community benefits. I don&#39;t have a link to back up that statement, but can I slide by with an It Is Known this time?</p>

            <p>It is not as if I pulled some random YouTube video out of my rear, so I believe that it is disingenuous to say that I am &quot;using YouTube as a source&quot;; I am simply citing to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lindzen">actual published scientist</a> who also happened to have posted a digestible-length video on YouTube. If I was posting to some random nutjob, <i>then</i> you&#39;d be right to question the validity of my views. <br><br>Thanks for at least having the respect to point to other scientists as well.<br><br>But I believe that you completely missed the point I was trying to make. The climate is changing: on that we agree. Many scientists are saying the same thing: one would have to be blind to deny that. However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum">numbers alone do not prove truth</a>.<br><br>The difference between someone with a legitimate minority position and a conspiracy theorist is that the conspiracy theorist can empirically be proven wrong; he just doesn&#39;t want to see that he&#39;s wrong.

            <p>Let me make something absolutely clear, son. Trump is a vile disgrace, and I would argue that his VP, while outwardly sane, is worse; Pence&#39;s record as Governor of Indiana implies he has lifelong beliefs in the kind of deranged rhetoric Trump picked up for political expediency over the course of this <s>divine punishment for mankind&#39;s hubris</s> election campaign. They are both people who have espoused the most repugnant ideologies possible.<br><br>Republicans voted for that.<br><br>Couch it in whatever language you want, that maybe they weren&#39;t all bigots, that some, you assume, are good people. The fact remains that they had a choice between two people (well, two people and piddling your vote up the wall), one of whom was a centrist and one of whom was a fascist, and they picked the fascist. Regardless of the reasons, they looked at the vicious, hatemongering bigot and, clothespegs on their noses or not, put a cross against his name. A cross which some of his more vocal supporters now consider themselves free to set on fire on a black family&#39;s lawn.<br><br>There&#39;s a rule of thumb when it comes to victories, and it&#39;s this: look at who&#39;s celebrating. We&#39;ll exclude Donald from this, as it wouldn&#39;t be fair, but let&#39;s have a looksie at one of the people leading the parades. You may have heard of David Duke and his fellow pointy ghosts. He&#39;s all but dancing in the streets. Trump&#39;s campaign put the bubbling cesspool of white nationalism back in the mainstream and they&#39;re not going away any time soon.<br><br>Nigel Farage is celebrating; indeed, in a jubilant interview on Spanish radio he was joking about Trump sexually assaulting Theresa May (Britain&#39;s current Prime Minister, if you don&#39;t know) when first they meet. Nigel Farage is an isolationist garbage-spewer and his party, UKIP, is the socially acceptable face of the far-right in Britain. They are racists to a man. They were Brexit&#39;s chief cheerleaders and, to sell it to the populace, produced a poster of queueing brown people (the white faces in the original picture were, and I swear I&#39;m not making this up, Photoshopped out) with the enormous caption &quot;<b><font color="#FFOOOO">BREAKING POINT</font></b>&quot; accompanying it, echoing a piece of Nazi propaganda from the Thirties.<br><br>And finally, Trump&#39;s biggest fans are celebrating. And they&#39;re celebrating like this:-<br><br><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%5C*TcT8tCMwiekhU6hhduZ4qQ.jpeg"><br><br>And like this:-<br><br><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cw2ImZaW8AMnXK4.jpg"><br><br>And like this (found attached to someone&#39;s car in North Carolina):-<br><br><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cw3jNF-WIAEqCcf.jpg"><br><br>And like this:-<br><br><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cw6NugeXAAE7FVE.jpg"><br><br>Do you understand now why your argument comes across as specious apologism for a truly indefensible man? Or are you okay with that, because you think you won&#39;t be affected by the madness about to befall the United States?<br><br>Because let me tell you something: I&#39;m a trans woman. I&#39;m three thousand miles away. And <i>I&#39;m</i> terrified. Why the poxy hell aren&#39;t you?<br><br>We both know the answer. It&#39;s just not one you like.</p>

And in this case, I do not even need to answer for myself: the third paragraph in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=302977;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Badger421&#39;s post elsewhere in this thread</a> is answer enough.<br><br>I know that you are afraid, and I will not deny that you have every right to be.

But if one is Black, so is the other, no variation.<br><br>So as a matter of science, it is incorrect to state that homosexuality is just as hardwired as race.<br><br>Feel free to correct me if my knowledge is out of date.<br><br><br>Furthermore, as a matter of morality, to say &quot;homosexuality is a sin&quot; is not the same as saying &quot;being Black is a sin.&quot; One is taught in the Bible, the other is expressly contradicted by it.<br><br>Both <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+18.22&amp;version=NIV">Old</a> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20%3A13&amp;version=NIV">Testament</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A26-27&amp;version=NIV">New</a> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=I+Corinthians+6%3A9-11&amp;version=NIV">Testament</a> roundly call homosexuality a sin.<br><br>However, neither Testament calls it a sin to be born of one race rather than another. To get to the more thorny issue first: yes, in the Old Testament, God did tell Israel to wage war against certain nations. However, it was made clear that the rationale for doing so <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+18%3A9-13&amp;version=NIV">was the sinful <i>deeds</i> of those nations</a>, not because the target nations were somehow inferior people-groups. Furthermore, under the Mosaic Law, it was expressly <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+12%3A49&amp;version=NIV">stipulated</a> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+24%3A22&amp;version=NIV">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+15.15&amp;version=NIV">times</a> that Israelite and foreigner were to be treated equally under the law.<br><br>And, of course, the New Testament is even more explicit. I&#39;ll just quote: &quot;[God] hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth&quot; (Acts 17.26)<br><br>&quot;There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.&quot; (Galatians 3:28)<br><br>&quot;Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: <i>Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free</i>: but Christ is all, and in all.&quot; (Colossians 3:9-11) (emphasis added)<br><br>So there&#39;s no way around it: sexual orientation and race are not equivalent scientifically or Biblically.<br><br><br>(And before anyone tries to use the fact that I&#39;ve cited to Leviticus 20:13 in an attempt to paint me as condoning violence against homosexuals, let me cut you off at the pass: you&#39;re amiss. The New Testament nowhere gives Christians the right to execute the death-penalties of the Old Testament. On the very contrary, the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+9%3A51-56&amp;version=NIV">examples</a> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+26%3A50-54&amp;version=NIV">from</a> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+23:34&amp;version=NIV">Jesus&#39; life</a> show that we are <i>not</i> to seek the deaths of those who disagree with the Gospel.)<br><br>(And if anyone tries to discredit my NT quotes on homosexuality because they came from Paul and not Jesus, I&#39;ve already addressed the argument of &quot;Jesus said nothing about homosexuality&quot; in an e-mail discussion with a Boarder a few years ago. I&#39;ll paste the bulk of that here:<br><br><i>Now we know that [Jesus] did not have a thing to say </i>directly<i> about homosexuality. He didn&#39;t need to; he preached to Jews! (Paul, however, preached to Gentiles, and you should know that the Greeks and Romans did practice homosexuality, so of course </i>he<i> would address it though Jesus did not.) However, Jesus&#39; own words leave no doubt on what his view of the matter would be.<br><br>In Matthew 19, we have Jesus being presented with a question from the Pharisees: &quot;The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?&quot; (verse 3) ... There were two schools of thought in Jesus&#39; day on the matter. One, the school of Shammai, said that a man could divorce his wife only if the wife was sexually immoral (e.g., if she was cheating on her husband). The other school, that of Hillel, said that a man could divorce his wife for any reason. To make a long story short, what did Jesus say? He said that marriage is permanent, to be sundered only in the case of sexual immorality. But what&#39;s important for our purposes is Jesus’ justification: &quot;Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.&quot; (Matthew 19:4-6) (What a beautiful saying, and again bringing up the complementary nature of man and woman! Far from being a thing that could be tossed aside at whim, a wife is for life!)<br><br>Note that Jesus&#39; justification is rooted in </i>Creation<i>: &quot;</i>He which made them ... male and female ...<i> said, For this cause shall a man ... cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh.&quot;<br><br>That same reasoning undergirds the condemnation of homosexuality....</i>)</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll get to the point I really want to make in a minute, but first, this: Jesus isn&#39;t talking about homosexuality. He&#39;s talking about marriage. He&#39;s not trying to make any point about the genders of the people involved, he&#39;s using the terms set forth by the opposition. He is making a point about the permanency of marriage. Using it out of the original context strikes me as a bit of a reach.<br><br>Now, for the important part. I&#39;ve got just one question for you: Why? Why would God declare homosexuality wrong? I&#39;ve yet to get a satisfactory answer to this question. I&#39;ve heard plenty of people tell me homosexuality is wrong because God said so, but I haven&#39;t yet heard a good reason for why He would say so. However, I don&#39;t believe He just declares things wrong because it&#39;s entertaining. He always has a reason for the things He does, so please, educate me! I&#39;m honestly willing to hear it, because it&#39;s a question that&#39;s been weighing on my mind for a long time, and I&#39;d love to finally get an answer.</p>

            <p>One more way we can prove our devotion to him. See, God likes to set tests for his people. The very first one was the Tree in the Garden of Eden. There was no bloody reason for that tree to exist <i>except</i> for God to say &quot;Oh, and don&#39;t touch that one, because I said so.&quot;<br><br>My Jehovah&#39;s Witness friends explained it to me in terms of a father telling his kid not to touch the stovetop, because it&#39;s hot and no loving father wants his kid to get burned. However, I can&#39;t buy it, because the oven has an actual reason to exist in the house. One arbitrary tree that only exists <i>not</i> to be touched? Not so much. It&#39;s just a test, and by its very existence, humanity was set up for the possibility of failure.<br><br>Now, I <i>do</i> get the argument that only by giving us chances to disobey God are we given the ability to exercise free will. If God created us with absolutely no way to ever do anything he didn&#39;t intend for us, we&#39;d be no more than automatons, doing what we were programmed to do.<br><br>That said, I <i>don&#39;t</i> get why God still gets to punish us for doing that free will thing we were set up to do. The system seems pretty well rigged against us, really.<br><br>At least the Witnesses don&#39;t believe in eternal damnation. By them, everybody gets a chance to repent and get back into the Kingdom after Armageddon. I still don&#39;t buy into it, but I can at least sometimes appreciate why someone might want to.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>See, the whole &#39;face trials, pull through, die, go to heaven&#39; thing was the plan from the beginning. But it had to be a <i>choice</i>.

            <p>Why do many denominations see contraceptives as a sin? Or abortions? It&#39;s because sex is an activity done for the purpose of having children. To raise many children is to do the Lord&#39;s work. You have to keep in mind, this was a budding religion, rising from under extreme oppression, adopting the struggles of the Jews before them and of a new cult causing the local power trouble. To spread their influence and gain power, they need followers, and the easiest way of doing that is to out-breed the competition. It is a concept used throughout history by many rising cultures. So, now you can see the problem. Homosexuals can&#39;t really have any children. Ergo, it&#39;s a sin.<br><br>Now, why have you not heard that answer before? Because, if I remember right, and please correct me SoH if I&#39;m wrong, the Bible never states that directly. The answer I gave was cultural, historical, but not strictly theological. That, and we Americans are still very shy about the subject of sex. To even discuss such things in proper context with others is inappropriate. Far more appropriate to say, &quot;because God said it was so,&quot; than it is to swallow their fear and mention sex itself directly.</p>

            <p>Oh, and as for the infertile thing, here is how I imagine the argument would go.<br><br>The gift of Life is given unto us by God, as blessing and as means to further His plan. However, there are some whom are not meant to bear child in His plan, but to do His work in other ways. To try and to fail to raise child is not unholy, for to fail is God&#39;s plan for those who cannot.

            <p>You just had to go there.<br><br>I don&#39;t actually care what your book says. Regardless of what your book says, <i>homosexuality is as innate as race</i>. When I said &quot;largely&quot;, I meant that it is partially developmental. A brief glance at the Wikipedia page (yeah, yeah, shitty source, I don&#39;t care right now) shows no indication that social factors play any significant role.

What the bible says has no bearing on the analogy: &quot;being gay is a sin&quot; is functionally identical to &quot;being black is a sin&quot;; it just changes who you&#39;re being bigoted towards.<br><br>(I&#39;ll note that your more recent source suggests epigenetic changes as a solution to the twin dilemma - which is just as immutable as birth genome (that is, not totally, but not possible for humans to mess with).)<br><br>(And you know what?

Had you framed your argument as a purely scientific one (e.g., &quot;Sexual orientation is as immutable as race&quot;), or even as a <i>philosophical</i> one (e.g., &quot;I think it is just as bigoted to be homophobic as it is to be racist), I might not have resorted to the Bible.

In both cases, we are talking about a service being given to help celebrate an event.<br><br>Unless you&#39;re implying that I am equating homosexuality and racism, which <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=303152;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">I am not.</a><br><br><br>Now to return to what I said, I doubt that I can make it any clearer that those racists whose vandalism you&#39;ve posted do not represent me. And I believe that it has been made <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=302971;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">just</a> as <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=302977;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">clear</a> that they do not represent everyone who voted for Trump: there were reasons other than homophobia, xenophobia, or misogyny why people voted for him. And we&#39;d be more than willing to denounce those evils done in his name.<br><br>So for you to basically put words in my mouth and lump me with said racists <i>is</i> an insult. How else am I to interpret your own words:<br><i>&quot;Do you understand now why your argument comes across as specious apologism for a truly indefensible man? … I&#39;m a trans woman. I&#39;m three thousand miles away. And </i>I&#39;m<i> terrified. Why the poxy hell aren&#39;t you? We both know the answer. It&#39;s just not one you like.&quot;</i><br><br>One can disagree without being disagreeable, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=297566">as even you yourself admitted before</a>. So no, I do not think that I am amiss in asking for an apology. However, if you still think that none is warranted, I will not continue to push for one.<br></p>

We want to kick you out and take away your money, accusing you of benefits fraud - while at the same time looking down on you for <i>not</i> being sneaky enough to exploit the system properly.<br><br>The reason for that, I guess, is that our non-white migrants have historically been professionals (rather than, y&#39;know, slaves and people crossing an immediate land border, per America), while our <i>poor</i> migrants are largely from Eastern Europe.

WHAT other things, I&#39;m not sure. Avoiding war with Russia, maybe, I saw someone mention that?

            <p>People complain about the antiquated Electoral College.  Maybe it is, maybe not.  This is not an argument for the College.  But the Electoral College was designed by the Framers of the US Constitution with the idea in mind that direct democracy cannot be trusted.  When a State&#39;s Electoral Votes go to a candidate, all that means is that that candidate is expected to get those Electoral Votes.  But I think only about half of the US requires their Electoral Votes actually go to the candidate that won their state.  So theoretically, though highly unlikely, enough of the Electoral College could decide that Trump is not qualified for the Presidency, and could either vote for other choices or Hillary Clinton, so that she gets enough to win a majority, or at least a plurality of the College to win.<br><br>Let me impress upon you that this is a highly unlikely scenario, but is not completely unprecedented.  In fact Alexander Hamilton, I think it was, basically described that the purpose of Electoral College was to prevent the populous from electing someone who is vastly unqualified from becoming president.  And I think there is an argument that Mr. Trump is uniquely unqualified for the position.  There is something known as a Faithless Elector.  It is rare, but occasionally happens where an Elector does not vote for the person they are supposed to.  The last time it happened was in 2004, a Minnesota Elector voted for John Edwards instead of John Kerry, who he was pledged to vote for.<br><br>Now to this point in US History these Faithless Electors have never actually decided an election.  Enough Electors have voted the way the College implies they will vote.  But as we have seen continuously, this election seems to break all the rules.  So in theory there could be enough Faithless Electors that allow Secretary Clinton to be elected President instead of Mr. Trump. </p>

            <p>In the most 2016ish way possible.<br><br>(Wasn&#39;t the 2004 incident a mistake, rather than a deliberate act of rebellion?)<br><br>Apparently four electors threatened to do exactly this: two Democrats from Washington said they&#39;d refuse to vote Clinton (which they&#39;re pledged to), and Republicans in Georgia and Texas said they&#39;d refuse to vote Trump (ditto).<br><br>A random article from <i>Time</i> talks about this and suggests the following:<br><br><i>The first applies if an elector abstains or flips his vote in such a way that it results in an Electoral College tie. In such a case, then a little known provision buried in the Twelfth Amendment mandates that the House decides the president, while the Senate chooses the vice president. Each state delegation in the House casts one vote for president, and whichever candidates get the simple majority wins.<br><br>The second constitutional check is more broad. On January 6, 2017, the newly elected Congress will meet to determine if the Electoral College vote was “regularly given.” For most of the country’s 57 past presidential elections, this vote has been ceremonial. But it doesn’t have to be. If just one House member and one senator objects to the way that the Electoral College vote played out—for example, if a faithless elector swings the final tally—then the new members can retreat to chambers to vote on what to do about it. If the House and Senate agree, their decision is final. If the House or the Senate do not agree, then the dispute goes to the “executive of the state,” meaning the state’s Secretary of State, who would make the final call.<br><br>In other words, if Satiacum, Chiafalo, Vu, or Suprun cast a vote that ultimately alters the course of the election, and anyone in the newly-elected House or Senate balks, then the decision, in all likelihood, will be delegated to Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, or Texas Secretary of State Carlos Cascos. And while it’s impossible to say what, exactly, those state chiefs would choose, they would be under extraordinary pressure to honor the voters’ will.</i><br><br>I kind of hope it will happen, just for the total 2016ishness of it all. (Is the the point where I go off-the-wall and start yelling &#39;Hail Discordia&#39;?)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>but there are two teensy-weensy but ever-so-crucial, little, tiny details in the article that they got wrong.<br><br>(Please tell me that <i>someone</i>&#39;s able to pick up the reference that I smuggled in there without having to resort to Google!)<br><br>1) That second check is not constitutional, it&#39;s statutory. To be precise, even though the Twelfth Amendment does state that the President of the Senate (a.k.a. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section3">the Vice President of the United States</a>) shall count the electoral votes in the presence of the House and Senate, the provision cited regarding determining whether the vote was &quot;regularly given&quot; is in a statute: <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/15">3 U.S.C. § 15</a> (United States Code, Title 3, Section 15) to be exact.<br><br>2) When a federal statute refers to the &quot;executive&quot; of a State, it means the governor of the state, not its Secretary of State. So the people that the article should have named are Washington Governor Jay Inslee, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott.<br><br>Details aside, however, I must agree that it would be quite the capstone to the 2016 election if even <i>more</i> discord were to arise at the very tail end of the process.</p>

            <p>Yes, Donald Trump will probably be a bad president. Yes, him being elected despite losing the popular vote sucks. Yes, progress, whatever that word means to you, may stall. But it doesn&#39;t have to move backwards.<br><br>The U.S. government is not a monolith. It can, has been, and will again be, bowed by the public. Even the Republican majority government can be overcome.  Nothing is certain, anything can change. Personally, I have resolved to wait and see, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too unreasonable an idea for most of us to do the same.<br><br>Meanwhile, please don&#39;t write off the people who voted for Trump. Some of his voters were undoubtedly jerks, but definitely not all, and certainly not enough to bring him within spitting distance of the popular vote. There were real, rational reasons to vote for him, and there were real, rational reasons to vote against Hillary. And those who voted for third party candidates had legitimate reasons to dislike both candidates, on policy and character grounds.<br>Everyone picked the candidate they thought best, and if you dismiss that idea you&#39;ll never understand why they held the beliefs they did, or how to change them.<br><br>There are two rather insightful quotes by John Green I feel are useful here; &quot;truth resists simplicity,&quot; and, &quot;imagine others complexly.&quot;<br>The world isn&#39;t black and white, the political divide isn&#39;t right and wrong, and the choice this election was not, to most, good or bad.<br><br>And who knows, Trump might just surprise us. I don&#39;t think he will, but none of us can see the future. Maybe a few good things will come out of his term. Personally I&#39;m hopng this whole debacle will give some momentum to election reform.<br><br>-Badger, who dreams of a world where First Past the Post voting and the Electoral College have gone the way of the dodo.</p>

            <p>I mean, looking at his cabinet, this is going to be a rough two - four years. Still, hopefully something happens that makes these years not horrifically awful.<br><br>Now, I do want to ask this sincerely: what do you want to see implemented other than first-past-the-post? Now, electoral collage? Scrap it. It is the absolute worst system I have ever seen in a so called &quot;democracy&quot; that was outdated at the very outset, and certainly is outdated now.

            <p>Well, I&#39;ll admit that my first reaction was relief as well. Relief at knowing USA had elected a President more open to a multi-polar world, a President who is not going to try to go for another attempt at regime change, in my country or elsewhere, a President who&#39;s consistently signalled he&#39;s going to leave our Syrian operation be and not plunge the country into further chaos by giving more weapons to terrorists and imposing a &quot;no-fly zone&quot;.<br><br>Of course, the human brain is naturally wired to detect threats and plan for them rather then rest on laurels, so now I&#39;m also terrified about what he&#39;ll do to climate, alongside basically everyone else who takes heed. Though, I have learnt today that he signed a letter alongside lots of other businessmen telling Obama to do more about climate change before Copenhagen. <br><br>An uncharitable interpretation is that he only did it to spite Obama, of course, and his later denialism was his real view... but he has to understand it now, or else he wouldn&#39;t be building seawalls for his Scottish properties. Moreover, there was that thing he said about his deal-making principle when discussing the Iran deal, I believe: to first terrify everyone and get lots of concessions, but ultimately go along with the spirit of it. In that case, the current panic might even be more beneficial in long term than the complacency Hillary&#39;s years would&#39;ve brought.<br><br>If all that fails and he does what he currently says... he&#39;s an enormously unpopular US leader worldwide, who would be taking up a position every other country&#39;s leader understands is highly dangerous for them. If that&#39;s not a perfect storm for open defiance of USA that will lead to the imposition of global sanctions, I don&#39;t know what is. In that case, the impact on the economy and the associated decrease in consumption will also help to reduce emission and probably counter much of his coal-loving.    <br><br>As someone who doesn&#39;t live in the US and so isn&#39;t affected by its domestic policy (as fascinating as it can often be, for right and wrong reasons), these global-reaching issues were of main importance to me. From reading the board, I understand that many of you have legitimate grievances and reasons to feel unsafe now, but again, it&#39;s only four years before you can radically beat the tide back. The US is still one of the better countries in the world to be LGBTQ+, etc., and four years won&#39;t undo that. <br><br>Your prisons and police are a disgrace of course (in Russia, it&#39;s actually illegal for police to open fire without giving warning), and this is set to get worse, but like it or not, the rest of the world will barely notice this in comparison to above. Perhaps, you&#39;ll finally manage to recognise great and capable candidates before it&#39;s too late next time. You still had you could vote for in this election of course, named Jill Stein. Would&#39;ve loved if she won it somehow, and hope she and Baraka will manage to put these four years to good use regardless.     </p>

            <p>I&#39;m genuinely curious to know what President Obama did that you needed to &#39;survive&#39;. I know what I&#39;m afraid Trump will do - that&#39;s the antagonistic (or at least potentially-antagonising reply, which I will make if requested but not if not), but from over here it doesn&#39;t look like Obama has done <i>anything</i> to decrease the quality of life of Americans as a whole or individually. (I can actually only name two things he did, period: took a baby-step towards proper healthcare, and killed Bin Laden. He&#39;s not made much of an impression on me.)<br><br>So: what did you &#39;survive&#39;? Enquiring me&#39;s want to know.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>but also know that the fears of the rest of the Board do have some basis in fact.

            <p>You know Trump has appointed a climate change denialist to the EPA? We&#39;ve already failed to meet our goals in that regard - temperature rise now seems irreversible - but Trump is accelerating it. That&#39;s a literal end-of-the-world scenario - not just the &quot;OMG he&#39;s gunna take mah guns&quot; nonsense you&#39;ve had to live with while Obama&#39;s been President.<br><br>Also: felon? There&#39;s this little principle about <i>innocent until proven guilty</i> in US law. Hillary Clinton has not been found guilty of a felony; hence, she&#39;s not a felon. Calling her one basically amounts to slander. You can dislike her all you want, but if you&#39;re going to repeat lies, you&#39;re going to lose the respect of a lot of people (such as me).<br><br>Maybe one day the USA will get a modern democratic system - then we won&#39;t have Republicans losing the popular vote but getting the White House anyway.<br><br>Hopefully, though, Trump might be able to push through Congressional term limits. If he does that, his Presidency might not be a total loss.<br><br>Lastly: kindly do not pray for me. If you want to do something for me, use your voice to <i>stop Trump undoing everything the world&#39;s been working towards.</i> Thank you.<br><br>(i&#39;m dying of heat down here please stop the warming)</p>

            <p>It is not basically slander, accusing someone of a crime is under US Law Defamation Per-Se.  Usually that means they would not even need to prove damages to win on that.  Now as Secretary Clinton is a public figure, such comments would need to have been made with actual malice, which is an incredibly high standard to meet.  But as this is a board posting it would actually be libel not slander.  But other than they name the two forms of defamation are the same.<br><br>And I agree seriously, it seems America forgot that whole innocent until proven guilty with regards to Secretary Clinton.

            <p>And I am not happy for many reasons. Chief among them would have to be that, in all likelihood, I could very well lose my health insurance next year once the Republicans axe the ACA. I will almost certainly lose the tax credit I receive on it, which would make insurance a rather onerous financial burden. My father is also at risk. Given that he suffers from diabetes and depression (the latter of which I also struggle with), it will be especially hard on him.<br><br>I am also not happy at finding out how many of my fellow citizens are either bigots, or willing to tolerate bigots just to get their own way. I had a smidgen of hope that people might overcome their more base natures to do the right thing. I was wrong. So I suppose I should be a bit grateful in that the election has reaffirmed my choice of Internet pseudonym.<br><br>The list goes on. I am not happy that national attempts to curb climate change will be abandoned. I am not happy that federal protections for the LGBTQ+ community will likewise be discarded. I am not happy that a theocratic nutjob is a heartbeat away from the Presidency. I am not happy that every bully, every white nationalist, every neo-nazi, and every proto-facist has been given even a bit of validation.<br><br>In short, it&#39;s not been a fun day in my head.<br><br>But I will not allow myself to give in to despair.

            <p>I guess the best we can do now is try to make our feelings known during the midterm elections in 2018. For now, though, I hope Trump is merely an incompetent buffoon, and not the reason we have a World War 3.</p>

To slightly alter a line from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abwc7AAXn3A">a YouTube video I saw today</a>, while all the bigots voted for Trump, not everyone who voted for Trump is a bigot. (Case in point, yours truly: black, Haitian, PPC Boarder).<br><br>We were faced with a horribly flawed choice. Were any other Democrat facing Trump, his multiple gaffes would have ended the election then and there. And were any other Republican facing off against Hillary, the e-mail scandals may well have been her death knell.<br><br>And let&#39;s not be deceived: <i>both</i> candidates were flawed. The media has highlighted Trump&#39;s faults, but let&#39;s not pretend that Hillary is blameless. She is clearly corrupt, believing herself above the law. Bill Clinton talks to the head of the Justice Department, and surprise, surprise, even though FBI Director Comey spells out that Hillary was &quot;extremely reckless&quot; with classified information (translated into legalese: <a href="http://aclj.org/national-security/go-where-the-evidence-leads-former-secretary-of-state-clintons-email-felony">&quot;gross negligence&quot;</a>), the Justice Department declines to prosecute.<br><br>More personally for me, the &quot;humanitarian&quot; Clinton Foundation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6unuLJbapDQ&amp;feature=share">misappropriated funds meant to go towards rebuilding Haiti after the 2010 earthquake</a>, but since the mainstream news media has a left-leaning bias, no one hears a thing unless they actually do some digging.<br><br>And need I say &quot;Benghazi&quot;? While our diplomats get killed in a terrorist attack, Hillary and Obama are already looking towards some pastor in Florida as a scapegoat. (Let&#39;s completely ignore the fact that the attacks came on the anniversary of one of the worst disasters to occur on American soil. Ignore the man behind the curtain! Look at this Floridian jester instead!)<br><br>And <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/03/fbi-agreed-to-destroy-laptops-clinton-aides-with-immunity-deal-lawmaker-says.html">I could go on</a>.<br><br>Hillary becoming President would have just been the capstone of a long-time grasp for power and impunity.<br><br>Personally, I wanted someone sane to be the Republican nominee. I can only pray that Congress can curb his worst instincts. No president rules alone. <br><br>However, if faced with the choice between two evils, better the one who&#39;d clearly state that he wants to kill me than the one who&#39;d hug me only to get a good angle to plunge a knife in my back. Trump isn&#39;t ideal. No one can deny that. But though I may be in the minority here on the Board, at least let it be said that I made a cogent argument for honestly believing that Hillary would have been worse.</p>

Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person’s actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past.<br><br>In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.<br><br>[...]<br><br>As a result, although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case.</i> (<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system">Source on the FBI website</a>)<br><br>The <b>FBI</b>, not the Justice Department, made the initial statement that they didn&#39;t think charges were appropriate.

            <p>Yes, it was Director Comey who first recommended that Clinton not be prosecuted. However, the final decision on whether to prosecute belongs to the Attorney General (who is the head of the Justice Department), not the head of the FBI.<br><br>So in my haste (the post was made at 11:16 PM New York time), I wrongly truncated the facts.<br><br>The point that I wanted to make was that even though there were possible grounds for a prosecution, it appeared that the fix was in to ensure that Clinton would get away scot-free.</p>

            <p>The Wikipedia article is virtually unreadable, but seems to say that Secretary of State Clinton&#39;s heinous crime was... not increasing security? More specifically, not increasing security in the face of this specific potential - not, apparently, a direct threat of - terrorist attack?

            <p>I have to admit that I was misled in part.<br><br>Long story short, the conservative talking points were 1) that Clinton ignored calls for help in Benghazi, and 2) that Clinton misled the American people by saying that the attack was part of a spontaneous protest instead of a coordinated terrorist attack.<br><br>As far as the first talking point is concerned, <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/14/mike-pence/pence-falsely-says-clinton-didnt-send-help-during-/">this article from the fact-checking website Politifact</a>, shows that it&#39;s clear that saying that Clinton ignored cries for help is patently unfair. So I admit that I&#39;ve been misled.<br><br>As far as the second talking point, though, there is some basis in fact. As factcheck.org puts it: &quot;But, at this point, we do know that Obama and others in the administration were quick to cite the anti-Muslim video as the underlying cause for the attack in Benghazi that killed four U.S. diplomats, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. And they were slow to acknowledge it was a premeditated terrorist attack, and they downplayed reports that it might have been.&quot; <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2012/10/benghazi-timeline/">Here is the full article.</a></p>

            <p>I just... I have been trying to see the positives. I have been trying to see how or why this happened. I just... I can&#39;t. This is unbelievable. This is not the America I knew. This is not the America I love. My America is a land of hope and optimism. It is a cultural meting pot, where anyone who is willing to put the work in can make a living for themselves.

            <p>I&#39;m reminded of how people in Russia voted for Pikachu because they were so upset with the government as it was. I get it, people, you&#39;re upset and all. But really, what part of working with what you&#39;ve got do you not understand? Sometimes the choice we have to make isn&#39;t what we want, but that is no reason to pull such a dick move out of pure spite.<br><br>I can understand if there was no way you could vote, but sending in a joke candidate just to flip off every candidate in the running is Not Cool in any way, and would more than likely give the majority vote to the candidate with the biggest vote tally e.g. Trump. It&#39;s like they say, those who don&#39;t learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.</p>

The revulsion at Trump and Trumpists was evidently public handwringing by people who had no intention of voting any other way. And since they had power at state and local levels, because for some reason the American left is really, really bad at voting down-ballot, they were able to gerrymander and suppress and initiate ridiculous laws based on fear; not the fear that there was going to be fraudulent conduct at the election, but fear that their party was going to lose. Even when its Presidential candidate is on trial in December for child molestation and its VP candidate wants to run mains electricity through the genitals of queer youth.<br><br>The disenfranchised tried to vote for a better future, and were systematically denied the opportunity to do so. I can&#39;t believe this is the case in America, wherein democracy is one of the most sacred principles - oh, wait, yes I can, because American democracy is only a sacred principle as long as everyone involved is a white man. Or orange man, as the case may be.<br><br>Love does not inherently trump hate. Voting trumps hate. Throw yourselves into activism. Throw yourselves forward. I plan on running for local government in my constituency and I urge you all to do the same. We win when we can do what the right does - take control and get people voting down-ballot en masse. Then we can break the back of the GOP, a party so in thrall to its worst excesses it might as well replace its policy lab with a meth lab. Then, and only then, can people who view voting as a lifestyle choice rather than a means of making the country better one soul at a time chuck ballots at Jill Stein and Gary Johnson and every other nonentity with not a snowball&#39;s chance in a blast furnace of forming a bloody government.<br><br>The American people are derelict in their duty, which is the duty of all humanity, to create a better world. The greedy and the stupid have won today. Now is the time for anyone who genuinely believes in the idea of America, in the ideal of a democracy run for the benefit of the people it governs rather than corporate institutions, to get out and be active. I said it after the 2015 general election, I said it after Brexit, and I&#39;ll say it again:-<br><br>This fight is over.

            <p><i>One country</i> elected a bad leader.  Throwing 7 billion people under the bus just because of the actions of 60 million is an overreaction.  That&#39;s not even considering all the people of the future who apparently are also &quot;beyond redemption,&quot; whatever redemption means to you.  (It also shows a remarkable lack of understanding as to what other species are actually like.  Humans aren&#39;t great, but human men don&#39;t regularly murder the children of women they&#39;re attracted to in order to get her to have kids with them.  Male felines do.  And the only reason ducks aren&#39;t required to register as sex offenders is that they lack the sapience to take responsibility for their actions.)<br><br>It also deserves to be pointed out that frankly, in the list of human crimes, this is extremely small potatoes.  That&#39;s not to say it&#39;s good, but compared to the kind of things humanity has already done, it&#39;s nothing.  If you&#39;re sheltered to the point where you&#39;ve never heard of things like the Rape of Nanking, that&#39;s good for you.  But if we really are beyond redemption as a species, this was not the deciding moment.  It&#39;s not even close.</p>

            <p>First, he&#39;s burned a <i>lot</i> of bridges in his own party. That&#39;s gonna make it hard to get anything done. I&#39;m still holding out hope Obama can fineigle a Supreme Court justice in the next two months. And much - though certainly not all - of Obama&#39;s reforms and policies will be tough to overturn. At least quickly. I mean, anyone remember how the republican filibuster stopped him from getting anything substantive done for years?<br><br>Second, the military doesn&#39;t like or trust him. Yes, we need a peaceful transfer of power. But I know they have ways of handling presidents who are clearly not mentally competent to hold power - best example being late-stage Nixon. Regardless of what Trump believes his power is, they won&#39;t commit war crimes for him. <br><br>And, third- this will hopefully lead to some serious reforms of both the primary and electoral systems that we have <i>badly</i> needed for a long, long time. <br><br>Lastly… it was close. Very close. And even now I&#39;m fairly sure Hillary got the popular vote (see above, on our useless, outdated, error-ridden electoral system). I&#39;m very, very angry at the republicans who swallowed their conscience and voted for a man whose only policy was hate, at the Bernie or Bust crowd who even now are blaming Hillary supporters for Trump, at the media who pushed Trump into the spotlight because his antics made for better ratings, and at the Democrats who didn&#39;t turn out because somehow they didn&#39;t feel happy <i>enough</i> about Hillary. <br><br>It took us eight years to learn that mistake with Bush. Let&#39;s hope we learn it a little quicker this time. <br><br>(And, also, though I briefly hoped for impeachment too, please bear in mind that, Republican house and senate aside, Pence&#39;s policies are fairly well reflected in <i>A Handmaid&#39;s Tale</i>. We&#39;re stuck with this now. Strategies have to be riding it out and blocking the damage on a state, local, and federal level, and <i><b>getting the $@£¥ VOTE OUT next election</b></i>. And I don&#39;t just mean four years, I mean midterms in two years. VOTE, people.)</p>

            <p>And yeah, you need the changes. This system was thought for a country too vast for knowing quickly the results, and that stopped to be a problem a long time ago.<br><br>Direct universal suffrage is sorely needed. And several turns of election to make sure nobody goes in this Oval Office without the majority of the country behind them.</p>

            <p>Way back in the golden age of 2010, we in Britain had a moment of balance. The Labour and Conservative parties both failed to win a majority in the general election, which meant the Liberal Democrats - the only functioning left-wing we had - held the power to shape the next four years. Should they form a coalition with the larger, but right-wing Conservatives, or should they stick to their principles and form one with Labour?<br><br>They chose the Conservatives. And then they did absolutely nothing to moderate the Conservative government that followed. They demonstrated conclusively that even the most idealistic politicians want nothing more than to get into power and stay there.<br><br>So no, I don&#39;t believe the Republican Congress will let Obama appoint a new justice to spite Trump. I don&#39;t believe they&#39;ll do a single blessed thing to stop Trump once he&#39;s in. And I don&#39;t believe for a single instant that they will alter an electoral system that just handed <i>their</i> party the win - except to try and bias it further in their favour while they have a solid grip on the reins.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... &#39;at least Brexit looks marginally less stupid by comparison&#39;.<br><br>Actually I can&#39;t which is worse: deliberately exiling yourself from the international community, or voting in someone who doesn&#39;t seem to think anyone who&#39;s not exactly like him (rich, American, right-wing, <s>orange</s> white, male, and old) is a real person.<br><br>And both results spring from a growing distrust of &#39;the establishment&#39; - which translates into voting for the most obnoxious people because they&#39;re more &#39;real&#39; than the politicians.

            <p>There&#39;s, what, 58.6 million votes for Clinton out there? That&#39;s at least, oh, twenty percent of the voting-age population who felt it was worth the effort to try and prevent a racist, sexist xenophobe from taking the Executive branch (to go with a Legislative branch already held by his party, and a Judicial branch which said legislators have helpfully held a place open for him in - is there a word for the entire &#39;checks &amp; balances&#39; system being under control of a single party?).

            <p>Authoritarianism or Despotism.  And I am deeply concerned about what happens next.  If Mr. Trump follows through on even half of his promises, this deeply disturbing.  I mean lets look at it, prosecuting his political opponents, categorically banning an entire religious group, mass deportations, splintering of families, and the like.  I hope he moderates his position, but he has moderated as of yet, and I see no reason why he will with all branches of government under his party&#39;s control.</p>

            <p>Early voting is awesome.<br><br>I would add to World-Jumper&#39;s words: your vote might not count if you do vote, but it <i>definitely</i> won&#39;t count if you don&#39;t. And the fewer people there are who vote, the fewer people there are whose votes count, and that is <i>bad</i>. So go do it, and drag your reluctant friends and family with you.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. By the same logic, please recycle, switch to more energy-efficient lightbulbs, turn out lights when you leave the room, save water, etc. The more people who do these things, the bigger the difference that will be made.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve always been very uncomfortable with my chest even before I began questioning my gender identity, and finally coming out to my (mercifully accepting) parents is what made me decide to go ahead and do it now, rather than wait until later. Plus, January/February is when my first job&#39;s schedule slows down, and I&#39;ll be going back to school and subsequently dropping my second job (seasonal) so I&#39;ll be able to take the time off that&#39;s needed to recover. <br><br>Basically, for me, it was a question of when and not if. I bind, which is a) itchy, b) uncomfortable, and c) not nearly a good enough substitute for the real deal. It&#39;ll be a relief to have this off my chest at last—literally. I can&#39;t wait to be able to go to the pool in just trunks, to be able to run without any pain... and hopefully it&#39;ll also stop my recurring tumors from growing back. <br><br>And yes, that was the short story. I left out the angsting that happened in-between. :P</p>

            <p>No, I did not miss that bit. I was (obviously too obliquely) alluding to a mastectomy, which sounded like what you were really looking for anyway.
