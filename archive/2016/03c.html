            <p>It was a real thing, and you can see the agents talking about what they typically do in the beginning of the first mission. The reason the missions are, well, missions is explained thus:<br><br> Claudia sat bolt upright, her face twisted in anger and disbelief. “Gilthoniel, a Elbereth,” she muttered, glaring venomously at the window that had popped up on the screen. “Apparently all the assassins are busy,” she said to the confused Ella.<br><br>“What does that mean?” Ella asked, hoping the answer was not what she thought it was.<br><br>“It means we get to play assassin.” 
<br>This sort of thing—Suefics getting sent to anyone not nailed down or on fire—happened a lot back in the day. You could say it&#39;s sort of a tradition.<br><br>But anyway, as to whether or not it could be revived... eh, I&#39;m not so sure. We have a policy these days of not writing about the authors and keeping our comments solely on the writing. This way, we avoid (most) accusations of bullying.<br><br>However, there&#39;s nothing stopping you from actually giving people concrit and trying to help them improve their stories. In fact, I would encourage this! Just make sure to actually give <i>concrit</i>, not flames. Save your snark for the privacy of the Board.<br><br>I suppose there might be a way to get a PPC story out of it, assuming the author is willing, but I confess I don&#39;t know how. Maybe someone else will have an idea?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>A <i>different</i> tradition from back in the Days O&#39; Yore was making up badfics; surely this could be extended to making up badfic authors as well? All you&#39;d need to do would be a quick search on the Pit and similar to check whether or not the name you&#39;d cooked up for your Suethor was registered there and then you could go right ahead.<br><br>How I&#39;d do it, personally, would be to frame sections of it as IM chat between the agents and your made-up Suethor - and to do so with the Agents providing serious and in-depth concrit of a story which, while not real, might well be closely related to one that is (the Lauren Faust line regarding Twilight Sparkle&#39;s name of &quot;it passed Legal&quot; would be something to consider). After that, perhaps the agents appearing in person, the Suethor is revealed to be a decent if slightly dim person - or not, it&#39;s up to you - and we all go about our business.<br><br>Something to consider, at any rate. =]</p>

            <p>I can dig through my stash! Let&#39;s see here...<br><br>Here&#39;s one I found recently. It&#39;s a RWBY fanfic.

He also has a CAF-a wolf named Gore that he literally brings into Beacon&#39;s cafeteria without getting a complaint from the staff.</p>

            <p>...but I have a theory that any fic found on Tumblr or FFN that focuses on MCU!Loki will either contain poor SPaG, Sues, poor characterisation, urple prose, urple prose pretending it is dialogue, or (most likely) a combination of the above. Sadly, I have yet to be proven wrong.</p>

            <p>But since you did it, I can contribute with something veeeery bad.<br><br><a href="http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?chapterid=221681&amp;i=1">Harry Potter and the Dementor of Azkaban</a><br><br>To start, we&#39;ve got a paticulary nasty case of a Sue: It&#39;s the first time that I&#39;ve actually seen a half-Dementor (sic). Let me just quote you an passage from &quot;Potter Sue of the Day&quot; livejournal:<br><br>&quot;<i><b>ORIGIN:</b> Apparently, being a dementor is like having a disease, and Voldemort claims to have a cure for it. Suprisingly, there is no explanation about her existence. She is just a half-dementor, and that&#39;s that.<br><br><b>CONNECTIONS TO CANON:</b> She used to guard the prisoners in Azkaban, as a child she gave Sirius the name Snuffles. Dumbledore, Snape and McGonagall went to Azkaban to teach her magic. The Order wants to recruit her as a spy, now that Snape killed Dumbledore. She is surly and rude to Tonks, and does not trust Harry. She seems to know that Snape is not evil. But, of course, everyone starts to love her and see her as a human. She gets to train Harry in ways of wandless magic and Occlumency. She gets to go off with Harry and Draco to look for Horcruxes. She and George fall in love. Awwwww.<br><br><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES:</b> An &quot;extremely gifted witch&quot;, she is trained as an Auror, &quot;she has experience in dealing with souls&quot;. She can see someones soul by looking into their eyes. She can speak French. She can brew Wolfsbane</i> [Potion]<i>. She can do the Dementor-breath-rattle, but she can&#39;t suck out souls. She is skilled at all sorts of spells.</i>&quot;<br><br></p>

            <p>The writing is pretty decent mechanically, I think, but still... what a strange idea. I&#39;m all for further exploring ideas about prejudice and tolerance, but a better candidate species might have been a vampire. We don&#39;t know enough about them to say there <i>couldn&#39;t</i> be half-breeds, as far as I&#39;m aware, and at least they&#39;re flesh and blood. I don&#39;t want to think about how you&#39;d get a half-Dementor.<br><br>But of course I am anyway. Best I can come up with is to postulate that maybe she got her soul sucked out halfway (except we know that doesn&#39;t make Dementors, just vegetables); or maybe, like, her mom received the Kiss when she was still in the womb, and that somehow affected her? I don&#39;t think that actually makes sense, either, but it&#39;s better than considering actual Dementor/human reproduction. &gt;.<br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Didn&#39;t mean to make you search through Google for stuff.<br><br>Yes, The Iron Bull is a spy, in fact those are pretty much the first words out of his mouth to you in DA:I. IIRC he later explains that the reason he told you that when you first meet is because finding out later, when the two of you are getting along/friends would potentially shatter any trust you have, whereas him coming out and saying it straight up means you always know what he is. Or something like that (it&#39;s been a while)<br>In fact so long as the group a spy is spying for and the group they are spying on aren&#39;t enemies, it can be a valid, if risky tactic for the spy to take. <br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>And as for the translation spell, I reworded it so Sarah&#39;s angry over the spell being used to make the RAPTORS talk, rather than the spell itself.

The girl in this is either a vampire or a Sue, I&#39;m not sure. Either way, it&#39;s a terrible idea, dude. Just say no. O.o<br><br>I could nominate just about anything by Voltaire, but I think all agents probably feel like this some days: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IWi2LperuQ">&quot;Screw the Ocampa (I Wanna Go Home)&quot;</a> - warning, NSFW.<br><br>Also, pretty much the entire soundtrack from &quot;Once More With Feeling.&quot; It&#39;s an episode of <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> that has a demon who forces the residents of Sunnydale to burst into song and dance as though they were in a musical, and they&#39;re aware of it. It&#39;s one of the most beautiful and perfect things in existence. Here, I&#39;ll just give you the first track: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-xPRA2j2Mg">&quot;Going Through the Motions.&quot;</a> You can find the rest from there, if you&#39;re so inclined.

            <p>But I&#39;m slowly developing a reputation for being the guy who turns the radio down/off when no one else is in the room.  I can&#39;t stand the repetitiveness of U.S. radio play.

            <p>I can understand if you&#39;re a certain kind of place, so you play a certain kind of music to go with that kind of place, but I dunno why an Italian-style pizza place has to characterize itself with pop music. I can at least turn it down so I can hear people on the phone, though.

            <p>Since I restarted mini4wd racing in 2013, my only 1st place was obtained with a car built with these exact materials:<br><br>- A chassis originally scrapped for a defect in the gear cover latching, repaired initially for use in a track-cleaning car and then heavily modified for use in a front engine configuration (weight balance reason, and that kind of chassis oddly works better when the motor is running in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction)<br>- Body, bearings, rear FRP plate, wheels and assorted other parts coming from a car and some spares a coworker gave me (he stopped racing 7-8 years ago... and so all those parts were sitting gatherign dust for that long)<br>- Rear brake plate modified from one I had improved during a race about a year ago<br>- Motor and rollers &quot;borrowed&quot; from other cars of mine (of which I&#39;m going to have to buy more)<br><br>It was supposed to be only a prototype, and was in fact a rather rough build... but, once worked out some details, it proved to be pretty fast.<br><br>So, humble materials can and will obtain spectacular results if used the right way.</p>

            <p>(Wednesday Pluggage will be postponed until Friday; work stuff.)<br><br>I&#39;d like to thank everyone for taking part in Operation Oscilloscope.<br><br>I&#39;ll start off with the thing some of you might actually care about:<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kk8hdVlNMRSPti5OJniHTI-R0ceP-cBlggX8j3nlxl4/edit?usp=sharing">Traces on the Oscilloscope</a><br><i>An explanation for those danged badges at last.</i><br><br>Now on to the rambling about why; you can probably ignore this bit.<br><br>Operation Kaleidoscope rose out of me looking at the Board and seeing something lacking. It felt too quiet, and the threads that were around didn&#39;t feel like the threads I wanted to see. So I chose to make an effort to improve that.<br><br>People have been doing this for years, mostly by posting &#39;why is the Board so rubbish?!&#39;; it doesn&#39;t usually work. My method is different. For a month, I gave myself a set of rules:<br><br>-Post on every thread possible, at least once.<br>-Three times a week (Mon-Weds-Fri), create a thread that most if not all Boarders can get involved in.<br><br>The goal was to spark increased discussion, and prompt people to make interesting threads.<br><br>This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve tried this. Operation Kaleidoscope took place in September 2013, and I think I ran an Operation Teleidoscope somewhere in between too. All three have followed basically the same rules.<br><br>You may note I ended Oscilloscope early. That&#39;s because it was hard work; being ill for the middle of it didn&#39;t help, and nor did those danged badges, but the effort of being so talkative that (hopefully) other people got infected with talkativeness was just too much this time round. <br><br>So did it work?<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Oscilloscope.png"><br><br>That&#39;s hard to say. From the graphs, no: numbers of visitors are still dropping, and post-count dropped straight back off once I called it off. The number of threads posted in March is the same as in January or February, too.<br><br>From a subjective perspective? I kind of think it did, a bit. Certainly I seem to have given our newest members the idea that they should post lots of threads! But I do think people have come out with more interesting stuff in the last month.<br><br>But overall, it was a lot of effort for a very small gain. Oh, well, you win some, you muck up some...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The graphs were really intruiging - how do you keep track of all the posts? It certainly appears to be a lot of work just looking at it, so congratulations on a job well done. <br><br>Also, the badges are absolutely <i>brilliant.</i> I was inwardly squealing when I saw them.

            <p>At the end of the month, I copy the Board front page, and every back-page that contains posts from that month. I plug it into my spreadsheet, and run a cumbrous macro (related to the Dungeon of the Board, actually) which pulls out every post, its author, and its date, and slaps them together into a giant table.<br><br>Then I save the table for the month.

            <p>Do you have full charts for all board activity? I mean, as in boarders joined, posts, mission rate, just.. things in general, for the entire history of The Board. Yeah, this does look kinda sad. But the thing is, this isn&#39;t exactly sone of those sites you can find easily on the internet. That may be a good thing, though. Less trolls to worry about. The more people in an internet community, the higher chance that someone will make it so that we can&#39;t have nice things. I do wish I had caught on to how the badges really work, they seemed cool.

It also includes the IP/views data, which I think is the only thing not publicly accessible.<br><br>That last gives me the ability to make graphs like this:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/RedandBlue.png"><br><br>Which shows:<br><br>a) The dangers of estimates (the red region; the spike was definitely a period of high activity, but I don&#39;t think I was routinely doing 300 posts a month).<br>b) My long &#39;quiet period&#39; 09-12.<br>c) That you&#39;re in no danger of seeing low-level Huinesoron the Hobbits. <sup>_~</sup> I&#39;ve only dropped below 100 posts/month once in the last 16 months.<br><br>Last thing: [Halo] Moi?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>To be entirely honest, what I <i>want</i> to see is in-depth geeky conversations about minutae of continua I&#39;m interested in (mostly LotR), but I understand I&#39;m rather in a minority there. ;) So instead I&#39;ve been all self-sacrificing and tried to watch for threads that are interesting for <i>most of the Board</i>, rather than me in particular (or indeed, me at all sometimes).<br><br>In general, what I like to see are threads that prompt open-ended interaction. That needs an opening post which provides a foundation for conversation, but then lets it spiral off in interesting ways. A couple of examples:<br><br>-Geeky fandommy threads, including ones about the PPC. The Magic in North America threads were good for this - people (including me) got to throw insane theorising at the wall, and interact over it. I think there was a MLP thread that did the same thing, though obviously I didn&#39;t get into that one.<br><br>-Things that prompt storytelling (not necessarily formal writing). The Dungeon of the Board, or the Shipfest, or whatnot. Anything that gets people scribbling down narrative ideas on the Board. I like it when people write.<br><br>-Threads that let other Boarders share the same kind of thing the original poster did, while also commenting on each other&#39;s. My Fanarts &amp; Crafts thread worked perfectly for this, and was in turn inspired (to an extent) by Ix&#39;s costume, so that counts too. Ivy&#39;s Deduction thread, too.<br><br>-Other discussion threads, like posted news-articles and videos. The thing here is that the thread-starter needs to put in the effort to start a discussion. It&#39;s not enough to just slap up a link - lots of people won&#39;t follow links, and a lot of those who do will just reply with &#39;wow!&#39; or the like. One needs to say something to start and shape the conversation about it.<br><br>(An example I didn&#39;t post: there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timurlengia">new tyrannosaur</a> described a couple of weeks ago. I considered posting both to say it happened - fannish geekery - but also to look at the pictures that had been done of it, and see how good/bad they were. I didn&#39;t do it because I couldn&#39;t find much to talk about.)<br><br>Then there&#39;s the threads that I don&#39;t find particularly interesting, but which I support on principle:<br><br>-People posting their stories. Y&#39;know, the thing we&#39;re ostensibly here for. ;)<br><br>-Badfic threads. We used to pretty much have a big badfic thread every week or so; it&#39;s weird that it&#39;s stopped happening. I don&#39;t really get involved in them, but people howling over badfic is where the PPC started, so it&#39;s kind of a shame they&#39;ve gone.<br><br>Most other threads I&#39;d class as &#39;neutral&#39; - things that don&#39;t really make the Board more exciting in my view, but don&#39;t drag it down either. That covers newbie threads, closed-ended questions (the sort that are usually answered with &#39;here&#39;s where to find that in the wiki&#39;), beta requests and the like.<br><br>The one thread-type I&#39;ve seen a lot recently that I&#39;ve never liked is &#39;I&#39;ll be gone for the next three days!&#39;; I don&#39;t think we&#39;re a fast-moving, intense-enough community that people need to announce when they&#39;re not going to be around. I used to vanish for 2-3 weeks over summer and not say a word. But like my favourite thread type, that&#39;s a personal preference, and not one I&#39;d try to enforce (hence, no badge attacking it).<br><br>hS<br><br>(No doubt if you&#39;d asked on another day you&#39;d&#39;ve got a different answer...)</p>

From what I can tell, he has knowledge of the DC universe, isn&#39;t mentally affected by the voices Hal Jordan had when he became an Orange Lantern,  To me, something just doesn&#39;t seem right about this. Maybe it&#39;s that the text is inconsistent. Anyhow, I shouldn&#39;t be judging this work, as I haven&#39;t watched Young Justice. What do you guys (or gals) think?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m only a bit down Page 3 (I&#39;m busy with other stuff) but there are definitely some charges in the last couple of pages (like completely removing Venom from Bane&#39;s body and completely healing Superboy&#39;s ear) that seem to stray into Sue territory.  <br>To be fair though the author has stuck fairy rigidly to Young Justice, and has made it so that Oh El (aka the main character) isn&#39;t too OP. Is it truly mission worthy? I don&#39;t know at the moment, it depends on how things go as the fic goes on. Would I base a mission on what I&#39;ve read so far? No, there&#39;s not enough there.</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t got to far into it and I have to agree with you, something is off about the writing, I think it&#39;s the sentences, they&#39;re either two words long or about a line long most of the time. The worst case I&#39;ve found so far is:<br><br>&quot;everything hurts too much! My arms. My chest. My abdomen, my teeth, my eyes!&quot;<br><br>They obviously know to list things you use commas, but My arms and My chest are two sentences separate to the rest of the list for some reason (also not sure about the use of exclamation marks) <br><br>Interesting note: the main character (still haven&#39;t found a name yet) is actually from around Eastbourne, I study at Brighton University (so not that far away), so his description of the train line makes little sense, the line east out of Eastbourne splits BEFORE Polegate station, not after it, so why he would mention the station at all is weird (possible charge there, if anyone picked this up).<br><br>Another weird bit, he looks at the business of offices to work out what time it is, not the sun (and even if he is in New York, he hasn&#39;t stopped flying around yet so he could go high enough to avoid all the skyscrapers.<br><br>That&#39;s all for Part 1 (I&#39;ve got to go now) I&#39;ll finish looking at it later</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t quite think it&#39;s that. I mean, the no China thing could be a bit of wishful thinking, or it could be the characters way of checking whether the orange power ring knows anything about Earth, and what better way to check than asking it about one of the oldest and largest countries in the world. Besides, unless it&#39;s mentioned further in (I&#39;m on page 2 of 35), it&#39;s a one off mention. <br><br>Body Armour, IMO is actually a good cool for a regular human in any universe with super powers, cool tech powers or not, it&#39;s a way of keeping alive. Besides there are plenty of heroes who use that kind of thing as part of their costume (Batman for instance), so I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too big a thing.<br><br>The currency thing I&#39;d agree with, it&#39;s obviously his personal view, and as the character appears to be a self-insert, it&#39;s his character personal view as well. It&#39;s probably one of the biggest charge worthy things my initial read through (so far) has picked out, I doubt he could get as much stuff as he has by giving people stuff he says is gold (or platinum) without them checking it in some way (which would take time to authenticate I believe).<br><br>Like I&#39;ve said before some of the punctuation and sentences seem a bit weird, and sometimes I&#39;ve had to go back over some things to work out who is saying what, but I&#39;m not sure if its mission worthy yet. Of course I have 33 pages of posts to get through so it can all change, but that&#39;s my opinion at the moment.<br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>I am a person with many thoughts that stay often stuck somewhere in the recesses of my mind. I often don&#39;t act on my ideas, <s>perhaps because they tend to be murderous</s> for one reason or another. However, I received some inspiration from hS&#39;s &quot;Wednesday Non-Pluggage,&quot; which has ultimately led to this post. <br><br>I am an amateur deductionist. <s>Technically, the science of what we all call deduction is actually induction or abduction, but the word &quot;deduction&quot; is more recognisable to the general public.</s> I also enjoy experiments. I have decided to conduct an experiment in deduction. <br><br>I&#39;ve seen that there&#39;s other Sherlockians on the Board, and I&#39;m sure most of us have tried to deduce at one point or another. Once a week or so, I&#39;ll do a Deduction Day, in which I&#39;ll share one or two things I&#39;ve gathered from observing my peers since the last DD. <s>Sadly, there is no day of the week that starts with &#39;d.&#39;</s> When my personal deductions are over, I&#39;ll share a tip from a deductionist I admire (person may vary). The third and final stage to a Deduction Day includes more than me rambling to you about deductions. Since I&#39;m still a shiny newbie, the early days of phase three include me trying to figure you out. If you wish, send a handwriting sample for me to deduce, because those are fun. A hand or a desk is also lovely, but don&#39;t feel pressured to send in anything at all. Also, feel free to talk about your own deductions, because deductions are cool. <br><br>Let&#39;s begin.<br><br><b>Part One</b><br><br>Some of my favourite deductions that I&#39;ve ever made involve studying a person&#39;s hand. It&#39;s surprising how much you can learn just by looking at the way they tap their fingers, or hold something. Both of the deductions that follow were proven to be correct, due to the fact that I asked my subject/victim. It&#39;s sort of awkward. <s>It&#39;s really awkward.</s><br><br><u>Scenario One</u><br><br>This took place in science class, almost by accident. Across the table from me, a boy was holding his pencil in his left hand. Since I&#39;m a lefty myself, I was a bit happy to see another one of my kind. What he did next, though, was curious: he switched his pencil into his right hand before beginning to write. The first conclusion was that he&#39;d simply held the pencil in his left hand on accident, as people sometimes use their non-dominant hand. We do have two hands. However, my peer appeared to be very comfortable with his left hand, going so far as to tap it on the table with little thought. This is something I could never do with my non-dominant (right) hand, meaning that he&#39;d somehow had a strong left-handed influence in his life. My final deduction was that a family member of his was left handed; it was his brother. <br><br><u>Scenario Two</u><br><br>Making one deduction often helps me set up logical rules in my mind. To make sure that these rules are true, I&#39;ll test them out once or twice in the field. As I was a part of my place of education&#39;s drama club this winter, there were quite a few people to deduce. I ended up conducting an extensive profile on one of them, due to the contents of his binder, though I&#39;ll focus on one. The boy (simply coincidence that both people were male, I just realised that) had his items to the left of his chair, and when he took his binder out of his backpack, he used his left hand. However, when I observed him writing, he used his right hand. I was able to make the same conclusion that I&#39;d used earlier, and once I asked him about it, I was again correct. The left-handed family member was one of his parents. <br><br>This does, in fact, work the other way around. <br><br><b>Part Two</b> <br><br>I&#39;ve recently found and been suitably impressed with <a href="03c%3Fuser_id=16.html">The Everyday Deductionist,</a> whose tumblr can be accessed by clicking on the link above. (At least, it should be a link.) This is what deductionist is <i>supposed</i> to look like, and I strive for the day I am close to this. <br><br>And if you thought that was interesting, <a href="03c%3Fuser_id=16.html">here&#39;s</a> something that is equal parts awesome and creepy. I thought it was kind of cool. <br><br><br>And, of course, <b>Part Three</b> is up to you! Pictures for me to deduce, tell me your own deductions - anything goes. The game, my friends, is <i>on!</i><br><br>-Vee<br></p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know as much about you as I do about Ix and hS, so I&#39;ll have a go. {= )<br><br>That red mark on your left hand is interesting. The image resolution isn&#39;t too good, but the edges don&#39;t appear to be distinct. I&#39;m gonna say that&#39;s a burn, and since coming into contact with a hot object would leave a well-defined mark, I&#39;m going to say further that it was caused by a hot liquid. Tea-making injury, perhaps?<br><br>In general, your hands don&#39;t bear any obvious scars, they&#39;re not tanned, and the nails are long and clean. You don&#39;t get outside much, and you don&#39;t do anything that requires much of your hands indoors, either. Otherwise your nails wouldn&#39;t be so neat, or else you&#39;d keep them short. Study and office work, all the time. The redness of your fingers and lack of prominent veins suggests you&#39;re cold. You have air conditioning, probably. Israel isn&#39;t exactly known for being frigid.<br><br>The desk looks like a student&#39;s desk, though it&#39;s not a dorm configuration I&#39;m familiar with. It&#39;s fixed to the wall and the floor is tile (I can see it in the first hand picture). It could go either way, but I think this is probably your desk at home, not at school; definitely not at work.<br><br>You live at your desk. You&#39;ve got everything you could possibly want within reach, even if you don&#39;t use it very often. Whatever you&#39;re currently working on migrates to the top/front of the pile; everything else drifts to the bottom/back. Suggests a mind that keeps track of things and doesn&#39;t need external organization to stay focused. You probably know exactly what and where everything is in those piles.<br><br>The scissors puzzle me. They&#39;re for precision work, like snipping thread or personal grooming. I don&#39;t see anything that suggests you sew, so I&#39;m leaning toward the latter. Maybe you use them on your nails, though the length and smoothness of them suggests you haven&#39;t cut them recently. I don&#39;t see a mirror, either, which you&#39;d want if the scissors were for facial hair. Yet the scissors are right there, so you did use them, and whatever might go with them, quite recently. Maybe the roll of toilet paper is a clue, in which case I&#39;d think you were grooming your facial hair and might have needed to blot a small cut or two, but maybe not. The paper roll might go with the empty plate. Need More Data.<br><br>Speaking of that plate, though, you like sushi, don&#39;t you? It could be something more akin to tapas, I guess, but those regular dots on the plate look a whole lot like a line of sushi roll pieces to me, with the odd dark dot of soy or maybe unagi sauce. Possibly homemade, though I&#39;m not sure you did it yourself; if you did, it&#39;s not something you do regularly. People who work with food keep their nails short. No chopsticks, but if you rolled it with your own hands, there&#39;s no reason not to eat it with your hands. Plus, there&#39;s a bottle of what might be hand sanitizer there, and the aforementioned paper roll. You keep your hands clean enough to eat with, and also not to leave much obvious smut on your keyboard.<br><br>There&#39;s an accumulation of dust and gunk between the keys and where your hands rub against it (unless it&#39;s just shadow + low image quality), but that&#39;ll happen with regular use anyway. It&#39;s probably a few years old. You don&#39;t spring for new technology as long as the old things still work. Considering the Board&#39;s demographic, you probably couldn&#39;t afford to even if you wanted to.<br><br>I also note that, like me, you own a camera, but didn&#39;t bother using it to take these pictures. Too difficult to operate with one hand, right? And higher image quality means harder to actually get that image quality if your hands won&#39;t stay still.<br><br>... And that&#39;s what stands out to me. How&#39;d I do?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll say what&#39;s wrong and what&#39;s not.<br>-IIRC the mark on my left hand is from a hot pan. Definitely not tea-related (or liquid-related in general).<br>-I work in a cafe&#39;s kitchen, but that&#39;s a recent thing. I don&#39;t do anything more taxing than cutting tomatoes, though.<br>-My hands were cold at the time because temperature was at the low tens Celsius. We don&#39;t have air conditioning here, and in fact I had a radiator working when I took that photo.<br>-The desk is indeed my desk at home.<br>-The stuff about organisation and the desk is spot-on.<br>-The small, grey scissors are for nails. I also fix my own clothes (especially when it&#39;s something small like a button), so I do cut thread with them once in a blue moon. The large scissors with black handles are actually my brother&#39;s.<br>-The tissue paper is there because it&#39;s spring and I have allergies.<br>-The plate is indeed for sushi. However, I didn&#39;t eat sushi from it; I ate pizza. The red specks are pizza seasoning.<br>-Hand sanitiser is for when the water in the tap is absolutely freezing.<br>-My computer is about four years old and refurbished at that. While it&#39;s true that I don&#39;t spring for new technology, I can theoretically afford a new computer (service grant from the army); I&#39;d rather spend the money on something else, though.<br>-The camera has no batteries. It used to be my brother&#39;s before he bought a serious professional camera. It&#39;s actually more comfortable to use than my phone&#39;s camera, especially since the phone uses a godsdamned touchscreen; Taking the photos of my right hand was a pain in the arse.<br><br>Bonus round (the other post):<br>-As mentioned, this is my desk at home.<br>-It&#39;s fixed to the wall because it&#39;s a custom-made desk (and takes less space).<br>-the TAU notebook is more than four years old; I got it when I was considering studying there via the Academic Reserve. I&#39;m currently not studying anything (I dropped law a few months ago because raisins).<br>-Carpet is, as you said, a pain to maintain, and also catches dust and other allergens.<br>-<i>On Grammatology</i> isn&#39;t a textbook, at least not in the usual sense. I took it from my mum&#39;s library because both she and a good friend spew fire and brimestone at it; I want to see what all the hassle is about.<br>-Most of the books on my desk are indeed fiction. Exceptions are <i>The Letters/Ars Poetica</i> by Horatius (near ASoIaF), the aforementioned <i>On Grammatology</i>, and <i>The Plague</i> by Camus.<br><br>So, yeah. Some things are spot on, some are wildly off the mark.</p>

            <p>Isn&#39;t actually a book. The subtitle reads &quot;one hundred covers from ten decades&quot;; it&#39;s a collection of postcards featuring the <i>New Yorker</i>&#39;s covers. IIRC an aunt — dad&#39;s sister — brought this back from the States? I think.</p>

            <p>The bed frame visible in the pen-holding photo looks like dorm furniture to me, and it&#39;s really close to the desk, so you probably are at school rather than at home. There are points for and against, though.<br><br>For school:<br><br>- Furniture set looks dorm-y, and close placement suggests very limited and/or shared space.<br>- Not many people actually fix their own furniture in place, but institutions do.<br>- The Tel Aviv University notebook.<br>- Obvious textbook on the desk.<br>- Tile flooring is easier to maintain than carpet, and would make sense in a hot place.<br>- You may need to supply your own toilet paper. I hear that&#39;s a thing some places.<br><br>For home:<br><br>- You could have taken the notebook home with you.<br>- The textbook is the only one I can identify, and since it&#39;s a language book and you&#39;re a PPCer, it&#39;s as likely to be for personal edification as for required reading.<br>- The other books I can identify look like fiction. (Is that <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> behind the laptop?)<br>- It just doesn&#39;t give the impression of being a place where school work happens. Hard to pin down.<br>- It&#39;s hard to imagine using plates in a dorm. I know people who did, but if I&#39;m right about what was on the plate, it&#39;s much too finicky a preparation for a dorm. (&#39;Course, you could have transferred food to the plate from somewhere else, or I could be just plain wrong.)<br><br>So... eh. Like I said, it could go either way as far as I can tell, but the bed does push me more toward &quot;dorm.&quot;<br><br>Nice taste in music, by the way. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>You, Nesh, and I have similar handwriting styles in that they&#39;re not very stylized. They&#39;re more designed for speed, with little flair. The focus is more on the content of the piece rather than its presentation, if that makes sense.<br><br>So I wonder how many other Boarders have a similar style, since this is such a writing-focused community.</p>

            <p>I just deduced the room, and it told me quite a bit. This made me feel quite smart, and despite the fact that it took forever, I&#39;m proud of the results. They are as follows:<br><br>-Right handed<br>-non-English writing; with some help from Google I was able to see that it was Polish. <br>-GMT+ 2 Time Zone, which fits. This I was able to confirm by finding the time you&#39;d taken the picture with the image of the PPC Board open on one of your computers. <br>-Electrical sockets confirm that you are, in fact, somewhere in Europe.<br>-Student, judging by the ID badge on the wall. Diploma tells me that you&#39;re a Uni student.<br>-You enjoy crime shows/detective stuff as a genre.<br>-Pictures on the wall show that you may have siblings, though this is unclear. The tinfoil butterfly, as well as the vaguely female shapes in the photo, imply that this person/people is/are female. <br>-I believe you have a car, since you have what appear to be car keys. This also implies that you&#39;re not in a larger city, where transportation such as taxis and the Tube would be available. <br>-I&#39;d say your phone is Samsung, judging by the fact that both your computers are of that brand. <br>-You enjoy video games.<br>-There is most likely a television somewhere in your room or flat, considering the amount of DVDs and things on your shelves. <br>-You have a game of Tarot cards, by the placement of them on your shelf, you aren&#39;t superstitious.<br>-You like to listen to music.<br>-Do you take some sort of medication? I&#39;m unsure. <br>-You wear glasses! (Me too.)<br>-I also happened to find your real name hidden in this photo, which I will not reveal because this is the Internet. <br><br>That&#39;s all I was able to deduce, although I will send more if I&#39;m able to think of others. How&#39;d I do? <br><br>-Vee<br></p>

            <p>but I know Tinypic can have some problems. <br><br>Anyway, onto the photo itself. Not looking at anything other than the photo, your love of Harry Potter is apparent, the posters for the first two movie posters makes that apparent. Bottom left is the poster for Assassin&#39;s Creed Unity, but obviously not the English poster like the one&#39;s for Harry Potter, interesting but nothing massive (that being said something looks off about the bottom Harry Potter poster, can&#39;t say what though). You have two computers (or rather a laptop and a computer) which suggests to me you need your laptop for work, and it&#39;s work not education due to the little card in the centre of the screen (OK you could be in University, but a couple of the certificates suggest to me otherwise). You don&#39;t appear to drive, or if you do you keep your car keys away from your house keys, (key ring looks like it doesn&#39;t hold a car key on it). On a slightly separate note I&#39;d say you&#39;re right handed from the scissors on your shelf. Also you either used to, or you may need to take some form of medication (or you&#39;re super organized for when you are ill) there are too many boxes in the little shelf bit of you desk otherwise.<br><br>Now your shelf, it was the first thing that attracted my attention (I&#39;m a massive gamer), and I can clearly see some games on there, you&#39;re a fan of the Sims series, you&#39;ve got Sims 3 and two of its expansions on the shelf, nearby some other big titles like Black Ops, Watch Dogs and Saints Row IV. As the Assassins Creed poster suggests, you&#39;re a fan of that series as well, with all of the games up to Black Flag taking up a centre spot on your shelf. Saying that, and noting Mirror&#39;s Edge, I&#39;d say you like parkour, or at least the idea of it. You&#39;re not like some gamers who prefer one type of game and you&#39;ve probably been playing games for a while, I can&#39;t remember when the Sam &amp; Max came out but it wasn&#39;t recently and its hard to get a physical copy of some of the older games now.<br> <br>A quick trip to Google suggests you&#39;re Polish, and as a final thing whatever is in the left leg of your desk you want to keep private.<br><br>That&#39;s what I see anyway.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br></p>

            <p>But thhe idea of an open world with the ability to do as you wish, especially if it means going against the rules (I also spotted Bully.)<br><br>Once you&#39;re before your computer you don&#39;t like moving too much (the bottle of water with the glass, and the spoon suggest this, unless they&#39;re needed for the medicaments nearby.)<br><br>You&#39;re also open-minded enough for trying things which are not your usual fix, even if you stumble upon them with a magazine (interrogation is valid deduction technic.)<br><br>You also seems to be rather orderly, judging by the way this desk is organized.</p>

My abductions are below:<br><br>Hand Deductions<br><br><b>#1</b> Was this from a sharp tool, such as scissors? The shape of the indent made me immediately think of scissors. Gardener? Possibly a tool from the garden, my other guess would be a cooking tool. Your hands look rather weathered and callused, making me infer that you may work with them often (hence the gardener conclusion). It&#39;s definitely an older wound, though, and most likely had scabbed at one point. <br><br><b>#2</b> This one appears to be a burn. The signs of the &quot;tightened&quot; skin, and red areas are the most clear out of all of them. However, that would be an odd place to burn your hand, which casts doubts onto the conclusion. (It would, however, support the idea that #1 was from a cooking tool - I&#39;m still unsure.) It also appears that you have a habit of picking at your wounds. <br><br><b>#3</b> Totally stumped me. I will, on occasion, get marks like those on my own thumb, and I still have no idea what caused them. However, the placement makes me think that the injury is maybe a paper cut, or even caused by another nail scraping against that area. Apart from that, though, I have no idea. <br><br><b>Other Abductions Include:</b> You are right handed, due to the fact that people tend to injure their dominant hand more often simply because they use it more. Is your computer old? The keyboard is rather reminiscent of a Dell that I used to own. Also, crumbs suggest that you may have had a snack at the computer. Are you a student? <br><br><b>Conclusion:</b> These were a lot of fun, but stay safe! Thank you for the lovely material to work with. :)<br><br>-Vee</p>

            <h1>1: Ivy was the only one to correctly guess this was caused by a cooking utensil, specifically a knife.  Every morning, one or two zookeepers go in three hours early to boil eggs and chop up everyone&#39;s fruits and vegetables for that day&#39;s feedings.  I get my turn at food prep every other Saturday.  Since there&#39;s a lot to do, it&#39;s very much a time limit to get as much as possible done before everyone else starts to arrive, not to mention getting our own routines started.  I . . . guess I didn&#39;t balance speed with caution very well that morning?  (I don&#39;t remember what I was cutting at the time.  Had to get back to work, so I just wrapped a paper towel around it with a rubber band and went back to chopping.)  It didn&#39;t come out very well in the picture, but the biggest clue is that the nail itself is also cut in line with the damage to my finger.  It was actually only about eight days old when I posted that photo; I think it just looks like a scab because all that loose skin had dried out and died.<br><br>#3 (because #2 is the most dramatic so I&#39;m saving it for last): Phobos was the only one who picked up on the skin damage around my nails.  While I used to be a nail biter/picker, that damage, as well as the thumb injury, were caused by steel wool.  My supervising zookeeper and I were just put in charge of a set of new building exhibits, and after switching out the previous day&#39;s food bowls for new food, we have to wash the dishes.  We also use them to clean out the water bowls.  After a few months, we both started getting nasty, painful cuts on our fingertips.  The thumb one was the freshest and most obvious at the time of the picture.  (We&#39;re still rather confused about this, as we&#39;ve both been using steel wool for years; I guess we just do it a lot more now?)  We switched the steel wool out for plastic scrubbers this week, which will hopefully solve the problem.  Fun fact: I actually seem to have developed an immunity to paper cuts, as I haven&#39;t gotten one in over a decade.  But maybe I&#39;ve just gotten really dexterous at handling paper?<br><br>#2: You all had interesting guesses for this one, and some of you who already knew I worked at a zoo brought up animal bites, but I see no one specifically connected this one to an attack.  Storme Hawk caught the bridge of skin between the two actual injuries; that is because you are actually looking at a pair of teeth marks!  You guys ever hear of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayra">tayras</a> before?  Our female is a little hell-raiser.  I thought I could get a towel around her upper body to move her safely into the outdoor section of their exhibit so I could hose out the inside portion, but Pandora snaked her head under her armpit and got me through the towel.  Oh, yes, that bite is through two layers of towel; good thing it was there, or it would have been much worse than just skinning two circles of skin off my hand . . . that, and the fact that Pandora is an older individual with worn-down teeth . . .<br><br>Other guesses:  Sorry, Iximaz, Ivy got my right-handedness correct.  Your logic was sound, though, since the left hand&#39;s injury was the only self-inflicted one.<br><br>What Storm thought was corrugated card on my desk is really a heat-resistant place mat for eating on.  The crumbs Ivy noted are from eating all my at-home meals at my desk.  (It&#39;s good to live alone!)<br><br>The callouses Phobos saw are indeed from lifting things at the zoo, mostly buckets, but less frequently bales of hay by the strings, which are probably the main source of the friction after all these years.  I can&#39;t make out any scar on my thumb, either in picture or in life, so I&#39;m not sure what you saw there.  I also don&#39;t remember what caused the milk spot.<br><br>And Ivy, my keyboard is indeed from a &#39;98 Dell, but the rest of my system is much newer.  I was too cheap to get a new keyboard when the current one is working fine.<br><br>—doctorlit has enjoyed this thoroughly, would love to do it again!</h1>

            <p>I&#39;ll get to the injuries in a moment, I want to talk about other things first.  Also, I don&#39;t mean any of this to be a judgement on you, if any of it comes off that way.<br><br>1) Clean and freshly clipped fingernails.  Evident from the clear straight lines (especially evident on your middle finger in picture one).  You are clearly not a nail biter, which rules that out as cause for the injuries.  However, I see that the skin around the nails bears signs of damage.  So, perhaps you pick at the skin.  Still, the minor injuries around the other nails doesn&#39;t match the larger injury, so I doubt they are related.<br><br>2) Discoloration on the fingers and pads of the hand.  Because of the cleanliness of the fingernails, I can say that the darkened patches are not dirt, but rather callouses.  These are hands that have seen some hard work.  Specifically, these are hands used to holding heavy loads by a strap or handle.  The direction of the callous (thicker closer to the palm, but resetting after each joint) says the skin was rubbed toward the finger tips.  I note that the injury in photo two is in line with the callouses on the other fingers, potentially making it a callous that wore off.<br><br>3) There is evidence of previous injury in photos one and three.  I note a small, smooth edged scar on the inside of the thumb in photo three.  Probably a small cut; likely from something pretty sharp.  The current wound is too shallow to be a cut, however, so the scar is likely unrelated.  In photo one, there are small abrasions on the sides of your fingers and also a milk spot, which is often caused by injury to the nail, on the ring finger&#39;s nail.<br><br>Conclusions:<br><br>Your hands have it pretty rough.  You work in a pretty physical job, which caused the callouses and injury in photo two.  You pick the skin around your nails, which likely led to the small injury in photo three.  The injury in photo one is the interesting one, for me.  It is beyond normal wear and tear.  I would suspect that that finger got pinched or caught in something, which ripped the skin away in that larger, almost blister-like area.<br><br>So, there you have it.  Was I close or was I totally off the mark?<br><br>-Phobos Holmes</p>

            <p>Analyzing the pictures, if those are the only three injuries on your hands I doubt it was self inflicted for three reasons 1) they&#39;re the only injuries on your hand, 2) they&#39;re placed all wrong for any tool I know of, unless the sharp edge of said tool inflicted the injuries (I&#39;ll explain that one later). 3) the injury on the little finger of your right hand, looking at it, it looks like one wound, but on inspection there is a bridge of skin between the two parts of the injury, given the pictures I doubt your hands have had that long to recover making it part of the healing process impossible (for now). <br><br>So picking up from 2), I noticed in the edge of the first picture there&#39;s some corrugated card with something resting on top of it, my guess would be that, due to the shape of the thing on the corrugated card and the size of the desk your computer stands upon, that you are into modelling of one thing or another, this suggests to me that the injuries are from a craft knife (or something similar) when you were trying to ether cut out or customize some sort of model. I&#39;m fairly certain I&#39;ve seen similar injuries on a friend who did that sort of thing. <br><br>My other guess would be in the vicinity of a rough encounter with some overenthusiastic ducks or swans or geese who thought your hand contained more bread than it did. <br><br>So, they are my guesses, they&#39;re probably completely wrong but, hey.</p>

            <p>Most of the deductions were pretty clear, and I was able to draw on my own personality (as my handwriting is a similar style).<br>The way I came to the conclusion that it was written during the day is that all your words are evenly spaced apart, none of the letters overlap, and the lines are very straight. I know from experience that there&#39;s no way (even with a light) my sleep-addled brain could write in a way that doesn&#39;t make a seven letter word look like it has three. Also, no words are crossed out. <br>What really gave it away was the straightness of the lines. At night, on paper without lines, there would be no way anyone could keep their words and lines so straight and parallel. <br>It was process of elimination from here - if it couldn&#39;t be night, it had to be daytime. <br>Glad you enjoyed it!<br><br>-Vee</p>

            <p>Specifically, I know that the minis for continuums are certainly going to be iconic creatures from a continuum, but how does one decide? Every continuum certainly has more than one popular creature, so how does someone who&#39;s creating a new mini look through the list and decide &quot;Yes, <i>this</i> creature will be the one to represent all the important misspelled words of this continuum from now on&quot;?<br><br>And what do you do in the rare chance where - well, let me see if I can explain. So, let&#39;s say the iconic creature of a continuum is dragons. However, the dragons are varied: there are fire dragons, ice dragons, poison dragons, etc. And all of these types of dragons are equally popular; there is no widely-held belief among the fans that the fire dragon is the most awesome. So in that case, would the mini <i>have</i> to be a specific type, or could you just say &quot;mini-dragon&quot; without further specification and let the dragon become a randomly-chosen type each time they are made?</p>

            <p>…either by the coordinators of the continuum-specific OFU or (if no such OFU exists) by the first person to write a mission for that continuum, as stated on the Mini <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini">wiki page</a>. How &quot;iconic&quot; the mini turns out to be is ultimately depends on the person creating it.<br><br>In the case you&#39;ve given regarding mini-dragons, I would argue for misspellings creating either a non-descript dragon or a dragon with a power somehow connected to whatever was misspelled. I would also argue that mini-dragons are a little generic, especially since there are also multiple canons that use mini-dragons or dragon-like creatures. But like I said before, it&#39;s up to the person creating it.</p>

            <p>For example (quoting the wiki), <i>Avatar: the Last Airbender/Avatar: Legend of Korra</i> minis vary depending on the nation of the misspelling. Air Nomads create mini-Sky Bisons, Water Tribals create mini-Unagi, Earth Kingdom subjects create mini-Badgermoles, Fire Nationals create mini-Fire Dragons, and Republic City-related people and events create mini-Fire Ferrets. Unaffiliated or miscellaneous minis take the form of mini-Flying Lemurs, and all minis default to this form when sent to the Official Fanfiction University of Avatar: the Last Airbender.</p>

            <p>It seems that species names seem to be the same name as the planet and nationality.  I don&#39;t capitalize human or cat, but to use hat planet naming conventions, we would be Terrans and the cats would be called Terran felines.  Or would it be Terran Cat?</p>

            <p>Species names are typically not capitalized, but names of distinct societies are. Thus, we speak of humans, and also Americans, Latinos, Muslims, etc; and we speak of cats, but never Cats. At least on this planet.<br><br>Similarly, in the Tolkienverse, we may speak of elves or Elves, hobbits or Hobbits, men or Men. Or Noldor, or Nъmenуreans, or Shirefolk, etc.<br><br>Sci-fi does tend to default to capitalization, and in the case of would-be utopian futures like <i>Star Trek</i>, that&#39;s because there&#39;s this conceit that in the far future each world learns to live and function together as one whole society, so there&#39;s an excuse for Terrans always being Terrans and Klingons always being Klingons. There may be divisions within each society, but when you&#39;re discussing Terran dealings with Klingons, the broadest categories tend to be the most important. It doesn&#39;t matter to the Klingons that Captain Kirk is an Iowan; it matters that he&#39;s a member of Starfleet and a Terran. Hence, caps.<br><br>However, as far as I know, cats are still just cats.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>If you mean can you have stories for both prompts in the same document, I&#39;m pretty sure the answer is &#39;yes, just make sure it&#39;s clear where each one starts&#39;. On the other hand, looking at your wording and the doc makes me think you meant &#39;can I write one story using both prompts&#39;, which...is a pretty neat idea, though I have no idea if that&#39;s an okay/done thing or not. Someone else want to clarify? Do we even have an answer for this yet?<br><br>A Bit of Light Betaing (because I noticed some things but don&#39;t actually have much free time right now):<br><br>In terms of the actual story, which I glanced through a very little bit (okay, I mainly read through the ending for some reason): I see you have a Klingon in there. That&#39;s cool! Is the Klingon meant to be a particular Klingon (I believe there are only two currently identified as agents--Morgan&#39;s former partner, and Kozar)? Or is he a new one? Either way, he needs a capital letter on &#39;Klingon&#39; (see <a href="http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Klingon%22">Memory Alpha</a> for how it&#39;s used--which is quite simple: just capitalize it!--and for more information on Klingons).<br><br>Speaking of more information on Klingons: what September says to him? That should get her a *very* angry Klingon, not a Klingon who gets distracted by the ball of whatever it is (do I...want to know? My current guess is &#39;horse dung&#39;, except...from the centaur? Which sounds like a slur against centaurs, but...)<br><br>And, of course, speaking of the ball and the interaction with the Klingon and everything: it seems...kind of nonsensical. Even leaving aside the Klingon not really reacting to the insult apart from stomping over, I don&#39;t understand what the ball is, why it&#39;s there, what the Klingon knows about it (or why he should care), and, perhaps most importantly, why the Klingon feels so urgently responsible for it that it&#39;s the only thing he focuses on.<br><br>Also: er, would a Babysitters Club character really swear like that? I was under the impression they didn&#39;t really do that in those books, though my knowledge admittedly comes from the first few Snark Squad reviews of the books and not from reading them myself. Also: Babysitters, no apostrophe. There&#39;s some ridiculous reason in one of the first few books.<br><br>One more small thing: Kelly says she comes from a &quot;Ben 10 Men In Black crossover.&quot; Crossovers are generally denoted by either an x (as in Ben 10 x Men in Black) or a slash (as in Ben 10/Men in Black). As well, titles of movies, TV shows, books, magazines, and so on (probably games as well) are usually italicized, giving us &quot;<i>Ben 10/Men in Black</i> crossover.&quot; And, lastly, Men in Black <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119654/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">doesn&#39;t have &#39;in&#39; capitalized</a>, according to iMDB and grammar rules. (Similarly, <i>Star Trek</i> has no hyphen and gets italicized.)<br><br>...and one last thing: I don&#39;t see any mention of which prompts you&#39;ve used, and I can&#39;t really guess (partly because I don&#39;t exactly have them all memorized). So: which prompts have you used? And might I suggest putting them somewhere visible in the doc, either before or after the story text?<br><br>Hope that helps a little.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Based on Iximaz&#39;s and Desdendelle&#39;s advice, I stopped reading the prompts and just hoped I hit some by accident.  I went with random wackiness because someone else complained that I could name a lot of wacky things but didn&#39;t have my team do any of them.<br><br>Thanks for clearing up my research failures on the spellings.<br><br>The ball is an idiot ball.  <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall</a></a>  I&#39;ll see about adding an explanation earlier in the scene.  I got a little clumsy about whether or not Kelly would recognize one on sight.<br><br>I see your point about Klingons.  (And it was just a random alien with a distinct appearance.)  I was thinking Worf, who has a lot more restraint than your typical Klingon.  I&#39;ll try to keep B&#39;Elanna Torres in mind as someone who grew up in the culture.  (Great, now I want to write about Worf&#39;s childhood.)<br><br>Babysitters Club, the short answer is that September is college-age and had never heard of the Babysitters Club before she came to the PPC.  She is still out of character when she yells that.<br><br>I consider any book that&#39;s supposed to be set in the Real World ends up as a World One variation with its own number.  (I just want someone who came from World One while avoiding having someone from World One.)  I almost wanted September to be from 2016 in a space-opera universe, but I couldn&#39;t remember which ones assumed that we would have colonies on the moon by now, or other significant changes to make Earth different than reality.  SeaQuest was supposed to be set in 2017, I think.</p>

            <p>Kelly Stone is a human from a Ben 10 MIB crossover.  She worked for a bunch of aliens who had an exorcism business.  It was a scam because they would set up the hauntings.<br><br>She had polarized reading glasses which would prevent neuralysation.  I would like for her to be able to keep the uncanonical technology.<br><br>Kelly has a mean streak, but mostly it should be directed towards Sues and badfic.  Most of her moods are defined by how irritated she is.  Almost nothing really surprises her.  If she says &quot;good job&quot; and means it, she&#39;s actually really impressed.<br><br>Kelly is very picky about what she eats and drinks.  She also hates getting substances on her, but getting muddy is considered highly annoying instead of something to freak out about.  She prefers to keep her RC and equipment neat and tidy.  This is not OCD, it&#39;s just recognizing that keeping things organized makes life easier.<br><br>Kelly is good at predicting what will go wrong and avoiding it.  She has an almost obsession with the Ironic Overpower, which means that not having the worst thing try to happen is slightly disturbing for her.<br><br><br>------------------------<br><br>September Johnson came from an artist colony.  The ideal personality type was Manic Pixie Dreamgirl.  Since September was a more down-to-earth type, she was a bit of an outcast.  She&#39;s also shy.  She doesn&#39;t seem to have any special artistic talent.  She would have been good at science if she had been encouraged to pursue it as a child.  She loves science fiction.<br><br>----------------------<br><br>Tom had to leave the field because he couldn&#39;t control his non-specific mental problem when he doesn&#39;t get enough sleep.<br><br>------------------------<br><br>I hated writing the Orkan.

            <p>My sincerest apologies that this took forever. My thoughts, overall, are positive, and I enjoyed your characters. Here goes:<br><br>-I don&#39;t belief there needs to be a hyphen in &quot;scuff marks.&quot; <br>-The transition between the following two sentences seems a bit abrupt. <i>She then glanced at the console and wondered why it hadn&#39;t started to beep. That&#39;s when she noticed the message.</i> How large is this message? Is it paper? Is it digital? How far away from the console is Kelly? A bit more description would make this bit more balanced. <br>-Should &quot;zavronians&quot; be capital? <br>-I believe &quot;words&quot; should be capital, as I&#39;ve always seen it capitalised before.<br>-In the sentence <i>“Na-Nu Na-Nu!&quot;</i> should the second <i>&quot;Na-Nu&quot;</i> be capital? <br>-The sentence <i>She un-literally ran into her old acquaintance.</i> is a bit strange. Did they just happen to be in the same hallway? I was a bit confused. By the context, Tom appears to be a janitor. Perhaps a small description of Tom would be nice? <br>- <i>“Close your eyes and think about Dumbo.”  Tom said.</i> Grammar! Quick fix. &quot;Close your eyes and think about Dumbo,&quot; Tom said.<br>-Tom is actually really interesting. I&#39;m intrigued. <br>-Can someone &quot;lightly bang&quot; into the wall? I&#39;m not sure that that description fits.<br>- <i>“The co-ed showers are nicer than the guy ones, I don&#39;t know how the girl ones are.&quot;</i> There should be a semicolon where there is a comma.<br>- I believe &quot;generic surface&quot; should be capitalised.<br>- Who is Larry? Is that a typo? <br>- Is there another scene after Kelly returns from her shower that makes her head to the Marquis de Sod? Or did she head there right after she shower? It is unclear.<br>- How can a speech be blasted? That confused me a bit, though I&#39;m probably missing something. <br>My final question is this: there is more, correct? It feels a bit unfinished at the moment.</p>

            <p>Well, something needs to be done, and I&#39;ve never seen a Hunger Games badfic sporked... I will say this though. My &quot;agents&quot;, er, agent concepts, are currently rather thought-through, if that makes any sense. However they are not canon and won&#39;t be for a reasonable amount of time. I might get Permission eventually, but at this point in time I feel pretty comfortable just lurking around. </p>

            <p>The shortest badfic ever sporked (<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10497739/1/Rose-cuts-the-doctors-penis-off-and-puts-it-in-a-sock">this</a> — <b>NSFW &amp; NSFB!</b>) clocks at 138 words, which are a couple of sentences. Usually, stuff that&#39;s too short gets passed over because there&#39;s not enough material to actually spork. That amount, however, changes from person to person.<br>Looking at the fic linked above, it is a bit less than 6,000 words; that&#39;s plenty for a shortish mission &amp;dmash; that&#39;s hS&#39; cutoff for <i>Driftwood</i>, and <i>Driftwood</i> makes for an excellent example of a PPC... spinoff? series? in my opinion.<br>So yeah, that fic is long enough.</p>

            <p>I just got back from the Thursday night showing of the new Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice movie. I liked it a lot, though it definitely shared many of the same Dark Knight series pitfalls, it wasn&#39;t as awful as Man of Steel.<br><br>THE GOOD<br>Gal Gadot -- I do not lie when I say that every moment she is on the screen, the movie instantly improves. Wonder Woman is perfect and fantastic, there was no heavy handed romance with her, and she kicked major butt.<br>Shirtlessness -- I&#39;m sure that rippling muscles (or Lois Lane in a bathtub) appeals to a varied audience.<br><br>THE BAD (SWEARING)<br>Where the ... were my five Robins? I demand a true dawn of justice.<br>The action, when Gal was not there to break it up/make it better, felt like it dragged on a little bit.<br>The senator from Kentucky (a democrat who went to UofL) had the wrong accent and that really ruined all of her scenes for me.<br>Lex Luthor was played up a little to much for my tastes. I might just be used to a Smallville Lex but Eisenberg&#39;s portrayal strayed into Jared Leto as an Edgy Joker territory. <br><br>THE WEIRD<br>What was up with that time travel thing because that ruined the pacing of the movie and might have been far better as an after-credit scene.<br>Superman is not dead. No comic book death is sacred/meaningful, as proven BY SUPERMAN. Historically, Superman is the first big superhero to die in comics. Historically, he&#39;s the first to come back to life after dying. So Superman dying is the worst fake-out ever because they played it up enough with the nuke.<br><br>Does anyone else have any thoughts?</p>

            <p>I mean, I probably should go and see it, just to see if its as much of a car crash as it&#39;s been made out to be (spoilers: the answer is almost certainly yes), but I read The Dark Knight Returns and everything about it just made me dry-heave. I <i>despise</i> that conceit, and I equally despise the idea of Batman as some kind of super genius planner (if he&#39;s that brilliant, why doesn&#39;t he have plans in place to keep his rogues&#39; gallery in their various mental institutions) and the one we&#39;re supposed to root for because he&#39;s not Superman. It shows a total misunderstanding of what Superman is (IMO, YMMV) <i>supposed</i> to be - someone to aspire towards, someone who is great and through their greatness allows us to be more. Batman is not some kind of populist hero. Batman is the exact antithesis of a populist hero. He&#39;s an immensely wealthy private individual with a penchant for dressing in spandex and a hateboner for the poor (odd that he doesn&#39;t really go after corporate criminals but instead gangbangers who have precious little else in their lives). And that&#39;s okay. There&#39;s a lot you can do with that character. I just hate how he&#39;s been morphed into this unstoppable, overprepared mope machine purely because he&#39;s popular and hangs around with the Justice League.<br><br>The Dark Knight Returns purported to pitch human against superhuman, Earth against Krypton, mental strength against physical power. What we got was Batman dressing up as a knockoff Space Marine punching Superman in the face. It&#39;s garbage. Compare his anti-Supes suit with the Marvel version: Tony Stark&#39;s Hulkbuster armour. The key difference is that the Hulkbuster suits don&#39;t work particularly well and are largely there as a precautionary measure - the Hulk doesn&#39;t have a lot of control, and it <i>should</i> help lower the collateral damage until Banner comes back. Batman has his suit because he doesn&#39;t trust Superman, because he doesn&#39;t trust anyone, because he&#39;s an ungodly wealthy sociopath wallowing in the only real tragedy to ever cross his life. Plus, throw in Lex Luthor as an industrialist trying to persuade him that Superman&#39;s a menace when Superman keeps fighting him should give a supposedly sane and smart person at least a little pause. But no, we get Batman versus Superman: Dawn of The Dark Knight Returns to the Death of Superman and/or Justice. Christ.<br><br>I&#39;ll take it as read that Gal Gadot&#39;s scenes are good - Zack Snyder can do precisely one thing well, which is shoot conventionally attractive women in fetishy outfits beating nine kinds of hell out of CGI monsters, and he does it <i>really</i> well - but one does have to wonder what she&#39;s been given to work with by him. He, er, doesn&#39;t exactly have the strongest track record with women in his work. Just look at <i>Sucker Punch</i>. Or, er, don&#39;t. That is also an option. As Bob Chipman put it, his film aesthetic is &quot;somewhere between Alex Ross and some guy who airbrushes dragons and wizards onto the sides of panel vans in southern California&quot;, and the sexual politics of his movies are skin-crawlingly bad at times.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I want this to be good. I want more good movies in my life. I just... don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be. The bar is low, and I fully expect Snyder and company to see it practically on the ground, share a meaningful glance, and go off to look for some shovels.</p>

            <p>In case you didn&#39;t notice I disappeared sometime around last May/June/July time because of exams, and then I thought I&#39;d be back. That wasn&#39;t the case as I failed Statistics (badly) and thus had to spend the entire summer re-learning an entire year&#39;s worth of Statistics (and when you&#39;re second year at uni it&#39;s quite hard stuff), most of which I hadn&#39;t really revises before the exam the first time round (who&#39;d of thought that was a bad idea?). Anyway, also over the summer I was officially diagnosed with ADHD (technically ADD, but they don&#39;t separate them anymore) and then I was launched straight into my final year of Uni, which (so far) has been my best year of uni yet (beside the aforementioned blood and sweat, Ultimate Frisbee has injured me more than anything else in my life).<br><br>But hey, I&#39;ve now got free time in my schedule and I figured I&#39;d come back to the PPC and start trying to do some original writing again (as if a 6-8k dissertation and a 2.5k essay weren&#39;t enough). So, yeah, hello once again to all the people who are still here from before I left, and hello for the first time to those who have joined since. <br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

For the next 1-3 turns. Every time you get hit by a physical contact move. On a mon like Mamoswine, it&#39;s brilliant, since it has a high Attack stat. To get the most out of it, get an Adamant one and train it in Attack and Speed, with the last points in HP. For moves, you&#39;ll want Ice Shard, Icicle Crash, Earthquake, and Knock Off, then just chuck it out and let &#39;er rip!

            <p>This is the post I was going to make on Friday. Then I was going to do it Saturday morning. Then I was going to do it on Monday, and then Tuesday morning - anything to avoid conflicting with Wednesday Pluggage.<br><br>Well, as it turns out, I don&#39;t have anything to actually plug this week, so you get this one after all. <sup>_<sup><br><br>~<br><br>Over</sup></sup> the years, I&#39;ve built up a library of random skills, and it&#39;s inevitable that I&#39;ve occasionally used them to make fandom-y things. Nothing on the scale of Iximaz&#39;s costumes, but I think I&#39;ve created a few pretty cool things. <sup>_^</sup> I figured now is as good a time as any to show them off. So without further ado:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/faampc5.jpg"><br><br>This is the oldest one (the others are all less than three years old I think), and probably the prettiest. Two Trees of Valinor candle holder! The Trees do get a bit hot when the candle is lit, but once I shuffled a branch out of the way it wasn&#39;t too bad.<br><br>It would be remiss of me not to mention that the design and about half of the work on the Trees was done by Kaitlyn. She&#39;s pretty amazing that way. <sup>_<sup><br><br>&lt;img</sup></sup> src=&quot;<a href="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/458810ab-6998-44d5-957b-a1f770d44fc7.jpg%22%3E">http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/458810ab-6998-44d5-957b-a1f770d44fc7.jpg&quot;&gt;</a><br><br>Young Wizards! As a person with a head for poetry, it was probably inevitable that I&#39;d collate all the bits of the Song of the Twelve that we see in <i>Deep Wizardry</i>. Putting together a scroll was hard work, but I love the finished product. (The fact that I got to shove extra text into the margins was a bonus!)<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/faampc6.jpg"><br><br>This key board hangs by my front door; I don&#39;t often need to get any of them down. <sup>_^</sup> The Unstable Larder is a reference to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12S1gCB80tCwBKnBlAq6YcvX1lRWCwjLrqfWrTFedR-4/pub">2015 Canterbury Gathering</a>; the Hatchery is dual-labelled using the <i>Dinotopia</i> script.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/94117816-bb8c-49da-92fa-0baf5087bf6a.jpg"><br><br>I&#39;ve actually posted these before: Pernese quarter and eighth Marks, from the Harper Hall. I made a rough draft of these to practice for my <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Revu">Plort coins</a>, but these ones follow the pattern in the Dragonlover&#39;s Guide more closely.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/010d29aa-b665-4dde-8a4b-4832d4de565b.jpg"><br><br>Did you know my wife is two different types of wizard? It&#39;s true! She&#39;s taken the Oath, but she also has a hand-made <i>Harry Potter</i> wand. It&#39;s about 8 inches and pine, which apparently means she&#39;s a mysterious loner who can use creative magic and live a long time. Fun!<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/faampc4.jpg"><br><br>The big finale... yeah, I have a massive Circular Gallifreyan inscription on my wall. <sup>_^</sup> All designed and written out by hand, this thing took ages (mostly because I took a year or so out in the middle), but it&#39;s gorgeous.<br><br>So that&#39;s me, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one. Don&#39;t just reply to say how cool I am (though, y&#39;know, a little of that is always welcome <sup>_~)</sup> - show us what <i>you&#39;ve</i> made, too!<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kk8hdVlNMRSPti5OJniHTI-R0ceP-cBlggX8j3nlxl4/edit?usp=sharing">hS</a><br><font size="1">Last time, I swear.</font></p>

It is made of faux-crushed velvet (very stretchy) and some kind of satiny fabric (very slick).  The hood is velvet inside and out, the satin lines the inside of the rest.  There is also a gold knot-work closure.<br><br>When I asked for photos of the cloak, Nesh pulled an entire costume out of the closet.  Here is a better look at both the cloak and the rest of the costume.<br><br><img src="http://i60.photobucket.com/albums/h27/diceanddagger/Cloak6.jpg"><br><br>Next time, I would make sure to only have one difficult fabric, the combination of stretchy on slick was a major pain.

            <p>I vaguely remember, back when I first joined PPC in late 2014, there being a discussion about whether badfic comics (i.e. How I Became Yours) should be sporked through comics. I don&#39;t think this question was ever really resolved and How I Became Yours ended up being a normally written image with pictures from the comic instead of quotes as from a regular fic. <br>But my real question is, could all of an author&#39;s missions be in comic format? Has this been tried before in any seriousness?</p>

            <p>That ultimately depends on the author and the amount of effort they are willing to spend. Creating comics is a more complicated process than just writing a story and illustrating it. Pacing is different. Dialogue is different. Action is different. The whole thing is closer to a script than a conventional story. You&#39;re more than willing to try making all your stories as comics, but be aware that it&#39;s going to be a tricky thing.</p>

            <p>I think when I was studying dream journals, it said to write down &quot;anything&quot; when you wake up in the morning.

            <p>... in my experience, at least, is to be woken up in the middle of them. For this, small children are ideal, but in the absence of those, it&#39;s possible to achieve the same effect electronically.<br><br>What you do is, you set yourself two or three alarms for utterly random times of the night. For best results, find an alarm that starts off quietly - the level of someone stirring in the next room - but after about a minute, ramps up to ear-shattering volume. After a week or two of dealing with those, you won&#39;t <i>need</i> the alarm any more - you&#39;ll wake up to every single sound in your house!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>This reminds me of <a href="http://uproxx.com/gammasquad/my-little-pony-resume/">the infamous MLP resume</a> that cropped up on the Internet a while ago. Only, well, resumes can be ignored, but you were actually supposed to do this assignment and wade through all the (presumably awful) OCs within. Blech.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t help that I&#39;ve never particularly liked Spongebob, especially not after the sheer amount of marketing related to that show. IT&#39;S EVERYWHERE. Gods, I feel that Frozen, Minions, and freaking Shrek look tame in comparison.</p>

            <p>It wasn&#39;t particularly horrible, after I became desensitized from it. It was draining at first, tough. For example:<br><br>&quot;4.

            <p>What a fun mission! I&#39;m glad to see that HTTYD is getting some fan fiction justice. I did notice one error during the scene where Toothless is watching his food with a love-sick expression.

            <p>Not that I&#39;m feeling particularly rant-y myself, but I don&#39;t see how so much as mentioning past events sets off the Sue-tracker. Plus, how many Sues have you ever seen to visit a shrink? I&#39;m pretty sure that would count as negative Suedom points.<br><br>... Or, wait, did it go off because she was <i>refusing</i> to go, as though her history is so much weirder than all the other weird shit that&#39;s happened in/around HQ (and to Jenni, for that matter)? That might make sense. Reading it again, it&#39;s not specified exactly what set it off.<br><br>That aside, nice mission. {= ) I&#39;m glad there&#39;s another HtTYD one, and wow, that fic sounds just about as dumb as &quot;The Girl and Her Dragon.&quot; Blech. Gall and Derik send their condolences. Normally they&#39;d offer a gift of alcohol, but under the circumstances, would your agents accept a flask of Monstrous Nightmare gel? It can be used for destruction, rather like napalm, but it also makes for great torches. Dead useful, really. (I had the thought that Gall might makes some money selling the stuff to Leto Haven in exchange for Dragon Chow and whatnot. It was probably Derik&#39;s idea.)<br><br>Best line: <i>“You don’t have enough badges to train me!”</i> Too bad Ave was too startled to get the joke.<br><br>A few typos:<br><br><i>She wrapped <b>his</b> arms around her jaws, struggling to keep them clamped firmly shut.</i><br><br>Her arms, surely?<br><br><i>“Right, Nightshade,” he panted, “also known <b>a</b> Sue Dragon&quot;</i><br><br>As.<br><br><i>“What happened to ‘don’t talk about the fish thing?”</i><br><br>Missing a closing single-quote.<br><br>And... that&#39;s my two cents.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I was thinking it was more going off because she was going &quot;Wah I&#39;m such a Sue I can&#39;t talk about things because I&#39;m a Sue, angstangstangstangst—&quot; So... she&#39;s angsting about turning into a Sue, and that&#39;s what&#39;s causing the tracker to let her know &#39;hey, knock it off.&#39; *shrugs*<br><br><i>“And on top of that she understands trees and reads auras to boot.

            <p>She&#39;s Suvian in no small part because she thinks she&#39;s a Sue, a way of thinking only reinforced by this tracker (I must be a Sue since I have a Sue tracker). When the thing warns her about it, the fact it does not indicate why it beeps only leads her to think she&#39;s right, continuing a vicious circle.

            <p>So I doubt if anyone would recognise me, but I used to frequent here a lot a year or two ago. Or maybe it was three? I don&#39;t really remember. Either way, I rediscovered this place and decided I might as well reappear and say hello. It&#39;s kind of nice to be back!<br><br>I&#39;ve changed a lot since I was last here, and some (most? all?) of you probably won&#39;t recognise me, so I&#39;m just going to start over and reintroduce myself:<br><br>Hey! I&#39;m Himochi, though you can call me Mochi for short. She/they pronouns. I&#39;m currently in my first year of university, studying Computer Science. When I&#39;m not dragging myself to lectures at ungodly hours or writing too many essays, I spend my time reading (duh), playing games or watching videos online. I&#39;m somewhat addicted to virtual pet websites, and I co-own and moderate a vanilla Minecraft server. I also play online homebrew tabletop games on the weekend.<br><br>I&#39;m into a lot of things currently, including, but not limited to Rooster Teeth/Achievement Hunter, Red vs Blue, Dragon Age, Dark Souls, Undertale and my latest craze, Stardew Valley. I&#39;m still into pretty much all genres of everything, so I&#39;m not too fussy with what I&#39;ll get into, and will often read fics from fandoms I&#39;m not a part of out of curiosity.<br><br>You may notice I have a habit of over-explaining things. I tend to use 50 words where 5 would work, so I get kind of long-winded. I think it&#39;s because I don&#39;t want people to misunderstand what I&#39;m saying, but I&#39;ll try and cut it down a bit, for your sakes.<br><br>I&#39;m going to spend a little while to reacquaint myself with the canon of the PPC, reread the older series, etc. before I start being too active - don&#39;t wanna make some kind of newbie mistake! Feel free to point me in the direction of any particularly interesting fics, but please, no legendary badfics - I&#39;m not a <i>complete</i> rookie. ;D<br><br>TL;DR: Hi, I&#39;ve returned here after a few years of inactivity and am getting back into the community. Send me some sporkings or something.</p>

            <p>I did not expect a nickname, and will say it was a pleasant surprise! Chocolate is good, isn&#39;t it? Chocolate and a PPC mission is a good ending to any day. <br>I&#39;m a bit curious, as I didn&#39;t know you before. What are your fandoms, and do you have any missions I could read? Of course, the most important question comes last - milk or dark chocolate?</p>

            <p>My one speciality is coming up with nicknames - especially obscure ones, or ones that don&#39;t seem linked at first.<br><br>I was missing for a while, so I wouldn&#39;t blame you for not recognising me. My fandoms are many and varied, though right now I&#39;m fond of Stardew Valley, Pokйmon, Dragon Age and Dark Souls.<br><br>I never applied for permission because I&#39;m not too confident in my own writing skills, so I have no missions. I mostly just linked badfics! :D<br><br>Dark chocolate is my favourite for sure. Milk (and especially white) are just too sweet sometimes? Although I do enjoy milk a lot too.</p>

            <p>Judging by the reference to the fishcakes and the nicknames, I think it is. Many thanks - I&#39;d never thought of Djinn, and I like it quite a bit.

            <p>Ever heard of LISA: THE PAINFUL? <br>It&#39;s got that whole Earthbound inspiration thing. Similar graphics, rpg gameplay, quirky comedy mixed in with sort of sad themes. <br>Just imagine all the depressing themes turned up to eleven. <br><br>It&#39;s one of the funniest and most horrifyingly depressing things I&#39;ve played in my entire life. <br>I&#39;ve never seen mood whiplash pulled off so well. <br>Real mature stuff, I oughta warn. <br>It&#39;s probably not as horrifying as the concept might have you think (an apocalyptic world where women have disappeared, involving the last woman alive,) but, I mean, still.

This in mind, you&#39;re going to want to go all in on damage.

            <p>Not a single quote, but a whole dialog.<br><br>&quot;You claimed to create God. You realize that God created the universe, right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Duh.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And you&#39;re part of the universe, so God created you, right?&quot;<br><br>She nodded.<br><br>&quot;But you created God. You&#39;re the Mother of God—and don&#39;t give me any BS about a physical incarnation. You gave birth to God&#39;s &#39;true form&#39;. She said so, remember? So, how could God create the universe, and yourself, if she didn&#39;t exist yet?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I . . . she . . . what?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You heard me. Explain how you can exist if God created the universe, but you only now created God.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I create God, then God creates the universe at the beginning of time and creates me so I can create her! It&#39;s a stable time loop!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wrong! If Elaine is present at the beginning of the universe, that negates the causality loop requiring her to be born now. If she&#39;s already there at the beginning of time, she doesn&#39;t lie dormant &#39;waiting for the perfect match to find each other&#39;. If that doesn&#39;t happen, you don&#39;t give birth to her. If you don&#39;t give birth to her, she doesn&#39;t exist, and neither do you. The loop collapses, and you—both of you—cease to be.&quot;<br><br>The two looked at each other.<br><br>&quot;Oh dear,&quot; said Rachel.<br><br>&quot;I hadn&#39;t thought of that,&quot; said Elaine.<br><br>Both of them promptly vanished in a puff of logic.<br><br>Supernumerary, killing glitterbags and &#39;gods&#39; with logic.<br><br>And for bonus points, the first part of it:<br><br><br>&quot;Shut up! You&#39;ve played the helpless victim card so hard I doubt you could even touch me.&quot; And then inspiration struck, and he grinned. &quot;In fact, I know you can&#39;t. You just gave birth. It&#39;s taken a lot out of you. You&#39;re in a lot of pain, and your muscles are about as useful as cooked spaghetti right now.&quot;<br><br>And it was true. The world received its instructions and, because they were spoken with conviction and made perfect sense, took them to heart.</p>
