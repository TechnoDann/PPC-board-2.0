            <p>Welcome, &amp;c. Having read the Original Series, you should also read the Constitution — it&#39;s the set of rules this Board goes by.

            <p>I was going to go even further: why don't we use T-Board in place of the Other Board <i>all</i> the time? It would be an excellent long-term stress test, and if it goes down or shows problems, it'd be good to know what they are.</p>

            <p>However, I saw more moments when the Board couldn't be accessed. It lasted for a short time, so we cannot really talk about shutdowns in these occasions.

            <p>So, when Matt posted on the Board about the Canons knowing about PPC, I asked some questions about specific characters. Now, I don't do this for the sake of 'speshulness' but because it feels logic to me. It will also have to be adressed when I begin to write missions inside these characters' verses (Something I already started with my first mission, still in writing.). Sorry if I look obnoxious or anything, but I would like to have the opinion of the people who could read my post about it before the shutdown. If you want I repeat my opinions and arguments here I'd be glad to do it.</p>

            <p>Dresden Files: The Archive, a young girl (during the series) with perfect knowledge of anything ever written in her mind, plus memories of precedents Archives. Would know about PPC the very moment a charge list is written. It's the 1488th thing not allowed inside PPC, but I remembered after beginning writing. Besides, that also means instant knowledge of any DF canon material used for exorcisms, so... She can 'erase' knowledge which only remains inside this mind, but I guess PPC awareness would have slipped off.</p>

<p>Persona: Velvet Room, a construct room inside the Collective Uncoscious of mankind, but linked to the protagonist(s)' minds. Unique to each person, attendants included. Only constant person, Igor, personified Creepy Good serving the embodiement of the good inside mankind. These people have an inisde's vew on the protagonist(s)' mind, and know when something don't have the complete psyche needed for a Persona. And to quote them: "Nothing happens inside the Velvet Room without any reason." Would know that glitterbags inside the Room aren't up to no good, and see through SEP Fields, since it's their own pocket dimension. I think they could still be neuralized, though.</p>

<p>Bonus content: Personaverse's 'gods', embodiement of a one thought of mankind, like grief or desire to die. Your opinion.</p>

            <p>Ivy (who's not that young these days) knows anything that gets written down - but that doesn't mean she knows its significance. I don't think the following would mean anything to her, let alone revealing the inner workings of the PPC:</p>

<p><i>-Bad grammar.<br>
-No concept of spelling.<br>
-Throwing Dresden OOC.<br>
-REALLY bad grammar.</i></p>

<p>She might notice anything that talked about characters she knows, and send a message to them - but by the time it got there, the mission would have ended and the whole Word World would've folded back into the main canon.</p>

<p>Knowing about canon material is a good point, though. That would have to be dealt with by either:</p>

<p>-Invoking the SEP field - this is a pretty valid use of it.<br>
-Invoking 'characters forget the story after it's over' and just ignoring her when she's not in the story - it's not like she's going to come after you!<br>
-Hunting her down and neuralysing her, after taking the books away.<br>
-Not taking books into canon. There's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jFddeA6xDGWo5vJxDvOUep_LPJIzrmgZ5EwUUzFj8jg/pub">other types of exorcism</a>, y'know.</p>

            <p>Lady Iximaz finished reading the scroll that had been delivered earlier that day and set it aside, drumming her fingers on the desk.<br><br>&quot;What is it?&quot; her brother, Foon, asked. He was leaning against the desk, propped up on his elbow, and playing with one of her quills. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me we&#39;re going to have to cancel riding.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, we can still go. It&#39;s just...&quot; Lady Iximaz sighed and began pushing the scroll around her desk. &quot;I hate to speak ill of my peers, but to be frank, the Eagleshadow has been more concerned with extending his influence than asserting his power as Ozerbord&#39;s protector. But it would appear as though his role as such has been usurped by Sir Tomash.&quot;<br><br>Foon&#39;s eyes went wide. &quot;Wait, what?! When?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Just yesterday, it would seem.&quot; Lady Iximaz stood, smoothing down her rumpled tunic. &quot;That would at least explain the sudden disappearance of the Inter&#39;Nelerors. Sir Tomash has found a way to drive them off.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s... a little worrisome, actually,&quot; Foon replied, frowning. &quot;What sort of man is he to wield such power?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A man like any other,&quot; Lady Iximaz said, shrugging. &quot;And you&#39;re not the one to talk, O Great and Powerful Sorcerer.&quot;<br><br>Foon shrugged. &quot;You saw what happened when I tried to fight the beasts.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Inter&#39;Nelerors are but one threat,&quot; Lady Iximaz said calmly. &quot;But come, let us not darken your Name Day with such thoughts. We shall go riding together, and when we return, the cook will have prepared a hearty dinner for us. Tomorrow, I will visit Baron Huinesoron.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t envy you,&quot; Foon said under his breath as his sister strode out the door. He sighed and followed after her.</p>

            <p>Trod the refugees.<br><br>There were always victims of any incursion, driven from their homes by the ravages of the Inter&#39;Nelerors, sent from the stark, bleak landscapes of Ozerbord through the Pass of the Five to walk amongst the rich lands by the O-Road. Many dropped off along the way, tinkering and plying their trade, telling the stories of the northwest townships to new and eager ears. Some stayed. Some didn&#39;t.<br><br>Through the city of Odolotos, leaving some behind, the trains of refugees trudged wearily, but they were close. Critta-Kalthin was near, and the raids of the Baroness Iximaz had reached beyond the Wattufs, Permeshuns, and Batvegs. They were young men, mostly, eager for glory, eager to fight against a foe they could actually best. Not for them a life in the fields, scratching a living from the harsh soil; these were the dreamers and thinkers and would-be heroes of a new age. And when they got there, they could be of use to the Baroness... and her strange, crow-like maidservant, who smiled a crooked, grey-toothed smile <i>all the time</i>.<br><br>Oh, the Inter&#39;Nelerors had hit Borrd hard, that much was clear from the number of nervous-looking rookie guards pointing bows or wands aloft, eyes always watching the skies above, ears pricked for a wingbeat. But the seas were safer, and felt safer, and the trade barges out of the Critta Gap were always eager for more hands on deck. The braver ones got recruited into the Rangers, taking the green as it was called, and hunted Sues from horseback when the Baron went a-raiding, the clever ones learned magic, and the <i>really</i> clever ones did both. But sometimes, the grubby, down-at-heel beggars among the refugees were recruited, such as the skinny, head-touched boy who called himself Earl and talked to trees like they were men, by that smiling vizier, and that was because they were dangerous.<br><br>He&#39;d come with a bodyguard-cum-carer, a dwarf woman with a magical, spark-spitting crossbow, from out of the shot-blasted ruins of his home in Ozerbord. A simple lad, but his clothes were oddly courtly and he spoke well, and where he went an old magic went with him. And what he said, as he looked into the water, made the smiling old beggar smile all the wider.<br><br>She sprinted back to Castle De&#39;endee, the lad lollygagging behind and the dwarf wheezing as she tried to keep up with the Big Folk&#39;s long-leggitty strides, and scrabbled down the stairs to her private quarters in the dungeons. There waited a motley gathering, quite literally in one case; a professional Fat Lady in a harlequin&#39;s outfit, a wizened mantis of a clerk, and the spine-covered, near-incomprehensible grotesque called Fish. Together, they formulated a plan to strike at a Marizu stronghold, called Axxor in their base and glittery tongue, operating out of Aohtree, and prepared a case for to bring the new guards there, with  provisions for a short and bloody engagement with that oh-so-hated foe.<br><br>And then her lady summoned her, and bade her look upon a letter from one Sir Tomash, of Teebor, and she laughed and laughed and laughed.</p>

            <p>The trouble with Ozerbord has always been that it&#39;s virtually empty. The description of Ozerbord city used to say that it was the largest population centre - but would still only be a town in the other nations.<br><br>It has no people. It has no running water outside a few streams. It has no sea-level coast. It has no trees. It has no easy access to the rest of Konti-Nyuum. Ozerbord is a nation which exists as a bunch of empty houses for people to run to when bad things happen in Borrd, or when they want to party.<br><br>This is changing, but very slowly. Baron Thanasius Ampelius is going crazy building magical airships down south, but he&#39;s pretty much refused to share the profits with anything outside his (tiny) borders. The lighter-than-airships up at Emaille haven&#39;t been a particular success. There&#39;s nothing to trade in the entire country, so no, it&#39;s not exactly an economic powerhouse.<br><br>Though no doubt Ye Scape-Grace will show up soon to explain how it&#39;s all Baron hS&#39;s fault and without his catastrophic mismanagement Ozerbord would be a shining beacon of prosperity.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The Other Board was originally the <i>New</i> Board. When the Board was attacked by spambots for the first time, it was still technically owned by Philosopher@Large - who hadn&#39;t been with the PPC for years.

            <p>... <a href="http://ppc-posting-board-2-proto.herokuapp.com/posts/2940">here</a>, we're considering using T-Board as the Other Board once the Board is back up. Any further discussion should really wait until the main Board comes back.</p>

<p>The reason for not saying 'whee, this is now the Board' is that it's never been subjected to any kind of long-term stability tests. We have no idea (yet) how well it'll hold up to people posting more than once in a blue moon.</p>

            <p>The Inter'Nelerors came without warning and descended upon the land, shrieking like giant hellbeasts with the stench of death on their teeth and fire in their eyes. I remain here, holed up in my keep, with no communication with the rest of Borrd save for magical links set up by Sir Tomash and implemented by Baron Huinesoron. The eagle's shadow spreads further every day, it would seem. However, it would seem that not everyone has yet been connected by the links; many still remain unaccounted for and I fear for their safety.</p>

<p>It is fortunate, perhaps, that the siege happened over the winter months, where food supplies have already been stored, ready to wait out the weather until the next planting season. It is not for lack of trying that I have yet to take down any of the beasts, but the Inter'Nelerors' hides are like iron, unpierceable by any of my arrows. Times like these are when I wish I'd payed better attention to mother when she tried to educate me in the ways of magic—though what is to say magic would fare any better against their skin? For all we know, they are resistant to both blade and spell. A worrisome situation all around.</p>

<p>The shrieking outside grows ever louder; I have not slept properly since the siege began. The servants are no better off, I fear. Tensions are running high and I worry that one of them might soon do something foolish like attempt to leave the safety of the keep. No matter; I shall speak to all of them tomorrow and do my best to reassure them that the beasts will soon be gone. A pretty lie that I wish I myself could believe.</p>

<p>Until they are gone for good, all I can do is wait.</p>

<p>(Plort thread because this Board's being awfully quiet and could do with a bit of livening up.)</p>

            <p>Hello! It&#39;s the newbie again. In the interest of getting to know all of you a little better, what are your fandoms? If you write agents, what are their names and what do they do? Any other factoids you wish to add are very welcome!</p>

            <p>...&#39;cuz this is gonna take a while! XD<br><br>I&#39;ve written fiction in general, and fanfic by extension, since I was in elementary school, and I&#39;ve had fandoms even before I knew that term even existed. And while most people think of their creative history as one continuous progression, I can identify at least six different &quot;seasons&quot; for my artistic and literary timeline, kinda like in a TV show. I&#39;ll list them below based on probable years in which they were prominent and the franchises that influenced me the most during that time.<br><br><b>Phase 1 - 2001-2004</b><br>My first attempts at creating fiction happened almost as soon as I learned to use a keyboard, which was when I was around ten or so. Early art and writing ranged from scribbled doodles of characters based on things I saw in books or on TV to a beige-prosed alien invasion story to a planned &quot;flagship&quot; series of stories that ripped off the characters and plot of the early phases of <i>BIONICLE</i>, whom my brother and I were interested in at the time, as well as a number of then recent Disney movies. It was known as &quot;The Life of a Warrior&quot; because again, reasons. I&#39;ve since grown out of it because, on closer inspection, it was basically a cleverly disguised badfic. Ah, well. First time for everything, I guess.<br>Fandoms: BIONICLE, Classic Disney, Harry Potter, Pokemon<br><br><b>Phase 2 - 2004-2005</b><br>My love of Pixar started coming into its own after the release of The Incredibles, with all the badfic ideas this implied. This phase began with a story that was basically a rewrite of The Incredibles, plagiarized but with aliens. Additionally, I also tried writing my own original fantasy story for the first time, though the hustle and bustle of Real Life prevented me from getting very far in that regard.<br>Fandoms: The Incredibles, Pixar in general<br><br><b>Phase 3 - 2005-2007</b><br>My author avatar and OCs began taking up presence in the majority of my writing from this phase onward, and this was where the earliest draft of my flagship fiction series would come into being. I planned to create books in the style of a TV show with episodic chapters, but most of the episode plots were derivative once again.<br>Fandoms: Teen Titans, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Ben 10<br><br><b>Phase 4 - 2008-2010</b><br>My interest in dinosaurs and fantasy creatures was kicked off in earnest when my brother and I binged on the listed franchises. I tried incorporating kaiju, dinosaurs, and other such things into every story I could think of. I tried drafting a series of stories involving people who could turn into prehistoric creatures, but it never got off the ground. I also developed an interest in classical mythology around this time, which helped out a great deal IMO.<br>Fandoms: Twilight, Percy Jackson<br><br><b>Phase 5 - 2010-2012</b><br>My return to Pokemon in full force, as a presumably more mature and sophisticated person, led to my first joining deviantART as part of the Pokemon fandom and as a creator of fanmade Pokemon designs. I began writing a story about Ash journeying through a region created by another artist on dA, with my own characters and concepts added into the storyline, but I had so little time to write episodes that it was ultimately discontinued at the end of this phase. Unfortunately, I also tried gaining the approval of a number of people both online and off, but was ultimately rejected thanks to my immaturity and egotism, so in some respects this is my least favorite phase. In a way, though, I guess I should be grateful for what happened, because I learned a lot about myself during those days, and I&#39;ve strived to become a better person since.<br>Fandoms: Godzilla, Jurassic Park, How To Train Your Dragon, Rise of the Guardians, Pacific Rim, Kid Icarus, The Legend of Zelda, My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic<br><br><b>Phase 6 - 2013-Present</b><br>The current phase, and who knows what else I’ll do in the future. I left DeviantArt when I started graduate school, and moved most of my work to Tumblr, so that meant I got exposed to a different set of fandoms. It&#39;s also the phase where I first encountered the PPC, which has since become one of the biggest influences as far as my writing is concerned.<br>Fandoms: Super Smash Bros, Xenoblade Chronicles, Steven Universe, Attack On Titan, One Piece, Fairy Tail, Monster Hunter, Monster Musume, Undertale<br><br>There&#39;s a whole host of other smaller fandoms which I&#39;ve certainly missed, but that&#39;s the gist of how I&#39;ve been with fandom over the years.<br><br>Now, onto the RCs/Agents. I&#39;ll list them in bullet-list format this time around, since I have too many running around...<br><br>- RC #227 (DF): My starting team, the one that got me Permission, and the one that sporked the one badfic I actually completed. The one agent who&#39;s consistently manned this RC is my PPC persona, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Falchion">Falchion</a>. His partner used to be <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Rashida_Mafdetiti">Rashida Mafdetiti</a>, one of my original-fiction OCs, but she&#39;s on leave right now because reasons, so his current partner is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Velociripper">Velociripper</a>, who hails from the aforementioned badfic and has since grown out of his formerly antagonistic ways.<br>- RC #133,316,666 (DMS): I never intended for this RC to get as far as it has - I simply wanted to bring in an agent to elaborate upon Rashida&#39;s backstory, and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Rayner_Blitzkrieg">Rayner Blitzkrieg</a>, who was originally introduced to the Interent for an MLP ask blog on Tumblr when I was super-obsessed with MLP, was selected at random. I then realized that I needed a partner for him, so I made the even more random decision of pairing him with another old OC of mine, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Evangeline_von_Lilith">Evangeline von Lilith</a>. Despite a rough start with the two of them, I&#39;ve gotten the hang of their tolerate-hate dynamic, and the fact that I was able to write them far, far away from the demented little fools they once were is still a pleasant surprise for me.<br>- RC #333 (DIC): <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Sarah_Katherine_Squall">Sarah Squall</a>, formerly Stratogale, was recruited from the same badfic as Ripper was, and she was one of the better things about it to the point that I just couldn&#39;t let her go to waste.  As my writing progressed, I decided that she had to be put in an RC of her own where she wouldn&#39;t have to suffer from Rashida&#39;s mildly toxic bouts of aggression, and her badfic being a mega-crossover meant that she had enough experience with bad crossovers that the DIC was perfect for her. The decision to pair her with <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Cupid_Carmine">Cupid Carmine</a> was actually inspired by an old plot bunny I had back when my flagship fiction was still a mega-crossover, where Sarah would be roommates and partners with the canon Pit. Cupid himself was recruited both objectively, because his backstory and characterization were just barely salvageable, and subjectively because IDK, I just wanted to write a drunken angel in a pink toga. I wasn&#39;t confident in my ability to write missions where the agents got along better than most, though, so I had to introduce a third wheel, and what better choice than <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Lapis_Lazuli">Lapis Lazuli</a>? She comes from a crossover, she&#39;s neurotic and pessimistic enough to counterbalance the other two, and I needed a place to put her after I had to stop work on her homefic anyway. Her getting her right hand cut off wasn&#39;t intentional, by the way, but I think it&#39;s helped her case in the long-term.<br>- RC #88224646BA (DMS-VG): This is my most recent RC, and like the other DMS one, it was originally intended as supporting material. Agents <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Backslash">Backslash</a> and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Whitney">Whitney</a> were introduced specifically to help my DF team for something I&#39;m keeping under wraps at this time, but I liked their interactions enough to flesh them out a little more beforehand. And hey, Falc and co. need to actually familiarize themselves with these two first...<br><br>Oh, and you wanted a fun fact? Due to my dad going on research trips more times than I care to count, and often taking his family along, I&#39;ve seen more places abroad in my 22 years on this Earth than most people could hope to see in their lifetimes. I&#39;ve been to Paris, Innsbruck, London, Madrid, Jakarta, Seoul, and Tokyo, and I&#39;ve set foot on Italian soil at least three times in the past two decades!<br><br>-SS, who really should stop posting at 1:30 AM</p>

            <p>Also Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, Sherlock, Doctor Who, so many anime and manga I lost count, Firefly, Game of Thrones (books), Terraria, the Tortall-verse, Harry Potter, Animal Crossing, Steven Universe, The Legend of Zelda, Welcome to Night Vale, Minecraft (sort of), and plenty of other things.<br><br>I have four agents at the moment: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Chris">Chris</a>, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Ami_Seeker">Ami</a>, Miguel (who&#39;ll get a page someday), and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Violet_Rose_Greenfield">Violet.</a> They&#39;re in Floaters, so they can take on pretty much anything as long as I have the motivation for it.

He&#39;s on one of the teams in charge of sorting incoming badfic, assigning stuff, and slowly losing faith in humanity with every fanfic that pops up on his computer terminal. <br><br>I also am responsible for Guardsman Emiranlanoamar of Gallifrey, Naya&#39;Keegan vas Headquarters (formerly Iktomi), and Terabyte -- my DIA Special Response trio. Got a situation in HQ? Agent team got in deep trouble on a mission? Did Harris Frost cause another disaster? Special Response is on the case.<br><br>3) Got a question about math or physics? I can probably answer that-- I enjoy the stuff.<br></p>

            <p>For fandoms, I&#39;ve got a lot of them. The most recent ones for the moment are <i>Dresden Files, Persona, RWBY, Supernatural</i> (thanks Das Sporking), <i>Lord of the Rings, Nanoha,</i> the 3 first series for the moment, <i>Harry Potter, Mistborn, Doctor Who, Buffy</i>... Think I gonna stop for the moment.<br><br>Their first mission is still on finishing stages before I call for betass, but I&#39;ve got two Freelance Assassins, Richard Legard and Marina Nicodelli.

            <p>1) It&#39;s a bit hard to state my fandoms because they change over time as new things catch my fancy. I&#39;d guess the current ones are <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, <i>Star Wars</i> (Snoke, pffft), <i>Doctor Who</i>, <i>Warframe</i>, the <i>Cosmere</i> (Brandon Sanderson&#39;s &#39;verse), the <i>Culture</i>, <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i>, <i>Harry Potter</i>, <i>Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</i> and <i>RWBY</i>.<br>2) I write agents <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Desdendelle">Desdendelle</a> and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Librarian">Lump</a> of the Department of Floaters and agents <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Navare">Navare</a> and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Amris">Amris</a> of APD-Nanoha.<br>3) I like tea.

            <p>So I&#39;m writing a Tenth Walker, and after wandering in the South Downs for a few days she winds up in Bree. She spends several months there, learning Westron and such, and I want to paint a realistic picture of the area, but it&#39;s hard due to lack of canon and some really odd details. <br><br>For example: salt. The books say that Sam had a little box of it that he &quot;replenished when he could,&quot; but where on earth did he get salt? There&#39;s no mention of salt mines that I know of, and it&#39;s apparently common enough for a gardener to keep a box of it, so where does it come from? Is there ongoing salt trade with the Grey Havens, drying salt water and collecting the brine? Are there Haradrim merchants, or Gondorian salt mines? <br><br>Another example: money. &quot;Penny-pieces&quot; are mentioned in the first chapter, Bill Ferny&#39;s price for Bill was twelve silver pennies, and Butterbur offered Merry eighteen pence, but that&#39;s probably Tolkien &quot;Anglicizing&quot; everything for us. So what is this currency, and where did it come from? I&#39;ve heard of a Gondorian coinage somewhere in the backstory, but it&#39;s unlikely those kinds of coins are abundant-- or even present --in Bree. Could they be old Arnorian coins? Does Eriador operate primarily on a barter system? Gold is some sort of standard, apparently, but even to well-off Mr. Butterbur &quot;thirty silver pennies was a sore blow.&quot; So do they use silver? Could the dwarves mint coins for them? Such question. Much fanon. Wow, Tolkien Doge. <br><br>And what about paper and books? There&#39;s some paper in Bree (unless Gandalf wrote his letter elsewhere), but how common is it? Literacy is unusual (Butterbur is somewhat proud of his ability to read, if I remember correctly), so that&#39;s a bit of a clue. Which reminds me of something: How is Bree governed? The Shire has an elected mayor, but Bree has no clear leader. Is it all common law? Is there a mayor figure? Is there a sort of &quot;board&quot; of important men in town who decide these things? What  about justice? So many questions. <br><br>There&#39;s also other things, like sugar (blackberry tarts and birthday cakes, man) and spices. Is there any trade between Bree and other places, like the Shire, Rohan, or even Gondor? The book says that the Men of Bree were familiar with Elves (and all other races); does that insinuate trade between them and Rivendell, or Mirkwood (random off the cuff headcanon: Bree is the producer of Dorwinion wine)? What does Bree produce (if anything) that would merit trade, and if they don&#39;t have anything, where do they get the rest of their stuff? <br><br>Perhaps all of these questions have been answered in the text and I didn&#39;t notice; if not, I&#39;d really appreciate some input. <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>If your story desperately requires an intricate knowledge of the trade-networks of late Third Age Middle-earth... then, actually, I&#39;d love to read it, but I don&#39;t think it does. ^<em>^<br><br><i>That said</i>, someone asked questions, and you all know what I&#39;m like. ^</em>^<br><br><hr>
<br><br>A lot of the answers are &#39;we don&#39;t really know&#39;, but since when has that stopped me? I took a few minutes to sketch out the known or inferred trade landscape of Middle-earth:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Middle-earth%20Economics.png"><br><br>The first thing to note is that the continent is divided cleanly in two. Gondor and Rohan form a cohesive whole - they have masses of trade up Anduin, and a major road leading from the capital into allied Rohan. With Dol Amroth by the sea and various towns near the mountains, if you&#39;re in Gondor and Rohan, you can probably get hold of most things.<br><br>But they don&#39;t trade with the north. We know how much trouble Boromir had making the crossing at Tharbad - he lost his horse - so there <i>can&#39;t</i> be regular trade up the Greenway. So why have I drawn a big red line west of the Misty Mountains?<br><br>Saruman. Saruman traded with the Shire, and was interested enough to place spies in Bree. Saruman definitely uses the Greenway (possibly he has a hidden crossing outside Tharbad proper). Given that he doesn&#39;t really have much trade with Rohan, he also presumably has economic ties to his neighbours to the west - the Dunlendings who end up in his armies. Isengard is part of the northern economic area; he&#39;s not tied into Gondor&#39;s trade networks.<br><br>So, to the north. Over in the east, we have the trade network laid out in <i>The Hobbit</i> - Mirkwood, Dale, and Dorwinion down by the Sea of Rhun (no, it doesn&#39;t come from Bree, I&#39;m afraid). I&#39;ve included the Iron Hills in that area, since I doubt the dwarves all returned to the Lonely Mountain.<br><br>Dwarves are actually a key component of the northern trade network - they cut through the Shire on their way from the Blue Mountains to the Iron Hills (and later Erebor). They were seen, I vaguely recall, as somewhere between tinkers and peddlers - it&#39;s not noted as unusual that Gandalf brings dwarves with him to Bilbo&#39;s Party, or that they bring goods with them (though the Dale-marking is unfamiliar to the Shire-folk).<br><br>Elves also pass through the Shire, heading to or from the Havens, but they don&#39;t do so as traders - they camp out in the hills, and folk like Sam never see them. The Big Folk are known of, but not often seen (though Gandalf didn&#39;t get given suspicious glares or anything); we can probably infer some trade with Bree-land, though it seems the hobbits in both regions didn&#39;t travel.<br><br>In general, the Shire is a pretty insular economy - they have a strong tradition of re-use (see: mathoms), and until Saruman stuck his nose in, there&#39;s no indication that they had much <i>new</i> stuff. It was all just... well cared-for.<br><br>Bree-land is basically a farming region; it probably sprang up around the Prancing Pony and the Forsaken Inn (a day&#39;s ride east of Bree), as a stopover point for dwarves from the Blue Mountains (but it did so waaaaay back in the Second Age). I suspect the main trade pattern is: Barliman buys from the farmers, the farmers buy from travellers (and each other), travellers stay with Barley. The &#39;product&#39; is food and rest, not anything exciting.<br><br>Rivendell isn&#39;t on the trade-map: one of the most subtle charges against <i>C<em>l</em>br_<em>n</i> is that it has traders coming to Elrond&#39;s <i>hidden valley refuge</i>. Yeah, no. Elves go there, and Rangers; other folks don&#39;t.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Moving on to your specific questions now, keeping in mind everything I&#39;ve said above:<br><br><b>Salt</b> probably comes from dwarvish mines in the Blue Mountains. There&#39;s no trade with the South, and the Havens don&#39;t seem to trade. So Sam might&#39;ve bought a little every time a party of dwarves came through (there&#39;s a ficlet for you).<br><br><b>Money</b> is one we&#39;ve looked at recently, in the Boozonomics thread. Gondorian currency features two coin names, the <i>castar</i> and the <i>tharni</i>. The <i>tharni</i> is worth a quarter of the <i>castar</i>, and is also used to mean &#39;farthing&#39; (as in East-, West-, South-), so what we have is coin names for &#39;penny&#39; and &#39;farthing&#39;. (These are the Westron names; in Sindarin, they&#39;re <i>mirian</i> and <i>canath</i>.)<br><br>It&#39;s a reasonable guess that Gondorian money is the same as Arnorian - they <i>were</i> economically connected, and words like &#39;penny&#39; aren&#39;t going to diverge too much when the language itself - Westron - remains cohesive. So Barliman&#39;s silver pennies were <i>castar</i>. Per &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mzkG-ImZWhzOdFJLYEmga">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mzkG-ImZWhzOdFJLYEmga</a></em>zNjOMu-qdu0yMLNZ2phik/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;the Booze Standard spreadsheet</a>, I&#39;ve estimated them as being worth about £65, or somewhere between $70 and $90 (this is buying power, so the difference isn&#39;t the same as our exchange rate).<br><br>That makes a silver farthing worth about £15, which is far too high for the smallest currency unit - and silver is a precious metal anyway. Since a) I vaguely know that some old currencies had the same coin struck in different metals (for different values), and b) copper is a common metal for cheap currency, having copper pennies and farthings seems reasonable. Per the spreadsheet, copper is worth about 1/12 the value of silver (in the real world); given that Elves like the number 12, and Tolkien grew up with a system of 12 pennies to the shilling, 12 copper pennies to the silver penny works quite nicely. (This puts a copper farthing somewhere around the price of a drink in an inn, so yeah.)<br><br>The actual coins are probably a mix of different things - some Gondorian, some old Arnorian (probably the gold), possibly Isengard coinage, some dwarf- or even hobbit-minted coins. Barter would probably have been used in a lot of situations - rangers aren&#39;t going to be carrying much cash around, and Gaffer Proudfoot isn&#39;t going to force Gammer Bucklebey to scrape together some coins to buy potatoes when she can just promise him some of her eggs next time the hens lay some.<br><br>The <a href="http://www.shirepost.com/wp/#!/The-Lord-of-the-Rings%C2%99/c/14506031/offset=0&amp;sort=normal">Shire Post</a> has a gorgeous line of Middle-earth coins, for what it&#39;s worth. They&#39;re not based on anything in the book (hilariously, they&#39;ve turned the silver penny into a silver shilling, so they don&#39;t even have that!) but they&#39;re very nice. I have some. ^<em>^<br><br><b>Paper</b> is easy to make from wood pulp; I think it&#39;s fairly common. Bilbo was able to acquire a diary after setting off after the dwarves with nothing, for instance, and I think the majority of hobbits were literate (in the cirth, not the tengwar). Bree... well, if you say Barley was unusual, I&#39;ll accept that! Bree, Archet, Combe, and Staddle were basically inhabited by farmers, so they didn&#39;t need to read.<br><br><b>Bree-land&#39;s government</b> is unknown. Bill Ferney doesn&#39;t get arrested for his assumed part in letting the horses out, so perhaps it&#39;s &#39;rule by the strong&#39;. If Bree is a market-town for the other villages, it could be the leading merchants who run things. It&#39;s <i>not</i> the Rangers of Arnor - they&#39;re viewed as suspicious.<br><br><b>Sugar and spices</b>... well, honey is a good source of sweetener if you don&#39;t have access to actual sugar. Do you have a quote for the spices? I can&#39;t think of anything, but if it&#39;s there, then I&#39;d guess at Dorwinion, by way of Erebor. Maybe dwarves like curry. ^</em>^<br><br>I think that covers most of it? And will take a few days to read? :D<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Like I mentioned to Scape, having a foundation of general knowledge will be awesome while I&#39;m writing. And, who knows: if Amy is dropped off early enough before Stuff Happens, she might travel with some traders along that network. Plenty of interesting opportunities with that! In fact, it would help tie up a loose end I&#39;ve been having trouble with... Hmm... I&#39;ll think about this a little more. <br><br>Anyway, yay, answers! :D Thank you! <br><br>Ah, that&#39;s where Dorwinion is. For some reason, I thought it was unknown.<br><br>This trade route is very handy-- thank you! It gives me some interesting opportunities with travel pre-Quest.<br><br><b>Salt</b>: Excellent! The more I thought about it the more it bugged me, and I had completely forgotten about the Blue Mountains (I used to think I knew a lot about M-e. Used to).<br><br><b>Money</b>: Yus, coins! Arguably the most important question of the lot. It&#39;s especially awesome to have Westron names for them. <br><br><b>Paper</b>: Also something that bugged me, for some reason. About literacy-- at a total guess, how many Gondorian citizens would you say are literate (and do we have any population guesses)? I would say all of the upper class, including merchants and such, are literate, but most of the lower-class is not. <br><br><b>Government</b>: &quot;Rule by the strong&quot; sounds a little harsh, especially considering how the Bree-landers are described as &quot;cheerful and independent.&quot; A head merchant being something of a leader sounds better. I could also imagine the Bree-landers having no formal government, as it&#39;s a very small population, or just a circle of family heads to keep things in order. <br><br><b>Sugar and Spice (and everything nice)</b>: I&#39;m getting rather obsessive by this point (not any earlier, of course. No siree). Honey as a sweetener is probably the best choice, and spices was more of a &quot;Do they have spices? If so, how?&quot; kind of question; I have no quotes. Dwarves liking curry seems oddly fitting, though. <br><br>I believe that was all! I&#39;ll probably come up with something else out of left field soon, of course. Thanks again, hS! Your knowledge (and the ability to put up with my incessant questions) never fails to impress me. <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve based this on a random map of the centres of origins of various spices. Obviously, some plants will spread naturally to adjacent areas, while others will be cultivated (herbs in the Shire, for instance). Partly I guess this is going to depend on the evolutionary age of the plant - it looks like onions spread to the New World, while things like cinnamon have stayed very local.<br><br>I&#39;ve also noted key locations in red, and hypothetical trade routes in blue. And so:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/ArdaSpices.png"><br><br>The base map is the Second Age one from the <i>Atlas of Middle-earth</i>. It&#39;s largely based on Tolkien&#39;s Ambarkanta map, which you can see low down <a href="http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/55292/where-is-the-equator-in-middle-earth">here</a>; it&#39;s wildly outdated, but it&#39;s the best we have.<br><br>Apparently both Saffron and Cumin are Med plants - I figured they were both Indian, but there you go. Basil, on the other hand, is from Indonesia.<br><br>I&#39;ve speculated that the far-eastern spices are unknown on the mainland. Neither Sauron nor Morgoth have ever had much to do with the sea (the Corsairs are part-Numenorean), so I doubt the Dark Lord set up oceanic trade routes. Those spices <i>might</i> still be available, though - the Numenoreans would have visited way back in the Second Age, and they might be cultivatable in Numenor and Umbar. That&#39;s dubious, though.<br><br>The Indian spices are a bit of a coin toss. Would they be shipped to Umbar, or not? That depends how much of a free hand you think Sauron will give his subjects.<br><br>And one thing I <i>don&#39;t</i> think is available in the west: poppies. Some breeds of poppy can be used to make opium. Do you <i>really</i> think Sauron would let a drug that can make people dependent on him out into the wild? Nah-uh. He&#39;s keeping that for himself, and using it to create spies.<br><br>hS<br><br></p>

            <p>If there&#39;s relative peace between Gondor and Harad, <b>or</b> if Gondor has a secure hold on South Gondor, then there&#39;s probably trade all the way up (though, as before, after the fall of Arthedain, there&#39;s not much going from Gondor to Arnor).

I doubt there&#39;s a whooole lot of trade going on. (All three of those adjectives are made up, by the way.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Something that might help is to look up forms of trial by ordeal (in which one determines the guilt of a party by, er, making them do something unpleasant), but the one that really springs to mind is <i>tangena</i>. This is a Madagascan traditional form of trial by ordeal in which one ingests a really quite unfathomably poisonous tangena nut. After a brief pause, the accused was then fed three pieces of chicken skin; if they were all successfully puked up, then you were innocent, and if you managed to keep it down (or died horribly in the process) you were guilty and in need of correctional measures. Which, particularly during the reign of Ranavalona I, generally meant decapitation.<br><br>Now, the reason I bring it up is because in Malagasy culture, the tangena ordeal was thought to be absolutely infallible to the point where the innocent would actually <i>ask to go through it</i>. If your main character is an ingenue, and she&#39;s from this culture, then that might be an excellent reveal as to how talk rot works in-universe. Hope that&#39;s helpful! =]</p>

            <p>It&#39;s an incredibly striking image; I can&#39;t wait to use it. <br><br>Ooh, yes, trial by ordeal. I&#39;d heard about that before, particularly the method where the accused picks up a red-hot iron bar and carries it a certain distance. If his hands don&#39;t get infected (good luck with that, Englishmen in the days before basic hygiene) then he&#39;s innocent. If they do, well, there&#39;s your answer. History was brutal. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure if this is what you meant, exactly, but that gives me the idea of my main character (Susan, at the moment, but this story has only just begun so it could change) accidentally signing up to be infected. It would be kind of like selling yourself into indentured servitude to help your family, but, you know, without the whole &quot;living&quot; bit. She might actually get infected, forcing her companions to break into one of the most dangerous courts in the world to get the antidote. Which would be pretty fun to write. <br><br>Also, ingenue-- excellent word for Susan. And just an excellent word. <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Back in the day, I was working on my own Tenth Walker fic involving a Haradrim Walker who&#39;d been sent to deliver information to Gandalf by Morinehtar... and arrived shortly after the flight from Moria. His timing was, as might be inferred, absolutely impeccable. Something I thought about was this idea that the Haradrim were similar to the Berber nations, and that they were traders in spice - or at least they <i>would be</i> if the Northrons would sit down and listen for five seconds rather than stab them with bits of pointy metal. A recurring phrase in the plan I cobbled together (and, let me be clear, entirely invented) was &quot;Haradrim give no gifts&quot;, and that therefore Amro, son of Artax, would give a small, beautifully carved ivory box of some random spice plant or another&#39;s seeds to Galadriel in return for whatever gift the Lady of the Wood gave to him.<br><br>Now, I know this is entirely fictitious, but a) would that be feasible given what little we know of Harad in the Third Age, and b) what kind of spices would we expect to <i>find</i> in Middle-Earth at this time, particularly ones to the south. I just thought it might be an interesting thought experiment, is all. =]</p>

            <p>a) &#39;Given what little we know&#39; is an understatement! The fact that <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aPnu2tJopZLrgV3Jcu62z5qnm1XlpXLasrOJaaYS0Yo/pub">the Baynes map</a> actually told me a significant new fact about Harad (that it has camels) is a massive hint at just <i>how</i> little we know. And they&#39;re under Sauron&#39;s thumb, of course...<br><br>I would say that yes, given the implied deserts, nomadic traders would be viable. If Umbar serves a useful purpose for Sauron, he needs people to cart stuff back and forth to it - and it&#39;s just plain <i>easier</i> to piggyback an extant trade network than to enslave one of your own.<br><br>There&#39;s probably some border-trade in South Gondor - the region south of Anduin; we already know it&#39;s a &#39;debatable land&#39;, which sounds very much like mingling. I imagine the tall folk of Minas Tirith turn something of a blind eye to it (putting it down as &#39;intelligence gathering&#39; while tucking into their spiced cakes or whatever...). But yeah, anyone from Harad wandering into the North is likely to be greeted with stabs a&#39;plenty.<br><br>As for specifically moving spices... hmm. See below.<br><br>b) Now you&#39;ve got me researching the spice trade. ^_^ &#39;Spices&#39; as we know them come from, broadly speaking, India and the Middle-east. They do <i>not</i> come from Africa - the spice trade through Africa seems to have come about because Alexandria served as a spice-port. So your traders would be taking spices from Khand (south-east of Mordor) and the lands beyond it, and moving them to western Harad - the urban centre of Umbar.<br><br>But what would they be? I&#39;m going to run through <a href="http://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/herbs-spices/basic-spice-checklist">this randomly-chosen list of &#39;basic spices&#39;</a> to answer that.<br><br>-Bay leaves: from the Bay Laurel. Mediterranean, so could grow in South Gondor or southern Ithilien, and possibly Dorwinion.<br>-Black pepper: native to southern Asia. Would have to travel long distances, and bypass Mordor. Unlikely to be available - I suspect Sauron would stop the traders at his borders, rather than bothering to send them through.<br>-Cayenne pepper: a New World plant. While they could be a Numenorean import (see: tomatoes, potatoes), their warm climate requirement suggests to me they probably wouldn&#39;t grow in the wild - and given the state of the world in the Third Age, it&#39;s unlikely there are cultivated samples around.<br>-Chili powder: ditto.<br>-Cinammon: a bark of Indian origin. Quite possible this could be traded through Khand to Umbar.<br>-Cloves: native to Indonesia. As with pepper, unlikely to make it past Mordor.<br>-Cream of tartar: forms in wine casks, so Dorwinion or Gondor are perfect.<br>-Cumin: native to the Middle-east, ie, Khand and the lands south of Mordor. This one definitely makes it to Umbar, and is probably found (rarely) growing in South Gondor.<br>-Curry powder: a blend of spices from India. The varieties we know wouldn&#39;t exist, but some form of this would probably wander into Harad.<br>-Ginger: comes from China. As with the rest of the South Asian spices, I consider this unlikely.<br>-Kosher salt: well, it&#39;s salt. Mines or sea-salt, you can get it.<br>-Nutmeg: Actual nutmeg is Indonesian, but there&#39;s a lesser variety from India. The latter could make it to Harad; rumours of &#39;super-nutmeg&#39; might prompt tiny portions of the former to follow (or, more likely, normal stuff they /claim/ is the good variety...).<br>-Oregano: a relative of mint (as are things like marjoram), which probably grows wild across Middle-earth. Certainly around Ithilien and Dorwinion.<br>-Paprika: New-World chili derivative. No chance.<br>-Crushed red pepper: as above.<br>-Rosemary: Mediterranean, so wild-growing in Ithilien.<br>-Sesame seeds: These are African! If you live in Umbar and want to make your food more interesting, sesame is the way to go.<br>-Thyme: another Med plant, so head to Ithilien. Sam chose a good place to start demanding herbs, didn&#39;t he?<br>-Vanilla extract: New-World, and symbiotic with a particular bee to boot. Even less chance than the rest.<br><br>Basically: herbs, yes. Indian/Mid-eastern spices, possible by way of Harad. South Asian/Chinese/Indonesian spices, no chance. And if in doubt, err on the side of &#39;Sauron thinks you&#39;re wasting your time with these frivolous flavourings - it&#39;s not like He needs to eat, anyway!&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The Númenoreans sailed around the world before getting kicked off their island. Couldn&#39;t they have picked up and then cultivated some exotic herbs and spices?

            <p>I forgot about gardens. ^_^ Since the Shire was once part of Arnor, which was in a firm trading relationship with Gondor, it makes perfect sense that Ithilien/Mediterranean herbs (thyme, bay, maybe sage as well) would&#39;ve been available there way back - and given the nature of hobbits, and the fact that the Shire has never been a war-zone, it makes equally perfect sense that they would&#39;ve continued as cultivated and garden plants.<br><br><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/15/ten-best-herbs-grow-containers">This</a> page suggests the ten best herbs for growing in containers (in Britain); they all look pretty plausible. It&#39;s kind of hard to find out what&#39;s strictly <i>native</i>, because we&#39;ve been importing things for two thousand years; <a href="https://jekkasherbfarm.wordpress.com/category/native-herbs-of-the-uk/">apparently</a> they include primrose, ground ivy, and  myrtle.<br><br>Jumping back to the first couple of questions: the Numenoreans sailed north and south, but this was before the changing of the world. They definitely can&#39;t have picked up any New World plants (unless they did it in the brief period when they claim to have sailed right around the world at the start of the Third Age), and it&#39;s not very clear how much of the Far East existed at the time. It&#39;s <i>possible</i> that they could&#39;ve brought spices and spice-plants to Numenor... but unless Elendil thought them important enough to rescue, they would&#39;ve died with the island.<br><br>Actually, the place where they might have survived is Umbar - it&#39;s southerly enough that tropical plants could survive there, and it was populated by Kings&#39; Men, who would&#39;ve seen their luxuries as important. But Umbar has almost always been hostile to Gondor... and has been razed several times. I don&#39;t think Gondor would have cultivated Far Eastern spices (and I don&#39;t think they had the technology for greenhouses).<br><br>Though I <i>am</i> now imagining a story about The Last Cinnamon Tree, planted in a garden somewhere in Umbar, watching the various events around it - and finally burning in one of the sieges and sackings of the city...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Do we have evidence of glassmaking in Middle-earth? I know Vingilot was remade using &#39;elven-glass&#39;, which phrase was used by Bilbo (who therefore must know what (elven-)glass is), but is there anything else? I mostly recall <i>crystal</i> - which is what I would guess was used for Vingilot.<br><br>The best place to look would probably be the Shire. Hmm... the windows of Bag-End? I&#39;m getting an implication of <i>no</i> glass:<br><br><i>After a while Gandalf got up, closed the shutters outside the window, and drew the curtains. The room became dark and silent, though the clack of Sam’s shears, now nearer to the windows, could still be heard faintly from the garden.</i><br><br>Gandalf closes shutters and curtains, but no mention of glass - they can still hear the shears, and he&#39;s still able to drag Sam in through the window later. <br><br>A rather more direct approach: how often is the word &#39;glass&#39; used in the text of LotR? Well, there&#39;s 13 in <i>Fellowship</i>:<br><br>Four instances in the Shire:<br><br><i>sometimes, after a glass or two, [Bilbo] would allude to the absurd adventures of his mysterious journey<br><br>[Frodo] got up and drained his own glass silently to the health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion.<br><br>not a penny-piece or a glass bead was given away.<br><br>said Frodo, as he drained his glass.</i><br><br>One dream of Frodo&#39;s:<br><br><i>growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver</i><br><br>One description of the river:<br><br><i>there was a distant glint like pale glass where the Brandywine River made a great loop</i><br><br>A couple in Rivendell:<br><br><i>He may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that can.&#39;<br><br>you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a looking-glass</i><br><br>Two in Bilbo&#39;s poem:<br><br><i>where keen the air, where pale as glass<br><br>of mithril and of elven-glass</i><br><br>Two in Moria:<br><br><i>its black walls, polished and smooth as glass<br><br>&#39;Mithril! All folk desired it. It could be beaten like copper, and polished like glass&#39;</i><br><br>And one glass window, by way of Galadriel:<br><br><i>She shone like a window of glass upon a far hill in the westering sun</i><br><br>So you&#39;re right: plate glass exists, but is rare. Frodo compares the Dead Marshes to a dirty glass window (one of 18 instances in TTT, alongside descriptions of the <i>palantir</i> and the star-glass). Gimli compares the surface of the pools beneath the Hornburg to glass. And... that&#39;s it. There&#39;s nothing relevant in the 8 RotK instances (except yet another instance of crystal-as-glass - the green stone Aragorn wears).<br><br>So: plate-glass exists. It&#39;s common enough that (if we assume the narrator is speaking Frodo&#39;s thoughts) Frodo has seen it dirty. But no-one seems to have any.<br><br>Regardless, though: would Gondorian greenhouses have survived the various wars and plagues to sweep the country? I&#39;d guess not, but I don&#39;t know for sure.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>There&#39;s at least a few things that require a vaguely warm climate that you get from the New World. So, the question is this: where did pipe-weed come from? Or does the differentiation between varieties imply tobacco is... native... to the Shire...<br><br>Hey, hS, old mucker, d&#39;you recall that crackpot theory that Middle-Earth is Mesoamerican? =]</p>

            <p>There are three New World plants which we know grow in the Shire: potatoes, tomatoes, and pipe-weed. We also know pipe-weed grows wild in Gondor, but that Hobbits are the only people who cultivate it.<br><br>That&#39;s actually more significant than it sounds: Hobbits were the first people to see pipe-weed as anything other than a weed, so why would it&#39;ve been brought from Numenor/the New Lands? Tomatoes and potatoes, yes. A weed? Unlikely.<br><br>And tobacco is a warm-climate plant: see <a href="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8567470271_3001310221_b.jpg">this map</a> for where it was grown in the &#39;30s. You can juuuust about grow it in northern Europe, but I doubt it&#39;s easy. The fact that it grew wild in the Shire suggests that it may well be native.<br><br>... assuming that pipe-weed is actually tobacco. The genus <i>Nicotiana</i> includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotiana">species native to southern Africa and south Asia as well</a>. If we step up to the entirety of <i>Solanaceae</i> - aka the Nightshades, which also includes taters and tomatoes! - we get a global distribution. Many of them produce alkaloids, of which nicotine is one; lots of them are poisonous (belladonna!), but some take longer to kill you (y&#39;know, nicotine).<br><br>It&#39;s a bit of a coincidence that the three New World plants all come from the same family. Could it be that &#39;tomato&#39;, &#39;potato&#39;, and &#39;pipe-weed&#39; are just three varieties of Old World <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanum"><i>Solanum</i></a> which have been bred to be non-toxic and (in the case of pipe-weed) to contain a stimulant alkaloid? Could they even have originally been one and the same plant, which was carefully bred into different forms by over-eager hobbits?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Belladonna Took was Bilbo&#39;s mum, if memory serves. So that&#39;s interesting, and at least partially implies that the plant was used for the same thing - belladonna&#39;s name, if you didn&#39;t know, comes from the habit in Renaissance Italian high society of its berries being crushed up and the juices dripped into a woman&#39;s eyes to give an attractive wide-eyed look.<br><br>Also, it&#39;s prolly worth mentioning that potatoes were originally grown for their <i>flowers</i> in Europe before it was established you could use them as basically the best root crop in the history of ever (seriously, the potato completely changed the face of European history, at least in part because you couldn&#39;t destroy crops of it that easily during the campaigning season), which is fair enough because they&#39;re <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Potato_flowers.jpg">really rather pretty</a>. So yeah, new headcanon: potatoes, tomatoes, and pipe-weed are all much more closely related.</p>

            <p>I can answer with a bit of World One knowledge.<br><br>See, mining for rock salt isn&#39;t the only way to get it; the Bunyoro trading empire was built on the Kibiro salt industry, and that was based around panning for it in Lake Albert. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me in the least if Mannish kingdoms near the sea, Dol Amroth being probably the most likely example, traded heavily in salt as a luxury.<br><br>However, the biggest thing to remember is this: how does it advance the narrative to explain in exhaustive detail the trade network of Eriador and Middle-Earth in general? I mean, Tolkien did like to wander off on discussions of stuff, but he&#39;s hardly Victor Hugo; his was a legendarium of tales and songs and the oldest, oldest stories, not a complete history of absolutely everything that went on. Remember that Tolkien&#39;s work was written <i>long</i> before the idea of &quot;history from below&quot; as codified by E.P. Thompson, and (and this is total guesswork on my part) I doubt very much that the Professor would have given so much as the time of day to Marxist historians like Thompson, Hobsbawm, <i>et al.</i><br><br>However, don&#39;t let this discourage you. I&#39;m sure hS can fill in the details - after all, he found the Gondorian coinage you mention (the <i>castar</i> and the <i>tharni</i>) and his Numenorean flying ironclads - but ultimately it comes down to this. If you can plausibly leap to it from stuff in the text after a close reading, then you&#39;re probably fine. =]</p>

            <p>Did you learn that from Civ as well? I should start playing those games; they seem really interesting. <br><br>...You know, I never thought I&#39;d ever give consideration to sources of salt in M-e and the economic impacts thereof. <br><br>With advancing the narrative: I&#39;m trying to get the general flavor of Bree, and economics are a big part of that. For example, is everyone excited when a peddler&#39;s wagon comes through, or is it a fairly regular occurrence? What materials do the Bree-landers have on hand? What&#39;s scarce and what&#39;s common? Some of that will inevitably be fanon and best guesses, of course, but I thought it wouldn&#39;t hurt to ask the experts. <br><br>Like I told EvilAI, I think, for the most part, it will come through in small scenes or one-liners. Little points that make Bree seem more permanent and solid-- that&#39;s a big thing I&#39;m going for. I want to build a pretty solid foundation of background info to draw on, even if I don&#39;t use all of it. <br>  <br>Plus, I&#39;m personally curious about these things. Worldbuilding, ftw! <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll let one of the resident experts answer the question, but I would like to pose one for you.  I understand what you are trying to do, it can always add to a story, but it can bog down the story as well.  So my question is, for your story to work, do you really need all that extra?  I only ask, because it brings to mind Moby Dick.  One of the biggest issue many readers have is the fact that a large chunk of the story is less fiction and more Whaling Treatise.  Many readers might have trouble if you go too deeply into the details on something like that.<br><br>Of course if you think it works and won&#39;t bog down your readers, by all means go for it.  </p>

            <p>Thank you for asking: it&#39;s a very good question. Yeesh, yes, I remember the Whaling Treatise bits. Very dull. I&#39;ll do my best to avoid that-- mostly, I want Bree to seem like Amy&#39;s home, so that when she leaves it&#39;s not like leaving some random town. Some of the questions were just me being curious, though: after all, where <i>did</i> they get that salt? I&#39;ve recently been working on worldbuilding, so that kind of inquiry has been on my mind. <br><br>I think a lot of it will boil down to one-liners or small scenes: The arrival of a peddler, or Amy missing/appreciating salt; things like that.

            <p>The Really Very Tiny Auditorium was a convenient place to hold any kind of gathering, as the thankfully-absent Notary would be quick to tell you. There was plenty of space for people to knock together a stage out of chipboard and pile up an eye-searing cavalcade of wrapping paper, some of it in Suvian colours that were doing odd things to the onlookers' collective gaze. There was also, unlike last year, an instructive and explanatory pamphlet concerning all the rules, regulations, and general guidelines of the Gift Exchange, though why they had been written in a peculiar phonetic cod-German accent remained a mystery.</p>

<p>Until, that is, the bell of a large brass instrument protruded from behind the slightly knackered lectern like Venus Arising From The MDF.</p>

<p>"Er, hallo? Is this think beink on?" Doktor Trollenfisch, a purple balloon about a foot across and covered in spikes, prodded the microphone with an outstretched fin. "Hm, I vill be testink zis accordinkly."</p>

<p>The resultant brass fanfare nearly deafened the crowd, as well as shake loose one of the light fittings at the back.</p>

            <p>She'd been watching as the others received their gifts and now that her turn had finally come up, she'd already made her decision. As the pile of presents slowly dwindled and the odds of there being something cool left grew smaller and smaller, she figured taking one of the two remaining gifts just wouldn't be worth it.</p>

<p>She waved at the Skarmory sitting across from her. "Oi, Falch," she called. "Gun please."</p>

<p>"But I-"</p>

<p>"She asked, Falchion. She is a friend. You aren't going to turn your back on your friends here at the PPC like you once did with me, aren't you?"</p>

<p>Falchion shuddered, and promptly walked over and handed it to her. Then he went and picked up one of the last remaining gifts from the pile, before heading back and opening it.</p>

<p>"Just what I need," he muttered. "A Parthenon puzzle."</p>

<p>"No, it's that since we started the mini-Missingno adoption center--please come visit our RC if you want one, by the way--I think it'd be weird to just give one away like an old T-shirt," said Chris.

            <p>"Ah! It's me! Oh, vhat kind of lovely surprise vill be surprisink me today? Ve shall see, ach ja, ve shall see-ee!" He bounced -- quite literally, and with some measure of complaint from the sousaphone still wrapped around him like a particularly noisy life preserver -- over to the pile of presents and blew a brief fanfare. "Ohhh, I am feelink lucky, my vord yes!"</p>

<p>The Doktor knew in a moment what he wanted. It was the most present-shaped present out of the lot, right down to the pointy rosette and the beautifully-tied ribbon, and since he'd spent a brief period of time <i>as</i> a Christmas present, he knew of what he spoke. It seemed... perfect. There was just one teensy-veensy little problemette. A truly bijou problem, perfect for the first-time buyer.</p>

<p>He flopped over to the closest biped, who happened to be Lola herself, and nudged her with his tuba. "Er, excuse me. Could I possibly be prevailink upon you to help me vizz my present, please? My partner, vell, she left our RC in a bit of ein hurry, und I cannot vork zer Disguise Generator vizzout sprayink mein qwills everyvhere und turnink zer place into a minefield for her soft und fluffy paws. I am most unfortunately bereft of zer useful opposable thumbs, and, if it ist not beink to much trouble..." The Doktor shrugged helplessly, no small feat for a spiky pink balloon wrapped in a brass instrument.</p>

<p>Lola, on the other hand, just set her box of fluffy lifeform down on the table and crouched in front of him. "Of course I will, Doc! Least I can do for the compere." She grabbed the present (indicated by a gesticulating fin) and began to open it, making sure the paper didn't tear. "Must've been difficult to step up to the plate. Flop up? Oh God, I'm doing it again. My foot's so deep in my mouth I'll be wiping bootblack for a month, as my ol' mum used to say."</p>

<p>"Oh, it vas not beink so very bad," the Doktor replied, totally oblivious to the human's panic. "I admit I vas beink ein leetle nervous, but zen I vas sayink to mein self, Herr Doktor, you are ein Agent of ze Department of WhatThe. Zis ist not being so very scary! Not compared to Harry Potter doing somezink unmentionable vizz too much lukevarm coffee und completely insufficient lubrication, ja?"</p>

<p>"I'll, uh, I'll take your word for that, Doc," Lola said, her eyes widening slightly. The paper was then laid neatly at the side. Waste not, want not, after all. Then she actually <i>looked</i> at it. "Oh, mate, I'm sorry..."</p>

<p>"It ist beink fine," said the Doktor as he eyed the Tough Glove. His sousaphone gave a sad, deflated-sounding parp. "I know it ist not necessarily beink zer most useful of presents for ein fish vizzout zer humanoid hands und zo forth, but it ist still ein present und I vill enjoy it very much. Vhatever it is."</p>

<p>"Listen, cob, you seem like a decent guy, why don't we trade-"</p>

<p>"Nein, nein. I vill be entirely okay vizz zis, und vill vear it vhen I am beink in human guise und practicing vizz mein Biggenbrassenparpenthingen. Thank you so much for your assistance, miss..."</p>

<p>"Lola, cob," Lola said.</p>

<p>"Indeed. You vill alvays be velcome in RC 347, Lola!" The Doktor bounced off again, the new present clanking in the bell of his sousaphone.</p>

<p>"... Wait, how did he pick it up -- oh, never mind. I'll drink to stop thinking about that later." And Lola wandered off, her tribble box under her arm.</p>

<p>Lapis gasped. "It's a Tough Glove!"</p>

<p>"A what?" asked E.V.L.</p>

<p>"That's right, a Tough Glove from <i>Undertale!</i>" said Backslash. "It provides +5 Attack, and your Attack will increase even further if you use up a Punch Card while wearing it!" He glanced at Lapis uncomfortably, rubbing his arm in spite of himself. "How did you know, anyway?"</p>

<p>Lapis side-eyed him warily, but replied anyway. "I have that game on Steam! It's amazing, and I'd highly recommend giving it a try if you have the time."</p>

<p>"I've seen a Let's Play of it, actually, including both the Neutral and Pacifist runs! I still need to play the game itself, though."</p>

<p>"Looks like Backslash and I are not the only ones who are filled with determination," Whitney laughed, before addressing the crowd at large. "We got that glove from a mission into that continuum a while ago. Sans/OC shipping... 'boners' and all."</p>

<p>"You do <i>not</i> want to know," Backslash added. "Trust me."</p>

            <p>"So, does that mean we can pick our gifts together? Just this once?" asked Sarah.</p>

<p>"That would be a good idea," Whitney replied. "This way, we can save time for the remaining contestants."</p>

<p>The two of them stepped forward, nodding at each other, and simultaneously pulled out two different gifts. Whitney's was pretty tiny, but Sarah's was the largest by far, as tall as her and twice as heavy, and it was lucky her super-strength was up to the task of carrying it back.</p>

<p>Whitney opened hers first, raising an eyebrow. "Oooh, I hope I can adapt this to my dietary regimen. It looks and sounds pretty tasty!"</p>

<p>"What looks and sounds tasty?" asked Backslash, looking over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"The quesedilla recipe I just received. I'd like to cook up health-food-style Tex-Mex sometime, maybe even with the hot sauce that Crazy Dave used on the taco that kicks off the plot of <i>Plants vs. Zombies 2</i>!"</p>

<p>"I'll be the judge of that," said Backslash. "Perhaps you could teach me to cook as well, just in general."</p>

<p>"...You can't cook? Or the canon Shulk couldn't?"</p>

<p>Backslash looked visibly uncomfortable, so he tried changing the subject by calling, "Hey Sarah, what did you get?"</p>

<p>"Well..." The Super had peeled off the wrapping of her gift... and found herself hanging onto a giant cask decorated with a Viking motif. "...Let's just say I'm going to have to reserve a vault somewhere in the <i>Incredibles</i> equivalent of Fort Knox, preferably with a laser grid security system and a sixteen-digit combination lock."</p>

<p>Indeed, she and Lapis were trying to hold off a certain angel in a pink toga, who was reaching for the cask with a maniacal expression and screaming "MINEMINEMINEMINEMINEMINEMINEMINEMINEMINE!"</p>

<p>"CUPID, NO!" cried Lapis. "<i>YOU'VE ALREADY HAD YOUR TURN!!!</i>"</p>

<p>"We can do that after this party," said Sarah. "I'm the only one of us who can carry this thing, and I'm certainly going to be keeping an eye on you in case you abuse this stuff. If you blow it off all at once and wreck half of HQ, I'm calling the DIA on your sorry sacred buns. Got it?"</p>

<p>Cupid nodded, still blushing. "I'm sorry for making you mad, Violet," he added to the other angel, before turning to the kraken girl. "I lost control back there, and I'll try not to do that next time. Oh, and Steph? You, me, Arctic Inn, Sunday evening. I hope you're up for ale and a dip!"</p>

            <p>He meandered near-spherically over to the now depleted pile of presents and examined the remains in close detail. With him was a silver bowl, though he would not use it; that, after all, would spoil the surprise and not be at all in keeping with the spirit of the thing. His soft, rather dainty hands ran over the remaining presents, and a keen-eared observer would have noted him mumbling to himself about the possibility of their contents. In the end, however, he turned away and rejoined his partner, the smile on his face only a little bit too wide.</p>

<p>"Miss von Lilith? I believe you have something of mine."</p>

            <p>"And Glitter Girl, it's now your turn to pick something out of the pile."</p>

<p>Eve shrugged, passed the whip to Algie, and moved towards the pile again. This time, she picked up a particularly large box, before taking it back and opening it. Rayner looked inside as well, and then the two of them glanced at each other.</p>

<p>"I am taking these back to my pocket dimension of incarceration and playing them nonstop until you beg for mercy," said E.V.L., grinning.</p>

<p>"I swear to Celestia, Glitter Girl, if you try that load of horse-apples on me, you'll be answering to the Sunflower!"</p>

<p>"Why not? It's not like I can't have fun on weekdays, either."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, <i>your</i> idea of fun synonymous with annoying the dreck out of me even in my sleep! Is that what the Flowers want from you?"</p>

<p>"Considering that I was assigned as your partner to <i>punish</i> you for your little oversight all those months ago, yes."</p>

<p>Rayner facepalmed and growled, "<i>I hate you.</i>"</p>

<p>What was it in the box that had prompted their argument? A set of Hi-Fi speakers... and a triple album labeled "Now Zat's Vhat I Am Callink Oompah!"</p>

            <p>Her horn lit up, and she very carefully levitated a plain black present from near the top of the pile over to her. The pile wobbled three times but did not fall.</p>

<p>"Nice," said Chris. "What'd you get?"</p>

<p>She opened the box...and squeed happily. "A magician's hat!" She took off her ordinary black hat and plopped the top hat on her head. As it was sized for a human, however, it fell down over her glasses, knocking them askew, and also completely covered her ears and horn. "Uh-oh. Um, is there anybody who can resize this for a pony...?"</p>

            <p>When it vanished, the hat was now much smaller and fit Ami perfectly.</p>

<p>"Apologies for that, luv," said William, as he swiftly maneauvered through the crowd. "Should've added somethin' that would detect the head that wears the hat. The only thing it can do is reach into the Hammerspace, so I think that makes up for the size, no?"</p>

<p>VJ looked up from her plate of snickerdoodles, and turned towards the stage where not a lot of gifts were left. "Bah!" She handed William the place and a cup of ice cream. "Hold this, please!"</p>

<p>She hopped onto the stage and took a look around. One perfectly cubed package caught her attention. After a quick unwrap, which consisted of basically shredding the wrapping paper into confetti, VJ was holding a very pretty wooden box. It was salmon pink, polished and lacquered, with a matching lid. Just seconds later, the lid popped off and a small, plushie clown on a spring appeared with a loud "WHEEEEEEEEEEEEE!"</p>

<p>VJ yelped, dropped the box, and jumped away. She was staring at the wobbling jack-in-a-box, hissing like a cat.</p>

<p>Each apparent beat of the song, he pointed at a different gift. “See how he looks down on us like we’re acting out a show, throw the dice, and let’s see which head will roooooll…” He finished on a shaking box a bit bigger than a basketball. “… a present that’s pre-shaken, how thoughtful!” He popped it open, and found himself staring into the single eye of a five-armed metal ball.</p>

<p>“EEEEEEEEEEEEE! IT’S A MINI! MINIMINIMINI!” Valon hugged the mini-Omnidroid, which seemed to be getting rather dizzy from Valon’s overjoyed spinning dance.</p>

Fortunately, since the pile of gifts was much smaller, he could pick a gift from the bottom and not worry about the whole thing collapsing. He opened it carefully... "Oh my God. Please tell me this has virgin recipes in it."</p>

<p>"Wait, what?" his partners asked.</p>

<p>Miguel hung his head and sighed. "We got a book of cocktail recipes and some mixers. A virgin cocktail, if what I read on the Internet is true, is a cocktail without any booze in it. Since I'm fifteen and Chris is technically twelve..."</p>

He delicately grabbed a box in his mouth by the ribbon and carried it back to his spot, where he sat, puzzling at how to go about unwrapping it until the Aviator leaned over and pulled the paper off for him. "Thanks," Zeb said, nosing the lid off. He looked inside to see...</p>

<p>A ball of fur.</p>

<p>He tilted his head. "Um..."</p>

<p>The ball of fur purred and his eyes widened." Is that a Tribble?" he asked, backpedaling away from the box.</p>

<p>The Aviator leaned over to see for herself. "Looks like," she said, scooping it out of the box and cuddling it. "Aren't you a cute little thing?"</p>

He padded over to the pile of presents and picked out a rather heavy one, pushing it along the floor with his nose until the Aviator got up and carried it back for him.</p>

<p>"Opposable thumbs, much?" she muttered.</p>

<p>"Shaddap," he said good-naturedly, and set about ripping the paper off with his teeth. His eyes lit up when he saw what was inside. "New <i>Harry Potter</i> books!"</p>

<p>"It's okay, Lapis," said Sarah. "They're not ACTUAL shark's teeth."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but they still-"</p>

<p>"So, what? She still liked it!" Cupid patted her shoulder. "You don't have to get upset as long as she knows what it really is."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but... my homefic gave me the teeth I have now, remember?" Lapis looked at the floor, sniffling. "I got them after channeling the power of a fan made legendary Pokémon, and they've stuck with me ever since."</p>

<p>"We know, Lapis, and we completely understand," said Sarah, patting her head. "It's just that, well, you're past that now, like we both are with our histories. Get over it," she added with a chuckle.</p>

<p>Lapis snuggled the other girl, still sniffling. "Well, uh, thanks. I guess."</p>

<p>This was about as close as Algie ever got to breaking out the effector fields and turning someone into an art installation, but he remained outwardly calm and smiling. He wandered over to where Lola was still... <i>gyrating</i> (poorly, and to music that only really existed in her head), for want of a better phrase, and produced the pamphlet. He then spent a few minutes trying to make Lola see reason, before sighing and having her march over to the ex-Sue and thrust the whip at her, in a rather sulky fashion not quite befitting the Commander's station.</p>

            <p>In response, the Spy snored gently in his chair. His arms were crossed over his chest and he was tilted precariously to the right in his seat. Harris, who was seated next to him, looked around the room at the other guests. </p>

<p>“It’s your turn, Gaspard. Wake up. “ </p>

<p>Again, he snored. Harris leaned over and poked his colleague with a finger. “Hey, wake up.” No response. Harris got up and tapped Gaspard’s shoulder. “Come on, now...”</p>

<p>Gaspard started leaning more and more to the right. As the inevitable approached, Harris stepped back. “Well, that’s sure to wake him up,” he muttered as Gaspard fell to the floor with a crash. </p>

<p>“Argh.” Gaspard slowly got up and looked at Harris, who wordlessly pointed at the gift pile. He then noticed the entire auditorium staring at him. “O-oh! S-sorry, I, um, I…” He felt his cheeks burn with embarrassment. “I-it’s just th-that I had a, um, long day, er, <i>days</i> and I haven’t had m-much, er, time to… um… sleep, and I’ve not b-been having the best times recently, and, em…”</p>

<p>“Just grab your present, Gaspard,” said Harris as he regained his seat. “C’mon, keep it moving.”</p>

<p>“O-okay… Sorry…” Gaspard quickly made his way to the pile of gifts, staring at his shoes all the while. He selected the first thing that he saw—a medium-sized box—and quickly shuffled back to his seat. </p>

<p><i>Cheer up,</i> he thought to himself. <i>You should be happy that you got a present. You don’t want to look like an ingrate, do you? Smile. Remember to smile. Be normal. Smile, and be happy. Whatever is inside</i> will<i> make you happy. It’s going to make up for the awful day you’ve been having.</i></p>

<p>Still conscious that all eyes were on him, he slowly lifted the lid. It was weighted and seemed to be holding something down. A small wheeze escaped from inside the box. He swallowed nervously and opened the box. He was greeted by a Pandora’s Box of wailing, squealing rubber chickens. After the infernal noise died down, Gaspard was left looking at the box, lid still in his hands. </p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said quietly to whomever was the owner of his box and, for reasons he didn’t quite understand, dissolved into a giggling fit, pausing occasionally to draw breath and wipe tears from his eyes. </p>

            <p>Wobbles couldn't help herself. She joined in with the other agent's slightly manic laughter and walked over to him, bouncing up to hang her dream catcher on a convenient stacked chair. Yes, the ducks were funny, but there was an edge to that laugh that she knew all too well, and all the more for how vividly she remembered it.</p>

<p>She put an arm around him as his giggling fit died away, the lights on her bow tie turned off and the comedy squeakers in her shoes silenced with a deft flick of a toe. "Y'know," she said softly, "I've been where you are. I know how to spot when someone's there. So have a.little extra gift from me, and if you're struggling at all, day or night, just... know that you don't have to go it alone all the time. Okay?"</p>

And she tugged at her ear and began to produce a string of flags-of-all-nations, enough to wind around her entire arm. "See? Proof. Besides, take it as a sign that you don't have to be alone if you don't want to be."</p>

<p>She smiled, and fought desperately to refrain from giving him another hug. She could see what was wrong with him, but more than that, she could <i>feel</i> it, rolling off him in black waves. Everything he said was hollow and forced, the brittle, self-effacing politeness an act she'd seen a lot of people use during her time in FicPsych. She'd only ever suffered from Suvian depression, but this was quite self-evidently the real deal.</p>

            <p>Gaspard very carefully folded the handkerchief and placed it on top of the box. He felt that it would be rude to cram it in a pocket in front of Wobbles.

            <p>"Come in number seven, your time is up," Lola muttered under her breath. She'd rather lucked out, in her estimation of things; not right at the start when everyone was staring and all excited, but not so low down that she'd only be left with the presents that spat sparks. She bounced amiably up to the stage and managed to avoid tripping on the mike, and looked up and down at the presents. Algie's big lump of a thing was supporting a few of the others, so that was out. Hm. What was another box...</p>

<p>Her gaze alighted on a disc-shaped present at the bottom. Intrigued, she selected it and finally unwrapped it. And there it was. A Sue whip, made of 100% ethically-sourced glitter-powered abomination. She ran her fingers gently along the length of it, feeling how the hair was still salon-soft, despite having been hacked off the Suvian or Suvians in question some time ago and still containing flecks of glitter, sparkling like hot pink diamonds.</p>

<p>Then a bad thing happened. A very, very bad thing. It was very easy to tell how bad of a thing it was, because of how much Lola was grinning.</p>

<p>"I WHIP MY HAIR BACK AN' FORTH, I WHIP MY HAIR BACK AN' FORTH, I WHIP MY HAIR BACK AN' FORTH, I WHIP MY HAIR BACK AN' FORTH..."</p>

<p>Algie, who knew how to look for the signs of the Commander breaking into song, had quietly sidled off to the impromptu bar at the back.</p>

            <p>VJ, who was also attacking the mini-bar, looked at Algie. She was holding a small paper plate full of snickerdoodles. Crumbs on her shirt, and around her mouth, suggested that some of the cookies have already met their doom.</p>

<p>"Making that whip was fun," she said. "Even months after the mission, the hair stayed supple enough to be woven. The only problem was the shape; those stupid locks seemed to have the memory of always staying perfect, so every single time they would simply turn into curls."</p>

But it brings the Commander evident and keenly-felt pleasure, and for that you have my deepest thanks. As, I am sure, you have hers." The round little man drained his glass and smiled. "May I get you anything? The wine list is a little sparse since last week's incursion into Stores, but there's a rather daring Montrachet '06 on offer that I wholeheartedly recommend. An underrated year, in my opinion, and worth further consideration."</p>

There was no need to deliberate; every box was covered with a gift wrap, so why not just let Lady Luck decide? The box that William grabbed was wrapped in black paper and dark red ribbon. </p>

<p>"Oh? What do we have here? Let me see..." He reached into the box, and pulled out... a skull. Seemingly a human skull, except for the front part which had way more eye sockets than necessary. Seventy-nine, to be exact. William grabbed the skull with one hand, and raised it slightly above his head. He then put his other hand against his forehead, and looked at VJ. "Alas, poor Yorick!

The skull suddenly escaped William's palms, and smoothly levitated next to the man's head.</p>

<p>"Adds to the whole 'Master of the Dark Arts' vibe, doesn't it?" William smiled, and the skull opened its mouth. Trail of green smoke came out of it, briefly formed into a snake, and dispersed as quickly as it appeared.</p>

<p>"Well, that explains why it threw me halfway across the room when I tried to use it," said Backslash. "I'm not so concerned about the batteries, though, but rather the fact that those guys don't have a game to go with it!"</p>

<p>Whitney facepalmed. "<i>That's</i> what I was missing! I'll tell you what, uh, Chris? That's you, isn’t it? I'll send you a game disc for <i>Wii Fit</i> as soon as I can, and one for <i>Wii Fit U</i> as well to compensate for today."</p>

<p>Backslash reached over to Cupid with his scarf and poked him in the side. "Uh, Drunky? It’s your turn."</p>

<p>"Huh? Oh! Right, coming!"</p>

<p>A few moments later, the angel had brought back a rather large box. He tore the wrapping to shreds, opened it up, and-</p>

<p><i>"THIS! IS! SPARTAAAAAA!!!"</i></p>

<p>Lapis, as usual, screamed in terror and leaped onto Rayner’s head. It was then that the two agents noticed the words "BOX OF MEMES" written on the side of the box.</p>

<p>Cupid stared into the contents of said box for several moments, during which they let ouy more memetic cries of "AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA", "PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME", "HEEEEEYAAAAAAAAA", etc. Then he shut the box and stared off into space.</p>

<p>"...I have mixed feelings about this."</p>

<p>The tall agent calmed down just enough to put words together. "Heheheh... yeah, I basically just shoved an MLG compilation in there." What appeared to be a Magnemite, with a baseball cap and a hashtag in place of one of its magnets, escaped from the box and floated around Cupid. "Congratulations, Pitthree, you now have a pet Swagnemite!"</p>

<p>He suddenly noticed someone else in the room, and nudged his wife with a whisper. "Hey, Kala..." He pointed out Lola. "Doesn't she look familiar to you?"</p>

The road trip there and unpacking all my stuff was the reason I wasn't available to post earlier, so I apologize if you were expecting something sooner. Anyway, I've decided to challenge myself for this Gift Exchange - since I have no less than nine agents participating, I want to see if none of them gets a gift from each other, i.e. each of them gets a gift originally sent in from an agent from another Boarder. With that, let's get started!</p>

<p>As a reminder, the rules for the Gift Exchange can be found <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=288254;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here.</a>)</p>

<p>"D'awwww," the Skarmory cooed, stepping forward towards the massive pile and singling out a rather small present.</p>

<p>"Adam, you featherbrain, it's 'awe', not 'aww'!" called Sarah, facepalming with a laugh. "With an 'e'!"</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> that!" Falchion replied. "I already awed at the pile in general, but I think this little shiny box looks pretty cute! Y'know what, I'm taking it."</p>

<p>Picking the box up in one of his talons, he hopped back to his place in the crowd, pecked it open, and pulled out...</p>

<p>...a gun.</p>

<p>"Oookay, not as cute..."</p>

            <p>"Hey, it's cute enough-- especially when you realize that this thing is ridiculously overpowered. It's a R8 revolver from a previous patch of that new <i>Counter-Strike</i> game," said the Guardsman. "Completely broken. You load it with .357 Magnum but it hits harder than a fifty-cal round. Seriously. It's fantastic! It can one-shot a humanoid target in the head, chest, arms, and stomach at mid-to-long range regardless of if your target is wearing body armour or not. Doesn't matter if your Suvian target is protecting itself with armour, a shield, a brick wall, whatever-- the R8 is going to punch right through it. Have fun with that and don't point it at your friends.</p>

<p>"Just, uh... it's obviously not loaded at the moment and I didn't have enough spare change to buy some ammo. You're gonna have to get it yourself."</p>

<p>"Falchion, are you sure about this?" asked Lapis, sweat-dropping and soaking her shirt. "I kinda doubt you'll be good with firearms even with an aim that good."</p>

<p>"Hey, I'm turning 23 this year. I'm 100-percent sure."</p>

<p>BLAM! A button-sized hole appeared on the ceiling, making Lapis scream and hide behind Cupid’s wing.</p>

<p>Falchion yelped and put the revolver down. "...99-percent sure."</p>

<p>((OOC: Having had a look at the gift list... er, Skarm, would you care to explain why Algie's gimmick (his fascination with Bleeport has long been a characteristic) that he can't get to remain stable (<i>also</i> a defining characteristic) is currently in possession of someone he's never bloody met?

            <p>(AFAIK, the only similarity I see between Cupid and Algie is their drinking habit, and that is a complete coincidence because I didn't know Algie even existed when I wrote the first few missions with Cupid. The fic I sporked in the mission that led to Cupid’s creation featured Pit getting a nasty drinking habit among other things when the memory sickness affected him. I picked Bleeport as his signature drink because it fit the Greek theme (I don’t recall vodka or whiskey being a thing in the Hellenistic era), but Cupid has never once experimented with it even if he knows the cultivars. I picked Chardonnay because I wanted an expensive wine cultivar, and that was the first to come to my head.</p>

<p>At the interest of distinguishing Cupid’s gift from Algie's, though, I've changed the former to a six-pack of Drinks of the Gods, from <i>Kid Icarus: Uprising</i>. I apologize for the confusion. :C</p>

<p>Also, for all future turns, can participants please reply to the introductory post rather than to the post with the previous turn? This way, it'll be easier for us to keep track of whose turn it is.</p>

            <p>Alright. My first mission is now written. Now I&#39;m ready for the next stage, beta checking, hoping I&#39;ll fare better than Ubisoft about this. SpaG and flow are the things the more important for me, but feel free to raise any point you find grating. Dresden Files knowledge would be a nice bonus, but do not let that stop you from posting if you want a seat to the party.<br><br>My address can be clicked if you want to email me directly. Or you can post your candidature here, whatever you prefer.</p>

            <p>I am here to announce that there is a project going on, to summarize it is an radio play alternate version of the Doctor who movie. Me and a friend have been planning and working on this since September, and the script for episode 1 is just about done. In this version of the movie, our goal is to make it better: we are striving to take out the bad logic, the racism, the plot holes, have the Master not be a booger-monster, have character development where it needs to be, etc. This Whoniverse Adventure is called &quot;Doctor Who: New Millennium.&quot;<br><br>We still need roles for the first episode to be filled. As this is a radio play, only voices will be needed. Experienced betas will be needed soon after we finish with the script for episode 1. I will list the characters for the first episode including if possible the names of taken roles, and if you want to take part, tell me and put your email in your reply so I can give it to the producer so she can contact you. There will be future episodes of course, so you could audition for those as well later.<br><br>Cast List (in order of appearance):<br><br>Seventh Doctor (Taken)<br>Master (producer&#39;s sister)<br>Rassilon (Matt Cipher)<br>Lieutenant Mi&#39;Roan, an alien<br>Chang Lee (producer&#39;s brother)<br>Gang Member 1<br>Gang Member 2<br>Grace Holloway (me!)<br>Brian, Grace&#39;s jerk boyfriend<br>Nurse Informer/Intern<br>Harvey, Nurse Practitioner<br>Ted, an employee<br>Pete, another employee (taken)<br>Eighth Doctor (producer)<br>Skinner, Grace&#39;s boss<br><br>If you are a girl and can make your voice deep enough, you could get a male part if you want one. The producer is female, for example, and she has a deep voice.<br><br>So! Anyone interested? The parts that don&#39;t say taken or have a name beside them are open. And again, betas will be needed soon to proofread the first script.</p>

On the other hand, Absol&#39;s a pretty damn good physical attacker anyway, if a little fragile, and Clockwork Chainaxe gives every physical contact move a +25% Damage bonus and a 50% chance to break through Reflect and/or Light Screen. Give your Absol the ability Super Luck and the moves Night Slash, Hone Claws, Stone Edge, and either Superpower or Play Rough, depending on what you think you&#39;re going to be facing.

            <p>Bakugan? I watched up to New Vestroia, dabbled a bit in Gundalian Invaders, and I have an unopened Dragonoid Colossus. You could say I know a lot about Bakugan, I might have it as a plot point in my series, if I get around to doing things. Back in school, I used to play Bakugan a lot, won a few championships at the Toys R Us..... I started with a Pyrus Percival. Yeah.</p>

Another useful resource you might use is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki&lt;br%20/&gt;">the Wiki</a>; if you have any questions, just look here before asking. We like it when newbies do the research. ;)<br><br>Also, a few questions: what are your fandoms, and do you have a preferred pronoun?<br><br>Hope you like it here!</p>

            <p>Ok. I&#39;m a guy, and I generally know some things. I&#39;m not exactly a hardcore fan of anything, so if anything really pops up, I&#39;ll let you know. Generally, I know a bit about Star Wars, Pokémon, LoTR, things like that. This list will just get longer and longer as time goes on. Just wait and see. I might not be posting much until I can figure out how the account thing works. I try to post something, have to log in, go to post something, and I have to log in again. Got any help for that?</p>

            <p>&#39;ullo, folks. I&#39;m Larfen J. Stocke, esq, as some of you more observant (or, perhaps, telepathically gifted) fellows might have figured. <br>I&#39;ve spent quite some time knocking around the PPC wiki, reading stories and laughing at them and whatnot, though I haven&#39;t officially joined the board until now, out of a mixture of cowardice and apathy, which I now realise don&#39;t exactly paint my character in a good, or even half-decent light. I can hope for comically pitiful, at best. I have been rather lacking in conversations with people who enjoy writing as of late (talking to myself in the mirror just isn&#39;t fun anymore,) and I&#39;m at the point where you&#39;ve all gained semi-deific status to me, and I hope my offerings will prove suitable.<br>I still have the nightmares.<br>I&#39;ve had the FAQ:For Newbies on my laptop screen for the last hour or so, as it gives me comfort, and I hope you, too, feel comfort, knowing that I have read the PPC Constitution, most of the Original Series, and/or the variety of other helpful materials you have prepared for me.<br>I enjoy anything by Terry Pratchett, especially Good Omens, the book that inspired me to get off my lazy arse and turn &#39;considering getting into writing&#39; into &#39;failing horribly at writing&#39;, and I&#39;d like to say that I&#39;m a big fan of Discworld, but that might not be fair, because I&#39;ve only entirely read one book so far, and seen one animated adaptation where they gave Nobby a backwards baseball cap. What. Consider me a pre-fan, if you must.<br>I also bloody love H.P. Lovecraft, the casual racism occasionally present in his works heavily appealing to the Australian in me.<br>The other things I enjoy are probably too obscure, dumb, or limited to count as having fandoms: Lisa the Painful, Jules Verne&#39;s stuff, Dwarf Fortress, Deus Ex and Catch-22. I love that book. You don&#39;t understand how much I love that bloody book.<br>I found the PPC through a mixture of Das Sporking, TV Tropes, and my own love of snark.<br>I feel like this was too long. I have no idea what is happening. Please don&#39;t judge me. Or, at least, do it really quietly. Unless you&#39;ve got soundproof walling. Judge as loudly as you want, then, I suppose.<br>pleasedontjudgeme</p>

You put two Berries in (Berry Juice doesn&#39;t work, alas) and give it to your &#39;mon, and when it drops down to the relevant level of health, one gets consumed. Each time you consume one, there&#39;s a 50% chance it gets replicated, though without the 100% chance in sunlight, alas. It&#39;s an interesting item and useful on sweepers, so try putting two Chesto Berries in it and give it Surf, Ice Beam, Dragon Pulse, and Rest. You should be extremely survivable, if you invest your EVs in HP, Special Attack, and Speed, but it takes a lot to beat out Eviolite on a not-fully-evolved &#39;mon like Seadra. Does it? Try it and find out! =]</p>

            <p>I fear my sleep schedule has, yet again, prevented another young soul from being introduced to the glorious world of wonders that is H.P. Lovecraft. <br>My personal favourites are: The Rats in the Walls, the Case of Charles Dexter Ward, and Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath (though, that one is less eldritch-wizardy spookiness and more weird fantasy.) Honestly, though, I haven&#39;t found a single story of his I haven&#39;t liked. Man&#39;s brilliant. </p>

            <p>... because I got to read the edited version.<br><br>Then I’m even later, because you made me reading the badfic (that’s potentially a bad thing) in an attempt to understand what’s going on.<br><br>So, I liked Kala and Valon’s interactions, the switching that made the obvious replacement actually Harry’s uncanonical twin, and the Mythbuster testing. But the mission didn’t really work for me, because some parts seem rushed and not well thought trough.<br><br><u>Technical errors first:</u><br><br><i>His eyes went wide, before he frantically <b>covered covered</b> his ears.</i><br>Repetition.<br><br>Where did this mini-Stu come from? Throughout the badfic, Harry’s twin is consistently called <b>Micheal</b>, so this is just an unusual name, not a misspelling of what you may have expected to be the Stu’s name. Actually, you are misspelling the Stu’s name throughout the mission.<br><br><i>Kala had decided that it was <b>past time to stop asking</b> where he got things.</i><br>So there was no sense in stopping now, but then she didn’t ask? (Double negation.)<br><br><u>Overthinking things:</u><br><br><b>What happened to the <i>entity pretending to be God</i>? </b><br><br>&quot;God&quot; promptly vanishing at the end of the first chapter, leaving only &quot;Lucifer&quot; and &quot;Reaper&quot; to be neuralyzed is a bit too convenient for my taste. I don’t see anything in the badfic that justifies this event. (If it was just because his role in the story was finished, why didn’t &quot;Lucifer&quot; and &quot;Reaper&quot; vanish too?) <br><br>Actually, it is quite inconvenient. This is not the biblical God (His existence in the Potterverse despite never being mentioned in canon is at least debatable), nor a god specific to the Potterverse. How can canon reassert itself unless this uncanonical entity is thoroughly removed? And your agents just allowed it to escape. It certainly didn’t remove itself when it &quot;vanished&quot;, it just went elsewhere.<br><br>Potential solution: Since this isn’t a god from any recognizable canon, it doesn’t get omnipotence per its canon of origin’s definition; incidentally being called &quot;God&quot; doesn’t make you invulnerable, and the badfic never implied that this entity is invincible. Actually, it appears to be quite weak, depending on its siblings. (They brought the Stu to &quot;Heaven&quot; and did most of the talking, implying that they would and could do what they talked about intending to do. All &quot;God&quot; did was making the Stu remember the flashback and all it talked about was its plan of passively letting the Stu kill people.) Why not just shoot it and then neuralyze the others and send them home?<br><br><b>What happened to Harry?</b><br><br>Since Springtrap was actually Micheal, the brat he met at Gringott’s was actually Harry. So, Harry is a spoiled brat who grew up with his parents, who should be dead. Shouldn’t something be done about this? Was this all covered by <i>neuralyzing other canons and putting Lily and James back in their graves</i>?<br><br><b>Why was tying up Springtrap so easy? And blowing him up, too?</b><br><br>He got super strength (the strength of ten man), and agility and speed (faster than the fastest human), and he can cause powerful hallucinations to scare humans off. Now, Kala isn’t human, and I don’t remember exactly how strong and fast she is, so I can’t say that it is impossible.<br><br>He also was able &quot;to interfere with the workings of technology&quot;, apparently in a non-physical way. Why didn’t he simply disarm this Big Red Button? Well, he was six years old when he was killed, and had only one month after waking up. How much could he possibly have learned about technology and the best way of interfering with a remote control that will trigger an explosion when the button is pressed? Again I can’t say that blowing him up is impossible, but I would have liked to see this addressed in the mission.<br><br>And although I said that I liked the Mythbuster testing, I would have appreciated if Kala and Valon, after tying the Stu up, had tested whether it’s possible to cut and smash him with hand-held sharp respective blunt objects. Sure, he had asked for immunity to blunt and sharp objects, but then &quot;God&quot; forgot to tell the Stu about the abilities he got without asking, and Plushtrap had to do all this exposition about his and Springtrap’s joined and unique abilities, and when it came to physical impact after all the overpowered magical and elemental stuff, all we heard was &quot;we cannot be harmed by projectiles&quot;. There is no implication that this list isn’t conclusive, so &quot;God&quot; or its siblings apparently forgot to give the Stu what he had asked for.<br><br>Yeah, exploiting a badfic’s weaknesses is far too much fun. Why did you make me read this thing and spend a whole afternoon on this?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Technical errors: addressed.<br><br>&quot;God&quot;: I wasn&#39;t sure how to handle that. Have him just go poof once his negligible role was completed was the best solution I could think of.<br><br>Harry: Yes, cleanup is always covered in summary. I don&#39;t usually feel like detailing the time between the execution and the return home.<br><br>Tying up Springtrap: Yes, Kala herself is superhumanly strong. I have yet to show the full extent of her strength, but consider this: harpies, the smallest and lightest of liminals in Monster Musume, are strong enough to fly normally while carrying a human-sized load. Kala weighs almost six times more than a harpy.<br><br>She&#39;s also insanely tough; I&#39;ve yet to include this detail in a PPC story, but all of her vital organs (aside from her brain) are in her scorpion half, behind her two-inch-thick, bulletproof carapace. Her human body is all bone and muscle.<br><br>Also, he&#39;s not tied up in rope; he&#39;s tied up with det-cord. Det-cord is an explosive material itself, so Valon probably wouldn&#39;t want himself or Kala to smack it around.<br><br>The Big Red Button: I figure that Springtrap was too far away to mess with it. Valon watches Mythbusters, he knows that there&#39;s no such thing as being too far from an explosion.</p>

            <p>I usually start with the positives, but in this case, please pardon the departure from the norm, as I believe this error (made twice) needs to be addressed first. <br>Twice, you mention characters in such a way that we should have already been introduced to them...when said mention is the very first mention of the character. To wit:<br><br><i>Michael… sadly, he can’t live. He enables too much of this fic to occur, and he can’t assimilate into canon.</i><br>At this point in the mission, the reader has <i>never</i> seen the name &quot;Michael&quot; yet. It&#39;s only in the next scene that we find out that Michael is Harry&#39;s uncanonical brother. But the way Valon says this line, it is obvious that Valon and Kala know who Michael is. I&#39;d suggest moving this line further into the mission.<br><br><i>Spring-Harry… sorry, Spring-</i>Michael<i> and Blair Blacking will conveniently be in a place for us to deal with them at the same time.</i><br>Same thing. The reader never got introduced to Blair Backing before, so the reader has no idea why she needs to be dealt with.<br><br>One more error, a minor one in comparison:<br><i>I think we can confirm; the Spring-Bonnie suit was replaced as well.</i><br>Delete the semicolon or rewrite as follows: &quot;I think we can confirm it: the Spring-Bonnie suit was replaced as well.&quot;<br><br>That said, onto the positives: Aside from the major errors (I had to use CTRL-F to make sure that I didn&#39;t somehow miss a mention), I was not lost in your mission; I could follow it well. And the double-replacement&#39;s death was a stroke of brilliance. Even the most OP of Stus has a weakness.<br><br>One question: When you were writing this fic, did you consider charging for the many comma splices throughout the fic?</p>

            <p>While I liked parts of this, I really don&#39;t think this was your best work. The agents did a lot of standing around talking, but I don&#39;t remember once getting a sense for what they were doing while talking. It gave me the impression that they were just standing out in the open where anyone could see them.<br><br>And then there&#39;s the inclusion of Truth. Since he appears to be on a godlike level from what cursory research I&#39;ve done, I can understand why he&#39;d know about the PPC... but the question I have is why did you include him in this story when there&#39;s not so much as a hint of FMA anywhere in the fic? The fact that you dragged a canon cross-continuum for seemingly no reason other than because it seemed cool... well, we have a department for that for a reason.<br><br>Everything else was good and I enjoyed the rest, but Truth especially just kind of ruined it for me.</p>

            <p>This shouldn’t be surprising, because I don’t know anything about <i>RWBY</i>. Astonishingly enough, I could follow the events quite well, until this happened:<br><br><i>The Aviator waited while Zeb opened a portal and disappeared through it, pulling a DVD copy of volume one out of her pockets.</i><br>Was Zeb suddenly genderbent, did he actually pull the DVD out of the Aviator’s pockets, or was this the Aviator pulling the DVD out of her pockets while she waited for something?<br><br><i>Zeb closed the portal behind her and approached the Stu.</i> <br>So Zeb was genderbent? Silly me! The Aviator pulled the DVD out of her pocket while she waited for Zeb opening the portal and disappearing through it, so that she could follow, and then Zeb closed the portal behind her.<br><br>Only at the beginning of the next page I realized that actually the Aviator had disappeared through the portal while pulling out the DVD, and Zeb didn’t pass through a portal before he approached the Stu. Putting a comma between &quot;Zeb opened a portal&quot; and &quot;and disappeared through it&quot; might have spared me a lot of trouble, although the sentence still looks a bit weird.<br><br>Fun mission.

            <p>I liked the joke about the Wassailia candles and the Festivus pole. I don&#39;t remember what the Feats of Strength are, exactly, but I bet seeing Zeb try to complete them would be hilarious anyway. :)<br><br>I guess it was only a matter of time till RWBY got a straight-up bad anime OC, given how anime-like it already is. Has somebody written a story about where Ren came from? I know Jaune&#39;s from another part of Remnant, but I <i>think</i> Ren&#39;s from the equivalent of China as well...? Gosh, I need to get back into RWBY.</p>

            <p>Hello to all! I go by theskylarksings on various places around the web, Sky for short if you&#39;re feeling lazy (I am). I&#39;m an American female fangirl who enjoys the worlds of Middle-earth and Narnia, the universes of Star Wars and Star Trek, and various &#39;real-world&#39; whatnots, including but not limited to BBC Sherlock and Marvel. I also do my own world building and original fiction on and off. <br><br>So I somehow or other stumbled upon the Wikia (some divine force must have sucked me in from Googleing a Mary Sue test for a friend) and subsequently read the Original Series (all hail Jay and Acadia!). I just wanna say: <i>Your purpose and mission speak to me on a personal level. </i> Seriously. Even the Flowers That Be thing doesn&#39;t faze me as much as it should. <br><br>I read the Constituion and a few other things, and my Agent is in development! I&#39;ll go through the paperwork of officially joining once I get my character shipshape and super. <br><br>So, yeah. Hiya! Ciao! Salam! Aloha! Yo! I&#39;m running out of languages! </p>

As your newbie gift, please take this plate of freshly-made SPaGhetti!<br><br>Since you&#39;ve already answered the usual questions I ask, allow me to ask you one: Are you planning on only one agent? The general recommended number is two, since agents work in pairs (and occasionally teams).

            <p>We do let people who don&#39;t have Permission write under people who <i>do</i>, but if your friend(s) want(s) to write mission as a full-on partner, they&#39;ll have to get Permission eventually as well.<br><br>If my original writing partner hadn&#39;t eventually handed the reins over to me for her agent, she would have needed to get Permission too.

            <p>First thing&#39;s first - I absolutely adore my paternal grandmother. Many times she has proven herself to be the greatest human being in the world; whether it&#39;s supplying us with delicious food when we&#39;re to lazy to cook, or supporting me when I was going through some pretty heavy issues, I always had this spritely 4&#39;11 woman to be there with me.<br><br>She has surprised me many times, as well. One of the more controversial topics in Poland is if marijuana should be legal, and most of the elderly are of course against it (there&#39;s also politics and the Church trying to influence the government, but that&#39;s a storm for another time); it surprised me to hear that Gran is for the personal usage of cannabis. Another surprise was when we were watching an old historical drama - <i>I, Claudius</i>. Gran totally caught me off-guard with the amount of knowledge she had about the Roman Empire, it&#39;s history and all the emperors!<br><br>But the greatest surprise thus far came today. I stopped by for tea, as I sometimes do, and out of boredom we started surfing through the channels. We&#39;ve stumbled upon one station airing <i>The Two Towers</i>, so naturally I started watching, while Gran was making tea for us. It was soon before the Helm&#39;s Deep battle, when Saruman was making gunpowder. Gran looked at the TV and asked, pointing at Saruman, &quot;Is he a mage?&quot;<br><br>And we eneded up having a commentary for the rest of the film, with me very briefly explaining the lore of Middle-earth and providing some non-spoilery information. I got some funny comments from this, as well. Couple of times Gran mistook Merry and Pippin for Sam and Frodo, thought that the One Ring was originally made by Men (when Faramir said that it belongs to them), and asked if the Elves have any sort of magic of their own. That was funny, but what can you expect from someone who has never read any of the books or seen the films. <br><br>At the end we agreed to marathon the entire trilogy in the future :D</p>

            <p>A Multiversal Singularity is a character from a continuum with multiple universes, namely the Transformers continuity, who exist as the same consciousness throughout all universes that encompasses the Continuum. About 15 transformers (Primus, Unicron, and the 13 original transformers, notably Vector Prime), a spark, a computer, and some artifacts of the primes formerly existed in this manner.<br><br>My question is how should these characters be treated in badfic: Like the TARDIS or in some other manner.</p>

            <p>In case you missed it, here&#39;s the deal: in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=287661;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">a discussion about how to designate new Legendary Badfics</a>, we came up with the following criteria:<br><br>1. The fic is at least [three? five?] years old.<br>2. The fic gets a decent number of Google hits from the past year, indicating that people are still talking about it. (You can select &quot;Past year&quot; in Search Tools.)<br> * A &quot;decent number&quot; is at least 5 within the first two pages of results, i.e. 5 out of 20, on the assumption that there are probably more hidden in the depths.<br>* Ideally, the search should be performed without quotation marks.<br>* Hits on/related to a PPC mission to the fic don&#39;t count. 3. The fic is famous in its own right, not because of the author/sequel/prequel/fanart/whatever.<br>4. A majority of PPCers with an opinion agree that it is bad.<br><br>As you can see, the age of the fic is not decided, so what do you think? Should a fic up for Legendary status be at least five years old, or at least three years old?<br><br>My vote is for five years. If people are still talking about a thing on the Internet five years later, it&#39;s definitely not just a flash in the pan.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>However, something else has come to my attention: <i>Subjugation</i> doesn&#39;t fit criterion 2. A search for &quot;subjugation fanfic&quot; (no quotes) only turns up three results for it in the first 20 (not counting the PPC wiki page or a blank TV Tropes page), <i>without</i> limiting it to the past year. Specifying &quot;subjugation harry potter fanfic&quot; gets it to 7... until I drop it to the last year, when it changes to only one. So, uh... it kinda ought to be dropped. (Sorry, Nesh.)<br>But, yeah, five years. I was going to go for three, but then I tested the current legendaries, and they&#39;ve stood the test of five years, so I figure we may as well go more restrictive.</p>

            <p>Agony in Pink: six hits in first two pages (no quotes, last year). Written 16/11/1994 (!). Definitely still Legendary.<br>Celebrian: Only three hits (&quot;celebrian fanfic&quot;, no quotes). Missioned, so in by grandfather clause, I guess.<br>Cho Chang&#39;s Desires: Basically nothing left, as discussed. Remove?<br>Cloud Mows the Lawn: eight hits. Stays.<br>Cupcakes: Difficult to tell, given how many fanfics have &quot;Cupcakes&quot; in their name, but it brings up images on the &quot;All&quot; tab. I&#39;m not going to argue with this one.<br>Draco&#39;s Christmas Cuppa: Nothing within the past year. I read it, and it really just seems like an average bleepfic. *shrugs*<br>Land before Time: Littlefoot x Cera: Again, nothing. However, this would definitely qualify for grandfathering after Trojie and Pads&#39; epic battle with it.<br>legolas by laura: Been over this. Its resilience is impressive.<br>Lion King Orgy Poem: Nothing. Remove?<br>Little Miss Mary: Two hits, one of which is the fic. It&#39;s old, so the fic itself being the top result is actually impressive. Should probably be grandfathered.<br>My Immortal: Has a <i>Wikipedia page</i>. Even competing with the song it&#39;s named for, it eats up half the first  page of results. It&#39;s Legendary.<br>Subjugation: Been over this. Probably grandfather due to in-universe mass agent snapping.<br>Rose Potter: One hit with &quot;Rose Potter&quot;. Nothing with &quot;the girl who lived&quot;. However, it&#39;s so well-known that it needs to stay.<br>Marrissa Picard: No hits. Not sure what to do with this.<br>That Series: Nothing. *sigh*<br><br>So, what now? Do we form a committee? Have a vote? Any thoughts on any of the above? Am I overstepping my authority?</p>

            <p>Sorry for not being orderly about it.<br><br>I&#39;m going to argue that CCD <i>had</i> indeed been quite the thing years and years ago, before it was deleted- there&#39;s a reason it was notorious. Same with DCC. <br><br>The same with the Marrissa Picard fics- those I had encountered MSTs of years and years before I found the PPC; they were well enough in plenty of other sporking rings that for a few of them your own rendition was practically a rite of passage, I can only remember one person who was actually lunatic enough to MST <i>all</i> of them.<br><br>As for the LKOP, I still have to this day no idea where it surfaced from, beyond the suspicion that it might have been a Laburnum addition.<br><br>Beyond that, I have to state for the record that the internet changes, and so do fandoms.

            <p>I find you can usually tell if a fanfic is going to be bad from the first chapter. Agony in Pink has the main villain being subtly warped to get the poorly-written torture porn going; Rose Potter has the title character being obscenely vicious and OP; Hogwarts Exposed has the nipple-biting scene; legolas by laura and My Immortal are obvious trainwrecks; etc., etc.<br>Latias&#39; Journey... starts with a dream of a wedding, introduces a villain, and generally does what a story should. Apparently there&#39;s superfluous rape later on, but... it seems overall pretty average. And they&#39;re not called Legendary Average Fanfics.<br>So what makes it bad? Convince me. (And I&#39;ll keep reading it, too - might change my mind).</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been mentioned a few times that on the Internet, things tend to drop out of the public mindset. If we were being strictly logical about this, we&#39;d work out some kind of formula - like, &#39;for each three years over the five year limit, remove one required hit from Google, down to a minimum of one&#39; (meaning that a &#39;new&#39; LB over 17 years old would only need to get one hit in the top two pages - which would be pretty impressive, actually!).<br><br>I don&#39;t know how old C<em>l</em>br<strong>n is. I know it existed in 2002, because it was already Legendary before the PPC existed. Under the above formula, that would mean it only needs two hits in the top 20 to qualify, making it come in at 150% of the requirement. (No, I didn&#39;t craft the requirement to fit!)<br><br>Things will always get talked about less, especially when - as with C<em>l</em>br</strong>n - they&#39;ve always been quite tricky to find the text of. I think allowing a little leeway for older stories is perfectly fine.<br><br>(Also, you&#39;re wrong about Marrissa Picard - Google automatically &#39;corrects&#39; your spelling. If you <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=Marrissa+Picard&amp;nfpr=1">tell it to actually search for what you typed</a>, she seems to be the <i>only</i> hit.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I just do not know if anything would ever really reach the five year mark in this era.  Take for example, something like the so-called Bountygate Scandal in the NFL.  This was a huge deal, about five years ago, and it is rarely brought up again, it stopped being talked about no more than two years after the event, and was relegated to an after thought.  Same thing goes for the Deflategate Scandal from earlier this NFL season.  These are huge things that have fallen out of the public consciousness in relatively short time.   </p>

            <p>From my perspective, the argument is that those things are no longer being talked about because they weren&#39;t ever really that important. I don&#39;t know about Bountygate, but Deflategate pretty much boils down to &quot;Some guy cheated, got caught and tried to deny it, but everyone knows he did it.&quot; Case closed, end of discussion. In the grand scheme of importance, it doesn&#39;t hold a candle to, say, Watergate, which was so huge that people have started a trend of naming trivial events after it in an attempt to puff them up and make them sound bigger than they actually are.<br><br>(Seriously, what is up with people naming everything after Watergate these days?)<br><br>In the fanfic sphere, I&#39;d equate Deflategate to yet another &quot;My Immortal&quot; clone. It might get people in the fandom wailing for a while, but in the end it&#39;s just another &quot;My Immortal&quot; clone, and its infamy will never rival the original. This is as it should be.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Certainly agree with everything being gate, but that&#39;s what the internet does.  My main point is that five years and the internet is very hard to make.  I think three years still shows what we want shown.  As has been said, even three years in this era of the internet is ancient.  </p>

            <p>For the record, I&#39;m not terribly fussed if the result ends up being three years. If that happens, I get to claim &quot;Blood Raining Night&quot; right away instead of waiting another year and a half.

            <p>To be honest, this is more to do with recent fandoms not being left out, but there could perhaps be provisos made for such cases - Cupcakes, for instance, only <i>barely</i> fits the five-year criterion now, based on the earliest possible date, and there&#39;s no doubt that that piece of... <i>work</i> is a Legendary Badfic.

            <p>Long charge lists are boring to read through. Too-short charge lists miss on important stuff. I&#39;d say shorter is better than longer. For example:<br><blockquote>“Nova, I charge you with genocide, murder, grand hypocrisy, terrorism, trivialization of trauma and the previous crimes, banalisation of mass murder, and disgracing the name Takamachi Nanoha. The sentence is death.”</blockquote> This works, and any additional word will take from the effect.</p>

The Elven rings were still made by Celebrimbor, but that power is imperfect. Long story short: they&#39;ve lived the whole third age with Sauron over their heads, preparing. What do you think?</p>

            <p>Aragorn, King of Dale, defeats Witch-Kings of Gondor and claims Mordor for the elves.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/SecondAge.png"><br><br>Here&#39;s the situation in around 1200 of the Second Age. The Elven realms are growing ever more fair: Lindon is blossoming in the north-west (around Mithlond), and there&#39;s a lively trade around Khazad-Dum, Eregion, and Lorien. At this time, a powerful and beautiful stranger calling himself Annatar, &#39;the Lord of Gifts&#39;, comes out of the east, offering aid to the elves. Gil-Galad and Elrond bar the gates of Mithlond, refusing him entry.<br><br>At Ost-in-Edhil, Celebrimbor, Galadriel, and Celeborn of Eregion... do exactly the same.<br><br>Sauron (yes, it was him) returns east, his plan to corrupt the Noldorin kingdoms a failure. He managed to gain some influence in the other elvish realms - Eryn Galen, for instance - but they are Sindar and Nandor, and Morgoth&#39;s heir has no interest in trees. So he holes up in Mordor, building the great fortress of Barad-Dur, and preparing.<br><br>In Eregion, Celebrimbor&#39;s folk continue their research into &#39;magic&#39; rings, trying to stay the ravages of time on their realm. With no Annatar to drive them out, Galadriel and Celeborn remain in the Noldorin realm, lending their skill. Over the centuries, the art of ring-making is perfected: from minor rings the smiths progress to Rings of Power which can preserve mortals against death and heighten the bearer&#39;s innate powers, and then, finally, to a single Great Ring which can sustain an entire nation against decay.<br><br>The Rings are gifted to Eregion&#39;s allies: to Durin of Khazad-Dum, to Gil-Galad, Elrond, and Cirdan, to Amdir of Laurelindorenan, even to mortal folk living on their borders. But the Great Ring is kept by Celebrimbor, and worn by him alone.<br><br>Somewhere around S.A. 1800, Sauron completes the millennial labour that is the construction of Barad-Dur. He openly declares himself as Morgoth&#39;s Heir - but the time is not yet ripe for him to strike. His agents attempt to sow discord among his enemies, while the Dark Lord waits for an opportunity, and a pretext.<br><br>By around 1900, he finds his opening. Hordes of orcs swarm across Middle-earth, advancing through what we know as the Gap of Rohan and entering Eregion in war. They are aided by the mortal men of the forests, who rise up against the Numenoreans oppressing them, and swear fealty to Mordor.<br><br>The Ringbearers gather in Ost-in-Edhil, bending all their might against the Dark Lord. They have no hope of victory - Gil-Galad&#39;s overtures to Numenor have been turned down flat by Tar-Ciryatan. All they can do is prolonge the siege as much as possible, to buy time for their folk to flee.<br><br>Yet Numenor comes.<br><br>Not out of friendship with the elves - Tar-Ciryatan has long disliked their folk, and in his court speaks openly against the Ban of the Valar - but to protect their own interests, the logging grounds and the haven at Lond Daer. The Numenorean Grand Fleet sails up the Greyflood and shatters the years-long siege of Ost-in-Edhil. Sauron&#39;s army is in tatters, and the Dark Lord flees back to the east. The Free Peoples have their victory, and Eregion stands.<br><br>Yet the Shadow is still spreading over Numenor. Men of Westernesse continue their mass deforestation of the lands immediately south of Eregion, and their cruelty to the native mortals causes sporadic uprisings. Anti-elven sentiment rises in Numenor, until eventually, hundreds of years after the defeat of Sauron, the inevitable occurs: war.<br><br>The Numenorean navy again sails up the Greyflood in battle. Ost-in-Edhil is caught unawares. There is to be no second Siege. Numenorean fire meets elven art - and it is the elves who are broken.<br><br>As Eregion falls under the iron fist of Numenor, a second fleet blockades Lindon. The soldiers do not attack, but their message is clear - any attempt to relieve Eregion will be met with death.<br><br>The great folk of Eregion flee through Moria. They are not welcomed in Laurelindorenan, but continue northwards to found a new settlement around the upper Anduin. In their former home, Numenor gathers up all the magic artefacts it can find - including many of the Rings of Power. Tar-Vanimelde, Ruling Queen of Numenor, will never yield the sceptre: she and her husband will reign forever, and her armies will be led by immortal generals.<br><br>The centuries pass. The situation in Numenor grows worse and worse. Lindon, under threat of invasion, slowly empties, ceding the lands west of the Misty Mountains to Men. In the east, Sauron&#39;s armies grow once more in power. In former Eregion - and further south, around Anduin&#39;s mouth and down in Umbar - the Numenoreans build havens, claim territories, and take slaves. A clash is inevitable, somewhere, between some parties.<br><br>Sauron moves first. Jealous of Numenorean power, he seizes their lesser forts up Anduin - and in the north, Gil-Galad and Celebrimbor, influences by Sauron&#39;s agents, declare their own war. An alliance of elves and dwarves storms out of Khazad-Dum and down into Eregion.<br><br>But all involved have underestimated Numenor. Ar-Abârzîr (Tar-Vanimelde&#39;s Adunaic name, for she no longer allows the High Elven tongue to be spoken) storms into Middle-earth. Her armies are unstoppable, and her invisible spies, bearers of Rings of Power, can penetrate any camp not staffed by Eldar of Valinor.<br><br>The attacks fail, and worse: the leaders of both agressors are taken captive. Sauron, Gil-Galad, Celebrimbor, Galadriel, and Durin IV are borne in chains to Numenor. Khazad-Dum is laid waste, Numenorean soldiers cross the High Pass, and the Last Alliance of Elves and Dwarves are forced to flee beyond Greenwood, to the Long Lake and Lonely Mountain. Immortal Numenorean generals are set in place over the various fallen realms - including Mordor.<br><br>In Numenor, Ar-Abârzîr&#39;s captives are paraded before the people. It amuses the Witch-Queen of Westernesse to listen to their bargains and pleas - and that, of course, suits Sauron just fine. It isn&#39;t long (a couple of hundred years) before he is able to convince the queen to listen to him.<br><br>In whispers he tells her of Celebrimbor&#39;s Ring - the Ring that can give her back her beauty, rescue her from her shadow-life, but let her keep her powers - nay, even make them greater than before. Swayed, Ar-Abârzîr takes the Great Ring from Celebrimbor - and, when it does not do as Sauron promised, has the Elven smith tortured to death over several years, trying to extract the secret from him.<br><br>It takes Sauron longer to bring about his true goal. Slowly, slowly, he persuades the Queen that the Valar are responsible for her half-alive state - that if she can conquer the Blessed Realm as she has Middle-earth, she will have the life she craves. Centuries pass as Ar-Abârzîr prepares her armies, develops her technology (using captured Elven smiths), and lays her plans.<br><br>With the elves no longer an active enemy in Middle-earth, the Faithful of Elendil&#39;s line (for Elendil himself is long-dead by this time) have something of a resurgance. When the Witch-Queen finally launches her attack, they are ready - not to sink her fleet, nor to attempt to sieze the throne, but to rescue the imprisoned Elvish leaders and flee to Middle-earth.<br><br>The Faithful&#39;s plan succeeds. So does Sauron&#39;s. When the Witch-Queen sets foot in Aman, the Valar lay down their guardianship of Arda. The world is made round. The only escapees from the Downfall of Numenor are the small ships of the Faithful, bearing their precious elven cargo.<br><br>But there is more to the Numenorean world than just the isle. Armies and immortals still watch over Middle-earth, and they are <i>not</i> about to bow to Faithful traitors.<br><br>Here is Middle-earth after the fall of Numenor:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/FallofNumenor.png"><br><br>The Faithful land in abandoned Lindon and take the treacherous ways north of the mountains to Erebor. The Numenorean havens unite to form a Kingdom in Exile - but an Adunaic-speaking one that is hostile to the elves. Sauron&#39;s spirit cannot return to occupied Mordor - he flees further east. Since the fall of Numenor and the loss of his body has weakened him to the point where he will take centuries to recover, the Downfall is accounted the end of the Second Age.<br><br>The Third Age will have to be sketched in broad strokes. A mingled civilisation of elves, men, and dwarves is built in northern Rhovanion, taking in the Greenwood and the Iron Hills, and extending down as far as Dorwinion on the Sea of Rhun. They face incursions from the east as Sauron rebuilds, and an implacable enemy to the south.<br><br>The Numenoreans build a nation across the south. With Eregion&#39;s trees long gone, and the &#39;New Hollin&#39; settlement constantly raided by the folk of Erebor, they pull back to the Greyflood. Calenardhon (=Rohan) and Dunland make up one facet of the kingdom; southern Gondor and the lands down to Umbar make the second; Ithilien and Mordor (when it&#39;s not held by the orcs, which happens fairly regularly) make the third. The last three Numenorean immortals become three kings, sometimes firm allies with each other, sometimes in open war. They will always unite to counter the elves, Sauron, or the Haradrim, however.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/KingdomsInExile.png"><br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That was amazing, so much better than mine. Here it is.<br><br><br>  My idea was that Sauron considered bending them to his will, but also thought about the drawbacks of having all his power in a central object. Instead, he decides to occupy huge swathes of land, as normal. Ar-Pharazon objects, captures him, and Sauron manages to sink Numenor, the world is Bent, and Elendil swears vengeance. Meanwhile, Celebrimbor realizes that Elven power will not last forever, and decides to create objects that could stop that process. He creates three prototype rings, and gives them to his love, Galadriel and Gil-Galad, ruler of the elves. Sadly, Sauron kills him before he could perfect this art. The prototype rings could only vastly slow down the elven aging process, not stop it in it&#39;s tracks. Galadriel chooses to set up her own elven kingdom of Lothlorien, while Gil-Galad keeps the other two. He later chooses to give Vilya to Elrond, so that he could form Rivendell.<br><br>    Years pass, and the threat of Sauron still looms in Mordor. Elendil has his children, Anarion and Isildur. They each inherit on half of the fathers kingdom, and thus Arnor and Gondor are formed. Over time, Numenorean tensions rise. There are only so many Numenorean families you could marry into, and so Gondor loses Umbar to Castamir&#39;s descendants, over Eldacar&#39;s blood purity. Meanwhile, with Gondor between them and Mordor, Arnor becomes much more laid-back as a state. A clash between three brothers changes that. Arnor is split between Cardolan, Arthedain and Rhudaur. Rhudaur was formed as a more militaristic Arnor, and Arthedain split off because of the arrival of the hobbits, who Cardolan wanted nothing to do with. After all, they were a peaceful group, and would do nothing much for the fragments of Arnor. Over time, Arthedain would rejoin Cardolan to combat the threat of Rhudaur, which was taken over by Sauron&#39;s spies. Time passes, and there is relative stability. The Kingdoms prosper, but Sauron remains over their heads. <br><br>   I understand that there are a lot of details that I have not touched on, but this is everything I have fully thought out.  Do you think &quot;If Sauron didn&#39;t make the ring&quot; is a good writing prompt?</p>

            <p>The trouble I have with this kind of AU is that it assumes history stays the same <i>except</i> when you specifically changes. It&#39;s like having the Aztecs beat the Conquistadors and take over North America - but then insisting that the southern members of the United States of Aztlan attempt to secede from the northern ones over the issue of slavery.<br><br>You have Ar-Pharazon still being the king who brings about the Downfall; Galadriel still ending up in Lorien; Elrond still building Imladris; Gondor and Arnor still splitting (Isildur was heading north to claim the throne of a United Kingdom when he was killed!); <i>Arnor</i> still breaking up, and in exactly the same way; Rhudaur still becoming a subject of Sauron; Umbar still splitting off. You&#39;ve assumed that the canon history is almost inevitable, with only minor changes from your point of departure.<br><br>I go (if anything, too far) the other way: history is <i>fragile</i>. &#39;Stray but a little, and it will fail&#39;. For storytelling purposes, it&#39;s useful to keep the same names - so I&#39;ve still used Gondor to describe the Numenorean kingdoms-in-exile, for instance - but in practical terms, a tiny change will lead to <i>massive</i> differences when you get thousands of years down the line.<br><br>I guess they&#39;re two different ways of looking at AUs, so I&#39;m not precisely telling you you&#39;re <i>wrong</i>. I just think my way is <s>better</s> more fun. ^_^<br><br>hS <img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Memorials/BowieMemorial.png"></p>

            <p>I had the idea that a timeline is immutable, and that things would happen anyways. Like all those stories about killing Hitler as a child, only to realize that it wasn&#39;t actually Hitler you killed. You have made a much more plausible-sounding AU. I got this idea from a disorganized ME RP where pretty much everyone wanted to be Sauron. So we had 3 different people being Sauron, running around with a physical form. By trying to fill in that plothole, I have apparently made more. Dang. Thanks for showing me that.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m reading an AU of WWII, where the French didn&#39;t surrender on June 40. It&#39;s still a work in progress, but these guys are doing a wonderful work with this, and I think they do a pretty good job of showing all the changes induced by this point of divergence. Even the Pacific War is affected, and from what they wrote, decolonisation would quite a bit different from reality.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not going to lie. I freaking love this. I would write AUs SO HARD......<br><br>Erebor would be a mixed community of men, elves, and dwarves, working together to forge the most beautiful things in Middle-earth. Of course, Smaug would have been rather attracted to this hoard, maybe even more so than originally. <br><br>So Gandalf seeks to drive the dragon out at the first chance he gets, of course, with Sauron hanging over everyone&#39;s heads, and Numenor looking to take advantage of their weakness. <br><br>Enter Bilbo Baggins. <br><br>While constant warring tears apart the lands north and east, the Shire continues to prosper in a simple, cheerful lifestyle. They hear the rumbles of warfare, rumors from Bree and elsewhere, but this &quot;news from Bree&quot; is never given much stock. Bilbo remains comfortably ignorant (or ignoring) of the troubles beyond his immediate existence. <br><br>Until a wizard, three elves, four men, and six dwarves, including Thorin Oakenshield, suddenly show up for tea and invite him on an adventure. <br><br>Cue encounters with trolls, goblins, a skinchanger, giant spiders, mistrustful elves, a dragon, etc. Bilbo still picks up a ring of power in the caves. (I imagine Sméagol could have easily been a hobbit who somehow came into possession of a ring of power, and used it for ill purposes. He still would have been kicked out of his community and end up banished, with a longerish lifespan, if not long enough to be around to meet Bilbo or anything.) Basically, the Hobbit happens as laid out in the book, with the overlay of serious political problems and constant threat of war. <br><br>As this motley band proceeds toward Erebor, Sauron begins to set his long awaited plan in motion. The Battle of Five Armies comes about as an impromptu alliance of various men, elves, and dwarves to fight the wave of orcs meant to arouse Smaug for battle. <br><br>They win, Thorin dies, there&#39;s gold for all involved, etc. Bilbo goes back to the Shire and whatnot, everything&#39;s happy. <br><br>Bilbo raises Frodo and bequeaths him the ring. <br><br>Who wants to go next? :D</p>

            <p>&quot;There won&#39;t be a Shire, Sam.&quot;<br><br>Or at least, not as we know it. The Shire was able to exist as a peaceful realm because the Rangers of Arnor were constantly watching its borders. But there is no Arnor in the Witch-Queen timeline - nothing to stop the Big Folk (and worse!) from traipsing all over the green-hill country.<br><br>But on the flip side, there are far <i>fewer</i> Big Folk around. Assuming Bree managed to escape slavery under the Numenoreans (and since they never really spread that far north, it&#39;s reasonable), they&#39;re... about it. There&#39;s the Snowmen of Forochel, but they wouldn&#39;t really come south. And <i>un</i>like the canon timeline, the lack of Angmar and a weaker Sauron mean the Misty Mountains aren&#39;t particularly goblin-heavy - so there&#39;s not going to be too many orcs wandering in the west.<br><br>The Shire would definitely have to fend for itself - the Bounders would be armed (with bows, we know hobbits use those), and would be greatly increased in number - but they probably wouldn&#39;t have <i>too</i> much trouble. The prominence of the Took and Brandybuck families... well, they&#39;re always subject to the butterfly effect, but there&#39;s nothing obviously outside-related to them. I think you&#39;d have more contact with Bree, and less well-defined borders to the Shire - remember, their original borders were laid by the King, and there <i>is</i> no king in this timeline - but ultimately, it&#39;s the same folk in the same place.<br><br>The other key question: would Smaug be able to take Erebor with the likes of Galadriel and Gil-Galad defending it? Um... probably! Prior to Smaug, the <i>only</i> person we know has killed a flying dragon was Earendil - and he used a Silmaril and a flying ship to do it! And if the United Kingdom of Erebor falls, the people would probably in part flee west: to the ruins of Lindon and the Blue Mountains, precisely where Thorin&#39;s company travelled from.<br><br>So this is plausible. Your Company may include key leaders - Gil-Galad, Arathorn King of Dale. There would be no Imladris to stop off in, unless it was built as a post-Smaug waypoint. The Mountains would be less dangerous, Mirkwood is still Greenwood (no Dol Guldur!), and Thranduil - no, his father, Oropher, is still alive! - is <i>less</i> hostile (though probably still doesn&#39;t one his theoretical overlord rousing the dragon). It would be a <i>different</i> story, but it could hit a lot of the same notes.<br><br>(If Smeagol got hold of a Ring of Power, under this model he would still be immortal - look at the Witch-Kings of Gondor, they&#39;re still around after thousands of years!)<br><br>hS <img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Memorials/BowieMemorial.png"></p>

            <p>My (admittedly limited) reading of them likens them to Sami herders, but Iunno how feasible that is given the Ice-Bay of Forochel. Would it be more likely to liken them to Siberian coastal natives like the Chukchi? Because that opens up a lot of possibilities for AUs, given where and when they first appeared - for instance, in this AU, do the Lossoth venture south to trade with those who came North and fight off those who would seek to subjugate them? I ask because I personally quite like the image of a particularly adventuresome Bounder wandering north and coming home with an elaborately carved bow... and wearing something a little like this:-<br><br><img src="http://www.forensicfashion.com/files/1774ChukchiWarriorArmorAMNH.JPG"></p>

            <p>I know nothing about our world&#39;s natives of cold regions (other than Britain!), but here&#39;s the picture I get of the Lossoth:<br><br>-They&#39;re related to the Men of Beleriand - but it&#39;s not clear which set. They could be relatives of the Edain, but their northerly location also opens the possibility that they&#39;re some of those &#39;Easterlings&#39; who allied with Morgoth (or, more politely, the ones who were faithful to Maedhros at the Nirnaeth). Their closest neighbours, the folk of Bree, were of Haladin (Second House) origin - but they moved up from Dunland. I&#39;d guess at the Forodwaith (=pre-Lossoth) being Swarthy Men in origin, but not Morgoth-worshippers. Per Appendix A: <i>These are a strange, unfriendly people, remnant of the Forodwaith, Men of far-off days, accustomed to the bitter colds of the realm of Morgoth.</i><br><br>-Their tech level is low. They didn&#39;t particularly understand either iron weapons or sailing ships (possibly boats in general - I can&#39;t find anyone quoting it).<br><br>-On the flip side, they have some tech that isn&#39;t found elsewhere. Per Appendix A: <i>The Lossoth house in the snow, and it is said that they can run on the ice with bones on their feet. and have carts without wheels.</i> It&#39;s pretty clear from the snow-houses that Tolkien was thinking of &#39;eskimos&#39;, but we&#39;re not here to talk about what <i>he</i> thought. ^<em>^<br><br>-They were... well, you can&#39;t call it superstitious when magic actually exists! They believed the Witch-King could control ice and cold, and they could predict when the weather was about to turn (which Arvedui didn&#39;t believe, to his cost).<br><br>-They don&#39;t move about much. That may be partly from lingering fear of Angmar, but I think they just... liked it where they were. The fact that they didn&#39;t have wheeled vehicles means they&#39;d have trouble moving around in the south anyway, and the fact that they don&#39;t really trust anybody - they&#39;re <i>very</i> suspicious of Arvedui - means they they just... stay put.<br><br>I don&#39;t know what that means for real-world comparisons, I&#39;m afraid. I <i>do</i> like the idea of a hide-clad wandering Hobbit. ^</em>^<br><br>hS <img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Memorials/BowieMemorial.png"></p>

            <p>If you&#39;re right and they don&#39;t have boats, then that rules out... like, a <i>lot</i> of northern indigenous peoples, including both the Chukchi and the Inuit. Fishing is about your best source of food up there (well, that and reindeer), so they&#39;re limited to ice-hole fishing without boats. However, it <i>doesn&#39;t</i> rule out certain denominations of the Sami, which I quite like because it means they might have hidden Arvedui in a storehouse that looked like this:-<br><br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Sami_Storehouse.jpg"></p>

            <p>I&#39;m the sort that likes to see what stories would look like in a new AU setting, and I like seeing where the differences and similarities might be. Besides, M-e would be in serious trouble without the Shire, imho! ^^<br><br>1. Tougher hobbits lend themselves to either a) less freaked-out Bilbo, or b) more freaked-out Bilbo, which I like better. I kind of like to think about B greeting his first unexpected guest at bowpoint lol. I imagine the hobbits distinguish themselves from the chaotic, roughshod Big Folk by their code of respectability and manners. Also, they do have closer ties with Bree, but they believe the people of Bree to be subject to fanciful thinking and/or undue panicking. <br><br>2. If there aren&#39;t goblins in the Misty Mountains, that means Bilbo &amp; Co. would either a) need a different excuse to drag them down there so B can get the ring, perhaps Sméagol himself, or b) they don&#39;t go underground into the Mountains at all, which would mean B would have to find the ring elsewhere. <br><br>3. I imagine the Witch-Queen doesn&#39;t exactly like Gandalf/Mithrandir, and wouldn&#39;t be too happy about a group going back to reclaim Erebpr and it&#39;s surrounding lands. So there&#39;s a potential conflict. She may even send troops to stop them. <br><br>4. So our Company includes Thorin Oakenshield, Gil-galad, and Arathorn for sure, along with perhaps Elrond, a smattering of dwarves (Fili and Kili? Balin?), and a few men. <br><br>4. I was under the impression that the less power in a ring of power, the less power it had to stop aging, etc. I don&#39;t know how Sméagol would have have gotten a more powerful ring. Am I just making stuff up in my head or is that a thing? <br><br><br>Just saying, tougher hobbits is *the best* thing since ever. </p>

            <p>They make rambling so much more structured.<br><br>1/ That is a <i>fantastic</i> image. Bow-wielding Bilbo is like a cuddly Rabbit of Caerbannog.<br><br>2/ There <i>could</i> be goblins - Sauron is on the rise, after all, and Morgoth&#39;s old haunts were in the North. It&#39;s hard to imagine a Smeagol-figure anywhere other than underground... the Ring could be passed down the family of a Beorn-analogue, perhaps, or the Company could pass through &#39;New Hollin&#39; and find it buried. (I&#39;ll also note here that the Rohirrim - or rather, the Eotheod - are allies of Erebor, never moved south, and are only a little north of the Company&#39;s route. Butterflies, butterflies...)<br><br>3/ Well, the Witch-Queen of Numenor is dead(?) somewhere in Aman, but her three generals are still here (and probably venerating her as a deity, which must tick off Sauron no end). Given their millennia-old grudge against Erebor, they would absolutely try and interfere.<br><br>4/ This is the point where you get to play &#39;spot the cameo&#39;. Is Galadriel with the company? Celeborn? Elrond and Celebrian (yeah, no Imladris, so <i>she&#39;s</i> still around.) What about Dain Ironfoot? Halbarad of Dale? He might be a bit young - but what about <i>Denethor</i> of Dale, distant cousin to Arathorn? (Imrahil of Dol Amroth doesn&#39;t exist, alas - his ancestry involves the elf-haven at Edhellond, which the Numenoreans took long ago.) Or you muck about with timelines and generations a little and stick Aragorn and Boromir in - and on the way over, they run into Theoden of the Eotheod and <i>his</i> family... but this is all getting a little too &#39;historical preservation&#39; for me, I think. ^_^<br><br>5/ Er... 4b/ The Rings are a bit sketchy even in canon. The Sixteen (Seven + Nine) were identical, and could all make you immortal - look at the Nazgul. There were lesser rings with undefined effects.<br><br>I&#39;ve assumed that Celebrimbor made around the same number of Rings, meaning there are 15-20 Rings of Power in existence, plus the (destroyed with Numenor? Stolen back by the Faithful?) Great Ring. Then there&#39;s a bunch of lesser rings.<br><br>The Rings of Power make you immortal (ie, a ringwraith) and enhance your innate powers, but the key thing to remember is that <i>that was never the goal</i>. The Great Ring - or, in canon, the Three - was the only one that did what it was meant to: preserve a land against decay. Nenya is the reason Lorien can still grow <i>mellyrn</i>, and that time is wonky there. Vilya is probably behind Rivendell&#39;s secrecy. Narya... well, Narya is on the hand of a demigod who&#39;s made it his purpose to preserve the entire <i>world</i>, who knows what it&#39;s doing? (There&#39;s a lovely story by Cirdan about what happened when the Ring of Fire was given to Gandalf: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1165344/1/Mithlond-s-First-Winter">Mithlond&#39;s First Winter</a>.)<br><br>Anyway: &#39;New Hollin&#39; was around where Smeagol would later live, so stumbling across a Ring of Power isn&#39;t too farfetched. We know that Numenor had at least five, probably at least eight (three Witch-Kings, the Witch-Queen, her husband, and at least three generals in Numenor itself); we know that Durin&#39;s line (ie, Thorin) has one, as do (likely) Gil-Galad, Galadriel, Celeborn, and Elrond (though any who were taken to Numenor may have lost them there). Even assuming Gil-Galad and Galadriel had to source replacements, that still only comes to 15, so there&#39;s definitely scope for one to have gone missing in &#39;New Hollin&#39;. So yes, he could have a bona fide Ring of Power.<br><br>hS <img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Memorials/BowieMemorial.png"></p>

            <p>The Hobbits moved west as a sort of general theme. Hobbit origins are a bit vague, but they clearly originated in the East, and headed west to escape Sauron. They eventually settled as far from Mordor as it&#39;s possible to get without getting frostbite. I think those imperatives should be broadly similar.<br><br>The Eotheod, on the other hand, didn&#39;t migrate: they <i>moved</i>. In T.A. 2510, the Steward of Gondor asked them for aid against a massive attack. Eorl the Young rode out of Framburg and defeated the minions of Sauron at the field of Celebrant (just north of what we know as Rohan).<br><br>In return, the Steward granted Eorl and his people a massive chunk of land - then known as Calenardhon, but renamed Rohan. Apparently it was much nicer than their old homeland, squeezed between two mountain ranges and Mirkwood. They never went back.<br><br>But in this timeline, the Eotheod are allied with <i>Erebor</i>, and Erebor doesn&#39;t have vast tracts of land to give to them. So they stay where they are, and the Witch-Kings of Gondor have to win their own battles.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I tried to limit the amount of enormously important canon people who would be in the Co., kind of looking forward to LotR, where Tolkien only had Gimli being an actual descendant of a person Bilbo knew, unless Legolas counts. <br><br>But the Rohirrim/Eotheod would be a lovely addition to the story!
