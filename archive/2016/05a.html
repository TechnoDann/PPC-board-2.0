            <p>&quot;He&#39;s from some book called <i>Deprivers</i>.  It&#39;s basically like <i>X-Men</i>, but everyone&#39;s power is to touch someone and take away a sense from them, either for a while or for good.  The book does mostly the actual senses, but also has things like &#39;sense of self&#39; or &#39;sense of balance&#39; count, too.  Riso got one of those weird ones.&quot;<br><br>Laquisha stopped to bite a chunk out of a hamantaschen.  After chewing a few moments, she suddenly swallowed and went on, &quot;Should&#39;ve mentioned, Riso is also one of the temporary ones.  Your sense of humor only goes away a couple hours, but trust me: it sucks more than you might think.  HQ&#39;s actually not a very fun place to be if you can&#39;t find things funny.&quot;  She shivered.  &quot;But Riso&#39;s real careful, wears gloves and pants and long sleeves and all.  Doing the Rogue thing, speaking of <i>X-Men</i>.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Not too long ago, I was a soldier,&quot; he said, tapping ine of this pauldrons with his free hand. &quot;442nd Arcadian Guard Regiment-- but then I fell into Headauarters by accident. I&#39;ll spare you all of the boring details but when my future partners found me, they misunderstood my introduction and called me &#39;The Guardsman&#39;. To be fair, I had been cooked alive, splattered against a wall, and starting to regenerate so I wasn&#39;t at my most coherent anyways.&quot;<br><br>The former soldier smiled. &quot;My actual old rank is much, much higher than your basic guardsman. That, plus my appointment on top, wouldn&#39;t make for a very good &#39;The&#39; name. Too militaristic.

I&#39;m all outta regenerations. Back when I was a soldier there were... let&#39;s say there were people who needed the regeneration energy more than I did. I gave it to them and only kept enough for one more face-- and here it is. I&#39;m not sad about it: most of the people I helped got to see the end of the War and will get to live out their full cycles, healthy and happy. And that makes me happy as well.&quot;<br><br></p>

            <p>It&#39;s interesting to see how much is exposed at the back. I guess they weren&#39;t too worried about being attacked from behind?

            <p>The only problem arising from an exposed back is someone sneaking up on you, and it&#39;s a bit hard to sneak up on someone when every time you reach down to shoo a mosquito off your thigh it sounds like the local marching band mixed their instruments up with an assortment of saucepans and baking trays. </p>

            <p>It&#39;s good to hear what the fight would be like, though.

            <p>Sort of like creating a style sheet. I like it.<br><br>The trouble is, we don&#39;t all agree on everything. For instance, I&#39;m fairly adamant that words like agent, assassin, floater, etc. should not be capitalized except when used as a title or specific address (e.g. Agent Acacia, &quot;Do your duty, Assassin.&quot;), but there&#39;s a bit of a history of treating them as special words and thus capitalizing them, and a lot of people do that. And then there are a few cases where the title is based on the name of the department, like Bad Slasher, in which case it retains its capitalization; plus, without caps, it would be hard to tell in this case whether you were referring to an agent in the DBS or a writer of bad slash.<br><br>Also, &quot;neuralyze&quot; and &quot;portaled&quot; are subject to regional spelling differences. I feel that fandom words such as &quot;neuralyze&quot; should always be spelled as they are in their home canon, but on the other hand, I&#39;m not going to argue too much if a British person spells it &quot;neuralyse&quot; in their missions. Same with &quot;portaled&quot;—as an American, I give it one L, like in totaled, but a Brit would be perfectly correct to give both word two Ls.<br><br>The names of Bleep products should always be capitalized, though, like brand names.<br><br>So really we would need at least two sheets, just to cover American vs. Commonwealth differences.<br><br>... I might do it anyway, just for kicks. But not today; I have work.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m kidding; there is no trap. But I have an excellent rebuttal: the addition of aspirin to the brain bleach is precisely what sets Bleeprin apart from the generic stuff, and is a tactic infamously used by drug companies everywhere to establish patents and rake in the big bucks. Oh, you want a new patent but your drug is too similar to another drug? Just tack another compound onto the one you actually care about, claim it enhances it or whatever, and you&#39;re all set! Trademark secured.<br><br>I bet some of you still hoover with a Hoover, though. As for saying &quot;coke&quot; when you mean soda/pop, that&#39;s just you and the American South. You&#39;ll forgive me if I don&#39;t take regional aberrations of dialect too seriously as an argument. ^_~<br><br>I&#39;m not saying genericization (ick, what a mouthful) doesn&#39;t happen, but that doesn&#39;t excuse serious writers from capitalizing a brand name when used as such. Whether agents are in fact doing so is a good question. Mine are, at least. {= )<br><br>I have no defense for the Bleeprin knockoffs. A lot of them are explicitly just cooked up in someone&#39;s RC, and I can&#39;t think of any real world cases of something derived from a brand retaining its capital. Probably because attempting such a thing would get you sued in the real world.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m usually so good at avoiding those. Even when I don&#39;t want to. :(<br><br>Waaaaait, are you saying the aspirin is irrelevant to the operation of Bleeprin<sup>TM</sup>? But, but, it relieves the pain! I remember this!<br><br>I honestly don&#39;t know if Hoover still make hoovers; let me check! Yup, looks like they do (and they make roombas, too! [Ducks]). I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen one.

            <p>As are no-caps stylizations, for that matter. In fact, no-caps stylizations have no place outside the product&#39;s label.<br><br>But yeah, aspirin is totally irrelevant to the function of Bleeprin as brain bleach—and the brain bleach is totally irrelevant to its function as a painkiller. You could, of course, take generic brain bleach and/or aspirin, together or individually, but if you want the specially balanced combined action version, you want the one, the only, Bleeprin. Go ahead. Quaff a kind nepenthe. Because you&#39;re good at what you do, and you deserve the best in quality amnesia. {= )<br><br>But now I&#39;m distracted by the fact that colas are theoretically supposed to taste like kola nuts, but are actually mostly flavored with cinnamon and vanilla, and yet they all taste absolutely awful to me.

            <p>Figured I&#39;d come up with at least one for each of my agents. Plus some other general ones.<br><br>Agent-specific:<br>- Do not try to take away Rashida&#39;s inhaler. Especially not while she&#39;s in the middle of using it.<br>- Do not regard the Gold/Silver, Diamond/Pearl, or Black/White games as the &quot;worst generation&quot; of the Pokemon series within Falchion&#39;s vicinity.<br>-- For that matter, do not espouse &quot;Genwunner&quot; viewpoints in front of Falchion unless you want to lose an eye.<br>- Similarly, it is theoretically impossible to say anything along the lines of &quot;Feathered dinosaurs are stupid&quot; (or any other <a href="http://log.johnconway.co/post/46259087381/jurassic-park-4-awesomebro">&quot;awesomebro&quot;</a> sentiments) within earshot of Velociripper and not lose at least one limb.<br>- You can only try hand-feeding Rayner once. And for the love of the Princesses, if you offer him any sort of meat product, do NOT jiggle it around to make it look like it&#39;s alive.<br>- To tell E.V.L. either that men are the superior gender or that ex-Suvians are inferior WILL land you in Medical for at least a week, no matter how you word it.<br>- Do not joke about things getting caught in jet turbines around Sarah. If you do and she inevitably responds accordingly, do NOT ask her to knock out two of my teeth or less.<br>- Do not try to pluck Cupid&#39;s wing feathers. He HATES that. Also, if he has a legitimate excuse to grab himself a drink, you should just let him.<br>- <b><i>DO. NOT. TRY. TO. KILL. LAPIS&#39;. FRIENDS. PERIOD.</i></b><br>- Do not say &quot;I&#39;m really feeling it!&quot; if Backslash is in earshot.<br>- For that matter, do NOT try to flirt with Backslash if Whitney is in earshot.<br><br>General:<br>- Do not try to ask the DMFF if you can have Leviathan or Behemoth as a pet, in any form, from any continuum. Especially not the originals from the Book of Job.<br>- Sneaking up on someone walking through the PPC halls and plowing them through the nearest wall is only funny once. Shouting &quot;GANK!&quot; while doing so is only funny twice.<br>- Do not try to use your console to stream any dirty (i.e. 18+) material. Not even if you work in Bad Slash or any related departments thereof.<br>- Pterosaurs do not make good hang gliders.<br>- If you organize a game night at your RC, let the Flowers know as soon as possible lest your console go off and ruin your winning spree at Monopoly.<br>- Likewise, dance parties in HQ are not to last until any time after 3 AM without Upstairs receiving advance notification. Especially if they involve dubstep, square dancing, or both.<br>- Do not mix Bleeproducts with love potions in any form from any continuum. It NEVER ends well.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been years since I read it last, though.

            <p>&quot;We don&#39;t see Sauron be evil.&quot; Just... just keep this claim in mind.<br><br>Orcs as &quot;lovable misfits&quot;. The shot used is a) of Saruman&#39;s forces, and b) literally the Uruk saying &#39;let&#39;s cannibalise our comrade!&#39;.<br><br>&quot;Sauron is an underdog... fighting against oppressive foreign forces.&quot; Every battle with Sauron except the very last one is one where his armies left Mordor and attacked elsewhere. The only offensive action taken by Gondor is the attack on the Black Gate.<br><br>Sauron&#39;s a good guy because he didn&#39;t want to stay in Mordor. Therefore he went on a murderspree. Let&#39;s ignore the fact that the Hobbit movies - since we&#39;re talking about the movies - quite clearly show that a) he used to live in Mirkwood, and b) Mirkwood was corrupted by his presence, and was actually quite nice beforehand.<br><br>Orcs are a &quot;subjugated class&quot;, and &quot;everyone who lives somewhere terrible deserves it&quot;. I will grant this one.<br><br>&quot;Immortality prevents progress&quot;. Yup, pretty sure that&#39;s Tolkien&#39;s message too. The trouble is a) the elves are no longer a major player by the War of the Rings, and b) Sauron is an immortal who made his chief servants immortal too. #PartOfTheProblem<br><br>&quot;When the Orcs march into battle they do it as a big multiethnic team.&quot; Again, true! But I&#39;m... pretty sure having allies doesn&#39;t make you the good guy, especially when some of them are enslaved.<br><br>&quot;Mordor is a rich multicultural stew with a large base of working poor.&quot; Well, the multicultural aspect isn&#39;t true, because we see those armies marching in shortly before they march out again. The &quot;large base of working poor&quot; part is a valid interpretation of what we <i>see</i> - though Tolkien makes it clear the orcs are slaves, not a working class.<br><br>Orcs are tortured POWs &gt; they are mistreated. If America&#39;s POWs were formed into an army that attacked the USA and refused to surrender under any circumstances, this would be a valid comment.<br><br>Elrond doesn&#39;t like mortals (and doesn&#39;t want Arwen to die): entirely true of Movie!Elrond, but the fact that you&#39;re fighting bigots doesn&#39;t make you a good guy yourself.<br><br>Thranduil is cruel to Orcs. Yes, he is. He&#39;s also cruel to dwarves. Movie!Thranduil is just a generally cruel person.<br><br><i>Lord of the Rings</i> is &quot;fictional white supremacy&quot;. Sure, when your movies cast all the people of equatorial island heritage as pure white, and all the Orcs are painted black, you can draw that conclusion. Where&#39;s that <a href="http://askmiddlearth.tumblr.com/tagged/middle%20earth%20racism">Racism and Middle-earth</a> article...?<br><br>&quot;Sauron makes good points.&quot; Yes. He forges them onto swords and sets out to conquer the world. His actions trump whatever moral high ground you could concievably grant him, and his actions are aggressive, violent, world conquering villainy.<br><br>So no. I disagree. Are the Free Peoples all sweetness and light? No - they&#39;re all isolationists who by and large care only about their own nations (not species - check out Rohan and their dubiousness about Gondor). But Sauron is not a credible alternative.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The entire prequel trilogy is a study in hubris, and <i>The Force Awakens</i> confirms what the EU always told us - Luke Skywalker is pretty much <i>the worst</i> at training Jedi students.

            <p>... by &#39;balance&#39; they do mean something like &#39;order&#39;. The Dark Side <s>is a powerful ally</s> is <i>imbalance</i>.

            <p>By which I mean from someone who isn&#39;t that big a fan of either Tolkien or Martin. Let&#39;s face it: the bias for Tolkien on this Board is very high.<br><br>That being said, I&#39;m still going to give it to Tolkien. But it was very close. I feel like Martin had overall better lines — I particularly liked his first verse and, later on, the patter line about Tolkien&#39;s &quot;hairy foot fetish&quot; — but Tolkien had a stronger base. Specifically, his point about fantasy being, well, fantasy. Part of the reason I stopped reading Martin&#39;s books and watching the show is because it was just too damn dark. Good people struggled and died at every turn, while the sinister and the scheming thrived. While Martin had a point about Tolkien&#39;s arguably predictable pattern of good thriving and evil failing (at least, in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy), that&#39;s pretty much how it goes in most works of fiction. Because we want it that way.<br><br>Some other notes:<br>— I was hoping this matchup would appear on ERB, with one change: Martin and Tolkien would be interrupted by J. K. Rowling, who in turn would be interrupted by Terry Pratchett. Fantasy author throw-down.<br>— I liked the detail of Tolkien suddenly appearing on his intro card after taking off the One Ring. I thought it was an editing error at first until I went back and looked more carefully.<br>— Martin is playing Zork on his computer.<br><br>Finally, a bit of fun. Some figures I&#39;d like to see in future ERBs!<br>— The Marx Brothers vs. The Three Stooges<br>— Richard Nixon vs. John F. Kennedy<br>— Henry VIII vs. Elizabeth II (or, heck, Elizabeth I)<br>— George Carlin vs. Richard Pryor<br>— Matt Groening vs. Seth MacFarlane<br>— Avatar Aang vs. Steven Universe</p>

            <p>1/ Tolkien didn&#39;t have a hairy foot fetish. I can say this, because he makes it abundantly clear what his fetish <i>was</i>: long hair. He literally gives elves a racial obsession with the stuff; his wife-insert [what do you call a self-insert of someone else?], Luthien, grows her hair to ridiculous lengths to escape, and wears a cloak made out of it; whenever he mentions hair, it&#39;s long; and the early &#39;Cottage of Lost Play&#39; poem calls out pretty much one feature of Edith: her hair.<br><br>Though I thought the line was funny. ;) I&#39;m just pickin&#39; those nits.<br><br>2/ Good does not thrive in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Yes, the characters get a &#39;happy ending&#39; - but then Tolkien literally sits down in Appendix B and explains exactly how all the main characters died (or moved to Valinor), and how all the elves left and then everything sucked.<br><br>Middle-earth is, at every stage in its history, a world in decline. The actions of Good serve to slow the fall, maybe even arrest it for a little while, but ultimately, everything fades.<br><br>You say &#39;that&#39;s pretty much how it goes in most works of fiction&#39;, and that&#39;s true - but it&#39;s not what happens in Tolkien.<br><br>(If you want me to discuss this further, with examples, I will, but I won&#39;t chuck any more out unasked-for)<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: 3/ I didn&#39;t notice the things you mention in your Other Notes; I was only watching it quickly. That&#39;s pretty cool, though. ^_^ Both thats.</p>

            <p>At 52 seconds in, when it cuts to Martin for the first time since Tolkien began, it looks like Martin started reading <i>Fellowship</i> after he stopped singing, and tries to hide it once he realizes he&#39;s been caught.<br><br>I&#39;m amazed I even noticed that, since I tend to read along with the captions instead of actually watching the video.  You can take the book from a book nerd, but you can&#39;t take the nerd from a book nerd.

            <p>These are great. ^_^<br><br>I hope no one will be offended if I don&#39;t use all the All-Stars suggestions, though. It&#39;s <i>my</i> All-Star deck, so what goes in there is purely related to what I find especially nostalgic, memorable, funny, etc. A thing not being included doesn&#39;t make it ~*unworthy*~ or anything, just not something I&#39;d personally get a kick out of playing. I should maybe have mentioned this from the outset. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>Nothing stopping anyone from making such a deck of their own, though. Especially since you can sign into Cardcast using your Google account, and maybe other such things, too. {= )<br><br>The rest will probably all go in.<br><br>(BTW, you should ask Jenni about the Fey Wine Incident in the Mailbox Game.

            <p>Generally I&#39;ve found that if there are an awful lot of cards for one particular group or category, it can be easier to make them a separate pack or just bulk up the rest of the groups to tolerate it better without being overwhelmed.<br><br>*eyes the Homestuck expansion and a few others pointedly*<br><br></p>

            <p>It&#39;s May again, so why not shake the dust off this old thing and give it a whirl?<br><br><br>The rules are simple: this is an AU game in which we get to have a Q&amp;A session with some of our favourite PPC agents. As such, it is <i>strictly non-canon</i> for all participants due to the fact that, well, World One authors are having their questions answered by the agents themselves.<br><br>The format will be as follows:<br><br>Other Board / T-Board setup post<br><br>&gt;BoarderName1&#39;s Agents&#39; Mailbox (nm)<br>&gt;&gt;Question(s) for BN1&#39;s Agent1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Answer(s) to the above<br>&gt;&gt;Question(s) for BN1&#39;s Agent2 and Agent3<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Answer(s) to the above<br>&gt;&gt;Another question for BN1&#39;s Agent1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Answer to the above <br><br>&gt;BoarderName2&#39;s Agents&#39; Mailbox (nm)<br>&gt;&gt;Question(s) for BN2&#39;s Agent 2<br><br><br>...and so on.<br><br><br>Do we have any takers?

            <p>To which I&#39;m sure a large group of people are going &#39;you left&#39;?<br><br>The answer to that is I&#39;ve been out on deployment in the ocean for the last several months, and now I&#39;m finally back on actually solid ground, that doesn&#39;t have camels in large quantities.<br><br>In the last few months I&#39;ve stared at the ocean lots and have seen sharks and dolphins, swam in the granite ringed pool of a wadi, gotten lost in a Middle Eastern castle (or two), haggled for goods in open markets, accidentally bought silver, stared at the tallest buildings in the world (they&#39;re really tall!) and tromped through the ancient city of Petra. All that, and a lot of small boats, some with guns attached to them! Very exciting. Not much sleep. Lots of reading books in line to wait to eat. I&#39;ve also lived off Chex mix and coffee.  <br><br>I&#39;ve also wrote a lot, and have found loads of inspiration for getting back into writing PPC things, besides original stuff.<br><br>And on the topic of writing PPC things, since I&#39;ve been gone I know a few people had/have contacted me  and expressed interest in doing PPC cowrites for me- I remember for sure that Silentthunder is one, and that Scapegrace is another.<br><br>I can&#39;t put forth a massive claim that I know for 100% certain that I&#39;ll be able to be a <i>fast</i> coauthor, but if anyone&#39;s interested in doing a cowrite for a mission or just something set in HQ as well, feel free to hit me up, since I&#39;m definitely available and have internet on a far more regular basis.<br><br>-July who apparently is salty now?</p>

Along with standing lookout and manning the ship&#39;s helm- driving it!<br><br>But I&#39;ve been an OS now- Operations Specialist- which means when we&#39;re out to sea I stare at radar screens and track things that we find, so we know what they are and what they&#39;re doing. I also do fancy things on paper with pencils to do calculus problems so we can find out what track things are going on against us, so can tell whether something will be getting too close to us, and how fast it actually is going. <br><br>This means I sit under blue lighting and we all look Very Dramatic while trying to not fall asleep.<br><br>Currently however I&#39;m cranking- which means I&#39;m working in the galley and messdecks to help feed everyone. I have over the course of the last month or so because of this worked for 21 hours straight, cut hundreds of melons into smaller pieces of melon for people to eat, and cracked a few thousand eggs. <br><br>I have become so skilled at egg cracking that when I started, I could crack eggs one handed. <br><br>Now I can crack eggs one handed in the air against each other without breaking the other egg. My high score on this egg brutality is a dozen eggs against a single egg. <br><br>...As you can guess it can get pretty boring, cracking that many eggs. </p>

            <p>I was trying to buy gifts for friends. I picked out what looked to be cheap jewelry. <br><br>Get to the counter and they begin weighing it. This point,  I&#39;m going &quot;huh?&quot;. Pull some items aside and decide to not buy them after all due to price- 70$ for a string of pearls. <br><br>Eventually I pull out one of the items I bought and inspect it later and go &quot;... that is silver tarnish. This is a large silver bracelet. Oop.&quot;. The bracelet was about $50. Big chunky thing. <br><br>I also nearly bought a giant wooden camel for Huinesoron in defiance of sanity but thankfully for him I had no space for it anywhere. </p>

            <p>The landless baron returned with a storm to her back, doing its best to tear the flame painted sails from their lines and the mast, but her skill by now outpaced that of the wind and rain, long enough that her small vessel made it to the enclosed harbor of Borrd in time enough for the storm to descend into a strong drizzle.<br><br>This did not aid her especially, as her companion was displeased with the rain in the first place and not particularly behooved to listen to her whatsoever.<br><br>With coaxing, however, in the form of strong words and threat of violence— she did, after all, still have her sword, bound though it was— eventually he followed her away from the harbor docks, and out of the town.<br><br>After all, she still had someone to find, to ask after the news of everything that had occurred during her long travels— much had changed, this she knew.<br><br>However, those very changes beguiled her and prevented her from finding her hopeful source.<br><br>Eventually she found herself outside of Vaekew, standing before marble steps. Between her appearance— salt still visible on her oiled cloak, her windblown hair half out of its braid, eyes shadowed, the sword ather side— and that of her companion, passerby kept a fair and healthy distance, until finally she lost her patience and grabbed at one of the staff members leaving from the hospital itself.<br><br>&quot;I cannot find the baron Huinesoron,&quot; she said. &quot;For him I have a gift, so I must leave it to his lady instead. Ensure the delivery. You do not wish this one to wander.&quot;<br><br>The  staff member looked at her, and then her companion in disbelief before trying to protest. &quot;But—&quot;<br><br>&quot;And be aware! He has a foul temper!&quot; She paused a moment. &quot;Not the baron,&quot; she added.<br><br>To her odious companion she said, &quot;I am glad to be rid of you, you miserable thing. Mayhap Baron Huinesoron find some use for you!&quot;<br><br>He tried to spit at her, which she dodged. <br><br>The wanderer-baron left the camel to the baffled hospital staff member. She had other things to deliver and news to learn, and to people who were less difficult to find. </p>

Baron July brought it-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wait.&quot; Huinesoron held up a hand. &quot;Baron <i>July</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mm-hmm. She-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wasn&#39;t she the one who kicked me out of Pankae?&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn blinked. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure that was the Iric revolution,&quot; she pointed out, &quot;which was started by Dann - Juliette, I mean.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, I&#39;m certain she was involved.&quot; The baron chewed on his lip. &quot;And now she&#39;s sending me lumpy horses. I don&#39;t think I like her very much.&quot;<br><br>&quot;She&#39;s not so bad,&quot; Kaitlyn said with a shrug. &quot;She&#39;s good for a game of cards when the Council&#39;s getting dull.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron opened his mouth to reply, then paused. &quot;I thought that only happened in that awful play.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s amazing what you don&#39;t notice when you&#39;re declaiming,&quot; Kaitlyn said, smirking. Then her face set into harsh lines. &quot;Now get that foul-spirited spitting <i>beast</i> out of my hospital, or I&#39;ll remind you exactly why I went ^_^ back in the day.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... got it.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>So now he&#39;s got a camel. Heaven knows what he&#39;s going to do with it. (And no, I don&#39;t think Baron Me has had much contact with July since he holed up in Ozerbord; I&#39;m sure he&#39;d like her if he talked to her.)<br><br>That was hilarious.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;d skipped a bit in my head. Since Baron July ended up leaving Iric herself, Baron Me would probably have spent a fair chunk of time commiserating with her.

            <p>Welcome back, Val. We missed you, and we&#39;re all glad you&#39;re home safe. =]<br><br>Since you&#39;re technically a returnbie at this point, please accept this NG+ starter Pokémon!<br><img src="http://randompokemon.com/sprites/animated/693.gif"><br>Iiiiiiiit&#39;s Clawitzer!<br><br>And your starting item is:-<br><img src="http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/a/a0/Pyromaniac_Icon.png?version=3832c8809ccc80826840b32f111cb5bf"><br>Pyromaniac from <i>The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth</i>!<br><br>And no, I didn&#39;t fudge the rolls. Pyromaniac&#39;s a really, really good item on Clawitzer thanks to how Mega Launcher works: the item makes you immune to bullet, bomb, and pulse moves, and makes you heal off your own ones for 50% of the damage dealt. Combine that with Mega Launcher boosting the damage of pulse moves by 50%, and you have yourself some serious power. In singles, try a Modest one with EVs in Special Attack and HP, with Aura Sphere, Water Pulse, Ice Beam, and Dark Pulse in your move slots. Doubles, however, is a different story; you want to go for Heal Pulse over Ice Beam, I think. Heal Pulse with Mega Launcher heals 75%(!) of the target&#39;s maximum HP... and thanks to Pyromaniac, YOU get healed for half that! Team it with a Chansey or something and watch yourself become unstoppable! Just remember, though: have fun. =]</p>

Miguel and I have almost gotten caught up on the movies; sadly, it's a lot harder than I expected to find <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> on a reliable streaming website. </p>

<p>Miguel: Hi! How do you think the new movie's going to impact your end of canon? Which side did you choose, if any? Chris has come down firmly on Captain America's side; I'm on the fence, and the girls are staying out of it (each for completely different reasons, which I won't disclose on pain of getting punched in the jaw).</p>

            <p>Agent Chris, I think you might be mistaken, I'm not from Earth-199999, which is the designation of the Cinematic Universe by the way, but from Earth-616, the main Marvel Universe; and as such, my knowledge of that universe is severily limited. Also, I also would be most grateful if people stopped confusing both universes.</p>

<p>And Mr. Correa, regarding my stance on the Superhuman Civil War, SH.I.E.L.D. as a law enforcement agency, had to be sided with Mr. Stark and the Superhuman Registration Act, thus... Wait. You meant Earth-19999 too!? <i>Would you people stop doing that!?</i> Please, is annoying!</p>

            <p>I was also talking about the MCU. <em>dodges supression fire</em> Eh, it's not our fault if Personnel didn't release a fiche about you stating your homeverse. Without that, we have to play guess about your verse and, well, the MCU is the one with the most attention for the moment, so it leads to that.</p>

<p>P.S.: Super Registration Act is a thing, but the dude supervising that is 'Thundrbolt' Ross, a guy who gives no duck about risks for civilians, is totally irresponsible when it comes to Hulk, who wanted a whole army like him, created the Abomination... Is that really the guy you would trust for the job? Or the government who pretty much gifted HYDRA with three Helicarriers or was ready to nuke Manhattan before complaining about how much damage the Avengers can cause?</p>

            <p>We don't know each other all that well yet, but we'll try to answer as best we can.</p>

<p>Larkus: </p>

<p>What I find most irritating about Curff is his attitude. I'm a pretty friendly person, when I'm not on duty I like to get to know people, but Curff just wants to be left alone all the time. He's cold and aloof, and it gets on my nerves.</p>

<p>What I like about him is that he's dependable. We might not always agree on what needs done or how to do it, but when we settle our differences I know I can count on him. Reliability is a pretty big plus in a crazy place like HQ.</p>

<p>Curff: </p>

<p>As for me, I find Larkus' diligent nature tiring. I certainly appreciate his professionalism, but stars above, he's already giving me headaches correcting me on canon details. Saints help me when we start keeping charges.</p>

<p>To his credit, however, he is a practical enough sort not to apply that attitude to everything. Indeed, I find I quite enjoy his sensibility. Far too often in my life I have found myself in the company of people who were variously insane, impractical, immoral, or simply bizarre. It is quite refreshing to partner with a more balanced individual.</p>

            <p>Well, it is somewhat hard to tell precisely, but I tend to think that I come from the movies. That ties into your next question quite nice. See,  I did go to Hogwarts and I somewhat remember the moving staircases, which seem to come more from them, with Hogwarts in the books being more like Headquarters, just shifting around in general and being really confusing.  And well, I'm what people around here call a semi-fic bleep. Giving that my homefic was never published and got deleted, most of my memory is not all that clear. I can't tell for sure exactly when I attended, but I do know that I was in Gryffindor and that played as a Beater in the House's Quidditch team. </p>

            <p>Always nice to meet a housemate! And I can kind of relate—I'm from a fanfic as well, though it's based on the books from what my partner has told me. Apparently it was supposed to have a lot of angst, but I ended up in HQ before that could happen. What is playing Quidditch like? I've always wanted to try it but I... wasn't able to make the team because of scheduling issues.</p>

            <p>Then likewise, it's nice to meet a fellow housemate. And I'm glad that you spared from apparently worse parts of your home badfic. My partner came from a pretty horrible ''Digimon'' one and she had live through most of it before agents in charge could properly deal with the fic and rescue her. </p>

<p>Did you get to finish Hogwarts before ended up here? For my part, I already had and had begun training to be a healer, as was traditional in family , apparently, before my fic got deleted and I ended up here through a plothole. </p>

<p>Well, from what I remember, playing was quite a fun experience. My teammates were probably not fleshed out all that much, so I can't comment on what it was playing in the team. What I can say is that it did payoff pretty later on. The strenght that is needed to batter up those Bludgers comes quite in handy for physically attacking Warior Sues, for examples. </p>

<p>And well, it is somewhat rare to actually get to play Quidditch around here, though I try to do it as much possible.But have ever try to play in the All-HQ Australian Indoor-Rules Quiddich League? Granted, that game is not quite actual Quidditch and may more suited for Beaters anyway, but it is a pretty good substitute and a fine game on its own.</p>

            <p>Henry: Well, it has been interesting so far. Aiko likes quite a bit of Magical Girl shows, so we tend to get dragged into badfics for those occasionally. The magic in most of those is quite different from the one I use. Most don't have defined spells behind those special attacks used to defeat monsters.</p>

<p>The closest to the Potterverse magic system that I have seen would probably be that Nanoha show and even that is still quite different. Way flashier and more destructive, but still somehow less lethal in most fights. I haven't seen that one firsthand in a mission yet though. That will likely prove to a quite interesting experience. </p>

<p>Aiko: Well, the obvious choice for my favorite season would have to be a tie between <i>Digimon Adventure</i> and <i>Digimon Adventure 02</i>. Those are where my parents came from, after all.  It is really nice to watch what they were like when they were younger, how they were such strong friends. Though watching the epilogue to 02 is still somewhat of a sore point for me. It reminds me that I couldn't possibly exist in canon. I mean, there is no official word way or the other on wheter they got together, but it is pretty clear that they both had sons regardless. It is always a difficult momentfor me. </p>

<p>But it always refreshing to see what Davis was really like. He may have been jealous about mom, but he was a good friend and not anything like the monster they made him out to be in my home badfic. </p>

<p>Picking a least favorite season is the hardest choice. I will have to admit that I probably haven't watched as many seasons as I should have, being from that universe and all. I'm most familiar with the first four seasons. 
Out of <i>Tamers</i> and <i>Frontier</i>, I don't think there is one I dislike all that much. Though if I had to pick, I would have to say <i>Frontier</i>. It is not a bad season per say, but the differences between it and the others seasons tend to be a point of contention from what I have heard.</p>

            <p>Hello there,</p>

<p>I'm afraid we didn't quite get to chat last time— something about you being locked up or in danger, yes? I was wondering if we could still compare notes about each other's apocalypse. In fact, let's waste no time and start right now: my series of unfortunate events starts in 2025 with the establishment of the Department of Efficiency. And you?</p>

<p>I've never heard of the Department of Efficiency.  We only had the Department of Resistance where I come from.  It was formed when the Sue invasion took over HQ in...2015?  2016?  I can't remember.  My head's still fuzzy.</p>

            <p>Mary Sue invasion? No, we never dealt with that. But perhaps it wouldn't be such a bad idea to bulk up External Security and Internal Affairs some more... I'll send Tacitus to do it later, then. Time is of the essence.</p>

<p>As for my future... it's complicated. It happened once, in an alternate timeline. Then travellers from that timeline came back and told us of the oncoming civil war. Naturally, it got complicated— efforts to prevent the civil war resulted in an even more insidious and aggressive DoE— and so after <i>that</i> conflict came to an end some close friends came back from the future to prevent the original timeline from being altered. And I'm caught in the middle, trying to make sure that the timeline doesn't revert back to the apocalypse scenario. </p>

<p>So technically, yes: we do exercise some control over the timeline. We just have to play our cards carefully... </p>

<p>What else can you tell me about your invasion? What happened? Was there an occupation?</p>

            <p>It's good to know that someone can do something.</p>

<p>I don't remember much about the Invasion right now.  The doctors tell me I hit my head pretty hard and fell into the fountain.  I do remember some things, though; running and hiding, mostly.  We never saw them coming.  Then we spent years fighting and hiding.  Always hiding.  We couldn't leave.  No way out.  We lost so many.  </p>

<p>I don't remember you, Gaspard, I'm sorry.  I don't know if you were with us, or if you died, or if you... I hope you got out and that you're still out there somewhere.  It'd be nice to know that someone got out.</p>

            <p>Knowing me, I probably took an RA and ran. I'm not a fighter: heck, I was thrown out of DMS because I chickened out when it came time for my first assassination. Not that I would've made a difference anyways— well, besides being a scrawny meat shield. I'm not good at very many things to be honest. Perhaps my flailing torso blocked a fatal blow to someone more important? That would've been okay with me, I think.</p>

<p>And it does sound like you survived a Suvian occupation. In that case, best of luck with your mission. Our timestreams may be mutually exclusive but I guess we're in the saving-a-doomed-timeline club together. Speaking of which, would you like help with that broom closet? I can arrange for someone from Security come over and shoo away whoever is chasing you.</p>

            <p>...but I'm doing my best to make sure the timeline rejoins <i>yours</i>. I'm on your side, honest! But if I stop trying to change the future, the river of time tries to settle into its old bed and force my timestream back into the apocalyptic version of the Sundering. The signs are everywhere— one only has to look. A whisper of time-travellers over here, secret information being passed on there,  a promotion to Mansfield's Active Recruitment Division... it's all headed to armageddon unless I actively suppress it. </p>

<p>I'd love to stop, but I can't. I have to carry on— but I find I'm getting more and more tired and numb as the days go by and it's getting harder to concentrate on this. I think I'm not getting enough sleep...</p>

Ya gnomish Trolls dat got electrocuted so dere hair stan's up.  Some kinds is rocky and some kinds is grey wit horns.  All kinds'a Trolls.  So, if I had ta pick one, I gotta go wit da Jotnar Troll.

            <p>Nikki: My magic is pretty much stable now. In fact, in my last month or so in the PPC the only thing that still happened was the random mermaid transformation - but I'm learning how to control that, too. There have been a couple occasions in which it was actually useful, like that time against Alyxx Heart, so that's the only "alternate" transformation for my magic that I don't want to lose after all.
I still haven't been able to force the costume change into something diffferent than a seashell bra, though. That's annoying.</p>

<p>Sergio: About Card Captor Sakura... Well, neither of us was expecting that. It's a strange feeling.</p>

<p>Nikki: Yeah. In a way, that will let me see how different from Sakura I am... though, to be fair, I'm not very interested in that anymore.</p>

<p>Sergio: We got asked if we could come back in case of a badfic explosion, by the way. We're not doing that, but we might take on some missions as contractors. Not doing anything about that would feel wrong.</p>

            <p>In all honesty, I am not sure what possessed me to act as I did, especially considering that the Doktor is as prickly as a moonrascal. The Knights of Alleble are not forbidden to marry, but... is it harsh to say that I am not sure I would wish to marry something like a fish? A fish with an accent that I can only barely understand? Oh, bother this whole mess! I fear I have given him the wrong impression about everything. He seems genuinely pleasant--I must make amends with him. </p>

<p>In short... I do not think so. I hope we shall be friends, though.</p>

            <p>I had Meganium, obviously, and I remember that at different times I had a Seel, a Vulpix, a Miltank named Canada, the red Gyarados from Lake of Rage, and a Togepi/Togetic. It's safe to say I had at least one of the generic ones--Pidgey, Caterpie, Sentret, et cetera--at various points in time. Sorry I can't answer your question more; Limbo really did a number on my memories.</p>

            <p>... I'm not very good at writing Morgan as anything other than a maudlin drunk unless she has something to do/comment on. But I'm also really <i>really</i> bad at cowriting anything of any length. These two things do not play well together.</p>

            <p>I have a cowrite with Lily Winterwood which has been stationary for a year. I have one with Neshomeh which I've written all of one passage for. The three-person cowrite 'Brown Dragonrider of Pern' took three or four years to finish.</p>

<p>I am spectacularly bad at cowriting, I promise you. A Morgan-Ave mission would finish sometime in 2020.</p>

            <p>Alex: It's going great, actually! I'm still working on building my own--I don't have a lot of time between other projects, but it's coming along--so in the meantime I've been borrowing a training lightsaber. I started off with Shii-Cho, but switched over to Soresu pretty fast after that blaster-wielding Sue broke in that one time... </p>

<p>As for Farilan, she's--well, I don't think I'm supposed to say what I think about her in public. I'll just say I really, really enjoy making her fetch me snacks. Hey, that's one of the best things about being a Techie: getting to do the ordering instead of getting ordered around. Good times, good times.</p>

<p>The Aviator: Yeah, I went there once, with the Guardsman. I don't want to talk about what happened.</p>

<p>As for my parents, there was... Lots of crying. Lots of yelling. Lots of hugging. We've made up since then and I managed to get a few hours off with Alex to spend his birthday at their house. Dad loved getting to see the inside of a TARDIS; he's the one who introduced me to <i>Doctor Who</i>, so it felt right to repay the favor.</p>

            <p>I've been <i>trying</i> to read the books because Technician Dives insists it's important I know where I came from, but it's so dreadfully boring and cringeworthy. Why would anyone want to read about human children and Prince Elfangor breaking the law of Seerow's Kindness? And don't get me started on his brother, Aximili. What an absolute disgrace he is.</p>

            <p>Thought it would be formative to see your all-and-mighty species indulging in mass slaughter, black-ops for mass slaughter, trying to initiate mass slaughter once your enemy is defeated, and discovering that your culture was nutured from the very start by a nerd possessing some serious powers. I find that telling that Aximili and Elfangor are the best and brightest examples of your species in these books. Including Aldrea of course.</p>

            <p>(( Warning: This post contains swearing. ))</p>

<p>I can just about stand the first one, even with all the lens flares, but I gave up after the second. I actually wrote down my screed about it for the first one of these mailbox things. I never finished it or tried to refine it, because I'm pretty sure I'd have an aneurysm if I did, but here it is:</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>I hear all you modern kids and newcomers to this dimension thought it was great. Obviously you're all too green to know the difference between an homage and a ripoff—between fanservice and pandering. Well, pay attention, because I'm here to tell you all the ways you're mixed up. You would basically have to either know nothing about the original <i>Star Trek</i> or simply have lost all capacity to give a shit to enjoy this lazy, recycled assfest of a film.</p>

<p>Where to even begin.</p>

<p>Let's start with how pointless everything is in this film. I'll admit I was intrigued by the opening sequence and the idea of Cowboy Kirk actually receiving consequences for his actions. Kirk loses the <i>Enterprise</i> just before the start of the five-year mission? Interesting! Maybe he'll have to do some honest goddamn work and learn a thing or two before he gets it back. Maybe he'll be less of an idiot in this universe.</p>

<p>Or maybe he'll have to do jack shit and learn nothing because the plot conveniently kills off poor Captain Pike before his time, landing the <i>Enterprise</i> in Kirk's lap again. Pointless.</p>

<p>And then there was the whole rest of the film. There are no meaningful consequences for anything that happens in it. At the end, we're exactly where we were in the beginning: Kirk and crew are all set to go off on the five-year mission, Khan is a popsicle, and the Federation is poised on the brink of war with the Klingon Empire. Whoop-de-doo.</p>

<p>Oh, but we might have discovered a <i>cure for death</i>, though. I guess that happened. Now we don't have to worry about anyone making a meaningful sacrifice ever again! As long as they're mostly intact, they'll be fine!</p>

<p>Y'know why Spock's death had meaning in the original <i>Wrath of Khan</i>? Because we all thought that was the end. We didn't know there was another movie coming after that. That was <i>it</i>. No more Spock. No more <i>Star Trek</i>. His death was symbolic of the end of an era. And he had fucking earned that scene.</p>

<p>Let's talk about earning your moments. This film doesn't.</p>

<p>The reveal of Khan? Well, who the fuck is that? This universe didn't have a "Space Seed" to set the stage and show us why Khan is a big deal. We didn't get a full hour of the <i>Enterprise</i> slowly coming to realize exactly what kind of madman they had on their hands, leading finally to the difficult choice to maroon him on some desolate space rock where he couldn't do any damage. This film just tells us, "Oh, by the way, this is Khan. He's a superhuman from three centuries ago and he's a bad guy, okay?" And we're expected to gasp when we hear his name!</p>

<p>The Kirk death scene? Bullshit. I've already talked about Spock's death out of universe. Let's talk in-universe. By <i>Wrath of Khan</i>, Kirk and Spock had a steadfast friendship going back twenty years or so. They'd worked together, fought together, shared... all right, the tears and laughter weren't exactly shared, but you know what I mean. Shut up. The point is, "I have been and ever shall be your friend" had decades of weight behind it. They each knew exactly what that moment meant to the other.</p>

<p>In <i>Into Darkness</i>, they've known each other for what, a year? Less? I don't know. They're still working things out. NuSpock hasn't even got a chink in his armor for his girlfriend oh God don't even get me started on that, <i>fuck</i>. Anyway. This guy. We're expected to believe he's going to cry for Kirk. Really? Why? Based on what? They don't have a lifetime of friendship and profound shared experiences. They don't even get along that well. All I can think is that they're trying to appeal to the Kirk/Spock slashers in the most blatant and pandering way possible, for which I can only say shame on them. I mean, don't get me wrong, everybody's love is equal<s>ly none of my business thank you very much</s>, but don't go there unless you mean it. Don't taunt people.</p>

<p>This brings me to the Khan! shout. Not earned. Out of place. Khan didn't kill Kirk, Kirk's idiocy killed Kirk. The Khan! shout in <i>Wrath of Khan</i> happened after a classic villain speech of epic proportions.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>And that is where I had to stop or pass out due to hyperventilation.</p>

<p>The trailers for the third movie make me want to resign from the human race. I keep telling myself I won't even watch it, but I know I will anyway. Somebody shoot me.</p>

<p>—Agent Supernumerary</p>

<p>(( Obligatory disclaimer: Nume's opinions are not necessarily those of the management. I do think the trailers for the third film look appalling, though. The don't feel like <i>Star Trek</i> to me at all. ))</p>

            <p>I was so happy believing this could never be brought up again. It's kind of embarrassing. ... Oh well.</p>

<p>No, Fey Wine isn't dangerous—well, not exactly. Maybe sort of. It's a very potent aphrodisiac, enough to drive any non-fey to a "sex or die" level of desperation. Pretty much impossible to resist. You should probably be glad it's from an unknown original continuum.</p>

<p>The Incident was that somebody (I don't remember who anymore; might've been one of our ship-happy teenage authors) thought it would be hilarious to slip some into the tea one day in the Lounge. Long story short, that's how I got to know Agent Reria really, really well. And she was nice enough to let me have some of her cool leather clothes afterward, too.</p>

<p>If you REALLY wanna know the whole story, I'll tell you, but first you have to promise not to go spreading it around, okay?</p>

            <p>Loathe as I am to ask this... what is the correct form of socialization for a Pernese dragonet? I worry that, given the fact that my standing in the community is about as high as the ankle socks of a particularly small beetle, he is missing out on contact with other dragonets and that this might be affecting him adversely. I can function in graceful solitude; people cannot, in my experience. Rest assured that no other help presented itself, and was generally met with derision or threats of physical violence against my person if I sent another fourteen-page missive concerning Lolus' health, mental state, and dietary preferences.

            <p>You don't actually have to worry about that. Impressed fire-lizards are tame, not domesticated; they've lost none of their wild instincts. They're telepathic and they can teleport at will, so they'll find each other when they want to socialize, and they'll be fine. (Speaking of which, I should probably remind everyone to make a decision about spaying/neutering soon. I recommend that owners of blues and greens especially have it done.)</p>

<p>The bad news is, they don't naturally know how to socialize with people. That takes training, with which I am always ready to help.</p>

-Bolding the username, though that might clash with find-the-current-post.
-Changing link or username colour, though frankly that wouldn't stand out to me.
-Larger font, but I suspect that'll mess with the general structure of the place.</p>

<p>I'd be inclined to one of the first two options. What I <i>don't</i> think would work is a tag; there's enough of those already, and I'm pretty much ignoring them at this point. Alarm-flood.</p>

<p>Also, a little more space or something to offset the post you're currently reading would be nice. When I look at a post in this thread, my eyes tend to latch onto SeaTurtle's original post before the one I'm trying to read, and I'm guessing it's because of the big white space between the reply/watch/return buttons and the OP content.

            <p>I do okay on missions. I'm DMS-Freelance, with a specialisation in fantasy (what, you thought I worked sci-fi?); the Flowers have developed a liking for keeping me without a partner and sending me in as a solo specialist when other departments need one. I don't like to write up what're really their missions, so I leave it to them.</p>

<p>... which, now I come to look, means there aren't any reports with me in them. I guess all my partners have been of the don't-like-writing variety.</p>

<p>But yeah, I do okay. Haven't gotten myself killed yet, at least. My biggest disaster was probably ducking through a wardrobe at the wrong time and spending sixty-odd years in Narnia before my partner followed me through (long story), but hey, Time Lady, I can cope with that.</p>

            <p>Ruby Shipwright Fisherman: I like Red. He's not a grump. That's kind of a rarity among our Time Lords - or Time Lords in general, just look at the Doctor's most recent set of eyebrows!</p>

<p>Tigereye Castellan Morgan: Wouldn't trust her as far as I can throw her.</p>

<p>Citrine Theorist/Onyx Monitor Reader: Our little radical. I hear she's been going through some angst outside the Council, but in my head, she's pretty much the one who'd be most likely to <i>stop</i> being a Time Lord out of dislike for our history.</p>

<p>Jade Warden Librarian: Green is actually really useful if you want to know stuff. When I- this is out of continuity, right? So I'm allowed to say this. When I had my little breakdown and took over the multiverse, I really wanted the Librarian on my side; I think if we'd had him, we wouldn't have failed at the end. He <i>is</i> a grump, though.</p>

<p>Sapphire Watcher Disentangler: Dis is fun. She has no respect for the Council, but, well, you've read about them, right? And when the Notary starts acting up, it's good to have someone on hand to snark about her. I can't (much), due to my role, so... yeah, I like Dis.</p>

<p>Amethyst Keeper Agent: Pink is simultaneously Dis's partner in crime, and her straight man. Also, he doesn't get furious when I call him Pink. I like him.</p>

<p>Spinel Promotor Notary: The Notary is a hateful, Rassilon-loving racist with a cruel streak a mile wide. I can't believe I ever thought she was in any way worth having around.</p>

<p>Moonstone Sentry Aviator: The new kid. The Aviator is pretty quiet at Council meetings most of the time, but when she does talk, she seems to have a sound head on her shoulders. I don't particularly know her as a person, but as a colleague, I have no problems with her.</p>

            <p>How're you doing? Snubbed any interesting species lately? I know a few you could persecute unreasonably without fear of starting a minor war if you're interested.</p>

<p>I may be drunk, but I'm not drunk enough to gossip about my colleagulants with you. Except the Notary, because seriously, <i>the Notary</i>. Have you met her? She's an awful person. I thought she was misunderstood, but NOPE. She's just awful.</p>

<p>Kind of like you. You should get together. She could claim Time Lords are innately superior to someone, you could claim the same someone is irredeemably evil, and then you could make little bigoted babies together. It's be like reality TV, but even worse.</p>

<p>Wait, HQ doesn't have a reality TV show yet. I should talk to the folks at Nutmeg...</p>

            <p>Though I'm not quite sure shere you're pulling the 'racist' from. If it's about that one time ages ago about my opinion on the Daleks, well, you're right. I do despise them. If you were in my boots, you'd hate them too. Aside from that, I'm not laughably one-dimensional as you perceive me to be-- I can be two dimensional too, you know. Not that you'd believe me, though.

<p>As for a potential relationship with the Notary, I'm sure you know by now that we don't see eye to eye. Ask her about the woman in the picture-- and get ready for an endless stream of blackmail. </p>

<p>Also, have you been back to Gallifrey recently? It's springtime in Arcadia and the flowers are out. Over by Yenovar Boulevard there's this wonderful garden and it's filled with everblossoms and asgores. It's quite nice-- you should definitely visit. </p>

            <p>Your big stompy boots, right? Not that I'm going to get into an argument about this, but no-one is saying Daleks in general are safe to be around.

<p>I dunno why I'd want to ask the Notary anything. I'm sure you've got some sort of hatemance thing going on, that'd be about par for the course around here. "Raaaar, I hate you, you're under arrest, kiss me you mad fool," that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Haven't been back home. Don't trust the place any more.

<p>In all seriousness, though, is it really a stretch to believe that people can change opinions over time? I won't say more given the fact that you aren't sober and have a firmly entrenched idea of who I am. Even the best tennis player will lose against a wall, you know. </p>

<p>And what is it with you younglings and seeing romance everywhere? It's absolutely maddening. Apparently you can't have a good old-fashioned grudge anymore. Nowadays there's got to be some sexual tension involved. Do grow up. </p>

<p>Quite frankly, your pessimism at Gallifrey's situation is a bit overboard. From an out-of-continuum perspective, the BBC won't try to pull the 'Time Lords Are Evil!' card out of its hat that soon. Besides, haven't you seen Hell Bent? The Doctor destroyed the old order during his last visit. We have a chance to truly reclaim the Homeworld and impose reforms that will pull us out of the Dark Ages and into a brighter future. Have faith-- we can do this. </p>

            <p>... it's really annoying not being able to ask what day it is because you Just Know the answer. Oh well.</p>

<p>I see that I was an utterly awful conversationalist those last few messages; I'm just going to offer a blanket 'sorry' for everything I said there. Moving on? Moving on.</p>

<p>I don't know you. You work in security, which predisposes me to dislike you, but okay, you might be an okay person. I'll keep an open mind about that.</p>

<p>'Younglings'... heh. You know that thing where Legolas says the trees of Fangorn almost make him feel young again, as he hadn't since travelling with "you children"? Yeah, welcome to being a tree. Seriously, <i>why</i> do the Flowers recruit so many young agents? Couldn't they wait until they're 40 or 50 or so and give them time to mature? I dunno. I need a- no, no I don't.</p>

<p>Gallifrey. Gallifrey, Gallifrey, Gallifrey. <i>Did</i> the Doctor throw out the 'old order'? He kicked out Rassilon - which, y'know, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ejLQfscSCAOrMKA9A4RfYduXuYnxbxNQ417y6220blo/pub">might not have been the best idea</a> anyway - but when was the last time Gallifrey had a <i>nice</i> political structure? I grew up around the time of the Sontaran invasion; I don't know what you were up to back then, but I remember very clearly the oppressed underclass we called Outsiders invading the Citadel. I love my planet, but it could be a rotten place if you weren't on the Council itself.</p>

<p>Also... well, do we really <i>want</i> the Time Lords to be active in the universe? I mean, we're not the most stable of races, and with time travel it only takes one nutcase to - oh - murder half of Logopolis and lead to the destruction of half the universe? For example.</p>

<p>I dunno. I just... I don't <i>trust</i> Gallifrey, is the problem. I don't trust it not to die on me, and I don't trust it to be sane towards the rest of reality. I want to go home... but I don't think 'home' ever really existed.</p>

            <p>Remember: I'm older than everybody on the Continuity Concil combined-- so show some respect to your elders, please. </p>

<p>Well, not only did the Doctor throw a vengeful Rassilon out into the outer edge of the spacetime continuum, he also shipped the rest of the High Council with him. Now, of course there's no way in hell <i>that</i> is going to come around and bite him in the ass but that's besides the point. A new government will form, probably full of men and women who have witnessed firsthand the War and who will want nothing to do with it. We were never a prolific race, but our numbers were severely affected by the War-- we can't afford to ignore parts of our population anymore. Besides, there were many Outsider military units that distinguished themselves over the course of the conflict: the Dry Lands Fusiliers, the 77th Airborne, and hell-- some of them even made it into the Marines. Their sacrifices won't be forgotten anytime soon. Point is-- I feel we're a lot more unified than before. We'll rise from the ashes and rebuild. </p>

<p>And our new role doesn't have to be active-- if we so much stick our heads out again, we're going to trigger a new Time War. The new government knows that and I doubt they'd strike when we have no desire to fight anymore. </p>

<p>But I suppose I'm biased. I sank three and a half millennia into fighting for the safety of the Homeworld-- I'm not going to let our second chance go to waste. </p>

            <p>I don't think I'm drunk enough for that question to make sense. Gimme a minute.</p>

<p>Right, I think I've got this. HQ is an utter nightmare, temporally speaking. The one time I've tried to make a point-to-point TARDIS flight in here, I ended up six years in the past. Even flights out aren't always safe - this one time, we got dumped in an alternate universe where everyone was a Time Lord. Can you imagine, an entire PPC filled with Time Lords? It was horrible. They made me drink tea.</p>

<p>I don't know that any of my idi- colleagues have tried to deliberately time-travel within HQ. It's possible anyone who did has wiped themselves from history; the original Continuity Council proposal included an Opal President and the Onyx Monitor as a separate position, so there's two candidates for you right away. I might be a bit alarmist about this, but I've had my own experience with erased timelines. I wouldn't try to induce one on purpose.</p>

<p>Unless the Notary's listening. In which case, Spinel Promotor, can you pop back to Event One and pick up my coat for me? I think I left it there.</p>

<p>For that matter, you don't <i>need</i> a TARDIS to time-travel in HQ, which might be what you were getting at. It seems like every time there's a party someone from the past drops in. Perhaps alcohol, in addition to being the foundation of economics, also exerts a temporitational field on local space...?</p>

<p>Ah. Now I'm <i>too</i> drunk for this question.</p>

            <p><b>Constance:</b> I don't miss it. You're right, there's a few things I <i>do</i> miss - not having to go shopping, easy access to medications, the social aspects of HQ, being able to choose which of my departments to spend the day on, the occasional 'lull you into a false sense of security' quiet days, the weapons, the-</p>

<p><b>Dafydd:</b> Er, Connie...</p>

<p><b>Constance:</b> ... but I don't miss it. Honest. Your turn.</p>

<p><b>Dafydd:</b> Well... I don't miss the stress, or the hours, or the working conditions and superiors in general. The job itself? I don't miss the brain-melting aspects of it. Or the parts that lead to, e.g., people's hands getting blown up. And I can't tell you how happy I am not to have to feel narrative compression every time I step out of the door.</p>

<p><b>Oleander:</b> I miss the sweeties!</p>

<p><b>Constance:</b> ... you weren't in the PPC, Ol.</p>

<p><b>Oleander:</b> Bu' I <i>want</i> to be in the BBC! I <i>want</i> to.</p>

<p><b>Dafydd:</b> Not until you're much older, baby boy.</p>

<p><b>Jasmine:</b> Yeah, Olly. Like me. I'm <i>much</i> older than you.</p>

<p><b>Oleander:</b> I want to be older than <i>you</i>. I <i>want</i> to.</p>

<p><b>Tanfin:</b> That's not how being older works, Oleander.</p>

            <p>Ever since Agent Kaitlyn highlighted my... propensity towards... well, you know.</p>

<p>All right. My tendency to think of my race as superior, even in cases where- I mean, even though that's not true, I've tried to make improvements. I don't know for sure how well I've managed, though.</p>

<p>I've not met any of the others you mention, but I've heard that some - not all - Time Lords suffer from the same problem. If either of the pair you mention are unable to break out of the mindset that their species is better than any other, I would hazard that one of them would fit the bill.</p>

            <p>I am operating on the assumption that you are curious about "the best kisser" of those agents tied to this particular mailbox. Judging our collective kissing abilities would require a certain level of… experimentation, I suppose. As we have never engaged in this activity, I would have to say</p>

<p><font color="purple">Let me cut you off there, Xerry. It's me. I'm the best. Gremlin, that is.</font></p>

<p>Gremlin, we have discussed this before. I thought that we agreed you would no longer use your electromagnetic manipulation to hijack my online posts. </p>

<p><font color="purple">Yeah, I know, and I'm sorry. But this is a subject I have a little bit of experience in. I've smooched plenty of people, and I'd like to think I'm a pretty good judge of it. No one's ever complained before.</font></p>

<p>So then you have kissed the agents in question?</p>

<p><font color="purple">Well… no. But I'd like to think that I can leverage my worldly experiences into some very accurate guesses.</font></p>

<p>I see. On the one hand, I feel I should close out this answer now and leave it as is. That being said, I am curious as to your conclusions. It is a curiosity born of weariness and bile, but it still exists. Go ahead. Lay out your theories.</p>

<p><font color="purple">Cool. First off, there's Laura. I think it's pretty likely that she's never kissed anyone. Not only is she a bigger pain in the rear than me</font> (A remarkable feat in itself.) <font color="purple">Hush, you! Not only that, but she's something of a homebody. She only likes people when they've been filtered through something like Skype or a video game chat window. That being said, she doesn't back down from anything. I see her kisses as being inexperienced, quick, but very energetic. Definitely not the best.</font></p><font color="purple">

<p>Then there's James. I'm pretty sure he used to be married, so obviously he's got something going for him. Plus he's a little older. Probably got plenty of experience under his big leather belt. But that mustache! Personally, I'm not a fan of kissing people with bushy mustaches. It's an acquired taste. His hypothetical kisses would be to the point, maybe a little tender with time, but with a chaser of hair.</p>

<p></font><p><font color="purple">Then there&#39;s Danny. Heh… you&#39;d probably be better off asking Teyala Solnerii about his skills. I hear she has first hand experience. <i>Lots</i> of first hand experience.</font></p></p>

<p>I asked you to put forward your hypotheticals, Gremlin, not engage in water cooler rumormongering.</p>

<p><font color="purple">Fair enough. Cornelius is a no go area. Sure, he can make his light form solid with technology, but that's no fun. Rachel, though, would be the epitome of fun. She's bouncy, she's excitable, and she loves the idea of love itself. I see her being a bit like Laura, all enthusiasm and slight awkwardness. But while Laura would be an angry kisser — I can just see her planting one on some guy before pushing him away and giving him the cyber-finger — Rachel would be a lot of little kisses all in a row, with some cuddling to follow.</font></p><font color="purple">

</font><p><font color="purple">Finally, there's Xericka.</font></p>

<p>No. While this exercise has been an interesting peek into your subconscious, I must draw the line on your speculating about my own abilities.</p>

<p><font color="purple">Well, it isn't exactly <i>speculation</i>. I mean, you and I… uh… </font></p><font color="purple">

<p>Um…</p>

<p>Okay, I think I'm going to have to leave things there. Xericka's just stood up from her computer and is glaring at me. Like, really glaring.</p>

<p></font><p><font color="purple">And now she&#39;s walking over. Gotta go! Peace! —G </font></p></p>

            <p>It was actually kind of a fluke, my getting into <i>Kingdom Hearts</i>. When I first heard about <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> back in 2002, I thought it was a joke. Mixing Disney with <i>Final Fantasy</i> seemed like the dumbest idea I'd ever heard. I certainly wasn't going to waste my allowance on that.</p>

<p>Then, out of the blue, my dad got me the game for my birthday. I never thought to ask why; maybe he thought I'd like the Disney stuff. He never really had a handle on what I saw in video games. I wasn't about to throw it back in my dad's face, so I started playing it.</p>

<p>And that was pretty much that.</p>

<p>It's an awesome series, provided you can wrap your head around the bonkers plot. Don't get me wrong, I love the story, but it's a bit wedged into its own rear. There's still plenty of ways to play it too; old consoles are getting cheap, and there are things like the various Remix titles that package a bunch of the games together.</p>

            <p>But then, I would get killed. And this is no joke to avoid answerin'.</p>

<p>The majority of warlock research and knowledge is stored in the archives of the Spiral Labyrinth. And at this point, if I say anythin' more, my <i>geis</i> will activate, so excuse me but I'd rather live for few more centuries. All I can say is, there is space between worlds called "the Void". Pandemonium is a rumored city of demons in the very centre of the Void. I'm a half-demon and I burn a lot of stamina when casting magic. Connect the dots, love.</p>

<p>P.S.: Y'all better brace yourselves. VJ says she's going to your RC to "collect the tribute". DO NOT LET HER TAKE ANYTHIN' ELSE!</p>

            <p>Though my old pistol is as accurate as may be expected, I'm sure you understand that it is not suitable for every continuum. Why, just last week my partner and I were obliged to exterminate a Suvian in the feudal Japan of the <i>Tales of the Otori</i>, and a flintlock would have been entirely anachronistic. For occasions where melee combat is unavoidable, I have adopted a tactic from someone of whom I have heard many great things and taken to carrying a ball-peen hammer with me; our cover in the field is so often as a workman or artisan of some kind that such a weapon is perfectly innocuous. However, in science-fiction continua, I have been obliged to raid the Commander's gun cabinet, and have developed a particular affinity for the <i>Farscape</i> continuum's pulse weaponry - in particular the mini pulse pistol, a weapon I consider most suitable for covert carrying and use; in modern-dress continua, I favour the cheap and profligate Zastava M70, a pistol of Czech manufacture, as 9mm hardball is still more than enough to give the common-or-garden Suvian lacking in body armour a quite exceptionally bad day.</p>

<p>I trust this is a full answer to your question, and hope that I have not rambled and taken up too much of your time.</p>

            <p>In XCOM: Long War, which was the primary continuum my homefic was based off (though I'm technically from the canon Whoniverse), Field Commander is the highest rank for a field officer. You're one step down from the Commander (in my case, Jack O'Neill from <i>Stargate: SG1</i>... yeah, DIC took one look at it and noped on outta there) and are basically their eyes and ears on the ground. They give you that rank in case you run into any obnoxious local-yokels on the ground who think they can boss you around when the plasma starts flying, basically.</p>

            <p>However, it is also a question I cannot answer with any degree of precision. I am not familiar enough with other "magical girl" universes. Further, while I might be a mage, I am a soldier first and foremost; I would imagine that I would do better in a universe with a military focus, like the <i>Command and Conquer</i> 'verse, than in one focused on non-mathematical "arcane" magic as, I am told, "magical girl" 'verses tend to be. I can do without magic; I don't believe I'll do well wearing a tuxedo and a mask and hopping from tree to tree.</p>

<p>I'm a Dresdenverse wizard, or so it seems that's the way I would be called here. Any human practicioner from my 'verse worth its salt will screw up tech. The stronger and less experimented they are, the worst it is. And it leads technology around me to experiment critical failure after critical failure, the more advanced it is the harder.

            <p>To Terabyte: How many programs are exactly forming you? I know for instance than Legion had 1183, but their chassis also was somewhat unique.</p>

<p>Last for the Guardsman: Do you intend to speak to your partners, and your other friends, about your <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=296272;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">little secret</a>?

<p>Tacitus: Did you ever tried to be more sympathetic? If only for the sake of your job. People tell more to people they like.</p>

            <p>Terabyte:</p>

<p>I am a single geth unit, upgraded with Reaper code and further enhanced by Commander Wilson Shepard's synthesis with the Crucible. My initial upgrades have permitted me to become a true intelligence and thus utilize a combat platform without the need to network with other geth. The second upgrade has enhanced my sentience, allowing me to fully understand what it means to be an organic. </p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Emiranlanoamar:</p>

<p>Naya and Terabyte know and so do Arin and Xandria. Out of all of them, Naya took it the hardest, actually. She clung to me for several hours after I had talked to her about it, asking me to resign from the PPC and go back home where I'd be safer. I never thought she'd have this reaction to me— she's always so standoffish.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Tacitus:</p>

<p>I need to be hated. When interacting with a client, I retain a professional attitude; one needs to maintain Madam's good reputation after all. However, any and all who attempt to get too friendly will be dealt with accordingly. Trust only leads to betrayal: it's a slow and insidious process. Nobody came for me back when I needed it the most— why should this time be any different? Why now? Time has taught me that my only worth is as an information broker and an insufferable presence. I know my place and I act like it.</p>

<p>But then I realized that I could be useful. People hate me, avoid me by nature. When I enter a room, they all turn away, form groups, and talk amongst themselves, making sure that I don't get a chance to insert myself in the conversation. They spread rumours about me and slander my name, furthering my isolation. When I sell some highly personal information on someone, they all rush to the "victim" and send them their support and sympathy. And that is good. You see, when I'm around, they band together and cooperate. They are <i>together</i>. I did this. Through my actions, they can have something which I will never know: friendship. Support. Maybe even companionship. </p>

<p>Everyone loves to hate and fight a villain. I just so happen to play the part perfectly. </p>

<p>And I hate every single moment of this [CENSORED] existence.</p>

            <p>Now, you're the only one left to ask this question. What do you think about your fellow Time Lords here in HQ? I know you're not part of this Council thing, but surely you have opinions.</p>

<p>The other one. There are nasty rumors about the fact that an agent Chandra, DIA, think that scrapping down HQ's TARDIS for components would be an efficient way of getting them out of the way, and she think that DoSAT would be grateful for that. (Yeah, and ask Daleks for directions is no dangerous...)
Your reaction about this?</p>

            <p>What if—and this is just an idea, mind—we let people fly them? I mean, this is HQ we're talking about. Probably the only places that surpass it in terms of people who would want to fly a TARDIS are World One and Gallifrey itself. With an entire Continuity Council of Time Lords running around, plus any agents who learned to fly them during the Macrovirus epidemic, there's bound to be a few agents around willing to act as instructors. Some of them might do it just to get a break from missions. There'd certainly be no shortage of students for them to teach, and we might even get a few agents who decide they want to keep theirs.</p>

<p>Okay, it might be a bit mad to leave a TARDIS in the hands of questionably sane individuals, but considering we already trust them with the disguise generator, the RA, and a multiversal armory... </p>

<p>Now I think about it, does Doctor Who have its own OFU yet? If so, loan a few to them. Show those fanbrats how hard it really is to fly the things. With the right security measures it should no more dangerous than giving students muggle-use wands. Heck, you could even go further with it, give TARDISes to a bunch of OFUs. Need a guaranteed safe haven in case of Mary Sue invasion? Boom, TARDIS. </p>

<p>...I can't actually think of any other uses an OFU would have for a TARDIS, but I'm sure there are at least a few more. </p>

<p>I don't know how many TARDISes we have in HQ, and we probably couldn't save all of them, but at least this way a few of them would get the use they deserve.</p>

<p>Do correct me if any of this is laughably infeasible. I am no more a Time Lord than I am an unfortunate cabbage salesman.</p>

            <p>In practice, it's a bit different. See, with the proper training, any person can fly a TARDIS well enough to get from Point A to Point B, but here's something not a lot of people realize about them: they're linked symbiotically to their Time Lord pilots thanks to the funky makeup of the nuclei of our cells, and the TARDIS' briode nebulizers and Rassilon Imprimature. Unless you're a Time Lord, you can't fly a TARDIS properly, and even then pilots tend to stick to one specific TARDIS because they get the best performance with the TARDIS they're linked to. I've had to fly the Doctor's TARDIS a few times on missions and she never responds to me as well as my own does, and that's why.</p>

            <p>Using the disguise generator to go Time Lord? Bad idea. Veeery bad idea. It took me months to become comfortable with my new abilities and years to get really used to them. Besides, you need time to really bond with a TARDIS, and a few stints at a time while in a disguise just wouldn't cut it.</p>

<p>As for the Chameleon Arch, that forcibly wipes your memories (and requires you to be a Time Lord to begin with), so that would be less than useless.</p>

            <p>My opinions on the members of our favourite little useless-drama club? You asked for it, you got it. Overall, they're a bunch of teens with serious angst issues that sit in a room and do nothing productive during their shouting matches. Y'know, aside from raiding museums and providing a source of antagonism for the HQ Daleks and pretending to be relevant when they did absolutely squat during the time they were active. It's honestly more of a social club with costumes more than anything. </p>

<p>The Fisherman seems like a fun guy. I haven't seen much of him lately but I hear he's a mellow fellow and great company overall. Out of all them, he's the one I'd trust the most— gut feeling. I just don't understand his name, though. Why "Fisherman"...?</p>

<p>Morgan. Oh, Morgan. She's always so angry about something— and that coupled with her drinking habits isn't a good combination. I haven't had much contact with her up until now but she's always struck me as an extremely guarded person with strong feelings. She's the sorta-ringleader of the ConCoun— for reasons I can't understand. I think It's doing more harm than good to her stress levels... and her liver.</p>

<p>I like Xandrialdimansiumar. When she's not busy brooding about something in her past, she's actually a little ray of sunshine. She's smart, collected, and a really good influence over my partner, Naya. The two have a romantic thing going on— they play it off as a huge joke by being overly saccharine when they're around me— but it's actually rather painfully obvious that they do care deeply for each other. </p>

<p>The Librarian. This guy... I don't respect a man who willfully abandons his unit while engaged with the enemy. His condescending attitude and general abrasiveness really doesn't help his cause either. The little I've seen of him in person just confirms that he's really not pleasant company. Apparently he's trying to turn over a new leaf with Arin's help, though. In that case, good luck with that to both of them. </p>

<p>Also, mark my words: if this <i>doesn't</i> turn out to be that situation where the weird, socially awkward boy falls in love with the girl that helped him come out of his shell, I swear to the gods that I will eat my hat. </p>

<p>The Disentangler and the Agent: lumping them together because I never see them apart. I don't really have an opinion on them due to the fact that I've never interacted with them whatsoever. So... moving on.</p>

<p>Antrilovorasilendar, the Notary. You know the Notary, I know the Notary, everyone knows the Notary... and loves to hate her. After all, anyone who makes it their personal mission to interfere with your work after you comment on a picture they carry with them is not right in the head. Now, this hints that she wasn't all bad in the past, sure— but we're dealing with the present now. And Present!Notary is not a good person. At this point I'm tired of her hateful little crusades against anyone who offends her. I just want her to grow out of her "I-hate-everyone" phase and find peace.</p>

<p>Ending on a high note: I like Arin. Apparently she considers me her second father or something— I'm not to sure how to feel about that. On one hand, I don't feel like I've done anything special to deserve her trust but on the other, she's a great kid and I want her to succeed in life. </p>

<p>As for the TARDISes... yeah, Inspector Chandra has been pushing for the decommissioning of the TARDIS fleet. In all honesty, I see the logic behind that. A TARDIS is a living thing too, you know— it needs to travel to stay healthy. Why d'you think the doors opened to Arin when she had her... episode? It was desperate to escape. DoSAT has got a whole room full of them gathering dust and doing nothing. Chances of reactivation are remote too, so... as loathe as I am to put down a TARDIS, this seems to be the humane thing to do. Forgetting about them and keeping them in limbo for all eternity is a hellish fate and the scrap material we can salvage from the TARDIS' innards can be repurposed to upgrade PPC technology.</p>

<p>So, tl;dr version: I'll assist if necessary, but it's not my call to make. </p>

            <p>But it seems pretty harsh for them. Most of them were 'created' because of one major problem, and now we're letting them taking the dust.

            <p>Though it seems like both of those are slightly strange options for a disguise. Isn't the whole point of the chameleon circuit to avoid drawing attention? A giant jack-in-the-box and a car famous for time travel aren't exactly inconspicuous.

            <p>Guardsman:</p>

<p>I don't own a TARDIS, son. Never did— unless you count my old regiment's Battle TARDIS and that one Type-103 we caught a ride in once. Back in the War, the standard disguise for a TARDIS was a reinforced neosteel bunker with gun ports, several exit hatches, and an entrance to the TARDIS proper. We needed a sturdy and practical design to carry us into the battlefield— something that would protect us as we deployed and provide cover during a fight. Nothing fancy, really: but "fancy" is just <i>that</i> much more likely to break. </p>

<p>As for the humanoid TARDIS... I hated that thing. It's freaky and it talks back to you and it's just full of nope. It made the most awful psychic noise when it died— I still get spooked just thinking about it.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Gaspard:</p>

<p>It's a bit difficult, but I can actually use it without a CMC. The trigger needs two fingers to properly pull on it and the lack of an actual stock and the sheer <i>weight</i> of the Impaler makes it difficult to fire but so long as it's set to three-round burst, I can actually tear those paper targets a new one. </p>

<p>This, of course, means that I'm absolutely incapable of using it in a fight <i>without</i> the CMC. And why would I get into a fight anyways? I'm a dime-a-dozen office drone, not an actual agent. </p>

            <p>I suppose I shouldn't have assumed you'd have one just because you're a Time Lord. Though I mostly posed the question to you because you seem to be the most experienced of HQ's Time Lords. Very enlightening nonetheless. Thanks.</p>

<p>Also, humanoid TARDIS? Did I miss something? When was that a thing? I'm confused.</p>

<p>Gaspard, I have to admit I'm curious why you picked the C-14. Seems a bit overkill to use a rifle that in its standard variant requires the use of a combat exoskeleton. Wouldn't something like, say, the MA5B work just as well?</p>

            <p>Emiranlanoamar:</p>

<p>Type-100s and above are humanoid TARDISes. Their Matrix can fully interact with their crew and pilots. Outwardly, they resemble humanoids. The first Type-100 or something was actually one of the Doctor's companions: she was implanted with TARDIS tech and it sort of... grew. Took over her, mutated her, turned her into a half-human, half TARDIS monstrosity. The Time Lords managed to negotiate a... <i>breeding</i> agreement with her and thus the first humanoid TARDISes were born. </p>

<p>Intelligent, cunning, and extremely creepy. 0/10, would not drive again.</p>

<p>Gaspard:</p>

<p>I'm compensating for my tiny and inadequate self-esteem.</p>

<p>Serious answer: a MA5B doesn't shoot 8mm uranium spikes at hypersonic speeds. Plus, I'm a Spy, not an action agent: if I need to defend myself, I'm going to set up an ambush where the odds are stacked in my favour. Otherwise, I keep moving. </p>

<p>I might need to swing by the armoury and pick up... er... a MA5<i>D</i>. Newer model, more bullets, and it even comes with custom finishes too. I just need to figure out where the iron sights are on that thing. The lore says they're hidden but... where? Under the casing? Is there a cover I need to pop off from the weapon computer cowl? Must be it, right...?</p>

<p>I need an MA5D now. For science. And dakka.</p>

            <p>I almost want to inquire further, but in the interest of avoiding spoilers (and maintaining my sanity) I think I'll leave it alone for now.</p>

<p>I guess I can understand your logic, Gaspard. There's a distinct appeal to ambush by overwhelming force scenarios.</p>

<p>As for the MA5D, I would think the easiest way to aim with it would be to simply acquire a UNSC helmet link as, if I recall correctly, the sights on most of their rifles are electronic. Failing that, I imagine you would indeed be forced to modify the rifle yourself. Whether that means installing an electronic sight on the rifle screen itself or removing the computer cowl entirely, I have no idea.
Do let me know how it goes, though. I am ever an admirer of the science of dakka.</p>

            <p>Honourable discharge from the armed forces, received multiple awards and commendations for 3500 years of exemplary service, turned in my rifle, armour, and laser screwdriver to the Quartermaster, got to meet a survivor or two from the War, found my sister, got disowned by my sister, laid a wreath at the War Memorial for the 442nd, and received a bit of land as per the Veterans' Act.

            <p>As of half a minute ago, a large fight was sparked in the HQ cafeteria.  </p>

<p>Roughly a minute or two before that, a woman wearing coveralls slammed into the room, a young assassin freaked out about government conspiracies (even in the PPC you can't escape those, it seems) and attacked the newcomer, and the assassin was knocked down with ease with a broom of all things. </p>

<p>Afterwards, the newcomer issued a challenge to the whole cafeteria and for a word, hell broke loose rather quickly, because that's just how things roll on some days that end with 'y'. Especially because someone— who?— yelled out "Everyone attack!". </p>

<p>Unfortunately the woman disappeared rather quickly into the now roiling crowd, so that's a bit of a failure mode.</p>

<p>You're already here, so. </p>

<p>Anyone up for fighting?</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Sometimes, it's just fun to RP a brawl, which is exactly what is going on here!</p>

<p>A few rules to lay down for this one:</p>

<ul>
<li>You've got to have permission this time.</li>
<li>No godmoding— this means controlling other people's characters without their permission or agreement as to what happens next. Don't assume what a character's reaction will be to something your characters do.</li>
<li>No, you can't actually track the woman who sparked the whole incident off. There are reasons. Promise.</li>
<li>This is a good, lighthearted fun brawl. Please don't kill anyone off.</li>
<li>If your characters wouldn't actually be fighting at all, well, they could always be there spectating or trying to place bets.</li>

            <p>Agent Michael was a bit more hesitant.</p>

<p>"Are you sure about this, Mia?" he asked, peeking out from behind the tables they'd set up as a tiny stronghold. "We could just leave. The door's right there."</p>

<p>Mia hurled an apple--they had captured a bag of them from the food line--at an exceptionally pale girl across the room, grinning as her mark fell. Then she turned to her partner with a flat look behind her sunglasses. "Just like you, Greenie," she said, hefting another apple. "This is a war zone. There's no leaving until the war's done."</p>

<p>Michael peeked out again in glum silence. They were, in fact, blocking the door with four tables set out in a rough square. He could have left easily. But it was best not to anger Mia--especially when she had ammunition so close at hand. With a sigh, he reached into his pocket and took out a Muggle-use wand. Maybe he could Stupefy everyone and end the fight that way. <i>I just want some lunch,</i> he thought, stomach growling. A mass of sticky mac and cheese, molded like a snowball, took him in the shoulder. <i>That is not what I meant,</i> he silently told the Ironic Overpower.</p>

            <p>A pair of agents appeared before the table fort, seemingly out of thin air. The incredibly pale redheaded man had his hands in the pockets of his long coat, and was eyeing both Mia and Michael as if to decide which one should he go for first. The short, black-haired woman next to him was gently juggling one apple.</p>

<p>"Somebody wants to play with magic?" William Grey looked at Michael's wand. "As you wish then!"</p>

<p>The warlock spread out his arms, making the table fort slide away from the hidden team, and parting to the sides like the Red Sea.</p>

<p>VJ bit a piece of the apple off. "This is gonna be fun!"</p>

            <p><i>A real magic user,</i> Michael thought. <i>Great</i>. "Look, we don't have to figh--" he was cut off by his partner flinging an apple at the pale man's head. </p>

<p>"GET 'EM, GREENIE!" Mia roared, charging after her projectile. </p>

<p>Michael sighed, then raised his wand. <i>I was having such a nice day before all of this,</i> he thought. "Stupefy!" he said, aiming at the dark-haired woman. <i>Maybe I can find an untouched boxed lunch hanging around somewhere...</i></p>

            <p>Michael aimed the Knockback Jinx at the pale man, feeling horribly out of his league. Mia, on the other hand, looked frighteningly comfortable. She used her right forearm to sweep the dark-haired woman's downward strike aside and aimed a left-hand jab at her solar plexus. "Nice hockey stick!" she said, smirking.</p>

            <p>"A'right, that was good," he said, when he got up from his knees. "I almost felt that. Come on, mate! Gimme somethin', any sort o' challenge."</p>

<p>The warlock flicked his hand very gently, making an small melon from the nearest table levitate and splash right next to Michael's head. It was more for the dramatic effect, rather than actual projectile.</p>

<p>"Come on, you need me to teach you how to use that thing?" he asked.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>VJ smashed her stick against the floor, and felt her hands tremble from the aftershock. In her peripheral, however, she managed to notice the incoming attack. She jumped back, letting go of her weapon in process.</p>

<p>Without even looking, Mia kicked the woman's fallen hockey stick into her own hands, then swung it upwards at her right side. The entire action took, at most, a second. "<i>I heard that, Greenie!</i>" she roared, not taking her eyes off her opponent. </p>

<p>Michael started, then raised his wand. "<i>Serpensortia!</i>" he said. A long black snake burst out of the wand, falling to the laminate with a sickening thud. The creature hissed, then started slithering towards the pale man. Its tongue flicked in and out, and its eyes glittered. Michael couldn't resist a shudder--he hated snakes.</p>

            <p>That is to say, putting food in his mouth and chewing mechanically while thinking about something else, partially because of the food involved and partially because he was actually distracted. 
His reverie was rudely disturbed by something splatting against his shoulder. He looked aside and saw a large, red stain on the shoulder of his uniform jacket. With a sigh he got up, only to duck down again as something that looked suspiciously like a bunch of Spikes flew over his head.</p>

<p>The mage looked at the enfolding chaos, winced as he saw someone get crushed under a not-quite-thin clown (of all things) and tried to plot a way to the exit that did <i>not</i> involve him going through multiple fights. Something rolled to a stop next to his feet and he had a second’s glance at it before exploded in a burst of white light, blinding and deafening him as flashbangs were wont to do.</p>

            <p>Said dragonborn was clad in a pair of black swimming trunks, adorned with the Floaters flashpatch on the left leg. He was going for a bite, his mouth coated in electrity.

            <p>He would have done something, surely. As things stood, however, the task fell to Aparaat's Auto Guard function. The Device's gem flashed in time to some vaguely Dutch-sounding word and a hexagonal wall of hard light appeared between the still-dizzy mage and the dragonborn.</p>

<p>There was another flash of light — this time, centred on Navare — and suddenly he was wearing a spikier, more decorated version of his uniform. He looked decidedly less dizzy, although the long, black rifle that he held now was pointed at the floor.</p>

The voice the device produced and the field led him to believe it was Nanoha!verse, but it's voice was neither English or German.

            <p>By the time the shield-type spell went down Navare was already moving away; Nickul's tail passed twenty centimetres before his chest, completely missing him. The hexagonal sigil appeared beneath the mage's feet this time; a second later a veritable hail of small spheres of light left the rifle's barrel, all aimed at the dragonborn. A few went high, only to double down and back, cutting his escape route, or at the very least requiring some creative dodging. </p>

He seemed keen on avoiding Nickul altogether, but when that failed, he stopped and turned to face the dragonborn, about twenty metres away from him. Navare said something, but is exact words were lost to the noises of the battle. A hexagonal sigil flowered beneath his feet again and a second one appeared before the barrel of his rifle; motes of light started gathering around it. Whatever it was, it was obviously more powerful than the Variable Bullets he shot at Nickul earlier.</p>

            <p>Agent Hop ducked beneath a long table, which helped her avoid a sudden launch of Generic Gray Gruel. "Not funny!"</p>

<p>Suddenly every single piece of food in the cafeteria became a weapon. Bugels were flying, steaks were torn... Hell hath no fury like an agent scorned.</p>

<p>"I got hit," said Hip, wiping sauce off her cheek. Peeking from beneath the table, both women noticed the battlefield was getting more intense every second. Instead of just food, some agents with superpowers decided to either settle some old disputes, or simplu show-off their superiority.</p>

<p>"So what's the plan, captain?" Hip looked at Hop.</p>

<p>"Our mission is to get to the takeaway containers, o'er there," the former Time Agent pointed at the pile of styrofoam boxes, "catch wha'ever food is flyin', an' then dash to our RC to have a proper lunch. Yeh with me, love?"</p>

<p>"Always."</p>

<p>The agents relocated from beneath the table, to the side of it. They were completely vulnerable, but that won't matter if they're gonna be on the move.</p>

<p>Hop took a deep breath. "If I don' make it alive," she looked at Hip, "tell me girlfriend I love 'er."</p>

<p>Hip chuckled. "I'll be sure to let her know." She gave Hop a quick peck on the cheek. "Now go. I'll cover you."</p>

<p>Hearing the signal, Hop slid across the table and dashed towards the to-go boxes. </p>

<p>"What are you doing!" Ajax yelled.</p>

<p>"It's Saturday," Matthew yelled back, throwing away the crossbow and extracting his collapsed bo staff, flicking it into full length. "It's always alright for fighting!"</p>

            <p>While dashing, Hop heard her partner casting spells covering her. Suddenly, in her peripheral she noticed somebody coming after her. She stopped in her tracks, did a forward roll, dodging a swing, and faced her opponent.</p>

<p>"Enjoyin' the party, love?" She smiled at the man, reaching for the sonic blaster strapped to her leg. "Well, 'm afraid I 'ave to make this quick. Try to keep up!"</p>

<p>After preventing a deadly tomato attack, Hip looked towards where it came from. She then saw a man rushing towards her. It didn't look like he wanted to have just a friendly foodfight. </p>

<p>Hip clicked her tongue, and took off the <a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/huntik/images/b/bb/Freelancer_Amulet.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141012054414">Amulet</a> of her neck.</p>

<p>"<i>Defend me, Freelancer!</i>"</p>

<p>The Amulet began to glow, and soon afterwards a 7'6" tall <a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/huntik/images/9/9f/Freelancer.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141012054013">Titan</a> was protecting Hip with his enormous shield.</p>

<p>"Sure, though the service is a bit rough." he paused. "Love."</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Ajax faced the Knight confidently, his wings making up their two feet of height difference. He connected as many orbs as he could, channeling the energy charge into his scythe, and with that scythe, he intended to cut through his foe's defense. He unleashed his blade.</p>

            <p>The impact of the hit was strong enough to make her wince in pain and wave her hand around, therefore she barely managed to avoid the jabs that came afterwards. She quickly dropped to the ground, grabbed Matthew's leg and pulled it. Then, she rolled back.</p>

<p>"Don' try to stop me!" She warned him, looking for her lost weapon.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Freelancer's shield absorbed Ajax's strike, however the Titan had been pushed several inches back. Meanwhile, Hip was looking around, hoping to find any sort of makeshift weapon. She couldn't survive just on magic alone, and if Freelancer gets sent back to his Amulet...</p>

<p>The answer came quickly, when she spotted a broken table leg; somebody must've been going hardcore. </p>

<p>She grabbed the leg and whispered, "<i>Formstaff</i>." The table leg got covered in purple light, and elongated itself into a staff with a crook on one end and a spike on the other.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Freelancer pushed forward, trying to make Ajax retreat.</p>

<p>Never the less, he pulled the trigger.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>The knight was backing Ajax up, jabbing at him with it's lance. Ajax was intending to vault over it, attacking it's master. His chance came when the knight went for his feet. Ajax hopped onto the lance, running up the thing and toadstooling the knight's head.</p>

<p>He channeled dark energy into his fist, intending to punch the knight's master.</p>

Alleb felt a grin work its way onto her face at the sounds of the brawl--she hadn't had a decent, hand-to-hand fight in weeks.</p>

<p>Jesse stood, toppling back his chair, and took hold of the table with her. Together they heaved, turning the rectangle onto its side, dumping their lunches on the ground. Jesse adjusted the legs so they kept the thing up. Alleb peered over the top, ducking back down when a pile of greenish mashed potatoes--she hoped they were mashed potatoes--flew at her, striking the front of their barricade. "We are well positioned in this corner!" the swordmaiden said. "Now we have only to find worthy opponents!"</p>

<p>She looked over and, to her surprise, Jesse was also grinning. "I ain't seen a proper brawl since I left Kansas City," he said. He looked at her, brown eyes alight. "You ever been in one?"</p>

<p>"Are you or are you not talking to one of the wrestling champions of Alleble?" Alleb said, stretching the muscles in her arms. "I say we dash out, fight for a few moments, then return here before we are bloodied." She paused for a moment. "We fight to end the fight and bring peace, of course," she said, as an afterthought.</p>

<p>"Right," Jesse said, winking. "Sounds good." He held out his hand. "Together?" </p>

<p>Alleb clasped it firmly. "Together!"</p>

<p>They released each other, and with their own war cries--"Yeeehaw!"--"For Alleble!"--they vaulted over their table barricade and charged into the fray.</p>

At 6 feet tall and only under 300 pounds if you were a really good-natured liar, the barrelling was rather literal. Her gaze was laser-focused on the knight, since of the two she was probably the easier target for her particular brand of shock and awe.</p>

            <p>Instinct told her to grab Wobbles' outstretched arm and haul the woman onto her own back, then use her leg muscles to toss her to the floor--but she guessed that that would not be the best strategy. The woman was <i>massive</i>. Alleb was forcefully reminded of Sir Mallik, wielding his great hammer with a head bigger than her rib cage. If there had been time, she would have gulped. But there was no time. She aimed a chop at the woman's wrist, trying to make her let go of her weapon.</p>

<p>Jesse, meanwhile, jumped on Wobbles's back like a rabid monkey.</p>

            <p>She grunted with the effort of staying upright, staggering a few steps to the left from Jesse's impact, and then regained her footing, deftly avoiding the remnants of a pie skidding across the floor. "Hey, mister cowboy, if you get behind a horse, you get <i>HURT</i>!"</p>

<p>It was at this point that she flipped herself over in the air to land on her back... which, by sheer coincidence, would involve landing on Jesse unless he extricated himself in time.</p>

<p>Alleb gasped as she saw her partner crushed into the floor by Wobble's impact. The cowboy screamed, but the cry was cut off by the pressure on his lungs. "Alleb!" he rasped. "Help!"</p>

<p>Alleb rushed forward to do something--what that was, she wasn't sure--but before she had taken two steps an apple drilled into the side of her head, going only slightly slower than a professional fastball. The swordmaiden toppled over with a groan, lights flashing behind her eyes.</p>

            <p>Flipping acrofatically to her feet and taking the opportunity to shake the stars out of her vision, she shouted her battle cry and resumed her interrupted bull rush at the Knight of Alleble. Of course, the run was checked slightly, and she'd taken care not to put too much of her considerable weight onto her other assailant's bone structure, but they were still gonna be hit by quite a lot of momentum.</p>

<p>((And yes, Alleb, this is Wobbles going into a grapple match with an experienced wrestler; Wobbles' usual fighting style involves bouncing around at range and hitting people only when the opportunity presents itself, but, y'know, disadvantage is fairer an' all that.))</p>

            <p>She rolled out of the way of Wobbles' rush, stumbling to her feet. <i>When I find who threw that apple,</i> she thought, shaking her head to clear it. <i>they shall wish that they were never born.</i> She resumed her combat stance, backing up slightly to cover her fallen partner, who she could hear stirring. It felt like the time she had challenged Kindle--the keeper of the armory, a stout Glimpse and strong--to a match. The only difference was that he had weighed <i>less</i> than Wobbles.</p>

<p>Jesse, meanwhile, had managed to bring the ceiling of the cafeteria into focus. He had also determined that while nothing was broken, he was going to have a mess of bruises across his chest. Getting up was going to take a few moments and, judging by the way the fight was going, he didn't have a few moments.</p>

<p>A cream pie hit him in the face. He sighed. <i>Next time, we're staying behind the table.</i></p>

            <p>As Wobbles turned back around to face the knight, she saw the woman stood over her comrade and inwardly remarked that that'd be something she'd do if she was partnered with pretty much anyone else in the history of sentient life. She grabbed a miraculously unbroken stack of plates nearby and leaped into the air, hurling them like discuses at Alleb's wavering guard before grabbing a nearby table by the leg and swinging it like a tomahawk at the knight's midriff.</p>

<p>It was at this point that the first of a barrage of water jugs hit home, shattering on the back of her head, her enormous rainbow-striped wig doing only so much to cushion the impact.</p>

            <p>She used her forearms as imperfect bucklers, deflecting or breaking them. For a moment, she was grinning: The sixth plate, however, caught her in the shoulder. She grunted, thrown off balance, and the next barrage slammed into her, each plate finding its mark. The final one shattered against her forehead--knights of Alleble have hard skulls--and she groaned, dizzy. She didn't see the table coming.</p>

<p>Jesse, however, did. He had managed to raise himself on one elbow, and when he saw Wobbles grabbing the table, he yanked on Alleb's leg, sending her crashing to the ground. The table whistled harmlessly overhead. Jesse felt accomplished for a moment.</p>

<p>And then there were water jugs flying through the air.</p>

So, when she turned back to face the two prone agents, her face was twisted in pain. Blood and orange juice was trickling down her face, mixing with her makeup and dripping thickly from her bright red nose. She looked like she was melting.</p>

<p>This, of course, was why she then threw herself skywards for a belly flop.</p>

She vaulted over Jesse's head and lashed a meaty arm at his shoulder while upside down, then managed to stick the landing as she bounced forward again, this time towards the more heavily-injured Alleb. She mimed blowing a cavalry bugle, complete with sound effects (which are difficult but not impossible to mime), and threw herself to the left as she got into striking distance of the sword, pushing her weight low to the ground like a motorcyclist on a high-speed bend as she aimed for the woman's knees with a sweep of both legs and metal pole.</p>

<p>Jesse, meanwhile, after taking a pogo stick to the back (in addition to a clown to the ribs, an arm to the shoulder, and a pie to the face) had decided that either he had lost whatever fighting talent he had possessed back in Kansas City, or that he had never had any talent in the first place. In either case, he was talent-less. He managed to heave himself up from his pillow of green mashed potatoes, then stumbled to his feet, groaning and feeling at the place on his back where the pogo stick had impacted.

He bounced back manfully, though, and in a credit to his almost-certainly-not-real German heritage, he scraped it off on a water glass (which took him longer than he cared to admit), flicked through his movepool, selected Waterfall, Aqua Jet, Spikes, and Supersonic, and entered the fray with a screaming battle cry.</p>

<p>Which was almost immediately silenced by yet another ballistic sandwich, but it was a cheese ploughman's with mango chutney so he didn't really mind.</p>

<p>She noticed Ajax first, but he was about to enact scythe themed justice to a knight with an absurdly large lance. His new partner, Michael was? Was fighting another, of whom she inferred was the women behind the knight's partner (The Knight seemed to absurd and stoic to be an actual agent, so it might have been from another Mons series), so she decided to let him be. Her new partner, Nickul, disappeared to who knows where. Eventually her eyes landed upon a pink puffer fish looking thing. </p>

<p>She summoned her chains, initially using them similarly to a 3DMG. Oh how she missed her wings. Sailing over head of her target, she sent the chains towards it, wrapping it in the chains. She then used her momentum to barrel roll, causing the fish to sail over her, and slammed it back into the ground, should it not react.</p>

            <p>The moral of the story is, of course, that we could have avoided all this drama if y&#39;all had just remembered to use proper capitalization.

            <p>So I figured I&#39;d put up my team on here just to show people what it was. So, let&#39;s get to the Pokemon<br><br>Myanmar AKA Hippowdown<br>Ability: Sand Stream<br>Moves: Earthquake, Slack Off, Stealth Rock, Toxic<br>Item: Leftovers<br><br>So Myanmar was in some ways the center of the team, it&#39;s ability to whip up sandstorms meant that important chip damage would be applied to all non-ground, rock or steel types that tried to take it on. Stealth Rock and Toxic helped build up that chip damage, Slack Off kept it healthy and Earthquake made sure it a) wasn&#39;t taunt bait and b) made sure it could threaten any non flying pokemon with its STAB move. Leftovers helped the recovery.<br><br>The Blazing Aura AKA Mamoswine<br>Ability: Thick Fat<br>Moves: Earthquake, Knock Off, Ice Shard, Avalanche<br>Items: Assault Vest<br><br>Aah my faithful Mamoswine. One of the few sets completely designed by me, anyway. Thick Fat helped it tank Ice and Fire moves, supported by Assault Vest that raised it&#39;s Special Defense meant that any Flamerthrowers or the like headed its way weren&#39;t going to take it out. It&#39;s moves were meant to be able to take out the threats it&#39;d often be face with, Knock Off helped remoe items and was a quite powerful move the first time around. The normal STAB Earthquake would take down most Fire types sent it&#39;s way, and could deal with more besides. Ice Shard allowed it to hit first with priority when needed and could still pack a punch. Avalanche revolved around Mamoswine&#39;s position as a tank, take a hit and become more powerful because of it, even without the hit it still does decent damage off of Mamoswine attack. <br><br>Phoenigetuzstha AKA Gliscor<br>Ability: Poison Heal<br>Moves: Earthquake, Facade, Substitute, Swords Dance<br>Item: Toxic Orb<br><br>The set-up attacker with it&#39;s own form of recovery. Poison Heal worked well alongside Toxic Orb to allow Gliscor to heal 12% ech turn after it was poisoned, it also prevent burn from affecting it too badly AND went hand in hand with Facade doubling it&#39;s power. Substitute allowed Gliscor to tank a move and prepare it&#39;s Swords Dance to reach a nice level of attack, and Earthquake was a nice STAB move. It does however have a slight problem with Ghosts that fly or levitate...<br><br>Dijifuji AKA Garchomp<br>Ability: Sand Veil (After Mega evolution, Sand Force)<br>Moves: Earthquake, Fire Blast, Aqua Tail, Dragon Claw<br>Item: Garchompite<br><br>A mega because I thought I would need one, and boy did it work. Nicely set up to be a physically defensive tank (until a Torterra turned it into mince meat), Garchomp worked a lot better in a sandstorm than out. Sand Veil meant that I could dodge a moe or two, and the 20 extra speed the normal form had was useful on occasion, whilst Sand Force boosted Earthquake&#39;s power during a Sandstorm to almost monsterous levels. Earthquake and Dragon Claw were the two STABs that meant it hit every type at least neutrally, Fire Blast was mainly because with Gastrodon my team could take on Skarmory&#39;s, and the special fire move circumvented that. It also did wonders in surprising other pokemon. Aqua Tail was (once again until Gastrodon came along) my teams answer to other Ground types, but worked well in other situations that needed it as well. Mega Garchomp is more tanky than normal Garchomp, so it was I suppose a logical choice to take a Garchompite.<br><br>Lost Heros AKA Gastrodon<br>Ability: Storm Drain<br>Moves: Scald, Clear Smog, Recover, Hidden Power (Grass)<br>Item: Leftovers<br><br>The anti Water-Ground Pokemon of my team and last mintue addition when I realised I could have a substitute. Came in a lot more use than I thought it would and now has a permenant place on my Mono-Ground team. Storm Drain stopped water Pokemon dead, and gave a nice boost to special attack, Scald works as a primary STAB due to it&#39;s 30% chance to burn, Clear Smog is a nice (if weak) poison type move that allowed me to stop some set up sweepers along the way, Recover and leftovers gave some life back ot Gastrodon and Hidden Power was my answer to water Pokemon. <br><br>SSTxReaper AKA Excadrill<br>Ability: Sand Rush<br>Moves: Iron Head, Earthquake, Rapid Spin, Rock Slide<br>Item: Metronome<br><br>Slight variation on the set I&#39;m fairly certain SeaTurtle used for Trident, Metronome allowed Reaper to switch moves if need be, although repeated use of a move made it more powerful, and made it seem to have a Choice Band  that could screw with some people&#39;s predictions. Sand Rush allowed it to double speed in Sandstorm, which combined with repeated Metronome usage could make it an absolute killer. Rapid Spin let me take out entry hazards, Iron Head alongside the nice 30% flinch chance was a nice STAB move that worked well with Earthquake, whilst Rock Slide completed the coverage and could flinch by itself. <br><br>TaQud AKA Krookodile<br>Ability: Moxie<br>Moves: Knock Off, Earthquake, Super Power, Stone Edge<br>Item: Choice Scarf<br><br>Good revenge killer and late game sweeper on a team that didn&#39;t really need it. Has really given it&#39;s place up for Gastrodon most of the time but came out for the final on the educated guess SeaTurtle would keep their Hippowdon on the team and so I could still use sand to my advantage if I needed to. Choice Scarf gave it the speed it need to threaten everything bar other, faster Scarf users, Priority users and Sand Rush users, whilst Moxie gave it the ability to get stronger as it took out pokemon. Knock Off was a STAB move that could take items off, wouldn&#39;t have worked so well if the Pokemon survived one Knock Off as it would then half in power, but it&#39;s nice to take out Psychic and Ghost team, Earthquake is a powerful STAB move, &#39;nough said. Stone Edge allowed perfect cover, it&#39;s power was needed over Rock Slide&#39;s at the cost of accuracy. Super Power gave some more coverage and worked well as the attack decrease could be negated by Moxie and the defense decrease wouldn&#39;t matter due to it&#39;s speed.<br><br>As to names. All seven of the names come from RPers who took part in a series of RP&#39;s called the Ultima Tournament about four or fie years ago, it was a Pokemon RP and, indeed my first RP ever and probably the reason I&#39;m here now. Myanmar was the creator of the RP&#39;s and so his name matched perfectly to Hippowdon as the center of the team and the reason why all the Pokemon were together. <br>Reaper, Phoen, TaQud and TBA were the finalists in the first Ultima Tournament, Reaper used very offensive pokemon and so I thought well suited to the role of Excadrill, Phoen was known for her Volcarona which would set up and then wreak havoc, a perfect RPer for my Gliscor to be named after, TaQud fitted Krookodile&#39;s personality and usage very well. TBA, or rather, me was a bit of an all rounder and a tank, added to that Mamoswine is my favourite pokemon so I had to put my old username and my RPing name onto my team. <br>Dijifuji was the RPer who was used during the first Ultima Tournament to get the plot moving and ended up quite central to it spending quite a lot of time with legendary dragon pokemon (or as they called them, dragon broksie&#39;s) and so they were perfect for my own dragon broski, Garchomp. <br>Finally Lost Heros was a RPer who joined in with the second Ultima Torunament, was a finalist in that and was also fairly important to the plot, as the newcomer and the person who fitted the gaps in the current line up of RPers, they were perfect for the Pokemon that did the same for my team, Gastrodon. <br><br>So that&#39;s it. That&#39;s why I said &quot;for Ultima&quot; in the finals and that&#39;s what my team was and why they were called that.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been drifting away from FPS games for a while now. The modern/future stuff has never really appealed to me, and I stopped played <i>Team Fortress 2</i> about a year and a half ago due to growing disillusionment with the matches and the community. The only FPS games I still play on and off now are from the <i>Borderlands</i> series.<br><br>That being said, I recently felt the itch to try them out again. See if new developments made them more palatable. So I tried out both the <i>Overwatch</i> beta and <i>Battleborn</i> (I decided to pick up the latter after enjoying the <i>Battleborn</i> beta earlier this year). I have to admit: I&#39;m won over, for the moment. Both games are pretty good.<br><br>I especially want to give a nod of appreciation to <i>Battleborn</i>, which seems to have received short shrift from much of the gaming community. It is definitely not a perfect game, but I&#39;m having a very good time with it. I honestly wasn&#39;t sure if I would enjoy the MOBA aspect of it (not a big fan of the genre), but those features are not overpowering. Versus matches aren&#39;t the drawn-out slogs I was worried about. The cooperative story missions are a definite plus. I&#39;ve always preferred co-op multiplayer to competitive, and this provides that.<br><br>While <i>Overwatch</i> doesn&#39;t do anything with co-op, it&#39;s still a pretty fine experience. I&#39;ve gotten pretty good with both Mercy and Zarya. I look forward to the game actually coming out.<br><br>SHAMELESS PLUG INCOMING<br><br>If anyone wanted to check out a bit of <i>Battleborn</i> for themselves, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugmPsZiJZQg">recorded myself</a> playing one of the story missions. (The video contains sci-fi violence and some swearing.)<br><br>PS: I hate to admit it, but I really liked that <i>Battlefield</i> trailer. I&#39;ve missed historical shooters.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t play much these days because I&#39;ve been getting lag spikes since the Gunmetal update, but when I did I played Spy, Sniper, or whatever the team happened to need, in that order. My favorite map is probably either Hightower or Degroot.</p>

            <p>I think I&#39;m getting reasonably competent with Pyro or Soldier. I dunno; I got Terraria at the end of 2015 and it really sucked me in. I remember liking the Lakeside map the best. It&#39;s so dramatically different from all the other default ones, even Nucleus...:)</p>

            <p>...in the sense that the British Mark V tanks are actually working. I&#39;d pay good money if DICE made it a feature that, while driving the tank, the player would be deafened by the engine, lose health due to said engine not having an exhaust pipe and thus slowly gassing its crew to death, and that the tank be prone to mechanical failures :P<br><br>On the up side, the commonality of bolt-action weapons in that era means that mêlée weapons can be balanced and play a significant role in the game as opposed to being used as last resort or humiliation weapons. It would quite accurately reflect history, where a knife or a club could be wielded much more easily than a rifle. <br><br>But at the same time... EA. Stupid, blasted EA Games.<br><br>Please, DICE.

            <p>They should also add a feature where, as your character stays in the game, they very slowly go insane, and eventually leave the war a broken shell of what they used to be. <br><br>Bonus points for whoever has the least PTSD at the end of the round! <br><br>But, really, I do wonder if one <i>could</i> do balanced and realistic tank gameplay. <br>From what I understand, it came down to complete luck that your tank would even start. <br>Doesn&#39;t sound too fun to me. <br>I suppose there&#39;s a &#39;Guns of Icarus&#39; sort of thing crouching in the corner somewhere around that, but Guns of Icarus uses a whole lot of suspension of disbelief (hitting things with wrenches makes their damage worse, in my experience.)</p>

            <p>Now, for the explanations.<br><br>I began with the ugly pseudo-cube on the top of the pyramid, before beginning to mine it my usual way: going downwards, carving a room 4 blocks huge, strip-mining them and covering them with torchs to explore with minimal creep intrusion. <br><br>However, I usually don&#39;t do this on a hill, so I ended up piercing it again and again. That was when I decided to build proper walls for each room, making sure I knew its limits, and eventually creating something which could be spotted by people coming back from exploration.<br><br> Since that was quite ugly, I settled for the pyramid you saw, with a face cut short for not encroaching on Spawn Central&#39;s underground, and a zone more advanced for covering a cliff of the hill.<br><br>Now, if people want to work on it too, by amenaging the rooms or helping for decoration, I&#39;d be glad to let them do this. The structure can also be a relatively secure start point for mining the galleries. <br><br>The lowest room for the moment also has got a small garden I began, although the room is to amenage (the all-cobble floor is a mean for me to know if I&#39;m still under the structure when I&#39;m mining deeper, although accomodations will have to be made for the garden. Eh, a cobble &#39;road&#39; could be made for the galleries too.)<br><br>Of course, if you find it ugly/useless, say it. I can always bury it with the dirt I dug. Or making bigger degrees to make more space for each room. Anything you deem fit.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m actually pretty displeased.<br><br>I spent a couple hours last night detreeing and then flattening out that area so logging on this morning to find that there was an immense gaping hole with a cobblepyramid in its place with floating land to the side in its place wasn&#39;t exactly the nicest surprise.<br><br>SeaTurtle had already started a mining operation closeby, but not too far away.<br><br>The fact that the whole area was cleared and flattened by someone not you should have given you pause to consider and check first, instead of running roughshod like that, especially considering that there&#39;s a whole lot of map where you <i>could</i> have done it elsewhere. <br><br>Basically it comes down to: Why did you decide to <i>stripmine<i> on spawn, right next to the fort, and take over an awful lot of space that someone else had done work on prior?</i></i></p>

            <p>When I originally got a Minecraft a friend bought the account and I paid him for it. However in doing this my account had his email on it, we both thought he&#39;d transferred the account to me years ago, but it appears he hasn&#39;t as none of my emails work with the account so he&#39;s going to try and transfer the account to me once he finishes work and see where things go from there.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s never explicitly said in canon what material it is they&#39;re made of but they&#39;re frequently described as being like marble (you know... indestructible, sparkling marble...) and when we see one of the sparklepires get her head ripped off and later dismembered, there was no blood, just the sound of rocks being broken.

            <p>That&#39;s probably one of the most unpleasant badfics I&#39;ve ever been exposed to. Bizarre, but not bizarre enough to have the distancing effect that makes crack funny. Your agents&#39;observations were spot on. I&#39;m also really enjoying seeing them develop. Ix is kind of reminding me of a Lighter and Softer version of Gabrielle, but maybe that&#39;s because I was just rereading her spinoff. I don&#39;t mean to imply you&#39;re repeating yourself; Ix is clearly her own character.<br><br>I&#39;m going to have the song exorcism stuck in my head all day now. Thanks.<br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>This one was definitely bizarre, but I wouldn&#39;t say it was unpleasant. At least, there was nothing squicky (for me) in it, just a boatload of annoyances.<br><br>Ix being like Gabrielle, I&#39;m not too sure about. Gabrielle is a Stepford Smiler—she hides her pain behind a façade of bubbly happiness. With Ix, what you see is what you get; even though she had traumatic stuff happen to her, she had support in her family and at Hogwarts so she never had the time to develop the angst that was scheduled for her later in the fic she came from. <br><br><i>I know a song that gets on everybody&#39;s nerves, everybody&#39;s nerves, everybody&#39;s nerves!

            <p>Hoom, hoom.<br><br><b>Fic to spork:</b> I have no idea what SeaQuest is and none of the people I asked knew it, so I can&#39;t really say whether the fic breaks canon, but it definitely has Sue warning signs. The SPaG isn&#39;t fantastic, either.<br><br><b>Writing ability (technical):</b> Definitely better. However, your SPaG still has some pretty glaring errors (like comma/full stop substitutions and missing quotation marks). I think you could really use more betas. My own rule of thumb — y&#39;know, for stuff I publish — is never less than two betas, three if I&#39;m not certain and more if I&#39;m doing something big or drastic. Further, leaving stuff like &quot;RC {number}&quot; in when you can just say &quot;the RC&quot; makes your piece looks unfinished.<br><br>As a note, the present tense on the Injerd prompt is annoying and not done often, but not too bad an attribute.<br><br><b>PPC knowledge:</b> Mostly solid, except for the recruiter at the job fair (I don&#39;t think the PPC does that?) and the implied eating of Pokémon in the Cafeteria (ew, no). Also, Medical (the department) is capitalised.<br><br><b>Activity:</b> So far, the most I&#39;ve seen out of you is a) activity related to your Permission and b) one-liners appended to stuff other people say. I feel that you&#39;re not really involved with the community right now. Not posting a lot is completely fine — RL eats your time, you&#39;re away from Internet, whatever — but right now the little you post has no interaction in it, which is pretty bad.<br><br><b>Writing ability (creative):</b> <br>-The Kelly and Injerd prompt is pretty good, as Key noted. One thing that is really problematic, though, is that it&#39;s basically cut off; the ending is way too abrupt and not a natural &quot;ending point&quot; (like, say, leaving for the mission).<br>-The Kelly and September prompt, well. It feels kinda robotic, there — not too much feeling. Further, September&#39;s problem is really confusing — did she eat something bad or is she having her period? Further, the thing about fandoms — I had to google &quot;Topher Brink&quot; to figure the mission is <i>Dollhouse</i>; you should really try to make your writing accessible to people unfamiliar with the fandom concerned (it is my humble opinion that doing so is one of the signs of a truly good PPC writer).<br>-The food fight prompt has two problems: the cook&#39;s mood swing, which is pretty jarring, and the lack of any food fight in a prompt about a food fight. It also looks cut-off.<br>-The last prompt has one really big problem: it&#39;s a prompt about DAC despite it being supposed to be about a robot wearing a paper mask. September and Kelly&#39;s interactions are OK, though.<br>-The &quot;personality&quot; section in Kelly&#39;s profile doesn&#39;t fit what we actually see of her. September and Injerd&#39;s are much better.<br><br><b>Conclusion:</b> almost and with marked improvement, but not quite yet. The clincher of my decision is the activity bit; the PPC is a community first and a shared universe second. Unless another PG objects, <b>Permission denied</b>.<br><small>(Don&#39;t give up. You&#39;re nearly there.)</small></p>

            <p>Sorry for taking that so literally! That&#39;s a really creative way to fulfill the prompt: a <i>fight</i> over <i>food</i>. I&#39;m laughing at myself so hard now for not getting it. I love it.</p>

            <p>1) Yes, I&#39;ve read the whole prompt. No, the robot wasn&#39;t consequential. It could&#39;ve been a yellow tank with bunny ears for all the relevance it had to the plot (none).<br>2) I guess you can just say he was being sarcastic?

What I said was all about working around the limitations, like <ul>
<br><li>If the Stu claims that your agents can’t do anything to him, because he’s immortal, find him a fate worse than death.<br>
</li>
<li>If the prompt claims that it’s about a robot wearing a paper face mask of a canon character, use this as a <b>starting point</b> (&quot;the first two sentences&quot;) to make your agents bicker about their different perception of this canon character, or recent developments in this canon, or the advantages and disadvantages of wearing a paper mask, or to make anything happen that may, by the weird laws of PPC HQ, be caused by meeting this robot. As long as it is a good story, nobody will complain that it’s not actually about the robot.</li>
</ul>   <br>Telling a random story, where the agents meet the robot only near the end and barely react to it, apart from Kelly contemplating a memory for one paragraph, doesn’t work around the limitations.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>But anyway, imagine submitting a paper on the history of Jewish poetry in the eleventh century that only gives that subject a line and uses the rest to talk about the Reconquista — why do you even bother saying it&#39;s about poetry when it isn&#39;t?<br><br>And, yes.

            <p>I promised myself I&#39;d stay out of this, but I just can&#39;t.<br><br>So. Look. Here are your options for a prompt.<br><br>1. A hole suddenly opens in the floor of your agents&#39; RC, directly under their feet, and they fall 20 feet onto a pile of mattresses. The sides are vertical and there are no ladders.<br><br>2. When your agents step through the portal to start their mission, they find themselves in a badfic set in a canon they do not recognise. Their RA displays the message &#39;Portal malfunction; please wait half an hour and try again&#39;. Someone is charging at them with a canon-appropriate weapon.<br><br>3. While walking through HQ, your agents are physically caught in a trap of your choosing. It was laid by insane former agent Mylissa, who plans to hold them to ransom and demand their Department Head supply her with caffeine and chocolate. (Mylissa is mentioned <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1SQQGdpJf9rFvQGtRGcDQReuke9b5ZYXgTZEYITH2cFU">here</a> and appears <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pHfubKjf6k9l9MZAfFpacN9pjtnxkhI96C1AqUNBIL4/pub">here</a>. She is not free-to-use, but I&#39;m letting you write her however you like for the purposes of this.)<br><br>Choose one. Make it the start of your story. Write 400-800 words from that point.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>More like five cents. This got long.<br><br><u>Agents receive a mission:</u><br>-You have a typo on page one: <i>Kelly didn&#39;t know what capybara was, but she was glad that she had chosen the salad Nonetheless.</i> &quot;Nonetheless&quot;shouldn&#39;t be capitalized if it&#39;s part of the previous sentence.<br>-<i>“We got another &#39;Topher survives&#39; mission and it looks like I could just about solo it except for the EMP. Can you back me up, or do I need to call someone?”</i> What&#39;s EMP? I&#39;ll guess an electromagnetic pulse<br>-No disguise?<br>-What fandom is this mission for, anyway? <br>-Do either of the agents have any feelings about this fandom? What does Kelly think when she reads the mission summary? There is a noticeable lack of emotion on the part of both agents which makes the whole story feel slightly off. Kelly doesn&#39;t even seem particularly irritated by the mission. It feels routine. Another day at the office. Pretty depressing, actually. Is this the feel you want for them? I think it could work.<br><br><u>Agents receive a mission with Injerd:</u><br>-<i>Yesterday&#39;s mission was somewhat special, as in it had induced headaches, nausea, and the desire to forget it.</i> That&#39;s special?<br>-<i>She stops as she notices Ingeborg lying on the floor in the main room of the RC.  The Narnian bear is asleep, her paws curled around an empty jug of Blackberry Bleepwine. </i> Ohhh. That was kind of beautiful to read.<br>-Grammar. &quot;Conscientious&quot;is an adjective. I don&#39;t think you can be &quot;conscientious to&quot; someone else. <br>-<i>Another few minutes pass as she dresses and tends to her hair.</i> Makes me wonder what she wears and how she does her hair.<br>-<i>She freezes before opening her bedroom door, not yet knowing if her partner is a grumpy riser.</i> Great way to establish their relationship.<br>-<i> Her eyes fall on the acknowledge button, which is now wedged underneath the panel.</i> What happened to it? What&#39;s her reaction to seeing this? I feel like you cut this off a bit too soon. Like, a paragraph too soon or something.<br>-All in all, this was fun to read. Enough of each agent is shown to make me wat to read more about them.<br><br><u>Random Prompt:</u><br>-Um. I can&#39;t quite see the link between Comed-Tea and the IO.<br>-I thought Kelly said she wasn&#39;t hungry any more?<br>-Pokemon pot pie is NOT OKAY. Eek. That&#39;s a bad line, all right. <br>-&quot;Princess&quot; to &quot;boney harpy&quot;in a matter of seconds? Eek again. That&#39;s pretty jarring.<br>-Wait, that&#39;s where part 2 ends? That doesn&#39;t feel like the end of their conversation, or even a logical stopping point. And I thought it said that Kelly was going to start a food fight. And that the second part would explain how the cafeteria got to be such a mess.<br>-In general, your sentences are good, but the structure and consistency leave a lot to be desired.<br><br><u>Agent Profiles:</u><br>-<i>She has an almost cultish obsession with the Ironic Overpower</i> She doesn&#39;t show this in the stories. I&#39;d expect her to at least bring it up while discussing the console and missions in the random prompt, but she didn&#39;t even mention it.<br>-What continuum is September from? The only thing I can tell is that it isn&#39;t World One, since real Manic Pixie Dream Girls only exist in fictional continua.<br>-I love the idea of the PPC setting up a booth at a job fair. It makes no sense, since that would reveal the existence of the PPC to any inhabitant of the continuum who happened along and would probably constitute an interference with canon, but I love it anyway.<br>-If you&#39;re still thinking of Injerd as a bit character she might not be ready to appear in published stories. <br>-Janitor? What janitor?<br><br><u>General comments:</u><br>-Who is Kelly currently partnered with, and what RC number are they in? It isn&#39;t clear.<br>-Generally, your spinoff seems good, but not fully developed. It could probably be developed just by writing more, though. Whether or not you get Permission, I&#39;d advise you to write lots of stories about these characters, both stories you deem canon and non-canon stories as exercises. <br>--In about a week I will be free of responsibilities and will be able to spend time beta reading and discussing characters if you want to. Email is clickable.<br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t chosen Kelly&#39;s RC yet because someone else might get to that number first.  I was thinking 1038 or 472.<br><br>Guessed right on the EMP.  Yeah, I should have them talk about it being a Dollhouse mission.<br><br>Neither Kelly or September are too passionate about the Duty, it&#39;s a job to them.  I realize that the perfect agent gets so upset that they start slamming their heads against something, but that&#39;s not something I like.<br><br>I&#39;ll keep working on this.</p>

            <p>The procrastination was on me this time, ok? Sorry &#39;bout that ^^; Hit me up on Hangouts whenever :)<br><br>Anyway, yeah, I&#39;m betting on Fire/Dark myself, if only so I can train a Litten named &quot;Darkfield&quot;. But honestly, now that you mention Fire/Poison, and given that he&#39;s probably gonna evolve into something like a tiger, you know what would be REALLY cool? The final evo being based on a manticore. It&#39;d make sense - the tail already looks like it&#39;s got a cluster of spikes even if they&#39;re just hair, and manticores have been stated to be misinterpreted tigers. And just to go with the ballistics theme, maybe the tail could become a full-blown cannon that could shoot poisoned spikes like in some of the myths about the creature. Who knows?<br><br>Whatever happens, I want a manticore Pokemon. Wishful thinking, sure, but still.</p>

            <p>I got excited when they revealed Rowlet as a dual type, because I thought they were all going to dual at the base stage.  Probably not a coincidence that it&#39;s mirroring Generation 1, where the Grass-type starter was the only one to be dual typed at the beginning.  It&#39;ll be interesting to see if the other two follow suit, with Litten getting a second type for its final stage (Dark, based on it&#39;s coloration?) and Popplio staying pure Water.<br><br>Based on the name Alola, map, and general aesthetics of the background characters and areas, I think Sun and Moon appear to take place in the Honolulu analogue.

            <p>It&#39;s something that bothers me, not just about <i>Pokémon</i>, but a lot of Japanese games, that seem to have very ambiguously light-skinned characters that could be either Asian or white.  I guess there&#39;s a logic behind it, since a Japanese games two biggest audiences are Japan and North America, but I really wish they had just made them all clearly Asian, especially for four original generations that actually took place in Poké-Japan.<br><br>And yeah, the customization is back, but they still used the whitish (probably) defaults for the trailer, in the midst of all the Polynesian people.<br><br>—doctorlit is just super-tired of white protagonists, honestly</p>

            <p>There&#39;s also been more than a fair share of conflicts between the writer and beta in this time period too, come to think, which is also something that probably/apparently needs further explication for what the roles are supposed to be. <br><br>The beta shouldn&#39;t be outright ignored when they suggest something to be changed, but it doesn&#39;t mean the beta should be taking control over of the story and turning it into their idea of what should be happening either. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been through that song and dance before, and nobody came out of it well. A beta, in my book, should really be more of an editor than a glorified spell-checker; they should discuss the themes of the work with the person they&#39;re betaing and only seek to change them if they&#39;re really not working.<br><br>I don&#39;t do that.<br><br>I don&#39;t do that because it&#39;s too much like hard work. I don&#39;t do that because I&#39;m lazy. I don&#39;t do that because nine days out of ten I can barely muster an emotional response to what I&#39;m reading and the tenth I&#39;m trying to think through tar. I am a horrible beta and I cover for it by making jokes and cracking wise at the fic&#39;s expense, because even when I can&#39;t do what&#39;s asked of me I can at least do that.<br><br>I urge anyone being a beta, and everyone having their work betaed: take this on board. Think more deeply about your work. I know Iximaz and Skarmory churn out missions like nobody&#39;s business, but it&#39;s not a competition. Your agents are overworked semi-professional exterminators held together by spit and baling wire; you guys aren&#39;t. Take a step back, breathe, and wait for everything to come in. It can only help the process.<br><br>And for the love of God, don&#39;t be me, but you probably knew that already. =]</p>

            <p>Also worrying: The recent tendency to ask for betas one day and posting the mission the very next day (or similarly short period of time).  There is little to no chance that the betas had time to do their work and for the author to make the necessary changes and (hopefully) repeat.<br><br>Maybe we need to teach people how to beta and how to work with a beta?<br><br>-Phobos</p>
