            <p>I already worked with Hieronymus for beta-work, and had problems with his abscence of Google account. Only way I managed to solve this problem until now was by sending him a sharing link, where anyone can comment. I don&#39;t if any other method exists, but I know this one works.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s interesting to see how much is exposed at the back. I guess they weren&#39;t too worried about being attacked from behind?

            <p>The only problem arising from an exposed back is someone sneaking up on you, and it&#39;s a bit hard to sneak up on someone when every time you reach down to shoo a mosquito off your thigh it sounds like the local marching band mixed their instruments up with an assortment of saucepans and baking trays. </p>

            <p>It&#39;s good to hear what the fight would be like, though.

            <p>Sort of like creating a style sheet. I like it.<br><br>The trouble is, we don&#39;t all agree on everything. For instance, I&#39;m fairly adamant that words like agent, assassin, floater, etc. should not be capitalized except when used as a title or specific address (e.g. Agent Acacia, &quot;Do your duty, Assassin.&quot;), but there&#39;s a bit of a history of treating them as special words and thus capitalizing them, and a lot of people do that. And then there are a few cases where the title is based on the name of the department, like Bad Slasher, in which case it retains its capitalization; plus, without caps, it would be hard to tell in this case whether you were referring to an agent in the DBS or a writer of bad slash.<br><br>Also, &quot;neuralyze&quot; and &quot;portaled&quot; are subject to regional spelling differences. I feel that fandom words such as &quot;neuralyze&quot; should always be spelled as they are in their home canon, but on the other hand, I&#39;m not going to argue too much if a British person spells it &quot;neuralyse&quot; in their missions. Same with &quot;portaled&quot;—as an American, I give it one L, like in totaled, but a Brit would be perfectly correct to give both word two Ls.<br><br>The names of Bleep products should always be capitalized, though, like brand names.<br><br>So really we would need at least two sheets, just to cover American vs. Commonwealth differences.<br><br>... I might do it anyway, just for kicks. But not today; I have work.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a proprietary form of brain bleach manufactured exclusively by HFA, which I&#39;d say makes it a brand. It&#39;s not just any old brain bleach; it&#39;s Bleeprin.

            <p>It&#39;s brain <b>ble(e)</b>ach plus aspi<b>rin</b>.

            <p>I&#39;m kidding; there is no trap. But I have an excellent rebuttal: the addition of aspirin to the brain bleach is precisely what sets Bleeprin apart from the generic stuff, and is a tactic infamously used by drug companies everywhere to establish patents and rake in the big bucks. Oh, you want a new patent but your drug is too similar to another drug? Just tack another compound onto the one you actually care about, claim it enhances it or whatever, and you&#39;re all set! Trademark secured.<br><br>I bet some of you still hoover with a Hoover, though. As for saying &quot;coke&quot; when you mean soda/pop, that&#39;s just you and the American South. You&#39;ll forgive me if I don&#39;t take regional aberrations of dialect too seriously as an argument. ^_~<br><br>I&#39;m not saying genericization (ick, what a mouthful) doesn&#39;t happen, but that doesn&#39;t excuse serious writers from capitalizing a brand name when used as such. Whether agents are in fact doing so is a good question. Mine are, at least. {= )<br><br>I have no defense for the Bleeprin knockoffs. A lot of them are explicitly just cooked up in someone&#39;s RC, and I can&#39;t think of any real world cases of something derived from a brand retaining its capital. Probably because attempting such a thing would get you sued in the real world.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m usually so good at avoiding those. Even when I don&#39;t want to. :(<br><br>Waaaaait, are you saying the aspirin is irrelevant to the operation of Bleeprin<sup>TM</sup>? But, but, it relieves the pain! I remember this!<br><br>I honestly don&#39;t know if Hoover still make hoovers; let me check! Yup, looks like they do (and they make roombas, too! [Ducks]). I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen one. Coke, of course, is just cola (which <i>is</i> a generic term); if you&#39;re using it for non-cola-related <s>soda</s> <s>pop</s> <b>carbonated nonalcoholic drinks</b>, you&#39;re doing it horribly wrong.<br><br>I agree that brand names should be correctly formatted when used as such (except Lego, because I refuse to type <i>LEGO</i> all the time, ta very much), but if a (fiction) writer is using a term which is used generically - whether or not the original company has successfully defended their trademark in a legal sense - they are/can be entirely correct to use it as a generic.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As are no-caps stylizations, for that matter. In fact, no-caps stylizations have no place outside the product&#39;s label.<br><br>But yeah, aspirin is totally irrelevant to the function of Bleeprin as brain bleach—and the brain bleach is totally irrelevant to its function as a painkiller. You could, of course, take generic brain bleach and/or aspirin, together or individually, but if you want the specially balanced combined action version, you want the one, the only, Bleeprin. Go ahead. Quaff a kind nepenthe. Because you&#39;re good at what you do, and you deserve the best in quality amnesia. {= )<br><br>But now I&#39;m distracted by the fact that colas are theoretically supposed to taste like kola nuts, but are actually mostly flavored with cinnamon and vanilla, and yet they all taste absolutely awful to me.

Glittery gel pens may not be used to write mission reports, notes, or correspondence with Upstairs. Especially not pink or purple ones.</li>

            <p>Figured I&#39;d come up with at least one for each of my agents. Plus some other general ones.<br><br>Agent-specific:<br>- Do not try to take away Rashida&#39;s inhaler. Especially not while she&#39;s in the middle of using it.<br>- Do not regard the Gold/Silver, Diamond/Pearl, or Black/White games as the &quot;worst generation&quot; of the Pokemon series within Falchion&#39;s vicinity.<br>-- For that matter, do not espouse &quot;Genwunner&quot; viewpoints in front of Falchion unless you want to lose an eye.<br>- Similarly, it is theoretically impossible to say anything along the lines of &quot;Feathered dinosaurs are stupid&quot; (or any other <a href="http://log.johnconway.co/post/46259087381/jurassic-park-4-awesomebro">&quot;awesomebro&quot;</a> sentiments) within earshot of Velociripper and not lose at least one limb.<br>- You can only try hand-feeding Rayner once. And for the love of the Princesses, if you offer him any sort of meat product, do NOT jiggle it around to make it look like it&#39;s alive.<br>- To tell E.V.L. either that men are the superior gender or that ex-Suvians are inferior WILL land you in Medical for at least a week, no matter how you word it.<br>- Do not joke about things getting caught in jet turbines around Sarah. If you do and she inevitably responds accordingly, do NOT ask her to knock out two of my teeth or less.<br>- Do not try to pluck Cupid&#39;s wing feathers. He HATES that. Also, if he has a legitimate excuse to grab himself a drink, you should just let him.<br>- <b><i>DO. NOT. TRY. TO. KILL. LAPIS&#39;. FRIENDS. PERIOD.</i></b><br>- Do not say &quot;I&#39;m really feeling it!&quot; if Backslash is in earshot.<br>- For that matter, do NOT try to flirt with Backslash if Whitney is in earshot.<br><br>General:<br>- Do not try to ask the DMFF if you can have Leviathan or Behemoth as a pet, in any form, from any continuum. Especially not the originals from the Book of Job.<br>- Sneaking up on someone walking through the PPC halls and plowing them through the nearest wall is only funny once. Shouting &quot;GANK!&quot; while doing so is only funny twice.<br>- Do not try to use your console to stream any dirty (i.e. 18+) material. Not even if you work in Bad Slash or any related departments thereof.<br>- Pterosaurs do not make good hang gliders.<br>- If you organize a game night at your RC, let the Flowers know as soon as possible lest your console go off and ruin your winning spree at Monopoly.<br>- Likewise, dance parties in HQ are not to last until any time after 3 AM without Upstairs receiving advance notification. Especially if they involve dubstep, square dancing, or both.<br>- Do not mix Bleeproducts with love potions in any form from any continuum. It NEVER ends well.</p>

Meditite likes it quite a bit; thanks to its ability Pure Power, it can beat the living daylights out of pretty much everything it comes across, so try an all-out attacking set with an Adamant Nature and EVs in Attack and Speed, then give it the moves Drain Punch, Zen Headbutt, Ice Punch, and High Jump Kick - the latter in particular can knock seven bells even out of stuff that resists it.

            <p>It&#39;s been years since I read it last, though. I borrowed it from a library but I&#39;ve moved houses multiple times since then, haha.<br><br>I have the barest memory of the plot, but I remember it being an interesting read.

            <p>&quot;We don&#39;t see Sauron be evil.&quot; Just... just keep this claim in mind.<br><br>Orcs as &quot;lovable misfits&quot;. The shot used is a) of Saruman&#39;s forces, and b) literally the Uruk saying &#39;let&#39;s cannibalise our comrade!&#39;.<br><br>&quot;Sauron is an underdog... fighting against oppressive foreign forces.&quot; Every battle with Sauron except the very last one is one where his armies left Mordor and attacked elsewhere. The only offensive action taken by Gondor is the attack on the Black Gate.<br><br>Sauron&#39;s a good guy because he didn&#39;t want to stay in Mordor. Therefore he went on a murderspree. Let&#39;s ignore the fact that the Hobbit movies - since we&#39;re talking about the movies - quite clearly show that a) he used to live in Mirkwood, and b) Mirkwood was corrupted by his presence, and was actually quite nice beforehand.<br><br>Orcs are a &quot;subjugated class&quot;, and &quot;everyone who lives somewhere terrible deserves it&quot;. I will grant this one.<br><br>&quot;Immortality prevents progress&quot;. Yup, pretty sure that&#39;s Tolkien&#39;s message too. The trouble is a) the elves are no longer a major player by the War of the Rings, and b) Sauron is an immortal who made his chief servants immortal too. #PartOfTheProblem<br><br>&quot;When the Orcs march into battle they do it as a big multiethnic team.&quot; Again, true! But I&#39;m... pretty sure having allies doesn&#39;t make you the good guy, especially when some of them are enslaved.<br><br>&quot;Mordor is a rich multicultural stew with a large base of working poor.&quot; Well, the multicultural aspect isn&#39;t true, because we see those armies marching in shortly before they march out again. The &quot;large base of working poor&quot; part is a valid interpretation of what we <i>see</i> - though Tolkien makes it clear the orcs are slaves, not a working class.<br><br>Orcs are tortured POWs &gt; they are mistreated. If America&#39;s POWs were formed into an army that attacked the USA and refused to surrender under any circumstances, this would be a valid comment.<br><br>Elrond doesn&#39;t like mortals (and doesn&#39;t want Arwen to die): entirely true of Movie!Elrond, but the fact that you&#39;re fighting bigots doesn&#39;t make you a good guy yourself.<br><br>Thranduil is cruel to Orcs. Yes, he is. He&#39;s also cruel to dwarves. Movie!Thranduil is just a generally cruel person.<br><br><i>Lord of the Rings</i> is &quot;fictional white supremacy&quot;. Sure, when your movies cast all the people of equatorial island heritage as pure white, and all the Orcs are painted black, you can draw that conclusion. Where&#39;s that <a href="http://askmiddlearth.tumblr.com/tagged/middle%20earth%20racism">Racism and Middle-earth</a> article...?<br><br>&quot;Sauron makes good points.&quot; Yes. He forges them onto swords and sets out to conquer the world. His actions trump whatever moral high ground you could concievably grant him, and his actions are aggressive, violent, world conquering villainy.<br><br>So no. I disagree. Are the Free Peoples all sweetness and light? No - they&#39;re all isolationists who by and large care only about their own nations (not species - check out Rohan and their dubiousness about Gondor). But Sauron is not a credible alternative.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The entire prequel trilogy is a study in hubris, and <i>The Force Awakens</i> confirms what the EU always told us - Luke Skywalker is pretty much <i>the worst</i> at training Jedi students. I mean, heck, in both the old and new canons, his sister&#39;s reaction to being told she was Force sensitive was pretty much &quot;eh, thanks, but no thanks&quot;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>By which I mean from someone who isn&#39;t that big a fan of either Tolkien or Martin. Let&#39;s face it: the bias for Tolkien on this Board is very high.<br><br>That being said, I&#39;m still going to give it to Tolkien. But it was very close. I feel like Martin had overall better lines — I particularly liked his first verse and, later on, the patter line about Tolkien&#39;s &quot;hairy foot fetish&quot; — but Tolkien had a stronger base. Specifically, his point about fantasy being, well, fantasy. Part of the reason I stopped reading Martin&#39;s books and watching the show is because it was just too damn dark. Good people struggled and died at every turn, while the sinister and the scheming thrived. While Martin had a point about Tolkien&#39;s arguably predictable pattern of good thriving and evil failing (at least, in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy), that&#39;s pretty much how it goes in most works of fiction. Because we want it that way.<br><br>Some other notes:<br>— I was hoping this matchup would appear on ERB, with one change: Martin and Tolkien would be interrupted by J. K. Rowling, who in turn would be interrupted by Terry Pratchett. Fantasy author throw-down.<br>— I liked the detail of Tolkien suddenly appearing on his intro card after taking off the One Ring. I thought it was an editing error at first until I went back and looked more carefully.<br>— Martin is playing Zork on his computer.<br><br>Finally, a bit of fun. Some figures I&#39;d like to see in future ERBs!<br>— The Marx Brothers vs. The Three Stooges<br>— Richard Nixon vs. John F. Kennedy<br>— Henry VIII vs. Elizabeth II (or, heck, Elizabeth I)<br>— George Carlin vs. Richard Pryor<br>— Matt Groening vs. Seth MacFarlane<br>— Avatar Aang vs. Steven Universe</p>

            <p>1/ Tolkien didn&#39;t have a hairy foot fetish. I can say this, because he makes it abundantly clear what his fetish <i>was</i>: long hair. He literally gives elves a racial obsession with the stuff; his wife-insert [what do you call a self-insert of someone else?], Luthien, grows her hair to ridiculous lengths to escape, and wears a cloak made out of it; whenever he mentions hair, it&#39;s long; and the early &#39;Cottage of Lost Play&#39; poem calls out pretty much one feature of Edith: her hair.<br><br>Though I thought the line was funny. ;) I&#39;m just pickin&#39; those nits.<br><br>2/ Good does not thrive in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Yes, the characters get a &#39;happy ending&#39; - but then Tolkien literally sits down in Appendix B and explains exactly how all the main characters died (or moved to Valinor), and how all the elves left and then everything sucked.<br><br>Middle-earth is, at every stage in its history, a world in decline. The actions of Good serve to slow the fall, maybe even arrest it for a little while, but ultimately, everything fades.<br><br>You say &#39;that&#39;s pretty much how it goes in most works of fiction&#39;, and that&#39;s true - but it&#39;s not what happens in Tolkien.<br><br>(If you want me to discuss this further, with examples, I will, but I won&#39;t chuck any more out unasked-for)<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: 3/ I didn&#39;t notice the things you mention in your Other Notes; I was only watching it quickly. That&#39;s pretty cool, though. ^_^ Both thats.</p>

            <p>-Various people would argue with the idea that all Tolkien&#39;s good guys live, such as <i>every single High King of the Noldor</i>.<br><br>-Various people would argue with the idea that all Tolkien&#39;s bad guys die. Sauron made a <i>career</i> out of surviving everything that got thrown at him. Seriously:<br>--Escaped the Valar during the breaking of Utumno.<br>--Shot by Beren.<br>--Mauled by Huan.<br>--(Presumably) punished by Morgoth for that last.<br>--Escaped the Valar during the breaking of Angband.<br>--Persuaded Ar-Pharazon to take him prisoner instead of killing him (and used that to take down Numenor).<br>--Escaped the Fall of Numenor.<br>--Avoided dying at the hands of the Last Alliance.<br>--Escaped the White Council at Dol Guldur.<br><br>There&#39;s others that could be counted, too. And if you argue &#39;well, he died in the end&#39;, then you have to accept that Bilbo, Frodo, Arwen, Beren, and Luthien also all &#39;died in the end&#39;, as a direct result of their heroic actions. Bilbo probably lived longer because of the Ring, but his death came because he let it be destroyed.<br><br>Tolkien&#39;s works are centred on the very Catholic/Christian theme that paradise, innocence, and bliss cannot be reclaimed once they&#39;re lost. Even if you lose them for pure and heroic reasons - Frodo - you won&#39;t be able to go home again and pick up where you left off. This ties in with the whole &#39;fading of the Elves&#39; theme that runs through everything.<br><br>To put it another way, Tolkien is about the <b>ending</b> of archetypes. He writes a world where Pure Evil (Sauron, Orcs) and Pure Good (Galadriel, Aragorn) exist - but are on their way out. The remnants of the First and Second Ages are fading. The future belongs to people like Boromir, or Eowyn: people who have their own internal balance of good and evil, not the ones who Just Know what&#39;s right. Their villains will be less Sauron, and more Saruman - the angel who fell out of curiosity and pride, not the one who consciously chose to destroy.<br><br>~<br><br>Also, my assumption is that if GRRM burst into his study and started rapping at him, JRRT would politely wait until he was finished, say, &quot;Hmm,&quot; and then go back to writing.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s May again, so why not shake the dust off this old thing and give it a whirl?<br><br><br>The rules are simple: this is an AU game in which we get to have a Q&amp;A session with some of our favourite PPC agents. As such, it is <i>strictly non-canon</i> for all participants due to the fact that, well, World One authors are having their questions answered by the agents themselves.<br><br>The format will be as follows:<br><br>Other Board / T-Board setup post<br><br>&gt;BoarderName1&#39;s Agents&#39; Mailbox (nm)<br>&gt;&gt;Question(s) for BN1&#39;s Agent1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Answer(s) to the above<br>&gt;&gt;Question(s) for BN1&#39;s Agent2 and Agent3<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Answer(s) to the above<br>&gt;&gt;Another question for BN1&#39;s Agent1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Answer to the above <br><br>&gt;BoarderName2&#39;s Agents&#39; Mailbox (nm)<br>&gt;&gt;Question(s) for BN2&#39;s Agent 2<br><br><br>...and so on.<br><br><br>Do we have any takers? And can someone tech-y tell me if the T-Board is good to go or if I should host this on the Other Board instead?<br></p>

            <p>To which I&#39;m sure a large group of people are going &#39;you left&#39;?<br><br>The answer to that is I&#39;ve been out on deployment in the ocean for the last several months, and now I&#39;m finally back on actually solid ground, that doesn&#39;t have camels in large quantities.<br><br>In the last few months I&#39;ve stared at the ocean lots and have seen sharks and dolphins, swam in the granite ringed pool of a wadi, gotten lost in a Middle Eastern castle (or two), haggled for goods in open markets, accidentally bought silver, stared at the tallest buildings in the world (they&#39;re really tall!) and tromped through the ancient city of Petra. All that, and a lot of small boats, some with guns attached to them! Very exciting. Not much sleep. Lots of reading books in line to wait to eat. I&#39;ve also lived off Chex mix and coffee.  <br><br>I&#39;ve also wrote a lot, and have found loads of inspiration for getting back into writing PPC things, besides original stuff.<br><br>And on the topic of writing PPC things, since I&#39;ve been gone I know a few people had/have contacted me  and expressed interest in doing PPC cowrites for me- I remember for sure that Silentthunder is one, and that Scapegrace is another.<br><br>I can&#39;t put forth a massive claim that I know for 100% certain that I&#39;ll be able to be a <i>fast</i> coauthor, but if anyone&#39;s interested in doing a cowrite for a mission or just something set in HQ as well, feel free to hit me up, since I&#39;m definitely available and have internet on a far more regular basis.<br><br>-July who apparently is salty now?</p>

Along with standing lookout and manning the ship&#39;s helm- driving it!<br><br>But I&#39;ve been an OS now- Operations Specialist- which means when we&#39;re out to sea I stare at radar screens and track things that we find, so we know what they are and what they&#39;re doing. I also do fancy things on paper with pencils to do calculus problems so we can find out what track things are going on against us, so can tell whether something will be getting too close to us, and how fast it actually is going. <br><br>This means I sit under blue lighting and we all look Very Dramatic while trying to not fall asleep.<br><br>Currently however I&#39;m cranking- which means I&#39;m working in the galley and messdecks to help feed everyone. I have over the course of the last month or so because of this worked for 21 hours straight, cut hundreds of melons into smaller pieces of melon for people to eat, and cracked a few thousand eggs. <br><br>I have become so skilled at egg cracking that when I started, I could crack eggs one handed. <br><br>Now I can crack eggs one handed in the air against each other without breaking the other egg. My high score on this egg brutality is a dozen eggs against a single egg. <br><br>...As you can guess it can get pretty boring, cracking that many eggs. </p>

            <p>I was trying to buy gifts for friends. I picked out what looked to be cheap jewelry. <br><br>Get to the counter and they begin weighing it. This point,  I&#39;m going &quot;huh?&quot;. Pull some items aside and decide to not buy them after all due to price- 70$ for a string of pearls. <br><br>Eventually I pull out one of the items I bought and inspect it later and go &quot;... that is silver tarnish. This is a large silver bracelet. Oop.&quot;. The bracelet was about $50. Big chunky thing. <br><br>I also nearly bought a giant wooden camel for Huinesoron in defiance of sanity but thankfully for him I had no space for it anywhere. </p>

            <p>The landless baron returned with a storm to her back, doing its best to tear the flame painted sails from their lines and the mast, but her skill by now outpaced that of the wind and rain, long enough that her small vessel made it to the enclosed harbor of Borrd in time enough for the storm to descend into a strong drizzle.<br><br>This did not aid her especially, as her companion was displeased with the rain in the first place and not particularly behooved to listen to her whatsoever.<br><br>With coaxing, however, in the form of strong words and threat of violence— she did, after all, still have her sword, bound though it was— eventually he followed her away from the harbor docks, and out of the town.<br><br>After all, she still had someone to find, to ask after the news of everything that had occurred during her long travels— much had changed, this she knew.<br><br>However, those very changes beguiled her and prevented her from finding her hopeful source.<br><br>Eventually she found herself outside of Vaekew, standing before marble steps. Between her appearance— salt still visible on her oiled cloak, her windblown hair half out of its braid, eyes shadowed, the sword ather side— and that of her companion, passerby kept a fair and healthy distance, until finally she lost her patience and grabbed at one of the staff members leaving from the hospital itself.<br><br>&quot;I cannot find the baron Huinesoron,&quot; she said. &quot;For him I have a gift, so I must leave it to his lady instead. Ensure the delivery. You do not wish this one to wander.&quot;<br><br>The  staff member looked at her, and then her companion in disbelief before trying to protest. &quot;But—&quot;<br><br>&quot;And be aware! He has a foul temper!&quot; She paused a moment. &quot;Not the baron,&quot; she added.<br><br>To her odious companion she said, &quot;I am glad to be rid of you, you miserable thing. Mayhap Baron Huinesoron find some use for you!&quot;<br><br>He tried to spit at her, which she dodged. <br><br>The wanderer-baron left the camel to the baffled hospital staff member. She had other things to deliver and news to learn, and to people who were less difficult to find. </p>

Baron July brought it-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wait.&quot; Huinesoron held up a hand. &quot;Baron <i>July</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mm-hmm. She-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wasn&#39;t she the one who kicked me out of Pankae?&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn blinked. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure that was the Iric revolution,&quot; she pointed out, &quot;which was started by Dann - Juliette, I mean.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, I&#39;m certain she was involved.&quot; The baron chewed on his lip. &quot;And now she&#39;s sending me lumpy horses. I don&#39;t think I like her very much.&quot;<br><br>&quot;She&#39;s not so bad,&quot; Kaitlyn said with a shrug. &quot;She&#39;s good for a game of cards when the Council&#39;s getting dull.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron opened his mouth to reply, then paused. &quot;I thought that only happened in that awful play.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s amazing what you don&#39;t notice when you&#39;re declaiming,&quot; Kaitlyn said, smirking. Then her face set into harsh lines. &quot;Now get that foul-spirited spitting <i>beast</i> out of my hospital, or I&#39;ll remind you exactly why I went ^_^ back in the day.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... got it.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>So now he&#39;s got a camel. Heaven knows what he&#39;s going to do with it. (And no, I don&#39;t think Baron Me has had much contact with July since he holed up in Ozerbord; I&#39;m sure he&#39;d like her if he talked to her.)<br><br>That was hilarious.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;d skipped a bit in my head. Since Baron July ended up leaving Iric herself, Baron Me would probably have spent a fair chunk of time commiserating with her.

            <p>Welcome back, Val. We missed you, and we&#39;re all glad you&#39;re home safe. =]<br><br>Since you&#39;re technically a returnbie at this point, please accept this NG+ starter Pokйmon!<br><img src="http://randompokemon.com/sprites/animated/693.gif"><br>Iiiiiiiit&#39;s Clawitzer!<br><br>And your starting item is:-<br><img src="http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/a/a0/Pyromaniac_Icon.png?version=3832c8809ccc80826840b32f111cb5bf"><br>Pyromaniac from <i>The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth</i>!<br><br>And no, I didn&#39;t fudge the rolls. Pyromaniac&#39;s a really, really good item on Clawitzer thanks to how Mega Launcher works: the item makes you immune to bullet, bomb, and pulse moves, and makes you heal off your own ones for 50% of the damage dealt. Combine that with Mega Launcher boosting the damage of pulse moves by 50%, and you have yourself some serious power. In singles, try a Modest one with EVs in Special Attack and HP, with Aura Sphere, Water Pulse, Ice Beam, and Dark Pulse in your move slots. Doubles, however, is a different story; you want to go for Heal Pulse over Ice Beam, I think. Heal Pulse with Mega Launcher heals 75%(!) of the target&#39;s maximum HP... and thanks to Pyromaniac, YOU get healed for half that! Team it with a Chansey or something and watch yourself become unstoppable! Just remember, though: have fun. =]</p>

            <p>The moral of the story is, of course, that we could have avoided all this drama if y&#39;all had just remembered to use proper capitalization. Of course. ^_~<br><br>Honestly, though, I think the world is a better place with the possibility of Bleeprin shortages. Agents might have to think differently about when and how often they use it. They might even have to resort to alternatives. It could be fun.<br><br>Or we could just keep on doing like we&#39;re doing. That&#39;s always an option.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So I figured I&#39;d put up my team on here just to show people what it was. So, let&#39;s get to the Pokemon<br><br>Myanmar AKA Hippowdown<br>Ability: Sand Stream<br>Moves: Earthquake, Slack Off, Stealth Rock, Toxic<br>Item: Leftovers<br><br>So Myanmar was in some ways the center of the team, it&#39;s ability to whip up sandstorms meant that important chip damage would be applied to all non-ground, rock or steel types that tried to take it on. Stealth Rock and Toxic helped build up that chip damage, Slack Off kept it healthy and Earthquake made sure it a) wasn&#39;t taunt bait and b) made sure it could threaten any non flying pokemon with its STAB move. Leftovers helped the recovery.<br><br>The Blazing Aura AKA Mamoswine<br>Ability: Thick Fat<br>Moves: Earthquake, Knock Off, Ice Shard, Avalanche<br>Items: Assault Vest<br><br>Aah my faithful Mamoswine. One of the few sets completely designed by me, anyway. Thick Fat helped it tank Ice and Fire moves, supported by Assault Vest that raised it&#39;s Special Defense meant that any Flamerthrowers or the like headed its way weren&#39;t going to take it out. It&#39;s moves were meant to be able to take out the threats it&#39;d often be face with, Knock Off helped remoe items and was a quite powerful move the first time around. The normal STAB Earthquake would take down most Fire types sent it&#39;s way, and could deal with more besides. Ice Shard allowed it to hit first with priority when needed and could still pack a punch. Avalanche revolved around Mamoswine&#39;s position as a tank, take a hit and become more powerful because of it, even without the hit it still does decent damage off of Mamoswine attack. <br><br>Phoenigetuzstha AKA Gliscor<br>Ability: Poison Heal<br>Moves: Earthquake, Facade, Substitute, Swords Dance<br>Item: Toxic Orb<br><br>The set-up attacker with it&#39;s own form of recovery. Poison Heal worked well alongside Toxic Orb to allow Gliscor to heal 12% ech turn after it was poisoned, it also prevent burn from affecting it too badly AND went hand in hand with Facade doubling it&#39;s power. Substitute allowed Gliscor to tank a move and prepare it&#39;s Swords Dance to reach a nice level of attack, and Earthquake was a nice STAB move. It does however have a slight problem with Ghosts that fly or levitate...<br><br>Dijifuji AKA Garchomp<br>Ability: Sand Veil (After Mega evolution, Sand Force)<br>Moves: Earthquake, Fire Blast, Aqua Tail, Dragon Claw<br>Item: Garchompite<br><br>A mega because I thought I would need one, and boy did it work. Nicely set up to be a physically defensive tank (until a Torterra turned it into mince meat), Garchomp worked a lot better in a sandstorm than out. Sand Veil meant that I could dodge a moe or two, and the 20 extra speed the normal form had was useful on occasion, whilst Sand Force boosted Earthquake&#39;s power during a Sandstorm to almost monsterous levels. Earthquake and Dragon Claw were the two STABs that meant it hit every type at least neutrally, Fire Blast was mainly because with Gastrodon my team could take on Skarmory&#39;s, and the special fire move circumvented that. It also did wonders in surprising other pokemon. Aqua Tail was (once again until Gastrodon came along) my teams answer to other Ground types, but worked well in other situations that needed it as well. Mega Garchomp is more tanky than normal Garchomp, so it was I suppose a logical choice to take a Garchompite.<br><br>Lost Heros AKA Gastrodon<br>Ability: Storm Drain<br>Moves: Scald, Clear Smog, Recover, Hidden Power (Grass)<br>Item: Leftovers<br><br>The anti Water-Ground Pokemon of my team and last mintue addition when I realised I could have a substitute. Came in a lot more use than I thought it would and now has a permenant place on my Mono-Ground team. Storm Drain stopped water Pokemon dead, and gave a nice boost to special attack, Scald works as a primary STAB due to it&#39;s 30% chance to burn, Clear Smog is a nice (if weak) poison type move that allowed me to stop some set up sweepers along the way, Recover and leftovers gave some life back ot Gastrodon and Hidden Power was my answer to water Pokemon. <br><br>SSTxReaper AKA Excadrill<br>Ability: Sand Rush<br>Moves: Iron Head, Earthquake, Rapid Spin, Rock Slide<br>Item: Metronome<br><br>Slight variation on the set I&#39;m fairly certain SeaTurtle used for Trident, Metronome allowed Reaper to switch moves if need be, although repeated use of a move made it more powerful, and made it seem to have a Choice Band  that could screw with some people&#39;s predictions. Sand Rush allowed it to double speed in Sandstorm, which combined with repeated Metronome usage could make it an absolute killer. Rapid Spin let me take out entry hazards, Iron Head alongside the nice 30% flinch chance was a nice STAB move that worked well with Earthquake, whilst Rock Slide completed the coverage and could flinch by itself. <br><br>TaQud AKA Krookodile<br>Ability: Moxie<br>Moves: Knock Off, Earthquake, Super Power, Stone Edge<br>Item: Choice Scarf<br><br>Good revenge killer and late game sweeper on a team that didn&#39;t really need it. Has really given it&#39;s place up for Gastrodon most of the time but came out for the final on the educated guess SeaTurtle would keep their Hippowdon on the team and so I could still use sand to my advantage if I needed to. Choice Scarf gave it the speed it need to threaten everything bar other, faster Scarf users, Priority users and Sand Rush users, whilst Moxie gave it the ability to get stronger as it took out pokemon. Knock Off was a STAB move that could take items off, wouldn&#39;t have worked so well if the Pokemon survived one Knock Off as it would then half in power, but it&#39;s nice to take out Psychic and Ghost team, Earthquake is a powerful STAB move, &#39;nough said. Stone Edge allowed perfect cover, it&#39;s power was needed over Rock Slide&#39;s at the cost of accuracy. Super Power gave some more coverage and worked well as the attack decrease could be negated by Moxie and the defense decrease wouldn&#39;t matter due to it&#39;s speed.<br><br>As to names. All seven of the names come from RPers who took part in a series of RP&#39;s called the Ultima Tournament about four or fie years ago, it was a Pokemon RP and, indeed my first RP ever and probably the reason I&#39;m here now. Myanmar was the creator of the RP&#39;s and so his name matched perfectly to Hippowdon as the center of the team and the reason why all the Pokemon were together. <br>Reaper, Phoen, TaQud and TBA were the finalists in the first Ultima Tournament, Reaper used very offensive pokemon and so I thought well suited to the role of Excadrill, Phoen was known for her Volcarona which would set up and then wreak havoc, a perfect RPer for my Gliscor to be named after, TaQud fitted Krookodile&#39;s personality and usage very well. TBA, or rather, me was a bit of an all rounder and a tank, added to that Mamoswine is my favourite pokemon so I had to put my old username and my RPing name onto my team. <br>Dijifuji was the RPer who was used during the first Ultima Tournament to get the plot moving and ended up quite central to it spending quite a lot of time with legendary dragon pokemon (or as they called them, dragon broksie&#39;s) and so they were perfect for my own dragon broski, Garchomp. <br>Finally Lost Heros was a RPer who joined in with the second Ultima Torunament, was a finalist in that and was also fairly important to the plot, as the newcomer and the person who fitted the gaps in the current line up of RPers, they were perfect for the Pokemon that did the same for my team, Gastrodon. <br><br>So that&#39;s it. That&#39;s why I said &quot;for Ultima&quot; in the finals and that&#39;s what my team was and why they were called that.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been drifting away from FPS games for a while now. The modern/future stuff has never really appealed to me, and I stopped played <i>Team Fortress 2</i> about a year and a half ago due to growing disillusionment with the matches and the community. The only FPS games I still play on and off now are from the <i>Borderlands</i> series.<br><br>That being said, I recently felt the itch to try them out again. See if new developments made them more palatable. So I tried out both the <i>Overwatch</i> beta and <i>Battleborn</i> (I decided to pick up the latter after enjoying the <i>Battleborn</i> beta earlier this year). I have to admit: I&#39;m won over, for the moment. Both games are pretty good.<br><br>I especially want to give a nod of appreciation to <i>Battleborn</i>, which seems to have received short shrift from much of the gaming community. It is definitely not a perfect game, but I&#39;m having a very good time with it. I honestly wasn&#39;t sure if I would enjoy the MOBA aspect of it (not a big fan of the genre), but those features are not overpowering. Versus matches aren&#39;t the drawn-out slogs I was worried about. The cooperative story missions are a definite plus. I&#39;ve always preferred co-op multiplayer to competitive, and this provides that.<br><br>While <i>Overwatch</i> doesn&#39;t do anything with co-op, it&#39;s still a pretty fine experience. I&#39;ve gotten pretty good with both Mercy and Zarya. I look forward to the game actually coming out.<br><br>SHAMELESS PLUG INCOMING<br><br>If anyone wanted to check out a bit of <i>Battleborn</i> for themselves, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugmPsZiJZQg">recorded myself</a> playing one of the story missions. (The video contains sci-fi violence and some swearing.)<br><br>PS: I hate to admit it, but I really liked that <i>Battlefield</i> trailer. I&#39;ve missed historical shooters.</p>

            <p>...in the sense that the British Mark V tanks are actually working. I&#39;d pay good money if DICE made it a feature that, while driving the tank, the player would be deafened by the engine, lose health due to said engine not having an exhaust pipe and thus slowly gassing its crew to death, and that the tank be prone to mechanical failures :P<br><br>On the up side, the commonality of bolt-action weapons in that era means that mкlйe weapons can be balanced and play a significant role in the game as opposed to being used as last resort or humiliation weapons. It would quite accurately reflect history, where a knife or a club could be wielded much more easily than a rifle. <br><br>But at the same time... EA. Stupid, blasted EA Games.<br><br>Please, DICE.

            <p>They should also add a feature where, as your character stays in the game, they very slowly go insane, and eventually leave the war a broken shell of what they used to be. <br><br>Bonus points for whoever has the least PTSD at the end of the round! <br><br>But, really, I do wonder if one <i>could</i> do balanced and realistic tank gameplay. <br>From what I understand, it came down to complete luck that your tank would even start. <br>Doesn&#39;t sound too fun to me. <br>I suppose there&#39;s a &#39;Guns of Icarus&#39; sort of thing crouching in the corner somewhere around that, but Guns of Icarus uses a whole lot of suspension of disbelief (hitting things with wrenches makes their damage worse, in my experience.)</p>

            <p>64-man Strike at Karkand Infantry-only all day, everyday. Those were the days...<br><br>I did see that Dawn of War III trailer. I&#39;m sure this is just a hype trailer with no plot involved. It&#39;s there to feature glorious scenes of battle, chainswords, and the promise of a great upheaval. <br><br>I really hope the Imperial Guard show up again in an expansion or something.

            <p>Just to let you guys know I&#39;m currently working on building a base in some tunnels underneath the river downhill from spawn. I know I&#39;ve already dug into someone else&#39;s mine by accident and have blocked up the passage for now. <br><br>Just thought I&#39;d let you know in case someone decided to deepen the river and then flood my tunnel network.  </p>

            <p>Now, for the explanations.<br><br>I began with the ugly pseudo-cube on the top of the pyramid, before beginning to mine it my usual way: going downwards, carving a room 4 blocks huge, strip-mining them and covering them with torchs to explore with minimal creep intrusion. <br><br>However, I usually don&#39;t do this on a hill, so I ended up piercing it again and again. That was when I decided to build proper walls for each room, making sure I knew its limits, and eventually creating something which could be spotted by people coming back from exploration.<br><br> Since that was quite ugly, I settled for the pyramid you saw, with a face cut short for not encroaching on Spawn Central&#39;s underground, and a zone more advanced for covering a cliff of the hill.<br><br>Now, if people want to work on it too, by amenaging the rooms or helping for decoration, I&#39;d be glad to let them do this. The structure can also be a relatively secure start point for mining the galleries. <br><br>The lowest room for the moment also has got a small garden I began, although the room is to amenage (the all-cobble floor is a mean for me to know if I&#39;m still under the structure when I&#39;m mining deeper, although accomodations will have to be made for the garden. Eh, a cobble &#39;road&#39; could be made for the galleries too.)<br><br>Of course, if you find it ugly/useless, say it. I can always bury it with the dirt I dug. Or making bigger degrees to make more space for each room. Anything you deem fit.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m actually pretty displeased.<br><br>I spent a couple hours last night detreeing and then flattening out that area so logging on this morning to find that there was an immense gaping hole with a cobblepyramid in its place with floating land to the side in its place wasn&#39;t exactly the nicest surprise.<br><br>SeaTurtle had already started a mining operation closeby, but not too far away.<br><br>The fact that the whole area was cleared and flattened by someone not you should have given you pause to consider and check first, instead of running roughshod like that, especially considering that there&#39;s a whole lot of map where you <i>could</i> have done it elsewhere. <br><br>Basically it comes down to: Why did you decide to <i>stripmine<i> on spawn, right next to the fort, and take over an awful lot of space that someone else had done work on prior?</i></i></p>

            <p>Nothing to say.

            <p>It&#39;s never explicitly said in canon what material it is they&#39;re made of but they&#39;re frequently described as being like marble (you know... indestructible, sparkling marble...) and when we see one of the sparklepires get her head ripped off and later dismembered, there was no blood, just the sound of rocks being broken.

            <p>That&#39;s probably one of the most unpleasant badfics I&#39;ve ever been exposed to. Bizarre, but not bizarre enough to have the distancing effect that makes crack funny. Your agents&#39;observations were spot on. I&#39;m also really enjoying seeing them develop. Ix is kind of reminding me of a Lighter and Softer version of Gabrielle, but maybe that&#39;s because I was just rereading her spinoff.

            <p>This one was definitely bizarre, but I wouldn&#39;t say it was unpleasant. At least, there was nothing squicky (for me) in it, just a boatload of annoyances.<br><br>Ix being like Gabrielle, I&#39;m not too sure about. Gabrielle is a Stepford Smiler—she hides her pain behind a faзade of bubbly happiness. With Ix, what you see is what you get; even though she had traumatic stuff happen to her, she had support in her family and at Hogwarts so she never had the time to develop the angst that was scheduled for her later in the fic she came from. <br><br><i>I know a song that gets on everybody&#39;s nerves, everybody&#39;s nerves, everybody&#39;s nerves!

            <p>Hoom, hoom.<br><br><b>Fic to spork:</b> I have no idea what SeaQuest is and none of the people I asked knew it, so I can&#39;t really say whether the fic breaks canon, but it definitely has Sue warning signs. The SPaG isn&#39;t fantastic, either.<br><br><b>Writing ability (technical):</b> Definitely better. However, your SPaG still has some pretty glaring errors (like comma/full stop substitutions and missing quotation marks). I think you could really use more betas. My own rule of thumb — y&#39;know, for stuff I publish — is never less than two betas, three if I&#39;m not certain and more if I&#39;m doing something big or drastic. Further, leaving stuff like &quot;RC {number}&quot; in when you can just say &quot;the RC&quot; makes your piece looks unfinished.<br><br>As a note, the present tense on the Injerd prompt is annoying and not done often, but not too bad an attribute.<br><br><b>PPC knowledge:</b> Mostly solid, except for the recruiter at the job fair (I don&#39;t think the PPC does that?) and the implied eating of Pokйmon in the Cafeteria (ew, no). Also, Medical (the department) is capitalised.<br><br><b>Activity:</b> So far, the most I&#39;ve seen out of you is a) activity related to your Permission and b) one-liners appended to stuff other people say. I feel that you&#39;re not really involved with the community right now. Not posting a lot is completely fine — RL eats your time, you&#39;re away from Internet, whatever — but right now the little you post has no interaction in it, which is pretty bad.<br><br><b>Writing ability (creative):</b> <br>-The Kelly and Injerd prompt is pretty good, as Key noted. One thing that is really problematic, though, is that it&#39;s basically cut off; the ending is way too abrupt and not a natural &quot;ending point&quot; (like, say, leaving for the mission).<br>-The Kelly and September prompt, well. It feels kinda robotic, there — not too much feeling. Further, September&#39;s problem is really confusing — did she eat something bad or is she having her period? Further, the thing about fandoms — I had to google &quot;Topher Brink&quot; to figure the mission is <i>Dollhouse</i>; you should really try to make your writing accessible to people unfamiliar with the fandom concerned (it is my humble opinion that doing so is one of the signs of a truly good PPC writer).<br>-The food fight prompt has two problems: the cook&#39;s mood swing, which is pretty jarring, and the lack of any food fight in a prompt about a food fight. It also looks cut-off.<br>-The last prompt has one really big problem: it&#39;s a prompt about DAC despite it being supposed to be about a robot wearing a paper mask. September and Kelly&#39;s interactions are OK, though.<br>-The &quot;personality&quot; section in Kelly&#39;s profile doesn&#39;t fit what we actually see of her. September and Injerd&#39;s are much better.<br><br><b>Conclusion:</b> almost and with marked improvement, but not quite yet. The clincher of my decision is the activity bit; the PPC is a community first and a shared universe second. Unless another PG objects, <b>Permission denied</b>.<br><small>(Don&#39;t give up. You&#39;re nearly there.)</small></p>

            <p>Sorry for taking that so literally! That&#39;s a really creative way to fulfill the prompt: a <i>fight</i> over <i>food</i>. I&#39;m laughing at myself so hard now for not getting it. I love it.</p>

            <p>1) Yes, I&#39;ve read the whole prompt. No, the robot wasn&#39;t consequential. It could&#39;ve been a yellow tank with bunny ears for all the relevance it had to the plot (none).<br>2) I guess you can just say he was being sarcastic?

What I said was all about working around the limitations, like <ul>
<br><li>If the Stu claims that your agents can’t do anything to him, because he’s immortal, find him a fate worse than death.<br>
</li>
<li>If the prompt claims that it’s about a robot wearing a paper face mask of a canon character, use this as a <b>starting point</b> (&quot;the first two sentences&quot;) to make your agents bicker about their different perception of this canon character, or recent developments in this canon, or the advantages and disadvantages of wearing a paper mask, or to make anything happen that may, by the weird laws of PPC HQ, be caused by meeting this robot. As long as it is a good story, nobody will complain that it’s not actually about the robot.</li>
</ul>   <br>Telling a random story, where the agents meet the robot only near the end and barely react to it, apart from Kelly contemplating a memory for one paragraph, doesn’t work around the limitations.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I promised myself I&#39;d stay out of this, but I just can&#39;t.<br><br>So. Look. Here are your options for a prompt.<br><br>1. A hole suddenly opens in the floor of your agents&#39; RC, directly under their feet, and they fall 20 feet onto a pile of mattresses. The sides are vertical and there are no ladders.<br><br>2. When your agents step through the portal to start their mission, they find themselves in a badfic set in a canon they do not recognise. Their RA displays the message &#39;Portal malfunction; please wait half an hour and try again&#39;. Someone is charging at them with a canon-appropriate weapon.<br><br>3. While walking through HQ, your agents are physically caught in a trap of your choosing. It was laid by insane former agent Mylissa, who plans to hold them to ransom and demand their Department Head supply her with caffeine and chocolate. (Mylissa is mentioned <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1SQQGdpJf9rFvQGtRGcDQReuke9b5ZYXgTZEYITH2cFU">here</a> and appears <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pHfubKjf6k9l9MZAfFpacN9pjtnxkhI96C1AqUNBIL4/pub">here</a>. She is not free-to-use, but I&#39;m letting you write her however you like for the purposes of this.)<br><br>Choose one. Make it the start of your story. Write 400-800 words from that point.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>More like five cents. This got long.<br><br><u>Agents receive a mission:</u><br>-You have a typo on page one: <i>Kelly didn&#39;t know what capybara was, but she was glad that she had chosen the salad Nonetheless.</i> &quot;Nonetheless&quot;shouldn&#39;t be capitalized if it&#39;s part of the previous sentence.<br>-<i>“We got another &#39;Topher survives&#39; mission and it looks like I could just about solo it except for the EMP. Can you back me up, or do I need to call someone?”</i> What&#39;s EMP? I&#39;ll guess an electromagnetic pulse<br>-No disguise?<br>-What fandom is this mission for, anyway? <br>-Do either of the agents have any feelings about this fandom? What does Kelly think when she reads the mission summary? There is a noticeable lack of emotion on the part of both agents which makes the whole story feel slightly off. Kelly doesn&#39;t even seem particularly irritated by the mission. It feels routine. Another day at the office. Pretty depressing, actually. Is this the feel you want for them? I think it could work.<br><br><u>Agents receive a mission with Injerd:</u><br>-<i>Yesterday&#39;s mission was somewhat special, as in it had induced headaches, nausea, and the desire to forget it.</i> That&#39;s special?<br>-<i>She stops as she notices Ingeborg lying on the floor in the main room of the RC.  The Narnian bear is asleep, her paws curled around an empty jug of Blackberry Bleepwine. </i> Ohhh. That was kind of beautiful to read.<br>-Grammar. &quot;Conscientious&quot;is an adjective. I don&#39;t think you can be &quot;conscientious to&quot; someone else. <br>-<i>Another few minutes pass as she dresses and tends to her hair.</i> Makes me wonder what she wears and how she does her hair.<br>-<i>She freezes before opening her bedroom door, not yet knowing if her partner is a grumpy riser.</i> Great way to establish their relationship.<br>-<i> Her eyes fall on the acknowledge button, which is now wedged underneath the panel.</i> What happened to it? What&#39;s her reaction to seeing this? I feel like you cut this off a bit too soon. Like, a paragraph too soon or something.<br>-All in all, this was fun to read. Enough of each agent is shown to make me wat to read more about them.<br><br><u>Random Prompt:</u><br>-Um. I can&#39;t quite see the link between Comed-Tea and the IO.<br>-I thought Kelly said she wasn&#39;t hungry any more?<br>-Pokemon pot pie is NOT OKAY. Eek. That&#39;s a bad line, all right. <br>-&quot;Princess&quot; to &quot;boney harpy&quot;in a matter of seconds? Eek again. That&#39;s pretty jarring.<br>-Wait, that&#39;s where part 2 ends? That doesn&#39;t feel like the end of their conversation, or even a logical stopping point. And I thought it said that Kelly was going to start a food fight. And that the second part would explain how the cafeteria got to be such a mess.<br>-In general, your sentences are good, but the structure and consistency leave a lot to be desired.<br><br><u>Agent Profiles:</u><br>-<i>She has an almost cultish obsession with the Ironic Overpower</i> She doesn&#39;t show this in the stories. I&#39;d expect her to at least bring it up while discussing the console and missions in the random prompt, but she didn&#39;t even mention it.<br>-What continuum is September from? The only thing I can tell is that it isn&#39;t World One, since real Manic Pixie Dream Girls only exist in fictional continua.<br>-I love the idea of the PPC setting up a booth at a job fair. It makes no sense, since that would reveal the existence of the PPC to any inhabitant of the continuum who happened along and would probably constitute an interference with canon, but I love it anyway.<br>-If you&#39;re still thinking of Injerd as a bit character she might not be ready to appear in published stories. <br>-Janitor? What janitor?<br><br><u>General comments:</u><br>-Who is Kelly currently partnered with, and what RC number are they in? It isn&#39;t clear.<br>-Generally, your spinoff seems good, but not fully developed. It could probably be developed just by writing more, though. Whether or not you get Permission, I&#39;d advise you to write lots of stories about these characters, both stories you deem canon and non-canon stories as exercises. <br>--In about a week I will be free of responsibilities and will be able to spend time beta reading and discussing characters if you want to. Email is clickable.<br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>And I guess this confirms that the next Fire starter is gonna be based on a tiger, huh? Seems like the Chinese Zodiac theory isn&#39;t disproven after all... For now, anyway. Circus sea lion looks neat, too, I hope they turn it into a big badass leopard seal or something. And what, no talk about the legendaries? I&#39;m kinda hoping the lion one is Fire/Fairy or Fire/Psychic, since the moon bat looks clearly Psychic/Flying or Fairy/Flying.<br><br>Regardless, I WANT TWENTY ROWLETS TO FLY ME TO WORK EVERY DAY EEEER</p>

            <p>I&#39;m betting it&#39;s a fake out. I think Litten will end up Psychic type, thus sparking a brand new trend of same-typed Fire starters to pick up where Emboar left off.</p>

            <p>The procrastination was on me this time, ok? Sorry &#39;bout that ^^; Hit me up on Hangouts whenever :)<br><br>Anyway, yeah, I&#39;m betting on Fire/Dark myself, if only so I can train a Litten named &quot;Darkfield&quot;. But honestly, now that you mention Fire/Poison, and given that he&#39;s probably gonna evolve into something like a tiger, you know what would be REALLY cool? The final evo being based on a manticore. It&#39;d make sense - the tail already looks like it&#39;s got a cluster of spikes even if they&#39;re just hair, and manticores have been stated to be misinterpreted tigers. And just to go with the ballistics theme, maybe the tail could become a full-blown cannon that could shoot poisoned spikes like in some of the myths about the creature. Who knows?<br><br>Whatever happens, I want a manticore Pokemon. Wishful thinking, sure, but still.</p>

            <p>I got excited when they revealed Rowlet as a dual type, because I thought they were all going to dual at the base stage.  Probably not a coincidence that it&#39;s mirroring Generation 1, where the Grass-type starter was the only one to be dual typed at the beginning.  It&#39;ll be interesting to see if the other two follow suit, with Litten getting a second type for its final stage (Dark, based on it&#39;s coloration?) and Popplio staying pure Water.<br><br>Based on the name Alola, map, and general aesthetics of the background characters and areas, I think Sun and Moon appear to take place in the Honolulu analogue.  Sure makes the default-white protagonists stick out like sore thumbs.  &#39;~&#39;<br><br>Man, I need to haul tail and get through <i>Pokйmon Y</i>.

            <p>Only one of the protagonists is default white (Unova), the others are variously Asian, or in the case of X &amp; Y customizable. Secondly, the customization from X &amp; Y is returning for Sun &amp; Moon.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s something that bothers me, not just about <i>Pokйmon</i>, but a lot of Japanese games, that seem to have very ambiguously light-skinned characters that could be either Asian or white.  I guess there&#39;s a logic behind it, since a Japanese games two biggest audiences are Japan and North America, but I really wish they had just made them all clearly Asian, especially for four original generations that actually took place in Pokй-Japan.<br><br>And yeah, the customization is back, but they still used the whitish (probably) defaults for the trailer, in the midst of all the Polynesian people.<br><br>—doctorlit is just super-tired of white protagonists, honestly</p>

            <p>There&#39;s also been more than a fair share of conflicts between the writer and beta in this time period too, come to think, which is also something that probably/apparently needs further explication for what the roles are supposed to be. <br><br>The beta shouldn&#39;t be outright ignored when they suggest something to be changed, but it doesn&#39;t mean the beta should be taking control over of the story and turning it into their idea of what should be happening either. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been through that song and dance before, and nobody came out of it well. A beta, in my book, should really be more of an editor than a glorified spell-checker; they should discuss the themes of the work with the person they&#39;re betaing and only seek to change them if they&#39;re really not working.<br><br>I don&#39;t do that.<br><br>I don&#39;t do that because it&#39;s too much like hard work. I don&#39;t do that because I&#39;m lazy. I don&#39;t do that because nine days out of ten I can barely muster an emotional response to what I&#39;m reading and the tenth I&#39;m trying to think through tar. I am a horrible beta and I cover for it by making jokes and cracking wise at the fic&#39;s expense, because even when I can&#39;t do what&#39;s asked of me I can at least do that.<br><br>I urge anyone being a beta, and everyone having their work betaed: take this on board. Think more deeply about your work. I know Iximaz and Skarmory churn out missions like nobody&#39;s business, but it&#39;s not a competition. Your agents are overworked semi-professional exterminators held together by spit and baling wire; you guys aren&#39;t. Take a step back, breathe, and wait for everything to come in. It can only help the process.<br><br>And for the love of God, don&#39;t be me, but you probably knew that already. =]</p>
