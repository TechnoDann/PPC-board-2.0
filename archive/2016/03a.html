            <p>One of my classes at UNC Charlotte is on the history of Tokyo, and we get to travel to the city and stay there through spring break, March 4 to March 14.<br><br>Besides being a RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME opportunity I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t mention earlier, I&#39;m bringing this up to let you guys know that I won&#39;t be able to visit the Board or work on missions/beta-reading stuff much over those ten days. I&#39;m planning to buy a Japanese SIM card so I don&#39;t go <i>completely</i> off the grid, but I&#39;m also working on the assumption that said SIM card has a strict data limit. So, limited contact.<br><br>Also, spending the entire trip with my nose stuck to my phone and/or iPod is both really rude and really pointless. :P</p>

            <p>Two out of three known Balrog deaths come from falling from a great height.

Morgoth was imprisoned in his body by the touch of the Silmarils; Sauron by repeatedly losing his body was rendered unable to put on a fair form. It&#39;s unclear which of Morgoth&#39;s servants were Maiar, but neither dragons, werewolves, nor orcs have ever been implied to change form.<br><br>Balrogs are <i>certainly</i> Maiar, but based on Tolkien&#39;s themes, it&#39;s unlikely they would be able to shapeshift.

            <p>A whole dragon fit in the Lonely Mountain, after all. A Balrog would have no trouble.<br><br>Anyway, Tolkien&#39;s exact words in &quot;The Bridge of Khazad-Dûm&quot; are as follows:<br><br><i>[I]t was like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater; and a power and terror seemed to be in it and to go before it.</i><br><br>Seems to imply that they&#39;re bigger than Men, but not colossal. It also seems like they do have a solid form, but also that there&#39;s more to them than that.<br><br><i>Then with a rush it leaped across the fissure. The flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed about it; and a black smoke swirled in the air. Its streaming mane kindled, and blazed behind it.</i><br><br>So they aren&#39;t always fiery.

Many people will do these things eventually, but not everyone, and not all the time.<br><br>Gold is the top level, so it&#39;s for rare things that not everyone is going to get: talking about badges and badges for badges, posting on the hour, suggesting ships in the Shipfic Fest. The sun badge throws a big of a wrench into this theory, but then I&#39;m still not 100% certain what it means. Maybe it&#39;s for posting multiple days in a row?<br><br>The black ones are unique to this system, but the wiki has no way of knowing what&#39;s been done at you. I don&#39;t know exactly where they fall in the scale. Maybe they&#39;re outside of it, since they&#39;re basically a separate category.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s always fun to see the occasional goodfic analysis.<br><br>The One Stop Plot Shop is interesting. Are they a group within the PPC, or a separate element of the Canon Protection Initiative? Anyway, I liked the Interpretation, and how it seems each character interprets the thing itself as something different. It&#39;s a fun way to show something about who they are.<br><br>Now, I&#39;ve dug through my old badfic bookmarks, and I&#39;ve found one I think you might like:<br><br><b>Fic:</b> <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5641186/2/Bella-In-Black">&quot;Bella in Black&quot;</a><br><br><b>Continua:</b> <i>Men in Black</i> x <i>Twilight</i><br><br><b>Description:</b> Bella is a member of the MiB for some reason. They deal with vampires now. J leaves because reasons; Jacob Black takes his place as &quot;the new J.&quot; They&#39;re sent to Forks to investigate the Cullens, or maybe protect them, or something. Naturally, Bella falls for Edward and blah blah blah.<br><br><b>Type of Badfic:</b> Crossover<br><br><b>Plot Holes/Offenses Against Canon:</b> The writing is wooden and soulless with plenty of typos, and the chapters are generally underdeveloped—the shortest, Chapter 8, is just four lines long and it&#39;s recapped in the following chapter, making it redundant to boot.<br><br>Bella and Edward manage to be even more annoying than they are in canon. They fall in love instantly, with absolutely zero interaction. Bella in particular gets away with openly flaunting the rules of the MiB, culminating in this little gem of a scene in Chapter 12:<br><br><span>I slipped my glasses on my head so I could look him in the eye, &quot;What are you going to do, Boss?&quot; I asked, &quot;You going to fire me? Kill me? Take me off the case? You&#39;re not going to do anything. You know just as well as I do that you can&#39;t do anything. I&#39;m the best agent you have. You can&#39;t risk loosing me.&quot;<br><br>He stared at me and then he started to smile, &quot;I was wondering how long it would take,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;Till what?&quot; I asked.<br><br>&quot;Until you broke the last rule,&quot; he said, &quot;Telling off the boss. You&#39;re more than ready for this, Swan.&quot; Then he was gone.<br><br>Everyone was quiet for a second and then I ran after him. &quot;Boss!&quot; I yelled. He looked at me, &quot;How are you okay with me breaking the rules? You tell me not to break rules, and then you call me by my real name, tell me that breaking rules is okay, and walk out!&quot;<br><br>&quot;You are the best agent, Bella,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;ve waiting for you to finally stand up to me like that. You are ready. Now go back to your boyfriend.&quot; He laughed and got in his car.</span><br><br>Besides being stupid, I feel like it&#39;s ripping something off, too, but I can&#39;t think what. {= /<br><br>Then there&#39;s the horrible &quot;fight scene,&quot; if you can call it that, in Chapter 14. The story proceeds to ruin <i>Twilight</i> canon by having Bella turn into a vampire after being bitten by James, And They All Settle Down And Live Happily Ever After. *vomits*<br><br>Oh, and a minor plothole which is nevertheless annoying: the story makes a big deal over Edward not knowing Bella&#39;s real name, but in POV sections other than Bella&#39;s, the narrative uses her name before the characters learn it. Just sloppy.<br><br>It&#39;s a little over 6,000 words, but there&#39;s enough pointless drivel that I think it might slide? Plus, it&#39;s MiB, and we need more MiB missions.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

(It makes just as much sense in context.) The Sue, Princess Brynnalynn Natalia, is the heir to the throne and her soulmate is none other than an aged-up Peter.<br><br><b>Department:</b> Mary Sues and/or DOGA.<br><br><b>Offenses against canon:</b> Aside from the additional country and the soulmate crap, apparently the &#39;no aging&#39; bit about Neverland has been mucked with for absolutely no reason other than to make Peter older. The Sue has telekinesis and precognition, possibly other powers as well. Pegasi suddenly exist in Neverland. Tiger Lily gets demoted to a groveling BFF. Possibly others, had to stop reading because of a lack of Bleep.</p>

Are you saying that Zeb brushed some fur off the bed sheets and then set the bed sheets down? Where have they been before he set them down? Is there a figure of speech I’m not aware of? My wild guess is that you wanted to say that Zeb put the books he was carrying down on the bed, and somehow lost a part of the sentence.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>(Eleven pages is short, right? :D)<br><br>Anyway, that meant I could actually read it. I don&#39;t have a lot to say, I&#39;m afraid; I snerked at &#39;NeverLAN&#39;, and thought the idea of piggybacking Hook&#39;s plan was a nifty one (on your part, for storytelling, specifically; it didn&#39;t seem to gain the agents much).<br><br>I&#39;m a little bit confused as to how the Suvian died? Did they leave her to drown, and if so, how did they know someone wouldn&#39;t come and rescue her? Heck, even Hook was after her, he could&#39;ve plucked her off the rock to use in his dastardly schemes.

            <p>I know it is unusual to give gifts to other people on one&#39;s own birthday, but this seemed a good time.  You see, I received a book of deathtraps earlier, and there&#39;s a chapter about using the future as a deathtrap.  <br><br>Weird, right?  How is the future a deathtrap?  And then it occurred to me: &quot;<a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/phobos/#ct">Catastrophe Theory</a>&quot;, my personal future-verse in the PPC, is totally a deathtrap!  And that got me thinking...<br><br>Why should it be my own personal future-verse?  Why not open it up for other people to write in?  And that, my friends, brings me to the gift:<br><br>Catastrophe Theory is open for business!  Death for some; fun for all!<br><br>Want to write about your agents fighting the good fight against impossible odds?  Want to explore what it would mean to one or more of your characters to experience the (non-canon) loss of one or more loved one?  Want your characters to go down in a blaze of glory?  Then this is the opportunity for you...on a couple of conditions.<br><br>This will be a curated series.  That means I will be involved in a couple of ways in your writing process.  Here&#39;s how:<br><br>1) In order to keep all writers, stories, and hidden details working together coherently, you and I will discuss your ideas before you start writing.<br><br>2) I&#39;m gonna need to be one of your betas.  This will allow me to say things like &quot;you mention Agent X died in the Cafeteria, but I had them in the library with the candlestick.&quot;  Again, so that all stories work together.<br><br>3) I may give you secret information to add in to your stories so you can be in on the mystery of what all went down.<br><br><br>So, if you solemnly swear that you&#39;re up to no good, shoot me an email (available via my name at the top) and we&#39;ll talk.<br><br>Also, check out some helpful links:<br><br><a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/phobos/#ct">The Catastrophe Theory Series</a><br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15jQdVTpNkn6QUmAbRuQnYzcYyYDLKQa2KiCk42z82Yw/edit?usp=sharing">The Lists</a> - the known fates of every character we know the fate of...and a few we don&#39;t yet.<br><br>-Phobos, giver of gifts</p>

            <p>We know that Henry Robinson is a teenager when the Department falls, and he&#39;s on a fixed timeline, so the absolute latest year it can happen is 2028 (if I&#39;ve done the math right).<br><br>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s older than 17 as written, though, so it&#39;s probably more like 2026 at latest.<br><br>...

            <p>Hello, and welcome aBoard! For your newbie gift, take this plate of freshly-made SPaGhetti!<br><br>If you haven&#39;t yet read them, may I point you towards <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/">the Original Series</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">the Constitution</a>? They&#39;re pretty much the only required reading around these parts. Another useful resource you might use is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki&lt;br%20/&gt;">the Wiki</a>; if you have any questions, just look here before asking. We like it when newbies do the research. ;)<br><br>Hope you like it here!</p>

            <p>The Unclaimed and Claimed Badfic lists need some cleaning up again. If you have any claims from August 2014 or before and the fics are still around, and you still want to kill them, <b>please renew your claim!</b> This&#39;ll be the same deal as my cleanup last year: moving stuff to the Unclaimed List if needed and getting rid of old and/or deleted entries on Unclaimed.<br><br>The cleanup starts tomorrow at noon EST.

            <p>That only took as long as it did because shopping, homework, and family stuff. (Dinner w/grandparents, my brother came home.)<br><br>Summary of Changes:<br>1. Removed most of the old or undated entries on Unclaimed Badfic. I think I just cut the page&#39;s length in half. Holy crap.<br>2. &quot;Reestablished&quot; some undated entries on Unclaimed, including &quot;The mistakes we made&quot; since there&#39;s still an Intelligence Report posted for it and all three How to Train Your Dragon fics. <br>2. Among many other moves, returned Phobos&#39; and Rosie Azrael&#39;s claims, and renewed Scapegrace&#39;s. DawnFire&#39;s were not eligible for bumping back to unclaimed. (Also renewed SkarmorySilver&#39;s claim on &quot;Sweet Apple Massacre&quot;.)<br>3. Removed deleted entries from both lists. Note: I think the adultfanfiction.net server is down.<br>4. Claimed one fic, &quot;Eve&#39;s jorney&quot; in LOTR. This fool is MINE. *snarl*<br><br>Anything I missed will be taken care of after I get back from spring break. Also, something went very wrong with the formatting on the Claimed Badfic page; can somebody who&#39;s not about to jet across the Atlantic fix that, please? Thanks.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s list our ships!<br><br>This is <b>not</b> the thread for writing stories. That&#39;ll be a little later. This is a thread of pure madness wherein we list the pairings (and more-ings) we ship in the PPC community. And then the list will be used to kick-start the main Shipfest, because it&#39;s actually made things dramatically more fun for the last two years. (Weird, right? I do something and it <b>works</b>?)<br><br>Da Rules:<br><br>-List your PPC Community ships - people in the PPC community (not organisation) that you totally think are/should be together.<br>-Give reasons for your ships. Otherwise it&#39;s just a random name generator.<br>-Revenge shipping is perfectly okay!<br>-Shipping someone with yourself - if you&#39;re not actually in a relationship - is a bit creepy; <b>please don&#39;t do it</b>.<br>-No stories. This is just a list. Stories is a later thread. (If you want to say whether you&#39;re willing to have stories written <i>about</i> you, go ahead; people can get a head-start on the writing-but-not-posting that way.)<br>-Have fun! It&#39;s a ludicrous exercise in ridiculousness, after all.<br><br>If you have a vehement objection to being even mentioned in a ship name, speak up, and people won&#39;t do it; it&#39;s as simple as that. And again - when the main Shipfest thread comes round, no-one will write stories with you in them unless you specifically give consent.<br><br>So... let the shipping commence!<br><br>hS<br><br>(I&#39;ll give my ships in a reply, so as not to clutter things up here.)</p>

            <p>Trying something new moderately inspired by Huinesoron&#39;s Wednesday plugs, here&#39;s a throwback to some older spin-offs.<br><br>Architeuthis&#39; spin-off was one of the earlier spin-offs from waaaay back when TOS was going on, and still holds up awesomely today. Unlike most spin-offs and missions, hers is set in one of the supporting departments- Intelligence!<br>    <br>They&#39;re fun to read, give more background to the PPC, and definitely stand out even now because of a stronger focus on what makes a fic PPC-worthy, which makes sense, considering that the Department of Intelligence decides what fics get sent to the Action Departments in the first place.<br> <br>That said, the one I&#39;m linking features Architeuthis <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/architeuthis/mission03.html">investigating a fic that turns out against the usual expectations</a>.<br><br>This is still one of my favorites, and I&#39;ve read quite a few missions.<br>    <br>I&#39;m still looking for next week&#39;s Throwback Thursday Plug, so if you have any suggestions for a mission to feature, write up a similar blurb and email it over! <br><br>That said, a few limitations: The spin-off the mission is from shouldn&#39;t be newer than 2013, and the writer shouldn&#39;t be someone who&#39;s currently active on the board! If it&#39;s someone who checks in every blue moon or you still know off the board, it&#39;s fine, but it shouldn&#39;t be someone who&#39;s still around, even if they haven&#39;t written for a long time. <br>  <br>-July</p>

            <p>I mean, yes, it&#39;s interesting to see an Intelligence operative on a mission to a fic that&#39;s not quite bad enough to send in the ol&#39; jackbooted legions of fangirl oppression, but other than that? There&#39;s not much to say. It&#39;s a fanfic review framed as someone bimbling around Hobbiton and following the action of the object of review.<br><br>Then again, that&#39;s basically what <i>every</i> PPC mission is, if you want to be unpleasantly sarcastic about it. =]<br><br>Still, it was an interesting diversion and didn&#39;t outstay its welcome.

            <p>I know I read through Architeuthis&#39; spinoff at some point in the past, but unfortunately it escaped my memory. Thank you for bringing it to my attention once again. My reading list expands once again!<br><br>I&#39;m seconding Huinesoron on both the world-building and Architeuthis&#39; way of worming into the world. Having to build a cover and integrate yourself really helps distinguish spies as being their own beasts, and not just slightly sneakier and less violent DMS agents. I also wanted to bring up the use of first-person perspective. I so rarely see it in the PPC, and it works really well here (especially with the overall lack of agent interaction once the story makes it to the fic).</p>

            <p>That&#39;s why I occasionally write Intelligence reports myself - I love the format she came up with, and it&#39;s very different to what we usually see.<br><br>This mission in particular is a good one to reread for its worldbuilding. So Alice is telepathic because of nanobots? And she&#39;s a &#39;floater&#39; (remember, this was way before the Department of Floaters was concieved)? I knew none of this!<br><br>One thing I particularly like is that Architeuthis doesn&#39;t just wander around spying on things. She has to give herself a cover, and slot into a world that can actually still see her. I&#39;m not sure how to square that with the PPC standard of canon-cloaking, but it makes for an interesting read (even if she doesn&#39;t mention it very much).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Like the fact that Intelligence goes about things slightly differently- since they&#39;re observing and aren&#39;t going <i>after</i> Sues or wraiths or what have you, they don&#39;t really need that cloaking, and they shouldn&#39;t- they&#39;re there to investigate the fic, which sometimes requires them to poke into and interact with things that action agents wouldn&#39;t need to do, to get a better idea of what&#39;s going on.<br><br>-July, musing</p>

            <p><b>HELLOOOOOO,</b> and welcome back to the second annual PPC Pokémon Tournament!<br><br>Well, not quite.<br><br>Like last year, the tournamet will be officially starting in April; however, seeing as it is now March, I want to give all trainers the opportunity to begin planning their teams! <br><br>(For those of you who were not with us last year, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Pok%C3%A9mon_Tournament">have a Wiki link.</a>)<br><br>Since, as far as I know (though feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong), the Smogon Banned List has not changed since last year, we&#39;ll be using the same banned list as before, which can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kRuYrnd5ibQVaMeykfyCvkeXW0mr3jV4X49dkyhfD0c/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Rules and such will similarly remain the same, and can also be found at that last link.<br><br>HOWEVER!<br><br>This year, there is a catch.<br><br>Teams this year will be Monotype, to truly test how well trainers fare in the face of an unfavorable type matchup. How well-prepared are you to counter your weaknesses? <br><br>I myself will be using the Psychic type, but don&#39;t think that because one Trainer has claimed a type you can&#39;t use it as well. After all, there are only so many types to go around.<br><br>Pokémon on your Monotype teams are allowed to be dual typed as long as one of their types belongs to the typing you choose. (For example, if you chose Fire, then Infernape would be acceptable.)<br><br>You have until the last week in March to finalize your teams! The official cutoff point is Thursday, March 31. Once that is over, I&#39;ll draw up a randomized bracket and we&#39;ll go from there.<br><br>Good luck!</p>

            <p>From a competitive standpoint, Mega Charizard Y has some distinct advantages on a mono Fire team. Drought works really well as a way of boosting your damage output and means you have have good options against Water teams in the form of Solar Beam. By contrast, Mega Camerupt is much slower but hits like a speeding bus despite lacking the boost from sun - which you can get anyway because Ninetales is a thing. M-Cam&#39;s ability, Sheer Force, means that moves with a secondary effect do 33% more damage but don&#39;t trigger the effect - which means that its dual STAB of Fire and Ground can do hilarious amounts of damage. It also has the advantage of not immediately losing half its health to Stealth Rock upon switching in.<br><br><i>Aesthetically</i>, on the other hand, it&#39;s like this. Mega Charizard Y is just Charizard but bigger. Mega Camerupt is LITERALLY A FLUFFY CAMEL WITH A VOLCANO GROWING OUT OF IT. IT IS THE MOST CUTE. DO IT NAO.</p>

            <p>Its gimmick is that it can set up weather without wasting a moveslot on Sunny Day - thus freeing up a slot for, say, more coverage or Protect or something.

            <p>To the anime fans here, do you ever listen to english fandubs of some openings or endings from animes, and if yes, what are the ones you prefer?<br><br>I&#39;ll open the subject with three of my own, done by AmaLee:<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCJdbCVuAO8">Rising Hope</a>, Opening 1 for The Irregular at Magic High School<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qLJWh1eY_c">Ignite</a>, Opening 1 for Sword Art Online II<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2Chwj5JEww">Magia</a>, Ending 1 for Madoka Magica<br><br>Of course, if you think that fandub is heresy, you can also point out original openings/endings</p>

            <p>And it is almost scary how the lyrics fit for Rebellion despite the fact that that trainrewck didn&#39;t exist when the fandub was made.<br><br>I personally like Miku-tan&#39;s dubs of both opening and endings of PMMM, too.</p>

            <p>But I had actually thought that a duet version would work when I listened to Miku-Tan&#39;s rendition, so I&#39;m happy it does actually exist.<br><br>I initially found the voice of the Madoka singer a bit annoying, but then again... if Mata Ashita, Madoka&#39;s character song, is anything to go by, she does indeed have that kind of voice when singing.

            <p>I listen fandubs because I&#39;m curious about the way te author plays with the original lyrics, trying to keep a song with same rythm and similar message...

            <p>Kelly&#39;s intriguing. Maybe it&#39;s your editing, but to me she doesn&#39;t seem so much snobbish as painfully bored. I don&#39;t think she needs to be taken down a notch; she needs something exciting to happen. And you&#39;ve already got the beginning of something exciting: the paper carnations. They look innocuous (secret admirer flowers! How cute!), but they could easily signal something much more sinister. Or they could be sweet secret admirer flowers. Either way, I&#39;m intrigued. <br><br>Oh, I have negative feedback too. Her reaction to the Harry Potter fic was confusing. Did reading it make her happy? Was she irritated by it? Was she slightly-less-bored by it? I couldn&#39;t really tell. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m thinking that I should put Kelly with someone who could take her down a peg, maybe.  Or just figure out why she&#39;s such a sourpuss.<br><br>As far as enjoyable to write...

            <p>The thing about characters who need to be/get taken down a peg or two is that they&#39;re great as <i>secondary</i> characters. Watching that happen from the outside is good. But writing a convincing protagonist who starts off haughty and gets knocked down into something more humble? Very difficult, and quite likely to put people off your character before you get to the change.<br><br>The muppet thing: what comes across from her is &#39;he is so stupid, but I will say nothing because I am better than that&#39;, and definitely not anything like &#39;I guess he knows best&#39;. Which... y&#39;know, isn&#39;t a likeable person.<br><br>Jumping out of order a bit: it&#39;s not about what her final decision was, I&#39;ve got no opinion on that. The issue I have is with her thought process, which (from memory) went:<br><br>-&quot;This Harry is better than the original, maybe I should leave it.&quot;<br><br>-&quot;But it would be funny to have the agents hit him, so maybe I should send them in.&quot;<br><br>-&quot;There isn&#39;t enough material, so I&#39;ll leave it.&quot;<br><br>The third decision is the only one she should be making. Yes, it&#39;s what she settled on - but she considered going with either of the other two, and those are emphatically <i>not</i> her job.<br><br>If you order a salad in a restaurant, and after you eat your server comes to you and says, &quot;I thought about bringing you a steak instead because I figured it&#39;d be nicer, but in the end I decided not to,&quot; that server would not be doing their job. That&#39;s what Kelly did here.<br><br>The characterisation of Harry is an extension of the same issue. It&#39;s fine that she doesn&#39;t like him - but she goes on about it so strongly that it feels like &#39;and neither should anyone else, the idiots&#39;. Which, again, not a likeable character.<br><br>There is nothing here which makes her inconsistent. But she&#39;s a perfectly consistent and utterly unlikeable person who is going to be fired before too long.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Yeah, it&#39;s a difficult balance to strike. However, I&#39;d almost say you don&#39;t go far enough. The Notary&#39;s an awful, horrendous, totally insufferable prig - but it&#39;s the extent of those qualities, pushing her almost to the point of villain protagonist status, that makes her compelling. Kelly, by contrast, just comes off as a self-absorbed pub bore with delusions of grandeur.

            <p>Posting on this Board makes you officially a fully acknowledged member of the PPC Community (unless you are banned for grave misdemeanor, which, to my experience, happens approximately once per year).

            <p>It&#39;s a fantastic line.

It halves the holder&#39;s Defence and Special Defence stats, which means that you have a hard time staying in. On the other hand, Mienshao&#39;s defences are pretty ropey anyway, so it&#39;s not that big of a deal. You&#39;ll want to go all in on the damage build, with Reckless as your ability, but I&#39;d recommend a Jolly nature to maximize your speed since you will not be taking hits. From there, you want High Jump Kick, U-Turn, Knock Off, and Stone Edge, with EVs in Attack and Speed. Finally, just remember to have fun. =]</p>

            <p>The PPC only deals with fanfiction. For fanfiction, you need canon as a yardstick. Since Garry&#39;s Mod has no canon per se, the PPC has nothing to do with it.<br>Also, it&#39;s kinda... hard to spork bad mods when your sporking medium is text. It doesn&#39;t translate well, either way.</p>

            <p>Sorry for snapping at you. Transphobia&#39;s (understandably) kind of a touchy subject for me, and it does bring down the red mist on occasion. I&#39;m sorry if it upset you at all, and for my vehemence.

            <p>To be honest, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything to forgive; your response was completely natural, and directed at the comics, not me.

I&#39;m also sorry I&#39;ve upset you, and I hope you&#39;ll forgive me. <br><br>And, that comment-- eccentricity versus alarm? You brought tears to my eyes.

            <p>*gingerly poking in head* Er, hello there, PPC! The name is Ivy Matilda Blue - actually, it&#39;s not - and the address is Earth.<br>Let&#39;s clear some things up. I am tenured in the Department of Paranoia, and combined with the fact that my name isn&#39;t very common, I&#39;ve been using the pen name &#39;Ivy&#39; for about a year. I will also gladly answer to &#39;Matilda&#39; (or any variation of that name). <br>I&#39;m in the midst of reading the original series, and then got a bit too excited, so I decided to say hello. I&#39;ve read a lot of the wikia here, because I am a huge nerd and proud of it. <br>I found the PPC while scouring the Internet for Mary Sue tests. I stumbled across Alexis Gilmore and the mission &quot;Get That Thing Called Beauty Out of the Detective&#39;s Eyes.&quot; <br>It was marvellous. <br>I&#39;ve read just about every Sue-slaying piece of literature from the Sherlock fandom, and I&#39;ve been hooked on works of the PPC ever since. <br>My favourite agents are Eledhwen Elerossiel and Christianne Shieh, partly because they were the stars of the first mission I&#39;d ever read, and also because they&#39;re hilarious. (Rina Dives and Randa Unsure-Of-Last-Name are also fabulous.) <br>My list of fandoms would probably come close to crashing the Internet. Keeping it brief, I&#39;d like to note that I enjoy Sherlock, Doctor Who, and Legend by Marie Lu, as well as many others. <br>In addition to being a voracious reader, I am a musician, an athlete, a student, an actress, and occasionally a good person. <br>Well, here goes!</p>

When the holder goes down to 50% Health, it randomly raises 2 of their stats by +2. Since it can only be used once, you&#39;re never quite certain what you&#39;re gonna get. It can really help on Porygon2, but you have to understand you&#39;re giving up a lot in terms of recovery and defence. Try an offensive set with a Modest Nature, EVs in Special Attack and Speed, the ability Download, and the moves Recover, Tri Attack, Thunderbolt, and Ice Beam. If you can tank a hit, you can get a boost out of it, but no promises as to its utility. Finally, remember to have fun! =]</p>

It&#39;s also quite fun, though it&#39;s a somewhat different format from PPC missions--primarily because, as I recall, it&#39;s much closer to the formatting style of a sporking comm like Deleterius than anything else. I think you might enjoy it, though.<br><br>Also, wow, musician and actress! What do you play? What sort of acting do you do? What&#39;s your favorite type of music?

            <p>If you were on Livejournal back when Livejournal was a thing, you might remember thesurrealist.co.uk&#39;s <a href="http://thesurrealist.co.uk/dungeon.php">LiveJournal Dungeon Adventure</a> (and the related <a href="http://thesurrealist.co.uk/space">LiveJournal Space Adventure</a>). It&#39;s basically a procedurally-generated text adventure which creates monsters, items, and scenery from your LJ friends and interests.<br><br>I have long thought that the PPC Board would be a brilliant source for a similar dungeon, but that would be virtually impossible to do, right?<br><br>Right?<br><br>Mmmmnope. Do not underestimate the insanity of a hS.<br><br><a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/BoardDungeon.htm">The Dungeon of the Board</a><br><br>There are differences to the LJ Dungeon. The key one is that you have to copy/paste the text of the Board into the text box to give the game its information. There&#39;s helpful images to show you where, but it&#39;s actually just about robust enough to handle &#39;Ctrl-A, Crtl-C&#39;.<br><br>Random comments:<br><br>-There is no save function, but if you paste the same input in, you&#39;ll get the same output.<br>-You have no inventory other than the items you&#39;re using, but will get a description of whether a new weapon or armour is better/worse.<br>-There is no map. &gt;:D I suggest a piece of paper. Oh yes, we&#39;re going <i>old-school</i>.<br>-Monster levels and weapon/armour strength are both based on how many posts the user named has. So if you pick up a weapon of Iximaz, it&#39;ll probably be pretty strong. ;) Watch out for username typos, though - a sword of desdendelle is a very different matter to one of Desdendelle.<br>-The dungeon has been tested on Chrome, IE, and a Nokia phone with Opera Mini browser. There&#39;s a &#39;Mobile Mode&#39; which aligns the table into a vertical column, and pre-pasted text in case you have no copy function.<br>-You may see certain very old Boarders creeping into your maze. I&#39;d be wary of them if I were you.<br><br>I really hope people enjoy this. It took quite a lot of code-wrangling to get it to work, and being based on something from a decade or more ago, it has quite a bit of nostalgia value for me, too. Comments are very welcome (and bug reports especially so!); if people like it enough, I might see about adding a Sci-Fi version to go with it.<br><br>hS, probably a level 73(!!!) Hobbit on the current front page</p>

            <p>There are now <b>two themes</b>. You can choose whether to &#39;Generate Dungeon&#39; or &#39;Generate Space-Station&#39;.<br><br>The space station is mostly just a reskin, though there are some differences - some <s>idol powers</s> add-ons obtained from weapons lockers are changed. The generation seed is also tweaked, so the dungeon and station for a given text will not be identical.<br><br>I hope people enjoy playing about with this; it&#39;s been a lot of work putting the whole thing together, and a lot of testing to get the sci-fi theme working right.<br><br>Thanks everyone for the positive reaction so far.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>And attempts to clear a single dungeon after repeatedly wiping to various monsters!<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ny30sAZ.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/ny30sAZ.jpg"> <br><br>My original map with scratches and mistakes.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/t4pyU0g.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/t4pyU0g.jpg"> <br><br>The cleaner looking map with interest points circled.<br><br>I = Idol<br>W = Weapon<br>+ = adds health<br>- = takes away health<br>X = dead end<br>The little dashes between rooms show doorways, and the numbers indicate the level of the monster. <br>Dot with arrow = one-way teleport.<br><br>For anyone who&#39;s interested in giving it a go, I copied the PPC Pokémon Tournament thread twice as my generator.<br><br>The way I went through always started the same frustrating way: Head west, then south to pick up my first weapon, return north, kill doctorlit the level 2 dragon, then go west to kill (or be repeatedly killed by, depending on the RNG&#39;s mood) foofooman3 the level 6 farmer. Ironically, my brother was the second-hardest thing to fight in the entire dungeon because of his roadblock nature; he must&#39;ve killed me about thirty times from whenever I&#39;d be forced to restart.<br><br>Once that was done, though, it was head west, ignore Irrelevant the level 4 imp in favor of praying at the Idol of Sedri (which granted an attack bonus in the form of curare), before going on to slay Larfen J. Stocke, esq. the level 2 land squid and proceeding on my merry way to what I discovered to be my best find ever: the idol of Leto Haven. This thing granted me the ability Vulgar Tongues, which allowed me to communicate with dungeon monsters. And boy, did I put this to good use. <br><br>I found it was consistent which monsters could and could not be reasoned with, so I put together a complete list:<br><br>JulyFlame the Jester (level 2)<br>Irrelevant the Imp (4)<br>SkarmorySilver the Serpent of Cruelty (6)<br>SeaTurtle the Serpent of Cruelty (6)<br>Voyd the Vampire Watermelon (8)<br>DCCCV the Dragon (8)<br>Araeph the Archangel (10)<br>NenyaQuende the Normal Person (10)<br>Desdendelle the Dragon (16)<br>Hardric the Hobbit (18)<br>Huinesoron the Hobbit (32)<br>Iximaz the Imp (33)<br><br>Every other monster encountered had to be fought; for those I would make a return trip to the Idol of Sedri for the poison buff.<br><br>Anyway, the only weapon worth mentioning is the Sword of Thalia Weaver, located to the west of the Idol of Sedri. It was the best of all the weapons I found--which, unfortunately, isn&#39;t saying much. Still, an upgrade is an upgrade.<br><br>The Fountain of Doc Filth (+5 to health whenever drank from), though a little out of the way at the kinda-sorta-not-quite-bottom-left, was an absolute blessing while derping around in the dungeon. Get hurt? Just go back and heal up! I had to use it quite a bit while fighting the two level 12s in the dungeon—I had to chip away at their health, run, heal, come back, and repeat until they died. Which took forever, especially since I died to both of them several times. (Darn you, Mattman the Comet and the other Boarder who I unfortunately can&#39;t remember now!)<br><br>I was feeling pretty good about clearing the full dungeon when I ran into this:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZcWmCSM.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/ZcWmCSM.png"> <br><br>And now I&#39;ll never know what the last four rooms of the dungeon were and I&#39;m sad. At least I got an interesting puzzle out of it in the meanwhile.</p>

            <p>Ouch - no armour at all? That&#39;s a seriously handicapped dungeon. I am delighted that you drew maps. ^_^ There&#39;s several of the blighters scattered about my desk, so I know bot useful and tiresome they can be.<br><br>I think I&#39;ve figured out why you had such good luck with Vulgar Tongues, by the way: it&#39;s because you doubled up the input. That means most monsters came out with an even-numbered level. The calculation divides the level by the accuracy (from 1-6), and then lets you commune if the first digit after the decimal is zero... yeah, 1 or 2 will always work if your level is even, and there&#39;s a good chance of 4 or 6 working too.<br><br>I am also very pleased someone found a Curare idol. I&#39;ve not run into one, and I was worried they weren&#39;t appearing.<br><br>Just a shame you lost, really. :-/<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>On his <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277584;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">flight</a> from Baron Thanasius Ampelius&#39;s <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277412;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">wrath</a>, Hieronymus <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Hieronymus">the hermit</a> found himself standing on the ceiling of a broom cupboard, as he often appears in unlikely places at unexpected times. He heard an eldrich voice whispering, &#39;Which might explain your disrespect&#39;. Startled, Hieronymus looked around and noticed three archways leading from the high-ceiled chamber to other places. From the southern exit, Voyd the Level 14 Vampire Watermelon glared at him. <br><br>Voyd bared its fangs, and Hieronymus turned around and fled into a maze of twisty passages, all alike, where he easily might have been eaten by a grue. &#39;It... that... what?&#39; called Hieronymus out; then he stopped and wondered why he had so inexplicably done this. Finally, he found the exit that led to the East, and stepped through...<br><br>…to enter a maze of twisty passages, all alike, where he easily might have been eaten by a grue. Here, however, a strange carving on the wall read in ancient letters, &#39;Indeed not&#39;. Silently wondering what a grue might even look like, the hermit explored the maze and found exits leading to all cardinal points, but the eastern exit was blocked by Desdendelle the Level 42 Dragon. He also found a tightly-rolled scroll that had been hidden in a corner. On reading out the text, &#39;The Shipfest cares little for orientation&#39;, Hieronymus felt a surge of wellbeing. Blinking letters appeared in mid-air, telling that his health had just increased by two to twelve.<br><br>Since he looked this direction anyway, the hermit went northward into a darkened sitting room. For some reason, the only sofa had been turned upside-down. Above it, a helmet floated mysteriously in the air, engulfed in flames. Another eldritch voice – <i>or may it be the same as before</i>, thought Hieronymus – whispered, &#39;Cat-on-the-Keyboard/Data Junkie: computers ship&#39;. Seeing that there was no exit in front of him, and that Phobos the Level 31 Piranha lured to the right, Hieronymus grabbed the Helmet of JulyFlame, surprisingly not burning his fingers at all, and turned left. <br><br>Behind this archway lay a sunlit open courtyard. On a pedestal sat a coffee mug with a label reading, &#39;I know heaps&#39;. The silence was broken by a sudden scream of, &#39;Aipom can work&#39;. Hieronymus picked up the coffee mug and downed it. He felt a surge of wellbeing, but not as strong as from reading the scroll.<br> <br>Against a door in the opposite wall of the courtyard leant TheShyIon, a Level 1 Troubadour. Seeing that there was no other way, Hieronymus went straight forward and punched her with his bare hands. &#39;This punch is super effective!&#39; exclaimed a loud, annoying voice. &#39;You hit TheShyIon for 4 damage! You have slain TheShyIon the Troubadour! You gain 1 gold!&#39;  <br><br>Stepping over the limp body<sup>*)</sup>, Hieronymus entered a well-lit sitting room. There was a strange carving on the wall. In ancient letters, it read, &#39;Don’t feel like this&#39;. The Wand of Tomash leant against another wall. Since this was apparently a dead end, Hieronymus picked up the wand, turned around and walked straight back through the courtyard to the darkened sitting room. Phobos grinned at him from the pool in the next chamber, but Hieronymus turned right and walked into the central maze again. There he picked up the tightly-rolled scroll and read out the text, &#39;The Shipfest cares little for orientation&#39;. Slightly surprised, he felt another surge of wellbeing, and blinking letters told  that his health had just increased to fifteen. <br><br>Hieronymus wondered briefly whether he should go back and try to drink from the coffee mug twice, too, but considering that there were still unexplored places, he rather wiggled his way back through the adjacent mazes, turned left into the chamber with the broom cupboard, and then, ignoring the glaring Vampire Watermelon, right into a darkened sitting room. In the dim light that fell through the archways from adjacent rooms, the only sofa was barely visible, but Hieronymus could still see that it had been turned upside down. <i>May I have been gone in circles?</i> he thought. <i>Nah, that can&#39;t be. The other darkened sitting room didn&#39;t force me to inexplicably call out, &#39;And may his beard grow ever longer. XD Happy B-Day!&#39; And what&#39;s that thing hanging from that rope? And what&#39;s that over ther— Arrgh!</i>.<br><br>Realizing that Scapegrace, a Level 54 Serpent of Cruelty, dwelt beyond the room&#39;s only other exit, Hieronymus left the Atlatl of Huinesoron behind<sup>**)</sup> and retreated far back to the central maze. There, he got another look onto the scroll, and two more health points. Desdendelle the Dragon growled at him from the eastern passageway, but there was still one door left to the right. <br><br>Thus, Hieronymus entered another well-lit sitting room. This one&#39;s strange carving on the wall read, in ancient letters, &#39;Fallouts&#39;. There was also a sword somebody had abandoned there, and a dragon growling from the eastern passageway. Hieronymus examined the Sword of Elcalion, but found it weaker and less reliable than the Wand of Tomash, so he left it alone. Having run out of options, the hermit returned to the central maze and prepared for the inevitable, reading and re-reading the Scroll of Health until an annoyed voice told him, &#39;Your health is already full&#39;.        <br><br>Hieronymus stepped back into the well-lit sitting room and pointed his wand at DCCCV the  Level 11 Dragon. &#39;Sectumsempra!&#39; <br><br>&#39;You hit DCCCV for 6 damage!&#39; boomed the loud, annoying voice. &#39;DCCCV the Dragon has 27 health remaining.&#39;<br><br>The Dragon roared and breathed a firestorm.<br><br>&#39;DCCCV hits you for 22 damage! But your Helmet of JulyFlame takes 21 of the damage! You have 19 health remaining.&#39;<br><br><i>Nice,</i> thought Hieronymus. <i>Who would have expected that a flaming helmet is an efficient protection against fire. But I&#39;ll need a really strong spell to bring this dragon down.</i> He braced himself for the terrible blow he had to deliver and shouted, &#39;Avada Kedavra!&#39;<br><br>Alas, Hieronymus the hermit was never a hateful person, or maybe his aim was just too bad. <br><br>The dragon roared again. Fire met fire, and the loud, annoying voice boomed, &#39;DCCCV hits you for 12 damage! But your Helmet of JulyFlame takes all of the damage! You have 19 health remaining.&#39;<br><br>Hieronymus jogged his brain and remembered  the mightiest spell he had ever heard of. &#39;Expelliarmus!&#39; <br> <br>&#39;You hit DCCCV for 10 damage! DCCCV the Dragon has 17 health remaining.&#39;<br><br>And for the third time roared the dragon and breathed another firestorm, and the flaming helmet failed its trusting bearer, and then...<br><br><i>It&#39;s dark here. And cramped. I can&#39;t barely move. The floor is not flat. I can feel it rise smoothly on all sides, right up to the ceiling. There aren&#39;t any edges or corners, just this … globe? What the— did somebody put me into a pokéball?</i><br><br>HG, who apparently is a level 5<sup>***)</sup> dungeon crawler.<br><br><sup>*)</sup> I&#39;m so sorry, Shy.<br><sup>**)</sup> I guess that was a mistake; although less reliable than the Wand of Tomash, the Atlatl is (probably very much) stronger.<br><sup>***)</sup> Based on the front page about eight hours ago, before Huinesoron updated the game.</p>

            <p>While running through a dungeon generated by the shipfest thread, I came across a &quot;tightly rolled scroll&quot; that, when read, grants me 2 health.

I&#39;ll give it one more day and then I&#39;m out of here.<br><br>------<br><br>I&#39;m in a lot of pain after the fall.  I was looking for a place to set up camp and the jungle floor gave way underneath my feet.  I fell about 30 feet into a sitting room of some sort.  I really didn&#39;t expect couches in a jungle dungeon, but I sure was glad to find this one when I landed on it.  Someone has been here before, too.  They left weirdly precognitive graffiti on the wall.  It says. &quot;Well hello there!&quot;  Kind of creepy.  There&#39;s no climbing back up there, I guess I&#39;ll have to find another way.<br><br>-----<br><br>I came across the legendary Idol of Lonely Star.  It&#39;s situated on top of a tower in the middle of a cave; an odd arrangement.  Still, I thought it best to pay my respects with the traditional DawnFire/Pottery prayer.  I was rewarded with the power of Inferno.<br><br>-----<br><br>I found a holy relic today.  The Gauntlet of DawnFire was thought lost forever.  How it ended up in this jungle I may never know, but I feel that my earlier devotion was rewarded with some protection in this dangerous place.<br><br>-----<br><br>Got into a couple minor skirmishes.  I ran into an Elephant of Wrath, called Elcalion according to its collar, that was not much of a threat.  Later, a Troubadour named Tomash got in my way and wouldn&#39;t let me pass.  We fought, his music sucked, I won.<br><br>Those fights wiped me out.  I&#39;ve set up camp next to a fountain with a statue of the mythical hero Sergio Turbo.  I don&#39;t have a way to purify the water, but it looks clean and my canteen ran dry mid-yesterday.<br><br>-----<br><br>That was a mistake.  Never again.<br><br>-----<br><br>A dead-end today.  I walked into a rainy courtyard and over the sound of the rain I heard a scream.  &quot;The real question...&quot; and that&#39;s where it stopped.  What is the real question?  I need to know!<br><br>Time to backtrack.<br><br>-----<br><br>Another room full of comfortable furniture and graffiti.  This time they wrote &quot;Anything I currently have claimed is something I want to kee&quot;.  I didn&#39;t have to wonder why they never finished, though.  My fellow explorer looked freeze-dried on a pile of pillows.<br><br>I have to get out of here before the same happens to me.<br><br>-----<br><br>Another fight today.  Some gray-beard Hobbit threw mushrooms at me.  I was able to deflect them with the Gauntlet, but he was more of an annoyance than a real threat.  Seems he had a book with him.  I&#39;ll see what I can glean from that before I turn in for the night.<br><br>-----<br><br>The first page of the book said &quot;*points down* Cough Cough&quot;.  The next thing I know, I&#39;m falling through a magical portal.  I hate magical traps.  Now I&#39;m even more completely lost than I already was.  There&#39;s a shallow pool here that had a wand at the bottom of it.  The wand is inscribed with runes that I believe translate to &quot;Poor Cynic&quot;.  I have no idea what it means, but at least I can stop punching things.<br><br>-----<br><br>I&#39;ve really stepped in it now.  I should have realized this was a holy site from the artifacts I&#39;d seen so far.  I ran into an Archangel by the name of Alleb.  I tried to get some help from her, but she thought I was a thief because of the Gauntlet.  Gods help me, I had no choice but to fight her.<br><br>-----<br><br>Found another sitting room.  This one had been ransacked by someone or something.  There is graffiti reading &quot;Huinesoron/Shipfest&quot;.  A common prayer where I&#39;m from.<br><br>-----<br><br>Found another book.  I am not falling for that again.  I&#39;ll explore further and, if I have no other options, I&#39;ll come back and check this one.<br><br>-----<br><br>Sure.  I pass up that book only to fall victim to the exact same trap on a folded up piece of paper in the next room.  this one dropped me back at the Fountain of Sergio Turbo, which I have no desire to be near.  I think I can retrace my steps to the first book, if I need to, but I think there may be another path to explore.<br><br>-----<br><br>(The final entry is penned in a different hand.)<br><br><i>Foolish man.  He thought his magic wand and his Power of Inferno made him a match for the great Ice Mage Mattman the Comet.  Not even the Gauntlet of Dawnfire could save him from my wrath.  Take heed of his plight and leave my dungeon now, before you meet the same fate.</i><br><br><br>((Alas, poor Phobos.  He will be missed.  -Phobos))</p>

            <p>I rather enjoyed playing through the game.  I had a 3 page map of the place and a page of room/idol/item descriptions.  <br><br>I cut a few things (mostly low level fights) for time, but a lot of the reactions in the story are almost exactly how I felt while doing all of this.  This is especially true where teleport traps are concerned.  The screw up my map, and I don&#39;t like them.<br><br>-Phobos, who should have kept the Mage-Eye bonus from the Idol of Huinesoron</p>

            <p>Favorite moment: &quot;You are in a mouldering dungeon. Words work their way into your mind without involving your ears: &#39;We tried to warn you but oh dear!&#39;.&quot;<br><br>***<br>A funny thing happened one time when I was playing it. I kept coming across all these Level 1 monsters, and when I tried to attack them, all it said was &#39;There is nothing to attack.&quot; But they showed up as kills. So I&#39;m ambling along, right, with 9 Health, and then (like an idiot) I read a tightly-rolled scroll and lose 5 Health. . . which apparently kills me. Is there a nuance to the game I&#39;m missing, or is this a glitch?</p>

When someone says something you agree with or like, second it. When someone posts something they&#39;ve made, say what you liked about it or what could be improved. Welcome newbies with nonexistent gifts. <br><br>Things I would not do: Feel guilty about lurking.

            <p>I was reminiscing and I had a thought, people often times say how either a book or music or film, etc. was &quot;life changing&quot;.  So I figured I would poll the community and see if they had an example that was truly life changing.<br><br>If you do not wish to explain the circumstances of how it changed your life do not feel obligated to do so.  I am just curious to see what things come up if any do.<br><br>As for me, I can say that a single album. <i>The Black Parade</i> by My Chemical Romance was truly life changing for me.  Particularly the lead single, Welcome to the Black Parade.  Without that album and that song, I would not have made it through high school.  I do not feel like sharing any further details at this time.  <br><br>So I am curious as to what books/music/etc. any of you found life changing or even deeply moving.

            <p>Ah, as far as that goes, two things come into mind immediately. The Lord of the Rings was definitely one. It was my first real fandom, and one of the first times I have ever enjoyed the characters as characters. It led me into the world of fantasy, even though now I notice its shortcomings and plot holes (I mean literal ones, not PPC-verse ones). And then 1984. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever thought so much about a book.</p>

            <p><i>Mystery Science Theater 3000</i> was a big one. I discovered it right as it made the jump to the Sci-Fi channel in the late &#39;90s. Every Saturday morning I would get up and watch it, regardless whether it was a repeat or not. That show helped shape both my sense of humor and my outlook on life. I might not be here writing this right now if it weren&#39;t for <i>MST3K</i>.<br><br>I <b>definitely</b> wouldn&#39;t be here writing this right now if it weren&#39;t for Discworld. That series probably had the greatest effect on me, far more than <i>MST3K</i>. I was getting burned out on traditional high fantasy by the time I discovered my first Discworld novel. That showed me that there was more than one way to look at a setting that might otherwise seem played out; that humor had a place in the &quot;big&quot; genres; that characters were the lifeblood of a story. Pratchett reaffirmed my love for reading and planted the seed of what would become a love for writing. I will always be grateful for that.<br><br>Finally, I have to give a nod to <i>Baldur&#39;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn.</i> I honestly wasn&#39;t a huge gamer as a kid. I played a few titles on and off, but nothing really hooked me. Then I played <i>Shadows of Amn</i> and had my mind blown. Games I had played before then didn&#39;t really have very engrossing stories. They didn&#39;t offer me choices. <i>Shadows of Amn</i> was like a playable book, and that stunned me. That was the first title that showed me there might be something to these video games after all, that they could offer me the depth I typically only found on the page. Still gaming to this day.</p>

            <p>And that&#39;s Salamandastron. It was the first book I ever really cared about. Before then, reading just wasn&#39;t a thing I did, then my older brother loaned me his copy, and I got sucked in. It was my introduction to the series that inspired my love of reading, fantasy, history, writing, drawing... Just about everything I enjoy today. In fact, it was through the Redwall fandom that I got here. From Kelaiah and Arawolf Beechclaw, to OFUM, to the Original Series, to here.</p>

            <p>Seriously, before the Original Series I didn&#39;t really think about the grammar rules of written English. I was always careful when speaking, but for some reason I just didn&#39;t realize that all those rules about punctuation and capitalization and such actually mattered. Then Jay, Acacia, and Miss Cam came along and I suddenly realized, &quot;Wow, English makes no sense without this stuff.&quot; And the world was spared one more badfic writer. Something for which I am eternally grateful.</p>

            <p>A rather obscure Christian YA trilogy, but it got me through some rough patches when I was dealing with self-confidence issues. The whole plot revolves around normal, everyday people actually being courageous knights in another world-- and that sounded pretty good to me.

            <p>If nothing else, it&#39;d be interesting to share another point of reference with a friend. =]<br><br>That said, the major plot point (as you describe it) sounds very similar to the first season of <i>Once Upon A Time</i>, a television series I exhort you to watch if you, like me, are an aficionado of gleefully rubbish telly. By way of an example, a bail bondswoman (glorified bounty hunter) goes up against the Evil Queen from Snow White in order to regain custody of her son, and the aforementioned Evil Queen is fighting a private war against Rumplestiltskin who is also kinda-sorta the avatar of evil itself. Also Rumplestiltskin shacks up with Belle.<br><br>As in <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> Belle.<br><br>OUAT is <i>weird</i>. =]<br><br>As for the Bible, Christ&#39;s message - as I interpret it, and I admit to being a decidedly liberal and progressivist student of the genre - is one of love and acceptance, and it is one not shared by far, far too many Christians. But then, I am a skeptically-inclined agnostic; the only God I willingly countenance existing is one that loves all the creatures of this earth, regardless of whether or not the fill (by way of example) traditional gender roles or gender identities. The word of Christ is love, love shared between every human being on this damp and shaking rock, and I refuse to be denied the chance to love based on doctrinaire zealots with delusions of grandeur.<br><br>At least, that&#39;s what the Word is to me. YMMV.</p>

            <p>An interesting thing, though: I&#39;ve never actually <i>read</i> them. Through some twist of Amazonian ordering, I got the audiobooks instead, narrated by the author. They really made the world come alive for me; I can&#39;t recommend them enough. Say, what&#39;s <i>Red Dwarf</i> about? I wouldn&#39;t mind sharing another point of reference, either. <br><br>Waaait wait wait wait wait; you watch <i>Once Upon a Time?</i> That&#39;s <i>awesome!</i> I love that show! My first mission was a OUAT fic, actually (not that you can tell. Suethor!me thoroughly butchered everything to the point of *puts on Phantom mask* no return). It is pretty weird, innit? Especially the family tree. Technically, Henry is Emma&#39;s step uncle. Think about <i>that</i> for a bit. <br><br>Hmm, now that&#39;s an interesting question: What <i>is</i> Christ&#39;s central message? To me, it&#39;s undoubtedly Calvary, which is the supreme gesture of love. Out of curiosity, I asked someone I know who is well-versed in theology (certainly more well-versed than I am) what he thought Jesus&#39; central message was: he said, &quot;The Kingdom of God is at hand.&quot; It&#39;s an interesting question; love is deeply entwined in God&#39;s nature, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s quite correct to say that love and acceptance is the whole of Christ&#39;s message. I think the message of the Gospel is composed of several different things, certainly including love.<br><br>I won&#39;t deny that Christians are commanded to love our neighbors, and that we often don&#39;t, letting pride and petty hatred rule our actions. This is neither good not godly, and ought to be rightly opposed. In a perfect world-- but I might as well be wishing for Christ to come now-- in a <i>better</i> world, the church would police itself much more than it seems like it does today.<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>I think it was Captain Hook who first convinced me that the villain could be, and often was, cooler than the so-called hero. Over the course of my formative years, the collective mass of Disney animation (and also Batman, because Batman) also convinced me of something else: not only were villains cool, but sometimes they had a point.<br><br>I pretty quickly got annoyed with the fact that only one side got to actually show what they thought. Maybe if you numbskulls just talked to the hyenas, they wouldn&#39;t think murdering you was the only way for them to get food. Admittedly, this had less of a profound emotional impact on me, and more convinced me that I would do better in a field where everyone at least had a shot at arguing their point. That&#39;s why I&#39;m majoring in politics and/or law.</p>

            <p>But, okay, <i>Excluded</i>, a book of essays by Julia Serano, completely changed the way I look at the world. Its perspective has some kind of effect on most of my opinions. It made me think about what it means to be a woman, what it means to be a community, and what it means to be human. It made me notice interesting patterns in the way humans think and act, and in general made me more conscious and thoughtful. This is especially important for me because I naturally tend to live in a cloud, fairly oblivious to social cues. Basically, it gave me a really interesting, deep perspective on society, and made me more capable as a human being.<br><br>This book is great, but maybe not for everyone. I mean, I think anyone could learn a lot from it, but the target audience is feminist and queer activists, so if you don&#39;t know anything about those movements it would not be a good introduction.<br><br><i>The Black Parade</i> is a great album. I wouldn&#39;t say it changed my life, but it was really important to me in middle school. Especially, yeah, Welcome to the Black Parade.</p>

            <p>I was bullied quite badly while in elementary school, and many days the only thing that kept me going were the <i>Harry Potter</i> books. Whenever I&#39;d start making plans to run away or worse, I&#39;d read them again and be reminded that there had to be people as good and kind as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, just <i>had</i> to, because to me, coming up with those characters would have been impossible if people like them didn&#39;t exist.

            <p>I guess I should put up a disclaimer first, huh? A&#39;right - this piece of writing is owned by J.K. Rowling, and was found on Pottermore.com. I do not own anything, yaddah, yaddah, yaddah...<br><br><b>History of Magic in North America: 14th - 17th Century</b><br><br><i>Fourteenth Century – Seventeenth Century<br>By J.K. Rowling<br><br>Though European explorers called it ‘the New World’ when they first reached the continent, wizards had known about America long before Muggles (Note: while every nationality has its own term for ‘Muggle,’ the American community uses the slang term No-Maj, short for ‘No Magic’). Various modes of magical travel – brooms and Apparition among them – not to mention visions and premonitions, meant that even far-flung wizarding communities were in contact with each other from the Middle Ages onwards.<br><br>The Native American magical community and those of Europe and Africa had known about each other long before the immigration of European No-Majs in the seventeenth century. They were already aware of the many similarities between their communities. Certain families were clearly ‘magical’, and magic also appeared unexpectedly in families where hitherto there had been no known witch or wizard. The overall ratio of wizards to non-wizards seemed consistent across populations, as did the attitudes of No-Majs, wherever they were born. In the Native American community, some witches and wizards were accepted and even lauded within their tribes, gaining reputations for healing as medicine men, or outstanding hunters. However, others were stigmatised for their beliefs, often on the basis that they were possessed by malevolent spirits.<br><br>The legend of the Native American ‘skin walker’ – an evil witch or wizard that can transform into an animal at will – has its basis in fact. A legend grew up around the Native American Animagi, that they had sacrificed close family members to gain their powers of transformation. In fact, the majority of Animagi assumed animal forms to escape persecution or to hunt for the tribe. Such derogatory rumours often originated with No-Maj medicine men, who were sometimes faking magical powers themselves, and fearful of exposure.<br><br>The Native American wizarding community was particularly gifted in animal and plant magic, its potions in particular being of a sophistication beyond much that was known in Europe. The most glaring difference between magic practised by Native Americans and the wizards of Europe was the absence of a wand.<br><br>The magic wand originated in Europe. Wands channel magic so as to make its effects both more precise and more powerful, although it is generally held to be a mark of the very greatest witches and wizards that they have also been able to produce wandless magic of a very high quality. As the Native American Animagi and potion-makers demonstrated, wandless magic can attain great complexity, but Charms and Transfiguration are very difficult without one.</i></p>

            <p>a) I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re referring to here. Skin-walkers? What she says is that they exist (as Animagi) and that rumours built up about them, mostly among the colonials. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin-walker">claims</a> that the Navajo version (it&#39;s not clear on whether there are others) is viewed as wildly evil. (I&#39;ll also observe that in the Dresden Files, skinwalkers are amoral psychopathic shapeshifters who can barely be killed; JKR is being far nicer about it than most.)<br><br>b) Particularly gifted != only good at. Wand-using wizards are implied to be &#39;particularly gifted at&#39; Charms and Transfiguration - but that doesn&#39;t mean Harry Potter can&#39;t be spectacularly good at other things, too.<br><br>c) I think it&#39;s pretty clear that these narratives are from the viewpoint of a near-present Colonial American. The Natives drop off the page as soon as Europeans start to do things, there&#39;s absolutely no mention of the enslaved African wizards who were almost certainly there, and the <i>very</i> dubious decisions of the magical government (see: part 3) are accepted at face-value. So it&#39;s actually <i>the narrator</i> saying &#39;oh, yeah, Native magic is identical to ours, except they suck at most of it&#39;.<br><br>Someone - oh, yep, it was firemagic again - pointed out that Animagi in particular <i>must</i> be (at least slightly) different among the Native American peoples - because they don&#39;t have access to the required mandrake leaves.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>-JKR apparently doesn&#39;t know how Americans form slang. ;)<br><br>-Magic is objective. It doesn&#39;t vary depending on how you think it works, or what your beliefs are in general. Entirely separate cultures both had Animagi, it&#39;s hereditary both sides of the pond, and the magic wand is entirely useable by both. This is quite different to a lot of worlds.<br><br>-&#39;American&#39; magic may or may not have a Native connection. I assume this will come in in part two? The fact that the magical communities knew each other beforehand makes it less likely that the immigrant magicians would suppress the locals, but who knows (yet)?<br><br>-Oh, yeah: the magical communities knew each other beforehand. Which means that the whole &#39;keep everything secret from Muggles&#39; thing is not only very, very old - no-one told the Roman Empire about America, for instance (or the East Asian seagoing powers, for that matter!) - but also universal, since the Natives clearly didn&#39;t know the Muggles were coming.<br><br>-Though there exists a possibility that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leif_Erikson">Leif Erikson</a> was a wizard, along with his father. They certainly had a lot of luck discovering things in the west, didn&#39;t they?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Clearly magic is NOT objective, as well. By Rowling&#39;s own word, part of the process to becoming an Animagus involved holding a mandrake leaf under your tongue for a month.<br><br>Mandrakes are a Mediterranean plant not found in the Americas.<br><br>Also, I kind of take issue with the skin walker thing. For one thing skin walkers are a Navajo belief, and more importantly - those beliefs are not just superstition, they are part of an actively practiced religion.

            <p>In Terry Pratchett&#39;s pre-<i>Discworld</i> novel <i>Strata</i>, the Norse discovery of America stuck.<br><br><i>Leiv Eiriksson... discovered Vinland, more than three hundred years after the Battle of Haelcor had ended the third and last Remen Empire.<br><br>The big migration followed automatically. The Turks were again pushing west and north. Leiv&#39;s father, Eirik, was a shrewd salesman. His Greenland had turned out nowhere like as green as it had been in his imagination, but from Vinland Leiv had thoughtfully brought rich berries and wild grains. The Northmen went west again.<br><br>They leap-frogged colony after colony down the eastern seaboard, up into the base rugged lands around Tyker&#39;s Sea and down the Long Fjord into the Middle Seas. It was the landscape of their dreams. They called it Valhalla.<br><br>There were natives. But the newcomers were only half-hearted farmers -- underneath the agricultural veneer they thought bloody. Those tribes they couldn&#39;t out fight they out- thought. When they met the Objibwa Confederacy they made treaties. And they spread, and merged.<br><br>By all the theories it should have ended there. Neither the natives nor the invaders had the textbook kind of social dynamic that builds Remes. The Northmen should have become just another tribe, with blue eyes and fair hair.<br><br>The theories were wrong. Something latent in both races was sparked into fire. It was a big continent, and it was rich.<br><br>In short, 300 years after Leiv, a fleet arrived at the mouth of the Mediterranean. Most of the vessels were under sail although there were one or two, small, fast and inclined to blow up, that could move into the wind. The sails of the big ships bore the Great Eagle of Valhalla on a striped background alternating the colours of the sky, the snow and blood.<br><br>The Battle of Gibraltar was short. Europe had been through 200 years of stagnation.<br><br>There was no answer to cannon.<br><br>...there was a worn mound in the heart of Valhalla where the water from the five inland seas spilled over into the Long Fjord. Eirick&#39;s Beard, they called the water. Red Eric had been buried in the mound. It was a big tourist attraction.</i><br><br>We never set foot on Earth during the course of the book**. Pre-Disc Pterry <i>loved</i> sketching in worldbuilding.<br><br>hS<br><br>**Or do we? There&#39;s a certain... implication in Kin&#39;s plans at the end of the story that I only just noticed... hmm.</p>

            <p>A friend pointed out to me that, as far as American slang goes, we normally don&#39;t make slang by stopping a word partway through? It tends to either be acronyms, words from another language that got slurred and changed, or something more or less unrelated that got associated with it at some point. For a really obvious comparison, television gets shortened to TV rather than calling it a tele. So I&#39;d expect the term to be like, &#39;Enem&#39; (N-M, no-magic) or somesuch. <br><br>Alternately, it could be whatever term the first large population of wizards to come to the country used, corrupted and mangled until it only halfway sounds like the original phrase. If Norwegian wizards were the first to start coming to America en masse, then the slang would be a weird version of whatever the Norwegians called their nonmagical people. <br><br>Why yes I do like to nitpick really inconsequential setting details!</p>

            <p>No clue if anyone&#39;s willing to listen, but I figured I&#39;d rant, because this has been on my mind for a while. There&#39;s a series in particular that I&#39;m thinking of, although I won&#39;t say it because I&#39;m a polite person. Kind of. <br>Let&#39;s set the scene. <br>The summary looks a bit cheesy, but intriguing. The story is a decent length, and when you click on the link, a cheerful author&#39;s note greets you. The story begins surprisingly well, with correct grammar, and doesn&#39;t deviate from canon too much in a short time. <br>Actually, it doesn&#39;t deviate from canon at all, save to add in snippets of a character who appears to be smarter than the incredibly brilliant canon protagonist. <br>The protagonist, who, canonically, has respect for the English language and does not text with &quot;u&quot; or &quot;gr8.&quot; <br>I had such high hopes for that piece, and the first chapter destroyed it.<br>*takes deep breath and refrains from slamming head against nearest hard surface*<br>For some reason, I continued to read this fic, hoping that maybe it would get better. The only reason I was able to finish was because it was punctuated correctly, and the author didn&#39;t completely mess up the final scene. (It was a Sherlock fic, that much I will reveal.) <br>BUT SWEET RASSILON, THE SEQUEL. It simultaneously made Sherlock into someone fluffy, loving, and caring, while destroying the tentative humanity shown in the programme. My favourite part of &#39;Hounds of the Baskervilles&#39; was ruined. The OC became Sherlock&#39;s pride and joy, and I felt as though John was just sort of there for the ride. <br>Oh, yeah. And then Sherlock and the OC got engaged.<br>(Spoilers begin here)<br>This may descend into complete caps lock madness, but I will try my hardest to keep it coherent. The final episode of Season 2 approached, inevitably. After Sherlock jumped, the OC somehow figured out, within seconds, that Sherlock&#39;s death was fake. *runs into corner, screeching* <br>Alright, I&#39;m back. <br>She then proceeds NOT TO MENTION ANYTHING TO JOHN. POOR, HEARTBROKEN JOHN. THE OC KEEPS THIS KNOWLEDGE TO HERSELF FOR TWO YEARS, EVEN AS SHE KNOWS THAT JOHN CARES SO DEEPLY FOR SHERLOCK. <br>And then - by the Angel, her treatment of Anderson made me want to pull my hair out. Yes, Anderson wasn&#39;t exactly the kindest character in the first two seasons. However, we see that he felt genuine remorse for believing that he drove Sherlock to death. (He became the ultimate fanboy.) Still, we learned that Anderson&#39;s actions were all a part of Moriarty&#39;s plot to destroy Sherlock&#39;s good name. <br>So, the OC, who figured out Sherlock is alive (because she&#39;s SPESHUL), puts on a teary, heartbroken face in front of Anderson, who&#39;s presenting his latest theories on Sherlock. She sees the fact that she&#39;s causing him more guilt than he already has over the situation. Once he leaves, she SMIRKS, wipes away her &quot;tears,&quot; and proceeds with life as normal. <br>HELP. Where can I find some Bleeprin, please? <br>(Wow, that was a lot of ranting. Whoops.)</p>

            <p>The Time When Sherlock Holmes is Afraid scene in The Hound of Baskervilles is probably my favourite scene in all of BBC&#39;s Sherlock. It&#39;s raw, emotional, and incredibly honest. I do not think that fear was fake. <br>I nearly screamed at the &quot;fake&quot; fear in that fic. (Ooh, alliteration. Fancy.) <br>I believe that the Leena-goes-too-far-with-Anderson scene is in the next book. Why oh why do I read bad fan fiction? It infuriates me. I&#39;m not sure what I think will happen if I continue reading, because it tends to get worse as the plot goes on. <br>(Don&#39;t even get me started on the &quot;blog&quot; that goes alongside this series because I will probably cause an explosive reaction with the force of my anger.) <br>Anyway, glad to see that I&#39;m not the only one who finds this fic absolutely maddening. :)</p>

            <p>I have a horrible memory. I forget things that shouldn&#39;t even be possible, like what country I&#39;m in (No, really). My short attention span combines with that to make reading anything that drags on with unnecessarily large words next to impossible. I wind up forgetting earlier parts of the sentence, and I end up re-reading the whole thing so many times that anyone else could finish the book in half the time it takes me.<br><br>Oddly, me and chemistry get along well, despite the need for huge words. Maybe it&#39;s because all the words are nice and orderly and logical... unlike urple prose.</p>

            <p>Side-specials like that are fun, but they make you predictable. I used to play that way. A smart player will see your move coming a mile away and beat you easily. You have to diversify; it won&#39;t feel like you&#39;re doing very well at first, but you&#39;ll get better quickly. Trust me, I speak from experience. I have some friends who have been playing since the first installment (I played Melee the tiniest bit-- stank like yesterday&#39;s fish sandwich. I got better in Brawl, and I&#39;m at the top of my game in SSB4) and they always used to beat me. Now, with Shulk, I can sometimes edge in a victory. At the very least, I&#39;m not awful. <br><br>Anyway, there&#39;s some random Smash tips. ^_^ For what they&#39;re worth.<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>it&#39;s a life-changing, deep experience, it won Game of the Year in 2013, and many consider it to be one of the few games of this generation to be called Art. Best of all, it looks absolutely gorgeous, and the music is so soothing and you really can get into the shoes of your little avatar. It&#39;s a game about the journey of life and not the destination.<br><br>It&#39;s unique in so many ways - for example, if you play with an online connection, you could do multi-player, but only in the sense that you might by chance bump another player from anywhere around the world who&#39;s also playing the game at the same time. There is no text whatsoever except for the title and the credits, and no way to speak - you can only sing musical notes to gather energy and interact with stuff. Did I mention you have a magical scarf that you can lengthen to - get this - FLY? And best of all, there&#39;s a mysterious story to discover about the history of your race and who you are and what your destiny is, a story that fans still offer their own interpretations on.<br><br>It&#39;s not a kiddie game - it&#39;s a game with a deep message, a story that will urge you to return, stunning visuals, and an absolute relaxing effect that goes beyond any other game I&#39;ve known about so far.<br><br>It&#39;s a single-player game and takes two hours at minimum to complete, but it is so worth it. You will want to play Journey more than once, I promise!</p>

            <p>If you get the chance, I&#39;d highly recommend the MOBA <i>SMITE</i>. Long story short, it&#39;s basically a mega-crossover crackfic of six different mythologies and it&#39;s ridiculously fun. I&#39;ve heard this game is similar to LoL in terms of character playstyles and overall gameplay, but it&#39;s been growing into its own lately and I think it&#39;d be worth giving it a look. Best of all, it&#39;s free! Just set up a Hi-Rez account and download the game from Steam and you should be good to go. :)<br><br>Speaking of Steam, I&#39;d also suggest <i>Undertale</i>, because the story and gameplay are really well done, to say the least. Y&#39;know what, I&#39;ll let <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2016/And%20another%20underrated%20Steam%20">Bogleech</a> do all the talking with this one.<br><br>And another underrated Steam game I&#39;ve played: <i>Primal Carnage</i>. It&#39;s <i>Team Fortress 2</i> meets <i>Jurassic Park</i>, and they&#39;re working with more obscure dinosaur species, too. I haven&#39;t played it for a while, but I used to quite a bit during college and the experience was quite action-packed. Shame it hasn&#39;t gotten more exposure, they&#39;re doing quite a good job for a versus shooter with JP-style prehistoric creatures in it.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m a huge PC gamer myself but I&#39;m not big on console games. Anyway, here&#39;s my list of PC games you may want to try out:<br><br>Team fortress 2 - While it is rated M, it&#39;s only because it&#39;s a first person shooter and in my opinion it should probably be rated teen. It&#39;s 100% free too so no problem if you don&#39;t enjoy it.<br><br>Minecraft - playing in survival mode may be time consuming, but there are tons of servers with many versatile custom minigames that you may enjoy. Practically anything is possible with this game.<br><br>League of Legends - I haven&#39;t played this game in a while but it&#39;s also completely free. Games take on average about 30-40 minutes, and there are so many different characters to play that it won&#39;t get boring anytime soon.</p>

            <p>So let&#39;s begin with... er, between things already posted and your ban on RPG, it&#39;s already harder. I&#39;ll try it anyway.<br><br>For PC, you could try Starcraft 2, or find Red Alert 2 in order to usee its mod Mental Omega. or, you could go with the 20-hours long tutorial o XCOM Long War, Enemy Within. Long War can come later.<br><br>Aaand, if T-RPG are still allowed, you could try Fire Emblem Path of Radiance and Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn.</p>

            <p>Oh, this is my jam. <br><br><b>Wii</b><br><br>Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2. Platforming at its finest with a sublime orchestral OST to boot. <br><br>Donkey Kong Country Returns. Another excellent platformer with more sweet, groovy tunes. Made by Retro Studios, who also made...<br><br>The Metroid Prime Trilogy. First two on Gamecube and last one on Wii. A first-person exploration adventure with some shooter elements. OST and art direction are top notch. Thanks to the Wii&#39;s backwards compatibility you can play Prime and Echoes but you&#39;ll need a Gamecube controller and a memory card. <br><br>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. Yes, you need a widget thing for the Wiimote but trust me: the ride is worth it. <br><br><br><b>PC</b><br><br>Drop anything you&#39;re doing, get on Steam, and buy Bastion and Transistor. Do it. Do it now. <br><br>FTL: Faster Than Light if you want all the pain of Dark Souls and the fun of a spaceship management/combat simulator. <br><br>I&#39;d suggest Half-Life 2 and its episodes but you said you&#39;re not into M games, right? Still, throwing it out there: it was and still is an influential FPS game. <br><br>And lastly, Minecraft because why not. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve played Super Mario Galaxy 1, although I never finished it, for some reason. It should be hanging around somewhere; I think I&#39;ll find it and give it another go. I&#39;ve also played Skyward Sword. It&#39;s probably my second favorite Zelda game, after Wind Waker.<br><br>Donkey Kong and Metroid, however, I have yet to play. I probably should, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;re quite fun.<br><br>Bastion and Transitor sound intriguing. I&#39;ll look them up. If it&#39;s anything like Dark Souls, FTL might not be for me; ragingly difficult games aren&#39;t  quite my cup of tea. <br><br>Thank you for all the recommendations! I have hours of fun ahead of me. ^_^<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>WARFRAME used to be downright excuse plot-y on the lore, but DE&#39;s changing that now — they&#39;ve been releasing lore-ish content every major update for a while, with some good things in the .5 ones. u18&#39;s <i>The Second Dream</i> quest is stunning and the newest one — u18.5&#39;s <i>Sands of Inaros</i> isn&#39;t as lore-heavy but is very interesting, since it involves the resident <a href="http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Baro_Ki'Teer">Salt Trader</a>.<br><br>Word of warning, though: Warframe doesn&#39;t do a good job of explaining itself to newbies. Fortunately, it has a <a href="http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/WARFRAME_Wiki">comprehensive wiki</a>. Further, Tactical Potato made a very good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg1HzElMoKvJMCJXJpY2O1zwWr8ZcMMlB">newbie guide</a>, and I highly recommend watching it — it will certainly lessen the &quot;what the hell am I supposed to do&quot; feeling Warframe gives you at the beginning.</p>

            <p>... the various Lego games, which you can get for either PC or Wii. I have <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Jurassic World</i>, and have played <i>Star Wars</i> some too. <i>Jurassic World</i> seems to have aimed weirdly at children - in the levels based on the first film, no-one and nothing dies in gameplay or cutscene unless you mess up the quicktime-event raptor attacks in a single level - but LotR and SW are very fun.<br><br>Particularly LotR, since it&#39;s open-world across the entirety of Middle-earth, and after you finish the game you get to choose your character... yeah. :D<br><br>OH!

            <p>Like I said, I&#39;d played LEGO Star Wars before, but long enough before that I didn&#39;t really register the difference. Plus, there&#39;s one major advantage to the film-voices method: it means that in LEGO Jurassic World, Ian Malcolm&#39;s pain-sounds are taken from Jeff Goldblum&#39;s lines. ^_^ Every fight, he spends his time going &quot;ow... ow... ow...&quot; in the most long-suffering voice imaginable. It&#39;s great. :D<br><br>Though I understand that the, uh LEGO Lego Movie game was worse than most of the others, because it not only used movie <i>sounds</i>, but also movie <i>footage</i>. So they didn&#39;t bother to make their own jokes. Very sad.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I played several of them (made by Frogwares) and I love every single one I&#39;ve played. Personal recommendations:<br><br><i>Sherlock Holmes: Nemesis</i>, also known as <i>Sherlock Holmes vs Arsene Lupin</i>, from 2007. Sherlock is challenged by the French Master Thief, Lupin, to a game with the whole Britain&#39;s reputation being at stake.<br><br><i>Sherlock Holmes vs Jack the Ripper</i> from 2009. Pretty self-explanatory methinks.<br><br><i>The Testament of Sherlock Holmes</i>, also from 2009, set in the London of 1898, with Holmes presented as the main suspect in a case in which he is unable to prove his innocence. <br><br><i>Sherlock Holmes: Crimes &amp; Punishments</i>, from 2014. My personal favourite, as it introduces a brand new &#39;Deduction System&#39;, definitely inspired by the BBC&#39;s Sherlock.<br><br>All of the above are available on PC. On May 27, 2016, a new game will some out: <i>Sherlock Holmes: The Devil&#39;s Daughter</i>.</p>

            <p>As before, I own nothing.<br><br><b>17th Century and beyond</b><br><br><i>As No-Maj Europeans began to emigrate to the New World, more witches and wizards of European origin also came to settle in America. Like their No-Maj counterparts, they had a variety of reasons for leaving their countries of origin. Some were driven by a sense of adventure, but most were running away: sometimes from persecution by No-Majs, sometimes from a fellow witch or wizard, but also from the wizarding authorities. The latter sought to blend in among the increasing tide of No-Majs, or hide among the Native American wizarding population, who were generally welcoming and protective of their European brethren.<br><br>From the first, however, it was clear that the New World was to be a harsher environment for witches and wizards than the Old World. There were three main reasons for this.<br><br>Firstly, like their No-Maj counterparts, they had come to a country with few amenities, except those they made themselves. Back home, they had only to visit the local Apothecary to find the necessities for potions: here, they had to forage among unfamiliar magical plants. There were no established wandmakers, and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which would one day rank among the greatest magical establishments in the world, was at that time no more than a rough shack containing two teachers and two students.<br><br>Secondly, the actions of their fellow No-Majs made the non-magical population of most wizards’ homelands look lovable. Not only had conflict developed between the immigrants and the Native American population, which struck a blow at the unity of the magical community, their religious beliefs made them deeply intolerant of any trace of magic. The Puritans were happy to accuse each other of occult activity on the slenderest evidence, and New World witches and wizards were right to be extremely wary of them.<br><br>The last, and probably the most dangerous problem encountered by wizards newly arrived in North America were the Scourers. As the wizarding community in America was small, scattered and secretive, it had as yet no law enforcement mechanism of its own. This left a vacuum that was filled by an unscrupulous band of wizarding mercenaries of many foreign nationalities, who formed a much-feared and brutal taskforce committed to hunting down not only known criminals, but anyone who might be worth some gold. As time went on, the Scourers became increasingly corrupt. Far away from the jurisdiction of their native magical governments, many indulged a love of authority and cruelty unjustified by their mission. Such Scourers enjoyed bloodshed and torture, and even went so far as trafficking their fellow wizards. The numbers of Scourers multiplied across America in the late seventeenth century and there is evidence that they were not above passing off innocent No-Majs as wizards, to collect rewards from gullible non-magic members of the community.<br><br>The famous Salem Witch Trials of 1692-93 were a tragedy for the wizarding community. Wizarding historians agree that among the so-called Puritan judges were at least two known Scourers, who were paying off feuds that had developed while in America. A number of the dead were indeed witches, though utterly innocent of the crimes for which they had been arrested. Others were merely No-Majs who had the misfortune to be caught up in the general hysteria and bloodlust.<br><br>Salem was significant within the magical community for reasons far beyond the tragic loss of life. Its immediate effect was to cause many witches and wizards to flee America, and many more to decide against locating there. This led to interesting variations in the magical population of North America, compared to the populations of Europe, Asia and Africa. Up until the early decades of the twentieth century, there were fewer witches and wizards in the general American population than on the other four continents. Pure-blood families, who were well-informed through wizarding newspapers about the activities of both Puritans and Scourers, rarely left for America. This meant a far higher percentage of No-Maj-born witches and wizards in the New World than elsewhere. While these witches and wizards often went on to marry and found their own all-magical families, the pure-blood ideology that has dogged much of Europe’s magical history has gained far less traction in America.<br><br>Perhaps the most significant effect of Salem was the creation of the Magical Congress of the United States of America in 1693, pre-dating the No-Maj version by around a century. Known to all American witches and wizards by the abbreviation MACUSA (commonly pronounced as: Mah – cooz – ah), it was the first time that the North American wizarding community came together to create laws for themselves, effectively establishing a magical-world-within-a-No-Maj-world such as existed in most other countries. MACUSA’s first task was to put on trial the Scourers who had betrayed their own kind. Those convicted of murder, of wizard-trafficking, torture and all other manners of cruelty were executed for their crimes.<br><br>Several of the most notorious Scourers eluded justice. With international warrants out for their arrest, they vanished permanently into the No-Maj community. Some of them married No-Majs and founded families where magical children appear to have been winnowed out in favour of non-magical offspring, to maintain the Scourer’s cover. The vengeful Scourers, cast out from their people, passed on to their descendants an absolute conviction that magic was real, and the belief that witches and wizards ought to be exterminated wherever they were found.<br><br>American magical historian Theophilus Abbot has identified several such families, each with a deep belief in magic and a great hatred of it. It may be partly due to the anti-magic beliefs and activities of the descendants of Scourer families that North American No-Majs often seem harder to fool and hoodwink on the subject of magic than many other populations. This has had far-reaching repercussions on the way the American wizarding community is governed.</i></p>

            <p>-Ilvermorny dates to somewhere in the early 1600s, but started off small. Still no indication of where exactly it is, or where it got the name. It seems that it was <i>not</i> a native institution, though, so the name is probably from a European language.<br><br>-The question &#39;how did real magic users get caught up in witch trials?&#39; is answered with &#39;magical witchcatchers&#39;. Fairly logical, that.<br><br>-The New World magical community seems to have cut itself off from the Old. Whereas before the Natives were in vague contact with Europe and Africa, now the running-from-authority Euromericans may have damped down on that communication.<br><br>-Magical plants are different in the New World. That means different potions, and probably (once they got round to it) different woods for wands.<br><br>-There are few to no Pureblood families in the Americas, and so no racism around that. That&#39;s really interesting, given the vast historical problem the US has with the <i>other</i> sort of racism. I guess JKR was correlating Purebloods with the aristocracy here? Speculation: skin-colour racism was alive and well in the American magical community, probably justified as &#39;African wizards should just Apparate back to Africa where they belong&#39;.<br><br>-MACUSA has changed its name at least once. In the 1690s, it would have been &#39;United Colonies&#39; if anything, but probably just &#39;North American Colonies&#39;. The term &#39;u/United States&#39; is a political coinage from much later. I&#39;m dubious about &#39;Congress&#39;, too - the term seems to have originally meant a single meeting, not an ongoing thing. I&#39;d imagine they changed from ??Magical Parliament of the North American Colonies to MACUSA during the War of Independence.<br><br>-Americans are harder to trick about magic than Europeans. This sort of feels like it might be a snide comment on something, but I have no idea what.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Americans being harder to trick about magic has some degree of sense.  Early American Settlers were convinced that magic was real.  That is precisely one of the reasons that the Salem Witch Trials took off like they dead.  Early Americans were convinced Magic was just outside their gates, they believed that the devil was hunting them.<br><br>So that can make some degree of sense. </p>

            <p>1) I&#39;m gonna guess that Ilvermorny is going to be the final big reveal that conculdes this entire thing. Two more texts to go, Thursday and Friday.<br><br>2) I&#39;m not that surprised about plants, honestly. There are countless plants native to America: hawthorn, basswood, wintergreen, horsemint, jewelweed, etc. Also, if I had to guess, I&#39;d say the most popular wand wood would be hickory.</p>

            <p>Thing is, mostly what we&#39;ve got here are varieties of the same sorts of trees found in Europe: oak, ash, elm, pine, birch, maple, willow, etc. I reckon sugar maple and aspen would be big ones.<br><br>I&#39;d love to see a mangrove wand, though.

            <p>...and you&#39;re trying to decide which ones to use? Especially for multiple agents that go into different Departments.<br><br>See, I have about five ideas for different agents I want to create in the near future, and I feel strongly about all of them.

            <p>If it&#39;s not too aggravating, I have a question. When a Boarder writes their first story, are their agents also shiny and new? <br>In the sample Agent bios on the wikia, it said that one of them had worked in the Department of Implausible Crossovers (I think) before transferring to another one. Clearly, all agents must have lives before and/or outside of the PPC. Is developing an agent a bit like taking a Generic Bit Character and turning them into something more? <br>I&#39;m probably totally incorrect, but I&#39;ve just been wondering this for a while. My apologies for irritating you guys. </p>

            <p>But it can help. :)<br><br>When I first went about writing my spin-off, I made a conscious decision to make both Agent!July and Library completely new; this meant that I after I made sure I knew the tools and basic concepts that I <i>had</i> to know, I was giving myself wiggle room in case I messed up on procedure somehow- because a vet would know what they&#39;re doing! Newbies wouldn&#39;t! <br><br>And as far as developing an agent, it&#39;s just like developing any other character: You start off with the basics and then add more and more as you go along. To use an example, think about the Harry Potter series. We get introduced to our main characters and all the secondaries, and we learn more and more information about them as time goes on after the basics are established. That&#39;s how you go about characterization, because if you throw everything at the reader at once, it&#39;s a bit of an info dump and overwhelming. <br><br>Not to mention, characters can change things up on you or decide to do something else that you hadn&#39;t exactly expected in the first place! I started off with very general ideas about what I was doing with July and Library, and they ended up going in far more specific (and more than somewhat different) directions than I had expected- July became more erratic and slowly more and more reactionary in missions and in interludes, while Library ended up being the calmer one, but also the one who ended up starting to steer things around and make the plans.<br><br>-July</p>

            <p>&quot;Two newbie agents&quot; is a possibility, but it isn&#39;t a must. Off the top of my head, Wobbles the clown used to be in the A/V division (and worked in the Nursery) before transferring to Floaters; by the time we first see Agent!Des he&#39;s been around for a while (how much time, I&#39;m not certain — I&#39;m still toying with that); and, of course, Jay and Acacia weren&#39;t newbies at the start of TOS.</p>

            <p>Overal, the vast majority of boarders who ever write a spin-off only get a relatively small number of missions done. People who have very long spin-offs like Indemaat, Iximaz, Trojie (and even hS) are a very, very small minority. <br><br>I&#39;d suggest working with just one pair at first, and then if you want, start introducing the rest into that spin-off a bit at a time as supporting characters. Eventually you can start writing missions for them, too, if you really want. <br><br>Try focusing on one mission at a time, one spin-off at a time and see about getting a pace and rythym going there first. <br><br>I&#39;ve been around for awhile, and it&#39;s only relatively recently that I&#39;ve really explored actually setting up new agent pairs.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with waiting on the rest.<br><br>That said, we put a lot down on trying to assume good faith in others on the board, which includes not needing to ask people to not steal ideas. <br><br>-July </p>

            <p>I agree with the gist of this: write one agent-team to let both us and yourself get to know them. It&#39;s worth remembering that Iximaz wrote a <i>lot</i> of Rina-Randa and Rina-Zeb missions, and that my Dafydd-Selene(-whoever) missions were almost all written before I used any other agents.

            <p>...hardly mission-featuring spin-offs. :P My point of focus was, after all, on agents doing missions. You&#39;re prolific and influential elsewhere, don&#39;t you worry, hS.<br><br>But yeah, let them reach their potential first, like hS said. If you scatter yourself all over the place, you won&#39;t be able to give any single character or agent pair as much attention as you would otherwise and figure out what makes them tick sooner. <br></p>

            <p>Don&#39;t bring in any new agents until you&#39;ve developed them well enough to be able to write them.

            <p>I&#39;m still deciding on species and name, but what I have figured out is that the Jedi would be male, and he would be part of the Gray Order, who was training to be an Ice Sage before finding himself in the PPC. His lightsaber would be yellow-bladed.<br><br>Reserved and a bit egotistical, he&#39;s almost robotic to outsiders with the level his calmness and analytical, factual personality can go to, and while he may crack a joke or two, it takes a while for him to warm up to anyone. He&#39;s kind of like BBC!Sherlock in that regard. While emotions normally wouldn&#39;t come through in conversation unless you&#39;re extremely lucky, they do manage to show a little better in his writing, AKA Reports.<br><br>Like all Gray Jedi, he believes firmly in a balance between the Light and Dark Sides; if one side were vanquished completely, then the galaxies wouldn&#39;t survive for long. So even though he doesn&#39;t like Sues, he will not agree or wish along with the majority of PPC members that they were just wiped out. &quot;Sues help us to learn and see what better writing is,&quot; he might say.</p>

            <p>I like the idea of extending his principles on balance to Sues. Could make for an interesting dynamic with the more trigger happy PPC members.<br><br>Though I do have a query about the Gray Jedi Order. I looked it up and saw that they&#39;re headquartered on Zonama Sekot, and I have to wonder how they found it.

            <p>A name is the least important thing about a character. Jossk Noda, former Trandoshan bounty hunter, is no different to me than Bassk Ralo, former Trandoshan bounty hunter. Or, for that matter, than Galaro, former Rodian bounty hunter.<br><br>If Natalie&#39;s older brother is called Bartholomew, or &#39;Erbert, or Michel-Saint-Germain, it makes very little difference.<br><br>A character is about their personality first and foremost. That can be informed by their species, abilities, and whatnot, and those attributes may even come first (&#39;Trandoshan&#39; does give a very clear idea there), but when you&#39;re trying to develop them into a useable character, you need to think about their personality, not the other stuff.<br><br>hS</p>

She’s a Suethor. Suethors are not normal. WE aren’t normal. We go into fanfictions and kill the characters, for Eru’s sake. How is anything remotely related to the PPC ‘normal’?” That feels kind of like a homage to the TOS line about &quot;We&#39;re evil. Miss Cam is evil. This is just stupid.&quot; or whatever.<br><br>-Ahaha, she drank the Mirror of Galadriel. Suvians just aren&#39;t as dumb these days, it&#39;s a shame.<br><br>-Wow, <i>half the mission</i> is the &#39;things go wrong&#39; part? You&#39;re right, we don&#39;t see the likes of that now.<br><br>-And then Manx gets beaten up. This is... violent.<br><br>-And Shadow somehow knows what&#39;s happening to her. I would be complaining quite a lot about this if the writer was active.

            <p>Do I even need to do the disclaimer anymore?<br><br><b>Rappaport&#39;s Law</b><br>By J.K. Rowling<br><br><i>In 1790, the fifteenth President of MACUSA, Emily Rappaport, instituted a law designed to create total segregation of the wizarding and No-Maj communities. This followed one of the most serious breaches of the International Statute of Secrecy, leading to a humiliating censure of MACUSA by the International Confederation of Wizards. The matter was that much more serious because the breach came from within MACUSA itself.<br><br>In brief, the catastrophe involved the daughter of President Rappaport’s trusted Keeper of Treasure and Dragots (the Dragot is the American wizarding currency and the Keeper of Dragots, as the title implies, is roughly equivalent to the Secretary of the Treasury). Aristotle Twelvetrees was a competent man, but his daughter, Dorcus, was as dim as she was pretty. She had been a poor student at Ilvermorny and at the time of her father’s ascension to high office was living at home, hardly ever performing magic, but concentrating mainly on her clothes, the arrangement of her hair and parties.<br><br>One day, at a local picnic, Dorcus Twelvetrees became greatly enamoured of a handsome No-Maj called Bartholomew Barebone. Unbeknownst to Dorcus, Bartholomew was a Scourer descendant. Nobody in his family was magic, but his belief in magic was profound and unshakeable, as was his conviction that all witches and wizards were evil.<br><br>Totally oblivious to the danger, Dorcus took Bartholomew’s polite interest in her ‘little tricks’ at face value. Led on by her beau’s artless questions, she confided the secret addresses of both MACUSA and Ilvermorny, along with information about the International Confederation of Wizards and all the ways in which these bodies sought to protect and conceal the wizarding community.<br><br>Having gathered as much information as he could from Dorcus, Bartholomew stole the wand she had obligingly demonstrated for him, showed it to as many pressmen as he could find, then gathered together armed friends and set out to persecute and, ideally, kill all the witches and wizards in the vicinity. Bartholomew further printed leaflets giving the addresses where witches and wizards congregated and sent letters to prominent No-Majs, some of whom felt it necessary to investigate whether there were indeed ‘evil occult parties’ happening at the places described.<br><br>Giddy with his mission to expose witchcraft in America, Bartholomew Barebone overstepped himself by shooting at what he believed were a group of MACUSA wizards, but which turned out to be No-Majs who had the bad fortune to leave a suspected building while he was watching it. Fortunately nobody was killed, and Bartholomew was arrested and imprisoned for the crime without any need for MACUSA involvement. This was an enormous relief to MACUSA who were struggling to cope with the massive fallout of Dorcus’s indiscretions.<br><br>Bartholomew had disseminated his leaflets widely, and a few newspapers had taken him seriously enough to print pictures of Dorcus’s wand and note that it ‘had a kick like a mule’ if waved. The attention focused on the MACUSA building was so intense that it was forced to move premises. As President Rappaport was forced to tell the International Confederation of Wizards at a public inquiry, she could not be sure that every last person privy to Dorcus’s information had been Obliviated. The leak had been so serious that the after-effects would be felt for many years.<br><br>Although many in the magical community campaigned to have her imprisoned for life or even executed, Dorcus spent only a year in jail. Thoroughly disgraced, utterly shellshocked, she emerged into a very different wizarding community and ended her days in seclusion, a mirror and her parrot her dearest companions.<br><br>Dorcus’s indiscretions led to the introduction of Rappaport’s Law. Rappaport’s Law enforced strict segregation between the No-Maj and wizarding communities. Wizards were no longer allowed to befriend or marry No-Majs. Penalties for fraternising with No-Majs were harsh. Communication with No-Majs was limited to that necessary to perform daily activities.<br><br>Rappaport’s Law further entrenched the major cultural difference between the American wizarding community and that of Europe. In the Old World, there had always been a degree of covert cooperation and communication between No-Maj governments and their magical counterparts. In America, MACUSA acted totally independently of the No-Maj government. In Europe, witches and wizards married and were friends with No-Majs; in America, No-Majs were increasingly regarded as the enemy. In short, Rappaport’s Law drove the American wizarding community, already dealing with an unusually suspicious No-Maj population, still deeper underground.</i><br><br>Tomorrow at the same time we&#39;ll be getting the last text. As we all can guess, it&#39;s gonna be about Ilvermorny.</p>

            <p>Things We&#39;ve Learned:<br><br>-Despite their purported anti-Pureblood tendencies, American wizarding families still have ludicrous names. I have difficulty believing Rappaport and (especially) Twelvetrees were common names in 1790s America.<br><br>-There was an International Confederation of Wizards in the 18th century, who were issuing Statutes. That&#39;s all extremely legalistic-sounding, and rather strange to boot. Hmm.<br><br>-MACUSA (I&#39;m still betting on them having renamed themselves a couple of decades prior to this) has a single central location, which seems really bizarre when you have teleportation. Why not just meet in fields by moonlight (har, har)?<br><br>-But, on the plus side, they&#39;re not sexist! Their fifteenth President (in 100 years, indicating elections and terms of 4-8 years - how very US-ian, despite starting a hundred years before it...) was female.<br><br>-American wizards are paranoid. The whole incident describes predates photography, so the &#39;they printed pictures&#39; thing refers to woodcuts and the like. So, yeah, a couple of papers published pictures of a stick and said it was super-magic - that <i>definitely</i> sounds like a good reason to entirely cut off communications with the No-Maj world! What a measured and reasonable response!<br><br>I think this comes from their history. American wizards come from three sources:<br><br>-Native wizards who were cast as devil-worshippers and cannibals by the colonials.<br>-Colonials who were fleeing persecution when they went to America, and who have only just (a century prior) gotten rid of their own internal KKK, after facing massive persecution from, like, everyone.<br>-Mentioned nowhere by Rowling but almost certainly there: black slaves.<br><br>That is a community <i>rife</i> with paranoia. Let&#39;s not forget that their own government is incredibly heavy-handed - it was formed on the principle of &#39;let&#39;s wipe out bloodlines we don&#39;t like&#39; (the Scourers), and has no qualms utterly uprooting families under Rappaport&#39;s Law. Oh, and that these are <i>US Americans</i> just after the War of Independence, a culture which was extremely pro-individual, anti-international - yet their magical government is acting on international obligations to enact massively anti-individual laws... yeah, I can totally see a paranoid culture developing out of this.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;Having gathered as much information as he could from Dorcus, Bartholomew stole the wand she had obligingly demonstrated for him, showed it to as many pressmen as he could find, then gathered together armed friends and set out to persecute and, ideally, kill all the witches and wizards in the vicinity. Bartholomew further printed leaflets giving the addresses where witches and wizards congregated and sent letters to prominent No-Majs, some of whom felt it necessary to investigate whether there were indeed ‘evil occult parties’ happening at the places described.&quot;<br><br><br>...He demonstrated the wand. The nonmagical guy, with no magical talent, demonstrated a wand. He must&#39;ve been a FANTASTIC orator to gather a bunch of suspicious people together, wave a stick around, and go &#39;Look! Magic!&#39;<br><br>Also, what pressmen. Seriously, I&#39;m taking a class on the history of newspapers and the New York Times in America, and guess what there really <i>wasn&#39;t</i> in 1790? An organized press! At that point in American history, due to the importance of pamphlets and other such writings during the revolution, laws were made protecting the public sphere - the right to a free press. This meant that basically anyone who could write (or dictate, I suppose) and pay for printing could make leaflets and talk about what they wanted. <br><br>There <i> were </i> newspapers at the time, but they would not have printed anything to do with magic - firstly, they normally carried very dry business news, and were aimed at merchants (what boats came in, what your goods are selling for) or political. Other than mailed-out broadsheets that were more or less gossip, there wasn&#39;t what we&#39;d recognize as a newspaper. The idea of newspapers writing to a wide audience, and about current events, really only start in the early-mid 1830s with the founding of the New York Sun and the New York Herald.<br><br>In short, by this point in time? There really was no organization of &#39;pressmen&#39; to be called together, Barebone had no credibility and no proof, and it&#39;s pretty likely that anyone who got one of his leaflets would just use it as kindling. <br><br><b> few newspapers had taken him seriously enough to print pictures of Dorcus’s wand and note that it ‘had a kick like a mule’ if waved.</b><br><br><b>pictures</b><br><br>Photojournalism. Did not start until the invention of the camera. Before then, some drawings WERE used, but they were incredibly rare, and the first illustrated paper started in <i>London</i> in <i>1842</i>. <br><br>&quot;Wizards were no longer allowed to befriend or marry No-Majs. Penalties for fraternising with No-Majs were harsh. Communication with No-Majs was limited to that necessary to perform daily activities.&quot;<br><br>...Really now. Let&#39;s look at a quote from yesterday.<br><br>&quot;. This meant a far higher percentage of No-Maj-born witches and wizards in the New World than elsewhere. While these witches and wizards often went on to marry and found their own all-magical families, the pure-blood ideology that has dogged much of Europe’s magical history has gained far less traction in America.&quot;<br><br>America&#39;s wizarding population was heavily muggle-born. At this point, there&#39;s no reason to think that it still isn&#39;t. So this person decides to outlaw ANY fraternization. THis might work ok for purebloods, but they are clearly the minority in America. This essentially requires American wizards to cut off all contact with their families. You want to send your brother a heartfelt letter on his birthday? That&#39;s fraternizing (literally!) with the muggles, off to jail with you. And of course, those Native American wizards who were actually parts of their tribes, apparently have to exile themselves now.<br><br>Something tells me that the MACUSA was not really a representative government. I&#39;m still having a hard time seeing it as anything other than the most isolationist and blueblooded wizards grabbing power and going &#39;yeah we&#39;re in charge now&#39; with no justification.</p>

            <p>I beg to differ. ^<em>^ It&#39;s difficult to prove (and I&#39;ve forgotten most of the specifics), but there&#39;s a bunch of anecdata suggesting that &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph</a></em>Smith&quot;&gt;Mormon founder Joseph Smith</a> was repeatedly featured in papers for his purported/claimed/accused &#39;magical&#39; acts. This is in the 1820s. It wasn&#39;t centralised newspapers, but local rags? Absolutely.<br><br>The piece also says that the wand &#39;kicked like a mule&#39; when waved. Have we ever seen a wand wielded by a Muggle before? Do we actually know whether they have some inbuilt magical effect? Even if it&#39;s something as simple as &#39;tries to make a Muggle wielder drop it&#39;, it&#39;d be obvious magic. (Or maybe the pressmen were Muggle-born and never spotted...?)<br><br>But yes, MACUSA was clearly in the grip of a paranoid overreaction. I&#39;m guessing (based on previous pieces) that they&#39;d only just reintegrated into the international community. They were the &#39;new kids&#39;, viewed as fairly useless anyway due to their inability to work with the newly-formed national government. They weren&#39;t about to do <i>anything</i> that might get them penalised by the International Confederation.<br><br>+1 vote for MACUSA being a wizarding power-grab. What d&#39;you want to bet Emily <s>Rassilon</s> Rappaport was also the 13th President, and the 11th, and the 9th...?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Ok but. When I say &#39;they wouldn&#39;t have printed anything about newspapers&#39; I meant that the mercantile and poltiical papers wouldn&#39;t have, except for possibly accusing Alexander Hamilton of being a witch. Sure, there could be gossip rags claiming that a stick the author had seen looked magic, but again. People could write pamphlets about ANYTHING. There was no obligation to the truth. Also, &#39;a few papers had taken him seriously enough to print pictures&#39; is... Well. Newspapers with regular circulation did not really work like that, at least the ones with enough cash behind them to print pictures. And again! Pictures were a RARE thing for the deaths of leaders of states and such. <br><br>I mean, I only skimmed over my book on the history of newspapers in America, but I still do not think that they existed in any way that would make this make sense. Not in the 1790s.</p>

            <p>Instead of thinking &#39;national papers&#39;, imagine Bart walking between rural communities, demonstrating the wand to whichever press-owners he thought most credulous (and remember, it&#39;s established that Americans are fairly likely to believe magic is real). It doesn&#39;t have to be more than a hand-press: if you&#39;ve got Bart&#39;s pre-written anti-magic screed, and quite possibly his pre-carved woodcut as well (why not? He&#39;s on a crusade, he can afford to get someone to cut a few of those!), you can print the danged things off and sell them for a... what&#39;s the currency back then? Looks like it was still the Continental Currency, which was pretty worthless.<br><br>I get the feeling JKR <i>thinks</i> he was publishing in the national papers, but I don&#39;t see anything that explicitly <i>says</i> it. For that matter, I don&#39;t see anything that indicates Bart had any kind of success - he riled up a few local big names to poke around in other people&#39;s houses (including the MACUSA building, which I&#39;m definitely seeing more as &#39;Rappaport&#39;s house&#39; than &#39;Congress&#39;), then shot a few people.<br><br>Rappaport overreacted. This is exactly the sort of local fuss the Old World dealt with all the time. &quot;We&#39;re not sure we Oblivated everyone <i>so let&#39;s secede</i>&quot; is not a reasonable response - it&#39;s either panic, or a canny politician seizing on the first opportunity to secure her own power against that of the new US government.<br><br>hS, quite clearly an anti-Rappaportist agitator</p>

            <p>Hm, OK, if he was walking from town to town I can see it. And yeah, I have been definitely seeing the MACUSA as an oligarchy grabbing power and using words associated with representative government. I just can&#39;t see the secession laws without also thinking that whoever wrote them didn&#39;t care at all about people who didn&#39;t want to drop off the face of the Earth. A politician securing her own power makes quite a bit of sense.</p>

            <p>Especially since the large amount of immigration into America would result in a lot of muggleborn wizards who would probably be quite put out if they were told they could no longer see their muggle friends and family, while the purebloods would be totally convinced that wizard contact with non-wizards was Evil and the Sign of the Apocalypse. <br><br>And meanwhile, half the country was growing to believe that making someone the property of another person was wrong, while the other half believed that not only was it right, their economy would collapse without it.<br><br>Yeah, I&#39;m joining the American-Civil-War-Was-Also-A-Wizarding-War camp.</p>
