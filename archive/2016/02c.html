            <p>Hello! <br><br>I recently discovered the PPC (I&#39;m not sure how; I think TV Tropes was involved), and I couldn&#39;t help but notice that you actually adhere to your Constitution. I would very much like to get to know such unusual people.<br><br>You can call me Key -- unless someone thinks of something better; my naming skills currently leave a lot to be desired. I&#39;m a girl, probably. I&#39;m 15 years old and live in the Pacific Time Zone (it&#39;s about 8:15 PM right now). A few of my main fandoms are Shakespeare, <u>Carry On</u> by Rainbow Rowell, <u>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell</u> by Susanna Clarke, and, to a lesser extent, Hetalia. I&#39;ve read everything the wiki recommended me to: the original series, and most of the FAQs (haven&#39;t gotten to the slash guide yet, but I figured it wasn&#39;t urgent). Please ask me questions if I&#39;ve missed any important introductory information.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PPC! (Sorry for the delay on getting to you, been a mite busy.)<br><br>Key is a fantastic name, so don&#39;t worry about your naming skills. <br><br>Excellent job on reading TOS, and even the FAQs! <br><br>Stick around, participate about the board, and feel free to ask questions if you&#39;ve got any- my email&#39;s clickable out of my name. It might take me some time to reply to that one, because I&#39;m currently out to sea, but go for it if you want to ask anything or just to chat. (This also goes to everyone else, for that matter.)<br><br>And as far as gifts go, once a long time ago I used to give bitemarks out, but people objected to being bitten, and after that, it was links to the wiki and such, but you covered that yourself. <br><br>So instead, this time you get a currently regionally appropriate camel!<br><br>-July</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t wait to get to know you! I don&#39;t particularly object to being bitten (I have a sister, so I got used to it long ago), but a camel is better. I think I&#39;ll name it Wendy (with my theoretically competent naming skills)(Up until I found the PPC Wiki entry for Cat-on-the-Keyboard names, I thought that mashing the keyboard until I got something I liked was the <i>only</i> way to name characters, hence my hesitance). <br><br>I actually do have a question: when Agents take Bleeprin and derived products, do they actually forget potentially scarring aspects of badfic, or does it just dull the pain? Do different Bleeprin derivatives behave differently as regards this? Do different authors write it differently? </p>

            <p>Camels bite. And also spit. Unfortunately. <br><br>(It&#39;s not necessasrily a <i>bad</i> way to get names.)<br><br>Ooh, that <i>is</i> a good question. There&#39;s a lot of leeway that can be taken in plenty of elements the PPC uses; I can&#39;t remember off the top of my head, which implies to me that it could be taken either way by the writer. I&#39;ve personally gone with the second.<br><br>Different bleep-derivatives all work the same way, generally, unless they&#39;re something extreme. What changes is method of consumption. <br><br>And yes, different authors write things differently; the main thing all spin-offs have to adhere to is TOS. After that, plenty of things can vary. My view of the PPC (and thus how I write it) doesn&#39;t line up entirely with, say, Neshomeh&#39;s or hS&#39;s or Scapegrace&#39;s, even though we can all draw connections between our works in some way or another.</p>

            <p>Well, I have people I want bitten and spat upon. . . maybe I can just <i>turn</i> the camel -- nope, doesn&#39;t work. Ow.<br><br>Thanks for clearing that up (or revealing its true, beautifully muddy state). I can see why people would go with the second; the agents take so much Bleeprin that it would be hard to keep track of which past events they actually remember. Plus, memory-wiping can be ethically sketchy. . . there&#39;s a lot of potential for abuse. It gives agents the ability to do horrible things to each other, provided they can figure out a way to get into the victim&#39;s food to spike it with a bleep-derivative. Under that interpretation, the cafeteria workers would basically be all-powerful. . . and no one would ever know.</p>

            <p>*I am buried under a pile of gifts.* Thank you all so much!<br><br>It&#39;s not mentioned in the wiki; what&#39;s the usual thing to <i>do</i> with these gifts? Is the normal thing to not refer to them outside of this thread? Or will people talk about various objects they&#39;ve obtained (for whatever reason) in roleplay scenarios (such as a Board party)? (I think the wiki mentioned roleplaying on the Board somewhere. . .) Also, if I were to eventually get permission and write an agent who was my avatar, would it make sense/be okay for them to have some of the things I was given (say, the Black Cloak of Swirly Awesomeness)? These gifts got me thinking; I&#39;m tempted to write a story about every single one. Especially the Cloak. (I like cloaks. Writing about them, drawing them, wearing them. . .)</p>

            <p>I remember people writing their newbie gifts into their spinoffs, so that&#39;s definitely possible. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too common, though — you&#39;re not an Agent; you&#39;re a Boarder. <br><br>As to roleplaying, well. Aside from stuff that happens (or is supposed to happen) with some sort of regularity, like <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Plort">Plort threads</a> or the Agent Mailbox game, RPs pop up every once in a while. Sometime someone wants a wider cast in an interlude, somtimes it&#39;s just for fun. Unless otherwise noted, you don&#39;t need Permission to participate in an RP, and in fact it&#39;s a good way to get a grasp on a character.</p>

And the drama is kind of what made me decide to introduce myself -- everything is tense, yes, and zero punches are being pulled, but people are still being polite, constructive, and empathetic. Which is cool. I am excited. <br><br>I&#39;ve read a lot of PPC spinoffs in a short period of time, and I can&#39;t remember which author goes with which story goes with which agent. . . .

One feels-like-five, don&#39;t-drop-it-on-your-toe book. Plus shadowy rumors about a sequel-in-progress). I watched the BBC adaptation, and I thought it did a good job of keeping the spirit of the book, but I&#39;m not as attached to the fandom jokes as a lot of people are. I think it&#39;s kind of like The Princess Bride: the screen version is amazing and inspires love everywhere it goes, but the book is STILL so much better because it has a snarky narrator who goes off on tangents which are impossible to include in the screen version. (Here&#39;s hoping Netflix&#39;s A Series of Unfortunate Events fits this pattern *fingers crossed*.) <br><br>Carry On <i>is</i>, in its simplest form, a love letter to Harry Potter fanon. . . but it&#39;s so much more than that. For one thing, one of the main characters is basically Edward Cullen rewritten as a sympathetic, well-developed, lovable character. And the World of Mages <i>is</i> comparable to the wizarding world, but it&#39;s also comparable to France in the late 18th century, if you take my meaning. Also, the main characters are boys, but the book passes any test of feminism you&#39;d care to give it. And I&#39;m not going to gush about it here. But you really should read it. You all should read it. *smiles sheepishly and backs away, almost tripping over what I could&#39;ve sworn was a kitten. I turn around and am convinced that I scoop it up and pet it.*</p>

            <p>I recently saw this posted on Scott Lynch&#39;s Tumblr: &quot;Also, I believe it’s important to cut me out of the fanfic approval loop. When you write fanfic about my worlds or characters, you should be completely ignoring the questions of what I’d want or what I’d do. Fanfic is your chance to go happily nuts with the elements of my stuff that you like, seasoned with elements that serve your own fascinations and pleasures. I’m flattered that you might like to run your fanfic by me, but really, I am immaterial to it. Embrace the freedom to make it for yourself and your fellow readers in a canon-free environment.&quot; (Scott Lynch, some of you may know, is the author responsible for the Gentleman Bastard sequence and the Queen of the Iron Sands online novel.)<br><br>I found it interesting because it basically runs contrary to the PPC&#39;s view on canon and its importance in fanfiction, because it basically says &quot;Fanfiction is about having fun, don&#39;t worry about canon, do what you want.&quot;</p>

            <p>Okay, I’ve been thinking about this a lot since you posted it, particularly your note at the bottom. From what I’ve seen of the PPC, our philosophy does not run counter to Lynch’s statement. If the PPC believed that deviation from canon was intrinsically bad, we would have no concept of goodfic. No fanfic will perfectly fit the canon, since fanfic is, by definition, not canon. From the missions and wiki articles I’ve read, the PPC seems to primarily target bad writing. Going “happily nuts with the elements [. . .] that you like” does not mean it’s acceptable to put zero effort into writing good characters or be too lazy to use comprehensible grammar and expect praise for your writing skills. Nor does it make it ethical to spread dangerous misconceptions about what makes a healthy relationship, how women “should” behave, or basic anatomy. Nor does it make it okay to write a completely unrelated story and name your OCs after characters from whatever canon they most resemble in an attempt to attract more people to your story (I swear people do this). <br><br>Notably, Lynch does not say there should be <i>no</i> fanfiction approval loop; he just wants to be left out of it. “Completely ignoring the questions of what [the creator would] want” does not mean completely ignoring the questions of what your audience wants. Readers generally want stories which are legible, don’t reinforce thought patterns which can endanger them, and aren’t cynical and manipulative (I do, anyway. This opinion is seconded by my sister). And if you’re claiming that something is fanfiction, your readers are probably expecting it to bear at least a passing resemblance to the canon, or at least to be related to it in an interesting way. If you promise the reader (for example) that a character is in the story, you are breaking that promise if none of the characters in the story bear a resemblance to that character. The PPC deals with the relationship between fanfiction authors and their readers. The relationship between canon creators and their fanfiction authors is dealt with by the creators’ lawyers.<br><br>(Also, the more I reread this quote, the more it seems like the author just wants people to stop sending him their fanfiction and is trying to be polite about it.)<br><br>Aaaaaand I just wrote this instead of working on my history project. I wonder if my teacher will let me turn it in for partial credit?</p>

            <p>Remember that the departments have names like <b>Bad</b> Slash, <b>Implausible</b> Crossovers, and <b>Improbable</b> AUs. The PPC as an organisation has never had a problem with fanfic that deviates from the canon plot - just with fanfic that <i>breaks</i> the canon/plot continuum.<br><br>A story in which [Rolls canon-selection dice] Rey, Finn, and Poe are street urchins in Ankh-Morpork can be a good story, and be ignored by the PPC - provided those characters act the way they would if they&#39;d been born into that situation. It&#39;s only when that story starts with Rey murdering Leia to steal her stuff, and Poe using BB-8 (who&#39;s a swamp dragon in this) as a football, that the PPC&#39;s attention is drawn - not because of the story being AU, but because the AU <i>doesn&#39;t make sense</i>.<br><br>The canon plot is not sacred; fanfic can change it. Even characterisation can be altered and still leave a good story. But whatever you do, you need to be able to explain and <i>justify</i> it, in terms of what we know about the canon.<br><br>Otherwise, it&#39;s not fanfiction.

            <p>Key&#39;s points are good, but there&#39;s one other thing to bear in mind: the fact that fanon can only become canon if you <i>don&#39;t</i> send the author your work. Let&#39;s say that for the sake of argument you send Rick Riordan a fanfic detailing... Iunno, a Yoruba pantheon and its characters interacting with the existing demigods, Legacies, &amp;c. Now say, quite by chance, Riordan is writing a new series based around the Yoruba pantheon. If he publishes then it&#39;s theoretically possible, depending on how good of a lawyer you have, that the fanfic author could wrest the rights of the series away from Riordan.<br><br>And this is a Not Good Very Bad Thing.</p>

            <p>Except in the PPC, but that&#39;s because, if it didn&#39;t, there would be no reason for the PPC to go killing Sues and exorcising canons. <br><br>And I highly disagree with the status quo bit.

            <p>There was a book that I pulled off of the Library&#39;s &#39;new books&#39; shelf in the 90&#39;s.  I didn&#39;t know about fanfiction at the time, save for Star Trek novellas.  <br><br>Star Trek had a rule that the books didn&#39;t influence the series and the characters snapped back afterwards.  I still have a head-canon that Diane Duane got Spock&#39;s birth right and that the movie version was some twisted illusion. <br><br>Back to the book I found, I wasn&#39;t familiar with the series.  At the end, it had some deus ex machina erasing their memories and one of the characters complaining that it wasn&#39;t fair to have an adventure that they couldn&#39;t remember.  The other character got a new sword and callously renamed it because he never used a sword that wasn&#39;t named {Blah.}<br><br>My favorite scene was when the fencer had to use the {two-handed heavy sword} and the other character complained about wielding a sewing needle.  <br><br>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth going onto the tropes media identification page.<br><br>--Brandi is still thinking.</p>

            <p>Widespread bad fanon can actually damage -- not the canon itself, but the way people view the canon. For example, characters in Hetalia are usually very well developed, but many have aggressive bad fanon versions (e.g. ZoophilicWorkaholic!Germany, StereotypicalDragQueen!Poland, InterchangeableRapists!France and Prussia, to name only a few of my least favorite), which many in the fandom see as their true personalities. This is why I’ve been withdrawing from the fandom: the badfic was warping my personal enjoyment of the continuum  (what if Germany <i>does</i> have sex with his dogs?). The PPC’s depiction of the nature of fanfic is silly and not how it works in reality, but it&#39;s not completely unfounded. </p>

            <p>But on the flip side: if you&#39;re <i>not</i> going to try and stick reasonably close to canon, why&#39;re you writing <b>fan</b>fiction at all? I can write a story where Harry Potter is an aggressive reporter whose cleaner is a shy, slender man named Legolas (and then, one assumes, they do the sex)... but since those characters bear no resemblence to Harry Potter and Legolas, I might as well name them Herbert Rankine and Alfredo and make it original fiction.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS<br><br>I&#39;ve re-written the ending to this mission - the agents now kill the Suvians separately, and I&#39;ve also revised the execution of Not!Sans so that it&#39;s less of a direct fight and more of a diversion + sneak attack, which hopefully works much better. I&#39;ve also gotten rid of any mention of Flowey aside from his one appearance in the original fic, because as fun as it is to imagine Terri having to nerualyze him, his appearance in the original ending pretty much hinged on helping the agents out of a tight spot. The Suvians being killed the way they are in the new ending pretty much eliminates any excuse for him to show up.<br><br>So... yeah.

I will address that as soon as I get back from work today.<br><br>And as for the fight with the Suvians, I framed it as though the agents had little choice on the matter. The entire point of the climax was to separate the Suvians as has been stated before - it&#39;s just that the replacement wouldn&#39;t have any of it. I could change it up too if such is not to people&#39;s liking, though.</p>

Problem solved!”<br>“* Not!Sans will kill us. We have to take both of them out at once or I doubt we’ll survive.”<br><br>Both of them at once? Why not focus on finding an opportunity to get Not!Sans far away from the Sue (like getting them in different locations), charging and killing Not!Sans, then killing the Sue after? In the chapter in which the agents decided to kill her, the Suvians later meet at Grillby&#39;s and decided they needed some space from each other, so Not!Sans went home while the Sue went to Alphys&#39; house. You should explain why they couldn&#39;t wait for them to do that.<br><br>You should also explain what&#39;s so dangerous about killing the Sue later, because the thing about having to &quot;take both of them out at once&quot; implies that somehow the Sue will successfully kill them by herself. As far as I read in the badfic, she &quot;was in cheerleading for a year&quot;. Can a human with a year of cheerleading compare to a monster who can manipulate gravity and summon bones and laser-firing skulls? Or was it something else?</p>

I think your <i>author&#39;s note</i> is wrong in saying that Flowey should know about the PPC, but what&#39;s in the <i>mission</i> is that he knows about them because, well, he was there when they arrived, and he noticed they&#39;re not normally there, and he&#39;s probably been following them. Then he blindsided them and vanished before they could do anything. Agents do muck up on their missions sometimes, and I&#39;m happy for Terri to be sent in to try and neuralyse him afterwards. (Whether she succeeds or not is up to the next person to write the continuum).<br><br>Where I think she massively understated things is the fight. Skarmory: <i>Undertale</i> is an entire game built around giving you the option to <b>not</b> fight people.

I get that it would be difficult to find a good opportunity to try and kill the Sue and Not!Sans, but I&#39;m finding it odd that the agents didn&#39;t at least talk about a way to split them up, charge and kill Not!Sans without giving him the chance to fight back. I might have missed the conversation but I didn&#39;t find any conversation like that.<br><br>2. Flowey&#39;s status as a deity-like being in this mission is my main issue.<br><br>To address a point:<br><br>&quot;However, Flowey knows about how to SAVE and RESET and, for the longest time, he’s used everyone else as playthings until he got bored of doing so. I’m guessing he’s probably one of the closest things that Undertale has to an actual deity, and at the very least his meta skills have rendered him practically omniscient.&quot;<br><br>Why would that justify Flowey knowing about the PPC? So he knows how to SAVE and RESET like in a videogame. Is that supposed to mean he can&#39;t be dealt with by way of neuralyzation? Would his SAVE and RESET abilities or any of his meta skills erase any neuralyzation done to him? <br><br>On practical omniscience, I&#39;ll quote Huinesoron here: &quot;Practical omniscience =/= true omniscience. Any method of omniscience that isn&#39;t simply They Just Know By Magic is spoofable by the PPC.&quot; Unless you consider Flowey&#39;s meta skills Knowing By Magic.<br><br>3. A nitpicky one: Not!Sans&#39; dialogue format resembling more like Canon!Sans than the badfic&#39;s Sans. <br>Not!Sans was not Sans, so why go through the trouble of changing the font for an impostor?</p>

            <p>Apologies if I&#39;m simply exposing my ignorance here, but it seems like a pretty basic thing that people should know.<br><br>That said, I&#39;m not averse to creating an article for it, since we stress the importance of the concept pretty heavily. However, we already have an article about <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Characterization">characterization</a>, and I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a useful distinction between the two.

            <p>The more I think about it, the more I&#39;m finding distinctions to make. Maybe I&#39;ll retool the Characterization article to be about the process of creating/writing a character (i.e. an out-of-universe perspective) and write a Personality article to be about the traits that make up an individual&#39;s character from an in-universe perspective.<br><br>I&#39;d say a personality is assumed to be complex whereas characterization doesn&#39;t have to be. You can have 1, 2, and 3-dimensional characters, but you don&#39;t generally hear about 1, 2, or 3-dimensional personalities, right?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>That&#39;s what I call it when a writer creates a character with so much less characterization than their role in the plot that you could put a cardboard cutout in their place and nobody would notice the difference.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what the charge itself is called--perhaps an agent would call it &quot;Forcing Generics into main-character roles&quot;, or just &quot;bad characterization&quot;.<br><br>A notable example of a cardboard cutout from a Legendary is, of course, laura. She has no personality whatsoever, but is the main character in the story.<br><br>laura&#39;s amount of characterization would be appropriate in a well-written story only for a Generic--those characters in crowd scenes who never get speaking parts. She wouldn&#39;t even make a good bit character!<br><br>The Bad Psychology article touches on this: People have to act in consistent ways. Not necessarily rational ways, but your characters have to do the things they do because they are who they are. And if you don&#39;t know enough about who they are to figure out what they will do, then that&#39;s not enough characterization. The more they&#39;ll do in your story, the better you have to define their personality.<br><br>In the PPCverse, people who have bit parts in goodfic or canon are full-blown people. You only see small parts of their personality in the story, but it&#39;s all there. That&#39;s because good writing gives you the idea that whatever part of their personality you can see, it&#39;s part of a coherent whole. These characters are sentient in the sci-fi sense--full people whatever their species.<br><br>However, poorly-described badfic characters don&#39;t have a coherent personality or don&#39;t have enough of a personality to begin with, so they are more like cardboard cutouts than people. That&#39;s why most Assassins don&#39;t consider themselves murderers; they&#39;re not killing people, only crude facsimiles of people or distorted eldritch abominations that try to pretend to be people, but fail at it.<br><br>Many badfic characters try to shore up the rickety structure of their personalities by patching it with details. Instead of motive and identity, these characters have flowery physical descriptions, powers and abilities, or even trajeck backstories. But beneath it all, there&#39;s no actual person to be found.</p>

            <p>That personality is a <i>part</i> of characterisation, but not the whole deal. I mean, take iconic weapons, for example. Off the top of my head, Cloud Strife&#39;s Buster Sword is a part of his characterisation, but isn&#39;t a part of his personality, per se. Ditto for Sherlock&#39;s deerstalker and opium pipe. </p>

            <p>As you guys know, I&#39;m a big fan of speculative evolution. However, I recently found something that I think deserves our attention. Behold, the worst speculative evolution project imaginable!<br><br><a href="http://speculativeevolution.wikia.com/wiki/Category:New_Pleistocene"><a href="http://speculativeevolution.wikia.com/wiki/Category:New_Pleistocene">http://speculativeevolution.wikia.com/wiki/Category:New_Pleistocene</a></a><br><br>Don&#39;t be fooled by the name-the writer for this has dumped in any species he could think of, fictional or otherwise, from dinosaurs to vampires to Godzilla to Megaman robots. Basically, this is Rise of The Galeforces-level crossover shenanigans right here. None of the species are given good reason for why they evolved, the spelling is awful, and Mary Sue species are EVERYWHERE.<br><br>Seeing as speculative evolution is essentially fanfiction for life itself, and this project features a ton of crossovers, I figured that if this doesn&#39;t fit the bill for a speculative evolution badfic, nothing will. As such, I would like to claim this... thing for use as a first mission. I&#39;m almost done with my writing samples, and I should be done with the Permission prerequisites sometime this week.</p>

            <p>Erm, Bass.EXE? That is a species of creature now? This is like reading a D&amp;D creature manual, with all it&#39;s supernatural beasts and making you feel kinda insignificant. I also think .EXE is lowercase, isn&#39;t it? I could see agents coming into this world when An RA malfunctions while they&#39;re trying to get to world one. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have ourselves a new multiverse.</p>

            <p>...is that I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a story to go with it. If we have only the information about the world and creatures to go on, I have doubts that it would make an interesting mission because it may be just the agents going around and free-roaming the place like a sandbox game. It&#39;d be weird as hell, sure, but probably not quite the same as following an actual plot.<br><br>That being said, this sounds like the kind of thing the DOGA would tackle.

            <p>The PPC is meant to deal with fanfiction, yes? Speculative evolution is, by definition, original work. Unless the author is bunging in monsters from other media, I don&#39;t really see how it&#39;s any of our business, and even if that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing the link is rather tenuous. =/</p>

            <p>The creatures that were basically yanked out of their own continua would be returned home, while the species that aren&#39;t that bad could be brought into the DMFF.

            <p>First off, having two or three agents enact extinction events across the entire planet? That raises too many logical conundrums in my mind. What if they miss something? Where would the PPC put an entire noncanonical species? Why wouldn&#39;t the agents do the sensible thing and just have this obviously AU Earth destroyed?<br><br>That brings me to my second point. Having this be &quot;fanfiction&quot; of World One makes me a bit uncomfortable. World One really should not be involved in the doings of the PPC (beyond the various agent-delivering plot holes). It has no plot to be protected. Also, like Huinesoron said, &quot;fanfic&quot; of World One is typically considered original fiction. As much as it might gall us, we don&#39;t touch original fiction.<br><br>Finally, I should note that there is no story to mock. You&#39;re essentially asking to spork Wiki pages. I&#39;m not saying it couldn&#39;t be done, but I do question both why it should be done and if the end result would be any good.</p>

First things first was deciding how large I wanted the collar to be, and we settled on twenty inches across the shoulder so I would have enough excess space even while wearing my bulky robes <s>which have not been made yet but that&#39;ll be soon, shush, proper fabric is hard to find</s>.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yeRwLTx.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/yeRwLTx.png"> <br>For whatever godforsaken reason, we decided to print the pattern off on regular printer paper and try to use teh mathz to scale it appropriately.<br><br>Funnily enough?<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EGf8Geo.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/EGf8Geo.png"> <br>It worked.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KKFrsIj.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/KKFrsIj.png"> <br>(Also, the collar is a lot smaller than you&#39;d expect a Big Stupid Collar to be. Weird. But when you look at it for a <a href="https://soipondered.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/timelords.jpg">size comparison</a>... yeah. Big Stupid Collars are still Big and Stupid, just not as big as I thought.)<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DYkB1JB.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/DYkB1JB.png"> <br>We got a bit cleverer when making the front pattern; we blew up the pattern and printed it off on several different sheets, cut them out, and taped them together to get the needed shape. Much easier than eyeballing!<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wMMEiJL.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/wMMEiJL.png"> <br>Mom had some leftover foam from her Iron Man build, so we dug that out of storage and traced the pattern on. Since the foam&#39;s got a funky textured side (and it&#39;s a bit floppy on its own anyway), we&#39;ll be double layering it.<br><br>Size check!<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Zy4nLGr.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/Zy4nLGr.png"> <br>Aww yeah, looking good.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8hJImgS.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/8hJImgS.png"> <br>The aforementioned double layering.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/goC4sRh.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/goC4sRh.png"> <br>For the front pieces, we used thinner foam to cover the textured bit because we need it to be flexible enough to fit together with the back. While hot gluing it together, we molded the pieces so they were nice and curved.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/20aFTLV.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/20aFTLV.png"> <br>Like so.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xY7LWQc.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/xY7LWQc.png"> <br>There&#39;s the collar so far!

            <p>Both mom and I came down with a stomach bug the last two days, preventing us from working on the collar. :/ But we&#39;re both feeling better now, and have spent most of the day working on the costume!<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Wkgpzqy.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/Wkgpzqy.png"> <br>Our first task of the day was getting out the dremel to smooth down the rough edges of the foam. The dremel caused our hands to turn grey and red from the fine dust it was leaving in its wake—good thing we wore respirators.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kr0bdOY.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/kr0bdOY.png"> <br>(Obligatory &quot;Are you my mummy?&quot; joke goes here.)<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o90btHN.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/o90btHN.png"> <br>We also needed to shave down the inner edge of the collar so it would fit together in a nicer seam.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FnDRRmT.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/FnDRRmT.png"> <br>I... did my best to get a picture of what we did there.<br><br>Anyway, after lots and lots of sanding, it was at long last time to get the pieces put together!<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/W0DSfnt.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/W0DSfnt.png"> <br>There was no way I could&#39;ve done this by myself; forcing the foam to cooperate was definitely a two-person job. But we kept pushing on and at long last, prevailed!<br><br>I couldn&#39;t wait to try it on.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TlNO0PY.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/TlNO0PY.png"> <br>Needless to say, it didn&#39;t quite fit. So it was back out to the garage, where we got the heat gun and molded the pieces. Again.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1Td7Ge6.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/1Td7Ge6.png"> <br>Much better. :D<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8fA7EHx.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/8fA7EHx.png"> <br>And now it&#39;s time to put on a thin layer of glue to seal the foam before painting! Without the glue, the collar would be riddled with tiny pockmarks courtesy of the heat gun. This will make it nice and smooth for painting <s>hopefully</s> tomorrow.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7SaZU7d.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/7SaZU7d.png"> <br>I used a regular brush to slap the glue on and a sponge brush to make sure there weren&#39;t any massive brush lines left behind when it dried.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GXUEDyW.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/GXUEDyW.png"> <br>And that&#39;s the exterior done!</p>

            <p>Real life has been up and down. Meanwhile, Cyba and Eagrus have been on hiatus because I have been diverting all creative power to an original project. The duo were originally missioning during a period of writer&#39;s block, which got ironed out.

            <p>Sergio? Canonically stated to be a bad singer, and he never bothered to try to learn to play something.<br><br>Nikki I think still remembers how to play the recorder, but that was school-related stuff that she isn&#39;t following up. Probably a decent enough singer, but that isn&#39;t anything she practices either.<br><br>Corolla would be actually pretty good with an electronic keyboard... it helps when it would be an holographic electronic keyboard that&#39;s actually a subprogram of... well, herself. Not so good with signing - her singing voice feels &quot;artificial&quot; like a badly set up Hatsune Miku.</p>

I’m encountering some problems, though.<br><br>First: I don’t have enough agents who’d work for it.<br><br>Valon and Kala are the only agents I can really see as being good for MST. Chakkik’s too serious, Stephanie’s supply of jokes is limited, Adéle would have traumatic flashbacks in some fics, and the rest of my characters (Gabby, Zeke, Publica) aren’t developed enough.<br><br>Second: I don’t have enough time for cowrites.<br><br>For those not in the know, I have only two hours of access time a day when I’m at home. With other people dealing with time zones, work, school, and just plain having other things to do, cowrites are hard now. Just ask Silenthunder; we’ve been trying to cowrite a mission, but I never have enough time to write when she gets out of school. There’s a library in walking distance, but then I have to worry about their operating hours.<br><br>Third: I don’t know how to keep canons in-character.<br><br>This is the only thing I feel that anyone can help with. I know that some MSTers drag canon characters along for the ride (Laburnum, Sergio Turbo, PoorCynic), but when I try to write them… I dunno, they don’t feel right to me. This is actually the main reason I don’t write fanfic at all: I can’t trust myself to not let my personality infect canonical characters. I’m not sure if I just don’t know the characters well enough, or if I have a different problem.<br><br>Does anyone have any advice?</p>

            <p>But I can always point you out to <a href="http://das-sporking.livejournal.com/">Das Sporking</a>. I especially recommend you the Fifty and Twilight sporkings, since they also include canon characters being... drafted for the sporking. It should give you a pretty good idea of how this is done.</p>

            <p>... is that they&#39;re <i>really</i> easy to cowrite.<br><br>They consist of every line of a story, split up for comments where the writers want to split them. So open up a Google Doc, copy the text of the story in, and then... start commenting on any lines that you think deserve a comment.<br><br>You don&#39;t need to be on at the same time. If you want to reply to something your coauthor said - reply to it! And then reply to their other comment three paragraphs down, and then make several of your own on uncommented lines, and then go back and add another reply somewhere earlier.<br><br>MST writing is - or can be - amazingly non-linear.

            <p>1: Make some new characters. An MST is not exactly a PPC exclusive thing, so you have some additional choice here, too.<br><br>2: Get someone to write sections of it without you, and leave notes for them at the end. Repeat for you. If you have phone access, you could send them Skype messages or something as well. Don&#39;t really know your timezone, so I&#39;m not sure if the last one could work.<br><br>3: Yeah, that&#39;s a more common problem than some people think. I never stop tweaking any canons I write, since they never seem quite right. Fortunately, having a bunch of collaborative editors around can help you here. I find that canons end up feeling a lot more well done once you have other people tweak them. It gives you free advertising, as well, since the people you have editing will likely spread word of the MST, getting you more readers quickly.<br><br>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>1) You don&#39;t necessarily have to MST with PPC-related characters. If you want to, you can always use it as a method to develop your less-developed ones. If not, well, you can do anything from just snarking at the fic like <a href="http://astra-aurora.livejournal.com/47688.html">Astral Void did when she sporked <i>50 Shades of Grey</i></a> (sporking of NSFW squicky material) to writing completely new characters for the task.<br>2) Well, what seemed to work for me and SeaTurtle for &quot;Grey Area&quot; was that I&#39;d write a line (paragraph, whatnot), say &quot;tag&quot; in a comment or whatever, then he&#39;d do the same. Rinse, repeat. <br>3) Can&#39;t help you there; I don&#39;t think I ever wrote a canon character (in an RP — didn&#39;t make any attempt at a fic) in a way that felt OK to me.</p>

            <p>To all my fellow bronies in the PPC: Have you ever wondered why we never figured out who Cadence&#39;s parents are? Why we don&#39;t see anything about Twilight Sparkle&#39;s parents outside that flashback from Twilight&#39;s entrance exam? Or how Pinkie Pie is able to seemingly break the laws of physics?<br><br>If you did, did you ever imagine that it would take a <i>Mass Effect</i> crossover to explain it all?<br><br>Behold: <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/20545/mass-effect-2---dlc-the-equestrian-equation">Mass Effect 2: DLC - The Equestrian Equation</a>. <br><br>It is an excellently-written MLP/Mass Effect crossover that I haven&#39;t even finished yet (so that should tell you how good it is) that even a non-brony can follow without much difficulty. (One may argue that I should mention a third canon, but that would be MASSIVE spoilers.)<br><br>When it was originally written, the author would leave choices every now and again, just like in normal Mass Effect games; the readers could then &quot;vote&quot; on which alternative to choose via the comments. The story has long been completed and the choices set in stone, but I believe that that was a good touch.<br><br>So if you are interested, give it a read!</p>

            <p>If it my original work I typically use 2-3 main drafts before constant minor alterations.  If it is piece of fanfiction typically I do a draft then alterations.  <br><br>It comes down to the fact that my drafts are completely different.

            <p>To be honest, up until recently having a straight draft and not just something that I repeatedly tweaked was a pretty recent thing for me; it&#39;s much harder to keep on tweaking when you&#39;re writing on paper. You just have to keep going. (Which might explain the relative amount of productiveness I&#39;ve squeezed out lately.)<br><br>But truly, that&#39;s the point of drafts- to have something to rework and tweak into a better story with the next version. <br><br>With Stormbreak, for example, I wrote the vast majority in a tiny notebook that could fit into my pocket, whenever I thought I had the time or could sneak in a few sentences. Sometimes this was in the dark (protip: Avoid doing that when you can). <br><br>Afterwards, I&#39;d retype what I had into my tablet, generally in large chunks so I&#39;d get a page or three typed up at a time. <br><br>Between the amount of time it took, progression in the story in the notebook itself, and being unable to read some of my handwriting (each section would usually get a small label that&#39;d tell me a quick summary), I&#39;d change things to suit later details and keep the pace how I wanted it to go once it hit the actual point of being typed. <br><br>Whenever we hit a port and I got wifi, I&#39;d sync it so it could get read and have discrepencies and other errors pointed out, at which point I&#39;d change the things that caused those issues. <br><br>So the published version is closer to about... two and a half drafts of work.<br><br>I&#39;m also finding out that working with an outline- even the most limited of ones- actually helps make it go a lot faster when it comes to not writing myself into a knot and keeping things going apace. </p>

            <p>Once I&#39;ve written out a story, I force myself to wait at least a week without actually touching it.  Then, I reread the entire thing in one go, correcting errors as I go and making notes about anything that needs to change.  Then I look at all the things in my notes, and rework those sections of the story as best I can.<br><br>Then, I wait another week and reread the whole story again, then repeat the revision process.  The week-long waits are to make me lose familiarity with my story, so I don&#39;t tend to skim as much, and am forced to examine each sentence more closely.<br><br>After this revision is usually when I start seeking out betas, assuming I&#39;m happy with the product at this point.<br><br>Depending on whether the particular story is something I can work on easily from work (which isn&#39;t often; my workplace is a zoo, after all), I may write out an earlier draft on paper there and transfer it to computer at home later.  I&#39;ve found this is also useful for catching mistakes and fixing issues, since I have to copy literally every word over again.<br><br>—doctorlit is made of anal-retention and precision</p>

            <p>...I don&#39;t think pedophilia is one of the things it deals with; even if sexuality is a pretty common theme in the games, including a lot of the monsters looking like naked people, almost everyone involved was probably legal or older. Which is why to me, the way this fic tried to sexualize a SEVEN-YEAR-OLD-GIRL (or whatever age Dora is in canon) was so, SO much worse. D:</p>

            <p>OK, I never thought I would ever hear the phrase &#39;Sex God Pyramid Head&#39; in my lifetime, but there you go.<br><br>*Ahem*<br><br>This is almost definitely a replacement of Pyramid Head. The canonical character is honestly more of a manifestation of the player character&#39;s psyche than anything else, and is specific to that one character in particular. Since Silent Hill is a manifestation of that character&#39;s mind, the very fact that Dora is even [i]in[/i] the town, a world created by the shattered mind of a broken man, is a massive charge.<br><br>But we can use this to our advantage: Pyramid Head also seems to act as an executioner of wicked humans (At least, according to the wiki). My idea for getting rid of the replacement? Just portal the real Pyramid Head in front of the replacement and let the canon character disembowel him. And for the love of canon, get it on film.<br><br>Also, those &#39;seamen&#39; that Sex God Pyramid Head was covered by will need to be neuralyzed and sent somewhere, too-World One will do fine.</p>

            <p>...I get the feeling I probably shouldn&#39;t spork this fic myself, for two reasons. The first is that the fic itself is pretty short, only four chapters and not much in the way of subject matter despite all that prose. (A matter of personal taste, of course - I did spork a 2-chapter fic once, and also one with chapters that were literally just short paragraphs.)<br><br>Secondly, and more importantly, I point-blank refuse to touch ANYTHING involving straight-up pedophilia. Even if I COULD get a story out of something this short, I&#39;ve already seen the back end of a couple of nasty fics and I&#39;ve had to scrounge a bit for mission-worthy content for some of them. Sadly, for my taste, a monstrous character replacement intending to bang a freaking <b>seven-year-old</b> offers absolutely no humor-worthy material at all, and worse yet, there&#39;s not much else besides exactly that in this fic. If anyone else is courageous enough to try their luck with it, I&#39;d be happy to see the outcome, but I just don&#39;t think I can make an interesting mission out of it.<br><br>Besides, I don&#39;t have or plan to have a WhatThe team, and my DIC team would probably want my head on a pole if I sent them something this traumatizing. XD<br><br>(Also, for future reference, please tag posts mentioning NSFW content as such in the subject line. We&#39;re trying to keep this a family-friendly place and in all honesty our underage peers could do without any unpleasant surprises. ^^;)</p>

            <p>The way the town works in Silent Hill is that it punishes you with the contents of your mind, all your past sins, the things you&#39;re still beating yourself up for day after day, deep down. The effect I can see this having on Dora the Explorer is, to quote <i>Men In Black</i>, precisely dick. So the mission in this is, well, Dora having an adventure in a happy little seaside town in New England somewhere.</p>

            <p>I was messing around on the Protectorate of Plort map, and I decided to test one of the most powerful horses known in minecraft, with a command block. This command was originally devised by a guy named Direranger50 on a LOtR server, in which he was trying to create a steed faster than Edward_Blum&#39;s horse, which was appropriately named &quot;Sanic&quot;. I have adapted it to work in 1.8, and I dare you to try tame this thing. I believe this thing can be truly named &quot;Shadowfax&quot;; it ran across Plort in less than 20 seconds. Here is the command:<br> /summon EntityHorse ~0 ~1 ~0 {Attributes:[{Name:generic.maxHealth,Base:1000.000},{Name:generic.movementSpeed,Base:2.0},{Name:horse.jumpStrength,Base:99.0}],Type:0,Tame:1,SaddleItem:{id:329}} <br><br>Note: Even with a movement speed of 2, this horse will still run at absurd speeds, i.e., faster than my framerate. This horse must be spawned in tame, or else it will be impossible to catch, much less ride.<br><br>What do you think?</p>

            <p>I honestly haven&#39;t read any yet...But does OFUs count? I mean, in the wiki those stories were there so...<br><br>As for my fandoms? Hetalia - Axis Powers is my favorite, mostly because to make an OC for that particular fandom you have to research lots or risk offending the masses of history nerds AKA Hetalia fans.

Try a Modest one and give it EVs in Special Attack and Speed, with a couple in HP, then give it Calm Mind, Psyshock, Signal Beam, and Power Gem - the last works really well at dealing with things like Murkrow.

            <p>Earlier today- by which I mean late in the night- I was doing some preliminary stuff for both doodles and other things, and realized that I hadn&#39;t really thought about all my PPC characters&#39; heights, outside of how they immediately relate to a few of the others on a one on one basis.<br><br>What I noticed actually kinda surprised me, since it turns out more than a few of my active/planned characters are on the tall side.<br><br>So here&#39;s where I wonder, how&#39;s everyone else&#39;s add up? <br><br>-July, who&#39;ll post her lot in a reply to this.</p>

            <p><u>AGENTS:</u><br><br>Falchion: Skarmory is 5&#39;7&quot;, so Falc is that height as well. Last I checked, I&#39;m around 5&#39;8&quot;, so that means Falc&#39;s human disguise is also of that height... not much height difference, really.<br><br>Rashida: Rashida&#39;s lion parts are the exact same size as those of a lioness; female <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masai_lion">Masai lions</a> are around 3.6 feet at the shoulder. In human disguise, Rashida is just barely shorter than Falc, at 5&#39;5&quot;.<br><br>Sarah: 5&#39;2&quot; according to the Wiki, but I&#39;m thinking of making her 5&#39;4&quot; now because of her stay in the PPC.<br><br>Rayner: The Wiki states that he&#39;s 4&#39;8&quot;, but that was when I first wrote him. I&#39;m thinking of bumping him up to 5&#39; now that he&#39;s been around for a year or two.<br><br>E.V.L.: 6&#39;3&quot;, the tallest among my agents.<br><br>Ripper: In an obvious homage to the infamous &quot;six-foot-turkey&quot; line in the first <i>Jurassic Park</i> movie, Ripper is exactly 6 feet tall in human disguise. As a dinosaur, he&#39;s huge even for his species, more similar in scale to the <i>Jurassic Park</i> &quot;raptors&quot; than the real <i>Deinonychus</i>, which is 2.9 feet at the shoulder and 11.2 feet long. Ripper is almost twice that size, at around 18 feet long and again, 6 feet tall from head to toe.<br><br>Cupid: Same as canon Pit, who has been confirmed by the game devs for KI:U to be 5&#39;3&quot;.<br><br>Lapis: One of my missions specifically cited her as being 4&#39;9&quot;, so I&#39;m sticking with that. Though maybe bump that up to 4&#39;10&quot;? Still, Lapis is the shortest of my agents by far.<br><br>Backslash: According to Palutena&#39;s Guidance in SSB4, Shulk is 5&#39;6&quot; (yes, shorter than Little Mac, who&#39;s 5&#39;7&quot;). Since Backslash was a former Shulk replacement, well...<br><br>Whitney: It&#39;s never stated how tall the Wii Fit Trainer is, so I&#39;ll kinda wing it for this one. Since Whitney is said to tower over Backslash, I&#39;ll just pull 6&#39;1&quot; out of my butt and call it an answer.<br><br><u>OTHER CHARACTERS:</u><br><br>Salvo: Going by <i>Minecraft</i> dimensions, about 5&#39;4&quot;, both mob and human.<br><br>Brenda: Rapidash is 5&#39;7&quot; in height, so Brenda is that as both horse-on-fire and human.<br><br>Feratu: Richard Grayson&#39;s New Earth portrayal (as Nightwing) cites him as being 5&#39;10&quot;. Sure, let&#39;s go with that.<br><br>Tianlong: Hm, tricky. His dragon form can only really be measured by length; he&#39;s 30 feet long in this form. Disguised as a human, I&#39;d say he&#39;s 6&#39;2&quot;.<br><br>Suta: Surprisingly small for a T. rex - around 30 feet long and 10 feet tall at the hip. Also quite short as a human, only 5&#39;.<br><br>-----<br><br>So, height-wise, the order of my characters from shortest to tallest (human forms for simplicity) is as follows: Lapis, Rayner, Suta, Cupid, Sarah, Salvo, Rashida, Backslash, Falchion, Brenda, Feratu, Ripper, Whitney, Tianlong, and E.V.L.</p>

He&#39;ll probably end up around 5&#39;10&quot;; not as tall as Severus, but rather taller than Harry thanks to not growing up half-starved in a cupboard.<br><br>Agent Neshomeh - being me, she&#39;s 5&#39;5&quot; and can&#39;t really complain about being short even though she still has trouble reaching high places.<br><br>Cameo - 5&#39;3&quot;.

            <p>Interesting question. I put Chris as 5&#39;9&quot; back when Neshomeh made people loads of agent IDs, which is taller than the average Japanese guy but average for a South Korean guy. (Assuming guys reach their adult height at twenty.)<br><br>Ami is a bit short for a pony, so I did a little research and ended up with five and a half hands high. One &quot;hand&quot; = 4 inches, so Ami is twenty-two inches tall. It says 5.5hh on her ID, but after doing <a href="http://www.cowboyway.com/HowTo/HorseHeight.htm">a little more research</a>, I&#39;ve learned that a) X.2 is the proper way to notate &quot;X and a half hands high&quot; and b) 5.5hh would correctly be written as 6.1hh, or twenty-five inches tall.<br>TL;DR - I messed up the math and Ami might be three inches taller than I said she was. She&#39;s got plenty of room to grow, so I&#39;m not that concerned.<br><br>I haven&#39;t figured out much about Miguel at all yet, including his height. Hopefully writing more stuff featuring him in the future will help me flesh out his character.<br><br>Violet is exactly my height: 4&#39;11.5&quot;. I know this because her author put that right at the beginning of the story she used to feature in.</p>

            <p>I guess it&#39;s the same problem behind my facial recognition difficulty, and not noticing what people are wearing?

I thought I&#39;d do it with my PPC agents, and then I realized that as tongue-in-cheek as it is, doing this was also a pretty neat way for me to summarize my agents&#39; personalities. I&#39;m obviously Knife Birb, by the way, and also Thesaurus and Kid Bacchus.<br><br>So, quiz question: If you made a &quot;tag yourself&quot; meme using your agents, what sort of quirks and other traits would you list for each of them? And to fit the intent of the meme, which of your agents would you most relate to aside from your self-inserts and why?</p>

            <p>Although for me when I feel like I have dreamed the situation before, it usually occurs during the entire situation.  It is weird when you feel like you know exactly what is going to happen, i.e., you know what you are going to say before you think about saying it, or you know what another person is saying as they say it.  It is almost in a sense like precognition, but I don&#39;t believe in that kind of stuff at all, so I suspect it is a metaphoric glitch in my metaphoric computer of a brain.  Where I just feel like I know what is going to happen, not that I actually do.</p>

            <p>That is kinda weird! <br>Do your dreams ever feature you remembering a certain fact, and when you wake up you can&#39;t remember if it&#39;s a true thing that made it into the dream or if it&#39;s just something your brain made up? That happens to me a lot.</p>

            <p>You can answer it in two ways.<br>1) A literal glitch in the Matrix. In this case... Um, unanswerable question, I guess?<br>Either a) we live in the base reality, in which case there is no Matrix for glitches to happen in, or b) we live in a simulation so good we can&#39;t &quot;see the pixels&quot;, so to speak, in which case it&#39;s irrelevant whether it&#39;s a simulation or not.<br>Option c), &quot;we live in a bad enough (from a quality PoV, not a moral one) simulation and we can see that&quot;, gets shot down by a combination of Occam&#39;s Razor and plain simple observation.<br>2) Metaphorically; that is, déjà vu. In this case... yeah, definitely happened to me, but nothing interesting or noticeable.</p>

            <p>&quot;Plato is <i>The Matrix</i> and Descartes is <i>Inception</i>. Just was reminded by your point one.<br><br>If I <i>have</i> seen any Matrix glitches, it was probably the time I went to a pet store for guinea pig food and saw a baby cavvy that looked identical to one of mine. I took a picture for comparison (which I have sadly since deleted :( ) and their fur patterns/colors matched perfectly. Bit of a weird moment for me, but I dismissed it as pet stores getting their stock from the same breeders.</p>

            <p>Recently we had a Biology lesson where we mentioned orchids, and on the way home from school the bus takes us past a bar/restaurant/place called The Orchid. As we passed, I remembered thinking it was a coincidence when I passed it earlier in the day. Problem is, I hadn&#39;t passed it earlier in the day; I hadn&#39;t even left school premises until the bell rang. There is no way that that memory could have been real, and I know I might have just been associating it with the font on a library book (my mind plays tricks like that sometimes), but it felt really vivid.</p>

            <p>1): Betas are not necessarily related to permission, though in the case of permission you would want to have your stuff looked over first, posted second.<br><br>2): No, you don&#39;t have to. It&#39;s still one of the better ideas, though. There&#39;s a reason editors exist.<br><br>3): See number two. Very, very little here is considered mandatory, however, there are some things that are so common sense that you&#39;d have to be crazy not to do them. Having a beta or two look over your stuff is the same way.</p>

            <p>1/ You ask for a beta before you make your story publically available. If that story is a Permission piece, you&#39;ll need to ask for a beta before you use it to ask for Permission. If the story is a mission that you plan on posting after you get Permission, then you&#39;ll probably get some very funny looks asking for a beta before you <i>do</i> have Permission.<br><br>2/ &amp; 3/ No, beta-readers are not mandatory, though I know a few people who would love to make them so. ^_~ But they are strongly recommended. (Me personally, I think that if you get your samples beta&#39;d without intending to have betas for your missions/other PPC writings, you&#39;re misrepresenting the finished product. But that&#39;s pure hS-is-weird.)<br><br>hS (is weird)</p>

            <p>My concern - and, in order not to mislead you, I should note that it&#39;s been specifically rejected in the past by... either Neshomeh or Araeph, I forget - is that if you have a beta for your samples but not for your stories, you&#39;re getting Permission based on more polished work than you actually intend to publish. You know how sometimes you see a movie and it turns out the trailer was much better than the whole thing? That.<br><br>Doing it the other way round, though, just means people will be pleasantly surprised at the improvement after you get Permission. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><br>The dogpiling did not help.  That thread is now a mess that is beyond my ability to go through it in an orderly fashion.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry for the backwards apologies I made.  <br><br>Most of this mask came from interacting with a group that probably wasn&#39;t good to interact with, and I apologize for gauging that you were like them.  They would say hurtful things and then get offended that I didn&#39;t respond.  Then they would demand apologies when I pointed out that it was hurtful.  Apologizing for being wrong when I was right seemed to appease them.<br><br>You were really starting to seem like the type that would rather have that than me disagreeing with you.  I apologize for hurting you with that criticism.  I am seeing a lot of my attempts to explain myself being shut-down and ignored, and people reading sub-texts that aren&#39;t there.<br><br>I think that you are attributing my problems with understanding to malice when it is not.  What you seem to be attributing to argumentativeness is that I&#39;m prodding you to say things another way or clarifying things to make sure that we&#39;re both on similar pages.  I need to know that the other person knows where I&#39;m coming from and to really understand where they&#39;re coming from.  I&#39;d like tips on how to get things clarified without making it seem like I&#39;m rejecting advice.<br><br>At this point I would like to apologize properly, but I&#39;m going to need people who want apologies to step forward and say what the problem is instead of me having to guess.<br><br><br><br><br>Iximaz, I&#39;m sorry that it took more effort to try and help me than just pointing out the first obvious problem and  call it a day.  I did not mean to get “snippy” when I pointed out what was causing the problem that I already knew about.  Is it “snippy” if you point out some water on the floor and I say there&#39;s a burst pipe that we gotta stop instead of grabbing a mop?<br><br>Unless you can remind me of a good piece of advice I didn&#39;t understand, missed, or forgot about, stop screaming that I&#39;m not following any of it.  I had forgotten about the not taking it literally part, so I ran a prompt through a couple rounds of translate so I couldn&#39;t read it.  That didn&#39;t help, but translating it back to English changed it enough that I can work with it.  For Desdendelle&#39;s advice that I should find a way to make her do something she doesn&#39;t want to do, I&#39;m still deciding if mind-puppeting or just threatening to kill her is funnier even though I don&#39;t want to take either route.<br><br>The only ableism I&#39;m complaining about is Desdendelle constantly saying that I&#39;m not trying hard enough.  It&#39;s not the amount of effort, it&#39;s the approach that I&#39;m using, and Kelly might still be a bad character.<br><br>However, I think that Desdendelle made a bad assumption. “I didn&#39;t know a single person who likes being told that exactly what they&#39;re doing wrong.”  “Unless I&#39;m missing something here, you&#39;re basically going &quot;since you didn&#39;t praise what I wrote, you&#39;re meen and you&#39;re picking on me because I have a learning disability!&quot;”  What I&#39;m mad about is that I got yelled at and made to feel stupid for needing too much help.  And I&#39;m a little peeved that he thinks I was looking for praise when I hate how that file turned out.  The only time praise is constructive is if there is an element that should be used more.  I enjoy when the criticism has something that I should honestly correct.<br><br>On the Navy point, I do not wear my spouse&#39;s rank.  Unless we have kids, my importance is less than that of a therapy dog.  Also, I think his rank is immaterial to yours unless you&#39;re actually working together.  I didn&#39;t have any intention of actually telling him, so I&#39;m sorry for saying so just because I thought it would appease you.  He did clarify the UCMJ, which does put the contractor&#39;s use of old pants into a gray area.  I&#39;ve decided that it&#39;s fair that JulyFlame and other military people can bring up the subject, but I can&#39;t.  I have seen the stress of the job do strange things, and I think that speculating about what the stress is, beyond too many “that&#39;s what she said” jokes, is not safe.<br><br>I have autistic traits, and had to start with a self-diagnosis.  I am not formally diagnosed, and won&#39;t be until they address the depression, so I&#39;m not saying it is positively austism, but they have ruled out dyspraxia, and I&#39;ve always “flunked” ADHD tests so they can&#39;t tell if I have it or not.  I also thought I had PTSD at one point, but after a few years it went away on its own, so the real PTSD must suck.<br><br>I say this as justification about why I&#39;m having trouble figuring out the right thing to say, and why you&#39;re having so much trouble figuring out why I&#39;m doing certain things.  Having an inability to naturally understand social interaction is much different than being depressed.<br><br>7. Everyone deserves an honest second chance - which means, initially, a chance to stop, explain, and/or apologise. This means that, if you believe that someone is engaged in any violation of the Constitution, but particularly Articles 1-3, it is critical to make sure they understand what they are doing wrong, so that they can make amends. Explain it to them yourself, or ask a third party to do so - but the key word is explain. Telling someone to shut up because their opinion is unwanted does not constitute a chance.<br><br>From the beta page: “or at least giving it some very careful thought before deciding not to take it.”  I apologize again for not properly acknowledging that I was thinking about the advice they were giving me.  <br><br>If not an apology, I think that I&#39;m at least owed knowledge of what they said to JulyFlame other than “giving others a difficult time.”  Did they share anything about what I said in the email messages?  I was trying to explain myself.<br><br>Constantly shouting me down when I&#39;m trying to explain feels a lot like shutting me up because you don&#39;t want to hear it.<br></p>

            <p>I do this. I rub people the wrong way and then they get angry and I feel like I&#39;m being attacked, and I metaphorically huddle in the corner and apologize reflexively and try to figure out what I did wrong and never quite understand it.<br><br>I&#39;m autistic. And I do not like to hurt people. But people have gotten the impression that I was trying to hurt them, when I wasn&#39;t.<br><br>I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is, please go easy on this person. When they write, just look at what they&#39;re actually saying and dump any subtext you think might be there, because chances are there is no subtext. That unintentional social clumsiness, saying the wrong thing, sending the wrong subtext, is just that: Unintentional. It happens despite my best efforts and I think this person may be having the same trouble.</p>

The character wanted to be an agent, but the symptoms of his disorder made him into a ticking time-bomb that could potentially get both him and his partner killed.  I didn&#39;t get to explain the specifics before Desdendelle said something like &#39;If they want to work in the field, they get to work in the field.  The only reason for not making them agents is if they&#39;re under 13.&#39;  Is that right, or would the Marquis de Sod steer someone away from the field if they&#39;re unsuitable?<br><br>I&#39;m not sure about whether or not bears can sneak, but I can drop the concept.<br><br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=290884;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=290884;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=290884;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board</a></a><br><br>Pointing out that they&#39;re robotic and giving pointers to avoid that is very constructive.<br><br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=290763;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=290763;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=290763;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board</a></a><br><br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=290776;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=290776;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=290776;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board</a></a><br><br>I did get things clarified, I think.

I&#39;m also reworking the recruiting agents so that they&#39;re not lazy, incompetent, or too overworked to do it properly.<br><br>I did ask for what you are looking for in her bio...

I thought that she would be Sueish if I abused the technology to have her suddenly know Kung-Fu like in The Matrix.  Now that I know that at it&#39;s base, the Dollhouse technology would be against the ethics of the PPC even when used with good intentions, I know not to go in that direction.<br><br>For Team Phoenix, I did not actually read the page.
