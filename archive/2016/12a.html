            <p>Hey, I&#39;m new, and I am just a reader of these fics, but I do have a suggestion of a badfic, for Invader Zim.<br><br>It&#39;s called &quot;Love Knows No Race&quot;, and has poorly written slash, incest, a bad Mary Sue villain child, AND has a bonus robot pregnancy.<br><br>And everything is so OOC and goopey lovey dovey, it makes me want to vomit.<br><br>Like I said, I&#39;m new to the fandom, and I just am a reader.

            <p>Anyway, welcome to the PPC! Please accept this elegant and finely-crafted starter Pokémon:-<br><img src="https://randompokemon.com/sprites/animated/611.gif"><br>Iiiiiiit&#39;s Fraxure!<br><br>And your starting item is:-<br><img src="https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/3/3b/Godhead_Icon.png?version=232d9bb4edc586eb527d008c6062a251"><br>Godhead(!) from <i>The Binding Of Isaac: Afterbirth</i>!<br><br>Godhead is a fantastic item that&#39;s basically a held version of Hone Claws, but better. It increases your Attack and Special Attack stats by 30%, and increases the accuracy of your moves by 30% too! This makes moves like Dragon Rush super viable... or it would if Fraxure knew them. Still, it&#39;s a good item for an offensively inclined Pokémon, so get an Adamant one with Mould Breaker and EV train it in Attack and Speed, then give it Swords Dance to boost your Attack even higher, Outrage for STAB, Superpower for Fighting-type coverage against big, nasty threats, and Iron Tail to deal with Fairy-types lured in by the promise of an Outrage. You might just want to wait for it to evolve before using it, though; Haxorus is a great Pokémon in its own right, and benefits hugely from the stat boosts. Most importantly, however: have fun. =]</p>

            <p>Sounding with an actual Christmas tree, whether real or artificial, is actually quite easy - fir branches are quite thin, with only the buds at the end causing any mischief. The problem is the leaves, which add quite a lot of nastiness, not least the fact that Christmas trees drop needles like a quilting bee in an earthquake.

            <p>Sounding is no more inherently life-threatening than owning a cat. Even when you monumentally screw up, most of the time the apparatus you&#39;ve been using won&#39;t require surgical removal, mostly because it&#39;s actually a lot more difficult to get stuff stuck there than with, say, the anal cavity, simply because you&#39;ve got so much less space to play with. So to speak. Lacerations, now, that&#39;s a very different story. Cuts inside your urethra are <i>unbelievably</i> painful, even the teeny tiny ones. Don&#39;t slit your slit up is the moral of this particular story.<br><br>I recall a similar discussion concerning <i>Draco&#39;s Christmas Cuppa</i>, and I feel the need to reiterate the points I made there; yes, this is in fact my kink, and just because it&#39;s done wrong in badfic doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s done wrong in real life.</p>

            <p>...that the guy who needed surgical removal obviously <i>didn&#39;t</i> know what he was doing. Hence, being an idiot.<br><br>That&#39;s what my point is. Not that all people who enjoy sounding are idiots. Just the ones who try it with no idea how to do it without severely injuring themselves.</p>

            <p>While this thread is one of the rare sometimes-NSFW ones on-Board, this discussion is kinda off-topic and in no way kiddie-friendly. It&#39;s also making me go &quot;squick&quot; and &quot;do not want&quot; a bit too much in my opinion, and no doubt that it&#39;s also squicky to other people... can you please take it to email or whatever?</p>

            <p>Y&#39;know, I was just thinking about something like a toy drive for all the Nursery kids, especially the unadopted ones. I think it&#39;s probably good for kids to have a few things that belong to them. Agents can&#39;t all go around buying stuff (with what money, for starters), but I imagine plenty of people around HQ have talents like woodcarving, painting, sewing, etc., and could make little things to donate. I imagine that&#39;s probably how Nume and Ilraen got their sacks of toys in &quot;<a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/songbook/2009/nightbefore.html">The Night Before Christmas in HQ</a>,&quot; which I am increasingly tempted to regard as canonical. <i>How</i> Jenni put them up to it, I&#39;m not sure, but hey, Rule of Funny, right? {= )<br><br>So, hey, side-thread: Who has agents who make things? Derik certainly knows how to make simple instruments, for one.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

They also mention that today &#39;chanukiah&#39; is widespread in Israel. So I&#39;m guessing that in the Talmud, if it&#39;s called anything, it&#39;s either a menorah or a Chanukah menorah. So...I&#39;m now guessing that the use of &#39;menorah&#39; to mean &#39;chanukiah&#39; came into American English from *Yiddish* (where it&#39;s spelled the same way as in Hebrew but pronounced &#39;meh-NOY-reh&#39;), and gained more momentum than the Hebrew word did--learning modern Hebrew was on the rise in the 1900s, but in the early days it still wasn&#39;t *that* present. Also, the first major wave of Jewish immigration to American started around 1880, probably before the word &#39;chanukiah&#39; even existed, so it may&#39;ve made its way into Jewish English around that point and was never replaced.<br><br>Either way. While a speaker of modern Hebrew is definitely going to go &#39;uh...a menorah is something else?&#39; an English speaker is pretty likely to go &#39;menorah!&#39; And I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say that if you prefer the Yiddish connection, go for menorah, and if you prefer modern Hebrew and not confusing Israelis, go for chanukiah. And I&#39;ll just be the historian-ish person over in the corner.<br><br>As for this specific case, I kind of like the idea of people getting to learn something new :)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Hebrew as spoken in Israel (I don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough of a difference to merit an Israeli/American split like you have British English and American English) was less influenced by non-Semitic languages, so it&#39;s less far from the Biblical Hebrew than Hebrew as it is spoken in the States — at least the Hebrew I heard from Americans (even Americans who made Aliyah, since they tend to retain their accents).</p>

            <p>...follows the Sephardic pronunciation, which iirc was chosen as the official modern Hebrew thing partly because it was supposed to be a bit more authentic and partly because, well, it provided distance from Yiddish, which wasn&#39;t regarded highly (at various points it hasn&#39;t even been considered to have the status of a language). You&#39;ll still hear the Ashkenazic pronunciation sometimes, especially among the Diaspora Jews who would say things like &#39;gut Shabbes&#39; (basically, it&#39;s the difference between &quot;ahavAHT TorAH&quot;, Sephardic/modern Hebrew, and &quot;aHAvas TOrah&quot;, Ashkenazi. My emphasis on the later may be a bit off. (Yiddish, of course, would have it as &quot;ahavas Toyre&quot;, assuming the first word didn&#39;t get kind of slurred/condensed into the bargain)). Where was I? Right, Americans. Basically, there&#39;s what&#39;s probably a rather large number of English speaking Jews who have trouble pronouncing the kh sound. I&#39;ve seen this among classmates, kids I&#39;m teaching, and now also people in my German class. You hear things like h, a very soft kh that barely makes the sound but is distinct from the h, and then, especially in German or Yiddish classes, there are people who will replace kh with a hard k. Anyway. Even apart from that, the accent itself is often a little different--if a word ends in an L sound, for instance, Israelis will kind of draw it out? Like, the tip of the tongue goes against the top of the front teeth, instead of kind of curling in the middle of the mouth as it does in most Canadian/American English wouldn&#39;tation of words ending in an L sound. That&#39;s one example. It&#39;s the same language, though Diaspora Jews are apparently more likely to have learned more biblical vocabulary and use it when am Israeli wouldn&#39;t, just with a few differences in accent and possibly some differences in emphasis.<br><br>And I really hope that made the point I wanted it to (whatever that was), and had no typos, because by now I&#39;m really tired and I&#39;m home and going to eat. So. Hope this adds something and is interesting, here it is so I don&#39;t post it two weeks later if the thread is even still on the Board, gut Shabbes, y&#39;all.*<br><br>~DF<br><br>*/Is not actually the sort of person who normally says gut Shabbes, but has picked it up a little more since moving back to Canada at age ten and hearing it for the first time/</p>

            <p>Well.<br><br>I mean, yeah, they&#39;re currently *used* to refer to the same thing, particularly in American English (I&#39;m pretty sure no Hebrew-speaking Israeli would use it). I&#39;ll even catch myself saying &#39;menorah&#39; sometimes. So, going by the current vernacular--that&#39;s perfectly fine.<br><br>The only thing is, well, technically they aren&#39;t meant to be two words for the same thing. A menorah, like the one that stood in the Temple two thousand years ago, has seven branches. A chanukiah, on the other hand, is what we use today and has nine--to symbolize the eight days the one jug of oil in the Chanukah story burned for (eight branches plus one shammash or helper candle, which is used to light the others; the menorah has six plus one shammash. If you&#39;re familiar with the Shammes or whatever the name ended up being for the caretaker of a synagogue in Eastern Europe, it&#39;s the same word). So, I have to add my religious/Jewish Studies major protest that they&#39;re actually *not* the same thing, even though the current use is to conflate them.<br><br>So...ach. Do what you like. Just, y&#39;know, be aware that &#39;chanukiah&#39; isn&#39;t just the Hebrew equivalent (both words are Hebrew)--it&#39;s actually the correct word for the currently used thing. But yeah, for understanding purposes, the vernacular should probably be used...<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: &quot;Menorah&quot; probably comes from &quot;ner&quot;, candle, or &quot;or&quot;, light. &quot;Chanukiah&quot;, well, I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s meant to be &#39;this is a candelabra specific to Chanukah and referring to the Chanukah story so we&#39;re calling it a chanukiah&#39;. And now I&#39;m wondering how old that word is and what Hillel and Shammai called the Chanukah candle-holder in the Talmud when they were disagreeing over which direction the candles should be lit from...Anyway, I should go back to Yiddish in Canada now.

            <p>but it seems you&#39;ve beat me to the punch. Here&#39;s my contribution:<br><br><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/114659/sol-umbrae">Sol Umbrae</a> by Dream Bolt<br><i>When Twilight Sparkle and her friends are sent to go to the strange world of Mobius to defeat an ancient evil, they end up encountering a strange, spiky blue creature named Sonic. The ponies easily make friends with Sonic, but soon find that not all of the people on Mobius are friendly. Mysterious events lead to misunderstandings, while an evil villain known as Dr. Eggman is setting his eyes on Equestria as his new target.<br><br>And amidst all of this lies a great mystery, a mystery that will shed some shocking revelations on how Equestria and Mobius share a great deal of history, on the origins of the being called Solaris, and on a dark threat that both worlds know all too well.</i><br><br>A well-constructed Sonic/MLP crossover. Though it has its roots in Sonic &#39;06 (gasp!), it does a good bit of worldbuilding, tying the aforementioned Sonic &#39;06 and a lot of the main canon sources into a cohesive timeline--as well as seamlessly merging MLP (this was written after the Season 3 finale) into the universe. SPaG is not perfect, but it doesn&#39;t detract much from the story. I&#39;d highly recommend it.</p>

            <p>Yay, goodfic thread! I have a handful of lovely slash fics (or just fics that include slash) to offer you.<br><br>First up, from the <i>Free!</i> fandom, <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/4229799">Blue Lotus, White Lotus</a> by shions<em>heart. Set in the desert AU as seen in the S1 ending, this is primarily a Rei/Nagisa fic, but Makoharu also features (as does Rinsuke). I should warn you that it does include themes of slavery, forced prostitution, and war, so if you&#39;re sensitive to those, you may want to check out the next thing on my list instead...<br><br>Namely, &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://archiveofourown.org/chapters/2094253?show">http://archiveofourown.org/chapters/2094253?show</a></em>comments=true&quot;&gt;Nothing Gold Can Stay</a> by perkynurples. I&#39;ll just drop the summary here and let it speak for itself:<br>&quot;Bilbo Baggins led a rather peaceful life, thank you very much, until an old acquaintance decided to turn it upside down, and he found himself agreeing to take a job that’s… let’s say not exactly up his alley, and might eventually cost him a little more than his treasured cozy lifestyle. Who would have thought tutoring a slightly menacing monarch’s more than slightly overbearing nephew could prove to be such an… adventure?&quot;<br><br>If you want something action-based, I have <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8969966/1/The-Hetalian-Job">The Hetalian Job</a> by RainyMeadows (along with its sequels). This is more in the &quot;awesome fic that includes slash&quot; category; Death the Kid finds Italy lost and scared in the Black Forest and things spiral out of control from there. Content warnings for graphic violence (including some torture), swearing, blood, and in one case suicidal thoughts. <br><br>Last, a femslash fic: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11857112/1/Girl-She-Loved">Girl She Loved</a> by Fabulolz. Literally every other fic in the Free! fandom I&#39;ve looked at/into has been either some variety of slash or a het pairing, so this jumped out at me automatically. Furthermore, it&#39;s about Gou&#39;s two friends Chigusa and Hoshiko, who don&#39;t get lots of screentime for obvious reasons. (Content warning for emotional abuse.)</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s one: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6735812/1/The-Spirit-of-Redemption">The Spirit of Redemption</a> by Myetel. It&#39;s for Mass Effect. (Link is SFW, but the fic is not. There are plenty of explicit romance scenes, but they&#39;re decently done, can be skipped, and are clearly marked with scene breaks/author&#39;s notes so you can easily skip past those.)<br><br>I don&#39;t want to scare you away from this and <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6693626/1/The-Spirit-of-Truth">its prequel,</a> but there are several caveats to this fic. The first is that it&#39;s a Mass Effect AU, so much so that the canons are side characters to the OCs.<br><br>Drawback 2: There are more than a few changes to canon, so biotics become psychic wizards even more than in the games.<br><br>Drawback 3: Plotholes and Deus Ex Machinas. There are a lot of &#39;em, especially toward the end of the fic (it kind of jumps the shark for its final arc). Worst offender is a two-year time skip where a romantic pairing breaks up with no foreshadowing or explanation, and a spoileriffic thing involving Prothean nanobots.<br><br>Drawback 4: A bunch of cultural stuff is entirely made up for the fic, up to and including snippets of language. It&#39;s based on the influences the canon drew from, so I consider this a strength, but others may feel differently.<br><br>All of that said, The Spirit of Redemption is still amazing. I don&#39;t read a lot of fanfic, but this has great characterization and nearly flawless SPaG across several million(!) words. Some of it is less-than-great, but there&#39;s enough good stuff that it&#39;s more than worth the read.</p>

            <p>-Maedhros is fully committed to stopping the worldwide climate change planned by Morgoth as part of his &quot;Burn the land, boil the sea&quot; schemes. Thingol apparently believes that if we just ignore Morgoth, he will go away.<br><br>-Maedhros recognises the value of migrants. The first settlement of mortals in Beleriand was in lands held by House Feanor, and Maedhros&#39; brother Caranthir welcomed the people of Haleth into his lands. Maedhros promotes integration between Elves and Men to bring about a brighter future together. But don&#39;t let Thingol fool you into thinking Maedhros wants Beleriand to be &quot;swamped&quot; with mortals! Maedhros promises a firm but fair approach.<br><br>-Maedhros promises equal rights for all: Noldor, Sindar, mortals, and dwarves (firm friends of Lord Caranthir). He believes in allowing the diversity of the Free Peoples to flourish. Thingol would have everyone speak <i>his</i> language, and submit to <i>his</i> culture.<br><br>-Maedhros believes that moderate weapon controls make for a safer Beleriand. Let the swords and bows hold the front lines - there&#39;s no need for them in the peaceful lands behind the Leaguer.<br><br>-Maedhros vows to improve the infrastructure of Beleriand. Take a look at his lands, filled with paved roads and well-organised townships. Compare them to Doriath, where the roads are overgrown - or spider-infested - and there is nowhere to live but trees and caves. Who would <i>you</i> rather have planning your village?<br><br>-Maedhros has good relations with the other realms in Beleriand. Fingolfin is his uncle; Finrod is his cousin; Men and Dwarves have shared his borders; even the Silvan folk pay fealty to him in Ossiriand.<br><br>Thingol claims Maedhros&#39; lost hand makes him weak and sickly - but we all know his left arm is stronger than both of Thingol&#39;s put together.<br><br>Thingol claims Maedhros&#39; Valinorean speech makes him haughty - but we all know that&#39;s simple racism on the Greycloak&#39;s part.<br><br>Thingol claims Maedhros lives in an isolated fortress, disconnected from the common folk - but we all know Himring is the heart of the Leaguer, the citadel that all roads lead to.<br><br>Thingol claims Maedhros is tarred by his father&#39;s actions - but we all know he&#39;s just intimidated by someone who stands <i>by</i> his kin, instead of (for instance) wandering off into the woods and abandoning them.<br><br>#I&#39;mWithMatimo<br>#StrongerThanTheRightTogether<br><br>hS, apparently a Feanorian agitator what is the world coming to?</p>

It allows you to deal extra damage at the end of every turn via a multi-hit attack - it&#39;s Steel-type, Special damage category, and the base power of each hit is 18. Now, you tend to see this on Skill Link or Technician users to boost the damage output of the skill, but it can definitely work on Golduck. The standard special set applies here: grab a Modest one with Swift Swim and give it EVs in Special Attack and Speed, then kit it out with Rain Dance, Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, and Psyshock. The extra damage from it can be very beneficial; however, it comes at the cost of a more conventional damage-boosting item like Life Orb. Still, the important thing is always to have fun. =]</p>

            <p>You&#39;re probably in its fandom. Don&#39;t worry about not doing a lot of typical fandom things; we&#39;ve got a lot of different types of people in this community (and, being online, cosplay doesn&#39;t come up a whole lot.

I&#39;m a teenager, pronouns she/her/hers, I&#39;ve been in the PPC for about half a year but don&#39;t write, my fandoms are all sci-fi and fantasy so you probably don&#39;t really care, but I love slash.</p>

            <p>SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE okay I&#39;m done now. XD<br><br>Anyway, I honestly didn&#39;t think amber fossils could get that big - nor did I think they&#39;d bring up the possibility of finding an entire dinosaur preserved like this. Most likely it&#39;d be a baby specimen, since as far as I&#39;m aware, amber doesn&#39;t get big enough to encase even the smallest adult non-avian dinos.<br><br>Apart from that, though, hS basically covered everything I would&#39;ve said.

            <p>Insofar as there&#39;s a firm dividing line between &#39;feathered avian dinosaur&#39; and &#39;feathered non-avian dinosaur&#39;, the presence of a flexible bony tail is it. (That and teeth, I guess, and maybe hand-claws.) This is something the size of a small bird which could swish its tail from side to side. <b>Awesome</b>.<br><br>It&#39;s also one of the very few Mesozoic dinosaurs we have colour information for; <a href="http://albertonykus.deviantart.com/art/In-Living-Color-Maybe-613196380">this</a> shows most of the state of the art from last year. And it&#39;s not black! It&#39;s a lovely chestnut on top and white underneath.<br><br>The feathers themselves are apparently arranged as a fan down either side of the tail, like we see on <i>Anchiornis</i> and <i>Microraptor</i> specimens and in pictures; nice little confirmation that that&#39;s not a preservation artefact. And you can see for yourself that it&#39;s superfloof. I wonder whether this was from an adult (which would I think be among the smallest Mesozoic dinosaurs attested) or a juvenile? The paper suggests juvenile, based I think solely on it being small.<br><br>The paleoart showing up attached to the story is very nice-looking, too (though it&#39;s not from the paper, and I don&#39;t think it was made for this story; not sure though).<br><br>All in all: yay!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Some of you may remember that in my eagerness to contribute, I posted in a thread about Fairy Tail minis before properly introducing myself. I wasn&#39;t using my dA username (which came from Liz Gilbert&#39;s memoir) for anything else, and my FF.net handle--Eneko95--sounded silly, I guess. (Eneko being the Japanese name for Skitty.)</p>

            <p>I was looking around for a new alias to use on the interwebs this last summer, as all my existing ones really didn&#39;t fit my gender any more, and in a fit of uninspiration, I grabbed the NATO phonetics for my first and middle initials. The name has grown on me since - it&#39;s quietly transfeminine, with Δ being the usual mathematical symbol for change.</p>

            <p>Once upon a time, I was very young, and finished reading Captain Underpants, and decided: &#39;Hey, that was pretty funny. Those characters were pretty funny. <i>I should be funny!</i>&#39; <br><br>Oh, bugger me. <br><br>I decided that I was to be the official class clown, and my comedic talents manifested in such ingenious, subversive gags as shouting &#39;Banana!&#39; in the middle of class. You know, when you wouldn&#39;t expect someone to shout banana! <br>It plays on your expectations! It&#39;s a joke, right?!<br><br>Oh, bugger me. <br><br>So I then moved into the internet, into lord knows what bloody thing. It was probably Runescape or Club Penguin, or some bollocks. Or some DS game, I don&#39;t know. <br>I decided that, being the master jokester I was (&#39;Banana! Hahahahaha!&#39;) I needed something to reflect that. <br>It was spelt &#39;laughinstok&#39;.<br><br>Oh, bugger. <br><br>I made it my Steam name (It&#39;s still my username, technically... <i>brrrrrr</i>) but, in that dangerous act known as &#39;Growing up and getting marginally less stupid,&#39; I realised how absolutely dumb looking that name was. (And also how dumb the class clown thing was, particularly when you&#39;re not funny.)<br>I jumped around a bit, trying all sorts of names (Steam has a nickname sort&#39;ve feature, where your visible name is separate from your username,) none of which had that <i>spark.</i><br>No, I decided. This cannot do. I require something... classic. Old, but new. <br>Yes, yes...<br>So, Larfen J. Stocke! <br>And then I added an &#39;Esq&#39;, when I remembered that I was the son of a knight, and/or also an American lawyer!</p>

Turns out this is a relatively tight and active place, and people will refer to you by your handle and remember you by it.

            <p>I&#39;m a huge <i>World of Warcraft</i> nut, but my gateway drug into the world of MMORPGs was... <i>Runescape.</i><br><br>I started playing when it was in the days of being able to either use a randomly-generated username, or you could make one up yourself. Of course, you couldn&#39;t actually use anything that sounded like a name (I guess to keep people from using their real ones?), but that seriously irritated me. And there was no way I wanted to be called &quot;CamelotOrc3327&quot; while on a quest to save the world.<br><br>So, being the idiot twelve year old I was, I played around with letters and sounds until I came up with &quot;Iximaz&quot;. That totally sounded like a name, right?<br><br>Right?<br><br>Eh. :P I did end up using it as my internet handle pretty much everywhere, though, so it worked out in the end.</p>

            <p>My friend and I were playing an imagination game and came up with two names for our cat characters: Brightshadow and Dawnfire. Funnily enough, I was originally Brightshadow and she was originally Dawnfire. I started off using Brightshadow as a screen name (notably at Deleterius) and then just moved on to DawnFire for some reason. I&#39;ve actually thought of switching screennames since then (let&#39;s face it, I&#39;ve been using DawnFire since I was about *fourteen years old*) but have figured it&#39;d be pretty confusing for people. Although, seeing as a number of people have been doing it recently...I might go for it anyway. We&#39;ll see.<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: &#39;Dawnfire&#39; is apparently an incredibly common screenname, as it turns out. If you search &#39;Dawnfire&#39; on FFN, for instance, a number of people who are not me come up. The capitalized Fire helps distinguish me, though I think I first used it mainly because I liked the way it looked.</p>

            <p>I finally found the time to read this, and it’s good to see the repercussions of Agent Desdendelle’s cyberisation.

            <p>Chicago&#39;s getting a blizzard tonight, and a good blizzard needs some good holiday tunes to go with it. Therefore, I&#39;m starting the PPC Holiday Filk Game a little early this year. ^_^ (Maybe this will give me time to actually finish a piece!)<br><br>As usual, the following guidelines apply:<br><br>1. Pick a seasonal tune that strikes your fancy—anything you like, even if it&#39;s been used for this before.<br>2. Write new words for it with a PPC theme.<br><span>2a. As usual, I encourage you to seek for a topic that does not involve Sue-slaying, because we have lots of filks about that. If that&#39;s what the muse dictates, though, go for it.</span><br><span>2b. What I&#39;d <i>really</i> like to see are more tunes about actual holiday stuff in Headquarters. There are lots of holiday filks about PPC stuff, but not too many holiday filks about PPC <i>holiday</i> stuff. Odd, ne?</span><br>3. Post your filk here in this thread for us to enjoy and comment on.<br>4. If so inclined, share a recording of yourself singing a filk or two.<br>5. When all&#39;s said, sung, and done, I&#39;ll add this year&#39;s entries to the <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/songbook/">PPC Holiday Songbook</a> unless you specify otherwise.<br><br>BTW, notice anything different about the Songbook? {= D<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m so glad you liked it :)<br><br>I actually now have two more possibly filk-able Chanukah tunes that I (re)discovered yesterday through work, so possibly keep an eye out for more!<br><br>(But yeah, a PPC Chanukah celebration? Obviously there&#39;s stuff for kids, people probably get pretty into the candles, there&#39;s almost definitely alcohol fire those inclined to drink a bit of it, and while you *probably* won&#39;t get a mission, it definitely isn&#39;t out of the question. But, of course, just as Chanukah is a celebration of light in the darkness and the victory of few over many, so could it in the PPC be a celebration of canon within badfic and the hope that a comparatively small and overworked number of agents can make a difference against a multitude of badfic...)<br><br>Basically, this would seem to be a holiday that PPCers could connect to *very* easily, is my point. Though, now I&#39;m thinking that Pesach/Passover&#39;s theme of &#39;from slavery to freedom&#39; would feel very applicable to reformed Sues, Stus, and agents who were badficcers or Suethors (or even bit characters!) themselves...hmmmm.<br><br>Anyway. 1-2 more filks will hopefully show up from me soon. <br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Except I&#39;m not sure how many of mine have made it out here even just in RPs or non-canon stuff as opposed to those in development (you *may* have noticed that I seem to write kind of slowly these days...) and it&#39;s a period of almost *four* years for me (wow. Just wow. Four years this January. Should I be feeling like an oldbie yet, or...?) For reference, I&#39;ve got...uh...my rough estimate for agent and non-agent characters that I&#39;ve created or (in at least one case) co-created is about 16. Let&#39;s go with that. I haven&#39;t counted in a while (might be more like 20 by now?), but the number (whatever it is) has been holding more or less steady for the past year or so. Hopefully soon my finished pieces will end up matching the number of characters! :)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>...is that I introduced so many new characters relatively QUICKLY. I don&#39;t know how long hS has been around or writing but I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s been writing PPC stuff for YEARS, so he&#39;s had time to put forth new characters at a reasonable pace.<br><br>Contrast this poor bird right here, who, in the course of less than ONE year, started with just two agents, then recruited two more from my first mission, introduced two MORE agent teams (four more agents total) as supporting parties, recruited yet another agent and brought in another to round out my SIC team, and Arceus knows how many other characters I&#39;ve dragged in whom I&#39;ve barely visited given both my Real Life schedule and the fact that I now have FOUR different RCs clamoring for my attention.<br><br>The point of all this is that I&#39;ve been handling the issue of &quot;Loads and Loads of Characters&quot; much more rashly than you, hS, or anyone else with more than two RCs under their belt. Whereas other writers take the time and effort to round out and develop one team at a time to make sure it&#39;s quality before moving on to the next one, I basically farted out all of mine almost all at once (well, between October of &#39;14 and June of &#39;15, but still), and now I have to struggle with making each of them stand out in their own right.<br><br>This is why I&#39;ve had to pause work with basically every other team of mine now that Falchion and company are in the spotlight for the first time since like what, Spring of &#39;15? Whereas all of my other RCs have received a lot of solid feedback and concrit, allowing me to consider possible new story arcs for all of them in the future, Falchion and Rashida have not had any proper development since I started working with basically everybody else. It&#39;s high time that I fix that, and as soon as I manage to find employment again, I can promise that they&#39;ll be getting a whole lot more attention from that point on!</p>

And, well, I just didn&#39;t think I had enough room to fit the &quot;and&quot; in the third one even though I really wanted to. XP</p>

            <p>My brain kept trying to hear this to the tune of &quot;Frosty the Snowman.&quot; Maybe because &quot;Jay and Acacia&quot; scans so well to that, plus the fact that the two tunes are kinda similar?<br><br>I&#39;unno.
