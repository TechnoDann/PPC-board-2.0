            <p>We all know that there are trends in what movies get made en masse. The &#39;fantasy&#39; trend that encompassed LotR and Harry Potter seems to be dying down now; the Superheroes one is in full swing. <i>Twilight</i> brought about a spate of angsty vampires, 80s/90s nostalgia is ongoing (<i>Power Rangers</i> next year, and <i>Star Wars</i> without end!), and we seem to have a rather nifty &#39;hard-ish scifi&#39; theme right now (<i>Gravity,</i> <i>Interstellar</i>, <i>The Martian</i>...).<br><br>But there&#39;s one field of writing that has been critically underrepresented, and since we&#39;re hopefully getting away from &#39;boardgame movies&#39;, I think its time has come.<br><br>I&#39;m talking, of course, about poems.<br><br>Personally I would love to see a summer blockbuster based on the Footprints poem (<i>One night I dreamed I was walking along a beach with God</i>). I&#39;m thinking we cast g/God as a small skinny type (old man with beard? Long-haired Jesus archetype? Woman? Maybe mix things up and find something from Asialand, like that Hindu wossname, Buddha), and the poet as a much heavier person (either muscly or overweight, depending on whether we&#39;re going for action or comedy). Then, after the various scenes of the poet and god fighting, y&#39;know, demons or dinosaurs or whatever, we get this one:<br><br><i>THE POET looks back over their shoulder. In the distance are pillars of smoke, blazing fires, gore, etc. Closer is the line of footprints, but that&#39;s just it - there&#39;s only ONE line.<br><br>POET: God? God, where are you?!<br><br>GOD&#39;s voice comes from offscreen, accompanied by swelling chords.<br><br>GOD: I am here...<br><br>PAN or CUT down to show GOD staggering along the beach, with the POET sitting on their shoulders. GOD is of course staggering under the weight, and probably wounded from defending the POET earlier.<br><br>GOD: ... my child.</i><br><br>I think it&#39;s a guaranteed hit.<br><br>Alternately, we could do <i>I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud</i> - y&#39;know, the daffodils poem - as an environmental piece: the Poet finds the daffodils under threat from, I dunno, bad people who kill plants, and has to fight to protect them. Maybe we can get a trilogy out of it (always good!): <i>Daffodils</i>, <i>The Daffodil War</i>, and <i>Memory of Daffodils</i> (after the original field gets bulldozed at the end of <i>War</i>, with the Poet saving a single bulb and going viral or whatever).<br><br>Actually, maybe this could be our &#39;in&#39;: those bad guys sound like Captain Planet villains, so why not make this a Captain Planet series? &#39;90s nostalgia, remember, and with <i>Power Rangers</i> coming up the whole &#39;hero team with big summon fights evil&#39; idea is on everyone&#39;s minds.<br><br>Well, that&#39;s my pitch. What other poems should PPC Studios adapt for our triumphant entry into the world of cinema? And what other shamefully neglected aspects of human experience should we introduce our eager public to? Be creative!<br><br>hS<br><br>(With apologies for Clueless Producer&#39;s voice up there - obviously <i>I</i> know that Buddha isn&#39;t Hindu. He&#39;s Muslim, duh. ^_~)</p>

            <p>Hey folks. Yeah, so I haven&#39;t really been around much, have I? Sorry about that.<br><br>To the new kids, hi, I&#39;m an old(-ish) face. Circa 2012, if I remember right?<br><br>To the rest of the people who may or may not remember me, well, hi, it&#39;s me again. Still a fan, just way, WAY more lurk-y than I used to be. Well, that, and IRL shenanigans.<br><br>Anyhow, to the meat of my post:<br><br>Having been hanging out over at the Library of the Damned for a while now, I&#39;ve  since become a full-time riffer with them, which - among other things - lets me join their discussions in their private Facebook group. One of the topics that recently got brought up was this:<br><br>A long time before I even knew about LotD, a fic by author Jedi Qui-Gon was riffed there. When he finally found out (by this point I was a guest riffer), he didn&#39;t take it well at first, but after some to-do about the matter, he suddenly started showing a change of heart and decided he wanted in on the fun. So, we thought, hey, cool, this guy gets it.<br><br>...No. No he doesn&#39;t.<br><br>In fact, about a week ago, we discovered that he went on to his DeviantART and <a href="http://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2F1st-hashirama-senju.deviantart.com%2Fjournal%2FMST-s-PPC-and-Fanfics-626437426&amp;h=MAQFKHqyO&amp;s=1"> called out anybody and everybody who riffs on badfics as terrible people</a>, including the PPC. In fact, he even name drops you guys, right alongside the Library, though his focus was primarily on the Library, since he dealt with us most frequently. Amongst other key things, he had the nerve to try and claim that we were trying to stymie people&#39;s freedom of speech, that we don&#39;t &quot;follow the rules of riffing&quot; (you know, those rules that were drafted up in the 90&#39;s?), that we get super crazy defensive when criticized - all of it hogwash, and all of it insulting. Then he went on and took a stab at the very first riff I did with the Library, and the debacle with that author that went down. He tried to claim that we were bullying a rookie author who was just testing the waters and couldn&#39;t even be bothered to show her even the slightest shred of mercy.<br><br>You&#39;ll note in the comments on that journal that I let him have it but good, especially about that last part.<br><br>So, yeah. Just thought I should let you guys know, since it doesn&#39;t seem fair to leave you all in the dark about criticisms being leveled at you. Especially ones comprised of baseless slander. As for me, well, I&#39;m pretty pissed off at that kid, so he&#39;d be smart not to try and respond to me at all. Jury&#39;s out on how that&#39;ll pan out.</p>

            <p>Clearly this person has never heard of Reddit. People bash other people there like there&#39;s no tomorrow, but only if they deserve it, and they make sure that it doesn&#39;t go too far. (Case in point: TehVenomWithin. Huge scammer on the Team Fortress 2 community and uses a fence of lies to defend himself whenever he is mentioned, which isn&#39;t exactly good at all. Just sayin&#39;.) Just like how the PPC handles and chooses which badfic to take care of.</p>

            <p>Man, I dunno where you found this version of reddit, but the one I&#39;ve been to, I had to leave because they allowed, and at times encouraged, misogynists, trans- and homophobes, racists, rape apologists, and literal Neo-Nazis.</p>

            <p>I think that referring to Reddit as a single, monolithic site is wrong. Each subreddit is different; you have everything from regressive left echo-chambers to r/the_Donald (haven&#39;t seen actual neo-nazis yet) and anything in-between. </p>

            <p>The only sub I can think of that actually does this is /r/The_Donald behind-the-scenes, but then again, SRS exists for a reason, whether you like it or not. Same thing applies to when reddit posts get put up on cringe subs and /r/rage.<br><br>Also, today&#39;s members don&#39;t speak of the various incidents that match these particular types of people that have gone down. The original posts are like bio-hazards if you know what I mean.<br><br>Then again, the only subs I really browse are some defaults, games I like, and cringe subs.</p>

            <p>Our goal overall with sporking fics, I believe, is to HELP AUTHORS. Sure, we kill the Sues, but that isn&#39;t always the case, and sometimes we recruit them because they CAN be written better woth a little extra effort. But overall, what we do basically boils down to pointing out what the author did wrong with the story and writing, so they can look back and note that those are things to improve upon in the future.<br><br>Unless of course you&#39;re dealing with a fic so HORRIBLE that there really isn&#39;t any other option but to say, &quot;Dude. Not Cool.&quot; And even then, it&#39;s largely trying to get the author to stop and think about what they have done, for the good of everyone. (Though with legendary badfics like, say, Agony in Pink, there really is no excuse. :/)</p>

            <p>Granted, within the sphere of us Boarders, yes, we want to help each other improve, but as far as the badficcers, not so much. Recall that we do <i>not</i> go around telling authors that their works might be/have been sporked.<br><br>Granted, there have been some Boarders who have taken the route of offering concrit before sporking (Araeph comes to mind), and after hS&#39;s FFN series, I&#39;ve seen some other Boarders leave concrit at the end of their missions, but IIRC (and please correct me if I&#39;m wrong), the overall goal is more to make fun of badfic—if someone is helped by a mission, that&#39;s lagniappe.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a delicate balance, having fun and not hurting someone&#39;s feelings. It&#39;s why they don&#39;t broadcast it out that &quot;Oh, we&#39;ve spooked another one!&quot; to the Greater Internet. Would you rather that they contacted you with the information that they&#39;ve sporked your work, along with some criticism, if the brief story they wrote didn&#39;t illustrate all the things you&#39;ve done wrong? Can you take the criticism that some people can and will heap on you, as per the apparently oft-not enforced rules of fanfiction.net, without attacking them? I understand that there are trolls out there who will intentionally reduce you to tears, but I assure you, The PPC is not that sort of people. I think I&#39;ll leave it at that, because anything else could bleed into my own opinions of morality and depravity.</p>

            <p>So let&#39;s look at <a href="http://1st-hashirama-senju.deviantart.com/journal/MST-s-PPC-and-Fanfics-626437426">this thing</a>. And in order to tick off the writer, I&#39;m going to do so in MST form. ^_^<br><br>LOU: Hi; Agent Louise, formerly of DOGA here.<br><br>NAR: And, uh, Narto, ditto. Why are we doing this?<br><br>LOU: Because it&#39;s funny. Roll the tape.<br><br><i>MSTs, Protectors of the Plot continuum, and those that take after them by “following the leader”;</i><br><br>NAR: Wait, people follow the PPC&#39;s example? Since when?<br><br>LOU: <i>Not</i> since about 2008, I&#39;m afraid.<br><br>a topic which is very sensitive flame-bait. Even more so when fanfics are the topic, which is the case here.<br><br>LOU: Unlike the times when we PPC things that <i>aren&#39;t</i> fanfic.<br><br><i>Was thinking about them and the moral questions that kept popping in.</i><br><br>NAR: Lou, didn&#39;t you say we ha- uh, were going to have grandkids who deal with the &#39;moral questions&#39; of the PPC?<br><br>LOU: Different type of questions; this is external-viewpoint stuff.<br><br>NAR: Oh, right. That.<br><br><i>First the most worrisome one, it is a very serious one.</i><br><br>LOU: &quot;My writing, it falls apart. Single-sentence paragraphs, like Yoda they sound.&quot;<br><br><i>I found this in TV tropes, it does not involve MSTs or PPC</i><br><br>NAR: So we&#39;re talking about it, why?<br><br><i>but it is a very real and possible scenario for the moral question.<br><br>Found via this link in the “N” section- <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TearJerker/FanFiction"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TearJerker/FanFiction">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TearJerker/FanFiction</a></a></i><br><br><hr>
<br><br>LOU: Whoa! Some warning on those lines, please!<br><br>NAR: ... what?<br><br><i>A Naruto Self-Insert Fic where a girl intentionally made her Self Insert a Mary Sue (She said so in the description.)</i><br><br>NAR: Is this one of those things where someone uses &#39;Mary Sue&#39; differently to us, and then complains about it?<br><br>LOU: I don&#39;t think so, actually. Which is a relief.<br><br><i>who thought her two team members and her sensei loved her and was so confident they&#39;d take a sword for her. Turns out, the two other members of the team absolutely hated her guts because she was so show-offy and smug. Then they tried to stop Hidan and Kakuzu, they literally didn&#39;t even try to save her as the others were trying to save their Sensei instead and literally threw her right in the way of Hidan&#39;s scythe and let him taste her blood so he wouldn&#39;t do that to them. Hidan then decided to break her legs and watch Kakuzu murder her sensei right in front of all three while the two members finally showed what they really thought of her and said &quot;So you finally lose, miss perfect!&#39;&#39; and are then murdered. Hidan decides she wasn&#39;t worth his time and instead just stabs himself through the stomach so she&#39;ll bleed to death, rejected by her friends and for the first time in her life, tasting failure. <br><br>From Bad to Worse because she actually survived and the Raikage thought she was behind the Akatsuki invasion and the loss of Yugito, and she would have been executed by his hand if not for the fact that someone else spoke up and saved her...and she had told that one person to &quot;... off&quot; earlier in the fic because she hated him.</i><br><br>NAR: Hooooooly-<br><br>LOU: That sounds like a really bad story, actually. Is that the point being made here?<br><br><i>For the love of God post a link </i><br><br>LOU: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON&#39;T.<br><br><i>I know the fic... unfortunately there&#39;s a meta tear jerker in there considering that the author had written the story (As well as many other extremely depressing fics!) but deleted them within about a year before vanishing off the internet, given that the author said she was really depressed and wrote the stories during a Creator Breakdown, chances are she might have actually committed suicide.</i><br><br>NAR: So the moral of the story is, uh... don&#39;t write while depressed, because it leads to messed-up fiction?<br><br>LOU: Don&#39;t <i>read</i> messed-up stories, because you might conclude on no evidence that the author committed suicide?<br><br>NAR: Don&#39;t-<br><br><hr>
<br><br>LOU: AUGH!<br><br>Nar: What?<br><br><i>Felt great sadness reading it. And did not even know the story, writer, or anything.</i><br><br>LOU: Oh, hey, Yoda&#39;s back.<br><br>NAR: And is really sad reading about a messed-up story, the author of which claimed to be depressed-<br><br>LOU: Claiming depression being wildly uncommon on the internet, as we know.<br><br>NAR: -and then deleted the story?<br><br>LOU: People only delete stories because they&#39;re killing themselves and don&#39;t want to leave a mess behind. Do you know nothing, Narto?<br><br><i>Now onto the moral question, made of several smaller questions</i><br><br>NAR: I thought we were already on the moral question? The first, most serious one?<br><br><i>what if one day the fanfic of a very depressed writer was MST&#39;d, PPC&#39;d, etc? What if it was done without the writer&#39;s permission? What if the writer found out and had a very reasonable reaction? What if the people who the writer is angry at refuse to show any ounce of basic compassion and sympathy? And what if that, in the worst case scenario, drives the writer over the edge and the writer committed suicide?</i><br><br>LOU: That is a very long string of What Ifs. What&#39;s the &#39;reasonable reaction&#39; the author had, exactly? And what are the PPCers showing no compassion or sympathy about?<br><br>NAR: I get the feeling the writer-<br><br>LOU: Yoda.<br><br>NAR: - Yoda things PPCers spit in the faces of anyone who questions their ways. Which, uh.<br><br>LOU: Yeah. &#39;Uh&#39;.<br><br><i>And in TV tropes, in the MST article, it was mentioned there&#39;s a code of honor for doing MSTs that can be condensed to-</i><br><br>LOU: There <i>is</i>? Am I going to be taken to MST Court for not reading it before MSTing?<br><br><i>1.Don&#39;t make a MST just to spite another writer, especially just because one doesn&#39;t like them personally- I&#39;ve seen this code of honor broken before, wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this is common.</i><br><br>LOU: Of course you wouldn&#39;t, you seem to think the worst of everyone.<br><br>NAR: Er... aren&#39;t <i>we</i> MSTing just to-?<br><br>LOU: No, we&#39;re doing it to analyse what&#39;s wrong with what Yoda said. But seriously, the PPC doesn&#39;t do this.<br><br><i>2. Ask for permission from the original writer, if they say no, don&#39;t do it. If they do not respond, you could still do it, but tread carefully - By the Mantle...Library of the Damned violates this big time. One member MST&#39;d one of my old fanfics, long since deleted by myself, and I didn&#39;t know for years. They never asked for permission. That same person also PPC&#39;d one of my fanfics without permission.</i><br><br>NAR: &quot;I say, you there! The one writing the bad fanfiction! Might we be permitted to prevent it from destroying the fabric of reality?&quot;<br><br>LOU: &quot;Certainly not! The canon is my plaything, to toy with as I will; you shall have no recourse in your efforts to preserve it from decay.&quot;<br><br>NAR: &quot;Righto! Just thought I&#39;d ask.&quot;<br><br><i>This lead to a predictable case of “extreme rage and anger overrides sense of reason”. For the Naruto equivalent- the Eight Gates. Dragon Ball Z- Super Saiyan. And to be honest, MST&#39;ers, PPC&#39;ers, and others who do that with fanfics should expect anger and hate directed at them, they should be prepared for it.</i><br><br>NAR: We are prepared for it. Is... is this supposed to be a threat or something?<br><br><i>3. Always remember to credit the original writer, even with fanfiction- This code of honor seems to be followed quite well from what I have seen.</i><br><br>LOU: You mean &#39;blame&#39;.<br><br><i>4. Don&#39;t hit below the belt with your humor.- This has been violated too, by Library of the Damned. It was one of my rage triggers when they did so to my fanfic. I was so angry almost all reason was tossed out the window. Though it seems they&#39;re trying to steer away from that, but the amount of success I wouldn&#39;t know.</i><br><br>NAR: I don&#39;t know precisely what he means, but I don&#39;t think we do this?<br><br>LOU: I&#39;m more worried by the &#39;you wrote comments into my stuff, now your life is forfeit!&#39; behaviour being condoned by Yoda here.<br><br>NAR: Doesn&#39;t anger lead to hate, and hate to suffering?<br><br><i>Another thing noticed was their apparent defensiveness. At Library of the Damned, I&#39;ve noticed they&#39;d get really defensive if they think they&#39;re being attacked or criticized in any way.</i><br><br>LOU: &quot;How dare the people I attack try to defend themselves?!&quot;<br><br><i>And seem to deflect any and all criticism, possibly moral questions as well.  Considering I tried to twice send a comment that was moderated, and it never showed up.</i><br><br>NAR: Yes, that&#39;s... that&#39;s how moderation works, sometimes. I don&#39;t think &#39;twice&#39; generalises to &#39;any and all&#39;.<br><br><i>And MST&#39;ing someone&#39;s fanfic or doing something similar like PPC can sadly cause them to give up.</i><br><br>LOU: That is sad. What should we do about it?<br><br>NAR: Yoda&#39;s going with &#39;tell them you think their story sucks so badly that you want to kill it, and ask if they&#39;ll let you&#39;.<br><br>LOU: Unorthodox, I admit...<br><br><i>And its really no surprise if it is a mean spirited MST or PPC writing.</i><br><br>NAR: The PPC isn&#39;t mean-spirited.<br><br>LOU: Uh...<br><br>NAR: Correction: PPC <i>writings</i> aren&#39;t mean-spirited. Agents are mean-spirited towards each other all the time.<br><br><i>There&#39;s one possible case in Library of the Damned. It really appeared to be a young writer and apparently the people there refused to show any basic compassion, sympathy, or pity. This drove the writer to apparently give up. Couldn&#39;t locate the profile or story anymore. Felt so bad for the writer, since it could have been a writer who was just testing the waters and got that in response.</i><br><br>LOU: &#39;possible case&#39;, &#39;really appeared&#39;, &#39;apparently refused&#39;, &#39;apparently gave up&#39;, &#39;could have been&#39;. Five &#39;I don&#39;t know&#39;s in as many sentences. That&#39;s impressive!<br><br><i>I also went into Library of the Damned as Neji7Hyuga.</i><br><br>NAR: &quot;But some call me... Yoda.&quot;<br><br><i>I could never bring myself down</i><br><br>LOU: &#39;Up&#39;.<br><br>NAR: Autocorrect gets weirder every day.<br><br><i>to their level, and eventually stopped altogether after seeing them for who they really were.<br><br>Thus a simple question presents itself- why do MST&#39;ers and PPC&#39;ers and the like see the need to hide what they do from people?</i><br><br>NAR: Uh, didn&#39;t you say it was because otherwise they&#39;d all suicide en masse?<br><br><i>Why do they see the need to not tell the writers that they MST&#39;d or PPC&#39;d their fanfics? If they think it helps writers improve, would it be considered a good thing to tell the writers so they know what they are writing is bad? So they can improve?</i><br><br>LOU: Honestly, yes, it <i>is</i> good to give concrit, and back in the day PPCers often left helpful reviews on badfics. But in the case of old stories, or trollfics, there&#39;s little point, no?<br><br><i>As one Fanfiction.net writer has in their profile, something I really like- the phrase &quot;if you have nothing nice to say, don&#39;t say anything&quot; doesn&#39;t mean &quot;if you don&#39;t have anything to say that doesn&#39;t hurt a persons feelings, don&#39;t say anything at all&quot;,</i><br><br>NAR: To a lot of people, it does. &#39;If you don&#39;t like, don&#39;t read&#39;, remember?<br><br><i>it means &quot;if you don&#39;t have anything polite to say, don&#39;t say anything at all&quot;. I agree so much, telling someone the honest truth is polite, tearing them down while doing so is not.<br><br>And if they throw a tantrum despite one being nice, maybe they simply aren&#39;t ready to be posting online. Understandable if they throw one due to someone being less than polite. Even more so for someone being completely rude.</i><br><br>LOU: Whoa, there! Yoda, you&#39;re saying something the PPC would <i>never</i> say - that young people who haven&#39;t yet learned how to cope with criticism should just get off the internet. That has <i>absolutely never</i> been the PPC&#39;s position.<br><br>NAR: So... does this mean Yoda is a worse person than us?<br><br>LOU: I don&#39;t know; that sounds like it might be &#39;hitting below the belt&#39;.<br><br><i>MST&#39;ing a published work is on more stable ground, since one has to pay money and if it sucks, then they have your money.</i><br><br>NAR: Does this mean we can&#39;t MST TV shows? What about library books?<br><br>LOU: Listen to logic, Yoda will not.<br><br><i>Unlike a bad fanfic, which one can just stop reading at no cost.</i><br><br>LOU: Except to the soul.<br><br><i>To use an example of a published work- if someone read Twilight and watched the movies, and hated them enough. And wanted to MST them, the Freedom of Speech allows them to do so.</i><br><br>NAR: Unsolicited <i>Twilight</i>-bashing. Yoda, you are truly the people&#39;s hero.<br><br><i>However, they can&#39;t go too far, can&#39;t hit below the belt or they could get sued for slander.</i><br><br>LOU: &quot;It is not! I resent that. Slander is spoken. In print, it&#39;s <i>libel</i>.&quot;<br><br>NAR: ... is it over?<br><br>LOU: Apparently. It just... stops.<br><br>NAR: So... what was the point of it?<br><br>LOU: Um... &#39;politely tell people you want to kill their stories, so they&#39;ll commit suicide and stop bothering you&#39;.<br><br>NAR: Was that below the belt?<br><br>LOU: Yoda doesn&#39;t wear a belt. Too short, he is.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>LOU: AUGH!<br><br>Sorry, Lou. Yeah, I think they&#39;ve covered it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;Piss&quot; is vulgar, at least here in the US. We say &quot;pee&quot; or &quot;urine&quot; if we must discuss it at all outside our closest circles (and I think it&#39;s mostly just men who use &quot;piss&quot; even with close friends).<br><br>&quot;Pissed off&quot; isn&#39;t very strongly associated with the bodily fluid, but it&#39;s still more PG-13 than PG, and not the sort of language we want to see thrown around all the time. Family-friendly versions include &quot;ticked off,&quot; &quot;cheesed off,&quot; &quot;hacked off,&quot; etc. (Don&#39;t ask me why.) Best to save &quot;pissed off&quot; for when you really mean it, and even then, it&#39;s better to try logic before resorting to strong language to make a point.<br><br>Also, just in case anyone doesn&#39;t know this: &quot;to be pissed&quot; in the US means to be angry; in the UK, it means to be drunk. Know who&#39;s speaking and who you&#39;re speaking to lest there be confusion!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Here in Israel the equivalent of &quot;piss&quot; (which is slang) is commonly used and the &quot;clean&quot; word is only ever used in formal writing (like a doctor&#39;s diagnosis); people who want to avoid slang avoid mentioning it altogether (and say something that roughly means &quot;small needs&quot;).</p>

            <p>For thousands of years, our European colleagues in the wizarding community have harped on one constant message: magic wands are better. They allow more advanced magic, more easily, with more control. They let witches and wizards who would otherwise be limited to a few minor curses craft elaborate charms and spells. &quot;The wand did for magic what fire did for cooking,&quot; as one famous history put it.<br><br>All of this is true.<br><br>Strangely absent from the discourse coming out of Europe, though, is the terrible <i>cost</i> of wands. Not monetary cost - the cost to the living things whose powers we are stealing to fuel our own.<br><br>Does the phoenix feel the energy leave it each time one of its feathers is encased in wood? Does the rare magically-attuned oak or ash realise how it is exploited, when its branches are harvested to fuel human wizardry? How many magical creatures have had their lives lessened, shortened, by the leeching of their power to serve our ends?<br><br>It is not the time to turn away from the use of wands; every witch and wizard on the planet sees them as indispensable to &#39;proper&#39; magic. But can we not be more considerate in their use? Can we not see them for what they are - tools for extracting another creature&#39;s power and using it to feed our own? If we can, then perhaps we can set foot on the path towards a new, kinder mode of magic.<br><br>-This message brought to you by the Wizarding Association of Non-Europeans (W.A.N.E.)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Consider the following:<br><br>-Wands, using animal and plant material, were invented by Europeans, <i>not</i> by the reportedly animal-and-plant-attuned Native Americans.<br><br>-According to <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wand_wood">Ollivander</a>, &quot;Only a minority of trees can produce wand quality wood (just as a minority of humans can produce magic).&quot; There is a direct parallel between magic-using humans and magic-producing trees.<br><br>-Wands are quasi-intelligent, able to choose and bond with their owners. Where does the intelligence come from? <br><br>-The only instance we see of a creature deliberately giving material for a wand - the Horned Serpent&#39;s gift to Isolt Sayre - <a href="https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ilvermorny">comes across</a> as a significant and powerful act of almost mystical significance: &quot;...she went down to the creek to find the Horned Serpent, which rose up out of the water and bowed its head to her while she shaved a long shard from its horn.&quot;<br><br>-According to at least one report, Newt Scamander&#39;s wand does <i>not</i> contain normal animal material. Its core appears to be either bone or shell, both of which are only obtainable after the creature is dead (and thus no longer needs its innate powers). Newt, of course, is the wizard we know of who&#39;s most in tune with fantastic beasts (other than Hagrid, whose wand has... an unknown core).<br><br>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a wild extrapolation to think that wands make use of their sources&#39; magic, and that they lessen it somehow by doing so. From that it follows that their creation and introduction to various places at various times was probably highly controversial.<br><br>Note that Isolt&#39;s introduction of wand-making to the Americas is deftly done: she built it on a foundation of respect for the magical creatures, which apparently continued long after (remember the mystery of obtaining <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/White_River_Monster">White River Monster spines</a>?). In contrast, European wizards grab shed unicorn hairs and sell them for profit.<br><br>Obviously all this is my own extrapolation (and W.A.N.E. is my own creation), but I think it fits. Thoughts from the gallery? I&#39;m happy to be wrong if I&#39;m wrong. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...This IS magic we&#39;re talking about here. It&#39;s completely reasonable to assume energy isn&#39;t taken from the origin of the wand&#39;s material because magic breaks known physics. For example, Polyjuice potions create matter out of nothing. It is therefore not a terrible mental stretch to say they do the same with energy.</p>

            <p>Is that wands do not hold an <i>active</i> connection to the core&#39;s source: Harry&#39;s and Voldemort&#39;s wands do take their power from Fawkes, Fleur doesn&#39;t take magic from her grandmother, etc.<br><br>While wiki-diving, I&#39;ve come across a bit that says about &quot;<i>residual power stored in a wand</i>&quot;, so that&#39;s how I think of it: core substances have some residual power of the creature that came from and that&#39;s the wand&#39;s fuel - not enough for the (still alive) creature to feel the difference, but enough for a human to do some pretty awesome magic. <br><br>Now, having a core substance with the amount of power, the wood with the power (Giggity), and the wizard&#39;s innate power - and they do have some, since wandless magic exists in general - I&#39;d say that&#39;s quite an amount of magical power, enough for a human wizard&#39;s life.</p>

            <p>Across five continents, witches and wizards knew that magic cast by their own innate skill and power was the purest and most ethical mode of magic.

            <p>I mean, it could go any way - maybe wand material loses power when you transfer it, maybe it retains exactly equal power, or maybe the witch-wood-beast synergy gives more power than the three individually.<br><br>Actually, question: is there any indication in canon that it&#39;s possible to run out of magic, or not have enough to cast a spell?

            <p>Hey, guys. Happened to be on the wiki just now and noticed that some anonymous person added a page for a Potterverse fic called &quot;<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Becoming_Female">Becoming Female</a>.&quot; Since this is not the sort of thing that should be done without discussion, would anyone care to identify themself as the person responsible, and tell us why they think we need a page for it so we can talk about it?<br><br>If no one comes forward, I move we delete the page unless plenty of people have already heard of this fic and have a case for why this badfic out of all badfic in the world is so relevant to us we need an article about it. To be fair, it sounds pretty bad, but we&#39;re not running Badfic Wiki; we&#39;re running PPC Wiki.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I mean, there&#39;s nothing about it that really stood out to me other than the fact it was written to be as blatantly over-the-top as possible, to the point where I&#39;m 99% sure it&#39;s supposed to be parody.<br><br>I&#39;m in favor of deleting the page. </p>

            <p>If it&#39;s not trolling or parody it&#39;s definitely bleep; even as parody it has some really squicky parts. However nobody missioned it (yet) and it&#39;s not Legendary, so off with the page&#39;s head, I say.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not hugely into the genre, so I won&#39;t be much good for consultation, but one author I particularly like is Charles de Lint. His writing is really beautiful, and so is his imagination. You might get some good ideas by reading his novels and short story collections.<br><br>Also, if I may plug a friend of mine, look up Catherine Butzen. Her books <i>Thief of Midnight</i> and <i>Fell the Angels</i> are about a group of monster-hunters in Chicago, and might remind you of another secret organization that protects the normal world from reality-warping bad guys. {= ) <i>The God Collector</i> is a bit more on the supernatural romance side, but is also set in Chicago and quite good. I dunno if it will be hard to get her books overseas, but you&#39;d be supporting someone who deserves it if you can manage it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>My comment on it to Kaitlyn was &#39;it&#39;s a really, really good book, provided you can get past the first three chapters&#39;. The monster-hunters definitely have that PPCish vibe, but the real show-stealers are- oh, but that would be telling. ^_~<br><br><i>The God Collector</i>... well, I always planned to write up a review of it, but the first line really tells it all: I loved everything about this book, except the protagonist. It&#39;s not that she&#39;s <i>unlikable</i> - I just don&#39;t understand a single one of her decisions during the first 2/3 of the book. But the book itself is brilliant.<br><br>(<i>Fell the Angels</i> isn&#39;t available in these parts, so no comment there.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t have a copy of the adventure anymore but it&#39;s out there. I used to run it at cons. The character was a dude named Surge. He was a contact in the adventure, and a JackPoint member. Got referenced in one of the two or three page supplements Catalyst released for 4e. He was my first successful runner (ie the first one to not die or get arrested) so I decided to do more with him.</p>

            <p>In other words, fictional curses!<br><br>Fictional curses have always interested me. They add color (ha) to the universe, they can be used for emphasis without annoying me (I&#39;m not much for actual foul language), and I can say them without feeling guilty. You white-livered sons of goats. =]<br><br>So I was wondering, what are some of your favorite fictional curses, and why? &quot;Blood and ashes&quot; and &quot;Burn you!&quot; from <i>The Wheel of Time</i> are my favorites, followed closely by &quot;Storms!&quot; and &quot;Storming [x]!&quot; from <i>The Stormlight Archive</i>, because they fit very well in their respective universes. <br><br>-Alleb (it feels like it&#39;s been forever since I&#39;ve posted!)</p>

            <p>is the main Hani swear from the <i>Chanur</i> novels, which is &quot;[gods] rot [x]&quot;. For example, &quot;Gods rot the internet in this building.&quot;, which feels like the right thing to say when it takes five minutes to connect to campus wifi. As with many swearwords, it&#39;s short and grammatically versatile, with derivatives ranging from &quot;gods!&quot; to &quot;gods-rotted&quot;.<br><br>From the same books, &quot;gods-be&quot; is probably a euphemism for <i>something</i>, and works OK for general-purpose frustration. <br><br>(And there&#39;s the tangential question of why any of these expressions might be swearwords.

            <p>The curse is from Scott Westerfeld&#39;s <i>Leviathan</i> series, which I mostly read for the sake of seeing people use that curse (and the steampunk animal-dirigibles, of course). Scott Westerfeld&#39;s books in general have pretty great slang; he borrows from everywhere. &quot;Barking spiders&quot; used to be a Victorian euphemism for farting, but <a href="http://www.tor.com/2009/10/30/joemonti/">it fit the setting better as a curse</a>.<br><br><i>Fly By Night</i>, by Frances Hardinge, (as well as the sequel) has some fun stuff: &quot;pixelated&quot; is used to insult someone, saying their senses must have been stolen by the pixies. There&#39;s lots of different kinds of slang in that book, because there are lots of dialects, and it&#39;s full of competing rulers and gods to swear on.<br><br>This is historical fiction, so it&#39;s probably based on real curses, but Karen Cushman&#39;s <i>Catherine Called Birdie</i>, a book I really loved when I was about ten, has a nice part about curses. It&#39;s set in medieval England, and the title character (a girl of mildly noble birth) hears that at court, everyone has their own individual curses, usually along the lines of &quot;G-d&#39;s [body part]!&quot; So she spends months going through ideas, trying to find one of her own. The nice-sounding ones like &quot;G-d&#39;s beard!&quot; and &quot;G-d&#39;s teeth!&quot; are taken, so she&#39;s playing with curses like &quot;G-d&#39;s elbows!&quot; and driving her family crazy.<br><br>--Key</p>

Also, most of them are easy and satisfying to say. Shards! Shells! Shaffit! Fardles! It&#39;ll be a warm day <i>between</i> before I get tired of them.

            <p>From Mistborn, we also have &quot;By The Lord Ruler!&quot;, but you can always swear by any noun. Examples include Calamity, The Eternal Sparks(Steelheart); Gorlog&#39;s beard, teeth, and eyebrows (Ranger&#39;s Apprentice); Tartarus (PJO), Ruin (Mistborn), and etc. I personally would use The Avatars, from Dragonfable.</p>

            <p>If you were around in January, you might remember we (DCCCV?) found a website that lets you simulate a Hunger Games. It caught on both here and in HQ, with two full seasons being &#39;broadcast&#39;:<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cY4fPMjuO-YhzYJUdY3OpL_XM7879uH1Lveo2wGSBn4/pub">Season 2</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QvGcNvVmTo6N9YtsZa6bHjFpMJDpB48870ukFg1kGkU/pub">Season 3</a><br><br>Would anybody be interested in another round? To make it interesting, I&#39;ve just spent a couple of days creating a completely custom arena - we&#39;re not putting them in a cheerful nature reserve <i>this</i> time. Muahahaha, etc.<br><br>If you want your agents to take part, go ahead and list up to four, in order of preference. (Everyone should get at least their first two; what happens after that depends on how many people want to join in.) They should be agents <b>owned by you</b>, and you should have Permission (since the broadcast is canon - don&#39;t worry, all the danger is holographic!). If there are free-to-use characters you&#39;d really like to see, mention them separately; I might need them for filling gaps.<br><br>I&#39;m hoping to run the Games much like Sergio did for Season 3 - interviews with the competitors after each day, plus commentary from the producers. Responding to interview requests isn&#39;t required, though.<br><br>Any takers?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hello, and for the last time… welcome to the Fourth PPC HQ Hunger Games.<br><br>You may have heard the rumours about our… difficulties with a number of former tributes. You may be worried that we are in danger from their actions. But we can assure you that there&#39;s nothing to worry about; every precaution has been taken to keep us safe.<br><br><i>And if they believe that, they&#39;ll-</i><br><br>So! We left off at the end of day seven, with four contestants in the game. For District Eagle Hawk, Kyaris the hydra. Fresh from taking out Derik in an awe-inspiring lightsaber duel, she&#39;s injured now, but still a force to be reckoned with.<br><br>From District PoorCynic, Gremlin, hatchet-wielding and dedicated. Of all the contestants, she&#39;s the one who&#39;s been planning ahead the most - but will that be enough?<br><br>Hieronymus of District Grey Tomatoes has followed a meandering path through the game. His usual tactic is to befriend the other tributes and take them out while their guard is down, but can he pull it off again?<br><br>And finally, Whitney from District Desdenskar. Relentlessly cheerful and able to make the best of every situation, she&#39;s had her ups and downs, but is now ready for the final days.<br><br><i>Which have already happened. We already know who won, it was-</i><br><br>Notte! Suspense! As night dawned, our tributes made camp once again. More precisely, Kyaris drained the cafeteria of coffee to keep watch all night, while the other three teamed up - the very last teamup of the Games - and spent a quiet night playing D&amp;D.<br><br><i>We&#39;ll have to ask in the interviews who won.</i><br><br>Morning revealed a day of planning and preparation. Three of the agents went on hunts: Whitney for the HQ Pool, Hieronymus for his RC, and Kyaris for the Fountain of Bleepka. What Whitney and Hieronymus intended, we don&#39;t know, but Kyaris&#39; plan involved drinking almost half of the fountain.<br><br>As for Gremlin, we&#39;re not sure what she was up to - she&#39;s proven expert at avoiding the cameras - but we do know she got a medical kit from someone outside. Perhaps someone had sympathy for her endless quest to find Medical earlier in the game?<br><br>Night fell, and proved that planning is key. While Hieronymus continued to work on his plans for the morning, Kyaris managed to herd or trick Whitney and Gremlin into a Response Centre and seal the door. A blast of bleepka fumes from her many heads finished them off.<br><br><i>We&#39;re going to have to get the mad chemists to look into that. Was it the bleach that proved so deadly? The alcohol? Or what?</i><br><br>Who knows? Does even Kyaris know? We certainly don&#39;t! All we know is that Day 9 opened on the final, fateful showdown: Kyaris versus Hieronymus, age versus heads. Whoever won would claim the final victory.<br><br><i>It was Kyaris.</i><br><br>Oh, come on! I had a whole speech written about it! I was going to slowly work in the Sherlock Holmes references, and then end it with-<br><br><i>She pushed him down the elevator shaft.</i><br><br>&quot;-which will henceforth be known as the Reichenbach Lift.&quot; It was <i>perfect</i>, and you had to go and ruin it.<br><br><i>Yes. Yes I did.</i><br><br><i>Fine</i>. See if I care. So Kyaris is the winner, good for her. She also shares joint second place in number of kills across the Games with Constance, coming in at five. Third place with four kills is split between Gremlin and Tomash, while the winner, with an astonishing seven kills, is Peregrin.<br><br>Trophies for these and other notable achievements will be distributed at the awards ceremony. To those of you who are still baying for our blood: sorry to disappoint, but we will not be attending in person. We&#39;re not that stupid.<br><br><i>You say that…</i><br><br>Tune in after the break for the final round of interviews. Thanks for watching!<br><hr>
<br><i>We all take for granted the weird world we live in - the strange dimensional nature of HQ, the way canon worlds can be both real and fictional, the coexistence of dozens of mutually-exclusive magical systems. But if you&#39;ve ever found yourself wanting answers to some of the endless questions, or if you&#39;ve ever wanted to know more about the multiverse, why not subscribe to DAS-JIVE? You can pick up the first volume in the General Store now.<br><br>The Journal of Investigating Veracity by Experiment is published by Nutmeg Print, on behalf of DAS. Answers to specific questions mentioned are not guarenteed.</i><br><hr>

You can also have a hunt for Undis Closed, if you want; I might chime in with &#39;events at the broadcast station&#39; if that happens.<br><br>I&#39;d like to thank everyone for taking part. I&#39;d especially like to thank PoorCynic and SkarmorySilver for their artwork, and PoorCynic (again!) for the glory that has been Holo-Acacia and Gremlin. But I also want to thank absolutely everybody who&#39;s written even a single interview; it wouldn&#39;t have been half as much fun without you.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Whitney: What a journey! I am thrilled to have been a part of these games from start to finish, and I am not in any way disappointed that I came in third place. Especially since there were so many people who entered to begin with!<br><br>And to my friends who were hoping or expecting me to be the victor, don&#39;t be discouraged. Being the last one standing is by no means easy, and I was fully aware that the other members of the final four were just as experienced and skilled as I was - or better, in the case of Kyaris. I admire her strength and cunning, especially for an Intel member as I&#39;ve since learned. I wouldn&#39;t have expected anything less from her, and I cannot congratulate her enough for her achievement.<br><br>At any rate, it&#39;s been a pleasure, everyone. I do hope our many, MANY paths will all cross eac other again next season!</p>

            <p>-t works against tracking spells? Some sort of anti-magic field?<br><br><i>A tinfoil hat, maybe?</i><br><br>Don&#39;t be snarky. What about ysalamiri? Does the Force count as magical enough that they could also block-<br><br><i>Camera.</i><br><br>What? No, cameras don&#39;t hide you from magic, that&#39;s-<br><br><i>Welcome back to the Hunger Games. Sorry about the mess.</i><br><br>Oh, right. We left off with seven survivors about to go into the sixth night. Two of them took a peaceful approach - Will and Hieronymus, who camped out together. So did Ajax and Whitney, actually, but how &#39;peaceful&#39; can you call it when Gremlin sneaks in and steals your kit?<br><br>The other two… well. We like to think that a lightsaber duel with a hydra is how Derik would have wanted to go.<br><br><i>I kind of doubt it, though.</i><br><br>Me too, but oh well: he&#39;s out. Turns out having one leg isn&#39;t very useful in combat.<br><br>So day dawned, and Gremlin returned to Ajax&#39;s camp to finish the job. Forsaking her trademark hatchet, she brought a lightning gun into play. Shocking!<br><br><i>Don&#39;t do that.</i><br><br>Meanwhile, Hieronymus demonstrated that &#39;peaceful&#39; is overrated in the Games: after using Will&#39;s company to keep him safe during the night, he showed no qualms about killing him in the morning.<br><br>The other two had problems of their own: Whitney found herself alarmingly sane, while Kyaris managed to trip and break a rib, which is a serious problem for a quadroped. But they both survived, and that&#39;s what counts.<br><br>Four tributes are left: Gremlin, Kyaris, Hieronymus, Whitney. But there can be only one victor. Tomorrow, we&#39;ll find out who.<br><hr>
<br><i>Sad? Depressed? Just plain miserable? Yeah, we know how that can be. Even in HQ - the best workplace in the multiverse! - sometimes things get you down.<br><br>If that happens to you, why not visit with your friendly Morale Officer? With a range of inspiring slogans and delicious cookies, nothing is more guaranteed to perk you up after a hard mission.<br><br>Go PPC!</i><br><hr>
<br>Over in the runoffs, morning broke with a surprising announcement: a feast! All six survivors headed for the cafeteria, but not all of them made it: Alleb had apparently neglected to eat anything for the entire game, and up and died on us on the way there. Kind of an embarassing way to go.<br><br>Team Murder may be gone, but Harris made a stab at a new Team Ambush. He and Gerry snuck up on Constance, trying to take her out of the Games. Hey, quick tip to the Infrastructure guys: never surprise a lady while she&#39;s gathering weapons. I hope this also puts paid to all those rumours about her and Harris.<br><br>Across the cafeteria, disaster struck! Corolla, avenging angel - fairy? - that she is, was struck down by Sarah. Nooooo! Would Sarah&#39;s reign of terror consume the Games, or could Constance bring her down?<br><br>Well… let me put it like this. Constance was collecting weapons. Sarah was stealing bananas.<br><br>&quot;Avada Kedavra!&quot;<br><br>We have our winner: Constance Sims, formerly of the DMS, Medical, and FicPsych. Her victory nets her a place of honour in the final ranking: 49th place!<br><br>… hmm. That doesn&#39;t sound as impressive as I hoped. Oh, well. I&#39;m Dafydd Illian, this is NTV, and you should all watch <i>Ardolindi</i> when it comes on again.<br><hr>
<br><i>Reject the lies of the usurper! Follow the path of the true Sunflower Official! The Hunger Games say fire is catching - but the truth is catchinger! The brutal murder of our TRUE leader cannot be denied!<br><br>And next time I offer you a pamphlet, Just Say Yes!</i><br><hr>
<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Tz6_uDVaEW8J-YMEdxm2F7v8tD1T9q77UkCyPfo9bE/pub">Transcript in the doc</a>, though most of it worked its way into the report.<br><br>I want to stress, again, that both of these games are the very first run I&#39;ve made with each setup, and that I didn&#39;t check the outcome before I started writing. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not <i>happy</i> Constance won, but I don&#39;t want people to think I set it up.<br><br>Also: the banana-versus-wand duel and the Derik-Kyaris duel would both be epically amazing as pictures. Particularly the latter.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Whitney: I suppose having all of my items taken really would put things into perspective. Luckily, I have plenty of experience fighting with my bare hands, though everyone else may be just as dangerous in their own way. But I have to ask... Is it all worth it? Why do we host these games? And why must I have the virtual blood of so many on my hands? Guess I&#39;ll have to talk things over with everyone once these games are finished.<br>Ah, well. Tomorrow, hopefully, we shall see who is the victor! Good luck to all!<br><br>Sarah: Awwww, I was like, THIS close to actually winning! Sort of. Ah, well. I&#39;m glad I wasn&#39;t in dead last, at least. This was fun, all in all, embarrassments aside obviously.

            <p>-st make sure we keep moving. There&#39;s at least six of them after us right now, and Sergio is dang- oh, we&#39;re on?<br><br>Hello! And welcome back to the PPC HQ Hunger Games. Yesterday was quiet - almost, one might say, too quiet. Today… wasn&#39;t.<br><br>Seven tributes remain, spread across seven districts. Let&#39;s take a look at how it came to this.<br><br>The night was almost peaceful. We had only one violent death - Nikki Cherryflower apparently looks too much like a Suvian for her own good. Our other death was the always-taciturn Canon Librarian, who apparently suffered from a lack of bleeprin. Elsewhere, Derik tried to trick Will into suiciding, but with no luck, and Marina proved there can still be mercy in the late stages of the Games when she spared Ajax.<br><br><i>Undis? We need to get to Station Five, this one&#39;s compromised. It&#39;s that wretched-</i><br><br>Oh! And here&#39;s Notte Ling, ready to tell you all about his favourite moment of the night.<br><br><i>Wha-? Oh. Uh, yeah. It was the bit where the old dude tried to get the champion to go to bed with him. Come <b>on</b>, Undis.</i><br><br>We&#39;re still rolling, Notte. And as morning rolled around, we decided to give the tributes something to look forward to: a feast! We stocked the Cafeteria to the brim, sent out the call, and waited for them to come.<br><br>Not everyone did, of course. Some, like Derik, were too busy lurking; others, like Holo-Acacia, don&#39;t need such things as food. But the others flocked in, and the blood poured out.<br><br>The first kill went to Luxury. We don&#39;t want to know what she needed those bananas for, but apparently it was important enough to kill! Sorry, Falchion; you should never get between a lady and her fruit. Then Peregrin… well, lighting the Cafeteria on fire was a good plan in principle, but it might have been better to step back afterwards?<br><br>Backlit by the flames, Whitney had no problem bringing Hop down with that chair. And we&#39;ve no idea how Ajax went unseen - just that he succeeded where no-one last year did, and brought down the reigning champion! Sorry, Lola, but this time, you&#39;re out. As for Marina… she may have showed compassion last night, but Will showed her none this morning.<br><br>The survivors of the feast, and those who never attended, spread out across HQ. When they met in the corridors, conflict was certain. Will managed to flee from Derik, but Holo-Acacia wasn&#39;t so lucky - all her hoarded weapons were useless against a grey-bearded human. And Luxury&#39;s legendary charm proved to be no shield against a well-cast <i>Avada Kedavra</i>.<br><br>As for Nurse Elms… what can we say? CADs are explosive at the best of times.<br><br>So seven remain. Kyaris, the many-headed beast, friendly but deadly. Derik, the Phantom of Headquarters, lurking in the shadows. Gremlin, hatchet-wielding and more than a little unhinged. Ajax, the powers of a god in a hesitant body. Hieronymus, elderly, charming, and lethal when he wants to be. Will, the laid-back warlock who&#39;s already planning his victory. And Whitney, cheerful, collected, and coming for every last one of them.<br><br>Who will win? Who will lose out? Only tomorrow will tell.<br><br><i>Undis, those are explosions, we <b>really</b> have to go.</i><br><br>After the break, Dafydd with the runoffs, and then the interviews. Bye!<br><hr>

OFUs United: why suffer later, when you can get it over with now?</i><br><hr>
<br>Rather them than me. So, the main games were a murder-fest? Ours were a lot quieter, but we&#39;re still down to fewer survivors.<br><br>The first night was basically a wash. The remnants of Team Murder split up, and I was biting my metaphorical nails when my avenger Corolla let Harris sing her to sleep. But perhaps killing Laura slaked his thirst for killing, at least for a while. Constance, meanwhile, spent a delightfully geeky night with Captain Dandy. I had hopes for a teamup, but it was not to be.<br><br>As day broke, almost everyone went their separate ways. Our Corolla hung out with Sarah, who spent her second day in a row trying to keep her companion quiet. Alleb, who received assistance from Medical overnight, continued her association with authority: she befriended or at least be-made-herself-useful-ed the Tiger Lily, who was apparently the best choice of Flower to team up with, since Captain Dandy was busy drowning himself in the Fountain. Plants, huh?<br><br>Constance, meanwhile, got a bit introspective. I can&#39;t blame her; I find myself a bit too sane for this sort of thing now, too.<br><br>Hey, I said a <i>bit</i>.<br><br>Night fell again. The dreaded Hatchet Sponsor paid a visit, giving Gerry a weapon of her very own. Apart from that… well, Corolla kept her distance from everyone, which was a good idea, because they were all very busy being murderous.<br><br>Corolla&#39;s daytime companion Sarah encountered the Tiger Lily, and demonstrated alarming skill in bringing down the Flower. Alleb ran into Zee, whose inability to be quiet had already irritated Sarah on the first day; Alleb chose to express her annoyance in death. And Constance… well, I guess she figured someone as dangerous as Harris had to be charmed to keep him friendly. Add in her vicious attack on Richard when he stumbled across the two of them, and-<br><br>What? No, we don&#39;t have an &#39;open marriage&#39;, thank you very much.

            <p>$Interviewer: &quot;Went out in a blaze of glory, eh?&quot;<br><br>Peregrin: &quot;There was a blaze. Glory, I&#39;m not certain about. &#39;Carelessness&#39; might be more appropriate. <br><br>I believe a &#39;strike-anywhere&#39; match from a package I was taking rubbed against a small explosive of some kind, which set the nearby supplies on fire.

However, I would be willing to consult on matters of universal topology or geometry if needed. Speaking of topology, do you know anyone who would be willing to run experiments about Headquarters? I have several theories, but I have found myself short of data, as usual.&quot;</p>

            <p>Okay, so I have good news and bad news. The good news is that we have something extra special coming up after this report - more on that later. The bad news is that today was utterly boring.<br><br>Nobody died. <i>Nobody!</i> Where&#39;s the fun in that? The best we had to watch last night was reigning champion Lola sneaking into the cafeteria for food, or the bizarre spectacle of Peregrin trying to bandage a hologram&#39;s injuries.<br><br><i>Be fair; Derik and Hop&#39;s sleep-duel was entertaining.</i><br><br>Yes, until they woke up. And once everyone was awake… more nothing! Just a bunch of people running away from each other all day, plus Derik doing his best to electrocute himself.<br><br><i>So are you thinking about running the-?</i><br><br>Shh! And yes. But that still doesn&#39;t make up for today. Not even seeing Lux try to seduce holo-Acacia makes up for today.<br><br><i>It&#39;s pretty funny, though.</i><br><br>… true.<br><br>Well! After that awful report, it&#39;s time for some good news. We&#39;ll take a short break, and then we&#39;ll have an extra special report from NTV&#39;s very own… Dafydd Illian!<br><hr>
<br><i>Some Suvians just won&#39;t die. Some CAFs resist everything you can throw at them. Some wraiths are just too corporeal to exorcise.<br><br>Fortunately, there is a solution. Order Ye Olde Poisonous Poison now, and never find killing too hard again.</i><br><hr>
<br>Hello. Before I start, I have to correct Undis Closed: I am not &#39;NTV&#39;s own&#39;. I work with them occasionally, but never for them. Got it? Good.<br><br>Now: you know what&#39;s worse than getting killed in the Hunger Games? That&#39;s right: getting killed early in the Hunger Games. All that anticipation, all that training, and you just go out straight away. It&#39;s awful. This year, that was me, going out in the Qualifiers. So a few of us got together, talked to NTV, and persuaded them to simulate a run-off, to give us all a second chance.<br><br>Then we had to bully or abduct all the <i>other</i> failed qualifiers. That took a while, but finally we were ready. We headed into the backup holodeck, and ran the program.<br><br>And then I got killed. <i>Again.</i> Navare wasn&#39;t even aiming for me - he had his sights on Zee, but… missed. For all that, though, I&#39;m not quite last place in the Games - that honour goes to Laura Dukes, who found Harris quite unwilling to grant her quarter. Then, seconds before I took my hit, Morgan stabbed July out of the games, giving me a comfortable 70th place.<br><br>The bloodbath lived up to its name for once: Richard took out Hip, while Colt and Jesse ganged up on Barid. Holo-Acacia&#39;s holo-partner, Holo-Jay, took a stab at Corolla, but the little Unison Device was only stunned. Not the only one - Constance managed to knock herself out, too. Oh dear, love.<br><br>So the survivors spread out into HQ, and we saw an immediate teamup I&#39;m going to call Team Murder: Richard, Jesse, and Harris. They didn&#39;t manage to kill anyone, though: that honour went to Corolla, who succeeded in poisoning Navare. Obviously, I was cheering her on. Connie managed to hunt down the Canon Library and spent the day reading - attagirl.<br><br>And then, just as everyone was winding up for the night, bang: out went the lights. The producers had sprung one of their dreaded arena event, and it was absolute mayhem. Team Murder got separated in the confusion: Richard managed to hunt down Colt and eliminate him as competition, but Jesse ended up falling to the Tiger Lily.<br><br>Nor were they the only ones. Our two Time Lords, Morgan and the Aviator, both tried to portal away from the darkness, but both portal generators malfunctioned. You might think that sounds suspicious- oh, hello, it&#39;s Sergio, isn&#39;t it? How nice to see you. Hmm? Oh - pause recording.<br><br>-esume. Sorry about that. The rest of the deaths were a mixture of skill and comedy. Ix and Rayner essentially suicided against Zee and Sarah in the dark, while Corolla successfully stalked and killed Doctor Peep. Since I&#39;m on her side, I assume the Doctor was an archvillain of some description. But the kill of the event goes to Agent Alleb, who first robbed Holo-Jay of everything except the shirt on her back, then came back and laid her out cold.<br><br>Constance, you&#39;ll be glad to know, stayed in the library the entire time. I think she had a torch.<br><br>So, by the end of day one of the runoffs, more than half of us were dead. Only ten tributes remained to go into the first night - which we&#39;ll see tomorrow.<br><br>Oh, apparently after the break we&#39;ll have interviews with the tributes from the main games. Possibly some from the runoff, as well? I&#39;m not really clear on what they&#39;re doing.<br><hr>
<br>Fire. Fire is good. Fire is clean. Fire will solve all your problems. Use fire.<br><br>This message has been brought to you by the Department of Geographical Aberrations. If you burn things, we&#39;ll burn them with you.<br><hr>
<br>So this was apparently a really good day to start the runoffs. I love the fact that they&#39;re insanely murderous - far more so than the main games!<br><br>You can do interviews with your runoff competitors if you want, but as Dafydd said, you don&#39;t have to.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Peregrin: &quot;I was aware that the hologram of Sa... Agent Acacia did not require bandaging. However, it was a good opportunity to put what knowledge I have of field medicine into practice with little risk. It was also a good opportunity for an interesting conversation.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I also rejoined Mr. Grey from the qualifiers, and met a librarian, who was at least as protective of his books as Suur Ala was.

Sure, she tried to surrender and all that but really: this is the Hunger Games. Who&#39;s gonna fall for that, eh? Yeah, so after that I teamed up with some other folks to try and hunt down the rest of the players. All was going fine until the lights went out and I was left to bump into practically every wall in the arena.

            <p>Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Five more deaths. Five more tributes out of the Games. Their deaths a tale of betrayal, bravery, cunning, and clumsiness. Welcome back… to the Hunger Games.<br><br>Last night, almost everyone found company. Sergio and Nikki stuck together; our reigning champion teamed up with Nurse Elms; Luxury set her sights on Hieronymus. Even the reclusive Canon Librarian found himself in a group, though he doesn&#39;t seem to have said much to them.<br><br>Of course, companionship wasn&#39;t always a good idea. The Librarian, the last of our four Time Lord tributes, put his trust in Whitney - but she killed him in his sleep.<br><br><i>At least Apollo and Mia can say they were honestly caught out. Peregrin snuck in while they were both sleeping, and took them down.</i><br><br>Michael, on the other hand, learned the folly of overconfidence. He received another wretched hatchet during the night - very similar to the one Falchion got this morning - in fact, how many hatchets are we up to now?<br><br><i>Oh, no...</i><br><br>We&#39;ve seen eleven hatchets sent into the arena. Two of our tributes have used them for murder. Both Nikki and Michael have been sent two - probably a factor in Michael&#39;s confidence. Because he <i>was</i> overconfident. Did he really think two hatchets would let him force a hydra to do what she was told? Because it didn&#39;t. She took his head off with a single bite.<br><br>Other encounters during the day were less lethal. Will portalled up to Lola, but our reigning champion chose to join forces rather than kill him. Ajax and Nikki defended the camp in the Miss Cam Courtyard - the one that Sergio and Nikki have been coming back to repeatedly over the last few days.<br><br><i>Perhaps that&#39;s where Sergio was trying to go with his portal. Unfortunately, he missed, and the lava pits are not forgiving.</i><br><br>Gremlin, meanwhile, continued her weapon-oriented game, tricking the Canon Librarian into giving up all the instruments of destruction he&#39;d gathered.<br><br><i>Just goes to show that hiding yourself in impenetrable darkness doesn&#39;t protect you from being a gullible idiot.</i><br><br>So we come to the end of our report. The arena feels almost empty now, with so few tributes remaining. We&#39;ll be back after the break to interview the survivors, and after that… well, next time we may have something quite special for you.<br><hr>
<br><i>Out of paper? Bed broken? Need an office chair? Contact the Quartermaster to requisition the essentials of life in HQ. Just call the Morning Glory, and ask for - nay, demand! - your rights. She won&#39;t be able to refuse.<br><br>Oh, but, uh, don&#39;t tell her we sent you, please.</i><br><hr>

            <p>Sergio:<br><br>&quot;I coul&#39;ve given that lava bath a miss.

I just had to use the &quot;load last location&quot; function, which clearly <i>wasn&#39;t</i> a lava pit so I&#39;m going to have a talk about this with you producers later.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What do you mean, &#39;assuming you find us?&#39; I&#39;m having Corolla track the signal of this drone right now.

He&#39;s my <i>boyfriend</i>, what were you expecting?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m surprised Sergio got out due to a mispalced portal - that&#39;s not a mistake he would do - in fact, I was so upset about it that when two people tried to invade our camp I just threw my hatchets at them without thinking.&quot;<br><br>&quot;By the way, I&#39;m currently sharing camp with that Ajax dude, the one who spared Sergio in the qualifiers. I hope he doesn&#39;t try to seduce me too - because Sergio would be likely going to ask for a rematch.&quot;<br><br><br>[hS, feel free to play Sergio&#39;s quest for an explanation however you want.

            <p>Well, last night was a nice change. Yesterday, I was so upset, I didn’t even notice that Androia is out. Unfortunately I can’t brag that she needs the exercise more than I do, but if she wants to operate the Arr Ah on the next mission, she’ll have to beg for it, a lot. Yes, I’m evasive. I’ll only say that Lux is an interesting person in many aspects. Aaaand I found the Courtyard at last. It was sooo good to get out of the grey corridors and see some green. And Nurse Elms may be an interesting person, too. But before we could talk much, Rollerblade Guy and Anime Girl started to throw hatchets at us. Looks like they are a team now and set up a camp there, and they may have thought that we wanted to rob them of their provisions. So we ran away in opposite directions, and I haven’t seen Elms again since then. <br><br>HG</p>

            <p><i>From a hidden holo-deck, high in the mountains of New Caledonia… the PPC&#39;s ONLY TV station broadcast live to your console… this… is NTV.</i><br><br>Day three of the PPC HQ Hunger Games. The cannons have fired, nine times more. And not a single district remains.<br><br><i>That is a bald-faced lie. We haven&#39;t had a single district eliminated yet.</i><br><br>Fine: not a single district remains untouched. All are marred by death - and by the vile scourge that is hatchets.<br><br>It began with a death: Agent Library&#39;s, at the hands of Gremlin. No, not at Gremlin&#39;s hands - at the blade of her hatchet, carved and graven with the words of war. And from that act of murder, new hatchets came forth: one to Nikki in the depths of the night, one for Apollo in the bright morning, and four, four twice-damned hatchets in the heat of the day: to Michael, to Mia, to Whitney, and to Nikki once more.<br><br><i>Yeah, he&#39;s kind of cracking up, I&#39;m afraid. Soon he&#39;s going to be scribbling on the walls like Derik, or wandering at random like Will or Peregrin today.</i><br><br>I know now how the Canon Librarian feels; for he has sought his Library all through the games, only to see it found by Ajax in his place. &#39;Tis no wonder he wrought such violence upon Androia and Charlotte when they dared approach him.<br><br><i>Seriously, they portalled into his and Mia&#39;s camp and got shot; you&#39;d think he hunted them down with a spear the way you&#39;re talking. You&#39;re being as ridiculously dramatic as Steve, Elms, Levy, and Marina in those plays they were putting on overnight. I mean, if you had to pick a worthy audience in the arena, Champion Lola or Sergio the Avenger would be it, but…</i><br><br>Drama, you call it. But was not Steve&#39;s performance a premonition of his own demise at the Librarian&#39;s unfaithful hands?<br><br><i>Not really. Unless you mean &#39;dying on stage&#39;. Look, do you mind if I take over?</i><br><br>I most certainly do mind.<br><br><i>Then pull yourself together.</i><br><br>… fine. Ahem. Speaking of &#39;together&#39;, last night was a night for romance: Derik and Will held hands all through the night, and we here at NTV had quite a few bets on which seduction attempt would succeed: Hieronymus and Michael, or Kyaris and the Librarian.<br><br><i>I was backing the hydra. Never bet against a hydra.</i><br><br>But this is the Hunger Games, despite how much Hop ate during the night, and the Hunger Games aren&#39;t about love - they&#39;re about death. And death we had aplenty-<br><br><i>Oh, don&#39;t start that again.</i><br><br>Three died during the night: Library, Androia, Charlotte. But after day began, the death toll just rose and rose. Gremlin made good use of her explosive stash, taking out Mirrad and Zeb and bringing her tally up to three. Levy, having concealed her injuries from all, finally bled out.<br><br><i>Not that we know for sure she&#39;d hidden anything. It was too well hidden.</i><br><br>VJ sought solace in the Fountain of Bleepka, but it drew her down into its watery depths. And as previously mentioned, the Librarian feigned friendship with Steve and Nickul, only to cut them down where they stood.<br><br>So 22 of our tributes remain, locked in their arena of woe. What sorrow is theirs? What pains will they suffer, ere-<br><br><i>That&#39;s quite enough of that. I think the advertisers have a little suggestion for you. We&#39;ll be back after the break with interviews.</i><br><br><hr>
<br><i>Art thou afflicted with the speech patterns of Shakespeare? Dost thou find thyself unable to come to a point, though all the leagues of badfic stand arrayed against thee, and thine the only plan? Canst thou declare thy affections only in verse, and thy sorrows in wretched pentameter?<br><br>Behold, for thee is laid on a cure the like of which has ne&#39;er before been seen! Hie thee unto the General Store, and bid the merchant bring to you YO WATEVS DUDE. Partake with thy meal, and verily, thou shalt find the trappings of former days washed away, and thy speech become plain as… as… as… well, I can&#39;t say what as! I&#39;ve just taken it myself, you see. Laters!</i><br><br><hr>

Currently, Gremlin, the Librarian, and Gall (deceased) are tied for most kills, on three each. We&#39;ll see how that changes as the games go on.<br><br>And keep up the interviews!

            <p><i>From a hidden holo-deck, high in the mountains of New Caledonia… the PPC&#39;s ONLY TV station broadcast live to your console… this… is NTV.</i><br><br>Welcome back. When last we met, everyone and their Pokemon had just finished swearing bloody vengeance against Agent Tomash for killing Keiko. Well, Tomash is dead, and you will be glad to know that his killer was…<br><br><i>If you&#39;re waiting for a drumroll, you&#39;re not getting one.</i><br><br>… Sergio. Yes, the grieving father has slain his daughter&#39;s murderer. Justice has been wrought in blood.<br><br><i>Seriously, isn&#39;t this a bit dramatic?</i><br><br>You&#39;re the one who&#39;s been complaining about me being too light-hearted. Anyway: at the same time, our very own holographic Acacia took on the AI Amris, and left it broken on the floor.<br><br><i>A promising start to the night.</i><br><br>It would have been, but it was more like the end. Only one other tribute died in the night, actually - Makes-Things, who got set on fire by Agent Ajax. Everyone else was either resting or talking.<br><br><i>Is <b>that</b> how we&#39;re describing Nurse Elms&#39; advances towards Peregrin?</i><br><br>Maybe. But it&#39;s certainly the best way to describe the Pythonesque quote sessions going on all across HQ, and the D&amp;D game that broke out in the Really Very Tiny Auditorium.<br><br>Not everyone had a good time of things overnight, quite apart from the dying. Both Gremlin and Library were too tired to do anything, and given that Gremlin is recovering from that broken rib, I don&#39;t think that bodes well.<br><br><i>Maybe she could talk to Zeb or Marina; they seem to be experts at tending to injuries.</i><br><br>Our reigning champion, meanwhile, seemed to be having trouble sleeping - not a problem that afflicted Decima and the Librarian, who slept right through Charlotte making off with their supplies!<br><br><i>I bet Falchion and VJ would&#39;ve been glad for a share in those.</i><br><br>They&#39;ll just have to hope a sponsor sends them something.<br><br><i>Yes, speaking of which…?</i><br><br>I&#39;ve checked, and there&#39;s nothing in the rulebook that says you can&#39;t send a plasma cannon into the arena. Though there… probably should be.<br><br><i>What&#39;s the point? We haven&#39;t been able to restrict the flow of hatchets.</i><br><br>Yes, viewers, as day dawn- er, started, we discovered the hatchet problem is worse than we&#39;d thought: Agent Levy had gotten hold of one, and used it to kill Agent Gabrielle. The Hatchet Sponsor sent another one in to Hieronymus, but we were able to get it away in time. I&#39;m still not entirely convinced Androia&#39;s and Kyaris&#39; explosion stash is legit, either.<br><br>Luckily, the day wasn&#39;t as quiet as the night - certainly not for Marina and Library, who couldn&#39;t get Whitney and Peregrin to shut up! But we also saw a number of fights: holo-Acacia and Nikki drove off Charlotte and Apollo in the very same camp where Tomash and Amris died during the night.<br><br><i>Was Nikki there overnight? I didn&#39;t see.</i><br><br>Difficult to determine; we&#39;ll have to ask in the interviews. We also saw Zeb take down William, but leave him alive.<br><br><i>Actually, escaping death was quite a theme today. Sergio managed not to kill himself when he tried to rewire the elevators. Mia ran into Ajax and Falchion, who didn&#39;t attack her; Champion Lola dropped right on top of Mirrad, but they ended up allied!</i><br><br>That was certainly a luckier portal than Decima&#39;s, which threw her into that lava pit! A nasty way to go. And, speaking of nasty ways to go…<br><br><i>Oh, yes.</i><br><br>If &#39;escaping death&#39; was one of today&#39;s themes, &#39;depression&#39; was the other. We saw Nickul banging his head on the wall; the Librarian wandering in search of company; Michael&#39;s soul-searching. And, of course, James and Gall.<br><br><i>I still don&#39;t get that. Why would you make a suicide pact, and then <b>honour</b> it? Do… do they not know what the game is about?</i><br><br>I don&#39;t know, Notte. We&#39;ll have to ask them in the interview.<br><br><i>Which is coming right up?</i><br><br>Which is coming right up, after the break.<br><br><hr>
<br><br><i>GORE! BLOOD! GUTS! And worst of all: LAUNDRY!<br><br>We&#39;ve all been there: heading out for a relaxing evening at Rudi&#39;s, you discover that your favourite shirt is spattered with the urple remains of the Suvian you just killed. Water won&#39;t rinse it off - rubber gloves dissolve when you touch it - bleach just makes things worse.<br><br>Enter BL+ELLO, the only washing powder guaranteed to separate Suvian colours into their component parts! Watch those wilver splotches fall away in white and silver streams! Bled simply drains away once it&#39;s blue and red again! And as for glose, the scent of those roses is almost as beautiful as the gold!<br><br>Warning: does not work on dark black, meen, antiblue, or other non-combinatorial Suvian colours.</i><br><br><hr>

Get on with it!<br><br><b>Gall:</b> <i>Motherf****r!</i> This was <i>not</i> supposed to happen! That guy totally bought the waterworks, I palmed the poison I already had into his cup when I poured the Bleepka, and that should&#39;ve been that! I swear I only turned around for one second to put the bottle down. How could this happen?!<br><br><b>Mirrad:</b> I am sad to learn that Decima is out of the games so soon. I suspect now that she only wanted me to watch her back while she took a shower and did not intend to make a lasting alliance at all, since she left soon after she had finished. However, I had a pleasant evening with Hop and Nickul, and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to work with last year&#39;s champion. It is quite fortunate that she landed on top of me.<br><br><b>Elms:</b> I am so lost. I should never have left Peregrin, even if he was boring. Hey, camera-bot, I don&#39;t suppose I could follow you to... I dunno, anywhere that isn&#39;t an empty corridor?<br><br>(( I don&#39;t know when Derik found Monty Python, but no one has ever had a better excuse to quote them excessively. ^_^<br><br>(( I swear, Mirrad looks likely to ally his way to the top at this rate.

            <p><b>Gremlin</b>: Well, I didn&#39;t find Medical. Only a room filled with camo gear in which I passed out. I took some of it when I woke up this morning because I thought I might be able to use it in the Courtyard. But hey, guess what? Couldn&#39;t find that either, so now I look like an idiot.

Might kind act, right there.<br><br>Now then, the suicide pact…<br><br><i>He sighs.</i><br><br>It wasn&#39;t really supposed to go down like that. Little redhead comes up to me, bawling, saying that she was tired of this whole thing and wanted to go out but was too scared to do it on her own. She was not the most talented actress I ever met, so I didn&#39;t buy it. I was about to get down to brass tacks when it dawned on me: maybe I could play this out. So I make the agreement.<br><br>We get a bottle of Bleepka and some poison. She suggests having a non-deadly toast before offing ourselves. I agree, but when she turns away, I dose her drink. We toast, and bottoms up.<br><br>Turned out she managed to dose my glass too. Never saw her do it. I tip my hat to you, Gall. That was some damn fine sneak work.<br><br><b>Holo-Acacia</b>: I have become very efficient at defensive action, even without my hatchet!<br><br>((OOC: I exchanged some messages with Nesh about why James and Gall might enter a suicide pact, and we decided on &quot;they tried to trick each other with poison and failed.&quot; Also, quick question for hS: why would you leave that option in?!))</p>

            <p>This isn&#39;t a game about seeing your agents do things they&#39;d normally do - it&#39;s a game of seeing the RNG make them do completely ludicrous stuff, and then seeing how you can rationalise it. In the Day 3 report, Kyaris tries to seduce <i>the Librarian</i>. Can you see that happening, in any reasonable world? Me either.

            <p>(Since the event feed seems to imply that Sergio and Nikki were sticking together...)<br><br>Sergio: &quot;So, yeah. I have no idea if Tomash attacked our camp to try to take us down before we could get him, or he found us here only by chance... but that&#39;s what happens when you touch our daughter.&quot;<br>Nikki: &quot;Well, you actually did all by yourself. By the time I had set up my Device, you had already swiss-cheesed him.&quot;<br>Sergio: &quot;What were you expecting me to do, really? Anyways, the ball of bloodthirst is out too, which is a good thing. That guy gave me the creeps.&quot;<br>Nikki: &quot;Yeah. Tagging along with Holo-Acacia was a good thing, since she got him. I wonder who Acacia Byrd is - if the producers decided to put an hologram of her in, she must&#39;ve been someone famous.&quot;<br>Sergio: &quot;One thing is sure, her archery is top notch.&quot;<br>Nikki: &quot;Also, I&#39;d like to thank Corolla and Keiko for the water - yes, we know you&#39;re behind it. It was very appreciated. Especially after Sergio here nearly fried himself with that elevator.&quot;<br>Sergio: &quot;Well, I tried to knock it out of commission to give our opponents one less way into our camp, but I guess that would&#39;ve been a job better suited to our Corolla...&quot;</p>

            <p><i>From a hidden holo-deck, high in the mountains of New Caledonia… the PPC&#39;s ONLY TV station broadcast live to your console… this… is NTV.</i><br><br>The guns have sounded. Boom… boom… boom. Ten shots. Three of those fell during the Bloodbath - Alice, Selene, Ecks. The other seven… let&#39;s take a look.<br><br><i>Huh. That was almost dramatic.</i><br><br>So was this first day in the Arena (see what I did there?). If our tributes expected to breeze through the games just because they were on familiar territory, they were very much out of luck. Agent Gremlin looks to have broken a rib in that fall, and Ajax was forced to resort to acting to fend off an attack - always a terrifying thought.<br><br><i>Seriously, that&#39;s the part that terrified you? Not Tomash?</i><br><br>All right, yes: when Tomash tried to turn Keiko&#39;s life into a murderous logic puzzle, we were glued to our seats. And then when he killed her after she refused to take part - nasty. Almost as nasty as Gall throttling Kelly from behind.<br><br><i>I would say nastier.</i><br><br>Fine: almost as nasty as Whitney slicing Derik&#39;s leg off and then leaving him there?<br><br><i>No, because she used a lightsaber; it cauterised, so he&#39;ll be fine.</i><br><br>Except with only one leg.<br><br><i>Yes. So?</i><br><br>Hm. Well, at least he&#39;s doing better than Desdendelle, who took Peregrin&#39;s Killing Curse right in the face. Or Kaitlyn, who… well, honestly, we&#39;re not even sure what Gabrielle did to her, but she&#39;s definitely out of the games.<br><br>There were non-lethal fights, too: Luxury and James drove Levy and Steve away from their campsite without anyone dying, and our three hunter teams - VJ, Apollo, Makes-Things, and Charlotte on one hand, Hop, Amris, Sergio, and Kyaris on the other, and the magical team of Decima, William, and Nurse Mirrad on the third - didn&#39;t find anyone to kill.<br><br><i>How many hands do you have? Oh, who cares? Let&#39;s talk about Pokemon! Could there be a more natural team than Zeb and Falchion in this arena? I think the Notary and Rachel Calendar would agree that there can&#39;t!</i><br><br>Except they don&#39;t agree to anything. Because they&#39;re dead. Also, we have more than two Pokemon in there, you know.<br><br><i>Not as many as we did, not after Tacitus&#39;, ah, portal blunder.</i><br><br>And speaking of blunders: to whoever is sending in those hatchets. Seriously. This needs to stop. We banned them after Season 2. We&#39;ve taken hologram!Acacia&#39;s away from her; Champion Lola wouldn&#39;t let go of hers, which is irritating, but we can&#39;t really randomly kill the reigning champion.<br><br><i>I still say we can.</i><br><br>And when you&#39;re in charge, you can make that decision. But right now, this is my show, and I say we can&#39;t.<br><br><i>Spoilsport.</i><br><br>Hatchets are banned. We don&#39;t want to see any more in the arena. Thank you.<br><br>Join us after the break for interviews with all our surviving and outgoing tributes. And after that - we&#39;ll see you next de-<br><br><i>You weren&#39;t going to do that, either.</i><br><br>You are such a miseryguts.<br><hr>
<br><i>Consider the plight of the agent who falls in the line of duty. That&#39;s right - none. They&#39;re fine, because they&#39;ve already gone on to the great bleepka bar in the sky. But what about the ones they leave behind? Trapped in a locked Response Centre, ignored by the rest of the PPC, the poor minis wait patiently for their friends who will never return.<br><br>You can help. For as little as $2/AM$0.05/4 latinum strips per week, you can feed and house an abandoned mini, somewhere in HQ. They may not thank you, but we will.<br><br>And remember - mind your spelling.</i><br><hr>
<br>As always, the full transcript is on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Tz6_uDVaEW8J-YMEdxm2F7v8tD1T9q77UkCyPfo9bE/pub">the doc</a>. I was really hoping Kaitlyn would stay in a bit longer - oh well!<br><br>hS</p>

And you, the powers and all that too. Maaaaan. Guess I&#39;m just gonna have to watch how this plays out from my RC. Good luck, everyone still in it!<br><br><b>James</b>: I wasn&#39;t sure about making camp with Luxury. Not after all the stuff I&#39;ve heard about her, anyway. I don&#39;t mind me some personal company from time to time, don&#39;t get me wrong, but this hardly seems like the best occasion for it.<br><br>But then we got ambushed while setting up the tents. Turns out the lady&#39;s got some combat skill. I suppose it shouldn&#39;t be that much of a surprise, considering how long she&#39;s been an agent for. But still, &#39;tween the two of us, we sent those folks running!<br><br>I turned down Luxury&#39;s offer to celebrate. Like I said, hardly seems like the best occasion for it.<br><br><b>Gremlin</b>: Ow… ow… OW F*****G OW!

The Notary was a challenge, obviously, but who knew Rachel was weak to throwing a stone sword without STAB? What a turnaround! Anyway, Zeb and I really should pair up more often.

            <p>Sergio:<br><br>&quot;Why I kept going around with Amris, you say? Exactly because I don&#39;t like him. Better keep him where I can see him. And, Kyaris, of course I don&#39;t know very well how to use swords. I use <i>guns</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;So, yeah, that Peregrin dude got Des too, so he&#39;s on my target list. Just added Tomash on that one, too, I was starting to like that Keiko girl.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... Wait, what? You&#39;re saying that girl coming from the future is <i>my daughter</i>...? Tomash, I&#39;m <i>coming for you</i>.&quot;<br><br>Nikki:<br><br>&quot;I think I might&#39;ve seen that woman who got me out last time? I don&#39;t know, and sure I wasn&#39;t going for payback since there was this dude who looked like he was beign Sued, so I ran. Getting out on day one <i>again</i> would&#39;ve been just too embarassing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, Keiko got eliminated today. A shame, she looked such like a nice girl... Eeeeh? She&#39;s my daughter? Well... I guess day-one eliminations run in the family? Still, I&#39;m going to give that Tomash a beating when I see him. What he did is very nasty.&quot;<br><br>Keiko:<br><br>&quot;So... Should&#39;ve thought about that one better. Sure, I hate people ordering me around, especially if they&#39;re complete strangers, but I would&#39;ve have had to face the two he wanted me to kill anyways so I should&#39;ve just played along.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So, on my first PPC HQ Hunger Games I got out on day one and placed... forty-fifth? Heh, that&#39;s exactly what Mom did on her first one, too!&quot;<br><br>&quot;... You told her and Dad that I&#39;m their daughter? Why&#39;d you do that? Now they&#39;re both going to go on homicidial rage-&quot;<br><br>&quot;That was your very intention? I&#39;m... not sure it was a good idea, you know? Though I admit that I&#39;m going to appreciate if they avenge me.&quot;</p>

            <p><i>From a hidden holo-deck, high in the mountains of New Caledonia… the PPC&#39;s ONLY TV station broadcast live to your console… this… is NTV.</i><br><br>Hello! And welcome back to the PPC HQ Hunger Games, where enthusiasm… is catching!<br><br><i>You said you weren&#39;t going to do the silly misquotes any more.</i><br><br>I lied. As we speak, our tributes are flooding out across the holographic arena, seeking shelter, supplies, or perhaps subjects for their violent aspirations.<br><br><i>I thought you were going with &#39;targets&#39;.</i><br><br>Yes, but then I noticed the alliteration, and I just couldn&#39;t stop.<br><br><i>You should have.</i><br><br>We say &#39;the tributes&#39;... but not all of them. Three of the hopeful contestants never left the Cornucopia - or should I say, the Cafeteria!<br><br>Yes, you can see the surprise and shock in their faces when you watch them portal in to… the HQ cafeteria! Was that disorientation the reason so many of them ran away? Or was that always the plan - to flee from the expected massacre.<br><br>Those who stayed got their pick of the supplies we laid on. Our reigning champion, Lola McCandless, landed herself a nice flamethrower. Falchion grabbed a sword in his talons, though what a Sword Bird needs with one we&#39;re not really sure.<br><br><i>Nor do we know why Marina thought the most valuable find was a bottle of glitter - or, for that matter, why Ajax&#39;s rollerblades were such a great find that Michael and Keiko both went after him!</i><br><br>At least Levy got good use out of her lethal-looking banana, driving off Peregrin&#39;s intended attack. Elsewhere, Whitney and Charlotte&#39;s fight over that gorgeous energy bow somehow didn&#39;t end in a fatality!<br><br><i>Though there were plenty of those to go around. The Librarian&#39;s torching of Selene - Kaitlyn and Androia&#39;s masterful teamup on Ecks - and of course <b>whatever</b> happened to Alice the horse.</i><br><br>We&#39;ve gone over the footage, and we can&#39;t figure out who brought her down, though we do know that Hieronymus was the one to finish her off. We&#39;re sending in drones to interview the tributes now - maybe one of them can shed some light.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t all violence, of course - there was also forward planning to be done. The teamups of Rachel, Decima, Will, and Steve, and Tomash, Luxury, Nickul, and Derik, look a little tenuous, but they got them out of the Cafeteria, and that&#39;s what counts!<br><br><i>Unless your name happens to be Tacitus, Amris, or Sergio, in which case what counts is a nice conversation.</i><br><br>Yeah, that was weird. Okay! That&#39;s all we spotted on the tapes. Remember: all of this is holographic, however realistic the simulation of HQ may be. We&#39;ll be back after the break with brief interviews from the tributes-<br><br><i>Or those we can talk to without giving their positions away.</i><br><br>Until then, remember: this has been Nutmeg TV, and this… is the Hunger Games.<br><br><hr>
<br><br><i>You may think that borrowing books is somehow &#39;good&#39;. That a library exist to &#39;serve&#39; you. That I &#39;want&#39; you to come and visit me.<br><br>You&#39;re mistaken. But, unfortunately, the Flowers insist I let you read my books occasionally.<br><br>So when you really can&#39;t find any other way to get hold of one, I suppose you can come to the Canon Library. Just don&#39;t touch anything while you&#39;re here.</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br>Full transcript is available on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Tz6_uDVaEW8J-YMEdxm2F7v8tD1T9q77UkCyPfo9bE/pub">the doc</a>, down towards the bottom. We had three deaths, and our first Boarder elimination - sorry, Data Junkie. I did seriously consider rerunning to try and get you at least into Day 1, but given that I&#39;d also be saving my own agent by doing that, I figured I&#39;d stick with the first run.<br><br>Interviews from everyone are welcome - they&#39;ve been great fun to read so far! And if you&#39;ve not got them up for the first round, that&#39;s still open too!<br><br>This is fu-un...!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><s>(is the sound a meatroll makes)</s><br><br>Seriously, this idea has got me to thinking. What other fictional &#39;verse euphemisms can we think of? What are they like in other languages? For instance, in Tau&#39;sia a homebrew euphemism would be <i>ran&#39;monat&#39;sio</i>; the word ran means either &quot;heart&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot;, depending on context, and the rest comes from the compound word <i>co&#39;monat&#39;sio</i>, which means to act selfishly or to put one&#39;s own desires above the Greater Good (and my lexicon informs me that it implies licentiousness and decadence). Thus, ran&#39;monat&#39;sio means to act on the desires of one&#39;s heart... alone.<br><br>Alas, the Tau&#39;sia word for tissue paper presently eludes me. =]</p>

Dafydd, Constance, July, and Alleb all went out, along with both Ix and the Aviator. JulyFlame lost three of her four candidates, though luckily, no-one went out entirely. (And congrats to Neshomeh, whose two agents + two NPC suggestions all made it through!)<br><br>The teams are a bit scrambled, given that only Nesh has an intact quartet. I think the only person whose agents I ended up having to split was Skarm, who&#39;s ended up paired with Matt Cipher and Desdendelle. Sorry! I tried!<br><br>So far, we&#39;re not revealing the new arena. We are revealing, though, that we have <b>a hologram of Acacia Byrd</b> in the Games. So you have something to live up to!<br><br>If you&#39;d like your agents to give opening interviews - or losing ones, for the folks who&#39;re out already - go ahead and post them in a reply to this. (And please do - they make for great reading, and will help me get them in character for the narration!) I&#39;ll edit them into the document when I can. (Whether I can get them written for my own four + Kaitlyn&#39;s four + 5 NPCs is an... interesting question. I&#39;ll get back to you on that.)<br><br>Next broadcast will hopefully be tomorrow, showing the bloodbath and - if it&#39;s not <i>too</i> bloody - Day One as well.<br><br>See you then!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><b>Rachel</b>: I was super excited to get picked for the Games this time! I watched all of the footage of the last Games to get an idea of what was going on—plus, you know, to get psyched! It&#39;s always important to get positive before taking something like this on. <br><br>I got a bunch of useful gear from the Cornucopia and was feeling really good and then WHOA, I got attacked! And by the defending champion too! Not gonna lie, but I was kinda scared right then. I mean, she&#39;s a trained soldier and I&#39;m definitely not. But I escaped! I was dodging around trees and rocks, and even ran through a stream at one point! That was pretty awesome.<br><br>Then I started hallucinating! There were all these weird pinkish-green bugs with human faces flying at me, and some of them were dancing! I think it might have been the Charleston. And then—hey, where are you going? Is the interview over?<br><br><b>James</b>: That went all right, I suppose. Managed to pick up a bit of disinfectant from the Cornucopia before all the explosions went off. Then, I pretty just spent the rest of the match trying to be a might proactive. Hunting for other folks and that. Never found any one, but I did survive. Let&#39;s hope the real thing goes as smooth as this one did.<br><br><b>Gremlin</b>: I decided beforehand that, since this was just the qualifier, I wasn&#39;t gonna make too much trouble. Don&#39;t fight; just survive. That&#39;s why skipped the Cornucopia in favor of just hunting, and why I made that agreement with Kelly to alternate our sleeping cycles. Getting sent clean water was a nice bonus. Pretty sure I know who that was from, even though the sponsors are always &quot;unknown.&quot; <i>She winks at the camera.</i> Thanks, babe.<br><br><b>Laura</b>: God. D****t. Eliminated already! Ugh. Well, at least I went out in a pretty hardcore way. Getting stabbed multiple times by a psychic Flower armed with sais? Better than falling in a hole LIKE LAST TIME.</p>

            <p>Androia: Yes, we are in again. I still have to prove that I can survive more than one day. After all, I am supposed to be the fighter in this team, and the person who knows how to heal herself. And Hieronymus needs the exercise. He says that running in circles and lifting weights are senseless actions, so adding an adventurous aspect may help. The man just does not move enough. I watched that in our last mission. What? Yes, nearly being strangled by a weed was not a good start. Thank you, Richard, for breaking his stalk.<br><br>Hieronymus: Gah, fighting holographic squirrels and agents wielding holographic weapons is senseless, too. Where’s the adventure when there are no consequences? I only concurred to get out of our arr zee. I’m going to find a quiet place where Androia can’t talk my ear off, and just sit the games out. If it doesn’t work, I’ll be out and she’ll still be in, and that’s just as well. Why I didn’t try to sit out the Qualifier? Well, I guess no Agent can say &quot;no&quot; to Jay Thorntree. I’ve no idea what she wanted with the Librarian, though, and they abandoned me before I found out why she’d said she needed a shovel.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Tomash: &quot;At first, I wasn&#39;t too thrilled at getting dragged into this thing, but it wasn&#39;t as bad as I thought it&#39;d be. That was a pretty lucky grenade toss at the beginning. I was just trying to distract people so I could grab some food and run for it. Falling into the water while trying to fish wasn&#39;t fun,  but I get the feeling that will end up on a &#39;funniest moments&#39; compilation.&quot;<br><br>&quot;My plans for the main event are to join a group and hope I can last a few days before the inevitable betrayal. Maybe I&#39;ll get to know some new people.&quot;<br><br>Peregrin: &quot;There were a few moments during the night where I wasn&#39;t sure if joining these Games had been a good decision. I&#39;d like to think I did reasonably well overall, though. If nothing else, the second day&#39;s events will certainly serve as a clear example of why the initialization elements of packaged explosives should not be used as ropes while attached to the package. I must find more of that material after the event. It might be useful for assassinations at a distance if arranged carefully ...&quot;<br><br>Peregrin was lost in thought for a moment.<br><br>&quot;On, right, the Games. I&#39;d like to thank Mr. Gray, the, ah, Pilot, I think, and ..., er, everyone else for their help with gathering supplies, as well as my sponsor, whoever they were. My plans for the main event are to get a ranged weapon I know how to use and hide. I am also considering going away from the Cornucopia initially, since it seems to attract a large battle, and returning later. That would be less risky, but could be significantly less rewarding. It&#39;s an interesting tradeoff, you know. A good friend of mine worked on a more general version of that problem several years ago, but didn&#39;t make much progress...&quot;<br><br>Interviewer: &quot;Thank you for your time.&quot;</p>

            <p><b>Elms:</b> Okay, note to self, the Cornucopia is bad. Even if the knives are really shiny and <i>right there</i>, do not go for them. You could get caught in a fireball and die before the Games even start. That was way too close. Fortunately, Zeb was nice enough to help me out with the burns. I hope he did okay afterward, I like the little guy. Not that I won&#39;t kick his butt in the arena if I have to, but hey, nothing personal.<br><br>The gas was just mean. Seriously, though, if you can&#39;t tell a can-can line of hobgoblins in tutus is a drug hallucination, you haven&#39;t lived enough yet.<br><br><b>Mirrad:</b> In Minbari culture, the highest honor is to serve. I was pleased to share with the others in the beginning, and also to assist Makes-Things in testing the simulation as we&#39;d agreed. Of course, I never understood &quot;assisting&quot; to go so far as to mean throwing the qualifier. *smiles serenely*<br><br>I found the experience of the hallucinogen quite enlightening. I saw what appeared to be a road of silver light with lovely rainbow dancers beckoning me to follow. It was a river, and if I had gone with them I would have drowned, but it was beautiful. The mind is fascinating in its ability to attempt to make sense out of nonsense.<br><br>I look forward to honing my skills in the main event.<br><br><b>Derik:</b> Well, here I am again. After the last time I swore I&#39;d never do it again, but Gall wouldn&#39;t let up until I&#39;d agreed to join with her. *sigh* I admit her plan of laying low for the qualifiers went well. ... The scream was nothing. Just a dream.<br><br><b>Gall:</b> Oh yeah, I&#39;m back! Don&#39;t be fooled by what you saw here. I wasn&#39;t gonna waste my energy in a stupid qualifier, so me and Derik just stuck together and let everyone else fight it out. I even gave my partner those dumb supplies to help out what&#39;s-her-face. I didn&#39;t need them, and maybe it will make her underestimate us in the real arena. *grin* Watch out, people. Gall is coming for you!<br><br>(( I thought about having Derik&#39;s scream be a plot to lure in the unwary, but nobody was out hunting or anything. Oh well. Nightmare it is! ))<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Apollo: &quot;First of all to clarify, I didn&#39;t really know Gerry had killed Rayner when I killed her, so no, no real revenge was in play there, in fact I hadn&#39;t meant to kill her at all, the branch I was using as a weapon was a tad heavier than I thought it was, that&#39;s all. Still glad to have got through the qualifiers and glad to see Kelly on my team too.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Any plans? No, not really. Ideally I&#39;d grab a bow and try and camp a spot I can defend, but after those roving squirrels from last season I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a good idea.&quot;<br><br>Kelly: &quot;Woo, I got through, and I even got a ranged weapon, not that I needed it, by I got one. I was kinda surprised to actually ally up with different people, and it&#39;d be nice to ally up with them again in the real thing, although it&#39;d also be nice to see Apollo as well, we didn&#39;t see each other besides at the start &#39;cos we ran different ways completely.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Plans? Not really, hope to get a ranged weapon, one of the bonuses to being a daughter of Apollo you see, hope I don&#39;t have to heal anyone and if I&#39;m really desperate I can always try and curse them to speak only in rhyming couplets, it doesn&#39;t have much use killing Sue&#39;s but I remember that one time our cabin used it on the Ares cabin...&quot;</p>

            <p>Would you like Lola or, uh, Peep to take precedence? I currently have 49 names, so I need to figure out a system for trimming them down.

            <p>... I can actually pare <i>up</i>. If we can get another 21 tributes, I can do a pair of 36-player elimination rounds, knocking out 12 players in each to get a final 48.
