            <p>I&#39;ve known for the past month what I was going to post today. I&#39;m going to be gone from tomorrow morning (the kids are off school, so we&#39;re heading Up North for a week&#39;s holiday), so I had to put aside any complex plans for April Fools&#39; (I still want to convert the Wiki into its Jaycaciaverse counterpart, for instance) and come up with something self-contained, like I did <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvcmbvGCc0V5zOhA1xNw5ZYmgMYjo9RwfNlRcSS54v8/pub">last year</a>.<br><br>I&#39;m still going to do that, actually:<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NjTomPKRvmfTkl3MI_T22_l1FOk5y4sBN83AktVLDWY/pub">Ardolindi: 1st April Episode</a><br><br>And that would be that. Except that last night, I found something.<br><br>I was digging through my old files, the ones which have been transferred from computer to computer over the years. Down in the depths of Documents &gt; Files &gt; My Documents &gt; Received Files &gt; Received Files (or something equally convoluted, <a href="http://xkcd.com/1360/">there&#39;s an xkcd for this</a>), I ran into this:<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GADPDKL3oDLnmbj8_98DHzawMjIR2oQCee6lBPYGmFs/edit?usp=sharing">&#39;Love Your Enemies&#39;</a><br><br>(<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GADPDKL3oDLnmbj8_98DHzawMjIR2oQCee6lBPYGmFs/pub">&#39;Published&#39; version, just for July</a>)<br><br>I do not remember receiving this file, but I know where it must have come from: just after the first Jaycacia Thornbyrd story came out, Jay contacted me over MSN. We chatted a few times (I was mostly very wide-eyed and intimidated), and I guess she must have sent this thing over. The file author is what I think is her real name, so I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s real.<br><br>I knew I had to share it with the Board right away - particularly since I&#39;m going to be gone for a week. I just wish I&#39;d found it on literally any other day. :-/<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ve left it open for comments if people want to do that. And I would appreciate comments on <i>my</i> story, as well...<br><br>hS will maybe be able to post a story without adding something more interesting to the post someday...</p>

            <p>I&#39;m gonna pretend you actually made the request. {= )<br><br>This isn&#39;t the sort of thing I&#39;d take on just because, but lately I have been seriously considering starting up a freelance editing business, and I would take it on that basis. I know jack-diddly about electric train pantographs, but if you&#39;re just looking for SPaG, I can do that, and I&#39;m willing to discuss a rate that would work for both of us.

            <p>...I can say with confidence that Calm Mind Clefable is ridiculous if played well. Especially with Soft-Boiled. It was probably my mistake to use Whirlwind, because had I taken my chances with Klefki, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have taken that double Flamethrower and gotten KO&#39;d almost as soon as the match began. Sheesh.<br><br>I&#39;ve gotta hand it to Pit, though... Thunder Wave and Roost are an amazing combo, and I&#39;m surprised he took out four of the enemy &#39;mons before going down - and especially that he flattened Gardevoir with a single hit before she could even Mega-evolve! I&#39;m starting to think that had Toxic not been brought into play, it&#39;s possible, though not quite likely, that he could&#39;ve taken out the rest of the team by himself...</p>

Since we have not heard from them, I think it&#39;s safe to assume they won&#39;t be showing up anytime soon and I&#39;ve gone ahead and treated their absence as a double elimination because it would be a waste of everyone&#39;s time to drag it out unnecessarily. <b>Due to the elimination, Huinesoron will be fighting foofooman3 next.</b><br><br>As for actual eliminations, after a rousing battle, <b>I&#39;ve</b> become the first person to be knocked out of the tournament, courtesy of <b>TheShyIon&#39;s</b> haxxor Dragonite. :P I&#39;m honestly not sure at this point who to declare is the winner(?) of the Pewter Trophy because of the disqualification.<br><br><b>SeaTurtle&#39;s</b> Ground team is looking rather threatening, having taken down last year&#39;s <b>Champion, foofooman3,</b> with surprising ease! Will <b>Hardric</b> be able to knock him into the Loser&#39;s Bracket?<br><br>Thanks for tuning in, trainers!<br></p>

            <p>It works fairly similar to my own. And in fact, now that eatpraylove and DCCCV are in the losers bracket it&#39;s the team I&#39;m most scared of facing. <br><br>I think one of the things with MonoGround is that it&#39;s easy to use, but it can be quite hard to master, and you&#39;ve certainly got the know-how to go all the way with yours.  </p>

            <p>I your diggersby was always going to be the problem since I had nothing that could consistently outspeed it, and my team isn&#39;t very tanky. Also my team has one special attacker so your hippodawn demolished me because I was too stupid to send it in earlier. The thing with my porygon is it&#39;s super powerful, but fragile. I normally send it in with a substitute and x3 speed from my ninjask, but that was ruined by the monotype. That way it outspeeds everything and has a free nasty plot while my opponent kills the substitute. </p>

            <p>Hi all! <br><br>Remember how about two weeks ago <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=293061;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25"> I said I&#39;d be gone for a week</a>? Well, the transition back to the real world was. . . harder than I expected (waking up at 4:30 every morning takes a toll). But I&#39;m back now. <br><br>It was an interesting week. I discussed Shakespeare with a college student, helped restore a creek, tried to describe my history teacher to a priest, discussed the nature of the universe,and made an enemy out of someone I will have to go to school with for the next two years. Also, I sat in a dark room staring at a white wall for about four hours every day. I think I&#39;m mostly recovered. <br><br>I&#39;m going to go read what I&#39;ve missed now. Please ask me questions/just talk to me. I&#39;ve missed you all.<br><br>~Key</p>

            <p>The creek was gorgeous. It had been straightened out by miners in the 19th century, so it was full of sediment and a terrible habitat for fish to live in. The farm was thinking of restoring it for a while, but the clincher was when they found salmon spawning in it-- somehow. So they rerouted the river to its original course based on old maps drawn before it was rerouted the first time, and they piled up logs into specific shapes that provided the most protection for salmon, and they replanted native plants along the banks, and it was beautiful. <br><br>All I did was pull up weeds. :P Mostly hemlock and thistles. It was fun, though. I got to use a giant digging fork and a hori-hori, which I believe is Japanese for &quot;big knife that&#39;s part saw for ripping up plants by their roots.&quot; I don&#39;t get to handle large slightly-dangerous things often and went on a mild power trip. </p>

            <p>Once you&#39;ve worn a pillow, yelled at your best friend, and dumped fruit juice on yourself, all in front of fifty or so people, and been praised as showing depth of thought for it, you can find dignity in anything.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure how one goes on a power trip while weeding either, but I did it.

Collecting her Gold Medal in February, Dame Zaha said she was proud to have been the first woman to win in her own right.<br><br>&quot;We now see more established female architects all the time,&quot; she said. &quot;That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s easy. Sometimes the challenges are immense. There has been tremendous change over recent years and we will continue this progress.&quot;<br><br>Dame Zaha&#39;s other creations include the Serpentine Sackler Gallery in London, the Riverside Museum at Glasgow&#39;s Museum of Transport, and Guangzhou Opera House in China. She twice won the Riba Stirling Prize, the UK&#39;s most prestigious architecture award. In 2010 she won for the Maxxi Museum in Rome, winning again in 2011 for the Evelyn Grace Academy in Brixton.<br><br>Born in Baghad, she studied maths at the American University of Beirut - where she later designed a building on campus which was completed in 2014 - before embarking on her career at the Architectural Association in London.<br><br>In 1979 she set up her own company - Zaha Hadid Architects. Her first major commission to be constructed was the Vitra Fire Station in Weil am Rhein in Germany.<br>The striking London Acquatics Centre in Stratford, which resembles a wave, features two 50-metre pools and a diving pool. After being used for the Olympics and Paralympics it was opened to the public in 2014.<br><br>&quot;I love the London Aquatics Centre because it&#39;s near where I live,&quot; Dame Zaha said at the time.<br><br>London Mayor Boris Johnson wrote on Twitter: &quot;So sad to hear of death of Zaha Hadid, she was an inspiration and her legacy lives on in wonderful buildings in Stratford and around the world.&quot;<br><br>She designed one of the stadiums that will take centre stage at the Qatar World Cup in 2022. Last year, however, the Japanese government scrapped plans to build the futuristic-looking stadium she designed for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, opting instead for a scaled-down, less costly design.<br><br>Riba president Jane Duncan said: &quot;This is absolutely terrible news. Dame Zaha Hadid was an inspirational woman, and the kind of architect one can only dream of being. Visionary and highly experimental, her legacy despite her young age, is formidable. She leaves behind a body of work from buildings to furniture, footwear and cars, that delight and astound people all around the world. The world of architecture has lost a star today.&quot;</i></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve seen enough to know that you are a regular participant in the PPC community. You get along well with folks and you add positively to the PPC as a whole. Good on you there. I do not remember your previous Permission attempt, so I can&#39;t make any comparisons between then and now.<br><br>My following judgements may seem blunt, even harsh. It is not my intention to cause offense.<br><br><b>CHARACTERS</b><br> Regarding Matthew, it&#39;s nice to see such an in-depth backstory. There&#39;s a lot to build on from what you have created, which is always a plus. That said, there are some things that give me pause. I feel like there&#39;s a disconnect between being &quot;the kind of person Mr. Rogers knows you can be&quot; and still having jokes that can seem mean-spirited. Surely the Mr. Rogers-esque thing to do would be to not make such jokes in the first place. I also have some qualms about his having ADHD, especially the way you describe it. It seems less like an actual portrayal of ADHD and more like an excuse for Matthew to occasionally engage in &quot;lol so random&quot; hijinks.<br><br>There&#39;s also the matter of his expertise. Giving Matthew a red belt in taekwondo alone would have been fine. But to have him be skilled enough to mix this typically unarmed martial art with both a sword and a gun? That (all at age 19) plus his higher-than-average IQ sets off some alarm bells in my mind.<br><br>Ajax, however, is where I really get concerned. The fact that his preferred tactic is so confrontational makes me think that you want to write big fight scenes between your agents and the Sues. I&#39;ve said this so many times before, and I will continue saying it forever: PPC agents should not be fighting Sues and Stus face to face. Ever. Not if they want long productive lives. If your agents can face off mano y mano against reality-warping creatures and come away victorious, then what makes them any different from said creatures?<br><br>Maybe I&#39;ve assumed wrong. I would love for that to be the case. But everything I&#39;ve seen puts doubt in my mind.<br><br><b>PROMPT ONE — RANDOM</b><br>This is extremely hard to read. Not for any technical reason, but because it uses such canon-specific language. I appreciate that you tried to explain what a Dragon Shot was for that reason. However, using a phrase like &quot;Budou Lockseed with the Gaim system&quot; didn&#39;t really explain much of anything.<br><br>Because the PPC is such a mixed bag of fandoms, you can&#39;t assume that people here are going to necessarily know what you&#39;re talking about when you reference something. You need to balance specific references with explanations that make sense in character. Either that, or you need to describe canon-specific things in such a way that both fans and non-fans alike will understand them. For example, a <i>Mass Effect</i> omni-tool might be described instead as an orange holograph appearing over a person&#39;s arm like a gauntlet, or something.<br><br><b>PROMPT TWO — CONTROL</b><br>This story is easier to read, but ultimately comes off as being a bit bland. I don&#39;t get much of a feel for your characters beyond Ajax being grumpy and Matthew being a bit of a goof. There&#39;s very little that makes them stand out.<br><br>There are also some SPaG errors in this story, including: <br>— &quot;High School,&quot; &quot;Mini-Fridge,&quot; and &quot;Flag&quot; do not need to be capitalized.<br>— The third paragraph on the first page is awkwardly structured due in large part to misused commas.<br>— There are several paragraphs which mingle the actions of the two agents, making it difficult to determine who is doing what. For example, the eighth paragraph on the second page does not elaborate who is speaking. <br><br><b>PROPOSED FIC</b><br>Yeah, that definitely fits. I don&#39;t know anything about <i>Percy Jackson</i>, but I can see plenty of problems even without that knowledge.<br><br>All in all, I&#39;m going to have to say that your Permission request is <b>denied</b>. Your characters concern me, and both of your writing examples had rather glaring issues. I would recommend going back to the drawing board and breaking down your agents. Think less about power levels and more about what makes them tick.<br><br>If you have any questions, feel free to let me know.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p><b>In response to characters</b><br>Matthew is a representation of myself. The Mr. Rogers thing... yeah that&#39;s probably something I don&#39;t want there. The ADHD stuff comes from my own personal perception of ADHD, which, upon the days I don&#39;t take medicine for it, does not equal a good time.<br><br>Again, with the representation comes parts of my own skill set. The IQ and Martial Arts stuff are accurate to myself (as surprising as the IQ part may , but I will probably take out the stuff about using his Tae Kwon Do in tandem with guns and swords. Have him throw away the weapon if need be?<br><br>With Ajax: I would be lying if I said the big fight scenes were not going to be a thing in my stories. It won&#39;t be common but it will definitely exist.<br><br><b>In response to the Random Prompt</b><br>Hey eatpraylove I guess I should&#39;ve accepted your suggestion there. Sorry.<br><br><b>In response to the Control Prompt</b><br>Yeah I&#39;m gonna half to agree with you there. The original one over played Matthew&#39;s ADHD, which I believe is part of the reason that one got rejected.<br></p>

            <p>I feel like I read something a while back postulating that there were two more alternate PPCs yet to be discovered (because the superstructure was probably dodecahedral rather than icosahedral. . . something to do with Plato. . .); maybe this is one of them. <br><br>The next question would be, what is its nature? We&#39;ve got a steampunk AU, an evil AU, and a shippy AU; what&#39;s this AU? Maybe everything&#39;s the same, but all the names, home continua, and other details are switched around (and Character Replacements are regularly recruited without changing their names)? Or maybe it&#39;s an AU where the past is volatile, and everyone switches between two or three alternate personal histories? You know how bookverse and movieverse are both considered canons, even if they flat-out contradict each other? This would be like that, except that every agent&#39;s life was a canon with three different bookverses, and they could switch between them (at will? semi-at will? completely randomly?). The Protectors of the Plot Continua. So <em>this</em> story would be about a council of agents who all have a version that&#39;s originally from Doctor Who as well as one that&#39;s originally from Potterverse. <br><br>We could also use it to play with the idea of de-aging agents, as discussed <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=294122;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>. Some agents could have alternate histories where they were born in different years, resulting in their having, say, an adult form, an adolescent form, and a very young form. Does this make sense? It&#39;s based off of a world my sister and I made up back when we were in elementary school. It probably says something about me that I still think it&#39;s cool.<br><br>Hybrid universes sounds cool and fun to work out, though. How would that work?</p>

            <p>So. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uyY7ugbeCepIb_VirsCPh-OeWV8kNukM1YxxWilDLwg/edit#">This</a> is <s>my</s> the DAMP&#39;s exhaust<s>ing</s>ive analysis of the current state of Multiverse Theory. It&#39;s where the Rose/icosahedron structure comes in. There have never been 20 known multiverses, though you&#39;re right, someone suggested it could be a dodecahedron and thus have only 12; that would mean we&#39;ve seen most of them.<br><br>I can see three ways for the HPified PPC to slot into the Rose:<br><br>1/ As part of the &#39;Splinterverse&#39; (see the end of the document). This is described as &#39;a multiverse where each canon or narrow genre has its own PPC analogue, and where the boundaries between canons in similar genres are weak&#39;. It already has <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>, <i>Doctor Who</i>, <i>Star Wars</i>, and magical girl anime &#39;PPC&#39;s; it could easily accomodate a <i>Harry Potter</i> version.<br>-The flaw with this is that it doesn&#39;t account for the fact that these agents are <i>canon characters</i>, not just HP-ified agents.<br><br>2/ Your suggestion: a volatile multiverse where everything is in flux. The boundaries between canons would be fluid and vague, meaning a) most fanfic would be crossovers, and b) &#39;crossovers&#39; wouldn&#39;t be a thing, because they&#39;re the norm. It would mean that the <i>original canons</i> were mostly crossovers - to use my preferred example, there would probably be a TV show called <i>Headmaster Who</i>, about the nameless, time-travelling headmaster of Hogwarts... sounds like fun! I bet figuring out what &#39;canon&#39; is would be murder, though.<br><br>3/ What I originally meant: a hybrid universe. This would involve some form of Abstract Canonical Entanglement, and possible interaction with the HITeG Manifold around HQ. Check out the Technical Note on page three of the document - the one about the Compromise Theory. Essentially, in some way, HQ (viewed as a separate universe) and the HP-verse would become ACEntangled, creating a &#39;verse with characteristics of both.<br><br>... basically this is a long-winded way of saying &#39;it&#39;s a crossover&#39;. ;)<br><br>I think one of the first two options is the most interesting, though. So... why not both?<br><br>4/ The Volatile Multiverse. You thought that taking a single look at a multiverse was enough to judge its character.<br><br>You thought wrong.<br><br>Once, the agents of the Pirates of the Plot Continuum sailed their purloined ships in pursuit of Suvians - then cased those ships in metal hulls, and took to the stars. The Fandom Protection Fleet plied the spaceways, then fell, nearly destroyed by internal feuding. The survivors took refuge underground, developing new abilities as the Multiversal Intervention Agency. They called themselves Time Lords - until the time came that they simply called themselves wizards, instead. Now, in the rambling complex some call HQ, others Hogwarts, they continue their crusade - until the next metacanonical flux...<br><br>This version loses the &#39;switch between them at will&#39; aspect, but absolutely allows them to repeatedly switch to different versions. (The summary above is purely hypothetical, of course - no doubt there were other versions in there too.) Hmm... I may have to get Norlossл to look into this. Given that we&#39;ve got a Lovecraftean Multiverse out there somewhere, I&#39;m getting a feeling there&#39;s distinct planes across the Rose...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Maybe this insanity is what&#39;s inside of the icosahedron. The reason that you can&#39;t determine what&#39;s canon is that it&#39;s a mashup of every canon from every multiverse, including ones the Prime multiverse has no contact with, and there&#39;s no way to tell what&#39;s from where.<br><br>Maybe that&#39;s where <i>ideas</i> come from: giant set of universes in which exist all the ideas of or universes that have ever been had. And multiverses suck out chunks of those ideas to make universes with. Different multiverses suck in different ways (not like that. . . well, like that too), which is why the Prime multiverse has Doctor Who, but the Mirror multiverse, sucking at the same or similar chunks of idea, came up with Master Who.<br><br>Or. . . or. . .maybe it&#39;s just another multiverse. That would make more sense.<br><br>I&#39;m not very familiar with Loveraft, so can&#39;t help you there.</p>

The more I think about it, the more interesting it seems, and I&#39;d like to figure out whether it&#39;s the sort of interesting I or the PPC could do something with, or if I should consign it to the pile of Mind-Altering Kumquat Compost (er, interesting and fun ideas which are too confusing to be used in any recognizable form).</p>

            <p>So, after three days of wandering through random PPC stories staring at stuff, it&#39;s occurred to me it may be a good idea to stop lurking like Gollum got a job as a private detective and present myself on this board whatsit. PPC is just kind of a lovely idea to me because <i>snarky multidimensional overworked exorcist/assassins aaaaa</i><br><br>Anyway. I&#39;m Pinkie (unless that&#39;s taken, it is an incredibly generic name and I&#39;d rather not step on anyone’s toes), and I write stuff and occasionally get the masochistic urge to read horrible fanfiction, which is how I got here. Mostly I&#39;m not sure if, beyond the original series as a starting point, there&#39;s any kind of recommended reading order for PPC? Personally, I find it a little confusing to read about a new pair of agents a fic (admittedly, I&#39;ve been picking them by fandom instead of pair, and the point where there was a Pokйmon with an exaggerated German accent it took me far too long to parse is the point where I gave up and wandered over here), so if there&#39;s some kind of order I missed somewhere that would be helpful? Thanks!</p>

            <p>*tosses confetti* Welcome aBoard, my new friend! Glad to see another newbie on here. <s>Also, I&#39;m not the shiniest anymore. Woah.</s> I present you with a large box of chocolates (Bleepolate may be found in the left corner, if needed). <br><br>As you read more and more missions done by one Agent team, you become more attached to them as characters. Also, some Agents will tackle multiple continuums, so a single pair isn&#39;t necessarily limited to one canon. I&#39;ll be happy to give recommendations if you tell me a few fandoms that you&#39;re in. <br><br>Anyway, nice to meet you, Pinkie! I&#39;ll see you around the Board.<br><br>-Vee</p>

            <p>Ooh, chocolate! It doesn&#39;t explode, right? Because I think I might be developing a complex about that. I think I listed my main fandoms in my second reply. Emphasis on main, since there&#39;s a bunch of things I&#39;ve read but don&#39;t expect to see any PPC fics about (then again, I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s one for Monster Musume of all things, so maybe I&#39;m wrong). Recommendations would be appreciated, thank you!</p>

            <p>Welcome aBoard! Have this Liminal Bag. It&#39;s not a Bag of Holding, it&#39;s normal-sized inside, but its content is shared by many other bags across the multiverse. Who knows, maybe you could get something nice out of it some day. Or you could make your very own (really tiny) interdimensional bar!

            <p>I&#39;m not sure if Black Hole coffee sounds like something potentially explosive or incredibly potent or both. As for my fandoms...wow, that&#39;s a broad question. Harry Potter (although I&#39;m not sure who <i>hasn&#39;t</i> read that), assorted video games (the Elder Scrolls games and Mass Effect in particular, and off the top of my head there was also things like Undertale, OFF, Portal, L4D and probably a bunch of others I&#39;m forgetting), Homestuck (which I&#39;m honestly surprised isn&#39;t more of a thing here, considering its practically a build-a-bear for bad OCs), Doctor Who and Supernatural (although I dropped off the latest seasons because of a sudden onslaught of actual work I&#39;m gleefully ignoring the existence of). I&#39;m probably forgetting something somewhere, but those are the things I&#39;ve actually written for (although mostly just for laughs). I&#39;m hesitant to list Tolkien’s works, because mostly I just watched the movies and read the Hobbit when I was very, very young and didn&#39;t understand half of what was going on. Also, wow, that&#39;s an irresponsible amount of parentheses, this is what happens when I don&#39;t drink coffee that&#39;s probably less likely to explode.</p>

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any specific order beyond The Original Series, but there is the Official Fanfiction University of Middle-earth (OFUM) to read, possibly.

            <p>I actually like cheese to an irrational degree, so thank you! I shall consume these shortly after I attain crackers and verify that blue cheese is supposed to look like that and I didn&#39;t just take too long on the cracker attainment process. Most of my experience with Tolkienverse comes from the movies and reading the Hobbit when I was young, which mostly just resulted in my attempting to dig a Smial in my backyard. Personally, I think it went well. I&#39;ll go look at OFUM in any case, thanks!</p>

            <p>So, in <i>The Door Within</i> trilogy (spoilers ahead, by the way, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re too horrible), from which I take my screen name, there are two universes: Earth, and the Realm. Earth is, well, Earth, and the Realm is a parallel universe populated by what are known as Glimpses. Each Glimpse has a human twin who looks just like them and shares their beliefs/allegiances, though they may not be the same age (to steal the explanation straight from Wikipedia/The Door Within Wiki, don&#39;t remember which). The main characters are human teenagers who are allowed to go to the Realm for a while to serve the King (this is Christian YA, btw). When a human goes to the Realm, their Glimpse twin goes to Earth, so they never meet. Now that the explanation is out of the way, the ships...<br><br>Aidan Thomas/Gwenne. Aidan is the main character of the first book, and Gwenne is his closest friend in the Realm. They&#39;re an adorable couple. But...<br><br>Antoinette/Kern. Antoinette is Gwenne&#39;s human twin, and Kern is the Glimpse twin of Robby, Aidan&#39;s friend. He&#39;s also an evil knight who nearly killed Antoinette in a duel. Oh, and he&#39;s <i>third in command to Satan himself.</i> Yet also...<br><br>Antioinette/Aelic. Aelic is Aidan&#39;s Glimpse. But I don&#39;t ship Antionette/Aidan; ask thou not how the heck this doth work. To further complicate matters...<br><br>Robby/Trenna. Trenna is a Glimpse, and we never see her human twin. These two are also adorable. <br><br>So basically, I&#39;m stuck with a huge mess of Glimpses and humans and it&#39;s all very messed up. Help.<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>As seen in my very first mission, I entertained Neo (The Matrix)/Chell (Portal) for a time. I always thought the two of them were quite similar, being protagonists in a dystopian world who rose up against artificial antagonists and all that. Even though there&#39;s no way a merger between their respective worlds would make sense at all.<br><br>I also once shipped Dash Parr (The Incredibles)/Vanellope von Schweetz (Wreck-It Ralph).

(Sorry for blindsiding you, Scapegrace, but I get impatient.)<br><br>Also, slightly off-topic question. I was rereading the badfic I want to take on next, and I realized it might not be as bad as I thought after all. Checking the reviews (good sources of information on fic characters, BTW) showed that the author responded to criticism of her OC in a mature, thoughtful way, and gave plausible explanations for why various things happened the way they did. Some of the spelling errors vanished, too. It&#39;s still not goodfic--the punctuation is messy and she never explains a certain aspect of the OC&#39;s past--but it seems to be developing into a well-meaning but badly executed fic. Should I continue writing the mission and end on a more diplomatic note, or scrap it entirely and find something more unambiguous? </p>

            <p>First off, I apologize for not being able to beta-read further than I did, in no small part due to <s>procrastination</s> work, academic commitments, and writing my next mission. So I&#39;ll just leave my feelings about this thing here for your convenience, if you don&#39;t mind.<br><br>While this mission was relatively long by your standards, it was actually a bit easier to follow than I&#39;d expected, especially given two authors and four characters at once. Most missions like this tend to be pretty complex and that leaves a lot of room to get confused and the like, so it&#39;s good to see that you two have gone out of your way to keep your agents&#39; personalities distinct. I liked how Will and Chris bounced their dialogue between each other especially, and likewise Ami and VJ, though I was personally hoping for a little more cross-gender dialogue namely with Chris/VJ and Will/Ami. This is a matter of personal taste, though, and I&#39;m still pleased with the final outcome even if I couldn&#39;t go through more SPaG stuff than I did. That being said, one thing I felt was a little lacking was that in some places the characters&#39; dialogue seemed to blend together just a little, especially in cases where lines follow each other without indication of who&#39;s saying them. I know this is usually because two characters are talking but at the very least it&#39;s not a bad idea to distinguish who&#39;s speaking a bit more clearly next time. This advice may be hypocritical of me, of course, seeing as I&#39;ve been guilty of this myself in the past even with some of my solo missions, but it&#39;s still worth considering.<br><br>The execution of the Sue was a bit surprising, especially given that mind-breaking through poetry is not something I&#39;ve seen often in previous missions, but it kinda works in this case. I&#39;m assuming the agents were still in their elf disguises, and my guess is that since Elvish music is used to dispel evil in canon, and such a strategy already works for Sue-wraiths, using it to off a straight-up Sue isn&#39;t too much of a stretch. Nice touch with Ami&#39;s elf form resembling Twilight Princess Zelda, by the way, and I&#39;m reminded now that I need to finish my currently-in-hiatus playthrough of that game as well as actually get more done with the Zelda mission I&#39;ve been working on recently.<br><br>This is a darn good read, all in all, and I do hope you two can collaborate again sometime in the future. Though of course I would recommend picking a shorter badfic next time. XD<br><br>As for the fic you&#39;re taking on right now, the prospect of agents finding out that the fic they&#39;re sporking is actually not as horrible as they feared has quite a bit of precedent, and I myself actually had that happen to me when I sporked that <i>Big Hero 6/Rise of the Guardians</i> crossover last summer. I&#39;d wholeheartedly recommend diplomacy-slash-assimilation if you&#39;re far enough into the mission that you can&#39;t simply scrap it, especially because it&#39;d be a nice change from simply killing off the OC, and the gods know we could use that more often around here. ;)</p>

            <p>...did you not see the part where Chris dropped their disguises and blew the Sue&#39;s mind? The execution by (Bombadil) poetry was partially Matt Cipher&#39;s idea, and it&#39;s the closest I&#39;ve gotten to Ami using her powers on a mission thus far. :) Someday I hope to kill a Sue by saying something intelligent at her, just like they did in IAHF (International Academy of Hetalia Fanfiction).<br><br>I picked Twilight Princess Zelda because she&#39;s beautiful. I need to play through that game, too; I tried a while ago, but I got stuck in the Forest Temple and then life happened and yeah.<br><br>Thanks for your advice about what to do with my next mission. I&#39;m not actually that far into the mission, but I&#39;ll see what I can do with it. We do need less violent endings more often, don&#39;t we?

            <p>Here are some songs from the artists I mentioned. It&#39;s not a comprehensive selection by a long shot, but if you&#39;re really curious, you can sample just about all of their songs on their websites.<br><br>First off, Ed Miller:<br><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=A3mirhMh2ng">The Last Trip Home</a><a></a><br><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rlBRfwu3kWs">At Home With the Exiles</a><a></a><br><br>Jil Chambless and Scooter Muse:<br><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rMsucoM_OzU">The Laverock Sang</a><a></a><br><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8rLEy0zAlyc">Sailing to Philadelphia</a><a></a><br><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JiAksXIe4u8">The Road to Drumleman</a><a></a><br><br><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4SlPg4fsYU4">This</a><a></a> was really all I could find of sufficient quality for Tullamore. The rest of the videos on YouTube seem to be recordings of their live performances, and thus the audio quality isn&#39;t all that great.<br><br>Jed Marum was much easier since he actually has a YouTube channel <a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/jedmarum">here.</a><a></a><br>Here are some of my favorites by him:<br><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=meobi2q7_g4">Even as I Ramble</a><a></a><br><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MmwbK5EDu2o">Desolation Island</a><a></a><br><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OTbwCCZxflk%22">West Texas Wind</a><a></a><br><br>And there we have it.

            <p>While not quite as iconic as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSsfjHCFosw">E1M1</a>, DOOM II&#39;s first level has an awesome tune that played as you built your arsenal while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPHPJ3CgidU">Running from Evil</a>. <br><br>If you&#39;re not looking for vidya gaem tunes, then I suggest checking out Devotchka&#39;s works.

            <p>First up, a song from a Unitarian Universalist folk band (file that one under &quot;phrases I never thought I&#39;d type&quot;) that I find particularly relevant to today&#39;s political climate, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3gOoySyNlI">Lady of the Harbor</a> by Brother Sun. It&#39;s off their second album, &quot;Some Part of the Truth.&quot; If you prefer to listen to a new band&#39;s discography in order, my favorite song from their first album is &quot;Love is the Reason.&quot;<br><br>Second, if you&#39;re into metal covers, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8-V4yuM984">FamilyJules7x&#39;s &quot;Replay&quot;</a> is a medley of songs from various iconic video games...done as metal songs. And holy shit, it is AWESOME. Special mention goes to the Punch-Out theme, the original Zelda theme, the Goldeneye 007 intro, the chill Animal Crossing music, Hyrule Field from Twilight Princess, and &quot;Suicide Mission&quot; from Mass Effect 2 (which literally sounds like it should be playing in a dramatic action movie trailer with one guy reaching for his falling friend yelling NOOOOOOOOOO). Also check out his  Zelda medleys, because they&#39;re also awesome.<br><br>Speaking of Zelda music, I also recommend the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agR5aaQL2PY&amp;list=PL8D1E4637261C45EF&amp;index=31">Kakariko Village theme</a> from <i>Ocarina of Time</i>. To me, this song feels like coming home and watching the sunset after a long, satisfying day. It&#39;s not quite as iconic or pretty or awesome as some other Zelda tunes, but I like it anyway.<br><br>Lastly, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0tBS_IAX-M">&quot;Arwen&#39;s Vigil&quot;</a> by The Piano Guys. Absolutely beautiful and evocative; you can almost see her in Rivendell when you hear this song.</p>

            <p>The first link is wrong, it links to some stuff from the LOTR soundtrack (In Dreams to be specific), not that I mind. <br><br>Personally when I&#39;m writing I love to listen to Two Steps From Hell: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TwoStepsFromTheMusic/videos"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TwoStepsFromTheMusic/videos">https://www.youtube.com/user/TwoStepsFromTheMusic/videos</a></a>, to the point where I&#39;ve given characters specific tracks that I listen to whenever I&#39;m trying to write them. They&#39;re, well I&#39;m not quite sure how to describe them besides epic. <br><br>The second plug from me is slightly different to the previous one. They&#39;re a power metal band from Sweden called Sabaton, almost all of their songs are about historical events, battles or people, covering everything from the well known (Warsaw Uprising, Operation Neptune, Battle of Passchendaele) to the relatively unknown (The Winter War, The Battle of Wizna, The Smoking Snakes) and everything in between. Unfortunately they don&#39;t really have a central channel on Youtube so just look them up. If people want links to specific songs I can provide them.<br></p>

            <p>But they really do do their research, which is one of the reasons I really like them.<br><br>A couple of other plugs that I didn&#39;t mention in my first post, first up Van Canto, an A Capella metal band (well they have a drummer but everything else is A Capella), the other is Gloryhammer, who have some, &#39;interesting&#39; songs and generally make their albums tell some kind of story whilst simultaneously being a parody of normal Power Metal bands.  </p>

            <p>So, first of all, I note continued misunderstandings between you and other Boarders, which is not good, and I don&#39;t like that you&#39;ve thrown out the prompt system. However, we got by evaluating Permission requests without a prompt system for a long time, so I&#39;ll leave that aside for now and take a look at what you&#39;ve come up with. These are my thoughts as I read:<br><br><u>Kelly&#39;s Profile</u><br><br>- <i>Kelly is very picky about what she eats and drinks, and won’t eat food of questionable origin.</i><br><br>-- Welp, she&#39;ll never survive in Headquarters, then.<br><br>- As far as Google can tell me, all polarized glasses are sunglasses. They all seem to have some tint. So basically, Kelly wears sunglasses indoors and looks like a hipster or something.<br><br>- I note confusion about what&#39;s a department and what&#39;s a division. Floaters is a department (the Department of Floaters), and only the Department of Mary Sues contains a Sub-division of Rare Fandoms. Floaters doesn&#39;t need one, because they cover everything anyway.<br><br><u>September&#39;s Profile</u><br><br>- September has an interesting viewpoint that would foil Kelly&#39;s... but apparently we&#39;ll never get to see them have a discussion about it, because September is too shy to mention it? What&#39;s the point of that?<br><br>- There&#39;s a janitor. With <s>Ambiguous</s> Trope Disorder, apparently, who is not yet developed. Why is this included in what ought to be a finished, polished permission request?<br><br><u>Prompt One</u><br><br>- Unbeta&#39;d. Again, this is supposed to be a finished, polished request. Not off to a great start.<br><br>- <i>She had just managed to get all of the dirt on the floor swept into a pile when.</i><br><br>-- Misplaced period. That ought to be a colon, introducing the [BEEP!].<br><br>- More minor mechanical errors.<br><br>- Kelly the neat-freak is remarkably accepting of the giant hole in her ceiling after the initial shout. &quot;Oh, you made a mistake that dropped a pile of junk into my freshly cleaned RC? Eh, never mind.&quot;<br><br>- A mini-Reaver, Renolds, makes Kelly&#39;s line way creepier than you probably intended. Ew ew ew. *shudder*<br><br>- Neuralyzer gag is good.<br><br>- Apparently both Sorting and Building Maintenance are incompetent?<br><br><u>Prompt Two</u><br><br>- &quot;Bleeprin&quot; misspelled and uncapitalized. You shouldn&#39;t need a beta to catch this.<br><br>- &quot;Neuralyze&quot; also misspelled. How did you get it right (if Britified) in the first prompt and so wrong here?<br><br>- Really bizarre block of exposition about why Kelly thinks there&#39;s cat poop in the coffee, which is fine, and how she eventually learns otherwise, which is completely irrelevant to the situation at hand.<br><br>- So this is &quot;Kelly and September first interlude,&quot; but September only shows up halfway through. Huh.<br><br>- <i>Somewhere on the other side of Headquarters, Tzararrraaakekekena sneezed and then fell into a plot hole.</i><br><br>-- Um, no, sorry, I can&#39;t accept this. Agents falling into HQ because of what we presume are other people&#39;s plotholes is one thing, but an agent falling <i>out</i> of HQ just because her author blatantly doesn&#39;t want to write her anymore is pure laziness.<br><br>- Shy, down-to-earth September insults a Klingon for no reason. The explanation just given about the Idiot Ball, which has to do with a character <i>failing</i> to take a simple, conflict-avoiding action, not with the author <i>forcing</i> them to do something completely stupid and against their stated character, does not explain this.<br><br>- I am not willing to read ten pages for a Permission request anyway.<br><br><u>Final Analysis</u><br><br>I do not care to read the second prompt past September&#39;s random, unprovoked insult, so I&#39;m afraid my response is Permission Denied, for the following reasons.<br><br>This request is not polished: the assorted spelling and punctuation errors, while individually minor, are irritating, especially when they happen to unique words like Bleeprin or canon words that would create minis in a fic. I also note there&#39;s still a comment in place further down in the second prompt.<br><br>It seems that you continue to have issues communicating with other Boarders, up to and including not understanding when a beta is or is not finished with their work. This baffles me a bit, because generally I think you&#39;ve been doing pretty well here on the Board, but if you can&#39;t work with betas, it doesn&#39;t bode well for the success of your future works.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the tone. I can see that you&#39;re trying to create PPC-style humor, but I don&#39;t think you quite understand what it&#39;s all about. It&#39;s forced and unnatural; the author&#39;s hand clearly shows in every &quot;ironic&quot; and &quot;random&quot; thing that happens. For that reason, it&#39;s just not funny.<br><br>I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve got a firm grasp on your characterization, either. I have a big issue with the fact that Kelly is stated to be someone who cares about keeping her RC clean, and yet, after the initial shock, she just shrugs it off when a huge chunk of ceiling is dropped onto her floor. Another thing that concerns me is that you&#39;ve completely cut off what could be an interesting source of interactions between the agents by making September too shy, or conflict-avoiding, or whatever, to risk annoying Kelly by bringing up positive points in their missions. That tells me you don&#39;t understand what good agent pair dynamics are about.<br><br>Further to the point on characterization, if you really understand your characters, you ought to know or be able to figure out how they would behave in any given situation, up to and including any of the Permission prompts. If you can&#39;t do that, you need to work on your characters more, not to mention your basic scene-crafting abilities. Ignoring any scenario you don&#39;t like is not a solution to this problem if you want to write missions, where you have to creatively, but faithfully, interpret and present whatever your chosen target throws at you.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry, I can see you&#39;re working hard at this, but you&#39;re not there yet.<br><br>Let me know if I can clarify any points for you.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

Kelly isn&#39;t the type to do some of these things willingly, and I don&#39;t really want to pair her with someone who would force her.  If the Orkan forces her to chase kids in the Nursery, Kelly is going to assassinate her as a Sue, and I&#39;m not sure how to make that funny.  I also don&#39;t know how to make her feel guilty about the Duty when she&#39;s quite the opposite.<br><br>I could try working from the prompts again, but I think it would be better if they were the starting scenarios instead of the destination.

            <p><i>Too much Douglas Adams</i><br><br>Actually, the problem is that I had no idea you were going for Douglas Adams there. It was the first big block of rambling I&#39;d seen in your writing, so it felt out of place. For that reason, it read like either or both of two things: 1) someone had expressed confusion about Kelly&#39;s opinion, so you dropped in a block of text to explain it; and/or 2) you didn&#39;t want to let Kelly be seen to be wrong, so you felt the need to explain why she was only temporarily mistaken and how she would eventually be right again.<br><br>It&#39;s fine to emulate the style of writers you admire, but it has to be consistent, or at least smoothly integrated, in order to work.<br><br><i>I just needed someone who would force Kelly to do something</i><br><br>There&#39;s forcing and there&#39;s forcing. Constructing a believable scenario in-universe that will push a character toward certain actions is one thing. Literally making them do things because the author says so is another. I mean, yes, it&#39;s all because the author says so really, but you don&#39;t want to <i>advertise</i> that. You could&#39;ve at least written what&#39;s-her-name out naturally instead of literally dropping her in a plothole.<br><br>You gotta be able to think of reasons for your characters to do things they might not want to. What really drives them? What greater purpose would make them choose to temporarily put their preferences aside?<br><br>Or, to run with the food fight, how could circumstances conspire against them to the point where they&#39;re stuck? In the Cafeteria, it&#39;s pretty easy for me to imagine. Character goes to the Caf to get a bite to eat. The only empty table is right at the back, furthest away from all the doors. Some fool starts a food fight. Character has to walk through it in order to escape. Maybe she gets angry enough to fling some tater tots (or whatever) herself along the way. Hey presto, Character has joined a food fight.<br><br>You really, really need to think outside the box more.<br><br><i>Other than PPC missions, do you have any recommended reading or watching for realistic comedy?</i><br><br>Oh lord yes! I don&#39;t have a lot of time right now, but the show <i>Psych</i> springs immediately to mind. It&#39;s about a guy with superior powers of observation who pretends to be a psychic to get himself a job as a psychic consultant with the local police department. The acting of the two leads and their main foil is a little (okay, a lot) over-the-top at times, but everyone mostly behaves like real people. I&#39;ll try to come up with more when I don&#39;t have to run off to work.<br><br><i>Can someone tell me how to remove the Deadpooling from this prompt?</i><br><br>I don&#39;t know quite what you mean by Deadpooling, but lemme point out that &quot;in their care&quot; doesn&#39;t necessarily mean &quot;they own a mini.&quot; Again, think about other interpretations.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

I&#39;m not taking it personally, but I am bothered by something that someone said during her sorting room story.

They have been ordered to play tag.<br><br>-The agents have been inexplicably de-aged, and sent to nursery until they age up again. They are not amused by this.<br><br>-Or they <i>are</i> amused by it.<br><br>-The agents have been seconded by their department head to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Sprout_Movement">Sprout Movement</a> to teach a badge, but the kids won&#39;t sit still for even five minutes, sweet mercy.<br><br>That&#39;s all literally off the top of my head, in about five minues.

            <h1>1: It&#39;s close enough for writing. Like I say, they&#39;re supposed to prompt you, not be dictatorial.<br><br>#2: Have you heard of the concept of <i>in media res</i>? It means picking up the action in the middle. If your agents tend to rationalise themselves out of getting into trouble, a) that&#39;s going to cause you problems with writing interesting missions, but b) just start them off running down the hill. Work backwards from there to how it happened, rather than trying to work forwards.<br><br>I have no idea why <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jFddeA6xDGWo5vJxDvOUep_LPJIzrmgZ5EwUUzFj8jg/pub">Sandra thought having a giant Azhdarchid chase her was a good idea</a> in #042, but for that story, it really doesn&#39;t matter.<br><br>#3: Yeah, that... isn&#39;t how it&#39;s meant to be used. I&#39;m baffled that you&#39;d do that rather than just doing the dice thing, but even more: they&#39;re supposed to be pairs, one that&#39;s &#39;a thing happens to them&#39;, and one that&#39;s more interesting if you can get your agents to fit it. This may explain some of the trouble you&#39;ve been having.<br><br>hS</h1>

            <p>I haven&#39;t written it yet, but I plan to go back in time and post it once I do.

And you&#39;re right--I did. :D However, it didn&#39;t come to mind--mostly because I was thinking of an agent pair, the trope as it appears in fanfic--which is generally only one or two children, unless it&#39;s the Avengers--and, most definitely, not the Council. I mean, they aren&#39;t in their capacity as agents while in a meeting, are they?<br><br>-or I was just very tired and very busy and my mind didn&#39;t make the connection. You decide.-<br><br>And I still have the mental images of--nope, nope, stopping myself there before I go off and write a series of drabbles of different ways it could happen to different agents. I need to do research.<br><br>...maybe tomorrow.<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: Like I said below, these two messages made me laugh so hard :D I really, truly had forgotten.<br><br>And then I reread the story and laughed and it was good. ~DF</p>

            <p>In the midst of this harrowing thread. . . <br>First off, I haven&#39;t been following this thread too-too closely (I haven&#39;t read the story in question), but what you said here has been burning in the back of my brain for a while. Warning: what follows is a little rant-y. Really I should save this and revise it in the morning, but I&#39;m afraid that if I keep putting this off, I&#39;ll never write it at all.<br><br>&quot;Okay, maybe this is my not understanding normal people and their priorities very well. I have constantly been told off for giving attention to something that other people think is unimportant. Once in class, my lunch exploded in my bag. I was expected to sit there until the end of the period when I was holding back a meltdown about how yogurt was soaking into my stuff.&quot;<br><br>How do you know you&#39;re the weird one? Maybe it&#39;s the teacher who has misplaced priorities. Sure, they were in a position to tell you off for having different priorities, but might does not make right (dystopias, anyone?).<br><br>Even if the teacher is the &quot;normal&quot; one, there is something fundamentally wrong with trying to make your writing relatable to the most &quot;normal&quot; person you can imagine, and that something is the fact that people who are not strictly &quot;normal&quot; read, too. A lot of them are sick and tired of, say, being expected to hold back a meltdown, and your writing could be a breath of fresh air to them. I know you want to maximize your audience, but gaining the respect of smaller groups should never be discounted, because they can be very passionate. To take an example from the recent Shipfest: Scapegrace wrote <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n_bcgxMCtiBcsjFvV4G8kfWkv3VFzTlmbkMnvVDmpDs/pub">a beautiful fluffy story</a> about Iximaz and Kaitlyn in a lesbian, long-term, BDSM relationship. Is being in a lesbian BDSM relationship &quot;normal&quot;? No one would say that; it&#39;s a subculture within a minority. But if Scapegrace had written an equally beautiful piece about a straight vanilla couple getting married, would I <s>take every excuse, no matter how flimsy, to wedge it into a conversation</s> still be talking about it a month later? No. Would I be planning to spread it around to my friends? No way. Would I have decided to go back and read through every mission Scapegrace has ever written? Probably not. Would I be considering applying for permission because the Notary gave me a great idea for a character? Again, probably not. What made Scapegrace&#39;s story stand out was that she wrote honestly, about what was real to her, and that it was different. Before she wrote that story, I could count the number of beautiful fluffy lesbian BDSM stories I&#39;d read on the fingers of one elbow. That&#39;s saying something, since I&#39;d spent time specifically looking for a story that fit that description. But most authors were writing for &quot;normal people,&quot; and I was about to give the idea up as futile. Then Scapegrace wrote this story and acquired a passionate fandom of one (I should mention that I am not the only one who thought this story was great, just the only one who vaguely wants to found a fan base around it). So if you were to appeal to a slightly wider group (say, people who wish that cleaning up messes was more of a priority) you could find yourself with a small but very loyal group of readers. Not to mention, I find writing from a perspective I agree with or about something I care about to be much easier, and the final product to be much better. It&#39;s the old saw about writing what you know. It&#39;s not always true, but it often is. For instance, writing this took me only a couple of hours, while writing a paper for class is taking me several days (possibly because I keep stopping in the middle to write posts like this).<br><br>Anyway, isn&#39;t this what writing is all about? Entertaining people while you convince them that the ways you see the world make sense, whether they&#39;re small ways, like the idea that &quot;insects are super cool if you take the time to look at them,&quot; or big things like &quot;it&#39;s important not to destroy forests&quot; or middle-sized things like &quot;sloppily-written fanfic is a bad thing.&quot; Or &quot;it makes sense for people to pay attention to the fact that their lunch has exploded.&quot; Please, write a world where it&#39;s acceptable for people to stop whatever they&#39;re doing and clean up their yogurt. <br><br>I don&#39;t see any reason why that world can&#39;t be the PPC. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s been canonically determined that all PPC agents must ignore messes (that would be a pretty bizarre regulation to have in place, especially since the PPC is generally rather loose about that sort of thing). If you wanted to spend an entire interlude getting the ceiling cleaned up, I bet you could pull it off (it would be a actually be good chance to show some of your agent&#39;s character, to demonstrate the dynamics between her and other characters, and to develop the structure of the PPC&#39;s maintenance department further).<br><br>Not-normal people are <em>valid</em>. And interesting. Don&#39;t be afraid to write about them. Please.</p>

            <p>But in general, stealing other people&#39;s jokes is... kind of a bad thing. I notice a statement in one of your other posts that suggests you did the same with Douglas Adams?<br><br>Which brings me on to my main point. You seem to be suggesting that you don&#39;t really understand the idea of humour (that&#39;s not your exact words, it&#39;s my interpretation of... a lot of stuff), and don&#39;t get why people think most comedy is amusing. If that&#39;s true, then I really have to ask: why on <i>Earth</i> are you trying so hard to get permission to write in a comedic setting?

            <p>The part where I mention Douglas Adams is his style of just wandering off on a tangent.

            <p>In order not to mislead anyone, I should probably mention that I did only a very light betaing job, and that was mainly on the idiot ball part. I did mention one or two things from earlier, but that was from skimming to see what was going on. I have at no point read this piece thoroughly (apart from the idiot ball scene), and I have not commented thoroughly on it, either.<br><br>I also started replying to your reply, but ran out of time to complete it and post due to it being the end of term. However, you had no way of knowing that, and I do apologize that it got lost. It still wasn&#39;t a heavy betaing job (I&#39;m unlikely to have time to even think about volunteering for that until the end of next week), but it does have (and was going to include) a few more things that might, I hope, be helpful/clarifying/etc. I am willing to try to finish and post it around the end of this week (or the end of next week, if I run out of time), if you like.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Actually, in light of the conversation going on a thread or several above with Data Junkie, I&#39;m second guessing what I was writing--part of it was a walkthrough of the thought process behind choosing and writing a prompt. (I will mention, though, that B&#39;Elanna Torres, while she looks pretty awesome from the Memory Alpha wiki page, is half-Klingon half-human, and mostly not raised in Klingon society. She also seems to have all sorts of very interesting issues caused by her family situation. All of that, however, means that she probably isn&#39;t the best example of what a Klingon is, just as Spock isn&#39;t the best example of what a Vulcan is--oh, wow, now I really want to watch everything with her in it and compare the two of them, that sounds so interesting.)<br><br>But yeah. Like I said, you couldn&#39;t have known--I posted on March 25th and then got really busy and disappeared from that thread. I&#39;d also never really intended to do more than light betaing, since I was pretty sure you weren&#39;t intending to wait around until late April to be able to post your request. I just wanted to make it clear that I&#39;d both only done light betaing--and not on the full story, either--but that I hadn&#39;t exactly said to you that I was accepting the beta job and was going to be in touch again. What I meant--though, looking back at what I wrote, it looks a bit more ambiguous than I&#39;d originally thought--was that I didn&#39;t have time to actually beta, but here were some of the main things I noticed while glancing at the piece.<br><br>Speaking of betaing: setting aside what an Idiot Ball does and does not do (I&#39;m not a Troper, so that completely slipped by me), that scene is a lot clearer now. I still have no idea what a not-quite-Idiot Ball is doing in HQ to begin with (and, as Nesh pointed out, it isn&#39;t doing what an Idiot Ball does), but the piece of the story with people holding it is much better than it was. So kudos on that bit of editing!<br><br>And, with that (and a promise to anyone reading that the Purim RP will happen, and I have until the end of this week to make it happen in the right month...) I should really get back to work and schoolwork and hopefully doing it instead of kind of staring at things and reading old fanfics. So. *waves and vanishes, leaving Swiss Bleepolate squares on a random table that was totally here all along, dontcha know...*<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>So, I got my permission roughly four years ago, and I haven&#39;t done anything with it. Not a single mission or short story about my agents in that time, despite me trying. I just noticed the rules for permission have changed from &quot;prove you can write well&quot; to something slightly more complex, and I&#39;m wondering, do I need to redo my permission request?</p>

            <p>Does anyone know why the permission rules were changed specifically to what they are now? I was talking about the changes with a few other older (now infrequent) members and they mentioned the changes feel like they went from &quot;show us how you write&quot; to &quot;prove you can write the way we want&quot;. A couple of them even said they&#39;re pretty sure they wouldn&#39;t have permission if they had to write under the new rules and I am in the same boat, because I am terrible at prompted writing, I failed literally every writing prompt assignment I had from middle school all the way to the SAT, despite maintaining the highest English average in the state.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll happily acknowledge that I want Permission-seekers to prove they can write missions I want to read, or at least don&#39;t actively <i>not</i> want to read.<br><br>Also, it&#39;s pretty much always been half the point of Permission. As explained in the Permission article, under &quot;Why Do I Need Permission?&quot;:<br><br> When you are writing about your agents and HQ, you are borrowing the world that was created by Jay and Acacia. They specifically requested that spin-off authors use their gadgets, follow their naming system for new stuff, include jokes and references, and try not to contradict PPC backstory. This has since been interpreted to include generally keeping to the spirit of the Original Series. Permission ensures that people who want to write a spin-off actually want to write a <i>PPC</i> spin-off—one that satisfies the above requirements—and not to make up something completely different. (Making up something completely different is cool, but calling it &quot;PPC&quot; is not.) 
<br>So, yeah. As far as I&#39;m concerned, you got it!<br><br>D&#39;you suppose being unable to write from a prompt also extends to not being able to write within the parameters of a mission, and/or the set conditions provided by a badfic? &#39;Cause if so, that sort of makes the prompt system a great test of whether or not someone can actually write missions, too.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So this is up here because it isn’t answering to a specific post; it’s my thoughts about the whole thing.<br><br>The main issues are actually addressed on the Permission Article and the Prompts Document: “Cheating is not encouraged, but the PG’s won’t ever know” and “Suggested lengths aren’t hard limits, but the PG’s have lives outside the PPC” (not in these exact words). <br><br>Part of being a PPCer is knowing what should and what shouldn’t be taken seriously; e.g. if canon says that you cannot kill Aslan, you just can’t, but if Gary Stu claims you can’t defeat him, because he is immortal, it’s a challenge to work around this limitation and defend canon anyway. I’m not sure whether somebody who doesn’t know how to work around limitations that aren’t even malicious, but meant to help, is ready to seek Permission. But since I don’t want to see potential wasted, a hint for thickheaded Permission-seekers may be in order: <br><br>“If you absolutely cannot do it in any other way, grip the prompt that fits best for a starting point and do with it whatever you want, as long as what you want to do is letting your agents experience the PPC. If this isn’t what you want to do, why are you even here?”<br><br>Maybe this should be the answer to one last Permission FAQ? But to be absolutely certain that I got this right, I would like to know whether the PGs can agree to the following:<ul>
<br><li>We will never see a “permission denied” solely based on “apart from the first two sentences, where a badfic character chases your agents into a situation nobody ever thought of putting into a writing prompt, although it perfectly depicts the PPC’s quirkyness, your otherwise excellent writing example totally missed the point of Prompt No. 15 and any other random prompt you might have gotten”.<br>
</li>
<li> We will never see a “permission denied” solely based on “your otherwise perfect writing example that isn’t rambling pointlessly exceeds a given word count”.<br>
</li>
<li>We may see an epic permission request drop off the Board’s front page (and the second page, and the third page...) before any PG finds the time to take it on.</li>

<li>Part of the point of the random prompts was to give us some variety in our reading material. As hS said at some point, you can only read &quot;an agent talks to the SO&quot; (or any scene) so many times before getting a bit sick of it. Creativity is <i>good</i>, as long as the place it takes you is still the PPC.<br><br>2 &amp; 3. As you&#39;ve noted, the word count range is a suggestion, not a hard rule. If a story is good, I&#39;ll read it. If it isn&#39;t, I&#39;ll stop when I get sick of it and say why. If it&#39;s because you rambled pointlessly and gave us 2500 words where 800 would have done, I&#39;ll chastise you for not recognizing good advice when you see it, too.<br><br>And speaking of which, HG, I would just like to thank you for actually reading the Permission article and 36 Prompts doc. I know I speak for hS and myself, and probably others, too, when I say that we&#39;ve worked really hard to explain all of this as clearly and nicely as possible, but it doesn&#39;t do a damn bit of good if nobody actually <i>reads</i> it.<br><br>That said, there is almost always room for improvement. I&#39;ll take a look at both documents later this week, when I have time, and see about fitting in your suggestion and some tweaks to the wording I&#39;ve thought of regarding word count.<br><br>Any larger changes, I&#39;d like to see discussed more fully when we&#39;ve put some distance between us and this thread.<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>My concern with the third is this, though: If there&#39;s a request whose prompt(s) are excessively long, what&#39;s to stop PGs from going &quot;I don&#39;t have time to examine this whole thing, let someone else handle it&quot;?

            <p>&quot;D&#39;you suppose being unable to write from a prompt also extends to not being able to write within the parameters of a mission, and/or the set conditions provided by a badfic? &#39;Cause if so, that sort of makes the prompt system a great test of whether or not someone can actually write missions, too.&quot;<br><br>No, I think just the opposite. A promt is something thrust upon you. Sure the current system gives options, but they&#39;re still constraining. Writing a mission, on the other hand, is just the opposite. You get to pick what you want to do with a story you pick out, and there are far more options out there. More than we could possibly conceive of. Not only that, but you&#39;re not limited to missions. You can do stuff with your agents in headquarters, or on vacation, or whatever.<br><br>Not only that, but a few of the people who said they can&#39;t write from prompts have done missions, so that kinda also goes contrary to the idea that prompts are a great idea.</p>

            <p>Make prompts an option instead of a necessity?

            <p>If so, then I&#39;m all for it.<br><br>The restrictions on what non-prompted samples should consist of would be:<br><br>-Two samples (to give us a variety of views of your writing &amp; agents).<br><br>-400-800 words each (because PGs are actually people too, and don&#39;t have the energy to sit through 90,000 words because you felt like it).<br><br>-Both must prominently feature both of your agents, and have them interact with each other (because I&#39;m fed up to the back teeth of reading about one agent talking to the Marquis).<br><br>-At least one must <i>not</i> be one of the control prompts from the 36 Prompts sheet (because seriously, if all you can think of to write is the everyone-does-it-almost-the-same PPC-procedural stuff, you need to work on your imagination).<br><br>-If you produce two non-prompted samples that don&#39;t show us what we need to see (one way or the other), the PGs reserve the right to laugh at you uproariously (because we&#39;ve given you all the help we can, and you decided not to take it).<br><br>I&#39;ll probably trim that last one out.<br><br>Thoughts, people?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Look, I&#39;ve done roleplaying. Kind of a lot of it, by now, both over Gmail chat and on Tumblr. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen them--there are these long lists of RP prompts.<br><br>Yes, the missions are kind of like a roleplay, I guess. Instead of one or both RPers deciding on the general plotline, you have the badfic as a rough guide which can be skipped forward in and cut off at a certain point.<br><br>However: the prompts are exactly like a roleplay. Look, let&#39;s say I was writing RP prompts for PPC characters. I might write something like this:<br><br>-Character A has just broken the console. Character B is upset because [they wanted to go on that mission/this is the second time this week!/they hate the Techie who always comes to fix it/they think the console might be sentient/etc]<br><br>-Character B has done something to get in trouble with the Sunflower Official. Character A tries to rescue them.<br><br>-Characters A meets character B in the Cafeteria.<br><br>-Character B comes back from Rudi&#39;s to find character A (a stranger) moving into their RC. ((OOC: I would so write this as character A trying to claim character B&#39;s room because character B keeps almost nothing in there and so character A thought it was empty, that sounds hilarious.))<br><br>And so on.<br><br>If you&#39;ve noticed--these are rather similar to the prompts. They&#39;re just written in a slightly different style.<br><br>In fact--some of the Permission Prompts, rewritten as RP prompts!<br><br>-Character B just hit character A in a food fight. Whoops? (One agent falls to accidental friendly fire in a food fight.)<br><br>-It&#39;s time to do the Duty, but characters A and B both want to do it! (The agents argue over who gets to do the Duty.)<br><br>-Character A and character B desperately need coffee. Unfortunately, it&#39;s on the other side of the Cafeteria...and there&#39;s a food fight going on. (The agents must navigate a food fight to get to the coffee.)<br><br>-Character A thinks character B is a Sue. Character B has to prove they aren&#39;t. (One agent is mistaken for a Sue, and has to prove otherwise.)<br><br>-Character A and character B are [taking a walk/bored on a mission/hanging out/etc], when they find a mysterious thing. (The agents find a mysterious thing.)<br><br>(Okay, so, this is a lot of fun. I also keep wanting to write &#39;my character&#39; and &#39;your character&#39;, as is another style of RP prompting, but...they both belong to the same author in a Permission request, so I have resisted).<br><br>Let&#39;s see...my point. Yes.<br><br>My point is that, yes, a badfic being used for a mission is rather like a roleplay scenario. It&#39;s in a format I don&#39;t generally see, but yes, you could call it one, especially when you&#39;re cowriting. However, my other point: that&#39;s exactly what the prompts are, too! &quot;You get a scenario and what your characters do is up to you&quot;--that&#39;s exactly it! Honestly, RP prompts as I normally see them are *more* specific as to how the characters react! &quot;My character meets your character at a coffee shop and can&#39;t stop looking at your character&#39;s hair.&quot; &quot;Your character saves mine from tripping into a lake, and my character insists on doing something in return.&quot; You also get things like, &quot;Character A is a barista and character B is the customer they&#39;ve had a crush on for most of the year&quot;, or &quot;Character A is an overworked student and character B is their classmate who just wants to buy them lunch sometime&quot;. In fact, rewriting some prompts into RP prompt style made me realize that they&#39;re really wide open--I added in &#39;desperate for coffee&#39; for one of them, and kept trying not to get more specific in the other ones (though I did add some options for where they might be in the last one). If I&#39;d gone more specific, the last one would&#39;ve read more like, &quot;Character A finds a mysterious object. How does character B react?&quot; or &quot;Character B finds a mysterious object, and character A thinks they should leave it alone.&quot; or something.<br><br>Basically...apart from style, I don&#39;t really see much difference. You can very easily treat these prompts as RP prompts--more easily than you can a mission, IMO, since a mission has the framework of the badfic to keep an eye on. It informs your story in a way that a more general prompt does not. Even an interlude is a bit freer, especially if it&#39;s of the sort where your main goal is to have two characters meet--you quite literally choose a setting, a situation, figure out the reason why they&#39;re meeting, and go. It can be any length, go in any direction (unless you have a particular goal, in which case you&#39;ll probably be trying to stick to that), and include whatever you like. You are the only one guiding it--there is no preset framework of &#39;this is what is happening in the story they are analyzing which is also the world they&#39;re currently in&#39;.<br><br>(That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t like missions; I do. They just involve a different sort of writing process, to some extent.)<br><br>But yeah. Essentially:<br><br>-writing RP prompts is *fun*, and I should do it more often.<br><br>-missions can be considered to be like roleplay, but the Permission Prompts, IMO, are *exactly* that sort of thing as well, and are actually a lot more general than a lot of the RP prompts out there.<br><br>-a prompt can be interpreted in a whole lot of different ways, which, I would guess, is one reason why groups that write using prompts can work despite having different types of writers in them.<br><br>There may well be a few that are a bit restrictive; I haven&#39;t exactly been through all of them lately, though I have written some short pieces based on some of them (why? Because it sounded like fun--my exact words were probably something like &#39;why should the newbies have all the fun?&#39;--, and then it turned out to be fun for me, so I kept going. I&#39;ll post them sometime when there aren&#39;t any current/especially recent Permission requests up--I really did write them for fun, not to be seen as examples or somesuch.) However, a whole lot of them look like regular, rather general (that is, wide open for interpretation) prompts to me. Hopefully I&#39;ve at least illustrated my point well enough (and maybe entertained with the prompts?) in what&#39;s become a long post, even if I haven&#39;t changed your opinion.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Is more about the creative process.  And creative control.  Yes we are working in an overall set universe, but that does not need to be restrictive in an of itself.  Look at the entirety of fanfiction itself.  <br><br>I think a good analogy is this the prompts are effectively when a GM railroads an RPG rather then letting it play out naturally.  Yes it can still be fun, but not as much as if you had greater control over what you could do.  So effectively different styles of scenarios then.  Or another way to look at it would be who is in control of the scenario.<br><br>With a prompted system the ones who created the prompts are in control, whereas without a prompted system the writer (or players in my stretched RPG metaphor) is in control.  Another way to look at it is, the prompts, at least to me, seem to be:  not can you write well, but do you fit our cookie cutter mold of what a [PPC] writer should be.  And I will say that the fitting the mold is one of the reasons I have yet to seek permission.  <br><br>I think the real question needs to be what is the purpose of Permission.  Is it to show you can write well and won&#39;t be hypocritical by going after other works.  Or is it to show you fit the mold of what this current group of permission givers think is the proper way to write [for the PPC]<br><br>  </p>

            <p>Yes, you need to write well and not be a hypocrite. Yes, you also need to be able to write in a style that works in our quirky, humor-based universe. This has never NOT been the case. Look at Jay and Acacia&#39;s rules.<br><br>Also, I put to the &quot;I can&#39;t write from prompts&quot; side a query:<br><br>The four control prompts are things like &quot;the agents meet for the first time,&quot; &quot;the agents receive a mission,&quot; etc. (At work, not looking it up ATM.)

            <p>To be fair, part of this is my fault. One of the reasons I can&#39;t write for the prompts we have, and why others would find it difficult I suspect, is the length. With how short these samples have to be, something like &quot;the agents meet for the first time&quot; is going to feel awful rushed if I could pull it off at all in the word limit given. Something closer to 2500 word max would probably be better.</p>

            <p>Short stories are a special challenge.  <br><br>In the prompts, there is some stuff that you can skip over, like actually describing the scenes and what the agents do for a living could be boiled down into a few words.<br><br>I admit that I was rambling for mine, more worried about trying to hit a prompt than actual good storytelling.

            <p>So if you can&#39;t convince me you can write in 800 words, what makes you think tripling that will suddenly improve that?

            <p>2500 really is not a lot. 800, on the other hand, barely gives room to establish characterization for two full-fledged characters beyond a basic outline of what they&#39;re like. The shorter the piece the more rushed and less organic it&#39;s going to feel. And honestly if the current PGs are that adverse to reading something shorter than your average high school essay, maybe we should get some new PGs who have more time on their hands?</p>

            <p>There&#39;s this thing you might have heard of called Real Life. And another thing called Fun. <br><br>Fun is not being forced to write the equivalent of a high school essay, and Fun is not having to check something the equivalent of a high school essay. I&#39;m not shy of writing long missions but if the prompts were supposed to be 2500 words each that would have definitely scared me off of the community, or at least asking Permission. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one.<br><br>Real Life also makes things that are not the PPC a priority: schoolwork (hi college with 20-page papers), work-work, family (especially PGs with children), health problems, other leisure activities such as sports or clubs. It would take PGs longer to get around to approving/denying requests that are so long, which is unfair to the person requesting Permission. Asking for new PGs with &quot;more time on their hands&quot; is not only like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles, but also incredibly disrespectful because it seems you&#39;re implying the current ones are incapable of doing our jobs over a hypothetical change to the system that, frankly, I&#39;m not too fond of because of the above mentioned problems.<br><br>The PPC is supposed to be about having fun and I really don&#39;t see how requiring the equivalent of a high school essay is &quot;fun&quot;.</p>

            <p>Ideally the minimum would be somewhere in the 800-1000 range because I doubt it&#39;s possible to do what you need to do with the writing samples in less then that,but whatever.<br><br>As for not scaring people off with high word counts, honestly more than being restricted by the badfic they&#39;re dealing with, something people have brought up already as a reason to stick with this current system, they are going to have to deal with reading and writing stories well in excess of 1000 words.</p>

            <p>They <i>are</i> obliged to read your Permission requests - at least, the PGs are, and they are busy people who do not want to sit through and concrit a few 2500-word pieces of semi-original writing.<br><br>I think you&#39;ve completely missed the point of the Permission process as it stands, and since the Board is a nice place I&#39;m going to assume Hanlon&#39;s Razor is in effect as to why, so let me break it down for you. The Permission prompts, as they stand, are to get a feeling for how you <i>write</i>. Yes, you can and should put in characterization for your agents, but it&#39;s secondary to how well you can put words in a pleasing order. It&#39;s short because the PGs don&#39;t want to wade through a river of liquid arse, and I&#39;ll thank you to stop insulting them for having that entirely legitimate concern. Recall that long-winded descriptions, meandering sentences, and a general inability to shut up are both common traits among inexperienced writers <i>and</i> something we charge for.<br><br>So please, and I know there&#39;s sod-all chance of you listening to this but it has to be said, <i>just bloody stop</i>. Even if you genuinely had no idea about how the new Permission system worked and were curious about it, it doesn&#39;t affect you. You have Permission! As far as I&#39;m concerned, it&#39;s permanent! None of this is in any way relevant to your ability to write PPC spinoffs! So, and I say this with the greatest possible respect, shut up moaning.<br><br>Christ, this is like zdimensia all over again. Only she was <i>definitely</i> serious.</p>

            <p>We switched to prompts because people were tired of fandoms they didn&#39;t know? That&#39;s kinda lame. I mean, I got my permission based on what was originally original fiction.

            <p>You&#39;ve... you&#39;ve taken a literal parenthetical aside and claimed it was my entire point.<br><br>But okay, I&#39;m going to assume that was an incomprehensible but honest mistake, rather than an attempt to dismiss my opinion based on deception. Just for you, here&#39;s a summary of how and why the Permission process has changed.<br><br><b>Too Long; Misconstrued version:</b><br><br>When we didn&#39;t say what people should write, they either gave us old and non-humorous stuff, or complained that they didn&#39;t know what to write.<br><br><b>Full, Actual version:</b><br><br>In the beginning there was Jay, and also Acacia. And when folk came before them, seeking to write in their universe, they spake, saying, &#39;Oh, you wrote that fic about Legolas and Gimli exploring the Misty Mountains! You&#39;re pretty good, go ahead.&#39; And lo, the multitudes did write PPC, and it was good.<br><br><i>You wait; time passes.</i><br><br>The applicant approached, and the PG pondered<br>Saying, &#39;Seems I don&#39;t know you as well as I would.<br>What have you written?&#39; And the applicant answered:<br>&#39;My fics are found here; choose what catches your eye.&#39;<br>And the PG perused fics, and granted their goal.<br><br><i>You wait; time passes.</i><br><br>But a problem emerged as the web moved on:<br>The PPC&#39;s intake wrote less and less fic!<br>So PGs asked for samples, and Boarders all flailed,<br>For nothing they had would really quite click.<br><br>They showed us old darkfic, they showed us their rhymes,<br>None of which told us they&#39;d do well in HQ;<br>We suggested they write a short piece with their agents,<br>And then they complained we weren&#39;t clear what to do!<br><br>So we made it quite plain: here&#39;s your prompts, write them well,<br>They&#39;ll ensure you don&#39;t have to go back and try twice.<br>No more flailing and writing whatever you think of!<br>We have given you clear and concise advice!<br><br><i>You wait; time passes.</i><br><br>But there&#39;s always a problem, isn&#39;t there? I came up with the prompts because people were being told to write PPC samples, but replying with &#39;I don&#39;t know what to write&#39;, or &#39;Can I just give you a scene from my mission?&#39;, or &#39;Here&#39;s my story about one of my agents doing something, which will show you nothing about the other one&#39;. Then they got turned down, and had to do it all again, which wasn&#39;t fun for anyone. The alternative was that they wrote their agent(s) arriving in HQ, which a) tended to only use one agent, and b) were all the same.<br><br>Why were they writing PPC samples in the first place? Because PPCers have stopped being fanficcers. People were giving us &#39;writing samples&#39; which were five years old, or were written in a genre that didn&#39;t tell us anything about how they&#39;d do writing in a humorous setting. (I remember someone trying two or three times with a high-fantasy pseudo-epic.) <i>Your</i> sample, Data Junkie (yes, I&#39;m looking at it), while not overtly comedic, shows off how you can write dialogue, put-upon employees, and scene transitions, and present information that your readers may not know. Many or most samples of the time didn&#39;t do that very well.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Most if not all of this was in the posts you misunderstood. For instance, from the first one:<br><br><i>Neshomeh and Araeph have been a driving force in making things more strict - looking hard at SPG, requiring decent characters and a clear grasp of writing humour and the PPC. On the flip side, I&#39;ve been trying to make the process easier - people were having to ask repeatedly because their writing sample wasn&#39;t humour, for instance, so I&#39;ve worked us through several iterations of &#39;specific PPC writing sample&#39;. The Random Prompts are the current version of that - people were previously mostly writing their agents&#39; arrivals, and those all tend to come out the same.</i><br><br>hS</p>

            <p>What do you think caused that shift?<br><br>I know that I don&#39;t write fanfic because a lot of fanfic communities are too large and complex for me to figure out how to navigate, and because I&#39;m afraid of writing badfic. The PPC, on the other hand, is organized around one easy-to-use Board, where it&#39;s easy to have conversations and get to know people, and there&#39;s a well-established procedure where people will check to see if your writing&#39;s good and give you concrit. So based solely on my own experience, I&#39;d guess that it&#39;s because fan culture is starting to go mainstream, so a) communities are larger and more overwhelming, and b) more people are being exposed to the horrors of badfic, even people who aren&#39;t very far into their fandoms. Do other people&#39;s experiences match up with this?</p>

            <p>1/ In The Beginning, the older members of the Board were fanfic writers - Miss Cam, for instance, was famous for OFUM before the PPC was a thing. Nowadays, the oldest (= more aged) members of the Board are in large part people who&#39;ve been here for a long time. We <i>were</i> fanficcers, but by and large we <i>aren&#39;t</i> any more.<br><br>(I do actually still write fanfic; it&#39;s been a while since I posted anything, though.)<br><br>The same can be applied to the oldest (= longest-time-on-Board) members.

For a big chunk of time in the middle, TVTropes was the Board&#39;s primary source of new members. And TVTropes isn&#39;t a fanfic community, so the people coming in weren&#39;t fanficcers (mostly).<br><br>In the old days, we got our members through fanfiction.net, when people read PPC stories, or read OFUM and went to Miss Cam&#39;s website, or got reviewed by us.

            <p>Ship was nice, food was decent, company was good, stops were fabulous. <br>I did notice certain flaws in the ship&#39;s mechanics, especially relating to the airlock doors, like how they closed on me, and how a voice saying &#39;Release it, release it, quick, before he notices!&#39; went out of the speakers, before the space door ripped open and left me to be pulled out to space, and how my requests to be picked up were responded by nothing but a noise vaguely like a high-five, followed by complete silence, though I was prevented any major injury by the thankfully present extra-atmospheric safety suit. <br>All in all, pretty good.  <br>I&#39;d recommend the trip to some of my friends, but I&#39;ve calculated that I&#39;ll be somewhere around Theta Centauri by the time this review reaches earth, so it might be a while before they get the message. <br><br>Here&#39;s hoping that plutonium-238 holds out, eh? </p>

            <p>On the one hand, Ceres has Ceres Station, which is a big help - unless you bring enough transport space to get everyone back to Earth, we&#39;re going to need to hire something that&#39;s actually legal to fly inward of the belt.<br><br>On the other hand, take a look at the maps:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/CeresMap.jpg"><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_geological_features_on_Ceres">Ceres&#39; features</a> are named things like &#39;Tupo&#39; and &#39;Meanderi&#39;, a bunch of obscure harvest gods who no-one&#39;s ever heard of.

That looks <i>more</i> promising for finding something to talk about. Plus, there&#39;s rather more wilderness on Vesta.<br><br>On the other other hand, I&#39;m not too sure about taking PPCers somewhere called &#39;Saturnalia Fossa&#39;, and we could probably have a good time on Ceres without even leaving Bright Spot...<br><br>((OOC: I have a very good extrafictional reason for eventually picking Vesta.

            <p>They&#39;re all melancholy old men in love with younger men named Sebastian or a variant thereon (in order of obviousness of romantic connection: Twelfth Night, The Merchant of Venice (Bassanio is a nickname for Sebastian), and The Tempest).

            <p>I enjoyed the bit where the woman says &#39;You&#39;re rebellious and a loner.&#39; to the criminal/rogue. <br>P&#39;raps I&#39;m just an ugly, bad-natured wanker with dumb hair, compensating for various issues, but I feel like we could have gathered that from all the scenes of her rebelling against things, without the assistance of any companions. <br><br>Force Awakens was bloody good, and I won&#39;t be very surprised if this one ends up being bloody good as well, and while rebellious, morally twisted criminal types tend to be interesting characters, they can also get pretty odious, or at least annoying, if they&#39;re not handled well. As in, particularly odious and annoying. <br>Here&#39;s hoping she&#39;s handled well then, right? </p>

            <p>She was going to have a similar arc to Han Solo.  After all he was designed as a morally gray Anti-Hero who, while retaining his anti-heroic qualities, became a Hero.  <br><br>Either that or a similar arc to Mara Jade from the old Expanded Universe.

            <p>I was trying to think of the name of the female Rebellion politician but hS provided it, so that&#39;s good. This looks really neat! It seems like the weapons test is going to be the Death Star firing on Alderaan (so unfortunately, the Phineas and Ferb special where Perry the Platypus steals the Death Star plans is twice-uncanon, to everyone&#39;s great sadness*.) I also like the characterization Jyn so far - actually to me it feels like her gender is going to be more or less incidental to her character, like they set out to just write a strong rebellious character and not necessarily a female one?<br><br>Or I&#39;m reading way to much into a 2-minute trailer. <br><br><br>* (yes I know that that special was never canon.

            <p>I think this is a good time to be a <i>Star Wars</i> fan.<br><br>Some specific things I noticed:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/R1-01.jpg"><br><br>Literally the first thing I noted in the trailer was that helmet on the left. Hi there, Rebel Trooper! I have toys of you. ^<em>^ Oh, who&#39;s that with you, some kind of protagonist?<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/R1-02.jpg"><br><br>Heeeeey, that looks an awful lot like... it <i>is</i>! It&#39;s a Massassi Temple! We&#39;re on Yavin 4!<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/R1-03.jpg"><br><br>And just to prove it, that&#39;s some awfully familiar background clutt-<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/R1-04.jpg"><br><br><b><i>It&#39;s Mon Mothma!!!!!</i></b><br><br>That is so incredibly awesome. She&#39;s always been brilliant, and I&#39;m so pleased that they&#39;ve put her in this film. Squee. ^</em>^<br><br>(Apparently she&#39;s played, appropriately enough, by the actress who was young Mon Mothma in the prequels. What a world, what a world... how long before we see Ewan McGregor as Old Young Obi-Wan?)<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/R1-05.jpg"><br><br><b><i>It&#39;s a Star Destroyer!!!!!</i></b><br><br>Seriously, I missed these guys in <i>Force Awakens</i>. Sure, the First Order&#39;s barely-on-screen version is cool, but it doesn&#39;t have the same air of casual menace as the original.<br><br>I still have two model kits of these hanging around in my parents&#39; house.<br><br>And by &#39;hanging around&#39; I mean literally hanging from the ceiling.<br><br><font size="2">They&#39;re called the <i>Exultant</i> and the <i>Triumphant</i>. Don&#39;t judge me.</font><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/R1-06.jpg"><br><br>That is a very silly way to assemble a battlemoon. Also, I can&#39;t decide whether I want this or the previous shot as my new (workplace) desktop. (Oh, wait, I have a desktop random-cycler, I can have both. ^<em>^)<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/R1-07.jpg"><br><br>Heeeeey there orange flight suits! Stars, it&#39;s like the ending of <i>A New Hope</i> all over again, I&#39;m really impressed with how well they&#39;ve pulled this off.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/R1-08.jpg"><br><br>SUDDEN BRAIN STALL.<br><br>Is that...?<br><br>It can&#39;t be.<br><br>But it looks like...<br><br>Seriously, guys: is that... the uniform of an Imperial Grand Admiral?<br><br>I think they&#39;ve been renamed Fleet Admirals in the new continuity, but even so... is this Admiral Pseudo-Thrawn? Because I would dearly love to see the Empire with a military leader of the calibre, <b>on-screen</b>. It&#39;d be like having Sherlock Holmes as a villain - he&#39;d always be nine steps ahead of you.<br><br>(BBC Sherlock would make a fantastic Grand Admiral in the old mould. Almost makes me want to write it. Might have to do photomockup tonight.)<br><br>Oh, yeah, the trailer&#39;s still going. Blah characters, blah &#39;we want you to think she defects to the Imps even though this is clearly an infiltration mission&#39;, blah Grand Admiral Sherlock (sorry ^</em>^) walking through the water being cool, blah Mon Mothma <i>still in the movie squee</i>, blah- oh, hey, that&#39;s cool.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/R1-09.jpg"><br><br>AT-ATs! In an environment where they&#39;re not critically hindered by the snow. I hope this &#39;battle&#39; is one-sided enough to make it clear exactly <i>why</i> the Empire is the dominant power in the galaxy.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Conclusion: I apparently really like characters in white costumes. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Grand Admiral Pseudo Thrawn as well.  I just wish they really did use Thrawn.  I mean the look alone I think would really up the menace.  Something that is so familiar yet so alien add in the military genius and the cold, calculating nature I think that would be one of the most memorable villains ever.  Making him a human does not necessarily make him less memorable, but I would like to see some aliens with bigger roles.  <br><br>I also think in these side-stories it could set up a really nice dynamic between Young Ackbar and Thrawn.  They may still do that with Psuedo-Thrawn, but I would prefer real Thrawn.  The Chiss are long overdue for a canon appearance.</p>

            <p>That seems to let us know how knowledge of the Death Star was aquired by the Alliance in the new continuity. That would make for an interesing movie.<br><br>That also makes for an opportunity for more money while they producing Star Wars VIII. Let&#39;s see if it&#39;s worth losing Revan, Meetra Surik and Galen Marek. (Yes, The Old Republic was my favorite period for the Star Wars &#39;verse).</p>

            <p>Looking at the trailer I think the one major complaint I have is that everyone is still human or near enough to it with Chewie being the only major non-human in the films. I&#39;d like to see some of the different races involved, maybe some Bothans or even just the more common ones like Twi&#39;leks or Togruta or whatever. Besides that it looks good though.

            <p>So first of all, a request for beta&#39;s willing to look through a prelude involving my two agents Apollo and Kelly. <br><br>Second of all, I&#39;m looking for some beta readers from a mission I was co-writing with Herr Wozzeck back in February/March 2014. The reasoning is kind of (read very) weird, and basically goes like this: <br>Whilst working on the above-mentioned prelude I tried to access my old gmail account that had all of my PPC stuff, however I&#39;ve forgotten the password for it (and don&#39;t have it written down anywhere), never set up any extra contacts for it, and can&#39;t remember when I last logged onto it (the other requirement Google asks for if you&#39;re trying to access an account whose password you can&#39;t remember). As I have none of the required pieces of information I&#39;m stuck with no way of accessing three half-written missions, and the co-write with Herr Wozzeck. The half-written missions I can deal with, the co-write was quite a nice piece that I&#39;d rather saw the light of day, it was also a lot nearer completion, we&#39;d definitely asked for one round of beta&#39;s and were going to work on the comments before Herr Wozzeck disappeared (for want of a better word). The reason I&#39;m asking for the beta&#39;s is so that I can find the mission, copy it from the Gdoc its currently in to at least one other place and potentially try and finish it off. I believe the Irish Samurai was one of the beta&#39;s and I&#39;m fairly certain we had two or three but I can&#39;t remember who the others were. If people could help that&#39;d be great. <br><br>Storme Hawk<br></p>

            <p>The title of the badfic is &#39;A Speculation of Reality and Truth&#39;, I can&#39;t remember what we called the mission though. It&#39;s a Merlin/The Avengers/A:TLA/Supernatural/Doctor Who/Sherlock/X-Men crossover, but I believe we only dealt with the Doctor Who, A:TLA and X-Men parts.

            <p>Yeah, I was more letting people know of my situation with my old gamil than asking for ways to fix it (I don&#39;t think I can). Thanks for the offer of beta-ing, can I have an email to send the link to? I&#39;m not too fussy on time scale at the moment, I&#39;m just about to start my final term as an undergraduate so things are getting quite busy for me too.  </p>

            <p>Yes, the traditional, polite way of answering the phone is saying [last name], so that the caller knows that he didn’t dial a wrong number (children living with their parents should say [first name, last name] to clarify that they aren’t the parent). <br><br>I still have this habit from when I was young (that’d be last century’s sixties).<br><br>But in more modern times many Germans became wary of telling their name to strangers who might just have dialed a random number to hear what they would get, so it became quite common to just hear  “<i>Hallo</i>” or  “<i>Ja</i>”.<br><br>Business rules, of course, are different.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Nothing more than a &#39;hello&#39; or &#39;good morning/good afternoon&#39; is usually necessary here in the UK.

            <p>The reason is actually a kind of stupid story, but if you&#39;re interested:<br><br>My first fandom online was Tokimeki Memorial: Girl&#39;s Side, which is a Japanese dating game series. The one I played first had a character called Himuro Reiichi, who was a teacher, but his students nicknamed him Himurrochi. I double nicknamed him &#39;Himochi&#39; by cutting the middle bit out, and put &#39;is awesome&#39; at the end, because he was my favourite character, and I was a dumb internet newbie.<br><br>I&#39;d honestly change the name now since I&#39;m not in that fandom and it being Japanese while I&#39;m not is maybe a little dodgy? But it&#39;s been my name for so long online that it&#39;s kinda stuck, and most people know me as Mochi online now (or Mocha). So it might be confusing to try and swap to something else. The only thing I&#39;m not Himochi/HimochiIsAwesome/AwesomeHimochi on would be Tumblr, and that&#39;s only because I grabbed a canon URL.<br><br>Hopefully nobody finds it offensive or anything since it&#39;s maybe slightly weeby? I don&#39;t know. But I mean no offence, and if it annoys people I can just rename myself on here to something less dumb. :P</p>

            <p>But if you&#39;re actually curious about my username, it was my username back on Neopets. Long story short, I originally wanted it to be son<em>of</em>heaven, but someone already took it, so Neopets suggested adding on the &quot;176&quot;. I took that option, and the username stuck.

            <p>I did mention the origin of my username before, but it seems that that post is no longer avaiable. So here&#39;s the explanation again: I was looking for a username that reflected my Christian faith. Though as Christians, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+4%3A4-7&amp;version=NIV">we are sons of God</a>, &quot;son<em>of</em>god&quot; is obviously out, given that the title, without more, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+1%3A1&amp;version=NIV">refers to Jesus</a>. So I decided on &quot;son<em>of</em>heaven&quot; instead. <br><br>And I already explained to Scapegrace how the 176 got tacked onto the end.<br></p>

            <p>I know quite a few people who don&#39;t answer the telephone like that, but my parents (and my sister) still do when they&#39;re not expecting the call.

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>First off, a huge thank you to everyone who allowed me to dissect their photos two weeks ago. I loved the pictures and was pleased to see everyone pitching in with their own opinions. Reading others&#39; deductions was one of my favourite parts, just to see how my conclusions compared with the rest of the community. I will readily admit to grinning like a fool when I saw all the responses. <br><br>Due to the unexpected popularity of this thread and the many events that my own schedule was crammed with, I was unable to complete all the deductions in the first thread. I wanted to post this on Donnerstag, but was disappointed that not all deductions were finished. Most are completed now, and I&#39;m also quite pleased to say that I&#39;ve found a D-Day for &#39;Sunday.&#39; Desdendelle and hS will have the finished deductions based on their pictures uploaded by Dienstag (Tuesday). <br><br>As in the title of the post, it is Dimanche, which is French. For Part One, all the finished deductions are below. Deduction Dimanche will continue as normal, and I&#39;m excited to see this thread-train* continue!<br><br><b>Part One</b><br><br>Deductions are placed in chronological order. The first person to submit material is on the top of the list, and so on. Here goes: <br><br><u>Neshomeh</u><br><br><b>Handwriting</b><br><br>-You said that you don&#39;t often handwrite your missions, and this is lined paper. I peeked at your Wiki page (nope, not cheating, that&#39;s using my resources) and saw that you have a degree in English, leading me to a tentative conclusion that you may be a teacher. <br>-If not, this may have been done in a journal. <br>-The fact that you don&#39;t often handwrite missions, yet this was on lined paper/a journal page, makes me wonder if you were not at home when this was being written.<br>-This appears to be a Bad Slash mission in the Harry Potter continuum. <br>-The style of the writing leans more towards introverted, though the balance between introvert/extrovert is rather close, about 60/40. <br>-Your &quot;Gs,&quot; and &quot;Ys&quot; have little tails on then, implying that you may have learned cursive a while ago, but don&#39;t use it often. <br>-This one was tricky, but I believe you are right handed. <br><br><b>Desk</b><br><br>-Bath and Body Works lotion implies that you are somewhere in the US or Canada. <br>-Crossword puzzle lap desk - you&#39;ve recently eaten a meal at your desk, as the napkin is still there. <br>-Your desk is in your bedroom, which is where the photos were taken.<br>-The quality of the pictures tells me that they were taken on a phone. <br>-You enjoy board games, and perhaps comics as well. <br>-X-ACTO brand pencil sharpener, along with some markers I see poking out underneath the lap desk, signals an interest in art. The pencil sharpener also leads me closer to the conclusion of &quot;teacher,&quot; but I&#39;m still unsure. <br>-Almost definitely right handed, as I&#39;ve stated above.<br>-I am nearly sure that you have an Instagram account, as there appears to be an icon for the website on your computer, but it&#39;s rather blurry. <br>-The electrical sockets, though fuzzy, also support that you&#39;re in the US or Canada.<br>-You and/or Phobos enjoy video games, and there&#39;s a television that is not pictured here. <br>-Many papers, some typed, some not, as well as a lunchbox, push me again towards your being a teacher. <br>-Your cat can be rather misbehaved at times. (They&#39;re adorable, by the way.) <br>-Was there a recent birthday? <br><br><b>Hands</b><br><br>-I was correct, and you are right handed! <br>-The paper appears to be sketch paper; you enjoy art. <br>-You&#39;re married. <br>-Your fingernails are short, but you aren&#39;t a nail biter.<br>-You don&#39;t work with your hands too often, and your job doesn&#39;t require any flashy sort of persona.<br>-Jewellery is small, most likely a gift. You&#39;re practical, on the whole, and not one to over indulge.<br>-You also spend a quite a bit of time on the computer, for reasons I am unsure of.<br><br><b>Final Notes:</b> These were tough, but a great deal of fun. If you aren&#39;t a teacher I will be sorely disappointed. Anyway, many thanks for letting me take a look at so much material!! It was fantastic. :)<br><br><u>Phobos</u><br><br>-Right handed.<br>-You&#39;re an introvert, and male. (I&#39;ve found that introverted-ness is common among Boarders. Hm.) <br>-This was done in a journal, where you have written more (presumably of this story, but most likely others as well.) <br>-Moderately organised, but not impeccably so.<br>-You may come off as calm, and quiet to outsiders, though clearly you&#39;re very imaginative. <br>-The story was thought out before you wrote it down. <br>-You write on computers more often than not. <br><br><b>Final Notes:</b> Handwriting yields very little, though the content was really intriguing. Will there be any time we&#39;re allowed to see this story in its full glory? <br><br><u>Iximaz</u><br><br>-You&#39;re an American Apple-device user, judging by electric sockets and chargers plugged in the wall.<br>-Aside from the very clear interest in Harry Potter, you enjoy fantasy as a genre. <br>-My Little Pony suggests that you may have a sister (or brother, though sister is more likely due to the fact that these products are marketed towards girls), but this isn&#39;t necessarily true as you&#39;ve written missions in the MLP continuum.<br>-The pictures were taken from your iPhone, which is why I can&#39;t zoom in as much as I like and these deductions may fall short. Oh well, I tried. :) <br>-Is that an eReader I see? It appears to be a Nook, and still on. This, among other things, suggests that you may forgetful at times. <br>-You bite/pick your nails, but only sometimes. Possibly due to anxiety, but boredom is another motivator. <br>-The scar on your hand was not self inflicted, due to your right handedness, but probably created by a blade. <br>-The ring was a gift. <br>-You&#39;re most likely in high school, though you may be in college. However, you&#39;re definitely some form of student.<br>-You&#39;re sentimental, and have a hard time throwing things away. Inanimate objects will take on meanings that you don&#39;t want to give up. <br>-You enjoy art, and drawing.<br>-A whovian, but I already knew that. <br>-Your time zone is the same as Board time, which I believe is Eastern Standard Time.<br>-I believe that the spools of string on your nightstand were the results of your latest cosplay.<br>-Did you ever listen to MCR? <br><br><b>Final Notes:</b> That was fabulous! Quite a challenge, and I&#39;m unsure of what else I could wrangle from those pictures. Many thanks for giving me your pictures in the name of science! <br><br><b>Part Two</b> <br><br>This week, I&#39;ll be calling out a deductionist on another platform of social media. On Instagram, <a href="04a%3Fuser_id=16.html">@that<em>one</em>deductionist</a> is a fabulous blog that provides deductions in the real world. The owner deduces her classmates, friends, and perfect strangers in a very interesting style. The account has more than just deductions, so if one is only looking for the work, she has a tag called <a href="04a%3Fuser_id=16.html">#deductionsgalore.</a> <br><br>As for <b>Part Three...</b> You know what to do. <br><br>-Vee <br><br>*I&#39;m unsure as to what to call a running stream of threads such as this, or Wednesday Pluggage, or so on. A thread-train is a working title to describe such a phenomenon. What do you think of it?<br><br><b>Links:</b> Just in case the links embedded in the text don&#39;t work, here they are, plain and simple: <br><br>@that<em>one</em>deductionist on Instagram - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/that_one_deductionist"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/that_one_deductionist">https://www.instagram.com/that_one_deductionist</a></a><br>@that<em>one</em>deductionist&#39;s tag - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/deductionsgalore/"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/deductionsgalore/">https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/deductionsgalore/</a></a><br><br><br></p>

            <p>Point by point:<br><br><u>Handwriting</u><br><br>- Why does everyone think English degree == teacher? Nope, I&#39;m not. Not even a little bit.<br>- I&#39;m writing in a notebook that Phobos brought home from work. I&#39;ve never had a serious journal (despite the best efforts of many people throughout my childhood).<br>- You&#39;re correct that I&#39;m doing most of my writing on this one away from home. I&#39;m on a self-imposed deadline, so I&#39;ve been getting in some writing when it&#39;s slow at work.<br>- Yup, it certainly is that.<br>- That&#39;s interesting. I would definitely describe myself as introverted, and every personality test I&#39;ve ever taken agrees with me. What points toward extroverted?<br>- Yup, learned cursive in elementary school. I only really use it to sign my name now.<br>- Yep! I thought that might be tricky, since I hold my pen like a lefty. What pointed you toward right-handed (besides the photos of my hands)?<br><br><u>Desk</u><br><br>- I&#39;m impressed that you identified that just from the shape of the bottle. Are you a fan of their products yourself?<br>- Yup, that&#39;s correct.<br>- Heh, no. Try again. {= )<br>- Yep, I used my phone.<br>- Both correct, though as far as comics go, it&#39;s mostly that I enjoy a good story in any medium. There aren&#39;t any comics in the photos, either, so not sure where that&#39;s coming from.<br>- You&#39;re correct that I enjoy art, but you&#39;re wrong about a few things in the picture. One, <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Boston-Electric-Pencil-Sharpener-Model-21-Hunt-Mfg-USA-Tested-Works-Great-/301923388122">this</a> is the same model as my pencil sharpener. Two, those are colored pencils, not markers. (And don&#39;t you feel silly now? ^<em>~ ) Three, still not a teacher.<br>- Dang, and I was sure that keeping my tea mug on the left would throw you off. {= ) (No comment on the Quirk logo, though?)<br>- Nope to Instagram. Visible on my laptop screen from left to right, starting at the top, are Firefox tabs for Gmail, Google Docs, the Board, and Google Drive. Along the bottom, there&#39;s a shell icon for the Classic Start Menu application for Windows 8, a Toshiba icon, a Windows Store icon, and tabs for My Documents (probably my PPC folder), Firefox, and two for OpenOffice Writer.<br>- I don&#39;t think any wall sockets are actually visible.<br>- Correct about the video games—one of us particularly enjoys them and the other plays sometimes. Can you tell which is which? {= ) The television is pictured in Photo 2, in fact, though it&#39;s mostly obscured.<br>- Correct about the papers. Among other things, my notebook is pictured, and so is a partial printout of the badfic I&#39;m sporking. But, that&#39;s not a lunchbox, it&#39;s a camera case. And I&#39;m still not a teacher. ^</em>~<br>- It&#39;s true, sometimes Merlin needs to be reminded that biting is not an acceptable form of communication. I don&#39;t often have to squirt him with the water bottle, though—just pointing it at him and sometimes sloshing the water a bit usually does the trick. He&#39;s a he, and thanks. ^_^<br>- The most recent birthday was March 2, but there&#39;s nothing in any of the photos related to that.<br><br><u>Hands</u><br><br>- Yep!<br>- Paper? What paper? {= )<br>- That one&#39;s kind of a gimme, since you already looked at my user page.<br>- Correct, I&#39;ve never been a nail-biter.<br>- I do a fair bit with my hands, but no hard labor, that&#39;s true. If you look closely, you can see a few of my scars, especially the one on the first knuckle of my right index finger. I&#39;d love to see you (or anyone) try to figure out how I got that!<br>- Very true. Full marks for this one.<br>- Also very true, but I&#39;ll have to dock some points for guessing.<br><br>And despite the grading language I&#39;ve fallen into, I continue not to be a teacher. Sorry. {= ) Pretty good overall, though!<br><br>Thanks for doing this; it&#39;s fun. I kinda wish I hadn&#39;t thrown everything at you all at once. It would have been interesting to see what you&#39;d do with each new piece over time.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. Still not king. If he tries anything, Sam will kill him. Name that reference!</p>

            <p>Though I sincerely wish I was. <br><br>The introverted/extroverted writing type can often be found in the size, neatness, legibility, and darkness of the pencil or pen lines. A lot of extroverts that I know have larger, neater handwriting that&#39;s &quot;showy&quot; and catches the eye. I (introvert) have smaller and more cramped handwriting that is, to put it bluntly, less pretty. It&#39;s something that I&#39;ve found holds mainly true, even after looking at many different handwriting samples. <br><br>Of course, there are exceptions. It may be harder to tell the difference when the handwriting is small and neat, where it appears that the person writing it took their time to make it pleasing to look at. <br><br>Did that make any sense? If not, I can attempt to explain further. :)<br><br>-Vee</p>

            <p>Left handed people have, or so I&#39;ve been told, a tendency to hook the hand so that the hand holding the pencil is above the line currently being written, rather than level with the line.

            <p>And a little eyebrow-raising. You stalker. :P<br><br>-Yes.<br>-Fantasy is indeed my favorite.<br>-No sister, though my brother is just as avid a brony as I am.<br>-Got it again, and I apologize for the poor quality. ^^;<br>-I do in fact have a Nook, but it wasn&#39;t in either of the pictures. I&#39;m guessing you saw the light reflecting off a picture frame. (As for forgetfulness, guilty as charged, but that seems to be more a lucky guess since the reasoning behind it was based on a faulty premise.)<br>-Combination of both, actually.<br>-If you mean the mark over my right index knuckle, I actually bite it quite often while thinking. Not a scar, merely an indent left by my teeth. Though I do have a scar on my right middle finger from when I shut it in a locker on accident. It&#39;s very faint though, so you can&#39;t see it in the picture.<br>-It was indeed a gift, one from my dad. Was this a guess, or did you infer it from something else?<br>-Currently in college, but my room hasn&#39;t changed much in the past seven years aside from adding more stuff to the walls as I acquire it.<br>-Guilty as charged. I don&#39;t like to throw away anything, especially if it was inherited.<br>-I like it, but I&#39;m not very good at it. If I&#39;d taken a picture of those up-close you&#39;d be able to tell they were pretty poor in quality. (Though in my defense, I was fourteen at the time.)<br>-But of course. :P<br>-Yes again.<br>-Actually, nope! Like I said, I&#39;m forgetful—the spools are from when I sewed some patches onto my jacket. Several months back. &gt;.&gt;<br>-I don&#39;t believe I have. Why?<br><br><br>So... all in all, looks like you got 10/14 right.

            <p>Reactions to deductions are always fun. Here&#39;s the thought process behind the ring. <br><br>-You weren&#39;t wearing any other jewellery in the picture - no bracelets, etc. <br>-There was no jewellery on your nightstand, such as a necklace, or something that you&#39;d already have taken off late at night. <br>-Your nails are bare, which suggests that you&#39;re more for practicality than vanity. (Your handwriting sample also helped in that regard). <br>-I also was able to tell that you&#39;re sentimental, and put the pieces together from there. A practical, sentimental person who doesn&#39;t wear much jewellery would probably only wear such a ring if it was a gift from someone that you care about. <br><br>A combination of the above was what lead me to the five-word conclusion, so I&#39;m going to take a moment to point out something about <i>Sherlock.</i><br><br>Deductions don&#39;t actually work the way that they&#39;re portrayed. As said by our protagonist, &quot;Once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be true.&quot; <br><br>It takes me anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour to make all the deductions for any single picture. This is from repeatedly zooming in and out on the photograph, and taking careful notes. The distance that Sherlock makes his deductions from is nearly impossible - we, as the audience, can only see what he means when the camera is up close on the subject/victim. <br><br>He makes conclusions based on only one piece of evidence - something that, unless it&#39;s incredibly obvious, such as a left-handed man committing suicide with his right hand - which is, in the real world, wrong 9 times out of 10.<br><br>Theory: Sherlock Holmes has robot eyes. <br><br>Just wanted to throw that out there, and my apologies for getting so sidetracked. :p<br><br>-Vee</p>

If you&#39;re running a GX-era (or, gods forbid, original series-era) deck, chances are you&#39;ll get OTKed left, right and centre.

            <p>Although from the looks of it at least Relinquished is still decent (yeah, almost all my cards are from the original series-era). I think my Beast deck would be the only one that could stand any sort of chance (it can severly limit what you can put on the field quite easily, and then easily destroy what you can put on the field), although seeing as no-one I know plays Yu-Gi-Oh I doubt I&#39;ll ever have a chance to find out. <br><br>Still, it makes me feel quite old with all this new stuff now out. </p>

I also have what&#39;s still my favourite card bar none (despite its crappy effect) — &quot;Gearfried the Iron Knight&quot; (Common).<br>IIRC, I had Starter Deck: Joey, Starter Deck: Pegasus, and the Zombie Madness and Spellcaster&#39;s Judgement structure decks.

            <p>My deck is based upon the World of the Zombies structure deck, but here again, my brothers got te lion&#39;s share of cards. One of them combined Spellcaster&#39;s Judgement and Spellcaster&#39;s Command for a super Spellcaster deck. I still got a decent Lightsworn deck, but it still remain far from perfection. In the past I even had a VWXYZ deck, complete with all the fusions possible, But it&#39;s buried with other stuff now.<br><br>Speaking of Gearfried, what do you think of its Swordmaster version?</p>

            <p>I&#39;d slipped back into thinking that your slot in the loser&#39;s bracket was determined by what battle you lost, not by when you lost it.

            <p>You responded that Wednesdays from 7pm your time was best, I waited for two to three hours on last Wednesday and I didn&#39;t see you, and I&#39;ve said about doing it this Wednesday instead, neither time have you replied. I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t been on the last couple of nights but I&#39;ve been spending them with some friends who I haven&#39;t seen for a few months and probably won&#39;t see again for a month or two.

            <p>Odd. I got on around 7 pm my time, and waited for several hours as well, and not only did I not see an &quot;ihavenoinsurace&quot;, the people in the writing and tournament channels said you&#39;d been in but left earlier, so maybe our timing was off.<br><br>I can do today any time, or literally any Wednesday after 11 PM GMT.
