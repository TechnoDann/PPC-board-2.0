            <p>So, I&#39;ve been a huge fan of the PPC for over a year now, and I&#39;ve worked up enough courage to finally say something. I love you guys. PPC sporking adventures are literally the funniest-yet-sometimes-serious and weirdly absorbing stuff ever, and even though I&#39;ll never be able to write stuff with you guys because I&#39;ll lose interest and come back to it in a year like all my other attempts at writing, I will always be an avid fan! Thanks for keeping the multiverse safe! :D</p>

            <p>That&#39;s a hard question to answer! I guess I&#39;d have to go with The Aviator, as she&#39;s done a few missions in the Ranger&#39;s Apprentice continuum (I love that series!). I appreciate her taste in fine literature. :D</p>

            <p>Also, don&#39;t worry about losing interest/impetus to work on a piece of PPC writing. I&#39;ve had a mission on the go since February 2015 - and it&#39;s finally nearly finished. So, yeah. If you want to write, write; don&#39;t worry about when it&#39;s finished, just worry about it being good. Lord knows I do. =]</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll definitely keep that in mind! I might actually be involved in the mission-writing brouhaha in the future, as I introduced one of my friends to this wonderful place on the web.

            <p>Your powers of survival are both wondrous and terrible in these dark and vicious times! We salute the man who grows old in a world where men die. . . Well, at all, really. Survival&#39;s not something to be sneezed at, y&#39;know, especially since by the age of thir- er, 29, of course :)- your nose must be a Death Star among olfactory receptors.<br><br> I&#39;m frankly <i>slightly</i> jealous, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get there in the end. Just don&#39;t let any X-Wings fly up a nostril in the mean time and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll hit thirty with no issues whatsoever, or &quot;tissues,&quot; even, though that one&#39;s a little on the nose even for me. <br><br>Perhaps I should post the a-bridge-d version... Oh, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be fine. <br><br>Oh! And, Happy Birthday!</p>

            <p>(This post is not sponsored by LootCrate; if it was, I&#39;d have money. But I don&#39;t...)<br><br><br>So, a month ago, out of curiosity, I went and looked at LootCrate, to see if there are any fun crates for me to buy... and I immediately clicked &quot;Buy&quot; to get me this one. But, let&#39;s start from the beginning.<br><br><u>What is LootCrate?</u><br><i>LootCrate</i> is a monthly subscription box of geek &amp; gaming goodies delivered to your home. Every month you only get a theme announced, with only knowledge being what franchises will be featured in the Crate. Last year, I bought an October 2015 Crate - &quot;Time&quot; - which featured a sweet <i>Doctor Who</i>-licensed <a href="http://pm1.narvii.com/5900/a71945d9bb65da4866e27c0ef182d8177ef8ef7c_hq.jpg">Sonic Spork</a>.<br>So, what could&#39;ve interest me so much, to return to <i>LootCrate</i> after a year? What&#39;s November&#39;s Theme?<br><br><b>MAGIC</b><br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Well, is anyone surprised? So, without further ado, let&#39;s begin the unboxing! We&#39;re doin&#39; it live!<br><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Kap3q9J.jpg" width="300"> <br><br>Hello, little Crate. Reveal your secrets to me!<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DrhFNwO.jpg" width="300"><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DV7Gfjd.jpg" width="300"><br><br>In a cat-like manner, it&#39;s not the contents that interests me first, but the box itself. And this month we&#39;ve got a... potions shelf?<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/thThpyv.jpg" width="500"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6338Uym.jpg" width="300"><br><br>First off, we&#39;ve got a <i>LootCrate</i> Exclusive item - Doctor Strange Q-Fig!<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qD6Lb9B.jpg" width="300"> <br><br>Obligatory <i>LootCrate</i> Pin. This month - Elder Scrolls, and it apprently unlocks something cool in <i>The Elder Scrolls Online</i>.

            <p>So, I got to thinking: Say Mr. Johnson wanted to see what would happen if a turret&#39;s emotional inhibitor were removed. Because why not, right? But what do you think would happen if this now emotionized turret were told to shoot a test subject or intruder? Would they shut down, realizing that now they can&#39;t kill whatsoever (like the 2010 Cybermen), or do you think they could be reprogrammed a little to shoot as long as they believed they weren&#39;t shooting a living being? I do believe that turrets can have personalities, but I&#39;m not sure how the inhibitor would affect this.</p>

            <p>If the average turret doesn&#39;t see a threat it&#39;s in a standby state and is motionless. <br>However there are Defective Turrets in Portal 2.

            <p>...would they turn into a Defective version, or would they shut down realizing they can&#39;t kill without seeing their target as a living being, since their empathy generator would have full control? Or could there be a way to work around it?</p>

            <p><s>Red fic, blue fic.</s><br><br>I shared all this with the chat, and I thought I ought not deprive the Board. So, I recently got into <i>Supernatural</i> (just started season 3, no spoilers plz), and so naturally I went trolling for fanfic, like you do. I&#39;ve found one quite good one and one mind-bendingly bad one, which Iximaz may or may not be claiming, I&#39;m not sure.<br><br>Good news first:<br><br>&quot;<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3223802/1/Bad-Fairy">Bad Fairy</a>&quot; by vanillafluffy, rated T. <i>Supernatural</i> x <i>House, M.D.</i> x <i>The Burning Zone</i><br><b>Summary:</b> Halloween, 1989. Sam&#39;s sudden illness may have been caused by the demon John is tracking. A young doctor named House thinks otherwise. SPN House MD crossover.<br><b>Why I Like It:</b> Young!House, baby!Winchesters, and good medical jargon. It&#39;s a fun read, and I was sad when it ended.<br><br>Now the bad news:<br><br>&quot;<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2826853/1/Tangled">Tangled</a>&quot; by claudia1, rated M. <i>Supernatural</i> x <i>Junior</i><br><b>Summary:</b> After a curse and a night of sex with his brother Dean falls pregnant. Only Sam doesn&#39;t remember that night or the curse. currently being re-written. chapters 1-18 rewritten, beta&#39;d. Chapter seven and sixteen is new. mpreg.<br><b>Why It&#39;s Awful:</b> Wincest and MPreg, both poorly justified; logic with holes you could drive a truck through; godawful SPaG, especially after the beta&#39;d chapters; angsty!stereotypical-pregnant-woman!Dean and everybody else OOC, too. For instance, Dean actually tells Arbogast and Heese about the existence of the supernatural <i>and</i> his relationship with his brother, and they just calmly accept all of it. I think Iximaz commented at one point that Sam was so far from in character that he might as well be on the starship <i>Enterprise</i> with Draco from &quot;My Immortal.&quot; Unless she was talking about John, our Designated Willfully Ignorant Bastard <i>du</i> fic. Either way. Oh, and a special alas and alack for poor &quot;Booby&quot; Singer, our Unrealistically Encouraging Pillock <i>du</i> fic.<br><br>So yeah, have fun with those, and of course feel free to share anything you&#39;ve run across lately, good or bad. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11512609/1/Britannia">Britannia </a> (Has a mature warning)- &quot;Britannia is a country three times the size of Texas between America and England in the Atlantic. She and America were both found by Britain about the same time and have many similarities; making them best friends. However, what will happen when she starts to develop feelings for the American over the years? Pairings: America x OC Country and more throughout&quot; <br><br>a 56 chapter hetalia fanfic(only 38 chapters towards the main mary sue the rest are for poorly defined state ocs) About an Island nation that is meant to be 3 times the size of Texas in between America and England in the ocean.  When the distance between the two nations is about 4,242 mi/6826.837km. Texas&#39;s size is about 268,597 mi² or 695663.036km.  So basically there is more of a chance the oc ends up connecting the two together and swallowing up a lot of the  North Atlantic Islands instead of just being an Island nation. <br><br>The oc basically is a copy of Arthur in looks and Alfred in personality. But that&#39;s not even the worst. This fanfic includes things like: <br><br>-Incest between the canon Alfred(representing America) and the oc who is raised as his sibling. <br>-The oc takes a canon&#39;s name (Britannia is the name of England,Ireland,Wales,Scotland,and North Ireland&#39;s mother whose implied to have died)  <br>- The oc attempting to show how morally right she is when it comes to slavery only to shove them back onto the ship with no supplies or even checking if they are okay to travel. <br>- cw: rape The mary sue lets Alfred get pulled away by Greece(whose reduced to two character traits) while she thinks Greece is going to rape someone. And does nothing to help her brother/guy she loves while eating cake hoping that wasn&#39;t his first time.  It turns out Greece meant sleeping as in taking a nap.  <br>- She has her people completely listen to her minus the Designated Bastards both Misogynistic and classic <br>- Somehow has perfect hair all the time and Emerald eyes. <br>- The grass in the sue nation glows. <br>- The mary sue enters wars her country isn&#39;t fighting and is somehow a perfect spy<br>- Ignores historical and canon relationships in time periods. <br>- Changes history only when it benefits the sue or makes the sue look good.  And flat out ignores some parts. <br>- Claims a vote was a tie when it was said a few sentences earlier the vote was only close but not a tie. And somehow is the tie breaker despite the fact nations don&#39;t do that. <br>-  All the ocs that are made by the creator exist to support the sue or the author&#39;s world view. <br>- So many canons are OOC to the point there are at least two replacements. <br>- The sue copies the USA government exactly for her government. Down to even using the dollar. <br>- mary sue claiming Nations can basically. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8348744/2/The-secret-and-the-Slytherin">The secret and the Slytherin </a> -Trapped in her time Kagome is sent to live with her father.

And somehow Kagome,whose fully Japanese,is the daughter of Lucius whose white.   <br>Includes: <br>-Kagome somehow always having known her real father was Lucius.<br>- Draco instantly accepting her<br>- A wand being made out of a demon fang being given to replacement Kagome. <br>- A Tattoo turns into a Demon wolf when Voldemort tries to give her the dark mark <br><br><a href="http://appasmomo.deviantart.com/art/Gasm-Heard-Round-the-World-1-204422710">Gasm Heard Round the World</a> (NSFW VERY NSFW.

            <p>Hello all Protectors,<br><br>I would like to join the PPC. I&#39;ve arranged with my older brother (who doesn&#39;t yet have an account here) to be partners - unless this is a breach of conduct, I would love to work with him. I... don&#39;t really know what all I&#39;m supposed to put here. Hi?<br><br>Introductions... I&#39;m too paranoid to give you my real name - runs in the family, so my brother won&#39;t either - so call me Calliope, or C. That&#39;s one of my favourite alternates, because Calliope was the Greek muse of epic stories. I&#39;m sixteen, female (like you couldn&#39;t already tell), and American - no, I&#39;m not British, I was just raised by a Brit Lit teacher. I have a large number of fandoms, so I&#39;ll accept missions in many of those; speaking of, I would like to be part of the Department of Floaters, as would my brother.<br><br>If you have questions, asking is fine. I&#39;ll hear from some of you, maybe?<br><br>--Calliope</p>

Once you&#39;ve introduced yourself, feel free to roam about, comment in any of the threads, start a thread if you&#39;ve found anything that might be of interest, hang out in the live chat -- whatever you like!<br><br>There are a <i>lot</i> of requirements for Permission to write PPC missions, but the most important of those is that you must first be a well-established member of the community. So don&#39;t worry about it! Just, please, get to know us, read stories, poke around on the wiki, watch a few people go through the Permission-getting process (if your brother wants to write PPC stories too, he should pick a name and do the same)(if you&#39;re having trouble with anything technical, allow me to point you to this handy <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_The_Board">FAQ</a>). <br><br>*sings* <i>Relax. . . take it eeee-eeeeeasyyyyy. . .</i><br><br>One of our customs which you will get to know very well (if you decide you like us, of course.

            <p>Blue is one of my favorite colors too. When I was approximately six, I wouldn&#39;t let my sister say that blue was her favorite color, I was so possessive of it (don&#39;t worry; I&#39;ve mellowed a bit with age. You can have some blue too). Is blue a favorite for any particular reason?

As I&#39;ve said, we&#39;re more of a community with writers than writers with a community. These gifts are our way of starting first conversations. Please, ask us questions about them, or describe what you&#39;re going to do with them (like it or not, all this stuff has landed in your virtual lap!). That&#39;s how I got to be friends with Larfen: he yelled in my ear and gave me bandages, and we filled a thread with writing back and forth about the consequences. He&#39;s one of my favorite people ^.^ If I hadn&#39;t replied to his posts, we might not have started talking, and that would be sad.<br><br>--Key is a very chatty person.

            <p>Greetings again,<br><br>I have continued to read the pre-introduction reading materials and now know how much I failed at a PPC introduction. Let me fill in the blanks:<br><br>--I am currently working through the Original Series and will read the Constitution and Permission things, and I am working via the FAQ format.<br><br>--Fandoms - so many. The most prominent at the moment are Homestuck, Hetalia: Axis Powers, and Gravity Falls - but there are many more, and my brother is part of none of those. We do share some other fandoms, however, such as Harry Potter, Rise of the Guardians, and Overwatch.<br><br>--I found the PPC via TVTropes.<br><br>--The only Agents I know so far are Acacia and Jay, so they are kind of my favourites by default.<br><br>--I&#39;m an avid reader, gamer, and daydreamer. I am also (futilely) attempting to learn how art works. Especially drawing.<br><br>Regards,<br>Calliope</p>

Upon the holder hitting an opponent with a contact move, any Pokémon on that side of the field get hit by a Rotten Brain attack (70BP, Poison-type, Physical category) using the holder&#39;s Attack stat for the next 7 turns before being returned to the user. Now, there are obviously ways to ameliorate this or ignore it entirely, but Seviper&#39;s a &#39;mon that can make sterling use of it. Grab an Adamant one and Super Train it in Attack and Speed. The ability Infiltrator is also helpful, since your Rotten Brain will now ignore Light Screen, Reflect, and Aurora Veil. Now you give it Swords Dance, Aqua Tail, Sucker Punch, and Earthquake - since you get STAB from your Rotten Brain, you don&#39;t need to run it, and can instead run a boosting move. Most importantly, though: have fun. =]</p>

            <p>From what I&#39;ve been hearing, Genji&#39;s name is possibly a shoutout to non other than Hikaru Genji, the protagonist of the first known novel in the word, and Hanzo was possibly named after Hattori Hanzou Masanori, who was a famous vassal of Tokugawa Ieyasu and the leader of the Iga ninja clan.<br><br>Going on this, it is possible to find the Kanji used for their names, and therefore their meanings:<br>1) Genji is 源氏. The first Kanji stands for &quot;origin&quot;, while the second stands for &quot;clan&quot;, so it roughly means &quot;original clan&quot;. You can alternatively read it as &quot;Minamoto clan&quot;.<br>2) Hanzou is 半蔵. The first Kanji stands for &quot;half&quot; (it&#39;s the same one you use to denote half-hours), while the second stands for &quot;own, possess&quot; but also &quot;hide&quot;. I&#39;d imagine &quot;half-hidden&quot; or &quot;half-owned&quot; might work.</p>

            <p>There is a word for &quot;originate,&quot; but not &quot;original,&quot; and it doesn&#39;t blend well with &quot;nossë&quot; for clan, so we&#39;re gonna substitute &quot;original&quot; for &quot;first.&quot; This gives us <b>Minyanossë</b> for Genji.<br><br>Looking back, hS was definitely correct: I should have used <i>perta</i> for half. There are several words glossed as &quot;hidden.&quot; <i>Muina,</i> &quot;secret,&quot; works the best, which gives us <b>Pertamuina,</b> half secret.

            <p>I like the names - I admit I don&#39;t know the first thing about Overwatch, but I like the names in and of themselves. Alassiel springs out as a good one, as do Anórië, Ondolassë, Venehtar (as a nice bilingual reference to &#39;Venator&#39;, &quot;hunter&quot;)... like I said, I like them. There&#39;s a couple that use dodgy definitions (I&#39;ve discussed &#39;pitya&#39; elsewhere), and I&#39;m almost certain &#39;Perefea&#39; should be &#39;Pertafea&#39;... actually you&#39;ve got a habit of shoving too many letters together, I think... but I like them.<br><br>Looking particularly at Úmarro, which ought to suffer from both definition-issues and over-squashing... I think it&#39;s good regardless. ^_^ &#39;Mara&#39; is glossed as useful, but mostly means good, or fit for purpose... which fits a lot better, actually, since unfit can easily mean &#39;broken&#39;. And the r-r linking with nyarro is just unavoidable.<br><br>And it <i>sounds</i> like a name, one that growls its way off the tongue.<br><br>Anyway, like I said: this is your fault. I couldn&#39;t help thinking about the people the Quenya names would be attached to. Near as I can tell, they&#39;re a Feanorian elite team who first saw action at the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. They were the ones who stopped Morgoth&#39;s forces from crossing the mountains, earning them their nickname of Orotirnor, or &#39;High Watchers&#39;.<br><br>I haven&#39;t drawn all of them... but here are the first ten on your list. (In order, because I&#39;m not cruel.)<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Orotirnor1.png"><br><br>I&#39;ve tried to stay roughly faithful to the character design, while making it something that fits Middle-earth.  And yes, McCree/Maraiteo has a beard - they <i>do</i> happen, they&#39;re just not common among younger Eldar.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The reason it&#39;s so generic is that, well, even elves are unimaginative sometimes (hence <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=303529;search_term=spirit+of+fire">the ridiculousness of House Finwe</a>), and in this case you&#39;ve got the a-a, l-l, and ss all working together to give a beautiful flow: a-LASS-i-el.<br><br>It&#39;s not a Rebel phoenix, though I had to work hard to make it less so; it&#39;s a Silm-ised <a href="http://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Overwatch_(group)">Overwatch logo/emblem/whatever</a>.

She can&#39;t fly, but she&#39;s got a powerful bow (biggest one I drew, I think) that can cut down distant targets almost as if she could.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you liked the pics, at any rate; it was fun trying to infuse them with the same character as the original images (hindered by the fact that I know nooooothing).

            <p>Okay, the short answer here is &#39;because Tolkien invented them before he decided Elves didn&#39;t have beards&#39;. But that&#39;s boring.<br><br>It&#39;s impossible to know when the leaders of the three tribes - Ingwe, Finwe, Elwe and Olwe - were born. They probably /were/ born rather than awakening, because Elwe and Olwe are brothers: not a relationship that makes much sense among the first to wake. But we don&#39;t know for sure.<br><br>Cirdan and Mahtan are in the same boat. Cirdan is a leader while Mahtan is just a smith, but they /could/ both be first-generation. We don&#39;t know for sure.<br><br>Our best understanding is that Cirdan awoke at Cuivienen, or at least was born before any other elf we know of. He&#39;s in what Tolkien called the third stage of his life - essentially, old age. Elves grow beards in the third stage.<br><br>Mahtan isn&#39;t. He&#39;s in the second stage (adulthood)... but he&#39;s also one of those rare elves who are bearded in the second stage. It&#39;s just a thing, like being left-handed.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>-(n)dur literally means &#39;servant of&#39;, though in names it basically stands in for -(n)dil&#39;s &#39;friend of&#39; when -(n)dil doesn&#39;t taste right.<br><br>Also you&#39;re using the rude name for dwarves (and in Sindarin at that - the Quenya is Naucor), the one that means &#39;stunted ones&#39; (tsk!). It&#39;s far more polite to use the transliteration of their own name and call them Casari. But you didn&#39;t (XD), so you&#39;re naming him &#39;servant of ugly shorties&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hey, so, I have been lurking on your wiki for about a year. So far I&#39;ve read the original series, plus most of Desendelle&#39;s and Iximaz&#39;s stuff, and SkarmorySilver&#39;s stuff, and the works of the immortal Trojie and Pads- Honestly, I&#39;ve read a decent proportion of what&#39;s on the wiki. I&#39;m a huge fan, possibly even a fangirl.<br><br>Now, I&#39;ve been lurking on the Board as well, since about August, but couldn&#39;t bring myself to post because I have had bad, bad experiences with message boards. I am also leery of joining new communities because it somehow always ends, if online, in internecine warfare and death threats, or if IRL in cliques and restraining orders. I would like to avoid that. On the other hand, I have characters and ideas in mind and I would like to use them.<br><br>My fandoms are Star Trek (mostly TNG, DS9, and VOY, but I have working knowledge of the others), Star Wars (late Old Republic through the end of the Yuzhan-Vong wars are my most familiar time period), LOTR (a bit rusty, I was obsessed in my teens but that was a while ago), Harry Potter (have essentially memorized canon there!), Cthulhuverse (expert level in Cthulhu and Yellow Mythos), Supernatural, Firefly-verse, Alien, Terminator, Animorphs, X-Men (mostly post-1980 comics/movies) and I have a working knowledge of WoW and Silent Hill universes but do not play.<br><br>I have a degree in evolutionary biology, do come to me for Bad Biology, Bad Medicine, and Bad Genetics issues if you would like! I have also beta&#39;ed work for others before and am willing to do so again, in return for beta-ing of my work and/or collaboration on missions. <br><br>Anyway, I hope I am welcome here? Sorry for the huge novella of job application there.<br><br></p>

            <p>Nice to see another Star Wars fan about! I&#39;m more of Clone Wars though Galactic Civil War sort, but I can definitely understand the appeal of the Old Republic era. As for the Yuuzhan Vong... Well, to each their own.<br><br>So then, for your newbie gifts, a Replica Holocron (First time I&#39;ve given one to someone who listed Star Wars as a fandom, yay!) and a pocket cutlass. Simply press the button on the scabbard and it shrinks to allow comfortable pocket transportation.<br><br>Finally, what Hogwarts House do you call home?

            <p>I don&#39;t so much LIKE Yuzhan-Vong so much as I am morbidly fascinated by the psychotic buggers. Keep in mind that I am a Cthulhu-verse fan, so weird, grimdark, highly alien stuff has always been my thing. I hold similar feelings of &quot;ooh, cool, how does that work biologically/sociologically speaking&quot; for Anzati. Because of my tendencies, friends have suggested Warhammer 40K to me, and I haven&#39;t gotten into it only because I&#39;m lazy. <br><br>I&#39;ve tested both as Ravenclaw and as Gryffindor, honestly. I&#39;d say I test as Gryffindor about 60% of the time and as Ravenclaw the rest. This is going by a wide range of tests, including multiple iterations of the one on Pottermore. But not the stupid tests with five questions, or tests which ask which House you&#39;d &quot;like&quot; to be in, those don&#39;t count as proper tests!</p>

            <p>Well, I can definitely understand that angle (I also think the Anzati are pretty cool, and your friends are probably right about Warhammer) but it&#39;s not so much the species as the creative decisions that spawned them that I have a problem with. The writing and story direction for the Yuuzhan Vong era is my least favorite out of the whole franchise. To be perfectly honest just about everything turns decidedly &quot;meh&quot; for me roundabouts the Young Jedi Knights series.. It&#39;s a bit unfair, I&#39;ll admit, given how little I&#39;ve actually read of those stories, but something about the general tone just sticks in my craw.<br><br>Well, I was pretty close, then. Though personally I don&#39;t put much stock in the quizzes. Even the one on Pottermore. After being told no less than four times that I was in Slytherin (despite being neither particularly cunning nor ambitious in the least) and once in Gryffindor (which is just laughably wrong) I pretty much decided self examination would be far more effective. </p>

And because I am an Endless Fount of Bad Ideas and Overplanning, I have decided that I need to figure out the day-to-day workings of Vulcan biology (<a href="http://66.media.tumblr.com/c8ca16665a8548c97936883118d7ca1b/tumblr_mt68mltSU51qj782bo1_500.jpg">no, not that kind</a>.

            <p>Welcome! <br>And, personally speaking, I love job applications. They go deliciously with a mug of warm milk. <br><br>Cthulhu Mythos fan, oy? What&#39;s your favourite story in it? <br>Mine&#39;s the Case of Charles Dexter Ward. Er. Maybe. It might be The Rats in the Walls. Or Dream-Quest. Mountains of Madness? <br>Bugger. <br>Not familiar with the Yellow Mythos, however. If it&#39;s tied to the Cthulhu stuff, though, I&#39;m definitely interested, if you&#39;ve got any recommendations relating to that, or some such. <br>PPC community&#39;s pretty chill, generally speaking, so you&#39;ll be right! No worries, no problems, no spooks. <br>Interested, indeed, in seeing those characters and ideas and whatnot you&#39;ve got. <br><br>My gift upon you is: a fancy, minimalist hardcover! For your job application novella. It&#39;ll protect it, look real fancy, it can hold doors open, you can use it to weigh down a hot air balloon, you can grind it up for sustenance if you&#39;re lost in the wilderness, and you can use it to beat people into unconsciousness, if you hit hard enough. <br>Welcome!

            <p>Hard Core Mythos fan, with caps, yes. I play CoC weekly since 2014. I&#39;ve read all of Lovecraft&#39;s work, all of Clark Ashton Smith&#39;s and Robert W. Chambers&#39; stuff, and even all of Derleth&#39;s stuff (ugh); and I&#39;m going to be starting Masks of Nyarlathotep (the big one!) in January with my droogs. <br><br>I&#39;d have to say that my favorite is probably The Colour Out of Space for pure horror (radiation poisoning is a squick button of mine), Dreams in the Witch House for an acid trip, Dream-Quest for adventure, Charles Dexter Ward or Shadow Over Innsmouth for mystery/thriller, and Rats in the Walls or Mountains of Madness for balanced pulp. I also liked Shunned House, partly because I read it while suffering from actual fungal pneumonia lol. And Cats of Ulthar because I love my little princess and she will probably eat my body should I die unexpectedly.<br><br>The Yellow Mythos is everything deriving from Robert W. Chambers&#39; &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; cycle. This includes such things as True Detective. The Mythos is diverse, but it centers around Hastur, who is a Great Old One like Cthulhu. <br><br>Thanks for the hardcover, I promise I won&#39;t let B&#39;Elanna the Destructor wreck it!</p>

            <p>I love <i>all</i> of those ones!<br>Bloody hard, figuring out a favourite Lovecraft story, honestly. There&#39;s heaps, and all of the brilliant ones have enough differing elements to be set apart from the other brilliant ones. Innsmouth (bloody great ending, that) and The Colour Out of Space are definitely, also, some of my favourites. Witch House, too, was brilliant (math-magic!) <br>Haven&#39;t read Cats of Ulthar or Shunned House, though...<br>Consider this rectified! <br><br>You know, I&#39;ve actually heard of &#39;The King in Yellow.&#39; I think it&#39;s on my reading list, actually. Best place to start, then, oy? <br><br>And I&#39;d like to see B&#39;Elanna <i>try</i> wrecking it. It&#39;s not called &#39;hardcover&#39; because it&#39;s soft! </p>

            <p>Have either of y&#39;all looked at your existential horror stories and thought that they could use a (sort-of parody) spy agency, a big pile of nerdy jokes, and a snarky narrator? If so, you might want to stick Charles Stross&#39;s <i>Laundry Files</i> series (first book is <i>The Atrocity Archives</i>) on your reading list.<br><br>- Tomash, who sounds like a late-night infomercial right now<br></p>

            <p>Ooh, I&#39;ve been meaning to read those. Some are on Hoopla, I believe, but for the full set I&#39;ll probably have to go to Amazon. Once my number of Hoopla downloads renews at the end of the month I&#39;ll see if I can get Atrocity Archives.</p>

            <p>Oddly enough, the Dark Yagami mission is one of those that I feel like I could&#39;ve done better with, particularly since I&#39;d kinda lost touch with writing my Floaters team at the time and had that not been the case, I&#39;d have probably done the utter &quot;WTF&quot;-ness of that fic a lot more justice! X&#39;D You have no idea how flattered I am that you listed it as your favorite, though! :D<br><br>And in case you&#39;re wondering about the next time Ripper will be showing up, you&#39;re in luck, since I&#39;ll be focusing on my Floaters team for the next nine missions I&#39;ll be publishing prior to a certain widely-anticipated event I have planned. And while I intend to focus on the agents I got Permission with for a couple of them, Ripper will definitely be rejoining the hunt after that. He certainly can&#39;t stay in Medical forever, after all! ;)</p>

            <p>Thanks for the gift! I don&#39;t plan to write missions right away, I&#39;d like to get known on the board first.<br><br>Oh, I forgot to list some other fandoms I&#39;m competent enough to work in- Stand Still Stay Silent, the webcomic by Minna Sundberg.
