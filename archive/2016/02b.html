Terry Pratchett died in 2015 and his final book, The Shepherd&#39;s Crown, was published in the same year. He was well-known as a lover of science and, with two well-known science writers, co-wrote a series of four books called The Science of the Discworld, which took a sideways look at &#39;roundworld&#39; (Earth) science.<br><br>Octarine, in the Discworld books, is known as &#39;the colour of magic&#39;, which forms the title of Pratchett&#39;s first ever Discworld book. According to Disc mythology, octarine is visible only to wizards and cats, and is generally described as a sort of greenish-yellow purple colour, which seems perfect for what will probably be the final halogen in the periodic table. Octarine is also a particularly pleasing choice because, not only would it honour a world-famous and much-loved author, but it also has an &#39;ine&#39; ending, consistent with the other elements in group 17. <br><br>Octarine is being counted as &#39;a mythological concept&#39; under IUPAC rules, which state that elements must be named after &quot;a mythological concept or character; a mineral, or similar substance; a place or geographical region; a property of the element; or a scientist&quot;. The Discworld stories are certainly stories about gods and heroes, and 70 million books surely count for something.</i><br><br>This will <i>super</i> never happen. Ununseptium was discovered by Russians, who are probably not particular fans of Pterry. It&#39;s also in row seven, group 7 of the periodic table, making the name &#39;octarine&#39; hilariously wrong.<br><br>But it <i>should</i> happen.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The main one is that name proposals have to come from the institute that discovered the element. In this case it&#39;s a cooperative effort between Russia&#39;s JINR in Dubna and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. So petitioning <i>IUPAC</i> is pointless - they&#39;ll only accept ideas from the contributing labs. (Luckily, the petition also specifies those two.)<br><br>Secondly, most of the work seems to have been done by the Russians - who one assumes aren&#39;t big Pratchett fans.<br><br>Thirdly, IUPAC&#39;s rules say that elements must be named for &quot; a mythological concept or character (including an astronomical object), a mineral, or similar substance, a place or geographical region, a property of the element, or a scientist,&quot; and must end in -ium. The petition tries to swing octarine as mythology, which is actually the same thing being tried for naming regions of Pluto. Not a very strong case, and the ending is definitely wrong.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Surely the better candidate would be octiron, considering that it&#39;s the actual element. Or at least the solid form, which might be elemental and probably only is if you don&#39;t look hard enough. =]</p>

            <p>That means it would traditionally end with -on, whereas the halogens - fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, astatine - have the -ine ending.<br><br>Though IUPAC seem to want every new element to end in -ium these days, which is boring and will break both those patterns.

            <p>As well as woken up before they were quite ready for me. Thankfully, they were done with the surgery proper, but it... surprised them. The screaming is because... well, I forget who told me that you can&#39;t feel the IV once it&#39;s in, but they lied.

So yeah, while I&#39;m pretty easily distracted in class—I&#39;m that jack*** who keeps rapidly clicking pens and endlessly bouncing my knee up and down or jittering my foot or tapping my fingers (or all of the above at once)—if you sit me down in front of something I love, I&#39;ll become so engrossed in doing it that I completely lose track of time.<br><br>That&#39;s actually why I&#39;ve been able to write so many missions in two years; I just sit down and write and write and write until my parents remind me I&#39;m supposed to eat.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been nice because the PPC&#39;s actually helped me learn the time zones of different countries and cities, so it makes figuring out when to call dad while he&#39;s on a trip easier. No more Googling what time it is in Anchorage!</p>

            <p>...so it was the room I was supposed to be in. I dunno about the IV, though, since I&#39;ve often felt things I shouldn&#39;t. The whole reason I was being put under for tooth removal?<br><br>Yeah, so that thing where they put a bazillion shots in your mouth to keep you from feeling it? Apparently doesn&#39;t work on me. Last time that got done, I felt every single shot, and still (painfully) felt the removal itself. Anesthetic and I do not have the best working relationship, and it often works less, or not at all. Then there&#39;s the fact that melatonin takes me out of commission with depression for a week if I take any at all, and that painkillers are pretty slow on me... well. I am apparently unusually full of idiosyncratic drug reactions.<br><br>Hooray, then, that the cars are forbidden from bothering you!</p>

            <p>Once when I was 13 and had a liver biopsy done. It was kinda weird, I remember being there, on the table, and I <i>had</i> to be conscious because during the procedure I was instructed to hold my breath... but I don&#39;t remember it. At the very beginning, I was given this drug that caused a retrograde amnesia -- I was conscious during the biopsy, but if you ask me to recall what I was doing at that time, I got nothing; I don&#39;t remember anything.<br><br>And my second general was quite recently, when my heart started to panic.

            <p>I can&#39;t decide if the fact that it feels like the PPC setting was almost extraneous to the story is a good thing (because it shows that even people in fantastical settings do the same sorts of thing) or a neutral one (because... something about not using the setting, except you did, actually).

            <p>They seem to think that meowing at us in the middle of the night until we get up and let them through is satisfactory. To be fair, they&#39;re right.<br><br>One of my family&#39;s cats, Nimby, likes to sleep on clean laundry. Nimby also has thick fur and sheds a lot.

            <p>Or he did until this year, when he learned how to get into Phobos&#39; sock drawer. After that, I finally gave in and just let him have one to keep (until it gets too nasty and I give him a new one, and by &quot;new&quot; I mean old and full of holes anyway). He stashes them by his food dish and chews on them in between bites. I guess it&#39;s kind of like having a toothbrush? I dunno.<br><br>He also might be the only cat in the world who will ask to be picked up by reaching up your leg, like a little kid.

            <p>They also chew everything; my first rabbit, when I was pretty little, chewed up my favorite book at the time, and my wooden bookshelf here has also been marked by them--as have a few book spines, though not by too much--I put a barrier in front of the books on the lowest shelf before it got too bad. They also liked to go under my bed--and I keep boxes of things there, so it was pretty hard to get them out again--which is why there&#39;s a board there blocking the access.<br><br>.......come to think of it... I suppose I no longer need that board :/ Or the block on the lowest bookshelf. My rabbits are gone, and I&#39;m not currently getting a new one--and the fish I have now don&#39;t exactly leave their tank. I...should probably move the board and stuff.<br><br>Amazing, isn&#39;t it, the things that change? And the things that you don&#39;t think to change when the conditions that created them are gone? It&#39;s probably the time factor--it&#39;s only about one year, out of more than ten, that I&#39;ve lived in Canada and haven&#39;t had one to two rabbits in my room.<br><br>I do like my fish, though. They&#39;re very pretty, have some character, and I may have named them in Yiddish. Pretty creatively, too--there&#39;s a sunset platy named Shki&#39;e (meaning Sunset), I just lost the rainbow show guppy who was tentatively named Regen-boigen (meaning Rainbow--a bit of an odd-sounding word, which literally means something like &#39;rain bend&#39;, but it grows on you), and, the piиce de rйsistance--a...red cobra show guppy, I think he is, named Glantsik. Which, of course...means Shiny. He&#39;s a very shiny fish :D<br><br>I&#39;ve also had guinea pigs, goldfish, and a pet mouse, though those were all a while ago, and my friend&#39;s sister&#39;s giant fluffy orange cat once woke me up when it was still dark because he wanted to be cuddled. It was awesome :D<br><br>Also, which Valie did you name your cat after?<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: I didn&#39;t get any type of tuxedo guppy, but if I ever do, I will probably be obliged to name it after James Bond, because seriously, what better name can there be for a *tuxedo* fish? :D</p>

            <p>I wanted something from Tolkien, but also something short and relatively easy to spell (Yes, I&#39;m her to pick up Thuringwethil? Yes, that&#39;s her name).

Until a few months ago, Nessa lived in my bedroom (she&#39;s fond of tearing stuff up, particularly curtains, so I thought I should limit the disaster zone) and only just this past week have I removed all of the fail safes I put in place, like the blankets wrapped around my sconces to keep her from tearing the lampshades.

            <p>The youngest, Edward Nygma (yes, that is his actual name, although I just call him Eddiebaby) have recently taken to paw my face in the middle of the night when he wants cuddles. The problem is that he doesn&#39;t always retract his claws all the way in. :(<br>He also have a habit of picking up small objects, especially kitchen sponges, and moving them around. Sometimes I&#39;ll see him walking down the hall with a sponge in his mouth and a focused expression, that makes you think he really has a plan for what he&#39;s going to do with it. Then he&#39;ll abandon it on the floor.<br><br>I also do foster work for a local shelter, where I take in orphaned kittens until they are old enough to be adopted. A lot of them like to sleep in the potted plants.</p>

            <p>Dark Civilian Aakmal was, er, <i>prodded</i> into thinking about his paper money scheme by Ye Scape-Grace. Y&#39;see, rather than flax or spices or whatever, I think the true currency Ye Scape-Grace (who is at this point basically Baroness Iximaz&#39;s vizier, troubleshooter, and occasional purveyor of stabby) values is <i>information</i>: troop movements, reports from the Marizu League, title deeds, land grants, laws, codes, books of magic, all that sort of thing. And since a currency can&#39;t be just word of mouth, it is paper, and encoded in pictures. Printers are clever sorts, and old presses are titanic, and the written word is king in Plort because writing makes it real. It seems... apt.</p>

            <p>(I hope this thread isn&#39;t too early)<br><br>So, I finished <i>Games Wizards Play</i> last night, and I figured here&#39;s as good a place as any to dump thoughts.<br><br>It was good. I wouldn&#39;t class GWP as the best YW book ever, but I definitely had fun reading it. It has a slightly smaller scope than some of the previous books, which is, I think, a good thing. (You can&#39;t save the universe or an entire planet every book, after all.) My only complaint is that having That One directly involved in building up some of the dramatic tension made me expect more conflict in the climax.

            <p>ret13 was one of the oldest spoiler guards on the Internet. It was one of the two main spoiler guards on Usenet back in the 70s (the other was inserting a bunch of page break characters so the news reader wouldn&#39;t immediately show the spoiler). It has the nice property that encoding and decoding are the same operation (shift the alphabet halfway around) and that most Unix systems (including modern Linux, but I don&#39;t know about Mac OS X) had a &quot;rot13&quot; program to do it for you. (If they didn&#39;t, it was a one-line shell command).<br><br>- Tomash, nerding about about computer history</p>

Mostly because it would be too unique, and not fitting with other we&#39;ve seen. Most Semblances focus on helping in battle - Pyrrha&#39;s control over the battlefield, Ruby&#39;s speed, Yang&#39;s durability, or even Flynt&#39;s Killer Quartet (reinforcements. Also, I love this name - &quot;Killer Quartet&quot;! :D). Turning into a bird would be... well... too environmental, not really useful in battle, but more outside of it.</p>

            <p>Hi! <br>I found the PPC through its TV Tropes article, and read through the Original Series in about three nights. I&#39;ve also been reading a few of the spin-offs, mostly in the <i>Harry Potter</i> continuum.<br>My interests include listening to music, reading, writing, and watching TV, and my fandoms include <i>Harry Potter, Welcome to Night Vale, Virals</i> and <i>Supernatural</i>. I will also, given an opportunity, attempt to persuade you to read Marvel&#39;s <i>Loki: Agent of Asgard</i>. I apologise in advance for everything.<br>I&#39;ve read a lot of articles on the Wiki, as well as the constitution, so hopefully I know what I&#39;m doing! This whole community seems like a lot of fun (and, as someone who abhors poor spelling and badly-written fanfic whilst being a lover of snark, somewhere that&#39;s right up my alley!), and hopefully I can become a small part of it.</p>

            <p>Glad to see tha you did pretty much all the required reading. It&#39;s good to know this stuff before joining. I should know, because it took a long time between funishing the TOS pretty much as fast as you and actually introducing myself around these parts. Spent a LOOOONG time lurking around the Wiki ... <br><br>Anyway, for your welcoming gifts, please take this Bag of Holding so that you can store the truckload of gifts you got, your very own Muggle-use wand and a Rorschach Book, which can change into virtually written text in existence in the multiverse. It works somewhat like the Room of Requirement: To use it, close your eyes holding  it, think about what you wanna read and then blink three times! <br><br>And you&#39;re right, people around are indeed wonderful. This is pretty much the friendliest and most welcoming community I have ever had the pleasure of joining! :D <br><br>Also, which spin-offs with missions into HP have you read? </p>

            <p>Please accept this starter Pokйmon:-<br><img src="http://randompokemon.com/sprites/animated/520.gif"><br>Iiiiiit&#39;s Tranquill!<br><br>And your starting item is:-<br><img src="http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/d/d6/Sacrificial_Dagger_Icon.png?version=60b5cd7ab94b9720b873035ff2f3c7c2"><br>Sacrificial Dagger from <i>The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth</i>!<br><br>So... Tranquill&#39;s not great. It&#39;s another NFE mon with pretty ropey stats and a not-so-great movepool that barely features any physical Flying-type moves. Additionally, while Sac Dagger is a great defensive item and an occasionally useful offensive item - 50% chance that your opponent will take 1/8 damage to its health whenever they or you use a contact move - it&#39;s not great on Pokйmon with Tranquill&#39;s nonexistent bulk. The mon&#39;s one saving grace is its ability, Super Luck, which makes everything more likely to crit. Therefore, I suggest running an offensive set with Return, Night Slash, U-Turn, and Tailwind. Or just wait for it to evolve and use it like that. Just remember to have fun. =]</p>

            <p>I was talking with some friends and we posed a question:  If some extraterrestrial beings were to essentially put Earth/Humanity on trial (not dissimilar from The Encounter at Farpoint, Start Trek TNG Episodes 1 and 2) and you could select any person, either real or otherwise to defend humanity in this incident who would you chose?<br><br>Rules:  Can be any person from Earth&#39;s History or Fiction, but no religious figures (that could just devolve quickly).  Further the person you chose does not necessarily need to be human.  All you need to do is just post the name, and if you want you can add some reasons why, that would make the most interesting discussion after all.<br><br>I am curious to see what results will show up.</p>

            <p>Gene Roddenberry and Terry Pratchett spring to mind, but you could take your pick of any of the great SF/fantasy authors. My reasoning is that you have to know people pretty well to write about them convincingly. You have to know their flaws, their pettiness, even their evil... and yet, through all that clear-eyed cynicism, you also have to believe in your heart of hearts that people have it in them to be more. Otherwise you&#39;d have nothing to write about.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Nienna is a good candidate, I think, because she can bring good out of bad in the form of wisdom from sorrow.

            <p>Batman. Point A: He would&#39;ve expected this to happen at one point. Point B: He&#39;s human. A fictional human, but completely human nonetheless. If we were going to try to dominate the judges, I&#39;d go for the Batman of the 853rd century. If we&#39;re going for convincing that humanity can change, The one from the JLAU.  Also, wouldn&#39;t Harbinger just indoctrinate whatever we sent to defend ourselves? Just saying. Another choice would be a newborn child. Just let them see the innocence of certain humans.</p>

            <p>Batman was actually one of the ones I came up with.  As for Harbinger, indoctrination usually takes an extended period time, longer than what I have in mind for this.<br><br>Here&#39;s the way I was thinking Batman would work:<br><br>He does his stick and basically causes the Joker to attempt to take over the entire group.  This causes the organic members to try to gain control through their own methods.  Aizen&#39;s Zanpakuto&#39;s total hypnosis gives him a distinct advantage, Batman, being Batman already knew about this ability and was using artificial sight, he is unaffected by it, while Aizen is gaining control, Batman gets on the line with Oracle who hacks in and disables Skynet which had already taken control of Agent Smith taking both of them out of the fight.<br><br>Batman then gets in his Bat-rocket (or whatever) and sneaks aboard Harbinger, (since Reapers can be breached).  He sneaks to the Mass Drive, disables it which either disables or destroys Harbinger, Batman gets back to the main council where now Aizen has taken full control.  Batman exploits Aizen&#39;s over-confidence and proposes a one on one fight to determine the fate of the world.  Aizen agrees, thinking he has the advantage because of his zanpakuto, Batman using artificial sight is unaffected by it.  He gains the upper hand, but when Aizen attempts Kido Batman uses one of his freeze grenades (from the Arkham Series) fully incapacitates Aizen.  Q comes to and sees that Batman has saved the council even though they were trying to destroy Earth, realizes he doesn&#39;t want to have to deal with Batman, decides it isn&#39;t worth it effectively surrenders just as the rest of the Justice League arrive to save Earth leading to this exchange:<br><br>Batman: Took you long enough<br><br>Superman:  What happened?<br><br>Batman:  It&#39;s over, we won.<br><br>Superman:  You defeated them?  Alone?<br><br>Batman:  Yes.<br><br>Superman:  How?<br><br>Batman:  Simple...It&#39;s because...<br>Batman: <b>I&#39;m Batman!</b><br><br>Thus revealing to the world that Batman really does have superpowers.  Being Batman. </p>

            <p>There are basically three ways for someone to win this scenario (such as it is)<br><br>1. Convince a majority (5) of the panel that humans are worth saving/sparing.  This is what most of you have been going for which is what I was hoping for.<br><br>2.  Convince one of a select few individuals on the panel that could force the others to follow along.  I would say those are Q, Aizen, or Father.  If you think another could force all the others to go along feel free to suggest it, just be prepared to answer how.  For example Q has near omnipotence.  Aizen has his zanpakuto which lets him hypnotize and manipulate others.  Father has a philosopher&#39;s stone and stupid powerful alchemy.<br><br>3.  There could also be a more violent solution, but if just one of the panel is still able to function without changing his/her/its mind then the Earth is doomed.<br><br>So far this has been pretty interesting, I think Mr. Rogers is my favorite answer so far.  I have another possible solution I&#39;ll share later.  But as an update the following have been proposed.<br><br>1. The Doctor<br>2. Mr. Rogers<br>3. Anne Frank<br>4. Acacia<br>5. Saitama<br>6. Death of the Endless<br>7. King Arthur (just for simplicity hS, I&#39;m calling your second option this)  <br>8. Superman<br>9. Your Mother (again for simplicity just using Your Mother overall)<br>10.  Council of Gandhi, Lincoln, and Churchill<br>11.  Captain Jean-Luc Picard<br><br>Currently the leading champions of Earth are (vote numbers are included, any time the individual is suggested regardless of 1st, 2nd, 3rd choice etc.):<br><br>1.  The Doctor (3)<br>2.  Acacia (2)<br>3.  Mr. Rogers (2)<br>4.  King Arthur (2)</p>

If the trial should fail Humanity will be wiped from existence, if humanity wins they will be left alone in peace from this body forever.

            <p>((Look, there&#39;s a dearth of Civ 5 fics out there but as soon as I find one it&#39;s getting missioned, k?))<br><br>Here&#39;s what I&#39;d do, since I&#39;ve been mostly very negative in this thread. I&#39;m coming down with something green and slimy, is the thing, so do bear that in mind if I&#39;m grouchy or incoherent. Well, more so than normal, anyways. =]<br><br>Anyway, my pick takes the form of a ficlet, so here we go.<br><br>---<br><br>The thing in the sky - some of those were still calling it God and arguing which one it was, which is why they hadn&#39;t been given an invitation - had given them a week. A group of people now stood at the allotted place and time, of every race, colour and creed. Young and old, rich and poor, in sickness and in health, the group stood together. And when the voice rang in their heads, they parted as one, and small footsteps edged cautiously forward, spurred on by larger ones.<br><br>&quot;This is my great-grandson,&quot; said a man with a stoop and a stick and the wispy remnants of a long beard flicked about by the breeze. He was speaking in Amharic, but everyone understood. &quot;He is three years old. We live together, his mother, her parents, and myself, and we live simple and honest lives.<br><br>&quot;There will be people around the world expecting greatness. Kings and emperors, scientists and engineers, artists and poets. Those who have already accomplished greatness. But look at my great-grandson. My Tewodros, who has learned to walk and who can read a little of our language. He might do great things, or things which are terrible, or he might just live his life without doing much of anything at all.<br><br>&quot;Wipe us out this day, Sky-Being, and you will not know.&quot;<br><br>The old man gripped his stick in knuckles so white some were worried the skin would split. He swayed slightly. His knees hurt a little. &quot;My child, <i>every</i> child, is this planet and this people&#39;s future! If we do not give you cause to let us survive now, let our children give it! Because how will we ever improve, how <i>can</i> we improve, if we are exterminated now like rats in a pantry? Whatever crimes you think the human race has committed, and there have been many and they have been abominable, our children are innocent! So let them go! And let us be! Let us--&quot;<br><br>And the old man sank to the floor, coughing and in pain, and the child ran to him. The old man was slowly lifted by a small, chubby hand, and the child turned around, and said, haltingly...<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t want to die.&quot;<br><br>And the world believed.</p>

            <p>Because it&#39;s my favourite, I&#39;m probably gonna be slightly biased, but I&#39;ll try to contain it:<br><br>Tenth seemed to be a perfect balance between the Straight-Outta-Gallifrey Ninth, and the Crazed Genius Eleventh.

Now, the reason I didn&#39;t choose the War Doctor, is because he was molded a warrior, not a diplomat, and Twelfth is too serious. Knowing Tenth, he would not only convince the invaders to drop all the charges, but would also negotiate some sort of beneficial deal for the planet. If I remember (Ix help), Tenth was the one who mentioned the Shadow Proclamation the most often, therefore struck me as the kind of guy who know the Law and how to bend it to his will. </p>

            <p>Yes, he loves Earth and all that, and is devoted to defending it... but he&#39;s not actually very <i>good</i> at finding peaceful solutions.

            <p>The &quot;relevant discussion&quot; was about minis like &quot;hardric&quot;, where &quot;Hardric&quot; would be a canon character’s name. While some Boarders like to catch as much minis as possible, others frown upon this habit, because minis are spawned by misspelling a canon character’s name, but &quot;not capitalizing where it is required, as in the first letter of a name&quot; is just bad grammar, not a misspelling of the name.<br><br>Are you sure that the mistake in &quot;HardRic&quot; is &quot;randomly capitalizing a letter in the middle of a word&quot;, where the word is meant to be canon character Hardric’s name? Whether this spawns a mini may be debatable.<br><br>Just as well, the mistake could be &quot;omitting the necessary space between first and last name&quot;, where &quot;Hard Ric&quot; was never meant to be the canon character Hardric. This certainly wouldn’t spawn a mini; it would spawn an additional OC who may just sit around moping because the narration doesn’t mention him ever again.<br><br>Actually, &quot;Hard Ric&quot; sounds more like a nickname, and a person nicknamed Hard Ric (or Hard Rick?) would probably not be contented just sitting around moping. What would he do left to his own devices? What should the agents do with him? Use your imagination and have more fun than with just another mini. (Okay, the last part doesn’t help you, because the miscapitalization you’re actually dealing with certainly isn’t &quot;HardRic&quot;.)<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I wasn&#39;t a Boarder when I first started reading PPC stories, but I started that around 2006 or so. Then, in 2013, I decided to go looking, and found about a hundred Boarders instead of the 2-5 I&#39;d rather expected. It was <i>amazing</i> (and, obviously, I stayed). It&#39;s a pretty lovely thing to see.<br><br>Me, I&#39;m doing well. I&#39;m on reading week, which means I get to stay home, see a friend or two, and think about all the schoolwork I need to get done this week lest I regret it! Very fun so far. :)<br><br>When was the last time you checked in?

            <p>Hmm, not sure when the last time I checked it was. Could&#39;ve been a year ago... or two years... I have no sense of time, unfortunately. I check in sporadically but usually don&#39;t say much.<br><br>I first found the PPC in the fall of 2002. I think I read the stories on fanfiction.net and then found my way to this board. I&#39;d estimate at that time there were maybe 12-15 active posters here. So... yeah. I was all of 14 when I started posting here, and now I&#39;m almost 28. I&#39;ve been friends with some of the people I met here for well over a decade now, which is somewhat terrifying to think about (because I&#39;m old, not because they&#39;re terrifying, aha). <br><br>By the way, the board looks exactly the same now as it did back then. I remember we had some pretty intense debates about whether to move it to a different platform. Not sure if such debates are ongoing, but the consensus then was that change is evil. :P</p>

            <p>So what kind of quiz? For the agent, or for their writer?<br><br>Because, of course, your goals as a writer are different from &quot;your&quot; goals as an agent.<br><br>As a writer:<br>--If you&#39;re going to Bad Slash, of course you have to have read and enjoyed at least some *good* slash. If you&#39;re not into reading romantic fiction, DBS is probably not your thing.<br><br>--Writing assassinations means writing about your assassins killing something that&#39;s... well, not quite sapient, but that at least looks like it ought to be. So you&#39;ll be writing death scenes.<br><br>--Floaters don&#39;t specialize; on the other hand, Floaters can&#39;t specialize. That means you can do literally anything in terms of missions, but it also means you aren&#39;t going to get much guidance on what you should be doing.<br><br>--High-power departments like ESAS, Special Sue Unit, etc., are pretty tempting because of the sheer variety of powers available; but they&#39;re also more challenging, because either your target fic, your agents, or both, are going to be high-power level characters. Those are always hard to write while still avoiding glitter. On the other hand, it&#39;s about the only way you&#39;re going to fit your dragon, Q, or 10th-level D&amp;D wizard into the PPC.<br><br>--DIC. Implausible crossovers. Must be a crossover fan; must be able to write stories that involve untangling crossovers rather than Sue-killing or exorcisms. Maybe a bit trickier because Untangling doesn&#39;t have quite the natural endpoint that a DMS or DBS mission does.<br><br>--Grammar nut? Try the DTE. But only if you can write about bad grammar, horrible spelling, and clunky composition, and still make it funny.<br><br>--DOGA and Temporal Offenses are for writers who are good at keeping maps and timelines in their heads, no doubt about it. Remembering where things should be and how big they should be is important when you&#39;re exposing your poor agents to the twisted geometry of these badfics. On the other hand, you might get to give your agents flamethrowers, so there&#39;s always that.<br><br>--DoWTF. Like weird fics, weird settings, badly written crackfic? This is for you. Be prepared to deal with the weirdness. Maybe it&#39;s best if your agents are pretty weird themselves. (Think Doktor Trollenfisch. That is all.)<br><br>Rare fandoms: For fans of the classics, indie or less-popular works, or things that just don&#39;t get a lot of fanfic. Shakespeare scholar? Lover of indie computer games? This is your department.<br><br>Troll Division; Bad Parody: PPC fluff hasn&#39;t been quite fluffed out here, but if you want to deal with trollfic, here&#39;s your chance. If you wanna kill the troll, you gotta find it first...<br><br>Department of Angst: Want to expose your agents to badly-written, over-the-top depressing fics? Here&#39;s your chance. Hope you have a good grasp of psychology to counter all the Bad Psychology.<br><br>Department of Improbable AUs: For want of a nail, the fic became horrible... Are you good at answering &quot;what ifs&quot;? Have your agents crack down on the writers who use AU as an excuse for bad writing.<br><br>DAVD: Badly-written torture!fics, mass-murders, and gorn. You&#39;ll probably need some knowledge of medicine and psychology, as well as a strong stomach. Or at least a bucket to upchuck into.<br><br>Intel: A cross between action and non-action; your agents might be monitoring fics from PPC HQ, or entering fics physically. Intel is interesting because you don&#39;t actually get to fix the fic yourself--your agent would experience it, but (if things go right) not get involved. Intel is the department most likely to be sent into a goodfic.<br><br>Infrastructure: These people don&#39;t go into fics at all, but they do work at PPC HQ, and that&#39;s an interesting setting to write about. If you keep thinking of interludes, but aren&#39;t really all that interested in writing missions, consider an Infrastructure department.</p>

            <p>I think that a planning sheet for the writer and a character chart for the agents might be okay...

            <p>I saw the USS Iowa, which was nice. Wound up getting a gash in my hand from a palm tree, which I proceeded to swear even more than usual at. It&#39;s all kind of a blur, though since the TSA wouldn&#39;t let me take my sleep meds. We mostly went for my Dad, though. He was running in the LA Marathon as part of his physical rehab. If this seems disjointed and twitchy, it&#39;s because I&#39;m running on -3 days worth of sleep, and enough caffeine/sugar to kill an elephant. They had good tea down there, so I just couldn&#39;t stop drinking it.</p>

            <p>So as some of you may not even know, we have an IRC room on the Sorcery server. There used to be a thriving community, easily rivaling the activity of the board, only at a faster speed. There also used to be a link to said IRC room up top with all the other important links.<br><br>Now we have no mods, no link, and maybe three people (including myself) who actually visit with any regularity. Unless people want to try to revitalize it (which I would be all for, it was fun as heck and I made all of my current best friends there), I vote we close it down. I think the community should, obviously, have a say in this so I figured I&#39;t put this up here.</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t know when it got taken down, but honestly, I&#39;m still in favor of just getting rid of the IRC because it&#39;s been abandoned far longer than the link has been gone. Probably because most of the regulars decided they wanted nothing to do with the PPC anymore.</p>

            <p>Like Des, I&#39;ve been in similar chatrooms with Boarders before, and it&#39;s always been fun. I think the IRC would be a neat way to socialize with Boarders who maybe don&#39;t post as much; plus, it&#39;ll feel more like a real conversation than back-and-forth on a message board.<br><br>Do you think that if a few people commit to spending time on there regularly, and others begin popping in, it might take off on its own? <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m in there sometimes... But usually it&#39;s just automated pings and no one talks. I had a lot of fun in the IRC, but I&#39;m not sure how we&#39;d resurrect it. The thing about the IRC is, I don&#39;t know if having Assigned IRC-People would work to bring it back - I feel like something like the chat needs to happen more or less organically, but. Well. Certainly I don&#39;t have better ideas.</p>

            <p>I firmly believe that this community would devour the works of Brandon Sanderson like a school of hungry piranhas going after some poor jungle critter; therefore, I shall plug him. <br><br>Brandon Sanderson is honestly one of the best writers I&#39;ve ever had the privilege to read. His characters are vibrant, his magic systems are deep, his world-building is <i>epic</i>, and his stories always make me think. He leaves me laughing, crying, and eagerly awaiting the next installment. He writes mostly fantasy, with a dash of science fiction, and he&#39;s quite prolific. If you don&#39;t mind diving right in, try his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GYI9C4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"><i>Mistborn</i></a> trilogy; if you&#39;re in the market for only one novel I&#39;d go with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elantris-Anniversary-Authors-Definitive-Edition-ebook/dp/B003G93YLY/ref=pd_sim_351_4?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=51gAenep41L&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR107%2C160_&amp;refRID=1K1Y90AWDH12J33BNKWE"><i>Elantris</i></a>. If you want something even smaller, I&#39;d recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sixth-Dusk-Cosmere-Brandon-Sanderson-ebook/dp/B00OME9TZC/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455764102&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sixth+of+the+dusk"><i>Sixth of the Dusk</i></a>; my favorite novella.<br><br>If you want to test him out before committing to buying one of his deliciously long books (that I still finish in a day or two, because I honestly can&#39;t put them down) try <a href="http://brandonsanderson.com/mistborn-prologue/">this</a> preview chapter from the first <i>Mistborn</i>. And <a href="http://brandonsanderson.com/i-hate-dragons/">here&#39;s</a> a humorous dialogue exercise he posted about a poor kid whose special knack is smelling good to dragons. Appropriately titled: &quot;I Hate Dragons.&quot;<br><br>If you need any more convincing, one word: Cosmere. <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>I was given the first, then made sure to get the other two (due to them not being in our library). And... I&#39;m <i>still</i> not sure how much I like them. :-/<br><br>This review/analysis will necessarily contain spoilers, but I&#39;ll try to keep them mild. You should be able to read these and still enjoy the books just as much - the main one is just that a character you don&#39;t think is going to die, doesn&#39;t die. ;)<br><br>My first issue was with the blurb on the back of <i>The Final Empire</i> - and the front, for that matter - which states the really interesting premise: What if the Dark Lord won? Great, fascinating - but we are very, very quickly told that the &#39;Dark Lord&#39; is the Chosen One who turned evil. Which means that either the blurb is a flat-out lie, or it&#39;s a massive spoiler for the fact that the <i>premise</i> contains a flat-out lie. That left me skeptical. (In fact, at no point in <i>The Final Empire</i> is any character mentioned who could even <i>be</i> a Dark Lord from the Chosen One&#39;s story. So the blurb is a lie whatever else happens.)<br><br>Secondly, Elend. I don&#39;t have any particular problem with Elend himself - but <i>why</i> does he end up in a position of such prominence in <i>The Well of Ascension</i>? That never sat right with me. He was not a person the heroes of the first book should ever have looked to in the way they did, and nothing made sense of it for me at any point.<br><br>Thirdly, the chapter-heading documents. I liked them. I liked the way they sneak you the backstory, and I like the way they do it through an inherently biased viewpoint.<br><br>But. When the first two books pivot on the fact that there is something misleading about those excerpts (and, thankfully, they are <i>different</i> misleading things)... how much of an idiot would I have to be to believe the implication of the third one?<br><br>Fourthly, while I adore his worldbuilding, I&#39;m not so sure about the way he works things in. I can&#39;t recall the details, but I&#39;m sure there were at least a few things which were just sort of dropped on us, in a &#39;if this were actually true the characters should absolutely have done something about it earlier&#39;.<br><br>Relatedly, I&#39;m sure there were some tricks people played with metals which they ought to have been using <i>all the time</i>, but which they only pulled once. I can&#39;t remember specifics, though, and a lot of &#39;one-off&#39; tricks <i>did</i> end up being used over and over.<br><br>But... I liked the setting, and many of the characters, and a lot of the reveals came as a surprise (which is good). The cast felt believably flawed, and I appreciated the fact that, in the latter two books, you didn&#39;t feel that the characters were <i>safe</i> (even from being killed).<br><br>So I honestly don&#39;t know. It&#39;s all very irritating. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a bit since I read them. I don&#39;t remember experiencing any of your frustrations, but I think you read a lot more deeply than I do (and, when I first read them, I did not read as deeply as I do now).<br><br>However, I still heartily recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00540QR7Q/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">followup trilogy</a> that he recently completed, taking place several hundred years later in a 1910&#39;s kind of setting. I believe, at the moment, he&#39;s writing two <i>more</i> after this, one with 80&#39;s tech and the other a space-exploration thing. I love this man. These books are hilarious-- Wayne is definitely in my top ten favorite character list.<br><br>And, one random question: You can burn one metal. What is it?<br><br>-Alleb<br></p>

            <p>Though it may have to wait (maybe until I&#39;ve reread the first trilogy?).<br><br>One metal... hrm. I&#39;m going to discount the higher metals (though gold looks like fun if it&#39;s at all tune-able - &#39;how would I have turned out if I were born in Doriath?&#39;) and just look at the basic eight from the original books. Hmm... while pewter and tin look interesting, I think I&#39;d have to go for either brass or zinc.<br><br>I&#39;m not entirely convinced there&#39;s much difference between them in practical application - sure, a Rioter can provoke anger <i>faster</i>, but a sufficiently skilled Soother can dampen everything except doubt and rage and achieve the same effect in the long run. Likewise, what&#39;s the difference between Soothing away negative emotions and Rioting positive ones? It&#39;s a matter of speed, mostly.<br><br>I guess I&#39;ll burn brass. I can see more applications for immediately Soothing than for immediately Rioting.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: You know I&#39;m a chemist, right?<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/AllomanticTable.png"><br><br>Blue is for allomantic elements, red is the elements they alloy with, black lines show the links.<br><br>-Carbon is the only non-metal used in an allomantic alloy (steel, specifically).<br><br>-Copper and tin are both used as alloy-counterparts, while also being allomantic metals themselves. Copper is actually used in three of the six alloys: duralumin, bronze, and brass.<br><br>-Sanderson seems to have picked his metals based on name-recognition, not any discernable pattern in the periodic table. ^_~ But if you&#39;re hunting for new allomantic metals, check out indium or thallium; they&#39;re right in the middle of the pack.<br><br>hS, still/again<br><br>(PS: Thallium and indium are both highly toxic, so burn them fast! ~hS, third time lucky)</p>

I think Sanderson trained as one as well; at the very least, he describes himself as an armchair scientist, and I believe there&#39;s a &quot;Unifying Theory of Magic&quot; hidden in his work.

            <p>This isn&#39;t on purpose, is it? I already preordered it. If you don&#39;t know what it is, the series is basically this: Red satellite appears in the sky. People, known as &quot;Epics&quot; get superpowers. Most of these people go crazy, and the world falls apart. Fast forward ten years. A guy named David Charleston knows the reason why a supposedly invincible epic has a scar on his face. The series is full of late arrival spoilers. I&#39;ve only read the Alcatraz VS. series and The Rithmatist so far, so I have not read anything related to his Cosmere at all yet.<br><br>How do you make links with a word, not the web address?</p>

            <p>I have to wait until Monday. Say, what do you think would be the mini for the Cosmere? For Alcatraz, it would definitely be a gak, The Rithmatist, maybe a chalking of the subject, and for Steelheart, I have no idea.</p>

            <p>Maybe once we know a bit more about Adonalsium&#39;s home planet, we could pick one, but I think it would be easier to have a separate mini for each Shardworld until then.

            <p>The comments on Steam seem to be overwhelmingly negative - they&#39;re saying that the Chinese expansion:<br><br>a) Consists of copy-pasted units with modified art, not actual unique units. In a game with so few civs, that&#39;s pretty bad.<br><br>b) Has a campaign with serious flaws that make winning very difficult on some levels for arbitrary reasons. Someone was talking about having to keep the enemy &#39;away&#39; from something, without &#39;away&#39; being terribly clear, and an instant-loss if they fail - compare the various capture-the-Osiris-piece missions from the original, which gave you plenty of time to recover from losing control.<br><br>c) Flat-out breaks the game, either by crashing on victory, refusing to load past the opening cinematic, or breaking random maps.<br><br>~<br><br>I&#39;ve also discovered that I don&#39;t have a Zeus game played. What I <i>do</i> have is an attempt to beat the final Titans mission the hard way - by killing Kronos <i>without</i> using Gaia. I&#39;ll see if I can write it up at some point.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Still one of my favorite games.  I loved playing online Senates.  Always very entertaining.  By as far as faction was concerned I always ran Empire.  There was nothing quite as satisfying as launching an attack with two waves of 40+ AT-ATs fully upgraded and loaded with Stormtroopers.  You can almost taste the despair.  Of course that turns into your despair when that massive force utterly shatters on fully upgraded shield walls with a mass of turrets defending it.  That game went from what would have been my greatest victory to my most bitter defeat.</p>

I tend to play on low enough difficulties that I can get away with that (because: I&#39;m not actually very good at RTS games). For that, I like the Rebellion, because (in the expansion, at least) they have A Wings. Extremely fun to muck about with.

            <p>... I have to say that I&#39;m strongest when playing as the Norse.

            <p>I submit for the approval of the Midnight Society, er, I mean the Protectors of the Plot Continuum...<br><br>The bio: Name: Norinj<br>Appearance:  The beak of a rooster, the face of a swallow, the forehead of a fowl, the neck of a snake, the breast of a goose, the back of a tortoise, the hindquarters of a stag and the tail of a fish. Black, white, red, blue, and yellow feathers.<br>Species: Fenghuang<br>Gender: Huang (Female)<br>Universe: I haven’t fully created it yet…<br>Personality: Highly curious about species of mythological creatures from other universes as her world is populated only by mythical things, to the point that she’ll sometimes ask insensitive questions to people she just met. A bit wary of works that have creatures that are entirely good or entirely evil depending on their species (such as Redwall and Lord of the Rings) due to a historical event in her world concerning a republic that had the same mentality. Might have trouble thinking of Mary-Sues as being completely evil. Perhaps should be told that Mary-Sues are to Original Characters what criminals are to ordinary folk.<br>Ability: Flight and sings songs to create facsimiles of people, creatures or even locations which will behave in accordance to their originals’ personalities. For example, “It Doesn’t Matter” will create a reproduction of Sonic the Hedgehog that will strive to protect the innocent and defeat evil. Norinj can even manipulate nearby instruments to play. The summoned can’t affect those who can’t hear them. (Will they work on inanimate objects?) She has to be careful she doesn’t hum, whistle or sing accidentally.<br>History: Hatched in a forest of orange bamboo. Learned the history of her universe at school. She swallowed a rock that she wasn’t aware had special properties for her gizzard, thus making her music magic. She could regurgitate it anytime (and does so occasionally to replace the dull rocks in her gizzard with sharp ones anyway) but she’s afraid of it falling into the wrong hands/talons/paws. She fell into a plothole and fell into the PPC’s headquarters. Went a bit nuts with excitement as she beheld creatures that are considered fictional in her world, such as foxes and humans, and creatures that are different from her home continuum’s, such as trolls and dwarves.<br>Department: Of Mary-Sues?<br><br>The prompt: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XcCcBuoyGoECqjNqIUNFBwF94-aujq97HyYZ6jVvw94/edit"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XcCcBuoyGoECqjNqIUNFBwF94-aujq97HyYZ6jVvw94/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XcCcBuoyGoECqjNqIUNFBwF94-aujq97HyYZ6jVvw94/edit</a></a><br><br>The badfic: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3940868/1/soulless_shell"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3940868/1/soulless_shell">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3940868/1/soulless_shell</a></a><br><br>Would it be okay if I do the second prompt with another author?

            <p>Regardless, it&#39;s better to ask for Permission when you have stuff like... y&#39;know... both prompts put together.<br><br>For your first attempt (I say first because this is too incomplete to really count as an attempt), might I suggest better defining Norinj&#39;s powers? At the moment they seem kind of arbitrary and there&#39;s nothing stopping her from singing and summoning a deus ex machina when you write yourself into a corner. Complete sentences for the bio would also be a good idea.</p>

            <p>...It&#39;s literally just seven paragraphs of your agent talking, with one sentence of her brow furrowing. Not really what we&#39;re looking for at all; we want to know how well you write: dialogue, narration, character interaction, all that good stuff. This doesn&#39;t really showcase anything except your agent telling how she arrived in Headquarters. And, well, you know what they say about showing and not telling.<br><br>Did you have any betas for this, or not?

            <p>For other people to see it.<br><br>As for Norinj, since I can comment on that: <br><br>What else compromises her personality besides &#39;curious to the point of insensitivity about things not native to her universe&#39; and &#39;doesn&#39;t like things painted only in black and white&#39;? This isn&#39;t really a personality. This just tells us two aspects. She can&#39;t be curious <i>all</i> the time, and that can&#39;t be as far as it goes for her, can it? This doesn&#39;t tell us very much about her except that maybe we should be expecting a flurry of questions every time she encounters something new in the PPC, which would be... all the time.<br><br>As for the ability: You say her singing creates fascimiles that behave like the originals. This is... a strange poewr, to say the least. Why would, using your example, &quot;It Doesn&#39;t Matter&quot; produce a copy of Sonic? Does she even know who Sonic is, or the canon? Does it create copies and versions of characters when she doesn&#39;t even know who they are? How does it create copies of locations? Is HQ at risk of somehow having a wide spath of the cafeteria suddenly replaced with part of, say, Rivendell? Or a part of Hogwarts? And she can use it to manipulate instruments? <br><br>This ability confuses me in multiple ways, and seems like it could be rather overpowered, besides the fact that it seems rather... out of place overall for the PPC. <br><br>As for the second prompt, it&#39;s best to get that sort of thing arranged with someone else prior to asking for permission. <br><br>-July</p>

            <p>I did like your approach to your character, letting her tell the story in her own voice.  Is she the type who&#39;s likely to just randomly talk about herself, or start monologing(sp?) that to anyone who asks?<br><br>Maybe you could have her type up a journal?  Try at least 1000 words worth of entries, the most interesting excerpts over a couple of months.  It might just end up as &quot;for your own reference&quot; or it might be publishable when you get permission.<br><br>I hope you get her fleshed out better.</p>

            <p>While you haven&#39;t (that I&#39;ve noticed) named the particular disability you&#39;ve been talking about, the particular way you have been communicating implies that you may be autistic. I apologize if this assumption is wrong; however, as it is the most plausible one I have, I am posting the rest of this post under that assumption.<br><br>So... hi, fellow autist. I only wish this could be under better circumstances. And... yeah, I&#39;m a bit angry with you too, which I am only stating in case this gets into a &quot;but you *agreed* with me&quot; situation -- unlikely, yes, but I have always felt the need to prepare for unlikely circumstances.<br><br>Anyway, I have a from-personal-experience piece of advice for you: don&#39;t respond to criticism, constructive or not, immediately. I&#39;ll freely note that I used to get cry-y just getting typos pointed out to me. I also got... well, defensive isn&#39;t quite the right word -- more &quot;ready to just up and delete whatever it was so that people aren&#39;t mad at me.&quot; I managed to get over that last part, eventually, but it was a long and grueling experience. Honestly, the PPC helped me a lot. It&#39;s okay if it&#39;s not the place for you, but even just taking the badfics the PPC missions as &#39;what not to do&#39; lists helped a great deal.

What I&#39;m saying is that I have some personal experience with what&#39;s going on here. For me it went like &quot;frantically try to appease person, get embarrassed, abandon/delete fic, regret everything.&quot; It, well... looks like your response is to get angry at people. Now, I&#39;m not saying that automatically makes you a bad person. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a bad person.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m possibly getting off-topic. I know it probably seems like you *have* to respond to criticism immediately. But for people like us, whose first reactions are probably not the reactions we&#39;d like to have... take some time to wait. I don&#39;t know how much time -- my guideline was &quot;wait until the tight, terrified feeling in your stomach goes away, or at the very least until the crying stops.&quot; It&#39;s helped me handle things much better, and I don&#39;t have the same &quot;visceral terror&quot; reaction to people not liking something anymore. (There&#39;s a thing I figured out, which basically feels like holding my brain steady, but there are no words in the English language to describe how it works and so I cannot usefully share that.)<br><br>I hope I have helped.<br><br>-- TheShyIon</p>

            <p>Seconding what TheShyIon said about not responding to criticism immediately. I&#39;d like to add that this does not only apply to autistic people -- example, me. I&#39;m not autistic and I can react really emotionally to criticism. So even if TheShyIon&#39;s guess about you being autistic is off, you should listen to her.</p>

            <p>For one, if Kelly doesn&#39;t feel passionate enough about fandoms that are popular enough to have fanfiction...then why is she in the PPC? The PPC is all about protecting canon from bad fanfic, preserving canon as it should be. Badfic is the norm that everyone deals with in some way or another, whether tht be slaying Sues, taking care of Suvian offspring and raisng them to not be like mommy and daddy, or whatever. It&#39;s like going into, say, engineering without being interested in engineering. It makes no sense.<br><br>Also, with the bear - interesting idea, but one flaw. There is no ways bears can sneak like what I assume you mean her to sneak for. I&#39;m assuming that Kelly is in the DMS, so yeah, sneaking is a needed ability, but bears aren&#39;t that quiet. Far from what&#39;s required. Hide, probably. Sneak, no way, unless she picked a good D.O.R.K.S. form and trained extensively in that to sneak well.</p>

            <p>Okay, your agent bio pages give me a few things that are eyebrow raising.<br><br>To start with, Kelly. You say she&#39;s aloof and guarded. She secretly cares about her partners. That&#39;s... it? We don&#39;t get much more? Your personality bit is just a few traits thrown together and don&#39;t really tell us how she acts or reacts to things. I could cut off the bit that tells us she reads trashy romance and it suddenly applies to a good deal of agents. <br><br>Why/how would Kelly have her sister&#39;s family just up and moved to a different continuum? Do they not have an extended family that would presumbly wonder where they went? Or her brother-in-law&#39;s family? Did her sister and b-i-l not have any say in the matter? This is a random thing that doesn&#39;t really... tell us anything. <br><br>Neuralyzer-immunity granting implants- I admit, it&#39;s been well over a decade since I watched the MiB cartoon, but I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t remember anything like that being canonical or even suggestibly canonical; the neuralyzer is pretty much the go-to tool in the MiB canons for preserving the secret that aliens are on Earth. The Ben 10 universe also has no real reason to negate such a thing- the Plumbers exist for a reason. <br><br>The agents who recruited her could have very easily had it removed or used any other alternative method to erase her memories and toss her back into her home-fic. <br><br>There&#39;s also a difference between being irreligious and <i>telling off Aslan</i>, who in his canon, most certainly exists and generally doesn&#39;t do anything to actually deserve being told off by a random PPC agent.  <br><br>Injerd: Why does she have two names? Why the mention of usually a beard in disguise? You did not tell us much at all in this tiny bio. <br><br>Agent TBD: Holy macaroni, was that the general alarm I heard on the boat just now? Nope, it was just me reading this part:<br><br>&#39;The rest of her personality will be determined once I’ve figured out how to build the perfect agent.&#39;<br><br><i>The perfect agent does not exist</i>. <br><br>This last one alone tells me you don&#39;t quite understand what we do with character creation as far as the PPC goes, if you make characters wholecloth for the setting.<br><br>As far as your stories go:<br><br>You have SpaG. Well done. There&#39;s a general forward movement in the writing, which indicates you have an understanding of time and movement.<br><br>Buuut you don&#39;t really show or do anything in the stories themselves. The characters show no real fleshing out. They actually seem kind of... boring, to be honest. <br><br>Random note about the first story with Agent TBD: I am currently wearing the blouse for a Navy Working Uniform right now in fact. I&#39;m not entirely sure what you&#39;re going for with that sentence about it having faded first prior to dying. Is it because it&#39;s implied to be old? Because it doesn&#39;t work that way. Which is to say, if I were to take a brand new one, and shove it into one of the washers on the ship with a black dye packet it would turn it completely black without having to wait for it to fade (which would happen if I decided to just stand outside in the desert sun for a few hours. Easy peasy.). I would also gain some enemies in the Supply Department, but that is beside the point. Please both research things you include- because it will make people go &#39;...No?&#39; upon reading if they actually know the item in question- and make sure that you are clear about what you are talking about.<br><br>Lastly...<br><br>While I cannot speak <i>for</i> others, I did hear that you were giving others a difficult time when you asked for assistance with working on your characters and writing samples for asking for permission. <br><br>As a community, when people ask for help, we are all generally willing to give it if we have the time. <br><br>That said, it&#39;s incredibly frustrating when that advice gets ignored or tossed out; when that happens the result is people are generally less inclined to work with said person in the future when they ask for help again. <br><br>Boarders are not some mechanical tool to use to check something and then ignore if the results are not to your liking. <br><br>All that said,<br><br>Permission denied.<br><br>-July</p>

I did admit to getting annoyed at him and Iximaz for giving me a hard time about asking for help and having problems with the prompts.<br><br>I apologize if I didn&#39;t do enough to acknowledge that I was considering advice.  And perhaps I missed something that got lost in the chat.

            <p>When we pointed out your characters were breaking the fourth wall more than Deadpool, you got snippy and insisted it was because you were forcing your characters to do things they wouldn&#39;t do, completely ignoring the fact that nobody was forcing <i>you</i> to write them like that. It&#39;s not our fault you interpreted the prompts in such a rigid way.<br><br>It&#39;s a crying shame we don&#39;t have the original chat logs to compare, but I think your attitude <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=290813;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a> showcases it perfectly. You were demanding, and you threw a tantrum when we said no. And the more you demand and continue to insult people, the less likely you are to get the Permission process altered for you.<br><br>Considering how defensive you became when the other PGs pointed out everything that was wrong with your Permission attempt? Yeah, I&#39;d say you&#39;re pretty angry we&#39;re not heaping praise onto you, which I find pretty ironic considering you&#39;re accusing me and Des of demanding praise for looking over your work. <br><br>All of this coupled with your multiple insincere-sounding &#39;apologies&#39; means I am not and will not be apologizing to you.</p>

            <p>I really hope you didn&#39;t, but.<br><br>You have just used an analogy which goes disabled person::society, gay person::homophobic boss, you::PPC. You have at the very least implied that Boarders - many of whom are neuroatypical in one way or another - are being as horrible and oppressive to you as a homophobic boss. This is not an OK thing to say, because many of the PPCers have to deal with that in their own lives.<br><br>Is that a clear enough explanation as to why you need to apologize for that analogy, right now? Because that is genuinely a painful thing to say to someone, and maybe you didn&#39;t think it all the way through, but either way you need to apologize for that.</p>

            <p>Maybe this will be clearer. Expecting someone to follow a certain standard of civility is not the same as expecting everyone to be conformist droids, it&#39;s basic don&#39;t-be-a-jerk-to-people. <br><br>The issue so far has been that you have been saying hurtful things, the rest of us have been saying &quot;Hey that&#39;s hurtful, maybe apologize&quot; and then you saying &quot;Well I have a disability, therefore it&#39;s ableist to expect me to know what&#39;s hurtful.&quot; To which many of us have said &quot;Wow, ok, it&#39;s kind of bad to use disability as an excuse for that instead of apologizing, especially since many of us are also disabled, and you still haven&#39;t given us any sort of apology.&quot; And now you are saying &quot;OK, tell me what you want to hear so that I can fake being the sort of person who does not say those sorts of thing (while still actually being the sort of person who says that kind of thing.)&quot;<br><br>This is how a lot of us have seen the last day or two of conversation. Does that make it <i>any</i> clearer why your behavior is not good right now?</p>

            <p>Alright, what more are you looking for in a bio?  I had a list of Kelly&#39;s tropes, but I didn&#39;t write them down.  There&#39;s a lot of stuff that I won&#39;t know until it&#39;s actually important.  I could try to fill out one of those character charts for her, but I&#39;m one of those people that don&#39;t get much useful information from them.<br><br>I felt that moving Kelly&#39;s immediate family would fix any issues of her home story dissolving back into the MIB canon.  I could work with that element, or just have it so she can&#39;t go home again.  I also had an alternate-universe story in the works where she was rejected from the PPC but managed to get relocated in the Muppet Verse.  I admit that it was part of a &quot;take that&quot; against her dealing with unusual situations, and I apologize for getting angry about it.<br><br>I&#39;m thinking that since neuralysers can be blocked by brand-name sunglasses, an alien could have the technology to duplicate that effect invisibly.  Plus, I seem to recall some agent who came from a space-magic anime getting recruited because her uncanonical computer-book still followed canon rules.  The implants are a non-issue unless I go back to Kelly&#39;s early days.<br><br>I&#39;m calling random incompetence in the name of funny for why the agents didn&#39;t get her sent back to her home universe.  Or that page about vacations, where the agents hoped for some time off if Kelly was added to the labor pool.<br><br>I might have used irreligious wrong.  Telling off Aslan, there is probably a workable story in that.  Jesus doesn&#39;t seem like the type that would smite people just for rejecting him.  It&#39;s like the Susan problem.<br><br>Ingeborg is an alternate name for Injerd.  Frankly, I just started with the joke and plan to go from there.  I did mention that I write like Tolkien, where I start writing without actually knowing what I am doing.<br><br>TBD: Yes, she does have some traits that could become Sueish if I am not careful.  I included her because she would raise alarm bells.<br><br>The Dollhouse is in the business of creating a perfect person based on the criteria their client specifies.  If your perfect date includes a fencing match, then the Active will know how to fence.  <br><br>What makes the perfect agent might just be a horribly broken model based on what someone&#39;s idea of a perfect agent is.  In one of the early episodes, Echo was made into a perfect hostage negotiator, that included asthma and the need for glasses because the flaws were part of the persona.<br><br>My research about the NWU: My spouse complained about getting new pants and having to get a new blouse because it faded and clashed too badly.  My spouse went days without going outside.  The fading with TBD&#39;s hand-me-down implies that the blouse was too old to be worn as part of a Navy uniform.  The dying it black is from spouse&#39;s comments on how tacky it looks when civilian contractors prefer to keep wearing their NWU pants, and how spouse wants theirs to be dyed black if they become a contractor.<br><br>Those NWU&#39;s are nice fabric, and softer than denim even when they are new.  I was allowed to try one on for a few minutes in private.  I was told that wearing a discarded uniform improperly had levels of acceptability depending on how close the nearest base was.<br><br>And lastly is going to be another post.<br><br></p>

I&#39;m not sure you read that at all.<br><br>In Ari&#39;s recruitment, the <i>issue</i> was that the Book of Dawn was essentially indestructible from the outside, and that if Ari was killed it would respawn and do Bad Things to the canon in years, causing a huge mess for everyone involved. Ari was given the option of joining the PPC, which she took, and the Book was promptly confiscated and Ari didn&#39;t get back until it was very thoroughly de-glittered.<br><br>So, the situations are different, because I very much doubt that your Kelly&#39;s death would lead to an unkillable uncanonical glitter-consumer of worlds appearing... somewhere. </p>

            <p>That&#39;s the thing. I&#39;m not looking for a list of her <i>tropes</i>. If what you give us is that, it doesn&#39;t tell us anything about her pesonality. I could very easily list a bunch of agents who fall under that first section of &#39;personality&#39; you gave and they&#39;re all entirely different with entirely different personalities. A couple of them are even possibly into reading trashy romance! Who knows!<br><br>When fics dissolve into canon, it doesn&#39;t explicitly <i>erase</i> everything. Things that are uncanon, explicitly against canon, those things go poof. Things that could exist in canon? Just blur back into it. There are more than a few fanfics out there in all sorts of fandom that can easily coexist with with the canon they are based on, without overwriting anything. <br><br>There&#39;s a very, very simple reason for why neuralyzers can be blocked by sunglasses: it&#39;s a very bright light. If you use (what are presumably UV filtering) sunglasses or similar, it prevents it from working on the people who are looking into the light. There is a reason why in MIB they get the attention of people who weren&#39;t supposed to see whatever it is and get them with the flash while their eyes are open. There&#39;s no need to overcomplicate things.<br><br>&#39;Random incompetence&#39; here isn&#39;t in the name of funny. I saw nothing funny about it. It came off more as &#39;here&#39;s a poor excuse&#39;. <br><br>If she doesn&#39;t favor Narnia- by means of being uncomfortable with the setting&#39;s base to that extent- the Flowers would not actually have her working in fics from that universe. They have plenty of canon-knowledgable agents who would not go out of their way to yell at Aslan; the same goes for other canons. <br><br>As for... The alternate name thing, that doesn&#39;t work. You cannot do those sort of things just because. Tolkein didn&#39;t start writing without knowing what he was doing; the resultant works we have today outside of LotR and the Hobbit have alternate names and the like because he was still <i>working</i> on them before he died. They were incomplete. His son left it as such when he was trying to compile everything into fuller works. <br><br>Her traits are straight up Sueish. The Perfect Agent does Not Exist. Cannot exist. Would not be able to exist. <br><br>As for the NWUs: Yes, they fade. And when the blouse is more faded than the top, it can cause some issues. This is generally alleviated by not using certaind detergents, not standing in the sun for hours on end, and keeping the same sets paired together so they&#39;re at least evenly faded. Your spouse&#39;s comments on the tackiness are their own.  <br><br>They are nice fabric, I will agree, but they also can tear like nothing else when abused in the wrong way.  </p>

            <p>Alright, Kelly&#39;s backstory could easily be that they observed her dealing with a roomful of weird aliens and thought that she&#39;d fit in as an agent.<br><br>In her previous life, her boss could have just re-educated her every time she was neuralyzed because there&#39;s no canonical way to recover lost memories.  I just wanted to give her the choice of a special power at a cost and show that she preferred not to take the deal.<br><br>Kelly did not go out of her way to yell at Aslan.  I don&#39;t know what happened yet, but it was probably the first clue that she shouldn&#39;t be working in that world.<br><br>The alternate name thing has nothing to do with the Tolkien stuff.  I do see how you could see it that way.  Her alternate name was in case the Injerd joke turned out to be completely un-funny.<br><br>Tolkien might have still been working on Lord of the Rings when he died in 1973, (he was working on a revision in 1965) but Wikipedia says that it was published by 1955.

            <p>I&#39;m not telling your spouse how to dress or what to wear as far as uniform goes. I&#39;m no khaki, I&#39;m no JO or wannabe. I&#39;m just a seaman. I don&#39;t control their command or how their divo or department head runs things. <br><br>I agreeed that they fade, and it can happen without sunlight.

This is my space, where I don&#39;t have to deal with the general flavor of lunacy that goes with being in the military and dealing with people who think that marrying military means they carry their spouse&#39;s rank or importance, too. <br><br>I&#39;m not replying to any of your other points because they&#39;re all wrong and can be easily refuted by someone else.<br><br>I&#39;m done speaking to you.</p>

            <p>I should have said something earlier, but I&#39;ll just say it now. I&#39;m very, very disappointed in the direction this thread took. The Constitution explicitly states we don&#39;t assume harmful intent. Bramandin, several times, said they have a disability and are trying to apologize, and BEFORE the thread got heated, people got incredibly aggressive, dogpiled them, and essentially started bullying. <br><br>I&#39;d like you all to maybe reread your comments here, after giving a couple days to cool down. I&#39;m shocked and frankly appalled at how quick we are these days to assume a newbie is being a jerk, rather than misunderstanding. <br><br>Another point, more specific: July, you do not own the military, you do not own the Navy, and you do not own the &#39;Board as your (and not others&#39;) safe space. Your experience is not the same as Bramandin&#39;s spouses, nor as Bramandin&#39;s, but that does not make their experience less legitimate or less true than yours, and this response was not at all justified. <br><br>If there are so many issues with Bramandin&#39;s application (which, by the way, I agree with - the underlying issue is a character is not the same as a bundle of tropes), there&#39;s no reason to slam them for having a different perspective than you. What the hell. </p>

            <p>I brought the blouse up because within the sample it made no sense to me, given that I actually wear the thing. I was asking for further information on it, because hey, you don&#39;t have to have it faded for it to be dyed, was it old or something?<br><br>Their response was their spouse talking about uneven fading and difference in uniform colors and their spouse thinking it looks tacky when contractors still wear parts of their old uniform items. <br><br>I agreed that yes, they can fade like that, and that it can be alleviated by keeping uniforms paired together by fadedness. I said their spouse&#39;s comments on tackiness are their own because said opinions are. They aren&#39;t shared by the contractors who had to pay for those uniform items when they were still in and are still wearing them. I don&#39;t have strong opinions on the matter. <br><br>That is the point at which Bramandin went:<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll tell spouse that having a uniform that clashes with the rest of the line isn&#39;t tacky because you said so, nevermind what any of the shipmates may say.&quot;<br><br>This was condescending. This was rude. That was going &quot;My spouse knows more than you and I&#39;m going to tell them someone on the internet thinks they&#39;re dumb&quot; when I hadn&#39;t said anything of the kind. <br><br>This was already after they had told Huinesoron that he doesn&#39;t know as much about Tolkien as they did.  <br><br>At no point did I even approach implying that my word was god, because as far as I was concerned, the matter was still the NWUs and others wearing them- not on Bramandin&#39;s spouse looking bad or anything.<br><br>I know damned well I don&#39;t own the military or the navy, much less the board, and I certainly don&#39;t act like it. I said outright in my reply that I&#39;m no one&#39;s boss when it comes to the military side. <br><br>That said? <br><br>I still am not going to put up with being consecended to by someone who thinks only being married to a sailor means they get to tell me what&#39;s the what militarywise. Everyone&#39;s views differ, you&#39;re right. But in all my responses I tried to <i>not</i> get baited by everything Bramandin said, and my question on something that I know and recognize was not out of place. Their reactions were, because at that point nothing had gotten too far out of hand.  <br><br>I qualified the &#39;my space&#39; statement for a reason. The PPC is pretty much the only non-military space I&#39;ve got these days, and while I bring it up time to time, it&#39;s not something I want to allow to dominate my time on the board, and certainly not with anything petty like that. <br><br>Or am I not allowed to have any escape?<br><br>I realized my end of things were getting heated, and I quit the conversation. I haven&#39;t responded. I&#39;ve told other people, in email, to calm down. I&#39;ve told other people to not jump in for the sake of jumping in.<br><br>And you?<br><br>You don&#39;t get to tell me that my response wasn&#39;t justified. <br><br>All you seem to do these days if I get involved in anything, or bring anything up is to step in and tell me whatever I said was uncalled for, that I was trying to be an authority for no reason. <br><br>I try to avoid stirring up trouble. All the stuff that happened in the past I avoid bringing up unless I feel it&#39;s relevant to the situation at hand, because I don&#39;t want it impacting the current state of the board, probably more than anyone else.<br><br>We say in the Constitution that we&#39;re supposed to not assume harmful intent, and you state it right in this post of yours.<br><br>You&#39;ve been assuming harmful intent on my part for years, and I&#39;m getting sick and tired of it. <br><br>Whenever you step in on things, it&#39;s generally to attack or belittle me, or say that whatever I said was ill willed. Out of step. Out of line. No matter what the other party said, or did. Even if I chose to step out before things got too or I&#39;m not stooping to any of the behaviors the other party is. You condescend. And it&#39;s always directed, primarily, at me.<br><br>What happened to you?</p>

            <p>I realized, as soon as I posted it, that who I was really angry with was Iximaz, not you. I apologize for posting that as a reply to you; it should have gone to the other parts of the thread, it was unfair to make it all about you. I did see your telling Bramandin that their spouse&#39;s opinion didn&#39;t count, and if you didn&#39;t mean it like that, I apologize for misconstruing.<br><br>Mostly, if you want me to be honest, I remember you saying, often, that your role was to be blunt and shut people down when others were too polite to do so, and I still read that into your posts. Most of the time I don&#39;t read them at all, because I&#39;m hoping that&#39;s not the case anymore, but I still get that familiar stab of fear and anxiety, regardless. And if they are, I don&#39;t have the guts or the inclination to get into it anymore, anyway.<br><br>You can have whatever space you like. Again, this is me responding badly to things that remind me of a certain handful of people around here (and elsewhere; this is a problem not exclusive to PPC space, I understand) who used &quot;safe space&quot; as a way to say &quot;Anything that I disagree with is an attack on my opinion/feelings, and hence unsafe.&quot; Again, I realize now that you were saying nothing of the sort, and I do apologize for my short fuse on the subject. It&#39;s become such a common shorthand that I react badly.<br><br>As a general rule, I don&#39;t reply to you . . . pretty much ever, mostly even if I do think you&#39;re wrong. Precisely because of the history there, with IRC, with Data, Maslab, Miah, etc. I know full well I haven&#39;t let it go, again, because I have a stab of anxiety every time I see something like this come up. So I try to just avoid you, and avoid conflict unless it&#39;s something serious. But occasionally, I see someone being dogpiled in a manner that seems incredibly bullying, and feel I should say something. I <i>absolutely should not have said it to you</i>. I wasn&#39;t paying enough attention to context, jumped to conclusions, assumed harmful intent, and was overall a dick. I&#39;m sorry for that.<br><br>As to what happened to me - someone I considered a friend was manipulative towards me and others, and lashed out at me repeatedly, until I stopped trusting them, stopped considering them a friend, and eventually stopped giving them the benefit of the doubt. It&#39;s not entirely your fault; someone else did this same thing at about the same time everything went so wrong here, and I think, in hindsight, I&#39;m projecting the fallout from both relationships onto you, since I no longer interact with him.<br><br>Tl;dr - you&#39;re right, I&#39;ve been a jerk, and I&#39;m sorry.<br><br>I stand by what I said about dogpiling, bullying, assuming the worst, and GOOD LORD the disability conversation, what the heck is going on here, but you are absolutely right that you deserved none of that, and I apologize.</p>

            <p>I definitely wasn&#39;t trying to imply their spouse&#39;s opinion didn&#39;t count; thus the agreement about the fading. It&#39;s a problem with the fabric. The &#39;contractors shouldn&#39;t wear NWUs&#39; is a hot topic sort of issue. Some people feel very strongly on the matter. I was mostly just trying to avoid that in the first place because I don&#39;t have strong opinions on people wearing them after they get out. It&#39;s just a weird thing in general that can&#39;t really get explained properly, I guess.<br><br>As for what I used to say: Blunt is not the same thing as rude or insulting. Not always. I try to not be rude. The same thing with insults. Being straightforward isn&#39;t the same as being a jerk, and I try to avoid the latter. I&#39;m sorry that my posts give you a spike of anxiety.<br><br>I agree that the phrase &#39;safe space&#39; has been overused and in many ways invalidated; disagreement isn&#39;t unsafe or inherently unhealthy. Using it as such destroys the ability for there to be real safe spaces for people who need it.<br><br>As for everything that happened before with the IRC: I&#39;ve noticed. I do similar myself, because it&#39;s better to avoid it instead of giving opportunity for things to get rehashed again, and again, and again. It&#39;s not healthy for the people involved or the community.  <br><br>About the other person you had a falling out with: I know I don&#39;t know the whole story, but I think I remember the person you&#39;re talking about, since you had brought them up fairly often when we were still talking (if it is indeed the same person, which I suspect) and I&#39;m very sorry that happened. It sucks when that sort of thing happens. It can screw things up for years. <br><br>I do agree that there was an awful lot of dogpiling going on; I was planning on saying something this morning (for me, I&#39;m currently 10~ hours ahead of the US, give or take a few), before I saw your reply to me. <br><br>Thank you for the apology. It means a lot. I had treasured our friendship quite a bit when we had it.<br><br>-July</p>

            <p>Bramandin, I&#39;m operating under the assumption that you sincerely want to apologize, but don&#39;t quite understand why it&#39;s not working and everyone is upset. If you&#39;re actually using sarcasm on purpose, I shall be very upset that I wasted my time trying to help, so I hope that&#39;s not the case.<br><br>Lemme take this one piece at a time:<br><br>1.1. <i>I am sorry for holding my spouse&#39;s point of view as truth. For thinking that I know anything because of being a spouse.</i><br><br>The trouble with this is that it&#39;s quite reasonable to assume that your spouse is telling the truth, so nobody would blame you for that. Apologizing for something that isn&#39;t actually wrong sounds false.<br><br>1.2. <i>I am ignorant even thought I&#39;m the one who sews his patches on if I&#39;m visiting when it needs to be done.</i><br><br>Here you&#39;re qualifying your apology. Perhaps you think you&#39;re just explaining your thought process, but what we read into it is this: &quot;I am saying what I think you want to hear, even though, because of [this fact], I don&#39;t actually believe I&#39;m wrong and I will therefore continue to think and behave exactly the same as I have been.&quot;<br><br>I don&#39;t know anything about the military, military uniforms, or the culture of military spouses, so I&#39;ll say nothing about that.<br><br>So, that&#39;s how NOT to apologize.<br><br>What you SHOULD apologize for is the offense, insult, and/or hurt feelings you&#39;ve given. You SHOULD say that you will remember what others have told you is offensive/hurtful to them—repeating what you&#39;ve been told in your own words is helpful so that people know whether or not you do understand—and promise to avoid repeating those mistakes in the future.<br><br>It&#39;s fine to explain what led you to make the mistake, but nobody actually wants you to apologize for those circumstances. They just want you to acknowledge that you offended or hurt them and let them know that you respect them enough to not purposefully do it again.<br><br>I hope that clears things up and that I haven&#39;t given you the benefit of the doubt in vain.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

Especially tenaflyviper&#39;s brilliant addition, part of which I will quote below to emphasize the point I wish to make. (The original has explicit language, which I&#39;ve censored here, but the point is the same.)<br><br><blockquote>
<br>IF YOU WEREN’T DIAGNOSED WITH IT BY A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL, STOP [BLEEP]ING CLAIMING THAT YOU HAVE IT.  AND STOP PRETENDING TO BE VICTIMS WHENEVER PEOPLE RIGHTFULLY CRITICIZE YOU, OR USING CONDITIONS YOU DON’T EVEN [BLEEP]ING HAVE TO TRY TO GET OUT OF TAKING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR YOUR OWN POOR BEHAVIOR.  Illnesses and disorders aren’t a [BLEEP]ing country club.  You can’t just demand your way into them just so you can feel “oppressed” out of your own privileged guilt.  Stop lowering the value of others’ genuine suffering just because you crave sympathy-based attention.<br><br><b>IF YOU WANT SO DESPERATELY TO FEEL “SPECIAL”, <i>GROW A [BLEEP]ING PERSONALITY.</i><b><br></b></b>

            <p>Guess what! Self-diagnoses can be accurate as well! Sure, some people are looking for attention, but a ton more people either can&#39;t afford to see a doctor, or for various legal reasons don&#39;t want diagnoses on their records (guess how many legal barriers can jump up to stop autistic people from adopting kids, and that&#39;s just an example off the top of my head.) If you do your research right, there&#39;s no reason why a self-diagnoses can&#39;t be just as accurate as a doctor-given one, and frankly a lot of the time those official diagnoses amount to &#39;hey doc I think I have this thing&#39; &#39;hm take this questionnaire/wait while I look it up, ok yeah that sounds right.&#39;<br><br>In short?

            <p>Reading this whole fiasco, and especially this particular portion regarding mental disorders, made me irrationally angry and as someone with Aspergers who DOESN&#39;T use it as an excuse to bargain out of my own mistakes, I couldn&#39;t stop myself trying to have a say in this. The keyword being trying, because part of the reason that I never get involved in Internet drama is because I know that literally anything and everything I say can and will backfire on me in some way (as it did here).<br><br>You also bring up a very good point regarding self-diagnosing - it&#39;s just that the cases where people &quot;self-diagnose&quot; just to get attention stand out more and make people automatically assume that ALL such instances, legit or no, are for that purpose alone. That was the very mistake I made just now, and I apologize for that as well.<br><br>And yes, the irony that I rashly quoted Tumblr in response to a drama that wouldn&#39;t have looked out of place on the seedier side of that site is not lost on me.</p>

            <p>That does not change my sentiment that Bramadin&#39;s refusal to apologize in general is wrong, however. I won&#39;t get involved in this any further from now on, but I won&#39;t be surprised if they ultimately get at least temporarily banned if they keep behaving like this, either. Bram really does need some time to think about what they&#39;ve been doing.</p>

            <p>Your sarcastic apologies do not help your cause. Your mental disability is not an excuse for passive-aggressiveness or insulting other people. Your actions aren&#39;t non-conformist, they&#39;re insulting, rude and... I should probably stop with this now. &quot;You&#39;re not trying hard enough&quot; — because you clearly aren&#39;t, not because of ableism in my part; if I was actually ableist I&#39;d have to level the same charge at, for example, Silenthunder when she wrote her first mission (FYI, Iximaz, DawnFire and I gave her three pages of concrit, which she actually responded very well to and improved her mission greatly). <br>Frankly, I&#39;m not looking for praise. I&#39;m trying to get you to understand that you&#39;re insulting other people — I&#39;ve lost count on how many toes you&#39;ve stepped; mine, Iximaz&#39;s, Firemagic&#39;s, July&#39;s, Huinesoron&#39;s, Scapegrace&#39;s...

            <p>Sorry, I was being deliberately ignorant to agree with a point.  I get a very &quot;agree with me or else&quot; vibe here.<br><br>---------------------<br><br>In the first two episodes of the second season of Dollhouse, it was discussed how Dollhouse technology could make a complete person within parameters.

I wouldn&#39;t want too many agents to be subjected to that, but I wanted to introduce an extreme case that would be a candidate for that sort of treatment.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve always been very adamant that FicPsych can&#39;t simply hand someone a personality, both in-universe and out. {= )<br><br>That said, I have seen <i>Dollhouse</i> and I understand what Bramandin is trying to do. But I agree with Sergio: FicPsych wouldn&#39;t do it. It&#39;s too close to what the LMSF do, and it runs counter to what Dr. Freedenberg has said in-character about personality coming with experience.

            <p>Nowadays, using actual canon character is pretty frowned upon, as... well, they&#39;re not our characters.<br><br>What actually <i>can</i> happen is to recruit a Character Replacement that has chances of redempiton - they&#39;re fairly rare though, but them looking for a life of their own while trying to cast off their &quot;previous identity&quot; makes for good character development. Still, they have to be their own person in all respects, not just a carbon copy of a canon character.</p>

            <p>Tolkien was first and foremost creating languages, and the world and mythos that would support and result in such languages.<br><br>As for the items you are describing, any writer can tell you that they&#39;re common enough items. <br><br>Things change with each draft of a story- details get refined, things get moved around so that the whole story moves better as a whole. The first draft is usually the roughest- while you have an idea of what you want, you don&#39;t necessarily know how it will <i>happen</i> because you have to work out all the details so that the story is consistent, and that everything set within is resolved as appropriate. <br><br>Changing what a line is going to say, and who is the actor within a line is nothing new, again- things change, perhaps this character or that one instead will suit it better or had not recieved as much focus. <br><br>People are more than allowed to change their plans, or heaven forbid, be unsure what projects they will work on, and the details of such. I just restarted a story I&#39;m working on because I realized that a different angle would suit my goals and intents with said story better; not because I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. The same would certainly go with Tolkein, and even more so with him.<br><br>Authors have the fiat and author- (heh) -ity when it comes to their works. There are all sort of paths to getting there, and those often change, but it doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t know what they are doing, even if they are actually making it up as they go along for the first draft, instead of having things plotted out.  </p>

            <p>I called it hand-holding because you spent a good ten minutes complaining that the prompts didn&#39;t offer you enough guidance. Me suggesting you try it the old way was completely rhetorical: as I explained multiple times, the only &#39;prompt&#39; you got was &quot;Write something about 400 words long&quot;. If you think the current prompts didn&#39;t give you enough guidance, I&#39;d say that&#39;s about as hand-holdy as you can get.<br><br>When you changed track and started insisting the prompts were too restrictive... well, I&#39;m not you.

            <p>This chat happened in a Google doc, right? Then there&#39;s basically no way to recover logs. <br><br>Also, write anything to showcase agents in a funny way - why isn&#39;t that something you could do as a normal prompt? Writing humor is pretty important, and a lot of the setups in the prompts are for joke material. So what&#39;s the problem?<br><br>Ok, that neurotypical model thing? Stop. Believe it or not, a lot of PPCers have neurodivergence one way or another, and guess what, they shouldn&#39;t have to out themselves and their diagnoses to get it through someone&#39;s head that they know what they&#39;re talking about. And someone refusing to do so is not a reason to say that they just don&#39;t understand what they are saying. <br><br><br></p>

            <p>One of the agents gets a new partner.<br><br>In {RC number,} Kelly was lounging in an office chair and reading “The Giver.”  She thought that the book was alright, but it wasn’t something that she would have chosen.  She really didn’t feel passionately about anything that was popular enough to have fanfiction, so she mostly dealt in canons where their departments were overwhelmed, or where no one had admitted to liking them.<br><br>The console [bip]ed, and Kelly read the message.  She was happy that she wouldn’t have to be without a partner for too long this time, though also a little bit disappointed that she was losing her last one.  She had actually hoped that he would beat the statistics, but she knew that there was always something that could go wrong.  <br><br>There was a heavy knock at the door, and Kelly answered it.  A grizzly bear was sitting in the middle of the hallway in front of her door.  If it had been standing upright, it probably would have been between eight or nine feet tall.  It had a gruff female voice.  “I am Injerd.”<br><br>“Do you need me to open a portal to Medical?”  Kelly knew that there were intelligent beasts running around Headquarters, and she had dealt with far stranger than that even before she joined the PPC.<br><br>The bear shook her head.  “My name is Injerd.  You may also call me Ingeborg or simply Ing if you must.  Someone in orientation thought that it would be funny to introduce myself by saying ‘I am.’  I was told that I was assigned to {RC}.” <br><br>Kelly glanced at the plate on her door just in case her number had been changed again.  She didn’t mind working with an animal, despite what happened last time.  “Come on in.  My name’s Kelly Stone.”<br><br>Injerd rocked forward and then walked through the door on all fours.  She then looked at the couch and took a seat in front of the bookcase instead.<br><br>“I’ve just got to pack up my last partner’s stuff,” Kelly said, grabbing a cardboard box.<br><br>“What happened to him?” Ing asked.<br><br>“It was a mistake,” Kelly said dismissively, though she felt a bit guilty.  Once she had learned that zabvronians gain nourishment from reading, she should have realized that he shouldn’t have been looking at the words in a bad grammar fic.  Kelly just hoped that Mike Ditka would recover from his equivalent of food poisoning eventually.<br>  <br>Kelly then smiled.  “Why don’t you tell me about yourself so I can get to know you better?”  She wasn’t really curious about Ing’s personal life, but the more she knew about her new partner, the more likely it was that she could make up for any of her shortcomings.<br><br>“I come from Narnia.  I was but a cub when King Peter and his siblings disappeared.”  Ing paused.  “The details of my life are hard to remember, as if they’re from a dream.”<br><br>Kelly wasn’t too concerned.  She knew that some people didn’t have much of a past to work with.  “Do you know how to hide and sneak around?  What about fighting?”<br><br>Ing paused a moment before answering.  “I was not trained to fight against Calormenes, but I do know how to defend myself.  As for sneaking, I believe that I will learn quickly.”<br><br>Kelly hated having to figure things out as she went along, but such was the nature of being an agent, especially one who was always given fresh recruits as temporary partners.<br><br></p>

<li>I was having a little bit of trouble with starting with the prompts and then working into a good story.  I did ask if I could just start from where I felt like, but Iximaz said no.  <br><br>My impression of the PPC pre-missions is that it could take place in some of the less professional real-world offices.  Mostly I&#39;ve seen that when they&#39;re in the RC&#39;s, they&#39;re playing video games, doing arcane rituals, jazzercising, or arguing with belligerent minis.  (I apologize for my malfunctioning spell-check.)<br> <br>I like when the stories have a chance for things to get literal, like when Harry&#39;s flaming emerald orbs went rolling across the floor.  Or there was the time that gravity kept shifting because of dioganle scene-breaks.  <br><br>2. Kelly&#39;s archetype is a more subdued character that&#39;s usually there to help other characters shine.  Ing&#39;s thoughts are hidden because I didn&#39;t want to head-hop, but she&#39;s just trying on the joke to see if she likes it.  I&#39;d switch POV but I&#39;m not sure who Ing is yet, and I won&#39;t know until I&#39;ve thrown her into the field.<br><br>I&#39;ve read a lot of PPC stories where I have no idea who the characters are because I haven&#39;t read their bios.  There was one where I thought that he was a giant snail-monster when I first started reading the mission.  Turns out he was one of those blue deer-centaurs.  I studied his journal and it was a complete waste of first-person perspective because third person limited would have given us the same information.  I think I&#39;ve recently read stories with a better deer-centaur that might be the same guy.  There&#39;s another one where the guy likes Stargate and constantly calls his partner &quot;Orky.&quot;</li>

            <p>Is there any chance at all you could give the title/s of the story/stories you read? Then I might be able to figure out where you&#39;re getting radioactive spiders and slanted eyes, because right now... okay, I can <i>guess</i> where those might be coming from, but those aren&#39;t words I&#39;ve ever actually used in a story, AFAIK.<br><br>I&#39;d recommend not looking at the character journal, actually.

How Ilraen is different from most Andalites is actually a crucial component of his identity and character arc.<br><br>The cinnamon-bun-liking alien is indeed an Andalite, like Ilraen. His name is Aximili. (Using the names of things generally helps people to understand what you&#39;re talking about.)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So, the mission you&#39;re talking about is &quot;Blood Raining Night,&quot; which is quite far into my spin-off. I did try making that one accessible to newcomers, but I also included an author&#39;s note recommending that people do some background reading on the PPC and RC 999 first, or at least keep the wiki open while reading. As hS said, starting in the middle of a series is rarely the best way to get to know the characters.<br><br>I described Nume (and the others by extension) as gaining an epicanthic fold because he had taken on the appearance of a Japanese person, and that&#39;s a feature they have that Caucasians generally don&#39;t. (FYI, &quot;slanted eyes&quot; has such a history of being used in a derogatory manner that it has incredibly racist overtones. Don&#39;t describe Asian people that way; you will give offense if you do.) Yes, the continua involved were animated, but I like to think of the characters as real flesh-and-blood beings regardless of the medium.<br><br>The &quot;radioactive spider&quot; is a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini/Harry_Potter">mini-Aragog</a>. They are not radioactive. I&#39;m not planning to turn any of my agents into Spider-Man anytime soon. ^_~<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>1/ You couldn&#39;t turn &#39;two people meet&#39; into a good one-page story. That&#39;s pretty worrying.<br><br>2/ You can think of four things off the top of your head that would be interesting to read about your agents doing in their RC, but chose not to do any of them - or anything.<br><br>3/ You like it when missions interpret things literally. That&#39;s great! I do too. ^_^ Did you know you can write that in HQ, too? There&#39;s a <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/CrashPart5.htm">scene in <i>Crashing Down</i></a> where one agent uses a literal pun to break out of prison - and of course, &quot;it&#39;s a bit of a maze, unless you hadn&#39;t noticed...&quot;.<br><br>4/ Kelly is there to be a backdrop to Ing, but you don&#39;t have a personality for Ing. I think you just sent the backing vocals on before the band showed up...<br><br>5/ You don&#39;t know the word &#39;Andalite&#39;. That&#39;s fine, <i>Animorphs</i> is pretty old.<br><br>6/ You got the key information - that Ilraen (I guess?) is an alien - but think it&#39;s crucially important that you know exactly what <i>kind</i> of alien. You also either don&#39;t read people&#39;s stories in order (<a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/ficpsych/casefile01.html">&#39;Introducing Ilraen&#39;</a> would be the place to start here) or have an aversion to looking up unfamiliar species-names. The former is something I&#39;ve never understood, but lots of people do; the latter doesn&#39;t make sense to me if you think knowing the details is important.<br><br>7/ You don&#39;t like a particular story (<a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999/03i1ij.html">Ilraen&#39;s Journal</a>, I assume), and don&#39;t approve of Neshomeh&#39;s stylistic decision to showcase her character through a first-person journal. Given how much of Ilraen&#39;s character shines through that story in ways that would <i>not</i> come out in third-person (such as his writing style, his comments about Nume, and his emotional responses to things), I am forced to conclude that:<br><br>8/ You are not someone who particularly registers personality in stories you read.<br><br>And, y&#39;know, that&#39;s actually fine. I border on that myself sometimes - I usually read stories for their setting and/or plot, not for the characters.<br><br>But.<br><br>But I do make an effort to <i>write</i> my characters with personalities. I even try to make them differ from each other (with varying success). On present showing, you haven&#39;t done that, and haven&#39;t shown that you think you <i>should</i>.<br><br>July&#39;s already given a verdict, but in case there&#39;s any doubt: I would deny Permission at this time if it hadn&#39;t already been done.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Not like working in a less professional real world job. Things go strange. The PPC is, essentially, a meta-reality. HQ itself can be considered fairly pliable in a lot of ways- even a relatively &#39;normal&#39; job there isn&#39;t. <br><br>To throw a few examples in:<br><br>The cafeteria workers don&#39;t have access to a normal logistics supply; some of them have to go into canons to get the ingredients and supplies themselves! They occasionally make due with random things agents bring in! Sometimes the food gains sentience and wrecks things! <br><br>The secretarial pool deals with their own set of problems, too. Terri Ryan- to use an example that belongs to hS- occasionally ends up with the mission reports <i>we</i> as the readers and writers see and produce- not whatever it is they presumably turn in in HQ.  <br><br>The janitors are largely hallucinogenic plants, with the occasional human thrown in.<br><br>The guys who make sure the agents haven&#39;t succesfully burned down or otherwise destroyed HQ fully use concrit as a cement, and other materials that don&#39;t actually exist and sometimes exploit the weird nature of HQ just to get their job done. <br><br>HQ is definitely not normal and whether you&#39;re in action or infrastructure while <i>some</i> things are similar enough to a real world work environment, it really isn&#39;t at all.<br><br>2. There are ways to do it and stil have her be interesting. Subdued characters don&#39;t have to be boring or plain. <br><br>If you read through a whole spinoff from the start, you will know the characters present in said spinoff are and what they are supposed to be. Generally, picking up in the middle of anything isn&#39;t the best of ideas because you lose out on a lot of information. <br><br>The journal you&#39;re talking about was not a waste of first person perspective- it did exactly what it was meant to do, which was deliver Ilraen&#39;s thoughts and words directly, rather than just give us &#39;the same information&#39;. It is not Neshomeh&#39;s fault you jumped in and did not realize he is an andalite. Different perspectives in writing give different results, whether between third and first, or even the character it is focused on; I am sorry you do not understand this. </p>

            <p>I think you may have thought the samples were focussed on showcasing your agents&#39; backstory, and tuned them to be information-heavy, when in fact the goal is to see <i>how</i> you write, rather than <i>what</i> you write particularly.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The Agents Receive a Mission.<br><br>{RC} was usually fairly quiet.  While it was true that the console tended to beep whenever the agents were relaxing, it would cease to become funny if it never gave them any downtime.  <br><br>Agent Kelly Stone was playing a game of chess against the computer.  As a child, she hadn’t been encouraged to develop her intelligence, but she still was fairly smart.  However, even with the difficulty turned down to three, Kelly was still losing.  She didn’t mind because she was still improving.<br><br>Agent {To Be Determined} was sewing a patch onto her new uniform.  Unlike her first uniform shirt, which had started life as a man’s dress-shirt, this one used to be part of the Navy Working Uniform.  Its camouflage pattern had faded before the shirt was dyed black.  <br><br>[BEEEEEEEE~]<br><br>Kelly slammed her hand on the “accept” button and began reading.  “It’s for Chappie.  Oh, you might want to make a backup.  ‘They run into the rooms and wore on their weapons.’”<br><br>{TBD} had managed to stab her finger with the needle when the console went off.  She had quietly put her finger in her mouth, but now she took it out.  “Noted.  You said it was ‘Chappie, right?  Is that a movie?”  At Kelly’s nod, {TBD} brought out her tablet and began swiping at the screen.  A few minutes later, she pulled a bonnet-style hairdryer out of her bed’s headboard and laid down with her head in it.  She winced as the device glowed blue for a moment, then she said “Ready to go.”<br><br>Kelly was already ready because she insisted on preparing for the next mission as soon as she returned from one.  Previous partners had accused her of being OCD, but she just knew that being extremely organized made life much easier in the long run.<br><br>Kelly double-checked their bag of supplies and grabbed some extra bleeperin for herself.  She was almost jealous of how {TBD} could just use her device to blunt the memories of missions.  Of course, using Dollhouse technology meant that {TBD} couldn’t take any bleep products and had to wait until the mission was over to get any relief.<br><br>They stepped through the portal and were immediately assaulted with a hailstorm of seeds.<br></p>

            <p>The Agents<br><br>Basic info - Kelly Stone, Human, 29, female, Earth<br><br>Appearance - 5’6, dark hair, dark eyes, skinny<br><br>Personality - She’s guarded and aloof.  She’s not too mean, but she usually doesn’t act nice unless it will get her an advantage.  Though every once in a while she’ll soften and give clues that she actually cares about her partners a little.  She reads trashy romance.  She’s very picky and won’t eat food of questionable origin.<br><br>History -She originally came from a story where the MIB cartoon-verse intersects with the Ben 10 universe.  She was working as an assistant / receptionist for an alien that was running a fake ghost-chasing business.  She has an older sister, a niece, a nephew, and her sister’s husband.  Kelly had them moved to the Muppet universe because it was safer.<br><br>When Kelly first came to the PPC, she had implants that made her immune to neuralysers.  She had them removed within a few months because magic started making them give her migranes.  The agents that recruited her neglected to tell anyone that they recruited her because the neuralyser failed to work on her.<br><br>Kelly is irreligious.  She also told off Aslan at one point, so all of her Narnia missions are before that incident.<br><br>The department- I think rare fandoms is part of the Floaters division?  She’s also an agent trainer, but it’s not on-paper official. <br><br>----------------------------------<br><br>Basic info - Injerd or Ingeborg, Narnian bear, female<br><br>Appearance - She pretty much looks like a grizzly bear with a harness.<br><br>Personality - She’s patient and pretty easy-going, though can go from fine to roaring rage in a heartbeat.<br><br>History - She was a bit character.  She hasn’t grown much beyond that yet.<br><br>When using the disguise generator, she prefers to have a beard.<br><br>The department - She might go into APD for Narnia after she’s transferred away from Kelly.<br><br>-----------------------<br><br>Basic info - To Be Determined, female.<br><br>History - TBD will be recruited from a story I once saw mocked.  If I can’t find it again, I’ll create an outline from what I remember and invent the rest.  She was a bit character who was unceremoniously killed off-screen after criticizing the main character.  Her one defining trait was that she was a bitch.<br><br>She stayed in FicPsych for several months without making progress on growing a good personality.  She was about to be put out of her misery when FicPsych gained Dollhouse technology.<br><br>She has a murderous hatred of Sues.  The rest of her personality will be determined once I’ve figured out how to build the perfect agent.<br><br>The Dollhouse technology can reprogram her personality at any time, but I want to keep it fairly consistent with exceptions for character growth.  Even though it is ideal for instantly gaining skills Matrix-style, she prefers to limit herself to only gaining canon knowledge, similar to being a walking pocket fictionary.  She can’t take bleep-products, but she can blunt any memories she wants to after the mission is over.<br><br>The department - Floaters / rare fandoms.  Kelly will probably transfer out if I want to give TBD a new partner.<br></p>

            <p>I was working on my permission, but have problems to think of a logical backstory for a real world agent.I mean, many of the older RW agents seemed to get sucked right into PPC through plotholes, even teenagers.<br><br>But won&#39;t they be willing to go back? If they signed up willingly after knowing about PPC, how will their disappearance be justified in the real world?<br><br>Normally investigations will be held and missing person reports sent, and if the area in question is well-secured and small, with very few missing person cases in decades, such disappearances are going to warrant great attention.<br><br>If those agents think about the consequences of their recruitment, won&#39;t they be scared, especially when said agent is a teenager? won&#39;t they be wishing to go back? And won&#39;t their requests be granted?<br><br>I&#39;m thinking if the agents from real world can go back to their universe from time to time, just to cease attentions over sudden disappearance, or maybe they are transported to the HQ in a time period that is likely for them to go missing, like a trip to the wild or some busy cities with high crime rate,etc.<br><br>But maybe there is just no need to explain such things......Is it okay to skip such procedures with simple explanations if it is not important to the plot?<br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>Remember  The Message?  I interpreted it as a copy of the person falls into HQ whenever that person falls through a plothole on World One. Anyhow, with the message, I thought that it addressed that you are not that person, as you have essentially been cut off from the world, that life goes on as normal, with what the agents see as &quot;another them&quot;. Either that, or the plothole warps reality so that they never exist.It would make a rather interesting plot point, If I ever get around to writing missions.</p>

            <p>*Mad screaming* so you&#39;re saying that none of this actually happened? Funky. In a nutshell, World one is not our world. It&#39;s a facsimile, identical to ours, but with plotholes. In my headcanon, I think it&#39;s actually impossible to access the original word world. It&#39;s just floating somewhere, and agents, &#39;sues and everything in between are on a mere copy of the original idea, but they don&#39;t know that.

            <p>I think it&#39;d honestly depend on the person! Some people would of course just not be suited to the PPC- plotholes come, plotholes go, and it&#39;s just as easy to go back as it is to wander in in the first place- if not moreso, if someone notices. <br><br>As for their disappearance in the real world?<br><br>Again, that depends.<br><br>Like you said, missing person reports happen. And plenty of people in fact do just go... missing one day. We know the real world causes, of course: They get kidnapped, they ran away, an accident happened and they got seriously injured or died in the process, and so forth. But there are still mysteries in this day and age that we have no explanation for, no clues. <br><br>Maybe your agent character from World One (because from our perspective, at least, our world is the real world, and the world intended to be the real world is World One) is one of those people.<br><br>Or maybe they go back. <br><br>Agents are not held in HQ against their will. There&#39;s nothing preventing them from just giving up the job and going home or to any number of canons. A certain someone from TOS retired into ancient Rome, after all. I can&#39;t remember where Dafydd and Constance retired to (but hS will no doubt come around to correct me) but I rather supect it was not World One, nor was it Middle-Earth. <br><br>And a thing with hieing off is that, not everyone thinks about the potential consequences of running off for an adventure- especially teenagers! They might get scared, but they have the option to leave if they want to, or sometimes don&#39;t think they do. This goes for the real world, as well. I&#39;m on an adventure right now, and one I didn&#39;t exactly think out all the possibiities and consequences of out before I left for it. <br><br>As for what you&#39;re saying about agents going home occasionally or disappearing someplace likely, both are very possible! In fact, people have used both before this. <br><br>To use my own example, Agent July, when she ran off from HQ after snapping, she eventually ended up back in World One- timed right after she had left, despite a few months in the PPC. She also spilled the beans- both things that pretty much eliminate the worry of becoming a missing person.<br><br>That said, you don&#39;t really <i>need</i> to explain this sort of thing. You can in fact skip it if you don&#39;t want to go into this sort of detail. How a person ends up in the PPC doesn&#39;t tend to play into whatever story arc or plot you&#39;re doing with your spinoff, generally, though it can also be fun to write if you want.  <br><br>This is most definitely an excellent thing to bring up, though!<br><br>-July</p>

            <p>To Kill a Mockingbird was one of my favorite required readings from high school. When Go Set a Watchman was realized, I immediately went out and bought a copy not caring that all the copies were hardcover and therefore a teensy bit expensive. So sad to hear that the author of both books passed.</p>

            <p>Hello there, beauties and gentlebeauties!<br><br>As I am writing these words, me and Gran are about to watch the first <i>Harry Potter</i> movie; she, for the first time, and me to just refresh the memories. <br><br>Gran doesn&#39;t know anything about the franchise; she saw bits and pieces of various movies, when they were airing on TV, or with me when i was a kid, but never from start to finish. Not until today that is. If anyone&#39;s interested of her reactions, I&#39;ll post them as soon as we end watching. Are you ready? We are ready! Can you see how ready we are?! :D<br><br><img src="http://s28.postimg.org/5p3vdcl19/mms_img_710550093.jpg"><br>#PotterSelfie</p>

            <p>Sorry for not uploading this yesterday :P I have no excuse, I just didn&#39;t.<br><br><br>Initial reaction? I have a feeling Gran enjoyed this a bit more than <i>Lord of the Rings</i> (I&#39;m sorry, Nesh! I&#39;m sorry, Phobos! Pleasedon&#39;thurtme!). I don&#39;t know why, maybe because HP has Polish dubbing, whilst LotR only a voice-over done by one person? Now, Gran is not very active commentator, she prefers to enjoy the movie, but there were things that we discussed:<br><br>- During the opening scene, she briefly thought Dumbledore and McGonagall were Harry&#39;s relatives. Also, she really liked Hagrid and his speech, which in Polish dubbing was portrayed as this working-class man who enjoys his vodka; slightly slurred, but not completely botched. <br><br>- At first, she thought Harry&#39;s scar is some sort of Potter family mark.<br><br>- &quot;<i>Unruly little brat.</i>&quot; was her first comment about Dudley. As I mentioned before, she saw bits and pieces of the movies, so she remembered Dudley getting a pig tail later on. For some reason, she also thought Vernon knows magic (I later told her the Dursleys know <i>about</i> magic, but can&#39;t perform it).<br><br>- During the Hagrid scene, I was already sure Rubeus was her favourite character. Peraphs close to her own neighborhood; there were a lot of Hagrid-like people there. Also, she assumed Hagrid would become Harry&#39;s father-figure.<br><br>- She thought Eeylops Emporium was a post office, and that&#39;s where all the owls that delivered Harry&#39;s letters came from.<br><br>- She confused goblins with dwarves, which is I guess fair enough since we&#39;ve recently watched LotR, and both races are connected with valuables.<br><br>- When Hagrid was telling Harry about Voldemort, and when he said that some believe he died, Gran theorized that You-Know-Who was hiding in Hogwarts, posing as one of the teachers.<br><br>- She remembered that Harry was going to have two friends with him, a redheaded boy and a girl. I didn&#39;t even try making her remember the names, although it was funny that she thought the girl&#39;s name was &#39;Emma&#39;.<br><br>- &quot;<i>I don&#39;t like him</i>.&quot; Her first comment about Malfoy.<br><br>- And of course, when Harry&#39;s scar hurt, she thought Snape was Voldemort in disguise! :D<br><br>- &quot;<i>Oh yeah, you better run.</i>&quot; To Quirrell, when he stayed with the knocked out troll.<br><br>- She thought Quidditch was a bit too brutal.<br><br>- Hands down her best reaction was when she learned the Cerberus&#39; name was &#39;Fluffy&#39;. Wish I was filming it.<br><br>- &quot;<i>At least one thing you <u>don&#39;t</u> know.</i>&quot; When Hermione said she has no idea who Nicolas Flamel is.<br><br>- &quot;<i>Yes, you&#39;re getting punished too, little snitch.</i>&quot; When Malfoy got detention from Minerva. <br><br>- And she was actually sad when she learned that Hagrid had to give Norbert(a) away.<br><br>- Her first reaction to unicorn blood was &quot;<i>That&#39;s either tar, or mercury.</i>&quot;<br><br>- And the surprise when Quirrell was revealed to be the big bad was priceless (BTW. have you ever noticed that, in the books, Fred and George were throwing snowballs at Quirell&#39;s turban? They were literally hitting Voldemort in the face!)<br><br>- At first she thought that exposure to the Stone gave Harry the power to kill Quirrell. <br><br><br><br>And that&#39;s it. I don&#39;t know when we&#39;ll do <i>The Chamber of Secrets</i>, but we definitely will. </p>

            <p>Not that I expected otherwise, given your first post about this, which I also found really awesome  without knowing pretty much anything about Tolkien outside of what I have inevitably picked up his works from the TOS and the discussions here on the Board. <br><br>I really love how she theorized that Voldemort was posing as a Hogwarts&#39; professor just from what Hagrid told Harry about him. I certainly didn&#39;t think that when I first read that part. That was really brilliant! :)<br><br>I have said this before and I will say it again, even though there&#39;s no real need to since you have already pretty much confirmed that you will be doing, but I will say it again anyway:  Please do keep us posted on her reactions to the rest of the series! She and her reactions are just too awesome to miss out on! :D</p>

            <p>“We often have to explain to young people why study is useful. It’s pointless telling them that it’s for the sake of knowledge, if they don’t care about knowledge. Nor is there any point in telling them that an educated person gets through life better than an ignoramus, because they can always point to some genius who, from their standpoint, leads a wretched life. And so the only answer is that the exercise of knowledge creates relationships, continuity, and emotional attachments. It introduces us to parents other than our biological ones. It allows us to live longer, because we don’t just remember our own life but also those of others. It creates an unbroken thread that runs from our adolescence (and sometimes from infancy) to the present day. And all this is very beautiful.”<br>-- Umberto Eco<br><br>Eco wrote books. Lots of books. I only have a few, but one of them is probably my favourite book of all time. <i>Inventing The Enemy</i> is a collection of his essays and lectures and I could <i>feel</i> myself learning when I first read it. In one of the essays he makes an entire story out of the moments of exegesis in other works (exegesis being the technical term for a massive, world-changing, frequently overblown plot twist of the &quot;Here&#39;s a pretty ring&quot; from <i>Les Miserables</i> variety), and I laughed aloud. In another, he explored the wisdom (and lack thereof) in common sayings and phrases and running a country on the principles of this &quot;common sense&quot;. I didn&#39;t feel talked down to. I didn&#39;t feel out of my depth. I just felt... good. Like I was thinking better, and in better ways, than I had before.<br><br>He made me think more, and that&#39;s the best thing an author of books can do.<br><br>Rest in peace.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s kind of <i>really disturbing</i> to have that happen.<br><br>~<br><br>I do not have raven hair. Ravens are Odin&#39;s pets and tattletales; they are his symbols of oppressive authority and purported wisdom. Their mangy feathers may be an approximation of their hair colour, but that is where the resemblance ends.<br><br>Nor is my hair as dark as a stormy night. When my so-called brother has one of his tantrums, filling the skies of the Nine Worlds with thunderclouds and slashing them with lightning, the general result is one of mayhem and sodden ruin. That is not, in point of fact, an appropriate simile for my hair.<br><br>Might my hair be midnight? Perhaps - but only the weak and the foolish try to hide their plans under the cover of night. Far better to carry out your intrigue in broad daylight, and see how far the naive gods of Asgard will bend to keep from admitting what you are doing.<br><br>My hair is not the same shade as coal, the dirty, inefficient fuel source of a pathetic race. It is not filled with the shadows of the deep places, for in my birthplace the caves are of ice, and blue-green light fills them. It is not as black as the void, that empty waste which no civilized race would ever deign to enter.<br><br>You pitiable humans, living out your mayfly lives on your fragile world, filling your brief hours with petty squabbles, have no concept of how important words can be. Words can bring down empires; they can corrupt the pure-hearted and reduce the strong to tears. Find the right words, and you can snuff out the stars.<br><br>My hair is as black as my hate. That is all that needs to be said.<br><br>~<br><br>Because words are important, and comparisons should not be made without proper planning.<br><br>(With bonus shout-outs to J.R.R. Tolkien and Diane Duane, though they&#39;re pretty oblique.)<br><br>hS</p>
