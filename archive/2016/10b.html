        <div class="post-body">
            <p>So... not so long ago, nine posters for <i>Fantastic Beasts</i> have been revealed. Let&#39;s put them under the microscope!<br><br>First one: <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53323bb4e4b0cebc6a28ffa2/57fbd3cdf5e231b02fbb6d56/57fbd3cebe6594a09a013eed/1476121551693/character-poster-fantasticbeasts1.jpg?format=1000w"><b>Newt Scamander, the Magizoologist</b></a>.<br>All I can see is the inside of his TARDIS-like suitcase, with books, drawers, and a picture of a Niffler which is adorable and I want one! There is also a Bowtruckle chillin&#39; on Newt&#39;s jacket.<br><br>Up next, future Mrs. Scamander - <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53323bb4e4b0cebc6a28ffa2/57fbd3cdf5e231b02fbb6d56/57fbd3ce9de4bb5d599e4db0/1476121552041/character-poster-fantasticbeasts2.jpg?format=1000w"><b>Porpentina Goldstein, the MACUSA Auror</b></a>.<br>We get a closer look at the MACUSA Clock of Danger, and what looks like Tina&#39;s ID on the right. I&#39;m not sure what the numbers in the upper right mean.<br><br>NEXT! <s>The Flash</s>... I mean, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53323bb4e4b0cebc6a28ffa2/57fbd3cdf5e231b02fbb6d56/57fbd3cf9de4bb5d599e4db6/1476121551934/character-poster-fantasticbeasts3.jpg?format=1000w"><b>Credence Barebone, the Second Salemer</b></a>.<br>Now, we know that Credence is supposed to be a &quot;notable&quot; character within the Harry Potter universe. I have a theory on that, along with our next guy, which I&#39;ll save for last.<br><br>Then, we have <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53323bb4e4b0cebc6a28ffa2/57fbd3cdf5e231b02fbb6d56/57fbd3cfbe6594a09a013f3d/1476121552481/character-poster-fantasticbeasts4.jpg?format=1000w"><b>Percival Graves, the Director of Magical Security</b></a>.<br>Now, about President Piggles&#39; right-hand minion... anything catches your eye? That, by itself, was a hint. Also, remember the background of Graves&#39;s poster, &#39;cause we&#39;re gonna be back here.<br><br>Up next, it&#39;s Tina&#39;s sister - <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53323bb4e4b0cebc6a28ffa2/57fbd3cdf5e231b02fbb6d56/57fbd3cf9de4bb5d599e4db9/1476121552399/character-poster-fantasticbeasts5.jpg?format=1000w"><b>Queenie Goldstein, the Legilimens</b></a>.<br>Queenie was stated to be a very proficient Legilimens, with the ability to not only see in one&#39;s memories, but also share empathic connection... which I assume would make her a sorta Wizarding Cold Reader/Lie Detector. I also think that the locket on the mannequin in the background is not random.<br><br>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53323bb4e4b0cebc6a28ffa2/57fbd3cdf5e231b02fbb6d56/57fbd3cfbe6594a09a013f43/1476121552167/character-poster-fantasticbeasts6.jpg?format=1000w"><b>Seraphina Picquery, the President of MACUSA</b></a><br>As for our friendly neighborhood dictator, I don&#39;t think she&#39;s gonna be the true villain of the trilogy. She&#39;s a bureaucrat, takes her job very seriously, and probably has the ideal model of American Wizarding Society in her mind, but isn&#39;t remotely close do Voldemort or Grindelwald.<br><br>Our next contestant is... umm... <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53323bb4e4b0cebc6a28ffa2/57fbd3cdf5e231b02fbb6d56/57fbd3d0be6594a09a013f49/1476121557274/character-poster-fantasticbeasts7.jpg?format=1000w"><b>Gnarlak, the Goblin Gangster</b></a><br>Honestly, I don&#39;t know Gnarlak&#39;s exact role in the films. He owns a Wizarding Speakeasy, where at least one fighting scene will occur (as seen in the trailers), and my best guess is he&#39;s gonna be Newt&#39;s informant around the city. Most likely gonna end up selling them out, but that&#39;s not the topic for today.<br><br>Now someone who&#39;s probably gonna be the comic relief, but one can hope for more - <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53323bb4e4b0cebc6a28ffa2/57fbd3cdf5e231b02fbb6d56/57fbd3d09de4bb5d599e4dbd/1476121554960/character-poster-fantasticbeasts8.jpg?format=1000w"><b>Jacob Kowalski, the No-Maj</b></a>.<br>And apparently an owner of one fine-looking bakery. Shame I can&#39;t say anything more about Jakey-boy, as his character intrigues me the most out of the main cast. <br><br>And finally, the one, the only... American Umbridge! <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53323bb4e4b0cebc6a28ffa2/57fbd3cdf5e231b02fbb6d56/57fbd3d0be6594a09a013f4e/1476121554610/character-poster-fantasticbeasts9.jpg?format=1000w"><b>Mary Lou Barebone, the Leader of the Second Salemers</b></a><br>Descendant of Bartholomew Barebone, who himself descends from a Scourer, means Mary Lou has a very diluted magic running in her blood. Also worth noting is that all of her children (Credence and his two sisters) are adopted.<br><br><br>Now that we have the posters done, let&#39;s take a step forward, and theorize about the film before it comes out:<br><br><br>We roughly know the outline of the first film. Newt Scamander visits New York, probably because of his research, but stuff happens and all the creatures he brought with him are set free and he has to chase around after them. Simple, until you remember there are <u>two more films</u> in the <i>Fantastic Beasts</i> series. It&#39;d be too repetitive if the entire trilogy focused on capturing escaped animals, so here&#39;s my idea how&#39;s it gonna go:<br><br>Remember Percival Graves&#39;s poster? His is the only one with the Deathly Hallows necklace. Or, what&#39;s known to most wizards as the symbol of Gellert Grindelwald. But why is it in Graves&#39;s poster specifically? Well, the answer is in the final trailer! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vso5o11LuGU">Here</a> at 2:06 we hear Graves saying &quot;I refuse to bow down any longer.&quot; And earlier, he pulls Credence to the side and tells him, &quot;We&#39;ve lived in the shadows for too long&quot; [1:16]. The wall in Graves&#39;s poster also has significance; it symbolizes his breakthrough. And the fact that the wall is riddled with the Salemers&#39; posters is an additional touch. So let me explain it now:<br><br>Percival Graves will turn out to be a traitor. Maybe by the end of the first film, when Newt and MACUSA will combat the mysterious foggy creature of darkness and destruction, it will be revealed that Graves was the one who somehow tamed the creature/made its hunting easier by sickening it onto important No-Majes, such as Shaw, and Senator Shaw, Jr.? In the end, him and Credence are gonna flee America. Why Credence you ask? Besides being the &quot;notable&quot; figure in the universe, I&#39;m thinking on one more possibility:<br><br>Credence Barebone may turn out to be a wizard. He&#39;s Mary Lou&#39;s <i>adopted</i> son, but he wasn&#39;t specified to be a No-Maj. Perhaps Mary Lou&#39;s dormant magic senses told her to adopt Credence, because he&#39;d be a great addition to her anti-wizard campaign? And since he&#39;s easily manipulated by Graves, both are going to escape America. Why? To join Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s army of course! In the final trailer, President Picquery first mistakes Newt&#39;s accident as an act of aggression, similar to those of Grindelwald&#39;s attacks in Europe [1:40], and is ready to go to war if necessary. That means Grindelwald is active in Europe in the 1920s! After being tired of President Pickles&#39;s rule, Graves could decide to work with someone who has more... strict approach. And Credence was supposed to be a &quot;notable&quot; figure in the <i>Harry Potter</i> universe; nobody said a &quot;notable, <u>positive</u>&quot; figure. As far as we know, he may grow to become Grindelwald&#39;s right-hand man!<br><br>So, to sum up, this is what I think is gonna go down:<br><br>First Film - capturing magical creatures in New York, Graves revealed to be the main villain, him and Credence flee to join Grindelwald.<br><br>Second Film - journey through Europe. More creatures native to the Continent, perhaps a visit to the 1920s Ministry of Magic? (We could see Minister Archer Evermonde, and Harry&#39;s great-grandfather Henry!), rallying people up against Grindelwald?<br><br>Third Film - all-out British Ministry and MACUSA vs. Grindelwald&#39;s army!</p>

            <p>That&#39;s ridiculous.<br><br>On the plus side... well, there&#39;s two:<br><br>1/ Since it&#39;s not based on a preexisting story, it shouldn&#39;t suffer from <i>Hobbit</i> syndrome and have to stretch the plot out until it snaps (like butter spread over too much bread, if I may).<br><br>2/ This ups the chance that the story will run through to 1945 and the Dumbledore/Grindelwald duel. That would make #5 (&#39;Please, Newt, Just Lock The Suitcase For Once&#39;) a magical war film. I... can get behind this.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Just cast the same suite of charms you cast on a racing broom, only a load more <i>of</i> them. I mean, if one admittedly-obsessive bloke working in his back garden can get a Ford Anglia airborne reliably enough that <i>children</i> can pilot it from London to whichever midge-infested Scotch boghole Hogwarts squats in, then a team of wizards churning out planes for the War Effort can probably do a hell of a lot more.

            <p>I think I might have to split this over multiple posts.<br><br><u>Newt</u><br><br>That&#39;s definitely the inside of the suitcase. A few items of interest:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/newt_mask.jpg"><br><br>Some kind of carnival mask? Could be a hint of personality; alternately, it might be designed to get hatchlings to imprint on you. Pretty strange bird, in that case.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/newt_codes.jpg"><br><br>We have &#39;special feed codes&#39; for three creatures. One looks like it might say &#39;Beaked [something] Griffin&#39;? The second just says &#39;Feathered&#39;, which sounds like a word cut out for secrecy. I can&#39;t read the Niffler sketch.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/newt_samples.jpg"><br><br>Newt has samples! He has billywig stings, and something with bismuth in it. We can also see that he purchases from [W]iseacre&#39;s Wizarding Equ[ipment].<br><br><u>Porpentina</u><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/porpentina_chain.jpg"><br><br>You highlighted a locket on Queenie&#39;s picture? Porpentina has one too.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/porpentina_id.jpg"><br><br>Her middle name is Esther. The fact that she has a traditionally-Jewish surname <i>and middle name</i> suggests an intriguing possibility - could she/her family actually be religious wizards? The surname could just be a relic of her distant ancestry, but the presence of the middle name suggests intent.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what the other items under her name are - they could be authorising names, or descriptions of her job, but I think the first might say [Felisal???] Wand. The printed text underneath the handwritten seems to start with &#39;AND IS&#39;, so the ID card certifies that Porpentina Esther Goldstein IS [something] [handwritten x2] AND IS [something long]. Hmm.<br><br><u>Credence</u><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/credence_newt.jpg"><br><br>Newt and Jacob are wanted for bank robbery. ^<em>^ I guess that bank scene we keep seeing is significant.<br><br>&lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/credence">http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/credence</a></em>posters.jpg&quot;&gt;<br><br>The Salemers meet in Pike Street, and Mary Lou is speaking in person. The other posters seem unrelated, but advertise various things in Coney Island (and one in Brooklyn) in October and November.<br><br><u>Percival</u><br><br>No pictures. I think you&#39;re right about the Grindelwald connection - his lines in the trailer (&quot;Who does this protect? Us -- or them?&quot;) suggest he shares Gellert&#39;s philosophy of wizards ruling over <s>muggles</s> No-Majs. I&#39;m dubious about him leaving America, though, for one reason:<br><br>Ilvermorny. We&#39;ve got a <i>lot</i> of information about the school, but no indication that it&#39;s really in the film. I think it&#39;s going to be significant in one of the other films of the trilogy, and that means staying in America.<br><br>On the other hand, Grindelwald is the only pre-Potter historical event we have any details on. It would take a strong filmmaker <i>not</i> to want to delve into that - particularly when it promises the chance to show young Albus Dumbledore. So I think either one of the other films will spill over to &#39;20s England (or maybe &#39;30s... guess we can&#39;t stretch it out to 1945), or Grindelwald and Dumbledore will both end up in America for Reasons.<br><br><u>Queenie</u><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/queenie_necklace.jpg"><br><br>That necklace. Did you imply you know something about it? I agree that it&#39;s very deliberately placed, but I don&#39;t recognise it.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/queenie_mao.jpg"><br><br>The picture to her right looks like it just might be a map of Manhattan. I think it&#39;s definitely an island surrounded by rivers, though it could also be some sort of animal - a dragon?<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/queenie_owl.jpg"><br><br>To her left is an owl - Hogwarts connection? More interestingly, that looks almost like a wireless underneath it. She has electric lights, too - very technologically progressive for a witch.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/queenie_charms.jpg"><br><br>She also has a matched set of all seven volumes of <i>Chadwick&#39;s Charms</i>. Yup, set of seven books, nothing suspicious at all there...<br><br><u>President Piggles</u><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/seraphina_gothic.jpg"><br><br>Nothing significant here; I just want to say that I love the design work on this film. Absolutely love it.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/seraphina_rings.jpg"><br><br>Do rings have any magical significance? How about a glowing blue wand?<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/seraphina_ambassadors.jpg"><br><br>Hi, Percy! But who are those folks behind you? Well, they&#39;re very racially diverse, but more interestingly, their dress implies they might be foreign representatives. That could go either way, though, and it&#39;s not like darker skin is uncommon in America. (Is the woman on the right Chinese? She looks like she might be, but I&#39;m not sure.)<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/seraphina_emergency.jpg"><br><br>Emergency Message<br>Issued by the MACUSA Surveillance Department<br>Warning!Warning!Warning!Warning!<br>Exposure Threat level Has [Reached]<br>=== Unexplained Activity ===<br>-- Do Not Let It Reach: Level [?] --<br>President Seraphina Picquery will address the wizarding [...]<br>letter.

And it&#39;s making me so hungry. :(<br><br><u>Mary Lou</u><br><br>Haha I love this poster.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/marylou_banner.jpg"><br><br>She has an awesome banner of a wand being snapped.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/marylou_dolly.jpg"><br><br>She has a little dolly witch being burned at a little dolly stake.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/marylou_pamphlet.jpg"><br><br>She has a fantastically period pamphlet. The back cover quotes Jeremiah - &quot;The eyes of the blind shall be opened&quot; - and confirms (if we needed it?) that the Second Salemers are the same people as the New Salem Philanthropic Society.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/marylou_alphabet.jpg"><br><br>She has <i>an actual alphabet of sins on her wall</i>. Gluttony, Hatred, Lies, Murder, Necromancy, ???Racism, Stealing, Terrorism, all show up there.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/marylou_no.jpg"><br><br>I&#39;m honestly not sure what any of the things banned by this notice are. It looks fascinating.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/marylou_flyer.jpg"><br><br>Buried behind the title is this flyer, which is headed with the words &#39;Hear his Call&#39;. The lowercase &#39;his&#39; suggests it&#39;s not religious, so... who is &#39;he&#39;? His call is to &#39;Join the New Salemers&#39; Army&#39; and &#39;Defy the [something]&#39;.<br><br>Putting that aside - I don&#39;t think Mary Lou is evil, guys. What, because she thinks the people who can kill you with a thought and have their own independent (one might say &#39;secessionist&#39;) government buried in the heart of the US are bad news? She&#39;s right! She&#39;s also apparently anti-racist, which is incredibly for a &#39;20s religious character. Until I get any evidence to the contrary, I&#39;m on her side in all this.<br><br>More seriously (because obvs she&#39;s a villain, she has a fire theme and dislikes wizards, who are racially superior to everyone else and we should support them in everything), I&#39;m seeing hints of childhood trauma in this poster. The doll and alphabet both point to childhood issues related to wizardry. Hmm... would she have been a kid at the time of the Sasquatch Rebellion?<br><br>All in all, I&#39;m actually kinda excited for this film. Probably won&#39;t see it in the cinema, but when it&#39;s out on DVD... yup.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The handwritten part on her ID beneath her name says &quot;Federal Wand Permit Officer&quot;. Since wand permits are kind of a thing in the US and not over here, this leads me to wonder if she&#39;s some sort of border/customs official. Since we know she&#39;s going to end up with Newt by the end of the story, is this our in, so to speak, with MACUSA and President Piggles?<br><br>Additionally, I think the necklace is related to the sign used for Ilvermorny on the Pottermore website; if so, it suddenly makes a lot more sense. It&#39;s basically a subtle marker for any witch or wizard (likely more the former than the latter; men in 1920s America didn&#39;t wear jewellery beyond the occasional tie-pin) so that they can see who else went to Ilvermorny at a glance, a la the icthys in the early days of Christianity.</p>

            <p>I think it says:-<br><br>&quot;NO SINGING<br>NO CUDDLING<br>NO SOILING<br>NO HORSEPLAY&quot;<br><br>Which sounds to me like she&#39;s either a landlady with a very strict set of morals (which was common in the US in the 20s) or it&#39;s from an orphanage. Given hS&#39;s earlier remarks concerning her antipathy to magic perhaps having roots in childhood trauma, maybe she saw a witch/wizard kill her parents and was sent to an orphanage upstate or something. It would certainly account for the explicit religiosity of her message...</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not convinced by your first two: it looks like the letter after the S is a P, and the letter after CU... also looks like a P, actually. Assuming the other two are right... give me a minute.<br><br>Hmm. Soiling/Horseplay in a similar font gives the right layout (with the O in the last NO about halfway under the N of the third). Then the second word, CUP-, needs to have about four more letters; CUDDLING is too long. CUPPING is obvious, but doesn&#39;t seem to mean anything relevant (I asked the OED). CUPIDITY actually fits very well, and means inappropriate covetousness or lust; an archaic word, but a good fit.<br><br>As for the top word... SP and five more letters gives over 200 results. Spouses could be banned, or spleens. We don&#39;t want any spewers here, or any spading... but ultimately, I think the only version I can advocate is this:<br><br><p>NO SPORKS<br>NO CUPIDITY<br>NO SOILING<br>NO HORSEPLAY</p>

            <p>And Mary Lou looks like she&#39;s in at least in her forties here. I&#39;d say she was between 10 and 13 during the time the Rebellion happened, so your theory still holds! (Also, can I point out how <a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/a/a8/Sasquatch_-_PM.png/revision/latest?cb=20161006193244">Sasquatches</a> look like the Wookies?)<br><br>As for the rest of your points:<br><br><b>Newt:</b> Yes, I think that&#39;s either a protective mask (a&#39;la Plague Doctors), or for newly hatched creatures to feel comfortable around you.

And yes, there are <a href="https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/544946669448867841">Jewish wizards</a>.

This is set in the outskirts of a village in the countryside (woods behind the house), so Mr Rosenberger has a legal reason to possess a rifle or shotgun (to protect his chickens or such), but would he carry it when he visits the neighbors to share brandy and stories? So he ran home to get his firearm, but then arrived at the same time as Ix’s father? Well, finding the man who was trying to find his daughter <i>may</i> have been easier than finding the girl.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>The werewolf expected to bite a Muggle and actually didn’t realize that Ix is a witch when she told him that she isn’t Caitlyn, so Mr Rosenberger must be a Muggle neighbor and can’t carry a wand.

            <p>All right, I promised myself to take reviewing missions more seriously (one of the reasons being I actually want to get good at both writing and helping out), so this is my first shot at an actual, (maybe) helpful, con-crit review:<br><br>We started with a nightmare flashback, which showed us the origin story of Ix-Wolf. Now, just from the first paragraph of description I could tell it’s Greyback that bit her. Sounds exactly like the scenario he would choose. I have to commend you on setting up the atmosphere, too. The portrayal of Greyback as cannibalistic and sexually creepy, and his preference for children was shown nicely. However, the scene reminds me of Lupin’s “origin”: Greyback biting him as a revenge for what Lupin’s dad said about werewolves. The changes here were Greyback making a mistake (He probably did bit Caitlyn next month, I assume), and apparently somebody contracting him to do so… Which I don’t know if he would, but that’s just my musings. Also, there is Greyback’s uncertain fate after 1998 (Neville and Ron “brought him down” which could imply anything from imprisonment to slaying), but I’m gonna let it slide.<br>Lottie being the overly protective Sparklepire girlfriend was really cute, and I approve of it with all my might. And as I said before… Saibhir was a pretty clever reference. I do hate you for the Hair of Slytherin, though, because that’s the worst pun in the history (:P). <br>(Sidenote: I will kill the author for disrespecting The Merchant of Venice…)<br><br>As for the mission itself, it was easy to follow and clear. I like the house-elves disguise; first time seeing it being used, and I think those should be implemented more often. I like how they were forced to do the house-elf speech. You could’ve leave it the second time, though. Felt like something that would come as a price for the disguise (Good Lord, I hope I would never have to disguise as a Gungan). The charges list was quick and simple, and the execution was efficient. It was a good mission.<br></p>

            <p>(Hi, I&#39;m trying to review more!)<br><br>I think the flashback was my favorite part of this story. The mission was good, too, but there was such atmosphere and emotion in the flashback, I really got into it. There are limits to how much of that you can do while also sporking badfic.<br><br>I honestly don&#39;t have anything much to critique. I&#39;d like to tell Charlotte to back off a little, but that&#39;s just her character, I think. I can tell she means well and really wants Ix to be happy, but every now and then she goes just a tad further with kissing and whatnot than my introverted self finds to be charming. She still has a thing or two to learn about her partner, I think. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think what bugs me is that Ix doesn&#39;t seem really into it; she blushes and gets flustered and seems kind of uncomfortable herself, like she&#39;s just tolerating it because she doesn&#39;t know what to do about it.

            <p>Basically, just put in more positive reactions to Charlotte&#39;s attention. I realize a lot of it is because of the nightmare, but this story has a lot of negative or at best neutral ones, and only one that I can construe as good. Just for the sake of comparison, I&#39;ll sort them into categories:<br><br><u>Negative</u><ol>
<li>“I’m not going to eat you,” Charlotte said, reaching out to give Ix a hug, but pulling back when she flinched.</li>
<br><br><li>Charlotte put a hand under Ix’s chin. “Hey. Are you okay?”<br><br>“I’m fine,” Ix said, a little more sharply than she meant to. She brushed Charlotte’s hand away and opened a portal.</li>
<br><br><li>“You’d know,” Charlotte said teasingly, poking Ix in the side. “I swear, you’re just skin and bones.”<br><br>Ix was not amused. “My parents lost a lot of money trying to pay for my medical bills after every monthly transformation. There were a lot of nights we’d all go to bed hungry.”<br><br>Charlotte swallowed. “Sorry, I… I didn’t realize.”<br><br>Ix just looked away.</li>
<br><br><li>Charlotte gasped. “You wound me, Ix! You wound me deeply!”<br><br>“Sorry,” Ix mumbled, looking away.<br><br> Charlotte frowned. “Hey, I’m just joking,” she said. “You don’t need to apologize.”<br><br>“Sorry,” Ix said again, hunching her shoulders.<br><br>Charlotte put a hand on Ix’s cheek. “Hey. Look at me.” When Ix did, she said, “You’re fine, you know that? I like bantering with you. It’s fun. Don’t apologize if you didn’t do anything wrong.”<br><br>“So—”</li>
<br><br><li>“But hon, don’t sell yourself short. Look at you, you were on the path to become the first werewolf Auror! That’s gotta take guts!”<br><br>“It was mostly cowardice,” Ix mumbled, looking away. [Etc.]</li>
<br><br><li>“Well, it’s hardy your fault if you smell good enough to eat,” Charlotte said, then winced. “Sorry, that was in bad taste, wasn’t it?”<br><br>“Just a bit,” Ix said with a shudder, realizing she’d reached up to rub her ear as she spoke.<br><br>“Sorry,” Charlotte repeated. She took Ix’s hand and gave her fingers a gentle squeeze. “You know I won’t ever eat you, right?”<br><br>“Truly, you know how to charm a girl,” Ix said dryly. Still she pulled her hand away.</li>
<br><br><li>Charlotte elbowed her, cringing when Ix jumped at the touch.</li>
</ol>
<br><u>Neutral</u><ol>
<li>“If you need anything, I’ll be in the other room,” Charlotte said, putting a hand on Ix’s shoulder. When Ix still didn’t react, she sighed and got up.</li>
<br><br><li>Despite this, Charlotte still somehow found a way to drape an arm over Ix’s shoulders. [No reaction from Ix is described, positive or negative.]</li>
<br><br><li>... leaving Charlotte holding her partner when she lost her balance and fell over. Ix felt her face redden when she looked up at Charlotte, who was grinning at her.<br><br>“Walk much?” Charlotte said, helping Ix back on her feet and kissing her lightly on the nose.<br><br>Ix just blushed and straightened her robes, too flustered to respond. [She <i>could</i> be pleased, or just embarrassed. It&#39;s unclear. But since she&#39;s sensitive about her appearance and condition, I&#39;d lean toward embarrassed.]</li>
<br><br><li>Charlotte looked like she could have kissed her. “Ix, you’re a genius!”<br><br>Ix blushed. “Not really, but thank you.” [As above, she could be pleased, but her behavior so far makes me think she&#39;s embarrassed and just being polite.]</li>
<br><br><li>Hesitantly, she [got on Charlotte&#39;s back], and involuntarily let out a scream of exhilaration as Charlotte took off ... [Etc. The scream of exhilaration is involuntary; no telling whether she actually enjoys this ride or not, or whether she got on board because she really wanted to or because she felt she couldn&#39;t turn it down.]</li>
</ol>
<br><u>Positive</u><ol><li>“If you say sorry one more time, I’m kissing you to make you stop,” Charlotte said, mock-threateningly.<br><br>“Good luck doing it with that nose,” Ix said, tapping her own long, pointed nose. [This only barely edges into the positive category for being the one time Ix actually engages with Charlotte&#39;s affection instead of freezing or actively rejecting it. It could still be Ix trying to avoid and divert, though; I&#39;m being generous because Charlotte seems to take it as genuine humor.]</li></ol>
<br><br>So you see, the balance is wildly off.<br><br>Some of the neutral reactions could be made positive by the addition of a smile, a fluttering heartbeat, a warm feeling in her stomach, or just describing her thoughts if it&#39;s not out of place in the scene. Even the negative ones could be mitigated by a line here and there explaining that Ix knows Charlotte is trying to help and she appreciates it, she&#39;s just not in a place to accept it just then because the memory of the assault is too fresh, or whatever her feelings are. (And of course, telling Charlotte her feelings instead of leaving her in the dark would be a good idea if they&#39;re going to be a supportive couple, too.)<br><br>So, that&#39;s my two cents. I hope it helps. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t seen the movies in a while but I remember the lines about the love potion so much because of just how jarring the idea was to me at the time.

            <p>This isn&#39;t an intelligence report. <br>Intelligence reports are written by, and from the perspective of PPC spies. Who work in the Department of Intelligence. Which is the entire idea of the department. <br>This, as far as I can figure, is not. It is, rather, you simply filling the form out with your own thoughts. <br><br>There&#39;s nothing wrong, of course, with pointing us towards a poorly written fic and giving a few thoughts on it, but you have presented it in the form of an intelligence report, and it must be as such judged on the grounds of an intelligence report. <br>And on the grounds of an intelligence report, it really isn&#39;t very good, containing no actual story or character, or much of anything.  <br><br>You got to research this stuff more, mate.

            <p>(CONTAINS VAGUE SPOILERS FOR <i>DOCTOR WHO</i>)<br><br><u>The Agents</u><br>I have some concerns here regarding both characters. First off, and perhaps most notable, is the Detective. Describing one of your protagonists as &#39;an irredeemable jerk&#39; is something of an issue. &#39;Irredeemable&#39; means that there is nothing about this individual of merit, nothing that makes them a likable person. What&#39;s more, it means they never will gain any sort of positive trait. So why follow them? Even villainous protagonists typically have something that endears them to the audience, such as intelligence, honor, charisma, etc. Jerks… aren&#39;t really interesting. Well, unless they get comeuppance, which seems to be something that occurs in at least one of your prompts. But as it stands, the prompt just makes him seem like someone who would be unlikeable and get away with it.<br><br>My concern with Jack Riggs is less to do with with characterization—stout, stalwart characters are nice to see and have a lot of potentiality, and having him be unconvinced he isn&#39;t still in an illusion is something that could have a lot of play story-wise—and more to do with a canonical issue. You say he joined the PPC at age 19, and is now somewhere in his 30s. The issue there is that <i>Supernatural</i> first aired in Sept. 2005. That means, at oldest, he could be exactly 30. Having him be any older that would make him predate his own universe of origin. This is an easy thing to fix, though.<br><br>I... also must confess as to not being all that excited to see a new Time Lord agent. Or a new pair of Floater agents.<br><br><u>The Prompts</u><br>Regarding the first prompt, I admit to starting out very confused. Why was DoSAT after Jack&#39;s heirloom journal? I don&#39;t ever recall DoSAT seizing the personal possessions of agents before. Sure, it makes more sense that they would be concerned about a TARDIS, but that just made me ask: why don&#39;t they use the TARDIS as a response center? I&#39;m also confused as to when this is taking place canonically. I was under the impression that Gallifrey was back (sorta, kinda). So… why is the Detective doing all this, then? Is this taking place in the past? Does he not know?<br><br>All that said, the first prompt is otherwise fairly sound. The characters banter well and the prompt is integrated well. It&#39;s a good piece, despite the questions that nagged at me. <br><br>The mission received story is also very solid, but lacking in some areas. Some of your sentences tend to drag on to such an extent that they become awkward to read. The first sentence of the second paragraph, for example, as well as the eighth paragraph in its entirety. You use commas when you really don&#39;t need to.<br><br>Some continuity errors: the Detective corrected himself, saying he was late by five hours, then said he walked in an hour after the Marquis de Sod told him. Should it be five hours? Also, the Marquis de Sod has nothing to do with assigning missions. If these are Floaters, then it should be the Floating Hyacinth whom he annoyed. Sure, the Marquis could have pulled in a favor, but that doesn&#39;t explain why Jack immediately thought of him instead of his own boss.<br><br>SPaG note:<br>—Missing quotation mark on the second page of the first prompt, (Before &#39;Considering.&#39;)<br><br><u>The Badfic</u><br>Wow, that looks like a mess of a crossover. And Harry Potter is apparently a god? Yep, I&#39;d say this qualifies.<br><br><u>You, as a Member of the Community</u><br>No problems here. You participate on the Board, you&#39;re a regular in chat, and you play a mean game of Cards Against Humanity. You can work with others without issue. I have no concerns as to how well you would fit in.<br><br><u>Verdict</u><br>I&#39;m going to have to say <b>Permission Denied</b>… but barely. Your writing is good, but there a few issues here and there that got underneath my skin. My biggest concern is with your characters. I feel like you should spend a little bit more time tightening them up. <br><br>It was a very close decision on my part. And I&#39;m pretty darn confident that you&#39;ll nail it next time. But for right now? You should take another look.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>While I&#39;m saddened to hear my interest in jerkish characters isn&#39;t universal, I appreciate your saying so. That goes for the rest, as well. <br>I&#39;ll be sure and work on clarifying the language, tightening up the character design, streamlining the comma usage, and making things more readable overall. <br><br>As to the SPaG note- Jack is actually just considering, then replying that if he doesn&#39;t move his TARDIS, it will become one. He doesn&#39;t actually say &#39;considering.&#39; I mean, that&#39;d just be too explicit, wouldn&#39;t it?<br> <br>I also meant to imply that Jack was filling out forms to get the Detective to keep the TARDIS, and was ragging mentally on the Detective for being obsessed with material possessions. I then meant to suggest that he was a hypocrit, as attached as he was to his own- specifically, the journal.<br><br>Any ideas on how I could get that across better?<br><br>I realize clarity and concision take practice above all else, but any tips and tricks would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>And then, more to the point, how much would one thousand Galleons weigh? I need to know because a character in a fic I&#39;m sporking drops a bag of 1,000 Galleons on Cornelius Fudge&#39;s desk. Naturally, my agents are inclined to steal it, and I&#39;m wondering if they could even lift it unassisted.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_(British_coin)">gold sovereign</a> weighs around 8g. That means the bag would weigh 8kg, roughly 17 1/2 pounds. That&#39;s easily liftable - imagine picking up two cats (and then laugh at the mental image, because srsly) - but not something you want to wander around with.<br><br>Unless, of course, you have a magic weight-reducing bag. Doesn&#39;t Hermione cart one of those around?<br><br>I don&#39;t know how much a Galleon actually weighs, though - hence the approximation. A sovereign is an inch across; if it&#39;s twice that size, then you&#39;re talking four times the mass, and suddenly we&#39;re carting around 70 lb in one hand, which is apparently illegal if you&#39;re under 16. Also it&#39;s the weight of a medium-sized child.<br><br>So still doable.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hi. I&#39;m really bad at introductions and don&#39;t quite know what I&#39;m supposed to write here, but I&#39;ll do my best. I&#39;ve just stumbled upon the PPC and think it would be a great way to improve my fiction writing and roleplaying skills. My girlfriend is a much better writer and roleplayer than I am, and I&#39;m frankly insulted by how amazing she is. So that&#39;s the primary reason. The second is because I like the concept-- I&#39;ve come across some horrible fanfiction in my time, and I&#39;m honestly surprised that some of it <i>hasn&#39;t</i> been sporked by someone already. Anyway, I found this community via TV Tropes. My main fandoms are the Doctor Who universe, Firefly/Serenity, and Animorphs. I&#39;m looking forward to getting to know you all.</p>

            <p>Actually, Seven and Twelve are my favorite Doctors (Ten was good, and David Tennant is a great actor, though his Doctor was a bit too human for my taste. In my opinion, a great portrayal of the Doctor is one that reminds the viewer that even though he may prefer the company of humanity, he&#39;s still a Time Lord.) And don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve already looked into the Untempered Schism. I was inspired, though a bit traumatized, in case you were wondering. Thanks anyway though!</p>

            <p>Or two, depending which way you look at it. Ah, well. All I really had to go off of was that you&#39;re a sci-fi fan, so I picked the Doctor I remembered having the best technobabble.<br>Better luck next time, I suppose.<br><br>And as for the Untempered Schism... Yeah, I&#39;ll pass, thanks. Glad to hear you got out alright, but I don&#39;t much fancy my chances with universal epiphanies. Not after my last one. Ugh.</p>

            <p>Firstly, welcome. Very nice to have you.<br>Secondly, allow me to tell you that you have excellent taste in fandoms. Doctor Who is, of course, universally superior to pretty much everything, but Firefly&#39;s gorram shiny as well. I&#39;d recommend Farscape based on those fandoms, but then I&#39;d be off on a fandom tangent, and this is neither the time nor the place.<br><br>I&#39;d offer you something, but, frankly, I&#39;m dedicating code viewable by the whole of the internet-connected human populace to you personally, so you&#39;ve already got a planetary memorial. Several, actually, counting everyone else&#39;s. I imagine you&#39;re virtually glowing with gratitude already (puns!), and anything else would just make you feel guilty.<br><br>I joined the PPC for almost identical reasons, and this is definitely an excellent spot for improving those skills.

            <p>Thanks for the helpful links! I&#39;m definitely planning on reading through the Original Series this weekend. The only issue that I have though is that a lot of them seem to be Tolkien-based. I&#39;m more of a science fiction person, myself, and therefore know basically nothing about LOTR except for the fact that there are hobbits and elves involved and someone throws a ring into a volcano. Will the original series be understandable with my (very) limited knowledge of the source material? Or should I at least watch the movies first?</p>

            <p>So I have been playing around with an idea for a few weeks, and I finally decided I am going to start working on it.  As the subject indicates this is going to be a Star Wars/Star Trek Crossover.<br><br>We have a Imperial-I Class Star Destroyer from basically right before the Battle of Endor winding up in basically in the STO Mainstream Timeline.  It will encounter basically an Expy of the Enterprise-D.  What I want to do is really give life to both ships, so instead of just randomly creating names, I figured I would ask if anyone has any of the following they would like to make an appearance.<br><br>1. Agents from either Universe<br>2. Star Trek Online Captains/Bridge Officers<br>3. Old Republic Characters<br>4. Any other character that fits within either Universe<br><br>If anyone is interested feel free to post a name, rank, species, and maybe a brief description.  Because even if they will be a cameo, I want to make sure I get the essence right.<br><br>If anyone does want to submit a character, I have a few restrictions.<br><br>1.  No Force Users.  Force users at this time in the Star Wars Universe are very rare, and I already have a concentration that pushes reasonable belief.  <br>2.  No Borg.  There are very few Federation Aligned Borg, and I&#39;m already using my STO Liberated Borg Bridge Officer.<br>3.  No Klingons.  This is set a time where the Federation and Klingon Empire at war, and the Klingons will be one of the enemies that will be encountered in the course of the story.<br>4.  No Rank above Lieutenant.  I already have top ranked officers set.<br><br>Roles I am specifically looking for if anyone wants to suggest anything:<br><br>1.  11 Black Squadron TIE Pilots.<br>2.  6 Gamma Squadron TIE Bomber Pilots.<br>3.  9 Obsidian Squadron TIE Pilots.<br>4.  6 Sigma Squadron TIE Interceptor Pilots.<br>5.  6 Avenger Squadron TIE Interceptor Pilots.<br>6.  2 Omega Squadron TIE Defender Pilots.<br>7.  3 Onyx Squadron TIE Defender Pilots.<br>8.  2 Lambda Class Shuttle Pilots.<br>9.  Assorted Bridge Techs, TIE Mechanics, Medical Staff, Stormtroopers.<br><br>On the Federation Side<br><br>1.  1 Transporter Chief<br>2.  3 Nurses<br>3.  1 Bartender<br>4.  5 Security Redshirts.<br>5.  1 Conn Officer<br>6.  1 Ship&#39;s Counselor<br>7.  2 Engineers<br>8.  1 Communications Officer<br>9.  Assorted other Techs<br><br>   </p>

In fact, you might say you&#39;re in a horror movie.<br><br>***<br><br>This is will be something along the lines of a Horror RP. Instead of interacting with fellow agents, agents interact with whatever the cruel and frankly horrifying things you boarders come up with.<br><br>Like so:<br><i><br>Mattman: Agent Matthew looks horrified, slowly moving through the corridors<br><br>Matt Cipher: Matthew encounters Bill Cipher.<br><br>Mattman: Matthew runs into a room, further horrified.<br><br>Iximaz: And then he encounters his own dead body, guts spilling out of his opened stomach.<br><br>Mattman: The still alive Matthew let&#39;s lose his midnight snack.<br><br>Scapegrace: The hurl becomes an eldritch abomination of a Flareon.<br><br>Mattman: Matthew&#39;s conflicted emotions of &#39;Cute&#39; and &#39;What is This I can&#39;t comprehend&#39; causes him to flee the room.<br></i><br>And so on and so forth.</p>

            <p>The power has gone out in Medical. The red emergency lights being the only thing to light your way. You are trapped in a seemingly endless maze. You (and your partner, if your writer wants) have yet to encounter another agent, and everything you do encounter are extremely fitting for the date. In fact, you might say you're in a horror movie.</p>

<p>Here is where we begin the act of scaring the ever living crap out of your agents.</p>

            <p>Jack Riggs and the Detective turned slowly to face one another. </p>

<p>The silence was almost a sound of its own for a moment. One could've heard a pin drop. Both of them turned into the darkness of Medical, curtains drawn on one side of the bed, pale against the sudden shadows of the room.</p>

<p>"Nice place you have here," said the Detective drily.</p>

<p>Jack shushed him.</p>

<p>"Okay, guessing this doesn't happen often. . ." the Detective murmured to himself, raising his hands defensively when Jack shot a look at him.</p>

<p>Both were listening keenly. After another moment of the utter silence, the Detective's irritated squint became a thousand yard stare, and his face grew pale.</p>

<p>"Do you hear anything?" he said softly, still staring vacantly into the dark.</p>

<p>"Not a thing," Jack said, shifting back to a more comfortable position in his chair by the Detective's bedside. "Power outages happen on occasion, even in HQ. Someone's probably on their way to fix it."</p>

<p>The Detective rolled his eyes.</p>

<p>"Jack, what happens in a power outage? People freak, or at least get irritated. Often, people get scared. After all, most species have some fear of the dark," he said, plucking the IV from his arm, sitting up on his hospital bed and grabbing his coat from its edge.</p>

<p>"They're not wrong," said the hunter ruefully, raising an eyebrow before looking at the Detective. "So?"</p>

<p>"So. . . The irritated and the fearful aren't known for their vows of silence," he said, looking Jack dead in the eye.</p>

<p>"So why can you practically cut this one with a knife?"</p>

            <p>"We should leave," said Jack darkly. "I've seen this movie before, and it never ends well."</p>

<p>He walked over toward the door of Medical, pausing and looking back for his partner.</p>

<p>"Yep, good idea. . ." said the Detective absently, shrugging into his coat and shoving aside the curtains to examine the row of hospital beds, strangely silent in the dark.</p>

            <p>The room was too dark for details, but it seemed like an humanoid shape, with two odd forms behind it, each one which seemed starting from where the shoulders of the shape should be.</p>

            <p>He quickly stepped backwards towards the door, not losing sight of the creature.</p>

<p>"Who are you talking to?" asked Jack, brow furrowing in concern. "And why couldn't this have happened in the cafeteria?" he added in a mutter, looking around the room for the smelling salts. </p>

<p>"Fella over here in the corner," said the Detective, still staring at the figure, not blinking. "Time Lords have slightly better night vision- not surprised you can't see him. Looking for something?" he asked, catching Jack's searching gaze in his periphery.</p>

<p>"Salt, iron- anything that'll sting the occult," he said. </p>

<p>The Detective nodded, considering. "Not a bad idea, considering where we are. Might add flashlight to that list, so we can get a good look at our mute friend. I can see him as is, though, so I'll be the one keep an eye on him and stay near the door. You have a look around. I suggest you start with the cabinets over there, since they're accessed pretty regularly." </p>

<p>As Jack went to search in the room, the Detective addressed the figure once more. He stood straight, looking as intimidating as it was possible to look in a hospital gown and a trench coat.</p>

<p>"Who are you, then?"</p>

            <p>“WEEPING ANGEL!” they said, practically together.</p>

<p>“Jack, don’t take your eyes off that statue for a second,” said the Detective, feeling focused and alert for once in his life. </p>

<p>Jack very nearly rolled his eyes. “Thanks so much. I’ve totally never heard of a Weeping Angel before. Just shouted that because I felt like it.” Sighing, he continued, “Any ideas?”</p>

<p>The Detective bit his lip, thinking. Angels could move when you were looking at them. . . That which holds the image of an angel. . .</p>

<p>He did have an idea. </p>

<p>“Jack, I’ve got a plan.”</p>

<p>“Fantastic!”</p>

<p>“Walk out of this room and leave me here.”</p>

<p>“Less fantastic. You do realize these things don’t just grab one victim and leave, right? And since when are you the type for the big, heroic sacrifice?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a plan, Jack, and very little time to explain it. Now, go ahead and blink. I need your eyes in the best possible condition for this. Ready?”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Jack. The Detective stared at the angel. The light was beginning to hurt his eyes, and he was feeling the sting of holding them open.</p>

<p>“Good. Now you?”</p>

<p>“I just nodded,” the Detective said. “Ready? I’m going to blink. . . Now!”</p>

<p>He screwed his eyes shut, and felt the moisture return to them. </p>

<p>"Alright," the Detective said. "Now, I'm going to walk over to you, and you're going to hand me that flashlight without moving the beam from the statue. Then, without looking away from the Angel at any point, you are then going to walk out of this room, and leave me here."</p>

<p>Jack scoffed. "You can forget that right now."</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, Jack- I've got a plan. Don't have time to explain it now, though. Rest assured, you hit the nail on the head when you said I'm not one for heroic sacrifices. One more blink before we start. You first. Ready?"
They blinked, and the Detective edged toward the flashlight. As he reached out, the Detective prized the flashlight from his hands. Suddenly, the beam wavered, as the Detective chuckled. “We’re literally passing the torch!” he said. Jack just steadied the beam, sighing. </p>

<p>“Now leave,” he told Jack, “and don’t take your eyes off it for one moment.”</p>

<p>“I still don’t understand-”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t expect you to. Trust me when I say that I have a plan- now get out!” the Detective snarled.</p>

<p>Jack edged his way back toward the door, sparing the Detective a final, concerned glance before shutting it. </p>

<p>“Now, angel- let’s get down to business, shall we? You can’t move when you’re being seen, can you? Well, since you can’t speak, let’s prove that, shall we?” </p>

<p>The Detective switched off the flashlight.</p>

<p>A half second later, he switched it back on again, and the angel stood before him. The Detective took a worried half-step back. Bit closer than he’d been expecting. </p>

<p>“Right, no worries there, then. Now, second fact is, that which holds the image of an angel becomes itself an angel. But everyone knows that,” he said, devilish grin breaking onto his face. He practically lived for these moments. “So the really clever bit is that angels count as someone looking at you. And you may not be an Angel, given that you just showed up at random. Maybe you’re a hallucination, maybe something I don’t even know about yet, but I reckon,” he said, straining not to blink but loving every second of his moment in the spotlight, “You still have to play by the rules.” </p>

<p>The Detective bent, placing the flashlight on the floor, and illuminating the angel, light bouncing off the cabinet behind the Time Lord. </p>

<p>“Oh, and, guess what?” he said, stepping out of the way of the cabinet and clapping a hand on the statue, staring over its shoulder at the face of the angel’s reflection in the medicine cabinet. </p>

<p>“‘That which holds the image,’ remember? So reflections still count.”</p>

            <p>While he couldn't quite see it, the Angel couldn't be certain of this- or, at least, that's what he was banking on. </p>

<p>Still keeping both eyes on the statue, the Detective fumbled in his coat pocket for his sonic screwdriver. The room took on a green cast as the Detective activated it, pointing it at the flashlight. He could use the sonic waves to generate some flow of electricity, keeping the bulb glowing. He knew he had to keep the bulb dim in case it went out again- that way his night vision wouldn't be completely shot. While he still had the advantage of the reflection, the Detective backed away toward the door, keeping his screwdriver aimed at the torch. </p>

<p>Fumbling for the knob from behind, he wrenched the door open and flung himself through, slamming the door and hearing something BANG against the metal from the other side. He switched the settings of the screwdriver, and cold-welded the lock shut, turning to face Jack, gasping out, "I think we should go- that door won't hold it for long."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but what did you do?" Jack asked. He was standing, arms crossed, out in the hallway.</p>

<p>"I'll explain later!" the Detective unwittingly quoted, fear making his voice much deeper as they ran through the red-tinted halls.</p>

<p>They should've been headed toward the exit.</p>

            <p>Before any of the Agents could react, both of them were transported in another dark corridor. Both the walls and the ceilings looked in bad shape, and a hazy atmosphere was lying around. Some red liquid charged with energy was flowing through the corridors, and little things seemed to move in the shadows.</p>

            <p>“Bang up job spotting the angel, Jack! Really spectacular! I thought hunters were supposed to be observant!” shouted the Detective, facedown on the floor.</p>

<p>Jack rolled his eyes. “Nah, I spotted him, I just thought I’d let him be a surprise!” he said, making spirit fingers. He hadn’t gotten up first, so, to any observer, he appeared to be making snow angels with deformed wings.</p>

<p>The Detective grunted, shifting to his feet and picking his glasses back up off the floor. “Where are we, anyway?” he asked, wiping the specs on his shirt. </p>

<p>“No idea,” said Jack, climbing slowly to his feet. “Angels send you back to the past to feed on the potential energy of an unlived time stream. But if the PPC ever looked like this, I was away for it.”</p>

<p>Filing away the suggestion of a past prolonged absence on the part of his partner, the Detective rolled his eyes. “I think we’ve already covered that this probably isn’t an angel. At least not a subspecies I’ve heard of. They don't operate this way, and they don't teleport into hallways, for a start. Plus, we met that first one totally out of the blue," he said, also climbing to his feet and taking in his surroundings. "No. . . Not Angels."</p>

<p>We’ve been transported somewhere entirely different by not-Weeping Angels that are pretending to be angels. Spooky. So probably something designed to scare us. And transported somewhere, mind, with a horrible standard of general maintenance. Also. . .” he scanned the area with his screwdriver, “energy charged red liquid. Method of power conduction? Flooding of the electrical systems? Vaporization of the liquid could result in the atmosphere, providing a tolerable atmosphere for whatever those moving things are. Might even be toxic to either of us. . .” he murmured absently.</p>

<p>The Detective looked around the room- some place he didn’t understand, or expect in the slightest. </p>

<p>“Interesting. . .” he said with a grin.</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Jack, squinting. "But we still need to find our way back."</p>

            <p>Jack had unholstered his sidearm, retracted the bolt, and fired- twelve times, by the Detective's count. Each bullet hit its mark, and Jack's expression didn't change once. His eyes were as dead as the little red-eyed creatures. </p>

<p>"Sorry, but I've seen this episode Scooby Doo before, and- no offense- I thought he was a p\*\*\*\* then."</p>

<p>The Detective just looked at Jack, raising an eyebrow and uncovering his ears- gunfire in a tight corridor wasn't quiet. "Why the hell did you bring your sidearm to medical?" he demanded.</p>

            <p>“Any ideas?”</p>

<p>“Well,” the Detective said calmly, though he had to raise his voice over the rattling of the chains. “Totally unaffected by gunshots, and probably rather irritated that we’ve tried it to find out.”</p>

<p>“Those don’t sound like ideas, D!” said Jack, slowly stepping back and away from the shadows.</p>

<p>“Well, they do in fact add up to one inescapable conclusion, Jack, if you could be bothered to think it through.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, and what’s that?” demanded Jack, aiming his thoroughly useless pistol. Some people had safety blankets. . .</p>

<p>“LEG IT!” shouted the Detective, and together they sprinted through the corridor ahead.</p>

<p>“Any ideas what these are?!” shouted Jack. </p>

<p>“Not a one,” the Detective returned, jumping over one of the shadowy blobs. Aware he was still in his medical gown under that coat, the Detective glared at the blob to keep it from looking up. </p>

            <p>The thing was actually wearing a blue mask with round eyes, a bar making up a nose, and a sad expression. Something was also seemingly carved on the forehead's mask.</p>

<p>The monster tried to slash with its hands the Detective as it jumped over him, but missed him. It then made a strange hissing sound, and suddenly, some sort of ice crystal formed in the air and was shot towards the two agents, passing a few inches over their heads. Some of the other monsters began shooting other ice crystals, but were fortunately inaccurate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a roar began to accompany the chains' rattling.</p>

            <p>The two agents hit a junction with a conveniently placed mirror.</p>

<p>Floating above the mob of monsters was some sort of very tall, although gaunt for its size, humanoid monster. It wore a tatterred trenchcoat with traces of blood on it, and chains were rattling around it. It also looked like it hadn't feet, or legs, for that matter. It had gloved hand which looked like they were dripping blood which were holding what looked like revolvers, but these weapons had the size of rifles. On its head was a paperbag with a grin painted where the mouth would be, and one opening for a red right eye looking like a gunshot, with traces of dried blood.</p>

<p>The other ways forwards were left and right.</p>

            <p>Jack was patting at the mirror, horrorstruck. “How the hell did we not see our reflections running down the hallway?” he demanded of the Detective. </p>

<p>“What, you think I know? It’s obvious we’re dealing with some kind of reality warper with an Alucard complex,” the Detective snapped, turning back from the mirror to face the monster.</p>

<p>“Although. . . there’s a chance the mirror was there the whole time, and the low-lying fog obscured our reflections. . . Dammit! Multiple variables, screwing with my brain. OKAY- from the beginning.”</p>

<p>The Detective stood, dead-eyeing the creature, as Jack looked at him like he was mad. The Detective stared, taking in every detail. The wear of the trench coat, the obvious fact that the bag had been used to cover someone’s head in a previous shooting. It had shot several victims, apparently, as the blood around the eye was dry, but its gloved hands were dripping. No other bodies apparent. So observing, the agent opened his mouth to speak, then tilted his head. </p>

<p>“Ah, screw it,” he said, “OPEN FIRE!” and Jack slammed his spare mag into the pistol, firing three shots into the wailing, chain-ridden monstrosity, before they legged it into the left corridor at random. Every good Whovian knows to turn left, after all. </p>

            <p>The Reaper was barely annoyed by the gunshots. But it was enough for it to answer in its own way. It leveled one of its guns. Purple orbs of energy formed in front of it, before it used them to bombard the crossroads, wrecking havoc and blasting the poor mirror to oblivion.</p>

<p>In front of the agents was a room with big stairs inside. Unfortunately, it also looked like a pretty long sprint to do.</p>

            <p>"Not the word I'd use!" yelled Jack as they pelted into the large room. </p>

<p>"Well, I can almost guarantee those ice spikes being shot at us before would've dinged the mirror. Cracked it in some way."</p>

<p>"Shame, that," said Jack, slightly irked at the ineffectiveness of his firearm. "'Just once, I'd like to meet an alien menace that wasn't immune to bullets,'" Jack quoted in a mutter, holstering his sidearm. </p>

<p>"Well, it is actually a shame," said the Detective, pacing quickly before standing stock still in the center of the room, his gaze taking on the vacancy of mental abstraction. "As there wasn't a crack in that mirror. And we didn't see our reflections- atmosphere wasn't thick enough to block the images. The mirror only appeared once we got to the end of the hallway. . . And if they wanted to kill us, there are a lot more effective methods than sending us here to meet some bizarre monster. Which could've killed us without a thought as we ran down the corridor, instead of relying on monsters, so. . ."</p>

<p>Jack glanced at the Detective, lips pursed in indecision, and ran up a few of the stairs. </p>

<p>"I don't think that's necessary, Jack. . ." the Detective murmered dazedly. </p>

<p>"I'm taking the high ground," Jack called down, turning and aiming the pistol at the doorway. </p>

<p>"Good- you'll have a head start on the monster that's IMPERVIOUS TO BULLETS," snarked the Detective, rolling his eyes. </p>

<p>"Not leaving, D," Jack called down.</p>

<p>"Much as I appreciate the sentiment, Jack, I doubt that'll be necessary," said the Detective. "I think I know what's going on here. We're not trapped in some alternate reality, we never have been. I seriously doubt we've actually moved, though we may be in very real danger. None of this makes any sense. Everything going dark in medical? The vanishing? Angels acting as transport? The mirror was the real giveaway. But you just couldn't resist, could you?" called the Detective out at the empty room. "Couldn't resist tipping your hand? That little bit of irony, the touch of the dramatic? I understand, really. But I've beat your game- solved your little puzzle. AM I RIGHT?!" The Detective snapped, bellowing now.</p>

            <p>The man waved his arms even faster. "Look out, you've got some evil magic chains around you now!"</p>

<p>The two DIS Weeds wheeled around to look at the woman. </p>

<p>"<i>Is she one of them</i>?" asked Weed-Thirteen to its colleague.</p>

<p>"<i>No idea,</i>" replied Weed-Seventy. "<i>Just... be cautious.</i>"</p>

<p>"Well, she's about to get murderlized by the magic chains there," said the man in the power armour. "Sh-shouldn't we do something?"</p>

<p>A scream from the left briefly distracted the agents manning the checkpoint. Weed-Seventy waved in the direction of the noise. "<i>De Grasse, Tacitus, go and investigate that.</i>"</p>

<p>"But—"</p>

<p>"<i>We can deal with this. Go and see if it's someone who needs help.</i>"</p>

<p>Gaspard looked from the Weeds to the woman and then back at the Weeds. If they wanted to deal with that, they could go on right ahead, he figured. "A-aye, sir. C-come on, T-Tacitus. Let's back away from the oncoming bloodbath."</p>

<p>The Zorua didn't need to be told twice— he practically bolted away from the checkpoint as soon as he could.</p>

All of the Roses were now horribly mutilated, burnt all over, and some bore the marks of the deaths inflicted upon them by the agents. Each only had one, now, and it was impossible to tell what they had originally been, for now they were charred and flaky.

<p>There's a sharp pain in Aviator's stomach, the unmistakable psychic signature of her daughter returning. </p>

<p>The flames grow hotter, larger. The Rose Potters are quickly consumed by the flames, though a male figure stumbles out of it and into The Aviator's arms. Burned beyond recognition.</p>

<p>"<em>Rina...</em>" The man says, the voice revealing it to be Alex. He slumps over, dead.</p>

            <p>“Well, off to the ICU we go!” said the Guardsman cheerfully as he pushed the hovercart laden with supplies forward. “And we’d better make it quick, too. Dunno if those guys over there are in trouble.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what that generator on the cart is for, right?” said Naya as she looked behind her at the cargo in question being pushed around by her partner. “Yeah. Let’s just hurry, all right? This place gives me the creeps.” The quarian stepped to the side and planted a miniature floodlight on the floor, then stepped back towards the trolley to grab another. “What that Security Weed said in the lobby wasn’t exactly reassuring either. People reporting strange incidents or visions or new rooms. Is this some sort of airborne hallucinogen?”</p>

<p>The Guardsman’s particular facial expression was hard to guess behind his gas mask, but the shrug of his shoulders said all. “I blame the new architecture on the plothole. We both saw that abattoir, right? Medical might’ve landed on top of some location and blended with it. As for the visions… well, this just makes this situation look like a cheap horror movie. No idea about hallucinogens, but the air tests from the outpost back in the lobby come back clean. Not taking any chances, though. By the gods, shame on me if I'm ever going to forget putting on a gas mask after last week's incident.”</p>

<p>“Well, good thing you've remembered to put it on, then,” grumbled Naya as she placed another floodlight on the floor. “Now I’m just waiting for the eventual jumpscare. I mean, look at this place. Long grey hallway, darkness ahead, semi-darkness behind us, doors on all sides.”</p>

<p>"Thanks for jinxing us."</p>

<p>"You're welcome."</p>

<p>A second voice answered, "I heard. We'll just have to teach him better, won't we?" The two voices laughed, a horrible sound, one that chilled the blood, one that made you want to run away, but also made you want to find whatever it was that made the sound and kill it at the same time, before falling silent. The silence did not last long. The agents soon heard a slithering sound coming from all around them- the floor, the ceiling, the walls, and the far ends of the hallways.</p>

            <p>The Guardsman sighed. "Well, onwards. Intensive Care needs us, wot."</p>

<p>Naya, considerably less nonchalant about the situation, looked around and tried to determine the source of the noise. "Shouldn't we be worried about that slithering sound?" she asked, reaching for her Carnifex pistol on her hip holster. </p>

<p>"Not especially," said the Guardsman. "Big whoop, someone hijacked the PA system and is currently playing around with the sprinkler system. It's just going to cause a bigger mess for the poor guys in Building Maintenance. Still..." The Time Lord reached down and unbuttoned the clasp on his staser pistol's holster.

Thankfully, due to the hovercart not having wheels, the progress wasn't too severely impeded by the reptilian tide.

            <p>The DIA agents reflexively ducked and turned away from the swarm. Fortunately for the quarian, her suit's kinetic barriers stopped the high-velocity snakes from reaching her; her partner was not as lucky. He took the full brunt of the swarm to the side and was thrown off the cart into the writhing mass of snakes below, where he was swept away by the living tide. </p>

<p>"Emiran!" Naya shouted as she unclipped a incendiary grenade from her belt. She threw the grenade 'upstream', torching the oncoming tide and thinning out the flow of snakes. She then hopped off the cart and ran after her partner, drawing her sidearm as she gave chase. "Right, you two jokers are in for it now," she said to nobody in particular. </p>

            <p>The Guardsman managed to find his footing and stood up, throwing off the snakes as he rattled off a steady stream of swear words in Gallifreyan. He managed to crush the last few under his boots as Naya turned the corner and caught up to him. He groggily held up a hand and tried to shoo her away. "P-poisoned. F-feeling off, get b-back f-f-for a m-minute here..."</p>

<p>"Your medkit, idiot!" shouted Naya as she skid to a halt. "You've got cure-all antidote in there!"</p>

<p>"R-r-right." The Guardsman clumsily reached into his holster and fumbled with his staser pistol. "J-just gonna sh-shoot it u-up..." He looked at his hand. This wasn't what he was aiming for. Out of its own accord, his hand tightened around the pistol's grip and pulled it out of the holster. "W-wait! N-Naya, get cl-clear!"</p>

<p>"Crap." Naya ducked into a nearby alcove as a staser bolt missed her by a few centimetres. She swore profusely as she fumbled with her own medkit and pulled out the antidode injector pen. Did she really have to do <i>everything</i> around here?</p>

<p>The Guardsman's vision was blurring and he felt uncomfortably hot. He tried to fight the influence that was causing him to take step after step towards his partner all while loosing a few shots in her direction. After what felt like an eternity, he saw a flicker of movement out of the corner of his eye. He fought as hard as he could against the urge to turn around and succeeded in managing to freeze on the spot. </p>

<p>Never was he more relieved to see Naya drop her tactical cloak and slam the antidote injector into his arm.</p>

<p>Naya quickly pushed herself away from her partner and took cover again, listening him gasp and cough in the middle of the hallway. She murmured a prayer and said: "Look, I know you don't like needles, but shooting at me was totally uncalled for."</p>

<p>The Time Lord groaned and propped himself against a wall. "I got spooked, okay?" he said between breaths. "I'm good now— but remember the last time I took the antidote? I got—"</p>

<p>"You got hyper, yeah," said Naya as she emerged from cover. "Oh boy. This day isn't getting any better, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Getting more intense is what you mean, right?" said the Guardsman, marching back towards the hovercart with a spring in his step. "WOO! I FEEL ALIVE TODAY!"</p>

<p>Naya facepalmed. "Ancestors, give me strength."</p>

            <p>"YOU BASTARDS! YOU WILL NOT ESCAPE OUR WRATH! DIE, YOU WORTHLESS HUMANOIDS, DIE! GET THEM, CHILDREN!" More of the tiny snakes leaped for Naya and the Guardsman. After a moment of silence, the second voice spoke in a softer tone.</p>

<p>"My dearest," it said. "It seems to me that these humanoids are better prepared than we thought. Perhaps we should give them a taste of our true power?" The first voice laughed its hideous laugh again.</p>

<p>"My sweet, I would say that you are a genius. Let us personally make them suffer for the deaths of so many of our young ones." Another slithering sound came from down the hallway, but the creatures that made this sound had to be far larger than the swarm of snakes still attacking the agents.</p>

            <p>"Any opportunity to do cardio is a good opportunity. So, do we run towards or away from the spooky noises?" said the Guardsman as he checked the safety on his pistol and aimed it down the corridor towards the source of the noise. "Also, do we take the cart or...?"</p>

<p>"What do you think, genius?" said Naya as she sprinted away from the noise. As she ran, she set a few sticky bombs to the floor and walls in preparation for the bigger-sounding nasties. "I've got our front covered— you blast things that pop out of the side, okay?"</p>

<p>"Will do!" said the Guardsman cheerfully as he fell into pace a few metres behind his partner, pistol at the ready. "Snap shooting, ready to rock!"</p>

            <p>The serpents on the floor froze, while the ones bursting through the walls, the ceiling, and the floor on the side of the bombs with Naya and the Guardsman continued to give chase. Soon after, the larger sounds stopped. They remained silent until the sticky bombs exploded, but then they resumed.</p>

<p>"Clever little humanoids, to hold us at bay with those!" the monsters cried. "We can use you! Yes, it would be a waste just to kill you. We'll just have to turn you instead!"</p>

            <p>"How much further until the checkpoint?" said Naya as she glanced over her shoulder. "I don't think I an run any more—"</p>

<p>"Hey, up ahead! HEY GUYS, WE NEED SOME FIRE SUPPORT!" yelled the Guardsman, waving his arms. "GOT A TIDE OF SNAKES AND WE NEED PEST CONTROL!"</p>

<p>The DIA officers manning the checkpoint first glanced at the two agents, then at the massive surge of snakes, then back at the two runners. The quicker one of the two grabbed his own incendiary grenade and hurled it past Naya and the Guardsman while the other scrambled to his feet and hefted his sword. "What—"</p>

<p>Quarian and Time Lord vaulted over the crude barricade and settled in beside their colleagues. "Not much to be said. Ran up against killer snake entities," said the Guardsman as he started firing into the crowd of snakes. "Apparently they want us to become their servants or some nonsense like that. Not gonna happen, not on my watch. Nope. Zilch. Nada. Nyet."</p>

<p>"Have either of you seen agents yet?" asked Naya as she passed grenades to the rest of the group.</p>

<p>"Quite a few, actually," said the taller of the checkpoint guards. "We directed them to the exit— Townsend confirmed their arrival over encrypted comms and we had an actual, physical runner confirm the news. We're just thankful that the Things can't override our radio— imagine the mess if they could override our comms."</p>

<p>Naya promptly facepalmed. "Okay, so you jinxed us. Thanks for that, Becker."</p>

<p>"Sorry."</p>

<p>"You know she'll hold it over our heads until we find a way to repay her," the other said.</p>

<p>"But if we don't, they'll get away," replied the other. "We can't allow that, can we?"</p>

<p>"Only that we're being chased after by this weird entity that is trying to kill or assimilate us into the Borg consciousness or something!" said the Guardsman in a maniacally happy tone. "Said something about us being the 'game masters' or something of the sort. Well, I say that I want more spooky and less kill-y. Is that possible or...?"</p>

<p>Naya looked at her partner. Though her face was obstructed by an opaque visor, the Time Lord knew she had just rolled her eyes at him. "Are you seriously making demands to the Suvian whatchamacallit that's hunting us right now?"</p>

            <p>"You have asked for horror, and they have asked for help. Your wishes shall be granted." The world twisted and spun around the agents before shattering into a million pieces. It hung like that for a moment, shards of the images they had last seen scattered across a vast, empty space, before the world suddenly put itself together. When it did, the agents were in an empty white corridor, lit by little red lights on the ceiling.</p>

<p>The PA system started once more, and the voice commanded, "Hunt them or escape, as your roles dictate. I expect to be compensated for my troubles when this is over."</p>

<p>"We know," one of the reptilian voices called. "We will give you what you ask. Now, dearest, shall we hunt?"</p>

<p>"We shall," answered the other. The slithering began anew.</p>

            <p>He pulled out his portal generator and opened a portal— and a massive one at that. A portal nearly as long as the corridor itself opened overhead, letting a howling, frigid arctic air screech through. The temperature in the hallway dipped by tens of degrees in the time it took for someone to say 'you wouldn't happen to have a spare jacket on you?'</p>

<p>The four DIA agents hastily used their disguise generators to acquire nice thick parkas before looking at the rather pitiful carpet of snakes that had slowed to a standstill. "Well, that's that," said Becker. "Just, er, what now?"</p>

<p>The other three agents drew their sidearms and began blasting away at the larger snakes in the group. "Do you really have to ask?" said Naya.</p>

            <p>The portal abruptly closed, the generator exploded, and the world shattered once more. When it put itself together, Naya and the Guardsman found themselves alone, in a blank, white corridor. Even the hissing voices had gone silent, and the snakes had vanished. The corridor ended a foot behind them, and it appeared to go on with only a single path available in front of them. There were no turns, no alternate passageways, just a single hallway, and on the floor of that hallway was a glowing blue line.</p>

<p>"Please proceed on the highlighted route," the PA said. "If you do not, you will be terminated."</p>

<p>"<i>Fine</i>," grumbled the Time Lord, checking the power indicator on his pistol and sidling up to his side of the corridor. "Let's just walk into the blindingly obvious trap set by a crappy Saturday morning cartoon Suvian villain. Gods, sometimes I wish I could decide to retire already and do something normal with my life."</p>

<p>"But then you'd miss Terabyte and me," said Naya. "Seriously. Retiring sets you back quite a bit."</p>

It revealed that the floor and the wall around the door were stone, covered in some kind of sticky, white substance that hung in strands from the walls and covered the floor. It occasionally lumped together, forming a kind of large boulder, and there were stone columns that looked like they had been carved by humanoid hands.</p>

            <p>Apecian was sitting back in his chair, hands behind his head, while Michael filled out the seemingly endless paperwork. Suddenly, the lights cut out. There was complete darkness for a moment before the emergency lights turned on, and when they did, the room was not the same as it had been before. Apecian picked up his hammer, which had been lying on the floor, while Michael pulled out a pair of pink-tinted glasses from his pocket and put them on.</p>

<p>He began to walk towards the hall, but stopped when his partner said, "Hey, remember adventuring procedure? Barbarian always goes first." He took his place in front of the Michael, then the two carefully crept into the hall.</p>

<p>Slightly more worrisome was the large shadow looming at the end of the corridor. The sound of its breathing undercut the zombie moans-- the combination of which was a positively spine tingling noise. </p>

<p>Hands were reaching out from the coffins, desperately grasping at thin air. </p>

<p>Further ahead, the large figure started making a rustling noise. It suddenly leapt forward and scuttled towards the agents, revealing itself to be a hideously large tarantula— one the size of a small car. Its eight eyes were fixed on the agents and its pedipalps seemed to ooze with some foul liquid. </p>

            <p>Apecian shook his head. "Come on, give us something fun," he muttered. "Hey! You! Person who looks like a spider! What do you want?"</p>

<p>Michael, meanwhile, was looking at the coffins. They were crying out, they needed help! He couldn't just leave was whatever inside to die. But what if it was dangerous? He considered, then decided to wait. If they could take out the spider, he could help them, but he wouldn't risk unleashing something just as or more dangerous than the spider that they already faced before they were ready to deal with it.</p>

It was a split second of noises - crashing, squelching. A great howl reverberating through the corridor. A horrible, fleshy scent of iron. A huge, hairy blur, clouds of choking dust rolling through the air. 
Then, the spider dropped the leaking, ripped remains of the arm to the floor. The entity inside the coffin had enough of the situation, and was giving the world the silent treatment. </p>

<p>'Found me in a baaaaaad space, bud.' It skittered closer, eight eyes staring right ahead. There was dust and blood gleaming on its mandibles 'Listen, listen. Listen listen listen. Can you do a favour? Can you do me a favour, bud?' </p>

It appears to be a large warehouse-like space lined with large shelves laden with bulging packages. There's some lighting in the room— large neon strips near the ceiling fill the room with a frigid, flat white light.</p>

<p>Straight ahead, there is a door much like the one leading to the examination room. Screaming sounds can be heard behind it.</p>

<p>Figures are moving in between the shelving units... maybe. It could be your imagination, however. </p>

            <p>The laughter continues in the distance. There seems to be more movement between the shelves now— and one might almost make out a head or a set of eyes glinting through the packages. Of course, it could always be the lighting playing tricks on the eyes... but speaking of the lights, the neons have noticeably dimmed over the past few seconds and have started flickering. Something tells Ajax that they won't stay on for long. </p>

<p>The screams— which have now stopped— seem familiar.  </p>

<p>"LEVY!" He shouted, breaking into a sprint. His Talaria flapped to life at his feet, making each stride longer, speed increasing with each flap.</p>

<p>He opened the door just as the lights flickered out, but what sight greeted him?</p>

            <p>It looked exactly like before— except there was a large oil-painting portrait of Levy standing on an easel in the middle of the room. It was surrounded by ornate wreaths, flowers, and little candles. </p>

<p>The Nurse, who had been standing off to the side up until now, gently closed the door behind Ajax. "I'm sorry, but I did all I could."</p>

            <p>He fell to his knees, and looked at the painting. She was smiling. That one smile that always seemed to say "I'm here. Everything is going to be okay."</p>

<p>"H-how?" He asked. "She was just here. Nothing was wrong. Nothing." He turned to the nurse, his blue eye glowing. "HOW?!" He yelled, a blue wave of energy erupting from his body. The flowers wilted, and all the medical supplies dissolved into water.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Levy couldn't move. She could see, but everything looked like it was a moving oil-painting. She could tell that it was a memorial, the flowers and the candles being a dead giveaway. She could see Ajax collapsed in front of her, his mouth moving. Apparently she couldn't hear either.</p>

<p>His blue eye flared to life, signifying the activation of his active skill, <em>Double Attack Stance-Wt</em>. He stood up, pivoting on his feet and setting the outer edge of the scythe blade on the Nurse's throat. She wanted to do something to tell him she was here. She wanted to tell him she was alive. She tried to focus.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>The chain like detail on the frame of the oil-painting glowed blue, and another blue wave erupted from the painting. The Fire on the candles became water, and what little light there was became calm and inviting.</p>

<p><em>The Sacred Blue Chains</em></p>

<p>Ajax let out a sigh of relief. Bringing the scythe behind him, he prepared to swing to swing. "You have ten seconds to explain that."</p>

            <p>"Too late," gurgled the Nurse as he, for lack of a better word, evaporated into smoke. </p>

<p>Three of the four walls of the room suddenly turned transparent, revealing rows upon rows of seats occupied by figures in white robes. One of them stood up, checked its clipboard, adjusted its glasses, and pointed towards Ajax. "Attend to your patient, please. She doesn't have much time," it said. "Don't mind us, we'll just take notes." And with that, the figure sat down and watched the agent, eagerly waiting for something to happen in the operating theatre. </p>

            <p>"What patient?" He swung his scythe in their direction, a wave of energy cutting through each of them. "All I see is a memorial to my dead friend." He picked up the painting trapping Levy and left the room through a door.</p>

<p>The image of Levy disappeared with the slam of the door. A sly smirk plastered on her face and the thought of <em>good one Ajax</em> being the last thought.</p>

<p>The PA blared to life: "Stay calm. Expect rescue within 18 hours. Happy Halloween."</p>

<p>((The PAD Board created by Ajax and Levy allowed Ajax to cut through the figures, so It won't happen again))</p>

            <p>A rumble began, and a noise sounded, growing louder and louder until it nearly burst Ajax's eardrums. The sound grew more and more powerful until, when it finally reached the mouth, it blasted the door open and threw Ajax back out into the circular room. The door slammed shut again with the force of its recoil, then blasted open again, repeating this several times until the roar finally died away and the door was left closed.</p>

            <p>Ok, so I&#39;ve got a series of reading recordings that I figure I should post.<br><br>Most of these are at least somewhat NSFW (usually because of the contents of the thing being read).

            <p>In that selfsame tweet, I might add, that it was &quot;Animals representing Hillary Clinton&quot;. I&#39;d like to point out that there is a federal investigation into the matter and, while it is ongoing, so far there have been no links uncovered to Hillary Clinton or her party. That the perpetrators don&#39;t like Donald Trump is not grounds for suggesting, quite dangerously, that Clinton&#39;s supporters are behind this; despising Donald Trump merely indicates higher brain function rather than outright political affiliation.<br><br>Look, however understandable I might personally find flinging a Molotov at a building connected to both a racist tangerine with some roadkill spaghetti on top AND a man who stole money from disaster relief programs to pay for a ridiculous transphobic &quot;bathroom bill&quot; (Pat McCrory, as any fule kno), this isn&#39;t the way forward. The Democrats have the presidential election in the bag, the Republicans are having to retool their entire strategy in order to get the GOP faithful to vote down-ticket (weeks before an election and <i>after</i> early voting has started), and so I consider it entirely unnecessary and completely stupid, regardless of the fact that nobody was hurt in the incident. All this does is fuel Trump&#39;s ramblings about a vast, unknowable conspiracy arrayed against him and Real America(TM) and play into his narratives surrounding the rigging of this election. This will make Trump-supporting &quot;poll-watchers&quot; (read: bloated, grubby little fascists) feel entirely justified in engaging in voter intimidation - and since this is American fascism we&#39;re talking about, the Trumpists are going to show up armed to the teeth.<br><br>This was a stupid, violent act and I hope that the people behind it are brought to justice. I also hope that this doesn&#39;t get in the way of people realizing that a Trump presidency is far more dangerous than any of the alternatives. Yes, including Gary Johnston and Jill Stein; they&#39;re both too stupid to be President, though for entirely different reasons (Jill thinks vaccines cause autism and Wi-Fi causes brain cancer, Gaz doesn&#39;t think... at all, as far as I&#39;ve been able to make out).</p>

            <p><b>Conclusions</b><br><br>&quot;EHS is characterized by a variety of non-specific symptoms that differ from individual to individual. The symptoms are certainly real and can vary widely in their severity. Whatever its cause, EHS can be a disabling problem for the affected individual. EHS has no clear diagnostic criteria and there is no scientific basis to link EHS symptoms to EMF exposure. Further, EHS is not a medical diagnosis, nor is it clear that it represents a single medical problem.&quot;<br><br>So there&#39;s no specific set of symptoms, no clear way to diagnose it, and no scientific evidence linking it to EM radiation... that sounds more like people attributing random afflictions to something obvious around them, to me. It&#39;s possible it&#39;s an actual effect, but - unless there&#39;s been more recent research - I&#39;m far from convinced.<br><br>(And either way, nerve/sensation-related effects don&#39;t have anything to do with cancer. ^_~)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I am happy to report that &quot;SafeMinds&quot;, the anti-vaccine activists, funded a study to prove their point. With them giving the money, the research was supposed to be free of any sort of manipulation and corruption...<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>It backfired at them spectacularly, as the research showed a link between autism and vaccines does not exist.</p>

            <p>... in accordance with their clear dedication to the weight of scientific evidence, they have now entirely reversed their message and are firmly (if not enthusiastically) stating that no, vaccines don&#39;t cause autism, and that there&#39;s no evidence they&#39;re bad and lots that they&#39;re good?<br><br>No? ... no?<br><br>(For my money, the best part of the story is that they&#39;re investigating what went wrong, because the <i>initial</i> reports they heard suggested there was a link.

            <p>I&#39;m working on a mission involving the <i>Bleach</i> continuum, and I&#39;ve found a bit character who&#39;s a (hilariously underpowered) Bount, which I&#39;m told is an artificial entity who feeds on the souls of humans, kinda like a Dementor. While this Bount is passable as a character, the Stu of the fic killed him quite graphically and left his body behind (Granz says the Bounts don&#39;t leave behind bodies). The thing is, a couple of people and I were debating whether to have him somehow assimilate into canon (by depowering him, as Bounts were originally human and seem to be quite rare), or have him recruited and put up for adoption (which means someone will have to try to get him to work as his character, complete with story arc).<br><br>I&#39;m honestly not sure how to handle this, and I could definitely use a second opinion. Both options present their own difficulties, though what&#39;s obvious is that he needs a trip to Medical first. So, um, which one is it gonna be, then?</p>

            <p>I think it would be fun to have him recruited and put up for adoption.  He seems like he&#39;d be a fun character to write, and I&#39;m sure someone from the Bleach fandom will come along and fall completely in love with him and give him a good home in HQ. :)</p>

            <p>I too am pro-recruitment, but several others have asked whether such a move is really necessary. His nature alone would probably present at a few issues. Like I said, he&#39;s a soul vampire, and the risk of absorbing too much glitter is always there. If written well, it could result in a neat story with a bit of an existential crisis, but that&#39;s a very big if.<br><br>Granz suggested the possibility of the guy actually wanting to become human, and now that I think of it I do see its potential (and oooh, what if it ends up working in tandem with the fear of the glitter OD?). I still maintain that&#39;s a bit of a stretch, though, seeing as there isn&#39;t any evidence AFAIK of a Bount becoming 100% human in canon.</p>

            <p>For me, reading though wiki archives is way less fun than the discussions onBoard. . . I don&#39;t know why, since they&#39;re pretty much the same content (I guess I&#39;m a social person? Or something; Social/Emotional Health is one of only two school subjects I&#39;ve ever flunked).

            <p>Overall, I thought it was a fantastic interlude. Elanor&#39;s interactions are adorable, and her parents are exactly what one would expect (I&#39;d like to see an AU with her dad as an agent, actually). Zeb being effectively the father figure, even if he is an uncle, is the only smart decision, as magic potions make really terrible paternal figures. <br><br>Quick notes I promised- <br><br>&quot;He cradled his granddaughter and a kiss on her cheek.&quot;<br><br>and <br><br>&quot;The Aviator took Elanor from her monther, and. . . got her under the Aviator&#39;s shirt.&quot;<br>- This is a bit redundant. <br><br>Those two bits aside, you have a lovely, hearts-warming interlude. <br><br>I expect great things from Elinorelisindrivar.

            <p>So this was all-around cute and heartwarming (so if that&#39;s what you wanted, mission accomplished).

            <p>I&#39;m not going to argue that that scene wasn&#39;t gross.   And personally, incest makes my skin crawl, and I can&#39;t comprehend why anyone would want to picture a sex scene between a pair of talking cartoon horses.  But it&#39;s also important to remember that <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/YKINMK">YKINMK</a>, and that going around making blanket statements about fetishes is kind of a bad idea. <br><br>I think the article linked above makes a really good point, which is that it&#39;s really important to judge something not based on how much you like or dislike a thing, especially a potentially-sexy thing, but on how good it is, objectively speaking.  Does it make sense with consideration to the setting and characters?  Is it well-written?  In this case, the answer is objectively no on both parts, and I doubt it would ever be true with regards to the former. But if you allow your gut reaction to a kink or a pairing dominate your response, especially as a sporker, you&#39;re not really approaching it fairly.  <br><br>Also, I don&#39;t really understand what&#39;s so bad about futa.  Leaving aside the issue of trans or intersex characters (because that&#39;s not relevant to this specific instance, or, to be honest, most instances, of futanari porn), it&#39;s not really that different from a strap-on, except with actual sensation involved on the wielder&#39;s end. I guess maybe I&#39;m kind of biased, because I actually do enjoy some futa-on-male doujins. Slash plus femdom? Yes, please! And frankly, even incestuous futa cartoon horses are fairly mild next to some of the things that can be found in Bleepfic.  </p>

            <p>If I offended you, I apologize. I shouldn&#39;t have talked about this on the Board. I also understand the necessity of an objective critic, reason I&#39;m not going near a badfic where I can&#39;t be objective.<br><br>Now, on futa, and that&#39;s a personal opinion, I find it involves a part of bad biology, especially if no explanations are provided, I&#39;m not sure about why do that when strap-on exist, and for the last point...

I can think of a few reasons. <br>1) As Tira mentioned earlier, so that both parties can feel what&#39;s happening. <br>2) As in the fic, so that one party can impregnate the other.

            <p>So when I was adding stuff on to the Wiki the other day I noticed that it has LaTeX (Pronounced Lay-Tek) compatibility. What this means is that using it I could go through the Wiki and make all the mathematics in it look nice (the biggest change this would bring would be the list of RC&#39;s where fractions and powers etc. would look correct).

            <p>However it&#39;s the fractions and powers etc. that are a bit more difficult. There&#39;s also a limit on what can and can&#39;t be put between the tags, which is why I haven&#39;t done RC Sp&#39;Nüff(24), it doesn&#39;t like the ü and I can&#39;t work out how to make it either a) accept it or b) change the rest of the RC number to make it look alright, without replacing the ü with a u which is something I&#39;d only do as a last resort. The only other thing I need to do is find out what symbol I can use to denote &#39;repeating&#39; when a decimal is repeating some numbers in itself as I can&#39;t find the symbol I normally use. </p>

            <p>On further inspection, elements with &quot;math&quot; tags are actually images with the class .tex and the alt text of whatever is set between the tags. This... is not something I can easily fix. I can change the height of elements with the class .tex, but that results in some of the fractions becoming too small to read, so it&#39;s not a good solution. Nor am I certain now that just anyone could set anything between &quot;math&quot; tags and expect a result. I might give it a try sometime, but not right now.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So first up general editing question, does anyone know the command to find out and/or change the size and font the wiki pages use? If not then the RC numbers are going to be a different size and font to everything else on the wiki. Which is also going to be a problem as I&#39;m not maths-ifying the two RC&#39;s in &quot;Not a Number/What Is This I Don&#39;t Even&quot; that are phrases rather than numbers.<br><br>@Mattman, do you want me to maths-ify 1337 in the description of RC637R3K7M8? I can if you want.<br><br>@Dawnfire, in the RC list Edgar and Agen____t are in RC 2.1459 (Pie) but on their character pages they are in RC Pie-2,1459, which is correct?<br><br>Also the RC number for Luana Starlight and Orange Plaid is 27 ½.5 does anyone know if this is intentional or if it is just meant to be 27.5?<br><br>Finally, please correct me if I am assuming wrong, but several RC&#39;s have essentially two numbers associated with them, the string of digits and then in brackets a more succinct way of putting those digits (for example Des and The Librarian are in RC 0.4342944819 (log e)) I am going to put in both ways of putting the number, but if you only want one or the other then let me know and I will do it.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br>Who is remembering why he switched from LaTex to Word when it comes to mathematical typesetting<br><br><br></p>

            <p>So that would basically just be me not being consistent about formatting, rather than something important. Basically: Edgar and Agen____t live in RC 2.1459, which is also called RC Pie <s>because this one time I misremembered pi and got that, whereupon I decided it should be pie. And then it became their RC.</s> No matter what, though, there should be a period, not a comma. Neither I nor they would use that notation. You can go with the first version, I guess?

I have also just read the top of the wiki article and realised it says &quot;You may not remove RCs or agents from this list unless they are yours.&quot; Which, I guess makes this whole thing invalid, so once again I apologise.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br><br>P.S sorry for some of the typo&#39;s in my post, my laptop&#39;s keyboard is slowly dying and I&#39;m not always picking up on the mistakes I am then making because of it. <br><br></p>

            <p>. . . one of the nuts-and-bolts bad slash pages.  At some point, people started adding either their own agents, or characters from canons they liked.  Because that is what fans do.  It&#39;s ultimately harmless; all the actual content of the page is right at the top, so no one is hindered from reading it by the list.  It interesting to see the breakdown, too: A lot more representation in anime/manga and web-based series than in the more mainstream media.<br><br>—doctorlit, possibly answering a rhetorical question</p>

            <p>Actually, two questions:<br><br>1/ Page-related, in the list you give specific descriptions by the agents&#39; names, but most (all?) of them don&#39;t appear in the text of the article theoretically describing the phenomenon. One even shows up as an acronym, which frankly sounds like a style of computer game to me. ;) I guess this isn&#39;t really a &#39;question&#39; so much as a point to be improved.<br><br>2/ Wait, there&#39;s actually three questions. #2 is: you&#39;re using &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; as words for gender, and say that it&#39;s incorrect to describe someone as &#39;male in a female body&#39;. What word structure <i>would</i> you suggest to describe the biological sex of someone&#39;s body, since it&#39;s... uh, actually quite significant in lots of contexts. (Take that as either &#39;would you personally suggest&#39; or &#39;what&#39;s the accepted standard&#39;, as appropriate.)<br><br>3/ I only discovered the third question late. ^<em>^ ... no, never mind, I followed a link and the third question went away.<br><br>Wait, I found another, and I&#39;m veering quite far off topic here.<br><br>4/ Agen</em>___t&#39;s article says that they &#39;refused to settle on a gender without knowing more about zirself and what genders even meant&#39;. So... what <i>does</i> gender even mean?<br><br>(I could add more to that question, but choose not to prejudge the potential answer/s.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>1) I went ahead and made a few changes. Hopefully this is a bit better.<br><br>2) Personally, I prefer AFAB (assigned female at birth) for myself and I know others do as well, but YMMV. <br><br>3) Never mind, then? :P<br><br>4) When I first came out as genderfluid, I got a heck of a lot of questions asking &quot;Well how do you know what gender you are?&quot; and &quot;What does X gender even feel like?&quot; To which I would have to say, how would you describe color to a blind person? How would you describe what your own gender feels like? My personality doesn&#39;t change with my gender; I don&#39;t suddenly love football when I&#39;m male, and I don&#39;t get the urge to wear makeup when I&#39;m female. It&#39;s just kind of a gut feeling to me, though sometimes it takes me a bit before I figure out which I am today. Until then, it&#39;s just this vague sense of discomfort—kind of like wearing clothes that are just a tiny bit too small. It&#39;s quite annoying to be called &quot;young lady&quot; when I&#39;d prefer &quot;young man&quot; or vice versa.<br><br>In all honesty, I&#39;m probably the <i>worst</i> person to ask this question because even I myself have no idea what gender is to me, other than a gut feeling. *shrugs* Wish I could be more helpful than ramble a lot.</p>

            <p>And I <i>wouldn&#39;t</i> describe what &#39;my gender&#39; feels like - it&#39;s not something I consider terribly important.<br><br>There&#39;s a moment in (UK, original) <i>Top Gear</i> where they discuss the downside of having a moustache, which is: how could you think of anything else? &quot;I&#39;m going to the shop, and I have a moustache... I&#39;m driving my car, and I have a moustache...&quot; But gender... isn&#39;t a moustache, to me (has anyone ever said that sentence before? ^_^).<br><br>So I guess my follow-up question is: if the English language had a fully-functioning genderless mode, such that &#39;young person&#39; was a way someone might address you, would you be annoyed by that in the same way you&#39;re annoyed by the gendered version? If gender is a partial moustache for you (ie, you&#39;re aware of it - whatever &#39;it&#39; may be), how would you feel about it being...<br><br>... uh...<br><br>... shaved?<br><br>I think my simile got away from me.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Disclaimer: This is just my rambling opinion of the moment. I don&#39;t intend to speak for anybody else.<br><br>I&#39;ve lately come to think that gender is basically, more or less, BS. It&#39;s almost entirely a social construct, and one that I personally have never really bought into. I mean... my body is female, I&#39;m happy being female, but all the trappings of &quot;traditional&quot; femininity mean little and less to me. People are just people. They should be able to like what they like and be good at what they&#39;re good at regardless of their Xs and/or Ys. IMO, the sooner we all stop caring how people with certain bodies choose to express themselves through superficial fashion choices and whatnot, the happier we&#39;ll all be.<br><br>Screw gender, it&#39;s a dumb idea that&#39;s caused a lot of people a lot of heartache. Let&#39;s ditch it. {= P<br><br>~Neshomeh reserves the right to be wrong and change her mind.</p>

            <p>... that&#39;s kind of where I am, too. And one possible answer to my question is &#39;people view men and women differently, and we should be allowed to choose which way we&#39;re viewed&#39;, which is perfectly valid, and the only one I can think of off the top of my head which I don&#39;t go &#39;uh what?&#39; at.<br><br>But I&#39;m also aware that other people can - on certain rare occasions - answer questions in ways I didn&#39;t expect.

Um, maybe you could be Sam instead, Scape?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... is that several of the articles claim the book will mostly consist of the &#39;original version&#39; of the story.<br><br>I... find that unlikely. The <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/The_Tale_of_Tin%C3%BAviel">Tale of Tinuviel</a> is very different from the story as presented in the Silmarillion - it takes place in a wildly different (simpler) Beleriand, and notably has Beren as a Noldo(!). And that&#39;s not even mentioning the giant cat which makes Beren its slave...<br><br>So while the idea of a Readers&#39; Version of the Book of Lost Tales is one I&#39;ve liked for a while, I think it far more likely we&#39;ll get the version found in the <i>Quenta Silmarillion</i> draft - ie, something slightly longer than the version that made its way into the published Silm.<br><br>What I would <i>like</i> - and find it unlikely I&#39;ll get - is a triple combination version which presents, in reverse order of writing, the Quenta version, the Lay of Leithian (combined from the rewrite and the original), and the Tale of Tinuviel, all in &#39;reader&#39; versions. Then the latter part of the book could be the analysis. That would be a gorgeous book... but it won&#39;t happen. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Seeing as how agents deal with canons being replaced or taken out of their continuum with putting them back I wonder. <br>How would the agents handle if an oc was stolen for a fanfic they were on a mission for?<br>  Would it be considered a replacement or could the oc have the uncanon influences removed and sent back to their own rps and fanfics? Could the agents even be able to tell if the oc was taken from someone else? How would the oc have gotten there? <br><br>I ask because as someone who is modding a DR Oc group someone aped an oc and had stolen the design of an down to even tracing the art for the oc and copying their talent. They didn&#39;t get into the group obviously but it makes me wonder about what would happen if something like that occurred in a fanfic. I&#39;ve seen rp groups who have had to kick people out for stealing ocs too. <br><br>Note that this would apply even to writers who don&#39;t know using others oc designs and art for their own oc isn&#39;t okay. </p>

            <p>I used someone else&#39;s fanmade Pokemon designs, with permission of course, but then I had to drop the fic later on because of college. In-universe, I returned all the fakemon species and the other person&#39;s characters to their original owner and region (partly due to the fact that he was starting to update their designs at the time, and still is), and then destroyed the fic and everything else in it.<br><br>For my taste, though, using or copying someone else&#39;s OC for use in RPs or fanfics is a very insulting gesture TBH.

            <p>Recruitment is understandable and certainly done with credit, and heck, I have an agent based on someone else&#39;s character (Rayner, based off Trotsworth&#39;s genderbent Rainbow Dash) AND have recruited someone else&#39;s OC at least once (though granted, I handed V.R. off to a fellow Boarder afterward). The difference, though, is that in all of these cases I openly cited where all these characters came from or were derived from. It&#39;s when someone uses someone else&#39;s character WITHOUT CREDITING THE ORIGINAL CREATOR that things get ugly. Replacements are of course exceptional due to being derived from a canon, but use of someone&#39;s fanmade OC without credit technically DOES qualify as plagiarism. You both are on the same tier, so to speak.<br><br>I am so sorry that I failed to clarify this from the beginning.

            <p>Namely, when a PPCer recruits a character, they don&#39;t remain the exact same character. The badfic version and the PPC version share certain superficial traits, but the whole point, IMO, is to take the kernel of an idea that was done badly and show how it could be done <i>well</i>.<br><br>Ilraen, for instance, is not the same Andalite who showed up for one line in a fanfic to give some OC morphing powers. He did that thing, but that other guy was just a one-dimensional bit character without so much as a name. Ilraen is, I devoutly hope, much more than that. You couldn&#39;t say at this point that they&#39;re the same character.<br><br>Same goes for Derik. He had a bit more to his badfic origin, but Derik is not the same guy as E&#39;rik, because he has an inner life with conflicts all his own. E&#39;rik... doesn&#39;t. He was just there to look impressive and play backup to the main Sue of the story. Derik remembers being Weyrleader to Alanna&#39;s Weyrwoman... but he remembers a lot more about having been a harper and a generic bronzerider, none of which was actually in the fic; and he also has these strange moments where the fact that he&#39;s a Phantom photocopy seems to go further than skin-deep, and they freak him out.<br><br>Even Gall, who&#39;s the most similar to her badfic counterpart, I wouldn&#39;t say is the same character. Luga is a generic schoolyard bully who bullies for the sake of bullying with no real rhyme or reason to it. Gall is a self-centered jerk who likes to throw her weight around (such as it is), but she&#39;s also perceptive, insightful, and intelligent; she respects power, loves her dragon, and wants to jump her partner&#39;s bones if he&#39;ll ever take a hint. Her best friend is Gremlin, and they like to bond over raucous girls&#39; nights and physical activities such as AHAIRQ and the PPC Hunger Games. They&#39;re different people.<br><br>At best, you could say these characters were inspired by their badfic counterparts. They share similar origins, but nothing more. And that, I think, is how you avoid plagiarism. Credit to the original not required.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Thanks for clarifying.<br><br>As to why you can&#39;t edit Board posts - if you desperately want that ability, you can post and ask the Board&#39;s opinion (it&#39;s an option that can be enabled for logged-in users, I think). But I will argue vehemently against it, on the grounds that a) we&#39;ve had enough bad apples around that letting them alter their posts is asking for &#39;no I never said that you bully&#39;, and b) acknowledging and discussing your mistakes is far more in the PPC spirit than just deleting them.

            <p>I&#39;m looking for betas for something that isn&#39;t related to the PPC. I chanced upon a decent <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> AU fic that is in dire need of a SPaG beta; I&#39;ve had a chat with the authors, and it seems that they had a bad case of vanishing betas. So I&#39;m looking for someone who&#39;s willing to beta for SPaG for those guys. Since this is a commitment, please only reply if you&#39;re reasonably certain you have the time. Any interested parties should give me an email address or something similar, so I can make the connection between them and the authors.</p>
