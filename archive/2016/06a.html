            <p>There&#39;s nothing like a good ol fashioned uncanonical Mecha free for all.<br><br>Recently DoSAT came into possession of a large army of unique Mecha, and were tasked with Hikari-Ni-Nare-ing them. Normally they would just strap explosives galore in every nook and cranny they could find, but then some guy asked if they couldn&#39;t just have Agents duke it out in a mechanical free for all. As the present engineers were all Mecha fans in some form the decision was unanimous.<br><br>Apparently adding a teleporter-based ejection system and some ToQger-brand IMAGINATION for controls cost less then the plastic explosives.<br><br>So basically they asked agents to fight with Mecha until that Mecha can&#39;t fight no more, then get into another Mecha and repeat the process until there&#39;s no more Mecha to use.<br><br>You can find this RP on the T-Board</p>

            <p>Why is DoSAT destroying incredibly useful technology?  Seriously.  They keep that sort of thing around and put it to good use.  Makes-things would fire everyone involved as soon as he found out about this.  And in this case, I think &quot;fire&quot; might imply &quot;from a cannon&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying that random RPs are a bad thing, of course.

            <p>...honestly? I think this entire discussion was more or less unnecessary, especially with your adamant defense of your idea and demeaning July&#39;s profession. Everything you&#39;ve been doing from the very first post of this thread has been all kinds of Not Cool, and speaking as your friend here, I think it would be better for you to just drop the subject in its entirety.<br><br>When we come up with ideas for RPs, or anything else for that matter, the first thing we do is discuss these ideas with our friends, before taking such proposals to the Board, let alone setting up anything &quot;official&quot; on either of the Boards. By getting feedback from others before trying anything, we can determine whether what we&#39;re about to do is a safe idea or not. Throwing up an RP thread opener on the T-Board and expecting other people to join without questioning what you&#39;re doing is not a good way to encourage actual participation, and while the T-Board is no doubt not nearly as active as the Board proper, such an action may still take up space that could be devoted to more productive RPs, discussions, etc.<br><br>And as for my two cents on your RP idea itself, I&#39;m sorry to say that I&#39;ll have to give it a pass. I mean, yeah, in a different setting I would be interested in mecha battles, and I really loved a certain mecha-versus-kaiju movie from a while back. But this is not the kind of setting that&#39;d allow such scenarios, because knowing how they go in movies and anime, they will inevitably result in valuable technology being wasted and potential collateral damage to everyone else within several miles of the fight. Besides, the potential spectacle would certainly be outweighed by the expenses of maintenance, repairs, and possible medical bills due to injured pilots. And even if this was non-canon I doubt there would be that many agents who would be interested in even piloting a mech, let alone pitting one against another in dangerous close combat. <s>Well, Falc would, but only as a last resort. Or something.</s><br><br>Please understand that knowing how I am with drama, I went out of my way not to sound vitriolic, demeaning, or otherwise petty while typing this, and I apologize if I come off that way to you all regardless. The last thing I need, however, is for me to get irrationally upset and start fueling the fire myself, so I&#39;ll end this off by once again advising for you to kindly stop pursuing this immature and pointless endeavor; I&#39;ve backed you up on things before, sure, but I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t do so in this case, seeing as I believe you are in the wrong on this one.</p>

            <p>There are several mechs that, if destroyed, could theoretically take down HQ with it; Godmars, the pioneer of ugly-awesome multi-colored combination mechs, destroys the planet if it gets wrecked, and the more famous Ideon wipes out the entire universe if it goes down or goes berzerk.<br><br>In addition, the PPC&#39;s point of view is to deconstruct things to analyze the overall quality of something. This has only ever been attempted once in mecha anime as a canon, and it was so emotionally taxing that everyone else thought &quot;let&#39;s not do that again.&quot; (Invincible Super Man Zambot 3. Look it up. Or maybe don&#39;t.)<br><br>And yes, this would destroy HQ even if the mechs I just mentioned weren&#39;t involved. Dai-Guard already showed people that you don&#39;t ... with salarymen or they&#39;ll rip you a new one. What could even stronger pilots do?</p>

            <p>... for a mission in Harry Potter and Labyrinth. Canon knowledge is appreciated but not a must. To put it bluntly, the fic is barely able to touch either canon with a twenty feet pole.<br>I&#39;m looking for input on SPaG (if you&#39;re good at commas I will love you forever) and the general flow/pacing. Since I&#39;ve taken forever to finish the mission and rewrote the ending completely, I suspect it might be kinda jerky here and there.<br>Clocks in at just under 4300 words, including quotes from the fic and I&#39;m on no kind of deadline.

            <p>“I messed up bad, huh?” Sergio said to no one in particular while inspecting the damage on his Sprinter Trueno. The former agent was in his garage, and it goes without saying that the last drift competition he took part in didn’t go well.<br><br>Sergio looked at the intercooler and sighed - installing it on the bumper hadn’t been a great idea, as both parts were going straight into the trash bin. He was about to start taking out the damaged part when he heard Nikki calling him. “What is it?”<br><br>“Corolla just called me. She says she needs to speak to both of us - something big is going on, I’m afraid.” Nikki said, poking her head in.<br><br>Sergio instinctively brought his right hand over his holster at “big”, prompting a laugh from Nikki. “Don’t worry, it’s isn’t an emergency. Besides, that’s an electric screwdriver.”<br><br>Sergio stared at the device he was holding like it was a gun. “Oh.”<br><br>***<br><br>“So, what is it all about?” Sergio asked as soon as he and Nikki walked out of the portal. In front of them, Corolla waved from her extremely messy worktable.<br><br>“Well, the Flowers asked me if I could get you on standby, we might need some help in the future. Look at this.” Corolla said before tossing them the July 2016 issue of Nakayoshi. Nikki catched it and started skimming through.<br><br>“Corolla, we’re retired. Just look at our clothes.” Sergio said, pointing at his racing suit and Nikki’s apron, both emblazoned with her café’s logo.<br><br>“Bwah...?” Nikki said, before poking her boyfriend’s shoulder and showing him the first page of one of the mangas featured.<br><br>“Hm...? Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card Chapter? Is this for real?”<br><br>Corolla nodded. “Yup. CLAMP came up with a full-fledged sequel for CCS’ twentieth anniversary. The Flowers are kinda worried about it, though - they fear a badfic explosion, but apparently there are very few Agents left who are knowledgeable in it.”<br><br>“And that’s where we come in, I guess?” Sergio wondered. “Still, I’m not sure. I mean, CCS hits me and Nikki close to home, but...”<br><br>“I knew you would say something like that, so I spoke with the Marquis and he said he’s fine with the two of you working as contractors. You decide whether to accept or not each mission, and you can stop taking them on whenever you want.”<br><br>Sergio hmphed. “The stupid daisy must be really desperate if he’s giving us such good conditions. What do you think, Nikki?”<br>Nikki shook her head. “You said it, Cardcaptor Sakura is like home for us. Let’s do it.”<br><br><br><br>[Yes, CCS:CC&#39;s first chapter came out today. Scanlations were out less than 24 hours from release - the hype is real. At this point the fanfic explosion is all but confirmed.]</p>

            <p>Hey everyone! I&#39;ve been stalking around here for a while, and I figured it&#39;s time I introduced myself. Where to start... How about backstory?<br><br>I was popping through TV tropes, trying to avoid a crashing my computer by opening a hundred tabs at once, and I randomly found myself on this place&#39;s page. I figured it looked pretty interesting, so I decided to check it out. I read the Original Series, and found it rather cool, so I read the Constitution, then started looking for interesting agents. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve run out yet. I checked to see if this place was active, and happily, it is. This potentially insane organization also seems to be a pretty awesome place, so I decided to hop in. That&#39;s about it, really, so I&#39;ll just stop here and eagerly await what happens next!</p>

            <p>Nicknames are useful when, like myself, you have a long name or pseudonym. They&#39;ll probably shorten it to Granz, but other things are possible. I just hope that they don&#39;t call me Ice King, because then I&#39;ll be stealing it from Weiss. (Hey!) Moderately overused jokes aside, yeah, Granz is the most likely option, especially since I don&#39;t even bother to write the whole thing out, I just type in G and let the computer fill in the rest for me. If you feel like referring to me in the third person, please use masculine pronouns. </p>

Slytherin sometimes pops up in my actions, but being so devoted to getting something that, even when Slytherin is in proper, the methods used are questionable hovers too close to the Dark Side for my tastes. Ravenclaw&#39;s the place for me, because I am pretty adept in academic fields, and I think that knowledge is power. I&#39;d think it even more if I were actually in Harry Potter, especially since knowledge can literally give you more physical power, if I am correct in my theories.</p>

            <p>Seriously, Fire Emblem is maddening. I got my first and only Fire Emblem game, Shadow Dragon, when I was pretty young. I got so upset when someone died, but then, somehow, I got it into my head that something special happens at Level 4. While something does happen there, it&#39;s no what I thought, for I figured that something special meant that all my troops came back. I&#39;m pretty sure that I actually cried when I figured out that my troops stayed dead. I then restarted the game. Every time I have tried to finish it since... I fail, because it takes forever to get through one level. Possibly hours, even with the save points. <br><br>Ghost might do really well this time, considering the typing of the E4 in Unova. I&#39;ll see who ends up on my party. Hoping that the Dreamyard catch isn&#39;t a Patrat. They&#39;re very lovely, yes. I don&#39;t need three. I&#39;ve already missed my chance to get a Lillipup for a while, and if I don&#39;t get a Munna (preferably) or a Purrloin (less preferable than Munna, but still something different) I shall scream. <br><br>And I see you like Ghost. You didn&#39;t do too bad in the tournament. I bet everyone with a Fairy type was fervently thanking the creators of Pokemon when they went up against your Mega Sableye. I&#39;d check myself, but my computer hates me right now.<br><br>As for that last part, while I haven&#39;t personally experienced it, I&#39;ve read enough about terrorist Gravelers to believe that that is very true. Hopefully, I don&#39;t learn about it firsthand. <br><br>TL;DR: Very true, but also leads to insanity, Ghost is a maybe because I might end up challenging the E4 with a Patrat army, I see you like Ghosts, everyone else was probably glad Fairy was invented, and hopefully I don&#39;t learn firsthand about the second reason. *exhales* <br><br>Note to self: No text walls.

            <p>I read that Jagen&#39;s stats, if taken to level 20 and compared to a Cavalier turned Paladin, don&#39;t measure up, so he&#39;s recommended, but it still sucks. <br><br>Oh, the arenas. Fun fun. Grind to any level you want, but be careful, because at any second your unit can die, and you have to start all over again. I love the shops, I really do. They let me supply my ridiculously over-leveled Clerics and Priests with staves to heal my warriors after they get stabbed again, and again, and again.<br><br>Bleh. I haven&#39;t tried any mod, which is, in cheat games, something like infinite health, I believe, and I wouldn&#39;t know anything that wouldn&#39;t make the game too easy, or even how to get one. I seriously have not beaten Shadow Dragon, even though I get closer every time, because I give up because of so many restarts, and before I do any kind of mod or get another game, I&#39;d like to at least beat the one I have.<br><br>I was more thinking about facing a Mega that has no vulnerabilities. Yeesh... That would not be fun. Typing isn&#39;t everything, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not important.<br><br>The no repeat Pokemon one is actually a change that some people use, and others don&#39;t. I thought it would make it harder if didn&#39;t use that in exchange for being able to use healing items like potions and berries. Previously, I hadn&#39;t been using them. <br><br>Okay, good. I get a little long winded sometimes, at least in comparison to almost everyone I know, and that carries over to texts and posts. Sometimes, I think it gets worse because nobody can interrupt and state that it&#39;s been an hour, and they&#39;d really like to eat instead of hearing about exactly what one would do to create a Philosopher&#39;s Stone in Harry Potter.</p>

            <p>In fact, check the wiki of the series. You&#39;ll see several archetypes like this. For example, Camus started one for &#39;honorable enemy you have to kill. And you&#39;ll hate this&#39;.<br><br>Now, that&#39;s pretty simple, and I&#39;m far from being an expert. Go to Serenes Forest, Holy Land of FE players on the web, to find said mods. For the emulators, search for Visualboy Advance, then roms for the GBA Fire Emblem games. And you can even try Binding Blade, Serenes Forest also hosts a translation patch for it.<br><br>They are Richard Legard and Marina Nicodelli.

            <p>Do I even want to know? Or will it make a Nuzlocke without the repeat and shiny Pokemon clauses and which forbids the player from using any healing items at all or any Pokemon Centers more than once look like a walk in a nice, sunny park?<br><br>I looked up the emulators. Apparently the ROMs are illegal. Dang...<br><br>I&#39;ll probably survive.

I mean, I thought you were a student who is from France, if I&#39;m interpreting it correctly. Alas, I do not speak any languages other than English at the moment, so I am reduced to using Google Translate, knowing that it is, to put it lightly, imperfect. When I read Richard&#39;s bio, and then I read your stories, I figured that you had to at least speak French as a secondary language, if not as your primary language. I just wanted to ask, because to assume is to make a donkey out of you and me, and I like being bipedal and actually having arms, especially since this isn&#39;t MLP, and hooves are not nearly as good for manipulating objects as that show makes them look. And don&#39;t sweat the grammar errors. Apparently, the rules of the English Language are incredibly ridiculous and inconsistent compared to other languages. I&#39;m just beginning the process of learning another language, and... Yeah, I really have no idea what the people who invented this language were thinking.<br><br>It was gremlins. Or maybe the inhabitants of Croak needed a &quot;You cannot say that b&quot; for some reason. They have stolen many, many socks from me. I think.</p>

            <p>Unlike Crasher Wake, however, my other two are actually quite wholesome. (And to anybody who gets the Nuzlocke I&#39;m referencing, I truly am NOT trying to trivialize the other two that are mentioned there, but it&#39;s pretty hard to make it not come out like a joke, considering what I&#39;m referencing.) <br><br>If it&#39;s that horrible, I&#39;ll just shove it in with every single horror game, movie, TV show, book, etc., and not get it.<br><br>Okay, if that&#39;s legal, then I&#39;m good to go. I own Shadow Dragon, and I probably couldn&#39;t get some of the others if I sold an arm and a leg, and the consoles? Forget it. Of course, if the arm was the canonically removed appendage of a protagonist of certain series, then I might just need that and nothing else.<br><br>Well, I don&#39;t have a lot of experience with Literal Genies - blame the fact that I don&#39;t know anybody who plays D&amp;D for that- but the ones I do know are either A) downright malicious, and purposely twist it in the worst possible way, or B) have no idea what they&#39;re doing, and are occasionally more dangerous because of it. And, if she could actually feel, I&#39;m sure that the Blue Djinn of Babylon would be very, very sorry about that, skunk baby.<br><br>I am not familiar with MLP. I only know a little bit about it from a few CDs that I haven&#39;t watched since before I was in middle school. I might check out the newer series, and see what it&#39;s like, but I couldn&#39;t pass judgement on it as is. And, just because I figure I ought to be helpful, I believe the word you&#39;re looking for is suggest. It&#39;s almost, if not completely, a connotation versus denotation thing, and probably just as confusing as ser and estar, but to me, at least, advise has a more... formal connotation, whereas the casualness implied by your language would probably fit with suggest. Also, it&#39;s just this wacky thing we pull because English is evil, and in this case, it would probably be something like, &quot;Would you advise that someone should watch it?&quot; (I really am not trying to be rude here, I just want to be helpful. If it&#39;s offensive, tell me and I&#39;ll quit it.)<br><br>I don&#39;t know about the accents. At least I can actually understand how accents work in the language I&#39;m learning, which is Spanish, but I still can&#39;t keep track of when to use whom. <br><br>Dang, she can do that just by being mentioned? I think I&#39;ll just go grab my copy of <i>The Gates of Sleep</i> so that I can whack my computer with it just in case.</p>

            <p>I tried to read the originals, but I actually only found them after I&#39;d read others, and found them far too short, because I was used to it taking an entire page to get past the first capture. I have read Ky-Nim&#39;s, and I may or may not have gotten a few of my ideas from her world-building. I&#39;ve also read the ones by Kitfox, and that&#39;s where I got the Crasher Wake joke. In order, his are Sapphire, Platinum, Black 2, and an ongoing Soul Silver. I also read Pitch Black, which you probably don&#39;t want to read unless you like your protagonists as complete sociopaths -I say socio because he has little to no impulse control, and I&#39;m pretty sure those ones are the sociopaths, but I&#39;m not sure-, but stopped when the author just gave up and started doing just long strips of plot and finished the game up in about five pages when they were only at Castelia City before. Of course, these aren&#39;t the only ones I&#39;ve read, but I&#39;d have to look it up to be sure.<br><br>That does make a lot of sense. I guess I&#39;ve been unintentionally breaking that rule. Most of my anime knowledge comes from the internet, and I have no idea where I&#39;d put all the DVDs I&#39;d need. ... I&#39;d put them in Carmela&#39;s closet, that&#39;s where!<br><br>Oh, dear. It should at least make for some interesting reading. And maybe some book-substitute throwing, because I don&#39;t want to mess up the pages.<br><br>It&#39;s just a small thing. Really, you&#39;re better than some of the people who I actually know who&#39;ve been speaking it all their lives, and you don&#39;t feel the need to use expletives as adjectives for every single word! Until I read your missions and agent bios, I had no idea that you didn&#39;t speak English as your first language, and that was mostly because of Richard&#39;s bio.<br><br>Of course. The Ironic Overpower attempts to bend the rules concerning his powers by using fictional characters to affect real life, perhaps?</p>

            <p>I would absolutely recommend it in a heartbeat! It took lots of bribes of <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> games, but I managed to get my brother to watch the first five episodes before he decided it was good. :P It might take some time to start liking it, not gonna lie... what happened with me was, I started watching it out of boredom to see what all the fuss was about, nearly quit at the theme song, then decided to sit through the first episode after Twilight used the word &quot;precipice&quot; without sounding condescending towards the younger audience members. And then the cliffhanger with Nightmare Moon happened, and I decided &quot;fine, just one more episode, but <i>only</i> to see what happens next and that&#39;s it!&quot;<br><br>Yeah, by the third episode, I was singing along with the theme song. :P<br><br>Tl;dr it&#39;s a good show if you give it the chance, but it isn&#39;t for everyone.</p>

            <p>It apparently reads like a trollfic, unlike the other two, which apparently actually sound serious. I wouldn&#39;t know, I haven&#39;t read them in any medium other than parody for the sake of my already-strained sanity. On the other hand, it apparently reads like a trollfic, with Harry, <font color="white"> due to terrible spelling, developing a womb and then ripping it out of himself, probably with his bare hands, to use like a wand.</font> <br><br>... That is a disgusting image that you should probably not read unless you have a supply of Bleeprin on hand.

I mean, the Flowers haven&#39;t yet mastered human psychology yet, but I&#39;m pretty sure they don&#39;t deliberately try to drive their agents insane.

            <p>He got arrested for trying to take the throne from himself? Isn&#39;t that kind of like asking yourself if you can have the candy bar that you paid for, telling yourself no, then taking it anyways, and getting arrested for it? The only way that really makes sense is if you have multiple personalities living within you and each legally qualifies as a person, and so one could, theoretically, do something without the other&#39;s permission. Of course, then there&#39;s the problem of figuring out how to punish the personality that broke the law without punishing the one that was harmed by the violation.</p>

Its effect is a boost the damage of STAB moves by 2x when you reach 50% health, but the catch is you can only use it once. Swinub&#39;s not got much in the way of HP or Speed, but it does have one asset: priority. Try an Adamant one EV trained in Attack and HP, with Ice Shard, Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Curse if you think you can get a boost off or Superpower for the coverage.

            <p>Nume was partnered with Ilraen from the beginning of their spin-off, but the reason he didn&#39;t start off partnered with Cameo, as he was in my Fill the Plotholes, is because I discovered, in writing her, that she was a total psycho, aggressively manipulative and not very nice. She would not have made a good agent at all. So, when Twiggy mentioned that she was PPCing an <i>Animorphs</i> fic and needed a good home for an Andalite recruit, I jumped at the chance, and thus we have Ilraen. {= )<br><br>As for Derik, Earwig didn&#39;t work out as his partner because he was never really my character—Phobos came up with him—and I couldn&#39;t quite get a grip on how to write him. Plus, as much as I intended my DMS spin-off to be lighter in tone, Derik insisted on being a serious, down-to-earth person, so pairing him with a happy-go-lucky, zany kender made striking a balance a real struggle.<br><br>So, I decided to recruit Gall to replace Earwig. She has excellent qualities to play off Derik&#39;s: she&#39;s younger and more reckless, and can test his authority; there are plenty of anachronisms in her home canon, so I can make modern-Earth jokes I didn&#39;t have access to before; she and her dragon very much aggravate his trauma, so he&#39;s forced to deal with it; but she doesn&#39;t really care for his angst, and won&#39;t indulge him in it very much, so she helps keep the tone in balance. And she&#39;s a girl. My action teams were all boys before, and I like writing boys, but it&#39;s nice to have a girl.<br><br>As I&#39;ve written her, too, I&#39;ve discovered that her relative illiteracy gives her a more direct approach to missions, and she&#39;s more likely to notice visual or auditory weirdness around her. She was the first to catch on to the plagiarism in &quot;With One Step,&quot; for instance, just by listening to the dialogue. She remembers what she sees and hears. It&#39;s fun to look at things her way, and she makes me pay more attention to interpreting and describing the effects of the Words.<br><br>Oh, and to answer your last question, writing Earwig out was just a matter of him being a kender: they tend to get distracted and wander off, and that&#39;s what happened. Phobos and I intended to bring him back, but we haven&#39;t found an opportunity yet. He&#39;s still out there, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh, kind of proud that three of her four agents are badfic recruits, saved with a purpose and not just cuz.</p>

            <p>Specifically, boredom with Sarah working as a trainee with Falchion and Rashida. I know Sarah and Falc aren&#39;t identical in terms of personality but they share similar interests and contrast enough with Rashida that the grumpy kitty can&#39;t possibly care less about their differences. Falc and Rashida could work well together, but I realized that Sarah and Rashida probably couldn&#39;t because, surprisingly, they have somewhat similar temper issues. Two women who get angry easily probably wouldn&#39;t make as interesting a story as an angry woman and a fast-talking knife bird. So I took the temper clash to its logical conclusion and had Sarah and Rashida have a falling out, before sending the former to the DIC which was my plan for her in the first place.<br><br>As for Sarah&#39;s current partners, while recruiting Cupid was largely a matter of salvaging the origin story described in his homefic and applying it to a Pit clone (which I&#39;d been planning sometime prior to his creation), I&#39;d had the idea to have Sarah ultimately pair up with a Pit clone because when my own original writing project was still a mega-crossover, Sarah would meet and befriend Pit himself. That subplot was out the window once I transitioned the project into an original work, but Sarah being partners with Cupid is a remnant of that old idea.<br><br>This of course left me with a problem: Sarah and Cupid have a little more contrast than Sarah and Falchion, but they still share enough personality traits that I had to bring in someone else to balance them out. The answer came to me when I reread my old Pokemon fic and found Lapis, whom I noticed was quite neurotic even as a Sue. So she ultimately became the panicky but somewhat more sensible foil to the other two, which also gave me a good way to practice writing her in general.<br><br>Tl;dr, Sarah got sent to the DIC, not because she has anger issues, but because she and Rashida BOTH have anger issues. XD</p>

            <p>As far as I remember, around November 2013 I figured that I had no idea what to do with Anebrin (Des&#39; former partner). I had massive problems writing him in a way that wasn&#39;t Elf!Des; looking back, he definitely didn&#39;t have much substance to him as a character. So I decided to write him out, and since Drama was fun back then, I had him go insane. Wanting to bring in a Time Lord self-ish insert might have figured into the decision as well, though Lump as he is now is both very different from me and very different from his <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pxw0GD2tF46IKnJAFOuRmzh3G0s2fcX0ZuwgSQNMD5s/edit">original incarnation</a>.<br><br>I hope this helps.</p>

            <p>I already detailed my answer to you in an email, but for the sake of discussion I&#39;ll say again here.<br><br>Randa wasn&#39;t actually written by me, but by one of my high school friends. I brought in Zeb when Randa&#39;s author and I stopped being able to hang out like we used to, thanks to class and eventual graduation. The last few missions involving Randa were actually her handing the character over to me, but since I didn&#39;t want to write a self-insert of my friend, I started thinking about who would eventually replace her, and thus Zeb was born.<br><br></p>

            <p>I finally got around to replacing the old BG with one that will actually display all the flash patches whole.

            <p>The Bayformer series has been of... varying quality (Most of it was bad, Barricade in 1 and apparently now 5 is great, as were the Dinobots in 4) but if they actually get ROM involved I will gladly spend money to see this in a theater. Honestly ROM is probably the perfect robot franchise for Michael Bay.</p>

            <p>Another Hasboro property that, due to rumors of them wanting to cross over the two properties, is speculated to be th &quot;Last Knight&quot; that the title of TF5 refers to. He&#39;s basically a ten to sixteen-foot tall robot from space who shoots lasers at bad guys and his personality depends entirely on who is writing him at the time. His first non-toy appearance was in Marvel Comics, back when they had the licences to basically everything. He met the X-men and the Avengers, fought Godzilla, and may have even met Doctor Who. I am not 100% certain of that last one. I know there was a lot of cross over back when Marvel UK was publishing the Doctor&#39;s comics. The Doctor even had a few run-ins with the Transformers, and Godzilla as well. Oddly ROM and the Transformers never crossed over in those days to my knowledge, but it may be because I don&#39;t think Simon Furman, the Transformers writer at the time, liked ROM very much.<br><br>Also there have been several excellent Transformers smut authors over the decades, pretty much ever since the first cartoon was on air, but that&#39;s a topic for another time.</p>

            <p>Silly me, more money is far more important for Mister Bay. Especially when he only needs plots like &#39;We fear Transformers because of Megatron. So let&#39;s create an army of Transformers based upon Megatron. It Cannot Go Wrong.&#39;, with explosions everywhere. Oh, and Optimus Prime violating the very core of his character.<br><br>It could be worst i guess. Hasbro could have gave him MLP. Imagine what he could have done to this franchise.</p>

            <p>Dunno if you&#39;ve been keeping up with the comics at all, but Current state of affairs is thus: Megatron is an Autobot, Starscream is ruler of Cybertron, and Optimus (who went back to calling himself Orion Pax but may be Optimus once more) is currently kind of a dictator over Earth? It&#39;s a long series of events but I assure you it makes sense. Point being, Optimus hasn&#39;t been robojesus since the 90s or so, unless you wanna count the current RID cartoon, and even there he&#39;s more like a force ghost.</p>

            <p><u>What&#39;s in a Name?</u><br><br>Agent Neshomeh was busily typing away at her computer in the Archives when a knock came at her office door. She jumped, startled, and took a moment to take a deep breath, save her work, and adjust her glasses before getting up to answer it.<br><br>&quot;Yes?&quot;<br><br>The agent on the other side of the door wasn&#39;t much taller than she was, if at all, but had a commanding presence in his stiff black uniform. He had dark brown hair, green eyes, and no visible flash patch. &quot;Agent Hazelhead, Internal Affairs,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;d like to ask you a few questions.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okaaay.&quot; Neshomeh raised an eyebrow. She wasn&#39;t very good at it, but she did her best. She did not move from the doorway.<br><br>If Hazelhead was bothered, he didn&#39;t show it except to clear his throat and adopt a more comfortable stance. &quot;Can you please tell me your whereabouts yesterday between seven a.m. and three p.m., HST?&quot;<br><br>Neshomeh blinked. &quot;Um. Here? Where I always am? Though I was asleep for part of that. Maybe most of that.&quot; She was not habitually a morning person, and the lack of sunlight didn&#39;t help.<br><br>Hazelhead nodded. &quot;Can anyone confirm that?&quot;<br><br>She looked around conspicuously. The Archives were empty, like they always were. Even her mini-Budong, Chrichton, and the tiny &quot;Austrailien&quot; Aeryn Sun were nowhere in sight. &quot;Mm, no.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I see.&quot; The officer frowned. &quot;Have you ever been to the <i>X-Men</i> universe? Displayed any fire-based powers? Lusted after John Allerdyce, alias Pyro?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Definitely not.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Have you ever used the pen name &#39;LilQTAnglGrl&#39;?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hell no!&quot; Neshomeh crossed her arms. &quot;What the heck is this about?&quot;<br><br>Hazelhead wordlessly opened a folder handed her a single printed piece of paper.<br><br>She only had to glance at the title to understand. Her eyes went wide. &quot;What the—? Hold on! I don&#39;t even go by that name here!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I already talked to Agent Laison—as a known former Sue, she was our first concern, of course, despite the different spelling. Agent Gilmor is inactive, and the only other we know of doesn&#39;t technically exist yet.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And those aren&#39;t my initials anymore, <i>and</i> they&#39;re in the wrong order, anyway,&quot; Neshomeh went on, ignoring him in favor reading the very short fic in her hand. &quot;This is really stupid.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, we thought so, too.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And probably a troll. It&#39;s got all the hallmarks. Why&#39;d they have to use <i>my</i> name?&quot;<br><br>Hazelhead shrugged. &quot;Who can say?&quot; He took the fic back from her and put it away. &quot;Well, I believe you weren&#39;t involved, but we had to check. I&#39;ll be going now. Have a good day.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, sure. You, too.&quot; She shut the door and stood quietly a moment, thinking. &quot;Now, where did I leave that remote activator...?&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>So, I watch MasakoX&#39;s <i>Bad Fanfiction Theatre</i> sometimes. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoINvKJxdLg&amp;list=PLNSgpJTAeqwkII7neFuJJ8JWAbYSeP6Eb&amp;index=36">This episode</a>, which is a reading of <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1437907/1/Eleanor">this trollfic</a>, is responsible for inspiring this post.<br><br>This story is probably not canon. I borrowed hS&#39;s Agent Hazelhead without permission, for one thing, and the trollfic was published in 2003, for another. I hope it&#39;s amusing, though. {= ) Shockingly, it&#39;s actually longer than the trollfic by a few dozen words.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>That&#39;s fantastic. That&#39;s the sort of ridiculous thing that ought to happen in HQ.<br><br>I have no problem with you using Hazelhead (I&#39;ve always treated the older DIA agents as semi-free-to-use), and the idea that it took them 13 years to notice amuses me immensely. (Also, Agent Elanor namedrop woo hoo!)<br><br>So... if the four El(e)anors in HQ are all named in the Wiki, what does this tell us about the size of the PPC? What percentage of a group do you have to sample to find everyone of a single name? And does it matter that, assuming the PPC&#39;s name-distribution is the same as America&#39;s, 0.076% of the US population is named Eleanor or Elanor?<br><br>(In the latter case, extrapolating gives us a HQ size of around 5000; that fits with my previous discussion of the topic from a fic-load POV, though I can&#39;t find the post in question.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I tried to work in Neshomeh pointing out that the thing was from 2003, but it would&#39;ve rather invalidated the question of &quot;where where you yesterday during US school hours?&quot;, which I didn&#39;t want to <s>think hard enough to</s> change, and I couldn&#39;t think of where to take the dialogue from there.<br><br>I reckon HQ has a higher than average concentration of Elanors due to the influence of Tolkien. Whatever the demographics, the culture is certainly nerdier than the average population of any other World One society. Geek culture might be <i>more</i> mainstream these days, but in HQ, it <i>is</i> the mainstream.<br><br>(There are more kids named Eleanor these days than when I was in school, though. Seems the older names have come back around again.)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Certainly not in terms of name distribution. What percentage of America is named Chakkik? Doktor Trollenfisch? Zeb? Supernumerary? <i>Suicide</i>?<br><br>The demographics are just different. As just one example, I think we can safely say that America&#39;s elf population is nonexistent, or at least negligible. The PPC&#39;s is not, meaning that the culture of the PPC is subject to influence from elf cultures and ideas which America is untouched by. This is just one reason why American statistics are pretty useless to apply to the PPC.<br><br>I think the only thing we can say definitively about the size of the PPC is that there are far fewer agents than there are badfics. 5,000 agents would leave the PPC barely understaffed if they only sporked fic from the Harry Potter continuum found on the Pit (assuming 3/4 of the fic listed are goodfic). Given the reality of the PPC&#39;s mission, that&#39;s an excellent number if you want to picture the PPC as a small, desperate army waging an impossible war -- which <i>is</i> kind of the image I get, so maybe your number is right.<br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>What percentage of HQ is non-American? We can figure that out - we have a large enough sample size on the Wiki to tell us.<br><br>The maths says that the American segment should be ~5000 people. If half of all agents are Filthy Yankees, then HQ scales to 10000.<br><br>Or so goes our second approximation. The <i>third</i> approximation points out that Elanor Laison is French anyway, so shouldn&#39;t be counted in the Americans; that means there&#39;s around <b>4</b>000 Americans in there. If that&#39;s around half (this is a guess), then HQ is 8000...<br><br>Basically, there&#39;s between 3K and 10K agents. That&#39;ll do for an order-of-magnitude estimate. There aren&#39;t 500, there aren&#39;t 100,000. &quot;small, desperate army waging an impossible war&quot; it is.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Some of you may recall that a while and a half ago, two of our agents fell in love, and we&#39;ve been discussing how to handle that little subplot on and off over the past few months. In the end, we decided to make it official, and despite the usual Real Life scheduling problems on both ends, we eventually managed to set up Cupid and Stephanie&#39;s first date!<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E5RF3E-itH_-Zt4DBV-tKClW-KtlFkg0CqO3d5I8kN0/edit?usp=sharing">And promptly decided to ruin it.</a><br><br>Don&#39;t worry, though - we <i>also</i> decided to make a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GOqrZQTmcCnhUPhVX7tLmMDlVyjPg94UBM9Pq-YfBTQ/edit?usp=sharing">Twenty Years Hence</a> story to cap off their little love story.  We&#39;ll likely be doing more with them in the future but we hope you enjoy these works regardless!<br><br>Also, SkarmorySilver would like to apologize in advance to EileenAlphabet for not listing them as a beta. We already had two betas review the TYH and helped us correct pretty much everything that needed to be fixed up, and Eileen also vanished from the Internet again before they could contribute. We hope they&#39;re okay with this development, though we&#39;d recommend that they let us know in advance if they can&#39;t be able to beta next time. ^^;</p>

            <p>Lapis changing her name IS going to be a thing, but the plan I originally had for her that led to her doing so is NOT. She was originally going to have her species changed into a <i>Steven Universe</i> gem, a plan which I&#39;d discussed on and off with several other Boarders. It was one of the betas for this TYH who finally convinced me to drop that idea, since that would essentially be a total failure to address her nature as a character and would thus render her development basically null and void. Besides, looking back at that idea it always sounded like a ripoff of the Aviator anyways, and if there&#39;s one thing I do NOT want to do, it&#39;s unknowingly plagiarize Iximaz&#39;s work. ^^;<br><br>Lapis&#39; gemsona will still be making an appearance, though - as her disguise in my next planned mission, the badfic of which actually takes place in the SU continuum. And I imagine she&#39;d change her surname to &quot;Armenus&quot; simply to avoid confusion with the canon Lapis Lazuli.</p>

            <p>Stephanie herself explains this in the mission; the only reason she&#39;s in DMS is because she&#39;s tremendously strong. I&#39;m personally one of those people who thinks that the Flowers are so lawful neutral that they&#39;re supremely callous, and don&#39;t really give a damn about the agents.<br><br>And, well, you did see her just freaking toss Kurama-chan, right? Even nice people can snap.</p>

            <p>(Firstly, to avoid confusion, I checked my mail first and replied to your message there, before going to the Board and reading this post.)<br><br>Look, I&#39;m perfectly fine with you going ahead and posting the mission if you feel that it has gotten all the betaing it needs.<br><br>I&#39;m not fine with the way you described my role or lack of such. I got the link on Wednesday and now it&#39;s early Friday (where I am anyway). You didn&#39;t say, not when you asked for a beta nor when you sent me the link, that you were planning to post the interlude less than two days after, so I assumed I could look it over Friday evening or in the weekend.<br><br>I had a vet emergency and haven&#39;t really checked my mail for a couple of days, but that&#39;s obviously not something I knew in advance and anyway, I don&#39;t think that counts as disappearing from the internet.<br><br>So yeah, I don&#39;t want to be a b**** about this, but I feel like I&#39;m being accused of ghosting you, because I missed a very short deadline you hadn&#39;t even told me about.</p>

            <p>It was my mistake not to mention the deadline straight away, and to think that you&#39;d vanished as well. I also apologize for openly excluding you under the logic I had yesterday, given this mentality. It is not a mistake I&#39;ll repeat again. </p>
