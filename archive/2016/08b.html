            <p><i>The memory of what had happened to her closest friend, and the only one she’d had for years, still haunted her to this day — and it felt like a bit of relief to share her feelings to <b>his</b> partner’s new partner.</i> <br>Who is he? If you are still talking about Lapis, it should be &quot;her partner’s new partner&quot;.<br><br><i>Anju, <b>having had it enough as it</b> after trying to stay out of it, spoke up at that point.</i> <br>Do you mean &quot;having had enough of it&quot;? Continuing with &quot;after trying to stay out of it&quot; sounds still a bit clumsy. You may want to replace either &quot;enough of it&quot; by &quot;enough of this&quot; or &quot;out of it&quot; by something more specific like &quot;out of the discussion&quot; or &quot;quarrel&quot; or whatever &quot;it&quot; is.<br><br><i>&quot;But t-that is … so horrible,&quot; Anju replied with a tearful expression, then turning to Aiko, determinedly said, &quot;Aiko, don’t you think it is time to end this terrible feud of yours? You have <b>alway</b> been jealous of her, yet she has clearly suffered for more than <b>its</b> worth. &quot;</i> <br><i>alway</i> should be &quot;always&quot;.<br>The worth of what are you talking about? Did you mean &quot;more than it is worth&quot;? (&quot;it is&quot; may be contracted to &quot;it’s&quot;, &quot;its&quot; is a possessive pronoun). <br>Also, the whole thing is a bit running on. I’d recommend to split the action between the spoken lines into two sentences.<br><br><i>&quot;That would probably be a good idea,&quot; <b>asked</b> Binary.</i><br> How do you ask that?<br><br><i>And indeed, the one she had was Anju, her Digipartner.</i> <br>This sounds weird. May there be a word missing?<br><br><i>Anju! It’s so good <b>to see to see</b> you again!</i> <br>Too many words? I don’t believe that Aiko talks like that, even when she is excited.<br><br><i><b>It’s not that</b> we are both on a break long enough to actually meet each other.</i><br>I’m not sure whether Anju means what I read here. &quot;It’s not that ...&quot;, being a bit colloquial, implies that Anju currently is not on a break he deems long enough, and somehow (how?) also knows that Aiko is not on a long enough break, too, so that actually meeting each other is a really weird coincidence. I guess Anju means &quot;It’s not usual that ...&quot; or &quot;It doesn’t happen often that ...&quot;. <br>And I guess that the period should actually be a comma, because the sentence is continued by &quot;Anju replied ...&quot; (that’s a really tricky punctuation rule because what was replied were actually several sentences).<br><br><i>And there is <b>not much we can’t do</b> since ...</i> <br>Is the double negation intentional? There is actually a lot they can do? (Using double negations while meaning a single negation is significant for some dialects, but I don’t believe that Aiko talks like that.)<br><br><i>Still, we should enjoy this moment while it <b>last. Where you</b> headed?</i><br>Should be &quot;lasts&quot; (third person) and &quot;Where are you headed?&quot;, although leaving &quot;are&quot; out may be an intentional colloquialism. (Again, I don’t believe that Aiko talks like this.)<br><br><i>I specially like seeing the ones we knew growing up <b>and still there</b>.</i><br>I’m starting to wonder whether Aiko has a habit of leaving &quot;are&quot; out. Maybe the sentence should better end after &quot;growing up&quot;, because she obviously can’t see the ones who aren’t still there.<br>Also, MS Word Spell and Grammar Check thinks that <i>specially</i> is not the right choice of word, it should be &quot;especially&quot;, but that’s beyond my understanding of this foreign language. <br><br><i>And even we do, it’s probably unlike that it would always on same day and time like this</i><br>Aiko continues to leave words out. This should probably be &quot;And even <b>if</b> we do, it’s probably unlike that it would always <b>happen</b> on <b>the</b> same day and time like this&quot;. Also, <i>unlike</i> may need to be &quot;unlikely&quot;.<br><br><i>We <b>are</b> both always get too many missions for that.</i><br>To compensate for Aiko, Anju inserts an &quot;are&quot; that doesn’t need to be there.<br><br><i>Yeah, me too. Hopefully we can <b>find soon</b> now.</i><br>And then, Anju leaves out an &quot;it&quot; (should be &quot;find it soon&quot;).<br><br><i>Aiko hugged her right back, a warm smile showing<b> itself</b> on her face.</i><br>How does the smile do that? Actually, the face is doing the showing, so even &quot;a warm smile showing on her face&quot; is a bit weird, although not unusual (&quot;her face showing a warm smile&quot; would be more accurate); the word &quot;itself&quot; definitely should not be there.<br><br><i>I don’t particularly mind, <b>if helps</b> you with your class, but what is it that you would be talking about?</i><br>Another &quot;it&quot; missing (should be &quot;if it helps you with your class&quot;).<br><br><i>She bit her lip nervously.</i><br>Who? Obviously not Lapis, the last female character mentioned. With so many female characters being around, figuring out who it is takes too long. Better just say &quot;Diane&quot;.<br><br><i>Aiko, <b>don’t think</b> you played a part into that as well?</i><br>Should be &quot;don’t you think&quot;.<br><br>Enjoying this was difficult, seeing how often I was forced to figure out what was said and done. Halfway through I was close to give up, but it got better from there.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Okay, that&#39;s an interesting connectin to have between them, I guess. And having them called out by their Poke/Digi-partner was a nice touch too.

            <p>And yes, hopefully I&#39;ll get on with writing some missions for Anju as well soon enough. I just still haven&#39;t figured out where to send her or who her partner should be yet. <br><br>And well, you will just have to wait and see. But you&#39;re right. Entertainment should be guaranteed with the way it&#39;s turning out. ;) <br><br>But since we&#39;re speaking of co-writes: I will probably do a couple solo missions for now, gotta give Henry some more spotlight after all and I have a few HP badfics I wanna deal with that should perfect for that, but would you be available for that co-write we were talking before anytime soon?<br><br></p>

            <p>Hello! As some of you might know, I&#39;m studying a Plastic Arts degree at University, so, I&#39;m wondering if you guys could help me gather some data for a project I plan to present for at least one class.<br><br>The poll is simple, if you like any of the following genres:<br><br>Superhero (<i>DC and Marvel Multiverses, Astro City, Empowered, The Incredibles,</i> Etc.)<br><br>Magical Girl (<i>Sailor Moon, Card Captor Sakura, Magic Knight Rayearth, Mew Mew Power, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha,</i> Etc.)<br><br>Shounen Action (<i>Dragon Ball, Fist of the North Star, Fullmetal Alchemist, Bleach, Saint Seiya,</i> Etc.)<br><br>Shounen High School Comedy (<i>School Rumble, K-On!, Lucky Star, Azumanga Daioh, Mahou Sensei Negima!,</i> Etc.)<br><br>...could you answer the next three questions: (Yes, you can pick more than one, or all of them if you like them all)<br><br>1.- Why do you like that or those genres?<br><br>2.- What tropes and conventions used by them do you like the most?<br><br>3.- And what tropes and conventions used by them do you dislike the most?<br><br>And now, I think the poll might not be as simple as I thought... Hmm... Anyway, thank you all for your answers in advance!  (^,^ )<br></p>

            <p>1) A guy once said that Marvel make heroes you can relate to, while DC make heroes you can look up to. What I like most, though, is when heroes band together against the forces of evil and try to be <i>smart</i> about it. This is why I love <i>Worm</i> and why I am going to dig up every <i>Hellblazer</i> trade in the county if it kills me. John Constantine isn&#39;t very powerful at all, but he&#39;s cunning and thinks round corners and tries to game the system as much as humanly possible (which, considering this is a bloke who <a href="http://www.mcmbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screenshot-2014-11-29-18.25.14-274x300.png">ripped the wings off the Archangel Gabriel with a friggin&#39; <i>chainsaw</i></a>, is a surprisingly large amount). Also, something he said struck me as profound.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll tell you the ultimate secret of magic,&quot; he said. &quot;Any c*nt can do it.&quot;<br><br>I want heroes who can be heroes. I also want heroes who aren&#39;t immensely musclebound paragons of jock-style masculinity - seriously, Supes, it&#39;s the Fortress of Solitude, not the Fortress of CrossFit - and heroines who don&#39;t look like two watermelons nailed to an upturned mop. I want to see normal people using their small amount of powers to make the world a better place. I like the small-scale, street-level guys who make lives better for the little guy; not just beating alien invaders, but the crime bosses, protection racketeers, and smaller-scale indignities. It&#39;s why I&#39;m getting on well with the Marvel TV stuff on Netflix, I suppose. People fighting in hallways with costumes courtesy of the local Oxfam. Good show.<br><br>2) I sort of think I&#39;ve answered this already with my talking about what heroes mean to me, but I really like the diversity of origins and backstory available to the world of superheroes. They present a much more optimistic worldview (except for that period in the Nineties where everything was grim and gritty and XTREEEEEME) and, y&#39;know, I can respect that. I want more superheroes from other cultures, specifically sub-Saharan African nations (big surprise, I know). I want more than just Americans punching each other and/or aliens. Let&#39;s have a chain-smoking Scouse wizard hack his own soul in half to get around a deal with Satan.<br><br>Catch Spiderman doing <i>that</i> to get his marriage back. =]<br><br>3) A similar objection to the ones Ix has, really. There&#39;s not much diversity in the big names. Take the seven founding members of the Justice League (or the Justice League of America to give them their full title, which is a whole other can of worms that led to a brief appearance in one of my Champions campaigns of the Justice League of the Glorious People&#39;s Democratic Republic of Milton Keynes and Surrounding Conurbations). Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, Green Lantern, and the Martian Manhunter. One woman. No POC, unless you count the ostensibly Greek-ish Diana. For decades, the black guys on the team were outnumbered by people who were bloody <i>green</i>. Also, super glad that Cyborg&#39;s in now, but still. My point stands. I would also really like it if some superheroines could not look like the contents of the artist&#39;s spank bank, that can&#39;t be too much to ask. =]<br><br>Also, to expand on an earlier comment, I hate One More Day and I&#39;d love to see Spiderman get an army together and kick Mephisto&#39;s teeth in. Possibly with the help of people from the DCU, like John Constantine. I think they&#39;d get on well.</p>

            <p>So why not both at the same time? I do see a lot of similarities between these two, after all.<br><br>1) SO many things! The heroes, the villains, the monsters and machines, the over-the-top fighting, the effects... I could go on and on!<br>2) A lot of stories in both genres are basically &quot;Characters meet each other, fight a lot, and eventually form a team.&quot; That&#39;s a perfectly fine example of what happens when people work together for long enough and I like it a lot. By the same token, the &quot;villains teaming up with heroes against a common foe&quot; scenario is also fun to watch, especially if it leads to the redemption of the former.<br>3) tfw minor characters get killed off like flies EVERY SINGLE EPISODE ;_; I just want even the C-Listers to live, dangit!</p>

            <p>But since I don&#39;t have the patience to answer all of them, I&#39;ll answer the ones about magical girl shows.<br><br>1) They were some of the first anime I ever watched as a fledgling middle-school weeaboo, and I felt like I understood the main characters a little better than, say, Yugi or Goku. Also, I&#39;ve always been fascinated by any variety of magic, so there you go.<br><br>2) The literal Power of Friendship saving the day. Also how the girls go from cute, awkward civilians to cute, magic-wielding badasses when the monster of the week comes calling.<br><br>3) How the heroes (and occasionally the bad guys, too) barely even disguise themselves and still no one notices anything unusual. (Sailor Moon and Tokyo Mew Mew are particularly notable offenders; Cardcaptor Sakura gets  points back for having a different costume for each Clow Card fight.)</p>

            <p>1) Wish fulfillment, simple as that. <br><br>2) Shy/nerdy/bullied kid turns out to have superpowers or gains them through random accident and goes on to become a hero. Again, wish fulfillment; I identified a lot with Spider-Man as a kid for those reasons.<br><br>3) Every female superhero looking like this:<br><br><img src="http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/superheroines_most_common_power.jpg" alt="http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/superheroines_most_common_power.jpg"> <br><br>Can we please get somebody with a smaller chest in here? I don&#39;t think these artists realize how difficult/painful it is to run, let alone fight, with such large *ahem* assets.<br><br>Also, the all-too-pervasive &quot;We can&#39;t be together because my enemies will hurt you to hurt me&quot; trope. I&#39;m sorry, but the emotional attachment is there and the bad guys know it. Spend time with your loved one while you can, because inevitable kidnapping/torture/murder is inevitable.</p>

            <p>Hi I&#39;m Linanoreth [or at least thats my board name :P]<br><br>I accidentally stumbled across the PPC wiki derping around on the web about 4? years back then one day about 1-2 years ago I finally got around to reading the original stories. What finally got me posting on the board after all these years was having a LOTR movie marathon and revisiting the LOTR section on ff.net haha. Read OFUM realized misscam used to be part of the PPC and decided I had to engage in the community!<br><br>I&#39;ve read the Constitution and FAQ, which is kinda where I&#39;m getting all my inspiration from right now X)<br><br>I&#39;m a cis female, Asian, live in Texas but have dual American-Taiwanese citizenship, speak English first, Mandarin badly.<br><br>Fun fact: my author name was originally cooked up when I made an Elven character on LOTRO a looong time ago haha. It&#39;s also my League gamer tag if anyone wants to play with me ;) [I&#39;m p bad though #unranked]<br><br>Fanfic writing wise I spend most of my time lurking on asianff, AO3, and ff.net in that order.<br><br>A list of fandoms I&#39;m in: [just off the top of my head, I am definitely missing some]<br><br>Marvel<br>K-pop [I am extremely multifandom within this group and I&#39;m not sure if any of y&#39;all are into k-pop too so I&#39;ll leave this vague]<br>HP<br>Sherlock<br>LOTR [it&#39;s been ages since I&#39;ve read the books though, and I never read the Silmarillion so my lore is pretty pathetic right now]<br>And I&#39;ve watched tons and tons of animes in my life-time. Some of them were like a decade ago, so you&#39;ll definitely have to ask me for specifics!<br><br><br>Shady fact: not sure if I should share this and get made fun of, but I was at the prime age when the Twilight franchise was big, so there maybe 1-2 maybe 6 twilight fanfics floating on the internet with my name stamped on them.</p>

I was very involved in the fandom, especially on DeviantArt. I&#39;m a huge history nerd so everything about the show that was actually based on history was great. I couldn&#39;t help but love Austria/Prussia/Hungary relationship though :P<br><br>I don&#39;t really know any fan theories besides the Germany becomes HRE and Greece/Byzantine/Roman Empire family lineage wreck because I prefer Hetalia head cannons a lot more.

There are ex-Twitards here, nothing to fuss about. Now, if you really want to forget tht part of your life, try also Das Sporking. Te administrator of the site, Mervin did a wonderful critic of the series with her sister. Said sister also wrote severral sprklepires&#39; backstories, except now they&#39;re characters you can like, and is halfway through a (sadly) non published rewrite of Twilight the first. Let&#39;s say the two first unbetaed chapters uesd as previews trump the book and leave it at that.</p>

            <p>I occasionally like to entertain myself by coming up with battles between fictional characters.  And usually it is a match against Superman.  Why Superman?  Well I just don&#39;t much care for him, so I like to see if anyone can beat him.  Now usually I try to match Superman power for power.  But this time I tried to do something a little bit different.  And now I want to poll the community and see what they say.<br><br>So with out further stalling here is the match up.<br><br>Superman vs. The Doctor<br><br>The important information.  Superman has his classic characterization.  The Boy Scout.  Truth, Justice, and the American Way.  All that type of stuff.  The important thing to note about this Superman is that he has all of his moral fetters in place.<br><br>On to the Doctor.  The Doctor gets both his sonic screwdriver and TARDIS.  I figure that&#39;s the fairest way to do it.  <br><br>As for me, I give this one the Doctor.  Access to the TARDIS is what gives him the edge.  <br><br>I am curious as to what you all think about that match up.  Also if you all come up with other possible options to fight the Man of Steel, feel free to post them to.  Or if you just have any general Who Would Win in a Fight match ups.  </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know much about DW, but which Doctor, exactly? And why would they fight? I think it would either end with Superman smashing the TARDIS, or The Doctor traveling through time to get a piece of kryptonite. Otherwise, they would probably be at it until one of them either dies of old age, or passes into the public domain</p>

            <p>Hi all!  I&#39;m looking for a beta reader for my first attempt at an actual fanfic in years. What with the release of the Cursed Child and all, I thought it was high time to revisit the Potterverse. It&#39;s a short one-shot, currently unnamed. The story follows some of Neville&#39;s experiences in the early part of his seventh year.  </p>

            <p>So then.<br><br>Not too long ago, I broke a record: Valon Vance and Kala Jeng now have the most missions in the Department of Floaters.<br><br>It was a nice feeling, but something&#39;s been bothering me since that mission&#39;s release.<br><br>See, I&#39;ve tried to break formula a few times in the past; every single time, I got shouted down by the community and had to scrap the ideas completely. After all of that, I&#39;ve been too scared to stray from the PPC formula.<br><br>But now that I have over twenty PPC stories, I&#39;m really concerned about something.<br><br>Namely, getting stale.<br><br>Missions are, at their core, the same thing over and over again, and you can only vary your jokes so much. Eventually, you&#39;ll exhaust everything that the formula lets you do, and you&#39;re left with the basic &quot;follow, charge, kill/exorcize/disentangle&quot; process.<br><br>I&#39;m too afraid of backlash to try anything new, but at the same time, if I keep things the same, I&#39;ll bore my readers... All five of them. (I don&#39;t kid myself, I can count the number of PPCers who actually follow my stories on one hand.)<br><br>This is a conundrum I don&#39;t know how to deal with, because I only see three bad options: try something new and have everyone hate it, keep things the same and bore everyone, or stop writing altogether.</p>

            <p>Consider a sitcom. A <i>classic</i> sitcom, like Seinfeld or It&#39;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia or Red Dwarf. Those shows adhered to a formula, but they worked because while the setup for a show was formulaic, the character interaction and arcs kept the whole thing moving. Everyone might have stayed fairly similar, but they evolved over time. That&#39;s what good PPC writing tries to achieve. Sure, you can do distinct breaks from the formula - I&#39;ve got a few projects like that on the boil myself, including one almost entirely done in haiku - but it&#39;s not necessarily what people are here for. There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with having a formula, if that formula consistently results in high-quality writing. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something that you need to be afraid of. =]</p>

I&#39;m reluctant to initiate it, though, because it basically revolves around me being a prick to one of my characters and thus might end up being somewhat dark.<br><br>Eventually, I&#39;m going to run out of off-the-cuff stories to tell with Valon, Kala and Stephanie.

            <p>Being a prick to your characters is the foundation of good writing. Kill your darlings an&#39; all that. Besides, stuff can be dark as well as funny; just remember to balance everything out.<br><br>I know you don&#39;t like her very much, or at least you never used to, but the Notary is a pretty good example of this. She&#39;s a horrible, appalling, atrocious person. We&#39;ve also briefly seen one of her past regenerations that indicated she wasn&#39;t always like that; something happened to <i>make</i> her that way. I just haven&#39;t got round to telling people what it is yet. She does have an arc revolving around going to a pretty dark place and coming out better for it, and it&#39;ll take a while to get there but that&#39;s why I&#39;m writing the character.<br><br>To be honest with you, mate, I tend to view the actual <i>mission</i> portion of a PPC mission as something of an ancillary concern. We&#39;re here to laugh at the badfic, yeah, but we end up staying for the characters. We want to see <i>their</i> reactions to it, in a setting that allows them to do this. If we didn&#39;t, we&#39;d be writing MST3K-style sporkings like every other collection of snarky, snobbish pseudo-comedians on the Internet. The characters and their stories are important, so if you&#39;ve got a story for them, tell it. It&#39;ll be interesting! =]</p>

            <p>And, er, the whole Big Sib thing&#39;s Pompeii-ified, so I suppose I&#39;ll just shout out to everyone in the general vicinity, hoping nobody complains about civil disturbances, or anything like that. <br><br>Majority of my PPC stuff, permission prompts and all included, focus on fellows in Building Maintenance. Always been fond of the under-represented background-types, myself. Was initially planning on trying out weirder stuff, moving into missions later on. <br>So, I came up with the concepts of them a bit back, when I had less knowledge of the PPC, how it worked, how it ought to work, what we ought to be doing, et al, and I now wonder if that&#39;s a good idea, is all. <br><br>Perhaps it&#39;s a point against me, my writing skills, my personality, my being, my existence, and my horrible stench that I&#39;m going out asking about this, but I figure, what&#39;s the sense in a community that doesn&#39;t commune, right? All you have left is &#39;Ity,&#39; which sounds like a bug of some kind, and I quite like bugs, but they&#39;re fairly irrelevant to the point I&#39;m making.<br>Just ought to ask if it&#39;d be better to retool them into mission-doing-fellows, retconning past stuff (I mean, it&#39;s not technically canon, anyway,) or if I ought to keep them, and make other, separate characters, over them. <br>I mean, I quite like them, as is. Pretty decently developed, I like their personalities and chemistry and all, and I probably <i>could</i> alter them, but, at the same time, it feels a tad spooky to make a change like that, y&#39;know? I&#39;ve already done quite a bit with them, and it just seems (<i>seems</i>) an awful big change. Have to redo those prompts, and all. <br>I mean, you lot know what you&#39;re doing. Figured it wouldn&#39;t hurt to get some ideas. <br>I&#39;d just like some advice. Thoughts. Silly jokes. Insults. Undisguised loathing. Cooking tips. </p>

            <p>Sorry if I&#39;m a couple days behind everyone else, just started a job this week. Anyway:<br><br>At my college, most of the tabletop RPG players run in the same group. We&#39;ve had some loony characters and players we had to deal with, but none as Sue-ish as the guy who wanted to play Thor.<br><br>He needed to be a deity, or as close to it as you can get as a player character, so he was a Kyrie, which are basically angels. But he didn&#39;t know he was an angel, and he didn&#39;t have wings. This was because when he was young, his mother was kidnapped, he was cursed, and he forgets anything that has to do with who his mother is, or what his powers are. No word on the father, who presumably fell victim to Protagonist Parent Syndrome. But don&#39;t worry, this guy still had a relic to remember his mother by. It was basically Thor&#39;s hammer. Big, lightning-y, and with a spell that let it return if he threw it.<br><br>The idea itself was vaguely overpowered, poorly thought out, and cliche, but it was serviceable. The real problem was when he actually played this character. If it didn&#39;t advance HIS plot, he didn&#39;t care. He got into a significant amount of (verbal) fights with the party about how he needed to find his mother, because the GM kept enabling him with plot hooks, even though the entire rest of the party was more concerned with the actual campaign objective. This was a group of upperclassmen after all, so they were basically working on a timer until they graduated.<br><br>Eventually, the player ended up moving schools. I can&#39;t say he was anything less than a good guy, but I also can&#39;t say that I miss his play-style.</p>

            <p>This one time I was in a Secret Santa event over on deviantART, and the person I was partnered with requested a story about her OC, Delilah.<br><br>Problem was, her story changed in literally every picture I looked at. Sometimes she was an Eevee with a green collarband tail, sometimes she was a fully green wolf, sometimes she was wolf!Saturn&#39;s sister, sometimes his partner...she even mentioned, of all possible characters, Richtofen and Dempsey from Modern Warfare in one picture. <a href="http://vaporeonwarfare.deviantart.com/gallery/">See for yourself</a>. For simplicity&#39;s sake, in the gift fic itself, I stuck with her Eevee form but decided that &quot;she&quot; was actually Mesprit messing with my self-insert OC, Allison, hence the references to Richtofen, Dempsey, and Saturn.</p>

            <p>At least, I hope so. <br><br>The character I have in mind was definitely not the Worst Sue (TM) I&#39;ve encountered by a long shot but I was forced to share the most intimate, enduring experience with her.  And her sister.<br><br>Her profile reads as follows:<br>Race: Human (half Rhodinian- Aritownian)<br>Skill set: Reasonable when it comes to cooking.<br>Can sew well<br>Character Description: 18 years old. Patient and mother-like. Cares dearly for her younger sister, Lilac. Her Aritownian Mom and her Juctimian Father ran away after giving birth to Lilac for an unknown reason. Lyra had to find herself a job at Thornspike Hall to feed herself and her sister. However she is very depressed and has low self esteem due to the racism she faced during her time at Thornspike Hall. As well, all the other maids  and servants seem to be comparing her appearance to Lilac - although Lyra is actually better looking than all those servants and maids. She finds this world unfair and  is secretly determined to seek revenge  on her parents and the society - practically everyone.<br><br>Which sounds reasonable enough.  But this description doesn&#39;t even begin to describe what she was actually written like.  <br><br>I had to work with this for years in a writing collab.  I&#39;m still working with this.  I joined the project late, so it took me a while to catch up on things, and since the character had been accepted I just assumed she was less Sue-y than I was thinking, or that Character Development happened.  I only learned recently that the lead writer just never had the heart to tell her.  </p>

            <p>Assuming we&#39;re allowed to post unpublished Sues.<br><br>Early in around 2011-2012, I stumbled upon <a>this website.</a> If you don&#39;t want to click it, basically it&#39;s a bunch of comics that are set in a school AU of Plants vs. Zombies with different character personalities. (Due to the &quot;species&quot; argument, where each plant in the game is in fact only representative of tens, hundreds, perhaps thousands of a species like them, it&#39;s not a replacement.) <br><br>Of course, MS Paint and having a bunch of <i>those</i> kinds of kids at the wheel don&#39;t get you very far at all.<br><br>Unfortunately for me, I did not know what cringe was and I also happened to conveniently be a part of the demographic I just mentioned. So I treated it like it was some big media production, cooking up some incredibly wicked fantasies, including an implausible crossover between an AU already going straight to hell and mechs from mecha anime. ...Yeah. <br><br>If I didn&#39;t renounce my status as a fan of the genre for years I would&#39;ve become a stereotypical weeb, I&#39;m sure of it.<br><br>I&#39;m not even ready to type the fullest of my memories up a second time, so I&#39;ll just copy-paste a few bits from the first time I did.<br><br>- <i>&quot;I would seriously imagine each character as holding on to a weapon, item, etc. up to and (mostly!) including downscaled fully functional mechs (which I imagined as suits/transformations) from mecha anime and games.<br>I would then proceed to beef up the original mechs as much as possible.&quot;</i> Surprisingly enough, this actually makes the most sense for how it came to be since this is pretty much what most badfic written by a child is.<br><br>- <i>&quot;The Mary Sue approach to death. Die, friends mope a <strike>bit</strike> ton, five days later they&#39;re back and everyone acts like it&#39;d been five years, not five days.&quot;</i> I treated the &quot;depressing&quot; points of the AU like the ultimate edgelord. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still do that sometimes, but at least I have some better judgement in playing it out.<br><br>- In short, I also wound up creating replacements of the entire cast. Eventually, the multiverse kitchen sink bug hit, with Minecraft taking the lead by a huge margin. I had basically developed at least five different versions of myself, with no variety. (I&#39;m trying to write two agents right now that are supposed to be this but with actual variety. One&#39;s the snobby, hot-blooded-but-weak-minded kid and the other&#39;s the more judgmental, realist individual. I sort of have to balance these two major personality factors as one whole every day.)<br><br>And there you have it. Of all the Mary Sues in the world, nothing can really top what children wind up making. It&#39;s just that none of their &quot;brainchildren&quot; (including mine) have surfaced on the internet until now... <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2016/plants-vs-zombies-fan-fiction.wikia.com/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies_Begins&gt;oh%20wait.&lt;/a&gt;%20(my%20creation.%20I%20regret%20it%20immensely.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/FORM&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div%20class=%22buttons%22&gt;&lt;form%20method=%22post%22%20action=%22discussion.cgi?disc=199610%22%20enctype=%22multipart/form-data%22&gt;&lt;input%20type=%22hidden%22%20name=%22disc%22%20value=%22199610%22%20%20/&gt;&lt;input%20type=%22hidden%22%20name=%22parent%22%20value=%22300170%22%20%20/&gt;&lt;input%20type=%22hidden%22%20name=%22grandparent%22%20value=%22300145%22%20%20/&gt;&lt;input%20type=%22hidden%22%20name=%22pagemark%22%20value=%22525%22%20%20/&gt;&lt;input%20type=%22submit%22%20name=%22postresponse%22%20value=%22Post%20Reply%22%20style=%22float:left;%22%20class=%22button%22%20id=%22postresponse%22%20/&gt;&lt;input%20type=%22submit%22%20name=%22returntoarticles%22%20value=%22Return%20to%20Messages%22%20style=%22float:left;%22%20class=%22button%22%20id=%22returntoarticles%22%20/&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;form%20method=%22post%22%20action=%22http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdisc.yourwebapps.com%2Fdiscussion.cgi%3Fdisc%3D199610%3Barticle%3D300170&amp;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board%20-%20Remembering%20my%20own%20was%20a%20painful%20experience.&amp;pub=brunnock%22%20enctype=%22multipart/form-data%22&gt;&lt;input%20type=%22submit%22%20name=%22share%22%20value=%22Share%22%20style=%22float:left;%22%20class=%22button%22%20id=%22share%22%20/&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div%20style=%22clear:left;%22&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div%20class=%22responses%22&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li%20class=%22message_entry%20%22&gt;&lt;div%20class=%22response_headers%22&gt;&lt;span%20class=%22response_headers%20%22&gt;&lt;a%20class=%22article_link%22%20href=%22/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=300145;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=525%22&gt;Worst%20Sue%20you"> — <span>LonelyStar,</span>   <span>Fri Aug 19 12:44am</span></a></p>

            <p>Hello everybody! It&#39;s been more than a week since the last thread and it fell off the main page, so I&#39;d like to bring the following to everyone&#39;s attention:<br>1) Effective right now, I will make the PGs who frequent the Discord channel mods until the community chooses other people.<br>2) Please nominate people that you think should be mods. Right now only Cat-on-the-Keyboard nominated herself.<br>3) The mods&#39; powers should be decided on; specifically, whether they should have the technical ability to ban people, but also any other thing that relates to that.<br>4) Unrelated to the rest, but I&#39;d like to regularly prune inactive users every week; what it does is that it kicks every users that wasn&#39;t active for a certain period of time. The question is, should it be a week, or a month? In either case the people kicked by this process can rejoin the channel by following the <a href="https://discord.gg/W7C9g">invite link</a>.</p>

            <p>It seems that the community&#39;s decision is to make Tomash (five votes), Ix (four votes) and Cat-on-the-Keyboard (three votes) mods of the channel. Tomorrow I will make it so and remove mod permission from Delta Juliette and PC. If anybody has any sort of objection, voice it now or forever hold your peace.<br><br>The next article is the mods&#39; powers, to wit: should they be able to ban people from the channel, or should that only be something the Owner does after a person was banned from the PPC in general?<br><br>Also, since nobody said anything, I am going to prune the members of the channel every week — in other words, every Saturday I&#39;ll kick any member that did not log-in for 30 days or more. The channel can be rejoined by asking the owner or the mods for an invite, in any case.</p>

            <p>The way I see it, anyone who&#39;s going to get banned from the channel is probably going to get banned from the Board, right? <br>They go by the same rules and constitution, after all, no matter where it is they break them. <br><br>So, I figure that it&#39;ll probably make more sense if banning from Discord is done by the Owner, after all that Board banning stuff.
