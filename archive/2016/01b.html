            <p>David Bowie was one facet - a big one - of my childhood music. If Dad wasn&#39;t singing Bolan, he was singing Bowie. I grew up listening to <i>Won&#39;t you stay in our lovers&#39; story/If you stay, you won&#39;t be sorry...</i> on a regular basis.<br><br>And of course there&#39;s <i>Labyrinth</i>. That movie was amazing, and it&#39;s never really let me go.<br><br>Goodbye, Bowie.<br><br>hS <img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Memorials/BowieMemorial.png"><br><br><i>I had to phone someone, so I picked on you-u-u<br>Hey that&#39;s far out, so you heard him too-oo-oo?<br>Switch on your TV<br>We may pick him up on Channel Two...</i></p>

            <p>Greetings once again, ladies and gentlemen, hobbits and Time Lords, and all other configurations of being! It is me, I am back once again.<br><br>Finally, I have the chance to post again! It wasn&#39;t supposed to take this long to get back here, but life happened. But now that the year is fresh and new, I have more opportunities to return to work on things I want to do, which, until now, have been left unattended.<br><br>I&#39;m ready to get back into the swing of things, if you&#39;ll still have me.<br><br>~ Dark Brother 16</p>

This is the first time we&#39;ve really been able to have a look at how pre-existing items affect multiple Pokémon in this gimmick, and it&#39;s really quite exciting! Seaking, however, is... not the best &#39;mon to take this item on, though. Soldier&#39;s Syringe&#39;s effect (a 50% chance to boost your Attack, Speed, or Accuracy by 1 stage whenever you get hit by a contact move) isn&#39;t well-suited to a &#39;mon with Seaking&#39;s kind of terrible defences, but try using a Lightningrod set with Waterfall, Megahorn, Drill Run, and Body Slam. Paraflinching. It is absolutely disgusting. =]</p>

            <p>I guess I&#39;ll give you a Cliff&#39;s notes version of the Pyronomicon. Very useful for basic fire magic, but its more for fending off flames. Like some other boarders have said, have you read all the basic PPC reading material? If so, have a cookie. If you haven&#39;t, have a cookie anyways.</p>

Also, can you tell us what you&#39;re into, what pronouns you use, and if you&#39;ve read any PPC spinoffs so far? (I recommend SkarmorySilver&#39;s missions featuring Falchion, Rashida, and Velociripper, as well as anything by Voyd, Iximaz, and the sadly-now-inactive Herr Wozzeck.)</p>

This thread is a perfectly fine place to do that.<br><br>It&#39;s also a good place for anyone else who needs one to ask - and for anyone who wants to become a Big Sib to <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Sib/Little_Sib#How_to_Become_a_Big_Sib">look at the description</a> and sign up! I&#39;m sure the other Big Sibs would be delighted to have you on-board.<br><br>hS, not a Big Sib because very bad at replying to emails</p>

            <p>I <i>think</i> Javascript has the capacity to make images from scratch (through .svg stuff?), but that would take literally months to duplicate what I&#39;ve already put in there (which, by the way, is a very brute-force way of doing this: it&#39;s just a bunch of .pngs that overlay in different ways). The other way I can think of is to separate out the different colours used and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6109530">use each one as a separate mask</a>. That would... at least triple the number of files, but with PaintShop would at least be technically doable. Maybe if I get really bored.<br><br>As for the consoles... yeah, I know, but those are the most annoyingly fiddly parts.

            <p>You can either do a rating straight away (like OS) or end up undesignated as a seaman, airman, or fireman, which are more generalized, and have different routes.<br><br>Seamen can eventually strike any rating available in the navy- if it&#39;s something that is air or engineering related, they tend to have to wait for a school outside of a couple, because it&#39;s more specialized.  <br><br>Airmen can eventually pick any aviation based rating, and don&#39;t have to go to school for those, usually, since they&#39;re learning it while onboard.<br><br>firemen can eventually pick any engineering based rating, and again, usually don&#39;t have to go to school for those, because they&#39;re learning it onboard as well. <br><br>Once you get a rating you can pick up petty officer, and thus more responsibilities, and can specialize further and further in your field. All OSes don&#39;t have the same specialities, and neither do BMs, and so on and so forth.<br><br>So yeah, comparing it to picking a class in an RPG works out pretty well. </p>

            <p>I found it hard to determine the boundary of OOCness. <br><br>When non-human creatures or objects, like Pokemon or even inanimate items like rings are being turned into human beings, whether they are in the real human society or not, surely their personality would change under the setting of the AU. <br><br>Is it acceptable as long as the author justified it well enough? <br><br>For example, let&#39;s say if all Redwall characters were humans living in fourteen-century England under an AU setting. Some of their minor characteristics would definitely change because they already had different backstories and experiences to begin with, but it still portrayed most of the canon personalities well enough.<br><br>Or for hateful characters that loathe human race simply because in canon, they were much higher beings than humans and viewed them as pests. <br><br>If such characters were to be put into a Humanization AU where they are human beings, it did not make sense for them to have the same kind of hatred as they are humans themselves. Generally they will still be hateful and display great animosity towards everyone around them, but they would not possibly despise their own species.<br><br>So......if such an AU make sense, even if the background and minor trait of the characters are changed, do they really qualify as a badfic?</p>

            <p>That is: I&#39;m throwing one, in honor of the fact that <b>yesterday, January 13th</b>, marks three years since I made my introductory post on the Board. Come party with me! And do let me know how many of you have snow around; I&#39;m curious about how widespread this part of winter is right now.<br><br>...for that matter: who are all of you? I&#39;ve been around, but busy enough not to have greeted every newbie who&#39;s shown up over the past...er, half a year? More? Less? Come say hi, and have belated newbie gifts! *marshals stock of Swiss Bleepolate and assorted Gummyblees* As to everyone I know from farther back--how are you all? Come take some NM&amp;NMs if you want them!<br><br>By way of <b>gifts to everyone</b> who&#39;s into Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, LotR, Tamora Pierce&#39;s work, Doctor Who, Ender&#39;s Game, Avengers/Agents of SHIELD, um, half a dozen other fandoms including Disney and Teen Wolf...<a href="http://ink-splotch.tumblr.com/">this author</a> is my latest recommendation. She&#39;s ink-splotch on Tumblr (the link I just gave), <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/users/dirgewithoutmusic/works">dirgewithoutmusic</a> on AO3, and E. Jade Lomax for her original work. She&#39;s written the most amazing Harry Potter fics, something about Susan Pevensie and Eowyn that was just wonderful, some awesome Emelan and Tortall stories, and I don&#39;t even know what else, because I&#39;ve only read a fraction of her work so far. Her original work (something about a school for heroes--not superheroes, fairy tale type heroes) is very highly praised, though I haven&#39;t read it yet, and is available as free ebooks or not free physical books.<br><br>Essentially--her work is amazing, and I highly recommend her. She does a lot of AUs and some canon-friendly things as well; her Harry Potter AUs are just incredible. Her <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/5579962?view_adult=true">what if Harry had been a squib AU</a> was the first one I saw, followed by <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/4308786">what if the Dursleys refused to take Harry in and he was raised at Hogwarts</a>, which is chock-full of fluff and feels and everything good. Check her out! <s>and join me and the RL friend who introduced me to her work in trying not to read more and more of her fics while needing sleep and to focus on schoolwork</s><br><br>Well. Anyhow. Here&#39;s to three years, and many more to come! *throws confetti* *looks around for <i>Supernatural</i> fans*<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: Speaking of SPN--I have such a rant for the more recent developments of it, because THAT MAKES NO SENSE, but I am told the writers actually, seriously wrote it and and and...yeah, no. Nope. So much nope. And not in a good way.</p>

            <p>The last time I saw snow was two years ago, and that was because I visited America. It&#39;s bloody summer over here, though, I don&#39;t think the clouds are aware of it.

            <p>First of all, I want to start out by saying how disappointed I am with myself and with moviegoers that I have been unable to go out and see Star Wars: The Force Awakens yet. Seriously, I have looked everywhere in my city&#39;s theaters, and these tickets for Star Wars are sold out for weeks! But I will eventually see it.<br><br>Now, on to the point I want to actually talk about. I did some surfing on the world wide web, and I have come across the original, rough draft for George Lucas&#39; original Star Wars, and I have to say, it&#39;s very interesting.<br><br>The Jedi are called Jedi Bendu now, for starters. But they are a now endangered breed of bodyguards to the emperor of the Old Empire, and they were hunted by the Knights of the Sith, who created a New Empire.<br><br>Now, a lone Jedi Bendu, who had been living under a rock on the Fourth Moon of Utapau with his sons Deak and Annikin, finds himself hunted by a Sith Knight, who kills his son Deak. The Jedi Bendu, Kane Starkiller, takes his son Annikin to Aquilae, one of the last Independent planets left outside the New Empire. At the same time, the Emperor plots to annex Aquilae, but spies learn what he&#39;s up to and send word to Aquilae.<br><br>Meanwhile, The Starkillers reach Aquilae and run into Luke Skywalker, a grizzled old veteran Jedi Bendu who agrees to teach Annikin the ways of the Jedi Bendu. As this is going on, Aquilae&#39;s princess Leia goes off to college at Yuell, and the spy arrives to tell everyone what the Emperor wants to do. Kane Starkiller doesn&#39;t hear about this, though, because he is off meeting his Ureallian friend Han Solo.<br><br>The link to the rest of the story is right here.<br><a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Star_Wars:_Rough_Draft"><a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Star_Wars:_Rough_Draft">http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Star_Wars:_Rough_Draft</a></a><br><br>It&#39;s really an interesting piece, and it bears a lot of similarities to The Phantom Menace.

            <p>Following discussion <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=288622;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">starting here</a>, I want to have a look at the current list of Legendary Badfics with the new guidelines in mind.<br>Since a number of these don&#39;t actually qualify anymore, a handful of us figured we should look at them individually and vote on whether which, if any, should be kept in via grandfather clause. That&#39;s what this thread is for!<br>The following Legendary Badfics don&#39;t fulfill the new criteria:<br><br>Celebrian: Only three hits in the past year. Generally agreed to be bad, and missioned as a Legendary Badfic.<br><br>Cho Chang&#39;s Desires: Appears to have been deleted from the internet. Despite being called Legendary, nobody has re-posted it or, apparently, sporked it at all. No obvious reason to keep this one.<br><br>Cupcakes: Only a few hits in the past year... until you go to image search, where there&#39;s plenty.<br><br>Draco&#39;s Christmas Cuppa: Nothing in the past year. I&#39;d argue that it isn&#39;t even a badfic so much as a severe case of My Kink is not Your Kink. Was missioned as a Legendary.<br><br>Land Before Time: Littlefoot x Cera: Nothing in the past year. Was missioned as a legendary repeatedly, as new chapters kept going up and being targeted.<br><br>Lion King Orgy Poem: Nothing at all. No reason to stay.<br><br>Little Miss Mary: Two hits. However, one of those is the fic itself, despite the fact that it&#39;s over ten years old.<br><br>Subjugation: Three hits. Not missioned, but multiple agents sent into it ended up Snapped In Action due to it, so it&#39;s established as legendary in-universe.<br><br>Rose Potter: Only one hit. Missioned (in style, no less), and established as legendary in-universe.<br><br>That Series: Nothing whatsoever. Missioned, so established as legendary in-universe.<br><br>So, yeah. That&#39;s the lot. Some of these have better reasons to stay than others. Basically, what you need to do is pick out any that aren&#39;t worth keeping. If after 24 hours, a majority of people with an opinion have nominated the same badfic for removal, I&#39;ll go take it off the list. Anything that&#39;s nominated but doesn&#39;t get a majority nomination... well, I&#39;ll call a vote on anything like that in a couple of days.<br><br>To start off, I think we can get rid of Cho Chang&#39;s Desires (doesn&#39;t exist anymore, so this is logical), the Lion King Orgy Poem (doesn&#39;t really seem infamous at all), and Draco&#39;s Christmas Cuppa (it&#39;s slipped below the radar, and reads more like an ordinary bleepfic).<br>So, uh, nominate away!<br><br>(Oh, and this is the only time we&#39;ll be removing legendaries from the established list, I promise!)</p>

            <p>Again, I&#39;ll state my preference for maintaining the Legendary status of anything that was missioned as a Legendary.<br><br>&quot;Cupcakes&quot; was <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KmcAgo2JEbSFBr6ZFRHUSp3Ey4gXyi384U90HLipCnE/edit?hl=en_US">missioned</a>. In fact, that mission is responsible for bringing a fair number of people to the Board from TV Tropes. Also, the badfic is indisputably notorious—it&#39;s even on Know Your Meme, IIRC. It&#39;s Legendary.<br><br>&quot;Draco&#39;s Christmas Cuppa&quot; was also <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_g2HEN80Dx2wOCkZ2r85QciRDSFTrBDEQyhtPaNIvY8/edit?usp=sharing">missioned</a>, which you mentioned. Unless Iximaz and Scapegrace are okay with it being demoted to Bleepfic, I&#39;m against it.<br><br>&quot;Cho Chang&#39;s Desires&quot; does come up a few times in the List of Things I Am Not Allowed to Do in the PPC (I don&#39;t remember which parts specifically, or I&#39;d link them). Its wiki page might be worth keeping just to explain those mentions, but unless further evidence of the fic itself turns up so we can see what all the fuss was about, I suggest we demote it to Bleepfic.<br><br>I&#39;ll second the outright removal of the Lion King Orgy Poem. I couldn&#39;t be bothered with it back then, and I can&#39;t be bothered with it now. I suspect it only got noticed in the first place because it&#39;s by the same author as That Series.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I just get the feeling that we need to do an agent/boarder headcount. Just so that we know for sure who&#39;s active, who&#39;s inactive, who&#39;s dead, who&#39;s missing, and who&#39;s insane. Basically, an &quot;all hands on deck&quot; thing. We dont really have to do this, but I just get the feeling that the current wiki database may not be complete. Should we try do this, and have an &quot;at least x amount of boarders, and x amount of agents have ever been part of the ppc?&quot;</p>

            <p>But, like, how would we? It&#39;s difficult to spot the difference between &#39;stopped posting&#39; and &#39;stopped being alive&#39;, especially in this post-LJ age.<br><br>Two events spring to mind that relate, though. Way back in 2006, we had a pair of posters called Union Jack 2.0 and SergeantHeretic. At one point, someone claiming to be Union Jack&#39;s cousin posted to say that he had been killed in a traffic accident. Reactions ranged from distress to outright skepticism.<br><br>Yeah, UJ posted a few hours later to say that he wasn&#39;t dead. Turned out they&#39;d basically been tag-team trolling the Board for a month or so. &#39;Funny&#39;, no? (No.)<br><br>The other incident is <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=263803;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">the curious case of Boz4pm</a>, who apparently simultaneously vanished from the Board and the rest of the internet. Someone asked after her back in 2014, and a couple of us looked into it, but there&#39;s no trace of her. It&#39;s a weird case, because her best friend of the time was twitchy enough about the internet to ask for her username and any links relating to her to be removed from the Board. So she <i>might</i> have died (of swine flue, which was going round at the time and her last LJ post was about going to hospital because she had a cough - but it didn&#39;t exactly kill loads of people), or she might have just... up and quit. Who knows?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>To be fair I suppose it is hard to tell when someone you&#39;ve never spoken to outside a message board is dead vs when they&#39;ve just dropped off the radar. I have contingencies in place to make sure all my friends know if I bite the bullet, because I go way too long without contacting anyone sometimes. I guess I assumed other people would do similar: Have someone notify people, though I suppose the notifier has to know who to tell, and to be fair the board is not actually on my list. Mostly because I&#39;m friends with enough people who post, or used to post, here that I guess I assumed they would spread the news.<br><br>Sorry if this is uncomfortable for anyone, I just have been thinking along those lines a lot lately because apparently my brain enjoys morbidity in the intrusive thoughts.</p>

            <p>After reading Iximaz&#39;s comments, I got to thinking about him. One thing that I always wonder about the more stoic agents, especially ones from other continua, is what motivates them to do the job. Ajax&#39;s description says he does his best to keep the canons and characters safe, but there&#39;s nothing to suggest why.<br><br>Most agents, or at least the ones from World One, get involved because they&#39;ve read the books, seen the movies, etc., and are probably involved in fandom and know about badfic, too. They join up for love of canon; they put up with the weird and sometimes awful conditions of the job for love of canon.<br><br>But if you&#39;re not from World One or an analogue, you can&#39;t have grown up with these things and formed that kind of deep love for them, so what makes you care enough to put up with HQ? And if you don&#39;t appear to even be the kind of person who cares about anything at all, then what? What makes you keep doing it?<br><br>I&#39;ve answered this question for all of my agents:<br><br>- Nume cares because he was a geek when it was way less cool to be a geek. He always wanted <i>Star Trek</i> and LotR to be real, and when he found out they were, of course he was going to stick around. Screw your so-called real life.<br><br>- Ilraen didn&#39;t have a choice. He was recruited as a bit character with next to no personality, and he was basically told &quot;this is what you&#39;re going to be doing from now on, deal with it.&quot; At first he was only doing what he was told. Caring came later, when he saw some of the really terrible things badfic can do to other people.<br><br>- Derik has always been motivated by a duty to protect others as a dragonrider, and now he has a vendetta. A Mary Sue ruined his life, and he doesn&#39;t much care if he lives or dies as long as he gets to kill them in the process. Plus, as a harper, he&#39;s a stickler for proper speaking and writing.<br><br>- Gall is in it for the adventure. That&#39;s pretty much it. ... Okay, she doesn&#39;t like Sues, but she doesn&#39;t like anybody that inconveniences her. We&#39;re just lucky she respects her partner.<br><br>So, what about Ajax? Answering this question for him will do a world of good, I think.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>He also acts like a jerk on occasion, but he does his best to make sure the characters and canon remain safe. His reasoning behind this is that he doesn’t want to leave anyone or anything forgotten and left for dead like he once was.</p>

            <p>... a single sentence tacked onto the end of the existing profile. It&#39;s a start, but character development it ain&#39;t. I&#39;m afraid I find a couple of rather large holes in your logic.<br><br>1. He wasn&#39;t left for dead, just sold off. It might be emotionally scarring if he had an emotional attachment to his owner (a la Agent Gabrielle), but I&#39;m not clear on whether there actually was an owner in-game, since Ajax was his team&#39;s leader.<br><br>2. How does not wanting anyone to be left behind translate to &quot;Let&#39;s hunt some Sue&quot;? (And with a big scythe, at that.) Sues aren&#39;t typically in the business of buying and selling canon characters. Sues tend to cling to what they perceive as theirs.<br><br>3. Not directly related, but some more questions worth thinking about: How did he manage to survive solo for six months with only a &quot;rudimentary personality,&quot; having, I presume, known nothing but his simple monster-battling life previously? How did he react upon finding himself in HQ? How did he learn where he was? What made him decide to stay? How did he get stable and competent enough to handle missions at all, let alone on his own?<br><br>Food for thought. Anyway, I wasn&#39;t looking for an answer right now. I will, however, be looking for a more developed motivation grounded in his backstory and personality in your next request.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Is for him to be a bit more disillusioned when he comes into HQ with the aforementioned &quot;rudimentary personality&quot; and then come across the legends of his namesake; Ajax the Great, hero of Athens, bulwark of the Greeks. Strong and fearless, wielding a mighty shield and spear... that&#39;s the kind of thing that might appeal to him. If you&#39;re going to have a character, you might as well be a hero.</p>

            <p>*takes a look*<br><br><b>SPaG:</b> Looked fine in the prompts, but needs to be cleaned up in the profiles; you had a few mistakes like not capitalizing Sues or capitalizing white out. Otherwise, green light here.<br><br><b>PPC Knowledge:</b> Why does Matthew like to use C-CADs as grendes? They&#39;re known for being much more resilient to badfic than their non-combined counterparts. Why does their console play JohnTron singing for its alert? Valon and Kala&#39;s console plays a different noise (Something from <i>Psycho</i>, I think?) but the reason for that was given an explanation. Here, it&#39;s just... a thing. Other than that, I haven&#39;t really spotted anything. So you get a tentative green light with this, but be more mindful of that in the future, please.<br><br><b>Badfic:</b> *takes a look and nopes out* You&#39;re good here.<br><br><b>Agents:</b> Okay. Where do I start... how about Ajax.<br><br>&quot;Ajax doesn’t quite look like it, but he is a badass. The sues he has slain certainly know this, given in his solo mission he wore a cloak and wielded a scythe upon execution of said sues.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m... honestly not sure if you&#39;re trying to write a parody here. First off, the fact that you feel the need to tell us your agent is a badass sends up a red flag, because we&#39;re supposed to take your word at face value rather than let him demonstrate his badassery for himself. Not only that, but the main focus on him as a character seems to be less on his personality and more on &#39;look at what cool powers and stuff he has!&#39; His character seems to begin and end with &#39;badass&#39;<br><br>Matthew is a lot better developed (I&#39;m guessing because he sounds like he&#39;s supposed to represent you?), so not really a whole lot to say on him other than good job here. I would like to point out that &quot;Matthew has severe ADHD; reading about how Sues screw over his favorite characters doesn’t help.&quot; kind of makes me tilt my head and go &#39;huh?&#39; because, speaking as someone who does have ADHD, I seriously cannot see the correlation between these two.<br><br><b>Prompts:</b> &quot;Stuck in a Tree&quot; was... odd. The fact that Matthew got stuck in a tree for apparently no reason (and this is even acknowledged in the story itself!) and feels like it was just Ajax doing random things because... reasons. I&#39;ve read it three times and I still can&#39;t figure out what was going on with it.<br><br>The second prompt was alright, though the console thing was still strange.<br><br>One last note: the format on your agents&#39; profile pages made reading about them way more difficult than it had to be, needing to scroll up and down and up and down just to read about them. I still can&#39;t figure out what &quot;DetBdaJhg&quot; and &quot;KniHamSav&quot; are even supposed to be. Yes, you left a footnote saying it was a reference to the Periodic Table of Storytelling, but that still tells me diddly squat.<br><br>So, sorry, but Permission is denied.<br><br>Some final thoughts: Ajax is what really killed this for me. Put a lot more work into developing him and I think your next shot will be better.</p>

            <p>*squeezes through all the important people and the Hatters* Excuse me, excuse me...<br><br>From what I&#39;ve seen, this Periodic Table takes you to different Tropes. One for the main trait of the character, and two secondary traits.

            <p>*blows dust of PG Hat* *tests* Huh. Seems okay. Right then!<br><br>Notes taken as I read:<br><br><b>Agent Profiles</b><br><br>- RC# G37-R3K7-M8<br><br>Erm, the 1337 is mildly amusing, but RCs have to be numbers. They can CONTAIN letters, but they really ought to start off with numbers. The agents can always put up a sign that says &quot;get rekt mate&quot; in 1337 if they want to, though.<br><br>- <i>But as he kept walking and the blizzard started clearing up he noticed that he wasn’t in the same town he grew up in. Apparently the snowstorm had spawned a plothole that led straight to Upstairs.</i><br><br>This line reads a little funny to me, mostly because &quot;not in the same town&quot; seems to imply &quot;in a different town,&quot; and Upstairs isn&#39;t a town at all.<br><br>- <i>severe ADHD</i><br><br>Urgh, this rarely bodes well. I get that Matthew is a self-insert, but I fear Random Wacky Shenanigans For No Reason.<br><br>- <i>Also, DoSAT is seriously considering blacklisting him for his habit of using C-CADs as grenades.</i><br><br>You know that C-CADs were specifically designed to explode LESS than regular CADs, right?<br><br>- <i>Ajax is a Psychopomp Commerce Deity, Hermes, a Water/Dark attribute God/Attacker type monster from the Puzzle &amp; Dragons series.</i><br><br>That is sure a lot of descriptors. From reading on, though, do I take it that he&#39;s not actually a version of the god, Hermes?<br><br>- Dat RC. When most agents are stuck in what&#39;s essentially a dorm room, how in the heck do these guys rate enough space for FOUR game tables, not to mention what looks like a full kitchen? O.o<br><br><b>Control Prompt</b><br><br>- <i>RC G37-R3K7-M8 was about the size of a classroom</i><br><br>Again, how? Why?<br><br>- <i>“LET’S GOOOO!” He ran towards where the portal was…but promptly ran into the wall, as the portal hadn’t actually generated yet. “Ow.”</i><br><br>And there&#39;s the Random Wacky Shenanigans I feared. Serious question: have you ever actually run into a wall?<br><br><b>Random Prompt</b><br><br>You lost me when the tree spouted a geyser. So, Matt&#39;s stuck in a tree, and Ajax turns the inside of the tree into water and gets inside it, and then the tree explodes, and... what? Is Ajax where Matt is now, or is he still lower down? I guess he has to be on Matt&#39;s level, or else the water slide would be no help, but there&#39;s no description, so it took me way too long to figure that out.<br><br>Also, random caps on baby elephant.<br><br><b>Analysis</b><br><br>Your writing is basically okay—a few minor errors here and there, but nothing practice won&#39;t fix—and I don&#39;t see anything awfully concerning about the characters as written, as long as the Random Wacky Shenanigans For No Reason are kept to a minimum.<br><br>What concerns me, however, is your level of PPC knowledge. I think you ought to read some more missions, preferably some of the older ones that helped establish HQ and particularly the story that introduced the C-CAD. Then, once the errors are fixed, try again.<br><br>Therefore, Permission Denied for Now.<br><br>~Neshomeh </p>

            <p>Does the PPC have a training hall of some kind? Seeing as agents from continua that don&#39;t have things like guns or lightsabers would need to get training in order to know how to properly use them, it seems like something that should have been mentioned by now. Or do agents just portal to different continua and train there?<br>Honestly, all that would really be needed would be a big empty room and a speaker system of some sort to play appopriate training-montage music. Heck, why not just use training montages to train agents in different weapon use? It would fit with the PPC&#39;s theme.<br><br>Also, I have another question: is it possible for agents to visit various continua when not on missions? I could see an agent from the Pokemon continuum visiting his/her family, or maybe a couple of agents going to the Monster Hunter continuum to test out Sue weaponry, or to Remnant to restock the Armoury&#39;s supply of Dust, or even just trips to the Subnautica continuum to relax. As long as the agents don&#39;t mess with the canon itself, it seems like something that people would do.</p>

I&#39;m vaguely aiming for 150+, so if people want to throw out card ideas - monsters, curses, and equippable items are the big things - I&#39;ll cheerfully take them.

            <p>... make them generic. A Level 10 Character Replacement (Suvian) card which you slap Legendary and Overpowered modifiers on seems like more fun to say &#39;Hey, it&#39;s Rose Potter!&#39; about than, well, a card that says &#39;Rose Potter&#39;.

            <p>Of course, in Munchkin, you&#39;ve got your races and classes cards, right? And yes, I&#39;m well aware that these need some serious balancing.<br><br><u>Races</u><br>Hobbit: Whenever you want to run away, you can reroll the die. You must use the second roll, even if it&#39;s lower than the first. <br><br>Yeerk: Once each time after you gain a level, you can control another player to assist you in a fight.<br><br>Dalek: You can only assist other players of the Dalek Race, but you both go up a level afterward if you win the encounter.<br><br>Dwarf: Monsters with the Sue keyword automatically are repulsed by you.

            <p>Back when I made the <a href="http://bonsaimallorn.webs.com/CardGame.htm">PPC Card Game</a>, I started by giving every card an individualised race and canon. That&#39;s led to the current rules needing a table of conversions for the races, and as for the fandoms - eesh! We have cards specifically for <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> in there, how did we think <i>that</i> was going to work?<br><br>What you&#39;ve got here is a perfect excuse for people to list every species they can think of. How often do <i>you</i> draw a Race in Munchkin? Exactly.<br><br>If I were making PPC Munchkin (haha, &#39;if&#39;), I&#39;d ignore the &#39;race&#39; and &#39;class&#39; descriptions. I&#39;d go with something like the following:<br><br><u>Fandom</u><br><br><b>Fantasy:</b> Don&#39;t have an idea for the bonus. Something to do with magic attacks?<br><br><b>Sci-Fi:</b> After stepping through the portal (== kicking down the door), if you don&#39;t like the first Portal card you draw, you may discard three cards to discard it and turn over a new one.<br><br><b>Anime:</b> Maybe do something with transformations, not sure.<br><br><b>Video Game:</b> Carry (and use) as many Big items as you like - because you have an arbitrarily-large inventory.<br><br><u>Department</u><br><br>Pretty much your Classes, but renamed to be literally &#39;DMS&#39;, &#39;DBS&#39;,&#39;Floaters&#39;, and &#39;DIC&#39;. I&#39;d probably make the DIC bonus based on being in a battle involving an <i>agent</i> from a different fandom, but that&#39;s all fiddly details.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You could do something a bit like Grand Central Arena. Like, in the far future, the human race (through the power of Science!!!) finally achieves immortality, and this does not go unnoticed. The entity known as Death sends out its minions to swarm a human colony at the outer reaches of their empire, and this too does not go unnoticed; a mass of immortal warriors armed with swords and staffs and at least one actual <i>magic wand</i> fend off the attack, and welcome the humans into the secret world of the Immortal Kin...<br><br>Who then promptly view them with a mixture of distrust and genuine dread when they realise the humans weren&#39;t <i>born</i> immortal, that instead of their gift coming from just how magical or mystical or just plain special they were, their new friends had to grind out their immortality and basically backdoor the system into getting what they wanted. The Spectres of Death still haunt the universe, but it&#39;s up to humans to prove their worth to the Immortal Kin and keep hunting them... but can science succeed where magic cannot?</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this question for a while, and I thought I&#39;d pose it to you guys... If the PPC were an actual thing in entertainment media, who would be your ideal choices for actors or voice actors for your agents? Additional question: given the &quot;whitewashing&quot; problem in a number of recent movies, do you think you can find an ideal match for the character in terms of ethnicity, appearance, etc.? Also, for each selection, what previous roles from existing media influenced your choice?<br><br>For the sake of simplicity, agents who were formerly character replacements and such will likely use the same actors/voice actors as the canon characters, so those don&#39;t have to be listed.<br><br>Added challenge: For self-insert characters, don&#39;t pick yourself, but find an actor or actress whom you think would be perfect for playing as you if your life story were made into a movie.<br><br>I&#39;ll start with my agents, or the ones who aren&#39;t replacements anyway. <br>- I always thought that if I couldn&#39;t get to voice/play as Falchion, he&#39;d be played/voiced by Ryan Potter, whose role as Hiro Hamada from <i>Big Hero 6</i> was my biggest justification here. I know he&#39;s Japanese/American, and not Indonesian like I am, but LOOK AT HIM! <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a0/70/f0/a070f05ca2f2087080d79f5c6e94f874.jpg">He&#39;s beautiful.</a><br>- Rashida would be voiced/played by Halle Berry, who is African American and has most recently starred in the CBS series <i>Extant</i> (her fiercely protective role as Molly Woods in that show fits well with Rashida&#39;s behavior; just make her more aggressive and irritable and there you go).<br>- Ripper, being partly derived from Light Yagami, would be voiced by Brad Swaile (as, of course, Light Yagami; I imagine Ripper would remain in anime cartoon style when disguised as a person).<br>- I&#39;ve always imagined Sarah would be voiced by Ashleigh Ball, in no small part inspired by Rainbow Dash from <i>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</i>. Sarah&#39;s voice would likely have less of a rasp, but would still sound just as tomboyish.<br>- Lapis is also voiced by another MLP voice actor, this time Andrea Libman and sounding like something midway between Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie. Flutter&#39;s timidness combined with Pinkie&#39;s excitability (and a deeper sense of insecurity than Pinkie herself).<br>- Speaking of MLP, after seeing and hearing Cody Maverick in <i>Surf&#39;s Up</i>, I&#39;ve always thought Rayner deserves to be voiced by none other than <s>actual cannibal</s> Shia LeBeouf. That role just matches Rayner&#39;s determination and aggression so well. <s>No, Shia&#39;s appearances in those god-awful Transformers movies don&#39;t count.</s><br>- E.V.L. having a British accent would basically make her a younger-looking Keira Knightley (assuming you can get away with that with enough makeup). My experience with her is primarily as Elizabeth Swann from PoTC, but I&#39;m sure her acting diversity would allow her to play an &quot;evil&quot; character quite easily. (I&#39;d personally have her speak in a deeper and more villainous tone when playing as E.V.L.)</p>

            <p>For Nume, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0648486/">Timothy Omundson</a>, whom you may remember as Carlton Lassiter in <i>Psych</i>. Heck, I&#39;d cast him to straight-up play Nume. He&#39;s great.<br><br>Ilraen is difficult because I imagine his voice (spoken and telepathic) as very clean and cool, and there aren&#39;t too many voices like that. Best I can do is John Webb, who voice-acted as Glorfindel in the 1981 BBC radio dramatization of LotR. You can hear him <a href="https://youtu.be/nUFtvFUCqQs?t=23m32s">here, starting at about 23:32</a>. (I remember his voice as being a little higher-pitched than it sounds to me now, but maybe that was my stereo as a kid.) Unfortunately, I can&#39;t find a page for him, so I don&#39;t even know if he&#39;s around anymore.<br><br>Derik&#39;s speaking voice would, of course, have to be played by Gerard Butler. I imagine his singing voice differently, though, and I haven&#39;t quite figured out a good model for that. Maybe Doug LaBrecque, though—here&#39;s a nice recording of him singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXysvLaV4co">&quot;Do You Hear What I Hear?&quot;</a>, which shows off his velvety low resonance. His high end can be a bit shrill/harsh when he&#39;s belting, though, and I don&#39;t approve of his swooping in this recording. {= P<br><br>I haven&#39;t quite figured Gall out yet. In my head, she mostly sounds like a weird combination of Ruffnut and Snotlout from HtTYD, but that clearly doesn&#39;t work. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Wiig">Kristen Wiig</a> is cool, though, so sure, I&#39;ll run with it for now.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I got into your missions rather later than might be expected, mostly because, well... I didn&#39;t really give them much thought at first and later dismissed them out of hand during my brief but embarrassing &quot;OLDBIES ARE OUT TO GET US AAAAAAAALL!!!11ONEONEELEVEN&quot; phase. However, when I did start reading them properly, one voice immediately jammed itself into my head for Ilraen:<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Ox50i182c">The Narrator from <i>Darkest Dungeon</i></a>, played by Wayne June.

            <p>The key difference is that you think Andalites are inherently creepy, whereas I don&#39;t. Wayne June&#39;s low, growly voice is definitely suited for creepiness, but not for someone as innocent (at least to start with) and goodhearted as Ilraen. {= )<br><br>The echo effect in the videos would be good for representing telepathy, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>For Stephanie, I would recommend Kristanna Loken, a.k.a. T-X from Terminator 3, who is of German and Norwegian ancestry. She doesn&#39;t have much of a speaking role there, though, so the only other role I can point to is probably Rayne from the awful 2005 film adaptation of BloodRayne (which I haven&#39;t seen), and there&#39;s no way that would suit Steph&#39;s friendly and pacifistic nature.<br><br>As for Gabby, I would suggest Ruth Bradley, a.k.a.

            <p>Scandi-noir is a big thing in both my country and my parents&#39; house, so I get quite a lot of exposure to actors from that part of the world. Therefore, for Stephanie, I would suggest <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0375138/">Sofia Helin</a> from The Bridge.

            <p>They&#39;re all have to be voice credits, since there&#39;s no way to put a cartoon unicorn in with real people and not have it look weird. <br><br>1. Chris has two possible voice actors. If he were portrayed as white because that&#39;s how the Pokemon main characters are drawn, Aaron Dismuke. Remember how adorable he was as Al in the 2003 FMA series? Well, he&#39;s three years older than I am now, and (admittedly having not heard his recent work) I think he could nail Chris&#39; &quot;adult who&#39;s still a kid in his mind and heart&quot; shtick. <br>--If, on the other hand, he were portrayed as Japanese because that&#39;s what country most of the Pokemon regions are based on, my best guess is Daisuke Namikawa. He voiced Yu Narukami in P4 and all its adaptations, and since Chris is the serious one... (did you know he&#39;s also Lucario&#39;s voice in Brawl and Smash 4?) I&#39;m not actually sure if Mr. Namikawa knows English, so if anyone knows a Japanese voice actor who does, tell me.<br>2. If I couldn&#39;t voice Ami, Tara Strong would. I&#39;ve said before that I identify with Twilight Sparkle the most out of the mane 6, and some of that spilled over into Ami&#39;s personality as well. (Or will once she gets more character development, anyway.)<br>3. Miguel...actually, I don&#39;t know that many young Black men in voice acting. Maybe Michael B. Jordan? Lord knows he needs a career revival after the disaster that was the new Fantastic 4 movie.<br>4. Violet&#39;s the quote-unquote &quot;feisty one&quot; in the RC, so Michaela Dietz (Amethyst) would make the most sense as her voice actor. Purple, loud, violent, enjoys messing with people, and ashamed of where she came from deep down inside.</p>

            <p>Mind you ,the names will be likely unknow to most of you as I mainly have Italian voice actors in mind.<br><br><br>Agent!Sergio: Uhm, I don&#39;t know. it&#39;s more like I know how it should sound like (nothing like mine, by the way), but I can&#39;t think of a voice actor with a similar voice. Maybe Kappei Yamaguchi, with a bit of David Hayter mixed in?<br>Nikki: Renata Bertolas. The full reason is a bit spoilery, but she&#39;s the voice actress of Sakura Kinomoto (the character she&#39;s a badfic clone of) in the Italian dub of Cardcaptor Sakura. Bonus points for the Italian dub trying to pass off Sakura as a 14 years old girl resulting in her Italian voice sounding more like a girl Nikki&#39;s age than a kid.<br>Corolla: Probably Yukana, as she already voices one of the canonical Unison Devices. Imagine a crazier version of Reinforce Zwei and you&#39;re on the right way.<br><br>... And yes, I know I gave the Italian character a Japanese voice actor and vice versa.</p>

            <p>Things could get a little tricky. Oh well, here goes nothing. All these are voice credits unless stated:-<br><br><font color="#9942f0">Wobbles The Clown:</font> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2313103/">Rebel Wilson</a><br>A natural fit for a physical presence, with an established gift for comedy delivery, Wilson is perfect for a happy-go-lucky clown. For those wondering, Melissa McCarthy&#39;s voice isn&#39;t really right for the part, though she has the advantage of actually being an American.<br><br><font color="#515138">The Notary:</font> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0025458/">Nikki Amuka-Bird</a><br>Amuka-Bird&#39;s delivery is perfect for a role as dry and vicious as the Notary, and she has a Whovian credit already; a one-episode role in <i>Torchwood</i>. However, what really got my attention was her work in <i>Luther</i> as Erin Gray. A close runner up is Adjoa Andoh, of <i>Invictus</i> and (more pertinetly to the topic at hand) <i>Thunderbirds Are Go!</i> fame.<br><br><font color="#ff4dff">Doktor Trollenfisch:</font> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2634569/">Henning Wehn</a><br>Considering he&#39;s got a lot of experience with radio work <i>and</i> was in large part an inspiration for the character, it&#39;s only right that he gets the part in my fan casting. Whether or not he can play the sousaphone remains to be seen; we might have to get a stunt double in for that. =]<br><br><font color="#007300">Algernon, 7th Earl Wymbourne:</font> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0341743/">Richard Griffiths</a><br>Well, this is a dream casting. Griffiths was a Shakespearean actor, and I wanted his plummy tones (most familiar to American Boarders coming out of Vernon Dursley in the <i>Harry Potter</i> films) but with a certain gaiety of spirit to lighten a performance for the irrepressible Lord Wymbourne. Another fine pick would be Nicholas Smith, who did voice work in <i>Wallace And Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</i> before his own death.<br><br><font color="#3939e6">Lola McCandless:</font> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0204583/?ref_=tt_cl_t1">Essie Davis</a><br>Davis has rocketed to international acclaim on the back of the best horror film in recent years, Jennifer Kent&#39;s <i>The Babadook</i>. If anyone can pull off the kind of barely-held-together with false joviality performance that Lola requires, it&#39;s the lead from a psychological horror that scared the Bejeezus out of William Friedkin, whom you may know as the man behind <i>The Exorcist</i>.<br><br>I hope that&#39;s of use to people. =]</p>

            <p>I&#39;m... really sorry to say this, but this whole mission was just riddled with errors. A lot of them. Distractingly so, to the point where I was noticing them more than I was the story.<br><br><i>The songs had also helped him navigate: HQ’s dimension-bending architecture required everyone to distract themselves somehow in order to get to where they needed to be.</i><br><br>Colon needs to be a semicolon.<br><br><i>The Response Centre was rather empty, with no other furniture besides another bed next to a door in the back of the room, two chairs, and another door on the left side, although a kitchen was also located besides this second door.</i><br><br>Besides should be beside.<br><br><i>“Let me enter, please. I’ve been walking around this damn place for hours, in fact ever since this flower with a bowler hat sent me out after I dropped into his office, and even before this my day wasn’t exactly wonderful, so I really need the rest.”</i><br><br>Run-on sentence. The comma after &#39;hours&#39; should probably be changed to an em dash, and there needs to be a comma after &#39;in fact&#39;.<br><br><i>Anyway, we’re somewhere in the labyrinth known as PPC HQ--that’s short for Protectors of the Plot Continuum.</i><br><br>You were using em dashes earlier in the mission, so the double hyphen should be replaced.<br><br><i>Richard stood up at his turn, clutching his side.</i><br><br>Are they suddenly in an RPG?<br><br><i>I heard one agent got genderbent on a</i> really <i>nasty</i> Harry Potter <i>mission,”</i><br><br>Harry Potter here needs to be italicized since you&#39;re referring to the series.<br><br><i>He then dragged Marina, who’d been staring at Dresden pointedly, out of the way and out of sight of the canon characters before (seemingly) dozing off.</i><br><br>Er, what? I assume he&#39;s reading the Words, given the later context clues, but then it says he&#39;s reading them by letting his eyes glaze over, so I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on here.<br><br><i>While we’re in a badfic, if we let our eyes unfocus, we’ll be able to read the Words of the story itself.</i><br><br>How the agents read the Words varies; Barid, for example, hits himself over the head to see them; I&#39;ve seen other examples like shutting your eyes or taking off your glasses to see them. This would be a case of PPC knowledge failure.<br><br><i>Why do half of these guys look like corpses, and will you stop sleeping- What is making that noise?</i><br><br>Hyphen needs to be an em dash for consistency.<br><br><i>You’re from this verse, aren’t you?</i><br><br>Verse should be &#39;verse, since it&#39;s an abbreviation of universe.<br><br><i>Karen here is the first Dresden Files mini</i><br><br>The first ever?

As an apology, I can recommend you some Betas that saved me multiple times, and I can always trust them:<br><br>- Hieronymous Graubart, hands down the most experienced Beta on the Board; I think nobody is gonna argue that our resident Greybeard is one of the best.<br><br>- The Irish Samurai. I haven&#39;t heard from him for a while now, but his ideas and suggestions are really helpful, and I really enjoyed working with him.<br><br>- Tira, whom you already know, since she helped with your Permission prompts<br><br>- SMF, very similar to Tira, very helpful and incredibly nice.</p>

            <p>However, a few things:<br><br>1) To be very honest, it&#39;s extremely unlikely that anyone would take such an interest in whatever your ideas are that they&#39;d try to steal <i>yours</i>. To put in perspective: there are dozens upon dozens of novels set in a version of the 1800s where magic, or things we generally associate with the like, exists, ranging from the Regency era to the Victorian. They are all, despite this, very different. The Parasol Protectorate series is different from the Sorcery and &amp; Cecelia books which are in turn different from Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell which is different from the Temeraire series. And these are just the ones I can think of right now, having had no sleep. I&#39;m sure others on the board can chime in with more if they felt like it.<br><br>2) For two, I&#39;m not saying you have to write a crossover between the PPC and said home universe (though it is something I&#39;ve been considering doing with Library), but that you just need to give enough information when introducing said character and while writing to <i>justify</i> anything going on- otherwise it is a very simple way of going &quot;well you see in my universe they can...&quot; without actually telling us anything to show it&#39;s actually the case. Pulling characters from any universe sets that as their background, and informs us of their potential abilities and limits- agents from World One, like Nume, for example, they aren&#39;t going to be starting off with any sort of weirdness because they&#39;re normal baseline humans. When we&#39;re told a character is a Harry Potter &#39;verse wizard, that immediately tells us what we can expect from them and the author. We don&#39;t know that when it&#39;s an original &#39;verse. The responsibility falls on you to tell us. <br><br>3) I had something to put here but like I said, I&#39;m terribly sleep deprived but I started this number so I have to put something here now. So. Fish. <br><br>4) Oh, right, now I remember. When in doubt: Read more spin-offs. Look at the wiki. Those can usually answer your questions.<br><br>-July, in an altered state of consciousness</p>

            <p>In the US, generally a work is copyrighted the second an original work is fixed in a permanent medium.  The problem is enforcement, if it is not registered with the appropriate office, then it will be hard to prove that your copyright is enforceable as to a potential infringer.<br><br>Basically the infringer needs to know that a work is copyrighted, that is why one is required to file with a copyright office.  If you put your own copyright notice on your work, you will have a better argument that it is an enforceable copyright.  But if you provide no notice to potential infringers and it is not recorded/registered you will not be able to enforce it.  If you put your own copyright on it, you might be able to get it enforced.<br><br>I hope that explains it a bit better, though I admit I may not be particularly clear.</p>

Black, white, red, blue, and yellow feathers.<br>Species: Fenghuang<br>Gender: Huang (Female)<br>Universe: I haven’t fully created it yet…<br>Personality: Highly curious about species of mythological creatures from other universes as her world is populated only by mythical things. A bit wary of works that have creatures that are entirely good or entirely evil depending on their species (such as Redwall and Lord of the Rings) due to a historical event in her world concerning a republic that had the same mentality. Might have trouble thinking of Mary-Sues as being completely evil. Perhaps should be told that Mary-Sues are to Original Characters what criminals are to ordinary folk.<br>Ability: Flight and sings songs to create facsimiles of people, creatures or even locations which will behave in accordance to their originals’ personalities. For example, “It Doesn’t Matter” will create a reproduction of Sonic the Hedgehog that will strive to protect the innocent and defeat evil. Norinj can even manipulate nearby instruments to play. The summoned can’t affect those who can’t hear them. (Will they work on inanimate objects?)<br>Misc.: How did she get the ability to sing magically? She swallowed a rock that she wasn’t aware had special properties for her gizzard.<br><br>I&#39;m willing to tweak it. Advice and thoughts please!</p>

            <p>I remarked tha the Wiki don&#39;t have a page for Avatar&#39;s minis, although it was stated by Voyd there was six kinds of minis during the mission where him and DawnFire nuked a Suvian Bella. <br><br>Did they ever spoke about a list about them? Wit all of the Avatar missions we&#39;re seeing,I guess it could be pretty neat of knowing what are these minis.</p>

            <p>...I may make a page listing the different types of Avatar minis, their canon origins, and all instances of each found in published missions. That way, people can view a relatively complete list of Avatar minis in case they want to adopt one.<br><br>Though that may have to wait until my next mission, which btw will concern AtLA/LoK, is finished and published.

            <p>I am not very good at starting posts, so I am going to jump straight in with a question.<br><br>How do you go about finishing stories? Or, I suppose I should correct myself, how do you not stop fifty words into every new idea?<br><br>I have fancied myself a writer since middle school, but aside from the assignment that got me interested in the craft and the odd bit of fluff I managed to eke over the years (mostly other assignments), I have precious little to show for it. I am not want for ideas. Every time I open a Notepad or pick up a pencil a torrent of the things stream distractingly through my brain. I just can not seem to put the words down. <br><br>This has been the case for everything I try to write, whether it be fanfics, my own original works or the various spinoffs I have been working on since joining a few years ago.<br><br>Does anyone else have this problem? And, for those of you who are productive writers, how do you get past your own mental blockages and let the words flow?</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for responding. I see that blocking out outlines and writing non-linearly are both common procedures among you, so I will try putting those into practice and see how it works out for me. Failing that, I&#39;ll just buckle down and power through a page or two and see what I turn up.<br><br>Thank you all again.

            <p>It doesn&#39;t even have to be big and complicated; it can be as simple as writing down the beginning, the end and three things that have to happen in between.<br><br>You can also write small pieces with your characters, giving you a better feel for who they are and what makes them tick. Or, if you&#39;re writing some kind of fantasy of sci-fi, you can do short, lexicon style articles about elements of your world.<br><br>The blank paper (or screen) is scary but if you come prepared, if you have some idea about who your characters are and what they&#39;re going to do in the story, it will be easier to start.<br><br>And in my experience, writing tend to generate more writing. Start putting ideas on the paper and you will get more ideas and the story will grow bigger and take off in unexpected directions.</p>

            <p>Option one:  The power method.  Just power through it. just keep putting words on paper when you hit the wall.  Though this can result in a stream of consciousness style work<br><br>Option Two:  Inspiration.  Writing, like painting or sculpture or any other kind of art needs some type of muse or source of inspiration.  For me it is usually music of some type.  It will usually set me in the mood to work.<br><br>Option Three:  Let your subconscious do the work for you.  I believe that all fiction springs from the writer&#39;s subconscious mind, so one way to get through the block is to let your subconscious effectively take over.  Now this is more about training your brain to be more effective, which I can only tell you what works for me.  As far as the subconscious goes, what I do is I write tired if I am struggling.  For me that gives my waking mind more access to my subconscious and the wellspring of my personal writing.  Of course by doing it this way, I need massive editing to ensure that it is coherent, but it does get me over the hump so to speak.  <br><br>Now a full plot outline is something many writers use.  That may be worth considering, but do not feel obligated to use something so formulaic.  What I like to do is have a vague plot and characters, then I write in the moment, which is not that dissimilar to the way Stephen King writes, which brings me to the last piece of advice.  First if you do not have it, I highly recommend acquiring a copy of Stephen King&#39;s <i>On Writing </i>.  I am not sure there is a better book for the actual craft of writing than that.  And a part of his advice is to read.  If you read many things and expose yourself to many genres that can provide some much needed inspiration.  But what I mean by reading, I mean branching out from your comfortable or preferred genres.  For example if LotR or Harry Potter are your preferred types of stories read some Herman Melville or John Le Carre or Doyle.  Branch out.  It might provide that spark to get you through.</p>

            <p>Think about how the story starts (e.g. where the characters would be in terms of personality and character), and where the story ends. Then work from both ends and meet in the middle. I always find this much easier to work with than just writing linearly, which for me tends to result in less interesting PPC missions and other writing works along with more writers&#39; block and such.<br><br>Another suggestion: If you don&#39;t know what to do next with your story, improvise! More specifically, try a reasonably random change in events and see how it would affect the characters and progress the story. The less expected an event may be to you, the more engaging the resultant writing may be.</p>

            <p>...except the only problem is, I don&#39;t really know if I have any to give. I just love writing. It&#39;s what I do for fun, it&#39;s my main source of entertainment, and it&#39;s what I hope to do for a living in the future. I write because it lets me get away from this crappy little corner of the planet I call home. I don&#39;t really know how helpful &#39;just have fun&#39; is. :/<br><br>Of course, there are times you have to just grit your teeth and power through a speed bump. Sometimes I jump ahead in the story and write a little bit for a later scene; the scene might not end up getting used because it no longer fits once I go back to connect the dots, but it helps spark new ideas and keep the machine running.<br><br>But, when I do happen to get writer&#39;s block, what I do is take a break. I go get a snack, play a bit of WoW or <i>Minecraft</i>, or derp around on TV Tropes. Watch MLP or <i>Doctor Who</i>. Daydream about the future. When I come back I&#39;m able to get back into the flow pretty easily and finish whatever I&#39;m working on.<br></p>

            <p><i>I dropped it into the vat. It dumped them in a flashback.</i><br><br>Why are these two phrases different? Because I agree that they are. It seems to be something about the verb:<br><br><i>I dumped it in the vat. It dropped them into a flashback.</i><br><br>But I can&#39;t see any actual difference in the verbs. What if we pick a few others?<br><br><i>I kicked it into the vat. It kicked them into a flashback.</i><br><br><i>I emptied it into the vat. It emptied them into a flashback.</i> (Er, yuck.)<br><br><i>I deposited it in the vat. It deposited them in a flashback.</i><br><br><i>I placed it in the vat. It placed them in a flashback.</i><br><br><i>I left it in the vat. It left them in a flashback.</i><br><br>I think that last one is most telling. The others you can argue I&#39;m doing wrong, but &#39;left&#39; <i>can&#39;t</i> take &#39;into&#39;. It&#39;s... something about the fact that you&#39;re describing their final state, rather than the action that&#39;s putting them there. There&#39;s a really subtle distinction here, and I don&#39;t have the words to draw it out. Anyone?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... is that there is a difference between being <b>in</b> some place, moving <b>into</b> some place, and moving <b>in</b> a certain direction. What I didn’t learn or don’t remember is the correct use of passive voice (I’m not even sure about the terminology), and time travel makes everything more complex, because the past or future isn’t exactly a location. Personally, I wouldn’t treat being dropped in(to) a flashback differently from falling into a plothole, but I may be wrong.<br><br>HG<br></p>

            <p>Take it from someone who has been doing this for over 16 years, and has worked with some of the greats and even got a Shadowrun mission published: GMing is <i>hard</i>. Like, I&#39;ve run six campaigns in the last four years, and three fell apart due to a lack of ideas. (Two are currently running, and the first ran for two whole years before everyone finally decided we wanted to do something else.) That said, here are some tips:<br>*Draw from your setting&#39;s established lore. If your setting is homebrew you&#39;ve got a bit of work cut out for you, but don&#39;t ever be afraid to borrow from other settings. I once ran a Dragonlance game that involved an evil wizard who fled into space using a magical airship called a Spelljammer that I stole from another D&amp;D setting.<br>*Get your players to give you ideas, but be subtle about it. Ask what some of their favorite fantasy tropes are, or what they&#39;d be interested in the future. Have them come up with npcs their characters know, who you can then use to draw them into the story.<br>*Don&#39;t be afraid to make up utter nonsense on the fly, especially if the players are going in an unexpected direction. If it was good enough for Gygax it&#39;s good enough for you.<br>*Never involve flumphs, your players will hate you.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s very hard. Thankfully, I&#39;m the first DM my players have ever had, so hopefully they don&#39;t know how bad I am. <br><br>Yeah, it&#39;s a homebrew: I actually planned on running published adventures until I felt prepared (ha, what a funny conception of DMing I had) enough to start my own campaign, but Stuff Happened. I ran a little test scenario at the table after we finished creating our characters, to take &#39;em for a spin-- nothing much, just a tiny bit of RP and some goblins attacking the town they were in. Then I went overboard at the end, and the village elder hired the party to clear out a nearby island to stop the attacks, and the homebrew just... happened. Now I&#39;m semi-retrofitting the world according to what my players have done and also creating the story. Not exactly ideal, but it could be worse. Are there any settings you recommend? I&#39;m ridiculously new to all of this, so I know nothing. Literally nothing. I should really get a D&amp;D magazine subscription or something...<br><br>I&#39;ll bring up the second tip next session: the PCs don&#39;t seem very well connected with the story. I think that&#39;ll help.<br><br>Unexpected nonsense is my specialty. =] <br><br>Er, what&#39;s a flumph?<br><br>Thank you very much for all the advice! I certainly need it.<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>You could have a plot prompt, like &quot;A dragon soars overhead, burning a village&quot; or &quot;You randomly get frozen by an ice wizard and thaw out five years later, in a different world&quot; sort of thing.

            <p>I&#39;m a big fan of <i>Civilization V</i> and I&#39;ve always been interested in the kinds of mods people can create for it. It&#39;s admittedly a distant interest as using those mods is, unfortunately, not within my capability (I&#39;ve never been able to get mods for the Steam version of <i>Civ V</i> to work on my Apple machine). I especially like how you&#39;ve integrated your mods with multiple others. Seeing more diverse civilizations is also always a major plus.<br><br>My one nitpick (&#39;cause I wouldn&#39;t be me if I didn&#39;t nitpick something) is that Rwanda seems a bit overpowered with its Inyangamugayo and Abiiru. Three gold per turn is admittedly a lot of maintenance, but that seems worth it for the happiness bonus alone. And getting 10 percent to a random yield in the capitol seems like it could unbalance the late-game (once you&#39;ve run out of things to spend religious points on and depending on how many you get). But that might just be me. Good job all around, though.</p>

            <p>The Inyangamuagyo is a Courthouse replacement; normally they&#39;re impossible to build in your own cities, so it&#39;s a lot more production time spent midgame to get the most out of it unless you take a very specific (and in its own way suboptimal) build order. As for the Abiiru, the bonuses are additive, not multiplicative, so if you luck out and get five Science boosts in a row, it, er, gives you the equivalent of a National College or Observatory. At considerably more cost. And it&#39;s dependent on you getting a Great Prophet, which is by no means a sure thing on Deity.<br><br>However, if you want to get the mods and do a bit of testing (there are a couple of bugs that people are finding, I can&#39;t fix them because I don&#39;t code), there are links to the direct downloads from Dropbox for each Civ on its Steam Workshop page. Those <i>should</i> work on a Mac, but I wouldn&#39;t know, I haven&#39;t used one since I was in primary school. =]</p>

            <p>It&#39;s always fun to see different nations than the old standbys getting some screen-time. (Civ IV was pretty bad at that in the expansion - they added the Holy Roman Empire to a game that already contained Germany, for instance.)<br><br>((For the following: please bear in mind that I&#39;ve never played CiV.))<br><br>So how much have you had to do to get these working? Back in IV, it would&#39;ve been... hrm, unique unit and building, some flavour text, choosing traits, a flag, and... I don&#39;t remember how much the styling varied between civs, I think some, but probably in cultural groups rather than individually for each. So what&#39;d you need to make for CiV?<br><br>(I realise I could probably search up the answer, but when I do that I don&#39;t get to have conversations; it&#39;s terribly dull.)<br><br>hS, still wishing someone would remake the fantasy and space parts of Civ 2: Test of Time...</p>

            <p>You have to <s>get someone else to</s> code up the individual stuff, but that&#39;s generally speaking the easy part. Each Civ has a unique attribute (a passive bonus) and two unique things it can make in game, be they units, buildings, or tile improvements. The Dutch, for instance, can build Polders on Marsh or Flood Plains tiles, and have a Caravel replacement (an early mid-game melee naval unit) called a Sea Beggar. This can be tricky, but you still have a lot of other things to do before you can in good conscience release your modded Civ.<br><br>You then have to knock together art assets, especially if you have unique units. This involves an icon for the Civ in question, icons for the unique units, portraits for all the uniques, a map for the title screen that shows the relevant borders, and a leader screen. Civ 5 has dynamic, 3D, animated leader screens. There are maybe, like, two mods that have those, and only one of them has independent voice acting. By total coinkydink, that&#39;s one I also worked on in a minor capacity: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axxJQOxWvVc">Australia</a>, by the Colonialist Legacies team. You also need to do the Civilopedia entries (background information on the Civ in question, its leader, and the unique units, buildings, &amp;c), unique leader dialogue, and a Dawn of Man speech. This last part is my particular speciality; a bombastic speech meant to inspire you to victory as your chosen Civ. I love writing them, they&#39;re so pompous, it&#39;s <i>wonderful</i>. =]<br><br>Leader traits kind of went out the window in Civ 5, but there&#39;s a mod that brings them back, because of course there is. However, you do have to code particular AI flavours for when you&#39;re playing against the Civ - how much they&#39;d use nuclear weapons, how loyal they are, that kind of thing.<br><br>Actually, that&#39;s a point - there are a LOT of mods for Civ 5 now, and compatibility with them and support for them is greatly encouraged. Events And Decisions, Cultural Diversity, Ethnic Units, and the aforementioned Civ 4 Leader Traits mods are the big ones, but there&#39;s also Exploration: Continued: Expanded, Rise To Power, Historical Religions... let&#39;s just say there&#39;s a lot to keep track of. There&#39;s also Mercenaries, which has just been released and is pretty awesome, but none of the Civs in my pack support it yet.<br><br>After all that, which is quite a bit of work, you&#39;re ready to release it onto Steam or direct download via Dropbox and have people report a shedload of bugs you missed and (if Colonialist Legacies&#39; experience with our Afghanistan Civ is anything to go by) occasionally draw out all the crazy, racist rednecks who call you a terrorist sympathiser for having the gall to depict Afghans as something other than skerreh brown peepul to be Gouda-cheesed out of existence in interchangeable modern military shooters.<br><br>But hey, it also means you can nuke Thatcher, so Civ 5 mods rule. =]</p>

            <p>It contained good amounts of both comedy and character-based moments (two things I always love to see). While I&#39;m not normally a fan of the &quot;person immediately starts acting dopey after seeing someone they are attracted to&quot; trope, it really works in this situation for two reasons:<br>— Ilraen has definitely had his dopey moments before this; and<br>— As was made clear in the text, he had never seen a female of his species before.<br>Everything fits his character. It especially helps that their personalities clash so much. The story is funny and very well put-together. Kudos to both you and Iximaz.<br><br>I only have two little sticking points. The first is regarding the occasional shifts to omniscient perspective. Most of the story seems to be third person limited-omniscient; that is to say, taken from Ilraen&#39;s point of view and involving his thoughts. That made the very brief shifts where the audience could see Farilan&#39;s thoughts and feelings feel awkward to me. I would argue that this story would be a bit sharper had it been entirely focused on either Ilraen or Farilan.<br><br>I also felt that the opening paragraph was a bit clumsy considering that pretty much everything it said about Ilraen&#39;s project was repeated later in the story by Ilraen himself. I would argue that saying he was working on the CAD is all that needed to be explained in that opening.<br><br>Other than that, I thought this was very good. I look forward to more stories.</p>

            <p>Calamity, by Brandon Sanderson comes out on February 16. With that, I have nothing to wait for that would come out in the near future. I can&#39;t judge good literature because nowadays, it feels like books just have either the New York Times, Booklist or some Author say something good about it nowadays. I would read something more mature, but I don&#39;t want to ruin my younger brother&#39;s imagination. Kid gets into everything I have. Things at my age are either about people with hormonal imbalances or murdering each other. Long story short: What things are you waiting for, and is there anything good to read for someone 1-11 years old right now? </p>

            <p>Aside from seconding the suggestions for Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, I&#39;m gonna suggest the Callahan series by Spider Robinson. It&#39;s about a bar in upstate New York that has all kinds of patrons, from aliens to time travelers. Even a talking dog and a vampire. There&#39;s also <i>lots</i> of puns. Like everywhere. Most of the chapter and short story titles are puns.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d go with Neil Gaiman (some of his stuff is mature, but a lot can be read by younger kids also) and Terry Pratchett (who is for everybody, regardless of age).<br><br>And maybe try some Gentlemen&#39;s Bastards (Scott Lynch), A Song of Ice and Fire (GRRM) or The Queen&#39;s Thief (Megan Whalen Turner). They&#39;re not suitable for a younger audience (except for the first Queen&#39;s Thief book) but they have so much politics and intrigues that he&#39;ll probably get bored long before he gets to the traumatizing bits.<br><br>(Wow, that&#39;s a lot of parentheses.)</p>

            <p><s>and still have on my shelves</s><br><br>Well, let&#39;s begin with the <i>Young Wizards</i> series by Diane Duane. I actually got into this series in my late teens/early 20s, but it&#39;s meant for younger readers, and I reckon a precocious eleven-year-old would get a kick out of it. In this universe, wizards are given their magic by the Powers That Be in order to fight entropy and its originator, the Lone Power. Touches on some serious themes, like death, but in a very positive, empowering way, IMO.<br><br>Ooh, there&#39;s the <i>Dark Is Rising</i> series by Susan Cooper. Arthurian legend meets Celtic myth meets... okay, I don&#39;t know what it meets. Pick a series where plucky kids save the day.<br><br>Anything by Madeleine L&#39;Engle is good, particularly the <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> series. It&#39;s sort of science fiction, sort of fantasy, and the last book sort of gets into religious myth. It&#39;s quite a ride.<br><br>Also, you can&#39;t go wrong with classics like <i>Watership Down</i> by Richard Adams, <i>The Last Unicorn</i> by Peter S. Beagle, and <i>Black Beauty</i> by Anna Sewell. <br><br>Speaking of horses, if you or he are into them, try the works of Marguerite Henry, particularly <i>King of the Wind</i> and <i>Misty of Chincoteague</i>. Oh, and let&#39;s not leave out <i>The Black Stallion</i> by Walter Farley.<br><br>I hope that gives you something to work with. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p><s>and I&#39;m going to assume you&#39;ve already gone for <i>Harry Potter</i></s><br><br>...can I recommend <i>The Divide Trilogy</i> by Elizabeth Kay? It&#39;s about a thirteen year old boy who, while on vacation with his parents in Costa Rica, faints—right over a place called The Divide. When he wakes up, he&#39;s in another world where magical creatures are real and humans are the myths. (And the magical creatures all have different names for reasons that are later explained in the books, like tangle-child=elf, japegrin=pixie, stuff like that.) <br><br>I will warn that the last book is a bit of a Happy Downer Ending, but I loved this series when I was a kid and can&#39;t recommend it enough because it deserves more attention.</p>

            <p>Well, John Flanagan&#39;s writings are on the higher end of that age spectrum (actually they&#39;re written for middle schoolers, I believe) - but I blame that on the vocabulary.

            <p>On the -- hang on -- 25th, apparently. Though weirdly, your first post was the only one you made that day... usually I see massive numbers of posts as people reply to their newbie greetings. You seemed content to sit quietly.<br><br>2011 is one of our most popular years - you have nine compatriots! Good for you...?<br><br>I suspect that an exponential-ish curve is pretty standard for most places. It&#39;ll be different in the sort of place that build up an established membership and then stopped (so forums for old computer games, for instance), but for your standard internetty place, it sounds fairly normal. Not that I have data for that!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>-Ever since Plort&#39;s creation, I&#39;ve used Baron Me as a mouthpiece for making changes by diplomatic process. That&#39;s accidentally turned him into a scheming politician. See <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Tale_of_the_Election_of_Four_Barons">the Tale of the Election of Four Barons</a> for an example (and <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/The_Eagle%27s_Shadows">The Eagle&#39;s Shadows</a> for how the populace interpreted it).<br><br>-A few weeks ago, the Board and Other Board crashed due to the host being attacked. That&#39;s what led to Borrd being abandoned (temporarily; everyone&#39;s back now, because Plort is biographical, and everyone&#39;s back <i>here</i> now).<br><br>-In response to that, I suggested that T-Board be made the official Other Board. Which, in Plort terms, means Tomash becoming Protector of Ozerbord.<br><br>-Abruptly losing his position of power made Baron Me realise that he&#39;d, y&#39;know, been clinging to power with a death-grip, which isn&#39;t precisely what <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/File:HuinesoronArms1.png"></a>his coat of arms suggests he&#39;s like.

            <p>... Now I&#39;ll have to go re-read that thread to remember why we needed it. ^<em>^; Was it to see whether there were enough stories to support the awards? ...

At least, I hope so. {= )<br><br>(Also, speaking of music, I finally got McCaffrey/Opland/Freeman&#39;s <i>Sunset&#39;s Gold</i> and listened to it yesterday, and it&#39;s great—even better than the <i>Masterharper of Pern</i> CD, I think.

            <p>Things I can actually see! (And are short enough for me to read before passing out.) What a surprise. <br><br><b>Plort</b><br><br>There&#39;s nothing wrong with introspection. I rather like this piece, and all the floatful rumours within. <br><br>It definitely makes sense to me, and strikes a chord here on my end, too- while I&#39;ve come back, I&#39;m a completely different person than the person who joined, much less the person who had originally left. That, and y&#39;know, that whole getting old thing. (Because we&#39;re all old now.) <br><br><b>Statistics</b><br><br>The breakdown by who&#39;s granted and denied is ahaha... a bit daunting, oops. I didn&#39;t realise I was that stringent? <br><br>I suppose the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bqF5uz1ZVJI8JJUZx9J-0IaWiVxU3GFp2gUie_vEGq4/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm">census results</a>could also be crammed into that whole thing, too, now that 2015 is truly over. <br><br>59 is indeed a high number, certainly. I&#39;m also surprised at how much (as in, anything) I have on there myself. <br><br>...Let&#39;s see how 2016 turns out!<br><br><b>Munchkin</b><br><br>I have no thoughts or input on Munchkin because I&#39;ve never played and most of the images refuse to load. For this, I will blame the FCs. (Even though they have nothing to do with the internet.)<br><br>[Also also also email me back.]<br><br>-July, HTML&#39;d. <br><br></p>

            <p>My missions with Doktor Trollenfisch und Gabrielle are both cowrites with Iximaz. So that bumps her total up to 61. Which is amazing and slightly scary.<br><br>Also: I think we should start listing Ix Numbers. For instance, those who have never collaborated with Iximaz have an Ix Number of 0. Those who have directly cowritten something with Iximaz have an Ix Number of 1 - so that&#39;d be me, Des, people like that. Huinesoron, on the other hand, hasn&#39;t (too my knowledge) directly collaborated on a published piece of content, but he <i>has</i> done something with Nesh in the past, who has cowritten a mission with Ix.

            <p>that I&#39;ve been thinking about frequently, but haven&#39;t had the motivation to actually post about, is degrees of separation from the Original Series!  As an example:<br><br>Agent Doc communicated with Elanor Laison during one of our <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=2798;title=PPC%20Message%20Board">mailbox RPs</a>. (1)<br><br>Elanor appeared in <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/CrashTitle.htm"><i>Crashing Down</i></a>, as did Vemi Fincaran. (2)<br><br>Vemi <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/JAAKSONS/ch4_bjamvemi.html">guest-starred</a> in the JAAKSONS spin-off of Agents Nenya and Rosie. (3)<br><br>Rosie and Nenya met Jay and Acacia on their <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/JAAKSONS/ch1_laurel.html">very first day</a> in the PPC! (4)<br><br>So Doc is four degrees of separation from the Original.  Not bad, considering I joined four? five? years after Jay left.<br><br>So, how about other folks?  Remember, the Wiki is your research friend!<br><br>—doctorlit, nude while the laundry runs</p>

            <p>I reckon the individual names should all go alphabetically at the top, and then the connections underneath. I&#39;m not sure what the best way to group them would be, though. Alphabetically makes a certain sense, but on the other hand, I think there&#39;s a good argument for most connections to least, if you can sort that out. That would put Dafydd, Ilraen, and Jenni in some order at the top, and all Dafydd&#39;s connections would be together, all Ilraen&#39;s connections would be together, etc. You might have to change the order on some of them in the process... like, right now there&#39;s a line with &quot;Ithalond&quot; -&gt; &quot;Dafydd Illian&quot;, which would have to be switched to &quot;Dafydd Illian&quot; -&gt; &quot;Ithalond&quot;.<br><br>And you don&#39;t want to list any connections twice, so keeping track when you get back around to Ithalond is where it gets really hairy.<br><br>You should feel free to nope right the heck out at this point. ^_^;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve thought of an easy-ish way to see who has the most connections, which is simply to use Ctrl+F on each name on the Master List. In Firefox, at least, it&#39;ll tell you how many hits there are, which you can then record. One will be just their name, of course, but the rest should all be unique connections.<br><br>For the record, Dafydd and Ilraen are currently tied at 66 hits, and Jenni has 74.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>How does Dafydd have connections to 66 agents? Well, I guess a lot of them are probably from &#39;Woodsprite of the North&#39;, but even so...<br><br>I&#39;m currently desperately trying to get Graphviz to spit out a readable map. I&#39;ve figured out how to increase the separation between nodes, but even with 30 additional points of separation between them, the JeNuRaen cluster still looks like this:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/JeNuRaen.png"><br><br>The two solutions I can think of are:<br><br>1/ Give everyone who has over a certain number of connections a unique line colour. This is doable, and will certainly help with them, but might not make the graph as a whole readable.<br><br>2/ Organise everyone into clusters based on department, and route out-of-department connections around the clusters. This... might or might not work. I&#39;ll have to experiment. (With a subset of the graph! I&#39;m not sitting through 10 minutes of processing every time I want to check it!)<br><br>hS</p>
