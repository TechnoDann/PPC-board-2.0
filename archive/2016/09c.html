            <p>So I noticed there aren&#39;t any badfic threads. I figured since the rule is always to start one if there aren&#39;t any others I might as well. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2371567/1/Master-of-Elements"> Master of the Elements</a> - A Zatch/Gash Bell fanfic that basically copies the main character&#39;s story and within the first two chapters gives a canon character the wrong power. The mamodo has multiple element power when each mamodo with element powers has only one.  The fact the main oc&#39;s book owner is named Kyle when Kiyo is the name of one of the main characters says a lot too. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8802596/1/Born-With-The-Potion"> Born With The Potion </a> New Countries stories are nothing new in the hetalia fandom,you&#39;re bound to find at least of them no matter what fanfic hosting site your on. However this one has Author&#39;s notes in the beginning,end,and smack dab in the middle of the first chapter.  The fact there is a rather glaring lie in the first paragraphs don&#39;t help ether. &quot;Every time a new island comes up, there are always a new nation,&quot; - Aph France,whom has forgotten not every island is it&#39;s own nation. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5561113/3/The-Hawaiian-Princess"> The Hawaiian Princess </a> - A Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch story. Having read Mermaid Melody I can tell you it breaks canon right off the back by having an 8th princess when there are only 7 seas and then having her be the &quot;teal and pink princess&quot; when the canon princesses have only one color their known by. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8348744/1/The-secret-and-the-Slytherin">The secret and the Slytherin</a>: Kagome is somehow  Lucius&#39;s daughter and Draco&#39;s sister despite them being two separate races. There is a house elf called Lulu whom stays with the Malfoy despite being freed by Kagome already. There are also wands made of demon fangs now. </p>

            <p>Here&#39;s what I found looking for things on Skyrim.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11455146/1/Submit-to-me-Dovahkiin">Submit to Me, Dovahkiin</a> - Alduin becomes human and gets paired with a male Dragonborn. As the author says, &quot;M for kinda rape.&quot;<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11535252/1/Emperor-of-Darkness">Emperor of Darkness</a> Basically, the Dragonborn gets possessed by Boethiah and Miraak threatens to open a portal to the past and let the Snow Elves destroy everything for some reason. Also, MPreg. The first few sentences are... interesting.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12013427/1/Fate-and-friends">Fate and Friends</a> - Just to prove that not everything here is sex, there&#39;s this. Bad writing and comma splices abound, along with random POV shifts and whatnot. Basically a series of snippets showing the Dragonborn with her companion going through some pieces of the quest/world.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8674719/1/Guild-of-the-Dragonborn">Guild of the Dragonborn</a> - Let&#39;s have Alduin through a Dragonborn of each race, each with their own parallel universe, together through a hole in reality and see what happens. Turns out, it&#39;s just the main questline again, thus removing any special-ness the Dragonborn ever had.</p>

            <p>Hey guys!  My name is Tesla!  I was introduced to the PPC by my friend and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed.  I&#39;ve read the Constitution and most of the wiki, but I&#39;m still working through the original stories (I&#39;ve got about three under my belt currently).  I belong to many different fandoms, the list is endless.  My main ones are: Steven Universe, Undertale, Gravity Falls, Warriors, MLP, Miraculous Ladybug, Harry Potter, and Doctor Who.  I love to write, animate, draw, sing, role-play, act, you name it I probably like to do it.  I speak mainly English, but I&#39;m learning Japanese and I know a tiny bit of French (working on learning more of that too).  I love to write fanfictions, and I have lots of original stories in the works too!  I&#39;m really looking forward to being here, and I&#39;ll likely be on at least once a week. :)</p>

If you don&#39;t know what your Patronus is you can just saunter over to the link in the Pottermore quiz thread and your figuine will magiccally take shape.<br>Ain&#39;t sorcery grand?<br><br>Speaking of Harry Potter, might I enquire which Common Room you call home?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the greetings! :)<br><br>The quiz said my Patronus is a Wild Boar, but according to my friends they think I&#39;m a Corgi (we had a whole three hour discussion about which animals we are).  I wish they would give some sort of explanation as to exactly WHY you get the Patronus you do.<br><br>As for House, I&#39;m with the Gryffindors, not because it&#39;s the main character&#39;s house, but because I feel like it fits my personality the best.</p>

            <p>Have a rusted bit of metal. I have no idea what it used to be, but it&#39;s twisty and orangey and looks super cool. <br><br>Are there any obligatory questions left for me to ask... What gender pronouns should we use to refer to you (<i>He</i> seems pretty cool for a newbie, <i>She</i> seems pretty cool for a newbie, etc., etc.)? I&#39;m particularly curious because I mentioned the PPC to a couple of my friends lately, and I want to figure out if you&#39;re one of them.

Here&#39;s some movie-theater popcorn to eat while you read the Original Series and whatever spinoffs strike your fancy.<br><br>And OMG you&#39;re learning Japanese?! Me too! How far have you gotten? Are you taking classes or teaching yourself? I&#39;ve been taking classes on it since my freshman year of college. It can be a pain to learn sometimes, what with all the kanji and the weird grammar points and honorific language, but I absolutely, 100% do not regret my decision. :D 日本語は一番！</p>

            <p>It might not really work. It&#39;s mentioned in JS&amp;MN that Scottish wizards talk up their superiority to the English variety, and Hogwarts is about as Scottish as it gets - an enormous, draughty stone lump slap bang in the middle of nowhere, and also in the middle of a forest and/or bog, depending on who you ask. Would the castle, whose practitioners are so very different to those of English magic, even recognize the authority of the Raven King?<br><br>Er, answers on the back of a postcard, please. =]</p>

            <p>More specifically: if John Uskglass is Norman, does he accept the Scottish annexation of Lothian in 1018? If not, then - at least until the Treaty of York in 1237 - everything up to Edinburgh is English in the Raven King&#39;s eyes.<br><br>Bearing in mind that the only Scottish founder of Hogwarts was literally named <b>Ravenclaw</b> (and has a French-sounding name besides), I think he could make a compelling case.<br><br>(And okay, yeah, Hogwarts is apparently well north even of that boundary.

            <p>It&#39;s only mentioned in passing, but all magic used by humans in JS&amp;MN is basically communing with spirits using treaties, favours, and half-forgotten alliances put into place <i>by</i> the Raven King. If Scotland has any magic at all, this is how it happens - so the trees and the rain in the Forbidden Forest are as much subjects of the King as their Saxon counterparts.<br><br>I think I just played myself. =]<br><br>Also, there&#39;s no proof that Uskglass is Norman, and personally I favour the idea that he was the son of a Norse colonist in the north of England whisked away to Fairyland at a young age. It&#39;s heavily implied that his majesty uses fairy magic, and as for why Norse? &quot;I reached out my hand; thought and memory flew out of my enemies&#39; heads like a flock of starlings.&quot; Thought and Memory are English translations of the names of Odin&#39;s ravens, Huginn and Muninn.</p>

            <p>Buzzard is the name for a lot of different birds.

            <p>If you&#39;ve been noticing intermittent problems with the Board layout - most notably the links turning blue - it&#39;s because of something wonky going on with Google hosting. I tried moving the CSS stylesheet to my website, but then that went on the blink too... if anyone has a reliable website that can host <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/PPCBoard.css">this page</a>, I&#39;d really appreciate it.<br><br>fanficWorld is having the same problem with Google hosting; I have a nasty feeling Webs.com won&#39;t let me upload Javascript files, so we may have to implement a <i>third</i> variant of the site to get it back up and running... again, if anyone knows of a free host that will let me upload Javascript and HTML files, please let me know.<br><br>On the plus side, Bonsaimallorn (and all my other sites) should be back. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

To be consistent, there should be a comma after &quot;saying.&quot;<br><i>She squeezed his fingers in silent reassurance, and together, they set off for the keep.</i> If I&#39;m understanding the <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/607/02/">Purdue OWL</a> correctly, there should be another comma before &quot;together&quot; because the word is nonessential to the clause (in that you could have put it on the end of the sentence or left it out and the sentence would still be coherent, not because I think your being &quot;together&quot; isn&#39;t important! ^.^). I&#39;m not terribly sure about this, so if anyone wants to discuss it that would be appreciated.<br><br>Non-SPaG-related concerns: <br>You two are <i>far</i> too cute together. D&#39;awww and congratulations again.<br><br>--Key is procrastinating on writing an essay, but also genuinely happy for you two.</p>

            <p>And before you ask, this is based on a fandom Ix and I share, but it may not apply to you, Aegis.<br><br>See, in noted superhero web novel <i>Worm</i>, there is a cape called Aegis with hyper-redundant physiology - dozens of hearts, huge amounts of muscle tissue, multiple sets of lungs and brains and kidneys, all that good stuff. This leads me to the following idea for Aegis&#39; own arms...<br><br><i>Sable, a fess vert, two hearts proper flammant or, one and one</i><br><br>And thus one might impale Ix&#39;s arms accordingly. =]</p>

            <p>The thing is, while I love the Worm serial, I&#39;m not a fan of Aegis as a character. Nothing against him, unless you count finding him a bit dull (I&#39;m more of a fan of Tattletale, Bakuda, and Coil- Thinkers, especially). <br><br>I like the idea of two hearts emblazoned, but I wanted to go with something I related to with my crest. <br><br>(Basically, I liked what I&#39;d drawn up, so I went with it.

            <p>Sword and Blade don&#39;t appear in Epic Yarn. However this fanfic writer seemed to forget that Meta Knight appeared in Epic Yarn.

            <p><font size="10">The Importance Of Mary Sue</font><br>&quot;When I was in Ninth Grade, I won a thing.  <br><br>That thing, in particular, was a thirty dollar Barnes &amp; Noble gift certificate.  I was still too young for a part-time job, so I didn’t have this kind of spending cash on me, ever.  I felt like a god.<br><br>Drunk with power, I fancy-stepped my way to my local B&amp;N.  I was ready to choose new books based solely on the most important of qualities… ABSOLUTELY WICKED COVER ART.  I walked away with a handful of paperbacks, most of which were horrible (I’m looking at you, Man-Kzin Wars III) or simply forgettable.  <br><br>One book did not disappoint.  I fell down the rabbit hole into a series that proved to be as awesome as the cover art promised (Again, Man-Kzin Wars III, way to drop the ball on that one).  With more than a dozen books in the series, I devoured them.  I bought cassette tapes of ballads sung by bards in the stories.  And the characters.  Oh, the characters.  I loved them.  Gryphons, mages, but most importantly, lots of women.  Different kinds of women.  So many amazing women.  I looked up to them, wrote bad fiction that lifted entire portions of dialogue and character descriptions, dreamed of writing something that the author would include in an anthology.<br><br>This year I decided in a fit of nostalgia to revisit the books I loved so very much.  I wanted to reconnect with my old friends…<br><br>…and I found myself facing Mary Sues.  Lots of them.  Perfect, perfect, perfect.  A fantasy world full of Anakin Skywalkers and Nancy Drews and Wesley Crushers.  I felt crushed.  I had remembered such complex, deep characters and didn’t see those women in front of me at all anymore.  Where were those strong women who kept me safe through the worst four years of my life?<br><br>Which led me to an important realization as I soldiered on through book after book.  That’s why I needed them.  Because they were Mary Sues.  These books were not written to draw my attention to all the ugly bumps and whiskers of the real world.  They were somewhere to hide.  I was painfully aware that I was being judged by my peers and adults and found lacking.  I was a mess up.  And sometimes a mess up needs to feel like a Mary Sue.  As an adult, these characters felt a little thin because they lacked the real world knowledge I, as an adult, had learned and earned.  But that’s the thing…these books weren’t FOR this current version of myself.   Who I am now doesn’t need a flawless hero because I’m comfortable with the idea that valuable people are also flawed.<br><br>There is a reason that most fanfiction authors, specifically girls, start with a Mary Sue.  It’s because girls are taught that they are never enough.  You can’t be too loud, too quiet, too smart, too stupid.  You can’t ask too many questions or know too many answers.  No one is flocking to you for advice.  Then something wonderful happens.  The girl who was told she’s stupid finds out that she can be a better wizard than Albus Dumbledore.  And that is something very important.  Terrible at sports?  You’re a warrior who does backflips and Legolas thinks you’re THE BEST.   No friends?  You get a standing ovation from Han Solo and the entire Rebel Alliance when you crash-land safely on Hoth after blowing up the Super Double Death Star.  It’s all about you.  Everyone in your favorite universe is TOTALLY ALL ABOUT YOU.<br><br>I started writing fanfiction the way most girls did, by re-inventing themselves.  <br><br>Mary Sues exist because children who are told they’re nothing want to be everything.  <br><br>As a girl, being “selfish” was the worst thing you could be.  Now you live in Narnia and Prince Caspian just proposed marriage to you.  Why?  Your SELF is what saved everyone from that sea serpent.  Plus your hair looks totally great braided like that.<br><br>In time, hopefully, these hardworking fanfiction authors realize that it’s okay to be somewhere in the middle and their characters adjust to respond to that.  As people grow and learn, characters grow and learn.  Turns out your Elven Mage is more interesting if he isn’t also the best swordsman in the kingdom.  Not everyone needs to be hopelessly in love with your Queen for her to be a great ruler.  There are all kinds of ways for people to start owning who they are, and embracing the things that make them so beautifully weird and complicated.<br><br>Personally, though, I think it’s a lot more fun learning how to trust yourself and others if you all happen to be riding dragons.&quot;<br><br>TL;DR: <b><i>Mary Sues exist because children who are told they’re nothing want to be everything.</i></b><br><br>A girl making herself the hero of her own story is a radical act. Stop shaming girls for doing it. <b>Stop shaming yourself for it.</b></p>

            <p>The problem is when it&#39;s done badly. I think it&#39;s cool when characters are best friends with Legolas or marry Caspian or any of the other things you mentioned. But it has to make sense. The girl who&#39;s a better wizard than Dumbledore should show it off and do something really cool and impressive. Sues usually just have a character SAY they&#39;re better than Dumbledore. The character who blows up the Super Double Death Star should have some big action-y sequence where they work as hard as they can and come out as a hero for it. Sues just have it happen. I don&#39;t need every story to be a cerebral look at the flaws of man and his failings. Heroes are allowed to just be cool. They&#39;re heroes after all. But the difference between a Mary Sue and a hero is that the hero earns the title and makes me like them.<br><br>The girl who does backflips is fine though, because that&#39;s legitimately impressive, and Legolas is a smart elf for recognizing that.</p>

            <p>But here is the thing. <br>Take on look at my old whitewash representation of New Orleans and tell me that it&#39;s okay to show a mostly black city with a deep black history as Asian. <br><br>Take a look at all the bad ocs who use mental disabilities and illnesses as accessories to excuse their wrong doings or make them edgy and tell me that&#39;s okay. <br><br>The importance of sues and stus is that they are just a stage.

            <p>You absolutely won&#39;t see the same &#39;who cares if it&#39;s unrealistic, it&#39;s empowering!&#39; argument for stories which turn black cultures into white ones, or have uber-masculine Suvians (ie, Stus) conquering everything, or make every religion have churches they go to on Sunday, or whatnot. It&#39;s a very targetted &#39;THIS type of bad writing shouldn&#39;t be criticised!&#39;.<br><br>On the flip side, there&#39;s a solid reason for that: all three of those examples involve taking something that historically dominates the cultural landscape in the writer&#39;s area (white people, men, Christianity) and have them dominate <i>more</i>. The argument for female Suvians is that they&#39;re taking a historically weaker group (women) and making it stronger. In other words, write New Orleans as if it were white, and it&#39;s awful. Write Seattle as if it were black, and it&#39;s a deep insight into racial etc etc.<br><br>On the flip flip side: the majority of female Suvians don&#39;t actually come across as stronger women. The whole &#39;everybody loves them&#39; cliche? That&#39;s an extension of the whole &#39;a woman&#39;s only value is in how much men like her&#39; idea which leads to perfume adverts looking like underwear adverts. It&#39;s not strength if the thing you&#39;re over-intensifying is a bad idea to start with.<br><br>(And &#39;she can beat Boromir with one hand tied behind her back!&#39; assumes that strong characters have to be <b>physically</b> strong - ie, that value is obtained only by achieving ultra-masculinity. Why yes, this is what we should be teaching our girls!

            <p>To be honest too many people let 12,or maybe it was it 13 I don&#39;t remember, year old me run around with a terrible New Orleans o...il someone did a criticism for your oc thread in which someone told me about how it wasn&#39;t okay.  New Orleans is at least 60% black and the birthplace of a genre of music that was created by black people. I was running around with a weeb creation that didn&#39;t even make sense clothes wise. <br>If it wasn&#39;t for that I wouldn&#39;t of been able to toss the gary stu away and create a new one which I&#39;ve built on to this day. <br><br>Hell if it wasn&#39;t for wanting to constantly research to improve my ocs I wouldn&#39;t have discovered amazing things about the two cities I loved or gotten the old books that told me tales of things like the south&#39;s leaders running to Mexico or the Baton Rouge Bus Boycott.  Which just strengthened my love for the ocs I was making already. <br><br>If it wasn&#39;t for doing the research on them I wouldn&#39;t be able to have started research to make all my newer ocs good or at least decent. Hell at this point researching for my ocs is part of the fun! <br><br><br>Bad writing and poor research that is a big issue with all Suvians,they are meant to be one way but the writing tells a much different story.  Blood Raining Night&#39;s protag for example,we&#39;re meant to take her seriously has a threat and side with her but the writing in both the fanfic and fanime portrays her as a bully whose willing to work with a criminal organization. <br><br>Hell improvement in character designs was part of the reason nearly everyone in the hetalia fandom was so excited for the new art style for the anime,the nations would finally get more correct skin tones that matched their canon skintones instead of highlighter pink to pale. The nations looked more like the nations they actually were meant to represent. Research and improving characters doesn&#39;t harm anything and in fact could make people much happier. <br><br></p>

            <p>Instead of wasting your energy on us, why don&#39;t you take it and put it to use teaching the world not to tell girls that they&#39;re nothing? Then, according to this essay, they won&#39;t write godawful Mary Sues anymore, and maybe fiction in general will improve so that the next kid with a Barnes &amp; Noble gift card will fall in love with a book that actually deserves it. Everybody wins!<br><br>Though, I&#39;m pretty sure my own terrible writing had nothing to do with feeling undervalued, because I wasn&#39;t and I knew it.

            <p>And, <s>Suvian</s> original author of this post, I&#39;m sorry it took you so long to find well-written stories about awesome female heroes. Because they exist. I was lucky enough to grow up with <i>The Westing Game</i>, <i>Wild Magic</i>, <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> (and the rest of the series. <i>A Wind in the Door</i> was better; Meg gets to be more of a hero). The entire genre built around the idea of the damsel in distress taking charge of her situation and befriending the dragon / becoming a sorceress / fighting off the enemy / whatever needs doing. <i>Matilda</i>. There are hundreds of decent-to-good books about awesome women and girls saving the day. I&#39;m sorry you found a bad one, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the stories which inspire girls <i>have</i> to be bad.  <br><br>Internet tirades aside, I&#39;m off to slip my local seven-year-old girl a copy of <i>Igraine the Brave</i>.<br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>I dreamed about becoming a Ranger. Maybe Aragorn would stumble wounded into the Prancing Pony, and I&#39;d help nurse him back to health, thereby proving my skills enough to get taken on as an apprentice, and we&#39;d go off and have father-daughter-esque adventures together. Man, I really wanted that. I <i>still</i> really want that.<br><br>And I would totally read a fanfic about that, too, if it were well-written and didn&#39;t involve the main character also, say, being a werewolf who is just fluffy and misunderstood despite werewolves in M-e being 100% evil because they were created by and served the second-most evil Dark Lord in the history of the universe. I don&#39;t object to a woman Ranger, but I do object to <i>anyone</i> being able to sew three dresses in one hour, balance on the point of a sword in someone else&#39;s hand, and making the noble, wise, and kind canon character that I love into a tool for propping up her own rightness. (I&#39;m talking about the fic (now deleted) featured in <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc1110/03abwos.html">this mission</a>, parts of which I genuinely liked. Shame it was ruined by the above and more.)<br><br>Anyway, dreams make crappy stories without a lot of effort to weed out the nonsense and fill it in with logic. Dreams don&#39;t have to make sense, but stories do. Have your dreams, love them, remember them—but maybe don&#39;t write them down, and definitely don&#39;t put them where other people can see unless you&#39;re prepared to do the work.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Also: <i>The Blue Sword</i>. <i>The Hero and the Crown</i>. Many of Anne McCaffrey&#39;s books, though IMO they do fall a bit flat on re-reading as an adult. But then there&#39;s pretty much anything by Sherri S. Tepper. <i>Young Wizards</i>. And so on, and so forth.<br><br>And, crazy as it sounds, girls don&#39;t necessarily <i>have</i> to find inspiration from reading about other girls. There should be more great books about great female heroes, absolutely, but what got me though the worst years of my life was <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Arwen and Galadriel and Éowyn are pretty damn cool, but mostly I think I needed a world where people were noble and wise and kind, where good wins in the end. I took the values of the story to heart without ever feeling I had to be a certain gender to live them. Because... y&#39;know... women <i>are</i> just as good as men, the real world is the real world, and the story is just a story. Go figure.<br><br>~Neshomeh still believes most people are basically good, if apathetic.</p>

            <p>A little slow at the beginning, but once it picks up... :D<br><br>I&#39;d add Lloyd Alexander&#39;s Chronicles of Prydain series to that list--it&#39;s a similar thing about values, with awesome characters who learn things about themselves and the world, and has the added bonus that the female characters are equally awesome and plot-affecting. His other books are pretty awesome too--he had this gift for writing interesting stories with great characters who developed over the course of the book. I&#39;ve read and reread his books a *lot*--and I&#39;m still doing it. I&#39;d say they&#39;re good for just about every age.<br><br>I&#39;d also add Gerald Morris&#39; Squire&#39;s Tales series. It&#39;s a hilarious retelling of the King Arthur stories--he even has a similar series meant for kids who are new readers, and it&#39;s equally funny but with slightly different themes--has a lot of female protagonists, and basically treats everyone equally (whether it&#39;s to laugh at them or praise them) and, again, it&#39;s a certain kind of person--kind, wise, noble--that comes out looking best. That&#39;s another series that I&#39;ve read so, so many times and am still rereading. It&#39;s another one for most ages.<br><br>Also, everything by Tamora Pierce. As an adult, I go back and notice various themes she wove into her books that obviously come from experience and experience with... I believe it was a women&#39;s shelter? I&#39;ve forgotten the details. As a kid, I just accepted them as part of the story. And even now... it works. She wove so many things--from feminist struggles to how blacksmithing and glassblowing and *rocks* and jousting work--and it fits in very well and it teaches you all sorts of cool things. So almost anything by her is something I&#39;ll recommend highly, especially since it comes with so many wonderful characters whom I care a lot about. <s>Especially the Circle kids.</s><br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>It&#39;s funny, honestly, because the original character Mary Sue from Star Trek was a parody of the concept itself.<br><br>It therefore follows that any Mary Sue is just as bad as the characters created for Star Trek which inspired the parody in the first place.

            <p>At the prodding of Baron Thanasius Ampelius (aka Desdendelle), I have started the project of documenting the Ypur Wars, as they once raged across the fair lands of Borrd. I would be deeply appreciative if anyone who was around then would write up your (actual, not Plort-ified) memories of the time. I can pass my email or other contact information on request if you don&#39;t want to share stuff publicly.<br><br>I&#39;m intending to Plortify the campaigns against the Ypurs, the Quest for the Bane-Hammer, the liberation of Borrd, and so on; I would also deeply love peoples&#39; suggestions for what they would have been doing in-Plort throughout. (There will be a separate call for that once I have the broad strokes of the campaigns and battlefields laid out.)<br><br>By my hand,<br><i>Baroness Delta Juliette</i></p>

            <p>Assuming we&#39;re talking about the time when we didn&#39;t have admin control here, my response was to establish a second YourWebApps (or were we still Server.com?) board, and do my level best to make it an exact copy of this one. At the time, we mostly believed that we <i>wouldn&#39;t</i> get control of this one back - I wasn&#39;t setting up a temporary spam shelter, but a replacement Board.<br><br>I remember being very frustrated trying to get the link colours to work right; they kept wanting to be blue.<br><br>I know you were working on getting hold of the admin details... did you also try and contact P@L to get her to stomp on the spam for us?<br><br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=4;title=PPC%20Message%20Board;pagemark=150">This</a> is my opening post on the Other Board, which says that apparently I&#39;m misremembering slightly (go figure). <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=241484;pagemark=150">This</a> is where the Other Board starts; you can jump the URL back in 25s to find the rest of the posts. It looks like you got the admin access after only ten days.<br><br>~<br><br>On a Plort perspective, in case it helps, this is what&#39;s already written:<br><br><i>But the renewed onslaught was noticed - and brought retaliation. Vast armies of hideous trolls crossed the sea, swimming through the reefs, leading their gargantuan ypur mounts through the water. When they made landfall, they brought ruin upon whatever they found. Only the combined forces of the barons was able to bring them down - and those which escaped swore, in their vile tongue, that they would return.<br><br>Fortifications were built, in preparation for the next assault, but the next enemy Plort would face was not the Marizu. Distrustful of the barons, the lands that had once been Chaett rebelled anew, forming the Republic of Iric. Huinesoron fled to Plort; Dann remained in Iric, a leader of the revolution.<br><br>Iric claimed a new form of government: true democracy, with elected officials, not absolute rulers. The people of Plort were skeptical - but some took the idea to heart. The Librarians’ War was swift and bloody. When the fighting died down, the south coast of Konti-Nyuum had become the Commonwealth of Wechi. Here, all were truly equal: though the baron Neshomeh still held her castle, and her opinion was sought in time of dispute, Wechi was not her domain.<br><br>The splintering of Konti-Nyuum might have continued indefinitely, had it not been for a further assault by the Marizu. Driven from their homes, the people of Plort fled to the western city of Ozerbord - and found the citizens of Wechi there before them. Even the folk of Iric soon joined them, and as their united armies drove away the trolls, the three nations took conference.<br><br>The outcome was perfect for none, but acceptable to all. The nations would once more reunite into a Union of Plort, but would not thereby become a single realm. Instead, it would be a union of four countries. Over each would be placed barons, to lead the common war effort - but beyond matters military, the nations would be independent. The Protectorate of Borrd, comprising the north and central areas, would continue to be ruled by its barons. The Republic of Iric would continue to elect its own leaders, known for no apparent reason as ‘Ops’ and ‘Dars’. The Commonwealth of Wechi renewed its commitment to absolute democracy, while granting its barons the power to exile inhabitants at need. Finally, in the west, Ozerbord and its hinterland were created the new Refuge of Ozerbord: a monument to the unity of Plort, a bastion in time of need, a place of celebration. Over this primarily military realm, the exiled baron Huinesoron was placed.</i><br><br>And:<br><br><i>During the invasions of Konti-Nyuum by trolls, it is said that an Unnamed Knight guarded the Pass of the Five, fending off all attacks until the armies of Plort could once again take the field. Who this knight is has been a source of much debate, with speculation ranging from &#39;a baron of Plort&#39; to &#39;a long-departed knight&#39; to &#39;Jay herself&#39;.</i><br><br>I&#39;m... actually not sure what&#39;s going on with the timeline, there. Ypurs, then the IRC, <i>then</i> the Other Board? At least one of those must be out of order, unless I&#39;m dramatically misremembering.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s called <i>Galavant</i>. It ran on ABC for two all-too-brief seasons, and now it&#39;s on Netflix.

            <p>Okay, maybe not *ever*, but it&#39;s so, so good. The songs are catchy, the plot is good, it&#39;s funny, and it&#39;s just *fun*. It&#39;s even fun to rewatch! Give it a few episodes, and it&#39;ll catch you forever and have you humming the main song at random moments. :) Karen (Du Lay) got me hooked on it around when it was on season 2 or about to start season 2 (can&#39;t remember exactly). It&#39;s so much fun and I recommend it. (Watch out for a bit of strong language and a number of actor cameos--including Anthony Stewart Head of Buffy and More fame).<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>All right, let&#39;s do this again! Just moments ago, the Ellen Show posted the final trailer for the upcoming <i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</i> film, so let&#39;s start with our analysis!<br><br>As always, here&#39;s the trailer -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGNnv_g9h4k">[CLICK]</a><br><br>And now, I shall erect a small Spoiler Wall!<br><br>SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br><br>And let&#39;s begin!<br><br><b>[00:13]</b> Opening shot of New York City, with the Goldstein Sisters (Tina and Queenie; Newt&#39;s future wife and her sister, if anyone forgot) listening to monster growls spreading across the city. My guess is this is before they meet Newt and before he explains what happened.<br><br><b>[00:20]</b> This is President Pickles, obviously, questioning Tina. So a full day has passed since Newt&#39;s case malfunctioned and the creatures escaped.<br><br><b>[00:29]</b> Newt Scamander is a Time Lord.<br><br><b>[00:32]</b> Always a pleasure doing business with a Goblin owner of a Wizarding Speakeasy.<br><br><b>[00:39]</b> The <a href="http://i.imgur.com/6IGJXBs.jpg">MACUSA Clock</a> - very reminiscent of the Weasley Family Clock.<br><br><b>[00:42]</b> Here come dat <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3W7GDrc.png">Niffler</a> oh hey waddup.<br><br><b>[00:45]</b> &quot;<i>We don&#39;t like things loose.</i>&quot; has more than one meaning when we consider Supreme Leader Pickles&#39;s policies.<br><br><b>[00:47]</b> Closer look at what I am almost sure is an Occamy egg. Seeing that we get an Occamy later in the movie, these guys must grow pretty darn fast.<br><br><b>[01:00]</b> First glimpse at Newt&#39;s TARDIS case. Looks like an office and a lab.<br><br><b>[01:02]</b> WHAT IS <a href="http://i.imgur.com/cjwUsr9.jpg">THAT?!</a> A big rhino-squid-porcupine?! Okay... seriously though, I have two picks. It&#39;s either A) a Graphorn, or B) an Erumpent. Both were confirmed to appear in the movies <a href="http://collider.com/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-things-to-know/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=collidersocial">here</a>.<br><br><b>[01:03]</b> A little <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IesNbjO.png">pink owl</a> sneaks from behind the rhino family. This is most likely a Fwooper.<br><br><b>[01:05]</b> Now this is a really nice shot. I don&#39;t know if those are creatures or statues that dot this hill, but it&#39;s confirmed that a Mooncalf will appear so... maybe?<br><br><b>[01:07]</b> Newt and Jacob chillin&#39; with Bowtruckles. I think this, as well as the hill before, is still the world inside Newt&#39;s TARDIS suitcase.<br><br><b>[01:09]</b> Blink and you&#39;ll miss the Occamy hatching at the bottom.<br><br><b>[01:10]</b> This is a <a href="http://imgur.com/679a237d-93bb-4785-8546-30ce9cdc6a27">very spiky puff-lion</a>. My first guess was a Manticore, but now I&#39;m gonna change it to Nundu. We&#39;re getting a freakin&#39; Nundu!<br><br><b>[01:20]</b> Ah, here we go. This is Mary Lou Barebone, or American!Umbridge. She leads the New Salem witch hunters. She also apparently descends from Bartholomew Barebone, the Scourer from the 18th century crisis.<br><br><b>[01:25]</b> Credence Barebone, Mary Lou&#39;s adopted son, and apparently a very important figure in <i>Harry Potter</i> canon. Talking with President Pickles&#39;s right-hand man, eh?<br><br><b>[01:40]</b> Enter mah boy, the Thunderbird!<br><br><b>[01:45]</b> I STILL DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT THAT IS!!!<br><br><b>[01:55]</b> That&#39;s an Occamy, but is that <i>the</i> Occamy from the egg before?<br><br><b>[02:01]</b> Okay, changing my mind... <a href="http://imgur.com/88c55c13-f148-40d0-9685-34072e8dba07">THIS</a> has to be an Erumpent.<br><br><b>[02:04]</b> The aftermath of the Thunderbird encounter?<br><br><b>[02:06]</b> Eeeeey, mah boi Niffler! :P<br><br><b>[02:10]</b> &quot;<i>I won&#39;t let another one die.</i>&quot; Knowing Newt he&#39;s most likely talking about a creature, but do tell, I&#39;m intrigued.<br><br><b>[02:12]</b> I was kinda expecting Graves to pull something like this. Now, this is most likely out-of-context, but I don&#39;t see it as anything else than a rebellion against Pickles.<br><br><b>[02:25]</b> Now <a href="http://imgur.com/a78792dc-e034-4ea7-bd14-f6087f2d0c67">THESE</a> I really hope are Lethifolds! I&#39;ve been promised a Lethifold and I will get it!<br><br><br><br><br>So yeah, those are my observations. Let the discussion begin!</p>

            <p>While looking up fanfics that would quallify for a good mission I stumbled across one called  <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11512609/1/Britannia">Britannia</a> Which is a 54 chapter suefic involving a country whose meant to be a child of Arthur(aph UK/England) while dating Alfred(Aph US/America) who got adopted by Arthur at one point and technically is her brother. <br><br>It&#39;s bad and when I get permission chances are this will end up being a multipart mission. However the thing that stood out to me was the castle that the sue has for her home. It&#39;s a castle which is completely ruby colored and apparently is made of either glass or a glass like material. Which somehow was kept hidden from her despite it taking years to build. <br>At first I misread it as a castle made entirely of rubies. <br><br>And I wonder,what other strange materials have gary stus,mary sues,and airy oohs used for buildings in fanfics?  So,what kind of architectural nightmares have you all seen? </p>

If so, then how did Charlotte&#39;s stunt accomplish that?</p>

It felt a lot like TOS, with the sense that they&#39;re a) angry on behalf of the canon/good writing, rather than because they&#39;re ~*sUfFeRrInG*~, and b) genuinely happy to be <i>in</i> the canon.

            <p>While the badfic was indeed beige as heck, Ix and a very lively Charlotte more than made up for it.

            <p>It&#39;s going to be interesting to see what you do with Ix and Charlotte.

            <p>It doesn’t feel like you rushed to get into the mission, so I call this progress from previous stories. <br><br>(Typo detected: <i><b>er</b> uniform came in two pieces</i>.)<br><br>(PPC canon error detected: The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_report">mission report</a> is what you are just writing. What lucky agents get to read before they go on a mission – while unlucky agents are just sent in not knowing what to expect – is an &quot;intelligence report&quot; or &quot;Intel report&quot;.) <br><br>But then you rush through the mission. I don’t agree with other comments that the fic is too short for a mission, but we definitely need more description of what Kelly sees and we need to listen to her thoughts. Just for fun, I’ll list what I spot (not being a native speaker, not knowing the canon, and giving the dialogue some leeway for writing the accent of future pirate folks) and what I would do about it.<br><br>1. Ambiguously misspelled title &quot;Little Treasuer&quot; (Might be made a running gag: Every other paragraph, Kelly tries to spot the little treasure or to figure out who might be meant to be the little treasurer. Alas, it doesn’t work, because the writer repeated the title in the fic’s first line, and there it is definitely &quot;Little Treasure&quot;. Question to more experienced PPCers:  Is there a legitimate way to ignore an in-fic title line?) <br><br>2. My eyes wonder around our house (No idea. Guessing the right spelling and then taking the &quot;wandering eyes&quot; literally is probably not an option. If Kelly doesn’t see anything weird, she may wonder what eyes &quot;wondering around a house&quot; should look like.)<br><br>3. You know the rules, no sitting to the counter. (I’m not a native speaker. Is &quot;sitting to the counter&quot; synonymous to &quot;sitting on the counter&quot; or to &quot;sitting at the counter&quot; or something totally different? In the second case, Kelly may see Jenna in two places at the same time, or rapidly moving between &quot;sitting on the counter&quot; and &quot;sitting at the counter&quot;.)<br><br>4. Speaking of witch (Kelly spots a witch in the room. I guess <i>Treasure Planet</i> doesn’t have witches, so what the witch does and whether she looks like a Disney witch or a Harry Potter witch or somebody else depends on the canons Kelly knows.)<br><br>5. Dropping the plats she was holding. (Probably just a misspelled &quot;plates&quot;, not a homophone. My dictionary doesn’t know &quot;plats&quot;.)<br><br>6. The other on looks at me. (Is there a third robot cop who is &quot;off”?)<br><br>7. I run up to my door and push my ear agents it. (&quot;Agents of the PPC! What are you doing here? This is my badfic to spork!&quot;)<br><br>8. its din heard enough keeping this place a flout be myself (Several lines may be spent on an inner monologue while Kelly tries to figure out what she just heard. &quot;be myself&quot; is probably just talking like a pirate – a language doubly foreign to me – but whose din [retranslating German translations: shenanigans, hubbub, hullabaloo, row, slapstick, ballyhoo, fuss, riot, racket, uproar] is Jenna’s mother talking about, what did it hear and how is a din even able to hear something, who made the Benbow Inn a flout [insult, offense, scathe, affront, defamation, indignity, derision, jeer, mockery, ridicule, scoff, taunt] and why would somebody want to keep it that? Confusing the agent will certainly be one of the charges.) <br><br>9. but its never his fault (Again with the missing apostrophe. No idea what to do with whoever’s never – it’s not a noun.)<br><br>I don’t see how you got from &quot;a flout&quot; to flutes, and I didn’t spot a door wearing pants, but that may be my different perception of a language I didn’t grow up with.<br><br>One last thing: <i>She wondered just how a writer could use so many homophones and expect her story to be read.</i><br>Please don’t. We talk about stories, not about their writers.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I actually could see the mission working if you approached it less from the premise of Sue-fic and more from the premise of grammatical mess.  That&#39;s a good point to make; while I get the sense that most people focus more on bad characterization than bad grammar and spelling in their missions, it&#39;s certainly not mandatory.  Or perhaps I&#39;m biased, as I tend to avoid badfic that&#39;s completely unreadable on a technical level.  </p>

            <p>You had some good ideas here that I wish you&#39;d gone more in detail with. The part where you described the problems with the fic seemed a little rushed, especially after the loving detail paid to Kelly&#39;s getting dressed. I would have really liked to see the quote that led to a door wearing pants and the other odd ways the Word World interpreted the fic. You implied that there were a lot of funny mistakes with homophones -- it would have been more fun to see them rather than just hear about them. And to see Kelly&#39;s reaction to them. Did they make her mission more difficult? <br><br>You have interesting ideas, and I like that you write for unusual fandoms, but I think you need to work on structuring your missions. If I may make a suggestion, I&#39;d recommend trying to line up a cowrite. One can learn a lot from collaborating with more experienced writers.<br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>Honestly, while the fic as written has the <i>bones</i> of badfic, I don&#39;t think it really has enough content to qualify.  It&#39;s not even 500 words long, and covers a single scene.  In general, I&#39;d try to pick longer fic, or at least ones that have more actual content, because it gives you more to work with.<br><br>Also, your mission needs more content as well.  Short missions are fine, not everything needs to be a multi-part epic, but this is shorter than most Permission prompts and takes about ten minutes of actual time.  There&#39;s no tension or humor or anything else that makes it enjoyable to read - or, presumably, write.  The fact that it&#39;s a solo mission means there isn&#39;t even any inter-character banter.  I have to wonder what inspired you to write this in the first place, because it feels rather obligatory, like you&#39;re writing this because you have to rather than because you want to.</p>

            <p>What was it about this fic that made you think it would be a good option?  That&#39;s not intended as a criticism, but an honest question.  It can be easier to help you find what you&#39;re looking for if we know what kind of qualities you&#39;re seeking out.<br><br>Scrolling the Unclaimed Badfic list can be a good way to find something that qualifies, though it only tends to turn up results from PPC-popular fandoms.  If you want to find a fandom that tends to be missioned less, you might be out of luck.  The other thing I&#39;d recommend is, if you&#39;re just browsing FF.net, putting a filter on the length.  Anything shorter than 1000 words probably won&#39;t have enough content to actually spork, and even that&#39;s pushing it, whereas anything too long could be unwieldy.  And in general, try to pick one that seems like an opportunity for writing humorous scenes for your agents.  You can find the worst fanfiction ever, but if you can&#39;t turn it into something entertaining, then it&#39;s not a good choice for a mission.</p>

            <p>First of all, jumping the gun on Skarm is not cool. While he could&#39;ve phrased things better, what you did was pretty rude (not to mention detrimental to the quality of your mission). You should, at least, apologise to him.<br><br>That being said, there are also things to say about the mission itself:<br>-Frankly, the badfic isn&#39;t bad enough. It&#39;s too short and consists of &quot;Jim has an uncanon little sister&quot; and nothing else. Remember — the PPC is about making funny (good) stories out of bad ones, not pointing at stories and saying &quot;that&#39;s bad&quot;. Having an uncanon relative isn&#39;t bad in and of itself — cf. <a href="https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/big-sister-40k.174355/">this</a> WH40K x [secret] fic (the usual &quot;this is WH40K, grimderp ahoy&quot; warning applies, of course). Other words, there isn&#39;t enough substance in the fic.<br><br>-Related to that, &quot;is an uncanon relative&quot; isn&#39;t grounds for assassination, since it doesn&#39;t automatically make a character Suvian.<br><br>-The mission itself lacks the proper &quot;buildup, climax, resolve&quot; curve that most stories have. It&#39;s basically &quot;Kelly went in, killed an OC, got out&quot;, except told in 311 words instead of eight. <br><br>-There are a couple small errors here and there — things that a SPaG beta would&#39;ve caught, probably.<br><br>To be completely frank, I agree with Skarm: I think this mission should be taken down for revisions.</p>

            <p>Yes, the second beta should be gotten before posting if they were needed. However, yes, there is absolutely a point to &quot;correcting mistakes&quot; after posting. There are definitely missions that have been taken down for betaing/editing/reworking, both recently and over the last year--I could probably name some of the authors and reasons, if I thought about it. There is *every* point to acknowledging concrit, taking your story down, and reworking it into something better. That&#39;s part of being a writer (who posts online, anyway; once you&#39;ve published something on paper, it&#39;s rather harder to take it off the market for editing. On the internet, though, you have a good deal more opportunity to edit).<br><br>So, yes, sufficient betaing should be done before posting. However, there is *definitely* a point to taking down a story to be edited. It&#39;s a, a learning process, and b, how you get better writing, which is a big part of the PPC. We&#39;re a writing community, no? Missions are all about writing critique and making good writing out of bad writing, no? (And some other stuff, but those are key points). So editing a mission, even if it&#39;s already been posted? Absolutely there is a point. Absolutely. There is every point.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I did not give you the greenlight to post this mission, despite my feedback, and on top of that you haven&#39;t consulted with a second beta who would probably be better at it and less busy than me anyway.

            <p>Which wouldn&#39;t have been until after you got help from a second beta. Though I must admit that it was partly my fault, too, since I was too distracted by many other things to remind you of that. ^^;<br><br>Apart from that, though, apology accepted. Remember, beta reading is as important in the process of mission writing as, well, the writing itself; the latter is obvious, but it&#39;s the former that makes our missions so well-written and entertaining to read.

            <p>I know that in a lot of communities, applying to be a writer is just a formality, but we take the Permission process rather seriously (since we&#39;re mocking bad writing, we have to be sure that we aren&#39;t writing anything bad ourselves). It&#39;s very common to be asked to rework your Permission prompts several times before your spinoff becomes canon. And since currently all you have is a character bio (and not a terribly thorough one at that), I don&#39;t imagine you&#39;ll be done in time to participate in this project (Ix writes <i>fast</i>). But I wish you the best of luck in the process.<br><br>--Key hasn&#39;t even applied yet, though, so take what she says with a grain of salt.</p>

            <p>But, our members used to largely come from the fanfiction community, and were already writers when they decided to join the PPC. That&#39;s less true now, with the majority of our members finding us via TV Tropes (according to the last few censuses). The learning curve is a bit steeper when you&#39;re learning to write generally in addition to learning the PPC.<br><br>(Incidentally, Key, I think you should go ahead and apply if you feel the urge.

            <p>One wonders how and why it got started. Is it the Equestrian MiB? A decision of the monster hunting agency <s>Bon Bon</s> Secret Agent Sweetie Drops was part of? Also, how does it work? Is it the PPC with only ponies? Is it some kind of Equestrian defence force, and only covers MLP fics? Does it cover all of My Little Pony, or just Friendship is Magic? Do they cover Equestria Girls?<br><br>I&#39;m personally leaning toward Equestrian Defence Force, a PPC like organization, but only defends Equestria from Mary Sues and the like. <br><br>(And it may or may not have been established post-PPC civil war, when the organization falls apart and a few particular agents desire to make sure Sues don&#39;t run amok, and so agents teach each world how to defend itself from within, using their experience in the field to make a specialized strike team in whatever canon they find themselves stuck in.)<br><br>Yeah, on second thought, that might be a little Sue-like itself. Still, it could work as a kind of cryptic back story.<br><br>And yes, I have been thinking about this a while. The PPC civil war fascinates me. I intended to write a lot of stories in that setting. I thought long and hard what each of my agents would be doing, and how they would respond. I just never got around to writing anything.</p>

            <p>Tomash and Peregrin were in their RC, enjoying some downtime. Peregrin was reading a book with a stack of sticky notes nearby; as far as he was concerned, sticky notes were a massive improvement over notes in the margins or keeping a separate note leaf organized. <br><br>Tomash&#39;s fingers were running furiously over the keyboard on the console. He&#39;d started trying to &quot;fix&quot; it about five minutes after he first used it and declared that &quot;it just didn&#39;t feel right&quot;. The console didn&#39;t mind this, since it liked the attention.<br><br>There was a knock at the door. &quot;Moment!&quot; Tomash yelled towards the door. He took a moment to save and collect his thoughts, then made his way over to open the door, which was a bit tricky due to a half-finished remodeling effort Peregrin had started before Tomash had been partnered with.<br><br>When he opened the door, $someone was standing outside and looking somewhat nervous. &quot;Hi,&quot; they said, &quot;my parter and I are looking for people to help with a mass exorcism of the Everfree Forest?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sorry, an exorcism of the what?&quot; Tomash asked. He then added, &quot;Oh yeah. I&#39;m Tomash. Forgot to introduce myself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hi as well. I&#39;m $someone. $someone_else and I will need to exorcise the Everfree Forest. You know, from <i>My Little Pony</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve never seen that show, but I heard it&#39;s pretty good. That not gonna be a problem, is it? Also, I&#39;m pretty new, so maybe you should ask my partner Peregrin...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nah. Don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ll be fine. All you really have to do is stand somewhere and ring a bell a bunch. Maybe shout something to expel the Stu.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Cool. I can do that. Just mail me the details. I&#39;m <tt>tom@rcfibs[0..5]!dms</tt>&quot; Tomash said, somehow pronouncing the monospace. Then he had a sudden realization. &quot;Wait. We should probably get my partner in on this.&quot; He turned around and yelled &quot;Yo, Peregrin! There&#39;s someone here and they need people for a mass exorcism.&quot;<br><br>Peregrin closed his book, startled. &quot;A mass exorcism? I&#39;ve heard of such things, but I don&#39;t believe that one has been performed for many years. There was some well-known case involving a merger with a planet, but I don&#39;t remember the details. I should check those ...&quot; He trailed off and started heading for the bookshelf.<br><br>&quot;You can check the history later. I don&#39;t think this guy wants to wait all day for you to flip through old mission reports.&quot;<br><br>Peregrin then changed course and wandered over toward the door. &quot;What canon did you say this was occurring in, again? I was rather distracted and didn&#39;t hear you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Everfree Forest in <i>My Little Pony</i>&quot;, replied the agent at the door. They were rather relieved that no one was shouting at them or slamming the door in their face.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not familiar with that work,&quot; Peregrin began cautiously, &quot;but I don&#39;t believe exorcism rituals require a familiarity. I haven&#39;t performed any yet, so I can&#39;t back that up with experiment. It might be good for me, er, for us, to do.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ll do great! Like I said to your partner, all you really need to do is stand somewhere, ring a bell a bunch, and yell something about banishing uncanon. There&#39;ll be enough people that we won&#39;t need to get it perfect.&quot;<br><br>Peregrin turned to his partner and asked &quot;Tomash, could you get the bells from two-down-one-right?&quot;<br><br>The agent quickly added &quot;You don&#39;t need those right now. We&#39;re not starting for at least a few days since we need time to get everyone together. We&#39;ll ping your console when it&#39;s time.&quot;<br><br>Tomash, who was already near the bells, grabbed one of Peregrin&#39;s sticky notes and scrawled on &quot;TODO: fix console ping.&quot; He then took the bells anyway, to save himself the bother of trying to find them later.<br><br>The agent had started to leave. Before she closed the door, Peregrin held up the set of exorcism bells an old inhabitant of 112358 has left behind and asked &quot;Are these the right bells?&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Yeah.&quot; said the retreating agent, who was copying &quot;Peregrin and Tomash&quot; from the sign by the door. &quot;Those&#39;re the ones!&quot;<br><br>After the door closed, Peregrin started to think out loud in a quiet mutter. &quot;That&#39;s good. I think I&#39;ll need to modify the usual rituals to apply to uncanon influences instead of generally disruptive ones. But first I&#39;m going to need to find the history of this sort of thing, so I can do it properly.&quot; This train of thought led Peregrin directly to a loose collection of pages titled &quot;∑ M.R. Idx&quot;, which he scanned for an entry on mass exorcisms. <br><br>Followup research resulted in three requests that Tomash search the mission report database since he was already at the console and a trip to Supply because the printer ran out of paper. After Peregrin was eventually satisfied with his general understanding of exorcisms, he took several cracks at arranging an &#39;appropriate&#39; tune for the exorcism. He wasn&#39;t much good as a composer, but he was working off of established material, so the final result came out sounding better than horrible, as far as Peregrin (and Tomash) could tell.</p>

            <p>Name: Trevor Australis.<br>Species: Human male.<br>Home Continuum: Terraria.<br>Age: 30.<br>RC#: 420.<br><br>Appearance: Trevor usually wears a white trench coat, a grey undershirt, grey pants, white shoes, and a pair of blue headphones with white decorations. He is slightly dark-skinned, has black hair, and has brown-ish eyes. He is fairly tall.<br><br>Powers: He is the Terraria equivalent of a Diplomancer (a wizard that has diplomacy-related powers).<br><br>Personality: Pretty normal. He gets along well with some people, and that&#39;s partly because of his diplomancy. He&#39;s dedicated to his job at the DoSAT.<br><br>History: First, you&#39;re going to have to read some of this: <a href="http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Terraria_Wiki"><a href="http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Terraria_Wiki">http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Terraria_Wiki</a></a><br><br>The Martians&#39; attack on Terraria brought the people there the Internet. The people were amazed by it. Soon Terraria&#39;s technology improved at an alarming rate.<br><br>Then they discovered the fandoms. What happened was a mirror of what happened on the Real World when the idea of fandoms was introduced. So some scientists decided to build a portal to the multiverse. Trevor was one of them. <br><br>But they didn&#39;t have enough materials. Well, until the Moon Lord died. Luminite and Celestial Fragments were surprisingly good catalysts for multidimensional travel.<br><br>Cue the official opening of the Terrarian Multiversal Portal. The people went in, and were extremely amazed. But with fandoms, came badfic. And with badfic, came Sues.<br><br>But with Sues, came the PPC. The people knew the PPC were heroes. Especially Trevor.<br><br>A few months later, he asked permission to the scientists to join the PPC. They said yes, because there was nothing to worry about in their continuum.<br><br>Then Trevor configured the portal to HQ. He went in, knowing that he&#39;d already left a legacy on his home continuum. He knew that his work was done there, and the PPC would be a bigger challenge.<br><br>After he went in, the portal closed.<br><br>Trevor and the other scientists were to be remembered as great people by Terraria&#39;s inhabitants.</p>

            <p>No. Just… no.<br><br>This character doesn&#39;t work in many ways. Desdendelle has already touched on several major points (what is a Diplomancer, uninteresting personality, major errors in PPC canon), so I will specifically look at <i>Terraria</i> canon issues.<br><br>The big one is that <i>Terraria</i> itself… doesn&#39;t really have a story. Or a unified world, really. The only true canon to <i>Terraria</i> is detail-based: what the monsters are like, what the NPCs are like, and so on. Much like <i>Minecraft</i>, the only story is &#39;kill the bosses.&#39; This character might as well not be from <i>Terraria</i>.<br><br>Are you trying to claim that the NPCs are the &#39;inhabitants?&#39; Because that is a stretch I cannot buy. And how can <i>Terraria</i> get the Internet if they don&#39;t even have computers? Their most advanced technology is wires hooked up to pumps and sensors.<br><br>But let&#39;s put that aside. Let&#39;s say that <i>Terraria</i> has a fully fleshed-out world. You&#39;ve given knowledge of the PPC to an entire universe! That&#39;s bad both in-universe (the PPC&#39;s trying to be secret here) and out (it suggests that you don&#39;t quite get what we as a group are about).<br><br>You want my opinion? Scrap this character. Begin from the ground up. Make multiple characters as thought exercises. Like Des said, that might help you see what makes a character interesting.</p>

            <p>-PPC knowledge is lacking. DoSAT has no RCs and its technicians usually don&#39;t go on missions.<br>-What is a Diplomancer and why is Trevor one?<br>-Personality section is too short and also lacking. &quot;Normal and gets well along with some people&quot; feels like a cardboard cutout than an interesting character.<br>-Having to read a wiki article and still not understand a third of the words you&#39;ve used in the profile is bad. Assume that the Permission Giver reading your request (and the people reading your spinoff) don&#39;t know an awful lot about the canon at hand.<br>-Having your agent actually affect the canon (and not come from a fanfic) makes him a bit too Suvian for comfort.<br><br>I think you&#39;re doing this wrong, and I think I have an exercise that can help you: instead of making an agent from Terraria, try — as an exercise, you don&#39;t have to use the resultant character in anything — to make an agent from World One, who arrived in the PPC via a generic plothole. I think this will force you to think about what makes them an interesting character instead of their powers or canon of origin or whatnot.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure of the Ancient Greek translations.

            <p>I&#39;ve enjoyed the <s>inter</s><i>pre</i>lude, though it&#39;s a bit on the short-ish side; I kinda expected a bit more interaction between Apollo and Kelly. Other than, I don&#39;t really have anything to say.</p>

            <p>There was a very quiet, subtle sense of humour throughout the whole thing - even the absurdity of Kelly running into the direct opposite of her RC has a certain dry calmness, which I quite like. (I also just like that joke in general) <br>Hell, even the [BEEEEEEEEP] joke has that quality, what with the punchline being a cynical comment, as opposed to any other number of possibilities. Normally the kind of joke you&#39;d expect to be very loud, y&#39;know? <br><br>You&#39;ve also done a good job of introducing the various characteristics of the agents, from Apollo being in pitch-black and fine with it, to Kelly being delighted at archery equipment. Very showy, without telly, y&#39;know? <br>As Ix said, of course, some&#39;ve the dialogue&#39;s a bit expositiony. <br><br>Let&#39;s see what the three year mark&#39;ll bring...</p>

            <p>I like the idea of a daughter of Apollo and a Green Arrow expy working together. That was clever. <br><br>I&#39;ll be on the lookout for more from these two. <br>Quivering with anticipation, really.</p>
