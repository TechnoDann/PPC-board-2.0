            <p>So, bored at school and was poking around for Mary Sue and OFUM stuff and found this! Of course, I&#39;m always interested in trying to help people make their writing better and couldn&#39;t resist joining here! I&#39;m pretty much an open book, so wanting to know something? Ask! Chances are I won&#39;t bite... Much at least.</p>

However, it&#39;s not super-useful on Dragalge, primarily you want to be running Adaptability on it because Draco Meteor kills everything that isn&#39;t a Fairy. Grab a Calm-natured one and Super Train it in HP, Special Defence, and a little bit of Speed to outspeed Hippowdon. For moves, you&#39;ll want Draco Meteor, Sludge Bomb, Toxic Spikes, and Scald to spread burns - physical attackers don&#39;t like that at all. Most importantly, though, remember to have fun. =]</p>

            <p>I&#39;d like to be more elaborate, but that&#39;s just too spectacular and great for me. Congratulations with this one Sergio. Hope the sequel won&#39;t inherit from the spot in Devlopment Hell.</p>

            <p>I created the original planning document in August 2012, one year and half before starting to write the first chapter - and even then, I created the document in order to keep in order the ideas I already had - so perhaps late 2011 or early 2012, which means I&#39;ve been planning this story for two full years before starting to write it.<br><br>The backstory up until a certain point<br><br>SPOILER<br><br><s>Faith&#39;s death</s><br><br>/SPOILER<br><br>is a badfic that does indeed exist and Sergio is indeed from it - that one started in 2006 and was abandoned in 2010 so we can say that, in a way, the true spark point for Blank Sprite was actually set ten years ago.<br><br>The happenings in between are actually partially based on scrapped story and/or character ideas originally unrelated to my PPC spinoff. They helped me fill the time gap between the point where Mai Dire Fine ended (2007 in-universe) and when I had already claimed Sergio to be recruited (2009)<br><br>Every single &quot;Turbo&quot; I mentioned actually existed, however, some were never published (I didn&#39;t even HAVE a computer, much less an Internet connection, when I originally wrote First Turbo) and there are others that never got more than a few lines and so were never counted as an actual Turbo. The actual count might be 8-9, maybe even ten of them.<br><br>Actually, Agent!Sergio was indeed supposed to be the sixth, and a different person from the third - them being one and the same was a retcon I made around my third mission as I thought it would&#39;ve been more interesting. Coming up with a way to justify him ending up in the PPC was what gave me the idea for Blank Sprite, but I only came up with the proper plot after watching Puella Magi Madoka Magica.<br><br>And, by the way, I&#39;m actually planning to spork one of the other Turbos. I found Fourth Turbo&#39;s story still around on the net (no links - it&#39;s in Italian, so I doubt anyone here is actually able to read it), and I think it&#39;s missionable so I&#39;m doing that as part of my future spinoff.</p>

            <p>Yes, that&#39;s a very odd request, I know. If you read my last <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hNgtHU8T-hkT9JI_yQElK5E1u-0dbdIF7UCVpKQyo_8/pub">mission</a> (*cough*shamelessplug*cough*) then you know why. If not, well, the fic kind of spawned a sentient Elvish cantaloupe. More specifically, a Sleep Mellon. The Sleep Mellon is free-to-use, and I&#39;m currently making the page for it, but I want the picture to be of--you guessed it--pointed Elven ears attached to a common cantaloupe. The problem is that I don&#39;t know how to use a photo editor. <br><br>Like, at all. <br><br>It doesn&#39;t have to be perfect (far from it, I was going to use <a href="http://www.californiacantaloupes.com/sites/all/themes/ccab2013/images/selecting/cantaloupe-hero.jpg">this melon</a> and photoshop <a href="http://www.ocostumes.com/htc/1619532.jpg">these ears</a> onto it), but I can&#39;t even make it imperfectly. I don&#39;t think this is too big a request to make of someone--I could be wrong, because, as I said, I have no idea how to use photo editors--so would anyone mind attaching ears to a cantaloupe and adding it to the page I&#39;m just about to create (by which I mean all typed out and ready to post immediately)?<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Yeah that works. I think I&#39;ve worked out why the other link wasn&#39;t working for me, it seems that the website makes an advert play automatically before you can access the avatar creator and so my adblock was blocking both the ad and the creator from loading (and for some reason wouldn&#39;t let me unblock it), so I had to resort to Internet Explorer to try it... *shudder*<br><br>Thanks once again</p>

            <p>Do you have the ability to spend roughly Ј5 on it? It&#39;s not as awesome as being a subscriber for the game, but I&#39;ve found being Preferred Status really makes the game playable and mitigates the majority of the issues F2P people have. You also get 5 or 6 character slots (up from the F2P 2).<br><br>In terms of storylines, on the Empire&#39;s side, I&#39;ve got to admit that SI is my favourite (and also the first one I completed), BH is good for the first two acts but Act 3 isn&#39;t as good IMO. IA I&#39;m stuck with the &#39;Darth Zhorrid Arrives&#39; bug so I can&#39;t get past the prologue, and the SW storyline is the one I&#39;m currently working on. For the Republic, I&#39;ve only actually completed JK, but I&#39;ve got to admit playing as the Smuggler is really fun. I have started a playthrough with the Trooper but the play style is too similar to the BH so I kinda gave up on it and haven&#39;t picked it up since. As for JC I&#39;ve literally just finished Tython with mine today, but whilst the play style is interesting the story hasn&#39;t grabbed me yet.<br></p>

            <p>There&#39;s a certain amount of money you have to put into the game (I think it&#39;s around $5 or more, but I got it when I got 2400 Cartel Coins (so that was just under $20)), and that&#39;s it, next time you log in you&#39;ve got the Preferred Status. If you want to get a race besides Human, Cyborg or Zabrak they cost 600 Cartel Coins, but I haven&#39;t worked out how you get to the Market outside of the game so it looks like you have to create a character, get them to level 10 (I think it&#39;s level 10 you need to access the market), buy the race in the Cartel Market and then start a story off with them.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br><br>P.S If there&#39;s anything else you want to know, ask and I&#39;ll try my best to answer. </p>

            <p>IA HAS THE BEST STORYLINE EVER. I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed the plot twists, and the irony, and AAAAH IT WAS SO GOOD!<br><br>JC... Yeah, that one is slow to start, but once you get to Act 2, the story becomes really interesting. I love Qyzen Fess, he&#39;s a very interesting companion. JK is basically a typical Star Wars story, but it&#39;s not bad.<br><br>SI is my least favorite, and here&#39;s why: The trailers for the Inquisitor suggests that your storyline is going to have you be like Sideous. And you&#39;re not. You become a holocron-tracking ghostbuster. And you have to act like an idiot who doesn&#39;t guess what Zash is up to when it&#39;s painstakingly clear that her intentions regarding you are bad. EPIC FAIL. The only thing I liked is that you start as a slave and have to work to greatness, which is refreshing given how the other Force storylines treat you as a talented student straightaway. And you have a ghostly ancestor visiting you 24/7. That&#39;s cool.<br><br>SW? Hello awesomeness. You get to confront your Opposite Reflection in the desert (an awesome little addition that I will love forever), become a powerhouse, become the Wrath (a position that Lord Scourge from the JK line also had, actually) get to meet the Emperor&#39;s Hand, and the Emperor himself (through the Voice)! And so on.<br><br>BH is fun - Mandalorian all the way, baby! Smuggler is hilarious - and I like that you get the option to become something of a privateer for the Republic.<br><br>Honestly, I don&#39;t understand why people hate the Trooper class so much. They say, &quot;It&#39;s so boooring!&quot; to which I reply, &quot;Uh, hey guys, <i>you are playing a soldier.</i> Thus you take orders and don&#39;t rebel against the authorities unless you seriously have a death wish.&quot; Is anyone else with me on this? Also, come on, <i>Jennifer Hale</i> voices the Female Trooper!<br><br>And I got all that from just watching playthroughs of the storylines.</p>

            <p>Yes, he&#39;s retired, but that doesn&#39;t stop him crashing in and overruling the DOGA pick. Agent Huinesoron is getting quite ticked off.<br><br>He plays the harp. <i>Every year</i>. I mean, he plays it very well, but it&#39;s starting to get on everyone&#39;s nerves.<br><br>-The DOOCH are in it, of course; this year they&#39;re bringing the Buds and Sprouts to form a Children&#39;s Choir. Unfortunately Maly and Dagger aren&#39;t very good at teaching singing, so the quality is... lacking. But everyone gives them a couple of points just to be nice.<br><br>-The DoDAEG is represented entirely by CAL-9000. His &#39;song&#39; consists of standing on stage complaining until he gets kicked off, then he gives <i>null point</i> to everyone on principle.<br><br>-The DCPS is a bit bonkers; their songs tend towards the flamboyant, with occasional pressganged canon characters in the mix. (Some members of) FicPsych are arguing that they should be allowed to give negative points to penalise them for abusing the canons.<br><br>-The Department of Transdimensional Snatching and the Department of Transdimensional Hopping have somehow managed to become separate teams, despite &quot;currently and temporarily&quot; (according to the Hopping team) being folded together as Despatch. They always give each other 12 points. Sometimes they even send the same agents to sing.<br><br>-The Department of Redundancy Department is forbidden from participating, ever since they took an entire evening to introduce their team. It was a rough year.<br><br>-Nutmeg TV of course broadcasts the whole thing. And it is glorious.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Coming as an American who&#39;s followed the contest intermittently since 2009 (thanks Alexander Rybak) I can&#39;t say I know every last nuance of the thing but:<br><br>Eurovision is an annual contest held by the European Broadcasting Union, hosted in the country that has won the last year&#39;s contest. The weird thing about Eurovision these recent years is that Australia has been competing as well (but then the countries Israel and Turkey have also done so sooooo).<br><br>Basically each country participating that year sends a song and in a series of two semifinals they find twenty songs to send to the grand final. The winning country from last year automatically qualifies for the grand final the next year, as well as the countries of the &quot;Big Five&quot;, which are Germany, UK, France, Spain, and Italy. These six are added onto the twenty from the semifinal. <br><br>The Grand Final has two parts, the first being all twenty six countries singing their songs. Then all of the participating (even if they don&#39;t make it to the final) countries vote on their favourites. It used to be that the televoting (popular) vote was combined with the votes from the professional juries on a scale of 1-12, but this year they rolled out a new system where the professional juries and the popular votes are counted, presented, and weighed separately. <br><br>However, Eurovision is known to be a glitter-filled camp-fest of songs that are usually kinda terrible, combined with unforgettably wacky performances (such as Ukraine&#39;s in 2007, Finland&#39;s in 2006, Poland&#39;s in 2014, Russia&#39;s in 2012, that one time Ireland sent a turkey puppet as an act, etc). The other well-known aspect of Eurovision is how politicised the voting tends to get (until maybe now with the new voting system?). Neighbouring countries vote for each other, Russia tends to get votes from former Soviet satellite states, the UK gives Ireland points but Ireland doesn&#39;t give UK points -- basically it&#39;s Europe&#39;s new way of airing grievances instead of going to war, and it is endlessly entertaining.<br><br>I was just wondering what the HQ equivalent would look like, because I&#39;d be entertained by the thought of Bad Slash sending Luxury every year.<br></p>

            <p>Lately I&#39;ve noticed that the PPC-related stuff took priority in my life, and that&#39;s not really how it should go. If I continue this, I&#39;m definitely going to lose interest in the whole thing, and/or make myself insufferable to others. I see it slowly starting to emerge, so I should probably nip it in the bud.<br><br>(Sorry, Voyd, I&#39;m gonna have to back away from the Karaoke RP. Maybe next time.)<br><br>Therefore, I&#39;m gonna take a month-or-so break from anything remotely connected to the PPC. Starting now. I&#39;ll get back once my finals are done, which is July 12th. I&#39;ll still be available for emails, if anyone feels like talking. But that&#39;s it for now.<br><br><img src="http://cache3.asset-cache.net/gc/508471157-out-of-office-gone-on-vacation-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=tOK7%2BPP508x30WE2EuqsUj44kB5a4H1KaZKPxDDiO1RJQCnNk5%2FEkn8emp3XpyzX"><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m honestly not sure who won. I was leaning toward Gordon up until the last round, and then Julia really hit it out of the park. Her last lines are perfect. <sup>_<sup><br><br>Gordon</sup></sup> Ramsay is awesome, though. If you watch enough of his shows, you realize he&#39;s actually a pretty good guy, and he only turns the rage up to eleven when he needs to and/or when the directors/producers want him to. I&#39;ve noticed that he&#39;s a lot shoutier on American TV than he was on British TV.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

This means it&#39;s pretty great on a &#39;mon like Remoraid, since it allows you to do amazing damage with Water Spout, which is by far its best move.

Most importantly, have fun! =]<br><br>As for your fic, well... I can&#39;t really help you. I&#39;ve never seen an episode of Arpeggion of Blue Steel, though the name does ring a bell, but what I can say is that your SPaG needs a lot of work. You&#39;re making povs, and this is a bad thing (though povs are cute and go <i>snrf</i>); especially in fanfic, we should <i>know</i> who&#39;s talking and who&#39;s point of view it is via a line break or similar scene change indicator. =]</i></i></p>

            <p>Though now I&#39;m wondering, what are Sigalorians like?

Hmmm... *scuttles off to get her conspiracy notebook*<br><br>...also, why is she introduced here (as in, on the Board) as Lena Swift when it looks like she&#39;s going to go by Hop for the rest of her appearances? Just kind of threw me for a loop when she suddenly changed her name. <br><br>Also, not anything wrong with this, but it felt like it took Swift/Hop a very long time to realize the Guardsman is a Time Lord, considering he introduced himself as &quot;of Gallifrey&quot;.

            <p>The Sigalorians... well, they&#39;re more like headcanon. Since the Whoniverse is inhabited by many, many, many species, we&#39;ve agreed with ST to take some liberties with inventing them. He saw them are more Silurian-like, whilst I was imagining something akin to WoW&#39;s King Mukla...it resulted in them being a mixture of both.<br><br><s>Hop&#39;s a Cockney, Will was born in Liverpool but spent a lot of time in London, so not as much related as picked up the same habits. And I was trying to give Hop a sort of Hagrid&#39;s speech. Will is gonna talk more normal :)</s> <br><br>Never mind, I shall not destroy your conspiracy!<br><br>Hmm...yeah, I can see that. I wanted to show how she can easily lose concentration, and go over to a completely different matter in span of seconds, but also didn&#39;t want to leave the &quot;Ka-boom/Psshht&quot; joke from the early drafts. Might&#39;ve stretch the whole thing too much, though :/  <br><br>Fixed. Thanks for noticing!</p>

            <p>...though most of them will merely be spectating. The ones who will be singing will be Falc, Rayner, and possibly Cupid and Lapis. I&#39;m a pretty good singer so I guess Falc would be as well, Rayner comes from a continuum with a lot of musical numbers, the canon Pit (and thus Cupid by extension) is voiced by someone who used to be a part of Kidz Bop, and I figure this would give me a good opportunity for Lapis to break out one of her prized possessions: a lyre, like the one Nando uses in the Diamond/Pearl anime.</p>

            <p>Pretty much if you can build a list of traits that make a story bad and say &quot;you did this number of them and it&#39;s not funny&quot; then it&#39;s a safe bet that the story is bad.<br><br>The Name of the Wind is still enjoyable even though the main character is a giant Stu.

            <p>&quot;What&#39;s good or bad is based only on opinions, not facts.&quot;<br><br>Okay, so why is Shakespeare&#39;s poetry enjoyed by people everywhere, while my silly doggerel about my cat hasn&#39;t even been published in the school paper?<br><br>Why is it that people commonly criticize &quot;Twilight&quot; as being poorly written, but not &quot;Dracula&quot;?<br><br>Why can your high school literature teacher justify giving you a bad grade for poor writing, even if your grammar and spelling are fine?<br><br>The fact is, people judge each others&#39; writing all the time. Book critics make a living from doing it.<br><br>And there&#39;s a difference between judging quality and judging preference. &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is a very well-written book. Many people really enjoy it. I don&#39;t; I find it rather tedious to read. But I can recognize good writing when I see it; it&#39;s a well-written book, even though I don&#39;t like the genre. On the other hand, even though I absolutely love fantasy and sci-fi, I recognize &quot;Eragon&quot; as rather bad writing, a teenager&#39;s first attempt that somehow got published.<br><br>I also recognize that bad writers grow out of it. Christopher Paolini is probably going to write very well when he&#39;s had more practice, if he doesn&#39;t get a big head about having been published so young. But how is a person to know how to improve their writing if everyone says, &quot;Well, it&#39;s only my opinion, but I personally happen to dislike your work,&quot; rather than, &quot;Your characters have no realistic motivations, and your heroine is flatter than a cardboard cutout. You need to fix that&quot;?<br><br>Saying I enjoy a piece of literature, and saying I think it&#39;s well-written, are two different things. I can read &quot;A Little Princess&quot; and admit that Sara Crewe is a Mary Sue while still enjoying the book thoroughly. I can wade through fifty pages about the Paris sewers and still enjoy &quot;Les Miserables&quot;.<br><br>If we don&#39;t critique each others&#39; writing, how are we ever going to get any better at it?</p>

            <p>That argument applies to a lot of things, but not quality. Some people don&#39;t like some genres. I myself can&#39;t stand and don&#39;t read horror and tragedy. However, this is entirely separate for how good the thing is, and it&#39;s a poor reviewer indeed who mistakes their personal dislike for shoddy construction. <br><br>Also, say we assume that everything is based on opinion. You posted it to a public forum, thereby exposing it to the judgement of others, and they have judged that writing needs to follow certain rules to be acceptable. If they judge that your story does not follow these rules, then you should accept their opinion. If you really wanted only your opinion to matter, then you probably shouldn&#39;t have put it under others&#39; scrutiny.</p>

            <p>Sure, some of what&#39;s good or bad is pretty subjective. If we&#39;re targeting your story, though, we&#39;re not doing it because it&#39;s mostly competent and we just don&#39;t like the direction it&#39;s heading. We&#39;re doing it because it contains glaring problems in the building blocks of the story: characterisation (especially in characters from canon), world-building, sentence structure, plotting and pacing, among others.

            <p>Good and bad could be something subjective, however, if your story do something like turning a character who is pure good into a genocidal maniac without a credible reason, or that your &#39;writing&#39; consists of blind plagiarization of canon with badly-thought additions, you could at least ask yourself some questions. <br><br>Granted, failing at that level is pretty rare, but the fact is that there is some elements which will show your writing under a bad light, no matter the opinion.

            <p>Not-an-Agent-yet Hieronymus would be played by Ian McKellen. I like the idea.<br><br>For Androia Avatar, Buzzfeed gave me Abigail Breslin. I don’t know who this is, she definitely doesn’t look like a <i>World of Warcraft</i> night elf druid, and I realized that I need to think and do research about some questions I couldn’t really answer for Androia. Has she ever <i>been</i> in a school? What classes could she take there? Are cleaning and doing the laundry actions player characters can do? I’m sure that Androia never had a lawn to mow, and I know that she can read, but did she ever learn to write or would doing paperwork be out of question anyway? Which of the toys I have to choose from would she actually know, and did she even have a childhood, or was she spawned fully grown up at Shadowglen?<br><br>HG (probably not asking for Permission this year)</p>

            <p>Dafydd Illian would be <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/81/b0/20/81b02062a4d7c0a63d2e8dfebf1b45a6.jpg">Colin O&#39;Donoghue</a>, whom my fellow connoisseurs of televisual garbage will know as Captain Hook from that august barrel of lunacy <i>Once Upon A Time</i>. The guy who plays Killian Jones, a man for whom death really <i>is</i> like man flu, seems like a natural fit for one of those agents who came back from the dead. =]<br><br>Since it&#39;d be wrong to have one without the other (though their kids&#39;ll have to wait because life really is too short), Constance Sims is <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a3/58/85/a3588529a0913fff938ecbd352464387.jpg">Shenae Grimes</a> of <i>127 Hours</i> fame. This, I admit, is largely based on appearance, though if movie!Dafydd is hotter, then so is movie!Constance. =]<br><br>As for my agents, well... my agents might all be humanoid (with a few exceptions), but I think a PPC Movie might well require them to be CGI just because of how cartoonish they are. Anyway, here&#39;s the voice cast for my motley assortment of total weirdos.<br><br>Wobbles: <a href="http://www.gloriesworld.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/anna-faris-9.jpg">Anna Faris</a>. She has the bubbly voice for it, and I think she&#39;d be good at voice work; getting her into a fatsuit or something for a live-action performance might be trickier though. Additionally, it&#39;s worth mentioning that my first choice was Amy Poehler, but Nesh poached her, the swine. The feeeeeeelthy swine. =]<br><br>The Notary: <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/ee/a6/42/eea64239d17a75e5e2f2182069f3b2e5.jpg">Carmen Ejogo</a>. A wonderful voice that sounds old and young at the same time - a perfect mix for her. Plus, she&#39;s got experience of more emotional parts, meaning I really think she could pull off the pathos for the part; there&#39;s a lot of history for the Oncoming Form. =]<br><br>Doktor Trollenfisch: <a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/jamesbond/images/6/65/Gareth_Mallory_(Ralph_Fiennes)_-_Profile.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130508000404">Ray Fiennes</a>. Now, strangely, this part does not require an actual German to play the Doktor; rather, it requires someone willing to ham it up to a ridiculous degree and just plain old have fun with the part. Fiennes&#39; turn as Victor Quartermaine in <i>Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</i> proved he can do both. Everyone had an absolute ball making that film, and I think that&#39;s what has to shine through with the Doktor und Gabrielle.<br><br>Gabrielle: <a href="http://www.hotstarz.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AnnaSophia-Robb2.jpg">AnnaSophia Robb</a>, and yes, that is how you spell it. This is mostly on the strength of her performance in a weird little film called <i>Jack of the Red Hearts</i>, in which she displays the girlishness and grit combined that makes Gabrielle such a compelling character to write for. Small floof, many damage; perfect for Ms. Robb.<br><br>Lola McCandless: <a href="http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/35ns5Wme2fedmBqQ6qZE6iD/03ad37ab-2a0f-4605-8e06-bd632799cc85.jpg/r67_0_567_640_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg">Clare Bowen</a>. Now, American viewers probably know her from <i>Nashville</i>, assuming they know her from Adam, but she&#39;s an Australian actress and veteran of <i>Home and Away</i>. That said, I refuse to hold it against her. =]<br><br>Algernon, 7th Earl Wymbourne: <a href="http://cdn.bleedingcool.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TobyJones.jpg">Toby Jones</a>. I was exceptionally tempted to cast Eddie Marsan in this role, but Jones won out in the end. He&#39;s an immensely talented actor with an amazing presence and voice, and I think he&#39;d do well with the part - though whether or not he&#39;d enjoy going back into a <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_Nmx7NlyYLk/U8VHUkfQywI/AAAAAAAAC0w/oQiujO1ZKfY/s1600/vlcsnap-00042.png">sound studio</a> is open to debate. =]</p>

If anyone can wield a sledgehammer with serious conviction, it&#39;s her. She just seems to... fit the character a lot, especially post-snap - July&#39;s neurotic disposition covered by anger almost feels like giving Rodriguez the role would be typecasting, given her appearances in other media.<br><br>Agent Calpurnia Library: <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/81/47/f6/8147f68aff5f3fceca18feed60b2aa74.jpg">Tilda Swinton</a>.

You may know him as Henry McCoy in the recent <i>X-Men</i> movies. I can see it.<br><br>Jenni - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0688132/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Amy Poehler</a>, who I know from SNL. Iiiii dunno about this one. A comedienne wouldn&#39;t be my first choice. She&#39;s the voice of Joy in <i>Inside Out</i>, though, so that&#39;s kinda cool.<br><br>Gall - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1102577/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Elle Fanning</a>. Apparently she plays Aurora in <i>Maleficent</i>, but I haven&#39;t seen it, or anything else she&#39;s been in. She&#39;s adorable, though! Give her red hair and an evil smirk, and I can see it.<br><br>And, just for fun, I did Nume and Derik, too.<br><br>Nume - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1212722/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Benedict Cumberbatch</a>. You all know who he is, right? Excuse me, I&#39;m gonna go die laughing now. (Full disclosure: this was actually my second result for him. First time around, I came up with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252961/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Idris Elba</a>, rumored to be the next James Bond, who I think is a bit too cheerful and, as Phobos said, debonair for Nume.)<br><br>Derik - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252961/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Idris Elba</a>. ... Yeah, I don&#39;t know how this is possible, since I gave totally different answers from when I was playing as Nume, but this time I think it could work! So yeah. {X D<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s my pick: <a href="http://i2.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/the-babadook-sam.jpg">Noah Wiseman</a>. The image is a promotional still from <i>The Babadook</i>, one of the best psychological horror films in recent years and something I urge everyone to check out. This is a movie that will mess with your head for months afterwards, and that&#39;s just about the best thing a horror film can do; not on jump scares, not on gore, but purely on the strength of an oppressive atmosphere and the central performances of Wiseman and Essie Davis.<br><br>Actually, thinking about it, <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/82/a7/4e/82a74e7a23512bc704cbb6aedb5325dc.jpg">Davis</a> might make a good Jenni as well.

            <p>So, having split &quot;All-Stars&quot; and &quot;More CAH&quot; into two different decks, I am now thinking of folding them back into just &quot;More Cards Against Headquarters.&quot; I figure it&#39;s one less code to add, and if there&#39;s any risk of my favorites overwhelming everyone else&#39;s favorites, y&#39;all can always suggest more stuff.<br><br>What about folding in TOS, The Flowers - A (but not B), and FicPsych, too?<br><br>Is it better if they&#39;re separated into themed decks you can pick and choose from, or would one big deck be preferable? I want this to be good for everyone, not just me. {= )<br><br>Thanks in advance for your input!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>That was an easy-to-follow mission, and a well done execution of the Sue. Death by Canon--so rare, but sometimes so satisfying when done right. And of course, this Sue was one of the annoying in-text-A/N-to-show-off-some-incorrect-trivia Sues (First, the name you&#39;re thinking of is <i>Atalant<b>a</b></i>, not <i>Atalant<b>is</b></i>. Second, Atalanta does not <i>mean</i> &quot;mighty huntress&quot; (<a href="http://www.behindthename.com/name/atalanta">it means &quot;equal in weight&quot;</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta">she <i>was</i> a mighty huntress</a>!)<br><br>But some errors slipped through in your mission. One of which HG picked up already:<br><i> Give my partner and I your guidance, O god of thieves and merchants.</i><br>It should be &quot;my partner and <b>me&quot;: they are both the objects of the verb &quot;give&quot;.<br><br>The remaining errors are pluralization errors:<br>1)<i>Their first mission into one of the most interesting continuums (in the pair’s opinion) that they had discovered in a long while,</i><br>The plural of &quot;continuum&quot; is &quot;continua&quot;.<br><br>2)<i>So she had hidden away for over a millennia inside the Labyrinth</i><br>&quot;Millenia&quot; is plural. The correct word is &quot;a millenium&quot;.<br><br>One more thing stuck out:<br><i>That is not a bad trait, </i>Za’kiir thought.<i> It’s rather interesting. Khajiit likes it.</i><br>Is that a quirk of Za&#39;kiir&#39;s speech, or did you mean to say, &quot;Za&#39;kiir likes it&quot;?<br></b></p>

            <p>Za&#39;kiir and Natalie are so much fun to read, but there are some spelling and grammar issues:<br><br><i>Give my partner and <b>I</b> your guidance, O god of Thieves and Merchants</i>.<br>Wouldn’t &quot;Give <b>me</b> your guidance&quot; be correct? Adding another person, like &quot;my partner&quot;, shouldn’t change this. (Apparently, many people fell into the habit of saying words like &quot;My partner and me went somewhere&quot; to an extent that it began to look right because it was seen so often. Then the backlash came and had such an impact that to some people &quot;another person and me&quot; now looks wrong even when it’s right?)<br><br><i>The agents clapped along with the rest of the campers, <b>through</b> their smiles were tight —</i><br>I believe you meant &quot;though&quot;.<br><br><i>Apparently <b>none</b> of the other gods <b>couldn’t</b> stop talking about it ...</i><br>I’m not quite sure what you are trying to say there. The double negation actually says that Mr. D is the only god who couldn’t stop talking about it, but maybe that’s the reason why he wants Ally to do something? <br><br><i>How had she gotten <b>her</b>?</i> <br>If you aren’t alluding to the Sue’s weird way of thinking, this should be &quot;here&quot; (or less probably &quot;there&quot;).<br><br><i>How do you who I am?</i> <br>If this weren’t the Sue speaking, I would guess that the missing word wasn’t left out intentionally.<br><br>Yeah, I could have seen it coming, but then I didn’t. When the &quot;goddess&quot; claimed that she had been forgotten, I wondered whether she could even still exist. But since I didn’t know how this works in <i>Percy Jackson</i> canon, I dismissed the thought, because nobody could be this stupid, and forgot all about it. Surprise, surprise! Atalantis could, and found a rightful Death by Canon. <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>&quot;I say, you there... I say, you there... I say, you there...&quot;<br><br>So. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/05/11/civilization-vi-details/">Here&#39;s an article</a> discussing what&#39;s going to be in it. Some thoughts, after a quick readthrough:<br><br>-Everything that was changed from CIV to CiV seems to be being retained. Understandable, since they&#39;re basically continuing with the same vision here.<br><br>-They&#39;re diversifying leaders somewhat, with... personality traits, I guess? The impression I get is that leaders will have their own obsessions, and you go against those at your peril.<br>--<a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/civilization-6-everything-you-need-to-know/">Per this article</a>: &quot;One leader might be fanatical about allying with city states. That forces you into a decision: back off from city states and potentially be friends, or compete over a state&#39;s affection and maybe come to blows.&quot;<br>--Well, unless city states are really good, you just back off. So the other leaders make certain playstyles unfavourable, above and beyond the norm.<br>--As in: &#39;normally, I will ally with any city states I meet. The exception is if they&#39;re allied with someone who might attack me over it. Oh, look, Murderos IV is in the game. He will attack me if I ally with city states he&#39;s allied with. Then I guess I won&#39;t do that.&#39;<br><br>-&quot;The unstacking of armies revolutionised the way the military side of the game played out and we’re making a similar change on the economic side of the game.&quot; What they&#39;re doing is apparently going to One City-Building Per Tile; quite how that will work I don&#39;t know.<br>--It suggests that cities in small spaces aren&#39;t going to be able to develop very far; there&#39;ll be no workaround to shove extra food into them, because the restriction is physical space.<br>--It might mean that certain tiles are only buildable-on in the late-game.<br><br>-They&#39;re playing about with research, making it so that you have &#39;miniquests&#39; for each research option, which are based on what&#39;s on the map. So you can research masonry much faster if you have access to stone, for instance.<br>--That... sounds dubious to me. They say it&#39;s to break out of &#39;one way to play&#39; mindsets, but if the boosts are significant enough to make a difference, then they&#39;re still One Right Way: &#39;if you have stone, research masonry; if not, don&#39;t&#39;. Or, to quote: &quot;[in previous Civ games] you could research sailing and navigation, even if you’re landlocked in the middle of a continent. Now you can still try to do that but it’s going to take you forever.&quot;<br>--That means that how you play is restricted by the map generation - which is exactly what I wrote about the city thing. Hmm. New section.<br><br>-So carrying on from &#39;combat using terrain features&#39; as a central feature of CiV, Civ6 will make <i>the way you build your empire</i> depend on the terrain, too.<br>--Is that good or bad? That really, really depends on how tightly restricted you are. If the random map generation pretty much puts you on rails, then it&#39;s bad. And with the leaders also putting restrictions on what you can do... I dunno. We&#39;ll see when it comes out.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I mean, it&#39;s cool, but surely JK can do better than just naming the houses directly after the creatures? :/ I&#39;m... not gonna lie, I hope there&#39;s more to it than that because I&#39;m pretty disappointed otherwise.<br><br>And 1visible, where are you from? Because my middle school and high school were pretty similar and didn&#39;t have any of this &#39;clusters&#39; stuff you were talking about. In both middle and high school, we had our own individual schedules; it was rare for me to see the same kids throughout the day. The only difference is that in middle school, third period was aways set aside for &quot;RE&quot;, that is &quot;Reading and Enrichment&quot;, or as the other students treated it, &quot;goof off and act like idiots&quot; time. Lunchtime was determined by your fourth period class.<br><br>Elementary school for me was different, but I went to a tiny, tiny private school where forty kids to a grade was a rare, large class. There were two teachers to a grade and the grade would be split into two groups, one for each teacher, and halfway through the day they would switch (one teacher would handle half the classes like math, science, and history while the other would take, say, English, religion, and music).<br><br>/end rambling anecdote</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been pointed out elsewhere in this thread that J.K. worked for Amnesty International once upon a time; if she&#39;s doing this, it&#39;s deliberate. Also recall that all this stuff is being released as promotional material for the runup to <i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</i>, a film set in that bastion of progressivism and social justice, the nineteen-friggin&#39;-twenties. This sort of thing is unacceptable to modern eyes, yes, but it&#39;s exactly the kind of thing that would have been acceptable nearly a century ago.<br><br>J.K. Rowling is smarter than some are wont to give her credit for because she uses other people&#39;s dull-wittedness to make a point. D&#39;you think she&#39;s a small-minded, pompous Little Englander because she wrote Vernon Dursley? Do you think she&#39;s an autocratic fascist because she has Voldemort&#39;s insurgency take control of the Ministry for roughly six months? No. Even the most cursory analysis of postcolonial North American history involves white people screwing everyone over as soon as look at them, and we have reason to believe that J.K. did considerably more than that. So yes, be outraged at what white people did in what became the U.S.<br><br><i>That&#39;s the idea.</i></p>

            <p>Okay, so Hogwarts gets this rich history, right, and all the houses are named after the founders. The American school (which honestly probably shouldn&#39;t even <i>have</i> houses but whatever) just gets houses named after local mythical creatures. That would be like if Hogwarts got &quot;House Unicorn&quot; or &quot;House Basilisk&quot; for its houses.

            <p>A lot of the stuff about multicultural wizarding America could still be absolutely true - but MACUSA doesn&#39;t talk about it in the officially published history. I wrote <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=292422;search_term=the+rap">a very short story</a> from the perspective of one of the (hypothetical) culturo-magic groups the New York wizards don&#39;t like to think about.<br><br>This assumption doesn&#39;t cover everything, but it fills in a lot of it - particularly when you view the <i>History</i> as being written <u>by</u> MACUSA. Why don&#39;t they talk about their predecessors&#39; American patriotism? Because they&#39;re desperately trying to instill the current generation with the mindset that MACUSA Is All.<br><br>A couple specific points:<br><br>-There was a lot of thought way back that the entirety of North America would eventually join the US. MACUSA probably took that to conclusions and claims authority over the entire continent.<br><br>-House names! I agree that an American school probably shouldn&#39;t look like Hogwarts, but disagree about &#39;uninspired&#39;. It&#39;s far more interesting than the three house systems I&#39;ve personally experienced:<br><br>-My secondary school had houses named after the three founders of the schools it was made up of. Not terribly imaginative, given that two of them were named <i>in the name of the school</i>.<br>-My <b>primary</b> school had Diamond, Ruby, Emerald, and Sapphire. Thrilling, no? (Diamond was best.)<br>-My son&#39;s school has Oxford, Cambridge, Bath, and... I dunno, probably Milton Keynes or somewhere equally banal. No, they have no connection to any of those universities.<br><br>The Hogwarts idea of houses that a) people care about, and b) have actual distinguishing features is either a very weird one, or a very Upper Class Public School one.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>My primary school&#39;s houses were named after old students who&#39;d done something exemplary, I think (Sutton, Weymouth, and Fiske). My <i>secondary</i> school, on the other hand, only introduced houses while I was there and after it got status as a language college.

            <p>Hogwarts:<br><br>-Gryffindor = lion = brave<br>-Ravenclaw = corvid = smart<br>-Hufflepuff = badger = ... I dunno, cuddly?<br>-Slytherin = snake = super evil and sneaky<br><br>So what about [possible] Ilvermorny? Let&#39;s look at Wikipedia for guidance.<br><br><u>Horned Serpent</u><br><br>The various Horned Serpents are associated with water (and there&#39;s apparently an element theme to Hogwarts too, so that&#39;s interesting). Its character is... debated. The Muscogee version is a friend to animals and humans, but the Cherokee one is deadly poison and will murder your family. Both of them apparently draw other creatures in, though, so perhaps this is the Hufflepuff &#39;friendly&#39; house?<br><br>Or, more crackpotly: they have some nonsense attribute, but their real characteristic is &#39;smothering&#39;. That would make them the Slytherin analogue (serpent, so it&#39;s likely anyway), and would tie in with the oppressive nature of MACUSA. An evil house that wants to grab you and not let go... I can see that.<br><br><u>Wampus</u><br><br>So... it&#39;s a big cat. The Cherokee legend attached to the wampus talks about spying, so how about &#39;stealthy&#39;? Your Wampus kids are going to be the ones who can blend in well, and tend towards small, non-flashy magic. They&#39;re also stuffed with anti-MACUSA dissidents - the ones who managed to get in at all - because they&#39;re part of an entire hidden subculture.<br><br><u>Thunderbird</u><br><br>The thunderbird is powerful and dangerous, and embodies a force of nature. Wikipedia also uses the word &#39;wrathful&#39;. Your Thunderbird kids are going to be &#39;brave&#39; in a way that even Gryffindor would say &#39;hang on a minute&#39; to: they will charge into danger without regard for their own life. Are they doing it for their friends? Are they in a rage? Or are they just out for glory? Depends on the kid.<br><br><u>Pukwudgie</u><br><br>It&#39;s a... wow. It&#39;s a poisonous invisible were-porcupine that wields malevolent ghosts as weapons.<br><br>Uh.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>The only remotely positive trait I can really associate with this is &#39;mischievous&#39;. Perhaps the idea of pukwudgies being anti-human is a lie, and they&#39;re really just playful creatures. Sure. Let&#39;s go with that. And never believe anything a Pukwudgie kid tells you.<br><br>So we have smothering, sneaky, headstrong, and tricksy houses. That sounds really interesting! So I suspect it&#39;ll be nothing of the sort. Here&#39;s the Did Not Do The Research alternative:<br><br>-Thunderbird = bird = Ravenclaw<br>-Horned Serpent = snake = Slytherin<br>-Wampus = big cat = Gryffindor<br>-Pukwudgie = looks like a hedgehog = Hufflepuff<br><br>(Which is why I&#39;m a bit dubious about them being real - surely she&#39;s got enough imagination not to <i>literally</i> copy her previous houses, right? ... right?)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>After some cursory research this is what I came up with.<br><br>I think Thunderbird will be the Gryffindor Analogue.  It seems to fit pretty closely with them.  Given that the Horned Serpent in at least a few traditions is the opposite of the Thunderbird I think it is most likely to be the Slytherin Analogue. <br><br>I have nothing for either Wampus or Pukwudgie.  To me nothing seems to quite say any other house.  Maybe the traits associated with the Ilvermorney Houses are different?<br><br>Another theory, as far as the good/evil go, maybe both Pukwudgies and Horned Serpents are the preferred houses of Dark Wizards?  I could definitely see the Serpents being in charged, the Pukwudgies as essentially being their enforcers, those two filling in the Slytherin role in MACUSA.  I see Thunderbirds as being the front line shock troops, riot in the streets types of rebels and the Wampus being the behind the scene version.</p>

            <p>... why the internet (or bits of it) are calling this cultural appropriation?<br><br>I can just about understand the skinwalker thing. But... why is &#39;using native mythological creatures (which aren&#39;t religious practices)&#39; appropriation/viewed as by some? Surely it&#39;s... <i>good</i> to reference the magical background of the continent?<br><br>~<br><br>Of course, the idea that the USA has a magical school exactly following the pattern of the UK version is a bit weird; do American schools <i>have</i> houses?

            <p>Some people are just thin-skinned. To them, cultural appropriation means any nod to a real-world culture.

Everyone in the same cluster has the same math, science, english, and history teachers, and they are called and dismissed from assemblies as a group. In high school, the distinctions are more fluid. A student could have teachers from any part of the school.<br><br>The cluster system is the closest thing in the US, outside of college.</i></i></p>

            <p>It&#39;s mostly that <i>almost no research was done</i> on the cited cultures, along with complete disregard for <i>actual</i> historical facts.<br>Seriously. Is J.K. saying PoC wizards just didn&#39;t care for muggles, who could have been their family and friends, being slaves or genocide victims? Or even that no wizards were oppressed for their ethnicity, ever. Racism not existing in the wizarding world is just stupid, not to mention the obvious fact that, even then, it&#39;s still a thing in the muggle world which would obviously have consequences for wizards. And don&#39;t even get me started on the no-pure-blood-families thing. It&#39;s the <i>United States</i>, and you&#39;re telling me the obvious racism metaphor is NOT A THING?<br>Also, notice how, suddenly, a few centuries ago, magic in Northern America apparently became all about imported European traditions. No racism here going on, nope, nuh-uh.</p>

            <p>Warning, one-sided discourse ahead!<br><br>There&#39;s a long history between the United States and the Native American nations, most of it very ugly - we&#39;ve gone from actively genocidal to passively genocidal (via forced assimilation) to &quot;merely&quot; pushing them into corners and neglecting them to death.<br><br>A big part of this ugly history is religious - as Morally Upright White Christians, it was our job to Civilize the Savages and Enlighten the World. This didn&#39;t go well, but it went - the Indian boarding schools (or Residential Schools, if you&#39;re looking for Canadian information) intended to, among other things, forcibly Christianize a generation or two of native youth. They didn&#39;t succeed, but they did irreparable damage to the cultural fabric of Native America, and as it really only stopped a generation or two ago, we still don&#39;t know its full effects.<br><br>And now we come to the details of this case, and Thunderbird. (I&#39;m weak on this chunk of the story, VM, please help?) Thunderbird is a specific - and rather significant - entity in native spirituality. I&#39;m not going to try to compare them to western mythologies/religions, because that&#39;s a Bad Idea, but Thunderbird is very important, especially in the pacific northwest traditions. And, because Thunderbird is included in the category of Things To Be Suppressed Because They Are Not Christianity, a lot of native people, including native youth, were forcibly indoctrinated because of their belief in Thunderbird (along with other entities and reasons).<br><br>So, the message being sent by using Thunderbird as a house name reads like this: You know that thing that is an important and powerful symbol of strength to your people? The one that we-as-white-people tried to destroy, and used as reason to try to destroy your culture? Yeah, it&#39;s ours now. We&#39;re going to take the pretty pictures and strip them of their meaning and run them through a marketing machine on a scale you can&#39;t even imagine and spread our milquetoast, inaccurate vision of your most sacred stories further than you&#39;ll ever be able to reach - and, oh yeah, we&#39;ll treat it with no more reverence than a high-school mascot.<br><br>It&#39;s like the worst bible fanfiction ever, but with extra terrible twists - instead of a single writer posting terrible badfic on ff.net, this is an immense publishing conglomerate, with a name on the title page bigger than the media presence of the entire religion she&#39;s borrowing from. This isn&#39;t a religion that&#39;s a household name like Jesus Christ, either- this is a belief that has been suppressed and repressed and attempted-genocided, right up until it became the exotic fetish of the New Age decade. And that&#39;s cultural appropriation in a nutshell: we-as-white-people are going to take a culturally significant entity from people we have oppressed, and use it to make money and spread our culture instead.<br><br>And that&#39;s the angry anti-appropriative view.<br><br>And I completely agree, AHoMiNA is definitely MACUSA propaganda.</p>

            <p>What Juliette (DJ?) has said is a big part of it. But also . . . <br><br>One: My friend Grace pointed this out. To have white wizards from England come to America, then a school is set up under their traditions, and yet colonialism is brushed aside as &quot;they just got along&quot; feels <i>wrong</i> to me. <br><br>Two: Boarding Schools to American Indian tribes have an utterly horrific connotation - it&#39;s where kids were forcibly taken from their parents and sent off to unlearn their language, tradition, and religion. They were beaten for speaking their own language, very, very often physically and sexually abused, and treated as a rent-able workforce for the surrounding community… while being taught skills to occupy the lowest rungs on the wage-ladder, since it was never assume they would be capable of college. The death and disease rates were astronomical. Running away is a common narrative. <br><br>I will note that some tribes later took possession of these schools and turned them into real schools for the tribe. That&#39;s pretty rare, though, and it was done while remembering the history that brought them there. To take a boarding school for wizard kids in America and slap tribal symbols on it out of context, without a single reference to that trauma, is utterly wrong. <br><br>Three; There were <i>at least</i> five hundred different nations on this continent before it was &quot;discovered.&quot; Thunderbirds mean something to some of them, something else to others, and nothing at all to others. Again, you <i>cannot</i> take these symbols out of context, or they lose all meaning. Are we talking about Hopi/Pueblo Thinderbirds? Dinй Thunderbirds? Paiute? Or Dakota, Lakota, Oglala? And if you&#39;re making a school for the Algonquian peoples, Thinderbird makes significantly less sense than, say, Whale and Snake. <br><br>Four: American Indian religions are STILL treated with disrespect in much of this country. We still say &quot;shaman&quot; or &quot;wizard&quot; or what have you when we mean &quot;Medicine man/woman.&quot; This system also disregards that practice. <br><br>That&#39;s what I&#39;ve got off the top of my head. </p>

            <p>A) Yes, Thunderbirds <i>are</i> significant in religion. Thunderbirds, in some cultures, bring water (in others, not so much - again, this is a highly diverse environment with drastically different traditions and interpretations), and are a Other-Than-Human-Being* to be prayed to.<br><br>B) The Horned Serpent may well also be a spiritual symbol of some significance, as may be Wampus. I don&#39;t know much about either of them, since I&#39;ve studied the Western nations a lot more.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>*OTHB is a clunky phrase in English, I know, but it&#39;s the most recent attempt by academics at categorizing the group of . . . well, other-than-human beings that inhabit the North and South American worldview. They&#39;re not gods, or Gods, so that phrase is misleading, nor are they entirely or only spirits, so that doesn&#39;t work, but even those that look human and those that look like animals are not <i>only</i> animals, but beings in another sense. So... Other Than Human Beings. Lengthy but useful.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think I <i>agree</i> with it - it makes major assumptions about magic in North America in general, and Ilvermorny in particular, and I&#39;m none too keen on the &#39;all [English-speaking] white cultures are interchangeable&#39; notion in there - but I understand it. Which is what I was after.<br><br>So, follow-up question. Starting from the premise that Potterverse magic works the same everywhere, and that non-magical history there matches ours (including things like prevailing attitudes among the populace), how could JKR have used the existence of Native Americans in her writings in a way that wouldn&#39;t be [generally] seen as cultural appropriation?<br><br>(That&#39;s an open question; I&#39;m happy for you to answer it, but you&#39;ve already given one excellent and extensive answer, so I&#39;m also fine if you want to step back and let someone else take it.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well, not &#39;this&#39; with the success comment - I think you underestimate JKR&#39;s popularity there - but... I <i>really hope</i> she&#39;s deliberately setting up a commentary on 1920s America with all this.<br><br>At the moment, it&#39;s impossible to tell. Is she outlining a worldview that the film will hold up as awful - the Rap, MACUSA, and possibly the &#39;natives are just like us but not as good!&#39; overtones in the <i>History</i> - or is she just chucking stuff out there without doing real research or thinking about what it means?<br><br>If it&#39;s the former, then she&#39;s doing a really good job, and [after the film is out] her response to all the outrage will be &#39;yes, it <i>was</i> outrageous; well done for noticing&#39;.<br><br>If it&#39;s the latter... well, I hope it&#39;s not the latter.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Gases condense on cold stuff, right? That&#39;s why bathroom mirrors fog up when you&#39;re having a shower.

            <p>Ha, I&#39;m glad you liked the bacon joke.

            <p>As others said, plenty of the works by the authors he mentioned have terrible stuff in them too.  I think he&#39;s just biased against new stories, honestly.  I&#39;m particularly bothered by his referring to modern stories as &quot;insensitive,&quot; &quot;un-sensitive.&quot;  Partly because I&#39;ve mulled those terms over in my head so much now that I&#39;m questioning their very meaning from over-use.  (Does he mean not sensitive?  Or not sensible?  Or . . . senseless?  Not making sense?  HURRRRRR—)  Seriously, compare the <i>Potter</i> series to literally any Shakespeare play.  There&#39;s far more emotional depth to the Potterverse characters than Shakespeare&#39;s.  (On the page; I&#39;m not saying actors can&#39;t lend the roles emotion on stage.)<br><br>Another line that bothered me, not from the principal, but from the other teacher lower down, is &quot;I feel that the darkness of the books is so palpable that it wasn&#39;t the sort of thing that we would want to expose young children to in their formative years . . .&quot;  No.  All of my no.  One thing I will never waver on: the real world is less scary when you&#39;ve fought monsters in your mind.  If we refuse children the freedom to encounter villains in fiction, we&#39;re only depriving them of the mental strength to work around school bullies, unfair professors and rude bosses later on in life.  To learn to handle conflict, they—big surprise!—need to encounter and study conflict.<br><br>—doctorlit, gettin&#39; preachy</p>

            <p>(Also Pope was a civilian commissioned as a war poet because this was WWI and women in the Army was noooooo, and she found fame only as the person to whom Wilfred Owen&#39;s <i>Dulce et Decorum Est</i> was dedicated. I admit I only know this because I made versions of them for a Fate-themed RP on a different site. I&#39;m cultured. =] )<br><br>I mean, Isengard&#39;s image was something that the films got absolutely right, in my book. It looks like the Somme, if it had been fought amidst the &quot;dark Satanic mills&quot; of <i>Jerusalem</i> fame (note that Parry set the words to music in 1916). It&#39;s pretty much how I imagined it on long car journeys with the 15-CD complete BBC audio drama version for company, and no you can&#39;t nick it, it&#39;s technically my mum&#39;s.<br><br>I don&#39;t deny the experiences of those in the military. I was basing my remarks off my own meagre, consummately detested six months in the CCF (Look, I went to private school, alright? That&#39;s just sort of what happens if you stand still long enough.), which is like being in the military if it only let in child psychopaths and fat old perverts who enjoy the sight of weeping, mud-slick young boys far more than is socially acceptable. We didn&#39;t do a lot of the stuff that normal people do in the military. We just drilled. And I cannot use the words I wish to describe it with on the Board, because the rest of this post will be ellipses thanks to the censoring routine.<br><br>So yeah. Hope that covers my reasoning on both accounts.</p>

            <p>Both inside the mission and out!<br><br>Great job, dealing with the most annoying cliche of the <i>Percy Jackson</i> universe: Percy&#39;s sister! Ugh... I can&#39;t stand them!<br><br>One mythological nitpick, if I may:<br><br><i>“why would Percy’s mom have named her daughter after a nymph who turned into a tree? I mean, she named Percy after one of the few Greek heroes to get a happy ending, so wouldn’t Atalanta or something make more sense?”</i><br><br>Atalanta&#39;s story doesn&#39;t end well, actually. Sure, after the Calydonian Boar Hunt she gets married and becomes the queen of either Beotia or Arcadia (sources differ on this one)...but she and her husband decided to do the waka-waka in Zeus&#39;s temple. Needless to say, the Big Guy wasn&#39;t happy, and turned them into lions.<br><br> </p>

            <p>Dollhouse was created by Joss Whedon and is a great show.  It begins a little bit slowly, but give it a few episodes.  The guy who plays Victor is an amazing actor, and Topher Brink is played by the stoner from Cabin in the Woods.  There are also some actors from Firefly who come in later.</p>

            <p>...I joined the PPC! Why do I post about it a day late, you ask? I had the date wrong in my phone. Anyway, it&#39;s been an awesome year. My writing skills have greatly improved, and I also have several friends that I hold dear. I love this place. Keep doing what you&#39;re doing, PPC! <br><br>(Also, feel free to laugh at my <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=275190;search_term=Amy/">first post</a>. My SPaG is... okay at best. I hadn&#39;t yet mastered the art of the ellipsis. Or the art of not writing Sues. I was also nervous to the point of trembling hands, and it kinda shows. hS, did I ever tell you how flabbergasted I was that you talked to me? I&#39;d read about you so much on the wiki that I thought you were <i>way</i> too important, and I hadn&#39;t looked at the Board enough to know that that&#39;s... not how things work. Looking back, it&#39;s absolutely hilarious.)<br><br>(Also also, just so everyone knows, I&#39;m still working on that story I mentioned. My OC has been pared down significantly, and hS&#39;s influence has resulted in an immeasurably better plot. Hopefully, I can begin rolling out chapters by the end of the year!)<br><br>-Alleb</p>
