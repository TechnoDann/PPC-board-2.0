            <p>...I joined the PPC! Why do I post about it a day late, you ask? I had the date wrong in my phone. Anyway, it&#39;s been an awesome year. My writing skills have greatly improved, and I also have several friends that I hold dear. I love this place. Keep doing what you&#39;re doing, PPC! <br><br>(Also, feel free to laugh at my <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=275190;search_term=Amy/">first post</a>. My SPaG is... okay at best. I hadn&#39;t yet mastered the art of the ellipsis. Or the art of not writing Sues. I was also nervous to the point of trembling hands, and it kinda shows. hS, did I ever tell you how flabbergasted I was that you talked to me? I&#39;d read about you so much on the wiki that I thought you were <i>way</i> too important, and I hadn&#39;t looked at the Board enough to know that that&#39;s... not how things work. Looking back, it&#39;s absolutely hilarious.)<br><br>(Also also, just so everyone knows, I&#39;m still working on that story I mentioned. My OC has been pared down significantly, and hS&#39;s influence has resulted in an immeasurably better plot. Hopefully, I can begin rolling out chapters by the end of the year!)<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Dollhouse was created by Joss Whedon and is a great show.  It begins a little bit slowly, but give it a few episodes.  The guy who plays Victor is an amazing actor, and Topher Brink is played by the stoner from Cabin in the Woods.  There are also some actors from Firefly who come in later.</p>

            <p>Both inside the mission and out!<br><br>Great job, dealing with the most annoying cliche of the <i>Percy Jackson</i> universe: Percy&#39;s sister! Ugh... I can&#39;t stand them!<br><br>One mythological nitpick, if I may:<br><br><i>“why would Percy’s mom have named her daughter after a nymph who turned into a tree? I mean, she named Percy after one of the few Greek heroes to get a happy ending, so wouldn’t Atalanta or something make more sense?”</i><br><br>Atalanta&#39;s story doesn&#39;t end well, actually. Sure, after the Calydonian Boar Hunt she gets married and becomes the queen of either Beotia or Arcadia (sources differ on this one)...but she and her husband decided to do the waka-waka in Zeus&#39;s temple. Needless to say, the Big Guy wasn&#39;t happy, and turned them into lions.<br><br> </p>

            <p>As others said, plenty of the works by the authors he mentioned have terrible stuff in them too.  I think he&#39;s just biased against new stories, honestly.  I&#39;m particularly bothered by his referring to modern stories as &quot;insensitive,&quot; &quot;un-sensitive.&quot;  Partly because I&#39;ve mulled those terms over in my head so much now that I&#39;m questioning their very meaning from over-use.  (Does he mean not sensitive?  Or not sensible?  Or . . . senseless?  Not making sense?  HURRRRRR—)  Seriously, compare the <i>Potter</i> series to literally any Shakespeare play.  There&#39;s far more emotional depth to the Potterverse characters than Shakespeare&#39;s.  (On the page; I&#39;m not saying actors can&#39;t lend the roles emotion on stage.)<br><br>Another line that bothered me, not from the principal, but from the other teacher lower down, is &quot;I feel that the darkness of the books is so palpable that it wasn&#39;t the sort of thing that we would want to expose young children to in their formative years . . .&quot;  No.  All of my no.  One thing I will never waver on: the real world is less scary when you&#39;ve fought monsters in your mind.  If we refuse children the freedom to encounter villains in fiction, we&#39;re only depriving them of the mental strength to work around school bullies, unfair professors and rude bosses later on in life.  To learn to handle conflict, they—big surprise!—need to encounter and study conflict.<br><br>—doctorlit, gettin&#39; preachy</p>

            <p>(Also Pope was a civilian commissioned as a war poet because this was WWI and women in the Army was noooooo, and she found fame only as the person to whom Wilfred Owen&#39;s <i>Dulce et Decorum Est</i> was dedicated. I admit I only know this because I made versions of them for a Fate-themed RP on a different site. I&#39;m cultured. =] )<br><br>I mean, Isengard&#39;s image was something that the films got absolutely right, in my book. It looks like the Somme, if it had been fought amidst the &quot;dark Satanic mills&quot; of <i>Jerusalem</i> fame (note that Parry set the words to music in 1916). It&#39;s pretty much how I imagined it on long car journeys with the 15-CD complete BBC audio drama version for company, and no you can&#39;t nick it, it&#39;s technically my mum&#39;s.<br><br>I don&#39;t deny the experiences of those in the military. I was basing my remarks off my own meagre, consummately detested six months in the CCF (Look, I went to private school, alright? That&#39;s just sort of what happens if you stand still long enough.), which is like being in the military if it only let in child psychopaths and fat old perverts who enjoy the sight of weeping, mud-slick young boys far more than is socially acceptable. We didn&#39;t do a lot of the stuff that normal people do in the military. We just drilled. And I cannot use the words I wish to describe it with on the Board, because the rest of this post will be ellipses thanks to the censoring routine.<br><br>So yeah. Hope that covers my reasoning on both accounts.</p>

I took inspiration from <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/43/d3/91/43d391ed5975dacecda9b2429f2117e2.jpg">this</a> post, which I&#39;d always found hilarious. <br><br>Good heavens is right. As soon as I saw this thing, I knew I had to spork it. I actually compiled a physical charge list for it to help me keep track of everything--I got a page and a half, and the first side had double columns. And I didn&#39;t even get to the third chapter.<br><br>-Alleb<br></p>

            <p>Having a LOTR Sue really brings back memories. :)<br>I liked your agents and their banter a lot. Really funny and endearing.<br>And the epic boss fight at the end was very well written. Both funny and exciting.<br><br>One minor error, the two paragraphs starting with &quot;The Sue struggled to her feet, and the agents let her&quot; appear twice.</p>

            <p>I mean, it&#39;s cool, but surely JK can do better than just naming the houses directly after the creatures? :/ I&#39;m... not gonna lie, I hope there&#39;s more to it than that because I&#39;m pretty disappointed otherwise.<br><br>And 1visible, where are you from? Because my middle school and high school were pretty similar and didn&#39;t have any of this &#39;clusters&#39; stuff you were talking about. In both middle and high school, we had our own individual schedules; it was rare for me to see the same kids throughout the day. The only difference is that in middle school, third period was aways set aside for &quot;RE&quot;, that is &quot;Reading and Enrichment&quot;, or as the other students treated it, &quot;goof off and act like idiots&quot; time. Lunchtime was determined by your fourth period class.<br><br>Elementary school for me was different, but I went to a tiny, tiny private school where forty kids to a grade was a rare, large class. There were two teachers to a grade and the grade would be split into two groups, one for each teacher, and halfway through the day they would switch (one teacher would handle half the classes like math, science, and history while the other would take, say, English, religion, and music).<br><br>/end rambling anecdote</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been pointed out elsewhere in this thread that J.K. worked for Amnesty International once upon a time; if she&#39;s doing this, it&#39;s deliberate. Also recall that all this stuff is being released as promotional material for the runup to <i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</i>, a film set in that bastion of progressivism and social justice, the nineteen-friggin&#39;-twenties. This sort of thing is unacceptable to modern eyes, yes, but it&#39;s exactly the kind of thing that would have been acceptable nearly a century ago.<br><br>J.K. Rowling is smarter than some are wont to give her credit for because she uses other people&#39;s dull-wittedness to make a point. D&#39;you think she&#39;s a small-minded, pompous Little Englander because she wrote Vernon Dursley? Do you think she&#39;s an autocratic fascist because she has Voldemort&#39;s insurgency take control of the Ministry for roughly six months? No. Even the most cursory analysis of postcolonial North American history involves white people screwing everyone over as soon as look at them, and we have reason to believe that J.K. did considerably more than that. So yes, be outraged at what white people did in what became the U.S.<br><br><i>That&#39;s the idea.</i></p>

            <p>Okay, so Hogwarts gets this rich history, right, and all the houses are named after the founders. The American school (which honestly probably shouldn&#39;t even <i>have</i> houses but whatever) just gets houses named after local mythical creatures. That would be like if Hogwarts got &quot;House Unicorn&quot; or &quot;House Basilisk&quot; for its houses.

            <p>A lot of the stuff about multicultural wizarding America could still be absolutely true - but MACUSA doesn&#39;t talk about it in the officially published history. I wrote <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=292422;search_term=the+rap">a very short story</a> from the perspective of one of the (hypothetical) culturo-magic groups the New York wizards don&#39;t like to think about.<br><br>This assumption doesn&#39;t cover everything, but it fills in a lot of it - particularly when you view the <i>History</i> as being written <u>by</u> MACUSA. Why don&#39;t they talk about their predecessors&#39; American patriotism? Because they&#39;re desperately trying to instill the current generation with the mindset that MACUSA Is All.<br><br>A couple specific points:<br><br>-There was a lot of thought way back that the entirety of North America would eventually join the US. MACUSA probably took that to conclusions and claims authority over the entire continent.<br><br>-House names! I agree that an American school probably shouldn&#39;t look like Hogwarts, but disagree about &#39;uninspired&#39;. It&#39;s far more interesting than the three house systems I&#39;ve personally experienced:<br><br>-My secondary school had houses named after the three founders of the schools it was made up of. Not terribly imaginative, given that two of them were named <i>in the name of the school</i>.<br>-My <b>primary</b> school had Diamond, Ruby, Emerald, and Sapphire. Thrilling, no? (Diamond was best.)<br>-My son&#39;s school has Oxford, Cambridge, Bath, and... I dunno, probably Milton Keynes or somewhere equally banal. No, they have no connection to any of those universities.<br><br>The Hogwarts idea of houses that a) people care about, and b) have actual distinguishing features is either a very weird one, or a very Upper Class Public School one.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>My primary school&#39;s houses were named after old students who&#39;d done something exemplary, I think (Sutton, Weymouth, and Fiske). My <i>secondary</i> school, on the other hand, only introduced houses while I was there and after it got status as a language college.

            <p>Hogwarts:<br><br>-Gryffindor = lion = brave<br>-Ravenclaw = corvid = smart<br>-Hufflepuff = badger = ... I dunno, cuddly?<br>-Slytherin = snake = super evil and sneaky<br><br>So what about [possible] Ilvermorny? Let&#39;s look at Wikipedia for guidance.<br><br><u>Horned Serpent</u><br><br>The various Horned Serpents are associated with water (and there&#39;s apparently an element theme to Hogwarts too, so that&#39;s interesting). Its character is... debated. The Muscogee version is a friend to animals and humans, but the Cherokee one is deadly poison and will murder your family. Both of them apparently draw other creatures in, though, so perhaps this is the Hufflepuff &#39;friendly&#39; house?<br><br>Or, more crackpotly: they have some nonsense attribute, but their real characteristic is &#39;smothering&#39;. That would make them the Slytherin analogue (serpent, so it&#39;s likely anyway), and would tie in with the oppressive nature of MACUSA. An evil house that wants to grab you and not let go... I can see that.<br><br><u>Wampus</u><br><br>So... it&#39;s a big cat. The Cherokee legend attached to the wampus talks about spying, so how about &#39;stealthy&#39;? Your Wampus kids are going to be the ones who can blend in well, and tend towards small, non-flashy magic. They&#39;re also stuffed with anti-MACUSA dissidents - the ones who managed to get in at all - because they&#39;re part of an entire hidden subculture.<br><br><u>Thunderbird</u><br><br>The thunderbird is powerful and dangerous, and embodies a force of nature. Wikipedia also uses the word &#39;wrathful&#39;. Your Thunderbird kids are going to be &#39;brave&#39; in a way that even Gryffindor would say &#39;hang on a minute&#39; to: they will charge into danger without regard for their own life. Are they doing it for their friends? Are they in a rage? Or are they just out for glory? Depends on the kid.<br><br><u>Pukwudgie</u><br><br>It&#39;s a... wow. It&#39;s a poisonous invisible were-porcupine that wields malevolent ghosts as weapons.<br><br>Uh.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>The only remotely positive trait I can really associate with this is &#39;mischievous&#39;. Perhaps the idea of pukwudgies being anti-human is a lie, and they&#39;re really just playful creatures. Sure. Let&#39;s go with that. And never believe anything a Pukwudgie kid tells you.<br><br>So we have smothering, sneaky, headstrong, and tricksy houses. That sounds really interesting! So I suspect it&#39;ll be nothing of the sort. Here&#39;s the Did Not Do The Research alternative:<br><br>-Thunderbird = bird = Ravenclaw<br>-Horned Serpent = snake = Slytherin<br>-Wampus = big cat = Gryffindor<br>-Pukwudgie = looks like a hedgehog = Hufflepuff<br><br>(Which is why I&#39;m a bit dubious about them being real - surely she&#39;s got enough imagination not to <i>literally</i> copy her previous houses, right? ... right?)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>After some cursory research this is what I came up with.<br><br>I think Thunderbird will be the Gryffindor Analogue.  It seems to fit pretty closely with them.  Given that the Horned Serpent in at least a few traditions is the opposite of the Thunderbird I think it is most likely to be the Slytherin Analogue. <br><br>I have nothing for either Wampus or Pukwudgie.  To me nothing seems to quite say any other house.  Maybe the traits associated with the Ilvermorney Houses are different?<br><br>Another theory, as far as the good/evil go, maybe both Pukwudgies and Horned Serpents are the preferred houses of Dark Wizards?  I could definitely see the Serpents being in charged, the Pukwudgies as essentially being their enforcers, those two filling in the Slytherin role in MACUSA.  I see Thunderbirds as being the front line shock troops, riot in the streets types of rebels and the Wampus being the behind the scene version.</p>

            <p>... why the internet (or bits of it) are calling this cultural appropriation?<br><br>I can just about understand the skinwalker thing. But... why is &#39;using native mythological creatures (which aren&#39;t religious practices)&#39; appropriation/viewed as by some? Surely it&#39;s... <i>good</i> to reference the magical background of the continent?<br><br>~<br><br>Of course, the idea that the USA has a magical school exactly following the pattern of the UK version is a bit weird; do American schools <i>have</i> houses?

            <p>Some people are just thin-skinned. To them, cultural appropriation means any nod to a real-world culture.

Everyone in the same cluster has the same math, science, english, and history teachers, and they are called and dismissed from assemblies as a group. In high school, the distinctions are more fluid. A student could have teachers from any part of the school.<br><br>The cluster system is the closest thing in the US, outside of college.</i></i></p>

            <p>It&#39;s mostly that <i>almost no research was done</i> on the cited cultures, along with complete disregard for <i>actual</i> historical facts.<br>Seriously. Is J.K. saying PoC wizards just didn&#39;t care for muggles, who could have been their family and friends, being slaves or genocide victims? Or even that no wizards were oppressed for their ethnicity, ever. Racism not existing in the wizarding world is just stupid, not to mention the obvious fact that, even then, it&#39;s still a thing in the muggle world which would obviously have consequences for wizards. And don&#39;t even get me started on the no-pure-blood-families thing. It&#39;s the <i>United States</i>, and you&#39;re telling me the obvious racism metaphor is NOT A THING?<br>Also, notice how, suddenly, a few centuries ago, magic in Northern America apparently became all about imported European traditions. No racism here going on, nope, nuh-uh.</p>

            <p>Warning, one-sided discourse ahead!<br><br>There&#39;s a long history between the United States and the Native American nations, most of it very ugly - we&#39;ve gone from actively genocidal to passively genocidal (via forced assimilation) to &quot;merely&quot; pushing them into corners and neglecting them to death.<br><br>A big part of this ugly history is religious - as Morally Upright White Christians, it was our job to Civilize the Savages and Enlighten the World. This didn&#39;t go well, but it went - the Indian boarding schools (or Residential Schools, if you&#39;re looking for Canadian information) intended to, among other things, forcibly Christianize a generation or two of native youth. They didn&#39;t succeed, but they did irreparable damage to the cultural fabric of Native America, and as it really only stopped a generation or two ago, we still don&#39;t know its full effects.<br><br>And now we come to the details of this case, and Thunderbird. (I&#39;m weak on this chunk of the story, VM, please help?) Thunderbird is a specific - and rather significant - entity in native spirituality. I&#39;m not going to try to compare them to western mythologies/religions, because that&#39;s a Bad Idea, but Thunderbird is very important, especially in the pacific northwest traditions. And, because Thunderbird is included in the category of Things To Be Suppressed Because They Are Not Christianity, a lot of native people, including native youth, were forcibly indoctrinated because of their belief in Thunderbird (along with other entities and reasons).<br><br>So, the message being sent by using Thunderbird as a house name reads like this: You know that thing that is an important and powerful symbol of strength to your people? The one that we-as-white-people tried to destroy, and used as reason to try to destroy your culture? Yeah, it&#39;s ours now. We&#39;re going to take the pretty pictures and strip them of their meaning and run them through a marketing machine on a scale you can&#39;t even imagine and spread our milquetoast, inaccurate vision of your most sacred stories further than you&#39;ll ever be able to reach - and, oh yeah, we&#39;ll treat it with no more reverence than a high-school mascot.<br><br>It&#39;s like the worst bible fanfiction ever, but with extra terrible twists - instead of a single writer posting terrible badfic on ff.net, this is an immense publishing conglomerate, with a name on the title page bigger than the media presence of the entire religion she&#39;s borrowing from. This isn&#39;t a religion that&#39;s a household name like Jesus Christ, either- this is a belief that has been suppressed and repressed and attempted-genocided, right up until it became the exotic fetish of the New Age decade. And that&#39;s cultural appropriation in a nutshell: we-as-white-people are going to take a culturally significant entity from people we have oppressed, and use it to make money and spread our culture instead.<br><br>And that&#39;s the angry anti-appropriative view.<br><br>And I completely agree, AHoMiNA is definitely MACUSA propaganda.</p>

            <p>What Juliette (DJ?) has said is a big part of it. But also . . . <br><br>One: My friend Grace pointed this out. To have white wizards from England come to America, then a school is set up under their traditions, and yet colonialism is brushed aside as &quot;they just got along&quot; feels <i>wrong</i> to me. <br><br>Two: Boarding Schools to American Indian tribes have an utterly horrific connotation - it&#39;s where kids were forcibly taken from their parents and sent off to unlearn their language, tradition, and religion. They were beaten for speaking their own language, very, very often physically and sexually abused, and treated as a rent-able workforce for the surrounding community… while being taught skills to occupy the lowest rungs on the wage-ladder, since it was never assume they would be capable of college. The death and disease rates were astronomical. Running away is a common narrative. <br><br>I will note that some tribes later took possession of these schools and turned them into real schools for the tribe. That&#39;s pretty rare, though, and it was done while remembering the history that brought them there. To take a boarding school for wizard kids in America and slap tribal symbols on it out of context, without a single reference to that trauma, is utterly wrong. <br><br>Three; There were <i>at least</i> five hundred different nations on this continent before it was &quot;discovered.&quot; Thunderbirds mean something to some of them, something else to others, and nothing at all to others. Again, you <i>cannot</i> take these symbols out of context, or they lose all meaning. Are we talking about Hopi/Pueblo Thinderbirds? Diné Thunderbirds? Paiute? Or Dakota, Lakota, Oglala? And if you&#39;re making a school for the Algonquian peoples, Thinderbird makes significantly less sense than, say, Whale and Snake. <br><br>Four: American Indian religions are STILL treated with disrespect in much of this country. We still say &quot;shaman&quot; or &quot;wizard&quot; or what have you when we mean &quot;Medicine man/woman.&quot; This system also disregards that practice. <br><br>That&#39;s what I&#39;ve got off the top of my head. </p>

            <p>A) Yes, Thunderbirds <i>are</i> significant in religion. Thunderbirds, in some cultures, bring water (in others, not so much - again, this is a highly diverse environment with drastically different traditions and interpretations), and are a Other-Than-Human-Being* to be prayed to.<br><br>B) The Horned Serpent may well also be a spiritual symbol of some significance, as may be Wampus. I don&#39;t know much about either of them, since I&#39;ve studied the Western nations a lot more.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>*OTHB is a clunky phrase in English, I know, but it&#39;s the most recent attempt by academics at categorizing the group of . . . well, other-than-human beings that inhabit the North and South American worldview. They&#39;re not gods, or Gods, so that phrase is misleading, nor are they entirely or only spirits, so that doesn&#39;t work, but even those that look human and those that look like animals are not <i>only</i> animals, but beings in another sense. So... Other Than Human Beings. Lengthy but useful.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think I <i>agree</i> with it - it makes major assumptions about magic in North America in general, and Ilvermorny in particular, and I&#39;m none too keen on the &#39;all [English-speaking] white cultures are interchangeable&#39; notion in there - but I understand it. Which is what I was after.<br><br>So, follow-up question. Starting from the premise that Potterverse magic works the same everywhere, and that non-magical history there matches ours (including things like prevailing attitudes among the populace), how could JKR have used the existence of Native Americans in her writings in a way that wouldn&#39;t be [generally] seen as cultural appropriation?<br><br>(That&#39;s an open question; I&#39;m happy for you to answer it, but you&#39;ve already given one excellent and extensive answer, so I&#39;m also fine if you want to step back and let someone else take it.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;I say, you there... I say, you there... I say, you there...&quot;<br><br>So. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/05/11/civilization-vi-details/">Here&#39;s an article</a> discussing what&#39;s going to be in it. Some thoughts, after a quick readthrough:<br><br>-Everything that was changed from CIV to CiV seems to be being retained. Understandable, since they&#39;re basically continuing with the same vision here.<br><br>-They&#39;re diversifying leaders somewhat, with... personality traits, I guess? The impression I get is that leaders will have their own obsessions, and you go against those at your peril.<br>--<a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/civilization-6-everything-you-need-to-know/">Per this article</a>: &quot;One leader might be fanatical about allying with city states. That forces you into a decision: back off from city states and potentially be friends, or compete over a state&#39;s affection and maybe come to blows.&quot;<br>--Well, unless city states are really good, you just back off. So the other leaders make certain playstyles unfavourable, above and beyond the norm.<br>--As in: &#39;normally, I will ally with any city states I meet. The exception is if they&#39;re allied with someone who might attack me over it. Oh, look, Murderos IV is in the game. He will attack me if I ally with city states he&#39;s allied with. Then I guess I won&#39;t do that.&#39;<br><br>-&quot;The unstacking of armies revolutionised the way the military side of the game played out and we’re making a similar change on the economic side of the game.&quot; What they&#39;re doing is apparently going to One City-Building Per Tile; quite how that will work I don&#39;t know.<br>--It suggests that cities in small spaces aren&#39;t going to be able to develop very far; there&#39;ll be no workaround to shove extra food into them, because the restriction is physical space.<br>--It might mean that certain tiles are only buildable-on in the late-game.<br><br>-They&#39;re playing about with research, making it so that you have &#39;miniquests&#39; for each research option, which are based on what&#39;s on the map. So you can research masonry much faster if you have access to stone, for instance.<br>--That... sounds dubious to me. They say it&#39;s to break out of &#39;one way to play&#39; mindsets, but if the boosts are significant enough to make a difference, then they&#39;re still One Right Way: &#39;if you have stone, research masonry; if not, don&#39;t&#39;. Or, to quote: &quot;[in previous Civ games] you could research sailing and navigation, even if you’re landlocked in the middle of a continent. Now you can still try to do that but it’s going to take you forever.&quot;<br>--That means that how you play is restricted by the map generation - which is exactly what I wrote about the city thing. Hmm. New section.<br><br>-So carrying on from &#39;combat using terrain features&#39; as a central feature of CiV, Civ6 will make <i>the way you build your empire</i> depend on the terrain, too.<br>--Is that good or bad? That really, really depends on how tightly restricted you are. If the random map generation pretty much puts you on rails, then it&#39;s bad. And with the leaders also putting restrictions on what you can do... I dunno. We&#39;ll see when it comes out.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That was an easy-to-follow mission, and a well done execution of the Sue. Death by Canon--so rare, but sometimes so satisfying when done right. And of course, this Sue was one of the annoying in-text-A/N-to-show-off-some-incorrect-trivia Sues (First, the name you&#39;re thinking of is <i>Atalant<b>a</b></i>, not <i>Atalant<b>is</b></i>. Second, Atalanta does not <i>mean</i> &quot;mighty huntress&quot; (<a href="http://www.behindthename.com/name/atalanta">it means &quot;equal in weight&quot;</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta">she <i>was</i> a mighty huntress</a>!)<br><br>But some errors slipped through in your mission. One of which HG picked up already:<br><i> Give my partner and I your guidance, O god of thieves and merchants.</i><br>It should be &quot;my partner and <b>me&quot;: they are both the objects of the verb &quot;give&quot;.<br><br>The remaining errors are pluralization errors:<br>1)<i>Their first mission into one of the most interesting continuums (in the pair’s opinion) that they had discovered in a long while,</i><br>The plural of &quot;continuum&quot; is &quot;continua&quot;.<br><br>2)<i>So she had hidden away for over a millennia inside the Labyrinth</i><br>&quot;Millenia&quot; is plural. The correct word is &quot;a millenium&quot;.<br><br>One more thing stuck out:<br><i>That is not a bad trait, </i>Za’kiir thought.<i> It’s rather interesting. Khajiit likes it.</i><br>Is that a quirk of Za&#39;kiir&#39;s speech, or did you mean to say, &quot;Za&#39;kiir likes it&quot;?<br></b></p>

            <p>Za&#39;kiir and Natalie are so much fun to read, but there are some spelling and grammar issues:<br><br><i>Give my partner and <b>I</b> your guidance, O god of Thieves and Merchants</i>.<br>Wouldn’t &quot;Give <b>me</b> your guidance&quot; be correct? Adding another person, like &quot;my partner&quot;, shouldn’t change this. (Apparently, many people fell into the habit of saying words like &quot;My partner and me went somewhere&quot; to an extent that it began to look right because it was seen so often. Then the backlash came and had such an impact that to some people &quot;another person and me&quot; now looks wrong even when it’s right?)<br><br><i>The agents clapped along with the rest of the campers, <b>through</b> their smiles were tight —</i><br>I believe you meant &quot;though&quot;.<br><br><i>Apparently <b>none</b> of the other gods <b>couldn’t</b> stop talking about it ...</i><br>I’m not quite sure what you are trying to say there. The double negation actually says that Mr. D is the only god who couldn’t stop talking about it, but maybe that’s the reason why he wants Ally to do something? <br><br><i>How had she gotten <b>her</b>?</i> <br>If you aren’t alluding to the Sue’s weird way of thinking, this should be &quot;here&quot; (or less probably &quot;there&quot;).<br><br><i>How do you who I am?</i> <br>If this weren’t the Sue speaking, I would guess that the missing word wasn’t left out intentionally.<br><br>Yeah, I could have seen it coming, but then I didn’t. When the &quot;goddess&quot; claimed that she had been forgotten, I wondered whether she could even still exist. But since I didn’t know how this works in <i>Percy Jackson</i> canon, I dismissed the thought, because nobody could be this stupid, and forgot all about it. Surprise, surprise! Atalantis could, and found a rightful Death by Canon. <br><br>HG</p>

Anyway, after <i><b> While</b> there wasn’t any clue on the envelope to discern which letter it was</i>, I would expect some clue elsewhere. I certainly wouldn’t expect the sentence to be continued with <b>but</b>. What is this &quot;but&quot; meant to contradict to?

Maybe you just need to omit the &quot;but&quot;, but I really don’t know whether I understand what you are trying to say here.<br><br><i>It didn’t seem <b>to damage to</b> the note inside though.</i><br>These are either too few or too many words. If &quot;damage&quot; is used as a verb, it should simply read &quot;seem to damage the note&quot;; if &quot;damage&quot; is used as a noun, it should read &quot;seem to <b>do</b> damage to the note&quot;.<br><br><i>(<b>thought</b> it was a small step up from the one Techno-Dann used, it actually had a readout)</i><br>You probably meant &quot;though&quot;.<br><br><i>Unlike their RAs, Matthew’s and Ajax’s Combined Content Analysis Devices were both newer, smartphone-shaped models.</i><br>This is a bit confusing, because you previously said that <i>Ajax’s RA resembled a generic smartphone</i>. Thinking about it, I get that the point here is &quot;both&quot; (Matthew’s RA is an older model), but I wonder whether this might have been made clearer.<br><br><i>What would have shown data on a character <b>were</b> currently displaying the following:</i><br>Are there at least two &quot;things&quot; that would have shown data on a character?

            <p>So, having split &quot;All-Stars&quot; and &quot;More CAH&quot; into two different decks, I am now thinking of folding them back into just &quot;More Cards Against Headquarters.&quot; I figure it&#39;s one less code to add, and if there&#39;s any risk of my favorites overwhelming everyone else&#39;s favorites, y&#39;all can always suggest more stuff.<br><br>What about folding in TOS, The Flowers - A (but not B), and FicPsych, too?<br><br>Is it better if they&#39;re separated into themed decks you can pick and choose from, or would one big deck be preferable? I want this to be good for everyone, not just me. {= )<br><br>Thanks in advance for your input!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Not-an-Agent-yet Hieronymus would be played by Ian McKellen. I like the idea.<br><br>For Androia Avatar, Buzzfeed gave me Abigail Breslin. I don’t know who this is, she definitely doesn’t look like a <i>World of Warcraft</i> night elf druid, and I realized that I need to think and do research about some questions I couldn’t really answer for Androia. Has she ever <i>been</i> in a school? What classes could she take there? Are cleaning and doing the laundry actions player characters can do? I’m sure that Androia never had a lawn to mow, and I know that she can read, but did she ever learn to write or would doing paperwork be out of question anyway? Which of the toys I have to choose from would she actually know, and did she even have a childhood, or was she spawned fully grown up at Shadowglen?<br><br>HG (probably not asking for Permission this year)</p>

            <p>Dafydd Illian would be <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/81/b0/20/81b02062a4d7c0a63d2e8dfebf1b45a6.jpg">Colin O&#39;Donoghue</a>, whom my fellow connoisseurs of televisual garbage will know as Captain Hook from that august barrel of lunacy <i>Once Upon A Time</i>. The guy who plays Killian Jones, a man for whom death really <i>is</i> like man flu, seems like a natural fit for one of those agents who came back from the dead. =]<br><br>Since it&#39;d be wrong to have one without the other (though their kids&#39;ll have to wait because life really is too short), Constance Sims is <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a3/58/85/a3588529a0913fff938ecbd352464387.jpg">Shenae Grimes</a> of <i>127 Hours</i> fame. This, I admit, is largely based on appearance, though if movie!Dafydd is hotter, then so is movie!Constance. =]<br><br>As for my agents, well... my agents might all be humanoid (with a few exceptions), but I think a PPC Movie might well require them to be CGI just because of how cartoonish they are. Anyway, here&#39;s the voice cast for my motley assortment of total weirdos.<br><br>Wobbles: <a href="http://www.gloriesworld.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/anna-faris-9.jpg">Anna Faris</a>. She has the bubbly voice for it, and I think she&#39;d be good at voice work; getting her into a fatsuit or something for a live-action performance might be trickier though. Additionally, it&#39;s worth mentioning that my first choice was Amy Poehler, but Nesh poached her, the swine. The feeeeeeelthy swine. =]<br><br>The Notary: <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/ee/a6/42/eea64239d17a75e5e2f2182069f3b2e5.jpg">Carmen Ejogo</a>. A wonderful voice that sounds old and young at the same time - a perfect mix for her. Plus, she&#39;s got experience of more emotional parts, meaning I really think she could pull off the pathos for the part; there&#39;s a lot of history for the Oncoming Form. =]<br><br>Doktor Trollenfisch: <a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/jamesbond/images/6/65/Gareth_Mallory_(Ralph_Fiennes)_-_Profile.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130508000404">Ray Fiennes</a>. Now, strangely, this part does not require an actual German to play the Doktor; rather, it requires someone willing to ham it up to a ridiculous degree and just plain old have fun with the part. Fiennes&#39; turn as Victor Quartermaine in <i>Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</i> proved he can do both. Everyone had an absolute ball making that film, and I think that&#39;s what has to shine through with the Doktor und Gabrielle.<br><br>Gabrielle: <a href="http://www.hotstarz.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AnnaSophia-Robb2.jpg">AnnaSophia Robb</a>, and yes, that is how you spell it. This is mostly on the strength of her performance in a weird little film called <i>Jack of the Red Hearts</i>, in which she displays the girlishness and grit combined that makes Gabrielle such a compelling character to write for. Small floof, many damage; perfect for Ms. Robb.<br><br>Lola McCandless: <a href="http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/35ns5Wme2fedmBqQ6qZE6iD/03ad37ab-2a0f-4605-8e06-bd632799cc85.jpg/r67_0_567_640_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg">Clare Bowen</a>. Now, American viewers probably know her from <i>Nashville</i>, assuming they know her from Adam, but she&#39;s an Australian actress and veteran of <i>Home and Away</i>. That said, I refuse to hold it against her. =]<br><br>Algernon, 7th Earl Wymbourne: <a href="http://cdn.bleedingcool.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TobyJones.jpg">Toby Jones</a>. I was exceptionally tempted to cast Eddie Marsan in this role, but Jones won out in the end. He&#39;s an immensely talented actor with an amazing presence and voice, and I think he&#39;d do well with the part - though whether or not he&#39;d enjoy going back into a <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_Nmx7NlyYLk/U8VHUkfQywI/AAAAAAAAC0w/oQiujO1ZKfY/s1600/vlcsnap-00042.png">sound studio</a> is open to debate. =]</p>

            <p>Former Agent July Flame: <a href="http://www-tc.pbs.org/weta/finding-your-roots/files/2012/03/michelle-rodriguez-4.jpg">Michelle Rodriguez</a>. If anyone can wield a sledgehammer with serious conviction, it&#39;s her. She just seems to... fit the character a lot, especially post-snap - July&#39;s neurotic disposition covered by anger almost feels like giving Rodriguez the role would be typecasting, given her appearances in other media.<br><br>Agent Calpurnia Library: <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/81/47/f6/8147f68aff5f3fceca18feed60b2aa74.jpg">Tilda Swinton</a>. Another good fit, though one wonders just how good her American accent is. Her slightly icy archness would work as an excellent counterpoint to Rodriguez.<br><br>Agent JF: <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/79/3b/6e/793b6e1e6d13922253f94da20b569125.jpg">America Ferrera</a>. Again, she just seems very much like a natural fit for the role, though I admit this is based on years of sitting through <i>Ugly Betty</i> with my mum. Might have to do something about the T-shirt though, some of the other agents might find it offensive. =]</p>

            <p>I only really know who I&#39;d cast as Nume (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0648486/?ref_=nv_sr_3">Timothy Omundson</a> a la Carlton Lassiter in <i>Psych</i>) and Derik (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124930/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Gerard Butler</a>, because <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293508/">duh</a>). For the rest, I have no idea.<br><br>... So I found a way to cheat!

You may know him as Henry McCoy in the recent <i>X-Men</i> movies. I can see it.<br><br>Jenni - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0688132/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Amy Poehler</a>, who I know from SNL. Iiiii dunno about this one. A comedienne wouldn&#39;t be my first choice. She&#39;s the voice of Joy in <i>Inside Out</i>, though, so that&#39;s kinda cool.<br><br>Gall - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1102577/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Elle Fanning</a>. Apparently she plays Aurora in <i>Maleficent</i>, but I haven&#39;t seen it, or anything else she&#39;s been in. She&#39;s adorable, though! Give her red hair and an evil smirk, and I can see it.<br><br>And, just for fun, I did Nume and Derik, too.<br><br>Nume - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1212722/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Benedict Cumberbatch</a>. You all know who he is, right? Excuse me, I&#39;m gonna go die laughing now. (Full disclosure: this was actually my second result for him. First time around, I came up with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252961/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Idris Elba</a>, rumored to be the next James Bond, who I think is a bit too cheerful and, as Phobos said, debonair for Nume.)<br><br>Derik - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252961/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Idris Elba</a>. ... Yeah, I don&#39;t know how this is possible, since I gave totally different answers from when I was playing as Nume, but this time I think it could work! So yeah. {X D<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

The image is a promotional still from <i>The Babadook</i>, one of the best psychological horror films in recent years and something I urge everyone to check out. This is a movie that will mess with your head for months afterwards, and that&#39;s just about the best thing a horror film can do; not on jump scares, not on gore, but purely on the strength of an oppressive atmosphere and the central performances of Wiseman and Essie Davis.<br><br>Actually, thinking about it, <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/82/a7/4e/82a74e7a23512bc704cbb6aedb5325dc.jpg">Davis</a> might make a good Jenni as well.

            <p>&quot;What&#39;s good or bad is based only on opinions, not facts.&quot;<br><br>Okay, so why is Shakespeare&#39;s poetry enjoyed by people everywhere, while my silly doggerel about my cat hasn&#39;t even been published in the school paper?<br><br>Why is it that people commonly criticize &quot;Twilight&quot; as being poorly written, but not &quot;Dracula&quot;?<br><br>Why can your high school literature teacher justify giving you a bad grade for poor writing, even if your grammar and spelling are fine?<br><br>The fact is, people judge each others&#39; writing all the time. Book critics make a living from doing it.<br><br>And there&#39;s a difference between judging quality and judging preference. &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is a very well-written book. Many people really enjoy it. I don&#39;t; I find it rather tedious to read. But I can recognize good writing when I see it; it&#39;s a well-written book, even though I don&#39;t like the genre. On the other hand, even though I absolutely love fantasy and sci-fi, I recognize &quot;Eragon&quot; as rather bad writing, a teenager&#39;s first attempt that somehow got published.<br><br>I also recognize that bad writers grow out of it. Christopher Paolini is probably going to write very well when he&#39;s had more practice, if he doesn&#39;t get a big head about having been published so young. But how is a person to know how to improve their writing if everyone says, &quot;Well, it&#39;s only my opinion, but I personally happen to dislike your work,&quot; rather than, &quot;Your characters have no realistic motivations, and your heroine is flatter than a cardboard cutout. You need to fix that&quot;?<br><br>Saying I enjoy a piece of literature, and saying I think it&#39;s well-written, are two different things. I can read &quot;A Little Princess&quot; and admit that Sara Crewe is a Mary Sue while still enjoying the book thoroughly. I can wade through fifty pages about the Paris sewers and still enjoy &quot;Les Miserables&quot;.<br><br>If we don&#39;t critique each others&#39; writing, how are we ever going to get any better at it?</p>

            <p>That argument applies to a lot of things, but not quality. Some people don&#39;t like some genres. I myself can&#39;t stand and don&#39;t read horror and tragedy. However, this is entirely separate for how good the thing is, and it&#39;s a poor reviewer indeed who mistakes their personal dislike for shoddy construction. <br><br>Also, say we assume that everything is based on opinion. You posted it to a public forum, thereby exposing it to the judgement of others, and they have judged that writing needs to follow certain rules to be acceptable. If they judge that your story does not follow these rules, then you should accept their opinion. If you really wanted only your opinion to matter, then you probably shouldn&#39;t have put it under others&#39; scrutiny.</p>

            <p>Sure, some of what&#39;s good or bad is pretty subjective. If we&#39;re targeting your story, though, we&#39;re not doing it because it&#39;s mostly competent and we just don&#39;t like the direction it&#39;s heading. We&#39;re doing it because it contains glaring problems in the building blocks of the story: characterisation (especially in characters from canon), world-building, sentence structure, plotting and pacing, among others. These aren&#39;t subjective; they&#39;re objective standards, and to get our attention, you need to have failed them pretty hard.<br><br>((Some of that might come across as a bit rude. :-( But I think that&#39;s the general message we need to get across.))</p>

            <p>Good and bad could be something subjective, however, if your story do something like turning a character who is pure good into a genocidal maniac without a credible reason, or that your &#39;writing&#39; consists of blind plagiarization of canon with badly-thought additions, you could at least ask yourself some questions. <br><br>Granted, failing at that level is pretty rare, but the fact is that there is some elements which will show your writing under a bad light, no matter the opinion. Some things just cannot be done. Besides, writers are always the wort type of judges when their own work is concerned, hence the concept of beta-reader.<br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>...though most of them will merely be spectating. The ones who will be singing will be Falc, Rayner, and possibly Cupid and Lapis. I&#39;m a pretty good singer so I guess Falc would be as well, Rayner comes from a continuum with a lot of musical numbers, the canon Pit (and thus Cupid by extension) is voiced by someone who used to be a part of Kidz Bop, and I figure this would give me a good opportunity for Lapis to break out one of her prized possessions: a lyre, like the one Nando uses in the Diamond/Pearl anime.</p>

I wanted to show how she can easily lose concentration, and go over to a completely different matter in span of seconds, but also didn&#39;t want to leave the &quot;Ka-boom/Psshht&quot; joke from the early drafts.

            <p>Valon Vance and Kala Jeng were the first to arrive in the Really Very Tiny Auditorium; the former wasted no time in gleefully emptying one of his vest's many pockets of equipment. It took him about three minutes to get the microphone, speakers, Jukebox of Infinite Music (really just his battered laptop), and chairs set up.</p>

<p>Kala looked at him questioningly. "Are you sure anybody's gonna show up? Some people think that singing is Sueish..."</p>

<p>"Come on, I sing all the time, and I'm glitter-free! I also posted flyers in the Cafeteria."</p>

<p>"...does anyone even <i>go</i> to the Cafeteria?"</p>

<p>"We'll find out!"</p>

<p>((We're not gonna get to the singing right away. First, just introduce your folks as they come in!))</p>

            <p>Close to each other, the two men were almost of a height, though Chakkik was far, far bulkier. Valon read the note and grinned. “Didn’t know you liked metal, Chak.”</p>

<p>Chakkik gave him a Look.</p>

<p>“…yessir.”</p>

<p>As the gigantic blond man stood before the microphone, a few somber piano notes filled the auditorium. After a few bars…</p>

<p>“<i>I’m gazing upward, a world I can’t embrace… <br>
There’s only thorns and splinters, venom in my veins… <br>
It’s okay to cry out, when it’s driving you insane… <br>
But somehow, someday… I’ll have to face the pain.</i>”</p>

<p>Chakkik’s voice was deep, mournful, and thrumming; it wouldn’t have been out of place in an opera. He had approached the stage reluctantly, but when guitars and drums joined the piano, he threw himself into the song.</p>

<p>“<i>I’m begging for forgiveness, everything I’ve done… <br>
If God is listening, he knows I’m not the only one. <br>
It’s okay to lash out from the rules that I’ve enslaved… <br>
But somehow, someday! I’LL HAVE TO TURN THE PAGE! </i>”</p>

<p>He kept his eyes tightly closed throughout his entire performance. He prayed desperately that the melancholy he was feeling wasn’t showing on his face.</p>

<p>“<i>My heart’s an endless winter, filled with rage… <br>
I’m looking forward to, forgetting yesterday… </i>”</p>

<p>Chakkik was silent for a few seconds. When the music returned, he practically roared the lyrics.</p>

<p>“<i>… it’s all gone COLD! And no one wants to change! <br>
It’s all so WRONG! And no one wants the blame! <br>
It’s all gone COLD! There’s nothing left to gain! <br>
It’s all so WRONG! But who am I, who am I to say!?<br>
To say… It’s all gone cold, BUT WHO AM I TO SAY!?
It’s all gone cold… but WHO AM I? WHO AM I TO SAY! </i>”</p>

<p>He finally opened his eyes as all but the piano faded.</p>

<p>“<i>Cold…</i>”</p>

<p>((If you're wondering, the song is Cold, by Five Finger Death Punch.))</p>

            <p>"But you'll have to do this anyways.And given the way you sang, you shouldn't be worried," Marina said as she was going on stage, making sure she didn't touch anything electronic on her way. Once she was before th micro and the usic began, she began to sing in a rather low voice.</p>

<p><i>
When can we do this again?</i></p><i>

<p>When can I see you again?

<p>Switch on the sky and the stars glow for you
Go see the world 'cause it's all so brand new
Don't close your eyes 'cause your future's ready to shine
It's just a matter of time, before we learn how to fly
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
There's something in the air you can't deny</p>

<p>She then left the stage with a short bow to the public. At least, she hadn't stumbled at any moment during the song.</p>

            <p>"Nice job," she said, then gulped when she realized it was her turn. Slowly, feeling like she was being dragged before the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, she climbed onto the stage and took the microphone in her shaking hands, biting out the name of the song to Valon.</p>

<p>Ix had to glance behind her to reassure herself that no, not everyone was staring at her, before turning back when the music started. She closed her eyes; she knew the words by heart as it was, and it was easier to pretend she was somewhere that wasn't crowded with upwards of thirty people.</p>

<p><i>"Struck by lightning, sounds pretty frightening</i></p><i>

<p>But you know the chances are so small</p>

<p>Stuck by a bee sting, nothing but a bee thing</p>

<p>Better chance you're gonna bite it at the mall</p>

<p>But it's a twenty-three four-to-one</p>

<p>That you can fall in love by the end of this song</p>

<p>So get up, get up</p>

<p></i><p><i>Tell the bookie put a bet on &quot;not a damn thing will go wrong!&quot;&quot;</i></p></p>

<p>She was grinning now; she must have lost track of all the times she had listened to this song, trying to take comfort in the words. Though she didn't begin dancing—impossible with her bad leg—she did start swaying in place slightly.</p>

<p><i>"The odds are that we will probably be alright</i></p><i>

<p>Odds are we're gonna be alright, odds are we're gonna be alright tonight</p>

<p>The odds are that we will probably be alright</p>

<p></i><p><i>Odds are we&#39;re gonna be alright, odds are we&#39;re gonna be alright for another night!&quot;</i></p></p>

<p>By the time she reached the end of the song, her voice had lost its quaver of fear and she replaced the mic with a huge smile, turning to look at Marina. "I do okay?"</p>

Turned about, this one had created this Renfield and several others to get the police and my master off his back to make his escape." Marina grimaced. "Anyways, that was when he learnt about me. A week later, more or less, he was in our living room, speaking about magic, and 'asking' to take me as his apprentice, underlining how I had doged another bullet back in this alley. Remember when I talked about the Laws of magic in my 'verse? Killing a human is the first one. The only reason I got away with this was because a Renfield's mind is destroyed when he's created, meaning there is nothing really human left. Otherwise, it would have been judgement and decapitation. And even with that, he wasn't so sublte about stressing the fact this apprenticeship was also a probation of some sort."</p>

            <p>"Using black magic, even accidentaly, <i>will</i> taint your mind, driving you to use it more and more until there is nothing left of it. And between the fact there is too many people in the world to monitor, it can become ugly pretty quick. It leads to a pretty brutal way to deal with the problem, the only exceptions are when the use is 'justified', like killing someone in self-defense, or if the potential warlock surrenders himself of his own will. But even there, there is still the need for another wizard to accept to take the convict as an apprentice, and make sure he doesn't turn again to black magic, or he's killed. And his mentor too, if the apprentice is still with under his direct care at the moment. They call this the Doom of Damocles. Even if there was no technical ground to use this with me, you could say I was pretty lucky here."</p>

            <p>"Like I said it also covers things like Mad-Eye using metamorphosis against soemone. The catch in my world is that by trapping a human mind in a form which cannot handle it, you can destroy it. And there is the Obliviate spell. The human is considered so important, and mental damages are so terrible that there is two laws against black magic here, one against entering the mind of another person and another against any form of manipulation. You can project illusions at best. As for the time travel, imagine someone addicted to it, able and willing to use it against its foes, but cunning enough for not leaving traces. And, even if he's not cunning enough, imagine someone leaving all sorts of time paradoxes behind. I'm sure you can see how bad it would be."</p>

            <p>Her supernaturally-enhanced voice did come in handy for certain songs, after all. She pulled the mic off the stand and began dancing along with the opening of the song, mimicking Countess Coloratura's dance moves in the episode. Standing under the spotlight caused her skin to take on the same odd gleam the Cullens' did under the lights at Bella's graduation party. It only served to enhance her performance, if you asked her.</p>

<p><i>"Time for the spectacle</i></p><i>

            <p>But without a goddess to guide him, a fit of stumbling around trying to put himself in front of the mic would have to do.</p>

<p>Having told the name of the song to Valon, Cupid cleared his throat, and as the music began to play, he  aimed a deliberate glance at Violet and hoped that his voice wasn't slurred. Though Sarah's temporary alcohol ban may have helped somewhat.</p>

<p><i>"I was so high I did not recognize</i></p><i>

<p>Cupid's voice was almost angelic as he continued. Okay, it WAS angelic. Flapping his wings and tapping his toes to the beat, it was surprising to see that this normally alcoholic, scatterbrained youth could sing so well.</p>

<p>By the time the song ended, he bowed, spreading his wings one last time. If only Stephanie could see him now - Oh, wait.</p>

<p>The first few notes of Halestorm's "Mayhem" pounded from the speakers, and Kala lost herself to the metal. She whipped her head back and forth, her side-tail flying around her ear.</p>

<p>"<i>I'm so bored with... this world that spins around me... used to make me dizzy...</i>"</p>

<p>Kala's singing voice was high, with a faint rasp; the kind of voice common to all metal vocalists, the kind that can turn into a scream at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>"<i>A little mayhem never hurt anyone, when'm I gonna get some...<br>
A little bedlam, till I'm coming undone, when'm I gonna get some...</i>"</p>

<p>And indeed it did; she put a great deal of force into her voice, compounded by the fact that her legs and pincers were constantly clicking and tapping with the song's drumbeat.</p>

<p>This reached an extreme in the song's bridge, where she punctuated each line by pounding the floor with her pincers, so hard that the entire auditorium shook.</p>

<p>"<i>I wanna feel the chaos <br>
I wanna hear the uproar<br>
A little pandemonium<br>
I know I'm not the only one<br>
I wanna be, blown away<br>
I wanna feel the walls shake<br>
I wanna feel the walls shake!<br>
I WANNA FEEL THE WALLS SHAKE IT SHAKE IT SHAKE IT SHAKE IT SHAKE IIIIIIIIIT!</i>"</p>

<p>That last scream nearly blew out her voice, but she soldiered on with the last few lines of the song.</p>

<p>"<i>LOOKIN' FOR SOME MAYHEM, LOOKIN' FOR SOME MAYHEM! Yeeeaaaaaaaaaa-AAAAAAA-<b>AAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!</b></i>"</p>

<p>She concluded the song by thrusting the mic above her head, her chest heaving with her ragged breathing.</p>

            <p>The Aviator was standing by the doors, her arms crossed tightly over her chest. "And I <i>still</i> can't believe you tried to get me to sing that crap with the Librarian! Do you have any sense of decency?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Zeb said, his ears flat against his skull. "I just thought—"</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, you thought wrong."</p>

<p>Both agents were silent for a moment.</p>

<p>"I just thought you would have fun if you tried it," Zeb said quietly.</p>

<p>The Aviator barked out a harsh laugh. "Yeah, fun. What's so fun about getting up there and singing in front of a bunch of people?"</p>

<p>Zeb shrugged. "I thought it was," he said quietly. His ears pricked up slightly. "C'mon, please? Just one? I'll let you pick," he added hastily.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's awful generous of you." The Aviator sighed and looked around. "I dunno. I mean, my glitter's bad enough as it is..."</p>

<p>"It's karaoke," Zeb said desperately. "Everyone's doing it and I don't see the DIA running in to arrest them for turning into Sues."</p>

<p>The Aviator hesitated. She hadn't sung in centuries, after all, but she still remembered how much she used to enjoy doing it.</p>

<p>"Just one?" Zeb tried again.</p>

<p>"...Oh, f\*\*\* me, I must be crazy. Fine. But only because you asked nicely." </p>

<p>And just like that, Zeb's face split into a massive grin. "Yay! Thank you!"</p>

<p>The Aviator swallowed and headed up to the microphone, where she told Valon the name of the song. Gripping the mic almost hard enough to break it, she listened to the few opening bars, prayed for a low glitter count by the end, and began to sing.</p>

<p><i>"Heart beats fast</i></p><i>

<p>Colors and promises</p>

<p>How to be brave?</p>

<p>How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?</p>

<p>But watching you stand alone,</p>

<p>All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow.</p>

<p></i><p><i>One step closer...&quot;</i></p></p>

<p>She realized her throat was beginning to tighten, but she powered on, pouring her heart into the music. Her voice sounded... good. Too good, and she hated it, certain that her tracker was already beeping.</p>

<p><i>"I have died every day waiting for you</i></p><i>

<p>Darling, don't be afraid I have loved you</p>

<p>For a thousand years</p>

<p></i><p><i>I&#39;ll love you for a thousand more....&quot;</i></p></p>

<p>When she reached the end, she put the mic back on the stand. Her cheeks were wet, and she reached up to dry them as she hurried off the stage. Stupid emotions. Stupid karaoke night. Stupid, stupid, stupid everything.</p>

            <p>The Librarian looked at the stage. "Wait, is that Desdendelle over there...?" The Time Lord squinted at his partner and cupped his chin with a hand. "His singing voice is rather poor," he said when the cyborg was done singing, "but I must admit to not feeling as annoyed as I would have it if would have been anybody else." He tilted his head, a confused expression on his face.</p>

<p>"Because, Sir Jesse," Alleb said, practically skipping. "it will be fun!"</p>

<p>Jesse snorted. "Fun for <i>you,</i> maybe."</p>

<p>Alleb's smile grew a little wider. She looked out over the assembled group, to the stage. "Should we play now, do you think?" she asked, readjusting her grip on her flute case. "There is no one up--" She cut herself off, staring at a specific person in the crowd. "Oh, dear..."</p>

<p>"What?" Jesse asked, then followed her line of sight. His scowl turned itself into a wolfish grin with uncomfortable alacrity. "Y'know, Alleb, I think you're due for a doctor's appointment."</p>

<p>Alleb rounded on her partner. "Sir Jesse, if you even <i>think</i> about--"</p>

<p>"HEY DOC!" Jesse shouted, already starting towards the Doktor. "HOW YA DOIN'?"</p>

<p>Alleb set her teeth, sighed, then followed her partner as one walking to her doom.</p>

            <p>Des walked around for a while, muttering to himself. He did, however, raise his head when he heard someone else starting to sing. It was the man he talked to just a moment ago. With a sigh, the cyborg looked around, trying to find his partner; when he saw him sitting with the Aviator, he decided to let the Time Lord be for the moment.<br>
Then the song was over and the stage stood empty. Tugging at his faceplate, Des made his way onto the stage. "Can you get Pippin's song? From <i>Return of the King</i>? Good."<br>
He cleared his throat, waited for the music, then started singing: "<i>Home is behind, the world ahead,<br>And there are many paths to tread<br>Through shadows, to the edge of night,<br>Until the stars are all alight.<br>Mist and twilight, cloud and shade,<br>Away shall fade! Away shall fade...</i>"<br>
Afterwards, he bowed curtly and hopped off the stage, feeling decidedly worse. "Dammit," he mumbled, "I managed to make myself sad again."</p>

            <p>He needed to clear his ideas after his... less than stellar conversation with Desdendelle. Comforting to know he still mastered the art of putting his foot in his mouth. Only thing left was hoping it wouldn't affect his performance.</p>

<p>When he had learnt about this karaoke event, he had been thinking furiously about the songs he would sing, and had finally ended up throwing a dice for reaching a decision. At least the result looked it would fit with most of the precedent ones. Oh well, you only live once, and he liked being here. He always liked singing. Now, the question was, would people like it too?</p>

<p>"So, for this time I'll go with <i>Please Don't Say You Love Me</i>, by Gabrielle Aplin. Hope you'll appreaciate it."</p>

<p>Richard sung quietly, trying to his best to match the tune of the music. One of his hands was slowly whirling around, on the rythm of the song. He moved a bit before the micro, sometimes closing his eyes. </p>

<p><i>Summer comes, winter fades
Here we are just the same
Don't need pressure, don't need change
Let's not give the game away</i></p><i>

<p>There used to be an empty space
A photograph without a face
But with your presence, and your grace
Everything falls into place</p>

<p>Just please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back
Doesn't mean my heart stops skipping when you look at me like that
There's no need to worry when you see just where we're at
Just please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back</p>

<p>Heavy words are hard to take
Under pressure precious things can break
And how we feel is hard to fake
So let's not give the game away</p>

<p>Just please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back
Doesn't mean my heart stops skipping when you look at me like that
There's no need to worry when you see just where we're at
Just please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back</p>

<p>And fools rush in
And I've been the fool before
This time I'm gonna slow it down
'Cause I think this could be more
The thing I'm looking for</p>

<p>Just please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back
Doesn't mean my heart stops skipping when you look at me like that
There's no need to worry when you see just where we're at
Just please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back</p>

<p>Please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back
Doesn't mean my heart stops skipping when you look at me like that
There's no need to worry when you see just where we're at
Just please don't say you love me
'Cause I might not say it back</p>

<p></i><p><i>Just please don&#39;t say you love me
&#39;Cause I might not say it back</i></p></p>

<p>He then bowed,  waiting for the public's reaction.</p>

<p>Marina smiled, though said smile didn't reach her eyes. "I'm a wizard from the <i>Dresden Files</i>, thank you very much. Now, this little joke was funny, but honestly? I'd take this show over your piece of White Court propaganda as a continuum of origin any day. Elementary logic is still logic."</p>

            <p>"Could you please trying to stop that? I would prefer to not discovering if I can trigger a soulgaze with this disguise on, thank you very much." She then composed herself and turned in the way of Ix. "Yes, I'm a wizard. Although magic follow... different rules in my world. If you except evocation, the quick and dirty use of power in combat, most of the spells need quite a preparation,  materials, a focus and power, so no turning people into weasels with a twig there. And there is Laws about what you cannot do with magic on humans, lest your soul be corrupted bit by bit until you become a raving psychopath only deserving death. And metamorphosis like the one I talked about would be breaking the second of these laws, for example."</p>

<p>"I recommend the series if you're searching urban fantasy," Richard said, sounding more cheerful, "Butcher do quite an interesting work with it, and some variations on the theme of classic monsters like vampires, werewolf... And the snark is wonderful. Now that's good first-person prose."</p>

            <p>"It's not a problem at all. Do you really think people would dislike you just because you were victim of a monster and survived? If wizards in your world think that way, that only means they're idiots. In my world, no kind of werewolf is 'contagious', so you would have ended up dead. The most similar thing we have in our were Red Court 'half-vampires', and the ones who were victims had founded their own organization against them. Most of them are dead, but since the Red Court vanished too, they'd said that was a fair deal."</p>

<p>"She's right," Richard said. "About the idiot part, I mean. There is no logic reason for being hostile at you. When in the Potterverse are you coming from?" He then turned to face Charlotte. "And you, for that matter? From what I understand, eating animals isn't exactly the first reflex of sparkelpires in this 'verse. No offense meant for you," he hastily added.</p>

            <p>"You didn't exactly like Lottie," she said quietly. </p>

<p>Charlotte rolled her eyes. "Ix, loads of people don't like me because I'm a <i>sparklepire</i>," she said derisively. "I wouldn't worry about it. And the both of us are from fics," she said, turning to Richard. "I was a bit comic relief BFF for a Sue destined to be Edward's soulmate, and Ix here was from an unfinished angstfic. Dunno how she ended up being such a little ball of sunshine."</p>

<p>"Shut up," Ix mumbled.</p>

<p>"And she mentioned she was a year above one Mister Teddy Lupin," Charlotte added in a sing-song voice, giving Ix a playful grin.</p>

            <p>"So she was a stalking psychopath? More seriously, werewolves are still ill-viewed after Voldemort's death? What's the problem with wizards in this 'verse?"</p>

<p>"Too easy way to reach power," Marina said. "Having a twig which let them do anything, provided they have got some vocal chords, must let them feel almighty and haughty, present company excluded. And my problem is with vampires, most of them who are card-carrying murderers, especialy in my world, although I couldn't have discovred magic without that Renfield. Now, if I found a vampire who genuinely hated the way his life is, it could be different, but if you forget the half-vampires I mentionned, the other vampires gain their powers through murder of another person, or are so twisted that nothing is left from the person they were. As for my origins, I'm not sure exactly."</p>

<p>"To be fair, most of the White Court vampires don't seem to know anything about the supernatural world before their first kill, most often an involontary one," Richard said, "Their parents think the trauma make them better predators. And if you want a sympathic vampire, you have Harry's half-br— Whoops, spoilers," Richard said, putting his hand before his mouth.</p>

            <p>But Ix gave a tiny smile and took a deep breath, beginning to sing. Her voice was a lovely soprano, if a bit warbly from nerves.</p>

<p><i>"Our whole universe was in a hot dense state,</i></p><i>

<p>The Earth began to cool,</p>

<p>We built a wall (we built the pyramids),</p>

<p>Math, science, history, unraveling the mystery,</p>

<p></i><p><i>That all started with the big bang (Bang)!&quot;</i></p></p>

<p>Charlotte clapped lightly, but Ix wasn't done, instead launching straight into the next verse. Her voice was stronger now, having gotten over the initial nerves.</p>

<p><i>""Since the dawn of man" is really not that long,</i></p><i>

<p>As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song.</p>

<p>A fraction of a second and the elements were made.</p>

<p>The bipeds stood up straight,</p>

<p>The dinosaurs all met their fate,</p>

<p>They tried to leap but they were late</p>

<p>And they all died (they froze their asses off)</p>

<p>The oceans and Pangaea</p>

<p>See ya wouldn't wanna be ya</p>

<p></i><p><i>Set in motion by the same big bang!&quot;</i></p></p>

<p>"How about you save the rest for the microphone, hun?" Charlotte said, putting a hand on Ix's shoulder before she could continue.</p>

<p>"O-oh, sorry," Ix said, turning beet red. "I'll shut up now."</p>

<p>"It was good, though," Charlotte said, grinning.</p>

<p>Ix shrugged morosely. "Not as good as you."</p>

<p>Charlotte rolled her eyes. "Oh, come off it, I've got a supernaturally enhanced voice; of course I'm going to sound good. You—" She poked Ix in the chest. "—should be proud."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Marina had gone through one of Richard's notebooks of songs. "What do you people think about a song called <i>I See Fire</i>?"</p>

<p>"You guys seriously don't know who she is?" She said. "That's the Aviator—half the agent team responsible for single-handedly taking down both Rose Potter <i>and</i> Little Miss Mary. She started off a human, got killed and turned into a Time Lord, and went nuts after she thought her partner died. Stole a TARDIS, ran away for a month, came back a few centuries older with some pretty high glitter levels. She's got a bit of a reputation."</p>

<p>"Richard, what's this reaction?" Marina said, "Reminds me the way you acted at the end of our discussion with this cyborg, Desdendelle."</p>

<p>"Simply put? I admire her. The Flowers threw almost anything at her, and she's still here. She and Zeb are on of the two teams having taken down two Legendary badfics. The reports about her missions were one of the main thing which led me to go to Freelance. I thought about the Floaters Division for a moment, before remembering I wouldn't stomach potential Bad Slash. And I honestly think that's glitter story is duckheck."</p>

<p>"Well, she clearly didn't get any advantage out of these missions. She looks like some of the survivors of the worst part of the war with the Red Court. Is glitter level fueled by pain or what?"</p>

            <p>Charlotte began ticking them off on her fingers. "Excessively tragic backstory, turning into a Time Lord, even more tragic stuff, becoming famous in a short amount of time—I think she was here for about a year before taking out Rose Potter and regenerating—becoming some amazing TARDIS pilot, a lot of angst..." She shrugged. "I don't know the full details but it's obvious the Flowers are worried, and for good reason. I mean, seriously, it sounds like something right out of a really bad fanfic."</p>

            <p>"Tragic is trajeck if it doesn't involve long-term emotional scars, and unless I suddendly became blind and deaf, it doesn't look like this tragic was pushed aside like nothing given the way she looked like on stage. Pain like this cannot be feigned. </p>

<p>Turning into a Time Lord may seem cool, but that also means new body with bizarre abilities and no ducking way to be prepared to these problems, leading to serious identity troubles, identity troubles not helped when the two following missions in a row were about a Time Lord Sue, especially a 'human' one looking like her. Upstairs could just as well have rigged her console to say 'you're a filthy Sue' and get the same result. Oh, and becoming an alien from another universe means kissing goodbye to World One and her whole family on the long term, family that she can potentially outlive down to the last generation now. Now that seems like a wonderful boon giving you no reason for angst.</p>

<p>And about the moment she took down <i>Rose Potter</i>: the ducking Flowers threw the mission at her feet, what was she supposed to do, refuse or die? And Zeb was a pure newbie at this moment, and nobody is screaming glitter here. Celebrity has more to do with more missions being available to the random folk like me, and she clearly don't get any advantage of it. I mean, the Flowers threw her into <i>Little Miss Mary</i> after she had shown signs of snapping, when their usual politic is forced stay in FicPsych, because they 'care about our sanity', if only for efficiency. Sending some Neo-Black Cats to gun her down in her sleep would have been just as much subtle. They threw that much things at her, and now she's punished for surviving this, when she's already broken by this? That would be like blaming Ix for being a werewolf.</p>

<p>As for TARDIS piloting, like you said she had centuries to get better, and if I understood gossip well, she came back fesh of the Time War, meaning daily do-or-die situation where dying a way which lets you regenerate is actually a stroke of luck if I get this right.</p>

<p>That looks like badfic stuff indeed. Keywords here are 'looks like', given the fact she never got nothing on a silver platter, and paid full-force for anything thrown at her. If anything it looks like more some god decided to have some sick fun torturing someone to oblivion, and she's supposed to be <i>blamed for that</i>? Like the Flowers would said, that's compost. Period. Harry Dresden got a similar roller-coaster of Hell in his own life, and you would have to be mad to call him a Gary Stu. No way I'm judging someone with a similar story differently."</p>

            <p>"Looks like I struck a nerve there," she said at last. "You know, the Flowers weren't too pleased when she stole the TARDIS and ran off and a bunch of agents jumped to her defense, either. She broke a ton of rules and a load of people hero-worship her. Sounds like Aura of Smooth to me." She crossed her arms. "If you ask me, they were right to put that tracker on her. I'm not saying she's a Sue... yet. But it doesn't look right to me. Especially since she's got a pretty high glitter count as it is; say what you will about her past, but that sends up a big red flag to me. And unless every single one of the CADs used to scan her was malfunctioning, she's got a pretty high glitter count last I heard."</p>

            <p>"Yes, the Flowers are always right, and treat all the Agents the same way... Oh wait, they didn't rise a leaf when Nume came back as sole sane survivor of the <i>Subjugation</i> debacle. Suicide and Diocletian came back years later, and it didn't went much farther than stern warnings from Captain Dandy and probation. Same situation later? Whole Board on the case, with potential sentences nowhere near the standard set for any similar cases before, up to including a measure which would have been not disguised at all execution. And I'm pretty sure Agents reacted that way because now the Flowers are just sending us to the grinder without even caring about most basic efficiency. There is point where even the Laws of Narrative Comedy back down. And because the guy handling her reports just decded to hand down pretty much everything. I'm pretty sure any other agent ending up with the same public record would have ended up with similar support if people got to know what they're going through. I know I would have supported anyone in the same situation.</p>

<p>And there is this guy who pulled the Time Lord stunt first. Tawaki, right? He didn't get the tenth of the flak she got when he pulled this off, <i>and</i> ended up with a TARDIS he could fly perfectly without any form of training as if it was perfectly natural, handling these transfrmations around like free candies and he never was worried. Making up for lost time by double tapping the next people to do this doesn't feel right by any stretch of imagination for me."</p>

<p>Emphasis on tried. He then sighed heavily. "Sorry. You've got nothing to do with that, and fact is some things like geting her TARDIS back could have raised the glitter level, and they settled only for probation and tracker, at least I think... It's just like... That's beyond <i>unfair</i>. We're all doing things who are pretty crazy by the standards of our home-'verse just by being here, and we're not getting glitter levels off the charts. Besides, remember when I mentioned Dresden? Out of context, even a fraction of his whole story would be enough to get all the C-CADs we've got here blowing up, but taken inside his story? Perfectly credible and awesome story. We're ready to tolerate this sort of things for canon characters, but agents with similar problems and valid reasons? Glitters. Guess I'm still childish on the edges when it comes to this sort of things. I cannot imagine she deserved even half of this, so I get furious when I think about it. No one deserves this. We've got a <i>right</i> to happiness, duck it! Or at least for something else than constant torture until snapping."</p>

<p>"You're right, that <i>is</i> childish," Marina said. "Life is out for doing its worst at people. Only thing left is accepting this and moving forwards. You hate this? Do something about it. It probably won't succeed but it's that or whining."</p>

            <p>"And, excuse the trolling, but if going after two Legendaries isn't a big deal, why getting up at her like this? More seriously, usual records about these things always have been a mess. <i>Land Before Time</i>? Repeated updates led to constant missionning for a while. <i>C<em>l</em>br\*\*n</i>? One of the agents die, his wife go to get him back, and they earn this happiness bonus both of you talked about. <i>Subjugation</i>? I'm pretty sure everyone know about this one in HQ. It's not like Legendaries are missions that end up smoothly. I mean, they <i>are</i> designated as Legendaries after all. I'd also want to point out that for <i>Little Miss Mary</i>, only important thing left was getting Snape and Harry out of their plothole and neuralyzing them. A cakewalk compared to this horror. </p>

<p>But that's not why I'm doing this, neither because I think she's some hero needing special care. This would go beyond Suvian. I do this because I think that us agents are alone against these 'Purfecter-than-U' abominations, and if we cannot count on each other, then we've got no one left. We aren't heroes by any stretch of imagination. We're just misfits left to the mercy of sadistic talking plants pitted against the worst these worlds can offer. We're the only people left who can care, and I honestly hope I'd care as much for any other agent in this situation. I'd prefer not adding hypocrisy to my other defaults."</p>

<p>"If somebody points a C-CAD out at you after that and it blows up, you cannot say you didn't do anything to provoke it," Marina said.</p>

<p>Anyway, just so that people aren't waiting on me: <b>From here on out, anybody can write their performance as a reply to the OP.</b> You can assume Valon or Kala turns on the song you want; any reactions can be replies to the appropriate performance.</p>

<p>This came to me after my wifi ran out last night, and Skar couldn't actually write his performance with Lapis [who I indeed planned on going after Valon], so I decided to head that off on other people.</p>

<p>If you're wondering on who else is going for me? Well, originally I'd planned to reveal one or two new characters here, but I scrapped that. For now, though, know that Stephanie, Chakkik, and Kala are all going to perform.</p>

<p>Juuuuust as soon as I can figure out what songs they should sing.))</p>

            <p>...and Lapis began strumming her lyre to the music. The melody seemed to dissolve her stage fright. Now all she needed was a special friend.</p>

<p>She took out a Poké Ball and threw it into the air. "All right, Triton! The floor is yours!"</p>

<p>"Oshaaaa!"</p>

<p>As the music continued, the Oshawott started spraying beautiful jets of water into the air, making sure to aim them away from any electronic equipment. Lapis smiled, and then she sang.</p>

<p><i>"I messed up tonight, I lost another fight,
I still mess up but I'll just start again...
I keep falling down, I keep on hitting the ground,
I always get up now to see what's next..."</i></p>

<p>The performance went beautifully. The water spray seemed to form shapes in the air, of Pokémon dancing and frolicking to the music. The final <i>"Try everythiiiing..."</i> was marked by a beautiful rainbow over Lapis' and Triton's heads.</p>

<p>The blue-haired girl bowed, and then realized she was staring down a live audience . Without waiting for everyone's reactions, she recalled her Oshawott and ran screaming from the stage.</p>

<p>"Well done, Lapis!" Sarah clapped her partner on the back when she returned to her seat.</p>

<p>"Please stop it," she replied, even though she was smiling broadly herself. "I'm already in enough trouble as it is!"</p>

<p>((If you haven't listened to "Try Everything", please do. <a href="http://youtu.be/c6rP-YP4c5I">It's amazing.</a>))</p>

            <p>Without waiting for anyone else, and before Kala could stop him, Valon had already made his selection and made his way to the microphone.</p>

<p>He took a deep breath…</p>

<p><i>“It’s been!”</i></p>

<p>And with a flurry of wild gesticulations, Valon started his performance of ‘One Week.’ He never stood still for a moment; his hands were constantly flying around and making appropriate gestures. His voice was a lively soprano, loud and full of energy.</p>

<p><i>“Hold it now and watch the hoodwink! 
Cause I make you stop, think!
You’ll think you’re looking at Aquaman!”</i></p>

<p>At the first verse, Valon started drawing things from his vest, again trying to match the song: an Aquaman costume and a stop sign were the first things to emerge, followed very swiftly by a plate of sushi and a frying pan. Valon continually drew out new props and dropped the old ones at his feet.</p>

<p>By the time the song concluded, the pile of things at his feet consisted of a film camera, a katana, a giant Snicker’s bar, a bag of golf clubs, a Sailor Moon coronet, a fedora and whip, and numerous other things.</p>

<p><i>“It’ll still be two days till we say we’re sorry… Birchmount Stadium, home of the Robbie…”</i></p>

<p>When the last note faded, Valon turned, bowed, and tried to walk away… completely forgetting the pile of knickknacks at his feet. His boot caught on the pile, and he fell rather gracelessly to the floor.</p>

<p>Lapis was there a moment later, keeping a healthy distance from Valon, but having decided to help as well. "Technically, two people went before you. And I know your author enough to say that you have nothing to worry about."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but still. You know what, why don't you go next?"</p>

<p>"WHAT?!"</p>

<p>"You're already on the stage. I guess this thing is free volunteering, so..."</p>

<p>Lapis shuddered a little, but then sighed. "All right, if you insist. But if I mess up myself, you owe me. A lot."</p>

            <p>The Aviator watched, a grin slowly appearing on her face as Zeb burst into song, adding some impromptu dance moves along the way. "Kid's certainly excited," she commented, hiding a smile as she settled in to listen.</p>

<p>Her partner was good, though not incredible, but she still applauded loudly when he finished.</p>

<p>Of course, her grin promptly vanished when Zeb came running over to her. "You should sing next!" he said, putting his front paws on her knees. "It'll be fun!"</p>

<p>The Aviator made a face and lightly pushed him off. "No."</p>

<p>Zeb just started at the Aviator, giving her the best puppy eyes he could master. "Pleeeeeease?"</p>

<p>The Aviator just stared at him. "I told you, I'd only come if I didn't have to sing."</p>

<p>"Aw, come on! Look, look, look, how about this: one song. Just one. I get to pick it. And then you can go back to the RC and play with your TARDIS. Okay?"</p>

<p>Well. How could she resist that? "...Fine," the Aviator said, letting Zeb grab her jacket sleeve in his teeth and start pulling her to the microphone.</p>

<p>Wait, no, this was a bad idea, very, very bad idea. The Aviator glanced at the Librarian over her shoulder as she was pulled away, mouthing "Help me" as she left.</p>

            <p><i>Deep breaths</i>, he reminded himself. <i>You're good at mimicking people. You can do this.</i></p>

<p>Following his own advice, he took a few deep breaths as the intro finished, then launched into the song.</p>

<p><i>"You've got a friend in me</i></p><i>

<p>You've got a friend in me</p>

<p>When the road looks rough ahead</p>

<p>And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed</p>

<p>You just remember what your old pal said</p>

<p></i><p><i>Boy you&#39;ve got a friend in me.&quot;</i></p></p>

<p>Unfortunately, there was only so much mimicry could do, and he ended up having to sing an octave higher than the original song, his voice thin and reedy, but what he lacked in talent he made up for with enthusiasm, starting to dance along in front of the microphone as he sang. The fact that he tripped over his own paws a few times didn't deter him one bit.</p>

<p>He almost didn't realize when the song was beginning to wrap up, but when he reached the end, he belted out the last few lines with as much enthusiasm as he could muster.</p>

<p><i>"And as the years go by</i></p><i>

<p>Our friendship will never die</p>

<p>You're gonna see it's our destiny</p>

<p>You've got a friend in me</p>

<p>You've got a friend in me</p>

<p></i><p><i>You&#39;ve got a friend in me!&quot;</i></p></p>

<p>Done, and feeling quite pleased with himself, he turned and bowed, grinning from ear to ear. </p>

<p>"Right, Valon," he said, beckoning him down so he could whisper. "Have... what was it... Oh, yeah! 'Start of Something New'! I'll go get the Aviator." And with that, he ran off, tail held high.</p>

            <p>Surprisingly, the vehement answer came from the Librarian, who, immediately afterwards, frowned and looked aside.<br>
Des' helmet turned a little toward the Librarian, his faceplate as immobile as ever, before turning back to Richard. "I'm a cyborg, mate. More machine than man here." He sighed; it sounded metallic. "I mean: if, say, the cybernetics regulating my heart fritz out, the resurrection cocktail will kick in after a minute, but it's not pleasant.

Unless you use a disguise yourself, since being cyborg must make the singing difficult, but... No if you want to go, just do it. Sorry for the disturbance, ... What's your name?

With a puzzled shrug, the Librarian left the small group and Des turned his attention back to the conversation.<br>
"I'm Desdendelle — Des — and that's the Librarian," the cyborg said. "I'd say pleased to meet you but I'm kinda fond of my brain. Anyway, short version, since I've said this already: most of me is a machine. Right now, I'm closer to a droid than to a proper meatbag. Fortunately you can replace cybernetic body parts, but <i>un</i>fortunately, my brain is also about... seventy percent? If I remember correctly, anyway — seventy percent electronics and stuff.

<p>Marina raised one brow. "Is there any reason you look like this?"</p>

<p>"Well, amongst the Floaters in service whose the reports are available he's easily the veteran. Three or four years in this place, with some really horrible missions, so he does deserve some respect in my opinion. Reading his reports also hooked me up on the magical girls animes from Nanoha and Madoka... Euh, sorry I'm being really rude speaking about you like this. And keeping you here."</p>

<p>Marina looked a bit curiously at the cyborg "So, you're the guy we can thank for getting this wonderful trollfic? No offense, but that was quite the ride, though I guess this place was quite a ride for you, judging by your state. Anyways, what was the problem with your partner? I could swear I saw him paling when my techbane problem was aborded."</p>

<p>"Oh, that must be Kala," said Violet. "Cupid told me a little about her. She's Valon's husband and a <i>Monster Musume</i>-verse girtablilu. Remember Stephanie from the New Years' party?"</p>

<p>"Vividly," said the other three agents.</p>

<p>"So do all of us want to sing, or just Ami, or what?" asked Chris, desperate to change the subject.</p>

<p>"I'll take a whack at it," said Miguel. "I can't promise anything mind-blowing, but...it should be fun."</p>

<p>Violet nodded. "Count me in, Chris. I've got a handful of eighties songs and total confidence in myself."</p>

<p>Chris gave his partners a thumbs-up. "By the way, no amount of pleading, bribery, bargaining, or brute force is going to convince me to get up onstage. I'll sing along to the crowd songs, but <i>that's it</i>. Are we clear?"</p>

<p>"Very," said Ami. </p>

<p>"Awwww, does somebody have stage fright?" Violet teased.</p>

<p>"Shut up, Violet." Chris stalked off to the front in a huff, while Ami got the others three neighboring seats in the middle of the fourth row.</p>

            <p>The shorter of the two, a yellow MLP-verse Earth pony with an orange-streaked red mane, stopped dead in her tracks when she saw the assembled agents, causing her protoss partner to stumble over her.</p>

<p>"This. Is. Awesome!" she exclaimed, hopping excitedly in place. "There's so many people here!"</p>

<p>"<i>Fire Flash. Watch where you stop,</i>" said the High Templar telepathically as he stepped over her. "<i>One must ensure that room entries and exits are clear at all times.</i>" He straightened out his black tunic and turned his glowing blue eyes at the crowd. Despite the lack of a mouth, he grimaced as he struggled to tap into the psychic presence generated by the assembled agents. </p>

<p>Fire Flash looked up at him. "Taldaris," she said, "it's not the time to practice your psychic things. I brought you here to have fun, not for you to grumble. So c'mon, lighten up and join me! We can totally rock this crowd. With my voice and your... telepathy... thing... um. We'll make this work. We'll turn that frown of yours upside down! Even if you can't actually smile!"</p>

<p>"<i>Easy for you to say,</i>" he replied. "<i>You are not the one who has had to alter their entire way of life. I will go meditate in the back of the room. Call me if you need me.</i>"</p>

<p>As Taldaris wandered away, Fire Flash rolled her eyes. "Suit yourself," she muttered grumpily before trudging towards the stage. She then noticed Ami out of the corner of her eye. Overjoyed at seeing another native to her home continuum, she dashed up next to her and skid to a halt in a clatter of steel shoes and Canterlot day guard armour. "Heya!" she said cheerfully. "Nice to see someone else from home! What's your name? I'm Fire Flash!"</p>

            <p>"Oh, absolutely!" she said, looking around. "We'd just need a head count, and someone to send a message, and... and..." She took a deep breath. "Oh, right. Did we intr— yeah, we introduced ourselves. So, where are you from? I'm all the way from Vanhoover, hence the scarf!" She pointed at the article of clothing in question that was peeking out from under her armour's harness with a hooftip. "Alright, so maybe the scarf isn't necessary since we're mostly indoors all the time, but I think it looks good on me. So, er..." </p>

<p>The pony realized she wasn't waiting for Ami's response. She then tried to stand still for a minute and waited for an answer with a smile on her face.</p>

<p>At that point, Chris made his way over to them. "OK, gang, I let Valon know you three wanted to sing. No promises on specific songs, though," he said. </p>

            <p>With her armour restricting her mobility and the height difference between the two agents, it proved to be an arduous task. She eventually gave up and curtsied instead, crossing one of her front legs over the other and doing a quick bob. </p>

<p>"Pleased to meetcha!" she said enthusiastically. "Always lovely to meet new folks. How are y'all doing today?" In almost the same breath, she turned to Ami and answered her question. "Vanhoover is awesome! It's by the ocean so the weather is kinda wet all the time but it's nice and constant and come winter we get snow and--" Fire Flash took a deep breath before continuing. "And we're right up next to the mountains and the big pine forests of the north so we go skiing and hiking in the winter and... yeah! Oh, and they say that they're planning to lay down railroad tracks that'll go even further north and cut through the Crystal Mountains! That'll make for a good vacation, right? Yeah, so, I'm excited and how about you?"</p>

<p>She flashed another large smile again and hoped in Celestia's name that her verbal tsunami she hadn't scared the other pony off. Maybe Taldaris had a point when he was telling her to calm down. </p>

<p>She knew she'd done it right when Chris and Violet gasped in surprise, and a distinct smell of wet fur reached her. Ami opened her eyes and rubbed the water off her glasses. "I've found that with instrumental pieces, it's easier for me to make a literal, or in this case canonical, effect happen," she explained. "There are some songs I pretty much have to use to affect others' emotions, like Pinkie Pie's Smile song, or the spell doesn't work."</p>

<p>"So <i>that's</i> what you meant by damage control," said Violet. "You could theoretically use your voice as a sonic weapon, though, right?"</p>

Pokémon are monsters that come from the Pokémon franchise; the player is sent off on a journey to complete a Pokémon encyclopedia called a Pokédex, and to do so you have to capture, train, and battle Pokémon. There are different types of Pokémon, like Fire, Water, Grass, and each type has its own strengths and weaknesses. Fire burns Grass, Water douses Fire. Stuff like that. There are eighteen different types so it's like playing a really weird game of Rock, Paper, Scissors." She paused. "Did that make sense?"</p>

Navare, meanwhile, <i>hm</i>ed to himself. Once Amris was done speaking, the mage tried to ping Taldaris with his own brand of telepathy, broadcasting a simple mathematical series. In the back of his head, he could feel Apparaat's subroutines, but he paid them no heed.</p>

<p>At the front of the crowd, Rayner was actually pushing a very obstinate armored bird - who, in his words, didn't "do well in crowds". Cupid and Lapis, meanwhile, were raring to go, the latter having brought her special homefic keepsake - a lyre shaped like Kyogre with the strings between its outstretched fins.</p>

<p>"I cannot believe I'm doing this," said Falchion. "Literally. Cannot."</p>

<p>"Hey, you said your author was a pretty good singer," said Lapis, plucking a few strings on her lyre experimentally. "So I figured the same could be said of you, and birds sing, anyway, so why not?"</p>

<p>"Only songbirds, though!" Falchion protested. "And besides, what if I embarrass myself in front of everybody?"</p>

<p>"Are you SURE that's gonna happen?" asked Cupid. "If anything, the one who's most likely to get laughed off the stage would probably be me! And Sarah made sure I didn't bring anything alcoholic today, not even Bleeport!"</p>

<p>"He will," said Rashida. "Trust me."</p>

"I dunno what I want to sing, but I'm willing to try anything! I think it could be fun."</p>

            <p>"Well, I'm guessing your partner told you about me beforehand? Huh. A-anyway, I'm only singing because Rayner wanted me to. I do have a few songs in mind myself, but I kinda don't like performing in front of crowds..."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but have you SEEN his author?" asked Lapis, joining the two of them. "From what Falc told me, while he doesn't exactly sing for people, but he HAS presented papers at conferences - and once he gets over his initial stage fright..."</p>

<p>Falchion covered his face with his wing, snickering. "Well, heh, the problem is that I'm not the same as him. But eh, I'll wait until the time comes. Good luck with your performance, I guess!"</p>

<p>(EDIT: Falc is no longer disguised. Continue as you wish :3)</p>

<p>He smelled the familiar scent of Time Lord and whipped around; a rather evil grin appeared on his face when he spotted the Librarian. </p>

<p>"Nice to meet you too! And don't worry about Steph, she and I are totally cool with each other. Though our dates could stand to use less badfic interrupting..."</p>

<p>"I guess I haven't introduced myself," said Sarah, turning to Valon. "I'm Sarah Squall, formerly Stratogale. My brother-" she pointed her thumb at Falchion - "told me about you two a while ago. I was also at your wedding, but we didn't meet in person. So yeah. Hi!"</p>

Try a Timid one with EVs in Speed and Special Attack, and give it the moves Water Spout, Hydro Pump, Fire Blast, and Ice Beam or Hidden Power Electric, depending on what you want to hit. Most importantly, have fun! =]<br><br>As for your fic, well... I can&#39;t really help you. I&#39;ve never seen an episode of Arpeggion of Blue Steel, though the name does ring a bell, but what I can say is that your SPaG needs a lot of work. You&#39;re making povs, and this is a bad thing (though povs are cute and go <i>snrf</i>); especially in fanfic, we should <i>know</i> who&#39;s talking and who&#39;s point of view it is via a line break or similar scene change indicator. =]</i></i></p>

            <p>I&#39;m honestly not sure who won. I was leaning toward Gordon up until the last round, and then Julia really hit it out of the park. Her last lines are perfect. ^_^<br><br>Gordon Ramsay is awesome, though. If you watch enough of his shows, you realize he&#39;s actually a pretty good guy, and he only turns the rage up to eleven when he needs to and/or when the directors/producers want him to. I&#39;ve noticed that he&#39;s a lot shoutier on American TV than he was on British TV.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Lately I&#39;ve noticed that the PPC-related stuff took priority in my life, and that&#39;s not really how it should go. If I continue this, I&#39;m definitely going to lose interest in the whole thing, and/or make myself insufferable to others. I see it slowly starting to emerge, so I should probably nip it in the bud.<br><br>(Sorry, Voyd, I&#39;m gonna have to back away from the Karaoke RP. Maybe next time.)<br><br>Therefore, I&#39;m gonna take a month-or-so break from anything remotely connected to the PPC. Starting now. I&#39;ll get back once my finals are done, which is July 12th. I&#39;ll still be available for emails, if anyone feels like talking.

            <p>To expand, he was only allowed to enter once. Apparently, there are acceptable ways of &quot;livening up&quot; a solo sousaphone performance of the 1812 Overture; flags, costumes, a silly hat or two (but not three). You will notice that there are some things missing from this list. Just by way of example, hiding an entire fireworks display in one&#39;s brass instrument rigged to fire at dramatically appropriate moments during the piece is not considered acceptable, and indeed received <i>nul points</i> from absolutely everyone caught in the blast radius.</p>

            <p>Yes, he&#39;s retired, but that doesn&#39;t stop him crashing in and overruling the DOGA pick. Agent Huinesoron is getting quite ticked off.<br><br>He plays the harp. <i>Every year</i>. I mean, he plays it very well, but it&#39;s starting to get on everyone&#39;s nerves.<br><br>-The DOOCH are in it, of course; this year they&#39;re bringing the Buds and Sprouts to form a Children&#39;s Choir. Unfortunately Maly and Dagger aren&#39;t very good at teaching singing, so the quality is... lacking. But everyone gives them a couple of points just to be nice.<br><br>-The DoDAEG is represented entirely by CAL-9000. His &#39;song&#39; consists of standing on stage complaining until he gets kicked off, then he gives <i>null point</i> to everyone on principle.<br><br>-The DCPS is a bit bonkers; their songs tend towards the flamboyant, with occasional pressganged canon characters in the mix. (Some members of) FicPsych are arguing that they should be allowed to give negative points to penalise them for abusing the canons.<br><br>-The Department of Transdimensional Snatching and the Department of Transdimensional Hopping have somehow managed to become separate teams, despite &quot;currently and temporarily&quot; (according to the Hopping team) being folded together as Despatch. They always give each other 12 points. Sometimes they even send the same agents to sing.<br><br>-The Department of Redundancy Department is forbidden from participating, ever since they took an entire evening to introduce their team. It was a rough year.<br><br>-Nutmeg TV of course broadcasts the whole thing. And it is glorious.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Coming as an American who&#39;s followed the contest intermittently since 2009 (thanks Alexander Rybak) I can&#39;t say I know every last nuance of the thing but:<br><br>Eurovision is an annual contest held by the European Broadcasting Union, hosted in the country that has won the last year&#39;s contest. The weird thing about Eurovision these recent years is that Australia has been competing as well (but then the countries Israel and Turkey have also done so sooooo).<br><br>Basically each country participating that year sends a song and in a series of two semifinals they find twenty songs to send to the grand final. The winning country from last year automatically qualifies for the grand final the next year, as well as the countries of the &quot;Big Five&quot;, which are Germany, UK, France, Spain, and Italy. These six are added onto the twenty from the semifinal. <br><br>The Grand Final has two parts, the first being all twenty six countries singing their songs. Then all of the participating (even if they don&#39;t make it to the final) countries vote on their favourites. It used to be that the televoting (popular) vote was combined with the votes from the professional juries on a scale of 1-12, but this year they rolled out a new system where the professional juries and the popular votes are counted, presented, and weighed separately. <br><br>However, Eurovision is known to be a glitter-filled camp-fest of songs that are usually kinda terrible, combined with unforgettably wacky performances (such as Ukraine&#39;s in 2007, Finland&#39;s in 2006, Poland&#39;s in 2014, Russia&#39;s in 2012, that one time Ireland sent a turkey puppet as an act, etc). The other well-known aspect of Eurovision is how politicised the voting tends to get (until maybe now with the new voting system?). Neighbouring countries vote for each other, Russia tends to get votes from former Soviet satellite states, the UK gives Ireland points but Ireland doesn&#39;t give UK points -- basically it&#39;s Europe&#39;s new way of airing grievances instead of going to war, and it is endlessly entertaining.<br><br>I was just wondering what the HQ equivalent would look like, because I&#39;d be entertained by the thought of Bad Slash sending Luxury every year.<br></p>

            <p>It <i>is</i> possible to get multiple face and body scars; it just requires a bit of mucking around in some sort of editing program and several different screenshots.

            <p>Yeah that works. I think I&#39;ve worked out why the other link wasn&#39;t working for me, it seems that the website makes an advert play automatically before you can access the avatar creator and so my adblock was blocking both the ad and the creator from loading (and for some reason wouldn&#39;t let me unblock it), so I had to resort to Internet Explorer to try it... *shudder*<br><br>Thanks once again</p>

            <p>Do you have the ability to spend roughly £5 on it? It&#39;s not as awesome as being a subscriber for the game, but I&#39;ve found being Preferred Status really makes the game playable and mitigates the majority of the issues F2P people have. You also get 5 or 6 character slots (up from the F2P 2).<br><br>In terms of storylines, on the Empire&#39;s side, I&#39;ve got to admit that SI is my favourite (and also the first one I completed), BH is good for the first two acts but Act 3 isn&#39;t as good IMO. IA I&#39;m stuck with the &#39;Darth Zhorrid Arrives&#39; bug so I can&#39;t get past the prologue, and the SW storyline is the one I&#39;m currently working on. For the Republic, I&#39;ve only actually completed JK, but I&#39;ve got to admit playing as the Smuggler is really fun. I have started a playthrough with the Trooper but the play style is too similar to the BH so I kinda gave up on it and haven&#39;t picked it up since. As for JC I&#39;ve literally just finished Tython with mine today, but whilst the play style is interesting the story hasn&#39;t grabbed me yet.<br></p>

            <p>There&#39;s a certain amount of money you have to put into the game (I think it&#39;s around $5 or more, but I got it when I got 2400 Cartel Coins (so that was just under $20)), and that&#39;s it, next time you log in you&#39;ve got the Preferred Status. If you want to get a race besides Human, Cyborg or Zabrak they cost 600 Cartel Coins, but I haven&#39;t worked out how you get to the Market outside of the game so it looks like you have to create a character, get them to level 10 (I think it&#39;s level 10 you need to access the market), buy the race in the Cartel Market and then start a story off with them.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br><br>P.S If there&#39;s anything else you want to know, ask and I&#39;ll try my best to answer. </p>

            <p>IA HAS THE BEST STORYLINE EVER. I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed the plot twists, and the irony, and AAAAH IT WAS SO GOOD!<br><br>JC... Yeah, that one is slow to start, but once you get to Act 2, the story becomes really interesting. I love Qyzen Fess, he&#39;s a very interesting companion. JK is basically a typical Star Wars story, but it&#39;s not bad.<br><br>SI is my least favorite, and here&#39;s why: The trailers for the Inquisitor suggests that your storyline is going to have you be like Sideous. And you&#39;re not. You become a holocron-tracking ghostbuster. And you have to act like an idiot who doesn&#39;t guess what Zash is up to when it&#39;s painstakingly clear that her intentions regarding you are bad. EPIC FAIL. The only thing I liked is that you start as a slave and have to work to greatness, which is refreshing given how the other Force storylines treat you as a talented student straightaway. And you have a ghostly ancestor visiting you 24/7. That&#39;s cool.<br><br>SW? Hello awesomeness. You get to confront your Opposite Reflection in the desert (an awesome little addition that I will love forever), become a powerhouse, become the Wrath (a position that Lord Scourge from the JK line also had, actually) get to meet the Emperor&#39;s Hand, and the Emperor himself (through the Voice)! And so on.<br><br>BH is fun - Mandalorian all the way, baby! Smuggler is hilarious - and I like that you get the option to become something of a privateer for the Republic.<br><br>Honestly, I don&#39;t understand why people hate the Trooper class so much. They say, &quot;It&#39;s so boooring!&quot; to which I reply, &quot;Uh, hey guys, <i>you are playing a soldier.</i> Thus you take orders and don&#39;t rebel against the authorities unless you seriously have a death wish.&quot; Is anyone else with me on this? Also, come on, <i>Jennifer Hale</i> voices the Female Trooper!<br><br>And I got all that from just watching playthroughs of the storylines.</p>

            <p>I might have to make the Aviator and Zeb as aliens (maybe a Twi&#39;lek and a Togruta?

            <p>Yes, that&#39;s a very odd request, I know. If you read my last <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hNgtHU8T-hkT9JI_yQElK5E1u-0dbdIF7UCVpKQyo_8/pub">mission</a> (*cough*shamelessplug*cough*) then you know why. If not, well, the fic kind of spawned a sentient Elvish cantaloupe. More specifically, a Sleep Mellon. The Sleep Mellon is free-to-use, and I&#39;m currently making the page for it, but I want the picture to be of--you guessed it--pointed Elven ears attached to a common cantaloupe. The problem is that I don&#39;t know how to use a photo editor. <br><br>Like, at all. <br><br>It doesn&#39;t have to be perfect (far from it, I was going to use <a href="http://www.californiacantaloupes.com/sites/all/themes/ccab2013/images/selecting/cantaloupe-hero.jpg">this melon</a> and photoshop <a href="http://www.ocostumes.com/htc/1619532.jpg">these ears</a> onto it), but I can&#39;t even make it imperfectly. I don&#39;t think this is too big a request to make of someone--I could be wrong, because, as I said, I have no idea how to use photo editors--so would anyone mind attaching ears to a cantaloupe and adding it to the page I&#39;m just about to create (by which I mean all typed out and ready to post immediately)?<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>I created the original planning document in August 2012, one year and half before starting to write the first chapter - and even then, I created the document in order to keep in order the ideas I already had - so perhaps late 2011 or early 2012, which means I&#39;ve been planning this story for two full years before starting to write it.<br><br>The backstory up until a certain point<br><br>SPOILER<br><br><s>Faith&#39;s death</s><br><br>/SPOILER<br><br>is a badfic that does indeed exist and Sergio is indeed from it - that one started in 2006 and was abandoned in 2010 so we can say that, in a way, the true spark point for Blank Sprite was actually set ten years ago.<br><br>The happenings in between are actually partially based on scrapped story and/or character ideas originally unrelated to my PPC spinoff. They helped me fill the time gap between the point where Mai Dire Fine ended (2007 in-universe) and when I had already claimed Sergio to be recruited (2009)<br><br>Every single &quot;Turbo&quot; I mentioned actually existed, however, some were never published (I didn&#39;t even HAVE a computer, much less an Internet connection, when I originally wrote First Turbo) and there are others that never got more than a few lines and so were never counted as an actual Turbo. The actual count might be 8-9, maybe even ten of them.<br><br>Actually, Agent!Sergio was indeed supposed to be the sixth, and a different person from the third - them being one and the same was a retcon I made around my third mission as I thought it would&#39;ve been more interesting. Coming up with a way to justify him ending up in the PPC was what gave me the idea for Blank Sprite, but I only came up with the proper plot after watching Puella Magi Madoka Magica.<br><br>And, by the way, I&#39;m actually planning to spork one of the other Turbos. I found Fourth Turbo&#39;s story still around on the net (no links - it&#39;s in Italian, so I doubt anyone here is actually able to read it), and I think it&#39;s missionable so I&#39;m doing that as part of my future spinoff.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve read them all and actually made several hit lists about who I would take out or change around in my warrior fanfictions to make them seem more... less Mary-Sue. I can try and find those hit lists for you if you want to see them, Silent?</p>

            <p>Hello, and welcome aBoard! For your newbie gift, take this plate of freshly-made SPaGhetti!<br><br>If you haven&#39;t yet read them, may I point you towards <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/">the Original Series</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">the Constitution</a>? They&#39;re pretty much the only required reading around these parts. Another useful resource you might use is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki&lt;br%20/&gt;">the Wiki</a>; if you have any questions, just look here before asking. We like it when newbies do the research. ;)<br><br>Also, care to share some fandoms with us?<br><br>Hope you like it here!</p>

            <p>I have read the Constitution, but not yet the Original Series. Oh, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll always do my research before bugging you with a question. ;)<br><br>Fandoms, see the last message on the board. I have WAY too many to count, and trust me, I&#39;m always online somewhere fangirling. <br><br>Any other questions, feel free to ask! </p>
