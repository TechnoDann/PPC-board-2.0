            <p>So I&#39;ve been reading the PPC for a veeeery short while now, and I figured I&#39;d introduce myself here. I don&#39;t actually remember what brought me here, but I think it might&#39;ve been TV Tropes? I&#39;ve finished the C*l*b*i*n and legolas by laura missions, because I apparently wanted to no longer have any love for LotR. Anyways, that&#39;s me.</p>

            <p>I prefer (and have been tested as by Pottermore) Ravenclaw. I feel like Gryffindor gets way too much love, especially by the canon, and it kinda feels like the abundance of high-profile Gryffindors was just JKR&#39;s way of finding a way for everyone to know each other. Oh, well, Gryffindor is pretty neat nonetheless, though I am far too cowardly to belong to it.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m a newbie too. Newbie buddies! I have a gift all picked out for you. It&#39;ll help you make decisions in some cases, help (or hinder) you doing damage in others. Ahem:<br><br>You have obtained a D-3. It has FOUR SIDES, not three; it is named a D-3 because unlike all other dice in its set, it has THREE NUMBERS ON EVERY FACE, one in each corner; when rolled, the number PROPERLY FACED TO BE READ (WHICH IS THE ONE AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID ON THE SIDE FACING YOU) is the number you have rolled. The D-3 is shaped like a PYRAMID.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Calliope</p>

            <p>I did not know there were actual d3 dice, very cool! We sometimes use the d6 and halve it like Scapegrace said. But that&#39;s if the DM is not being evil. Sometimes she makes us roll a d4 and subtract 1 from the roll so 4 = 3, 3 = 2, 2 = 1... and 1 = 0. Because she is the Millionth Mask, and she likes to make zero an option if she can. </p>

            <p>Fandoms of preference: I generally avoid them; as most of the things of which I am a fan have pretty terrible fandoms (looking at you, creepypasta).<br>Pronouns: He/him/HIM, DEVOURER OF COSMOS (actually, scratch that last one)<br>I was in the process of reading the Gwendolyn mission (to reiterate, I apparently want to hate LotR), but the host site had some sort of popup so I had to leave the tab.<br>Also, I actually started off on the wiki. Like I said, I think I found the PPC via TV Tropes, so then I Googled it and found the wiki, then decided to read some missions because it sounded cool.<br>Thanks for the warm welcome!</p>

            <p>&quot;Well &#39;tis better than spending this season alone again.&quot; He said to himself. &quot;And whilst home does still call, I know my friends can look after it for a few days more.&quot; He got up from where he had been sitting, the book he had previously been studying fell to the floor, now forgotten. Storme headed inside, motioning for the messenger to wait for a minute as he decided how to dictate his response. Walking to his own writing desk, Storme moved through his house, mumbling as he went. Grabbing a fresh sheet of parchment and a quill, Storme began to write his response.<br><br>-C<br><br>It shall be a pleasure to come and attend your feast. I must, however, inform you that I may be slightly late due to other plans that are currently in place.<br><br>-Storme of Hauk<br><br>Storme nodded, it looked OK, and he could not see any obvious mistakes with it. Happy the ink had dried, he folded the letter up, put it in an envelope and sealed it. Looking down at the seal he frowned. It was on an old relic of his, from when he had still called himself Auran the Blazing, and its insignia was different from the one he used now. He sighed, it was done now and not a lot could change it. Finding some silver coins, he made his way out and handed both the coins and the letter to the messenger, quickly bidding him a good and quick journey. <br><br>Heading back inside once again Storme began to write up more letters, hoping his birds could carry them safely to his friends back home. He would visit them after this was all said and done. He smiled, sometimes wishing he could go back to those times where things were much simpler, but then he would think of what he had done since and realise that, perhaps, some things are just meant to be.</p>

            <p>Stockins commented intelligently, holding up the letter. <br><br>&#39;Waurgh,&#39; He added to his essay, holding the letter up further, observing it against the light. <br><br>&#39;Gwaaurgh!&#39; He continued, eyes widening. <br><br>&#39;Could I please have my letter back?&#39; Lord Reedy asked, drawing himself up and brushing his (very fancy and expensive) coat. <br><br>&#39;Gwghaaaaurgh!&#39; Stockins exclaimed, turning around and walking off. The clattering of his equipment rose and dipped like a really bad orchestra. <br><br>&#39;Um. Can I have it back, now?&#39; Lord Reedy said, slowly approaching. <br>Go on a walk alone, he had told himself. Get away from the crowd, he had told himself. Be yourself, he had told himself. <br><br>&#39;Please?&#39; He stepped closer, feeling a dreadful, choking warmth rising in his face and neck. <br><br>&#39;Glarlrgalrgh!&#39; The short merchant argued, walking off, staring into the letter. <br><br>His knees wobbled. A weight pressed against his neck. He wiped the sweat off his forehead, and looked at his hand. It was small, thin, and weak, gleaming with oily sweat. <br>&#39;Can we be reasonable?&#39; He babbled. <br><br>The merchant spun around. His eyes were practically swirling with madness. <br>&#39;&#39;Course, &#39;course. I&#39;m a proper businessman, of course. I&#39;m being stupid, pardon.&#39; The merchant thought he was saying. <br><br>&#39;Hrrnghrrrng.&#39; Is what came out. He clattered and tinkled, pulling something out of a pocket. <br><br>Lord Reedy squeaked, as a silvery object flew out of the merchant&#39;s hand, clinking against the cobbled ground. <br>He looked up, watching pathetically as the merchant continued down the path, muttering and babbling. <br>He caught a few words, like &#39;payment,&#39; &#39;business,&#39; &#39;letter,&#39; and, most frequently: &#39;feast.&#39; <br><br>((I&#39;m probably available. Er. Probably. I might not be, but I can&#39;t imagine why.<br>And, hey, he might not be nobility - but he&#39;s a proper businessman, you know!))</p>

            <p>looked up from sweeping last week&#39;s moldy rushes off the floor to notice a pair of well-dressed women enter, stamping their boots and complaining loudly of the weather. She could tell from their livery that they were the servants of someone of rank, but the heraldry was unfamiliar to her. They ordered hot drinks -- &quot;don&#39;t care what kind, so long as they&#39;re <i>steaming</i>&quot; -- and sat down at a table near the window, far from the other customers (a family of new arrivals, poking with bemusement at their complimentary &quot;Newbie Pastries&quot;).<br><br>When their mugs of Hot Stuff arrived, they fell silent, drinking as voraciously as possible without burning the roofs off their mouths. Once they were warmed somewhat, they began to speak again, this time in whispers. <br><br>Catherine swept herself a meandering path which made a figure-eight around two tables, passed the piano, and gradually, entirely by accident, made its way to right behind the pillar nearest the classily-garbed strangers, where she found that the rushes were stuck to the floor with a glob of something rather nasty, forcing her to remain there for several minutes. <br><br>&quot;. . .stupid Christmas party. . .&quot; she heard one of the fancily-attired women mutter. Catherine loved parties. She leaned a little closer.<br><br>&quot;. . .new knights. . . think they&#39;re all that and a bag of. . .&quot; her swankily-clad associate commiserated. A new knight? Was their faith in the cause pure? Did they sally forth and return shrouded in a haze of righteously-spilled Marizu blood? Were they meritous, brave, and true? Were they -- her heart thudded -- <i>handsome</i>? (She mentally slapped herself. She had a girlfriend out there, somewhere. Farming in Vidya Gaym, or perhaps traveling Weab. . .)<br><br>&quot;. . .ugh, all the way. . .in this weather. . .&quot; Catherine strained to hear. From whence had these strangers come, in clothes of such fine make? There-- there it was! She could swear the second woman had said: <i>Tumblar.</i><br><br>How far was that? She had counted herself lucky to find lodging anywhere in Plort, but perhaps another journey was in order. Perhaps, for such a big party, the knight would consider hiring some extra help.<br><br>&quot;. . .on earth. . .serving girl. . .&quot; Catherine managed not to jump. With utmost nonchalance, she continued her circuit of the room.<br><br>((OOC: Might crash the party, if that&#39;s okay. I don&#39;t think I have any other plans for that day.<br><br>And yes, I believe this is Catherine&#39;s first appearance? I think I&#39;ve mentioned her before, though, and I have a backstory for her if you want it. It needs serious editing, but I can do that pretty quickly now that finals are just about over.))<br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>She had packed her bags and was on her way to hire a horse for the journey, when she heard a shout, and turned to find her friend and pen pal Suka launching herself across the street. Before Cat knew it, she was lying on her back, staring into Suka&#39;s grinning face. <br><br>Suka, she learned over a cup of Fizzy Stuff at the Sign of the Open Arms, was still living in the Tos province of St&#39;Artrec, where the two of them had lived as students of Arpy. She had joined the navy as a boot-polishing lackey aboard their flagship, the <i>USS Spirk</i>, although she hoped to be able to advance in rank -- her Arpy skills had advanced far beyond the level Cat had been able to obtain. When the captain announced that they would be taking a day of shore leave on Konti-Nyuum, she had set off to find Cat. <br><br>All thoughts of stalking brave knights vanished from Catherine&#39;s mind. Suka taught her the traditional Tos songs she had learned on the ship and they sang and told stories long into the night. <br><br>((OOC: So my friend is back from Germany, and I got to go over to her house to marathon watch <i>Star Trek</i> and do dramatic readings of slashfic a day earlier than I had thought (she&#39;s right here, watching me write this!). So it&#39;s unlikely I&#39;ll be able to properly join the RP. . . although I might show up later, who knows.

            <p>&quot;I am known to the noble knights of Plort?&quot; he murmured. &quot;I had not thought any of them knew my name...&quot; He sat down and reread the missive. Should he? It might be helpful to get to know the knights, especially as he one day desired to join their ranks, and he had heard they were all fine folk, but to be so bold? Perhaps the message had been sent to the wrong person. But he did wish to go, and there must be some way he could exit gracefully if it had arrived at the wrong destination. He looked about his workroom, and his eyes lit on his spectacles, Michael, and he recalled an idea he had toyed with concerning them. He smiled. It would take some planning, yes, and it would be difficult to acquire the materials and assemble them in such a short time frame, but if he could manage it, it would be quite rewarding. But first, to reply, and find an appropriate pseudonym. The young man considered for a moment, then was struck with a burst of inspiration. Yes, that would do quite well. He found a piece of parchment and a pen, and wrote out his acceptance.<br><br><i>Sir Cipher,<br><br>I offer my congratulations on receiving your heraldry. I most humbly accept your gracious invitation. If it does not trouble you greatly, I shall attempt to arrive before the sun sets upon the day of the feast. I am greatly anticipating this joyous occasion.<br><br>Sincerely, Granz.</i><br><br>Alexander returned to his door, and was surprised once more, for the messenger had waited to receive his reply. He turned over his message, then quickly hurried back inside to fetch more parchment, ink, and a slab of wood before setting out to search for supplies. It might be best to be able to see the materials he would be able to work with as he planned.</p>

It didn&#39;t <i>quite</i> take a year for me to sort it, but, er. It wasn&#39;t far off. <br>Perhaps it would have a certain drama and irony, if I were to wait and do this on the date I joined, but, mate. I can&#39;t bloody remember that far. And I&#39;ve been sitting on this stuff for so long, it&#39;s going to leave a permanent mark on my bum and trousers. <br><br>Permission! <br>Over to your left, you&#39;ll see my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y56NfwMhZ4nRoFo92XSF8wf1gceO0gtAnKvze6VlZ5w/edit?usp=sharing">bios.</a> <br>And a little walk to your right, you&#39;ll see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PwfP9luevOWVthNgjQB8zv-JLTKJLFVo238m6pQmNTk/edit?usp=sharing">the control prompt.</a><br>And then, back to your left again, sort of stacked on top of the bios, we&#39;ve got <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r_rmaVVBtr4FW63F4KQ2TPh9ubw-QT8Q6uGHLTztnj0/edit?usp=sharing">the random prompt.</a> Agents find a mysterious thing, or some such like that. <br>And last, and really, really, most certainly least, the <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1953561/1/Life-after-a-Lie">badfic.</a><br><br>And we need that explanation for the reason we want to mission the badfic. It recommends a sentence, but, mate, I could write an essay. It&#39;s <i>amazing</i>. <br>It&#39;s a Cowboy Bebop fic, and can be generalised as a big collective of melodramatic sobbing, intercut with scenes of melodramatically holding back tears. Two OCs are introduced, one of whom is a classic Sue, what with the fancy eyes, a speshul and ultimately plot-irrelevant inviso-ship, generic beauty and kindness and all, and generally acting like a sort of plot black hole. The other OC just sort of faffs around and has a stupid backstory. <br>Not a single canon is IC, and most of them only really appear once or twice within the whole story. Jet and Spike, who appear the most out of all the canons, are completely replaced. Prose is beige, the story skips over all the interesting (canonical) parts, and there... are... heaps... of... ellipses... <br>All in all, it&#39;s a cute little mess, and I could imagine missioning it. <br><br>And I&#39;ve got to thank my lovely betas, Cat-On-The-Keyboard, Granz the Ice Cream Monarch, and SkarmorySilver for being really cool. <br>And also for betaing my stuff. <br><br>So! <br>Lay it on me! <br>Even if you aren&#39;t a PG, concrit is always nice, so if there&#39;s something or other you ought to say - go ahead! </p>

            <p>But you must agree, Larfen&#39;s writing style is so charmingly quirky it&#39;s hard to tell what&#39;s a mistake and what&#39;s just him being eccentric. Did you know that Tolkien&#39;s editors kept trying to change &quot;elves&quot; to the &quot;correct&quot; spelling, &quot;elfs?&quot; I&#39;m not saying that Larfen is the next Tolkien, of course, no sacrilege is intended. Although, he might be -- it&#39;s a little early in his career to tell. <br><br>*Defensive Beta is Defensive* *Defensive Beta retreats to a hermitage to make an intensive, undisturbed study of comma placement and sentence structure* <br><br>Now that I&#39;ve kicked my ego out of the way: Congratulations, Larfen!!! I&#39;ve said this before, but I&#39;ll say it again: I never had a moment of doubt that you would get Permission.

            <p><br>Well hello everybody, I am KimchiRamen, though I also go around as AthrinAmrepyh (or just Athrin when it&#39;s not taken), but you can call me any nickname that you wish. A few years ago I discovered the PPC via TVtropes, started reading in this month last year and became a lurker ever since I finished the original series in the same month.<br><br>This will be the first time I&#39;m going to actually join a forum. That is mostly what has been keeping me from joining for I haven&#39;t been directly interacting through the internet for a long time (with two exceptions, one consisted of me embarrassing myself), and I am scared to do so as I am too used to being an outsider that&#39;s just &quot;there&quot;. But right now, I really want to remedy it, and I managed to gather enough of my rapidly fleeting drive and motivation to face my anxiety and take my first step. Hopefully, I can find what I am looking for within this community and I won&#39;t end up doing anything terrible.<br>Alright, enough of that stuff and onto introducing myself.<br><br>I am not Korean, I am a male faux Filipino attempting to cherish my time here in Nevada.<br>Yes, I have read the constitution and, like I said, the original series, along with the FAQs and the guides.<br><br>Among my fandoms, whether my knowledge of it is either sufficient or incomplete, and even though <i>maybe</i> just one of these actually is a fandom; my most prominent would probably be: Half-Life(too late to do even two worthwhile things with this knowledge) and its spin-offs; Steins;Gate, The World Ends With You, The Sea of Trolls, and several webcomics. I&#39;m also in the middle of Discworld, The Redwall Trilogy, The Dresden Files, Monster Musume(what am I doing with my life), a multitude of other webcomics and contemplating on if I should continue The Last Apprentice.<br><br>I am also a user of another wiki, the <a href="http://badwebcomicswiki.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page">Bad Webcomics Wiki (Warning: Contains swearing and NSFW/NSFB content)</a>, a webcomic criticism site. All in all, my current hobbies include playing mobile games, occasionally LoL, reading, lurking in corners, watching videos on youtube, cooking, routine practice and doing minor (or &quot;minor&quot;) edits in both your wiki and the BWW <s>in perpetual fear that I might mess up terribly</s>. I&#39;m also self-training regularly in art under <a href="http://drawabox.com/">these free drawing lessons</a>.<br><br>Lastly, I am requesting admission to the sib program under House Kind Words and a Two-by-Four. With a webcomic criticism site as my current home, it should come as no surprise that I am interested in writing my own reviews, or just writing in general, and I would like to have someone help me in my learning process.<br><br><br><br><br>Well, I finally did it. I&#39;m sorry if the post is too long, I hope that I didn&#39;t miss any questions, I apologize if I made anyone paranoid from lurking in Discord that day and I must thank you all for the strong presence of this community.</p>

Now, for your Newbie Gift:<br><br>Have a full set of dice! All of your favourite shapes: d3/4 (none of us can agree on that one&#39;s name, but it&#39;s the pyramidal one), d6, d8, two d10s, d12, and the all-important d20.

            <p>Based on what I’ve seen out of a year of lurking, you’re right.<br>What really worries me to this moment, though, is that I’m joining a community as an individual with rudimentary social experience under a kind of isolation. I’m more worried about what mistakes I might end up doing while I learn what it’s like to be part of a group like this, and what might happen as a result.<br>I hope that I can learn to be a real part of a community, and make as little mess-ups as I possibly can in the meantime.<br>But at least I&#39;m not the only one, I can now learn along with other fellow newbies. <br><br>Thank you for the dice set!

            <p>This was your first forum, too? The PPC sure is a great place to get started, huh?<br>And as for being a ‘faux Filipino’, I’m just saying that I’m not entirely a good example as a Filipino person. I may be a pureblood, but I lived in the US for most of my life, where I didn’t learn so much about the culture of my blood race. I may understand enough of the basics of Tagalog and Bisaya to hold a simple conversation to somebody speaking either one if they also understand English, but I can’t really speak either so well partly due to me mixing them up when I try to speak in one. I don’t even have any county pride to speak of.<br>So, you’re part Filipino?<br><br>Thanks for the giant fork. I may have other ways to eat myself, and chopsticks may be my appendages (making any attempt to anger those people pointless), but I’ll find a good use for this big fat fork.<br></p>

            <p>I had hoped this would turn out like the last anonymous writing prompt. People would have fun with it, then after a while the prompter (myself in this case, Nesh last time) would reveal themselves, and normally I would wait more than two and a half days, but the board is moving quickly and it won&#39;t be long before this gets buried. </p>

            <p>Wasn&#39;t that a thing where she made it clear that she was posting anonymously to get our unbiased opinions on a piece she had written based on a challenge?

            <p>The &quot;prompt&quot; in the title threw me off I suppose. As for why anonymous, two reasons: one, I thought that anonymous prompts were a thing that was done here (which I suppose means I haven&#39;t been lurking aso closely as I thought prior to actually joining) and two, I wanted people to have fun with the prompt and see what they could come up with, without any bias from my name being attached, since I know people aren&#39;t terribly fond of me, though I do hope that will eventually change.</p>

            <p>Or three, or... technically seven presents!<br><br>First up (to be appreciated by a handful of you, and fully appreciated probably by none), hot off the presses of the Nutmeg media empire:<br><br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-ExprXkSDOUaTYzNk5xb05oU00/view?usp=sharing">Tengwablocks - Tinco Attan</a> (<i>T for Two</i>), a children&#39;s book for Quenya speakers. In this short work - written in Quenya (Tengwar and Latin letters) and English (just Latin letters) - the Tengwablocks teach young kids in HQ all about the special dual form of nouns.<br><br>Second up, or indeed second through sixth... a few days ago Iximaz asked for more slice-of-life stories with the Illian family. That reminded me that for a decade now I&#39;ve had a set of short stories sitting around covering the period just after Dafydd and Constance&#39;s retirement. I hunted them down, cleaned them up, and present the series now for your debatable pleasure: <i>Envinyata</i>.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16u8IRCsbsX_FckiOq0JSNvROKw46OKb0oUY_dqfvLr8/pub">1 - Cultural Exchange</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rWyt7rl_lz9ygCv1qcJVO9xu0l_ak-Y7ODI7nJrCD44/pub">2 - Narrative Voice</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OckgffOCAi9BHdwXbmemqC0d2OU2hDibRTPoBc1wleQ/pub">3 - Aesthetic Viewpoint</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yoYm_uNIOd9IXalk6lesl_1jRp5ZBJ3-K13CyjBjdt8/pub">4 - Religious Dissent</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C3Er75xFMTUiIBy-lbIDyjsEvS4slAJggKF45UaO73g/pub">5 - Wedded Bliss</a><br><br>They span a year, from just after <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1ehKUPMIM23HraqZu8uV6kmdc5q4bKOAkuZXnHmHIASc">After Midnight</a> to a few months before Tanfin was born. After the holidays, I may move some of <i>The End of the Beginning</i> into <i>Envinyata</i>, and sort out a hub page for the series too. We&#39;ll see if I remember. ^_^<br><br>Finally, and maintaining the elvish theme: <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/Timelines/Illian-Sims.htm">I worked up a new timeline for the Illian family</a>. It&#39;s fairly rough-looking, but it lets you choose which character you want to see dates/stories for. (It does, however, contain a spoiler for the first Envinyata story, so don&#39;t look if you mind that.)<br><br>Again, I&#39;ll probably clean the timeline up later, but I felt it was worth sharing at this point. It uses Javascript, but should just show everything if you&#39;ve got that disabled, so no loss there.<br><br>I know this flood of Dafydd isn&#39;t everyone&#39;s cup of tea, but it&#39;s what I&#39;ve got done. So Merry Christmas, one and all.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think it&#39;s all excellent :D<br><br>The stories are sweet to touching to funny; I could really, seriously see shades of Maglor in...I think it was the one Kaitlyn wrote; and they were overall just very enjoyable to read. As for Tengwablocks, I&#39;m impressed you put so much Quenya together (how long did it take you?) and I think the story is adorable. I&#39;d totally read more. (I also think that if you made one for a widely spoken language it might sell, assuming a different language version could keep the charm of the Quenya one...just a thought.)<br><br>Anyway. This was all great fun to read. Thanks for sharing it with us! <br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>On page 6 (where Tinco meets Silma and Ore at the multiple rivers), the black Tengwablock has what looks like a dotless right-side-up question mark on his head. But on the next page, its &quot;question mark&quot; is upside down. Was that a drawing error, or does that have something to do with the way that letter works in Quenya?<br><br>Also, comparing the English with the Quenya, it seems that vowels are notated as a series of dots above the consonants. Would I be correct to surmising that the Quenya writing system is an abjad, i.e., that Quenya is consonants-only and the vowels are optional, like in Hebrew or Arabic?<br><br>--SOH176, whose mastery of languages clearly does not extend to the various Elvish languages</p>

            <p>The Silma (black letter, S) has two forms. The basic form is actually the upside-down version, while the question-mark should be used when there&#39;s a vowel over it. Which means that it IS a drawing error - I managed to get them precisely backwards!<br><br>You&#39;re right about vowels being the marks above (they&#39;re called tehtar, singular tehta), but they aren&#39;t optional. Well, that&#39;s not quite true: the A (three dots) <i>is</i> optional in Quenya. That&#39;s because it&#39;s the most common vowel, and the rules of forming Quenya words are strict enough that you can usually say there should be a vowel there. Example: if you wrote &#39;clm&#39; in Tengwar, a Quenya-speaker would know that &#39;clam&#39; and &#39;calm&#39; aren&#39;t valid words. That would mean the only interpretations are &#39;calma&#39; and &#39;calama&#39; - and &#39;calma&#39; means &#39;lamp&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The first one, I d&#39;awwed quite a bit at the end. And then was overcome with a strong desire to feed Dafydd marshmallows and give him hugs. (But I doubt he&#39;d appreciate that much...) I did think it was a bit odd, though, that Constance went from &quot;Dude, you need to stop hiding our relationship from everyone&quot; to &quot;Wanna get married?&quot; but maybe that&#39;s just me.<br><br>The second one: very amusing scene right off the bat, with Dafydd stealing the chocolate bar. (Do Elves have chocolate? Now I&#39;m curious if they do, and if not, what Dafydd&#39;s first reaction to it was...) And yay, fourth wall breaking! Always fun. Nice amusing vignette I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll want to read again in the future.<br><br>Third one: I&#39;m sorry, I started cracking up at Constance mentioning not liking trees. It reminded me too much of Anakin&#39;s hate for sand. That ending, though... *waggles eyebrows* Very cute. I liked it.<br><br>Fourth story! It took me a moment to figure out what was going on. And then I laughed, though I can&#39;t help but wonder why Dafydd thought playing the song in the first place was a good idea...<br><br>Last but not least, the, er, last. Not much to say about this one other than d&#39;awww. Cute and fluffy. :)<br><br>(Side note, I went back and reread After Midnight and found a missing period: <i>&quot;Dafydd, you were dead&quot;</i>)<br><br>All in all... a very nice Christmas present indeed.<br><br></p>

            <p>Hello and greetings to you all! As you have most probably noticed, I am referring to myself as Loremaster Yn&#39;Taris. If you want to make it a bit shorter (because even I&#39;ll admit that &#39;Loremaster Yn&#39;Taris&#39; is a bit of a mouthful. Keyboardful. Whatever.), then I&#39;ll be perfectly fine with the &#39;Loremaster&#39; bit being dropped. Or some strange and peculiar derivation being adopted. Either one is fine.<br><br>Anyways, my sister (whom you may know as Calliope) recommended this place to me, and I responded by saying something to the basic effect of &#39;Sure, that sounds fun!&#39;. Some days later, I then found myself sitting here typing this message you are now reading. Funny ole world, isn&#39;t it?<br><br>As for which fandoms I consider myself a member/participant/creepy stalker of, it is primarily the Elder Squirrels Series (better known as Elder Scrolls, for some strange and peculiar reason), as well as, more peripherally, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Star Trek (Mostly Voyager, but even then I&#39;m only at the beginning of Season 3. No spoilers!), Dwarf Fortress, EVE Online, and the Paradox Grand Strategy games. There are also probably a fair few that I can&#39;t remember off the top of my head, but we don&#39;t talk about those.<br><br>For entertainment, I enjoy:<br>Writing<br>Reading<br>Gaming (semi-casually)<br>Walking in Circles<br>Talking in strange accents and dialects<br>Pretending to be someone I&#39;m not<br>Plotting to take over the world<br>Dismissing my plots to take over the world<br>Relentlessly mocking everyone and everything near me.<br>Including myself in the aforementioned mockery.<br>Browsing TvTropes<br>And more, but I&#39;ve already put more than enough here, I think.<br><br>As far as just how active I&#39;m likely to be here, I do tend to hover at the periphery of any group I&#39;m a part of, occasionally making a sarcastic quip or two, and relentlessly poking fun at anything and everything nearby, including myself. Especially myself. In short, I&#39;m the creepy guy who only ever says anything to be sarcastic about something (When I&#39;m not going into Human Encyclopedia mode, that is.

<li>Which PPC mission which you have either written or helped co-write, if any, are you most proud of? And<br><br>2. Which is your absolute favorite mission published by anyone except yourself?<br><br>I figured since the end of this godawful year is nigh, I&#39;d take a bit of an informal census, so yeah.<br><br>For me personally, while I do enjoy most if not all of my missions, my personal Crowning Moment of Awesome as a PPC writer will always be my very first posted mission, &quot;Connecting the Dots&quot; (I can&#39;t do links on mobile, sadly :c). Not just for sentimental reasons but also because it represents a momentous occasion in my history as a writer. Up to this point I had never really published any story which would&#39;ve been added to the official continuity of any long-lasting community, nor had I gotten a beta reader for any of my writing. This mission changed all of that. On top of this, it also represents closure for my turbulent history on the Internet, sort of - I felt I owed it to myself to spork my old shame, to atone not only as a writer, but as a person as well. (I mean, I was a horribly immature and reckless @ssh@t when I co-wrote that fic in the first place, so...) Plus, I got two awesome agents out of it, so I suppose there&#39;s that, too!<br><br>My favorite mission written by someone else is, of course, &quot;Ring Child&quot; by Neshomeh and Tungsten Monk. The character interaction between two amazing agent teams was fantastic to read, and their antics and arguing more than made up for how utterly horrifying the original fic was. Plus, that mission is the reason why Ficubi (and E.V.L. by extension) exist! Hilarious read, great pacing, and a solid ending, complete with Bad End taking up half of DoSAT.</li>

            <p>I think I&#39;m most proud of the cowrite we did with James Shields. I got to explore my characters a little bit, something my solo missions tend to lack, and now I have some ideas for Violet&#39;s gemsona that I could explore if I do a Steven Universe fic in the future. Plus, I find cowrites more fun than writing a mission solo in general.<br><br>As far as my favorite mission ever? If I had to choose, I&#39;d say Sergio Turbo&#39;s Blank Sprite, for the same reasons he said it was his favorite.</p>

            <p>1°), <i>Wrong Start</i>. Yeah, I had some problems with it, but that was my first one, and I was rather proud of finally writing my onw PPC missons. Closely behind is <i>He Burns</i>.<br><br>2°) Well, since you cheat by asking us only one mission out of all the ones here we like, allow me to cheat back by giving the whole <i>Rose Potter</i> series.

This is not blowing my own horn - I do standup, and have done on and off for years, and I&#39;m pretty good at it. <i>Fröhliche Weihnachten</i> is just about the funniest thing I&#39;ve ever written, at least in part because I bounced off of Iximaz so well. This is the mission wherein I took on a Legendary Badfic <i>by accident</i>, and rather than make it all about how infamously bad it is, it&#39;s mostly about the Doktor und Gabrielle and building their character through sharing a very, very stupid fic. I reckon that&#39;s a good way to do it.<br><br>2) ... I plead the Fifth. (Link not here.)<br><br>It&#39;s really hard for me to pick a favourite from the stuff I&#39;ve read. Anything from Driftwood, Derik and Gall&#39;s missions, mid-period JulyFlame... it&#39;s all excellent stuff, and frankly I don&#39;t <i>want</i> to pick a favourite. What I love most about the PPC is that it&#39;s all <i>shared</i>; the individual missions all serve to build a massive, sprawling world-and-mirror-of-worlds that enhances every subsequent mission after it. This is a wonderful setting in which to write, and I&#39;m proud and honoured to be a part of it. =]</p>

<li>Well, my <i>least</i> favorite of my three is <a href="http://doctorlit.dreamwidth.org/3091.html">&quot;The Adventure of the Misplaced Musical Miscreant&quot;</a>.  I didn&#39;t really get to work with the canon much, as the badfic pretty much forced me to focus on the OCs.  It came out all right, for what it is, but I&#39;ll have to come back to the Holmesverse someday and do a proper mission.  My other two missions come a lot closer to the kind of mission I really like, exploring the canon world outside the parameters of the fic.<br><br>2. Honestly, I&#39;ve never really thought about a single favorite mission.  There are too many, and too much variety of style and cleverness between them.  I don&#39;t think I can really answer this.  Sorry!</li>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure it qualifies as it&#39;s not exactly a mission and it&#39;s still ongoing, but I&#39;d say <i>Blank Sprite</i>. Why? Because I&#39;ve come up with something very complex on meta level, and turns out I&#39;m actually making it work.<br><br>On normal missions, it&#39;s a draw between <i>Legendary Illogic</i> (cowritten with Firemagic), because we found a way to hoist an extremely powerful Sue with her own petards (and we had fun deliberately keeping every charge to see if it could reach record chargelist lenght. IT DID... and ended up being an hassle to read as a result), and <i>An Overabundance of Turbochargers and Cherry Flowers</i>, because... well, I&#39;ve missioned an old shame of mine. Makes me feel much better about Avalon: Last Rebel having ever esisted, especially since I got a second chance to write the characters from it RIGHT by recruiting them.<br><br>Favourite mission by somebody else?... But I like ALL OF THEM! Ahem, let&#39;s see. I think it might be <i>All Through With This Niceness and Negotiation Stuff</i>, by Desdendelle, Firemagic and Maslab, because of the sheer determination the Boarders and their Agents needed to get through that terrible trainwreck, and how the Agents used every single bit of their skills to get it done. You can feel how desperate their stuggle is. Well done, guys. Well done.</p>

            <p>1) My own writings suck. Bad. I&#39;m not proud of any of it. The closest runner is Hip and Hop&#39;s first mission - &quot;Lady and the Tramp: Jurassic Edition&quot;. As for co-writes, I&#39;ve only done one with eatpraylove - &quot;Canon&#39;s Bane&quot; - and one interlude cameo with Ixi so... that&#39;s it.<br><br>2) Oh that&#39;s also easy...

<li>I&#39;d have to say my favorite mission to write was &quot;What&#39;s Latin for You Suck?&quot; with Neshomeh. Partly because I was still an ickle newbie and kinda hero-worshipped her at the time and was all &quot;Woo I&#39;m working with Nesh!&quot; and mostly because I think it turned out supremely well. *finishes tooting own horn*<br><br>2. Is it any surprise I&#39;m gonna mention Nesh for this one as well? &quot;The Dark Side&quot;, cowritten with Phobos, is hands-down my favorite mission, though &quot;Harry Potter and the Dragonriders of Pern&quot; is a close second.</li>

            <p>This was going to be a banquet like no other. A giant field outside Tumblar was turned into a fair ground: long tables were almost breaking from the amount of food and drinks placed on them; on a giant stage minstrels and bards were getting ready to entertain the crowd with songs, stories, and jokes; there were different game stations as well - apple bobbing, ring toss, even the archery practice for the more daring of the Knights. Occasionally, one would spot a wooden pole, on which a purple banner would be mounted, bearing this symbol:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qmXt6aT.png" width="200"></p>

<p>"It looks quite well, Sire," a chamberlain holding a quill and a notepad said. "I-I'm sure the noble guests will be pleased with this feast. Your position is bound to improve!"</p>

<p>Cipher grabbed one of the tankards from the table and smelled it. Sweet aroma, with a gentle hint of salt. The fine vintage of Ha'ter Rayge. The Merchant swiped some dust off of his fur coat and dismissed his servant. "Thank you, Basil. For now, let's put the politics aside." He looked over and gave the man a smile. "After all, it's a feast. Now, if you excuse me, I should go and welcome the first arrivals."</p>

<p>((Ladies and gentlemen, we are a go! Merry Christmas to all, and let's have some fun!))</p>

            <p>"Are you all right, my lady?" asked Miguel from her shoulder. "I can feel how nervous you are."</p>

<p>"I'm fine. I'm just not really one for parties," she said. "I came because Cipher was invaluable help when I visited Lotor, and I really need to get out more."</p>

<p>Miguel hmm'd. "Would hearing one of the minstrels or bards help your mood? I heard a rumor Ser Read was booked to perform here..."</p>

<p>eatpraylove smiled. She'd kept up regular correspondence with the knight, and considered him one of her closest friends in Plort. However, she had not yet heard him perform. "I do believe it would. What would I do without you, Miguel?"</p>

<p>"Stay holed up in your manor all day excepting quests, if you don't mind my saying so."</p>

<p>They both laughed, and joined the crowd in front of the nearest bard.</p>

            <p>He smiled a bit to himself. The mask really did help him feel less self-conscious, and it was well worth the effort he had spent making it in such a limited time frame. He looked about, and decided he would wander through the game stations to see if there was anything that caught his eye, or, perhaps, somebody interesting to talk to.</p>

            <p>When he realized it was coming from her cloak, he angled to get a better look. It was indeed Charlotte, who, if rumors were correct, had joined her crusade relatively recently. He tried to think of something to say, and found a question he hadn't received an answer to yet. Perhaps the bat was cagey about her origins, or perhaps he simply hadn't found any storytellers who had heard the news yet, but whatever the reason, he didn't know where she came from. "Pardon me, Charlotte, correct? If it does not trouble you to say so, might I ask where you come from?"</p>

            <p>That&#39;s just how it goes--today may be the first day, but in the Jewish calendar days start at sundown, not at midnight. So last night was the first night, today is the first day, tonight is the second night, etc.<br><br>Interestingly, the weather report for NY kept mentioning Hannukah as well as Christmas? In the same breath? I&#39;m not used to this??<br><br>Y&#39;all also have practically everything I&#39;ve been wanting to watch in Canada on your Netflix. It&#39;s both awesome and infuriating, especially since it took me a moment to realize that Netflix hadn&#39;t suddenly made stuff I want to see available--I just switched countries. Almost makes me wish I was here for longer than a week, or else hanging out with people who&#39;d want to binge watch some shows...oh well.<br><br>(Er, you personally may not be American. This last bit was technically aimed at the whole Board, anyway, but...yeah. Anyway.)<br><br>And, while I&#39;m sort of addressing the whole Board, happy holidays to all! <br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>It&#39;s well past sundown where I am, so it&#39;s <i>very</i> official. <br><br>To celebrate, I finally finished a holiday filk! I know the thread&#39;s over, but I <i>really</i> want to show this to people. I put time into it and actually had to ask Real Life friends for help. This year’s encouragement to write about what agents actually do during the holidays immediately made me think of an old classic which has been a family staple since I was very young. I refer, of course, to Tom Lehrer’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LslsgH3-UFU">&quot;(I’m Spending) Hanukkah In Santa Monica”</a>. Concrit is always welcome, of course, but I’d like to request you listen to the original before claiming <i>my</i> rhymes are dodgy :P<br>***<br>I’m spending Hanukkah in Tolkien&#39;s Arda,<br>Lighting candles as I fangirl at Bilbo!<br>I spent Shavuot Sue-slaying in Gringotts.<br>Not much fun, I’m glad I’m done fighting that schmo.<br><br>These HQ winters, I can’t endure ‘em,<br>So every year I pack my gear and come out here for Purim!<br>Rosh Hashana, I spent working in Ravka,<br>And Yom Kippur in the Klingon Empire,<br><br>But in December, there’s just one place to go!<br>I’ll grab my friends in Bree a-<br>Nd we will light our chanukiyah;<br>Like a baby in its cradle,<br>I’ll be playing with my dreidel;<br>Here’s to Jay -- and Macabeus!<br>Boy, if they could only see us<br>Spending Hannukah<br>In Tolkien’s Arda, with Bilbo!<br>***<br>--Key hopes you enjoyed reading this as much as she enjoyed writing it and also hopes that you understand why it took her so long to find rhymes.<br><br>P.S. A disclaimer: Arda, the character of Bilbo Baggins, and the town of Bree are the creation of J.R.R. Tolkien; the bank Gringotts is that of J.K. Rowling; Ravka belongs to Leigh Bardugo <s>although it’s basically just magic!Russia</s>; the Klingon Empire was created by Gene Roddenberry and I think currently belongs to Viacom? Zarking corporations; it’s Roddenberry’s and his crew’s. And of course: Jay and Acacia created HQ, Jay, and the whole glorious Protectors of the Plot Continuum; Tom Lehrer wrote “(I’m Spending) Hannukah In Santa Monica” -- and, sorry, I love him, but he can keep this piece of ridiculousness.</p>

            <p>...the <b>2017 PPC NEW YEAR&#39;S GIFT EXCHANGE!</b><br><br>[APPLAUSE]<br><br>Since we&#39;re almost at the end of 2016, it&#39;s high time we all start preparing for the new year, and what better way to start than to kick off the latest round of gift giving? I&#39;ll be shaking things up this year with a few rule changes, since I thought I&#39;d try something a little different and unexpected this year. Without further ado...<br><br><b>ADMISSION AND SETUP:</b><br>1. You need to have Permission and at least two agents to enter this event. You don&#39;t have to have the teams participate in their entirety, either - any one of your agents can opt out based on whatever&#39;s most convenient for you.<br>2. This time, all of you will be going in basically blind - meaning that <b>nobody will know who sent what until all the gifts have been opened, not even the Boarders participating!</b> Hence, in order to enter, send me an e-mail (my address is clickable) with your attending agents and which gift each will bring. This may be either a &quot;souvenir&quot; from a mission you&#39;ve published previously, or just something they happen to have that they want to give away. As soon as you&#39;ve sent the e-mail, reply to this post with the word &quot;Sent&quot; and no message content, so everyone will know who&#39;s participating.<br>3. I will take six or seven other Boarders for this year&#39;s event, so the first seven Boarders to submit applications will be the ones attending.<br>4. Anyone with Permission can host this event. One of their agents must serve as an in-universe host for this event, but all agents are required to participate as players, including the host. I will confirm who the host will be if and when anyone steps forward - otherwise, Falchion will be the host this year. (My other participating agents will be my DIC and DMS-VG teams, but no other agents of mine will be participating, for some very spoilery reasons.)<br><br><b>EVENT RULES:</b><br>5. Once everything&#39;s been set up, preferably on New Year&#39;s Day, the Boarder volunteering the event host will set up an introductory post on the T-Board for this event. The most important rule: NOBODY MUST KNOW WHAT THE GIFTS ARE UNTIL THEY&#39;VE OPENED THEM. All of the gifts will be wrapped and put in a big pile at the start of the game.<br>6. Once I&#39;ve tallied the full list, I&#39;ll provide a list of the players, and a list of the gifts, but not a list of who sent what. The starting player will then be selected at random. Then when that player opens a gift, the agent who submitted it must speak up and confirm that they were the one who did so. Then that agent is the next to play! Thus, in general, <b>the person who will play during each turn is the one who volunteered the gift revealed during the previous turn.</b><br>7. For each turn, the agent currently in play can either choose a gift from the pile (I&#39;ll provide the full list of gifts on the Posting Board) or, if others before them have already chosen gifts, they can &quot;steal&quot; a gift from the previous owner. A gift can be stolen up to twice; after that, it is locked to the agent it&#39;s ended up with, and cannot be stolen again. Note also that if a gift is stolen from any agent, THEY CANNOT STEAL IT BACK.<br>8. The game ends once everyone has received a gift. Since the first agent cannot steal, he/she will be given the choice to steal after everyone else has played.<br><br>And that&#39;s that! LET THE GIFTING COMMENCE! :D</p>

            <p>OR, How I want to cover both a shameless boasting and a request for somebody who knows their stuff when it comes to music:<br><br><br>Basically, I sing. Sometimes better, more times worse. I do come from a musical family, so I started to record myself. First and foremost just for shiggles, but I do like to try and improve, so here&#39;s what I got so far:<br><br>1) <a href="https://soundcloud.com/matt-cipher/beauty-and-the-beast-the-mob-song">&quot;The Mob Song&quot; from <i>Beauty and the Beast</i></a> - probably my best cover so far. The one I&#39;m most proud of, so I&#39;ll let you tear it to shreds :)<br><br>2) <a href="https://soundcloud.com/matt-cipher/the-hunchback-of-notre-dame-hellfire">&quot;Hellfire&quot; from <i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i></a> - probably my weakest cover so far. Not only my voice was out of it, my recording was also messed up, but I do like some parts of it.<br><br>2.5) Also &quot;Hellfire&quot;, but this time in <a href="https://soundcloud.com/matt-cipher/hellfire-polish">Polish</a> in case anyone&#39;s curious. I think this one was a bit more natural for me (<s>...for obvious reasons</s>), but still not the best.<br><br>3) <a href="https://soundcloud.com/matt-cipher/aladdin-prince-ali">&quot;Prince Ali&quot; from <i>Aladdin</i></a> - the first cover I&#39;ve done. The first one I&#39;ve experimented in Audacity with. Not bad, but that&#39;s just me saying it.<br><br>So yeah... If anyone&#39;s curious how badly can an ESL guy sing - there you go :D </p>

            <p>Your voice came out very strongly at &quot;It&#39;s time to follow me!&quot; Well done with overlapping your voice later on in that song. And it&#39;s always good to hear you sing in your native tongue. I don&#39;t understand it at all, but it sounds appealing to the ear nevertheless. :) Good job buddy!</p>

            <p>Overall very enjoyable mission! My one major point of critique is that I thought the agents&#39; efforts to explain things to Luna went on a bit too long, and I&#39;m particularly not sure why they kept at it after they got her to fix <s>Garou</s> Hound Dog. (All of his dialogue was very funny, btw!) My mental dialogue with the story for that bit kinda went &quot;Right, she can&#39;t help. So neuralyze her. ... Yes, so neuralyze her. ... Wait, is this actually going somewhere? No? Okay, then neuralyze her. ... Neuralyze her already. ... Finally!&quot;<br><br>I also wasn&#39;t sure initially about things getting so dark with the wraith—the split nostril is kinda gross, and did Wobbles really have to hit her that hard, in the face?—but that all worked for me in the end, what with the character development for the Notary. Here&#39;s three cheers for Wobbles at the end, and Jenni is of course standing by to be the her that believes in the Notary even if the Notary can&#39;t believe in herself. {= )<br><br>(She&#39;s also wondering if maybe Lolus&#39; shell was a little too small or he didn&#39;t get enough air at hatching or something. Who eats a kazoo?)<br><br>I also liked Luna helping out on the mission. Well, I say helping out... going along and being only mildly befuddled might be more accurate? Which is a feat, don&#39;t get me wrong. Anyway, I liked it. Luna is cool. ^_^<br><br>Nitpick: I think there are one or two <i>thou</i>s (subject) that should be <i>thee</i>s (object). &quot;We would have <s>thou</s> <b>thee</b> explain,&quot; for sure; possibly &quot;I demand that <s>thou</s> <b>thee</b> release Our sister,&quot; too, but I&#39;m not certain about that one. It feels equally awkward both ways, and I&#39;m going on instinct more than actual knowledge of sentence construction.<br><br>... I feel like there was a joke or something specific I wanted to point out that I liked, but I paused to have food between reading and reviewing, and there are Magic videos in the background, and I can&#39;t remember. {= / I&#39;ll be sure to let you know if I do!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It was mostly because, well, the mission&#39;s message was &quot;Do not leave canons with PPC knowledge if you can possibly avoid it&quot;, which has been a bugbear of mine for as long as I&#39;ve seen it in missions. It was originally a lot more soapboxy, if that&#39;s a word, but I felt the need to explain my position in full rather than leave people in any doubt. This was why Luna tagged along, to be honest; I wanted to demonstrate that having canons help with a mission is often far more harmful to them than simply leaving them be until the canon is reasserting itself. Oh well. The in-universe explanation is that, well, Luna isn&#39;t easily dissuaded from an idea that she thinks will help people, but that feels a bit like a copout. =]<br><br>Lolus has an odd diet that consists mostly of things that he finds interesting (kazoos, POV collars, Wobbles&#39; wig, the Notary&#39;s ears). Besides, I don&#39;t know much about fire lizards, but I <i>do</i> know quite a lot about having pets one might charitably describe as being dumb as a box of hair. Shadow and Hostage, my cats, are very, very stupid. Their preferred diet is bees and the leaves from my mum&#39;s rubber plant. Lolus takes no small amount of inspiration from them. =]<br><br>Yeah, there are probably a few thous and thees in the wrong place - which I&#39;d like to say is because the show gets it wrong as well, but again, that&#39;s frankly a cop-out. =]<br><br>Hopefully the jokes you liked are, y&#39;know, most of them; my primary concern with all my missions is cramming them full of gags. I can&#39;t do concrit the same way that other people do - your own missions being a prime example - so I&#39;ve got to press my own strengths, which consists of being reasonably funny and having a larger range of baguette fillings than the average badfic. =]<br><br>Thank you very much for taking the time to comment.

            <p>On the one hand, getting the canons involved and helping to save themselves can be pretty cool, like it was here; and it&#39;s a tradition that goes back to TOS. But on the other hand, they should definitely forget about it and go back to normal afterward. There have been a few occasions when I&#39;ve had to talk people out of making more Canons Who Know of the PPC. Not recently, but yeah, definitely agreed in principle.<br><br>There are definitely worse inspirations for fire-lizard personalities than cats, and I guess if there are particularly smart ones, there have to be particularly dumb ones, too. {= )<br><br>I do like the jokes! There was something that made me go &quot;Hah, I see what you did there,&quot; though, and I <i>still</i> have no idea what it was. &#39;Tis frustrating.<br><br>Happy New Year to you, too! I hear it&#39;s going to be the Year of the Rooster soon, which is a lot more auspicious than the Year of the Monkey we&#39;ve had. I hope it&#39;s true.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. And now, a word from Jenni. She wanted a separate post, but I thought that would&#39;ve been silly, since I was replying, too.<br><br>---<br><br>Hey, Jool. Assuming this is a universe in which you ever speak to me with the intent of also listening to me, I have an assignment for you. I wasn&#39;t going to bring it up in this absurdly meta fashion, but everybody&#39;s doing journals again, and since I actually had this thought before all that kicked off, I took it as a sign that I should after all.<br><br>I think you should keep a positivity journal. Just once a week to start with, I want you to write down one positive thought about yourself. It doesn&#39;t have to be a big thing—it&#39;s not a test, and it&#39;s not being graded. It can be something as simple as &quot;hair looked particularly good today.&quot; The only rules are that the entries must not be sarcastic, ironic, backhanded, etc., and they must be phrased in the positive. So, no &quot;did not strangle my stupid partner today,&quot; but yes &quot;exercised admirable restraint in the face of provocation.&quot;<br><br>You may now commence with mocking me and everything I stand for. I&#39;ll see you next month and we&#39;ll go over what you&#39;ve written. *blows a kiss*<br><br>~Jenni</p>

            <p>((I mean, unless this is a different person, or a nickname, or whatever. This is prolly me just being thick as all hell, but if it <i>is</i> a nickname for the Notary then I either don&#39;t understand or don&#39;t remember your explanation. Either way, sorry to be dumb. =] ))<br><br>((And yeah, I kind of got the impetus for the screed against PPC-Aware Canons after reading that one Trojie fic where the canon in question is, er, Gaspode. Which, y&#39;know, I get that it&#39;s meant to be a joke, but given the established rules of the PPC, I thought it&#39;d just make agents going to Disc fics (a comparative rarity in these modern times...) have a harder time of it. I guess you could make the explanation that Sues ignore his existence so he&#39;s fine, but you could make exactly the same case for telling <i>Gimli</i> about us, and that wouldn&#39;t work -- sorry. See what I mean about soapboxing? I soapbox harder than a bucket of hand sanitizer gong ten rounds with Muhammad Ali. =] ))<br><br>((As for Lolus, I just kind of wanted him to be an adorable derpbeast, and him having a very weird diet is part of that. He&#39;s constantly hungry and cowardly and more than a bit dim, but that&#39;s just part of his charm. And he&#39;s named after Lola, who - when they eventually meet - will be <i>so</i> pleased by this. =] ))<br><br>((Any year with a Trump presidency in it is gonna be the Year of the Cock. &gt;=] ))<br><br>---<br><br>Every word was perfect.<br><br>Every phrase, every word, every thought was absolutely perfect. It was exactly what she&#39;d been asked to do by Robinson, and thus maybe the woman would get off her back about it.<br><br>The Notary glided through HQ&#39;s grey, near-featureless corridors like a tall ship in a silver sea, except with less drunk sailors piddling over the side. She was staring intently at her dataslate, but she seemed to avoid passers-by at the last second, never bumping into anything. This might have had something to do with the collision detector currently disguised (via creative use of a D.O.R.K.S device) as a tasteful stud earring, but nobody could tell for sure.<br><br>There was nobody around when she reached her destination, so she left the diary there. It was a small, beige data pad, looking extraordinarily like the scanning bed of an office photocopier, and inside was her positivity diary. They were genuinely positive, too: &quot;corrected and expedited seven 15-B requisition forms without being asked&quot;, &quot;dealt with conflict re. large quantities of custard in the Grunt&#39;s quarters calmly and without recourse to violence of word or deed&quot;, &quot;made mobile of tiny filing cabinets and properly-filled-in tax returns for Moon Moon&#39;s Time Tot&quot;, &quot;made aforementioned mobile play a selection of soothing Gallifreyan lullabies via sonic device carefully secreted in the stem&quot;, that sort of thing.<br><br>Howver, in the Notary&#39;s traditional style, every perfect word was written in a dialect of Old High Gallifreyan that almost nobody spoke. The only thing written in English, as well as in tiny copperplate handwriting that almost required a magnifying glass to read, was two words:<br><br>&quot;Your move.&quot;</p>

            <p>Actually, I&#39;m pretty sure &quot;Sues (and everyone else) ignore him, so he&#39;s fine&quot; <i>was</i> most of the actual argument for him knowing about the PPC. The rest, IIRC, was that he canonically knows things he probably shouldn&#39;t anyway.<br><br>And historically, it does sort of go for Gimli, and Éowyn, too. They don&#39;t permanently know about the PPC, but it <i>was</i> recommended to go to them for help, since Suvians ignoring them means they aren&#39;t as susceptible to the Suefluence, and can see that their compatriots are acting like idiots, and want to help.<br><br>See, the &quot;established rules of the PPC&quot; weren&#39;t always what they are now. Heck, we didn&#39;t really <i>have</i> established rules for a long time, other than <a href="https://archive.is/FH8oe">these</a>, and they were regarded as more guidelines than actual rules. Basically, as long as people liked the idea and it was funny, you could do it.<br><br>I mainly object to the idea of canons knowing about the PPC when the argument for it boils down to &quot;they are more awesome and special than anyone ever.&quot; Like... I think Sherlock Holmes came up once? And yeah, he&#39;s cool and smart and would probably figure everything out quickly enough if he weren&#39;t brainwashed by his latest daughter/sister/lover/wife/whatever, but that doesn&#39;t imply that agents should deliberately leave him with uncanonical knowledge, and it certainly doesn&#39;t make him immune to neuralyzation or canon snap-back.<br><br>I had to talk someone out of leaving a character with an eidetic memory with knowledge of the PPC, too. He was an alien of some sort and might not have had eyes, IIRC, so it would make sense that the neuralyzer wouldn&#39;t work—but FicPsych has a lot more technological resources, and even someone who wouldn&#39;t forget anything under normal circumstances can still have his mind messed with by, say, fictional chemical substances. {= P Plus, again, canon snap-back.<br><br>But I think the rules of the Disc are just absurd enough to allow for Gaspode, personally. {= )<br><br>Re. Jool, you did forget, though to be fair it&#39;s a joke from... *checks e-mail record* October of 2015. So I will tell it again, and then everyone else will at least sort of get it, too: 
<p>In closing, have a silly scene that popped into my head yesterday:</p>
<p>Jenni: So what&#39;s your actual name? &quot;Notary&quot;&#39;s a bit stiff for... informal use. *smirk*</p>
<p>Notary: *cool look* Antrilovorasilendar.</p>
<p>Jenni: *blink* What do they call you for short?</p>
<p>Notary: My whole. Name.</p>
<p>Jenni: ... Right. Jool it is.</p>
 (It&#39;s a <i>Farscape</i> reference. The character originally bearing the nickname Jool, whose part the Notary takes in this dialogue, is Joolushko Tunai Fenta Hovalis. ^_^ )<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>---<br><br>Jenni stared down at the pad in her hand, mouth in a studious twist and one finger tapping lightly against her thigh.<br><br>There were several avenues she could think of to pursue from here. Deciding the Universal Translator could negate the problem would work, but that felt like cheating; borrowing someone&#39;s TARDIS for the purpose only slightly less so.<br><br>Maybe if she got some psychic paper and copied the entries onto it? Did psychic paper even work that way?<br><br>Trying to find someone who could read Gallifreyan would of course represent an unconscionable breach of confidentiality, but merely threatening as much might be good enough.<br><br>Learning to read Gallifreyan herself would be quite the coup, but either she&#39;d have to do it in the same relative time as everyone else, which would take forever, or she&#39;d have to go be Gallifreyan for a while in a non-linear fashion, returning to the moment she&#39;d left here, which again felt rather like cheating.<br><br>She could probably get a computer to read it. The PPC had access to any data you could possibly want. That would work, and it was something anyone could do, and was therefore not cheating. It was a pretty good option.<br><br>On the other hand, simply solving the puzzle didn&#39;t quite seem in the spirit of the game, which this was. There was nothing for it but to track down the Notary in person and maybe drag her out to lunch or something, all the better to bug her about deliberately avoiding Jenni&#39;s office hours to leave her a book full of writing she couldn&#39;t read and a provocative note that she very well could. Really, if she didn&#39;t want Jenni to vigorously pursue the matter, she might&#39;ve just done the assignment and follow-up as intended in the first place.<br><br>This would be fun.</p>

            <p>I do recall you, at some point, mentioning that the idea of the PPC was for a focus on the characters - sort&#39;ve making stories about them, around the missions. You&#39;ve done an awesome job at it, seriously. I love how you used that wraith, and that final big important bit relating to the Notary that I won&#39;t spoil because it&#39;s very good is. Er. Very good. The delivery of that flashback, mate. That delivery. <br>I dunno, your characters are remarkably relatable (or likable, or whatever, at least), especially for what they, technically speaking, <i>are,</i> and, that&#39;s certainly a point in your favour, oy? What we ought to be doing, especially in a setting as outlandish as the PPC. <br><br>Your handling of Luna, too, was bloody great. It&#39;s pretty rare that we get such an insight into how the canons feel during badfic and, even though I&#39;m not at all aware of her character, or anything at all ever about MLP, I did feel genuinely sorry/horrified for her. <br><br>Er. Criticisms? <br>Well, I suppose that one bit, near the start, where they were sort&#39;ve panicked, trying to escape that first person segment, ended oddly. It built up suspense well, and was a great way of establishing who&#39;s familiar with the continua, and whatnot. The build-up was well done, I just feel that the final escape - &#39;the RA beeped a few times and allowed them to portal to relative safety&#39; is written a bit too vague, y&#39;know? I feel like with that sort of event - the end of all the build-up - ought to be more punchy, y&#39;know? More gritty and specific, as opposed to vague, and such. <br>But, you know. That&#39;s essentially nitpicking, at this point. <br><br>You have also taught me what pronking is, for which I am very glad. </p>
