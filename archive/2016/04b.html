            <p>Hey! How have you all been? I am currently studying abroad in Central Europe, though this weekend (the 23rd to the 25th) I&#39;m going to be in London, so if anyone would like to drop by and say hello please let me know! <br><br>I&#39;d also like to bring an offering to the DMS and DOGA. <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/6563209">This</a> fic appeared in the Bagginshield tag for no apparent reason (mistag?) and upon reading it I found some particularly egregious timeline and geography errors (such as being able to get from the Shire to Erebor in a month) as well as complete defamation of the character of Thorin Oakenshield (and to a lesser, more fanon-y extent, his sister Dis). Please feel free to give her a particularly heinous death especially considering she shot a Black Arrow (apparently now lined with mithril and diamonds) through Smaug&#39;s eye and into his brain. <br><br>Also, trigger warning for rape. Because of the complete defamation of Thorin&#39;s character.<br><br>That all being said, what have you guys all been up to? I see some new faces!

            <p>Good to see you back here :)<br><br>Mithril and diamonds? In a Black Arrow? Seriously? I mean, I suppose they&#39;re both very hard substances, but...*no*.<br><br>We should really finish those cowrites at some point, though I expect right now isn&#39;t great timing for you (and honestly isn&#39;t for me either). We know where to find each other, though, so there&#39;s that.<br><br>Anyway. Enjoy London, and I hope you have been and continue to have an awesome time in Prague! I will...hopefully make some more substantive comment on, well, everything at a point when I&#39;m not tired and on a break from cleaning (whee, holidays!) (but also, whee, clean room!!) My point, though: it&#39;s good to see you here again, that badfic is whaaaat just from the description, and I wish you a lot of continuing fun and good learning. And we should finish writing things, and why exactly am I summarizing what I just said...?<br><br>Er. Anyhow. Welcome back :) It&#39;s good to see you on the Board as opposed to in passing on Tumblr. /hands Swiss Bleepolate and Gummyblee Video Cameras/<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>It&#39;s great to see you here as well, I do notice you in passing on Tumblr too (and can&#39;t remember if I ever sent you PMs about the hilarious &#39;imagine yourself&#39; blogs which are... all walking recipes for Suedom...)<br><br>And yes, I guess someone doesn&#39;t know that the Black Arrow is supposed to be black as opposed to the colour of mithril. Or diamonds. <br><br>You&#39;re right, the cowrites are like, what, three years late? But it is kinda currently too hectic for me to even bother poking at the documents, and who knows if the Circle fics still exist (the Sue Lord one got taken down halfway through which is...Problematical). Still, whenever you&#39;re ready, drop me a line and we can try to catch up. :)<br><br>Prague is simultaneously the most beautiful and the most cheap, which are an excellent combination. 10/10 would recommend, even if my Czech is only good enough to order food. </p>

As Miss Cam always says, easy reading is damn hard writing, and it goes doubly so for missions. :&#39;D<br><br>Thanks for the chocolate!</p>

            <p>My flight gets in so late on Friday that it&#39;d be practically Saturday, and I&#39;ll be staying at an Airbnb near Greenwich, but all I really have planned are an event at the British Library Saturday evening at 7pm, and to go check out the Complete Walk on Sunday. Other things I would love to see are pretty much the usual tourist sites, and maybe try to get the Sunday evening show of Hamlet at the Globe. But I&#39;m definitely down to meet up with you guys, especially if you know good cheap eats in London ;)<br><br>You can definitely email me for my phone number if you want to meet up!

            <p>What do you think of as the usual tourist sites? Since you&#39;re in Greenwich, I assume you&#39;ll be visiting the Meridian (and presumably also the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11800441/Greenwich-Meridian-line-is-actually-334-ft-east...near-a-rubbish-bin.html">Prime Meridian Bin</a>); we&#39;ve not actually done that, so that would be cool.<br><br>Other than that... what&#39;re you interested in seeing?

            <p>The Complete Walk looks <i>supremely awesome</i>. Can-<br><br>Okay, I was about to say &#39;Can we join you on that?&#39;, but I&#39;ve just realised that 37 10-minute films comes to 6 hours of footage. Are you planning to watch everything, or just browse?<br><br>Anyway, the walk will take you past the Globe, and ends at Tower Bridge and the Tower of London. It also starts right opposite Westminster Palace and <s>Big Ben</s> <s>Westminster Tower</s> Elizabeth Tower (is apparently its name now), and if you start out in Trafalgar Square, you can walk from there to Buck House to Westminster in... half an hour or so.<br><br>(I have just noticed that, for the Queen&#39;s birthday, the Street View icon around Buckingham Palace is Her Maj. It&#39;s adorable.)<br><br>So yeah, you can actually do all the exteriors as part of the Complete Walk. The British Museum would be a separate thing, though. Unless one wanted to do a morning visit to the museum, then hop on the tube to get to Trafalgar Square...<br><br>No, I&#39;d probably suggest you dedicate one day to the Museum (-s, if you feel like hitting Natural History or Science - or Victoria and Albert, I think they&#39;re free too, covering Art), and the other to... well, walking.<br><br>I think I&#39;m rambling.

            <p>I could see sort of an itinerary forming: I&#39;d get in early, try my best to check in/drop off my luggage at the airbnb, and spend Saturday morning at the British Museum (is the War Museum also free? I heard that one was interesting) and go to the British Library event at night, and then Sunday I&#39;d do the Complete Walk (most likely sitting through just the ones for my favourite plays) alongside getting the exteriors. You and Kaitlyn and all others are free to join me, of course! I&#39;ll also be doing some portions of this itinerary with some fellow Shakespeare nerds from Tumblr (namely the British Library event and the Complete Walk) so that&#39;ll definitely be interesting. <br><br>Oh! I forgot! I also gotta check out Baker Street and the Sherlock Holmes Museum! I can&#39;t write like, a dozen missions for BBC Sherlock and not do that, pssh.

            <p>... there&#39;s a direct train line between Baker Street and Charing Cross (the best station for Trafalgar Square). So you could slot it in before the Exterior Walk; or it&#39;s not too far from the British Museum. And yes, the Imperial War Museum is apparently free entry (which I didn&#39;t know!).<br><br>I think we&#39;d have the easiest time coming across Sunday morning, joining you for part of the Exterior/Complete Walk, then running off halfway down.

            <p>If you can get a time from Teh Nurds, then we can arrange to meet about an hour previously in Trafalgar Square (which is accessed from either Charing Cross or Embankment stations; Embankment is on the Circle Line, so it&#39;s a lot easier to get to, but a slightly longer walk); I suggest the base of Nelson&#39;s Column, on the principle that it&#39;s very hard to miss.<br><br>Though if they say &#39;we rise before the break of day!

            <p>I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re still around these here parts. I&#39;ve wanted to tell you, I made <a href="https://www.cardcastgame.com/browse?search=author:Neshomeh">some supplemental decks</a> to go with your Headquarters Against Humanity. I&#39;d love to get a game going sometime, since I missed out the first time around. If you&#39;re available, so much the better, since it was your idea to start with. {= )<br><br>Also, that fic. I&#39;m afraid to read it too far, but the first chapter alone is pretty funny. Her name is Emerald, sheesh. I guess Hobbit ancestry explains it, but it&#39;s still pretty darn silly on a Dwarf. Even a half-Dwarf. And what a munchkin she is, too. &quot;As she was half hobbit she was able to walk unseen and sneaked into the King&#39;s study.&quot; Riiight. At which point she is not caught and filled with pointy objects because...?<br><br>I&#39;ve got too much on my plate to take this, but someone ought to have an interesting time with it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve read a few of your missions with Eledhwen and Christianne, and gods, they&#39;re flockin&#39; gorgeous! Even though we&#39;ve never spoken to each other before, I bid you a warm welcome back to the PPC Board! *tosses Spikes*<br><br>Please ignore the entire fiasco going on near the bottom of the front page, by the way. I don&#39;t think stuff like that&#39;s a common occurrence around here, and I&#39;m very disappointed with everything that transpired, but I&#39;m in no place to do anything about it AFAIK, so... yeah. Moving on.<br><br>And from what I can tell from the summary, this fic is apparently just the first part of what seems to be a SERIES. UGH. WHY. I&#39;m tempted to send a certain horse and demon duo into this mess myself, but alas, I&#39;ve got lots of other plans for all of my agents, and my canon knowledge of the world of Middle Earth is a bit rusty anyway. Maybe Neshomeh can handle it, though? Maybe you can take it up with those of us who know The Hobbit and related works better than I do, who knows?</p>

            <p>It is now my pleasure to say: <b>Permission Granted!</b><br><br>It&#39;s not perfect—your betas unfortunately missed quite a few technical errors and some general clunkiness, such as the &quot;quest&quot; line somebody else mentioned—but I&#39;m sure that will all improve with time and experience, so I ain&#39;t fussed.<br><br>The characters look fine; my only comment is that I&#39;m not sure you understand the two parts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundere">tsundere</a>. The <i>tsun tsun</i> side is the aloof, angry side; the <i>dere dere</i> side is the sweet, lovey-dovey one.<br><br>I&#39;m very glad to see you&#39;ve reined in the ADHD shenanigans without dropping that aspect of the character, him being a self-insert and all.<br><br>Specific comments on the prompts follow.<br><br><u>Random Prompt</u><br><br>I love this bit:<br><br> He kept moving, dodging and occasionally chopping food out of the air with a stale baguette or shielding himself with a trashcan lid. He found that the deeper he went the more of a selection there was of food. Case in point; an agent who’d stuck a stick into an entire watermelon and was using it as a warhammer.<br><br>“Really?!” Matthew complained, blocking the (very sticky) blow with his trashcan lid. 
<br>I don&#39;t know where Matthew got a trashcan lid, but I don&#39;t particularly care. The mental images are great. <sup>_^</sup> (To point out one of the technical errors, though, that semicolon should be a regular colon. Oh, and a comma would be very welcome here: &quot;the deeper he went, the more of a selection&quot; etc.)<br><br>Does the grape-themed guy with the grape-themed gun use grapeshot ammo? ... I guess he doesn&#39;t. But he <i>should</i>.<br><br>This piece contains lots of descriptions of moves and stuff from franchises I don&#39;t know. I found a bit tiresome, but not exactly bad.<br><br>The narrative style is inconsistent, though, and that made it an odd read. I&#39;d recommend either going with a hardcore story-telling narrator or introducing your exposition more naturally in future pieces. Either way can work. It could be a lot of fun to have a snarky, all-knowing narrator talking directly to the audience, a character in its own right. It&#39;s just weird and intrusive when it only happens sometimes.<br><br><u>Control Prompt</u><br><br>Overall, this piece feels much more polished and has a consistent narrative voice. It&#39;s not as fun, but that&#39;s okay. I do really like the censorship joke. (Did I comment on this before? I feel like I did.)<br><br>And... that&#39;s that. So, good job! Work on the SPaG and whatnot, but otherwise, go forth and spork with goodwill!<br><br>(And I&#39;ll get around to fixing Matthew&#39;s blood type soon. Making any changes requires redoing the whole thing from scratch, is all.)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Understand, first of all, that you should take my advice with a grain of salt, especially if a PG disagrees. That said, this is the PPC, and you guys have this weird habit of letting me be critical of things, so let&#39;s dive in:<br><br>In the random prompt, one of the first lines refers to &quot;said quest.&quot; It&#39;s possible that I simply missed it, but I didn&#39;t see any previous mention of a quest and/or mission. Not a huge problem, but I&#39;m somewhat surprised it slipped past you, since it&#39;s near the very beginning of the story.<br><br>Continuing the discussion of the random prompt in particular, the explanation of the Dragon Shot simultaneously went on longer than I would have expected, and left me more confused than when I went in. You set up the rest of the scene well enough that if you had simply said &quot;He had more pressing matters to attend to, like a grape-themed gunslinger about to unleash a powerful finishing move, the nonlethal Dragon Shot.&quot; it would still have conveyed your message without pulling away from the action to explain what&#39;s going on.<br><br>A more minor point though: the part where Matthew explains to Ajax what a Sengoku Driver is fits alright, as it&#39;s before the fight starts, so taking time to explain doesn&#39;t pull readers out of the action, and having one Agent be confused about a specific part of a continuum is a generally accepted way to tell the reader what that specific part is. However, since Ajax has been in the PPC for a longer period of time, and the rest of Ajax&#39;s actions indicate that he&#39;s well traveled from his time as an assassin, AND you later saying that they&#39;re one of only a few teams that work in the Kamen Rider canon, shouldn&#39;t he already know what a Sengoku Driver is?<br><br>Also, you forgot a comma after the interjection Yes at the beginning of the paragraph where you explain what Matthew and Ajax are doing.<br><br>One last thing about the random prompt: why refer to the Agents that Matthew and Ajax fight as replacements? The Nora replacement especially seems like it would have been easier to just say she was a hammer-wielding Agent, and indicating that every Nora replacement have a corresponding Ren replacement came across as plain weird. And while it makes sense that the easiest way to justify having a Kamen Rider in the fight would be to make them a former replacement/Sue/background character/whatever, I don&#39;t see why you tell us what particular character our grape-blasting-friend was based on after he&#39;s already been defeated. If you really wanted to communicate this fact, it probably would have been simpler to either include it as banter between him and Ajax, or have Ajax deduce the fact in a similar manner to how Matthew decided his opponent was a Nora clone. This last one would also serve to further indicate how much knowledge Ajax&#39;s experience with the PPC has granted him.<br><br>One problem I have with the control prompt is how often you abbreviate things. I understand not wanting to write out Puzzle &amp; Dragons every time you mention it, but spelling it out once or twice before switching to an acronym would be helpful. Similarly, it seems odd that Matthew&#39;s internal thoughts/the narrator would abbreviate Ironic Overpower. The fact that Ajax says it normally later on, and that these are the only two instances of it being mentioned, further convinced me that it would be more clear if you simply called it the Ironic Overpower. I&#39;m more okay with using PJO, since it&#39;s Ajax and Matthew talking to each other, so if they understand the acronym, it makes sense they would use it.<br><br>Speaking of the Ironic Overpower, you seem to imply that it doesn&#39;t apply in DI. I know it&#39;s the Department of Improbabilities and all, but this seems just a bit too improbable. Actually, after going through a bit while looking at this point, your description of DI leads me to believe you have it confused with one of the Internal Departments. If that isn&#39;t the case, I actually have further questions about why you believe DI (the Department of Improbabilities) has offices, and would have only had Matthew reading about Sues, and not actually going into fics.<br><br>Another thing from the same general part of the story that strikes me as odd is how you use &quot;speaking of which&quot; to segue into the console going off, but then it takes two lines of dialogue and a whole paragraph between them to actually get to the console making its usual ruckus. Using the segue usually indicates an immediate action based on the segue, so this delayed reaction just feels off.<br><br>In the last line of the control prompt, by the way, you forgot an apostrophe in &quot;partners.&quot;<br><br>The only real critique I can think of for the bios themselves is the format. I think it would have served you much better to avoid the columned approach you used, and to have instead put headings into the text to indicate a change in overarching topic. That, and you misspelled four as for in the explanation of Ajax&#39;s powers.<br><br>Overall, I noticed that you have a plethora of one or two sentence paragraphs. Sometimes, this is not only acceptable, but puts a helpful emphasis on what&#39;s happening, such as during the food fight where, &quot;The rider charged without hesitation.&quot; The brevity of this description is a nice parallel to how instinctively and quickly the rider fights, and highlights the action well. Other times though, the sentence doesn&#39;t denote an action of enough gravity to warrant its own line. An example where you probably could have combined the sentence with the previous paragraph with ease would be where you describe Matthew&#39;s keeping pace with Ajax. Yes, it&#39;s a rather long sentence, but it ties in with the event of the last paragraph, and isn&#39;t a heart-pounding action line, so it doesn&#39;t really need to be isolated. These super short paragraphs often indicate to the reader that you&#39;re padding to make the story look longer, which I honestly don&#39;t think is what you were going for here, so I don&#39;t want you to give off the wrong impression.<br><br>One other thing that affects your writing overall that might be seen as an issue is the tone. I, for one, think that your narration style is fun, and its lighthearted nature shows that you do enjoy what you&#39;re writing. However, while I like it in general, it is generally discouraged to use the narration as the delivery for your jokes too often, and the more comical style you use might make people especially apprehensive about this. As such, I recommend scaling back a bit, and writing in a slightly more objective fashion. A lot of your parenthetical asides, while amusing, could probably be cut out without affecting the tone or events of the story, and would reduce what some readers might see as forced humor. In addition, there are a few cases where you address the audience directly, which you should either avoid entirely, or use significantly more. Using the narration as a character can be a useful tool for comedy, and that seems to be your primary goal, so I won&#39;t say it has no place here, but you should bear in mind that this is not the style that PPC usually uses, which would make potential future crossover missions more difficult, and that this style is much harder to find a good balance for than simply ditching the idea entirely.<br><br>My final critique (I promise, I do go over some of the things I liked after this) is something I touched on earlier in specific examples, but I think applies to your writing as a whole: you explain a lot of things, but leave some other things unexplained. I, for one, am not familiar with Kamen Rider or Puzzles &amp; Dragons. Walking into these two stories, I knew very little about either canon. Despite this, I think you explained things far too often, especially in your random prompt. The format for the prompt samples didn&#39;t help with this, as you&#39;re supposed to have a reasonably brief story, but especially in the middle of a fight scene, it pulls the reader out of the story when you take time to explain what something is or does. Yes, there are cases where you&#39;ll have to explain how something works, and sometimes you won&#39;t have the ability to deliver that explanation naturally through dialogue, a character&#39;s inner thoughts, or some other in-story method, and you&#39;ll have to tell the reader in the narration. You should only do this sparingly though. Look at the part of your story where Ajax activates his Talaria. I have no idea what a Talaria is. I assume from the context that it is some kind of magic that either makes Ajax faster so he can track down the rider, or stronger so he can actually fight the rider once he finds the poor sod. Immediately after typing that sentence, I googled what it means (winged sandals, for anyone who made it this far without looking it up themselves), and I was pretty much right. What I&#39;m trying to say is: you&#39;ve done a good job of establishing what&#39;s going on, so when you come to a part that you suspect a reader might not immediately understand, you should ask someone who you&#39;re reasonably sure is unfamiliar with the concept (probably a beta reader, possibly just a friend or family member) if they can guess from the context. If they can&#39;t you should consider explaining the idea, but you should usually ask first and explain later.<br><br>Now, to prove I&#39;m not a totally cynical jerk, here are some things I like about your stories and bios:<br><br>A positive I found in the random prompt, was that I like the idea of just footnoting visual references. While I would normally suggest just describing the item, the images you used indicate that it would take more text to describe than would really be worth the effort, so in order to still convey your vision of the scene in a succinct manner, I think you made a good decision.<br><br>One thing that I see that I think is very important is that Matthew has a personality. Based on him being a human from World One named Matt and you being a human from World One named Mattman, I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s basically you. A mark of a lousy character writer is where the author&#39;s avatar in the story is just an every-man, and isn&#39;t particularly interesting. There&#39;s a fine line between being a drama hog and being bland, and I think you succeeded in finding it. I do want to ask though, while your bio says that Matthew sometimes &quot;might sound like an asshole,&quot; I didn&#39;t get that impression of him from the writing samples, except for maybe the part where Matthew leaves a note for a hypothetical genderbent Ren to take better care of her husband. Was this due to the prompts you used simply being a bad fit for showing this character trait, or does the bio overstate his rudeness?<br><br>Speaking of less than outgoing Agents, let&#39;s talk about Ajax. First of all, his powers are understandably complicated, but your comparing them to the more generally understood Pokemon types was a good idea, and I think it let you communicate your idea clearly. Further, while I can see his hydrokinesis and umbrakinesis being very powerful, most of his actual powers seem to be focused more on status effects or helping his team, so he strikes me as a support mage character, which assuages some of my concerns. But Ajax isn&#39;t only his powers, which is a point in your favor all on its own. His personality does not immediately remind me of darkness, water, or Hermes, and while it wouldn&#39;t be disastrous if he did, it would pigeonhole the character into being the darkness/Hermes guy instead of just being Ajax. And who Ajax actually is seems to be consistent, relatable, and fit with his history. Basically, you knocked it out of the park. He strikes the right chord of being experienced and jaded, but not emotionless, and being stoic and cynical without being spiteful and unlikable. Long story short, good job on Ajax.<br><br>On the note of your Agents, they get along well, but not like best friends, which I can see leading to some good stories. I imagine it will take a while for Ajax to fully warm up to Matthew, but I just described Ajax as stoic int he last paragraph, so that was probably going to happen anyway. Plus, exploring how Ajax copes with having a loose cannon (compared to himself and Levy, at least) as a partner in the wake of almost losing his last partner/best friend/leader/potential love-interest will be useful to grow him further from his, as you put it, &quot;rudimentary personality.&quot;<br><br>In fact, and this isn&#39;t really positive or negative feedback, just advice, the one potential issue I see with these two interacting is that Ajax clearly has more going on. That&#39;s not to say that you should make Matthew more complicated, just that you should keep in mind that, while you clearly have plans for how Ajax will grow as a character, you should ensure that Matthew has his time in the spotlight as well. You seem to have done a good job of that so far, with the random prompt clearly favoring Ajax (though, that should only be expected when your options are to follow the gamer/student or a god/sorcerer in a fight) and the control prompt letting you show things more from Matthew&#39;s perspective.<br><br>All in all, you definitely have a few kinks to iron out, but they&#39;re not to major, possibly excepting the tone and explanations, so I can only hope I&#39;ll be seeing Ajax and Matthew in a full mission soon. Good luck.</p>

            <p>On the point of the Sengoku Driver and the Kamen Rider verse: The Kamen Rider verse is a lot like the Super Sentai, and by extension the Power Rangers-verse (in fact Kamen Rider and Super Sentai share a &#39;verse), each season cycles in a new cast, theme, and costumes. So while Ajax has operated within the &#39;Verse before, it was mostly in fics where it&#39;s the Mary Sue is an orginal creation, as per usual in the &#39;verse.<br><br>On the Nora replacement: I was already blatantly homaging the RWBY Volume 2 premiere episode, so I had to include a character from that somewhere. Also Ren because Nora doesn&#39;t do anything without him for the most part. Also the note was a tongue in cheek joke on how they really should be together, but not.<br><br>On Levy: Yes</p>

            <p>I skipped the random prompt, since I don&#39;t really like reading fight scenes, but I read the control prompt, which seems competent with frequent flashes of good, and thoroughly in the spirit of the PPC. My thoughts as I read:<br><br>-I like your description of Matthew being bored. An impatient agent is going to be funny to read about. Saying &quot;How did he know this?&quot; seems a bit superfluous to me, though; most people can tell when they&#39;re bored.<br>-This might just be me, but I think it&#39;s better not to use tautological descriptions unless you&#39;re trying to suggest that the thing being described is confusing or that the character doing the describing is inarticulate, because, well, they&#39;re not very descriptive. I&#39;ve read about RCs of many different sizes, none of which I would compare to any of the high school classrooms I&#39;ve been in. This didn&#39;t actually get in the way of my imagining their RC, but it was slightly irritating.<br>-Some of your sentence structure is a bit odd, but the more I look at it, the more it seems like a character quirk of Matthew&#39;s or just an eccentricity of the story. Either way, it doesn&#39;t impede reading and is rather nice, actually.<br>-Are you censoring your characters or not? Decide; having both threw me for a moment. Creative curses seem to be PPC standard, but I guess it&#39;s up to you.<br>-Matthew&#39;s only seen the movie?! Or is the fic movieverse? Either way, this is going to be hilarious. (I&#39;ve been warned away from the movie, so I haven&#39;t seen it, but if it includes a scene with Aphrodite&#39;s daughters in a hot tub with a bunch of satyrs, and this is the scene that establishes that there are many demigod siblings. . . I suspect that&#39;s all I need to know).<br><br>Overall, I feel like Matthew&#39;s character came through very strongly here, and he seems like someone who it will be fun to read about. Ajax is not as sharply drawn, but he seemed to show up more in the parts of the random prompt I read/skimmed. I hope you get to make this spinoff.<br><br>--Key, who doesn&#39;t even have Permission</p>

            <p>Have a large swishy skit made out of fruit roll-ups! My guess is that you are in your late teens: younger kids are often too foolish to protect their personal information in any way, shape, or form; and when adults protect their personal information, they often don&#39;t worry as much about age, since pedophiles aren&#39;t going after them any more.<br><br>--Key is not Ivy and never will be<br><br>P.S. Hey, you know how parents tell you that the nice person about your age could easily turn out to be a pedophile? Does anyone tell the pedophiles that? Has their been a documented case of undercover pedophiles accidentally seducing each other? I&#39;m sure this has happened, but I can&#39;t figure out the right keywords to search. Each sending each other fake pictures stolen from other people&#39;s profiles. . . I wonder what happened when they found out. Did they feel victimized?</p>

            <p>Those couple of turns where you tried to TWave/Whirlwind Mega Sableye — were you predicting a switch?<br>Also, about Hawlucha: it&#39;s a good idea to put 4 EVs in HP so it can get Unburden from two Subs (assuming you&#39;re running Sitrus Berry + Substitute and not, say, Normal Gem + Quick Attack or Power Herb + Sky Attack).</p>

            <p>My default course of action is to try and inflict a status on the &#39;mon in play, heal off any damage they inflict, and then smash &#39;em to kingdom come. Unfortunately, that kinda makes me a one-trick Ponyta in terms of strategy, and the muscle memory thing doesn&#39;t help at all. This isn&#39;t the first time Magic Bounce turned this strategy against me, you know. XD<br><br>I&#39;ll keep your advice in mind should I use Hawlucha in next year&#39;s tourney ;) In retrospect, I should&#39;ve taken a cue from you and put Drain Punch on Moctezuma for both damage and healing, but that probably wouldn&#39;t have mattered in this case because Ghost is immune to Fighting anyway.</p>

            <p>Is to run a set like this:<br>Hawlucha @ Sitrus Berry<br>Ability: Unburden<br>EVs: 12 HP / 244 Atk / 252 Spe<br>Jolly Nature<br>- Substitute<br>- Swords Dance<br>- Drain Punch<br>- Acrobatics<br><br>The 12 HP EVs, as mentioned, are there to make Hawlucha&#39;s HP divisible by 4 so you could get proc Unburden and get a boosted Acrobatics with two Substitutes. If your opponent breaks your sub in one hit, you sub twice then use Acrobatics or Drain Punch. If your opponent doesn&#39;t break your sub in one hit, you Swords Dance as much as possible without taking a hit — Hawlucha hits like a truck after one SD boost and basically outspeeds everything that doesn&#39;t carry priority. The other thing to watch out for, of course, are &#39;mons that carry sound moves like Hyper Voice and &#39;mons with Infiltrator. Hawlucha also doesn&#39;t like statusers with priority (anything with Prankster, basically).</p>

            <p>I&#39;d recommend against posting the links to your beta material publicly. Beta reading is meant to be pre-access and behind closed doors, so that you can improve your content prior to public release. I&#39;d also advise to ask your betas if your material is ready prior to requesting Permission; that&#39;s something you didn&#39;t do last time and we all know what happened then. <sup><sup>;<br><br>That</sup></sup> being said, I&#39;m very sorry for not being able to beta at all until now, due to my job and other commitments taking up most of my time. I&#39;ll make it up to you as soon as I can, though given my schedule I can&#39;t guarantee I&#39;ll be able to do as much as other betas can. And anyway, I&#39;d suggest getting multiple betas to help you out, as at least two or three would be better to catch stuff one alone could miss.</p>

            <p>There is no rule that I&#39;m aware of against writing missions in present tense. However, it&#39;s pretty uncommon in general, and (like Des said) is usually only used as a gag or a brief obstacle when it turns up in badfics.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Is if you wrote the mission in first person. I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;d write an Agent PAIR in first person without using the same perspective flipping that we use a charge, but it could be neat if done correctly. It would just be really hard to do correctly, and also pretty much wreck any ability to do a crossover mission, since your style of writing missions wouldn&#39;t mesh with anyone else in the PPC.</p>

            <p>However, you can use &quot;being in present tense for a while&quot; as a gag. Just... not the whole mission, it makes it a pain to read. Same goes for script, centre alignment, italics, second person, etc etc.</p>

            <p>Is that everybody fits into all of them a little bit. I&#39;m super Vorthos and we don&#39;t talk about mtg very often, so I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to indulge me for a moment, because I really want to break this all down.<br><br>Azorius: A bureaucracy headed by otherworldly geniuses that establish the rules for the rest of Ravnica/the PPC in order to ensure peace and justice, but just as frequently cause agitation and a shortage of supply. So, basically the Flowers.<br><br>Boros: The PPC and the Boros are both zealous crusaders against villainy and chaos. We stop at nothing to exterminate threats to our society.<br><br>Dimir: I kind of explained this one already, but just so it&#39;s all collected in one place, I&#39;ll say it again. We&#39;re shadowy organizations that deny even existing so that we can assassinate people we really dislike while we accrue large amounts of knowledge.<br><br>Gruul: The Gruul see themselves as the last remaining warriors who can truly champion the cause of the natural world. Or at least, they used to. Honestly, the Gruul are more of a grim reflection of the PPC than a straight parallel: an example of what happens when we take our duties so far that we forget why we started in the first place.<br><br>Golgari: Our work isn&#39;t pretty. Our work isn&#39;t clean. Our work isn&#39;t even moral. But you know what? It has to be done. Everyone else relies on us to make things work normally, so while they may look at us as vile or wicked, they also know that we have to be that way.<br><br>Izzet: Question 1, does this thing explode? Question 2, if previous answer was yes, how quickly can I have this thing? Thanks DoSAT/Izzet, you&#39;re great.<br><br>Orzhov: We are an unparalleled force of glory and greatness. Our leaders are so strong that they have existed since the dawn of our organization. Ignore the savagery, ignore the power plays, and ignore the deception. Because let&#39;s be honest, we aren&#39;t the most morally grand group in the world, but we think we are, and it&#39;s the thought that counts, right?<br><br>Rakdos: Kill the Sues! Kill them all! Aha! Haha! Hahahahaha!<br><br>Selesnya: You know what the problem with the rest of the world is? They&#39;re not us. If they could just understand, if the Suethors could just see what we see, there wouldn&#39;t be any problems. And don&#39;t listen to the critics. We know our knowledge is pure, the will of the gods and/or authors themselves.<br><br>Simic: So, I know everyone says that tenth walker fics and stories by young teens and all that are a bad idea, but we could make it work. Trust us, we&#39;re professionals or something, we know what we&#39;re doing. And if not, we can just mission our own fics. Surely, making one creation just to get rid of a previous creation is still a good thing.<br><br>I think that&#39;s all of them. This went on for kind of a long time, but hopefully you get the idea. And if not, TLDR: Ravnica&#39;s guilds are super cool and the Magic writers made these groups all relateable on some level.</p>

            <p>Hey guys, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen <a href="https://storium.com/">this thing</a> pop up, but a couple of us had a run-in with the game designers two years ago(?), and it&#39;s a lot of fun. It looks like they&#39;ve progressed a lot since the start, and I&#39;m really psyched to try it. Does anyone want to jump into a test campaign?</p>

            <p>For the past four years or so, I&#39;ve been working on a novel series on and off.  It has mostly been off for the past past four years, but that&#39;s neither here nor there.  I had set it aside for a few months recently and I find myself at a bit of an impasse.  I have effectively hit a wall with essentially the most important character in the series.<br><br>Basically I am looking for input on a character&#39;s species.  So the basic set up is this:<br><br>There has been a supernatural war raging since the days of Cain and Able (or Pandora&#39;s Box if you prefer).  In this world there are the supernatural mainstays:  Vampires, Werewolves, Angels, and Zombies.  As well as other creatures as they may arise (I have yet to determine how long the series will go, and thus am uncertain as to what other things will make an appearance).  <br><br>Some basic facts about the races listed thus far are going to be needed.  Zombies are basically Left 4 Dead style common infected.  Faster than Romero Style, but otherwise the classic zombie.  There are also likely to be Voodoo Zombies which will be well Voodoo Zombies.  <br><br>Vampires are modeled after Stoker&#39;s Dracula, White Wolf&#39;s Vampire the Masquerade, and the Hellsing Manga.  In other words these are apex predators and highly dangerous. They do not sparkle in the sunlight.  The most ancient ones are basically completely unaffected, the youngest one will burst into flame.  The more ancient they are the more powerful they are.  <br><br>Werewolves are more in line with more modern interpretations.  They have some degree over the transformation, the older and more powerful the more control (I think you might be starting to see a trend, the older a creature is the more powerful it is).  Transformation is the Wolf-Man style (such as in the film Van Helsing)  These are not the overgrown dogs sometimes seen.<br><br>For Angels, think St. Michael the Archangel.  Or any of Magic the Gathering&#39;s Angels.  Essentially Winged-Humans that serve, let&#39;s call it order (for now).  Generally their purpose is to protect humans from the other creatures.  But they can fall from their purpose (and at least one will).<br><br>Zombies are only created through the spread of the infection through bites (or the Voodoo process).  The other main races are immune to becoming Zombies. Humans do not get any such luck.  <br><br>Vampires can either be born or sired.  They can be born to two Vampire Parents only.  Vampires can be sired by draining a human and then giving it some of the Sire&#39;s Blood.  Sired Vampires have less respect, but are otherwise capable of the same things purebloods are.  Humans and Vampires can interbreed creating the fairly standard Dhampire (think Blade from Marvel Comics).  Vampires cannot breed with Werewolves or Angels.<br><br>Werewolves are only created through the spread of the Werewolf curse through bites, but only during the full moon.  Any Werewolf-Human offspring will be a regular human.  A Werewolf-Werewolf offspring will also carry the curse.<br><br>Angels are only born.  They cannot be created in anyway (except for any divine power that may or may not appear).    A Male Angel-Female Human will produce a child with sensitivity to the supernatural, an immunity to the other races (i.e., cannot be transformed into one of the others.)  A Female Angel-Male Human will produce an Angel with a weaker overall cap, they will never be quite as strong or fast as a pureblood, but are still winged-humanoids, etc.<br><br><b>So the bottom line</b>:  The wall I&#39;ve hit is determining what race I want to make what will eventually be the protagonist of the series, but may not ever be the PoV character, he certainly will not be for the first book.  So basically I am asking for input on what the community things.  I am currently thinking a pureblooded Angel, but am not certain.  The only requirements I have for this character are:  Not a Zombie and Not a pureblooded Human.  A pureblood human would be internally inconsistent with the story and I just do not want my main character to be a Zombie for reasons.<br><br>Also depending if people are interested I could turn this into a RPG here on the board.  While I have not put a lot of the story to paper, I have the universe pretty well created and fairly consistent at this point. </p>

            <p>As to the ghost, I had not planned on using them at all.  It comes to my own personal feelings on the supernatural, which is why I will likely not use demons either.  But the first book is actually designed to be a mystery were a regular human starts piecing things together on their own, but will find themselves in way over their head.  <br><br>As for zombification, the infection starts to spread as soon as an individual is bitten.  As part of how my version of the zombie virus will work it will kill off all but the most basic instincts in the brain.  Basically just the need to feed.  But it will not actually require death.  Largely because I want to leave it open for the possibility of a cure.  Basically my ultimate plan with the Zombies is to completely shatter the masquerade.  The introduction of the zombies will basically start the final act.</p>

            <p>The protagonist will have a role in the first book, but is more of a supporting character.  But it will ultimately be his story from there on out.  But I am prone to experimentation, so he may switch between &quot;active hero&quot; or &quot;passive support&quot; throughout the entire series depending how it goes.  </p>

            <p>Interesting, but I&#39;m not entirely sure what to say.

            <p>Part of that stems from not having an outline.  I do not like using them for writing, it takes away flexibility in my mind.<br><br>Let me sketch the basic plot out.  This is a series of undetermined length as of now.  One can imagine this as three phases or acts.<br><br>Act I serves as an introduction of the series.  Effectively a character serves as an audience surrogate and discovers that there is a whole supernatural realm that has always existed alongside the world we know.  Basically as a result of the Spanish Inquisition and Counter-Reformation a set of rules were put in place to keep humans and supernaturals safe from each other for the most part.  This lead to a cold war between warring sides, and the supernatural began to fade into myth and legend.  This brings us to the modern day.  Where a veteran homicide detective gets a haunting case that seems to defy logic.  She then stumbles upon an ancient conspiracy and then things happen.<br><br>Act II.  The masquerade starts to break down.  Regular people are getting suspicious not everything is what it appears.  Our true villain is introduced.  The Cold War between supernaturals heats up.  All out war between supernaturals and humans is imminent.<br><br>Act III.  All out war.  I have yet to decide how this will end.</p>

            <p>More specifically, what&#39;s will your protagonist&#39;s story be about? What going to happen to him? What&#39;s his role in the story when he does start to become important? Is there one of the three potential species that makes good sense? Or, on the other hand, is there one of them that will make it difficult? (Conflict, yay! Obstacles, yay!)<br><br>Another angle to consider is, what are the relationships between the different species? What is your character&#39;s relationship to the other characters? Should it mirror the interspecies relationship or be different? Like, if werewolves and vampires hate each other, and one of the other characters is a vampire and you character is her friend, it would make sense for him to not be a werewolf, but it could make for great conflict (Yay!) with everyone else, who don&#39;t like them hanging out.</p>

            <p>Ultimately the set up is that there is a masquerade that keeps the average person from realizing that there has been a war between supernatural forces that has been going on since the dawn of time.  Essentially Order vs. Chaos.  Not Good vs. Evil, because that&#39;s cliched.  The lead up to the story set approximately now is that each group has their own things.  The WWs want to be left alone, Vampires want to control everything and ensure their food source is well kept for.  Angels are there to protect humans from everybody else.  <br><br>Then along the course of the first book (I do not like planning out much further, because I like flexibility) only partially follows the protagonist, it is there to basically allow the readers to ask the questions.  The main character in book one is basically a detective who stumbles across this ancient war and gets caught in the middle.  The protagonist regardless of race wants to keep humans safe for one reason or another.  If a Vampire keep the food source safe, Werewolf, would take more work but largely thinks if humans are safe less likely to hunt for his kind.  Angel, it&#39;s his duty. <br><br>Any of the races will work.  They all have reasons for wanting to keep humans safe and keep the status quo between sides.  So naturally the masquerade will start to break down chaos will be unleashed and the protagonist and his organization will seek to maintain order.  <br><br>Another way, is this a Vampire protagonist will have Blue and Orange Morality.  A Werewolf will largely be a true neutral (just keeping me and mine safe) Order/Chaos or Good/Evil do not have any meaning for him.  And an Angel will essentially be Lawful/Good.<br><br>Part of the entire premise of the story is breaking down the barriers on the sides.  Ultimately a big bad is going to come along and threaten the entire world.  And the disparate groups will need to come together to stop it.<br><br>As for relations, a rough timeline can be sketched out.  From the beginning of the conflict Werewolves and Vampires have been at war.  Kind of the standard Fangs vs. Fur that originated from a misunderstanding and the fact that the Vampires looked at the wolves as nothing more than animals that threatened their livestock.  Angels were always present in small numbers (roughly 20 worldwide kind of thing) to try to keep humans safe.  Up until the Spanish Inquisition there was a very broken masquerade, then during that time period it came to a head, and the Inquisition&#39;s real purpose was to cut down the numbers of the supernaturals (a Knight-Templar Angel was leading it).  The Angels fractured and seemingly disappeared while the Werewolves/Vampires essentially agreed to truce and a cold war has been going on ever since.  Skip to the modern era and someone is playing the sides off against each other to start a war between all the races that will likely wipe out humanity.<br><br>As a result of this, the time the book starts at an organization has been formed by representatives of all three groups to try to keep order.  Naturally millennia old grudges do not go away so easily so there are external and internal existential threats to the organization.  Basically any of the three could work, which is why I am asking.       </p>

            <p>But I can&#39;t be the only one who&#39;s terrified of the upcoming live-action Ghost in the Shell movie, can I?<br>It&#39;s a Japanese story set in Japan about Japanese characters, so they made one of the least Japanese women I&#39;ve seen in my life play the lead (Japanese) character. <br>They&#39;ve whitewashed the name, too. Just Major - no Mokoto, or anything foreign or scary like that. <br><br>I&#39;m curious to see what else they&#39;ll whitewash. <br>P&#39;raps they&#39;ll whitewash the setting, so it&#39;s in the proper, good old USA. <br>Maybe they&#39;ll whitewash all the robots, so that they&#39;re just very large white men with very stoic faces. <br>Perhaps they&#39;ll whitewash all the themes of transhumanism and existence, and make them something more comfy and western, like, I don&#39;t know, the incredible honour and power of the American military. <br><br>Shouldn&#39;t judge though, right? </p>

            <p>Full disclosure, I haven&#39;t seen the original Ghost in the Shell or any trailers for the new one. (I have seen that picture of ScarJo with a black wig that looks straight out of &quot;Lucy&quot;, though.) I&#39;m saying I&#39;m suspicious because whitewashing a film has a track record of ending badly for a film&#39;s publicity, box office, crew, and creators.

            <p>The way the omniscient and omnipresent Madokami (canon by her own admission, episode 12) was pretty much taken by surprise and &quot;split&quot; by Homura into Madoka and Law of Circles (Homura who had pretty much no reason to have the power to do that), is a plothole big enough to fit the Death Star in.<br><br>That&#39;s aside the fact that there was no need to take Homura, who we know hss got a psyche that can be defined as &quot;in pieces held together by paper tape&quot;, and put her into a freaking grinder.

            <p>Dear Iximaz, <br>I haven&#39;t been around long, I know, and I hope that you&#39;ll read this. If not - that&#39;s alright too. I want this to be out there in case you ever do come back. First off, I respect your choice. I&#39;ve been in a similar position before, and I understand how it feels. I hate to see you go, Iximaz, but if you truly feel that&#39;s the right decision, I will not stop you. Instead, if you&#39;re still lurking, I hope that you&#39;ll read this. Sure, it&#39;s probably not the most interesting, but I want to let you know how much you&#39;ve influenced the PPC, and on a more personal level, me. <br>I stumbled across the Protectors of the Plot Continuum in December, after a falling-out with a roleplay forum. That&#39;s a long story that I don&#39;t want to get into, but it does have a happy ending. I&#39;d been searching for a Mary-Sue test directed towards the Sherlock continuum; Alexis Gilmore popped up as one of the results. Curious, I read the mission &quot;Get That Thing Called Beauty Out of the Detective&#39;s Eyes.&quot; <br>I loved it. After tearing through many of the works of Lily Winterwood, I explored the Wikia, as one does. Soon, I stumbled across the Aviator. <br>I was entranced. Rina and Randa were hilarious, the stories were well written, and the pair of them worked so well together. I read every mission, including the ones whose fandoms I didn&#39;t know. (They were a bit confusing, but it was still amusing to watch your protagonists try to keep themselves sane). I giggled; I cringed; I stared at the wall and said, &quot;You&#39;ve <i>got</i> to be kidding me.&quot; The fics were that bad, and your missions were <i>that</i> good. <br>Zeb was easy to adjust to - yes, I missed Randa, but who wouldn&#39;t love the adorable, innocent little Pokйmon? Zeb is so sweet, and I enjoy his interactions with Rina. Zeb is innocent, childlike, and it was a fresh contrast to the Rina-Randa dynamic. <br>Oh, Iximaz. I will be very blunt when I say this: <b>You are the reason I joined the PPC.</b> I was overjoyed when I met you, and loved the Time Lord cosplay you posted. It was an honour to deduce your photos, and I was amazed that someone like you - an oldbie and a Permission Giver to boot! - would even bother looking at anything I&#39;d done. You&#39;ve inspired me greatly, and I want to take this time to say <b>thank you.</b> <br>Thank you so much, Iximaz, for everything you&#39;ve done for this place. Thank you for cracking me up on a bad day. Thank you for tackling some of the worst fics ever. Thank you for making me squeal with delight at the subplots within the Aviator and Zeb&#39;s timelines. <br>This will be the only time I&#39;ll say it - please come back. You will be very sorely missed. If you don&#39;t, please know how much I admire you, and will continue to admire you. You don&#39;t give yourself enough credit. <br>That is all. Go wherever it is that you need to go; make your own adventure. I know you will, and I know it will be fantastic. <br>Yours sincerely, <br><i>Ivy Matilda Blue</i></p>

            <p>There is History here. What it really boils down to, though, is July is a bully and excellent at gaslighting and playing the victim. I figured she&#39;d maybe calmed down a bit since most of her old targets left and she didn&#39;t actively engage me anymore, but I figure if she&#39;s gonna start up with old behaviors, why shouldn&#39;t I?

            <p>That&#39;s an interesting read, though long settled of course.

            <p>We have a core base of oldbies who are so firmly set in the status quo that they refuse to consider alternatives, and a community that has grown up around that core to the point that any attempt to point out flaws is seen as inherently bad. Every time something has changed it has taken massive amounts of effort and/or huge amounts of drama. Not only that, but the reputation of these members is seen by a significant portion of the community as unassailable, to the point that calling them out when they do something wrong, or arguing with them, is akin to blasphemy. And it&#39;s not just recent. Other people have seen and commented on this before me.<br><br>When we encounter a community issue, people are reluctant to put their foot down, or even tell the person off beyond &quot;go read the constitution&quot;, which, by the way, is actually the opposite of what the constitution says to do in article 7. On the IRC we handled things differently. We had mods, and then we had Designated Arbitrators, and once we had those in place, plus some rules of our own, the place was relatively easy to manage until everyone left. Here on the board the very limits of the technology prevent that, so a different sort of attitude has grown up, one of non-engagement. However I can tell you that if someone is determined, or just doesn&#39;t see the error of their ways, refusing to engage them is not an actual deterrent from them saying whatever they want.<br><br>Not only that but missions that seemed funny once just seem kinda mean now. The whole &quot;going into someone else&#39;s story and killing off their characters, then publishing it for all our buddies to sit and laugh at&quot; thing doesn&#39;t really sit very well with me anymore, and lord knows I&#39;m not the first person to become disenchanted with the mission structure. I think we&#39;ve lost more oldbies that way than anything else. Honestly, my time spent away from the semi-insulation of the PPC and out among the rest of fandom-based internet has led me to see all forms of fanfiction that aren&#39;t obvious trollfics as a treasure, because someone did their best to write this, and had the courage to put it up online where anyone can see and comment on it. Just because I don&#39;t like the story, or even think it&#39;s bad, doesn&#39;t make it worth mocking.<br><br>There&#39;s more, but honestly it&#39;s late and this is all I&#39;ve got at the moment.</p>

            <p><i>&quot;Everyone deserves an honest second chance - which means, initially, a chance to stop, explain, and/or apologise. This means that, if you believe that someone is engaged in any violation of the Constitution, but particularly Articles 1-3, it is critical to make sure they understand what they are doing wrong, so that they can make amends. Explain it to them yourself, or ask a third party to do so - but the key word is explain. Telling someone to shut up because their opinion is unwanted does not constitute a chance.&quot;</i><br><br>Now, I&#39;ve been back for about a week, and I&#39;m mostly ignorant to the events of the past six or so months in this community, I&#39;ll admit as much upfront and go so far as to say maybe it makes me unqualified to participate in this discussion at all. However, I&#39;m not sure I see where this has been contradicted - in most places where somebody invokes the Constitution in response to somebody else&#39;s behaviour, usually I&#39;ve seen them either link the article in question, or outright quote it, as I have. Furthermore, that &quot;explain&quot; is a key word, and it sounds like the issues people are having with your behaviour <i>have</i> been explained, at length - are you telling me you have absolutely no understanding of why people might have a problem with your actions, in light of what I&#39;ve read in the post where hS makes his case for a ban? I&#39;m not sure article 7 supports your case as well as you think it does.<br></p>

            <p>The reason I invoked Article 7 is because there haven&#39;t been any attempts to explain that I&#39;ve seen. There&#39;s been endless repetitions of &quot;you&#39;re breaking the constitution&quot; but nothing explaining why what I was doing constituted an actual violation and not just something people didn&#39;t want to see. In fact, when VM defended me, and said that I was not making any of this up and I wasn&#39;t breaking the constitution, said repetitions mostly stopped. hS has said that I made personal attacks but I genuinely do not see where that is the case. I brought up history, I was sarcastic and brusque, and definitely more than a little snide, but no where did I engage in an ad hominem attack, because I believe that kind of thing is pointless and only makes the person doing so look bad. I did, admittedly, ignore requests to stop from everyone but hS, but my reasoning was that everyone else asking simply didn&#39;t have the proper context for what was going on, and they didn&#39;t understand what I was trying to do. The reason I stopped after hS asked me to is because, despite my various grievances with him, he has been around far longer than anyone else involved, and therefore, unless he&#39;d just managed to forget the events of three or four years ago, he definitely had the right context to understand what was going on. Also he pointed out that I was about to make myself a hypocrite.</p>

            <p>Well, here I might be out of my depth because I&#39;ve missed a lot, so anyone who&#39;s seen more of all this feel free to step in. I did see the discussion from VM that you point out here, and I do agree with some of the spirit of it - there were points where you were very clearly expressing a concern that current actions were matching up with past patterns of misbehaviour. However, it also seems like you doggedly pursued this long after the matter was settled and everyone else considered it dropped, even despite being asked to at least temporarily let it go. There&#39;s also the fact that it&#39;s obvious from the way all this talk has gone on that this has been going on much longer than the past couple days. I&#39;ll have to do some reading or talk to some of the others to get fully caught up, though.<br><br>Of course, with how thoroughly I&#39;m being outvoted, this discussion might unfortunately be moot.</p>

            <p>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA256<br><br>Having thought about things some more, I&#39;m with Delta on this. That is, I&#39;m voting no because I don&#39;t like the circumstances of this vote. However, I call on Data to voluntarily take some time off, think things over, and potentially come back and apologize. I think around 3-6 months vacation might be a good idea.<br><br>Part of my problem is that Data&#39;s post upthread of the call for a ban could be seen as daring the community to go ahead and ban him. Since tensions were rather high with Iximaz leaving and Data&#39;s general conduct, hS took the bait and called the vote. I&#39;m also rather unhappy with the fact that a permaban was proposed in this case (IIRC Jacer was banned for a year? for worse conducs).<br><br>I think it&#39;s also telling that the vote hasn&#39;t been anywhere near a consensus on this ban, like it usually is. This fits with my view that bans (as opposed to a consensus &quot;you should leave for a while&quot;) are either for a long pattern of bad behavior that hasn&#39;t been corrected after explanations or for doing something seriously outragous that Is Not Done Here.<br><br>Another issue is that we had a troll trying to push the ban, which did not make the vote any less contentious.<br><br>I think there&#39;s some debate to be had on whether Data&#39;s reached the &quot;persistent pattern of bad behavior&quot; lever yet. But holding that discussion in the form of a ban vote was not a good move.

            <p>… and suddenly everything is on fire (or the Internet equivalent thereof). Sheesh, I really can&#39;t leave you folks alone.<br><br>There&#39;s no doubt to me that Data Junkie&#39;s posts have been disruptive and mean-spirited. Some of the things said in the April 6 Permission thread set off the first alarm bell in my mind. I didn&#39;t say anything then, nor did I say anything in the following threads, because I thought everyone else had things under control. Adding my voice just seemed like jumping onto the dogpile. Then, when things got more heated, I chose to stay out of it because I didn&#39;t think I could make it any better (not feeding the trolls, I suppose).<br><br>That being said, I&#39;m not sure that a permaban is the solution. I&#39;m not really sure what the solution could be, especially since this troll (which I apparently missed — two days!) has muddied the waters. Juliette&#39;s proposal of waiting for heads to cool before creating a new thread to gauge everyone&#39;s thoughts properly seems like the ideal way to go.<br><br>Otherwise, I suppose I would support a six to twelve-month long ban.</p>

            <p>But surely isn&#39;t the entire point of abstaining to not want your vote counted in any way shape or form in the current poll? And not to have it included under one of the categories anyway.

            <p>I mean, I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m only going off how we run things when we&#39;re picking committee members for our Ultimate Frisbee team at Uni, but the person who is being voted for doesn&#39;t get a vote, and those who abstain are kept as a third category and not include in whether they want someone in a position or not, otherwise are you saying that if we do not know enough about a person to say that they&#39;d be a good health and safety officer we are actually saying we don&#39;t want them as a health and safety officer regardless? It&#39;s probably not the best example, but the point I&#39;m trying to make is that people abstain for a reason, they don&#39;t abstain to then be included in the &#39;no&#39; category, they abstain because they want to stay neutral.  </p>

            <p>The vote is really, at this point, &quot;In Favor&quot; vs everything else.  This is actually a way to balance the scales toward the subject of the potential ban.  The abstaining votes go toward the default.  In this case, &quot;no ban&quot; is the default option, as it should be.<br><br>For instance, there are 100 people in a group:  10 vote in favor of a ban.  2 vote against it.  88 abstain from voting.  Should the ban happen?  There is overwhelming 5-to-1 support, after all.  If abstaining works how you say (which is a legitimate thing in many systems) then the ban happens.  If abstaining is counted how hS has been doing it, then clearly there is not enough support in the group to ban someone.<br><br>It isn&#39;t a bug, it&#39;s a feature.

            <p>As far as I&#39;m aware, &quot;abstain&quot; means &quot;I don&#39;t think my opinion should count&quot;, not &quot;default&quot;.

            <p>As I&#39;ve said on another post (I don&#39;t know how to link stuff, sorry) if we generally work on 60% support being needed to pass the vote, I believe there are no circumstances in which is there a situation where there is enough support for the vote to ban to pass. I&#39;m more annoyed by the fact that, as Des has said, abstaining is now being taken to be agreeing to the default vote, than caring about whether this (or really any) vote passes or fails.</p>

            <p>There are certainly differences between saying<br>&quot;I want everybody to cool down before there even should be a voting&quot;,<br>&quot;I don’t know enough and thus don’t want to be responsible for this person being banned&quot;, and<br>&quot;no, there aren’t enough reasons to ban this person&quot;.  <br><br>But banning somebody is serious business (<i>so</i> not what we want to do here) and shouldn’t be done lighthearted.

PoorCynic’s (and others?) response was rightfully counted as &quot;No (immediate) action taken&quot;, although he clearly stated that, if he had to vote now, it would be a temporary ban. I will not call for another vote just because it’s next week and people supposedly have cooled down, that wouldn’t feel right to me, and also I’m a coward and don’t want to take the hotseat.

            <p>*Sigh* I really don’t need this drama.<br><br>What happened in the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=294071;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">permission rules thread</a> was annoying, because I’ve been there (still a shiny Newbie) when the permission process was changed, and watched the reasons and the effort put into it. But we got a clarification of the rules out of it, so Data Junkie may have achieved something good there. I still believe it could have been done in a less hurtful way.<br><br>When Data told Ix that &quot;<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=294722;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this place is incredibly toxic at its core</a>&quot;, I was tempted to say that I see only one person who doesn’t actively try to make it less toxic. I didn’t, because I’m careful to not post while I’m angry. I spot some posts that imply that Data can be less vitriolic when they try, but I’m afraid that is not enough.<br><br>I actually remember the terrible mess that was made in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O4qQUMsbjlT-3Q_C8IvYjvue5Wm7Cn_geu2JddJd7Nw/edit?disco=AAAAAq0vqBQ#gid=0">Jacer’s permission thread</a>. It must have been one of the first things I saw on the Board, when I, after reading TOS and OFUM, looked around to see what else might be there. No, it didn’t scare me away; reading everything on The Complete List of PPC Fiction just took another year, before I returned to the Board and joined. Actually, I liked how in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O4qQUMsbjlT-3Q_C8IvYjvue5Wm7Cn_geu2JddJd7Nw/edit?disco=AAAAAq0vqCE#gid=0">follow-up</a> that resulted in the First Amendment to the Constitution, everybody tried to make the PPC a better place, and that’s one of the reasons why I did join in the end. (Do I see a pattern here? Is it always necessary to hurt people before we improve? Do I actually agree with Data about this? I certainly don’t agree that it’s impossible to argue with the Ancientbies.)<br><br>Anyway, I did read through most of this mess again in the archives. (Apparently, it’s impossible to fully read an archived post that is too long to fit the height of my notebook’s widescreen.) As could be expected, real life is a bit more complex than a seven line summary, but hS is much closer to the truth than what Data tried to make us believe.<br><br>And then we got this invitation to put our collective foot down.<br><br>I can understand people growing out of laughing about half-sane (at best) “contract killers” murdering beloved (by some) OCs. I can even understand them still wanting to keep the PPC as a place to meet friends and talk about everything (except badfic?) we talk about here. But this doesn’t work.<br><br>Writing missions is not all the PPC is about. But it is our origin and the toxic (to badfic) core of the PPC. Making the PPC a better place that isn’t the PPC anymore will not happen as long as I have a say on it. And attempts to make the PPC a better place by means that are actually counter-productive must be dealt with.<br><br>Still, permanent bans are so permanent. I feel always bad when we have to do this.<br><br>I ask Data Junkie to stay away until they changed their attitude.

            <p>What I can say is this, the IP checker I used traced the second to the Netherlands and found it to be a Tor server, however the first IP address went back to Washington, Seattle and doesn&#39;t appear to be a Tor server from what I can see. <br><br>Now just before I went to bed yesterday (well technically today) I noticed that Toroll was posting between certain times each day, and from the incidents they were mentioning I gathered that it was becuase they were either still in education or only a year or two out of it, whilst in a job that they probably had to work 9-5 in. Looking at the times they posted I gathered they were American and either on Central time, or West coast time, which I wasn&#39;t sure and couldn&#39;t confirm without them posting more until they had to go. In fact I was actually going to ask you hS next time I was online if you, or anyone else still did the polls about 5-6 years ago and had anyone answer they were in the age range of 12-17, and lived in central or western america in the hope to narrow it down.  <br><br>That was as far as I got, but it seems the majority of the situation has been resolved for now, I would however say to keep on the look out, I was looking up stuff about Tor last night and its seems it is notoriusly difficult to fully block people who use its services. <br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>((There will be a separate thread regarding name changes going up in a bit.))<br><br>I think everyone needs to take a moment and put their drama-llamas back in their respective pens. Multiple threads have spiraled wildly out of control, and I honestly can&#39;t tell who is overreacting the most in all of this. (Probably the anonymous troll.)<br><br>I strongly object to calling a drumhead court-martial, mid-Drama, with a permaban on the list of options. Not only is it not something we&#39;ve done before (to my memory, forgive me for not digging through history), it&#39;s a pretty much guaranteed way to get a bad result and set a bad precedent. If we want to revisit this topic (and I think we should), we should stop, wait until tempers have cooled, and then consider what actions are appropriate.<br><br>I do think that Data is in the wrong here - dredging up old drama doesn&#39;t make things better, especially when different people had vastly different interpretations of what was being said and implied at the time. (The one thing that I do remember clearly from some previous drama-fests has been talking with other people afterwards and hearing what they were seeing - I have yet to see a drama-fest where everyone agreed on what was being said, implied, and meant, even with all the posts squarely in front of everyone.)<br><br>But. We have only ever permabanned people for incredibly serious reasons, or aggregiously long patterns of misbehavior. Everyone makes mistakes, everyone gets emotional (VM can testify that there have been times that we could hardly type for pent-up anger), and I absolutely object to making anything resembling a permanent judgement while there&#39;s this much blood in the water.<br><br>I also have concerns with other peoples&#39; behaviors in the last several threads. A lot of people have overreacted and fired off angry, aggressive responses to perceived insults, and along with claims of bad faith flying back and forth, we have a troll openly admitting to acting in it.<br><br>If you must, please consider this a vote against the majority, whichever way it goes - I do not believe that consensus is possible at the moment, or that a show of hands mid-Drama is going to make this community a better place.<br><br>-Delta Juliette<br>(Who is, to borrow a term from Seafarer, a fellow victim of Trainwreck Syndrome.)</p>

            <p>I have a few opinions on the matter, most pressingly that it&#39;s after midnight and I really should keep this brief...<br><br>Most significantly, I don&#39;t think that we&#39;re going to get a consensus out of this vote. If that happens, we&#39;re going to need to have a longer conversation about what is and isn&#39;t acceptable, and how we respond to it - or we&#39;re just going to sweep everything under the rug and try to ignore it again. I&#39;d rather push us towards the first option.<br><br>Secondly, I think that coming to a ban/no-ban decision on the spot pushes towards the under-the-rug option, and I&#39;m not sure how happy I am with that, regardless of the decision that gets made here. I&#39;m not terribly happy with how quickly people have started calling troll, or accusing others of talking in bad faith - while I dislike Data&#39;s behavior, I also dislike things that other people have said and done.<br><br>And thirdly, you&#39;re right, I definitely can&#39;t make that call for other people. My opinion (and vote) goes towards  more discussion, but that&#39;s only a single vote - and a lurker / not-very-involved-in-the-community vote at that.</p>

            <p>The proper time to deal with something like this is as it happens. Yes, we don&#39;t want to sweep something like this under the rug. The thing is, I believe that delaying action actually contributes to the sweeping, because nobody wants to bring something like this up after people have put it behind them.<br><br>Basically, while we agree on basically everything, we&#39;re coming to different conclusions on how to avoid the problems you foresee.

            <p>I know I just said I was abstaining from voting before, but . . . Juliette is right.  There should be no vote right now.  Not only has too much anger been going down lately, but Torollйmon has added too much confusion to the mix.  We all need to slow down and put things off until we&#39;ve all calmed.  A more civilized thread will give the troll fewer opportunities to take advantage of our feelings, as well.<br><br>—doctorlit</p>

            <p>Waiting until we can regroup and figure out this mess of umpteen different responses seems wise, not to mention all the trouble the inflamed tempers--mine among them, even though I didn&#39;t post--and an active troll have caused.

            <p>When last I checked, we acted <i>as a community</i>. We discuss matters <i>as a community</i>, and we most certainly do not &quot;ignor[e] blatant forgery of votes and [go] ahead with [...] ban[s]&quot; simply because we want to be <i>rid</i> of someone. That is not how this community has operated in the past three years--not <i>once</i>, unless I missed something major--and, to my knowledge, it has never acted that way. Whoever you are, you are obviously unaware of how this community currently operates--and, to be clear, I say &#39;currently&#39; only because I haven&#39;t been a Boarder since the very beginning and would prefer that any replies you might make to me fall into what I have personally experienced.<br><br>And, ha. As to the results being &quot;sadly predictable&quot;? Seriously, what in the <i>world</i> did you think was going to happen? Apart from your assumption that hS might just ignore everything, that is? We responded. We condemned the forgery. We were rightfully angry at having someone post under our names. What in the world else would we have done--giggled about it and welcomed the impostor to come join us, oh, haha, well done on the prank? Yeah, no.<br><br>(I also question your reasoning for choosing Data as a target. If you&#39;ve been paying attention, for example, you should know that a, not everyone here is mad at them, and b, they have friends here who are, surprise surprise, not voting to ban them. Also? If hS or anyone else running a ban vote ignored &quot;blatant forgery of votes&quot; and went ahead with it? We would have a BIG problem, and it would definitely not end with the vote. Ignoring for a moment that just about everyone who was impersonated came out and said that they had been impersonated and oh, by the way, here&#39;s my real vote? If the ban had gone ahead under a vote that everyone knew was falsified--well, I&#39;m pretty sure the next discussion/argument would be about that. And with that, I&#39;m back to my point of--you don&#39;t know us. You really, seriously do not know us--or if you do, you most certainly do not appear to understand us or the way we function.)<br><br>And one more thing? /slow claps/ Congratulations. Your last little aside is both petty and ensures the continued slipping away of <i>any</i> potential positive feeling anyone might&#39;ve had towards you. (You might also want to <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/he-or-she-versus-they">check your history</a> before you insult someone based on using &#39;they&#39; as a singular pronoun--according to Oxford Dictionaries, it&#39;s the revival of a practice that&#39;s been around since the 16th century. It just fell out of use somewhere around the turn of the twentieth century, from what I can tell. But really, even without that--I identify as female and present (if I&#39;m using that term correctly?) as female. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been misgendered in my life, except by someone using a language they don&#39;t know very well. And I&#39;m still wincing at your comment attacking someone&#39;s choice of pronoun and identification with that pronoun. Just stop. When even a never misgendered ciswoman is wincing, <i>there is a problem here</i>. So, gee, how about you consider apologizing to Data for calling them <i>speshul</i> because of their <i>gender pronouns</i>, and then get lost?)<br><br>I really, truly hope that whatever problem you have with the PPC community is one that you can move past. Because this is seriously, seriously ridiculous and, in so many ways, petty. Go out and do something useful and positive with your life, why don&#39;t you? I&#39;m <i>positive</i> that there are so many more constructive things you can do with your time than sit around trying to annoy an <i>online community of writers</i>.<br><br>And that&#39;s it. That&#39;s pretty much all I have to say here. I&#39;m going to go do something constructive now myself, and hang out with my friend who wants some company. See ya! (Or not, as the case may hopefully be).<br><br>Good evening, &#39;Toroll&#39;. Feel free to pick up your sanity at the door on your way out--that is, assuming you ever were a Boarder and left it there on your way in to begin with. If not, just bye. /waves/<br><br>Evening to everyone else, too :) Don&#39;t know about you, but I believe we can stay a community and not be &#39;broken apart&#39; by a troll, of all things.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>They&#39;ve already said they&#39;re taking time off; I find a ban redundant. <br><br>Historically, bans are reserved for people who: harass other members using outside mediums, or use demographic information to attack and harass members, or <i>harass members repeatedly, over a series of repeated incidents, showing a behavior pattern</i>.<br><br>I cannot believe we are voting on a permanent ban based on two adjacent threads surrounding one drama issue… which was started by two people who were not Data. They pointed out several things they see as serious, recurring issues in the PPC (I happen to agree with some, but that&#39;s neither here nor there) and also pointed out a behavior pattern they perceive as toxic and harmful. Yes, they were rude about it. But our response is perma-ban? I can&#39;t get behind that. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m in favour of a ban. But really, what&#39;s to stop Data Junkie waiting six months and pulling the exact same stunts again? Because time does not seem to be a problem to them.<br><br>Bans, in this sense, are meant to be a time for reflection and self-analysis, and I&#39;m not at all convinced Data Junkie will use their time away to do that.

This whole thing is entirely down to two people having hated each other several years previously; one has been trying to move on, and one has not. If this happens again, then there have to be more far-reaching consequences.<br><br>Data Junkie&#39;s on record as saying they want more to be done about the toxicity in the PPC, that toxic members are just left to their own devices and this needs to change.

            <p>I remember the Jacer incident, yes. I remember that Tray and a few others attacked Jacer for reasons the rest of us didn&#39;t understand, that several of us oldbies (and non-oldbies) told them off for it. Data may have forgotten that I was one of the people who Tray didn&#39;t speak to and blew up at for that, but I have not. <br><br>I also remember that Tray never apologized to any of us, and held the grudge against hS and you to the point where they did make unbased personal attacks against you both repeatedly and probably should have been banned at that point. (But I don&#39;t think Data was around for that bit, due, IIRC, to family priorities taking time.) I also - as someone else has pointed out - acknowledge that memory is malleable and unreliable, even with logs. <br><br>Look, what it comes down to for me is this. I remember how July acted on the IRC and Board, I remember her repeatedly bullying people and driving people away who she didn&#39;t approve of. I agree with Data that it has been an incredibly toxic behavior, and understand their incredulity that it seemed to be tolerated for so long - even protected by behavior norms (or., &quot;don&#39;t rock the boat&quot;). I, unlike Data, am rather still hoping she&#39;s grown up (as have we all - ye gods would I hate to meet the person I was in 2012), and isn&#39;t continuing it - that this was a one-off problem, not the repeating of a pattern. But I absolutely can&#39;t blame them for jumping to that conclusion, not for getting defensive when everyone either called them a liar, or defended July, or both. <br><br>And I don&#39;t like the precedent this sets. </p>

            <p>I honestly don&#39;t have a solution. I think Data&#39;s right in that there&#39;s a sort of institutional complicity about this whole topic (of toxic behavior, etc). I think they were wrong to pin that on &quot;oldbies,&quot; especially you and hS specifically. Also, I think it&#39;s probably been well and above obvious to most people that I don&#39;t care for the Mission format myself, given I&#39;ve never written a serious one, and haven&#39;t read or commented on one in years. <br><br>But mostly, I&#39;m utterly sick of drama. Looking down thread, I saw July say something rather uncalled for, others react and/or overreact, and then Data, in a fairly rude manner, point out that they saw it as a behavior pattern. In no particular order, others who haven&#39;t been here as long called them a liar; they called the whole &#39;Board a toxic place and implicated you, hS, other long-standing oldbies, in why; you, hS, others, defended yourself; Data got increasingly frustrated and defensive; a ban was proposed. <br><br>Again, a major part of my disagreement here is that I strongly dislike the precedent it sets. This &quot;person said something mean - Permaban&quot; is never how we&#39;ve done it, and it&#39;s deeply alarming. </p>

            <p>Basically, as far as I see it — this isn&#39;t &quot;person said something mean — Permaban&quot;; in that case, we shoud have proposed to ban July. What we have here is &quot;person tried to use an incident to bash someone they have bad blood with, replied rudely to other people, and said they&#39;ll do so in the future&quot;, which is a different horse entirely.</p>

            <p>Operating on the assumption that &quot;several years&quot; goes back to 2012, at least: as far as I remember, July was, em, biting back then and is still biting now. However, I&#39;ve never seen any malice from her. On the contrary: usually she has a good point in mind.<br>Further: as soon as July posted <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=294646;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">this</a>, Data should&#39;ve backed the hell up. While posting while sleep-deprived is a stupid idea, it&#39;s no more than that. Judging someone for their grouchiness (or bluntness, or whatever) when sleep-deprived is really, really harsh. What Data did wasn&#39;t &quot;point out a repeating behaviour pattern&quot;, it was, pardon my vulgarity, shit-stirring. As far as I&#39;m aware, they didn&#39;t post in that thread because they thought July needed calling out, they posted there because there&#39;s a lot of bad blood between them and July and they viewed that incident as an opportunity to sling mud at her.</p>

            <p>I wasn&#39;t around for the whole incident with previous members of the Board, and even if I were I would need time to know them better, form my own opinion, and then I would have something to say in their case.<br><br>I don&#39;t know Data that much.

            <p>How accurate is it to judge someone on their perceived personality?<br>Even if it <i>is</i> just to work alongside their actions (had Data been a tad more mature earlier, he&#39;d have been given greater benefit of a doubt when he pissed people off, et al,) surely that&#39;s an incredibly subjective thing? <br><br>I suppose deducing that someone won&#39;t let go of something because <i>they haven&#39;t let go of something</i> isn&#39;t too insane, but I think that &#39;You, individual human, who holds personal bias out of no fault of their own, know him better,&#39; might be a bit dangerous.* <br><br>I mean, I&#39;m doing the exact same thing as you are, but that&#39;s just because I&#39;m a coward who doesn&#39;t trust his own judgement. <br><br><br>*If that wasn&#39;t clear enough, I&#39;m not having a go.

            <p>Normally I&#39;d say give Data another chance. He (they?) certainly didn&#39;t get to zdimensia&#39;s calibre, or (heh!) Rifle Calibre Guy&#39;s.

            <p>After thinking on it, sleeping on and generally mulling it over for so long that I was sure that when I finally got around to post, it would all be over, but then weird stuff happened.<br>My no is based on something of a technicality.

            <p>I feel I should clarify my position:<br><br><b>Ban their arse for good.</b><br><br>We do not need people like Data Junkie on the Board or in the community. We do not require them. And most importantly, we do not deserve them. We do not deserve pathetic people coming back to sling mud and hurl insults at people.<br><br>One does have to wonder why someone would bother impersonating me. My personal theory - and forgive my sounding paranoid - is that whoever this is wanted to torpedo the vote and make Data Junkie look like the victim of harassment from outside sources, so they could play the hero and make everyone <i>legitimately</i> calling for a ban look bad. Whoever you are, you do not speak for me. I do. And I&#39;m better at it.<br><br>In any event, I was and remain in favour of the ban. Indeed, I&#39;m in favour of a permanent ban, because the last time they went away for years? All that appears to have happened is that they stewed in their own vitriol and waited for a chance to dredge all this BS back up again. A permanent ban will ensure that this level of harassment and hostility will not come out of his mouth again.<br><br>Sorry if I sound emotional. I am emotional. They <i>hurt</i> my <i>friend</i>.

            <p>... you should correct your statement that &#39;there&#39;s no way of tracing its origin to other words&#39;. At least one coinage in <i>Jabberwocky</i>, &#39;beamish&#39; (as in, come to my arms, my _____ boy), has a very clear origin: it comes from Beamish, which is a <a href="http://www.beamish.org.uk/">living open-air museum</a> aka &#39;historic village&#39;.<br><br>Wikipedia (which Neshomeh has already cited) also describes &#39;cyberspace&#39; as a neologism, despite it being created by blending.<br><br>The OED also allows &#39;to coin&#39; to mean &#39;esp. in a bad or depreciatory sense: To fabricate, invent, make up (something specious, pretentious, or counterfeit).&#39;.

            <p>Done my research now. Portmanteaux are only one type of blend word, and based on hS&#39;s post, blending is a subset of coinage. I&#39;d say blend words still count as new words.<br>It&#39;s all very complicated.<br><br>(Also: squeeeee Edgeworth!)</p>

            <p>Both blends and coinages are word-formation processes. The typical process of coinage usually involves the extension of a product name from a specific reference to a more general one. For example, think of Kleenex, Xerox, and Kodak. <br><br>I&#39;ll take an example from an OFU - Hogwarts Fanfiction Academy, to be specific:<br><br><i>&quot;I believe Ron coined the term &#39;Mini-Aragogs&#39;...&quot;</i><br><br>And this is where &#39;coinage&#39; is used correctly; Ron used a specific reference - the fact that the HP minis look like Aragog - and coined a new term.<br><br>(Also: Franziska &gt; Edgeworth every day!)</p>

            <p>So now you&#39;ve narrowed the definition of coinage to &quot;proper nouns being changed into words&quot;?<br>Based on every online dictionary I can find, coinage just refers to the creation of a new word or phrase, with no particular requirements as to the origin of said word or phrase.<br>As for &quot;Mini-Aragog&quot;, how is that not a blending? &quot;Miniature&quot; + &quot;Aragog&quot;.

            <p>I don&#39;t thing a common dictionary would elaborate on a linguistic definition, especially if there is that thing called &#39;polysemy&#39;. <br><br>I&#39;m not saying those processes aren&#39;t very closely related, but there are those subtle differences between a compound, a blend, or a coinage.

            <p>I guess I let that other post get a little overwrought . . . Just, after my username was used to attack someone else, I felt personally offended that Torolleon had presumed so much about my opinion on the matter, based on my one post defending July which (I don&#39;t think?) said much particularly negative towards Data.  And then I gave in to my bad habit of psychoanalyzing people, and came to the conclusion that El Torollo was seeing this as a simple black-and-white issue, and assumed no one in the community had a more complex feeling on the matter than &quot;ban nao&quot; or &quot;no banz.&quot;<br><br>And then I ranted.

            <p>All of the other posts by Toroll just had the subject line filled in, only the one impersonating doctorlit had anything else written in it. <br>I don&#39;t think the choice to impersonate doctorlit was purely one to get as many yes votes as possible, I believe that it may have been either a more personal attack on Data (not that I&#39;m saying they are a victim overall, more that Toroll may have something against them), or it was an attempt to make it seem like the posts were genuine that backfired when they got the pronoun&#39;s wrong and thus went back to the simpler sort of posts. If it&#39;s the latter it was a bit of poor research and timing for Toroll, if its the former, it&#39;s more malicious and perhaps implies that Toroll had a bit more knowledge of the PPC, at least perhaps the older PPC, than we are assuming they have. <br><br>Storme Hawk<br>Who&#39;s kind of afraid they&#39;re getting a bit too paranoid and becoming too much of a conspiracy theorist. <br>P.S. That&#39;s got me thinking, maybe Toroll is trying to make us all paranoid, it&#39;s a good first step if they&#39;re trying to pull the PPC apart, i.e it&#39;s something I would do if I were to attempt something similar. Although once again, it may just be my paranoia popping up. </p>

            <p>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA256<br><br>Yay, I get to nerd out about theoretical CS!<br><br>So, broadly, I&#39;m using a public-key cryptosystem. In this case, GPG. The idea behind this sort of thing is that I generate a keypair, which contains a public and private key. I tell everyone the public key, and keep the private key secret. If you &quot;apply&quot; one key to some message and then apply the other key to the result of that, the original message comes out. However, undoing an application of one key is extremely computationally difficult[1], so the only way to retrieve a message that&#39;s been locked with a private/public key is to use the public/private key to unlock it.<br><br>If you want to say something to me secretly, you apply the public key and send me the result of that. Then, since I&#39;m the only one who knows the private key, I&#39;m the only one who can finish the math and read your message. In reality, there&#39;s a few other things you have to do to make this more secure, but yeah.<br><br>Signatures (which is what I&#39;m using) are the opposite process. I take my message[2] and apply my private key to it to create the signature. Then, anyone can take my public key and apply it to the signature. Then, they check if the message they&#39;re seeing is what I&#39;ve signed. If that happens, that means that I (or at least, someone who has my private key) signed the message.<br><br>So, no, they can&#39;t copy paste the weird block at the end, unless they plan to repost, bit for bit, the message it was attached to. Otherwise, checking the signature will show that the message was tampered with, because the text it&#39;s attached to won&#39;t match what was signed.<br><br>[1]: The underlying cryptography involves choosing two large primes p and q. Then you take N = p * q, and find e and d such that e * d = 1 (mod (p - 1)(q - 1)). This means that (m<sup>e)<sup>d</sup></sup> = (m<sup>d)<sup>e</sup></sup> = m (mod N), but given N and e, finding d requires factoring a number that&#39;s a product of two primes. So, I tell you N and e, but keep d secret. (Finding d from N and e requires time proportional to (something &gt; 1) to the 4096, in our case.)<br><br>[2]: Sorry, lied. What I do is run my message through (in this case) SHA256, a function that goes from data to a 256-bit integer in a way that is currently impossible to generate collisions for. That is, if I tell you the SHA356 output (or hash) I want, you have no way to create an input that is different from mine and gives that hash without at least NSA-level computing power. Then, I do the signature thing to the hash, which is close enough to signing the message and avoids some other attacks.<br><br>(Let us pray that there is no polytime algorithm for prime factorization, that P != NP, and that quantum computing is impractical)<br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br>Version: GnuPG v2<br><br>iQIcBAEBCAAGBQJXFwk7AAoJECoUIwgjiOkk314QALwxYOst5j1Qnlz/kBTwg+mH<br>l/Mu9kuJ2E/G9GcvfjnGMlHrk5W0Z6XvuY88OHfEfYr5OML/9PAstOglmzz4ZOA4<br>j1b2X08JYnrT1HgYfjGOV6lSHcaaTWEC7/N59GRijf/ebuVvg4/hENRxfZenknHd<br>GOszQlfCP2ilNuop39bK/dKYCcwWi3HPp+JvYBE8rH63f4T7GzpWJmFKfbCuGbaD<br>7pppOUipn5J2wI7fZsDObHrAFQlbhC7riTuSKL8MAcBpDKVCUavaZy0hinYDDntB<br>vUkj6nDcmY7GEtinUuWmtX4jJ7MXHfhnSJQBqS5kqx1PCR16W4Qd8XqHDijrgvQO<br>HgMxknLUdiNFWlLdv/qvTdQkylcs0ZjP1R+NCIMrDSgV4PdDuuf64Xu17HTSWch9<br>DjBoGQ07nVhMFYQqOY2ArzgZgzbCTQpM0DfTHpXYL0wB59NMiw2Ni3N85fL8ynyx<br>IID8bqs6/24Po+BK+nALvosUYLwpBpPxwscUrwTFwNCoUKAqC5aeJ1WAEYgf2+wr<br>fUmewd005PWseqh0Zr1NyVPh/iriSLt/KHWJ+8mBqEoLfMhAcrov6Nc3/t6YmFiK<br>sJpKGBfO7DouBjs3qeCMOP7M3hSE3A/7oeO9T71It+tKlkuEsM7WF3Hcd36gUubk<br>ZC4xHxKo1h0qlKGvsMp0<br>=d7aR<br>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br></p>

I&#39;m not currently planning to cast a vote, *especially* not in the next, oh, seven hours or so, but if I did suddenly decide to...yeah, it *definitely* wouldn&#39;t be very short. As you can probably tell. Good night!</p>

            <p>Data Junkie has stated in this thread that they intend to take time off from the PPC even if not banned. As I see it, the main problem with their behavior was that they persisted in an argument that the original disputants had resolved. Taking time off would fix the problem in the short term as well as give them some time to reflect on their behavior, formulate an apology, and reframe their concerns in a less combative way. I am entirely in favor of discussing the purpose of the PPC (why write missions, what counts as a flame, how should disputes be resolved), but I think it would be more productive to do so in a more emotionally detached, philosophical way. <br><br>I propose a temporary ban on this topic. Specifically, I propose that <b>everyone</b> refrain from discussing the purpose of the PPC, Boarders&#39; personal histories, and their opinions on the structure and functioning of the Board for a period of. . . a week sounds good. During this week, we will <b>all</b> reflect on this discussion, think about how we could have been more diplomatic, rethink our positions, figure out how true our accusations against other Boarders are, etc. At the end of this week, a designated mediator would start a thread for the re-discussion of the issue, where everyone will apologize and vote on whether or not we need to keep discussing any topics related to this dispute.<br><br>The ideal mediator I think would be someone who has followed this discussion but was not heavily involved in it and was present for the past incidents referenced. I match the first two criteria, and am willing to mediate, because I love mediating.<br><br>--Key hopes we&#39;ll be able to get along</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a vote going on about banning Data Junkie, for reasons which are outlined in hS&#39; initial calling for a ban post. A troll stepped in and posted as several people, including you, who then noticed what was happening (Phobos was the first) and got angry about it. The troll was using Tor to disguise her (she eventually spoke up) IP address, hence hS terming her the Toroll (Tor+Troll), and her posts have now been wiped for the most part. (She stated goals of trying to tear apart the PPC, blah, blah, completely misunderstanding the community, blah, not knowing hS too well either, blah, blah, my post somewhere in this mess titled &#39;Excuse you?&#39; probably gives a fair idea of some of what she said in her first substantive post). Apart from that...hm. hS has now passed on vote tallying duties, Desdendelle has taken them up, and there&#39;s continuing discussion going on as well as a discussion in a different thread on banning procedure. The vote is also still continuing, to my knowledge; feel free to vote or abstain or vote with specifications, etc, etc.<br><br>That&#39;s the most recent stuff, anyway. Hopefully it&#39;s understandable...if not, hopefully someone else can fill you in more clearly. But this should hopefully at least make a good start.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Probably this is what would happen anyway, but I&#39;m in favour of a temporary soft-ban.<br>Like hS says, Data has repeatedly been rude, with no apparent understanding of why they&#39;re in the wrong. They&#39;ve misrepresented things, and been condescending.<br>But they haven&#39;t caused the perfect storm that I&#39;ve seen before, with zdimensia and... others. I think that if we tell Data everything they&#39;ve done wrong, all laid out neatly, then ask them to leave and cool off, then we&#39;ve done enough.<br>And that way, if they come back and do it again, they&#39;ve been warned, they&#39;ve had their transgressions explained, and they&#39;ll eat a hard ban in about ten seconds.<br>So, yeah. Ban.<br>(For the record, I understand how sometimes, people just don&#39;t see that what they&#39;re doing is hurting others unless it&#39;s explained in simple terms, which is why I&#39;m feeling lenient.

            <p>... people think an IP ban is something special.<br><br>I tried to make this very clear last time: if you are banned from the PPC, you are banned from the PPC (forever, for five minutes, whatever people choose). You get told to leave. Hopefully you do that.<br><br>If you <i>don&#39;t</i> leave when told to, your IP address gets blocked as a technical enforcement.<br><br>If you post from multiple IPs, as the Toroll is doing, you get your messages deleted on sight instead.<br><br>They&#39;re not different levels of banning.

Even if you did need my vote, all you had to do was wait for me to cast it.  Or if you were impatient, which you clearly were, then you could have emailed me and asked me to vote.

            <p>Why did whoever did this impersonate who they did? Some, like doctorlit, Desdendelle, Phobos I understand, they are relatively big names in the community. But why some of the less well known people as well (no offence meant)? <br>I mean the obvious answer is to try and act as a smokescreen, but then how did they choose which ones to impersonate, it&#39;s obviously not random, or at least it&#39;s a small pool to work from if it was random, so there must be some connecting factor between all the people chosen, one that (atm) I can&#39;t see (granted it&#39;s 3:30 am here, but still, something to ponder). </p>

            <p>Look at all the (nm) votes. They&#39;ve all been posted from IP addresses in various parts of Europe, which makes me suspect that someone is using proxy servers.

            <p>All of the IP addresses are from &#39;Tor Exit Router&#39;s&#39; from the Tor Anonymity Network. Well, all of them bar one that is. The only one that doesn&#39;t send me through to Tor is Alleb&#39;s one (91.228.151.52) which doesn&#39;t connect to anything. This may just be my internet not working correctly, or it could be from an unprotected router, that could be the perpetrators. I don&#39;t know. <br><br>So on the chance that it may lead to something I put it back into the IP checker and found that the IP belongs to one Paulus M. Hoogsteder trading as Meanie, with this address in the Netherlands: Populierendreef 442, 2272HG Voorburg, NETHERLANDS. So I put this into Google Maps, which shows it as a house in quite a nice area of The Hague. <br><br>I&#39;m afraid without more information I can&#39;t do much else, but I&#39;ve potentially found the address and alias of the perpetrator if nothing else. <br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>If I wanted to cause havoc like this, I&#39;d sign my name to it. This honestly isn&#39;t the first time we have had problems with this. The IRC had to jump servers because we had an issue with name-stealing, and at one point we briefly had people sock-puppeting another boarder (who had actually left weeks prior) to attack someone else, though that was way back in... 2010 or 2011, so it&#39;s probably not the same person. Phobos is right, it&#39;s probably someone who just wants me gone.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t even see an IP for your posts. But if you look at all my posts, they all should have the same IP, unless my service provider switched locations, while someone like, say Alleb, has an IP that definitely does not match the one for their ban vote. Admittedly, I suppose it could be a combo of what you just said plus what Phobos said about posting from a separate location, but usually the continents match up if not the actual location.</p>

            <p>Seeing as at the time of my original post I was thinking it was either a permanent ban or no ban at all, I voted for the permanent ban. However, I find myself agreeing with Seafarer, that perhaps a better way to resolve this situation would be a temporary ban, especially seeing as Data is saying that they want to leave anyway, I feel that enforcing said leave for a certain amount of time is a better idea than permanently banning them. <br><br>Storme Hawk <br>Whose basically changing their vote from permaban to temporary ban, in a whole lot more words. </p>

            <p>In so doing I feel a little divided, because I understand your points, and I also understand Data has had plenty of chances to correct their behaviour - but sees said behaviour as not in need of correcting. You make a very strong case for a ban, but in the event there might be any chance, however slight, for amends to be made and for that step to not be necessary, I&#39;d like us to at least try.

            <p>A) Definitely not taking back, no. B) Maybe? Who knows!

            <p>I won&#39;t tell anythng about the flames, since I participated to this, but the fact that Data Junkie is hostile to the very concept of mission, and that means being hostile to the very existence of PPC.<br><br> While the idea of people having the courage of posting their stories is something I can acknowledge, badfic targeted by the PPC are stories where the faults are so blatant that I won&#39;t insult someone by telling that&#39;s their best. For instance, speaking of Percy Jackson, the concept of a character being a child of Artemis, or one of the Big Three after WW2, show a disrespect of basic canon whose it&#39;s better to laugh than to cry about it. And I&#39;ll remember to Data Junkie that missions can also be about trollfics.<br><br>If they disapprove the very core of this world and community, why the duck are they sticking around?</p>

            <p>It&#39;s perfectly possible to contribute to the PPC without doing missions. Most of the stories I have in the works aren&#39;t missions! But I do see most of the points you&#39;re making - I suppose I just wanted to head off the potential &quot;if you don&#39;t like missions you don&#39;t belong in the PPC&quot; argument at the pass. If nobody is saying that, I apologise.</p>

            <p>Because let me tell you, July was the one who helped me a few months back when I didn&#39;t just step on somebody&#39;s toes but I broke their bloody legs. She provided me with all the support I needed, helped me to see that I should let it go and I won&#39;t change what happened, and ever since I joined I can&#39;t say a bad word about her. Sure, she&#39;s snappy sometimes, and definitely agitates easily, but then again who isn&#39;t?<br><br>What you are doing is not &quot;agitating for change&quot;.

            <p>This is the same July that talked me out of suicide twice. However, she&#39;s also the person who bullied Bronwyn, Tray Gnome, Digital Socrates and Aster Corbett, among others, until they left the PPC. She&#39;s done the same thing in other communities too. Just because someone helps people when they feel like it doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t also have a pattern of lashing out at people over the slightest things. Even some of her own friends and former friends can at least attest to that much.</p>

            <p>I believe there are circumstances were it is appropriate to maintain negative feelings towards someone for a very long time, perhaps even until the end of one&#39;s life.  Without knowing all the facts, maybe this is one of those circumstances. I will agree that five years seems like a long time, but it may be one of those circumstances where it is justified.<br></p>

            <p>But no, seriously, let&#39;s break it up here folks. Data, if you have some kind of grievance with July, I would say you should probably discuss your differences among each other, in private; I remember some of the details, enough to know you don&#39;t like her particularly much, but I don&#39;t feel it was necessary to derail this topic into a shot at her. I&#39;m not sure I get where you&#39;re coming from with &quot;incredibly toxic at its core&quot; re: the PPC, but this isn&#39;t the time or place; email me if you&#39;d like to talk about it, maybe. I just got here, I missed the big kerfluffle, but skimming through posts it does seem to me as if you&#39;re going out of your way to stir things up just as they settle down, and that really isn&#39;t acceptable. Let&#39;s remember what this topic is for, all right?<br><br>Everyone else, I think the point is made and your displeasure expressed; there&#39;s no need for further piling on.

            <p>Okay, I admit that you writing faster than I can read sometimes grated on my nerves. You’ve been called out for making the PPC &quot;too dark&quot;, there may have been one or two other occasions I don’t remember clearly, and I’m aware that not everything happens on the Board, where I can see it.

            <p>Well, obviously, if you&#39;re set on leaving and determined that this is for sure what you want to do, nothing I or anyone else can say will convince you to stay. However, should you choose to leave, make sure you&#39;re making your decision for the right reasons - make sure it&#39;s what <i>you</i> are happy with, not just what other people might or might not want. I&#39;ll admit I&#39;ve obviously missed a lot and have no Earthly idea what might have brought this on, but I do think it&#39;s important you reflect on this and make sure any decision you come to is what you feel is best for you. If that is still leaving, then good travels, none of us can stop you, but make sure you won&#39;t regret doing so in a week&#39;s time, if that makes sense.<br><br>Of course, if you&#39;ve left and don&#39;t intend to ever return, there&#39;s every possibility you won&#39;t even see this post, so maybe I&#39;m talking to air.

            <p>I know it may not be easy now, but try to remember some of the good you&#39;ve done for us, even the smallest of things. Think of all the times you or something you brought to us managed to make even one of our days slightly better.<br><br>You have written literal novels-worth of stories that have made people in this community laugh or smile or think.<br><br>You helped turn a few silly musings into an awesome, popular tournament which I look forward to participating in each year.<br><br>Your activity helps all the time to bring life to this board. Without you, this place wouldn’t be the same.<br><br>If you make a mistake or if something you do upsets someone, I can assure you, it will be forgotten in time. Nobody is judging you poorly. No one is keeping a running tally of your mistakes, and I can say with certainty that no one is happy to see you go. If you have any doubts, just look at the outpouring of love that are the responses in this thread.<br><br>I would ask that you reconsider leaving us, but if you really feel like it would be better for you if you went, then I at least urge that you consider something less than forever?<br><br>I hardly post, and we don&#39;t know each other very well, so maybe what I&#39;m saying doesn&#39;t carry much weight. It would be wonderful to still have the opportunity to change that, though.<br><br>Whatever you decide to do, I earnestly wish you the best. It’ll never be the same without you.</p>

            <p>I wonder why? Oh, I know... because I did exact the same thing. Remember? And the reasons were pretty much the same:<br><br>- Making a nuisance of myself: check<br>- Stepping on people&#39;s toes: forget toes, I stepped on whole legs!<br>- Thinking it will be better without me: triple check<br>- Feeling like the public enemy #1: I assume check.<br><br>Look, the point is, whatever happened between you and some selected people (and I&#39;m not gonna pry about it), it shouldn&#39;t affect your interaction with the entire community.<br><br>I know, I know, you&#39;re probably gonna go with &quot;it&#39;s not your business&quot;, &quot;stop pestering me about it&quot;, etc., but my point is, I&#39;ve been through this. This exact way of thinking. It&#39;s not exactly a thing to be talked about in public, and you probably won&#39;t talk about it in private (at least with me), but I don&#39;t think this is a good choice you&#39;re making. If you need, take a break, even a long one, but don&#39;t forsake those two (?) years of fun.<br><br>Also, about you calling yourself a bitch... Who says it&#39;s always a bad thing?<br><br><img src="http://cdn4.gurl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/headbitch1.gif"><br><br>So take your time to think about it, Iximaz.

            <p>Or at least, hopefully an apology.<br><br>I apologize for being so brusque in response; no one on the board deserves that. Des and Iximaz didn&#39;t deserve that kind of reply. I should have held off on posting anything until I wasn&#39;t as ridiculously tired as I was and actually capable of reacting and responding reasonably; I just hadn&#39;t thought that I&#39;d get sledgehammered with two replies in the same minute questioning what was going on, and it caught me off-guard.<br><br>Again, I&#39;m sorry.</p>

            <p>I made a post about how July acted in this thread. You then brought up history and made a personal attack on her in general, which was exactly what I was criticising her for doing. And I know you&#39;ll say that July was in the wrong and you&#39;re in the right, but that&#39;s not how it works.<br>Now everybody is all about defending her from your attacks, rather than looking at what she did and considering whether that apology wasn&#39;t rather half-hearted.

            <p>I would also like to believe that people are able to change for the best in years. However, I would note that Data didn&#39;t just jump into random threads with July in them and start yelling; he responded to a behavior that he saw as similar to the sort of thing that used to happen in the IRC, four-five years or so ago.<br><br>No, I don&#39;t think it was necessary. In fact, I&#39;d really have preferred it not happen. And, if it were to be brought up, ye <i>gods</i> do I not want to see those dirt-sucking, bone-grubbing chat-logs again. <i>Ever</i> again. But you may want to be careful what you wish for. They don&#39;t really paint anyone who&#39;s in them in a good light. July, me, Data, Caddy, Miah, Dann - every one of us comes out looking like a jerk. Data&#39;s using the reference to remind those who were around what happened. If you really want a refresher course, I&#39;m sure more than one person has those logs.<br><br>But saying &quot;This is a serious behavior problem, and it&#39;s been going on for a long time,&quot; is not a Constitution violation. Yes, even if the person is &quot;an established community member.&quot; July has been gone for years, but was around for years before that - Data is in the same situation. Neither of them has more credibility than the other.<br><br>Saying &quot;This person is a jerk and I don&#39;t like them&quot; is, a violation, and . . . eh, why am I even bothering?

            <p>For one, I was a frequent sparring partner back in the IRC&#39;s heyday. For another I personally witnessed her bullying Aster Corbett and Digital Socrates, and was shown logs of her interactions with Bronwyn and her talking about Tray Gnome and melancolicPoet behind their backs. If you like, I&#39;m certain I can dig it all up again. It&#39;s not like this is the only community she&#39;s done it in either. We&#39;ve had people from other communities who were interested in joining but refused to when they found out July was a member because they&#39;ve been a target of hers. Go ask around the Imperium Nova chat and I suspect you&#39;ll get a whole mix of reactions about her based on who you ask.<br><br>Of course, last time this was brought up as an issue it was dismissed as an &quot;IRC problem&quot; because, as we all know, the IRC is not part of the PPC for real. I figure now that she&#39;d done it on the board, July&#39;s behavior was no longer an &quot;IRC problem&quot; but a genuine problem.</p>

            <p>Looking at Ix&#39;s messages, it looks like she was just confused because someone started posting their agent interactions on the main Board out of nowhere. That&#39;d be confusing to anyone! Assuming that she wanted to put someone in their place or whatever seems to be assuming a lot of malice unfairly.

            <p>I believe my friend&#39;s version of events over yours, a person I barely know who I haven&#39;t seen do anything but antagonise and throw their toys out of their pram for... well, one assumes attention. Wow. What a truly unpredictable happenstance that nobody could possibly have foreseen.<br><br>I would bring up more points here in July&#39;s defence, but it&#39;d be completely pointless to do so because you do not argue in good faith. You are here, as far as I&#39;m concerned, for one purpose and one purpose alone; the character assassination of a dear friend. And you think you can get away with it because she snapped at <i>another</i> dear friend of mine who happened to be one of the most popular people on the Board.<br><br>Well, you can&#39;t.<br><br>I&#39;m not a PG. I don&#39;t have any power or pull on the Board. But then, neither do you. You&#39;re just a toddler howling on the shop floor because Mummy let someone else ride in the trolley instead. I find your attitude not only repugnant but in active breach of everything in the Constitution, and far, <i>far</i> too reminiscent of the vicious, unpleasant little fishwife I used to be to feel comfortable sharing a forum with you.<br><br>And hey, maybe other people are akin to secondary targets as well. I wouldn&#39;t be too surprised if getting July&#39;s friends angry enough to shout at you because of how you treat her is something you consider an added bonus, because it is a Law of the Interwebs that the person who gets angry loses, regardless of why they&#39;re so incensed. If so, you <i>really</i> need to look up the Constitution, mister Agent Of Change. Your behaviour is unbecoming of anyone in this community, <i>regardless</i> of whatever perceived slights July threw your way back before you buggered off, and it needs to stop. <b><i>NOW.</i></b><br><br>Sorry to rant, chaps, but this needed to be said. Yes, this whole thing is a mess, but Data&#39;s just adding to it.</p>

            <p>labelling anybody who says things you don&#39;t want to deal with as a &quot;troll&quot; is definitely a good way of doing things, instead of assuming they&#39;re someone burned by July&#39;s toxicity.<br><br>Take it from me, kid, you don&#39;t know who you&#39;re dealing with.

            <p>Every writer in the Hobbitfics I&#39;ve read is antagonising Dбin II Ironfoot because of reasons as well as every Thorin/OC fic is removing the importance of Thorin III Stonehelm by having their OC be the mother of the last reincarnation of Durin and yeah, I know Lee Pace&#39;s Thranduil was a dick but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a villain.<br><br>These are a salty noodle&#39;s words because she&#39;s reading an eighty six chapter fic where her special snowflake OC who has Thorin, Beorn, Thranduil, Legolas, and  Dбin lusting after her. And she&#39;s twenty two years old but looks to be fourteen. Also, why does she have to look like Legolas&#39; mother? I&#39;ve been screeching like a pterodactyl since a while ago.<br><br>I&#39;m a Thorin/OC writer, but it&#39;s also a challenge for me to see if I could come up with decent characters and not characters like this Special Snowflake. And so far, I think I&#39;m alright. Anyway, I&#39;m a very salty noodle right now since this OC is meant to save the Durin sons and she&#39;s so whiny and incapable of defending herself. <br><br>Oh yeah, special snowflake OC has been given super powers by the Valar for....reasons I guess. She&#39;s basically a Maia now with her power. ...ing hell. You know, the blessing of the Valar could have sufficed since that means they approved of your quest to save the Sons of Durin. But no, they had to give that OC powers. If you are capable of saving these three dwarves, you won&#39;t need powers, you will prove yourself capable of defending your wards. Not dependent on THEM to protect you. <br><br>Ranting noodle is done now. </p>

(Percabeth, Jiper, Frazel, and Thaleo)</i><br><br><br><br><br>Annabeth was not pleased with the news she heard. The first message she received in the morning was for her and the girls to visit Aoide Records. Over the last couple of weeks they were performing on both private and public events, and the entire band was hoping for at least few days of break (Annabeth especially, since that was her only chance to see Percy). Instead, when she, Thalia, Piper, and Hazel all arrived at their recording company, the first revelation she heard made her almost spit out the water she was drinking.<br><br>“You want us to go where!?”<br><br>The company’s CEO, a young blonde man wearing an expensive-looking leather jacket, yellow t-shirt, and aviator shades, beamed her a dazzling smile. <br><br>“Barcelona,” he repeated. “I’ve heard it’s quite lovely this time of the year; I’m sure you’ll be adored there! And it’s going to be a wonderful promotion tour.”<br><br>He clasped his hands and looked around from one girl to another. All of them had rather vague expressions. Finally, Annabeth spoke again.<br><br>“Listen, Apollo…”<br><br>“Ekhm...” The CEO cleared his throat and looked at the daughter of Athena from behind his shades. He gently nudged his head towards the people in the hallway; managers, sound crew, and other performers. “We’re not alone, Miss Chase.”<br><br>“I mean… Mr. Lite, we agreed for this ‘tour’,” Annabeth made air quotes with her fingers, “as long as it was only around the country. Don’t you think that going overseas might be a little… difficult in our current state?”<br><br>“I’m sure it’s gonna be fine.” Mr. Lite smiled again. “I&#39;ll send you all the details soon. Now run along, get a good rest, enjoy the rest of the week off! We have Europe to conquer!”<br><br>***<br><br>&quot;So, are we going or not?&quot; Piper was the first one to speak, after the girls left the studio. They all agreed that after hearing this they all needed coffee (and chocolate, in Hazel&#39;s case). &quot;I mean, we agreed for this feint only for the sake of the quest, but now we&#39;re going to cross the ocean again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Senate is not going to be happy about this.&quot; Hazel added. &quot;So close to the Ancient Lands? Last time was a must, but now?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now it&#39;s a must, too,&quot; Annabeth replied. &quot;Two months after Gaea&#39;s defeat and we still hadn&#39;t hunted down all of her minions. All the monsters roaming free, all the Ancient heroes that pledged their allegiance to her... And now we learn that they are leaving the country.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your Senate will have to deal with it,&quot; Thalia said. &quot;The sooner we end this whole pretending the better. Seriously, why did you have to pair me up with Valdez of all people?!&quot;<br><br>&quot;It was my mom&#39;s idea.&quot; Piper raised her hand slightly. &quot;She said that we all need to have &#39;secret lovers&#39; for the media to talk about, and since you&#39;re the only one without a boyfriend...&quot; She looked at the daughter of Zeus apologetically. &quot;I&#39;ll treat you for lunch after we&#39;re done with all of this. For a week.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I guess that means we&#39;re going?&quot; Hazel asked, and looked at Annabeth.<br><br>Daughter of Athena nodded. &quot;No choice. Let&#39;s meet up with the boys and see how their part of the quest goes.&quot;<br><br><br><br><br>#PleaseDon&#39;tHurtMe</p>

            <p>The idea of the characters pretending to be in a rock band as a cover for an investigation is. . . not exactly typical of the PJO universe, but much more plausible than the summary. (It doesn&#39;t quite fulfill the prompt since they&#39;re not trying to &quot;leave their life.&quot; Unless said trip takes them to the Underworld.)(I mean the ancient entrance to the Underworld; they&#39;re clearly not going to San Francisco. I wonder if it still works?) And Apollo as a music company executive makes a <i>lot</i> of sense.</p>

            <p>&#39;Ssssh, it&#39;s okay. It&#39;s going to be okay. You&#39;re among friends,&#39; John T. Elf whispered to the tree, placing a thick, cosy blanket over some branches. <br><br>&#39;It - it was awful,&#39; The tree whimpered, a pathetic and unwelcome shudder running through its colossal, age-worn trunk. <br><br>&#39;Please, if you could just explain what happened,&#39; John said quietly, worried that his voice would cause the wooden behemoth to tumble to the ground in a great pile of elf-crushing leaves and branches. <br><br>&#39;First,&#39; The tree sniffed. &#39;First she started with the questions.&#39; <br><br>&#39;That&#39;s awful,&#39; John said, not getting it. <br><br>&#39;I don&#39;t even know what a Galadriel is! Why would she ask me?!&#39; The tree moaned, releasing a great, rustling sob. <br><br>&#39;It&#39;s okay, it&#39;s okay,&#39; John said, carefully pouring some of his tea on the tree&#39;s roots. <br><br>&#39;Thank you,&#39; The tree whimpered, soaking the tea into its roots with a faint &#39;Schhwooooorp&#39;* noise. <br><br>&#39;She began - began,&#39; The tree paused. &#39;My bark...&#39; <br><br>&#39;She ran her fingers over your bark?&#39; John asked, face wrinkled with horror. <br><br>&#39;The ridges... wisdom and strength, all of it.&#39; <br><br>&#39;This will not do,&#39; John hissed, standing. He was getting it. <br>&#39;I will find her.&#39; <br><br>&#39;Be careful,&#39; The tree whispered. &#39;She has taken much from me. She is no longer lite...&#39; <br><br>&#39;What is she?&#39; John asked, gripping his spear in vengeful hands. <br><br>&#39;Elleth Heavy.&#39; † <br><br><br><br>*Trees actually sound like this when they absorb tea.

            <h1>4 Kid Icarus: <b>Kid Icarus Uprising 2: Hades Revenge</b><br><i>New angle Cloud joins Pit in a new aventure with plot twists, acton, and a batle for the very word. Rated T for curses, but it wil be gods sayin dem, so it&#39;s funy. I hav a covar know, makin tis stroy is evan butter!</i><br><br>Because there had to be at least one response for my favorite fandom aside from Pokemon. :D<br><br>----------<br><br>&quot;Lady Palutena?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, Pit?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What is this weird pointy thing with spiky blond hair doing here in your temple?&quot;<br><br>Palutena looked first at her servant, who was standing at the door to her chamber, and then at the corner in front of her. She chuckled before responding, &quot;Pit, this is Cloud Acton. He&#39;s a New angle, and he&#39;ll be joining you in... How do I word this...&quot;<br><br>She pulled out her spectacles and put them on before reading the letter she had receieved that morning. &quot;...a new &#39;aventure&#39; with plot twists, acton, and a batle for the very word. Either the writer of this message has questionable grammar, or we&#39;re going to be fighting to protect grammar itself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Who am I supposed to see, then? The god of language?&quot; asked Pit, fluffing his wings indignantly. &quot;I don&#39;t even know how to read!&quot;<br><br>&quot;You? Illiterate?!&quot; Cloud looked about as surprised and slightly insulted as an acute spiky-haired angle could get. &quot;Everyone and their DOG knows how to read, you idiot! Why haven&#39;t you learned how yet?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ll have to do that very, very quickly,&quot; said Palutena. &quot;We may have to round up some missing letters across the land... Perhaps there may be some running around right now that have escaped this very message!&quot;<br><br>Right on cue, a stray lowercase letter d ran by. Pit and Cloud followed it with their gazes, speechless, and then looked back to her.<br><br>&quot;Anything else we need to know?&quot; asked Cloud. &quot;I could use a little help if I am to gain any more dimensions than this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Apparently, we&#39;re supposed to be saying curses now, us gods I mean. Does that mean I get to turn whomever&#39;s causing all these letters to fly off the sheets.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hades? That&#39;s my first guess,&quot; said Pit.<br><br>The letter d ran up to Palutena&#39;s leg and muttered something, accompanied by a lowercase i. She pursed her lips. &quot;No, not Hades... Hades Revenge. No relation to the Hades we defeated, apparently. It seems that all the letters are whispering this person&#39;s name out of fear.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But why would Hades Revenge want to scare away all these letters?&quot; asked Cloud.<br><br>&quot;One way to find out,&quot; said Pit. &quot;I&#39;ll go get my Orb Staff. It&#39;s about time I learn how to spell!&quot;</h1>

            <p>(Answer numbers may not align perfectly with question numbers.)<br><br>1/ Agents are paid. In theory. In practice the PPC is chronically short of cash, so there&#39;s a lot of... non-monetary pay. According to Selene and Kaitlyn: &quot;We get paid room, board, medical fees, psych fees, repairs, equipment, and reasonable requisitions.&quot; That includes the aforementioned chair, and probably official weapons and the like. I don&#39;t think I recall anyone <i>paying</i> in the Cafeteria, either, though I may be wrong; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s common, either way.<br><br>2/ Neither Kaitlyn nor Selene are good negotiators. Kaitlyn likely just accepted whatever was offered, and Selene was busy being mentally unhinged. Given that this is the PPC, I suspect every agent&#39;s pay arrangements are different. (Agents Vemi and Penny were Discworld assassins, and got their guild fees paid in weapons, for instance.)<br><br>3/ There is, despite this, a lot of money rolling around in HQ. You can pay in <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Rudi%27s">a dozen different currencies at Rudi&#39;s</a>, and there&#39;s loads of shops in New Cal. I guess this is supported by a) whatever agents bring from home, and b) a lot of barter and trading. You can probably get a good price for chocolate - you certainly could ten years ago.<br><br>4/ Every agent has enough to eat, wear, and work with. But if your agent likes to drink or gamble, but can&#39;t scrounge up enough badfic junk to fund it, then yes, they probably will have problems.<br><br>5/ That is a really interesting question which I don&#39;t think has been answered. <sup>_^</sup> I would love to see someone write a conversation with the Quartermaster, trying to explain precisely why they count as essentials (the QM being the Morning Glory, of course).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>One would very much hope so. You said it yourself (or rather Kaitlyn and Selene said it themselves): agents get both medical provisions and reasonable requisitions. Feminine hygiene products, to my mind, count as both; it&#39;s a medical necessity not to contract, for instance, toxic shock syndrome when you have a job like an Assassin&#39;s, but it&#39;s also a reasonable request on behalf of everyone else that people not bleed all over the place.<br><br>Sometimes, y&#39;know, I&#39;m really <i>grateful</i> I&#39;m a trans woman. =]</p>

            <p>A/V Division Technician (and former JMC First Technician) Albert Sproggins looked up at one of the other techs. He was cradling what looked like a large tin box and an old-fashioned slide projector, primarily because that&#39;s what they were, so Albert got up from his report and helped him with the weight.<br><br>&quot;Thanks, Al.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No trouble, Mike. What&#39;ve we got here then?&quot;<br><br>Mike ran his fingers through what remained of his hair and sucked in air through his teeth. &quot;You&#39;re not gonna like it, Al. It&#39;s a No-Drool.&quot;<br><br>Albert went pale. &quot;Oh, sod.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, Morning Glory, actually - oh, right, that&#39;s a British thing, sorry. Uh. Yeah. Apparently we&#39;re all supposed to watch this thing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;On a scale of one to the planet leave videos from <i>&#39;Yperdrive</i>,&quot; Albert said slowly, the letter H entirely vanishing from proceedings, &quot;how bad&#39;s it going to get?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Alien sex is dangerous sex,&quot; Mike quoted.<br><br>&quot;Oh, smeggin&#39; <i>&#39;ell</i>. Why haven&#39;t you put this in the bunker with the rest of the poxy things?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because it&#39;s worse. You smell that kinda musty smell? Someone&#39;s got their hands on three-million-year-old developing fluid.&quot;<br><br>Albert&#39;s mouth fell open. &quot;Christ on a bloody bike. From &#39;ome?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You know anywhere else that&#39;s got it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nobody likes a smartarse.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Look, I need you to go get everyone while I set the projector up. We&#39;ve got to know whether or not this thing is dangerous.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;C&#39;mon, man, I don&#39;t want <i>everyone</i> to hate me.&quot;<br><br>Albert sighed theatrically as he wandered off. &quot;You don&#39;t drink tea, you great prannock, they already do.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>The assembled Technicians sat, lounged, perched, and in one case flapped (quite how a sword-billed hummingbird called Eric had become an A/V Technician nobody was entirely sure, but he was the only person who knew how to fix the photocopier) as they awaited the display. Newer members of that merry band were excited by Albert getting out his not-very-secret stash of cakes; upon seeing them stacked on the nice plate with only a couple of chips in it, veteran technicians went a bit pale. Mike sat down next to one of the editing team and wordlessly handed her a stuffed rabbit to cling to.<br><br>Albert &quot;Right. Everyone. Standard No-Drool review protocols are in effect. No phones, no recording, no running, no diving, no piddling in the shallow end. Also, since Jazminder&#39;s with us today, nobody else eats the iced buns in the pink wrappers, they&#39;re gluten-free and they&#39;ve got Tru-Blood in them. Also, for those who don&#39;t know my &#39;ome continuum, this is a Timeslide. We can enter the photograph, but why you&#39;d want to is beyond me. Okay, think that&#39;s everything, sick buckets are up by Dave&#39;s workbench in the usual spot. Eric, get the lights, will you, mate? Mike, you&#39;re on projection duty.&quot;<br><br>The house lights dimmed, courtesy of Eric perching on a handy crank, and the slide projector fired up.<br><br>A slightly grainy image of a gangly black woman filled the projection screen. &quot;Hello. My name is Antrilovorasilendar, known in this place as the Notary. Today, we will be discussing why feminine hygiene products are necessary with object lessons in what happens when substandard or insufficient supplies are available. The projector provided is a transmat device keyed to my voice, so you will be accompanying me for key segments where audience participation is key to understanding the issues that need to be addressed. Next slide.&quot;<br><br>The slide changed and a far less pleasant vista was suddenly, for lack of a better word, on display. The Notary looked seriously ill, and there was all manner of stains on the floor of the shot.<br><br>&quot;First,&quot; the Notary said hesitantly, her eyes glassy, her rail-thin body covered in nothing save for a prodigious and angry rash, &quot;we shall be discussing in detail the symptoms and causes of toxic shock syndrome, using myself as a, as a test bed...&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>Seven hours later, the A/V Division emerged from the lecture, brows soaked with sweat and clothes stained with... stains.<br><br>&quot;I want my mum,&quot; said Jazminder.<br><br>&quot;I think we all do,&quot; Albert replied.<br><br>&quot;Well you can&#39;t have her, she&#39;s mine.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ow,&quot; someone else piped up from the floor.<br><br>Mike made his way to the front of the crowd, pausing briefly to smash his head against the wall. &quot;I think we should go see Medical. Uh. Polly from Editing isn&#39;t looking so good. Everyone else? Bleepka. Go get. And send the bill to the Nightshade.&quot;<br><br>Albert paused, a lone figure amidst the stampede. &quot;Why the Nightshade?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because we can tell her exactly what happened and whose fault this is.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mike?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes Al?&quot;<br><br>&quot;D&#39;you think we&#39;ll ever be able to feel love again?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Doubt it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thought so.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;I am <i>fine</i>. Sickness passes and will not kill me, however unpleasant the symptomatic period may be.

Since I am an active field agent in the Department of Floaters, he shall have to cope with longer absences than that. Or would you rather he accompany me into a badfic to be, for instance, attacked by the incandescent genitals of a possessed fire elemental? That, for reference, was my first mission, and it&#39;s been pretty much downhill from there. I don&#39;t know how adept Suvians are at caring, even the pSuedo-varieties such as yourself who seek only the thrill of saving a life that hangs by a thread, but one imagines you draw the line at using a dragonet as ablative armour. That&#39;s what the human&#39;s for. So do not expect my door to be open to you should you ever deign to grace me with your glittery and benighted presence, our business is thoroughly concluded, now go away before I fetch the push-broom.&quot;<br><br>-- The Notary, butting heads.<br><br>((I&#39;d use the same disclaimer, but yeah, it&#39;s the <i>Notary</i>, I shouldn&#39;t <i>have</i> to point out that the Lonely Sod&#39;s views are not my own. =] ))<br><br>((I tend to assume that, er, less than entirely scrupulous former agents took to nicking replicators and the like from various badfic, and that (if/when they pegged out) Stores or Operations comes in and hoovers up those kinds of personal effects so that they can get their hands on raw materials. Still, even in our rather more enlightened society, female hygiene is seen as a non-essential purchase because reasons. It might need some of the PPC&#39;s more obstreperous members to get the point home that no, this is a thing that needs to change.))</p>

            <p>&quot;I was briefly afflicted with a debilitating infection under controlled conditions. I didn&#39;t get <i>shot</i>. I&#39;m fine, he&#39;s fine, I&#39;d rather have a molten glass sandwich than spend another moment in the company of an atrocious White Knighting Suvian probability manipulator, your presence is demonstrably unnecessary. Besides, if you attempt to arrive unannounced, I will simply retire to my TARDIS and go somewhere else in Headquarters; it would likely set me on fire several times in the process, but that is far more palatable than being around you.

One wonders how many times you&#39;ll have to do that before this season&#39;s most fashionable anklet starts delivering jolts, especially since word from DoSAT is they&#39;ve been considering upping the voltage for repeat offenders. Perhaps some curious soul will video your frenzied convulsions and share it with your superiors. I do <i>hope</i> so.<br><br>&quot;Lastly, Lolus has imprinted on me, largely because I feed him kebabs and fuss him. If I wanted to, and if my hand is forced, all I have to do is touch him with my bare hand and initiate telepathic contact. Such an action, with all my memories of the War, would likely reduce him to a gibbering, brainless husk or make him vanish <i>between</i>.

            <p>&quot;By being me, by having the memories I have, <i>I am a risk</i>. I cannot Bleep my brain into oblivion like your own degenerate species; instead, I have had to develop my own coping mechanisms, about which I shall only bore you with the details if and when I am forced at gunpoint into a therapist&#39;s office with you as a therapy buddy. All I have to do is touch him with my hand and he will know what I know. This is not a threat to his safety, it is simply a statement of fact. You would not accuse Rogue of the X-Men of threatening behaviour just because she brought it up in conversation.<br><br>&quot;And you do manipulate probability, and you do it in the field, and I&#39;ve got proof. I read the reports on your little jolly to <i>Blood Raining Night</i>. You went off alone to find this Sakura woman and emerged with her, when the Words of the badfic in question stated quite clearly that she was chained up in the dungeon. Or do you make a habit of secreting heavy-duty bolt cutters about your person in case you might need them? How very... convenient it must have been.<br><br>&quot;The fact that I am talking to you now, very much against both our better judgment, should be proof positive that I am well enough to do so. Unlike the human, I am not obliged to use a speech-to-text device when writing my reports, but I am doing so anyway. You will note the absence of any onomatopoeic vomiting noises or sudden pauses while I dash to vacate my bowels and dry-retch. When I do things, I prepare for them, and I try to prepare for as many eventualities as possible. You, on the other hand, just engage in rubber-hose cryptography with the entire multiverse until you get what you want.<br><br>&quot;One does have to wonder why you bother. But then I remember that Suvians have to be the hero, and have to save people, and then I have no need to wonder any more.&quot;<br><br>((Oh Notary.

            <p>&quot;It just looks that way. I apologise for the error.

You could rule these grey halls with no effort at all, but you instead content yourself to slum it with the normies and dress like Kurt Cobain&#39;s bag lady years. It would take but a moment, for luck is on your side, and the universe is yours to control. So control it. No Suvian can stand to one of their own, no wraith could infect another canon. No more agents dying, so far away from home as to make the concept of it meaningless. No more twisting and misshaping of the multiverse to fit the whims of a panoply of child demons. Peace in our time. You could be the hero your kind begs to be, bestrider of worlds, master of fates. Instead... you are small and ordinary and duller even than myself, which must take some doing. Is this, perhaps, what happens when the divine become truly old? When boredom or senility takes inexorable root and forces you from majesty to scrabbling amidst Generic Surface corridors? I can but wonder.&quot;</p>

            <p>I leave that to my properly deific cousins. Enough of them threw their hats in that ring that I see no particular need to do the same.<br><br>Heck, this isn&#39;t even slumming it. Slumming it was when I spent a time or two as a fox, or tried to be a decent healer in times when people still believed in the restorative properties of crocodile feces. Talk about meaningless death.<br><br>But, the thing is, you spend enough time among mortals and you start to learn things about them. I figured out a long time ago that death and free will matter. I can&#39;t just wipe pain, suffering, and bad choices away and expect people to be happy about it. On the contrary, rampantly flinging power around whether anyone likes it or not tends to get you labeled as a monster in most cases. Trust me, I found that out the hard way. What you might call my childhood was full of learning experiences like that. It&#39;s more or less why I&#39;ve settled here, where I can at least sometimes admit what I really am without suffering more than the occasional insult and, of course, the indignity of this fetching jewelry. It&#39;s supposed to come off soon, so that&#39;s good.<br><br>I&#39;m not infinite, by the way. I actually have significantly less power to sling than I did back in the day. Old age is indeed something I have to deal with eventually, though I&#39;m not quite on the point of going senile yet, I hope. : ) By that point, a physical form will probably be quite beyond me, so you won&#39;t have to worry about what happens then. I&#39;ll just drift aimlessly through the Void and finally vanish, like a puff of smoke in the breeze.<br><br>In the meantime, I mean it positively when I say that I, too, have nothing better to do than chat with you. I&#39;m off-duty, Henry is on a Sprout activity, and Su is on a mission. I consider this an excellent use of my time. We could even, y&#39;know, do it in person, assuming that doesn&#39;t constitute a nuclear-strike level of hand-forcing. Do you maybe want to clarify that, since we&#39;re approaching a more even-keeled level of discourse?<br><br>That in and of itself would not be my prize, for the record. From where I sit, the stakes are rather higher than that, and I&#39;m quite prepared to play the long game.<br><br>~Jenni</p>

            <p>Neither Jenni nor I are at all upset, because none of it is actually personal.

Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, Scape, but my read is that the Notary made a calculated strike at one of Jenni&#39;s known buttons (she&#39;s self-appointed caretaker of HQ&#39;s fire-lizard population for a reason), but once it was made clear that an actual line was nearly crossed, she backed down.

            <p>&quot;You deny your power and your heritage for the sake of... what, exactly? Personal satisfaction? The feeling of contentment when you do something without your abilities, when with a wave of the hand you could heal the sick and bring the rain? You have a very <i>laissez-faire</i> opinion of mortal races, Suvian, and it is my opinion that your particularly indolent brand of benign neglect can only go so far.<br><br>&quot;As for your shock collar being removed?In order for that to happen, I am given to understand that the proper accreditation will need to be submitted to the Medical Department, signed off by Doctor Fitzgerald, and enacted. Let&#39;s just say I wouldn&#39;t get your hopes up if I were you, Suvian... though of course you could embrace your powers and make the universe believe it never put one on you in the first place. It&#39;s not cheating if you&#39;re the one in charge of the rules.<br><br>&quot;I am also only too happy to file a restraining order with Legal, and should that miraculously cease to exist, I will file another. Time Lord memories are imperfect, as stated above, but I am <i>careful</i> when I&#39;m of a mind to be. Leave me to whatever fate awaits me, little god. My people touched mortal worlds only lightly; it would serve you well to follow our lead.&quot;<br><br>((Dissemble, redirect, constantly attack, rinse and repeat. The Notary, everyone, so proud despite a fall from grace. That paragon of the Rassiline virtues; self-abnegation in the face of the machine, obedience, and only being intelligent <i>enough</i>. Should she ever follow Jenni&#39;s lead and be a puff of smoke amidst the stars, most people will go &quot;Who?&quot; and those who don&#39;t will go &quot;Good riddance.&quot; And this is the only way she can parse her existence.

She might rationalize it as &quot;I want them to see me beat them the only way I know how, which is the only way that counts&quot;, but really it&#39;s because she&#39;s emotionally crippled to the point of a personality disorder and is terrified of what happens if it ever gets fixed, and even if it does get fixed, all she has to do is catch a bullet at the wrong time or bang her head on something and out comes the artron energy and back to square one.

            <p>Timeslides are from <i>Red Dwarf</i>. Specifically, the title of the episode in which they feature is &quot;Timeslides&quot; (Series 3, Episode 5). Kryten develops some film with three-million-year-old developing fluid that&#39;s gone a bit strange over time and allows people to walk inside the boundaries of the photograph if the negative&#39;s developed as a slide. For example, Lister uses it to steal Hitler&#39;s briefcase and (temporarily) become the most disgustingly wealthy human being to have ever lived.<br><br>JMC First Technician Albert Sproggins is also from <i>Red Dwarf</i>, though not (haha) specifically from Red Dwarf. JMC stands for Jupiter Mining Corporation, the company that owned the crimson short one, and First Technician is a rank on board. Basically it was someone in charge of a maintenance shift - A Shift got the jobs like fixing broken drive plates and stuff, while Z Shift got to fix the chicken soup machines when they started dispensing blackcurrant squash. Which shift Lister and Rimmer were part of should frankly be obvious.<br><br>&quot;Alien sex is danger sex&quot;, however, is a quote from the grossly underrated <i>Hyperdrive</i>, a much later BBC series about space travel being a bit pony. I misquoted it, for which I apologize. The scene in question is from Series 1, Episode 2, and may be watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y_nACag-Oc">here</a>. Of note is a really early appearance in a lead role by Miranda Hart, so that&#39;s nice.<br><br>The whole business here is that the Notary is deliberately infecting herself with as many disgusting things as possible, photographing the process, developing them as Timeslides, and sending it to the Morning Glory to prove a point. This is exactly the kind of ridiculous lengths to which she will go in order to win an argument, get her way, or generally make a nuisance of herself. I am also adding to her presence as kind of memetically unattractive, in the &quot;Oh sweet Jesus nobody wants to see this ever&quot; sense. This is why the MG labelled it a No-Drool; if I&#39;ve misunderstood the exact nature of a No-Drool vid, then, well, that&#39;s on me. Still, I like to believe that the Notary is so categorically unattractive that she&#39;s starred in a few, possibly involving Captain Jack Harkness (whose response to the Notary was, one imagines, &quot;never in a billion years&quot;). =]<br><br>Finally, thank you! I do try to make people laugh, so even when it falls as flat as it did just now it&#39;s good that I got to make you happy with my creative output. =]</p>

            <p>I still don&#39;t quite understand why there&#39;s Timeslides and transmats in the same video (surely one or the other is enough?), but the story as a whole makes sense.<br><br>Per their first appearance, No-Drool videos are shown to agents who have given in to lusting; they consist of smut the agents emphatically <i>don&#39;t</i> want to see, presumably in an effort to commit genocide against their hormones.<br><br>There is precedent for non-canon characters being shown (Mal - oh, stars, I&#39;m going to have to check - <i>Maeluiwen</i> was a fanfic parody Sue who apparently hung out in HQ for a while, or possibly on the Board, it&#39;s a bit wibbly-wobbly, ha ha), so the Notary is certainly a possibility as a star, and &#39;that unattractive Time Lady with a bunch of super-weird aliens&#39; would certainly qualify as No-Drool material. The disease aspect probably less so; they&#39;re supposed to be anti-lust, not anti-ability-to-cope-with-life-ever-again. I suspect the hardiest A/V techs will now be tasked with clipping out the pure-video aspects to make an actual No-Drool tape.<br><br>The one thing I <i>still</i> don&#39;t get (I know, I know! I&#39;m awful!) is: I thought this was about feminine hygiene products? What does the Notary giving herself STDs have to do with that?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I was using the No-Drool thing as a convenient shorthand for &quot;this will do horrible things to your brain, have the Bleeproduce handy&quot;.

No-Drool is immediately recognizable, people <i>know what it means</i> without having to really think about it, and I was coming from the position that No-Drool videos got their anti-lust properties from being as unerotic as physically possible - which is why the Notary was in them, suffering from a series of advanced infections.<br><br>Perhaps it could be repurposed as a memetic weapon, like a self-replicating virus that clogs up systems and displays it on advertising hoardings and the like, but maybe that contravenes the Geneva Convention.

            <p>(Since everyone else seems to always take me at my word, I guess making sure hS isn&#39;t talking rubbish falls to me.)<br><br>I&#39;ve just checked the Wiki article, and there are four references for No-Drool videos. Three of those just list characters, but the fourth is the original, and Nenya actually makes it clear what she had to watch:<br><br><i>&quot;Separate videos. But she had all the mithril lingerie bits on, or off, as the case may be. And they cut out all the bits with the hot male elves shirtless. And the Librarian–&quot;</i><br><br>It is pretty clear that the videos (okay, to nitpick, specifically the Maeluiwen video) was smut. Given her story (which still exists!), it was almost certainly lesbian smut. Which you may recognise as being a thing lots of people enjoy watching. This suggests... six possibilities:<br><br>1/ Nenya is straighter than a laser beam and is thoroughly squicked out by naked women.<br>2/ Nenya knows Maeluiwen quite well, and is thoroughly squicked out by the thought of her doing anything with anyone, female or otherwise.<br>3/ Maeluiwen is horrifyingly hideous, and this fact just goes unmentioned in her story.<br>4/ The videos are horrifyingly gruesome, and the fact that Maeluiwen was naked is purely incidental.<br>5/ Nenya was mostly horrified by the travesty against canon.<br>6/ &quot;It&#39;s just a [story]/I should really just relax...!&quot;<br><br>My money&#39;s on 1, 5, or 6, though a modified 3 is a possibility (Maeluiwen is horrifyingly unattractive <i>to Nenya</i>).

            <p>This morning the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/ACT7.html">final act</a> of Homestuck was released (obviously, major spoilers), thus marking the end of a story that has spanned several years and several thousand panels.<br><br>I&#39;ve not been on this ride for as long as some of you guys, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m ready to see it stop.

            <p>The ending feels tacked on and not very satisfying.  I mean, the animations were beautiful and all, but what did the characters accomplish?  How did they grow through these fights?  What did they learn?<br><br>Unfortunately, the answer is...not much.<br><br>Spoilers and ranting lurk beyond this point.  You have been warned.<br><br>Let&#39;s look at Karkat, for an example.  He was requested to accompany Kanaya to meet with her Denizen.  Echidna tells Kanaya that it is important that Karkat be kept out of the battle because he is important to the future universe.  So he gets KOed by Kanaya and left on LOFAF.  He wakes up in a dream bubble and joins the Ghost Army, where he is a joke.  He makes the first charge, and is immediately owned.  He wakes up on LOFAF.  He gets into a fight with the weakest (fighting-wise) of the Felt, and is immediately owned.  We get a lovely moment of him crying.  He eventually triumphs over that single, relatively weak member of the Felt.  End of Karkat storyline.  He accomplished nothing.  He learned nothing.  He didn&#39;t grow.  He might as well have not even been there.<br><br>Karkat deserved better.  So did Kanaya, Terezi, Vriska, and even Gamzee.  The same goes for various Lalondes and Striders; for Egbert and Crocker, English and Harley.<br><br>Before, we were shown a battle lost because of bad decisions, but when it was corrected, we didn&#39;t see what the good decisions could do.<br><br>We were shown Aranea unlocking Jake&#39;s latent power, and it going out of control.  We didn&#39;t get to see what happens when his powers manifested naturally.<br><br>We were shown a world in which Karkat and Kanaya were powerless to help the people they cared about.  We never got to see them become stronger, there wasn&#39;t any need for it.<br><br>We got to meet Calliope and see her get her life back, and then watched her get pushed aside for a God-like version of herself who didn&#39;t really do very much and wasn&#39;t very interesting.<br><br>Most of what happened didn&#39;t really matter, and some of the few things that could have mattered (Dirk&#39;s heroic death, for instance) were undone.<br><br>It just all felt really weak.  We had a &quot;bad&quot; timeline that was interesting and significant, but we traded it for a &quot;good&quot; timeline that was boring and insignificant.<br><br><br>So...yeah.  Just kinda disappointed.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I caught up. And... I guess I don&#39;t have any particularly strong feelings one way or the other. I&#39;m content.<br><br>While I do agree with Phobos that the ending felt rushed, and that—as several characters observed themselves—most of them lacked narratively satisfying endings, I also feel like it was explained well enough that I&#39;m okay with it. I think it was Davepetasprite<sup>2</sup> who talked about how the contributions of every single doomed timeline mattered, and all came together to result in this final victory. So, we got all the character growth, the struggle, and the sacrifice. The fact that it didn&#39;t happen to <i>these particular</i> iterations is the point. Heroes always struggle and die so that other people can have relatively happy, carefree lives. In this case, the people they struggled and died for were themselves. <i>Homestuck</i> is just meta enough to get away with crap like that without it annoying me.<br><br>It would have been really nice to see the full contrast that Phobos talked about, though, between the bad timeline and the good one. That way all the efforts of the doomed iterations would have been more rewarded.<br><br>What I really, truly believe is that <i>Homestuck</i> needs a second draft now. This is a great first draft, with loads of entertainment value for its own sake and even greater promise, but now it needs editing to prune out the BS that isn&#39;t needed (especially in the first three acts), tighten up the plot, and maybe develop that ending some more.<br><br>I kinda hope that, in five, maybe ten years or so, we&#39;ll get that second draft. Maybe in the form of an animated series or something. That would be sweet.<br><br>For now, I&#39;ll just reflect fondly on the journey to get where we are now. It&#39;s been great.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Without people badgering me to read bloody <i>Homestuck</i>. =]<br><br>Having finally finished the damn thing (I wasn&#39;t interested to see where the story went as eager for it to be over with), I still don&#39;t like the art style at all and the seizure-inducing flashing images are a particular bugbear of mine. That said, Collide and Act 7 are actually pretty good examples of how to show story without dialogue - hell, without <i>text</i>. That&#39;s good storytelling, even if I don&#39;t think Homestuck has a good story. Sprawling, yes, world-bestriding, yes, but good? A chacun son gout, I suppose.<br><br>Still, given that I legit <i>despised</i> the damned thing when I started reading it two years ago, that&#39;s probably progress. You&#39;ve come along way, Homestuck, and I am so proud of you. For a narrative that can be described as &quot;what if the cast of your standard Teenagers-Who-Save-The-World plot of Western kids shows was - get this - <i>bad at it</i>&quot;, with massive influences from a vast panoply of animй series as well, it turned into this very grandiose space opera thing. And it still found the time to give a moral at the end, like all those kids shows:<br><br>Live well and love well, for everyone who can&#39;t.<br><br>Pretty good moral, as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>

            <p>Hi guys! I suspect no one would remember who I am due to my extremely long absence from the posting board, theatres been very busy and I just got to resting after a particularly long school year and I think I can&#39;t  move properly for a while due to all the moving around I had to do. <br><br>Anyway, have I missed anything? Aside from that, I&#39;m looking for bad Hobbitfics to burn my eyes with aside from the current one I&#39;m reading which is eighty six chapters long. (Which is why I have lots of eye bleach and brain bleach in store right now) So do you guys have any suggestion? (I could remember one particular fic where  a bunch of friends landed in middle earth due to a plane crash and one of them was screeching about not going onto the plane, I can&#39;t recall the title though.)</p>

            <p>Velociraptors are cool and all, but they&#39;re much more likely to draw it out.

            <p>No, really, I am, I fully support ideas like that. But when it&#39;s always some unfortunate accident or a trip or something weirdly unexplainable I don&#39;t like it. And when the girl is fated to save the sons of Durin but it turns out they can&#39;t fend for themselves and they turn out to be whiny, I get a bit irritated because I was hoping for the girl to be able to prove herself capable of protecting the people she&#39;s supposed to keep safe. And I really don&#39;t like unexplained reasons of falling into ME like &quot;Oh, you&#39;re a Tolkien fan? Lemme just drop you right into Middle Earth just when it&#39;s starting to take a turn for the worst! Enjoy!&quot; I&#39;m a salty noodle about that.<br><br>I think a plane crash should have killed them, I&#39;m not even joking, I absolutely think they should&#39;ve died. Or if they really want to survive, they&#39;d have injuries, not bruised.<br><br>Thanks for the Smaug, I&#39;m gonna have him burn some Sues if I get irritated enough. Oh damn, I&#39;m gonna have to hide all my shiny stuff, but other than that I think we&#39;ll get along just fiiiiiiine.

            <p>Here we go, ladies and Bruces! Roughly 8 hours ago, Warner Bros. released a teaser trailer for the upcoming <i>Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them</i> (part 1). Before I start my thoughts on the trailer, I need you to watch it with me, okay? <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViuDsy7yb8M&amp;nohtml5=False">HERE IT IS</a><br><br>Now, for the analytical part:<br><br>[00:10] &quot;<i>You&#39;re an interesting man, Mr. Scamander.</i>&quot;<br>Somebody&#39;s addressing Newt. This can&#39;t tell us much, but my thoughts are shown later on.<br><br>[00:17] A tiny creature is chilling inside Newt&#39;s waistcoat. My best guess is that this is a Bowtruckle.<br><br>[00:22] &quot;<i>Kicked out of Hogwarts...</i>&quot;<br>Whoever is talking, knows enough about Newt to know what happened to him at school AND that Dumbledore was the one who was against Newt&#39;s expulsion (similar to Hagrid&#39;s). Now, my assumptions are that this is somebody from MACUSA, perhaps a sort of spy (?), or somebody important enough to get info straight from the Ministry of Magic (I assume important things such as expulsions would reach the Ministry because of the Board of Governors).<br><br>[00:26] We get a shot of Tina Goldstein and Newt dressed all fancy.<br><br>[00:30] This may or may not be the inside of MACUSA, although it gives me also a bank-like vibes. Perhaps an American equivalent of Gringotts?<br><br>[00:36] Probably either a flashback, or beginning of the movie, showing us Newt arriving at one of the immigrant inspection stations; perhaps Ellis Island?<br><br>[00:50] <a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/1/13/FB-TRL2-4.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160411021925">Muggle safety lock</a>, changing the contents of the suitcase. Pretty interesting idea.<br><br>[00:57] <a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/2/2e/FB-TRL2-5.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160411021924">Inside of Newt&#39;s suitace (the safe side).</a> We see a worn-out Hufflepuff scarf.<br><br>[01:07] Now THIS definitely is the <a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/3/34/FB-TRL2-8.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160411021922">inside of MACUSA</a>, as we see a gigantic portrait of <s>The Supreme Dictator</s> Madam President Seraphina Picquery. Yeah, I&#39;d say our &quot;MACUSA is dictatorship&quot; theory gets pretty solidified.<br><br>[01:09] <a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/b/b3/FB-TRL2-9.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160411021922">Tina is dragging Newt somewhere with haste</a>. My guess? All the beasts from Newt&#39;s suitacse had escaped already, and the authorities demanded to get Scamander in front of <s>The Beloved Supreme Leader</s> Madam President.<br><br>[01:10] We see the <a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/e/ee/FB-TRL2-10.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160411021921">American equivalent to <i>Daily Prophet</i></a>... I think it says &quot;The New York Ghost&quot;? If anyone with better eyes can figure that out, I&#39;d be grateful. Now, what does the newspaper tell us?<br><br>- We have the equivalent of the Oblivators - Federal Bureau of Covert Vigilance and No-Maj Obliviation - the FBCVNO!<br>- We see an International Wanted Poster for Alberto &quot;The Rat&quot; Macellarius. His bounty is worth 3 500 dragots, or 1 000 Galleons. Now we know that 1 Galleon = 3.5 dragots.<br>- Looks like the American wizards prefer to play Wizard&#39;s Checkers.<br>- In RL we have &quot;Wrock&quot;, and the American wizards in the &#39;20s apparently enjoy &quot;WizzJazz&quot;<br><br>[01:12] <a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/5/5b/FB-TRL2-7.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160411021922">Here we have the Goldstein Sisters, Tina and Queenie, revealing something to Newt and Jacob Kowalski, the first major <s>Muggle</s> No-Maj character</a>. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the American equivalent of Diagon Alley, since we can see a bouncer at the other side of the door. Plus, Tina wears the same dress as in <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2016/I%20had%20to%20look%20a%20second%20time%20to%20see%20Queenie%20and%20Jacob%20in%20the%20back">00:26</a> so I&#39;m gonna assume that this is a wizarding speakeasy.<br><br>[01:18] The people getting all the attention are Henry Shaw (with the tophat) and his son, Henry Shaw, Jr. Think of them basically as the Malfoys but No-Maj Malfoys. On one side of the crowd there are Shaw Senior&#39;s political posters (he&#39;s a Senator) and on the other side we&#39;ve got a banner of NSPS - New Salem Philantropic Society - or, the 1920&#39;s Witch Hunters.<br><br>[01:20] We get a brief glimpse of <a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/5/5c/FB-TRL2-11.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160411021728">Shaw, Sr.&#39;s banquet</a>, and Jacon&#39;s first encounter with Magic.<br><br>[01:24] Something&#39;s going down during Shaw, Sr.&#39;s banquet.<br><br>[01:25] This is <a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/7/7a/FB-TRL2-13.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160411021727">Modesty</a>. The summary present her as a &quot;haunted young girl&quot; with &quot;an ability to see deep into people&quot;. I&#39;m getting some serious Luna Lovegood vibes from her.<br><br>[01:27] Tina and Newt escaping from somewhere (maybe MACUSA), and Newt releases one of his creatures? I have no idea what this may be. My first suggestion was an Augurey, but now I have no clue. <br><br>[01:30] One of Newt&#39;s beasts definitely attacked Shaw, Sr.&#39;s banquet.<br><br>[01:31] We see people rushing out of a speakeasy, while other Apparate inside; most likely this is a police raid done by Aurors. <s>Now the stone arches made me think that Newt and Tina may be escaping the Aurors from that speakeasy</s> Nah, she&#39;s not wearing that sparkly black dress.<br><br>[01:32] This is <a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/3/30/FB-TRL2-16.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160411021726">Percival Graves</a>, an Auror and a right-hand man to <s>Her Dictatorship</s> President Picquery. I think he is the one talking to Newt at the beginning of the trailer.<br><br>[01:33] And adorable shot of possibly a <a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/c/c3/FB-TRL2-17.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160411021726">Niffler</a> doing a butt slide while holding onto somebody&#39;s purse.<br><br>[01:36] Newt and Tina running again from either the Aurors or wizard gangsters.<br><br>[01:40] Voice confirmation that it is Graves talking to Newt at the beginning. Also, &quot;that thing&quot; implies that in Newt&#39;s suitcase there was one pretty big and nasty beast that escaped (probably the one that crashed Shaw, Sr.&#39;s banquet). Apparently, there&#39;s going to be a Sasquatch present in the movie, so my best bet is that that&#39;s our most dangerous escapee.<br><br>In the final shot we see Newt going into his TARDIS-like suitcase, and beckons Jacob to follow him... Newt is a Time Lord confirmed.<br><br>And yeah, that&#39;s my view. I&#39;m sure I must&#39;ve missed something so go ahead and add your thoughts.</p>

            <p>All of these were typos that happened when I wrote bits of this thing from my phone. Sorry! <sup><sup>;</sup></sup> And as for your question, see my response below - the tl;dr version is that Chaos in the Heroes of Olympus series is canonically a soul-destroying void, so my guess was that Lord Chaos was a bit from the Kid Icarus continuum instead.</p>

            <p>This is very compelling. It&#39;s also very clear; I enjoyed reading it despite not having read any of your other stories about these characters (although I didn&#39;t quite follow what exactly had happened between Cupid and Rashida, I got the general idea and liked reading about them working it out).<br><br>There are only two things which confused me. On page 24 one of Liliana&#39;s charges is, &quot;creating bit a character who contributes nothing to the plot.&quot; Is this a typo? What&#39;s it supposed to read?<br><br>The Tempura Wizard seemed completely random to me. Was it the result of a typo in the badfic? Is it an aspect of the Kid Icarus universe? (I&#39;m only familiar with PJO.) Was the portal supposed to be to a different universe? Or did you make it up because you thought it was funny? It was funny; I&#39;m just a bit confused.</p>

            <p>...seeing as work <s>and SMITE</s> has been taking up most of my time. <sup><sup>;<br><br>The</sup></sup> bit character was supposed to be Lord Chaos... I assumed it was a bit character because Chaos himself doesn&#39;t appear as a character in the PJO series (there, he&#39;s a great void, as well as the first primordial deity).<br><br>And as eatpraylove said, the Tempura Wizard is an enemy from <i>Kid Icarus: Uprising</i> that turns you to tempura and eats you, and since Liliana chose to stay in Skyworld in the end of the actual fic, it was only fitting to feed her to one.</p>
