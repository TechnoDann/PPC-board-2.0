Knowledge of either Fullmetal Alchemist, the Brotherhood version, or Alcatraz Smedry might be useful, but I think it makes at least some sense without it.

            <p>I&#39;m at the moment interested in the abhorsen-verse, and am halfway through the Septimus Heap books. I love the Secrets of the immortal Nicholas Flamel series, and have been meaning to read up on Spooks Apprentice. I don&#39;t know if this counts, but I like Dwarf Fortress succesion games. I really can&#39;t list the agents I&#39;ve read in entirety, but I&#39;ve read most if the new stuff.</p>

            <p>I recently noticed that the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Beta_Reader_Directory">PPC Beta Reader Directory</a> is very out of date. Since beta reading is a fairly important part of the PPC, I would like to propose purging the directory of non-active members and setting up some guidelines for the page to keep it clean in the future. My thoughts:<br><br>— Similar to the Claimed Badfic page, the Directory page should be cleaned up on a regular basis. All posted betas who have not been active in some way over the past year should be removed.<br><br>— Beta listings should include fandoms in which the beta is knowledgeable, along with areas of speciality (SPaG, Britpicking, dialogue, etc.)<br><br>— People should be responsible for keeping their listings up to date with new fandoms and the like.<br><br>Once the cleanup is complete, I also think it would be a good idea to post a permalink to the Directory at the top of the Board. That way, people can check there for a specialized beta first rather than immediately post an open call for betas. <br><br>This is a valuable resource that I feel is underused. If anyone else has any other suggestions, or would like to comment on what I&#39;ve proposed, please feel free to respond.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s 8:22 PM PST, on the evening of July 5th, 2016 when I started writing this message. I&#39;m on the verge of hyperventilating and possibly shaking.<br><br>I&#39;ve spent four hours on the Plants vs. Zombies wiki, where users are currently engaged in a very tense issue right now. One that could potentially kill someone if it doesn&#39;t work out in our favor.<br><br><i>Because we&#39;re dealing with a suicidal moderator who&#39;s dug himself so deep a hole we literally cannot get to him.</i><br><br>Seriously. We&#39;ve tried all viable forms of anti-suicide advice (before referring to the resources) and it hasn&#39;t worked. Every time, he goes back to the same thing, the root cause of the situation: a mere block after he snapped for a bit and ranted at another user for talking behind his back, and continues to fight with the user and openly talks about killing himself. (From analyzing his messages, I can tell he&#39;s dangerously close to accomplishing this. He&#39;s within 100 paces of any potentially lethal object like a meat cleaver right now.) And every time I tell him how much I care about him and how I want to wish away the person causing his trauma as much as he does, it&#39;s almost as if he ignores potentially vital words of caring, by not responding...<br><br>I&#39;m seriously considering referring him to /r/SuicideWatch. It&#39;s simply the last thing we can do now that everything has proven so hopeless.<br><br>I just want this to end peacefully. It&#39;s starting to weigh me down more than I expected. I&#39;m so scared...<br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve decided to pull out from this situation while the wiki staff can assess the situation and perform the actions necessary to facilitate a recovery for this individual, as the root cause of the problem is a person who I swear had the charisma of a Fallout character before yesterday, as opposed to straight-up depression (the perpetrator is a discussion mod who happens to also be a repeat offender and is currently beating his psyche in without any sense of common self-restraint.)<br><br>I&#39;m still holding onto the plan of making an /r/SuicideWatch post, so that&#39;s still there.</p>

            <p>All notable members of the wiki community (comparable to how quite a few agents are more well-known than others) are currently pitching in to help, and they&#39;re all staff and admins. Unfortunately, we&#39;re not getting anywhere, likely because:<br><br>a) No one&#39;s actually taking action,<br>b) Our person of interest (i.e the one that&#39;s been bullying the victim) is going to be incredibly difficult to deal with or even reason with. How do you talk to a person who can&#39;t restrain themselves from talking to their victim despite being dumped wall after wall of text about the grim circumstances, and only truly feeling sorry after the damage has been done, anyway?</p>

I know it&#39;s tough. But you are in control of <i>your own actions, and no one else&#39;s</i>. You can neither stop him from hurting himself, not enable/force him to do so.

            <p>Given, and all.<br><br>Honestly, I&#39;m not sure I would have made the same answer when you first put it up. I was still pretty caught up in the whole thing. And, to be honest, if I start thinking about everything that happened it still gets me fairly emotional. But I&#39;ve done a lot of thinking fairly recently about discourse, and grudges, and emotional reactions. <br><br>Essentially I recently watched an argument about semantics degenerate into highschool-level bullying. Which made me quite irritated, because I think changing over to a discourse of kindness, rather than a holier-than-thou point system, is the only way to change things.<br><br>And then I realized I&#39;ve been carrying on a highschool-level feud for a few years now, and felt like kind of an idiot.<br><br>I don&#39;t think I can jump straight back to being close friends, but I certainly think gnashing my teeth in the direction of everyone I&#39;ve ever had a serious argument with is a good idea.<br><br>All of which is to say, essentially - I&#39;m sorry. I was treating you badly, and you deserved better than that, and I will try to do better.</p>

            <p>I notice the grass path out of the communal area is littered with craters - are these supposed to stay there as &quot;battle scarring&quot;?

            <p>Hmm... Let&#39;s see... It&#39;s My Turn actually is kind actually kind of personal for me, and makes me think of my own life. Fun image, no?<br><br>Burn My Dread makes me think of two characters, from the two different parts. The first part makes me think Yang Xiao Long, because it makes me think of her thrill-seeker personality and her place as a student. It doesn&#39;t seem like too far of a leap to see her fighting people in the night to try and get that feeling of being alive again. The second part makes me think of Kelsier, partially because of how I picture the Lord Ruler&#39;s citadel. It seems like it might evoke that image of a black tower devouring all light and sound around it. The feet are, of course, the movements of those backing him, and the mist doesn&#39;t hurt the image. And, of course, there are his ambitions, which are definitely good for the lyrics.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure I understand Ao-iconoclast. Hm... For now, let&#39;s add three songs.

            <p>The first one applies to some crazy AU version of either Quasimodo or Rapunzel. Both characters learn the truth about their abusive parental figure on or near a certain day they&#39;ve been waiting for, if not for their whole life, at least for a year, and proceed to break away from said figure.

            <p>Say is probably gonna make me look weird, but it kind of makes me think of the Lone Power, maybe because of High Wizardry.<br><br>Raised by Wolves, with its possible theme of former idealism, crushed by reality and turned into a heart of stone... Maybe Suzaku, from Code Geass. I can&#39;t remember it very well, because it was a long time ago and I cried through most of that show, but if I recall, he loses his shining idealism at one point and... well, it&#39;s not pretty.<br><br>It&#39;s a Sin... well, I might think of somebody, but I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;ve ever watched or read somebody that full of self-loathing. I can tell you, however, that the reverse is probably Frollo, or anybody who would fit with the song Hellfire, who believes themselves to be always right, and that fact is unquestionable, even if what they&#39;re doing is Evil up to Eleven.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m visiting my parents over the weekend, and I found that they had kept some things from when I was 4. I noticed a few sheets of paper bound with string, and it turned out to be a Pokйmon fanfic based on generation 1. Between the writing having faded and the horrible writing (in more than one sense) there&#39;s portion of it that I can&#39;t actually understand, but I do still remember the basic plot. The fic&#39;s title appears to be, in true generation 1 style, a sequence of glitched out characters (I can&#39;t read it and can&#39;t remember), starring a character whose name is a different sequence of glitch characters. She does not have a word of description in the entire fic.<br><br>There are 3 chapters to it. The first has Articuno land in front of the protagonist and tell her that &quot;three is bad stuff in the volcana&quot; [sic]. She then rides Articuno to a volcano and fight Moltres while still on Articuno&#39;s back. Using the help of her Bulbasaur, she captures Moltres. Chapter 2 is basically the same, but with Zapdos doing the unspecified bad stuff in a power plant. Chapter 3 is the epic conclusion, in which true culprit is revealed to be &#39;M (some friends had shown me the old man glitch, and I tried it out), so the protagonist flies on Articuno with the other two legendary birds following her to Cinnabar Island for the ultimate showdown! After a drawn out, 5 sentence fight, everything seems hopeless, but then the protagonist throws a master ball (presumably from the 6th slot in her bag) and successfully catches the glitch. &quot;THE END&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;m probably not going to be posting it online because it would be hard to replicate some of the more unusual writing errors on the paper, and because I do not want to spawn a mini-MissingNo. horde. I do still find it funny that I actually found this fic, and that I was able to write a 3 chapter suefic at age 4. It&#39;s also a humorous contrast to some of my writing from high school, which contained prose that was both beige and urple at the same time and stretched English grammar as far as possible without breaking it. It&#39;s fun to take a trip down memory lane occasionally.</p>

            <p>I bloody loved Captain Underpants when I was smaller. <br>One day, I decided: &#39;Aw, mate, I can bloody do that. Dav Pikley&#39;s nothing on me, he can&#39;t even spell his first name!&#39;* <br><br>It was some nonsense involving the two main characters, Jim and Jon, (both of whom looked and acted suspiciously similarly to the two main characters from Captain Underpants) becoming spies. <br>I originally killed one of their dads off to toss them into spyhood, but later decided to make it a simple kidnapping. <br>Can&#39;t remember if I ever drew his corpse, or anything like that, but, by God, I hope I did, because that&#39;s comedy gold, right there. <br>They followed the perpetrator of the kidnapping/murder, snuck through some back-alley, and never continued their journey, because I gave up. Never wrote again until I was a teenager. <br>Poor buggers are probably still shivering in those streets to this day. <br><br>Good Lord, though.

            <p>Mini-talking toilet? I guess we don&#39;t get to name them until someone missions a fic from one of his books, and I can&#39;t imagine anyone wanting to do that -- his are continua where weapons involving boogers don&#39;t break canon. (The Ricky Ricotta series wasn&#39;t so dangerous/gross, but did anyone like those?)</p>

            <p>I remember that! I was in Grade 3 when I read The Plight of The Purple Potty People. I had to wait until I graduated to read the next instalment. To be honest, I liked the ones where everything would go back to status quo in the end more. When I was four, I was in China, drawing Thomas The Tank Engine characters. I ended up getting them published in a magazine.</p>

            <p>Especially when there&#39;s up to three of the same person existing at the same time, you get moments where you have Tippy Tinkeltrousers, Slightly Younger Tippy, and Slightly Slightly Younger Tippy. I don&#39;t even want to talk about the fact that George and Harold are now actually SPOILERS that have SPOILERS so that they can go around SPOILERS without anyone asking questions. That is a far cry from two kids in a tree house, with a 3-D Hypno Ring.<br><br>On another note, I can&#39;t believe he lost the domain name of whenhamstersattack.org.

            <p>That badfic was... creepy. I don&#39;t know anything about Dollhouse, but there is clearly something wrong with this. And I think Suethors must read some counterfeits versions of the books for always picturing the canons as ducking psychos.<br><br>Your mission, however, was entertaining, and I&#39;d like to read more of your work. I also thought the concrit part was a ice touch. My principal nitpick would be about the way you handled the CADs readings. I guess I&#39;ll sound as an hypocrite because I only did this once, but for me, half of the fun with these things is finding new ways to describe OOC levels. And seeing them blow up, of course.</p>

            <p>Who wants to take care of this little critter?<br><br>(Get it? CRITter? Because betas provide conCRIT... I&#39;ll shut up now.)<br><br>ANYWAY, this mission was fun to read; I enjoyed it. However, it didn&#39;t convince me that the fic was as terrible as the agents thought it was. Based on the letter September wrote, it seemed like their main problem with the fic was the breaking of age-of-consent laws, which, yeah, was creepy, but keep in mind that <a href="http://statelaws.findlaw.com/california-law/california-prostitution-laws.html">prostitution is illegal in California</a>. So if the LA House is canonical (the agents seemed to act as if it was; I&#39;m not familiar with Dollhouse), then it&#39;s established that the pimps don&#39;t mind breaking laws, and depicting them doing so wouldn&#39;t count as a breach in canon. A better charge to focus on might have been how OOC the characters from both canons were. <br><br>Otherwise, this was pretty well-structured as a story, and I feel like I really got to know your agents. The moment when Kelly described the IO as &quot;watching&quot; made me laugh out loud. <br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>I immediately liked that you started this with a general impression of PPC HQ, especially the orc and elf talking. <br><br>But then, the first paragraphs are a bit disjointed. You may want to work on your transitions, like writing &quot;Amidst this, Kelly and September walked back to their RC ...&quot;, then what they had for lunch, and then having them hear the console beep when they arrive at the RC.<br><br>Kelly appears to be the more experienced agent, mentoring September. It’s good to see this early in the story. Again, execution is a bit sloppy. &quot;She [Kelly] grabbed the mission bag ...&quot; and then &quot;September grabbed the mission bag&quot; is a bit too repetitive for my taste.<br><br>I became momentarily afraid of being infected with As Disease, although it’s not a bad case. Just watch for repetitions and remember that &quot;while&quot; may work just as well.<br><br>Also, since I actually looked into the badfic (I usually don’t), I noticed a problem that may be more prevalent then I’m aware: thoughtless use of standard mission elements. I’m quite sure that &quot;booming&quot; author notes were originally mocking the habit of setting them in <b>bold</b> type. Since the author notes look more decent here, there is no reason for them to boom. Mocking their length and wording might have been more appropriate.<br><br>Although your repeated mocking of the horizontal line is funny, I don’t actually see why you mock it. It’s the standard section divider / scene break marker, and much better than the weird dividers we often see. What else do you think should be there?<br><br>September is more knowledgeable about <i>Dollhouse</i> than Kelly, who may not know it at all. Again, it’s good to see this rather than being told.<br><br>Getting further into the mission, I ran into a personal problem. Apparently there wasn’t much <i>Harry Potter</i>, I don’t know anything about <i>The Dollhouse</i>, and I didn’t feel like reading the whole badfic to get more of what was going on. As far as I can tell, it’s a solid mission, but not over-exciting.<br><br><br>Technical Errors:<br><br>It took me three rereads of the sentence to realize that <i>Topher and Dr. Saunders did live in their House, but he chose to [?] for some reason and made Saunders phobic of everything so she would too</i> doesn’t actually miss a word or more, but refers to what was talked about in the previous paragraph: sleeping at work rather than live in their house. But that may be only me, and it may be justified by people just talking like this.<br><br>The <i>neuralizer</i> (two occurrences) and the <i>neurolyzer</i> are actually the &quot;neuralyzer&quot;, and the agents &quot;neuralyzed&quot; (not <i>neuralized</i>, two occurrences) the canon characters.<br><br>Titles, like <i>Harry Potter</i> or <i>The Dollhouse</i>, should always be italicized, even in dialogue (although one might wonder how the agents pronounce the italics).<br><br><br><i>Harry Potter</i> canon (I don’t remember whether you might know this and just pretend that your agents don’t):<br><br>Hermione had a handbag that is bigger on the inside, containing a tent and lots of books and other stuff. Harry having a similar pouch to wear around the neck may be plausible, but having it look like a trunk, calling it a miniature trunk and wearing that around the neck sounds ridiculous. <br><br>A great concentration of magical energy, like at Hogwarts, where many wizards cast many spells every day, and lots of objects are enchanted, may render electric/electronic devices useless, while technology like clockworks or crossbows are not affected. Unlike in some other continua, the presence of a single witch who doesn’t even cast a spell shouldn’t mess with technology, especially when it is sufficiently undefined sci-fi technology that might not even use electricity. <br><br><br>I like that September tries to send concrit to the author. It may be a bit late in this case, but apparently she is still around updating other stories.<br> <br>HG</p>

            <p>OK, yes I didn&#39;t beta the completed mission, but some kind of recognition for my comments and help when this was in what you called an &#39;alpha state&#39; would have been nice. <br><br>That being said I was also under the impression that when the mission was finished you wanted me to beta it as well, obviously I was either mistaken in your intent, or something like that. I&#39;m not able to constantly check a google document to see if changes have been made beyond what I&#39;ve suggested so I&#39;m sorry if it seemed like I wasn&#39;t interested in beta-ing it anymore, I was merely waiting for a comment or email to highlight that it was ready to be beta&#39;d further that never arrived.<br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>I would have gotten around to beta reading this mission as soon as I was able. Unfortunately, I&#39;m currently visiting family over the weekend, and seeing as I can&#39;t have access to a desktop computer for long periods of time I wouldn&#39;t have been able to do any beta reading until I return to DC tomorrow. That being said, I would have either gladly helped with the beta reading process earlier had Bram told me he would be posting as soon as he did, and if I couldn&#39;t do so for any reason he could&#39;ve at least waited for me to tell him as such. I know I&#39;ve made this mistake before in the past but Bram did the same thing in his first Permission attempt, and well, we all know what happened back then. The last thing I need is for this to become a recurring problem because I&#39;d rather not have a situation where things make me angry enough to say the wrong thing at the worst possible time.<br><br>I would still be willing to beta read Bram&#39;s next mission once I get access to my computer again, but I hope he&#39;d be willing to wait for the green light from me and tge otger betas when that happens. I have more than a few things to say about his work, for better or for worse, and I&#39;ll reserve my thoughts on this mission for a separate post later tonight if I can. As it stands, though, PPC missions need to be engaging above all else, and I feel that in that respect, Bram still has a way to go.</p>

Sorry. <sup><sup>;<br><br>I&#39;ll</sup></sup> definitely look into the Treasure Planet mission, seeing as I&#39;ve seen that movie several times when I was younger.

            <p>Right now it&#39;s July 2nd, 2016, at where I am. It&#39;s 01.15 AM when I type these words, and I am both in tears and shaking, so apologies if you spot a typo. It&#39;s never easy to start anything like this. And to some of you it may seem like we&#39;ve been down this road before... Because yes, we were, but this is the last time you hear from me for a <i>really</i> long time. I will try to phrase myself as clearly as possible, to avoid any sort of hidden meanings or to not make you guys assume my intentions, which is the worst thing ever.<br><br>I quit. No, I&#39;m not taking a hiatus, or taking a break, I actually QUIT the PPC. I see no point in staying. Every time I visit the Board, all people can do best is accuse and snap at one another. There are some old animosities looming around, which prevent people from working out their problems in a civilized way. And in the midst of all this am I - somebody who once again had been proven that he doesn&#39;t understand humans, and tries his bloody best to stay on everyone&#39;s good side. But apparently all I do is insult people, attack them and generally being the worst thing since Hitler.<br><br>When I came here, in April of last year, all I wanted is to be with people. That was my worst weakness - inability to maintain actual working relationships. I thought I could do that with people far away that I don&#39;t see face-to-face. I wanted to feel needed. For the first few months it worked, but then... one huge mistake led to another, and now I&#39;m here - far behind the starting point. And if I continue to stay here, I will fall even lower.<br><br>Today, once again I&#39;ve been proven that one mistake - albeit a big one, I&#39;ll admit - is enough. That no matter what I say or do, I will be treated like the worst type of garbage, without any chance for redemption. I would like to sincerely, with no ill will in mind, thank that person, for showing me how pointless my attempts to make friends were.<br><br>One thing I should make extremely clear - <b>I am not trying to play the victim, or look for culprits</b>. All that had happen was my fault. I did my fair share of bad things here. Most of them came from my - as somebody nicely put it - clinical inability to take the hint, or letting anything lie. I acknowledge that everything I talked about previously, started with ME saying something that sparked the whole problem.<br><br>Therefore I shall remove myself, before I spit venom at everything and everyone around. Hopefully I won&#39;t poison the next community I join. <br><br>I am not saying this is a definite goodbye... but I won&#39;t even be a lurker. I need to fix everything that is wrong with me. As they say, &quot;physician heal thyself&quot;.<br><br>To everyone I did wrong: If it&#39;s of any worth to you, I am sorry from the bottom of my heart.<br><br>To everyone I was going to co-write with: Forgive me.<br><br>To my Betas: Your job is done, and I thank you for all your hard work.<br><br>To everyone else: It was fun while it lasted.</p>

            <p>…but all this pitying praise for Matt has confused and angered me. Data is right. I&#39;ve seen evidence that he has been harassing at least one member of this community (who shall remain nameless, unless they wish to be named). He was told multiple times to stop, but continued to persist. I&#39;ve seen multiple chat logs to that effect. It&#39;s fairly damning.<br><br>And yet almost everything here is platitudes for Matt.<br><br>He says &quot;I am not trying to play the victim.&quot; And yet, his post is full of self-pitying statements like &quot;Hopefully I won&#39;t poison the next community I join&quot; and &quot;generally being the worst thing since Hitler.&quot; He says that he wants to assume responsibility. And yet, he uses low-key insults like &quot;I would like to […] thank that person, for showing me how pointless my attempts to make friends were&quot; to dig at the person HE was harassing.<br><br>Yes, not everyone has seen what I&#39;ve seen. And yes, my words by themselves are not evidence of wrongdoing. No doubt someone will blast me for engaging in the kind of arguments that Matt bemoans.

            <p>Since when has the board been nothing but harassment before? If I were in his place, I&#39;d at least do a fact check even under his conditions, because there&#39;s a reason MatPat of Game Theory coined the mnemonic &quot;ASSUME = ASS U ME.&quot; It basically means &quot;ASSUMING only makes an ASS out of U and ME.&quot; I get that we&#39;re all human and thus prone to violent outbursts, but when has the board ever devolved to the point that Matt came up with the idea to say that we&#39;re nothing <i>but</i> harassment and toxicity?<br><br>And yes. Passive aggression is the worst thing. to send yourself off on. Self-contradiction is also on the same level as passive-aggression.<br><br>Final word: <i>It is impossible for me to read his message in a voice that isn&#39;t HERO&#39;s rant after one of the most severe streaming drama incidents of 2015. If you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, just look <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m78EGWgvN0">here.</a> (Warning: Hour-long rant of playing the victim card combined with an inflated ego. At one point HERO breaks down into tears and begins mindlessly spouting BS about the Terraria community and its developers. That is the voice I am talking about.) And that is a very bad thing.</i><br><br>As a newbie, I can already tell that Matt&#39;s final words are something to be concerned about. You simply do not storm out of a community like <i>this.</i> Period.</p>

            <p>You sir, are a great person. Cheer up and don&#39;t let anything get to you. I personally found no form of you being the worst thing since Hitler, and would like to tell you that you are a much better man than him.<br><br>Your characters are excellent. William and VJ have that kind of chemistry that I hope will develop into my own characters, and I have been genuinely excited to read a Hip &amp; Hop story for a longest time. In fact, you are one of my favorite writers here.<br><br>I believe the biggest mistake you can do in this situation is leave, as there are so many people who will miss you and your writings.
