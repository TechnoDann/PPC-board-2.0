            <p>&quot;Admins make excellent janitors and terrible dictators&quot; - Wandering Critic<br><br>That&#39;s eight years ago, at this point (<i> Juliette plays the oldbie card!</i>), but the sentiment still holds true, imo. When we recovered the admin account, we realized the terrible powers it contained, and had a long discussion about how to preserve the creative-anarchist community we&#39;d built without it.<br><br>I can recall exactly one post which the Nameless Admin edited- someone, appearing under a new name and questioning the community and its structure (not unlike yourself!) used a fairly nasty slur in the process, and the Nameless Admin removed said slur and signed the change. That was it. The discussion continued.<br><br>And, to pose a question in return, how would this be different in a more conventionally moderated board? There would still be someone with the authority to do whatever they willed to posts and users, they would just display that authority on their sleeve rather than it being something that is only picked up when needed. Even if we built a forum without such a role, someone would still have the database login- and then you&#39;ve traded an adminity that can be given to anyone to one that can only be used by the technologically adept.<br><br>For years and years, we had a community that was both incredibly vibrant and also resistant to trolls by its very nature. And you know what? I think we still do. All we need the Nameless Admin for is janitorial work.</p>

            <p>It deletes posts by users who have been banned and refuse to stick to the ban voluntarily. That includes the Tor-using troll, among others.

            <p>Why does everyone continue to assume Orwell is a moniker, despite me repeatedly saying otherwise? My first name literally is Orwell. My mother was a fan of George Orwell, but felt that George was too common of a name. I will happily give out my full name if it will put you at ease.</p>

            <p>Paper: <a href="http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.B36120">here</a><br><br>Layman&#39;s terms article: <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/it-s-official-nasa-s-peer-reviewed-em-drive-paper-has-finally-been-published">here</a> (among others)<br><br>So: this is the EM drive. It&#39;s basically a copper cone you fire microwaves into, and it generates thrust, around ten times what you can get from a solar sail. In order to do that, it has to break a couple of laws of physics - like Newton&#39;s third law.<br><br>When first announced, it was widely assumed to be a hoax, but now a NASA team operating out of Houston say they&#39;ve replicated the result, and that the thrust produced doesn&#39;t seem to come from any of the usual sources.<br><br>Their hypothesis for how it works involves overturning the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics - in other words, goodbye Schrodinger&#39;s Cat. The alternative is Pilot Wave Theory, which (very simply) says that particles have actual locations, but are carried along by undetectable waves. It&#39;s quite an appealing theory - it perfectly replicates the standard experiments, like the double slit experiment - but hasn&#39;t really been taken up before.<br><br>I&#39;m having difficulty understanding how pilot waves lead to EM drive; it looks like NASA are suggesting the &#39;waves&#39; act on the quantum vacuum - meaning that &#39;vacuum&#39; has an energy all of its own, and isn&#39;t properly &#39;empty&#39; - meaning the drive moves one way, the waves propagate the other, and momentum is preserved. Not really sure, like I said, but they insist it works, and works exactly the same in vacuum and atmosphere, to boot.<br><br>Let me be clear: if the EM drive <i>does</i> work, it&#39;s simultaneously a reactionless drive (no exhaust), a torch-drive (can be run continuously, making it perfect for least-time courses across space), and a stardrive (it can take you up to appreciable fractions of lightspeed with no input other than electricity). It would fundamentally alter our relationship with space, and (not incidentally) render about half of science fiction as laughably obsolete as Asimov&#39;s slide-rules.<br><br>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s real. I know, it&#39;s NASA, but this would overturn too much too quickly and too simply. I think they&#39;ll find some obvious explanation, just like the superluminal neutrinos a few years back. It will suck, but I expect it.<br><br>But I&#39;m not going to make <a href="https://xkcd.com/955/">Randall&#39;s Wager</a>. I&#39;m going to be an optimist; I&#39;m going to bet you guys the opposite. Here we go:<br><br>At some point in the near future, someone (NASA? China? The inventor?) will <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/the-impossible-em-drive-is-about-to-be-tested-in-space">put an EM drive in space</a>. I bet anyone who chooses to take me up on it that the drive <b>will generate thrust in orbit</b>, and that it <b>will not be shown to do so in a manner we already knew about</b>. If I&#39;m wrong (ie, if the EM drive doesn&#39;t work in space), I will give anyone who takes the bet either a short (less than 500 word) story or a picture of their choice. If you take the bet, then you need to say what you&#39;re wagering if <i>you&#39;re</i> wrong and it <i>does</i> work.<br><br>Any takers?<br><br>hS<br><br>(You can also jump in on my side of the bet. I think that means that everyone on the losing side has to give their wager to everyone on the winning side.)</p>

Of course, getting into the shallow end&#39;s easy- there are already private space flights. We just need a shuttle going to some kind of space dock for this glorious little microwave to sail out into the vacuum. If this works, that is FANTASTIC NEWS, and I will live my life in squalor saving up to go, if it means I get to see that vast empty (suck it up, Casimir) sea filled with shining stars, barren planets, and cottony nebulae!!! <br><br>And, fanboying aside, is no one gonna mention the theory all of this is based on? This fundamentally changes the way I understand physics! Particles could all be sailing on some ethereal sea, caught adrift in an invisible wind, and I hadn&#39;t the slightest clue!!! This is beautiful. <br><br>I truly hope this works as well as we think it does. At the moment, I&#39;m far too happy people are willing to practically consider such a ridiculous idea (space wind!:D)as the means of propelling mankind across the solar system, to make that bet. <br><br>~~Aegis, who is geeking out over the fact that his laptop is running off the same stuff that could be powering a star drive if this ends up proven 100% </p>

            <p>Going over your points in order:<br><br>a) Yes it is. Even low thrust, if run constantly, adds up to massive velocity. It just means you start gradually.<br><br>b) The Eagleworks test /is/ a reproduction. It hasn&#39;t been done a third time, no.<br><br>c) It works in 10<sup>-6</sup> torr vacuum, which is a good start. Orbit is the next big step.<br><br>d) Never said it was. But it can hit arbitrarily large speeds, which means it can go relativistic. That means that by its internal clocks, every star is essentially the same distance away.<br><br>e) No, it relies on the fact that it (seems to) work. The precise physics behind it may be wildly wrong, but if it works, then /some/ model will be found to explain it. Demonstrable effect trumps unlikely cause.<br><br>f) Yep. Which is why I said from the start that it probably won&#39;t work. But NASA think it&#39;s promising enough to push out a peer-reviewed paper...<br><br>g) Well, America managed the moon. And the biggest issue with long trips is the need to boost all that fuel into orbit, which this does away with. Yes, there&#39;s more to it - there always is - but it&#39;s certainly feasible.<br><br>h) Take the bet. Make Randall&#39;s Wager. If you&#39;re right, you get a thing. If you&#39;re wrong, you get a torchdrive. Either way, you win.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It really doesn&#39;t need all that much power. A small power source can sustain it— and a nuclear battery certainly fits the bill.<br><br>Also, a conventional nuclear reactor is a massive affair. It generates electricity by heating steam and shoving it through turbines— such a system in space is going to be an unwieldy affair, needing water and air and plumbing and maintenance to work properly. Also, we&#39;ve never needed to build one in space before, so a design would have to compensate for the lack of gravity. All in all, a rather challenging power solution, yes.</p>

            <p>... at 100W (low-end for an RTG), it looks like an EM drive could push a six-tonne Apollo command module at, uh... 15 nanometers per second squared. That works out to just about 0.5 meters per year squared. We, um, might need a few of them. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Yes, until something goes wrong at the launch and you scatter all that wonderful power source material across the atmosphere. Granted, as spacecraft don&#39;t carry <i>that</i> much radioactive material, it won&#39;t necessarily be too bad, provided we don&#39;t use it as apower source to actually leave earth&#39;s gravity behind (yes, that does sound horribly unphysic-y, but I hope you understand what I mean). Still, the bad publicity would result in cut fundings, which is bad.</p>

            <p>...the Voyager probes, Cassini, and New Horizons all carry RTGs? Besides, Pu-238&#39;s half-life is a mere 87 years compared to a nuclear weapon&#39;s 24000+. By comparison, it&#39;s clean as can be. Besides, not much else can generate heat or electricity in deep space. <br><br>And, as hS pointed it out, an Emdrive will not replace a chemical rocket to escape Earth&#39;s gravitational potential well. The spacecraft hitches a ride on, say, an Arianne or a Soyuz, deploys in space, and uses its RTG to power the Emdrive. </p>

            <p>The downside of this tech - even if it works precisely as advertised and can be dramatically scaled up - is that it&#39;s not a <i>launch</i> engine. Once you&#39;re <i>in</i> orbit, you can go anywhere you want with even a weak engine - it&#39;s just a matter of acceleration time. But to <i>get</i> to orbit, you need to make at least one gravity of thrust (ie, you need to counter the gravitational pull of the Earth).

            <p>Way too good. Suspiciously so. <br><br>I bet my socks that research teams worldwide are scrambling to replicate these results and verify the Eagleworks paper. There are multiple sources or error for this experiment and every single one of them can spell doom for the conclusion of this article-- but I want to be proven wrong. <br><br>This is uncharted territory. Should the EM drive be proven to work, the entire solar system is ours for the taking.

            <p>I&#39;ve got 2 I&#39;ve been working on and I was wondering if people would be interested in either. They are:<br><br>The first is a dungeon crawler-esque RP involving dice where you create characters and try to get from one side of the dungeon to the other (preferably without dying). I do still need to decide on the amount of health all the NPC&#39;s will have, but besides that this is finished.<br><br>The second is a New Region Pokemon RP using ORAS mechanics and Pokemon. This one is still a bit more of a WIP due to me losing the memory stick with most of the files on them and not having a back up, I need to finish describing the towns, places of interests and routes, and then fill said routes with Pokemon and polish up some of the Gym teams (all important trainer battles will be done on Showdown, the rest can be RPed by whoever is involved in them). <br><br>Comment if you&#39;re interested or want to know more or anything. If you are interested in both of them please note due to time constraints I will only be able to run one at a time. <br><br>Storme Hawk<br></p>

            <p>So, SWATCOTHA (the dungeon crawler-esque RP) is now finished, I completed the health and rejigged some of the mechanics last night. It is now ready to go whenever you want it to. <br><br>Toktu (the Pokemon RP) now has Pokemon inhabiting its routes (with around 500 Pokemon available from the first 6 Gens), however this is still a bit on the back-burner seeing as more people seem to like SWATCOTHA (which I&#39;m starting to regret giving such a long name to that even its acronym is still fairly long).<br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>Or at least, lots of them are. Let&#39;s see... just for giggles, I might do Vanillite, but in all honesty, not my fave.

            <p>Trade Evolutions can be done one of two ways, 1) you trade with someone in the RP or 2) you complete 2 gyms and then you&#39;re Pokemon can evolve, option 2 is also used for Pokemon that evolve with specific items (although the trainer has to have the item) and Pokemon who evolve via happiness. <br>Overall the amount of gym badges you have effects both the moves your Pokemon can know and whether they can evolve or not seeing as levels are really icky and complicated to do in a RP. <br><br>Also as a general FYI, unless there are more than 18 people interested I was only going to have one Starter Pokemon of each &#39;type&#39; (so it&#39;d be a race between you and Iximaz to see who got Solosis), although with the rule of if you didn&#39;t like the Pokemon for one type you could replace it so long as 1) it has two evolutions and 2) it didn&#39;t have a Mega evolution. So say you wanted a different Grass starter instead of Chikorita, you could have a Snivy, but not a Treecko. And in terms of the type of each starter, the list is in type alphabetical order (so Scatterbug is the Bug starter, Sandile is the Dark starter all the way through to Totodile being the Water starter), I tried to make it that each starter was purely the type it represents but I couldn&#39;t do it all with all the types.<br><br>I will also say that Mega Evolutions in general are a plot point and probably not going to be available until the &#39;evil team&#39; of the region are defeated (assuming someone defeats them), so don&#39;t plan on necessarily having them available.<br><br>Hope that helps<br><br>Storme Hawk  </p>

            <p>And it&#39;s pretty much set in a custom universe specifically created for the RP.<br><br>However, Characters will be able to choose from one of six races: Centaur, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Half-Orc and Lizardmen. Each race has three inherent abilities unique to that race and each character can pick two of them. For example, the Lizardmen have the Dry Skin, Tough Scales and Natural Hunter abilities. Dry Skin allows them to heal themselves in water at the cost of taking double damage from fire, Tough Scales gives a natural bonus to armour and Natural Hunter allows them to take one of the Hunter class abilities for free.<br> <br>There are then 9 classes: Fighter, Barbarian, Knight, Hunter, Thief, Rogue, Hedge Mage, Wizard and Sorceror. Each class has two abilities that a character can pick one of. For example the Hunter has the Bowman and Trapmaster abilities. Bowman makes the character superior at range whilst slightly inferior in close combat, whilst the Trapmaster can use whatever is on hand to create a trap that can be lethal to anything that passes through it (including other characters who forget where the trap is) but is slightly worse off when it comes to actually fighting. Both of the Hunter&#39;s abilities limit what type of armour they can wear to either Light armour or Clothing, which gives less protection than, say Plate armour but gives the character more maneuverability, which may be useful if you&#39;re trying to be acrobatic or dodge something. <br><br>I wanted to make the RP as open-ended as possible so if others want to either do another dungeon crawl with their characters or create a new adventure or whatever, they could. I guess the story for this one could be: <br>&#39;A group of (relatively) new adventurers have decided to band together and defeat Parnax, an ancient Dragon said to be hoarding a vast array of treasures that could make them very rich and famous. However, Parnax&#39;s lair is at the bottom of the treacherous Bore-hole, and the only safe way down on foot involves traversing through multiple chambers and caverns that various monsters now call their home.&#39;<br><br>Storme Hawk<br>Who had way too much fun creating a backstory for the RP. <br><br>P.S If you want to come up with new ideas for Races/Classes let me know and I can give you a list of all the existing one&#39;s and their abilities so they don&#39;t clash, and yes there are no humans atm, I&#39;m not sure if I want it to stay that way or not.  </p>

It can also be used as a catch-all modifier for anything that could arise in the RP, if trying to do the impossible, expect a large negative circumstance modifier. A few Circumstance modifiers are permanent whilst the majority will be active for a set number of turns, or until something else happens (in the example above the circumstance negative modifier persists until the character either falls in the pit (they&#39;re then not fighting) or until they get out of the pit (no longer dangling over the edge)).<br><br>Inj or Injury. Only a negative modifier, Injuries happen in the same kind of way they do IRL. Injuries will wear off after a while to mimic your characters either healing or just getting used to the pain. They can also be healed by certain items, Clerics and potentially by friendly NPC&#39;s. Injuries also cover poisons and the like.<br><br>Arm or Armour. How much protection you are wearing. There are four types of armour in the RP, Clothing which can naturally confer a +1 bonus max. Light Armour which can naturally confer a +3 bonus max. Mail Armour can naturally confer a +5 bonus max. Heavy Armour can naturally confer a +7 bonus max and Plate Armour can naturally confer a +9 bonus max. Although Class and Race powers can improve these bonuses above their normal maximum. If you pick two different class powers through the use of the Natural Class Race power, then the lowest armour type is the one you are able to equip. Shields will also give an Armour bonus, and can be wielded by any class, although if you have a Shield you can&#39;t wield a two handed weapon.<br><br>Dam or Damage. The amount of bonus damage you do with a weapon, all weapons will have a set damage bonus they will give you which can then be increased or decreased by your characters powers, and any enchanting or improving of the weapons you may do. Shields can also turn their armor bonus into a damage bonus if you try bash with them. Weapons are either one handed or two handed (you will be told which).  </p>

            <p>If it&#39;s OK, I&#39;ll definitely take the Tako, I&#39;ll probably edit the descriptions slightly, but that&#39;s fine. <br><br>The Mongrelfolk are a bit of a mixed bag, the 1D6 extra damage when using 1 handed weapons could be very OP, especially if they dual-wield. Also Magic Fear will be, for the majority of the RP an inferior version of both the Half-Orc&#39;s Tough Hide and the Lizardmen&#39;s Tough Scales. I think they would need to be redone before they&#39;d fit into this RP. So no to them.<br><br>Shardmind I&#39;m fine with and will be including them as is. <br><br>The Psion, I&#39;m happy with but for three words. I&#39;m probably going to include them but change the first sentence of Fate Seer to &quot;-1 Cir for all enemies in the same room as you, unless they are in combat.&quot; I will also say that both classes of Psion can only wear clothing. <br><br>The Landsknecht isn&#39;t going to work, probably. I&#39;m not planning on having gunpowder weaponry in this so that&#39;s Shot out. Pike is similarly out as the +2 damage for every ally with a shield in the room could get OP quickly. <br><br>The Brawler is a nice idea, that I&#39;m going to tone down a little bit before putting in. I&#39;m going to remove the +4 Damage bonus from Slugger, and limit him to wearing not being able to wear Mail armour or better. For the Dirty Fighter I think the +3 Cir bonus when going into close combat is a bit too much and I&#39;m removing it, but otherwise that&#39;s fine. The Dirty Fighter will not be able to wear Heavy Armour or better.    </p>

It can&#39;t be given to a fully-evolved Pokémon, but when equipped, the holder&#39;s attacks deal double damage to, and have 30% increased accuracy when targeting, fully-evolved Pokémon. Fomatis&#39; stats might be, er, not brilliant, but with this item it can deal considerable damage. Get a Modest one with the ability Contrary and give it EVs in Special Attack and HP, give it Choice Specs, and run Leaf Storm, Giga Drain, Weather Ball, and Protect. Run it in sunlight and you should be pretty much golden, but remember: the important thing is to have fun. =]</p>

            <p>There have been two records of Force-adept Wookies, both users of the Light Side, one canonical and one in the now uncanon EU: Gungee, a youngling who got his lightsaber after having his patience tested, and an adult Wookie Jedi Master who was so skilled that he got on the Jedi High Council.<br><br>But anyway, I can&#39;t decide if it&#39;s OP or not. There has not been an evil Force-using Wookie before. It could be Sueish, given their strength and long lives, combined with Force powers that would make him an unstoppable powerhouse in more ways than one. But at the same time, flaws and limitations might be creatable. It&#39;s a tricky situation...</p>

            <p>I mean if it is basically Hanharr (KotOR2) with Lightsabers (which was actually the original plan) then it could work.  But keep in mind Lucas himself was the one who wanted to reign in the Wookie Jedi.  It could be doable though.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think Jedi - or Sith, particularly (are Dark Jedi a thing in the Disneyverse?) - are particularly prone to worrying about physical strength.

May I suggest simply keeping an eye on them? Believe me, I am. (And what&#39;s more Big Brother-ish than that, amirite?) The worst-case scenario is that they disappoint us down the line, at which point they&#39;ll most likely get banned pretty darn quick.

            <p>Hello and welcome to the RP. Below you'll find various posts each containing different bits of the RP, for example the Class and Race lists, the Dice mechanics etc. as well as a General/Q&amp;A post and an example post. Yes this is filler to hold it all together, no I don't care if this isn't how things are normally done. </p>

<p>So once again welcome to the RP. Be inquisitive, be proper and have a plan to kill everyone you meet.</p>

            <p>Virro: (10) Looking through the scrolls in the chest, you find a battered old scroll that, despite its state, absolutely reeks of necromantic power (if such a thing could smell that is). Picking it up, you read it (silently of course, you don't want to accidentally do something with it whilst you're not prepared), and you realise you have stumbled across an artifact long thought a myth by most necromancers. The Scroll of Black Death, is an artifact with a mind of its own, only letting its finder have a certain number of uses of it before it disappears to be found by the next necromantic prodigy. You instinctively know you have 7 uses of this scroll before it leaves your hands forever, an you can use these uses to either: Raise a loyal Zombie Lord from a dead corpse in the same room as you, Deal 1D20 damage to every living thing in a room other than yourself, and heal undead and yourself by the same amount, Or Control every undead creature in the room and keep them under your command indefinitely. </p>

<p>Evard: ()</p>

<p>Uriel: (7) You manage to work out that there are absolutely zero secret passages or hidden traps of any kind in this room at all. You also manage to sneak a quick look at the map  <a href="https://s7.postimg.org/ymlalaky3/SWATCOTHA_full_map.png">https://s7.postimg.org/ymlalaky3/SWATCOTHA_full_map.png</a></p>

<p>Keegra: (9) You find some bracers that have the same styling as your belt. Sure enough they are Bracers of Monk Training and give you a bonus to fighting unarmed. </p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (11) You find what would look to most like a simple robe, however you are able to see through the illusion and know it is a Robe of the Elements, a rare set of Cleric robes given to exceptional Shardmind Clerics. Praying your Gods won't mind you wearing it, you put it on, and feeling no damnation coming for you, you think they do not mind. Now you are not worried about your Gods, you feel the benefits of the Robe. Besides being padded enough to provide some armour, it also gives you four Blessings that are always effective, Blessings of the Earth gives you the ability to withstand blow you simply could not before, Blessings of the Air gives you acrobatic skills beyond what you have ever learnt, Blessings of the Flame gives your weapons an extra touch of damage in combat, and Blessings of the Water makes you resistant to other Elemental attacks. </p>

<p>Kali: ()</p>

<p>Yeleni: ()</p>

<p>Priya: ()</p>

<p>Bellas: (10) You find a nice composite longbow on one of the weapon racks, whilst your short bow is currently better, it is enchanted whereas this one is not and you feel it would be better once the enchantments are laid upon it. In addition, this longbow feels like it would be better at piercing armour than normal bows. Gained Composite Longbow (+4, Ignores half of targets Armour in combat)</p>

<p>Centorea: (5) You fail to find any armour on the weapon racks unsurprisingly, however you do find a semi-decent Axe, which if not for use in combat could always be used to break down any light obstacles in your way. Gained Axe (+2)</p>

<p>Davug: (10) You find a nice looking set of Heavy Armour that you quickly put on. Gained Banded Armour (Heavy, +5 Arm)</p>

<p>Shaban: () You wait in the Room 4 for Virro's next orders</p>

<p>Room 5: There are five male warriors standing a little bit back from the door in a line. The outer two are Lizardmen, whilst the other three are all dwarves The dwarves are clad in plate mail, and wield a shield and an axe each, the two Lizardmen are wearing some kind of Heavy Armour and are wielding Greatswords. Each of the Lizardmen are also holding the collars of a Guard Dog and seem ready to release them at a moments notice. Further back there is a female elf wearing Leather armour, wielding a Longbow with a full quiver of arrows on her back, Next to her is a female Centaur wearing Mail Armour with some Javelins strapped to her back. Finally, almost out of sight is a small Kobold in Light armour with a sling. The room itself is another long rectangle, although this one is thinner than room 4. There do not appear to be any other doors in this room, although a lone painting seems to stand out almost at the far end of the North Wall and two lighter shades of stone are almost opposite each other on the North and South Walls about a third of the way down. The rest of the room looks well used, a temporary smithy/kitchen seems to have been set up alongside some benches and desks with things going on on them and a small sleeping area. Noticing you are not Undead, the Warriors seem to relax slightly, and bid you welcome to, as they call it, "The Last Bastion."</p>

<p>Room 6: The room is relatively small, probably the smallest room you've been in so far, although the contents of the room may make it feel smaller than it actually is. In one of the corners there is a massive amount of weaponry, in another a massive collection of armours, a third has rings, belts and amulets galore, whilst the fourth corner holds a single chest. Directly opposite you is a map that looks different to the ones you have seen previously. The door that lead into this room has mysteriously disappeared, and in front of the now vacant doorway is a small rectangular welcome mat. This must be one of the treasure rooms scattered around the dungeon that you have heard about.</p>

<p>Rudig: () Arms full on new armour you take it back to The Last Bastion to begin Improving and fixing so that it'll fit who it needs to.</p>

<p>Gikur: () With Rudig's arms full of armour you go and search through the weapons in case anything is better than what you, and the rest of The Last Bastion currently have.</p>

<p>Urouk: () You stand guard, looking out of the known entrance to The Last Bastion.</p>

<p>Trijask: () You continue to guard the door to The Last Bastion and watch for enemies to kill.</p>

<p>Gantuxuz: () You stand in room 6 watching out for any traps, and offering a hand to Gikur to help him carry the weapons back.</p>

<p>Guard Dogs: () you wait for Trijask to give you an order and attack.</p>

<p>Renna: () You move over to where Rudig has put the armours down and help him go through them.</p>

<p>Prilanos: () You move back to The Last Bastion and move to help Rudig.</p>

<p>Blearm: () you giggle quietly, the normal people in The Last Bastion ignore you as they always do, you know you're not right in the head, if you were you wouldn't be where you are.</p>

            <p>"Alright my friends, I believe that we should finish stocking up and proceed to the next room," He points to the map, specifically Room 7. "I say we proceed to this room, beelining towards the room with the river of acid." He let his finger linger on the map, allowing his Eldritch Presence to store a copy into it's incomprehensible memory.</p>

<p>Bellas, having left the treasure room, nodded along, working on enchanting the new bow.</p>

            <p>... before approaching Uriel. He considers the map, then shakes his head. "I believe we should try to explore this dungeon as fully as possible," he says. "However, we have been too slow in our explorations. Perhaps it would be best if we split into at least two teams. One team could advance through Room 2, then through Rooms 9 and 8, while the others pass through Rooms 3, 7, and 10, with the parties meeting up at Room 11. We can review our experiences there and determine if splitting up makes us more effective." He looks around at the other members of the party. "Does this seem acceptable to you?"</p>

<p>Centorea, who is trotting over to the rack of magical items, shrugs. "Doesn't matter to me," she says. Davug glances at Virro, and the Elf nods. He knows what he means. Davug nods back, and then also approaches the magic items. He begins to search for something that will either increase his defense or allow him to defend those around him, while Centorea begins looking for something that will boost her healing abilities.</p>

            <p>"No. Splitting up is the worst thing we could do," she said. "We are splitting our combined resources over multiple parties. This can only lead to trouble. From what I've heard we've been okay so far, but one botched cast or lapse in judgement could seriously cripple us." She took a breath. "We should stock up now and keep moving, raiding the rooms we do come across. We can clear the rest of the dungeon after we finish off the dragon."</p>

            <p>Virro: (9) Looking at the map you notice it is fundamentally different to the other maps you have seen in the other rooms of the dungeon. Passages and even entire rooms are shown on this one where there is naught but empty space on the others. Given what you've seen so far, the orange lines indicate normal doors, purple lines are hidden doors and black lines are the walls. Unfortunately you cannot find a way to remove the map from its frame and you suspect such a thing may be all but impossible. <a href="https://s7.postimg.org/ymlalaky3/SWATCOTHA_full_map.png">https://s7.postimg.org/ymlalaky3/SWATCOTHA_full_map.png</a>  </p>

<p>Evard: ()</p>

<p>Uriel: (5) You search the room, not looking at any specific, but you do find that there are no more traps in the room and that there are no other doors out of the room.</p>

<p>Keegra: (8) Of the 3 potions you pull out, 1 seems to be some kind of healing potion, The second looks like some kind of elemental resistance potion, you can't quite tell without trying some. The third potion is a bit of a mystery and you have no idea what it does. Each potion has enough for 3 doses inside. </p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (10) You are able to pick up and look at 4 scrolls. Each scroll is a single use and essentially casts a spell on the rest of the occupants in the room. You know that generally Scrolls are also more powerful than potions. The first Scroll has a healing spell on it, the second some kind of fear spell on it, the third Has a scroll that will reveal anything hidden in the room you are in and the fourth... Well the fourth looks like a recipe for some really delicious Chicken Broth that a previous adventurer has left in the chest. Perhaps once you get out of here you may try and make it. </p>

<p>Kali: ()</p>

<p>Yeleni: ()</p>

<p>Priya: ()</p>

<p>Bellas: (5) You walk into Room 6 and start to look around. You manage find a decent looking Short Sword(+2), You hold onto it just in case, but it doesn't look any better than your own Swords. </p>

<p>Centorea: (7) You search through the armours and find what looks like a nice set of Heavy Armour. However, as you touch it, an old illusion falls off of it and you see that it is fairly rusty and battered and that your current armour would offer you more protection. You pick it up anyway, just in case.Gained Banded Armour(+1)</p>

<p>Davug: (5) You hurry over to the weapon racks and find yourself a decent looking Handaxe(+2) that should go nicely with your mace. Whilst your looking through the weapons you do glance over at Keegra a couple of times, which is probably why you were slightly distracted.</p>

<p>Shaban: () You wait in the Room 4 for Virro's next orders</p>

<p>Room 5: There are five male warriors standing a little bit back from the door in a line. The outer two are Lizardmen, whilst the other three are all dwarves The dwarves are clad in plate mail, and wield a shield and an axe each, the two Lizardmen are wearing some kind of Heavy Armour and are wielding Greatswords. Each of the Lizardmen are also holding the collars of a Guard Dog and seem ready to release them at a moments notice. Further back there is a female elf wearing Leather armour, wielding a Longbow with a full quiver of arrows on her back, Next to her is a female Centaur wearing Mail Armour with some Javelins strapped to her back. Finally, almost out of sight is a small Kobold in Light armour with a sling. The room itself is another long rectangle, although this one is thinner than room 4. There do not appear to be any other doors in this room, although a lone painting seems to stand out almost at the far end of the North Wall and two lighter shades of stone are almost opposite each other on the North and South Walls about a third of the way down. The rest of the room looks well used, a temporary smithy/kitchen seems to have been set up alongside some benches and desks with things going on on them and a small sleeping area. Noticing you are not Undead, the Warriors seem to relax slightly, and bid you welcome to, as they call it, "The Last Bastion."</p>

<p>Room 6: The room is relatively small, probably the smallest room you've been in so far, although the contents of the room may make it feel smaller than it actually is. In one of the corners there is a massive amount of weaponry, in another a massive collection of armours, a third has rings, belts and amulets galore, whilst the fourth corner holds a single chest. Directly opposite you is a map that looks different to the ones you have seen previously. The door that lead into this room has mysteriously disappeared, and in front of the now vacant doorway is a small rectangular welcome mat. This must be one of the treasure rooms scattered around the dungeon that you have heard about.</p>

<p>Rudig: () Arms full on new armour you take it back to The Last Bastion to begin Improving and fixing so that it'll fit who it needs to.</p>

<p>Gikur: () With Rudig's arms full of armour you go and search through the weapons in case anything is better than what you, and the rest of The Last Bastion currently have.</p>

<p>Urouk: () You stand guard, looking out of the known entrance to The Last Bastion.</p>

<p>Trijask: () You continue to guard the door to The Last Bastion and watch for enemies to kill.</p>

<p>Gantuxuz: () You stand in room 6 watching out for any traps, and offering a hand to Gikur to help him carry the weapons back.</p>

<p>Guard Dogs: () you wait for Trijask to give you an order and attack.</p>

<p>Renna: () You move over to where Rudig has put the armours down and help him go through them.</p>

<p>Prilanos: () You move back to The Last Bastion and move to help Rudig.</p>

<p>Blearm: () you giggle quietly, the normal people in The Last Bastion ignore you as they always do, you know you're not right in the head, if you were you wouldn't be where you are.</p>

            <p>She thought about digging for a new one, then realized that would hold the current round up too long. "Hey, Orc-"</p>

<p>"His name is Davug," Virro interrupted distractedly.</p>

<p>"Davug, then, switch with me. You check armor, I'm gonna loot a weapon." She walked over to the weapons rack and began doing exactly as she had said she would. Davug glared at her, but did what she had suggested. At that moment, he sorely wished he could have done something else, but it was, admittedly, far more practical to go looking for armor than anything else. Virro, who had been looking at the map, made sure to memorize what he had seen. He turned to the chest, and tried to see if there were any more scrolls or potions in the chest that he might take, particularly necromantic ones or ones that might help him gain some control of his magic in those instances where it flared too powerfully for him to control.</p>

            <p>Virro: (5) You look through the amulets you find one with a skull on it. Hoping that it'll help your necromantic expertise you put it on. Unfortunately for you the enchanter of this particular item didn't thin of the skull when they put the enchantment on it, instead this amulet protects you from any poisons you may ingest, or the effects of any poisonous weapons. Gained Necklace of Poison Immunity.</p>

<p>Evard: ()</p>

<p>Uriel: (8) You pick up an ordinary looking ring that feels special to you in some way. Putting it on you feel your ski hardening and realize that this ring is a Ring of Hardened Skin, a blessing to Sluggers everywhere, as it makes your skin harder, allowing you to not only do more damage when you punch someone but also to protect yourself when attacked. Gained Ring of Hardened Skin (+2 Armour)</p>

<p>Keegra: (7) You attack the Chest's lid, not caring about whatever Xiv'riit has to say at the moment.</p>

<p>Combat!: Keegra (16 + 5 Dam = 21) vs Chest (13 + 5 = 18) With your first attack you rattle the chest lid, it looks like it could break from a couple more of your attacks. Second Attack Keegra (9 + 5 Dam = 14) vs Chest (13 + 5 = 18) Your second attack does nothing against the chest lid, obviously hitting one of the reinforced parts of it. Third Attack Keegra (19 + 5 Dam = 24) vs Chest (13 + 5 = 18) With your third attack you focus on where you hit with your first attack and are able to smash a small hole through the lid of the chest which you are then able to use to rip the rest of the lid off of the chest. Inside you find a large collection of bottled potions and what look like magical scrolls. You are immediately thankful that you didn't smash the chest so hard that you could of broken any of the bottles, or else the result could have been... volatile to say the least. </p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (10 - 3 Inj = 7) Whilst too late to save the chest lid from Keegra's rage, you do see a small bag some of the scrolls were sitting in, taking it you carefully put the scrolls back into the chest, and then pick up the metal ball that had previously hit you. Putting the bag on your belt, and the ball in your new bag you find out that, the bag is enchanted in such a way that whilst the volume of the bag remains the same ((about the size of your standard supermarket carrier bag)) not only do you not feel the weight of the items in the bag, it also doesn't move around unless you specifically want it to, meaning t won't get in your way in combat. You have gained a Bag of Holding.</p>

<p>Kali: ()</p>

<p>Yeleni: ()</p>

<p>Priya: ()</p>

<p>Bellas: (7) You successfully enchant your bow. </p>

<p>Centorea: (11) Clip-clopping through the rooms you find Xiv'riit. Seeing that is concussed, you decide to use your clerical powers on him. Unaware of his previous attempts with this kind of healing magic, you let loose a pulse of healing energy that flows through both Room 6 and Room 5, healing all those withing those Rooms by 4 Health ((Even if that'd take them above max)) as well as healing all injuries.   </p>

<p>Davug: (4) You walk into Room 6 and then immediately forget what you were planning on doing once you see the sheer amount of treasure in here.</p>

<p>Shaban: () You wait in the Room 4 for Virro's next orders</p>

<p>Renna: () You move over to where Rudig has put the armours down and help him go through them.</p>

<p>Prilanos: () Feeling another burst of healing magic, you go through to Room 6 to ask the two clerics in there how they did it.</p>

<p>Blearm: () you giggle quietly, the normal people in The Last Bastion ignore you as they always do, you know you're not right in the head, if you were you wouldn't be where you are. </p>

            <p>She started picking through it, trying to find something good. Davug shook off his stupor and reddened a little. He had very much not intended to just stand there and stare, and hurriedly walked over to the weapons rack to try and find another one-handed weapon to go with his mace. Virro, meanwhile, decided that the amulet should do well enough while Centorea and Davug looked for other equipment, and so decided to investigate the map.</p>

            <p>Virro: (7 + 2Cir = 9) Talking to Renna it appears that the bow is more than sufficient. Shutting up as Renna works her magic on the bow, you watch as the enchantments on it begin to take shape. </p>

<p>Evard: ()</p>

<p>Uriel: (3) Writing your newfound discovery down in your journal, you become engrossed in your journal flipping back and forth through it wondering how else you could further the research into exactly how Psions work, </p>

<p>Keegra: (7 - 1inj = 6) You run into the room, not quite sure what to start trying to loot first. You head over to the chest and find that it is locked, no matter how hard you try you find yourself unable to make the lid of the chest lift.  </p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (12) Searching underneath the welcome mat, you find a large heavy key, that after Keegra's screams of annoyance at the chest she is at, you realize must be used to open the chest. Before you can move across the room the trap you activated when you picked up the mat comes into play, dropping a medium sized, metal spiked ball onto your head.</p>

<p>Combat! Trap (17) vs Xiv'riit (13 + 5 -1Arm = 17) Nothing happens... </p>

<p>Despite the ball falling towards your head, you barely feel it as it bounces off and lands on the floor besides you. Even though it didn't hurt persay you definitely feel the concussion caused by having a heavy object dropped on your head. So much for your theory that Parnax definitely wouldn't lay any traps for you in his treasure rooms. Gained Concussion (-3 Inj, 4 turns Remaining)</p>

<p>Kali: ()</p>

<p>Yeleni: ()</p>

<p>Priya: ()</p>

<p>Bellas: () You have heard of the Bore Hole and traveled many miles from the Elven Kingdom to get here. Along the way you encountered the Centaur who now walks by your side as the two of you enter this place. The cavernous entryway has thinned down to the point where you are forced to walk in single file, and has become so low that your centaur friend now has to duck. Still, you have found yourself at a crossroads, looking to your right you see what appears to be an armory with what seem to be the same kind of weapons as the ones you carry now, to the left is some kind of old barracks that now looks abandoned. Seeing a small huddle of people in the room ahead of you you enter, finding yourself in Room 4</p>

<p>Centorea: () You have heard of the Bore Hole and traveled many miles from the Southern Steppes to get here. Along the way you encountered the Elf who now walks by your side as the two of you enter this place. The cavernous entryway has thinned down to the point where you are forced to walk in single file, and has become so low that you now have to duck. Still, you have found yourself at a crossroads, looking to your right you see what appears to be an armory with what seem to be the same kind of weapons as the ones you carry now, to the left is some kind of old barracks that now looks abandoned. Seeing a small huddle of people in the room ahead of you you enter, finding yourself in Room 4</p>

<p>Davug: () You wait in the Last Bastion for Virro's next orders.</p>

<p>Shaban: () You wait in the Room 4 for Virro's next orders</p>

<p>Room 5: There are five male warriors standing a little bit back from the door in a line. The outer two are Lizardmen, whilst the other three are all dwarves The dwarves are clad in plate mail, and wield a shield and an axe each, the two Lizardmen are wearing some kind of Heavy Armour and are wielding Greatswords. Each of the Lizardmen are also holding the collars of a Guard Dog and seem ready to release them at a moments notice. Further back there is a female elf wearing Leather armour, wielding a Longbow with a full quiver of arrows on her back, Next to her is a female Centaur wearing Mail Armour with some Javelins strapped to her back. Finally, almost out of sight is a small Kobold in Light armour with a sling. The room itself is another long rectangle, although this one is thinner than room 4. There do not appear to be any other doors in this room, although a lone painting seems to stand out almost at the far end of the North Wall and two lighter shades of stone are almost opposite each other on the North and South Walls about a third of the way down. The rest of the room looks well used, a temporary smithy/kitchen seems to have been set up alongside some benches and desks with things going on on them and a small sleeping area. Noticing you are not Undead, the Warriors seem to relax slightly, and bid you welcome to, as they call it, "The Last Bastion."</p>

<p>Room 6: The room is relatively small, probably the smallest room you've been in so far, although the contents of the room may make it feel smaller than it actually is. In one of the corners there is a massive amount of weaponry, in another a massive collection of armours, a third has rings, belts and amulets galore, whilst the fourth corner holds a single chest. Directly opposite you is a map that looks different to the ones you have seen previously. The door that lead into this room has mysteriously disappeared, and in front of the now vacant doorway is a small rectangular welcome mat. This must be one of the treasure rooms scattered around the dungeon that you have heard about.</p>

<p>Rudig: (9) You head into Room 6 and start picking out some new armour for your fellow warriors in The Last Bastion</p>

<p>Gikur: (3) Seeing Xiv'riit trigger the door mat trap you worry about setting foot inside.</p>

<p>Urouk: () You stand guard, looking out of the known entrance to The Last Bastion.</p>

<p>Trijask: () You continue to guard the door to The Last Bastion and watch for enemies to kill.</p>

<p>Gantuxuz: (4) You stand in room 6 watching as people moe around and start to loot it.</p>

<p>Guard Dogs: () you wait for Trijask to give you an order and attack.</p>

<p>Renna: (9) You are able to enchant Virro's bow. With a finishing touch you make it slightly more lethal against undead, just because you feel like you can. </p>

<p>Prilanos: (3) Busy in the Last Bastion you don't realize anything is wrong in Room 6.</p>

<p>Blearm: () you giggle quietly, the normal people in The Last Bastion ignore you as they always do, you know you're not right in the head, if you were you wouldn't be where you are. Happy to be trading again you giggle as you watch both theElf and the Shardmind get acquainted with their new weapons</p>

            <p>"Yeesh, doesn't that horse know how to pack lightly?" She asked to no one in particular. She then begun work on enchanting her Bow.</p>

<p>It was at about this moment that a smell hit her. It was definitely Tea, but it was the innate Tea-ness of the smell that caught her attention. To Tl;Dr the feelings it brought along, it was nostalgic, and comforting. She knew of only one Tea-maker that made Tea like this.</p>

<p>"Oi! Old Man!" Bellas said, waving to the Shardmind in question.</p>

<p>No reaction.</p>

<p>"The Tea's getting cold!"</p>

<p>Where one Uriel Seraphim once was there was now a simple cloud of dust.</p>

<p>"This Tea is not getting cold," The Shardmind said, examining the Tea Stand. He turned to where the voice came from, a raging fire in his eyes, quite literally in fact. Said fire died down almost immediately when he saw who stood there. "Ah, Miss Schwarz, it is a pleasure."</p>

<p>"Same, how long has it been? A year? Two?"</p>

<p>"You last visited my shop a week ago."</p>

<p>"Ooo treasure room," Bellas said, running off towards said room.</p>

<p>Uriel simply shrugged and walked after her.</p>

            <p>((Warning: The following is a lot of text with very little that is actually important. I shall sum it up below if you (justifiably) do not want to wade through this giant thing looking for the tiny kernels of useful information.))</p>

<p>She smiled a little. She wasn't a Rogue, at least, not this time, so she enjoyed the feeling of authority the sound gave her. As she surveyed the room, she noticed that one of the doors was open. "Oh?" she said. Carefully, she peered through the opening. It seemed to be empty except for a creature of some sort. She grimaced. On the other hand, perhaps there were times when being stealthy could be useful, even for a Knight. She drew her sword and shield, and walked about halfway across the floor. "Identify yourself!" The creature didn't move, nor did it speak. "I said, identify yourself!" Again, nothing happened. Centorea was a bit puzzled. She walked a bit closer. Still, nothing. She stared at the thing warily, looking for clues. Then, a tiny whiff of a familiar scent hit her nose. Ah, so that was it. A zombie. Evidently, a zombie without a master. She stepped a bit closer, and sniffed again. Whoever its master had been, he was good. Barely a hint of the scent of rot, and it seemed not to have visibly decayed at all. She paused, thought, and smiled. Well, that confirmed it. If her information was right, and it was rarely wrong, he was here, for who else would be so ridiculously fussy as to prevent a zombie from reeking of death? She carefully stepped around the zombie and into the next room. Ah, there he was, exactly as he'd been described to her. "Oh, Virro!" she called. Immediately, the Orc next to him swung around to face her, raising his mace. Virro himself also turned, but did not raise the bow he had just received from Renna. He stared at her.</p>

<p>"Do I know you?" he asked carefully. Mentally, she laughed. Whoops. Of course he wouldn't recognize her, she wasn't even the same species as she'd been before!</p>

<p>"Virro, it's Connel!" she said, stepping towards him. The Orc growled low in his throat, but Virro shook his head, then smiled at her, eyes a bit brighter for seeing someone he knew.</p>

<p>"Connel! It has been far too long," he said, walking towards her as she clopped over to him. They embraced when they met, and looked each other over. "I see you've changed more than your face," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, of course!" she replied. "Not all of us are sticks-in-the-mud like you who keep the same Race and name every time. Actually, I have changed my name this time, too. I'm Centorea, now!" He smirked a little.</p>

<p>"Centorea? Truly?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," she said, flashing a smile at him before bending down to whisper into his ear. "And, if you're good, I'll be your knight tonight, just like she's his." He shook his head and smiled.</p>

<p>"Not this time, I'm afraid," he said. "I take it you have taken the Knight class, then." She unbent and looked down at him.</p>

<p>"Yup," she replied. "Shield Wall form. I've also got the Healer and Cleric stuff from Centaur. I heard you guys could use some support. So, what about you?"</p>

<p>"I have taken the Beastmaster and Necromancer racial feats, and the Stealer of People class feat." It was Centorea's turn to smirk, and she looked over his head at Davug. He was standing a short distance away, and glaring at her.</p>

<p>"Oh, that one, huh? Is that why that guy's following you around and being so protective?" She grinned. "It's so cute when they try to do that for us! Oh, is it gonna be like the other time? The one where you-"</p>

<p>"Con- Centorea, please," Virro hissed, glancing nervously over his should. He saw Davug, and winced a little. "Please, Centorea, he said again, a bit less urgently. "Not here, not now, and not in front of them." She raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Are you still that broken up over that? You fixed it in the end, didn't you? Undid what you did that year?" He grimaced, and looked away.</p>

<p>"It was still the most vile thing I have done in all of my existence," he said.</p>

<p>"Virro, that was literally lifetimes ago," she replied crossing her arms. "You've got to get over it someday."</p>

<p>"I am over it, but I shall not allow it to happen again. Now, may we please change the subject?"</p>

<p>"Alright, we can do that." She grinned again and bent down to whisper once more. "So, if you're not going to do that, how long is it gonna take before you start trying to get him to show you if he's more than just tall."</p>

<p>"Centorea!" he said. "I told you, I am not doing that again. Never again." She rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, you know what I was asking," she replied. "I'm asking when you're just gonna talk him into it."</p>

<p>"I am not," he huffed. "This game was clearly not built for such purposes. There is no mechanic in place that would cover such a scenario."</p>

<p>"It's got a mechanic that covers everything," she said. "And, hey, looking at him, who knows what he's thinking. I mean, how hard did you really have to try to get him to come along with that face?" She stroked her fingers down his cheek, and he didn't flinch. It was rather normal, for them.</p>

<p>"I rolled a natural twenty," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Oooh, nice going. Oh, maybe that's the game's-" She was interrupted by a crashing sound from the next room. Virro was very relieved for the distraction. "What was that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It was likely one of our teammates doing particularly poorly on a roll," he replied. "Do you wish to find out, and meet them in the flesh?"</p>

<p>"That sounds great," she said. She paused. "Oh, but, before we do, you should probably do something about that guy out there. He's not actually doing anything, and I'm guessing that's not on purpose." Virro groaned, and stuck his head through the doorway. </p>

<p>"Why does he have to be such an idiot?" he grumbled. He was about to shout at the zombie to turn around and actually guard the door, when Centorea decided to tell him another piece of valuable information.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, there's an Elf who's gonna be showing up pretty soon," she added. Virro glared at her. </p>

<p>"You could not have told me this before I almost had my zombie butchered?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I guess I just forgot," she said. She grinned and shrugged innocently.</p>

<p>"I know very well you did not," he said.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you're right." Centorea grinned and walked towards the hallways. Once she was a suitable distance away to Davug's mind, he walked up next to Virro.</p>

<p>"<b>You know her.</b>" It was a statement, not a question.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"<b>How?</b>" Virro sighed.</p>

<p>"I... cannot tell you at this moment. It would break certain... rules. I will explain it to you later, however. I do swear." Davug grunted. He was obviously not happy about it. Virro wondered if, perhaps, Centorea was right, and this was a form of... jealousy. He quickly dismissed the thought. No, it wasn't. "I must ask, was Shaban as much of a fool as I have seen him be in death in life?"</p>

<p>"<b>Yes.</b>" They walked the little remaining distance in silence, and both were a bit relieved to find themselves on the other side of corridor. Centorea was standing next to Xiv'riit, shaking her head and looking at his.</p>

<p>"How did you get that to happen?" she asked. "Never mind, I know. Here, let me handle this." She began channeling healing energy into the Shardmind, trying to remove his injuries.</p>

<p>"I see you are taking to your role quite quickly," Virro said, smiling. "You may wish to know that this is Xiv'riit. Xiv'riit, this is Centorea. She will be joining our party." In a slightly better mood, he surveyed the room, and quickly made his way towards the row of amulets. Perhaps there was something he would find useful. Meanwhile, Davug, after giving the room a quick enough glance to believe that Xiv'riit had set off the only trap in the room, moved to search the pile of weaponry for another one-handed weapon he could use.</p>

<p>((TL;DR Version: Blah, blah, talking, blah, blah, vague references, blah, blah, Virro knows Shaban's not watching for anybody but is leaving him like that so Mattman's character can get through, blah, blah, game mechanics, blah, blah, leaning on the fourth wall, blah, blah, Centorea's using her Cleric powers on Xiv'riit, Virro's looking through the amulets and stuff, and Davug is looking for another one-handed weapon.))</p>

            <p>Virro: (7 + 2Cir = 9) You barter with Blearm quite successfully, and are delighted when he gives you a fine oak longbow in return for your currently broken weapon. You are not quite sure where either your new longbow appeared from, or where your old bow went, but right now you don't really care. Lost Cracked Bow, Gained Longbow (+5)</p>

<p>Evard: ()</p>

<p>Uriel: (9) You use your powers in a way that most had not thought to use them before. Whilst you are very sure that there are no magic users in the next room, you are not 100% sure there are no sentient creatures in the next room at all. You did however feel the presence of several magic, and magical, items in the next room. </p>

<p>Keegra: (2) You try to speak but you just can't make the words come out. In fact the co-ordination between your teeth, your brain and your tongue is so bad that you manage to bite your tongue whilst trying to speak, badly. This doesn't stop you from trying however, and when you realize that talking isn't your best bet right now, in your gesturing you manage to strike the door, slightly harder than you intended. The pain jars your arm slightly, but with your bash the door seems to pop out of its hinges and fall to the ground, revealing to you Room 6. Gained (Bitten Tongue, -1 Inj, 1 turns remaining) Lost 3 health. </p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (12) You give your longsword to Blearm and in return he carefully hands you an exquisite longsword. It is only after he has handed it to you, and you have picked it up, that you realise that he had kept some cloth between his hand and the sword whilst giving it to you. Before you can question why, a searing pain ripples through your body, cause you to yell out in agony, however after a brief few, but painful, seconds the pain is gone. Looking at Blearm he squeaks "Sword is now bounds to you, it can never go too far from you and will always return. Onlys way to release you from this is to die." Despite the morbid way the Kobold ends his speech, you can't help but feel empowered by your sword. Gained Fatal Touch (+6, Lethal Touch, Return Policy) Lost 6 Health.</p>

<p>Kali: ()</p>

<p>Yeleni: ()</p>

<p>Priya: ()</p>

<p>Davug: () You wait in the Last Bastion for Virro's next orders</p>

<p>Shaban: () You wait in the Room 4 for Virro's next orders</p>

<p>Room 5: There are five male warriors standing a little bit back from the door in a line. The outer two are Lizardmen, whilst the other three are all dwarves The dwarves are clad in plate mail, and wield a shield and an axe each, the two Lizardmen are wearing some kind of Heavy Armour and are wielding Greatswords. Each of the Lizardmen are also holding the collars of a Guard Dog and seem ready to release them at a moments notice. Further back there is a female elf wearing Leather armour, wielding a Longbow with a full quiver of arrows on her back, Next to her is a female Centaur wearing Mail Armour with some Javelins strapped to her back. Finally, almost out of sight is a small Kobold in Light armour with a sling. The room itself is another long rectangle, although this one is thinner than room 4. There do not appear to be any other doors in this room, although a lone painting seems to stand out almost at the far end of the North Wall and two lighter shades of stone are almost opposite each other on the North and South Walls about a third of the way down. The rest of the room looks well used, a temporary smithy/kitchen seems to have been set up alongside some benches and desks with things going on on them and a small sleeping area. Noticing you are not Undead, the Warriors seem to relax slightly, and bid you welcome to, as they call it, "The Last Bastion."</p>

<p>Room 6: The room is relatively small, probably the smallest room you've been in so far, although the contents of the room may make it feel smaller than it actually is. In one of the corners there is a massive amount of weaponry, in another a massive collection of armours, a third has rings, belts and amulets galore, whilst the fourth corner holds a single chest. Directly opposite you is a map that looks different to the ones you have seen previously. The door that lead into this room has mysteriously disappeared, and in front of the now vacant doorway is a small rectangular welcome mat. This must be one of the treasure rooms scattered around the dungeon that you have heard about.  </p>

<p>Rudig: () You puzzle over the existence of the newfound passageway and begin to work out how would be best to hold it in case things take a turn for the worse.</p>

<p>Gikur: (4) Amazed at how Keegra opened the door with a single punch, the disappearance of the door makes you worry about setting foot inside. </p>

<p>Urouk: () You stand guard, looking out of the known entrance to The Last Bastion. </p>

<p>Trijask: () You continue to guard the door to The Last Bastion and watch for enemies to kill.</p>

<p>Gantuxuz: (8) You move through the doorway, stepping over the welcome mat as if it wasn't there. Poking a couple of things and lifting weapons and armour from their positions you declare the room safe.   </p>

<p>Guard Dogs: () you wait for Trijask to give you an order and attack.</p>

<p>Renna: ()</p>

<p>Prilanos: (7 + 2Cir = 9) taking the initiative you move over to Xiv'riit and try to heal him. (6) Your healing energy flows through him and heal him for 9 Health. You make the motions again, (4) restoring a further 5 Health. </p>

<p>Blearm: () you giggle quietly, the normal people in The Last Bastion ignore you as they always do, you know you're not right in the head, if you were you wouldn't be where you are. Happy to be trading again you giggle as you watch both theElf and the Shardmind get acquainted with their new weapons</p>

            <p>Virro: (7 + 2Cir = 9) You manage to successfully bargain with Renna. Although it does not appear that the other Elf was going to charge you for enchanting a bow for you, she was going to ask you to do a task that she will not specify exactly. However your charismatic personality wins her over, and she agrees that you do not have to do the task for her, she says she is sure someone else can do it if need be. .</p>

<p>Evard: () </p>

<p>Uriel: (6) You brew what appears to be a normal cup of tea and are eager to drink it. Gained Tea. </p>

<p>Keegra: (11) From the shocked looks on the faces of all in The Last Bastion, you assume that the answer is, no, they did not know about it. A fact that Rudig soon confirms. A talk between the occupants of The Last Bastion reveal their certainty that noting hostile, alive or undead is in the room at the end of the secret passageway, although that doesn't mean the room is completely safe as there are trapped rooms in the dungeon waiting for someone to spring the trap and dies from them. You manage to convince Gikur and Gantuxuz to explore the passageway and the room beyond with you.  </p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (10) Like Keegra you ask your questions and the occupants of The Last Bastion respond sincerely. They honestly had no idea that the passage had existed until Keegra had found it. It is thanks to your questions that Gantuxuz decides to help Gikur explore the passageway. Blearm meanwhile is bouncing up and down excitedly at the thought of someone trading with him.</p>

<p>Kali: () </p>

<p>Yeleni: () </p>

<p>Priya: () </p>

<p>Davug: () You wait in the Last Bastion for Virro's next orders</p>

<p>Shaban: () You wait in the Room 4 for Virro's next orders</p>

<p>Room 5: There are five male warriors standing a little bit back from the door in a line. The outer two are Lizardmen, whilst the other three are all dwarves The dwarves are clad in plate mail, and wield a shield and an axe each, the two Lizardmen are wearing some kind of Heavy Armour and are wielding Greatswords. Each of the Lizardmen are also holding the collars of a Guard Dog and seem ready to release them at a moments notice. Further back there is a female elf wearing Leather armour, wielding a Longbow with a full quiver of arrows on her back, Next to her is a female Centaur wearing Mail Armour with some Javelins strapped to her back. Finally, almost out of sight is a small Kobold in Light armour with a sling. The room itself is another long rectangle, although this one is thinner than room 4. There do not appear to be any other doors in this room, although a lone painting seems to stand out almost at the far end of the North Wall and two lighter shades of stone are almost opposite each other on the North and South Walls about a third of the way down. The rest of the room looks well used, a temporary smithy/kitchen seems to have been set up alongside some benches and desks with things going on on them and a small sleeping area. Noticing you are not Undead, the Warriors seem to relax slightly, and bid you welcome to, as they call it, "The Last Bastion."</p>

<p>Rudig: () You puzzle over the existence of the newfound passageway and begin to work out how would be best to hold it in case things take a turn for the worse.</p>

<p>Gikur: (5) You advance up the passageway, however you are unable to open the door at the end, it is not locked, merely stuck in place, and appearing to swing into the passageway instead of into the room, you are unable to make any progress.</p>

<p>Urouk: () You watch Uriel make the tea, raising an eyebrow at the practice but otherwise leaving him to it.</p>

<p>Trijask: () You continue to guard the door to The Last Bastion and watch for enemies to kill.</p>

<p>Gantuxuz: (5) You are very sure the passageway itself has no traps or other secrets hidden along it, however, like Gikur you are unable to get the door open.  </p>

<p>Guard Dogs: () you wait for Trijask to give you an order and attack.</p>

<p>Renna: () </p>

<p>Prilanos: () </p>

<p>Blearm: () you giggle quietly, the normal people in The Last Bastion ignore you as they always do, you know you're not right in the head, if you were you wouldn't be where you are. Still, you wonder if any of the newcomers have anything interesting to trade, it would be nice to just be a merchant again.</p>

<p>He closes his eyes and begins to imagine the tendrils he associates with his Eldritch Presence. He imagines his hand as a hole in the door, and he lets the presence slip though the door.

            <p>He approached the Kobold. "You are a Merchant, yes?" he inquired. "I believe I have something I would be willing to trade with you." He took out his bow and showed it to Blearm. "Would you be willing to exchange this for something?" Davug stepped a little closer, and eyed the Merchant suspiciously. Something was not quite right about that one. He did not trust him. He mentally readied himself to defend the Elf if need be.</p>

            <p>Virro: () You are talking to Renna. </p>

<p>Evard: () You move back up to Room 4</p>

<p>Uriel: (5) You set about making another cup of tea. You let it brew successfully, however something about it doesn't quite fell right. </p>

<p>Keegra: (9) You take a look at the picture, tapping around the edges of it, it feels like the wall behind it is hollow in the middle. Taking a chance you rip through the picture and find yourself in a hallway you know isn't on the map you normally see in the rooms. The corridor bends around to the right a few paces ahead of you, and after a quick check, you notice that it only goes for a short length before it ends at a door, this one with a wooden sign attached with a number 6 on it. Whilst yu are not specifically listening out for anything, this area seems to be completely quiet.  </p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (7) You manage to speak up to the room and get your questions asked. </p>

<p>Kali: () You move back up to Room 4</p>

<p>Yeleni: () You move back up to Room 4</p>

<p>Priya: () You move back up to Room 4</p>

<p>Davug: () You wait in the Last Bastion for Virro's next orders</p>

<p>Shaban: (4) You wait in the Room 4 for Virro's next orders</p>

<p>Room 5: There are five male warriors standing a little bit back from the door in a line. The outer two are Lizardmen, whilst the other three are all dwarves The dwarves are clad in plate mail, and wield a shield and an axe each, the two Lizardmen are wearing some kind of Heavy Armour and are wielding Greatswords. Each of the Lizardmen are also holding the collars of a Guard Dog and seem ready to release them at a moments notice. Further back there is a female elf wearing Leather armour, wielding a Longbow with a full quiver of arrows on her back, Next to her is a female Centaur wearing Mail Armour with some Javelins strapped to her back. Finally, almost out of sight is a small Kobold in Light armour with a sling. The room itself is another long rectangle, although this one is thinner than room 4. There do not appear to be any other doors in this room, although a lone painting seems to stand out almost at the far end of the North Wall and two lighter shades of stone are almost opposite each other on the North and South Walls about a third of the way down. The rest of the room looks well used, a temporary smithy/kitchen seems to have been set up alongside some benches and desks with things going on on them and a small sleeping area. Noticing you are not Undead, the Warriors seem to relax slightly, and bid you welcome to, as they call it, "The Last Bastion."</p>

<p>Rudig: () Listening to the Shardmind asking the questions you step forward to answer them. "Aye, Prilanos over there is our Healer and Cleric all in one." You say, pointing to the Centaur, "and if you want to trade, well we don't have a lot of stuff, and we'd rather not part with any of it, however Blearm over there." This time you point to the Kobold. "Has some kind of magic market stall thing-y set up so that only he can access it. It works on equivalent exchange. You give him something of one kind or another, and he'll give you something else of the same kind. So swords for swords or mail armour for mail armour. That kinda thing."</p>

<p>Gikur: () With no one interacting with you, you keep an eye on the Orc, watching for any hostility he may show. That he is potentially enthralled makes you even more paranoid about him.</p>

<p>Urouk: (9) You watch Uriel make the tea, raising an eyebrow at the practice but otherwise leaving him to it.</p>

<p>Trijask: () Alongside your brother you continue to guard the door to The Last Bastion and watch for enemies to kill.</p>

<p>Gantuxuz: () Alongside your brother you continue to guard the door to The Last Bastion and watch for enemies to kill.</p>

<p>Guard Dogs: () you wait for the Lizardmen to give you an order and attack.</p>

<p>Renna: () Annoyed that Virro just seems to be ignoring you as a person and trying to use your skills for himself, you sigh and shake you head. "I may be, but it's not like you'd need those skills with that piece of twig and string you've got yourself there. Get it repaired or traded and I may be able to see what I could do. After we talk price of course."</p>

<p>Prilanos: () Noticing Uriel is happy with his hand you walk forward as Rudig mentions your name to the other Shardmind. You can feel the divine magic coming from him and so you know that he is one of the main reasons this adventuring party were able to successfully drive off the zombies that  had kept you in the Last Bastion. </p>

<p>Blearm: () you giggle quietly, the normal people in The Last Bastion ignore you as they always do, you know you're not right in the head, if you were you wouldn't be where you are. Still, you wonder if any of the newcomers have anything interesting to trade, it would be nice to just be a merchant again.</p>

<p>"Now, before it hands over its weaponry to you," the shardmind said smoothly, "it would like you to answer Keegra's question."</p>

<p>It had hoped to investigate the painting for signs of recent usage before it was destroyed, but for now, questioning was the more direct line. That said, it moved over to peer at the frame, as casually as it could.</p>

            <p>Virro: () You are talking to Renna. As you do, you start to suspect that the Necromancer Robes made it a bit too obvious what you were and that maybe, it would of been better if you hadn't obviously worn them in this room. Too late now.</p>

<p>Evard: () You move back up to Room 4</p>

<p>Uriel: (8) With a bit of talking you manage to convince Urouk and Prilanos that you want your Knife hand improved not healed. The Centaur and the Dwarf put their heads together (figuratively) and after a minute have worked out how to do so. With Urouk using his smithing tools to sharpen your knife hand and Prilanos healing the pain that the tools create you soon have an Improved knife hand, even better for killing people with.</p>

<p>Keegra: () You continue to talk to Rudig and a bond starts to form between the two of you as you share stories and both relate how hard it is to lead a group. Whilst Rudig won't leave his group behind to travel with you, he gives you a horn that can be blown twice, when it is he will come to your aid until the fight is done, and if he is able he will bring some of the others from "The Last Bastion" too.</p>

<p>Xiv'riit: () </p>

<p>Kali: () You move back up to Room 4</p>

<p>Yeleni: () You move back up to Room 4</p>

<p>Priya: () You move back up to Room 4</p>

<p>Davug: (7) You follow Virro into the Last Bastion, and decide that whilst you don't want to pick a fight with these guys you will if Virro commands.</p>

<p>Shaban: (4) Master may have commanded you but something happened and you did not obey, instead you continue to stand in Room 4 doing absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>Room 5: There are five male warriors standing a little bit back from the door in a line. The outer two are Lizardmen, whilst the other three are all dwarves The dwarves are clad in plate mail, and wield a shield and an axe each, the two Lizardmen are wearing some kind of Heavy Armour and are wielding Greatswords. Each of the Lizardmen are also holding the collars of a Guard Dog and seem ready to release them at a moments notice. Further back there is a female elf wearing Leather armour, wielding a Longbow with a full quiver of arrows on her back, Next to her is a female Centaur wearing Mail Armour with some Javelins strapped to her back. Finally, almost out of sight is a small Kobold in Light armour with a sling. The room itself is another long rectangle, although this one is thinner than room 4. There do not appear to be any other doors in this room, although a lone painting seems to stand out almost at the far end of the North Wall and two lighter shades of stone are almost opposite each other on the North and South Walls about a third of the way down. The rest of the room looks well used, a temporary smithy/kitchen seems to have been set up alongside some benches and desks with things going on on them and a small sleeping area. Noticing you are not Undead, the Warriors seem to relax slightly, and bid you welcome to, as they call it, "The Last Bastion."</p>

<p>Rudig: () You talk with Keegra, and develop a respect for her and think that you could call her friend. You give her your horn in case she comes into trouble but cannot permanently leave the Last Bastion, the others need you too much.</p>

<p>Gikur: () With no one interacting with you, you keep an eye on the Orc, watching for any hostility he may show. That he is potentially enthralled makes you even more paranoid about him.</p>

<p>Urouk: (9) You skillfully work at improving Uriel's hand alongside Prilanos, you wonder how such a thing happened, but decide not to ask.</p>

<p>Trijask: () Alongside your brother you continue to guard the door to The Last Bastion and watch for enemies to kill.</p>

<p>Gantuxuz: () Alongside your brother you continue to guard the door to The Last Bastion and watch for enemies to kill.</p>

<p>Guard Dogs: () you wait for the Lizardmen to give you an order and attack.</p>

<p>Renna: () Looking at Virro you scowl. "No I just decided to randomly carry a large piece of wood on my back. Yes I'm an archer, what do you want Necromancer?" The word necromancer is once again used as an insult. "I lost my sister to undead so don't think that just because we're both Elves I'm going to be any friendlier to you than anyone else."</p>

<p>Prilanos: () Alongside Urouk you help improve Uriel's Knife hand. </p>

<p>Blearm: () you giggle quietly, the normal people in The Last Bastion ignore you as they always do, you know you're not right in the head, if you were you wouldn't be where you are. Still, you wonder if any of the newcomers have anything interesting to trade, it would be nice to just be a merchant again.</p>

            <p>It seemed obvious to it that these were a group of adventurers who'd decided to situate themselves inside this Last Bastion, Watching Over the rest of the cave network as best they could.</p>

<p>It stood to attention, and addressed them. "Are there any clerics among you? Xiv'riit and its companions seek to move further within the caves to find the dragon-- perhaps some armor could be spared? If not entirely, perhaps a trade might be in order?"</p>

            <p>Virro: (8) You put on the Robe that Shaban gave you, as you do you feel empowered, (+1 Cir When trying to raise/control Undead). Talking to the people on the other side of the door you get a grunt of confirmation at your suggestion.</p>

<p>Evard: ()</p>

<p>Uriel: (11) Enthusiastically strolling through the door, you find yourself faced with a motley collection of people from various races. There are five male warriors standing a little bit back from the door in a line. The outer two are Lizardmen, whilst the other three are all dwarves The dwarves are clad in plate mail, and wield a shield and an axe each, the two Lizardmen are wearing some kind of Heavy Armour and are wielding Greatswords.

Noticing you are not Undead, the Warriors seem to relax slightly, and bid you welcome to, as they call it, "The Last Bastion." </p>

<p>Keegra: (6) Unfortunately you're not all that helpful. You try your best and manage to help Davug remove all the shards, but that's about it. (Davug gains +1 Health)</p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (9) You manage to use your magic to help patch up some of Davug's wounds, although your burst of healing magic doesn't seem to be particularly strong this time. Perhaps you need to rest it for a bit before it will be as powerful as it was when you entered this room... (Davug gains 2 Health)</p>

<p>Kali: ()</p>

<p>Yeleni: ()</p>

<p>Priya: ()</p>

<p>Davug: (7) You pick up the mace and put it on your belt. You also find a pouch to put the shards in. </p>

He'd have to go stitch him back up later, but for now, that should do. He stepped into the room, and said, "We are indeed, but if straits are this dire, perhaps we could make a detour in and aid you in escaping from this place." Davug followed and stood behind him, but was ready to thrust him out of danger and defend him if he was given any reason to.</p>

            <p>"Don't try to hide what you are Necromancer." He makes the word sound like an insult,probably because he is using it as one. "If we could have escaped we would have, but whatever magic Paarnax has woven through the Bore Hole prevents us from doing so, much like it now prevents you from escaping or creating new tunnels and caves. Even if it didn't we wouldn't need your pansy assistance Elf." Again Elf sounds like an insult. Rudig looked at Keegra, "Now is there anything in particular you want? You should not worry about the numbers we faced, we do not think Paarnax has those kinds of numbers anymore. "</p>

            <p>Blearm is a Kobold Trader. With his ultra-special hyperspace market-stall he can travel anywhere and still access his stall, allowing you to trade items with him if you want to. However, this mechanic is only in play whilst Blearm is alive and not enthralled, and undeath will not bring it back. Also to trade with Blearm you must specify what you want, and give him something of the same type in exchange (If you want a weapon you must give him a weapon, if you want a piece of armour you must give him some armour, or if you want an Other, you must give him an Other that is an item) The more powerful the thing you give him the more likely the thing you get in return will be more powerful (ie if you gave him a Sword +1 the likelihood you'll get a sword +5 back would be, say 1/10th, but if you gave him a Sword +3 the likelihood you'll get a sword +5 would be 2/10ths for example.)

            <p>"Hail Keegra Bloodfist of the Frostwolf Tribe, my name is Rudig Stoneheart. I lead what is left of this expedition. We came down here almost a year ago now to kill Paarnax the Dragon, we were the largest expedition to ever make it down the Bore-Hole. At first we were made good progress until we came to a room to the South East of here where an acid river runs through the dungeon. Some tried to cross it and died, and we could find no way past it and through to the caverns beyond."</p>

<p>"There is a way however, as Paarnax's minions used it to kill off our scouts at night, and slowly we had to retreat back towards the entrance. That was when Paarnax revealed his true plan, he has a coven of Necromancers in his employ and they had raised all our dead and charged them against us. We fought for hours and lost many of our own, who were then raised against us. Eventually about 20 of us made it to this room and the room you just came from. That number steadily decreased as we lost scouts and others to Paarnax's minions to those of us you see now."</p>

<p>"Up until a couple of months ago we were able to get scouting parties out of the entrance to the Bore Hole to gather food, and it's just as well we stockpiled it and didn't lose the stockpile when Paarnax's minions attacked us. As the way is now blocked and so we're slowly running out of food, but we reckon we can hold on for a little while longer."</p>

<p>Rudig stopped for a second. "So, I assume you are here to try and succeed where we had failed?"</p>

            <p>Virro: (5) As you suspected Zombie Lords, like other undead, are weak to Healing magic. Seeing Xiv'riit already getting to work in that regard you decide to just fire an arrow at the advancing Zombie Lord. Suddenly you start to feel the Zombie Lords emotions, not really sure what is going on you plan to find out AFTER your former minion has been killed. At the moment of the Zombie Lord's death, you feel it through your link, and decide that you never want to experience that again, the emotions that ran through the Zombie Lord as it died are too overwhelming to really describe.</p>

<p>Fight!: (Virro gets (2 + 2 Dam + 2 Cir = 6) vs Zombie Lord gets (8 + 6 + 3 Arm - 3 Inj = 14) As you pull back your bow to fire you hear the wood creak, almost ready to snap. Firing immediately your underpowered arrow bounces off of the Zombie Lords armour as if it's end wasn't pointed at all. A quick examination of your bow reveals there is now a nice crack down most of the upper arm, and you know you'll either need to find a smith to fix it or get a new bow pronto. Cracked Bow (-2 Dam when firing bow).</p>

<p>Evard: ()</p>

<p>Uriel: (7 - 1 Cir = 6) You manage to connect yourself, Virro and the Zombie Lord together in some kind of basic emotional link, whilst it doesn't help Virro gain control of the Zombie Lord it does give the three of you a feeling for each others emotions, or it would if the Zombie Lord's anger and rage didn't pour forth from its part of the connection and overwhelm whatever emotions you and Virro could sense from one another. At the moment of the Zombie Lord's death, you feel it through your link, and decide that you never want to experience that again, the emotions that ran through the Zombie Lord as it died are too overwhelming to really describe.</p>

<p>Keegra: (11) Leaping at the Zombie Lord once again you instinctively know exactly where to hit to cause maximum damage. Your many fights against the undead have paid off as you now have the ability to almost instantly work out exactly how to take down the undead, and how to dodge their own attacks back at you. Undead Bane (+3 Cir When fighting Undead).</p>

<p>Fight!: (Keegra gets (14 + 5 Dam + 4 Cir = 23) vs Zombie Lord gets (9 + 6 + 3 Arm - 3 Inj = 15) Zombie Lord loses 2 Health. Keegra's second attack gets (10 + 5 Dam + 4 Cir = 19) vs Zombie Lord gets (15) Zombie Lord loses 1 Health. Keegra's third attack gets (16 + 5 Dam + 4 Cir = 25) vs Zombie Lord gets (9 + 6 + 3 Arm - 3 Inj = 15) Zombie Lord loses 7 Health.) Despite your first two hits only being glancing hits as the Zombie Lord seemed to randomly jerk around, trying to dodge the blows that were now coming in from every side, your third takes account for this and smashes into its neck, almost completely severing its head from its body with that one punch.</p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (9 + 2 Cir = 11) Whether or not the Book of Pulp helped or not, you're not sure. What you do know is that for a brief moment time seemed to stand still as you leaped for the Zombie Lord, like Keegra you suddenly find yourself able to work out exactly how to take down Undead in close combat, and with your mighty Spork drawn and ready you found time resuming, as you leapt onto the Zombie Lord's currently unprotected flank (losing that arm certainly didn't help) and set about jabbing the Undead with your Spork. Undead Bane (+2 Cir when fighting Undead).</p>

<p>Fight!: Xiv'riit gets (16 + 3 Dam + 6 Cir = 25) vs Zombie Lord gets (1 + 6 + 3 Arm - 3 Inj = 7). Zombie Lord loses 15 Health. 
Smashing into the Zombie Lord you aim your Spork and hit it with surprising power and accuracy, killing it almost instantly. Zombie Lord dies. Before Virro has any ideas you quickly send a small burst of healing magic at the now deceased Zombie Lord turning it into dust so it can't be resurrected.</p>

<p>Kali: ()</p>

<p>Yeleni: ()</p>

<p>Priya: ()</p>

<p>Davug: (7) Joining in on the all out brawl against the Zombie Lord you swing both Mace and Sword at it.</p>

<p>Fight!: (Davug gets (6 + 1 Dam + 2 Cir = 9) vs Zombie Lord gets (18 + 6 + 3 Arm - 3Inj = 24). Offf-hand Davuge  gets (13 + 2 Dam + 2 Cir = 17) vs Zombie Lord gets (18 + 6 + 3 Arm - 3Inj = 24).
With a swing of your sword you look on in shock as it breaks into tiny pieces when it hits the Zombie Lord Armour, the pieces fly back towards you and you have no time to dodge as they fly into your and ignore your armour (-10 Health). Hurt from the sword shards you don't put your full power into your swing with the mac and it tells as it just bounces off the Zombie Lords armour. You are glad when the Zombie Lord falls, but know that it was not you who did the deed. </p>

<p>Shaban: (7) As your master commands you stand still and watch the fight.</p>

<p>Zombie Lord: (10) As you go down you swing wildly, hitting everyone who is now around you. (</p>

<p>Fight!: (Zombie Lord gets (16 + 4 Dam - 3 Inj = 17) vs Virro gets (6 + 5 + 1 Cir = 12) Virro loses 3 Health. Zombie Lord gets (16 + 4 Dam - 3 Inj = 17) vs Keegra gets (6 + 5 + 4 Cir = 15) Keegra loses 1 Health. Zombie Lord gets (16 + 4 Dam - 3 Inj = 17) vs Xiv'riit gets (1 + 5 + 6 Cir - 1 Arm = 11) Xiv'riit loses 5 Health. Zombie Lord gets (16 + 4 Dam - 3 Inj = 17) vs Davug gets (15 + 6 + 3 = 24) Nothing Happens.) Flailing wildy, the Zombie Lord manages to hit Virro, Xiv'riit and Keegra once before it falls, a quick pulse from Xiv'riit means it won't be getting up again.</p>

<p>"<i>Very</i> well fought," it said drily, raising the equivalent of one eyebrow at the orc. "We shall be sure to call upon you whenever we are faced with the mortal peril of intact weaponry." However, as unimpressed as the shardmind was, it was also aware that they might need everyone they could get at some point in the dungeon, and so it begrudgingly healed the orc's injuries. </p>

            <p>The Orc shakes his head in reply, then says, "<b>Heal quickly. Will be gone soon.</b>" He picks up the Mace lying on the floor. At least the Combat Bonus is the same as the one he received from his sword. He decides he'll keep whatever shards he can salvage, both for their sentimental value and because random shards of metal might come in handy some time. This is a dungeon, after all. Things like that happen all the time. After doing this, he goes to petition Xiv'riit for his help. Meanwhile, Virro has taken the Necromancer's Robe from Shaban, then starts talking (rather loudly) through the door, hoping there's still somebody on the other side to hear him. Should there be anybody in the next room, he attempts to persuade them that the are not, in fact, enemies, and that, if they would be so kind as to step away from the door, he will open it so that both parties can get a good look at each other.</p>

<p>He regained his composure and walked over to the door with the dwarf on the other side. "Ja, we have taken care auf the Zombie-bitter. We will becoming in now. Please don't kill us!" With that, he opened the door.</p>

            <p>Virro: (10) You notice something is slightly off with the Zombie Lord as you watch it go. Suspecting the worst you turn and loose your bow at it, hoping the attack will at least slow it down.</p>

<p>Fight!: (Virro gets (19 +2 Dam +1 Cir = 22) vs Zombie Lord gets (16 + 6 +3 Arm = 25) Zombie Lord wins by 3). Unfortunately for Virro, the arrow just pings off of the Zombie Lords armour and you watch in dismay as it gets within range to strike you down.</p>

<p>Evard: ()</p>

<p>Uriel: (5) You pull off what you think is a wonderful accent. Unfortunately those on the other side don't seem to be able to understand what you said in it. The door opens a crack, and you notice a Dwarf looking through the crack in the door, he seems to see the Zombie Lord and then slams the door shut in your face before anything else can be said. You don't hear anything else from the room.</p>

<p>Keegra: (8) You notice the Zombie Lord making its charge just in time and decide to counter-charge it. Never one to miss a battle you go in all fists flying.</p>

<p>Fight!: (Keegra gets (16 + 5 Dam + 1 Cir = 22) vs Zombie Lord gets (5 + 6 + 3 Arm = 14) Keegra Wins, Zombie Lord loses 5 Health. Second attack, Keegra gets (13 + 5 Dam + 1 Cir = 19) vs Zombie Lord gets (5 + 6 + 3 Arm = 14) Keegra Wins, Zombie Lord loses 5 Health. Third attack, Keegra gets (17 + 5 Dam + 1 Cir = 23) vs Zombie Lord gets (5 + 6 + 3 Arm = 14) Keegra Wins, Zombie Lord loses 6 Health.) You smash into the Zombie Lord and throw punches left and right, weakening it severely.</p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (6) You hear the voices trying to work out exactly what Uriel said, but after the door has been opened a crack and then promptly shut again you cannot hear anymore, they have obviously moved away from the door and so you can no longer hear them.</p>

<p>Kali: ()</p>

<p>Yeleni: ()</p>

<p>Priya: ()</p>

<p>Davug: (3) You watch as the Zombie Lord heads for the door before turning around and charging straight at Virro. You freeze with indecision, not entirely sure what to do. </p>

<p>Shaban: (10) You head into the other room and find a weird black robe on one of the armour stands, picking it up you realize it is magical,but there is no way to know exactly what it does until someone wears it. And seeing as your master did not tell you to wear it you won't. Gained Necromancers Robe (+1 Armour, Other Effects)</p>

<p>Zombie Lord: (12) You start to walk away from Virro. (4) As you do you feel his control over you slipping and you feel free to wreck your revenge, first on Virro then on anything else in your way. With your rage all you can focus on you turn and charge at your former master (+2 Dam in this round of combat). Your hatred of all things living also bubbles through as your limited mind plans to slaughter everything you can (+3 Dam against other Living beings). Mid-Charge you notice an arrow from your former master bounce off your armour and your eagerness to slay him only increases. Whilst your charge is successful, it has put strain on your new body and part of it fails to take the strain. As you lift your off arm to strike down with the Mace it flies off, your undead body now less one limb. (-3 Inj 2 Turns Remaining), fortunately you keep your Mace in the other hand and can still hit with it.</p>

<p>Fight!: (Zombie Lord gets (15 + 6 Dam -3 Inj = 18) vs Virro gets (7 + 5 + 1 Cir = 13). Virro loses 5 Health.) Mace in hand, the Zombie Lord manages to use it against the cowering Virro, even without one of its arms. Still a threat, it ignores the blows raining down on it from Keegra behind and focuses on Virro in front of it. </p>

<p>""I will strike upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.

            <p>Uriel turns to face the Zombie Lord, then contemplates his bladed hand, then shifts his gaze to Virro. He then lowers to a Meditative position, imagining his Eldritch Presence. It's a mess of tendrils, snaking throughout the room, growing heavier around his party's magic users. He sees tendrils that once connected Virro to the Zombie Lord, seeing that some may still be connected.</p>

<p>He focuses his will on the tendrils originating from Virro, attempting to will them to reconnect to the tendrils emerging from the Zombies Lord, in an attempt to restore and strength Virro's command over it. He's also prepared to stop the manipulation should anything unexpected happen (ie, The Zombie gaining control over him).</p>

            <p>He may or may not be cursing the random die roll that forced him to stand by while the zombie charged by him, even though he was attempting to keep watch.  Meanwhile, Virro, who was most certainly <i>not</i> cowering, backs away from the Zombie Lord and begins firing arrows at the creature. "I see this is what you meant. I suppose this new, more powerful version of undead requires more finesse to control," he mutters. He uses his magic to probe the Zombie Lord and see if there are any special techniques he can find while that will give him an edge if he ever finds another of these things. He also makes a note to thank Keegra for interfering on his behalf after he gets rid of this monster. Meanwhile, Shaban does nothing, because he is not about to risk his master's new loot.</p>

            <p>Virro: (10 + 2 Cir = 12) You successfully raise the Zombie, and with a burst of magic you make it stronger than before. You almost feel like you want to laugh as your new creation stitches itself back together and begins to flex its muscles and bend down to pick up the Mace on the floor. Amidst your triumph you fail to notice the Zombie Lord gain a bit of sentience, unknown to you it remembers what happened to it before and wishes to break free of your control.

            <p>"I suppose I should get ready." Virro nocks an arrow in his bow and leaves it ready to either raise and fire at any hostile intruders. If they're not hostile, he'll attempt to persuade, but not to Enthrall, them that they have no reason to attack instead. "Hm. I suppose all of us standing here would be rather inconvenient." He nodded to Shaban, who shuffled away into the first room to look for more equipment, particularly Clothing that conferred an armor bonus. "Now, what was that about my new zombie being different, Xiv'riit?" As he said this, he moved the Zombie Lord in front of the door to help guard it. Davug eyed it suspiciously- he'd learned that sometimes it was hard to tell when certain members of the team were handing over information normally protected by the fourth wall- and decided it was worth more of his attention than the door, so he decided to focus on keeping the new zombie from hurting anybody who wasn't an enemy.</p>

            <p>Virro: (7) An ancient Cosmic being laughs and decides to maybe stop screwing you around, for now at least. Unaware of this however, you fire your bow at Zombie 7. Unfortunately Zombie 2 has broken free of your control and will no longer listen to you.</p>

<p>Fight!: (Virro gets (17 + 2 Dam + 1 Cir = 20) vs Zombie 7 gets (13 + 6 = 19). Zombie 1 loses 1 Health) Despite now having an arrow protruding from its side, Zombie 7 does really not notice it and continues what it was doing, which is, trying to defend against a much greater threat.. </p>

<p>Evard: ()</p>

<p>Uriel: (7 -1Cir = 6) You clumsily throw your mace at Zombie 7 (No Dam bonus during that combat), after all some weapons are not meant to be thrown. Your attempt at getting 'knife-hand' works really well, too well in fact as you find you cannot unwill them and get your hand back to normal. Gained Knife-Hand (+2 Dam when Unarmed, Can only hold items with one hand.)</p>

<p>Fight!: (Uriel's Mace gets (18) vs Zombie 7 gets (15 + 6 = 21) Nothing happens.). </p>

<p>Fight!: (Uriel gets (18 + 3 Cir + 6 Dam = 27) vs Zombie 7 gets (6 + 6 = 12) Zombie 7 loses 14 Health. Critical Hit! Uriel's second hit gets (14) vs Zombie 7 gets (12) Zombie 7 loses 2 Health. Uriel gets a third hit in with his other fist. Uriel gets (17 + 3 Cir + 6 Dam = 26) vs Zombie 7 gets (6 + 6 = 12) Zombie 7 loses 12 Health, Critical Hit! Uriel gets (13) vs Zombie 7 gets (12) Zombie 7 loses 1 Health. Zombie 7 dies.)</p>

<p>You watch your mace miss the zombie, flying past its leg and landing at its feet. your charge is more successful. With fists of fury you beat Zombie 7 into the ground, making sure that it will definitely stay down this time. You vent some of your anger out onto it, even after it is dead and find it is a good stress reliever and punching bag.</p>

<p>Keegra: (7) Launching yourself at Zombie 1 you find yourself giggling with glee, whether it is because you are once again fighting something or because you no longer have to use that stupid accent you're not sure, and to be honest at the moment you don't really care. </p>

<p>Fight!: (Keegra gets (10 + 4 Dam +1 Cir = 15) vs Zombie 1 gets (2 + 6 = 8). Zombie 1 loses 6 Health. Keegra's second attack gets (20 + 4 Dam +1 Cir = 25) vs Zombie 1 gets (2 + 6 = 8). Zombie 1 loses 9 Health. Critical Hit! Keegra gets (13) vs Zombie 1 gets (8). Zombie 1 loses 3 Health. Keegra's third attack gets (17 + 4 Dam +1 Cir = 22) vs Zombie 1 gets (2 + 6 = 8) Zombie 1 loses 14 Health. Critical Hit! Keegra gets (11) vs Zombie 1 gets (8) Zombie 1 loses 2 Health. Zombie 1 dies.)</p>

<p>With great enthusiasm, you launch yourself at the Zombie and smash it into tiny little pieces, all the while grinning like a (slight) maniac. Between this and when you first entered the room you have truly become adept and killing undead with your fists. </p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (7) You successfully scrawl or remember the remaining formula's as you start to attack the Zombie with your faithful Spork.</p>

<p>Fight!: (Xiv'riit gets (16 + 3 Dam + 2Cir = 21) vs Zombie 4 gets (6 + 6 = 12) Zombie 4 loses 6 Health.) Jabbing again and again at the Zombie you seriously wound it with your Spork although you fail to actually kill it.</p>

<p>Kali: ()</p>

<p>Yeleni: ()</p>

<p>Priya: (9) With a dexterous twist of your tail you send the blade of your Monk's Spade into both of the remaining hostile zombies, and thankfully only them. </p>

<p>Fight!: (Priya gets (13 + 4 Dam = 17) vs Zombie 2 gets (8 + 6 = 14) Zombie 2 loses 1 Health.) Lightly nicking it as it tries to jump out of your way, you notice the two zombies still under control of the Necromancer closing in on your first target and hope you do not have to worry about it. </p>

<p>Fight!: (Priya gets (12 + 4 Dam = 17) vs Zombie 4 gets (10 + 6 = 16) Zombie 4 loses 1 Health.) Careful not to  hit your allies you have to twitch your tail at the last second as the studious one gets up to fight, thus you only cause a glancing blow to it despite your best efforts. </p>

<p>Davug: (10) Noticing Zombie 1 getting taken out by the Half-Orc, and admiring her way too much to try and fight alongside her, you'd just get in her way after all. Davug turns his attention to Zombie 4. Jumping over the Monk's Spade that is attached to the Lizardwomen's tail, Davug is able to use this leap to get a bit more force behind his attacks. (+1 Cir this round in combat.)</p>

<p>Fight!: (Davug gets (6 + 1 Dam + 1 Cir = 8) vs (Zombie 4 gets (4 + 6 = 10). Nothing happens) Unfortunately with the leap your aim for your longsword is off and it fails to strike anything.</p>

<p>Fight!: (Davug gets (11 + 2 Dam + 1 Cir = 14) vs Zombie 4 gets (4 + 6 = 10). Zombie 4 loses 4 Health.) Between your Mace's strike, the Shardmind's Spork and the Lizardwomen's Monk's Spade, Zombie 4 falls. Pleased with yourself for winning the battle and your own bit of tactical thinking you watch the rest of the battle. </p>

<p>Shaban: (7) With a groan you launch yourself at the Zombie that has broken free of your masters control, thoughts of doing likewise don't even occur to you.</p>

<p>Fight!: (Shaban gets (20) vs Zombie 2 gets (3 + 6 = 9) Zombie 2 loses 8 Health. Critical Hit! Shaban gets (10) vs Zombie 2 gets (9) Zombie 2 loses 1 Health. Shaban gets (20) vs Zombie 2 gets (9) Zombie 2 loses 9 Health. Critical Hit! Shaban gets (10) vs Zombie 2 gets (9) Zombie 2 loses 1 Health. Zombie 2 dies.) With a fury you haven't used in a while you massacre your fallen comrade..</p>

<p>Zombie 3: (3 - 1 Inj = 2) You Shamble forwards, not looking where you are going, and end up walking into the dangerous part of a Monk's Spade. Zombie 3 loses 8 Health. Splitting you in half, you have no time to think on what just happened before you cease to be... Again. Zombie 3 dies. </p>

<p>Room 4: Where once 8 Zombies waited to attack adventurers, now all have fallen prey to the party, most for a second time. The room itself has three other exits, two on the right hand, West wall, one noticeably nearer than the other, the other exit door is in the East wall two thirds of the way down the room. Where the far wall used to change colour has now been revealed as a secret passageway leading to a door to the South..</p>

Virro turned to the last viable corpse and began working to reanimate it. Davug rolled his eyes and joined Keegra by the door. He nodded at her in acknowledgement of her skill, but otherwise simply waited, weapons drawn. Shaban just did nothing. Virro saw no need to risk his last remaining zombie by making him roll when he had nothing to do.</p>

            <p>Virro: (2) With a burst of magical power you pour your will into all of the remaining corpses and giggle slightly with glee as they all return to life. Unfortunately, they have all risen to life AGAINST you and your party and you will have to fight them again. Even worse, you realize they are impervious to your attempts to control them, and they will be impossible to raise again once you have defeated them this second time. Zombies 1, 4, 7 and 8 all return to 'life' and are hostile to the party.</p>

<p>Evard:() Suddenly the room is no longer as safe as it once was and you flee back into the corridor to the North to hopefully become safe.</p>

<p>Uriel: (4) You search the room more thoroughly but find nothing, apart from four corpses Virro has returned from the dead and somehow set them to be hostile to you.</p>

<p>Keegra: (3) Noticing that only two of the six zombies in the room are on your side you freeze as you try to decide whether opening the door is such a good idea or not. A battle on two fronts is not a strategically good move, no matter how much you lust for battle.</p>

<p>Xiv'riit: ()</p>

<p>Kali:() Suddenly the room is no longer as safe as it once was and you flee back into the corridor to the North to hopefully become safe.</p>

<p>Yeleni:() Suddenly the room is no longer as safe as it once was and you flee back into the corridor to the North to hopefully become safe.</p>

<p>Priya: (12) You manage to grab the Greatsword before it's previous owner comes back from the dead, and noticing it doing so you immediately smash your newly obtained Greatsword into it's head repeatedly. Unfortunately on your last bash you drop the weapon and somehow its blade smashes into loads of tiny pieces which fly everywhere. Most of the pieces hit the zombie and finish it off. However several hit you, finding their way between your armour and into your skin (-10 Health). Well at least you still have your Monk's Spade.</p>

<p>Davug: (8) You head over to loot the bodies, and you are able to get to one Zombie and remove its Leather Armour(Light, +2) and Club(+2) before it rises and starts advancing on you in a decidedly unfriendly manner. However you make no effort to defend as your master has not commanded you to.</p>

<p>Shaban: (4) You stumble to a stop way before the door you were meant to stand in as the zombies rise again to face your master and his friends. You hear their call and wonder which side would be better to join... then you remind yourself of your masters complete control over you and you wonder how you had that thought. </p>

<p>Zombie 2: (6 - 2 Cir = 4) You start to shake free of Virro's control as you see your Zombie friend's rise however you are unable to actually do anything.</p>

<p>Zombie 3: (7 -1Inj = 6) You stumble towards the Eastern door as told to, however you don't quite make it, realizing your fellow Zombie under Virro's will has not moved you move yourself to a position that can overlook both doors if need be... the North-Western corner to be precise.</p>

<p>Zombie 1: (9) You get up and advance on Davug who doesn't seem to be actively defending himself. (+1 Cir until Davug starts to defend). Thankfully (for him) he stripped you of your weapons and armour before you were able to attack him.</p>

<p>Fight!: (Zombie 1 gets (18 + 1Cir = 19) vs Davug (2 + 6 + 3Arm +1Cir = 12). Zombie 1 wins, Davug loses 5 Health). The Zombie  punches and claws away at Davug seemingly randomly, although this tactic does seem to work.</p>

<p>Zombie 4: (7) Getting up, you charge at the nearest living being, ready to kill. That it is the Shardmind that helped kill many of your fellow Zombies just makes it better.</p>

<p>Fight!: (Zombie 4 gets (18) vs Xiv'riit (13 + 5 + 2Cir = 20) Even whilst still working out hypothetical formulas in the dirt, Xiv'riit is able to capably hold off the Zombie, pushing it away with one hand. </p>

<p>Zombie 7: (4) Surprised at your reanimation and even further surprised by the lack of ownership the elven Necromancer has over you, you scream in what you mean to be joy, but most would describe a rage and begin to work out who you want to kill first.</p>

<p>Room 4: Where once 8 Zombies waited to attack adventurers, now all have fallen prey to a Shardmind and a Half-Orc. The two Zombies killed outright by Xiv'riit's blast of healing magic are now nothing but dust. One of the remaining Zombies have been bought back onto the party's side, another has escaped Virro's control and is now hostile. However the other 4, despite having been stripped of loot, have risen again and are hostile to the party, due to a mistake by Virro. The room itself has three other exits, two on the right hand, West wall, one noticeably nearer than the other, the other exit door is in the East wall two thirds of the way down the room. Where the far wall used to change colour has now been revealed as a secret passageway leading to a door to the South..</p>

            <p>"You have <i>got</i> to be kidding," she snarled to herself, watching the zombies come to life around her. And as if fate had been waiting for her to think that things couldn't get any worse, she now had a whole bunch of metal shards lodged in her scales, and no greatsword.</p>

<p>Every movement hurt, and now she found herself surrounded, but she wasn't going down so easily. She still had a long reach and brute strength on her side.</p>

<p>With that comforting thought, she let out a bellowing roar (not unlike that of an alligator) and swung her powerful tail in a wide arc around her, the blade on her monk's spade augmenting her reach and slicing power. Hopefully she'd be able to catch at least one of the zombies with this attack, and then use the opening to escape to the next room...</p>

            <p>Virro: (5) You are able to successfully raise one zombie, although you were aiming for two and the second seems to have collapsed in on itself (and definitely won't get back up). Unfortunately for you, the Zombie you raised was both unarmed and unarmoured, and upon closer inspection you realise that its hands are missing the thumbs, making the likelihood of it being able to hold a weapon very low. Still, at least it's one more minion to throw at others, right? Gained Zombie 3</p>

<p>Evard: () Now that the Room is empty, you move up to Room 4</p>

<p>Uriel: (11) You search through One of the two remaining graves, whilst at first glance the corpse resting inside the grave has nothing of note on its person, you notice the buckle of its belt shining oddly. picking it up you examine it, and seeing it is magical you put it on. You feel strength coursing through your veins, and you feel even more competent with your unarmed training than you did before. Unknown to you, the corpse you looted once belonged to a monk of a long forgotten order, and whilst Keegra was fortunate to loot his apprentice's body, you have had the luck to loot the body of a master monk himself. The belt is a Belt of Advanced Monk Training (+3 Dam when unarmed.)</p>

<p>Keegra: (7) Heading over to the eastern door, you can hear part of a conversation going on on the other side of the door. 
"... you sure?"
"Well, it sure sounds quiet out there, and we all felt that burst of healing magic."
"Let's get ready anyway. It could be a trap."
The voices get quieter as they head away from the door. From the sounds of it the people on the other side of the door may just be friendlies, although you've seen and heard no evidence of a group passing through the Bore-Hole to take on Paarnax before you for quite a while...</p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (4) Awed at the awesome use of your powers over the last couple of turns you start to think of all the different ways you could possibly use this, if you can tap into it again that is. Using the dirt you start to scribble down some equations and hypotheses and try to solidify your understanding of what happened and to work out if you could use this to advance clerical skills the world over, assuming you survive of course. </p>

<p>Kali () Now that the Room is empty, you move up to Room 4</p>

<p>Yeleni: () Now that the Room is empty, you move up to Room 4</p>

<p>Priya: () </p>

<p>Daug: (7) You manage to successfully loot the final grave. Although there is no corpse inside it, there is a set of Leather Armour(+2) and a Mace(+2). The Armour is worse than what you currently have, but the Mace is better than your old longsword, and unless your Master asks otherwise you'll be using your newly found mace as well from now on. </p>

<p>Shaban: (7) You go and obediently stand in the corner. </p>

<p>Zombie 2: (9- 2Cir = 7) You successfully stay under Virro's control, although for some reason you feel like you've only just been placed here...</p>

<p>Zombie 3: (6) You shuffle around uncertain of what to do now that you've fallen under the control of this elven mortal. You don't see one of your old fellows and stub your toe on him (-1 Inj, 4 Turns Remaining)</p>

<p>Room 4: Where once 8 Zombies waited to attack adventurers, now all have fallen prey to a Shardmind and a Half-Orc. The two Zombies killed outright by Xiv'riit's blast of healing magic are now nothing but dust, however the other six still lay on the ground, able to potentially be resurrected. The room itself has three other exits, two on the right hand, West wall, one noticeably nearer than the other, the other exit door is in the East wall two thirds of the way down the room. Where the far wall used to change colour has now been revealed as a secret passageway leading to a door to the South..</p>

Invisibility can be activated once every 4 Rounds (Rounds Remaining 0, Invs ready to activate)), Health 27/23</p>

<p>Uriel: Weapons - Mace(+1), Armour - Sturdy Robes(+1), Other - , Health 33/29</p>

<p>Xiv'riit: Weapons – Spork(+3), Armour - , Other - , Ring of Thur ('Rub thrice and drop it' and a mysterious stranger may arrive to help you for a turn, One use only), Health 25/28</p>

<p>Kali: Weapons - Deer Shot(+3, Deer Fling), Armour - Leather Armour(+1), Other - Deer Fling (Once per room, you may fling a Deer instead of a stone at an enemy. This does +1D8 damage, and the difference between the offence and defence scores (either way) is taken as damage by the Deer. If it survives this it stays around as a permanent companion following your orders), Health 16/12</p>

<p>Yeleni: Weapons - Quarterstaff(+2), Armour - , Other - , Health 30/26</p>

<p>Priya: Weapons - Monk's Spade(+2), Armour - Banded Armour (Heavy, +4), Other - , Health 29/25</p>

Davug sets aside the leather armor, noting that he should give it to one of the zombies just in case, then slings his sword across his back and attaches his Mace to his belt. He goes over to loot the bodies. Virro commands one of the zombies to stand at the Southern and Eastern doors each, hoping they'll be able to serve as some form of guard.</p>

<p>((Thanks for the warning. Davug will pull out both weapons at once, but he doesn't need them now, and holding on to them while searching might actually make it harder.))</p>

            <p>Virro: (8) You manage to successfully use your Necromantic heritage to bring Zombie 2 under your control, however you feel that what is left of its mind is resisting you and you fear you shall not be able to control it forever, and once it does escape your control you will not be able to try and take control of it again. </p>

<p>Evard: ()</p>

<p>Uriel: (10) You loot two of the graves, Besides the remains of two elves in both of them you find a pair of Clubs(+2) and two sets of Leather Armour(+2). Swinging one of the clubs to test it out, you accidentally hit the odd-coloured part of the Southern wall of Room 4 and watch in surprise as the illusion collapses, the corridor continues South for a small bit before stopping at a door with the number 10 on it. </p>

<p>Keegra: (10) Despite how much you want to loot the bodies, there is still a zombie next to you, You decide to smash it to death quickly and THEN loot the bodies. (Fight!: Keegra gets (20 + 4Dam = 24) vs Zombie 2 gets (11 + 6 + 2Arm = 19) Keegra does 5 Damage, Zombie 2 dies) Quickly stomping the Zombie into the dirt (literally) you set about looting, picking up a nice number of teeth (11) from the dead Zombies. Leaning down to loot the now-deceased Zombie, you take it's Leather Armour(+2) and its Club(+2) before noticing its belt, unstrapping it from around its waist and picking it up you feel the magic coming from it. Putting it on you discover it is a Belt of Monk Training(+1Dam when unarmed), normally used by novice monk's who are training to make their fists the deadly force that yours are. </p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (11) Noticing Keegra's continued assault on the Zombie you try to use your healing prowess to aid her. Your magic almost seems to be expecting this and another powerful burst of healing magic goes through the area, affecting those in the starting room, the Orc barracks and the Zombie cemetery as well as the corridor that links the three. (Everyone in the area gains 4 Health, apart from Undead who lose 4 Health, this health can go beyond a persons normal max health.)</p>

Unfortunately you arrive after they had set out and you have always been behind until now. Entering into the starting room, you barely notice the members of the party still in the room, or the fact that the door behind you has slammed shut and seemingly melded back into the wall again. Scampering down the corridor you find yourself in front of Room 4.</p>

<p>Orc Bodyguard (9) Having not been given an order you continue to watch the Half-Orc at work. </p>

<p>Zombie Orc Bodyguard: (8) Shaben waits for its Masters orders.</p>

            <p>She had been hoping to join in on this adventure the moment she heard of what was to come, but a lot of preparations and even more bureacracy had delayed her for far too long. She had a lot of ground to cover before even thinking of jumping into what she figured would be a climactic final boss battle.</p>

<p>Her tail curled around the staff of her weapon as she regarded the bodies littering the area. Would they attack her? Did anyone else in this dungeon have the power to resurrect the lifeless corpses? She couldn't tell. She was ready to battle if she had to, but at least there was more than one exit route, and she could easily fight her way through any attempt to block it off.</p>

<p>Thinking nothing of it, Priya tasted the air around her, and decided to head for the secret passageway as soon as she looted this room. Besides, if someone had accessed it recently, their scent trail must still be fresh. With that in mind, she made a beeline for the greatsword - after all, there's no such thing as being too armed...</p>

Meanwhile, Davug begins searching the room and empty graves for necromantic tools Virro might find useful. Failing that, he will look for armor Virro can use. Shaban stands in a corner and looks at the wall at Virro's command. Perhaps it was a bad zombie?</p>

            <p>Virro: (7) Concentrating on your magic you are able to draw the lifeforce of the dead Orc back into its body. Unfortunately not everything worked as planned as your new Undead Orc Bodyguard seems to have lost quite a few grey cells and is now unable to use any weapon effectively. Also, you know that as an undead he is not able to get any of the skills Orcs normally get. Gained Undead Orc Bodyguard.</p>

<p>Evard: ()</p>

<p>Uriel: (7) You find a pair of bagpipes and go and pick them up, someone obviously thought that with the awful noise they made they were a weapon. Unfortunately, if anything playing the bagpipes is more likely to get you attacked by enemies, not less (they know if you're playing the bagpipes you can't defend yourself as well). Gained Bagpipes (-1 Cir in combat when equipped).</p>

<p>Keegra: (10 - 3Inj =7) Letting out a roar you charge into the group of zombies, the first to feel your wrath isn't armed and only wears some rags on his back.</p>

<p>Fight!: (Keegra vs Zombie 3. Keegra gets (17 + 4 Dam = 21) vs Zombie 3 (3 + 6 = 9) Zombie 3 loses 12 Health. Zombie 3 dies). Smashing one Zombie into the dust as a burst of healing magic flows through you, you feel stronger and ready to take on another Zombie, this one is also unarmed and wears only basic ragged clothing. (Keegra vs Zombie 7. Keegra gets (19 + 4 Dam = 23) vs Zombie 7 (12 + 6= 18) Zombie 7 loses 5 Health.) Between your fists and the burst of healing magic, Zombie 7 falls as well. With one strike left in you, you turn towards a slightly tougher opponent, this Zombie is dressed in some cheap looking hide armour. (Keegra vs Zombie 4. Keegra gets (14 + 4 Dam = 18) vs Zombie 4 (5 + 6 + 1 Arm = 12) Zombie 4 loses 6 Health, Zombie 4 dies). With fists of fury you strike it again and again until you realize there is little left of it. </p>

<p>Xiv'riit (11) Noticing Keegra still limping slightly as she charged into the zombies, you focus your healing magics and let them loose. Not only do you heal Keegra's ankle just before she starts fighting, you also let loose a slightly uncontrolled burst of healing magic that spreads out around you. You feel stronger and you are sure Keegra and the Orc Bodyguard are feeling better as well. As most people know, what is good for the living is not good for the undead and your erratic burst of magic damages them all, killing two outright, and letting Keegra finish off two more. (Zombies 2-8 lose 8 Health, Keegra, Orc Bodyguard, Xiv'riit gain 8 Health, all injuries cured before battle.)</p>

<p>Kali ()</p>

<p>Yeleni: ()</p>

<p>Priya: () Having heard of the group of adventurers planning to conquer the Bore-Hole and beat Paarnax, you headed out from your homeland to join them. Unfortunately you arrive after they had set out and you have always been behind until now. Entering into the starting room, you barely notice the members of the party still in the room, or the fact that the door behind you has slammed shut and seemingly melded back into the wall again. Scampering down the corridor you find yourself in front of Room 4. </p>

<p>Orc Bodyguard (6) You make it to the door, but seeing the Half-Orc taking on the zombie quite capably by herself you decide to stop and stare, I mean watch her. </p>

<p>Zombie Orc Bodyguard: (7) Shaben successfully gets up this time. </p>

<p>Zombie 2: (4) Noticing the Half-Orc tear through its fellow zombies with the aid of magic, Zombie 2 stands still in fright. Hoping to be mistaken for anything but a Zombie. </p>

<p>Zombie 8: (7) Zombie 8 decides the best things to do is to attack. And with Keegra being the only viabe target, it decides that to try and gett revenge for its comrades.</p>

<p>Fight!: (Zombie 8 vs Keegra. Zombie 8 gets (1 + 2 Dam = 3) vs Keegra gets (10 + 6 = 16)). Hardly even aware of the Zombie trying to attack her, Keegra stretches lazily from her round of killing and mayhem and manages to snag herself yet another kill as her fist connects with the zombie and kills it. </p>

<p>Room 4: Where once 8 Zombies waited to attack adventurers, now all bar one had fallen prey to a Shardmind and a Half-Orc. The two Zombies killed outright by Xiv'riit's blast of healing magic are now nothing but dust, however the other five still lay on the ground, able to potentially be resurrected. The room itself has three other exits, two on the right hand, West wall, one noticeably nearer than the other, the other exit door is in the East wall two thirds of the way down the room. The far wall changes colour for a little bit roughly opposite the door you entered through. </p>

            <p>((Sorry I haven't updated this in almost a week now. I honestly forgot about it on Tuesday and then I've been ill since Wednesday (and busy since Thursday, which isn't a nice mix). Round 9 WILL begin 48 hours after this goes out, and I will try my damned best to keep this up (although things may get a bit iffy around Christmas, we'll see). Anyway, onto the dice rolling.))</p>

<p>Virro: (10) You start your well practiced speech on the good points of joining up with you and your group. Even without your bodyguard's sword at his neck, you see that the second Orc is truly listening to your speech and is nodding (as much as it can) along to your points. In fact, you've managed to somehow hire yourself a second Orc bodyguard! Gained Orc Bodyguard 2. (you can give them names you know, just don't get too attached to them).</p>

<p>Evard: ()</p>

<p>Uriel: (3) You manage to get yourself ready for anything. You just forgot that you were planning to go to the door Keegra had been holding shut before you got yourself ready for anything. On the plus side you manage to get what you thought was the Studded Leather Armour on. Turns out it was just some quite Sturdy Robes, but you are confused about how you could not tell the two apart. </p>

<p>Keegra: (9 - 3Inj +1Cir = 7) You manage to limp down the corridor to the door and brace yourself in such a way that the door should remain shut.</p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (11) You manage to successfully focus your healing magics on yourself. Feeling the magic coursing through your veins and healing you, you manage to feel much better and much more invigorated. Gained +9 Health, Invigorated (+2 Cir 3 Turns remaining). </p>

<p>Kali: ()</p>

<p>Yeleni: ()</p>

<p>Orc Bodyguard: (8) At Virro's command you stand over your fellow Orc and manage to look really threatening, holding your blade just over the other Orc's neck. (-1 Cir for Orc 2 this turn)</p>

<p>Orc Bodyguard 2: (7 - 6Inj -1 Cir = 0) Convinced by Virro to become his bodyguard, despite your injuries you start to get up, thinking that everything is OK know. Unfortunately that is the last thought that enters your brain as you manage to kill yourself on your fellow Orc's blade that was still right above your neck. On the plus side you gain a Darwin Award posthumously. Lose -22 Health, Dead.</p>

<p>Room 4: (11) With Keegra now firmly holding the door closed, the occupants of Room 4 do not realise that getting out of their room through the door to the northern corridor has now become that much harder. But that does not stop them from trying. One is lucky enough and manages to knock a hole in the door, unfortunately it loses its head over this fact (quite literally).</p>

<p>Characters:</p>

<p>Virro: Weapons - Shortbow(+2) Quiver(38 Arrows), Armour - , Other - (+1 Cir when guarding a door or doorway), Orc Bodyguard (You control what your Orc Bodyguard does each round), Health 26/26</p>

<p>Evard: Weapons - Dagger(+2), Dagger(+1), Armour - Studded Leather Armour(+4, Invisibility), Other - Invisibility (Can turn invisible for one round (counts as a passive action), Cannot be noticed or attacked by enemies whilst invisible, +1 Circumstance when attacking whilst invisible. Invisibility can be activated once every 4 Rounds (Rounds Remaining 1)),  Health 23/23</p>

<p>Uriel: Weapons - Mace(+1), Armour - Sturdy Robes(+1), Other - , Health 29/29 </p>

<p>Keegra: Weapons - , Armour - , Other - Ring of Thur ('Rub thrice and drop it' and a mysterious stranger may arrive to help you for a turn, One use only), Bloody Ankle (-3 Inj 1 Turns Remaining), Health 18/22</p>

<p>Xiv'riit: Weapons – Spork(+3), Armour - , Other - , Ring of Thur ('Rub thrice and drop it' and a mysterious stranger may arrive to help you for a turn, One use only), Health 13/28</p>

<p>Kali: Weapons - Deer Shot(+3, Deer Fling), Armour - Leather Armour(+1), Other - Deer Fling (Once per room, you may fling a Deer instead of a stone at an enemy. This does +1D8 damage, and the difference between the offence and defence scores (either way) is taken as damage by the Deer.

<p>Virro files away this information, then says, "Nevertheless, this is not a complete loss. I do try to have a second plan ready, just in case the first goes sour." He pulls out a variety of tools from his belt and exchanges his black gloves for a set of dark red ones. He begins attempting to resurrect the fallen Orc. The living Orc decides his time would be better spent helping his new allies, and turns to walk through the door and begin fighting the undead. "Davug!" Virro calls after him. "If you would be so kind, try not to end the undead unless it's necessary. I believe I can use them once I'm done here." Davug nods and proceeds to the other room, ready to fight.</p>

<p>[Virro attempts to resurrect the Orc on the ground, Davug (A.K.A. Orc Bodyguard, then Orc Bodyguard 1, then just Orc Bodyguard again,) goes to the other room to fight the zombies. I think it's zombies. He tries to incapacitate rather than completely destroy, but if it comes down to him or the zombie, it's the zombie that's gonna die.]</p>

            <p>Virro: (7) Waiting at, not guarding the door you are fully ready to let the Orc hear the power of your voice. Unfortunately for you (and no matter how well you roll) the Orc can't hear your voice yet.</p>

<p>Evard: (8) You move into position and continue to admire Keegra's muscles, Readying up to attack the Orc you are fully prepared to leap into action (+1 Cir next round)</p>

<p>Uriel: (5) You find a piece of armour that certainly makes you look good, even if it isn't as well armoured as perhaps you'd like it to be. Gained Leather Armour(+1)</p>

<p>Keegra: (9) You brace yourself and manage to hold the door closed, ready to push back against any attempt to open it. When the time is right you manage to pull the door open and send Orc 2 sprawling on the floor (-2 Cir), in a position almost anyone could take advantage of. </p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (2) Still tired from your earlier battle you try to heal Keegra as best you can. However you manage to muddle your actions up, kicking the sword (rather hard) at Keegra and trying to heal Virro's new Orc Bodyguard instead. Given Keegra's tendency to not wear anything armoured, and your own bad luck, it perhaps should not be surprising that the sword manages to hit Keegra in the ankle, causing an injury (-3 Inj 2 Turns Remaining). Your attempts to heal the Orc Bodyguard don't succeed either and instead you (somehow) manage to transfer the damage done to your body (that has not been healed) to the Orc Bodyguard in return for the damage done to him (Xiv'riit -7 Health, Orc Bodyguard +7 Health)</p>

<p>Kali: (8) Like the Tako on the other side of the door you are fully ready for the Orc that is trying to get in (and will probably continue to try until Keegra gives in). Conscious of the proximity of your allies you have chosen to use a normal shot from your sling. (+1 Cir next round)</p>

<p>Yeleni: Still in shock you don't move a muscle.</p>

<p>Orc Bodyguard: (10) Thanking the Shardmind who partially healed him, the Orc Bodyguard picks up the sword now near Keegra's bloody ankle, licking the blood from it, the Orc seems to be slightly healthier strangely. (+4 Health)</p>

<p>Orc 2: (8 - 2Cir -4 Inj = 2) When Keegra unexpectedly opened the door Orc 2 flew through and accidentally landed on its Mace, Damaging itself and causing it to lose 9 Health. In landing on its own Mace it also manages to break the weapon so completely it cannot be used again. In addition to this, the fall also injures the Orc, causing it to suffer from a bad injury (-2 Inj, 3 Turns Remaining).    </p>

<p>Room 4: (4) Whatever occupies Room 4 continues to try and beat down the door between it and the corridor to no avail. </p>

<p>Characters:</p>

<p>Virro: Weapons - Shortbow(+2) Quiver(38 Arrows), Armour - , Other - (+1 Cir when guarding a door or doorway), Orc Bodyguard (You control what your Orc Bodyguard does each round), Health 26/26</p>

<p>Evard: Weapons - Dagger(+2), Dagger(+1), Armour - Studded Leather Armour(+4, Invisibility), Other - Invisibility (Can turn invisible for one round (counts as a passive action), Cannot be noticed or attacked by enemies whilst invisible, +1 Circumstance when attacking whilst invisible. Invisibility can be activated once every 4 Rounds (Rounds Remaining 1)), (+1 Cir next round). Health 23/23</p>

<p>Uriel: Weapons - Mace(+1), Armour - Leather Armour(+1), Other - , Health 29/29</p>

<p>Keegra: Weapons - , Armour - , Other - Ring of Thur ('Rub thrice and drop it' and a mysterious stranger may arrive to help you for a turn, One use only), Bloody Ankle (-3 Inj 2 Turns Remaining), Health 18/22</p>

<p>Xiv'riit: Weapons – Spork(+3), Armour - , Other - , Ring of Thur ('Rub thrice and drop it' and a mysterious stranger may arrive to help you for a turn, One use only), Health 13/28</p>

<p>Kali: Weapons - Deer Shot(+3, Deer Fling), Armour - Leather Armour(+1), Other - Deer Fling (Once per room, you may fling a Deer instead of a stone at an enemy. This does +1D8 damage, and the difference between the offence and defence scores (either way) is taken as damage by the Deer. If it survives this it stays around as a permanent companion following your orders), (+1 Cir next round), Health 12/12</p>

<p>Yeleni: Weapons - Quarterstaff(+2), Armour - , Other - , Health 26/26</p>

<p>Orc Bodyguard: Weapons - Longsword(+1), Armour - Studded Leather Armour(+3), Other- , Health 24/26</p>

<p>Orc 2: Weapons - , Armour - Leather Armour (Light +2), Other- Concussion (-4Inj 2 turns remaining), Bad Fall (-2 Inj, 3 Turns Remaining) Health 7/16</p>

Even more unfortunately for the Orc, during it's charge it smashed its head into the door, buckling the wood on the other side. This gives it a really bad concussion (-4 Inj, 2 turns remaining)</p>

            <p>Two rounds, in fact. She was nervous. Her daggers had done little to halt the Orc's charge. However, she wasn't done yet; a kill would certainly improve her standing in Keegra's eyes. So she prepared. She noticed Keegra bracing against the door and took up a position on the hinge side, as if the door did burst open she would be hidden from the other Orc's view. A knife or two in the neck would probably be helpful for the group's goals.</p>

<p>And it wasn't just an excuse to look at the way Keegra's shoulder muscles moved as she held the door shut. Why would you even think that?</p>

We may air our grievances once we have defeated the foes at hand, and believe me, I have some of my own I will be releasing." He shot an irritated look at the Shardmind. The Orc grumbled and cast a glare at the Shardmind, but decided to listen to the Elf. He knelt and picked up the sword, ready to do battle to defend the Elf. Said Elf was thinking carefully. "That sounded like a rather hard knock," he said to himself. "I believe... yes, I believe I may be able to do so twice. Bloodfist, would you mind stepping away from the door?"</p>

            <p>Virro: (8) Looking around on the weapon racks, you see a nicely crafted shortbow, picking it up you also select a quiver from another rack nearby that contains 38 arrows. Confident with your new weapon you turn your attention back to the rest of the room. Gained Shortbow(+2), Quiver(38 arrows).</p>

<p>Evard: ()</p>

<p>Uriel: (11 +1Cir = 12) Kneeling down, you inspect your fellow Shardmind's wounds, studying them you think you know how to heal them, and so without hesitating you do. However the strain upon both you and Xiv'riit is great, and leaves you both tired and exhausted. Xiv'riit gains 10 Health, Xiv'riit gains Tired (-2 Inj, 2 turns remaining, counts from next turn onwards), Uriel gains Exhausted (Can't do anything next turn)</p>

<p>Keegra: (7) Standing down you strain your hearing as you listen out for any more Orcs. You think you hear the sound of another Orc moving about in the room at the end of the corridor, but you're not sure if that Orc is the only one or if there are more around. As you try to listen closer, the door halfway down the corridor seems to shake with repeated <em>thuds</em> as if something is trying to shove the door open.</p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (3) Still tired from your battering, and noticing Uriel heading over to try and help you, you stay where you are, although you do succeed in picking up the Orc's longsword. Gained Longsword(+1)</p>

<p>Kali: (9) Skipping past the Orc you position yourself in the doorway leading to the corridor, with your keen Halfling senses you notice movement in the room that the Orc came from, and can only sense a single Orc remaining in that room. </p>

<p>Yeleni: Still in shock you don't move a muscle. </p>

<p>Orc Bodyguard: You stand stock still, not knowing quite what the person who hired you was on about, you responded with a series of grunts and groans, but seeing as he hasn't asked you to do anything yet, you assume what you're doing is good enough.</p>

<p>Room 2: (7) A single entity makes itself known at the entrance to the Eastern room, a second Orc. Seeing it's fellow Orc standing there and not fighting the adventurers it is not sure what to do and so continues to stand in the doorway</p>

<p>Room 4: (6) There is a muffled moan as the door to the room halfway down the corridor once again goes thud as something hits it from the other side.</p>

<p>Characters:</p>

<p>Virro: Weapons - Shortbow(+2) Quiver(38 Arrows), Armour - , Other - (+1 Cir when guarding a door or doorway), Orc Bodyguard (You control what your Orc Bodyguard does each round), Health 26/26</p>

<p>Evard: Weapons - Dagger(+2), Dagger(+1), Armour - Studded Leather Armour(+4, Invisibility), Other - Invisibility (Can turn invisible for one round (counts as a passive action), Cannot be noticed or attacked by enemies whilst invisible, +1 Circumstance when attacking whilst invisible. Invisibility can be activated once every 4 Rounds (Rounds Remaining 4)). Health 23/23</p>

<p>Uriel: Weapons - Mace(+1), Armour - , Other - Tea, Exhausted (Can't do anything next turn), Health 29/29</p>

<p>Keegra: Weapons - , Armour - , Other - Ring of Thur ('Rub thrice and drop it' and a mysterious stranger may arrive to help you for a turn, One use only), Health 18/22</p>

<p>Xiv'riit: Weapons – Spork(+3), Longsword(+1) Armour - , Other - Tired (-2 Inj, 2 turns remaining, counts from next turn onwards), Ring of Thur ('Rub thrice and drop it' and a mysterious stranger may arrive to help you for a turn, One use only), Health 20/28</p>

<p>Kali: Weapons - Deer Shot(+3, Deer Fling), Armour - Leather Armour(+1), Other - Deer Fling (Once per room, you may fling a Deer instead of a stone at an enemy. This does +1D8 damage, and the difference between the offence and defence scores (either way) is taken as damage by the Deer. If it survives this it stays around as a permanent companion following your orders), Health 12/12</p>

<p>Yeleni: Weapons - Quarterstaff(+2), Armour - , Other - , Health 26/26</p>

<p>Orc Bodyguard: Weapons - , Armour - Studded Leather Armour(+3), Other- , Health 13/26</p>

            <p>((Whilst the combat will appear to go sequentially dependent on the characters position in the order of things, so long as Orc 1 has health we will assume for this (and all) combats that they are actually happening simultaneously)) </p>

<p>Virro: (10 - 4Cir = 6) Approaching the Orc, you use your skill with words to try and enthrall him onto your side (20). You succeed in making him believe that, not only is your side in the right but that he is actually your personally bodyguard. Unfortunately your fellow adventurers ignore your pleas for them to calm down and not fight the Orc and so you watch as all your work may be for nothing. Gained (if he survives this round) Orc Bodyguard.</p>

<p>((P.S you can try and enthrall anybody who isn't a PC))</p>

<p>Evard: (6 + 3Cir = 9) You are able to successfully flank the Orc and make use of your natural instinct to backstab any enemy you see. You do so well at the charge you are able to put some of your momentum into hitting the Orc harder than normal (+1 Damage this Round)</p>

<p>Combat!: (Evard vs Orc 1. Evard gets 10 (2 + 3Cir + 5Dam) vs Orc 1 gets 12 (4 + 6 + 3Arm - 1Cir) Nothing happens. Evard's second attack: Evard gets 19 (12+ 3Cir + 4Dam) vs Orc 1 gets 12 (4 + 6 + 3Arm - 1Cir) Orc loses 7 Health) Despite your best efforts as you rush to the Orc's left flank whilst trying to get into the best backstabbing position, you don't aim your blows as perfectly as you might otherwise do. Whilst the Orc's armour seems to take your first blow, your second pierces the armour and strikes the Orc in its side. As a result you hear the Orc let out a loud cry of pain. That must have hurt.</p>

<p>Uriel: (7) You succeed in stepping up to the Orc and get ready to protect your fellow Shardmind from its attacks. Deciding to forgo your mace this time, you use the abilities you gained when you trained as a Brawler to your advantage.</p>

<p>Combat!: (Uriel vs Orc 1. Uriel gets 13 (11 + 2Cir) vs Orc 1 gets 11 (3 + 6 + 3Arm - 1Cir) Orc 1 loses 2 Health. Uriel's second attack: Uriel gets 6 (4 + 2Cir) vs Orc 1 gets 11 (3 + 6 + 3Arm - 1Cir) Nothing Happens) Charging in with the others, you get a good couple of hits off against the Orc, surprising it. Whilst this does manage to get its attention off of Xiv'riit it now turns it attention to you.</p>

<p>Keegra: (8 - 1Inj = 7) You succeed in getting up and charging into the fray, noticing others charging in alongside you makes you angry. You are the Vanguard, you should charge in alone, this anger helps focus you and clear the headache bought on by your concussion.</p>

<p>Kombat!: (Keegra vs Orc 1. Keegra gets 11 (9 + 3Dam - 1Inj) vs Orc 1 gets 25 (16 + 6 + 3Arm), Keegra loses 4 Health. Keegra's second attack: Keegra gets 19 (17 + 3Dam - 1Inj) vs Orc 1 gets 25 (16 + 6 + 3Arm), Nothing Happens. Keegra's third attack: Keegra gets 21 (19 + 3Dam - 1Inj) vs Orc 1 gets 25 (16 + 6 + 3Arm), Nothing Happens.) Your first punchlands badly the Orc moves slightly and so instead of his gut, your strike hits longsword, cutting your arm slightly. The sight of your own blood makes you forget tactics and go for 2 wild blows, neither of which seem to faze the Orc.</p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (3) as badly wounded as you are, there is no way you can do anything but back up and take a breather, angry at the Orc and whichever divine force put you in its path in the first place. </p>

<p>Kali: (11)  Your mantra as you look through the weapon racks seems to be twisted by magic itself as you feel drawn towards one particular sling. Holding it you recognise it as the Deer Shot, a weapon created by a particularly sadistic Halfling Ranger. Every so often instead of the pebble that you load the sling up with, the sling will fire a full size, live, Deer at the target at the same speed the stone would have come out of. Happy with your acquisition you prepare to help your allies in the battle. Gained Deer Shot(+3Dam, Deer Fling)  </p>

<p>Yeleni: Surprised at the sudden combat you stand around, unable to move or do anything to help your team mates.</p>

<p>Orc 1: (6) Excited to be in such a large combat you yell something back down the hall before continuing to fight. </p>

<p>Combat: (Orc 1 vs Uriel. Orc 1 gets 2 (2 + 1Dam - 1Cir) vs Uriel gets 14 (7 + 5 + 2Arm) Orc 1 loses 4 Health) In his (futile) attempt to get at the Shardmind he had attacked rather than the one who was now in his way, Orc 1 decide to put his head down and charge. That was his first mistake. Unlike the Shardmind he originally attack, this one was made of crystal and so a headfirst charge alongside a waving sword, doesn't work that well against it, in fact it is highly likely the Orc suffered some kind of damage at least to his skull (good thing he is from now on enthralled to follow someone else's orders, huh?). In the midst of this the Orc also manage to drop his sword on the floor. Leaving it for anyone to pick up.</p>

<p>Characters:</p>

<p>Virro: Weapons - , Armour - , Other - (+1 Cir when guarding a door or doorway), Orc Bodyguard (You control what your Orc Bodyguard does each round), Health 26/26</p>

<p>Evard: Weapons - Dagger(+2), Dagger(+1), Armour - Studded Leather Armour(+4, Invisibility), Other - Invisibility (Can turn invisible for one round (counts as a passive action), Cannot be noticed or attacked by enemies whilst invisible, +1 Circumstance when attacking whilst invisible.

            <p>Kali held up the Deer Shot, grinning maniacally. She spun towards the marauding Orc, readying a shot. "HAVE AT THEE THOU REEKING--um, are we are not attacking him?" Disappointed, Kali lowered her sling. "Oh. Well, then. To the next room, I suppose!" With a nauseating--due to the way it wafted up the scent of her feet--skip in her step, Kali went to the Eastern door, standing behind and slightly to the side of the Orc Bodyguard, ready to shoot down the hall when the chance came.</p>

            <p>He speaks quietly to the Orc (who shall remain nameless until he can share his own name with the audience), who growls something in reply. Virro speaks once more, and the Orc growls again. Virro says something more insistently, and the Orc shakes his head firmly. The Elf sighs, and backs out of the line of sight of the door, the Orc positioning himself in front of him, readying himself to defend Virro from any danger.</p>

<p>"I shall try to act more quickly next time, Uriel," he says to the green Shardmind. "I am afraid circumstances conspired to prevent my actions from taking place when they should have. I have taken steps to rectify this." He then turns to search the arms racks, hoping this short interlude will give him time to find a weapon, again, preferably a bow, but anything would do at the moment.</p>

            <p>"Another group of 'adventurers' have arrived." The figure that spoke was crouched over a divining pool. watching as it showed the room the party were in. Their figure was hidden by a long hooded robe. "They seem less experienced than the previous ones who came. Shall I release the gas my lord?"</p>

<p>"No, child. Let them come. Although I doubt they will do little more than expand our army of undead, it is still refreshing to see some more morsels come to the challenge." </p>

<p>"Very well, my lord. Is that why you removed their equipment?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my child. They would of been no challenge with the rubbish they had. At the very least now we can enjoy a challenging hunt. Is the pool set up to see each of the rooms?"</p>

<p>"Yes my lord."</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Virro: (3) You look around for some kind of ranged weapon on the weapon racks. Noticing a few bows you can't quite make up your mind which one you want.</p>

<p>Evard: (11) You find a fine piece of Studded Leather Armour, specifically made for Tako's. You put it on and feel the magic wash over you as you do so. Looking down, you realise you have briefly become invisible, a real boon for a Rogue like you. Gained Studded Leather Armour(+4, Invisibility) </p>

<p>Uriel: (6) Noticing that Evard has picked up the only 2 daggers from the wall, and seeing as you are currently unable to see the Tako to ask if you can borrow one, you instead decide to pick up a small mace that catches your eye. Turning back to your teapot, before you can do anything you notice a droplet of liquid falling from the ceiling and landing in the spout of the teapot, sliding down and mixing with the tea itself. Rushing over you open the lid but cannot smell or see anything wrong with the tea. Gained Mace(+1), Tea</p>

<p>Keegra: (2) Heading over to the Eastern door you trip up and smack your head against the door, even with your thick skull it hurts and the door doesn't come away fine either, not only is it forced open it also has a hole in it where your head hit it. (-1 Injury, 1 round remaining). Unfortunately the noise of your crash seems to reverberate through the dungeon, and the door at the other end of the corridor opens. Out steps an Orc... Gained Concussion (-1 Injury, 1 round remaining)</p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (8) Guarding the Southern doorway, you hear Keegra trip over, and decide to check if she is OK. Moving to the Eastern doorway you Notice she has banged her head and is slowly getting up off the floor. You notice the Orc at the other end of the corridor and step in front of where Keegra is stand, bravely brandishing your Spork and preparing to see what the Orc will do.</p>

<p>Kali: (6) Despite your searching, you can only find one piece of armour than you can wear that is both light for you to use, and small enough for a Halfling. It looks a bit old and as if it's been in a few fights, but it'll still help protect you, and that's what matter, right? Gained Leather Armour(+1)</p>

<p>Yeleni: (5) Searching rather randomly, as if you're not quite sure what you are looking for, you come across a nice Quarterstaff. Pleased with your find, you notice the Orc at the end of the Eastern corridor and wonder if you're going to put your new weapon to use soon. Gained Quarterstaff(+2)</p>

<p>Orc 1: (11 - 1Cir = 10) Noticing the adventurers at the other end of the corridor, Orc 1 grunts something in his native language before charging towards the fallen Keegra. Thankfully Xiv'riit gets in the way before Orc 1 can take on the fallen and concussed Half-Orc</p>

<p>Combat!: (Orc 1 vs Xiv'riit. Orc 1 gets 21 (20 + 1 Damage) vs Xiv'riit gets 7 (2 + 5) Xiv'riit loses 14 Health. As a natural 20, Orc 1 gets a second attack, 11 vs 7, Xiv'riit loses a further 4 Health.) 
Many elves and dwarves know how lethal an Orc charge can be, having fought against the barbarians dozens of times in the past. This Orc must either be a veteran of one of those charges, or have been taught exactly how to charge as he smashes into Xivriit, managing to get two attacks off against the Shardmind as it can barely move in terror. The Orc's Longsword gouges a large wound in the Shardmind's side, before the second hit smashes into the Shardmind's shield arm. Things do not look good for the Shardmind, and the Orc knows it.</p>

<p>Characters:</p>

<p>Virro: Weapons - , Armour - , Other - (+1 Cir when guarding a door or doorway), Health 26/26 </p>

<p>Evard: Weapons - Dagger(+2), Dagger(+1), Armour -  Studded Leather Armour(+4, Invisibility), Other - Invisibility (Can turn invisible for one round (counts as a passive action), Cannot be noticed or attacked by enemies whilst invisible, +1 Circumstance when attacking whilst invisible. Invisibility can be activated once every 4 Rounds (Rounds Remaining 4)). Health 23/23</p>

<p>Uriel: Weapons - Gained Mace(+1), Armour - , Other - Tea, Health 29/29</p>

<p>Keegra: Weapons - , Armour - , Other - Concussion (-1 Injury, 1 round remaining), Health 22/22</p>

            <p>The tako hurriedly pulled on her new armour, hefted her daggers, and slipped around to try and flank the Orc. Thankfully, it was distracted trying to gut something that didn't have any guts, so it didn't immediately register Evard or her daggers until both were heading towards its back at pace. So incensed was she that she even tried to pummel the Orc with her remaining free tentacle. How dare it seek to attack Keegra when she was knocked prone? How <i>DARE</i> it?</p>

            <p>Virro Deverin: (10) You are an excellent door guard. None have stood as vigiliant as you in an age, watching the door in case any evil would dare to walk through. Thankfully none does, and as the time passes you get the feeling that perhaps, none will. After all this is less off an action and more a reaction is it not? Still with your newfound expertise you think you may be even more valuable to the party than before (+1 Cir when guarding a door or doorway).</p>

<p>Evard Black (6) Looking at all the weapons you are almost sad when you realize that you can only see two daggers on the wall. Regardless you pick them up, testing their weight, you are happy with them, but you wonder if you should pick up some armour, or at the very least something to hold the daggers in. (Gained Dagger +2, Dagger +1).</p>

<p>Uriel Seraphim: (8) You set up your tea set expertly, making sure everything is perfectly in place for a nice reinvigorating brew. As the water boils you search the room high and low to see if it has any secrets. Unfortunately for you, this room does not. Still, as they say "a watched pot never boils." And you certainly want yours to boil so you can have some tea.</p>

<p>Keegra Bloodfist: (8) Some of the pieces of armour you recognise, others you don't. The ones you do are made by world-renowned smiths of all races, whoever collected these pieces for you to use certainly didn't discriminate against race when they were picking them. The armour ranges from well made pieces of plate armour, all the way to what looks like normal pieces of clothing, and almost everything in between. Your gut instinct also tells you that not only is not one piece of this armour cursed or meant to harm the party in any way, it is almost as if someone wants the party to have this armour. You assume the same can be said of the weaponry.</p>

<p>Xiv'riit: (9) Looking over the racks of weapons you spot one that looks perfect for you. Reaching up to grab it, you lift it down and look at your wondrous new weapon. It is only as you look at it you see the stylized R engraved into the hilt. This must be the legendary Spork of Rogmarys, the ancient Dwarven hero who was said to be able to beat entire armies by himself, and when the battle was done would sit down, and with this Spork eat an entire pig by himself. What is that you say? It must be hard to eat an entire pig with just a Spork? Well, you my friend obviously did not know Rogmarys. (Gained Spork(+3)) </p>

<p>Kali Bunga: (10) Seeing Uriel check the room you are in to no avail, you decide to see if you can use your tracking skill to determine what lays beyond the eastern door. Turning your attention that way you use your highly honed senses to almost completely map the place out. It is an empty corridor, and just like on the map it only has two exits, one at the end of the corridor, and one halfway down on the right.

            <p>"Two daggers. Hm. They seem... fairly magical." Evard tossed them from limb to limb, juggling the daggers rather well for someone who wasn't terribly experienced at fighting on dry land. "Though that might just be the One and Two inscribed on the blades. A shame there wasn't another. Now I just need some equipment - my own weapon oils will only stretch so far, for one."</p>

<p>Evard padded off, oddly silent on the stone floor save for the occasional <i>schlup</i> as her suckers kept her upright. Her plan was to search through the rest of the racks and find some armour made for tako, or at least something a bit nicer than her rather dowdy travelling clothes.</p>

            <p>"You are a group of fresh-faced adventurers, believing you can take on anyone, or anything. You have heard tale of the great Dragon Paarnax and his hoard, hidden amidst the treacherous caverns of the Bore-Hole. Wanting to prove yourselves as true adventurers you have grouped up and set off to kill this dragon and claim his hoard for yourselves. You have heard tales of how large the hoard Paarnax has that it can no longer be contained within his lair alone. Instead he has spread it through out the Bore-Hole, protected by a legion of monsters that swear fealty to the Dragon himself. You have also heard tale of how adventurers before you have fallen not just to this legion of monsters but also to the very caverns themselves, with various chambers seemingly created specifically to trap and kill any who wander into them. Undaunted you have set out, not knowing what you will face but determined you will make it to the bottom and kill the great Dragon Paarnax...</p>

<p>Entering the first chamber, you see a sight that surprises you. Against and on the north wall stands rows upon rows of armour stands and weapon racks, holding almost every type of armour and weapon imaginable. Hearing a slam you notice that the hole in the West Wall that you used as an entrance has now slammed shut, trapping you in the Bore-Hole until you defeat Paarnax, or die trying. Looking down, you see that you have mysteriously been stripped of all your weapons and armour you had before you entered this room. There are two other ways to exit the room, one is the passage way to the South, which you see ends at a door and also has an indentation halfway down on the left, which you assume is another doorway. There is also a door in the Eastern wall that no doubt leads to a passageway beyond. </p>

<p>It is, perhaps, the lone picture frame on the Southern wall that intrigues you the most, and indeed most of you crowd around it. In the picture frame there is a map, supposedly showing the entire dungeon. The room you are in is labeled the 'Starting Room' and there is another chamber in the North-East corner of the map titled 'Paarnax's Lair' your ultimate destination perhaps. Taking a look at the map some of you recognize two of the rooms which are meant to hold treasure, although it is strange that your sources, reliable ones at that, told you that Paarnax had split his hoard into seven pieces, yet including his lair, only three of those places appeared on the map.</p>

<p>It is, of no worry, for surely you will succeed and defeat Paarnax. After all, What Are The Chances Of This Happening Again?"</p>

<p>Map: <a href="https://s11.postimg.org/lujjtqkub/SWATCOTHA_Public_Map.png">https://s11.postimg.org/lujjtqkub/SWATCOTHA_Public_Map.png</a> ((Will make it an actual image instead of a link once I work out how to do it))</p>

<p>You may now take your first round of actions. Remember you can also talk, set up parties, find allies and friends or whatever. Just make it clear what your action is for this (and each) round. </p>

<p>I then roll, work out how successful the action was and potentially tell you a little about what you're going to face in there. </p>

<p>For example, with a 3 I'd say that you tried to work out what was beyond the next door, but your senses were blocked by the door itself. On the plus side the door is made of a nice oak, slathered with fire-resistant enchantments and it smelt nice when you were close to it.))</p>

            <p>The App:</p>

<p>(Note that nothing besides Race, Class and Health are necessary, but they are nice to have)</p>

<p>Name:</p>

<p>Gender:</p>

<p>Race:
- (Power 1)
- (Power 2)</p>

<p>Class:
- (Power 1)</p>

<p>Health:</p>

<p>Anything Else: (Completely optional)</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Example App:</p>

<p>Name: Fely Hefelt</p>

<p>Gender: Male</p>

<p>Race: Elf
- Arcane Archer
- Beast-master</p>

<p>Class: Hunter
- Bowman</p>

<p>Health: 7 (1+6)</p>

<p>Anything Else: Likes Anagrams</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Example Combat Situation</p>

<p>Fely is in a room (shock, horror!) with an Orc named Bob. Fely being the Elf he is, is equipped with a Longbow(+2), 30 arrows and some Studded Leather Armour(Light, +2). Bob meanwhile has a nice Club(+1). Fely, being the PC in this case, makes the first move by firing an arrow at Bob. Fely rolls a 10 on his D20 to attack, he gets +3 Damage for being a Bowman, and +2 Damage from his Longbow, meaning he has an Attack Roll of 15. Bob rolls a 14 on his D20 to defend, and  as an Orc has +6 Natural Armour, this means Bob's Defence Roll is 20. As Fely's roll is greater than half Bob's Defence roll (but not greater than Bob's Defence Roll) nothing happens. Bob now decides to charge towards Fely, rolls an 8 on 2D6 and so succeeds, and surprises Fely with his turn of agility (-1 Cir for Fely's next attack). The attack continues...</p>

<p>Example Exploration Situation</p>

<p>Fely has now defeated Bob and decides to loot the room. He automatically get's Bob's Club(+1) and then rolls a 6 on the exploration table. Fely finds some semi-decent food Bob was looking forward to, but that's about it. </p>

<p>Class: Fighter - Weapons Master</p>

<p>Health: 25 (15 + 10)</p>

<p>Anything Else: Priya is more snakelike than other lizardmen, having a relatively long neck, short but strong arms, and a serpentine lower half with vestigial back legs; she has to rear up, cobra-style, to "stand" at eye-level to people. Priya can subdue her enemies via constriction and a powerful bite, though as a Weapons Master, her preferred weapon is a monk's spade with both blades honed to razor-sharp edges; given her short arm-reach, she often wields it using her muscular, prehensile tail.</p>

<p>Xi is rather eccentric despite its age. It alters its habit, or morphology, depending on how it wishes to present itself, becoming short and squat to act unassuming, or tall and thin to intimidate. Every action, no matter how strange, has a purpose.</p>

            <p>That's the beauty of taking Tentacle Tangle. Against the many, many humanoid enemies in these dungeons - two arms, two legs, size class Medium, and so on - it actually balances out!

            <p>If you have any questions, reply to this post with them and I'll try to answer them as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>Now, for the general running of this RP. This RP will work in 'Rounds', these Rounds will generally last 24 hours (although if everyone has posted before then I'll move the Round on in advance). Each Round you are required to leave at least 1 Reply in the relevant area stating your action for this Round, talking and generally interacting with other PC's and Friendly NPC's is a free action, you don't need to state you're doing it, just do it (and who knows they may respond in kind). </p>

<p>If you are exploring, or looking for treasure tell me what you are looking for, so I can then (hopefully) give it to you if the Dice Gods allow it. Most enemies will drop loot and I will let you know what they've dropped when they die/are erased from existence. </p>

<p>Don't come to this if you expect it to be really serious a) we're the PPC, b) this is me. It's going to be slightly wacky and not very serious. The Fourth Wall may be broken a couple of times and various references to various games/stuff may be included. You have been warned.</p>

<p>If you've managed to get this far down, well done (doubly so if you've read all the other beginning posts). Now, onto some actually game-y bits. This will probably be repeated when I start the first Round, but listen to the tale. Your tale...</p>

<p>"You are a group of fresh-faced adventurers, believing you can take on anyone, or anything. You have heard tale of the great Dragon Paarnax and his hoard, hidden amidst the treacherous caverns of the Bore-Hole. Wanting to prove yourselves as true adventurers you have grouped up and set off to kill this dragon and claim his hoard for yourselves. You have heard tales of how large the hoard Paarnax has that it can no longer be contained within his lair alone. Instead he has spread it through out the Bore-Hole, protected by a legion of monsters that swear fealty to the Dragon himself. You have also heard tale of how adventurers before you have fallen not just to this legion of monsters but also to the very caverns themselves, with various chambers seemingly created specifically to trap and kill any who wander into them. Undaunted you have set out, not knowing what you will face but determined you will make it to the bottom and kill the great Dragon Paarnax..."</p>

            <p>I know we've discussed it before a bit briefly. But when I said I don't mind a bit of Fourth Wall breaking, I did mean a bit. To be honest, that point has now past, and it is getting on my nerves, so please: No Fourth Wall Breaking. For now at least, I may get a bit more lenient later on. This doesn't mean 'Stop having fun' or 'You must take this 100% seriously' I'm just asking for people to tone it down a little in certain areas. </p>

Two questions: Firstly, if a woman takes the Knight class, does the Man of Honor skill become Woman of Honor, with adjustments to dealing with men, and secondly, for stuff like the Psion's Eldritch Presence, if I'm, say, an Elven Psion with Enchanter and Eldritch Presence, do I get the bonus? Finally, do we only get two race abilities, or the full set, including the extra class ability?</p>

            <p>Honestly, I hadn't thought of the first instance arising, so I'm going to say yes, yes those changes do apply (thanks). In the Second instance I would also say yes, because how I worded didn't say 'allied' and seeing as you'll always be in the same room as yourself. </p>

<p>One thing I will say is that Paarnax is a male Dragon, and I think you'll want all the bonuses you can get against him.</p>

            <p>Please Note: For the majority of things I (The DM/OP/whatever you want to call me) will be doing the rolling. Some things (like Health) you can do the rolling for. Please be honest when you say what you have rolled, I will be and I will try and make sure I'm at least on Discord, if not in a voice channel when I'm doing it.</p>

<p>Modifiers</p>

<p>Cir or Circumstance is when the circumstances the character is in have either a positive or negative affect on what they're trying to do (you can't fight effectively if you're dangling over a pit and holding on with one hand for example). It can also be used as a catch-all modifier for anything that could arise in the RP, if trying to do the impossible, expect a large negative circumstance modifier. A few Circumstance modifiers are permanent whilst the majority will be active for a set number of turns, or until something else happens (in the example above the circumstance negative modifier persists until the character either falls in the pit (they're then not fighting) or until they get out of the pit (no longer dangling over the edge)).</p>

<p>Inj or Injury. Only a negative modifier, Injuries happen in the same kind of way they do IRL. Injuries will wear off after a while to mimic your characters either healing or just getting used to the pain. They can also be healed by certain items, Clerics and potentially by friendly NPC's. Injuries also cover poisons and the like.</p>

<p>Arm or Armour. How much protection you are wearing. There are four types of armour in the RP, Clothing which can naturally confer a +1 bonus max. Light Armour which can naturally confer a +3 bonus max. Mail Armour can naturally confer a +5 bonus max. Heavy Armour can naturally confer a +7 bonus max and Plate Armour can naturally confer a +9 bonus max. Although Class and Race powers can improve these bonuses above their normal maximum. If you pick two different class powers through the use of the Natural Class Race power, then the lowest armour type is the one you are able to equip. Shields will also give an Armour bonus, and can be wielded by any class, although if you have a Shield you can't wield a two handed weapon.</p>

<p>Dam or Damage. The amount of bonus damage you do with a weapon, all weapons will have a set damage bonus they will give you which can then be increased or decreased by your characters powers, and any enchanting or improving of the weapons you may do. Shields can also turn their armor bonus into a damage bonus if you try bash with them. Weapons are either one handed or two handed (you will be told which).</p>

<p>Dice Rolls</p>

<p>Combat</p>

<p>In combat a D20 will be rolled for each character fighting, both PC and NPC. Every PC has a base 'Armour' of 5 (meaning that the dice roll, plus modifiers must be at least 5 to hit), some NPC's will have a higher base Armour, and a couple may have lower. This base armour is then modified by the characters armour score and any circumstance or injury modifiers that may effect the characters defence. The overall armour is then compared against the dice roll which will have also taken into account Damage, Circumstance and Injury modifiers, which forms the overall attack. If the attack is greater than the armour, then the character loses HP equal to the difference, if the attack is equal to, or more than half the armour score, then nothing happens, if the attack score is less than half the armour score, the attacking character's weapon will break (if they are wielding one) or they will either suffer Injury of some kind, or lose HP otherwise. If the attack is over double the armour score, then either a piece of the defending characters armour, or if they have no armour on (or nothing that gives an armour bonus on), the character will suffer another hit at half the original attack score. A Natural 1 will always fail to do damage, and a natural 20 will always do damage AND be treated as if the attack was double the armour score. Fractions will always be rounded UP.</p>

<p>Exploring covers every scenario which is not combat. In this case 2D6 are rolled, then modifiers are added, with the following being the results:</p>

<p>1 or less: Epic failure of Epicness: You fail, so badly in fact that I'm wincing just thinking about it.</p>

<p>2:Epic failure: you fail, badly. Like really badly, so badly in fact I'm surprised you got to here without an accident</p>

<p>3/4:Failure; It didn't work out for you, in fact it didn't do anything.  </p>

<p>5/6:Success (barely): Didn't exactly do what you wanted it to, but no bad side effects.</p>

<p>7:Success: Wow it actually worked out for you, did exactly what you wanted it to. no extra's but no bad points either.</p>

<p>8/9:Good Success: It worked slightly better than you thought, and no side effects that may harm you, isn't it just brilliant?</p>

<p>10/11:Brilliant Success: It worked a lot better than you thought it would, perhaps the Gods are smiling on you today. </p>

<p>12 or more:Godly Success: It worked so well it may of worked too well. now that's a problem.</p>

<p>Health. </p>

<p>Every Character has health, the amount depends on your Race. When you reach 0 health, that's it you die, if you do die you are allowed to re-enter with a new character who will be dropped off at the point where your last character died. Necromancers will be allowed to raise any dead PC's and they will re-roll the dice to see how much health they come back with. Do not fear though, for there will be plenty of chances for you to recover health along the way, as well as the fact that some of your fellow party members may be able to heal you. If you are a Thir-Kreen, Elf or Halfling you will start with 1D20 +6 Health, if you are a Tako, Dwarf or Centaur you will start with 1D20 +8 Health, If you are a Shardmind, Half-Orc or Lizardman you will start with 1D20 +10 Health. NPC's will have between D6 and D100 health dependent on their race and when you meet them. (an example of a D100 NPC would be a Dragon, whilst a D6 NPC would be a Wolf). </p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Once again however I think some of them are too OP for this RP, and other need tweaking so that they can fit. I can see a definite power creep between my original races and classes and the races and classes you proposed last time and again between your first set of ideas and this your second. So let's begin.</p>

<p>Thri-Kreen (or the Mantis Men)</p>

<p>Chitinous Exoskeleton I'd like to change, mainly because I gave the classes their armour restrictions for a reason and would rather there wasn't a way around said restriction. I'll take the +1 armour, and take the second part of the Freelance Ability from the Merc, (The heavier the armour, the quicker the Injury heals) and use that as the new Chitinous Exoskeleton</p>

<p>Rending Claws, oh Rending Claws how OP thou could be. Using two fists (which could count as dual wielding) would mean a total of +6 to your attack rolls, which when combined with, say the Brawler and either of the Thri-Kreen's unadusted abilities would make the character way too OP. Instead I'm going to change it to +1 Damage and -1 to your enemies Armour when unarmed. </p>

<p>Natural Monk will be fine once I've gone through Monk.</p>

<p>Fungoid</p>

<p>Collector, nice idea, but giving the character +2 armour AND then a free class ability all at once is too much I think. Instead if I was to add the Fungoid's in, I'd remove their ability to get Shield Wall this this ability, which then makes Collector inferior to Tough Scales... </p>

<p>Watcher, is just an inferior version of Druid, I see no real reason to include it.</p>

<p>Decayer, once again dealing with unarmed attacks, I'm assuming the -2 armour is to the enemy, and not to you. Either way I'm not too sure on this ability, and given the other abilities the Fungoid has, and the host of other armour bonuses various races have, I'm going to say I'm not going to use the Fungoid's.</p>

<p>The Necrons, because let's be honest they're basically Tomb Kings from Warhammer Fantasy</p>

<p>Tomb King (Ability): This one confuses me, it's name and what it does don't really match up at all. And let's move on to what it does do. +2 Damage when wielding 2 handed weapon, OK, that's nice, but then the other two parts of its ability won't really come into play in this RP, the last one almost definitely won't, so with the only downside being negligible I'd have to turn this ability down. If this RP has more talking and wider vareity of people to talk to I would consider it.</p>

<p>Mortuary Cultist: Another one of those gives a bonus AND then gives a class ability, I liked Extendable Limbs for the Tako because the bonus wasn't too much, and it kinda fitted. Here we have essentially a +2 on Attack and Defence against Undead, which becomes +6 on Attack and Defence against Vampires and then the Necromancy ability as well. I think that re-jigging it so that the ability changed it to +2 (instead of adding +2) to the Armour and Damage against Vampires, making it +3 on Attack and Defence (Keeping the Cir bonus the same), and removing the Necromancy ability would work. </p>

<p>My Will Be Done!, is a no. The reason is because whilst I don't mind racial abilities giving limited access to class abilities, I don't want racial abilities giving access to other racial abilities. As MWBD! is, it could be said to completely invalidate th Centaur's Charge!, giving them the ability to always have the other two of their racial abilities at no extra cost. </p>

<p>Given that two of the Dead-People's abilities won't work in this RP, I'm going to say no to them as a race as well.</p>

<p>Now onto Classes</p>

<p>Mercenary. </p>

<p>Doppelsoldner, My problem with this ability is that it gives +2 on Attack and +3 on Defence with no real negative to balance it out. Whilst the Bowman will at times struggle to stay out of close combat, there is no reason for the Doppelsoldner to even try and go for ranged combat. If this was to work, I would change the bonuses to +2 Dam, +1 Arm on 2 handed weapons, -1 Damage when wielding one handed weapons.</p>

<p>Freelance: As you can probably assume from earlier, I've decided to remove the second part of the Freelancer's ability from them. My one problem with Freelance is the potential to combo it up with a Charging Centaur and get a +5 Damage on the first round of combat, or combo it up with a Dwarven Weapon Master for a permanent +5 Damage bonus on top of whatever else the spear/lance may give you. My problem is is that I can't quite work out how to nerf it enough to avoid it being too OP, but at the same time still making it viable. As such, and with my problems with Doppelsoldner I'm going to deny the Mercenary class.</p>

<p>Monk</p>

<p>With the Mantis Men nerfed I'm no longer quite as scared of the potential of the Monk as i was. However I still think it needs changing. </p>

<p>Martial Artist: I've been thinking and am probably going to remove the OR condition by removing the second part of it, I also think the second sentence needs to go. Instead having Martial Artist will give 1 unarmed attack per round (if the character is unarmed) and all unarmed attacks will do +2 Damage. However I am going to change the Brawler's Slugger ability down to +2 Cir when fighting unarmed. </p>

<p>Ninja: I personally see two class abilities trying to masquerade as one here. My choices for this ability originally looked like this: either enemies have -3 Cir when attacking the Character at range OR +2 Damage from Thrown Weapons and have unlimited ammo. The second one I would eliminate for RPing reasons, the Ninja is not magical, so how does he have an unending supply of throwing weapons? Enchanted bows fire magic arrows, that's OK, mysterious always having throwing weapons? Not so much IMO. So, I decided to mix the two up, the new Ninja, gives enemies a -1 Cir when attacking at range, and a +2 Damage on Thrown Weapons. And, yes as I've included the Mantis Men, I'll be including Monks.</p>

<p>Shaman</p>

<p>In some ways I like the Shaman, in other ways I feel like both his abilities are trying to gain too much at once, like they could be split up and used to create 2 classes not 1.</p>

<p>Medicine Man: Yes I know I'm going in a different order, there is a reason for this though. First up Ectoplasm, I don't think is going to work in this, I mean I can't visualize how it will work, and is it really worth summoning an ally in if it's going to give everyone else a negative modifier? I don't know, not really. Secondly, Healing Items were, for the most part, not really going to be in the RP apart from in a few select places where they would be specifically mentioned, so I'm not sure how relevant the second part of Medicine man would be. So I'm going to say no to the Medicine Man ability.</p>

<p>Witch Doctor: Now this makes up for it. Splitting Witch Doctor into 2 abilities (Maybe Witch Doctor and Spirit Guide, I'll work on the name) And splitting it equally so one deal with -2 Cir to enemies using magic/magic items in the same room and the other gives a bonus to allies with magic items, works. I think the Latter ability will be restricted to Light armour or clothing, whilst the former will have access to Mail armour as well.</p>

<p>That takes the total up to 9 Races and 13 Classes, which I think is enough for now .So I will be closing applications for new Races and Classes for the time being. </p>

            <p>While we're all hoping our fellow Boarders don't get trampled in the rush for Black Friday shopping, why don't we take our minds off the madness by provoking it in our lovely agents?

<p>THE MANIPULATION PROCLAMATION: 1</p>

<p>Wait, what? Where did that come from? Is Das Sporking suddenly tracking me? ... Oh, whatever. Anyways, with permission from our Most Glorious Mailman (A.K.A. SeaTurtle) and Most Amazing DM (A.K.A. Storme Hawk), I'll kick this thing off. Now, for a bit of a refresher on the rules, or the rules for the first time for anybody, read the following:</p>

<p>This is an AU game in which we get to have a Q&amp;A session with some of our favourite PPC agents. As such, it is strictly non-canon for all participants due to the fact that, well, World One authors are having their questions answered by the agents themselves.</p>

<p>The format will be as follows:</p>

<p><i>Other Board / T-Board setup post</i></p><i>

<p>&gt;BoarderName1's Agents' Mailbox</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;Question(s) for BN1's Agent1</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Answer(s) to the above</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;Question(s) for BN1's Agent2 and Agent3</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Answer(s) to the above</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;Another question for BN1's Agent1</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Answer to the above</p>

<p>&gt;BoarderName2's Agents' Mailbox</p>

<p></i><p><i>&gt;&gt;Question(s) for BN2&#39;s Agent 2</i></p></p>

<p>Ah, yes. Thank you again, SeaTurtle, for providing me with the link I have just used to crib from you.</p>

<p>BLATANT PLAIGARISM: 2</p>

<p>Oh, come on! Do you really need to do the counts?</p>

<p>OBVIOUS YES: 1</p>

<p>Well, then, I'll just quit here and set up my mailbox. Yeesh.</p>

            <p>Larkus: My rank was a big one for me. My author had a reallly hard time deciding between Detective and Officer. It's a pretty big difference in responsibility and it took him months to stop switching back and forth.</p>

<p>I also had a few changes to how well I knew the Jedi, which was pretty important since it played into how I found the PPC. Plus some reworking of what my job was like during the Clone Wars, which was also pretty important given that it was my entire career.</p>

<p>Other than than that, though, it was pretty smooth flying. Except for the fact that he still hasn't decided which canon I'm from, but that'll be settled someday soon. I hope...</p>

<p>Curff: As for myself, I am a much older character concept so I had far fewer changes. Merely a few tweaks to my magical abilities to keep me relatively in line with the rest of the DMS (under normal circumstances a sorcerer from my universe would be more fit for ESAS), some minor shifts in personality (I am somewhat less brusque and sarcastic than I once was), and one or two edits to my backstory.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I remain much the same as I was when I was first selected as a potential agent for my author. Likely because we are not so much under development as we are on hold.</p>

<p>Larkus: Yep. We're pretty close to finished, but our author wants to get in some more first hand canon knowledge about the CSF before finishing up my backstory.</p>

<p>Curff: And he is still not entirely satified with my powers. Which is of course ridiculous, my powers are fine as they are.</p>

<p>Larkus: So then, hope that answers your question.</p>

<p>Curff: and if you are willing, perhaps your own agents would be interested in answering it?</p>

            <p>I wanted to go into Intelligence when I first arrived, but someone said since I showed up with no backstory and only an outline of a personality, I might accidentally go native if I investigated a pony fic or something. I dunno, maybe he just didn't like ponies very much.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, they put me in Floaters because Chris had recently shown up as confused as I was and he needed somepony to balance out his serious nature. There's probably another reason, I just can't imagine what that reason might be. I hope that answered your question. n_n</p>

            <p><strong>Laura Dukes</strong></p>

<p>First off, thanks for bringing up the whole 'bearing its kids' thing. James will never let me hear the end of that one now. But anyway, <em>Mass Effect</em>. <em>Mass Effect</em> is awesome for many reasons: the combat, the setting, the mere existence of Garrus Vakarian. I wasn't huge on RPGs beforehand, but this convinced me something hard. If your stuff can run the games, then pick them up. The first one can be a little rough play-wise, and the third game is always going to be mocked for that original ending, but I would still recommend it regardless.</p>

<p><strong>Danny Richardson</strong></p>

<p>There are times I do miss it, I will admit. But those times are fairly rare nowadays. I'm happy where I am: teaching future agents, both what to do and what not to do. I feel it's more my strength than running around strange worlds trying to kill powerful abominations.</p>

<p>I do still exchange messages with Xericka. As for Laura… we don't speak anymore. I'm not really comfortable going over why.</p>

            <p>Before I properly answer your question, I must announce that my reply will contain spoilers for both <em>Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance</em> and the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> series as a whole. Gremlin informed me that this was proper etiquette for discussing sensitive manners of canon. I questioned whether this warranted a spoiler warning as <em>Dream Drop Distance</em> was released in 2012, but ultimately went along with her suggestion.</p>

<p>Now, for your question.</p>

<p>According to <em>Dream Drop Distance</em>, Nobodies have always had the ability to develop their own hearts over time. That fact, however, was hidden by Xehanort so that the original members of Organization XIII would feel unbound by morality. This in turn would better enable Xehanort to take over their bodies with copies of his own heart. While this development would seem— </p>

<p>Gremlin has just told me I am getting too far away from the question. My apologies.</p>

<p>Ever since I was made aware of this canonical development, I have come to realize that I have indeed developed a heart—or at very least, a very good semblance of one. My connections with Aiden, Gremlin, and other close friends have aided in this process. The main reason I cannot say for certain is that my origin as a badfic character may muddy the scientific waters, as it were.</p>

<p><del>I also cannot say for certain, in part, because a certain someone has not written that particular story yet.</del></p>

<p><del>((I'm working on it, all right? There's still more character building stuff I'm working on. And get away from the fourth wall!))</del></p>

<p>I hope that you find this answer to be to your satisfaction.</p>

<p>Nume: Knowing I will probably regret saying this out loud... just a simple, straightforward crossover. No Sues, no squick, no teaming up with anybody else for any reason. I mean, I work in the Department of Implausible Crossovers. Is it too much to ask to just get a frelling crossover for once?</p>

<p>Ilraen: I concur. I would add, however—knowing that I, too, will probably regret saying this out loud—that I would very much like to visit my homeworld someday. On the other hand, I am happy if no one is writing bad crossovers about it. ∗knocks on wood∗</p>

<p>Gall: Oh man. Okay, for starters? Fire-breathing! I mean, come on, duh. Then there's the wicked sharp teeth and claws, and the flying at high speeds. Not that they all fly or breathe fire, but the ones that don't have other cool abilities, like—</p>

<p>Neshomeh: Hi. Um, sorry for butting in, but she's gonna go on like this at some length, and I don't really feel like typing it all out. Sorry. If you're curious, here's <a href="http://howtotrainyourdragon.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Dragons">the HtTYD wiki!</a></p>

<p>P.S. Apparently asterisks render the text between in italics here, so I used HTML for these low asterisks. I figured if I had to encode them anyway, might as well do something a little different. The code is <b>&amp;lowast;</b>.</p>

            <p>That's a difficult question. I can't think of any instrument I've heard or played that I <i>dis</i>like. In the right set of hands, true music can be wrung from just about anything.</p>

<p>For sheer versatility, though, I think I have to give it to the guitar. Passion, melancholy, rage, joy—it's all there in the strings if you know how to draw it out. Particularly if you consider the guitar's fantastic electric cousin. Now, that's something I'd like to get my hands on someday.</p>

<p>However, the instrument I'd most like to learn is the piano. They no longer existed on Pern in my time. What an expressive sound, though! I don't think you Terrans properly appreciate what you've got, judging by how often you squander it on repetitive, percussive chords in your modern music.</p>

            <p>If I could be another kind of pony? Fascinating. I would have to say an earth pony. The raw, robust strength they possess would be of great use, especially in my current line of work. Also, if I am wholly honest, the concept of earth pony magic fascinates me. I never was a student of the arcane, yet I always found the topic of earth pony magic severely undervalued as an academic study. Their connection to the earth is known, but not understood. What is an earth ponies limits? What range of magic can manifest itself in the humble earth pony? All burning questions in my head that we have no answer to.</p>

<p>So, in conclusion, if I were to be another breed of pony, I would be an earth pony. Humble, and yet, an enigma.</p>

            <p>Marina, this isn't exactly polite, you know? Shut it, I'm not letting this opportunity go, especially if it ends up on <i>his</i> lap.</p>

            <p>I'd prefer payment with some pure metals, gems or minerals, I'm working on a new earth focus, and prime materials like this would be useful, without speaking about potions, other items... Besides, providing energy just like this isn't practical.</p>

<p>Now, my, rather limited I admit, experience was mostly about keeping the special stuff in weird places, but I guess i could work about that.</p>

<p>But of course, I cannot do anything without more specific informations. Informations I'd like to hear about before promising anything on that front.</p>

            <p>And I'll pass on your recommendation, by the way.</p>

<p>Anyway. I believe we have an official description of everyone's roles floating around somewhere? Rest assured that we <em>do</em> actually do our jobs; I'm guessing those are the meeting logs that the Notary's taken charge of, while you've found your way into the ones that the rest of us keep around to roll our eyes at or use as proof that the others are idiots who can't stay focused.</p>

<p>(But yes, to be honest, it is sometimes a little bit more of a "hobby club". There aren't always important matters to be dealt with, so we do get a number of meetings where the main issues raised are about paperwork (the Notary) or restocking the bar (usually Morgan, though this one time it was <em>Fish</em>). The Notary, of course, will tell you that the paperwork is equally as important as the other stuff, but seriously, if she does come talk to you, I recommend making your excuses before she gives you the four hour speech on the beauty and function of the bureaucratic system. I wanted to be a politician when I was younger, but I think even my first self would've had trouble listening to that.)</p>

            <p>Well, you weren't there for last session, so let's begin with this: What is your opinion about the different Time Lords present here in HQ?</p>

<p>And another one. What differences exactly were there between your Gallifrey and the one from canon? Except the way the Time War unfolded, of course.</p>

            <p>Er...I mean, I love Emiranlanoamar like a brother, the Librarian's been a close friend since about a year before I even met Emiranlanoamar (er, you might know him better as the Guardsman)...er, Fish--the Fisherman--is fun, the Notary can be strangely compelling when she isn't trying her best to bore us all all to death, Morgan is...Morgan...er. We get along well enough.</p>

<p>I don't know this Detective too well yet, though I've so far got the impression he'd prefer not to have much to do with me. The Agent and the Disentangler are nice people; pretty interesting, <em>very</em> old, and nice enough to hang out with; I should probably do that more. Er...</p>

<p>Well. The Aviator is...complicated. We're still rebuilding, somewhat, and I don't know if we'll ever be as close as we were--probably not in our current regenerations, anyway, we're too shaped by our losses and sins right now--but we're on good enough terms even if it does sometimes turn awkward. And that's all you need to know on that front. Actually, it's more than you need to know.</p>

<p>If I've missed anyone who's currently an active agent of some sort--sorry. Let me know, and I'll, er, give my opinion of you.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>As for your second question...well, what springs to mind--apart from my home city not existing in non-Expanded Universe canon--is that both birth and Looming were available on my Gallifrey. I was born; my favourite professor and many of my classmates at the Academy were Loomed. It made for some odd-looking classes at first, but it was hardly a difficult adjustment, and it really was very good for providing options--though there were certainly arguments about which was the better way of reproducing. Don't ask for my opinion; I never had a strong one, and I currently have no plans to have a baby.</p>

            <p>This is the Headquarters of the PPC; there is no reasonable cause for Klingons and Vulcans to uphold the war between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire. Kozar in particular is of this opinion. Moreover, in this specific case-- <em>turns to Kozar</em> Would you care to answer this part?</p>

<p>Kozar: <em>arms crossed</em> We have been friends for several years now; this isn't news. And we're currently not pursuing any sort of romance, though if you believe we are, then you probably also believe Vulcans are incapable of it.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm answering! As an idiot once said, "stop reading over my shoulder." Look, I don't give two hoots about the other Time Lords in the PPC. There's some comaradarie amongst the Time War vets, sure, and the shared Time Lord history, maybe an understanding of what we've fought for, and what we've lost. But, frankly I don't care what species you are. A moron is a moron, no matter how many hearts they have. That brings up whole other questions about extra oxygen available to the brain thanks to the added blood flow from a second heart, but that's. . . for another time. </p>

<p><em>Sigh</em> What does my partner do to get under my scales, specifically? I suppose it's the way he thinks he can tell me exactly what to do and how to do it, when he's never been the one to kill a Sue. He can't even use a dagger properly.</p>

<p>Dang it, that's probably expensive, Yinz'r! Right. What irritates me the most about Yinz'r? He's careless. He has no respect for the rules, and won't listen to me when I call him out on it. Plus, the glowing eyes make sleep even harder to get than normal.</p>

            <p>Because of how vampirism works in <em>Skyrim</em>, I get more powerful the less I feed, so I tend not to do so very often. When I do, I tend to feed on Generic Characters. Feeding on people who are awake (and powerful enough) is outright impossible, so it's the only option. Oh, and vampirism isn't passed on by feeding in any case, so it's perfectly harmless to the characters.</p>

            <p>Perhaps my daughter would be up for such things— she's always so eager to help the Paladins take down the Sues, Arceus bless her heart.</p>

<p>My mane is greying and I need glasses to see anything these days. See, if this were 2020 or even 2016 I'd be ready to fight as a solo challenger in order to build up some experience and evolve. But these days? As an old Zoroark... I don't need more violence in my life anymore. I'm quite happy with organizing my archive and writing my book.</p>

            <p>Fine. It's not like this is canon anyways.</p>

<p>In the purely theoretical scenario that I am noticed <i>and</i> that someone finds me attractive <i>and</i> that I somehow manage to find the courage to talk to her <i>and</i> she is still interested in knowing more about me after I open my mouth <i>and</i> that I don't chicken out...</p>

<p>I'd like to have a nice, quiet dinner with my theoretical date. No restaurants— I don't have the money for that. Instead, I'd cook something for her and we'd share supper. Something home-made and personal. It's nicer that way, isn't it? Something that I would make with my hands and offer to someone. Afterwards, if she'd be up for it, I'd like to take her for a walk in the evening. I know a wonderful part of my home city that is by the water and it's so very nice at sunset. We'd walk until the sun goes down and then some and then I'd drive her back to wherever she lives and end the evening like that. Maybe she'd like to watch a movie— I'd be okay with that. I would like to imagine myself open to suggestions on what she wants to do too— after all, a relationship is a two-way street, right?</p>

<p>It's stupid, it's delusional, it's massively cliché, it's probably not how this works in real life. I've only got books and TV shows to work out how this business works— heck, the nicest thing that has ever been said to me in a romantic context goes along the lines that I'll have to bioengineer a new species because nobody in their right mind would want to live their life with me.</p>

<p>But one can hope. And heaven knows that hope is a terrible thing.</p>

            <p>Buddy, let me tell you a thing. Everyone tells me that I'm lucky or that Sonia is my eternal Princess In Shining Armor that has to save my bacon all the time-- but let's get one thing straight. I'm a self-made man and everything that I am is because that I've achieved it fair and square. No luck, no miracles, no weird game mechanics. </p>

<p>P.S. Sonia is standing behind me and laughing really hard as I type this. I have no idea what's so funny about this but I have to ask: is this a trick question? Because I have a feeling this is a trick question. </p>

            <p>Mike, can I use that one that was really fun?</p>

<p>Michael: Yes, I believe that it shall not be too inappropriate.</p>

<p>Apecian: Great! The answer is... Incubus kiss! A succubus tried it too, but what can I say? He was hotter. ;) You'd think somebody trying to suck your soul out would hurt, but when you've got as much Galinergy\*  as I do, it's really not bad. Kind of fun, actually, and besides, the kisses aren't supposed to hurt, otherwise you'd fight it. But that's kind of a gimme, isn't it? Alright... hmm... Well, drowning and suffocating suck, so don't try those, really. Mmm... getting stabbed really hurts, and forget hitting the ground at terminal velocity. It hurts, it gets everywhere, and sometimes it annoys sentient flowers by getting your intestines on their hats. I'd say... mmm... sometimes, when I get shot, it's so fast I don't even feel it, so that's not bad, and once, I got poisoned with something that was basically the same way. Mmm... yeah, gonna have to go with getting shot, but they've got to really know what they're doing and hit you just right for that.</p>

            <p>I believe I have heard of you. You are HQ's magazine, or so I am told. Well, please allow me to dispel any misconceptions anybody has about this situation.</p>

<p>When I saw Miss Knight in Rudi's, I saw in her some resemblance to a character, although I could not recall who. Upon later investigation, by which I mean returning to my Response Center and refreshing my memory by continuing my game of Fire Emblem, I realized she bears a striking resemblance to Sumia, a character in Fire Emblem: Awakening. I do not know why this is the case, but it would be rude of me to ask- something you should take to heart. I later returned to Rudi's, and I have since found Miss Knight a pleasant conversationalist. That is all. Now, if you do not mind, please do not ask me any further questions.</p>

<p>Apecian: And who is it who told you this stuff? 'Cause I haven't noticed anybody snooping around Rudi's whenever I was there... um... at least I hope nobody was...</p>

            <p>If you're talking about the closest to death I've ever been, well, it was probably when we faced that Firebender!Sue. She incinerated my partner, and for a moment, I was afraid she would kill me before he had a chance to regenerate. Fortunately, he did, and we managed to dispatch her quite easily as she stood there and stared at him. However, for me, it was far more terrifying when a Sue invaded my life and came close to wiping out my entire self, and the selves of the others I was working with at the time. I only escaped by a plot hole created by a combination of Canonquakes and the presence of the Sue.</p>

<p>Apecian: Well, I don't really have any close calls, you know? I mean, we don't usually throw things in space, or in a volcano, or anything, and Sues don't usually like being there in our fandoms, so it's a pretty cushy job for me. Closest, then, is probably... I'd say when the guy who made me tried to kill me. Didn't really get many lives off of me, though, and I just ran out the door. He couldn't even use flame alchemy, so when I started speeding up, didn't have a chance of catching me. Did manage to cut at least half a dozen lives off of me before I got away, though, so, kudos to him.</p>

<p>Michael: Of course, my experience with death is only hypothetical, as we are only hypothetical agents. If or when we should become official, you should see our records for my true closest brush with death, and to see if Apecian's answer is changed.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve actually got the Silm at home and I&#39;ve been wanting to get started on it for over a year now, I think, but always got sidetracked after a few chapters.<br>It might actually be a good idea to read Children of Hurin first. One of the main things that always kept me from finishing the Silm was the sheer load of characters, each of wich has three names at least three names that are all used regularly, and the fact that the names of different people all sound very similar.</p>

            <p>Be aware that the Silmarillion as published is actually four books. Here&#39;s a summary of the first two (Ainulindale and Valaquenta):<br><br>In the beginning God and the Valar made the world. The Valar (~ angels) are pretty cool, except Melkor, who sucks and wants to destroy everything. He&#39;s a persuasive blighter, though.<br><br>Unfortunately I can&#39;t really summarise you past the beginning of the <i>Quenta Silmarillion</i> proper. You could try just skipping ahead (jump down to Chapter 18 for where the story starts getting some space to breathe instead of being &#39;and then two hundred years passed&#39;), but you&#39;ll then probably need to poke around the index to find out what a Gondolin or a Thingol is.<br><br>One more option: next year the Estate is releasing a standalone version of the tale of Beren and Luthien, to go with the Children of Hurin one. Between them, they should actually do a decent job of orienting you in Beleriand and help you get through the denser parts of the Silm.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>First was Finwë, whose name doesn’t mean anything (though it can be interpreted as ‘Hairy man’. House of Finwë: werewolves? Worth considering.) He got married to a woman who was named Jewel by her father, and Weaver by her mother, elves tending to get one name from each.<br><br>The couple had a son, who Finwë called Finwë (as you do). Fortunately his mother named him Spirit of Fire, which he went by, so that makes things easier.<br><br>Finwë’s wife died, and Finwë got remarried (big drama there) to Indis, whose name pretty much means ‘woman’. Their first child was a daughter, who was called Findis, in the Meyer-honoured tradition of portmanteau names. It could mean ‘Hairy woman’. (House of Finwë werewolf theory: confirmed.)<br><br>Then they had a son, who Finwë named Finwë, because it worked once, so why not twice? Luckily Finwë the first had an attack of good sense and gave his sons add-on names: the older became Skilled Finwë, while the younger became Wise Finwë. His mother called him High Chief, which – given that Finwë was High King – was something of a slap in the face to the eldest son. (Hint: irritating someone named Spirit of Fire is not a good idea.)<br><br>Then there was another daughter, who Finwë called Sexy (all right, ‘desirable’), and her mother named Laughing Maiden. And then a third son, who was of course named Finwë. He got upgraded to Noble Finwë, while his mother continued her project of upsetting the previous son by calling him Wisdom.<br><br>Now, Skilled Finwë didn’t much like the fact that his mum was dead, and really hated his stepmother (possibly due to her malicious naming habits), and for that matter wasn’t too pleased with the implication that his half-brothers were wiser and nobler than him. When he got married, he decided to assert his position as his father’s son with a very large naming stick. He had seven(!) sons, all oh whom he named Finwë with various epithets.<br><br>First came Third Finwë (because Skilled Finwë and Original Finwë were the only other ones who count, you see). Then Chief Finwë, stealing the latter half of Wise Finwë’s mother-name. Then came Strong Finwë, Dark Finwë, and Skilled Finwë the second (who’s the only one who ended up using his father-name – surprise!). Finally we have the twins, Little Finwë and Last Finwë.<br><br>Fortunately their mother was one of the few members of the house with a lick of sense. She named them (in order) Handsome, Gold-shaper, Swift to Anger, Red-faced, Little Father (this is Skilled Finwë the second; apparently it was really obvious), and then the twins, both of whom she called Redhead. Of course Skilled Finwë (the elder) objected to the duplicate name, so she called one of them Doomed; he didn’t like that much better.<br><br>At the same time, Wise Finwë was having his own kids, and it seems like his wife had a bit of a controlling hand over his naming tendencies (well, she was called Holy herself, so she had a vested interest). His first son came very near to being another Finwë, but ended up as Hairy Chief instead. On the other hand, remember that Wise Finwë’s mother-name was High Chief… yeah, there’s a lot of Chiefs in his line.<br><br>So his second son was called Mighty Chief. Then he had a daughter, whose name doesn’t seem to be translatable; probably a good thing, frankly. Then he had a third son, and decided this ‘partial self-naming’ thing wasn’t good enough, so he just straight-up called him High Chief. As you do. Then he stopped, because there was no point competing with Mr. Seven Sons, was there?<br><br>Noble Finwë was… pretty much as bad. He called his first son Champion, which is original, but his wife kept up the crazy by naming him Wisdom, which was also her husband’s mother-name, and another slap in the face for Wise Finwë. Then they had another son, who Noble Finwë named… Champion again. Hey, it worked for dad! He distinguished them by naming the eldest Hairy Champion (House of Finwë werewolf status: howling at the moon) and the younger Iron Champion.<br><br>The third son was another Champion, and may have been born after Skilled Finwë’s twins: he ended up as Champion of Doom. His mother’s contribution was to call him Fell Fire, riffing off Skilled Finwë’s preferred mother-name – look, these people <i>really</i> didn’t like each other, is what I’m saying.<br><br>Finally we have the daughter of the house: Noble Woman. Sounds good, but remember this is Noble Finwë’s daughter – he basically called her Girl Me. Her mother was even more baffled by having a daughter, and called her Tomboy.<br><br>At that point the sheer madcap naming ends; the following generation all have fairly sane names. But as a final capstone to the whole thing, when Wise Finwë became High King after Skilled Finwë’s death, he decided to add his father’s name to his own. The fact that it was already there didn’t bother him: he just stuck it on the front, becoming Finwë Wise Finwë.<br><br>This, naturally, the sons of Noble Finwë couldn’t stand (what with their father being High King back home now). So they did the same thing, retroactively renaming poor dad as Finwë Noble Finwë.<br><br>See? It all makes perfect sense!<br><br>(Conclusion one: Elves aren’t as imaginative about their names as we’d think. Conclusion two: House Finwë really hated each other. Conclusion three: they’re probably werewolves.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... &#39;Arwen&#39; is... basically the same name as &#39;Artanis&#39;. They both mean &#39;Noble Lady&#39;.<br><br>I don&#39;t think we can forgive Elladan being named &#39;Elf-Man&#39;, honestly. Elrohir, maybe, the &#39;rider&#39; component isn&#39;t something I recognise.<br><br>Elsewhere in the later generations we have Orodreth, who I probably confused someone by not listing as a son of Finarfin (Tolkien ended up with him as Angrod&#39;s son). His name in Quenya was Artaresto, which means High Climber; clearly Angrod had a better grip on reality than his parents. Orodreth&#39;s children were Finduilas (no Quenya name, but there&#39;s that Fin(d)- element again; hilariously, one Wiki parses it as &#39;hair like spring leaves&#39;. Green-haired House Finwe: confirmed?) and Gil-Galad, whose father-name was High Flame. So, uh... that&#39;s &#39;better at being Feanor than Feanor&#39;, then? Stay classy, Orodreth.<br><br>Elsewhere, Idril (Itarillë, &#39;Sparkling Radiance&#39;) escapes most of the madness by being female, though she may have been given the end of Galadriel&#39;s nickname. Her son was Eärendil Ardamírë - his father name means sea-lover (pretty obvious, given Tuor was sent to Gondolin by Ulmo), and his mother-name means &#39;Jewel of the World&#39;. Well, we always knew Idril was a seer; she even managed to work in a reference to Miriel there. Quite charming, actually.<br><br>Meanwhile over in crazyland... Curufin (aka Little Father) called his son... Silver Fist. Huh. Would not have pegged Curufin as the least crazy/pretentious parent among the grandchildren of Finwe.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I tend to get New Age-y types trying to sell me bits of dying plant matter in Canterbury a <i>lot</i> more than Roma or other travellers; I realize and accept that this may be an anomaly peculiar to my circumstances. However, my point was that I don&#39;t find the various Tolkien languages particularly pleasant to read or hear, especially Sindarin, because it sounds so forced and trite. Lest you think I&#39;m just dumping on Tolkien for the sake of contrarianism, I have exactly the same problem when imagining Marain from the <i>Culture</i> series; I just get the impression that everyone involved is trying way, way too hard.<br><br>Serious question, hS: how do the elves of Rivendell talk about bowel movements? Or athlete&#39;s foot? Or dysentery, or ringworm, or any one of a hundred other awful and/or embarrassing medical complaints? I mean, I know the answer is something akin to &quot;leaf-ears don&#39;t get sick&quot;, but that always felt like a handwave to me. It makes Quenya and Sindarin sound fake, as though they were designed solely for the purpose of sounding pretty. As languages, they ring hollow.<br><br>However, I apologise for being offensive to the groups in my previous post; while it was not my intent to be so, that&#39;s not an excuse. This apology does, however, exclude Tolkien fans. I&#39;m not about to lie, it was intended to be snarky about the tongues of the elves and written in a deliberately dismissive way. I could have phrased my points better, but chose not to; to suggest otherwise would be disingenuous.</p>

            <p>Perhaps something akin to the nature-based language used in traditional Chinese medicine, which I&#39;m learning about lately due to working as a receptionist at an acupuncture clinic. {= ) TCM talks about conditions/symptoms like &quot;heart fire,&quot; &quot;yin deficiency,&quot; &quot;wet cold,&quot; &quot;stagnation of the chi,&quot; &quot;wind,&quot; and so forth. It&#39;s not exactly anatomy and physiology as we know it in the West, but it&#39;s worked pretty darn well for thousands of years, just with a different sort of vocabulary that doesn&#39;t translate particularly well to Western terms.<br><br>I could see Elves approaching the subject in much the same way, is my point.

            <p>... there is a &#39;poetic&#39; Elvish word for having sex. ^_^ Yes, they not only have the noun <i>puhta</i>, but also a poetic verb <i>púcë</i>. One assumes they also had non-poetic words, but this is Tolkien we&#39;re talking about.<br><br>In general, Tolkien obviously didn&#39;t talk about bodily functions himself, but we know from LaCE that the Eldar celebrate begetting-days, not birth-days. That implies a lack of taboos about at least one bodily function, which we can probably extrapolate to others.<br><br>So while the actual answer to Scapegrace&#39;s question is &#39;dunno&#39;, a <b>likely</b> answer is close to Nesh&#39;s: they would have spoken as openly about them as seemed reasonable, probably using poetic terms that nevertheless  convey their meaning very nicely.<br><br>If we want to extrapolate a little further, bear in mind that Quenya is Tolkien&#39;s &#39;elf-latin&#39;; in Middle-earth, maybe they used Quenya borrowings to discuss technical (including medical) issues. Hmm... I think I might sit down and write out a dialogue about (say) blood poisoning at some point, just to see how it works out.<br><br>Scape, I think your question comes from a very English viewpoint. What you really mean is &#39;where&#39;s the Germanic?&#39;. Quenya and Sindarin are like the Latin and French roots of the &#39;noble&#39; half of English, but they don&#39;t encapsulate the Anglo-Saxon everyday vocab that you instinctively feel should be there.<br><br>I&#39;d be interested to hear from Hardric on this point, actually (and anyone else who comes from somewhere with a non-mongrel language): do you feel like Tolkien&#39;s languages lack the tone for earthy discussions?<br><br>(And finally: if they <i>really</i> want to be crass, I bet they borrow from Mannish tongues. Mortals have a lot to swear about, and there&#39;s nothing better than giving your idiotic subordinate a proper tongue-lashing in Beorian to get some anger off your chest.)<br><br>hS, rambling</p>

            <p>With in-line translations, since this is a demonstration, not fiction per se. Given the context, these two are probably Feanorians in northern Beleriand. Their names mean Sharp Sheath and Red-Gold Autumn, for no particular reason. I&#39;ve also used a few words in quite strange ways, and a couple which are probably obsolete, but again, it&#39;s a demo, not strict canon.<br><br>Aicavainë: &quot;Cullanta!&quot; <i>Cullanta!</i><br><br>Cullanta: &quot;Ai... elen síla lumann&#39; omentielvo, Aicavainë.&quot; <i>Oh no… a star shines on the hour of our meeting, Aicavainë.</i><br><br>Aicavainë: &quot;I eleni úmanyuval. Úsavin cardarlya!&quot; <i>The stars won’t help you now. I can’t believe you did that!</i><br><br>Cullanta: &quot;Nanven colë quettar restallor; hlarnen yarra urquilion.&quot; <i>I had to bring a report from the fields; I heard Orcs snarling.</i>“<br><br>Aicavanië: &quot;Equë harwelya i aháryiel maurë melmë, la hestolya!” <i>Your wound says you needed care, not your captain!</i><br><br>Cullanta: “Nan lúsina; suncen míruvórë-“ <i>I was fine; I drank some miruvor-</i><br><br>Aicavanië: “Cullanta, súcal sangwa sercellolya! Qui lemyas úpoica, hyaruvaltë telcol!” <i>Cullanta, you’re drinking poison from your blood! If it doesn’t get cleaned, they’ll take your leg!</i><br><br>Cullanta: “Ui, nas faica. Appien lil olca.” <i>No, it’s nothing. I’ve had worse.</i><br><br>Aicavanië: “I sangwa ná úmëa i rottor hroavassel. Rato helmal queruva mórin. Yulmë quatuvalyë.” <i>The poison is swarming in the caves of your body. Soon your skin will turn black. Heat will fill you.</i><br><br>Cullanta: “Yulmë? Nas mara nin.” <i>Drinking? Sounds good to me.</i><br><br>Aicavanië: “<b>Úrë.</b> Ar firuval.” <i><b>Heat</b>. And then you’ll die.</i><br><br>Cullanta: “Nan Elda, lá Engwa.” <i>I’m Elvish, not a Sickly One.</i><br><br>Aicavanië: “Firuval. Nwalmenen.” <i>You’ll die. Horribly.</i><br><br>Cullanta: “… ná i melissë hare?” <i>… is the doctor [lit. carer, lover] around?</i><br><br>Aicavanië: “Náto. Ar nan sissë sinen caituval caimassë, ar únauval caimassëa.” <i>Yes. And I’m here so you say in bed, instead of being bedridden.</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br>I think it works. Certainly having your condition described as <i>súcal sangwa sercellolya</i> has a wonderful sinister feel to it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hebrew is a spoken language which used to be almost a ceremonial one. Latin is a ceremonial language (particularly in Catholicism, but I think I count academia too) which used to be a spoken one. I can&#39;t really get my head around people chatting about their bedsores in the language of <i>alea iacta est</i> or... well, it turns out I don&#39;t know any Bible quotes in Hebrew, but the point stands. ;) So why should Scape be able to imagine it in the language of <i>elen sila lumenn&#39; ormentielvo</i>?<br><br>It&#39;s not about what you&#39;re speaking.

            <p>To be fair, we never learned how to say &quot;Where is the bathroom?&quot; in Latin, mostly because there aren&#39;t really any situations that demand it, and naturally most textbooks stay away from the cruder side of language.  Even still, there were often passages to translate that described everyday life for Romans.  I believe the Oxford Latin books frequently had sections involving Quintus finding his friend Marcus drinking in the pub, to the point where it bordered on implying Marcus had a bit of a drinking problem (or at least, was the kind of student who preferred partying to actually studying). And that&#39;s before you get into translating classical poetry, which the instructors did not always screen for content...  </p>

            <p>First of all--no, hold on. Pre-first of all: your thing with the names I *can&#39;t* I was actually laughing so hard I had to take breaks to look away and *breathe*.<br><br>Okay. Now. First of all: Unless I&#39;m gravely mistaken, Biblical Hebrew actually does involve some discussions of more earthly matters--wars and rape and begetting children and leprosy and so on. I doubt it&#39;s so extensive (from what we know, anyway; doubtless there are many words that we just don&#39;t know) that you could have a complete conversation about day to day matters or sickness--that&#39;s what happened when Modern Hebrew was being created, from what I heard, they eventually had to make up new words so that they could ask someone to put the kettle on--but I believe there&#39;s enough to start with.<br><br>My second point is just an addition--for some centuries in Europe (idk if this applied to speakers of Ladino and every other Jewish language that isn&#39;t Yiddish or not) Yiddish was used as the spoken language--the day to day language--and Hebrew was only used as a written language and even then primarily for religious purposes (though there is this great thing about the Rothschilds communicating in Hebrew letters so that no one else could read it). Basically, it was a diglossic situation. Nowadays, of course, Modern Hebrew exists and is in use--but it had to be developed quite a bit to become an all-purpose language again.<br><br>And now I&#39;m out of things to talk about (apart from &#39;say, speaking of parallels, I have one about German and Yiddish!&#39;) so I should probably do the sensible thing and go back to my essay. But yeah. Those are my points. And thank you so, so much for the naming thing, and if a werewolf!sons of Feanor ficlet appears...you know where it came from.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not even kidding.<br><br>So, first of all, that should&#39;ve been 27/30--I only caught Imin because I happened to read the Board thread first and saw the comments. Saeros also tripped me up--I&#39;d been trying to think in basically anything but that particular dialect of Sindarin, which was probably a mistake. Though it has also been kind of a while since I was strongly involved in naming Elves, so I guess that&#39;s my other excuse :)<br><br>And, as mentioned, the saga! The exciting Tale of an Elf Named Xeljanz began life as a somewhat sarcastic aside, and will now be copied in here for your potential entertainment:<br><br>Me: /takes quiz/ Ah, yes, Xeljanz. What a spectacular Elf. No one could even pronounce his name, much less figure out how he&#39;d gotten it--and how <i>he</i> was able to pronounce it to begin with--and so he eventually went to live with the Numenoreans, who spoke Adûnaic with all its strange sounds.<br><br>He ended up marrying a Numenorean named Xalkori, and they were very happy.<br><br>The happy couple eventually had a half-elven son named Vfend and a lovely half-elven daughter named, surprisingly normally, Idebenone. As with the other names, hers was of course nonsensical in any elvish language, but at least (as Xeljanz&#39;s kin would have concluded had they by this point been not only willing but able to ask after his well-being from travelers) it was composed of sounds capable of being uttered by the average elvish tongue.<br><br>(I mean, I guess they could just go &#39;hey, do you know anything about this crazy Elf with an unpronounceable name who went to live with the Numenoreans?&#39; but if they didn&#39;t know where he&#39;d gone, it&#39;d get more difficult)<br><br>And now some story notes! Aka, behold le meta!<br><br>...pfahaha, I sent an anti-arthritis medication to go live with the Numenoreans, who can actually get old<br><br>And he sort of provides a cure by renewing the Elf in their bloodline, especially if his children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren marry within the Numenoreans<br><br>This is hilarious<br><br>Hm. Xalkori...treats non-small cell lung cancer. Maybe she&#39;s a healer<br><br>And Idebenone treats Alzheimers, which makes some sense since her father in this story also treats a disease generally associated with old age...<br><br>And Vfend is...an antifungal medication. Well then<br>Guess he&#39;s not too serious about going into the family healing business!<br><br>And another thing:<br><br>Interestingly, you can get 21/30 just by alternating your answers (ie, every odd numbered question is drug, every even numbered one is elf).<br><br>If you do it with odd numbered questions being elf and even numbered questions being drug...well, apart from guessing that Oropher is a drug and Xeljanz is actually an Elf (as is the apparent Star Wars fan Anakinra--no surprise, as, like Xeljanz, Anakinra is into treating arthritis!), you get the <i>much</i> lower score of 7/30. And the moral of the story is...if you&#39;re going to guess, start with drugs?? That&#39;s a terrible moral. Stick to Elves, kids!<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: Actually, Xeljanz&#39;s entire made-up family ends up getting the Elf option in the second experiment. I suppose that&#39;s my hint as to which way they choose, assuming they&#39;re given the same choice as Earendil&#39;s family?</p>

            <p>^_~ Yes, 30.<br><br>They did a good job of picking most of the drug names. A lot of them look like one Elvish or another to even a non-casual glance. Their main problem was liking the letter X too much (it&#39;s actually not used at all in late-stage Elvish, though it&#39;s usually retained in Helcaraxe), and in thinking Tolkien used some straaaange consonant clusters. I remember a Vf, and a Qv, neither of which look plausible even in early Qenya.<br><br>The two that gave me trouble were Imin - until I remembered the fairytale he&#39;s from - and Galathil, which I could tell was an Elvish name but couldn&#39;t actually remember running into. Which is moderately embarrassing, since his brother is Lord of Lorien, and his daughter was Queen of Doriath.<br><br>hS<br><br></p>

            <p>I missed Imin (who I should have remembered from that ridiculous Gaia-avatar comic if nothing else) and one that I can&#39;t recall right now, but he was apparently one of Tolkien&#39;s very first characters, and I&#39;d never heard of him.<br><br>A couple of them were lucky guesses, too, I admit. Some of the more vowel-heavy ones, like Daonil and Saeros, could&#39;ve gone either way to my ear. The former actually sounds more Elvish to me than the latter, except that I don&#39;t think the dipthong <i>ao</i> is very common. As for the latter, I guess I had a vague memory of having come across it before. Basically, though, pure luck. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So, I am coming at this from two directions: 1) As a HP fan 2) as a semi-professional MTG player.<br><br>As an HP fan, I think the cards are pretty flavorful. I like most of the color combinations for the groups (Blue/Black for Slytherin, for instance), however, they made all of the groups allied colors except Gryffindor (Red/White), which seems odd to me.  I think the hot headed Gryffindors should have been Red/Green, which would push the mild-mannered Hufflepuffs to Green/White (which doesn&#39;t have a group yet).  I also think they could have gone further with adding characters in different colors.  A lot of our Legendary Creatures are mono-colored when they could be more.  The more important they are, the more colors they should be.  Make Voldemort Red/Black/Blue (combining the colors for Death Eaters and Slytherins).  Make Harry Red/Green/White.  Hermione should be Blue/White and Cedric should just be Green.  Also, we need more Weasleys, ghosts, and teachers.<br><br>Now, looking at it from the perspective of an actual magic set, this thing is a mess.  There is no real difference between most of the groups.  The whole thing kind of feels muddy.  I think this comes from the fact that all of the mechanics in the set are pretty evenly spread across all colors.  Also, the power level of cards goes straight from laughably weak to hilariously overpowered (looking at you Invisibility Cloak) with almost nothing in between.  It needs to be totally rebalanced, basically.<br><br>Also, &quot;Common Room&quot; has an Uncommon rarity level.  That&#39;s messed up.<br><br>I guess my overall impression is this: With work, I think this could be a pretty interesting set, but it is going to take a lot of work.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Except on the Hufflepuff thing, since I think they represent a rare opportunity to show Red as compassionate and helpful instead of the anger we usually get out of them.

            <p>I can kind of see the &quot;Red = Compassion&quot; thing, but I feel like they more closely align with Green/White which is a combination that speaks of things like &quot;Community&quot; and &quot;Alone we are small; together we move mountains.&quot;  That seems like a more Hufflepuff sentiment.  On the other hand, we have Green/Red which speaks of &quot;Wild passions&quot; and &quot;Act now; think later.&quot;  Much more Gryfindor, I feel. <br><br>In reality, I think all the Houses should have been based in White.  Hufflepuff would be Green/White, Gryfindor would be Red/White, Ravenclaw Blue/White, and Slytherin Black/White.  In all cases the White is for the innocence of children and the other color is for their major trait (Black for Ambition, for instance).  That leaves other color combinations for other things.  For instance:<br><br>Red/Green: Forbidden Forest (which would replace Hufflepuff Greenhouse, btw).  Spiders and Centaurs abound.  Just be careful; there might be Giants or Dragons running around, too.<br><br>Red/Blue: Ghosts and Goblins.  All sorts of magical shenanigans going on.  Extra fun when you introduce Peeves as a Red/Blue Legendary Creature.<br><br>Blue/Green: Academics.  Lupin is already Blue/Green, which helps.  Could add in a few more.  That McGonagall didn&#39;t make the cut is beyond me, but either Blue or Green would work for her.  Generic teachers could also be added.<br><br>Lots of ground to be covered here, really.<br><br>-Phobos</p>
