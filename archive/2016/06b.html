Of course, having another immunity to a relatively common type is always nice too! For use on your Eelektross, get a Quiet one and give it EVs in HP and Special Attack, then give it Volt Switch, Thunderbolt, Giga Drain, and Flamethrower. However, the most important thing to remember is to have fun! =]</p>

            <p>I have a sudden urge to plug lots of things, so I will! Feel free to plug your own things below.<br><br>Books:<br><br>I have two series plugs. One is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Off-Wizard-Magic-2-0-Book-ebook/dp/B00EF8Z32I">Magic 2.0</a>, which is a delightful series still in the making. It takes the &quot;Everything is a Computer Simulation&quot; concept and makes a fun adventure series out of it. Martin Banks, our protagonist, discovers &quot;the file,&quot; which describes every person alive, including him. He immediately begins altering his bank account--and of course he gets arrested. Panicked, he sends himself back in time to medieval England so he can pretend to be a wizard. I <i>heartily</i> recommend the audiobooks. The narrator does the voices perfectly; Phillip&#39;s is hilarious. And, if you have Kindle Unlimited, the books and narration are free!<br><br>The second is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fourline-Trilogy-3-Book/dp/B01ABWA9BG/ref=sr_1_1_ha?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1466396773&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Fourline">Fourline Trilogy</a>. I&#39;m mildly obsessed with &quot;modern person in medieval setting/different universe&quot; stories (I blame Narnia) and this is an excellent version of that; I like the characters, the writing is good, and overall the story is quite enjoyable. I haven&#39;t read the third book yet, but I soon will. These are also free on Kindle Unlimited, although the third book doesn&#39;t have an attached audiobook.<br><br>Music:<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYBqxYkt0ug">Go</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrlpkOR_R_M">listen</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJz8j6YDJ2M">to</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FBpNEaqEBg">Twenty</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0O-M-rKbQ">One</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO9WVNru38k">Pilots</a>.<br><br>Websites:<br><br><a href="http://www.missionalwear.com/">Missionalwear.com</a>. If you couldn&#39;t tell by the Greek, John Calvin mugs, Charles Spurgeon t-shirts, and the fact that they have an entire section devoted to <i>beards</i>, this is an apparel site for people who subscribe to Reformed theology. It&#39;s also the most excellent thing since sliced bread--trust me, I&#39;m an expert in sliced bread. Also, are there any others of the Reformed bent in the PPC? That would be awesome.<br><br>Webcomic: <br><br><a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comicsandcosplay/comics/erin-dies-alone/13568-Twice-Daily-01">Erin Dies Alone</a> is funny, updates regularly, has an intriguing plot that I can&#39;t wait to hear the end of, and is excellently done in general. Plus, Rad is adorable.<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve actually been thinking about starting a similar thread myself, so thank you much for this.<br><br>Webcomics:<br><br><a href="http://www.weregeek.com/2006/11/27/">Weregeek,</a><a></a> It&#39;s a fun little comic all about geeks. It updates pretty frequently and I never get tired of the art style. Word of warning, though, it&#39;s been going for about ten years now, so expect some changes, and good luck catching up to the current strips.<br><a href="http://www.wildelifecomic.com/comic/1Wilde">Wilde  Life,</a><a></a> I don&#39;t want to say anything too spoilery, so I&#39;ll must post part of the description from the website:<br>Oscar rented an old house off craigslist, then things got weird...<br>First it was meeting the ghost of a 1940s mathematician in the upstairs hallway, then it was finding a teenage werewolf in the bathtub. Now Oscar doesn&#39;t know what will show up next. Maybe that&#39;s okay, as long as nothing eats him.<br><br>Interesting, no?<br><br>YouTube channels:<br><br><a href="https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCSfoxYTlCPFfglckBLrjpsA">Miracle of Sound,</a><a></a> my all time favorite musician.<br><a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/SkallagrimNilsson">Skallagrim,</a><a></a> <a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/lindybeige">Lindybeige,</a><a></a> <a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/scholagladiatoria">Schola Gladiatoria,</a><a></a> and <a href="https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCIjGKyrdT4Gja0VLO40RlOw">Metatron</a><a></a> are all good sources for information on medieval combat. Very useful if, like me, your primary field of writing is high fantasy.<br><a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting">Every Frame A Painting,</a><a></a> an interesting look into the styles of various directors, as well as videos on other aspects of cinema.<br><a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/Amymethven">Mad Munchkin,</a><a></a> the art, opinions, and perspectives of one Amy Methven.<br><br>The rest of my recommendations can mostly be summed up by the music rec thread <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=294171;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here.</a><a></a></p>

            <p>Go check out <a href="http://www.paranatural.net/">Paranatural</a>- it&#39;s a really fun and quirky comic with awesome characters about fighting monsters and being overdramatic. <br>Also, The Property of Hate (can&#39;t think of the link at the moment ugh) is the sort of thing that the PPC would gobble up. It&#39;s really fun and dynamic and all of the characters are wonderful. One of the main characters is a talking television with a British accent and a questionable fashion sense, and another is a sock puppet. It&#39;s just <i>great</i> in general.<br><br>I might be back with more later. :) Thanks for the recs, Alleb!</p>

            <p>For two days, nothing in my spare time was done other than &#39;finish Paranatural.&#39; <br>And now I can&#39;t read it, because I already gobbled it up like a bag of Doritos. <br>Bugger. <br><br>Speaking of really good webcomics which I absorbed instantly, promptly regretting it: <a href="http://www.rice-boy.com/see/">Rice Boy.</a><br>It&#39;s a fantasy sort of thing in a very surreal world, that, while it plays a lot of fantasy tropes straight, does it in such a way that it&#39;s still not grating. <br>In fact, while I hate to unfairly raise standards, it arose the same sort of feelings in me that The Hobbit did. <br>Its protagonist is bloody adorable, which might have helped. </p>

            <p>Yeah, my friend introduced it to me, like, yesterday, and I started off initially only reading it because she was sitting half a metre away and I would&#39;ve felt guilty otherwise, but then I really got into it. Mmm. And I&#39;m unreasonably attached to Mr Spender for no reason I can decipher.

            <p>My tool would probably be my jacket. It would have an absurdly large number of pockets, all of which contain an absurdly large number of handkerchiefs, and possibly my wallet. <br>I could probably throw them at people (not my wallet, obviously,) and maybe use them to blow my nose (definitely not my wallet, obviously.) <br>It would also keep me warm on cold days. <br><br>Yeah, Spender&#39;s brilliant.

            <p>The date is June 18, 2016. Ten years ago today, an author called Ravenkiss uploaded a <i>Harry Potter</i> story to AdultFanFiction.net. In due time, that story came to the attention of the PPC. A task force was assembled. The mission was begun. It ended, not with success, but with failure and shame. The agents involved scattered to distant corners of the multiverse.<br><br>Now, ten years later....<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v155/Neshomeh/ITS_TIME.png" alt="IT'S TIME" title="IT'S TIME"><br><br>There will be a reckoning.<br><br><a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999/subjugation.html">&quot;Subjugation - The Rematch&quot;</a><br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. Okay, before anyone gets too excited, it&#39;s just the prologue (which is SFW). I&#39;ve got part one written, but only in a very rough state, and I&#39;m waiting for Tungsten Monk to get her new computer up and running so we can proceed. Knowing me, the mission probably won&#39;t get finished this year, but I wasn&#39;t going to let the occasion pass completely unmarked. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh, postscript.<br><br>P.P.S. Feel free to use the image. I was shocked when I couldn&#39;t find one like it, so I took the screencap and made it myself.<br><br>~Neshomeh, post-postscript.</p>

            <p>I couldn&#39;t find much of anything to complain about, so well done there. The only somewhat negative note I had was in regards to Ilraen&#39;s &quot;ninety-degree pirouette&quot; inso much as I have no idea what that might look like. But that&#39;s an incredibly minor thing. Everything else was very solid, peppered with some great character moments. The references to previous stories (including the ongoing &quot;Agony in Pink&quot;) are much appreciated details. <br><br>I shall be watching for any updates with an eager eye.</p>

(Sir Matthias Snow spoke only in the discussion about the distribution of territories, in favor of barons who are actually present.) Sir Filius Caeli suggested having the Baronial Council rule the nation, like may be the custom in Borrd. ((Clarification required: Is the Council of Borrd (redlinked in <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Protectorate_of_Borrd">Protectorate of Borrd</a>) the same as the <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Baronial_Council">Baronial Council</a> or an assembly of barons who actually hold territories in the Protectorate of Borrd?)) This suggestion was not supported by any of the barons. Although there may have been some mix up with the barons’ military duties, the resident Baroness Juliette actually spoke against council rule over the Riding. Since the <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/2015_Baronial_Council">2015 Baronial Council</a> already proclaimed that supplying the knights of Plort with grain is considered a military matter, no further decision was made. Beyond the resident barons’ military rights and obligations, the Riders of Sittorese are left to their own devices and the ancient <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Law_of_Goodriding">Law of Goodriding</a>.<br><br>((Since no further discussion occurred for three days, I really hope that this matter is closed. Taking the real life analogies seriously, the Baronial Council telling the Riders how to ride outside of military formations riding against the Marizu would imply that Writers who may not even have asked for Permission would be obligated to follow PPC-rules in writing non-PPC-related stories. I don’t believe that we want this. If ever a problem occurs that needs somebody actually governing the Riders of Sittorese, we can always pretend that the problem-to-be-solved somehow diminished the amount of grain delivered, and thus the barons stepped in to solve it.))<br><br>Since nobody attempted to negotiate the borders, no decision was required and Barony July now exists in the boundaries initially set up by the Edict of Bast.<br><br>Barony Phobos may now extend to the Hyparlink Route. The proposal was supported by Baron Neshomeh and not actually opposed by any other baron.<br><br>Since Barons July, Juliette, and VixenMage did not attempt to negotiate about the territory Baron Phobos proposed to cede to them, and not even Baron Phobos opposed to the Raven’s  counter-proposal, Baron Thanasius Ampelius may now, by a vote of one to zero, hold territories in Ozerbord and in the Riding of Sittorese (if this is even possible and he did not change his mind).<br><br>((These are still open for corrections if the discussion continues.<br><br>HG))</p>

            <p>Honoured barons and people of Plort:<br><br>At the previous Baronial Council, a new nation was created: the Riding of Sittorese, which would dedicate itself to feeding our noble knights in their quests against the Marizu. At that time, the choice of its manner of governance was postponed until a later date - this date.<br><br>Let those who dwell in the Riding speak of its character, and of the government of their choosing; let the barons debate; let the people have their say.<br><br>((So last year I pushed through the creation of &#39;the Writing of Stories&#39; as a nation in its own right; it&#39;s since grown to encompass the old Republic of Iric. Per <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=298357;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">the map</a>, I know DawnFire and Ekyl have castles there. Its barons are Cassie, Juliette, VixenMage, and - now - July. Its provisional capital is Godreve, and as I recall Sir Ekyl demanded to be its ruler. I think I have a note somewhere that says they&#39;ve adopted the Black Arrowhead as a symbol - yes, <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Revu#The_Mines_of_Spyration">here it is</a>.<br><br>If anyone wants to live in the Riding, they can go ahead and come up with flags and the like.<br><br>hS))</p>

            <p>I mean, the matter is that even if it will be a nation of its own, Sittorese could be seen in some ways as a nation existing for the Knights and Barons of Plort. Not the best way to formulate this, but this fact still holds some truth.<br><br>The civilians living here certainly have a say in the matter too, given the fact they live here, and didn&#39;t ask for the creation of this new nation interfering in their life, but at the end of the day the problem will touch mainly the ones doing the crusades, then the Knights and Barons. Even the ones not living the Riding will be affected by its action, and then will want to have a say in the affairs of this new state.<br><br>In fact, this &#39;new state&#39; makes more think to a vast supply base for the crusades, and that seems to call for a governance firm enough to regulate which can be called the war effort. And so its future governance should take this in consideration.<br><br>Now, I&#39;m not even settled firmly somewhere in Plort, so that remains the opinion of a hedge knight, a pretty way to say &#39;mix of vagabond and sellsword&#39;, but this country is supposed to supply the future crusades against Marizu, a matter which touches all Knights, so I thought it was important to talk here.<br><br>((Hope I&#39;m not saying anything too stupid.))</p>

            <p>As it may be remembered, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277038;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Baron Huinesoron&#39;s original proposal </a> was that the Riding be governed by the Baronial Council as a whole, given that its creation was due in part to the absence of Baron Cassie and the apparent inability of Baron Dann (as the Baron was known at the time) to police western Iric.<br><br>And let it not be forgotten that the Riding is supposed to be the breadbasket of all of Plort; its supplies are to sustain all the various knights of the realm in their eternal combat against the Marizu, not one sole baron.<br><br>So, as the Riding is for the support of all Plort, why not leave it in the care of the Council as a whole?<br><br>&quot;But Filius,&quot; one may say, &quot;rule by a council is highly inefficient. What about keeping order and maintaining its day-to-day affairs?&quot;<br><br>To which I reply thus: First of all, the cities of Sittorese are more than capable of providing for their own security and internal order: Godreve and Tumblar still stand to this day. And outside the cities, all that the farmlands require would be forces to keep order from thieves, bandits, and other outlaws; little more is required or requested. In that case, let the Council not forget that within the borders of Sittorese is a baron that has <i>not</i> been absent. A baron that, given the requisite support from the others, would be more than capable of providing basic security. I speak, of course, of Baron VixenMage.<br><br>So here is my proposal in full: Let Sittorese remain under the rule of the Baronial Council, given its status as the breadbasket for all Plort. However, allow Baron VixenMage authority to police the territory, as well as serve as a first line of defense against any invasion until such time as the Baronial Council can raise sufficient forces.<br><br>What say you, esteemed barons, knights, and citizens of Plort?<br><br><img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/plort/images/d/d2/FiliusCaeliArms1.png/revision/latest?cb=20150610082913"><br><br>--Filius Caeli, Wanderer of Weab, Seeker of Lore</p>

            <p>While I appreciate the honor you give to Baron VixenMage, and deserve the rebuke intended for me, your proposal seems a few months out of date. I have reclaimed my halls on the river Sozeri, and I cannot help but wonder if you think a single warden Baron would have been sufficient to overcome the vicious assault on Borrd by the forces of Toroll this spring.<br><br>Now is not a season for inaction, as your proposal seems to suggest, nor are the barons of Sittorese absent. We are well aware of Sittorese&#39;s responsibilities to this Union, and while I have concerns of where the lines have been drawn, Baron Huinesoron&#39;s proposals regarding the recreation of Barony July will also provide more reason to dissolve the council and return to direct and normal rule of Sittorese.<br><br>I must also question what role you see for Baroness July in your proposed continuation of the Council, given that hS has proposed giving her the watershed of the upper Meibot, one of the important regions of Sittorese.<br><br>I think your proposal is unnecessary - while the Council is an important structure, its control of Sittorese has become redundant and should cease. To claim otherwise is to accuse the sitting Barons and Baronesses of inability to rule. Although, I am sure, the Baron VixenMage would be willing to join me in assisting with the stability of the upper Meibot region while Flayme is rebuilt, at the very least.<br><br>And finally, despite the nature of tales told by certain storytellers, it is appropriate to refer to me, including at all times past, as my current self.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s nothing in the Edict of Bast allowing for a baron to be moved without protest.

            <p>No Baronies lie fallow this day, for Barons Araeph and Cassie have been seen in the isle since the last Council was held, but one must be created anew. For Baron July has grasped once more her powers of rulership, and by the creation of a knight by the ancient code has reclaimed her powers and her Barony.<br><br>Therefore the Edict of Bast has been consulted, and the initial boundaries of her dominion have been set forth:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/BaronyJuly2016.png"><br><br>The words of the Edict are inviolable; all these lands now fall under the rule of Baron July.

The towns of Godreve, Goch&#39;t, and Eksoeva lie upon its borders; she or her representatives should discuss their disposition with the representatives of Barony Cassie. Should she consider the water rights of the upper Karaktar essential to her new lands, she ought also to discuss them with Baron Kaitlyn.<br><br>((Okay, so:<br><br>-Cassie posted on June 25th; Araeph posted in July. The Edict removes them if they haven&#39;t been seen for a year before a council, so they <i>just</i> squeak in.<br><br>-July granted Permission without objection, so is a confirmed active Permission Giver, so gets a barony. As ever, the borders are slapped down according to arcane formulae without discussion; they can certainly be changed from this point on.<br><br>-Wechi is no longer entirely in Barony Neshomeh!<br><br>I think that&#39;s everything I needed to comment.<br><br>hS))</p>

            <p>First off, allow us to humbly apologize for my lateness. The roads leading to Borrd have been particularly hellish this year. Something in the weather, perhaps, that clouds peoples&#39; minds. Not to mention wandering herds of Green Ads.<br><br>But never mind that. We must address the matter at hand. While we do agree with Baron Phobos on the responsibilities of stewardship, we found his proposal to be… inequitable. One baron nearly doubles his stead, while three barons must be satisfied with dividing up a comparatively small portion of land? The very notion is laughable.<br><br>However, since the barons involved have not spoken out or are not present, that rather muddies the potentiality for claims and counterclaims. Baron Thanasius Ampelius has asked for the land (or someone pretending to be him has), but we can hardly see how any baron can properly govern with several other polities in the way.<br><br>That being said, we would support the border restructuring plan put forward by Baron Phobos—with one alteration.

            <p>why not make the same suggestion for these lands that you did with the portions of Barony Cassie, namely, cede those lands to the neighboring barons for them to divide as they see fit? In this case, I therefore propose that the portions of Barony Araeph in consideration be ceded to milord, Baron Neshomeh, Baron Kaitlyn, and Baron July to divide as we see fit.<br><br>And no, milord, my inclusion of Baron Kaitlyn was not a slip of the tongue. Pardon my forwardness, but milord is amiss in comparing Baron Kaitlyn with the long-absent Baron Araeph. Though Baron Kaitlyn is admittedly not in residence in her barony, she is not absent from Plort--unless I am mistaken, one needs only go to Castle Kwenaya to find her. And given that I hear of no news of unrest in her lands, she must have shown capability in administrating her barony thus far.</p>

            <p>[A scroll of parchment is presented; much battered with travel, it bears a message indisputably in Baron Neshomeh&#39;s hand, but clearly written in a great hurry.]<br><br>My dear barons, knights, and citizens of Plort,<br><br>We regret our absence from this year&#39;s council, but our errand could not wait. The Subjugator has long evaded our spies, and was even thought to have fled Weab entirely at times, but at last we have cornered it in Odd-Ault Fanvik, that black and tangled mire in the secret heart of Fanvik-Neht, and we must needs pursue it with all our strength lest it escape us again. With the Supernumeraricon and Ilraen eager and crackling with magic in our hands, and the Tungsten Monk with Suicide and Diocletian at our side, we feel certain of victory.<br><br>That is our news; and now to business.<br><br>We happily give back that portion of Wechi east of the Raeltyms to our dear friend Baron July, and rejoice at her return. We hope she finds all in good order.<br><br>Our husband Baron Phobos has written to us urgently requesting support for his proposal of ceding certain portions of Baron Araeph&#39;s lands to himself. We of course agree, and we thank him for his continued backing of our campaign. We give no thought at all to expanding our own borders beyond Wechi; we are well content with what we have. May the council see it so.<br><br>~Baron Neshomeh<br><br>(( Odd-Ault Fanvik = Adult-FanFiction.org. I imagine it as a swamp full of dark, oppressive trees and hanging vines and whatnot. Possibly flame spurts, lightning sands, and ROUSes, too. One does not venture there lightly [and certainly not if one is under the age of eighteen]. Its location is somewhere within Fanvik-Neht. It may be difficult to find unless you know what you&#39;re looking for; but on the other hand, the unwary may find themselves ensnared in it by mistake, and then woe be unto them.<br><br>Baron Neshomeh probably doesn&#39;t understand the full extent of what Baron Phobos is up to. IIRC, it&#39;s been established before that she has a bit of a blind spot to his avaricious tendencies. Anyway, he promised his full support of her campaign if she spoke in favor of his proposal, and more land surely equals more support. Seems like a perfectly reasonable idea! ))</p>

            <p>Tragedy! Crisis! Other exclamations of dismay! Once again, many of the Citizens and Knights of the Union of Plort have not received their customary honours. Their names are not listed in Baron Huinesoron’s Cyclopaedia; their coats of arms go unblazoned; their histories are unknown to even those closest to them. Clearly, this cannot go on.<br><br>Or, in other words:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/UnionPlortFlag.png"><br><br>Welcome back to Konti-Nyuum.<br><br>The Protectorate of Plort, Konti-Nyuum, is not a PPC AU. Rather, it’s a PPC <i>Community</i> AU - an answer to a question that was never asked:<br><br><b>What if the PPC Community was a medieval nation?</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/UnionMap.png"><br><br>So here we are. The island of Konti-Nyuum lies to the north of the great continent of Weab. On this cliff-walled rock the noble knights Jay and Acacia made their home, building the Protectorate of Plort, and those who came after them have carried the Protectorate through its trials and troubles to the current Union of Plort. The Knights of Plort sally ever forth against the hosts of the Marizu, seeking to defend the beleaguered nations of the Scholars’ Empire from their scourge.<br><hr>
<br>Each and every member of the PPC Community is also a resident of Plort. You can find the autobiographies of everyone who&#39;s done this before in the <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Protectorate_of_Plort_Wikia">Cyclopaedia</a> (<a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Huinesoron">mine is here</a>, for example). If you haven&#39;t already written your history, why not join in and give one? There&#39;s a <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Beginner%27s_Guide_to_Plort">guide</a> on doing so on the Cyclopaedia, and a <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Glossary">glossary</a> outlining most of the websites and fandoms in the setting.<br><br>For entertainment value, please post your bios here on the Board; if you want to cross-post them to the Cyclopaedia, go ahead, but I&#39;m happy to sort that out for you. A couple of notes:<br><br>-Make sure to choose which of the four nations of the Union you live in, and indeed where in it; there’s nothing wrong with adding small towns and villages wherever you please, or you can live in the cities. Up to you!<br><br>-Everyone can have their own pair of heraldic devices, according to Plort’s two systems as <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Heraldry">described here</a>. If you can describe your device/s, either formally as described there or just vaguely, I’ll (try to) make it for you. If you want to make a device for a Marizu, that&#39;s also great - they&#39;re heaps of fun to work with. <sup>_<sup><br><br>Nor</sup></sup> is this thread limited to bios and heraldry. Anything goes! There will be a Baronial Council going on, which is open for in-character comments by all and sundry; world-building, RP-subthreads, songwriting... anything goes. Basically, use your imaginations - you&#39;re good at that!<br><br><s>hS</s> Huinesoron, by the grace of Kanun Baron and Knight of Plort, Custodian of Fanvik-Whirl, Marshal of the Order of Udisc, Scourge of the Marizu, Friend of Medellurth, &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</p>

            <p>It has been eight months and two weeks less one day since his last trip to Ydyff, and Thanasius Ampelius, Baron of Plort and lord of the Monastery of Spectacle, found himself increasingly restless. His trip to the Academian city of Is-really Lo wasn’t productive, to say the least; he shuddered at the thought. What’s more, since his return he seemed to do a lot of nothing.<br><br> His sorties against the Marizu were few and far between, none of them worthy of song; true, he defended the small town of Gett from a horde of raucous spirits, but it seemed that aside from him nobody in Plort knew about that town anyway.<br><br>He threw the blue-backed cards he was holding down on the table with an annoyed snort.<br><br>“The game is not to your liking?” his body-double asked, putting his cards down as well. Instead he picked up one of the small crystals used to indicate mana in that game and held it against the light; it sparkled.<br><br>“That is not the problem,” the monk said, staring across the room at nothing in particular. “‘Tis a good enough game. No, I believe the problem lies in me.”<br><br>“That is rather morose, even for you, milord.” Death Dendle put the crystal down and leaned on the table. “Revu for your thoughts?”<br><br>Thanasius shrugged. “I would not know. My sojourns in the woods of Kar-eer are few and far between, and sometimes I do not even place much hope by my planned trip to Academia. I am not satisfied. Restless, even. And it bothers me.”<br><br>“Friends,” Death Dendle declared.<br><br>“Beg pardon?”<br><br>“You should go and meet your friends. You have barely left this room ever since you’ve arrived at Borrd.” The body-double waved his hand around. “Go outside.”<br><br>“You are going to pester me until I will, are you not?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“Fine.” Without further ado, the Baron got up, adjusted his hood and left the room.<br><br><br>((Thanks to Matt Cipher for betaing.))</p>

            <p>In which eatpraylove has been very busy.<br><br>Dame eatpraylove confronted the demon Marizu calling herself the Falcon Queen at the end of June, in the first year since her arrival. The Falcon Queen claimed to be descended from angels and gods of death as well as demons; perhaps it is fitting that she went from slaying a god impersonator to slaying a descendant of supernatural beings.<br><br>This particular Marizu also had a hired bodyguard with superhuman martial prowess. During the confrontation, he knocked one of the Blades out of the air and into a nearby rock, which chipped it. Miguel showed remarkable initiative, not only convincing a stray cat to distract the bodyguard, but picking up the chipped blade, teleporting to the barbarian, and stabbing her in the heart with it. The Falcon Queen had accidentally injured herself some time ago, so perhaps it wasn&#39;t a true victory, but eatpraylove claimed the reward for her anyway.<br><br>Alas, for much of the year, eatpraylove was lost in or mired in paperwork from the Federation of Academia, and could only track down Marizu a bit at a time. But whenever she had a chance, she sought out her next target.<br><br>In November, weeks before the anniversary of her first quest, she confronted Wendi, a Pokhemman Marizu with the strength of a young bear and the intelligence of a fish. eatpraylove initially believed the Marizu girl to be a troll, so great were Wendi&#39;s offenses. She turned out to be human, but eatpraylove channeled the power of the sun through Chris (an old Pokhemman spell) and smote the barbarian with it regardless.<br><br>Ten days after slaying Wendi, she sent out a general call for assistance: &quot;I have set my eyes on a Marizu in Lotor, and while I know the works of the Great Professor, I am not his champion. Any who can assist me in deciding the barbarian&#39;s ultimate fate are welcome. Meet me at Castle Godreve. Payment to be discussed.&quot; Cipher the Merchant, a relatively new arrival to Plort, met her there bearing a grey spellbook and a longbow.<br><br>Dame eatpraylove brought only Chris and her loyal mare, Ami, on this quest, as five weapons and a fairy seemed a bit much for one Marizu. Unlike the Marizu she had read about so long ago, her current target respected the heroes of Medellurth even as she had a relationship (of sorts) with the legendary archer.<br><br>Cipher was mysteriously absent for weeks at a time, however, and eatpraylove still struggled to manage her affairs in the Federation. The two could not complete their quest to slay Evelyn until the following April. It was the second year since her arrival in Plort. During her absence (and with her permission), Skaer&#39;morys the Silver had borrowed the Blades of Violet Roses for use against another Kidd Icarrios ((spellcheck)) Marizu.<br><br>When eatpraylove and Cipher returned to her manor house, she paid him with the barbarian girl&#39;s sword and a young black cat she had rescued from the Falcon Queen&#39;s camp after the latter&#39;s death. Cipher had specifically requested the only female cat in the group as a gift in celebration of his then-pending pilgrimage, and now that he had completed it and they had met again, eatpraylove saw no better time to pay her debt.<br><br>To her great surprise, Miguel appeared soon after Cipher had left, carrying the Blades of Violet Roses. &quot;Oh...welcome home, my lady,&quot; he said. &quot;Forgive me for leaving the house without you, but a Marizu bulletin arrived soon after your departure that caught my eye. Do you remember that history of Rockbird Lake athletics you showed me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You enjoyed the passages on the Shark and the Dolphin&#39;s rivalry almost as much as I did,&quot; she said, making her way to Ami&#39;s stable. &quot;Are you telling me they found one of those barbarians there, too?&quot;<br><br>Miguel nodded. &quot;The bulletin said she claimed to be a childhood friend of the Dolphin, so I set off with the Blades to correct her. But...she wasn&#39;t like I&#39;d imagined a Marizu would be at all. She didn&#39;t focus on herself above her teammates, she wasn&#39;t stunningly beautiful, and she seemed to have legitimate training. She even apologized after I read her my list of grievances!&quot;<br><br>eatpraylove almost tripped over her own feet (which would have hurt, given her armor). &quot;You jest. A Marizu <i>apologized</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I swear by Kanun,&quot; said Miguel. &quot;Looking at her, I felt the way you must have felt when you found me and my mother in Natasha&#39;s tent. I thought, <i>Here is someone who may have committed some crimes, but deserves a second chance at life.</i> Fairies can&#39;t kill innocent creatures, so I cast a memory spell. She no longer knows the Dolphin and his team by anything other than reputation, and she lives with her mother now.&quot;<br><br>By this point, they were inside the stable already. eatpraylove finished hanging up Ami&#39;s tack and held out a hand for Miguel to land on. &quot;I didn&#39;t realize kindness was one of your many talents. You&#39;ve done well today, and I forgive your error. Now, would you please bring me Ami&#39;s brush and hoof pick?&quot;<br><br><br>eatpraylove is currently getting the records of her most recent quests in order and searching for a way into the Kar&#39;eer Forest. &quot;Many of the paths seem open from a distance, but every time I try to take one, the trees bunch up and prevent me from going any deeper,&quot; she writes in her diary. &quot;This is getting ridiculous, and frankly, I will not lose an endurance contest to a forest.&quot;<br><br>In addition, she has been teaching herself the magical arts of Beytah and Arpy ever since her first quest, with general success. She has received words of encouragement from other knights she knows, and a few stern words on using Beytah spells where they do not belong from Lady Iximaz. Her first attempts at Arpy were more mixed, and so she reserves those spells for festivals. She is willing to treat anyone who asks with her Beytah magic, but her skills do not extend to anything more severe than broken bones. </p>

            <p>Since nobody bothered to archive this yet, it obviously became the archivist’s apprentice’s duty.<br><br>This Baronial Council was held from the fourth of June until the eight of June in the city of Borrd.<br><br><b>Attendees:</b><br>Baron Cassie<br>Baron Huinesoron<br>Lady Iximaz (a baron of Plort)<br>Baron Juliette the Fourth (formerly known as Dann)<br>Baron PC<br>Baron Phobos<br>Baron Thanasius Ampelius<br>Baron Neshomeh did not travel to Borrd, but she signed <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277345;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board"> the Missive from Wechi</a> presented by the archivist’s apprentice.<br><br>Non-deciding attendees:<br>Alleb the Odd Civilian<br>Dame eatpralove<br>Dark Civilian Aakmal<br>Hieronymus the hermit (and archivist&#39;s apprentice)<br>Knight Eshakhar<br>Knight Jumper<br>Sir Ekyl<br>Ye Scape-Grace<br><br><b>Agenda:</b><br>The Fall of Ofum – Baron Huinesoron proposing to build two new military centers, Los Taelis in  southern Wechi and Ba-Korp in southern Ozerbord, and all infrastructure necessary for allowing the knights to sail into the war against the Marizu from Mei’n Payj and to fly into the war against the Marizu from Skypcht. <br><br>The Eastern Dilemma – Baron Huinesoron proposing to create a fifth nation, the Riding of Sittorese, in the underdeveloped western part of Iric.<br><br>A proposal by Lady Iximaz to give Critta-Kalthin status as a city. <br><br>A proposal by the resident baron to hold the festival celebrating victory over the ypurs at La Wunj. <br><br><b>Decisions:</b><br>Since none of the barons opposed, Ba-Korp has been founded in southern Ozerbord, on the border between Baronies Huinesoron and Thanasius Ampelius. By not saying anything, Baron Thanasius Ampelius has apparently agreed to expand the skyship port of Skypcht and increase the production of skyships as he sees fit.<br><br>Los Taelis has been founded near the Turaipod Heights. Although the absent Baron Neshomeh didn’t agree to anything, this proposal was supported by Dame eatpraylove, who is considered a resident of Wechi, and thus, by an application of Wechi’s common rule of non-objection, the Commonwealth of Wechi accepted responsibility for building and maintaining these military facilities.<br><br>The Riding of Sittorese has been founded. The Riders of Sittorese are permitted to choose their own form of civil government, but supplying the knights of Plort with grain (the Riding’s main purpose) is considered a military matter and the Riding is not allowed to self-govern itself out of this. This decision has been opposed by Baron Phobos. It has been supported by Baron Huinesoron, Lady Iximaz and in principle, before the last details were fixed, by Baron Juliette, Baron PC and, per signing the Missive from Wechi, by Baron Neshomeh.<br><br>Since none of the barons opposed, Critta-Kalthin has been upgraded to city status.<br><br>As far as this chronicler is aware, the Ypur Festival has not happened anywhere.<br><br>((I’m afraid I don’t hit the right Plort tone here, but it’s the best I can do. If it’s okay, I will put it on the redlink in the Plort wiki (which will force me to create a page for the Missive from Wechi to avoid a new redlink).<br><br>HG))</p>

            <p>The sprawling fortress of Worhkshap seemed to constantly echo with noise. Even now, in the early evening, silence was a rare commodity. Wandering scholars and lecturers were allowed to preach their wisdom in the main courtyard to whoever was willing to listen, and often had to shout over each other in order to be heard. Three of them were currently having a spirited debate over the em-dash and en-dash military formations. Someone had begun selling popcorn to the onlooking crowd.<br><br>Some of the smaller buildings housed small schools dedicated to the various magics often used in battle against the Marizu. Lectures may have ended for the day, but visitors would still be able to hear the scribbling of quills on paper and the quiet muttering of scholars going about their work. <br><br>In the great hall of Worhkshap itself, visitors exchanged stories of their triumphs and tragedies as they enjoyed a sumptuous feast. There was laughing, boasting, singing, and the occasional shout of &quot;Ha, yes!&quot; The conversation was only slightly muted near the head of the room, where a few people nervously looked at the empty seat of the baron and spoke quietly amongst themselves.<br><br>Almost none of those sounds reached the ears of Baron PC, the Poor Cynick. He was in his private chambers, buried in the heart of Worhkshap&#39;s keep. It was there that he crafted his ideas, wrote his proclamations, and honed his skills. The specialized stonework blocked out the noise so prevalent in the fortress, which was exactly how he had designed it to work. Silence helped him think.<br><br>That was the idea, anyway.<br><br>Baron PC was at his desk, scribbling away at an ink-spattered piece of parchment laid out before him. Surrounding it were maps, notes, and accounts gathered from across Weab. Every so often he would pause in his writing to check one of the reports, or consult something on a chart.<br><br>His expression changed, a harsh frown creasing his features. With a muttered curse, the baron crumpled up the parchment and threw it into the nearby fireplace. Judging from the amount of papery ash already in the hearth, this was not a new occurrence.<br><br>Baron PC let the quill slip from his fingers as he stood up. <i>So much has changed in such little time</i>, he thought. <i>The Marizu League makes strides, and despite recent successes we seem to be unable to dislodge them from their holdings. The new attacks in Marh Vale show that well enough.</i> He moved aside some papers to uncover some more reports, all written in code. <i>Sightings of Marizu lust-spirits are on the rise as well, especially in the lands of Ahr-Bihnder and Ruebee. Even this new mercenary power in Vidya Gaym, the O&#39;erwatch, seems to have fallen prey to them.</i><br><br>He sighed and rubbed his temples, all while trying to ignore the itching in his palms. It had been so much easier back when he was just a knight. Find where the Marizu were, ride in, and attack until exhaustion won the day. But those tactics would no longer do. Not with the responsibilities he now carried.<br><br>There was a knock at the door. Baron PC looked down at the desk, thought about making a token effort to straighten it up, then immediately dismissed said thought. &quot;Enter,&quot; he said.<br><br>The heavy door swung open, revealing his chamberlain. &quot;Your guests have been asking for you, my lord,&quot; he said, the barest hint of reproach in his voice.<br><br>&quot;If they have been asking specifically to speak with me, then they should already know that keep my own hours. I will meet with them when I am ready.&quot; Baron PC paused. &quot;But that is not the only reason you came up here, is it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, my lord.&quot; The chamberlain held out an envelope. The wax seal of the baronial council was extremely obvious. &quot;You have received a summons. The council meeting is at hand.&quot;<br><br>The baron nodded as he took the envelope and broke the seal. &quot;Of course. One of the many demands of this post that must be addressed. Arrange for transportation immediately.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes sir.&quot; The chamberlain paused. &quot;Will you be speaking with Baron Phobos about possibly connecting to the Knights&#39; Road?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That will definitely be on my list. I suppose he will attempt to exercise some sort of underhanded scheme to try and gain a greater profit than me.&quot; A small smile came to his lips, and one low laugh escaped his throat. &quot;Honestly? The thought of dealing with the blindingly obvious machinations of my fellow barons seems almost like fun. Certainly more fun than…&quot; He gestured to the crowded desk.<br><br>&quot;I shall go and arrange your escort, my lord,&quot; the chamberlain said as he retreated from the room.<br><br>Baron PC sat down at his desk as he read through the summons. Yes. Yes, perhaps this distraction was exactly what he needed to clear his head. The Marizu could wait. They were always going to be there.</p>

            <p>A figure of indistinct gender stood in the abandoned city of La Wunj, surveying their surroundings. Bundled under their arm was a large roll of fabric, which looked suspiciously like the flag of Iric. Perhaps not the original flag, but definitely a flag with the same colors. Had someone been there to observe the figure and discern their identity, it would be clear that this person was none other than Ser Data, a Knight of Plort who had served as both Dar and Op of Iric at various points during its height, before disappearing to parts unknown. Rumor has it that their journeys took them past the Mistwall, while those less kind say they simply hid from their duties in the city of Tamblor. Whatever the truth, it was a sure fact that not only had they never drawn the sword and dagger worn at their side, the weapons seemed to be bound to their sheaths. Data was certainly known more for political machinations, occasionally against their fellow Knights and the Barons, than for their campaigns against the Marizu<br>“Let’s see… If I’m going to set up the flag, I’m going to need somewhere high up to fly it. No point in bringing this back if no one can see it.”<br>Data looked around, and set their sights on the tallest building in the city, a ruined tower left over from the castle of Chaett. Not an easy climb, but worth it if their plan worked. With their goal in mind, they set out through the empty city streets. It was an eerily quiet journey, Data’s quiet humming being the only sound around. If everything worked, that would soon change though. If Data had their way, La Wunj would be returned to its former glory. The flag of Iric was merely meant as a beacon to let others know there was a presence in the city. While Data wasn’t too sure about this “Riding of Sittorese” that had sprung up in their absence, they had no real desire to resurrect the Republic of Iric. Their loyalty was to Plort and their city, not to the region the city was situated in, nor the frequently changing Baronies that laid claim to the city.<br>“... Shave his belly with a rusty razor… Hmmmm hmm hm. Oh, here we go. Whelp. Time to climb.”<br>Data took the rope tied around the flag and tied it around their torso, adjusted their weapons, and started to scale the bricks making up the wall of the tower. While free climbing the tallest structure in an abandoned city without someone to watch after you is not a great idea, it was hardly Data’s worst idea. The climb was not easy and several times Data slipped and only managed to catch themself at the last minute, but at the end they made it to the top, palms and knuckles scraped and bloody. They took a piece of chalk and wrote out an arcane formula on the turret of the tower, and used the blood from their hands to fuel it. Soon, there was an androgynous ethereal figure standing in front of them. Data untied the flag, and handed it to the spirit, who stiffly accepted it.<br>“Alright, your job is to fly the flag and watch the city. Keep an eye on people coming and going, and if any break the old rules, get rid of them. Wait no! I mean, if any break the rules, evict them from the city. Do NOT kill anyone. Please. Now, I suppose to make this official I’ll have to name you, huh? In that case, congratulations Shodan, you’re the new protector of La Wunj. Keep an eye on things for me, I have other preparations to make.”<br>The spirit unfurled the flag and set it flying in the wind, holding it up while its expressionless face surveyed the city. Data nodded, and began their descent. Minutes later, they were once again on the ground, after a short fall of the last four feet. After taking a few moments to recover and bandage their hands, they set out, heading for the next stop on their journey.<br><br>((Backstory/Biography will come eventually, this was just easier to write and I didn&#39;t want to lose momentum.))</p>

            <p>is obviously a sequel to <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Hieronymus">this</a>.<br><br>The humble hermits request was met with grace. But rather than finding the rest he had hoped for in that tiny corner at Arkive, the archivist’s new apprentice was immediately sent off to demonstrate and improve his Eich-Tee-Ehm-Ehl skills in the devastated lands.<br><br>While Hieronymus was supposed to travel between Arkive and the river Freewep, he somehow became sidetracked to the City of Borrd. He arrived just in time for the annually Baronial Council, where he barely escaped imprisonment and prosecution for treason and libel by Baron Thanasius Ampelius. Had he not conveniently gone lost in the wood of Kar’eer again, Hieronymus would certainly have talked his head off.<br><br>On his flight from the baron’s ire, the hermit fell into a dubious dungeon. But that is another story and shall be told on another day – if Hieronymus ever reveals how he got out of this maze again.<br><br>The way through the dungeon may have led to an alternate universe, for Hieronymus clearly remembers that he got out of the forest by following Baron Dann from Castle Tegnoh to La Wunj, where he attended a great festival, apparently held annually to celebrate a victory over the ypurs. His memories of spotting Dame Karrin the Blue and Baron Thanasius Ampelius, and making an awkward attempt to apologize, are much less clear. Before he could hear a response, Hieronymus fell to the floor, very drunken, rolled under a table, started to snore and never spoke another word in Iric. <br><br>When he woke up again, all the Ops and Dars of Iric were gone, La Wunj lay mostly abandoned, none of the few citizens Hieronymus still found remembered any recent festivities, and when he asked for Baron Dann, glares and stares were the only answers the hermit got, for everybody knows that south-eastern Plort is and always was ruled by the fair Baroness Delta Juliette. Thus, Hieronymus joined the last trek that left La Wunj to the east, and since he became more invested in the Riding of Sittorese, he travelled on until he reached the Empire of Fanvik-Neht, where he built a secret hermitage which he hopes will once become a stronghold of goodriding. <br><br>How he got across the ocean and then back again, is still one of many mysteries, but while the Baronial Council assembles again, the archivist’s apprentice is back to his job of dusting off old scrolls in Arkive. <i>Cetera censeo</i>, even if some strange fate takes him to Borrd again, Hieronymus the hermit should not be by common non-objection the Commonwealth of Wechi’s delegate at the Baronial Council of the Union of Plort. See? There is an objection.<br><br>((I had so hoped for an opportunity to finally put one line into the IRC while having an excuse to ignore all further discussion. Alas, it was not meant to be.))<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Phobos, Nesh, and I think the bottom two are July and VM? I&#39;m a little more shaky on those. I&#39;ve met Phobos and Nesh irl before so I recognize them. I&#39;ve met VM too, but she didn&#39;t have a ponytail at the time. Otherwise it does resemble her. I&#39;ve only seen of July, but the third one matches my memory of the photo.</p>

            <p>Here comes the story of... Sir Hardric. (so original)<br><br>Hardric was at first a mere denizen of Air&#39;ihpotre, without great knowledge of the lands of Weab. He didn’t really see the need to leave his home then, content with the horizon under his gaze, and mere reveries. <br><br>This was to change when, one day, he found in the warehouse of some merchant a copy of the first scroll of the art of Arpying, as it was described by the masters Gaigacks and Arrenson. Great was his interest in this art, and the possibilities it offered.<br><br>Still, he didn’t leave his home until the invasion of Air&#39;ihpotre by the Marizu. Unable to accept the changes brought in the new ‘kingdom’ of Roe Lin, Hardric left his home behind. For a long time he wandered through the wild lands of Weab, seeing new kingdoms, seeking new knowledge. He was, however, wary of the Marizu after seeing the desolation they could bring.<br><br>It wasn’t until years later that he found his way to the lands of Tivit. There he found more knowledge than he could ever dream of. It was there, several months later, that he heard about the tales of Jay, Acacia, and the land of Plort.<br><br>Through the discovery of such a place filled him with awe, he didn’t muster the courage to go to this land for several months. Still, he finally traveled to the island, and was welcomed like a friend. Most of his time was spent wandering between Borrd, Wechi, and De’endee with its great libraries.<br><br>The tales of the exploits of the knights and barons of Plort had steered him to come to this island, so naturally he decided to train in order to join them, eager to write his own story beside them.<br><br>However, his brash behavior, and his difficulties to follow Spelin’s commands, stalled his training, forcing him to follow thrice the Knight’s Road before being finally knighted by Lady Iximaz and earning the title of Sir.<br><br>As a knight, his main weapons are sword and magic, for he believes in the dual power of body and mind. He began his travels with only a grosse messer. This weapon is named Legard. For magic, Hardric mainly uses spells drawn from a tome found in the lands of JaiButcharh, in the fief of Air&#39;ihdresd, and which belonged to a wizard called Nicodelli. He still calls the tome by that name in order to honor the wizard.<br><br>He’s also an adept of many styles of Arpying. Although the words Gaigacks and Arrenson are still dear to his heart, he mainly uses two other styles: the Faituh style, where the new face is created through focusing on key events from the face’s past, and the Perusonah style, named after one of the fiefs of the deadly Athlusian Dominion, a land of conflict between law and chaos where the power of demon summoning reigns supreme. The practitioner does not create a wholly new face here, but musters his willpower in order to overcome his daily doubts and inner darkness, thus earning great power. But should the spirit of the practitioner waver, this same darkness would consume him in no time.<br><br>His Inglish heraldry is: <br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Untitled.png"><br>Per fess, argent and sable, an eagle displayed gules with wings elevated, a twenty-faced die argent beneath a sword argent crossed with a pen argent. <br><br>His Alvish heraldry is:<br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/HardricAlvish1.png"><br>Ner white, rena black: canta nastar alta tera, red heraldic eagle tail; canta miri, crossed white sword and red-tipped white feather; indil in fore, white twenty-sided die.<br><br>((My thanks to Huinesoron for betaing this and doing the heraldry.))</p>

So it would be inadvisable for a human agent to remain a human if they were in a <i>Narnia</i> badfic that took place during the timeline of that book.<br><br><br>But what if an agent forgot this, and did remain as a human while in the badfic, therefore breaking canon.

            <p>Some agents are given missions in continua they aren&#39;t even casual fans of. Okay, the one I&#39;m thinking of was an RPF, so the agents were at least familiar with the <i>world</i> in which it was set, but they knew nothing whatsoever about the &quot;characters.&quot; They missed some charges and charged for some things which weren&#39;t actually OOC...it was a mess. But it was canon to the PPC, so we must work with the knowledge that this does happen sometimes. <br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>That the DORKS might not do it automatically unless it was a special one.  It would probably be up to the canon on how much it dislikes humans.  I have seen an andelite run around a human world without problems.<br><br>In the case of Lion witch and Wardrobe, canon would probably accept random humans in Narnia.  There were humans on the planet that contains Narnia, descendants of Frank and Calormorenes.  (Gets bit by mini-dragon.)  I was actually under the impression that humans wandered in from elsewhere often enough that the witch got one during Tumnus&#39; lifetime.</p>

            <p>(I know, I&#39;m a terrible person for not reading it. Join the LotR people on the left.)<br><br>Anyway, my guess would be for humans to be basically acceptable because beings so similar to humans as to make no real difference seem to appear throughout Narnia; I may be completely wrong on this point.<br><br>To put it another way: IF basically-human characters appear in the Narnia series, then humans should be fine, just as they are in Star Wars despite humans technically not existing there.<br><br>If I&#39;m wrong, then I doubt the DORKS would fix it automatically. The Ironic Overpower wouldn&#39;t let that just slide; it would be milked for all the drama and comedy it&#39;s worth.</p>

            <p>So... I&#39;ve been wondering something... If an agent from the Star Wars continuum were in another continuum, like Harry Potter or something, would they not have their Force abilities? Given that DORKS change DNA, and the ability to sense and use the Force comes through special cells in the blood, it could... But then again, that means they wouldn&#39;t have an ability that they have always had. The Jedi/Sith/Adept/etc. would suddenly be without an ability that they literally use 24/7, an ability that is a big part in making them who they are. So... Yeah. That&#39;s what I&#39;m puzzling over.</p>

            <p>The Force is a mystical energy field that binds all life - from an ant to the universe and all galaxies - together. It&#39;s always there, wether you can sense it or not. And the way you sense it, and the measure of how well you can use it, depends on the number of midi-chlorians in the body that the Force can use to communicate with an individual. According to Qui-Gon Jinn, &quot;Without the midi-chlorians, life would not exist.&quot;</p>

            <p>Life in other canons can have no midi-chlorians just fine, so I would think a lack of them in disguise would make sense. Certainly using the Force in a flashy manner, e.g. Sith lightning, would be out of place in non-Star Wars realms. Disguises tend to be maintained even when making arrests; ergo, no Force abilities for the whole sporking.<br><br>As for really subtle powers, e.g. &quot;Jedi Mind Tricks&quot; or passive senses, are more dicey. I realize I&#39;m just repeating myself when I say that senses are &quot;translated&quot; from the disguise to the mind of the Agent, solving the problem of blind Force-sensitive Agents, but I&#39;ll say it one last time here anyway.</p>

            <p>I think that each world works differently, down to the smallest level. Certain powers just wouldn&#39;t translate. If you need to draw energy from some source for your powers, that would be a problem. (ex. The people on Lore from various Artix Entertainment games live on a planet with a core made out of mana, which gives them their magic.) But since The Force comes from the midi-chlorians in your bloodstream, it all depends on whether the DORKS simply overwrites your appearance, or your body, down to the smallest level. In a continum, I believe that a Force-user would not be able to sense anything, simply because there are no midi-chlorians present within the organisms in that continum. Of course, I do not know whether The Force allows you to sense life, or midi-chlorians. So someone from the Lands of Rising Evil would be without magic, but I do believe that someone who is Force-Sensitive would be the same, but externally, the powers would work differently.</p>

            <p>...allow agents to go flinging people and objects around on a whim.

            <p>Personally my stance on it is the old &quot;power corrupts&quot; cliche. It&#39;s a personality thing, not a mystical one, which is why certain Jedi can live their entire lives without succumbing to the Dark Side, some fall almost immediately, and some realize both sides are rediculous and go live in a cave as Grey Jedi.<br><br>As for using the Force outside of Star Wars fics, my take on it is the same as all special powers: If your powers rely on the existence of an outside force (The Force, ambient magic, the Dark Dimension, whatever) then they don&#39;t work in verses where that force is absent. If they are natural born or otherwise part of you (mutants, super soldiers, timelords, aliens, etc.) then you can use them, though doing so may not be the best idea. Because even if you buy into the whole midichlorians thing, they only allow you to tap into the Force. Without the Force there to tap into, you&#39;re just a person with really odd cells in your bloodstream.</p>

            <p>I mean, the Jedi are all talking about the lifee and harmony with the Force, but life <i>implies</i> emotions, and you cannot run away from the forever. Besides, some emotions, like compassion, are worth feeling. And in my opinion, the best way to keep emotions uncer control is by acknowledging them, then compose with them, not suppressing the heck out of them. That&#39;s recipe for a total breakdown.<br><br>When I began thinking about this, I always found this  ridiculious that Jedi are all talking about compassion and harmony when the real logic end of their argument would be something like a living droid, feeling no emotion, and a total, uncopromising justice. In fact, I came to see Light/Dark dichotomy as a Chaos/Order one, with both of the extrems just as harmful as the other. (Although the DS seemingly goes to the extreme faster, leading to the &#39;evil&#39;)<br><br>In short, you can rsume my opinion about the &#39;sides&#39; to the Yin Yang symbol: You can only begin to have an order once you admit the existence of your inner weaknesses and limits, and you have to be the eye of the storm if you want to follow your emotions, or they&#39;ll chain you more than anything else could ever do. (A reason I liked the fact the first Force practicioners had to balance both sides.)</p>

Possibly even better at navigating HQ because it can&#39;t pull any visual tricks on them), or they universe they&#39;re in would compensate by heightening their other senses to the point that while they still can&#39;t &quot;see&quot; they have virtually no difficulty with perceiving things aside from colors and, like, celestial objects.<br><br>Though there are certainly some creatures from some continua that simply couldn&#39;t exist in what would essentially be &quot;hostile&quot; continua, or wouldn&#39;t be suited for the PPC because without benefits that they have in their home world they are severely disabled.</p>

            <p>Probably, they would remain blind even if they changed species; after all, the DORKS handles sensation &quot;translation.&quot; Perhaps they&#39;d perceive the world as if they still had the Force, only not be able to see through walls and whatnot.<br><br>Considering the HQ is constructed across several worlds, it would be funny to see these characters intermittently losing their powers just wandering to the cafeteria!</p>

            <p>The operation of the disguise generator is very much in the &#39;unless you hadn&#39;t noticed&#39; vein. Selene, for instance, is always a vampire, whatever her disguise. Dafydd always has exceptionally good vision (due to being an elf). But a Pokemon agent doesn&#39;t keep their powers when disguised as a human.<br><br>If you want an answer, I&#39;d say it depends on how skilled the person setting the disguise is. The default disguises overwrite you completely, down to DNA and microbiome level, so you lose the Force, the ability to regenerate, immunities, even any diseases you might have. When you take the disguise off, it reverts you to the exact state you were in.<br><br>But most agents don&#39;t like being <i>completely</i> not themselves. It probably has a big, <i>Animorphs</i>-flavoured downside: either it recreates your brain and leaves you half-thinking like your disguise, or it doesn&#39;t and you end up with instincts that don&#39;t match your body. So they practice, and fiddle with the advanced settings, and customise their disguise settings.<br><br>Some agents simply change their appearance, keeping their bodies the same - Selene and Dafydd probably do this. Some will change specific parts of themselves, keeping some attributes as normal and losing/gaining others. It depends on the agent.<br><br>Other disguise-related thoughts:<br><br>-It&#39;s clear that the generator stores your old bodyplan in a format that maps 1:1 to your new one. When something changes - an arrow gets stuck in you, for instance - that change is carried over when you change back. When something changes to the point that it would be incompatible with life - such as your entire DNA structure changing in a regeneration - it becomes impossible for you to change back.<br><br>-I imagine the mapping goes the other way, too: if you&#39;re missing a hand and put on a disguise, the disguise will also lack that hand. You don&#39;t have the nerves and muscles to move it any more. But Dafydd doesn&#39;t intend to put on a disguise ever again, so this is just my thought, not canon.<br><br>-I bet people use disguises for way more than just missions. <sup>_~</sup> In a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14UrOpK7pBImoK0cdvBk_BrVK9KVJRj6Og2THWBjmYhQ/pub">canon-friendly AU fic</a>, I coined the terms &#39;wrought&#39; and &#39;mardy&#39;, meaning &#39;attracted to a specific person whether they’re currently your preferred sex or not&#39; and &#39;someone who’s attracted to their partner, but only when they’re both in disguise&#39; respectively. Given that disguise generators let you change sex on a whim... yeah, there&#39;s a reason they&#39;re not supposed to work in HQ, no-one would get anything done.<br><br>-Come to think of it, there are probably some agents running around in mild disguise all the time. You know how some people are severely uncomfortable with their bodies? This is a technology that can just <i>change that</i>. And let&#39;s not even start on the possibilities for advanced mental tweaking...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>and with all of the other points and the text above them, I&#39;d imagine it&#39;d be safe to assume that, as it knocks about with DNA and whatnot, it won&#39;t work on non-organics. <br>Immortality continues to be out of reach for Finch, the poor bugger. <br><br>I just wonder what would happen with people who have prosthetics. <br>It&#39;s probably just as safe to assume that they go the same place clothes go, but I do like the image of a hulking troll-beast with a wooden peg the size of his toe for a left foot. <br>You could play some brilliant pranks with a disguise generator. &#39;Footstool in my appendix&#39; type brilliant pranks. </p>

            <p><i>My heart!</i> <br><br>You wouldn&#39;t think those games would hurt so much. They&#39;re the brightest looking things you&#39;d ever see, filled with cute little animal things going on adventures, with little scarf thingos around their necks. <br>I can barely remember the names of my friends from my old schools, but the final level theme from Blue Rescue Team is engraved right into my head. <br><br>You played the newer ones? 3d graphics, and all? <br>I&#39;ve heard that they&#39;re not as good as the original ones, but I wouldn&#39;t know. </p>

            <p>Erm...<br><br>*goes and digs out the game case*<br><br><i>Gates to Infinity</i>, that&#39;s what it&#39;s called. I played it almost to the final boss, got fed up, and quit. The story&#39;s not as engaging and you&#39;re limited to Snivy, Oshawott, Tepig, Pikachu, and Axew as the &#39;mons you and your partner can play. <i>Rescue Team</i> and <i>Explorers</i> were so much better. :(</p>

            <p>The best parts of the other games were the stories, and being able to play as the weird non-starters. <br>Sure, this new one has Axew and Pikachu, but Explorers had Munchlax! Hell, Blue Rescue Team had a <i>Cubone</i>! <br>It&#39;s probably safe to assume another one will come out. Here&#39;s hoping they do better, eh? <br><br>Thanks for sharing your opinion, Anonymous.

            <p>Just going to head things off here: <i>My Immortal</i> will not feature the Aviator giving birth. It took me two years to reach 60 missions; it&#39;ll take me about another year and a half before I hit 100, when I plan to tackle that beast.

            <p>I thnk this story takes the cake for stupid. Only fanfic stupider I read is a trollfic.

            <p>I mean, it&#39;s not like you written the longest spin-off in PPC featuring one character, with a quality always here since the beginning and a fascinating storyline...<br><br>I can understand this. When I saw the trollfic I mentionned, I first thouht the author had gone bonkers. Ten I asked the opinion of a <i>Madoka</i> professional,, aka Sergio, and he told me it was indeed a trollfic.

            <p>The Aviator&#39;s a tad stubborn, if you haven&#39;t noticed. The conversation would probably run in circles for a few hours while she wallows in that all-too-pervasive Time Lord Angst (TM). And repetition gets pretty boring after the third time.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve heard a lot of things about the game— mostly negative— so how is the state of the game right now? I hear that you essentially have to buy the base game and all of the DLC on top of that in order to have a semblance of a decent game. <br><br>Aside from the price of all that, y&#39;know. Might as well get the Witcher III and play a complete AAA title for a great price, right? </p>

            <p>And honestly you can get the base game + all current DLC for less than the Witcher III if you buy the Taken King Edition from a game store. Honestly the only downside I&#39;ve experienced is that you can&#39;t get too attached to any one set of equipment because you are constantly finding better things.</p>

            <p>The <i>Warcraft</i> movie, based on the RTS of the same name and drawing heavily from retcons introduced in <i>World of Warcraft</i>, came out recently and I got to see it for the first time today. My family&#39;s going to see it in IMAX later this week and I&#39;m super-pumped for the second viewing. I thought it was a pretty good movie, taking the lore, blending it, and remixing it in such a way as to be better presented on the big screen, rather than a game.<br><br>I won&#39;t deny there were some pretty narmy bits in it, like Garona crowd-surfing over a battlefield or the orcs chanting &quot;Zug! Zug! Zug! Zug!&quot; as their victory cry (In the games, zug-zug means &quot;yes-yes&quot; or &quot;okay&quot;, like &quot;okay, I&#39;ll do it&quot;), but overall it was an excellent movie and I was squeeing the whole way through watching it earlier. So I&#39;m hyped to see it again. :D<br><br>...And while I&#39;m speaking of WoW, the next expansion, <i>Legion</i>, comes out in a little less than two months now. I&#39;m not looking forward to having to learn the new raids <s>and coaching the rest of the raid team on the fights</s>, but everything else? Yespleasegivemoredowant.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m personally still keeping my fingers crossed for an Old Gods expansion next. That would be so freaking awesome. :D<br><br>And change isn&#39;t a bad thing in and of itself; in fact, after the essentially dead-end storyline of WoD, I&#39;m excited to see big things actually happening to Azeroth. I wasn&#39;t around for Cataclysm, so seeing something happen to the world itself will be big for me. As for characters dying... I&#39;m honestly glad. I hate it when you have a game called freaking <i>World of</i> War<i>craft</i> and nobody important dies. It starts to get dull and unsuspenseful after too long.</p>

            <p>Hello, and welcome aBoard! For your newbie gift, take this plate of freshly-made SPaGhetti! I found this place through TV Tropes as well and it&#39;s pretty great. They&#39;ve not been able to get rid of me yet. :P<br><br>If you haven&#39;t yet read them, may I point you towards <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/">the Original Series</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">the Constitution</a>? They&#39;re pretty much the only required reading around these parts. Another useful resource you might use is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki&lt;br%20/&gt;">the Wiki</a>; if you have any questions, just look here before asking. We like it when newbies do the research. ;)<br><br>Let&#39;s see, what else... oh, yes! What are some of your fandoms?<br><br>That&#39;s about it from me. Hope you like it here!</p>

            <p>Hey, thanks! I definitely read the Original Series before deciding to join, and read the Constitution, too. The Wiki has been quite helpful with the quirkier pieces of story.<br><br>In terms of fandoms, I like The Elder Scrolls, Harry Potter (of course), and the Symphony of Ages books. Been meaning to get into the Dresdenverse, too, but haven&#39;t gotten there yet!</p>

Eleven Orlando police officers and three Orange County sheriff&#39;s deputies exchanged fire with Mateen, authorities said. City officials said there were about 300 people inside the club at the time of the shooting.<br><br>The incident is being investigated as an act of terrorism.<br><br>Seddique Mir Mateen, Mateen&#39;s father, told NBC News, &quot;this has nothing to do with religion.&quot; Mateen said his son got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago and thinks that may be related to the shooting.<br><br>[...]<br><br>Six of the 50 victims were identified Sunday afternoon as Edward Sotomayor Jr., Stanley Almodovar III, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, Juan Ramon Guerrero, Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera and Peter O. Gonzalez-Cruz. Officials said more names would be released as family members of the dead were notified.<br><br>Many Muslim groups swiftly rebuked the attack Sunday.<br><br>&quot;We condemn this monstrous attack and offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed or injured. The Muslim community joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence,&quot; the Council on American-Islamic Relations Orlando Regional Coordinator Rasha Mubarak said in a statement.<br><br>President Barack Obama said Sunday afternoon that the &quot;massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub.&quot;<br><br>[...]<br><br>The shooting at the nightclub comes during a series of national celebrations that mark LGBT pride month.<br><br>The owner of Pulse said in a statement Sunday that she was &quot;devastated.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Pulse, and the men and women who work there, have been my family for nearly 15 years,&quot; said Barbara Poma. &quot;From the beginning, Pulse has served as a place of love and acceptance for the LGBTQ community.

            <p>Individually, yes (I&#39;m researching gun-violence-prevention organizations to volunteer with -- I need to do community service for school anyway), but also as a PPC community. World One needs protecting too, before it careens off into somewhere warped, somewhere we don&#39;t want to live. <br><br>The fantastic thing about the PPC is that we all listen to each other&#39;s perspectives and respond thoughtfully and respectfully. I propose we share our thoughtful, respectful responses with the world. Let&#39;s make a collection of our writing about the topic -- from hS&#39;s graphs, to Alleb&#39;s defense of guns as a safeguard against tyranny, to Plort stories about violence. Let&#39;s share it all over the web. Let&#39;s print out copies and leave them in coffee shops and community centers. (Or maybe we could <i>sell</i> copies, and give the money to a gun-violence prevention charity all the contributors can agree on.) <br><br>I think a multinational, multiple perspective collection could get people to realize that real debate and discussion is possible. Maybe if more and more people realized that, we would see some real change. <br><br>Would other people be interested in doing that? Does anyone else have an idea for a way we can take action?</p>

            <p>&quot;What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.&quot;<br>-- James 2: 14-17, The Holy Bible (New International Version)<br><br>Sign petitions. Vote for changes to these laws. <i>Do something</i>. Because while prayer might make you feel like you&#39;re doing something for the families and memories of those affected, nobody <i>just</i> prays for the families and memories of people ploughed into by drunk drivers; far-reaching laws were enacted and, surprise surprise, rates of drunk driving (and therefore the incidence of fatalities) dropped like a rock.<br><br>I remember when you people had Sandy Hook. I remember everyone who offered their prayers, who said &quot;Never again&quot;. And guess what? The United States has had, at the last count, 998 mass shootings since then. Nearly a thousand. How many more people have to die before you people stop praying and start <i>helping</i>? Because I guarantee you that the only person you&#39;re actually helping when you sit in a dark room with your eyes closed wishing the bad things away is you.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry. This one hit a nerve. I don&#39;t begrudge anybody their faith, and taking refuge in that faith after an atrocity is perfectly reasonable; it is not my intention to attack the faithful for their beliefs, and if that&#39;s what you&#39;re taking from this rant then I apologise. It&#39;s just that when it comes to the mass murders of innocent people with privately-owned automatic weaponry you can buy in <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/helen_ubinas/20160614_Ubinas__I_bought_an_AR-15_semi-automatic_rifle_in_Philly_in_7_minutes.html?mobi=true">seven bloody minutes</a>, I get sick and tired of prayer being the only thing people try in order to prevent them.<br><br>I&#39;m also sure your prayers are appreciated, but while the spiritual is important, we have to align those thoughts with the temporal world. Do more to prevent this. You have a voice. Pray with it, and shout with it, and use it to speak up for the dead so that more innocent souls don&#39;t join them. Please.<br><br>I&#39;m just sick of people being killed <i>en masse</i> and even more so of people insisting that there&#39;s nothing that can be done about it.</p>

            <p>I think you look at the tragedy, and you say: what if he hadn&#39;t been able to get a gun? There would have been no deaths. But I think: what if every designated driver inside and outside of Pulse had been armed? <br><br>I think that if laws are put into place restricting guns to the extent that many--I don&#39;t know how far you think it ought to go, but I know some people go pretty far--people want, it will only succeed in disarming law-abiding people. The mass murderers, the rapists, the thieves: they&#39;ll still have guns, because they don&#39;t care about laws. Sure, it may be a bit harder to get them, they&#39;d be more expensive, but once they have them there&#39;s no chance that any citizen they decided to target will be able to fight back. <br><br>Anyway, let me put it this way. I&#39;m in a strange part of town, alone. I&#39;m walking home. A man steps out of the alley with a knife, tells me to follow him into the alley. Do I want to have a gun at that moment? <i>Yes</i>.<br><br>Well, those are my thoughts, FWTW. I&#39;m not much for debate on the Board, but would you be willing to email more about this?

            <p>A bit of background: My family owns guns, many of which are heirlooms passed down through my dad&#39;s side. My dad has a special license to carry a concealed handgun on an airplane because he&#39;s a pilot, and his company doesn&#39;t want him unarmed should terrorists attempt to take over. Both my parents are ex-military and we often go to an outdoor shooting range when the weather is nice. I enjoy shooting guns—there&#39;s not really anything more satisfying than shooting a ping-pong ball off a golf tee at fifty yards. <br><br><i><b>However</b></i>, my parents instilled in me from a very young age that guns are deadly weapons that you always handle as if loaded, and you never, <i>ever</i> point it at anything you don&#39;t intend to shoot. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for everyone; I can&#39;t help but think of those stories you hear on the news about toddlers accidentally shooting themselves because a parent left a loaded handgun unattended somewhere a small child could easily reach, instead of unloaded and locked away in a safe.<br><br>I knew gun laws were lax in America, but I didn&#39;t really know <i>how</i> lax they were until I took a look at <a href="https://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/state-gun-laws/indiana/">my own state&#39;s laws.</a><br><br>&quot;No state permit is required for the possession of a rifle, shotgun, or handgun.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m sorry, what?

            <p>First off, to Alleb: Don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s you against the world (or in this case, the Board):<br>a) you&#39;re not the only conservative here the Board, and<br>b) from what I&#39;ve seen so far, everyone who has responded has been reasonable in their responses—though some are clearly passionate as well. Such reasoned discussion is, sadly, a rarity on the Internet. I&#39;m not one for on-Board debate myself, but don&#39;t be afraid to mix it up here, as long as you can be respectful about it.<br><br>Which leads me to the second thing I want to say, this time to everyone: having heard the gun-control arguments through the lens of conservative talk radio, I had no idea that there might actually be something to the pro-gun-control argument; I thought that it was all naпve idealism. However, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=298199;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">the stats that hS compiled</a>, as well as the arguments from <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=298207;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Des</a> (illegal guns aren&#39;t easy to get), <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=298208;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Neshomeh</a> (more guns don&#39;t necessarily make communities safer), and <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=298209;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Kaitlyn</a> (criminals may not care about laws, but small-time criminals <i>do</i> care about feasibility) are making me take a closer look at what I thought was the <i>obviously</i> right answer.<br><br>If only politicians were as concerned with actual debate as they are with getting their sound bites heard by their respective echo chambers. The citizenry might actually—gasp!—<i>starting think for themselves!</i> And a legislature might—oh, the horror!—actually get meaningful things done!</p>

            <p>But... well... there&#39;s that one phrase that Spider-Man constantly brings up: with great power comes great responsibility.<br><br>Firearms are a great power. But not everyone is responsible enough to handle that kind of power. People are prone to fits of passion, or darkest despair, and easy access to firearms makes those moments disastrous.<br><br>Unfortunately... I think that wanting to do anything about it is just wishful thinking.

            <p>As someone who has worked around large numbers of U.S. public for years now, I would not trust nearly ALL of my zoo guests I&#39;ve interacted with with a gun.  In my experience, people are thoughtless, lazy, and easily get angry.  Being around someone like that in a moment of actual danger sounds much more frightening than being in an aggressive animal&#39;s yard alone, even if the gun weilder is &quot;on my side.&quot;  At least I know the animal will attack me; I have no clue what the armed human is going to do.<br><br>—doctorlit really hates people, in case that wasn&#39;t clear yet</p>

            <p>Putting them into terms I can actually test for, I see two hypotheses in your post:<br><br>1/ After a certain point, increased number of guns decreases the number of firearm-related homicides, and possibly the total number of homicides.<br><br>2/ (After a certain point,) increased number of guns decreases the number of rapes.<br><br>Here&#39;s how I propose to test them:<br><br>I will plot graphs of countries for which these data are available. I will sanitise the dataset by removing Africa and South America entirely - a lot of those countries, the large numbers of guns are in the hands of paramilitary groups.<br><br>I know Wikipedia has the data for hypothesis one (I used it in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=298199;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this post</a>). I don&#39;t know whether it has rape data, but I&#39;m guessing I can find it (which is why I chose rape over thefts-in-dark-alleys). I don&#39;t know what the numbers will say.<br><br>Do you agree with the hypotheses as stated? I don&#39;t want to misrepresent you or the data.

            <p>I&#39;ll let you draw your own conclusions. Since the US has the highest gun ownership per head in the world, it&#39;s always going to be the point on the far-right of the graphs.<br><br><b>#1: Firearm Homicides against Gun Ownership</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/FirearmHomicidesvGuns_1.png"><br><br>The following countries have a firearms homicide rate greater than 4, and are thus excluded from the large graph:<br><br>Honduras, Jamaica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Panama, Philippines, Mexico, Costa Rica.<br><br>Along with Nicaragua, these are the only countries in the dataset with lower gun-ownership and higher firearms-homicide rates than the United States.<br><br><b>#2: Firearm Suicides against Gun Ownership</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/FirearmSuicidesvGuns.png"><br><br>There&#39;s... not a whole lot to say about that; it&#39;s a straight-line graph. Also a fairly obvious fact.<br><br><b>#3: Total Homicides against Gun Ownership</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/HomicidesvGuns.png"><br><br>The US is the single point out at the far right, again. The following countries have a higher homicide rate than the US:<br><br>Honduras, El Salvador, Jamaica, Belize, Guatemala, Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago, Dominican Republic, Panama, Mexico, Turkmenistan, Bolivia, Uganda, Mauritania, Papua New Guinea, Haiti, Costa Rica, Philippines, Russia, Barbados, Tanzania, Senegal, Iraq, Comoros, Kazakhstan, Eritrea, Pakistan, Mongolia, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, Lithuania, Yemen, Lebanon, Ukraine, Solomon Islands, Cuba, Albania, Burundi, Fiji.<br><br>I&#39;m including these lists, by the way, because these are the countries our hypothesis says we should be looking at to see whether their lower gun-ownership is the cause of their higher homicide rates.<br><br><b>#4: Total Suicides against Gun Ownership</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/SuicidesvGuns.png"><br><br>Again, the US is out on the far right (which is really useful!). The following countries have a higher suicide rate than the US:<br><br>South Korea, Sri Lanka, Lithuania, Tanzania, Nepal, Kazakhstan, Burundi, India, Turkmenistan, Russia, Uganda, Hungary, Japan, Belarus, Bhutan, Comoros, Ukraine, Poland, Eritrea, Latvia, Montenegro, Finland, Belgium, Iceland, Moldova, Estonia, El Salvador, Trinidad and Tobago, Czech Republic, Serbia, Slovenia, Papua New Guinea, France, Bolivia<br><br><b>#5: Total Reported Rapes against Gun Ownership</b><br><br>(Where &#39;reported&#39; means &#39;reported by the country to the surveyors&#39;)<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/RapesvGuns.png"><br><br>And here are the countries with higher reported rape stats than the US:<br><br>Sweden, Costa Rica, Pakistan, Australia, Panama, Belgium<br><br>Having gotten past my initial &#39;dear sweet mercy America&#39; reaction, I&#39;m going to be generous and assume this is mostly down to <i>reporting</i> differences, rather than America being a hideous festering pit of evil or something.<br><br>But seriously.

            <p>To wit, that it&#39;s really hard to get illegal guns, not to mention, y&#39;know, illegal. You can run afoul of the black market; you can fall for a police sting; etc etc. Disarming the general populace would also reduce the amount of criminals with guns simply because it will be harder for them to get guns. You can see the effects of such an environment right here in Israel — there&#39;s a reason the recent terrorism wave is a knife-and-car wave and not a shooting wave. Even the Sarona attack last week was performed with an improvised weapon. If Israel would&#39;ve been like the States, we wouldn&#39;t be looking at four dead, six wounded and two wounded terrorists; we&#39;ve been looking at ten times those numbers. </p>

            <p>...is that they have an incredibly powerful gun lobby that essentially has the government by the throat. The National Rifle Association is backed by the USA&#39;s gun culture and is incredibly difficult to ignore. They are the ones pushing the rhetoric where a safe America is an armed America-- a statement that is about as inane as saying &quot;if you stab everyone you meet, you&#39;ll never have to worry about getting stabbed yourself&quot;. After all, a little bit of mass paranoia never hurt anyone, eh? Furthermore, what could possibly go wrong when you have a bunch of angry people and some easily-accessible weapons?<br><br>I find it interesting that there&#39;s such a vehement defence of easy access to guns after every mass shooting -- it&#39;s quite telling of what the real priorities are here: who cares about the dead people? They&#39;re going to take away my guns and my rights! <br><br>Etc, etc.  </p>

            <p>/r/news delivered an &quot;apology,&quot; however, there&#39;s a reason the post is about to hit the negatives. Several, actually:<br><br>-Their lack of judgement lead them to delaying the removal of a moderator so toxic it almost killed me <i>way</i> too long.<br>-The mods claimed that all of the crap going down was related to brigades and hate speech. <b>This is entirely false.</b> All posts removed were removed for, as said earlier, mentioning Radical Islam (note the capital &quot;R&quot;) and <i>blood donations.</i><br>-All in all, they have failed a majority of Reddit&#39;s collective population as a whole, and are refusing to acknowledge this, instead blaming it on the &quot;troll&quot; scapegoat whose mere existence is tenuous at best and occupying negative space at worst in times like this.<br>-The admins aren&#39;t helping either. It&#39;s strongly implied their statement they made and the actions they took following the controversy were really just an attempt to kick /r/The_Donald off of /r/all. I don&#39;t support Trump, but suppressing a non-hate sub, <i>period</i> is unacceptable on Reddit. At this rate, Spez (the admin behind this part of the controversy) will become the next Ellen Pao despite being her replacement specifically to fix everything wrong with her position.<br><br>Where&#39;s a giant bucket of popcorn when you need one?

            <p>I can completely understand removing posts about radical Islam as that&#39;a a red herring being used to detract from the actual motive behind the attack, and I imagine, based on what i&#39;ve seen elsewhere the posts were rather Islamiphobic.

            <p>It was amazing to see so many members of my community gathered in one place to mourn - and terrifying to see the police presence. We can&#39;t even gather on Capitol Hill in Seattle without being in danger.<br><br>As my friend Laurel would put it: Much love, and solidarity in all our struggles.</p>

            <p>Is that I won&#39;t say what he did was right. It&#39;s wrong to just discriminate against people like that, and it&#39;s worse to kill because of that discrimination. But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s impossible to understand. Everybody has motivations. Even the most hateful or most insane of people have their reasons for doing things, and even if we don&#39;t agree with what they&#39;re doing or why they&#39;re doing it, it&#39;s important to understand why they&#39;re doing it, if only to keep it from happening again. It&#39;s wrong for something like this to happen. It&#39;s worse to let it blind us to the fact that this was a human being, with thoughts and feelings and reasons for doing everything he did who did this. It&#39;s worse to allow this to cause us to hate someone without even trying to comprehend who they are, even if they are dead. When something like this happens, it&#39;s easy to put yourself in the shoes of the victims. It&#39;s a lot harder to put yourself in the shoes of the perpetrator, but it&#39;s something that must be done. After all, the reason this happened could be said to be because this person didn&#39;t understand that just because love is between two people of the same sex, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that it is love. If we allow ourselves to give up our understanding, then we become monsters. We won&#39;t condone what he did, because it was wrong. We will understand him, because to not do so would be to become him.</p>

            <p>I think this is a very important message.

            <p>The shooter certainly isn&#39;t all of any of the groups mentioned.

<li>I&#39;m not sure why you write as though I needed to be corrected as to the Orlando shooter&#39;s identity.

You are factually incorrect. My parents-in-law, and a good number of my extended family, for that matter, are Christians of various denominations and of none. Also, I&#39;ve been meeting with a Jehovah&#39;s Witness couple every two weeks or so for a few years, because when I was working from home I was isolated and lonely and decided that expanding my worldview by learning what they believe was as good a way as any to get some human contact.

They are homophobic, unless the definition changed when I wasn&#39;t looking; they are <i>not</i> celebrating violence or wishing anyone would do more of it.<br><br>More compassion, less prejudice, please.

            <p>It&#39;s a strong word, and is sometimes used to refer to moral outrage as well as just being grossed out (e.g. &quot;I&#39;m disgusted by your behaviour! How dare you scream scatological profanities at your six-year old cousin!&quot;) Perhaps a better way to put it would be to say that you&#39;re grossed out, repulsed*, or squicked** by gay sex, or you think it&#39;s icky, or you don&#39;t like to think about the details. (And be mindful of the context when you bring it up -- in the context of gay rights, your personal likes and dislikes aren&#39;t what&#39;s at stake, so unless someone else is using the &quot;gay sex is gross so gay people are repugnant&quot; argument, there&#39;s no need to mention it; while if the conversation is about slash, you might want to explain why you haven&#39;t read any. )<br><br>*Mostly heard this one used by my ace/aro friends, some of whom describe themselves as sex-repulsed or romance-repulsed. <br>**I think this one is associated with and most recognisable within the BDSM community. <br><br>--Key has been the token allosexual friend and also likes words. </p>

She doesn&#39;t have to stay pregnant, whether she keeps the baby or not, because it&#39;s easy to get uterine replicators (or similar technology) from any of the sci-fi verses that the PPC regularly visits, and taking care of badfic babies is what the Nursery is there for. So she doesn&#39;t have to stop working if she doesn&#39;t want to, nor does she have to stay pregnant. Not saying this is trivial, but boy, I sure wish the Real World had debuggers and uterine replicators.</p>

            <p>She&#39;s not looking forward to the rumors that would start flying if/when people find out.

            <p>For one think, I&#39;ve read on the wiki that Eragon&#39;s a Canon Stu, so, maybe, if it deflects stuff like swords and arrows. It should probably deflect bows, too, but I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s going to try to kill him with one of those directly.</p>

            <p>I figured three months was probably enough. Though I may have miscounted, oh well. Anyway in the interim, we&#39;ve ended up with another PPC couple- Me and Delta Juliette are dating now. Don&#39;t ask me when that started, I&#39;m awful with dates. Also, I&#39;ve discovered a nugget that might be of interest to peeps, just deciding whether or not it needs its own thread. I may just make another post on this one to keep from bumping something else off the front page.<br><br>On a mildly related note, I was referred to <a href="http://sortinghatchats.tumblr.com/post/121904186113/the-basics">this</a> method of using Hogwarts Houses as personality indicators, and honestly I think it works better than the Meyers-Briggs test. For the curious, I am apparently burned Hufflepuff primary/Ravenclaw secondary. Which, when you read over the personality types, probably explains a lot about my behavior. Certainly goes a way to explain my worldview.</p>

            <p>As one person on Tumblr put it:<br><br>&quot;Dudes. People. This is still messed up if they’re messing with us. Like, really messed up.<br><br>&quot;We’re a pretty loyal fanbase. We’ve stuck with her through character assassinations in the movies, through the Epilogue that we seem to be pretty well divided on, through the weird Pottermore updates and post-Potter interviews (we all remember the surprisingly pro-Harmony interview). There’s no reason why we should be punished this harshly.<br><br>&quot;I don’t know if this is just the people I know, but spoilers are a no-go in the fandom. I remember how utterly pissed off people were about those posted pages for the last book. I wouldn’t have looked at the spoilers if I hadn’t heard from a good friend about how much the play sucked, and I’m sure there are a lot of other fans with me on that.<br><br>&quot;The script doesn’t come out for over a month. That is a freaking long time to prank someone. It wouldn’t be nearly as messed up if it was a week or something, but a month is a long time. (Let’s be real; it’s almost two months.)<br><br>&quot;I know people who are <b>selling their tickets because of this.</b> If it turns out to be a prank, think about how angry and betrayed you’d feel if you’d sold your tickets. And why? Because we’re supposed to believe that they’re all lying to us? What the hell?<br><br>&quot;I’ve had the play pre-ordered for a while, which I’m sure is the same for a lot of hardcore fans, but that doesn’t mean that everyone is as obsessive. I’d be pretty annoyed if I didn’t buy the book because of the spoilers and it turned out the be fake.<br><br>&quot;As much as I hate the spoilers and the plot as we’ve seen it, I think I’d feel worse if it turns out to be a massive joke.&quot;<br><br>I really, really hope it turns out to be a massive joke, but s/he does make some pretty good points. :( In the meantime, I&#39;ll just keep pinching myself and waiting to wake up from this nightmare where the eighth Potter &quot;book&quot; sounds like My Immortal 2.</p>

            <p>So the Daily Beast has leaked the entire story of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, and honestly it is hilariously bad. Like... they brought Snape back to life briefly, as well as bringing Umbridge back (why? both of those characters can rot in my opinion) Voldemort and Bellatrix had a daughter that was never mentioned before and Draco&#39;s son may have actually been fathered by Voldemort using a time turner (which is really gross because he&#39;s like 40 years older than Draco&#39;s wife). Rose, Ron and Hermione&#39;s daughter, is a complete jerk to Albus just because he gets sorted into Slytherin, which isn&#39;t exactly his fault. Albus openly advocates murdering Voldemort&#39;s daughter towards the end.<br><br>It&#39;s just... Really bad. You can read it for yourself <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/10/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-spoilers-here-s-the-plot-of-the-play.html">here</a> if you want.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a total of three or so people in the world who can make a decent story involving time travel, and I somehow doubt they were involved in this production. <br><br>I do find some joy in the irony of them destroying the canon that the fans were fans of in order to create fanservice for the fans who are now (very reasonably) upset because the canon has been ruined in their attempts to create fanservice. <br>It&#39;s a bit like improving the efficiency of your racehorse by breaking all of its legs and then strapping the creature to a large truck that&#39;s constantly driving in the opposite direction of the racetrack. </p>

            <p>This has to be a joke. There is no way that this can be serious. It&#39;s either some form of joke or a very clever conspiracy, because there&#39;s no way that something that makes me want to drown myself in Bleepfee without even getting through the entire thing can come from the same person who wrote the Harry Potter books. They&#39;re obviously pulling some kind of joke to shock everybody into not speculating and ruining the plot of the play. That must be it.</p>

            <p>Remember Pottermore? That lovely little website containing backstory and why X didn&#39;t do Y or what have you?<br><br><i>As our investigations currently stand, the longest period that may be relived without the possibility of serious harm to the traveller or to time itself is around five hours. We have been able to encase single Hour-Reversal Charms, which are unstable and benefit from containment, in small, enchanted hour-glasses that may be worn around a witch or wizard’s neck and revolved according to the number of hours the user wishes to relive.<br><br>All attempts to travel back further than a few hours have resulted in catastrophic harm to the witch or wizard involved. It was not realised for many years why time travellers over great distances never survived their journeys. All such experiments have been abandoned since 1899, when Eloise Mintumble became trapped, for a period of five days, in the year 1402. Now we understand that her body had aged five centuries in its return to the present and, irreparably damaged, she died in St Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries shortly after we managed to retrieve her. What is more, her five days in the distant past caused great disturbance to the life paths of all those she met, changing the course of their lives so dramatically that no fewer than twenty-five of their descendants vanished in the present, having been “un-born”.<br><br>Finally, there were alarming signs, during the days following Madam Mintumble’s recovery, that time itself had been disturbed by such a serious breach of its laws. Tuesday following her reappearance lasted two and a half full days, whereas Thursday shot by in the space of four hours. The Ministry of Magic had a great deal of trouble in covering this up and since that time, the most stringent laws and penalties have been placed around those studying time travel.</i><br><br>Claiming that it was a &quot;prototype&quot; Time-Turner that didn&#39;t have the five-hour limit is exactly the sort of thing a Suethor would claim. The fact that time was pretty much fine after Albus and Scorpius&#39; wild hijinks is exactly the sort of hand-waving a Sue would do. A girl claiming to be Voldemort&#39;s and Bellatrix&#39; daughter is exactly something a Sue would do.<br><br>Conclusion: Jack Thorne is a Suethor.<br><br>Because he&#39;s the one who actually <i>wrote</i> the play; JK Rowling helped him and considers it canon (!!!), but she wasn&#39;t the main writer.<br><br>All I can say, if she considers this canon:<br><br><img src="http://www.pagesz.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shark.jpg" alt="http://www.pagesz.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shark.jpg"> </p>

            <p>Fantastic Beasts is also the movie set in 1920s Harlem that includes no black or hispanic people on the cast, unless they&#39;re uncredited extras, but we haven&#39;t seen anyone who wasn&#39;t white in the background of any of the promotional material.<br><br>Not that it&#39;s JKR&#39;s fault as I doubt she had much to do with the casting, but it is pretty rediculous, considering that Harlem was/is one of the areas where white people are a significant minority.</p>

            <p>And by fluent, I mean having read Butcher&#39;s series up to the last main book, <i>Skin Game</i>. (The fic only dates back from 2009, with the 11th book, <i> Turn Coat</i>, published, so that much knowledge could work too, but paranoia.)<br><br>I found a <i>Dresden Files</i> crossover, and I would like to a mission ou of it, especially given the fact that the DF&#39;s canon get mucked up in the very first chapter. The main character is a OC, but he manages to get Harry OC with one phone conversation.<br><br>Oh, the other part of the crossover?<br><br>...<br>...<br>...<br><br>It&#39;s <i>Twilight</i>. Now, I read these things too (what was I thinking?), but I guess knowledge of these things would be needed too.<br><br>Anyways, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4998937/1/Blurred-Lines">here&#39;s the link to the story.</a> If a cowrite interest you, you can post it there, or mail me However, I&#39;ll warn you, it&#39;s not something I intend to do before quite a time, because I&#39;ve got many other things to do for now.<br><br>Now, if you read it, and think it wouldn&#39;t do for a good mission, feel free to tell it too.</p>

            <p>This world imply difficulty. Convincing someone that a series with great first person, a snarky and awesome main character and a cast just of the same quality around, said protagonist having to use his wits just as much, more in fact, as his powers to win the day, with many pop culture references ready to go in most circumstances, and an hint of pragmatism (the Head of Darth Wannabe when Dresden answered to his &#39;callenge&#39; by pointing his gun at him XD), great world-building, supernatural monsters who can still look like the traditional deal while many of them have got some changes rejunaveting the archetypes, a escalade in the crazy awesome through the series, and a credible one to boot, emotional moments varying for heart-melting to tear-fountain, with the funny also present and so many other things is worth reading isn&#39;t a challenge in any way I can think about. You&#39;re already a fan of the Dresden Files, only thing left is beginning to read them.<br><br>Now, the only weak spot I can think about is perhaps a slow start with the very first books, but they&#39;re still great read. Investigations won&#39;t be the main focus of the rest of the series though.</p>

            <p>So I haven&#39;t read past the synopsis and the disclaimer, but hooboy. If Meyerpires were an actual breed of vampires in the Dresdenverse, they would basically be bullied into non-existence by the other four courts, especially the Red and Black. At least Meyerwolves actually fit with one of the forms of werewolves in the Dresdenverse, so that&#39;s not a huge problem. This is gonna be a mess isn&#39;t it?</p>

            <p>I suppose Rose is just as valid as Jade, but why not go with Diamond? I mean isn&#39;t that what they&#39;re made of? I&#39;ll admit my knowledge of Twilight is limited to the movies because there were so many grammar and punctuation errors in the first book I couldn&#39;t make it past five pages, but they certainly looked like they were made of diamond or maybe marble when they were being killed off in the last movie.</p>

            <p>Since my non-Agents are currently not available and you have the book at hand, Agent Aviator, will you please hit Agent Dawn over the head, gently, and kindly remind her that Harry&#39;s name was put into the Goblet of Fire at the end of October, when the foreign students had arrived. <br><br>The badfic does not explicitly state that the accident is meant to happen in the first potions lesson, when the news of the Triwizard Tournament is still fresh, but it does say &quot;Chapter Three: 11 Weeks (November 1994)&quot; and &quot;Chapter Four: Fifteen Weeks (The First Task)&quot;. Make this early and late November, respectively, and an accident making everybody magically pregnant already three weeks in happening in early September fits the books timeline. Even if you move Chapter Three to late November and the First Task to mere days rather than weeks before the Yule Ball, Harry must still have been several weeks pregnant at Halloween.<br><br>The Snowdrop, Inofficial Head of Department, Uncanonical Department of Inaccuracies<br><hr>

I can&#39;t comprehend the directions some minds go.<br><br>The Snowdrop, of course, refers to “Even if Harry <i>had</i> put his name in the Goblet of Fire, it’s an unbreakable magical contract and he entered into it <i>before</i> the pregnancy.” <br><br>Thanks for making this possible.

            <p>Like, it&#39;s part of the type of fanfiction that&#39;s an exploration of how a character would act in different situations, and the author wants to explore how a male character would respond to the experience of being pregnant, but wants to keep it separate from thinking about how that character&#39;s life would have been different had they been born female. I mean, in reality I&#39;ve yet to find one good enough to justify that justification.
