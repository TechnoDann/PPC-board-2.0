            <p>There does exist a way to make it all equal the same thing I believe, but it is quite confusing. The basis of it is something like this. In the real world we all assume that the figure &#39;1&#39; equates to one unit of something. What happens if &#39;1&#39; doesn&#39;t equate to one unit of something anymore and instead equates to zero units of something. Now much like in the way we can have multiple things represent the same number of units (sqrt(4)=2=8/4) in our new way of measuring things we can also have different figures representing the same quantities. So, we have, in a new style of counting that the figure &#39;1&#39; equates to zero units, and we can also have that the figure &#39;0&#39; equates to zero units. Now for our problem here let us say that the figure &#39;2&#39; equates to two units, the figure &#39;-2&#39; equate to minus two units, the figure &#39;-1&#39; to equate to zero units and the figure &#39;0&#39; equate to zero units, thus your equation does indeed make sense as it states that zero units is equal to zero units is equal to zero units is equal to zero units. <br><br>OR the simpler answer is there is no answer, or rather not in the conventional way of counting things that we automatically use as human beings. But because we do not state that we are using any particular set of numbers at the start we can assume that the figures we are dealing with can equate to whatever we want.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br>Resident mathematician.<br><br>P.S I believe that, without sacrificing any of the beats that the current equations produce when being written down, it is possible to replace some of the figures with other figures such that you do get four equations that can all equal one another. The simplest way of doing it would be to replace the first 2 with an integral sign, which would then allow for x=-1 to work. </p>

            <p>and what information is given to you, what can be assumed etc. If you&#39;d told me I could only use certain sets (so say all real numbers (any number that doesn&#39;t involve sqrt(-1) or its multiples), or all integers (all whole numbers)) then the way I worked it out couldn&#39;t work as it&#39;d be restricted by a particular set of rules.

To me this means that things which out to seem small become large. To make it symmetrical, let&#39;s make the large small, too. Taking the reciprocal of everything might fulfill this, since it makes tiny fractions into huge numbers and visa versa. The main problem with that is that the original equation doesn&#39;t have any tiny fractions, so this won&#39;t be very dramatic/fun.<br><br>&quot;When there&#39;s hardly no day<br>Nor hardly no night<br>There&#39;s things half in shadow<br>And halfway in light&quot;<br><br>This implies to me that complex numbers ought to be involved. Definitely there&#39;s some ambiguity as to what is positive and what is negative. And complex numbers have that nicely; - 3 + 4 i, for example, is negative in the real direction and positive in the imaginary one.<br><br>But yeah, I also am way too busy at the moment to be doing this. After about three weeks I&#39;ll have plenty of time, though, so I can start it and you can join me later if it&#39;ll help you take your mind off of whatever&#39;s likely to be worrying you.

            <p>What is it with the <i><b>DI</b></i> and the IO? Hieronymus tried to wrap his mingled mind around the new story, while his body was still busy digesting all the hamantaschen. What, you don’t remember to have seen him at Purim? He was this quiet guy in red, white and blue pretending to be Panoramix. The growing potion had worked nicely on his hair and beard, and whitewashing them hadn’t been a big deal.<br><br>Remembering something, Hieronymus looked it up. Apparently, Matthew had transferred from the &quot;DoI&quot; (his Wiki page got this right) while the <i><b>DI</b></i> had been carried over from the permission request.<br><br>What the hoot is a <i><b>sitch</b></i>? A colloquialism Hieronymus doesn’t know? Usually, when something is misspelled he can guess what it’s meant to be, but here he is lost.<br><br>From there on, the story flew quite nicely, soothing Hieronymus’s aching head, until Ajax contemplated <i>the Hera of his world</i> and Hieronymus was jarred<i> as Ajax  <b>remember</b> that that depiction is not universal</i>.  Yeah, it still isn’t, but since Ajax acted in the past tense, he ought to have &quot;remembered&quot; that.<br><br>Hieronymus’s headache increased when he encountered an <i><b> infact</b></i> that &quot;in fact&quot; shouldn’t have infected anything. Also, Zeus would probably have &quot;done the deed&quot; rather than <i>done the <b>do</b></i>, and although he tried hard, Hieronymus didn’t quite understand what this sentence was meant to tell him, but he couldn’t decide whether he should blame this on bad wording or his own lack of canon knowledge.<br><br>After this, Ajax dropping the &quot;the&quot; in <i>Protectors <b>of Plot</b> Continuum</i> and capitalizing <i><b>Being</b></i>&gt;<sup>1</sup> when it’s clearly meant to be an adjective, couldn’t do much more harm, but then the continuity problems hit Hieronymus hard and a whole paragraph began to blur before his eyes when he tried to imagine what was going on.<br><br>Apparently, the plan had been that Matthew would kick the Stu into the reality room and Ajax would take care of Annabeth. But then, Matthew went through the portal with the Stu and watched him fade. <i>As Matt exited the <b>Reality Room from whence he came</b></i>, Hieronymus wondered whether this was meant to say that Matt, rather than leaving the Reality Room through its door to meet Ajax at Medical, went back through the portal to the badfic from where he had come, and whether putting some more words into it would have made this clearer. <br><br>On leaving the Reality Room, Matt <i> noticed that its walls had slash marks on its surface, indicating that <b>it</b>, at some point, something contained inside it had been trying to get out.</i> Hieronymus didn’t get the reference, but he noticed that either there was one superfluous &quot;it&quot; in it, or the phrases didn’t match at all. Meanwhile, Ajax had apparently just been standing there with Annabeth, doing nothing, so that Matt had to take care of her as well, neuralyzing her and making her walk through a portal. Hieronymus wondered whether this meant that Matt sent her to wherever she was supposed to be, skipping the intended medical treatment, or why he neuralyzed her before making her walk to Medical, where she would certainly be neuralyzed again after  the treatment. But at this point, he had mostly given up. <br><br>Well, the Post-Mission chapter confirmed that Annabeth had been taken to Medical. This might have helped Hieronymus recovering from the confusion, if Ajax hadn’t confused him again with what appears to be a comma splice. <i>He <b>entered, sitting</b> on the bed was a blue haired maiden who appeared about his own age.</i> (Is there any reason to not put a period behind &quot;He entered&quot;?) And then, just as Ajax left, there <i><b>was chair</b> in the corner</i> (&quot;a chair&quot;?)  and <i>Ajax sat in it,</i> although he had just let.     <br><br>Far in the back of Hieronymus’s mind, the idea that Ajax, before sitting down, might have realized that the chair was still there in the corner, &quot;just as he had left it&quot;, struggled to get attention. But it didn’t succeed before Hieronymus decided that this just wasn’t his day<sup>2</sup> and he should go to bed again. <br>  <br><hr>
<sup>1</sup>It’s the second &quot;Being&quot; in <i>... Percy Jackson and the Olympians canon: Being the child of Apollo and Athena via implied sexual intercourse, <b>Being</b> an Olympian, ...</i>; capitalizing after a colon is apparently correct. Also, the title <i>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</i> should probably be capitalized, but Hieronymus isn’t certain whether this applies in dialogue, and he really doesn’t feel like thinking about it right now.<br><br><sup>2</sup>There’s no sense in trying to cover this up. Despite all official denials, later that night, when the kids had been brought to bed, the Purim feast had turned into excessive drinking, at least for some of the participants, and Hieronymus got a massive hangover.<br><br><hr>
<br>I see what you are trying to do, giving the narrator a distinctive voice. I’m afraid you are not quite there yet; the asides and footnotes don’t feel as natural as they should. But I guess you are on a good way. At least you inspired me to write a ficlet, emulating the style, rather than just post a list of errors. So, reading and commenting this was lots of fun.<br><br>HG</p>

The Potter films scripts themselves had A LOT of scenes we have never seen on the screen. Some were modified, some deleted.<br><br>I am sure that the book version of the script is going to be the most faithful to what J.K. had written - after all, after she completed the script, it was the director who gave it its final shape.  </p>

            <p>Going into this tournament, all I was expecting to do was have some fun fighting with actual Pokemon in a friendly environment. To be honest I expected to be knocked out of the running after 1 or 2 rounds. So, onto my lineup.<br><br>First off was M-Gardevoir, who I dubbed Gothic Queen. I was going initial expecting to be the one who would wreck the most face. Sadly all she was really good for was throwing off a quick Focus Blast or Will &#39;o Wisp, though they still proved their worth.<br><br>Next was Azumarril, who I dubbed Ocean&#39;s Cure. As my only physical attacker, she was able to cut a nice whole in my opponets... If I was able to set her up that is.<br><br>Fairy Tail, ah yes Fairy Tail. My Togekiss was able to work her Serene Grace well (I do remember screams of Flinch-hacks from the audience). There were also excellent times when I was able to grab a few nasty plots to continue a solid sweep.<br><br>Forth off is Sylveon, who was dubbed Pixie Wolf. She played a swell support sub and occasional wall breaker. My favorite tactic was building up a calm mind and using her Baton Pass to switch into Clefable, who would proceed to reap the opposition.<br><br>For some reason My Keys became alive as a Pokemon called Klefki. I mainly used them to set up spikes and status effects with it&#39;s prankster ability, and let it suicide there. They were good for what they were being used for.<br><br>Rounding off my team was Clefable, of whom I lovingly dubbed Nanoha. She was excellent at making friends with who ever came her way, her Magic Guard ability shrugging off most status effects.<br><br>My sub was a whimsicot, named Afro, who I replaced with My Keys when facing ground teams, not that it mattered much. I find it stupid that I didn&#39;t give it a grass type move, for example grass knot, but y&#39; win some y&#39; lose some.<br><br>So, for those wondering who the hooded man facing them was, that was me, not wanting to be known as a fairy type man. Levy is already laughing at me as is.<br><br>~Ajax, DMS</p>

            <p>Holy halite-tipped arrowheads, this universe looks interesting. (90% of my Creative Curses will be about rocks. I don&#39;t regret a thing.) <br>As soon as I can find a library, I will be tearing into this book - I&#39;m unsure whether to be amused or terrified by the God of the Internet. I trust Neil Gaiman though; it seems fabulous! <br>....and it <i>is</i> available at the local library! I will probably have it done by Thursday.<br><br>-Vee</p>

            <p>Okay, I got this idea not long ago, but we will see if that can be fun.<br><br>There is music we&#39;ll associate with a character without question. Their own musical theme if they have them of course, but sometimes you will hear a music and think at the very moment, &#39;Eh, it&#39;s just perfect for Character!&#39;. So, why wouldn&#39;t we organize a little game about this.<br><br>I propose something similar to the Fanmix thread which already were posted here. We&#39;ll post musics, and people will name fandom characters they think to be represented by said music before posting their own soundtracks.<br><br>Any music, with or without lyrics, can be used. You can of course use fandom musics, but I think in this case it would be funnier to not name the actual characters linked to these musics. &#39;Credens Jusititia&#39; is of course Mami Tomoe&#39;s theme, but using her as an answer feels a bit lazy, right?<br><br>Without further ado, I&#39;ll open the bal with songs I discovered recently:<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCJdbCVuAO8">Rising Hope</a>, with an english dub from Leeandlie.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvaIgq5j2Q8">Angel with a Shotgun</a>, Nightcore version.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDklocLs8mU">Bring me to Life</a></p>

            <p>Cannot talk about the first, though. I read a character name in the comment section.

However, Onix isn&#39;t necessarily the &#39;mon to use them on. While STAB Earthquake is nice for burn spreading, Onix&#39;s Attack is hot trash and its low Speed means it won&#39;t be able to spread many of them. Additionally, there&#39;s a limit to how useful burn spreading even <i>is</i> for a physically defensive &#39;mon like Onix. The best thing to do would probably wait for it to evolve, but if you&#39;re determined to use it, try a Jolly one with EVs in HP and Speed and the ability Sturdy. Then, you&#39;ll want to give it the moves Earthquake, Rock Slide, Stealth Rock, and Explosion in the last slot - not a lot of people realize that the Ammolets affect moves like Explosion and Selfdestruct. Most importantly though, have fun. =]</p>

            <p>The closest is the Uranium Ammolet, which gives a chance to Poison rather than Badly Poison. There&#39;s also the Chaos Ammolet, which applies a 30% chance to Burn, Freeze, or Paralyze, and the Gold Ammolet, which doesn&#39;t apply a status effect but increases the damage boost to 50%. Now THAT is a powerful item, especially since you don&#39;t get the power drop from hitting multiple enemies in the Singles format. EarthSlide best slide. =] </p>

            <p>So here&#39;s something that&#39;s been bugging me: If Elves don&#39;t weigh enough to sink into powdery snow, how much do they weigh? And furthermore, how on earth do they <i>fight</i>? Anyone who managed to get a good grip on them could shake them around like a rag doll. <br><br>-Alleb, who is way too obsessed with details for her own good, and yet has probably overlooked some vital canon source that says Elves are just cool like that and weigh a normal amount when they aren&#39;t walking on snow</p>

            <p>1/ From an out-of-universe perspective, it&#39;s pretty clear that Legolas running over snow was an off-the-cuff addition, designed to make him more &#39;elvish&#39;. It&#39;s not reflected anywhere else in the Legendarium that I can think of. So Tolkien probably didn&#39;t think deeply about the details.<br><br>2/ From an in-universe perspective, July has the right of it: it&#39;s not lightness, it&#39;s nimbleness. We know Tolkien had a bit of a thing for tales of American Indians, with their bows and arrows - and their ability to walk through long grass without bending it (and to track by looking for bent grass, a la Aragorn). So Legolas is a super-Native - he&#39;s <i>so</i> nimble-footed that he doesn&#39;t even make a dent in <i>snow</i>!<br><br>2a/ Also, bear in mind it&#39;s not like Aragorn and Boromir <i>sank</i> as such. They deliberately carved out the avenues they did, through quite packed snow. If they tried to walk over it, they&#39;d probably be ankle-deep, and in danger of a wrong-foot plunging through a soft patch.<br><br>3/ The most fun answer: how much would he have to weigh?<br><br>Okay. Snowshoes let you walk on snow. A picture I found online shows a snowshoe with 4.5 x the area of a human foot. Since pressure = force x area, the force exerted by the foot must be reduced to 1/4.5 x the norm by the snowshoe.<br><br>Weight is a force. Therefore, to naturally walk like a human in snowshoes, Legolas must weigh roughly 1/4 as much as a human.<br><br>For a six-foot human, the ideal body weight is apparently  about 170 lb (~80 kg, or 12 stone). A six-foot Legolas would weigh a mere 40 pounds (20 kg, 3 stone). The ideal body weight of a child in kilograms is twice their age plus ten; working this backwards, <b>Legolas would weigh as much as a five-year old</b>.<br><br>Since I happen to have a five-year-old, I know that this means Aragorn could pick him up by one arm easily. For that matter, a <i>hobbit</i> could probably manage it. It also means he will never hurt himself by tripping over, unless he actually hits a rock - he&#39;s too light to bruise himself much.<br><br>He&#39;s not in danger of being picked up by the wind (okay, he&#39;s got a larger surface area for that mass, but even so), but... yeah, don&#39;t let a fighter get in range. Chucking a snowball at him would probably knock him over.<br><br>Oh, there&#39;s fic in this, for sure...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well, if you think July is right in-universe, then I suppose I shouldn&#39;t write all my fanfic with the fanon/assumption that Elves weigh practically nothing. But dangit, I&#39;m gonna write <i>some</i> of them like that! There needs to be some sort of downside to being an Elf.<br><br>Now I&#39;m imagining Feanor being drilled in the head by a snowball and sent <i>flying</i>.<br><br>Alternatively, with the proper use of a cloak and a stiff wind, Legolas might have an emergency exit from any situation. (And now I&#39;m imagining Gimli holding onto his ankle and flying him like a kite with a very short line. Elf-flying: The new official sport of Erebor.)<br><br>Actually, I didn&#39;t know Tolkien had a thing for Native American stories; that&#39;s quite interesting. I suppose I should have noticed the influence before. I wonder which ones in particular he fancied.<br><br>Thanks for figuring this out, hS!

            <p>You never know! <sup>_~<br><br>But</sup> we&#39;re running into the question of what Little Elves are Made Of. Did Iluvatar starts with a massive heap of snips, snails, puppy-dogs&#39; tails, sugar, spice, and everything else nice he could think of? Or did he (to take the other extreme) build them out of carbon nanofibre and titanium composites? (It&#39;s like birds. What <i>are</i> birds? We just don&#39;t know.)<br><br>We know that it&#39;s possible for an elf to catch fire and turn to dust after dying. We also know that it&#39;s possible for their bodies to stay undamaged for long periods of time after death. Neither of those were in normal circumstances, but the fact that they&#39;re immune to disease might indicate that they&#39;re generally unpalatable to bacteria.<br><br>The upshot of this is, there&#39;s absolutely nothing that says Elvish muscles have to work the same as human ones.

            <p>&quot;It&#39;s fine. You mob hate <i>Twilight</i> and its series. I get it. I really do. I know it&#39;s badly written, and I know it&#39;s melodramatic, but to me? That&#39;s the <i>point</i>. The <i>Twilight</i> Saga is a series of books about being a teenager in love written from the perspective of a teenager in love! Of course it&#39;s melodramatic! Of course it&#39;s hammy and overwrought and veers wildly between urple and beige prose! Of course <i>Eclipse</i>&#39;s treatment of Jacob stems largely from the author figuring out that leaving him as he stood was going to torpedo the OTP sooner or later! It&#39;s written in the style of a teenage girl who in real life is nowhere near as smart as she thinks she is, which is a hell of a lot of teenage girls! And even then, even if you can&#39;t get past all that, it&#39;s total fantasy. I don&#39;t see any of you giving this kind of treatment to the collective works of Mills And Boon, do I? No. Of course I don&#39;t. Because it&#39;s an easy target, regardless of how much people might actually unironically enjoy the series as a tale of genuine, innocent teenage love, told from that perspective. I want that. I lived through a story in which things happened all the time and that&#39;s why I like <i>Twilight</i> so much, I need a break, y&#39;know? I need a break from suffering and death, I need to go back to a time and place where romantic love wasn&#39;t a side-story but the main focus and all the quote-unquote interesting supernatural whatever was relegated to the background. I want a love story. I got it. So I&#39;ve got to ask, would it kill you to stop hating on my goddamned <i>primary fandom</i>? Please? Thanks a friggin&#39; bunch.&quot;</p>

            <p>I personally consider Tolkien Elves to just have hollow bones, like a bird&#39;s. That explains why they are so light. And who said that we couldn&#39;t shake elves around like a ragdoll? Elves simply just leap around, never getting into arm&#39;s reach while slashing like crazy with their light weapons. That&#39;s why we don&#39;t see elves with warhammers everyday.<br><br>At least, that&#39;s what I think. I&#39;ve never tried fighting an elf before, so I wouldn&#39;t know how easily they break. </p>

            <p>Unless--well, unless their swords were absurdly sharp, which they... were... Hm. Maybe that&#39;s why Elves are so good with weapon-forging: Their blades have to be <i>ridiculously</i> sharp, because they can&#39;t put enough force behind them to actually get through anything but butter. Alternatively, maybe Elvish armor is incredibly heavy, which weighs them down enough to keep them from being flung into the air by any Orc that comes their way and lets them put some more power behind their blows. <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>So, hi there guys. I&#39;m sorry for vanishing like that again. Things ended up pilling up and then the more I didn&#39;t check back here lead me to be less likely to check back due to missing so much already. But I missed you guys very much and thankfully EPL and Skarmory ended up contacting me so here I am! It feels good to be back! :)</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how to word this to convey my sincerity, and I still may not have gotten it right, but here it goes: I have been extremely disruptive to the community, and rude to several people, and none of you deserved that. I know I said I wouldn&#39;t take anything back, but that whole bringing up Jacer thing was seriously out of line, and I shouldn&#39;t have lashed out like that. I should have just stopped and accepted that I was already out of line. I&#39;m sorry for dragging up what must seem like ancient history with July to most of you. At one point I did genuinely believe that she was harmful to the community and needed to leave, but I&#39;m willing to accept that she has changed, and I vastly over reacted to a misperception. </p>

            <p>Since Data left (and apologized in a way I am ready to believe), I see no point in furthermore banning him, as I think that&#39;s the result we are going to reach.

            <p>So the main reason I voted ban was that Data had refused to apologise. That&#39;s changed now - they&#39;ve apologised, and they seem sincere.<br>Besides, they&#39;ve behaved themselves for the entire voting process.

            <p>From what I understand, board software only allows one IP ban at a time. Meaning the Nameless Admin could ban one of the exit IPs that she uses, but I&#39;m pretty sure she can easily switch to another one. Literally the only region of the PPC that can IP-block her is the IRC, because the Sorcery server blocks TOR connections.</p>

            <p>That unless there is a decision saying otherwise, July&#39;s vote should count, same as everybody (except the party under discussion — IIRC we didn&#39;t let dimensia or Rifle Calibre Guy weigh in). Until there is a decision, though, I&#39;ll count this as an abstention.</p>

            <p>—Just in time for Passover! Oh, well.<br><br>Yes, today is Passover Eve, or, as I&#39;ve always known it, Erev Pesach (which means the same thing. No, really, it does--the word Pesach, or Pesakh with the transliteration Des prefers, comes from the word pasach, which means...to pass over. The name comes from when the Israelites&#39; houses were passed over during the tenth plague in Egypt, just before the exodus from Egypt, which is what Jews are going to be celebrating starting tonight--freedom from slavery and the eventual formation of a nation.)<br><br>However, this RP is about a different holiday, one which you&#39;ve encountered through the past two years&#39; Purim RPs if you&#39;ve been here and felt like participating at the time. Normally, I&#39;ve been able to get it started while it&#39;s actually still Purim; this year, I...haven&#39;t. But it&#39;s here now, almost a month later, because, well, better late than never!<br><br>Purim is a pretty cool holiday, and could probably be termed a kids&#39; favorite without too much worry of inaccuracy. Traditions involve dressing up in costumes (which can be characters from the Purim story or anything else you can dream up--I went as my Plort self this year, while the winners of the costume contest at my synagogue were a girl dressed as a present and a man who&#39;d dressed up as <i>the phase of the moon on the day before Purim</i>), eating triangular cookies called <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.forward.com/images/cropped/breads-hamentaschen-new1-1458642835.jpg">hamantaschen</a> (meaning &#39;Haman&#39;s pockets&#39; in Yiddish; in Hebrew they&#39;re called oznei haman, Haman&#39;s ears, while we teach our children that he, that is the villain of the story, really had a triangular hat; who knows?), and drinking until you can&#39;t tell the villain of the story (Haman) from one of the heroes (Mordechai) (this is, of course, optional, and most definitely not required or encouraged for children). Actual commandments for the holiday include giving gifts to the poor, giving gifts of food and/or drink to friends, and hearing the Scroll of Esther (or Megillat Esther) read. There&#39;s also either a tradition or a commandment (it currently escapes me which one) to have a festive meal.<br><br>Speaking of hamantaschen, did you know they come in many, many, many different flavors? And  no, I don&#39;t just mean poppy seed, and chocolate, and jam; I mean pecan pie, and triple chocolate, and red velvet. And that&#39;s not even getting into taco hamantaschen and egg roll hamantaschen!<br><br>...no, I&#39;m not kidding. Here, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mlg263/36-mouthwatering-hamantaschen-to-make-this-purim-nvr5#.vtdpBPn306">have a Buzzfeed article</a>, which presents 36 different (and, for the most part, unusual) types of hamantaschen.<br><br>(Isn&#39;t this an RP? you ask. Why, yes! I&#39;m just getting to that.)<br><br>As you may remember from last year and the year before, the premise of the Purim RP is this:<br><br>Someone, somewhere in the PPC, is throwing a Purim party. Everyone is invited: costumes are preferred, hamantaschen and drinks and many other things will be served, someone will attempt to read the Megillah (that is, the account of the Purim story), and there will probably be a good deal of chaos. And fun. And chaos.<br><br><b>The Rules/guidelines are the same as the past two years:</b><br><br>-Everyone is welcome. That means new agents, old agents, reluctant agents, enthusiastic agents, agents who wandered in by mistake…everyone. It also means minis, kids, and possibly pets. Free-To-Use Agents are also good.<br><br>-This is newbie-inclusive! While I know some newbies (often depending on just how new they are) have agents they’re thinking about, many other newbies don’t–and, well, this is Purim. It’s a party. Everyone should be able to come! So…everyone includes Boarders, with the condition that you’re incognito! Pretend to be your costumes, pretend to be newly-recruited agents, whatever you like–as long as you remember that the vast majority of PPC HQ’s inhabitants don’t know the Board exists (and would forget if they found out). Of course, this isn’t just for newbies; if you’re not a newbie and you really, really want to, write yourself in! The same rules apply, though. <i>(This doesn&#39;t always happen, but you&#39;re certainly welcome to go for it--as I recall, there was only one instance of it in the first year, and a whole lot of it last year. Whatever you choose, it&#39;s certainly open!)</i><br><br>-On canon-compliance: this one is up to you. For my part, I take most of what my agents get up to in this RP as canon, to the point of working the occasional reference into various works in progress. Referencing relatively vague details that didn&#39;t make it to the RP but are headcanoned by the author(s) of the characters is probably also something I&#39;ll end up doing eventually--such as, &quot;Did you ever manage to get that song right?&quot; &quot;Which song?&quot; &quot;You know, the...the song. You heard it.&quot; &quot;Oh, yeah, no--I gave up on it around the point when someone dressed like a Dalek rolled into me and refused to apologize.&quot; &quot;Ouch.&quot; &quot;Yeah. Rolled over my toes on the way out...&quot; …Anyway, you can call this canon or not (or anything in between) for your agents as you wish! It’s entirely up to you.<br><br>-Have fun! It is Purim, after all, and Purim is a time for celebration. So let’s celebrate!<br><br><i>*Note: This Purim RP, while RL-wise taking place basically on Passover, is in-universe happening at the appropriate time. (Boarders inside the RP can mention time-travel if you like, though.)</i><br><br>Anyway, enough chitchat. Let’s have a party!<br><br>~DF<br><br>—<br><br>PS: Look out for a subthread which will pop up at some point! More on that later :)<br><br>—<br><br>PPS: If you want to take a look at the previous two opening posts, they are currently archived both <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VCMLEgpufQ5HZ42W6IzmY5z2BafXKhb99ZISXQb8Hvg/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> and on the Board Archives. Neither thread is currently available on the actual Board anymore, although, amusingly, the 2015 Purim RP was available as recently as March 31st of this year. And, on that note, thank you so much to everyone maintaining and contributing to the Board Archives! This post would be very different without you.<br><br>—<br><br>PPPS: <b>And so it begins!</b><br><br>“And then Queen Esther tells Achashverosh that it&#39;s <i>Haman!</i> who did all this, and he gets mad, and they take him away and I know something cool about how you sing it, because Aunty Em told me--”<br><br>Owain looked up blue eyes bright in his pudgy little face. “Singing?”<br><br>“Uh-huh! It goes all twisty or something.” Owain&#39;s older sister Ruby plopped down onto a beanbag chair. Her dark hair, in two braids, swung with the motion. She tugged at the strings of the bonnet that hung down her back, pulling the knot away from her neck. “Because it&#39;s very dramatic, and Charvona&#39;s a hero, so he gets the heroic music!”<br><br>“Oh,” said Owain. “But he isn&#39;t the hero, he&#39;s…”<br><br>“He is,” Ruby insisted with a five-year-old’s conviction. “He tells King Achashverosh that Haman wanted to hurt Mordechai.”<br><br>“No,” four-year-old Owain insisted, “Esther did that! I&#39;m not <i>stupid</i>.”<br><br>“He did <i>so</i>,” Ruby said. “Ask Mama. She&#39;ll tell you I&#39;m right, and then you&#39;ll see.”<br><br>Owain opened his mouth, but didn&#39;t manage more than a word before Seren, the third Sato sibling, ran up to them. “Ruby, did you see my pink hat? “<br><br>“You don&#39;t <i>need</i> a pink hat,” Owain protested. “K-9 doesn&#39;t wear any kind of hat!”<br><br>Seren crossed her arms and glared at her brother. “Well, I do! So too bad. Where&#39;s my hat?”<br><br>Owain shrugged both shoulders. “<i>I</i> dunno. Maybe Leyuu ate it!”<br><br>“Leyuu doesn&#39;t <i>eat hats</i>,” Ruby said derisively. “<i>No one</i> eats hats.”<br><br>“Maybe some people do!” Owain&#39;s chin jutted outwards. “I bet you dragons do!”<br><br>“<i>No one</i> eats <i>hats</i>,” Ruby repeated. “Eating hats is <i>gross</i>.”<br><br>“Is not!”<br><br>Seren stomped her foot. “<i>Where’s my hat?</i>”<br><br>At that point, Miss MacKinnon came over. “Come, children,” she said, “we’re going to the party now. Seren, I believe you’re missing your hat?” She held it out.<br><br>“My hat!” Seren snatched it, and then hugged Miss MacKinnon tightly around the waist. “Where was it?”<br><br>“It fell behind one of the chairs,” the Nursery worker replied. “Come, we need to go--Owain, aren’t you missing a hat as well?”<br><br>“Nuh-uh!” Owain shook his head vigorously. “I’m not Captain Jack Sparrow, I’m just a pirate! He walks funny.”<br><br>“So he does.” Miss MacKinnon turned, guiding the three towards the door as she began to walk. “I think we’re ready. Ruby, do you have everything?”<br><br>“Uh-huh!” Ruby grinned, skipping along next to the others. “And it’s going to be <i>amazing!</i>”<br><br>—<br><br>((Leyuu is mentioned due to them <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LYkSFHSyjomALEcK8re0sj_1Z-JWiQ45wWMpTl8AFmE/edit?usp=sharing">knowing him Ten Years Hence</a>. He is written by Voyd. Miss MacKinnon is both pretty cool and a Free To Use character rescued from a badfic by doctorlit. Her character here is based on her rescue by doctorlit and her appearance in a <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999/06.end.html">mission conclusion</a> by Neshomeh.))</p>

            <p>&quot;Alleb,&quot; Jesse said plaintively, for the fifth time. &quot;I look <i>ridiculous.</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, you do not,&quot; Alleb said, not even bothering to turn to look at him as they walked down the grey corridors. &quot;A moonrascal is a perfectly acceptable costume.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Doesn&#39;t feel acceptable,&quot; the cowboy grumbled, swiping at the quills that kept brushing his neck. &quot;How come you get to be the whatzit?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Whoosel,&quot; Alleb corrected. She spun the end of her long red tail, which she had to hold to keep from brushing the ground. <br><br>&quot;Whoosel,&quot; Jesse repeated, resigned to the fact that Alleb would always be able to pull more weird words and facts out of her head, just when he thought she had expelled them all. &quot;Why do you get to be the whoosel?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because I asked you, and you said you wanted to be the moonrascal.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t remember that!&quot;<br><br>&quot;You were drunk. It is not my fault that you cannot control your urge to excel your limits.&quot;<br><br>Jesse spluttered. &quot;I don&#39;t have an urge to--to do whatever you just said!&quot; He planted his fists on his hips, then immediately yelped as he was pricked by the innumerable quills the eccentric swordmaiden had sewn onto his coat. &quot;I want to leave already,&quot; he grumbled. <br><br>Alleb, who still hadn&#39;t turned to face him, held up a finger. &quot;There will be copious amounts of alcohol,&quot; she said, a knowing smile on her face, though Jesse couldn&#39;t see it.<br><br>Jesse paused in the hallways, watching Alleb walk forward without stopping, then cursed under his breath and walked faster to catch up. &quot;Women shouldn&#39;t be clever <i>and</i> women,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;That&#39;s at least two more advantages than us men have.&quot;<br><br>Alleb smirked. &quot;How could women be clever but not be women?&quot; she asked lightly. &quot;That seems rather contradictory.&quot;<br><br>&quot;With <i>skill</i>,&quot; Jesse said cantankerously, knowing he didn&#39;t make any sense but refusing to accept defeat.<br><br>Alleb chuckled. Then, suddenly, she swerved left. &quot;Here we are, at last!&quot; she said exuberantly. Jesse sighed, but she paid him no mind. &quot;Come!&quot; she said, hurrying through the door and into the low hum of conversation. The smell of food was drawing her--she was, after all, a teenager--and she hadn&#39;t had a decent conversation with anyone but Jesse in what felt like days. <br><br>&quot;Yay,&quot; Jesse said, in a flat, unhappy voice.<br><br>And so the two entered the party: Alleb dressed as something like a red fox, complete with painted whiskers, and Jesse looking like a sour porcupine. It was going to be an interesting time.<br><br>((Woot woot, RPs! Love RPs. Thanks for putting this on, Dawn! Anyone who wants to, feel free to throw your agents at mine and see what happens! Also, random note, Agent Alleb and I are not the same age.))<br><br>((-Alleb))</p>

In the other hand she had one of the triangular cookies.<br><br>&quot;Here.&quot; She presented the tray to Hardric and nibbled on the treat she was holding.</i></i></p>

            <p>Hop grabbed a handful of cookies, and started munching on them in silence.<br><br>&quot;Well, I&#39;m a Seeker,&quot; said Hip. &quot;And my homeworld is called <i>Huntik</i>. It&#39;s...um... I&#39;m not sure how to describe it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ishh life Hind—&quot; Hop swallowed and wiped her mouth. &quot;Sorry. What I meant to say was, it&#39;s like if Indiana Jones travelled the world an&#39; was searchin&#39; fer Pokemon.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey!&quot; Hip gave her partner a stare.

A <a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/huntik/images/b/bb/Freelancer_Amulet.jpg/revision/20130715122834">medallion</a> of some sort.<br><br>&quot;These amulets are keys to summon beings from another dimension called Titans,&quot; she said. &quot;If a Seeker bonds with a Titan, they can call upon them to fight together.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s pretty neat to look at,&quot; added Hop.</p>

            <p>Finch and Bingle were different in many ways, but today they were both united in their mutual pride in their outfits. <br><br>Finch was dressed as an old 21st century vending machine. This wasn’t a particularly glorious achievement, because Finch was essentially disguising himself as one of his grandparents. <br>He was a little thicker than most vending machines, the outlines of his four currently docked arms were conspicuous on his front and sides, and a very visible hole had been cut around the front of the costume to allow his single ocular to see, but, otherwise, he was a perfectly average hovering vending machine. <br><br>Bingle was dressed as a Man In Black. <br>This wasn’t a particularly glorious achievement, because Bingle was technically already one. He had a tall, sharp frame, dead pasty skin that was cold to the touch, grey, stringy hair retreating from the centre of his bald head, and a wooden nose. <br>He hung around that confusing area between alive and dead, and did it with the flippant carelessness of either a professional, or somebody too stupid to care. <br>He was very fond of the sunglasses, and found himself wishing that he could find more excuses to wear the things indoors. <br><br>‘<b>Which one was Esther, then?</b>’ Finch asked, in a soulless, steel voice that was unsuited to, among other things, discussing family holidays. <br><br>Bingle considered this, stroking his chin. <br>‘I believe she rescued the Israelites from the Egyptians.’ <br><br>Finch shook his ocular in disapproval. Even the whirring its servomotors released had an air of disappointment to it. <br><br>‘<b>That was Moses.</b>’ <br><br>‘Oh, drat. I knew that. She was the one who wandered in the desert for forty years,’ Bingle, taking his hand from his chin and nodding, certain that he was correct. <br><br>‘<b>That was Moses, too.</b>’ <br><br>‘Oh, dear. I knew that. She was an Egyptian prince, born of a Jewish mother.’ <br><br>‘<b>What? That was Moses, too, you nob.</b>’ <br><br>Bingle was getting desperate, now. ‘Did she cross the Red Sea?’ <br><br>‘<b>You-ve ruined this holiday, Bingle.</b>’ <br><br>‘Was that Moses, too?’ <br><br>‘<b>That was Moses, too,</b>’ Finch confirmed. <br><br>‘Good heavens. Awfully talented, wasn’t he?’ <br><br>‘<b>They had to be,</b>’ Finch agreed, recalling all he had learnt of old earth history. It must have taken the Israelites some tenacity to fend off against the wild dinosaurs that roamed Europe in those days. <br><br>Ambient noises crawled in from the distance as they travelled along the hallway. Talking, laughing, shouting, dropping food and scooting away in an attempt to not come off as suspicious. <br><br>‘Are you calculating our deaths again, Finch?’ Bingle asked, picking up the increased whirring of Finch’s fans, as they desperately cooled his warming brainchip. <br><br>‘<b>How many agents-ll be there, do you think?</b>’ Finch said, fans continuing to pick up in speed. <br><br>‘This terror you have for agents is absurd, Finch,’ Bingle said, messy eyebrow rising. <br><br>‘<b>All of my bloody terrors are absurd,</b>’ Finch mumbled bitterly. <br><br>‘Can you imagine the trouble they’d find themselves in if they even touched us, Finch? The Flowers would positively shred them to pieces! Negatively!’ Bingle thought about his wording. ‘Positively!’ <br><br>‘<b>Just because it-s not meant to happen doesn-t mean it won-t,</b>’ Finch argued. ‘<b>The ceiling wasn-t meant to fall in, and look what happened to Castor!</b>’ <br><br>‘What happened to Castor was nothing more than an unfortunate accident,’ Bingle said, sniffing, a very hollow and windy sound through his wooden nose. <br><br>‘<b>An unfortunate accident that <i>happened</i>. It happened, and now look at them. They-re dead!</b>’ <br><br>‘They are not dead.’ <br><br>‘<b>Looked bloody dead to me.</b>’ <br><br>‘Oh,’ Bingle said, shrugging. ‘They’ve had worse in medical.’ <br><br>‘<b>Their head was pushed right into their chest,</b>’ Finch said, glancing at Bingle with slight suspicion. <br><br>‘They’ll be up in less than three weeks.’ <br><br>‘<b>Unless the ceiling falls on them again.</b>’ <br><br>Bingle sighed. ‘Finch, there is no chance that the ceiling will fall on us.’ <br><br>‘<b>That-s not my problem!</b>&#39; <br><br>‘Then why do you keep whining about it?!’ Bingle asked, stunned. <br><br>‘<b>My problem is with the agents!</b>’ <br><br>‘The agents are just as likely to harm you as the ceiling is to fall on you.’ <br><br>‘<b>That-s my problem!</b>’ <br><br>‘The ceiling won’t fall on you.’ <br><br>‘<b>It bloody fell on Castor!</b>’ <br><br>‘I am willing to wager-‘ <br><br>‘<b>Thirty dollars,</b>’ Finch growled, now facing Bingle. <br><br>‘Forty.’ <br><br>‘<b>And fifty cents.</b>’ <br><br>‘Seventy-five cents.’ <br><br>Finch’s ocular narrowed. <br>‘<b>Seventy</b>.’ <br><br>‘Is that a deal, then?’ <br><br>‘<b>If a single agent does anything that might be dangerous to me,</b>’ <br><br>‘I will pay you forty dollars and seventy-five cents.’ <br><br>‘<b>Seventy cents,</b>’ Finch hissed. <br><br>‘Seventy cents,’ Bingle agreed. ‘The party awaits,’ He said, grinning and hastening his step. <br><br>‘<b>So do our deaths,</b>’ Finch mumbled, following. <br><br>‘And my payment!’ <br><br>‘<b>My payment.</b>’ <br><br>‘Forty dollars and seventy-five cents!’ <br><br>‘<b>Seventy.</b>’ <br><br><br><br>- So these are the fellows I&#39;ve been working on for a while. Des told me I ought to bounce them around here, or something like that, so bouncing they are. I hope there&#39;re no expensive vases in here. <br>Suppose this is a perfect chance for you folks to tell me they&#39;re rubbish, then, too. So go ahead. Assuming they are rubbish. <br>I certainly hope they&#39;re not. <br><br><br><br>*Did I say seventy-five? I meant seventy. </p>

            <p>&quot;Where do you think those two came from?&quot; he asked. He had somehow managed to get a pouch of kibi-dango and traditional samurai-ish clothes, and jumped at the chance to dress up as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momotar%C5%8D">Momotaro</a>. <br><br>&quot;Your guess is as good as mine,&quot; said Violet. Chris had convinced each of the other three to dress as one of Momotaro&#39;s animal companions. Violet, as the pheasant, had on entirely too much red face paint, a shimmery blue and purple dress with a long train, and a green collar. &quot;I think they might be from an original canon; I&#39;ve never seen a zombie with male pattern baldness and a wooden nose before.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I still say you should&#39;ve let me go as Bond,&quot; Miguel grumbled.

But hey, at least now I already have this year&#39;s Halloween costume in the bag.&quot; Miguel grinned.<br><br>The four moved farther into the room. &quot;Hey, vending-machine guy!&quot; Violet called. &quot;Finch, right? Awesome job on that outfit. I think you just won the costume contest.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;According to the version Chris told us, an old couple found a giant peach floating down the river near their house. When they cut it open to eat it, they found a baby inside. Clearly he&#39;d been sent from heaven, so the old couple gave him the name Momotaro, which means &#39;Peach Boy&#39;.&quot;<br><br>&quot;As an adult, Momotaro set out to defeat a band of demons on Onigashima,&quot; Chris continued. &quot;He convinced a talking dog, a monkey, and a pheasant&quot;--he pointed at Ami, Miguel, and Violet in turn--&quot;to help him out, and together they forced the demons to surrender. They came back with all the treasure the demons had stolen, plus the leader as a captive.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I just realized something,&quot; said Miguel. &quot;Momotaro was totally the first Pokemon trainer.&quot;<br><br>Chris did a double take. &quot;You know, I never thought of that...Anyway, allow me to properly introduce myself. I&#39;m Chris, and my friends are Ami, Miguel, and Violet.

            <p>He was fond of folklore of all kinds, from the Irish people going on about small men, to tinfoil hat wearing Bigfoot theorists going on about the government, and he took in the story with the focus of a man who was totally certain that it wouldn’t be lost in the spinning tornado that was his brain. <br><br>Finch, too, was enraptured, mainly because of the dog telling it.<br>Her mouthparts were clearly not designed for speaking English, leaving them to clumsily flap open and close, and causing her thick tongue to roll and loll all about. The human looked slightly less silly, but it only went so far. <br>Fleshy types always looked silly, flopping and jittering all over the place. <br><br>‘Bernhard Bingard Bingle. It’s a pleasure to meet you.’ <br><br>‘<b>I-m S86FNC-11630.</b>’ <br><br>‘Building,’ <br><br>‘<b>Building maintenance,</b>’ <br><br>‘Maintenance, building maintenance,’ Bingle concluded. <br><br>‘<b>Building maintenance,</b>’ Finch agreed. <br><br>Finch looked sideways at Bingle ‘<b>French myth?</b>’<br><br>‘Oh, anyone could have made that mistake.’ <br><br>‘<b>Do they even have peaches in France?</b>’ <br><br>Finch and Bingle both paused and thought. This was a question, they both agreed, that required serious consideration. <br><br>‘I don’t think their peaches have babies in them, either way.’ <br><br>‘<b>I hope not. You can only put a knife near a baby so many times before something goes wrong.</b>’ <br><br>Bingle was stunned by Violet’s question. <br>He had been, indeed, looking at her wings, all the while having a miniature war within him on the implied racism they created. <br>It was his hubris that had brought him down, he knew. <br>The sunglasses made him feel invincible – he felt like he could have looked at anything, and nobody would have known. <br>But she did. <br>Bingle should have realised sooner. She flew – of course she had good eyesight! <br>How else did birds spot worms all the way on the ground? <br>Not that Bingle thought that she ate worms, of course, that would have been terribly rude of him. <br><br>‘Oh, looking? At you? Like that?’ He said, tilting his head. <br>‘Was I, Finch?’ <br><br>‘<b>Buggered if I know. You-ve sunglasses on.</b>’ <br><br>‘No offense was intended, of course,’ Bingle said, attempting to extend his grin. ‘Your wings are very, er, impressive. Fabulous job on the upkeep. Very smooth. Smooth feathers.’ <br><br>‘<b>Lovely wings,</b>’ Finch agreed, catching Bingle’s drift. <br>‘<b>Very pleasant arcing,</b>’ He said, undocking one of his serving arms, and drawing the arc of one of her wings in the air. <br><br>‘Is this objectification?’ Bingle whispered. ‘Are we objectifying her?’ <br><br>‘<b>Ahem!</b>’ Finch hissed, hitting Bingle in the stomach with his free arm. ‘<b>So, Purim, right? What a bloody nice holiday it is to not get into a fight, isn-t it?</b>’ Finch hit Bingle in the stomach again. <br><br>‘I am very excited to eat Haman’s wings,’ Bingle exclaimed, earning another hit. ‘Pockets, I meant pockets.’ <br></p>

            <p>(She was far too polite to say anything about Bingle&#39;s teeth.) &quot;My canon hasn&#39;t talked about the school too much, but what&#39;s known is that at some point before the series started, Princess Celestia--the supreme ruler of Equestria--started an exclusive school in Canterlot for gifted unicorns.&quot; She focused briefly, and the dog illusion vanished. Then her horn lit up, and the exam&#39;s entrance hall, complete with filly Twilight and her family, materialized in front of her. Illusion!Twilight tried to cast a spell on the egg in front of her, with no success. &quot;This is their entrance exam; magically hatching a dragon&#39;s egg,&quot; she narrated. &quot;I don&#39;t know how anypony else did it, but in Twilight&#39;s case, a legendary sonic rainboom caused her magic to go haywire, and Princess Celestia herself accepted Twilight as a student after things had died down. Pretty impressive, huh? I sometimes wonder whether I would have been eligible if I had a cohesive backstory...&quot; In the background, filly Twilight did a happy dance, and baby Spike sucked on his tail.<br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t know you could talk that much,&quot; said Violet, looking slightly dazed.<br><br>Ami dispelled the illusion, but didn&#39;t put her dog disguise back on. &quot;The School would be an important part of pony history even if Princess Twilight <i>hadn&#39;t</i> gone,&quot; she said. &quot;Of course I have a lot to say about it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fair point,&quot; said Chris, arriving with a handful of hamantaschen. &quot;What&#39;d I miss?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ami infodumping,&quot; Miguel joked, taking a cookie from Chris&#39; hands. &quot;Also, Bingle says he&#39;s a sorcerer, and his university invented golems.&quot;<br><br>Ami pawed at the ground sheepishly. &quot;Uh...if it&#39;s not too much trouble, can I see how your kind of magic works?&quot; she asked Bingle.</p>

The University’s been working on that for decades!’ <br>It was clear that this ‘Friendship is Magic’ place was years ahead of Bingle’s home. Now he knew how World One fellows felt when they encountered Finch. <br>Bingle didn’t even want to know what a unicorn horn was made of to perform such a complex, strenuous task without <i>any</i> breakages, reality or structural. <br><br>‘Right. I need,’ He muttered to himself, patting his pockets down. <br>‘Of course, pen,’ He mumbled, pulling one from his front pocket (he had put it there for that business-like look it gave him. To Bingle, it said ‘I’m ready to sign my signature, come rain or shine,’ and there was nothing more professional, Bingle knew, than signing signatures.)<br><br>‘Of course, our channel,’ He said, grabbing a nearby serviette. <br><br>‘Er. A ruler.’ <br>He glanced around, grabbed a particularly rigid looking hamantaschen, and raised an eyebrow. <br>‘Or a straight object, I suppose.’ <br><br>He slapped the tools down on a table, and wracked his brain for information. <br>Lines and angles ran through his skull, as he nibbled on a corner of the hamantaschen. <br><br>‘Right, okay,’ He murmured, getting to work. He would occasionally shoot a glance at Finch, who was, currently, it seemed, in a very deep and harsh debate with his own emergency malfunction ai. <br><br>This would be a fairly simple one. A ten by seven centimetre rectangle inside of a four by four centimetre square. <br>Easy. <br><br>Realistically, drawing a rectangle and a square would have taken eight strokes of a pen combined, which was exactly why things started to get strange when Bingle finally put his pen down at the nineteenth stroke. <br><br>He held it up and admired his handiwork. <br>Bingle gazed into the universe, and the universe gazed into him. <br>Rumbling moans and coughs crawled into his ears through seams in existence. <br>Sightless and brainless gelatinous monstrosities, swimming and devouring and groaning through the eternal nothingness regarded him with apathetic pseudopods. <br>For a split second, everything was dead. <br>The walls had crumbled into nothingness, flesh gave way to bones which gave way to dust, the Flowers wilted away into air. <br>Reality gave up and let entropy devour it. <br>It only took nineteen strokes to create such damage in existence. <br>Bingle wondered how much damage the aeons could create, then. <br>Even Bingle himself, who was immune to the ever tenacious rubber mallet of time that thwacked away at mortals until they gave in, would fall. Trip over a rock and brain himself, catch fire somewhere, get eaten by a tiger. <br>There would be nothing left but emptiness and moaning. <br><br>Bingle blinked, grinned, and ate the hamantaschen. <br>Mister Grandcocke would have given him an A+ for this one, he thought, chewing. <br><br>‘Here it is,’ He said cheerfully, extending it towards Violet, who seemed the most fascinated by it. <br>‘You might see something queer, but don’t dwell on it. It’s nothing.’ <br>He leaned in. <br>‘The best way to go mad is to dwell on nothing, after all.’ <br>Bingle’s smile was almost disgusting in its sincerity. <br><br>[[OOC: Oi, cheers. That means a lot. <br>Honestly, I&#39;d probably react the same way. Dogs don&#39;t normally turn into unicorns where I&#39;m from, but maybe I&#39;m just narrow-minded.]]</p>

            <p>Bingle said, apologising for the twin terrors of unholy horrors and unsuitable hygiene. <br><br>‘Horrid things back there,’ He continued, referencing both the eldritch monstrosities, and the calcium build-ups that dawdled behind his lips. <br><br>‘<b>I think I-ve it fixed, now,</b>’ Finch grumbled, hovering over. <br>There were a few cans and packets of lollies in his costume that had fallen and crumpled, but Finch had recovered successfully, otherwise. <br><br>‘<i>There seems to be a grade B firmware intrusion, would you like-</i>‘ <br>Electricity hissed as the voice was cut off. <br><br>‘<b>Bloody right, grade B.

Guarding kings and nobles,’ <br><br>‘<b>Dentists.</b>’<br><br>‘Pardon?’ <br><br>‘<b>Did I say anything?</b>’ <br><br>Bingle shot a fast glare towards Finch before continuing. <br>‘They had existed for a while, having been invented somewhere about the Middle-East. Awful expensive, though. Old ones were made of metals, to be bend- malleable, but the new, hollowed ones could just be made cheaply out of stone. Less body to break, and all.’ Bingle paused, thinking. <br><br>‘<b>They do jobs the humans won-t take. Dying, for instance.</b>’ <br><br>‘I’ve seen a few mining, dying, doing construction work, carrying,’ Bingle’s knowledge train was beginning to slow down. ‘Bricks? I suppose they’d do that.’ <br><br>‘<b>What about the big bloody grey lumps that stomp down the streets then, kicking hobos and glaring at people?</b>’ <br><br>‘Oh, yes, those. Golem street guards. Store guards. Escorts. Er.’ <br><br>‘<b>Golem birds.</b>’ <br><br>‘Ah, yes. Very, er. Decorative. Brass, and all. They fly.’ <br><br>‘<b>They crash, too.</b>’ <br><br>‘They do that, too.’ <br><br>‘<b>Where-re you from, then?</b>’ Finch asked, looking at Miguel. <br><br>‘They tweet, also,’ Bingle murmured. Finch ignored him. <br><br>[[I was very proud of that one, I must say. <br>I&#39;ll just place it down here and turn around and whistle loudly, hoping that nobody takes it. Not in this society, no way.]]</p>

He glanced down every entryway and open door they passed, eyes wide and one hand keeping his hair away from his eyes.<br><br>&quot;Absolutely!  I mean, why not?&quot;  Laquisha was moving forward with a marching stride, keeping pace with MacKinnon up ahead without letting the Nursery worker realize she was being followed.  &quot;It&#39;s a <i>party</i>!

They just have crappy jobs.  But they&#39;re totally cool!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, no worries,&quot; spoke up Marty.  He was keeping up with Laquisha, despite going at a more leisurely pace, and took in his surroundings with an easy air.  &quot;It&#39;ll be cool to meet some agents.&quot;<br><br>Fox, who had pressed against the wall as the mini passed, gave a burst of speed to catch up to his companions.  &quot;It&#39;s just, we weren&#39;t invited, and we aren&#39;t really supposed to wander outside the Nursery alone, and—&quot;<br><br>&quot;Chill.&quot;  Marty half-turned and laid a hand on Fox&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;We&#39;re all right.&quot;<br><br>Fox shook himself slightly.  &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay, you guys,&quot; said Laquisha.  &quot;MacKinnon just went inside.

            <p>The Time Lord hesitated. Flat-out admitting that he was part of one of DIA never really worked out for him. Agents tended to shy away when they learnt that he was part of a Security Department; the spectre of DIS always hovered over any in-HQ security force. But then again, he felt that the little girl at his side wouldn&#39;t let it go until he gave her an honest answer. Furthermore, he was part of Special Response-- not really your average Internal Affairs officer, right?<br><br>&quot;Well, &#39;mission&#39; might be overstating it a little,&quot; he said carefully. &quot;It&#39;s more of a call from DIA despatch. My partners and I usually lend a hand to agents who might&#39;ve gotten themselves in a jam during one of their missions. It&#39;s a pretty okay job, actually. Someone needs to guard the guards, right?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Will there be food?&quot; asked the Guardsman. &quot;If so, sign me up.

We&#39;re the search-and-rescue part of DIA, so we make sure we bring them back safe and sound. We&#39;re also sometimes dealing with stuff around HQ too but... well, not that often.&quot; </p>

            <p>The speaker was a man of indeterminate age, slightly stooped. He wore a long black monk&#39;s habit, coupled with a cowl that was decorated with crow feathers. The cowl&#39;s hood was pulled up, keeping much of his face in shadow, but there was no hiding the man&#39;s goatee; it was short, pointed and messy, mostly light-brown in colour but with ginger and blonde patches. &quot;The story begins thus,&quot; said the man, clasping his hands near his chest. &quot;In the days of yore, King Akhashverosh of Persia, also named Xerxes&quot; — he pronounced the name &#39;Ksar-kses&#39; — &quot;by the Greeks, had thrown a banquet. Why? He was bored, maybe. Who knows.&quot; The man waved a hand and turned his head to look at his audience. &quot;With me so far?&quot;</p>

            <p>The man sounded confused. &quot;The king was hale and hearty. He had the <i>queen</i> poisoned. Or so I&#39;ve read the Megillah, anyway.&quot; He cleared his throat, peering at Ajax and Levy from beneath his hood. &quot;Story goes on: after a while, Mr King calms down and remembers that, oopsy, he has no queen now. So, after talking to his advisers, he rounds up any good-looking virgin in the kingdom.&quot; He smiled. &quot;Fun, no? That&#39;s where the Jews come into the story. There was a Jewish man in the kingdom: Mordekhai son of Yair. He was taking care of his niece, Hadassah (also named Esther), since her parents were dead. So she gets rounded up with the rest of the virgins. Fast forward a few months, the king decides he likes her and makes her his new queen.&quot;<br>The man sighed. &quot;Anybody know where the confectioneries are? And the water. Thirsty work, storytelling.&quot; He peered closely at his small audience. &quot;Hmm?&quot;</p>

Now, everybody who sits before the gate of the palace does so, except for Mordekhai.&quot; A pause. &quot;After this goes on for a while, Haman gets really pissed off and, learning that Mordekhai is a Jew, decides to Kill All Jews.&quot; He tugged at his goatee and looked at his audience.</p>

            <p>To those who didn&#39;t know, yes we have one. <br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ve noticed that, since I joined the group (whenever that was) we&#39;ve never really done anything with it, and I&#39;d like to change that. <br><br>Whilst browsing through games owned by multiple members of the group I noticed several people have Civilization V, and was wondering if, in perhaps about a months time, anyone would be interested in getting together and launching a game on it. <br><br>I think, first of all it shouldn&#39;t just be open to people who are on the board now, and that anybody in the group can join in the fun, secondly saying about starting it in a months time would hopefully give us enough time to prepare it all and get those pesky exams etc. if not totally out of the way, at least partially. Oh and I think it should probably go without saying but using the Hotseat game mode would make the most sense then we don&#39;t have to all be on at the same time to play.<br><br>So what do people think? What else would people like to do? <br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>I do think there can be an inherent bias towards inaction when you lump votes of abstention in the &quot;do nothing&quot; camp. Simply put, the Boarders in question are making it clear that they do not <i>want</i> to vote on the issue, and as such I support Phobos&#39; decision to have them removed from the pool entirely.</p>

            <p>So, there&#39;s a few things that we probably should decide on when it comes to bans.<br><br>First is the voting structure. There&#39;s been several proposals for that, and here&#39;s one more. First, to ban, you need a large percentage (2/3rds at least) of the people voting to vote yes. <br><br>Second, you need a quorum of Boarders to actually cast a (non-abstention) vote. I&#39;m still fuzzy on what a quorum looks like. Maybe, say, a bit less than half of the people who&#39;ve posted {in the last week, on the front page, some other such thing}. The point of this requirement is to stop a small group pushing a ban through (not that I think anyone would do that) while people aren&#39;t looking.<br><br>Third, like Phobos said, the vote closes some time (I like a day or two) after the last vote is cast.<br><br>I also agree that the person that&#39;s being voted on gets to state their case.<br><br>Then, there&#39;s the issue of how long we ban for, which is probably a case-by-case thing. Have we ever actually permabanned someone? I don&#39;t remember. <br><br>And then there&#39;s the question of what warrants a ban in the first place. I think the bans we&#39;ve issued fall into two categories: persistent bad behavior after multiple polite explanations and such things, or doing something that&#39;s <i>so</i> out of line that you get shown the door. We might want to figure out what the consensus ban threshold actually is, but I don&#39;t know if this thread is the right place for it.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>In no particular order:<br>1) Jacer, zDimensia and Rifle Calibre Guy were all perma-banned. IIRC Jacer is the only case when it happened right away, though.<br>2) Generally speaking &quot;how long&quot; is resolved on a case-by-case basis and I see no reason to change it.<br>3) I think that half of the people having posts on the front page at the time of the proposal is a good number for a quorum.<br>4) It seems that most people agree that a 60%-66% &quot;yes&quot; vote is required for a ban.</p>

            <p>A ban is the community asking someone to leave. If they don&#39;t, it&#39;s enforced with an IP block.

            <p>... I think the person is allowed to write missions once the ban is over, or apply for Permission if they didn&#39;t have it already.<br>I suppose if someone writes PPC stories while they are under a ban, it&#39;s the same as if they write without Permission at all. I&#39;m not sure how we would find out about it since they probably won&#39;t link to their stories on the Board and in the Wiki. And I actually don&#39;t know how the community handles people who missions without Permission. I don&#39;t remember it coming up in my time here.</p>

            <p>Like, if we don&#39;t want someone as part of the community, why the hell would we want them to write for it? Maybe it should be a secondary thing, like, your Permission is revoked and you have to do it again, maybe with different prompts, but it&#39;s not always added on as conditions of the ban.<br><br>That said, maybe that&#39;s being overly harsh. I don&#39;t think it should be for six-month bans, but more serious offences should maybe carry it, maybe as a sort of enforced probation period. Like, you&#39;re prevented from asking for Permission for X amount of time to prove to us that you&#39;re a changed person and you&#39;ve learned your lesson.</p>

            <p>I certainly don&#39;t think someone should be allowed to write PPC-stories while they&#39;re under the ban, whether it be temporary or permanent. That should be treated just like someone writing without having gotten Permission at all.<br><br>But the Permission process is there to prove that you can write well. It&#39;s perfectly possibly to be able to write good and funny stories and still make such a huge donkey of yourself that you end up getting banned.<br>If someone have already proven themselves capable of writing well and maybe even have some good missions under their belt, I don&#39;t see the point in having them reapply for Permission upon their return, unless the reason for their ban had something specifically to do with their writing.<br><br>If someone didn&#39;t have Permission before their ban, I think they should hang around a month and let us all get to know them before applying, as if they were newcomers.</p>

            <p>In particular, because it can account for changes in behaviour during the vote. If someone was under threat of banning, but saw the error of their ways and sincerely apologised to all involved, I feel like people should be able to change their opinion to reflect that. And vice versa; if the prospective banee were to start insulting everyone for <i>daring</i> to try to ban them, no voters should be able to change to yes.<br>To make tallying easier, I feel like anyone with a vote should be required to put their vote in the subject line (possibly bolded, too, for easy spotting?).<br>I also think that the vote-end condition should ignore changes of votes. Presumably we wait so that people have time to see the vote. Anyone changing their vote has already seen it an had their say, so it&#39;d be their responsibility to make a quick decision and post it in time. (For the record, I think it should be 24 hours since the last vote.) This would prevent one person stalling the vote indefinitely by repeatedly flip-flopping.</p>

            <p>While I agree with Phobos that the person being discussed probably shouldn&#39;t have a vote, why not include a provision for them getting to state their case? Obviously they would vote not to be banned, but that might be a good compromise as having say goes - since people making the proposal have to outline a case for a ban, it seems right that the person being discussed be able to present their own case for <i>not</i> being banned. But maybe I&#39;m babbling pointlessly.</p>

            <p>On Abstain votes, I believe they should be treated as neither for or against an action.  Treat them as a separate entity all together.<br><br>The other thing I wanted to mention is on whether the accused should have a say.  I believe they should be allowed to vote for the main reason that it will be an offset vote.  The person initiating the ban will always vote in favor of the ban, or else they would not have brought it up in the first place.  To explain the problem with that here is an example.  A ban motion has been made.  The person initiating it obviously votes yes.  So for some strange reason no one else responds or they all abstain and we get 100% in favor 0 against and because that would satisfy the 60% as is currently required the ban would pass.  This to me seems like an unfair result.  So for that reason alone I think the person should be allowed to vote.<br><br>Alternatively I would suggest that the person proposing the ban is unallowed to vote for the same reasons.  Or abstentions count neither for or against the ban, but totals to the amount of votes.  For example 10 people vote so 6 would need to vote in favor for the ban.  Of the 10 voters 4 abstain.  That means the yeses would need all six votes to carry the motion.  I am just looking at it as a way to protect the accused.  These are just my initial brainstorming on the idea.  <br><br>I also think there should be some number of minimum votes beyond percentages.  For many of the reasons I mentioned above, I do not want to see some fluke were only five people vote and that allows a ban of a community member.  I do not know what a good number would be, but I think there should be some number required.<br><br>As an example I would say that in order for a ban to occur one needs 60% of the vote with at least 10 people saying voting in favor.  (Someone else would need to work out the actual minimum number, but you get the idea.)<br><br>I also would not be opposed to requiring 2/3 of a majority vote (66%) in order for the percentages to be met.  Banning is the most serious punishment that can be handed out here and the requirements should reflect that.  <br><br>So in short I say a minimum of 60% (though I prefer 66% at a minimum)  of non-abstaining votes (if both the person proposing the ban and the subject of the ban votes are not counted or are allowed to offset each other) with at least X number of people voting in favor.  <br><br>I do think abstentions do have an important role to play.  They can help foster debate on whether the subject of the ban is actually deserving of it.  And it allows people some time to gain new information and alter their decisions.<br><br>Now that I think about it more as I&#39;ve been writing this, I am actually in favor a more formal process altogether.  Not only discussion between the voters, but also a chance for the accused to be able to put on some kind of a defense.  This really is a severe sanction and should be treated as such.  Though I would allow less process for temporary bans.  <br><br>So my process proposals:<br><br>3 months or less:  No vote from the ban request or subject.  Minor debate between voting parties, 50% +1 person.  This is temporary and does not need quite as much protections<br><br>Between 3 and 6 months just change the percentage to 60% +1, minimum number of votes for (12 for a placeholder).  In other words 60% of the voters plus one person must vote for with a minimum of 12 votes in favor, but with the +1 requirement it would amount to 13 votes for (the numbers can be adjusted, but you get the picture)<br><br>Up to a year:  66% of all voters.  Minimum of some number of votes greater than the previous grade.  (so 15 for now as an example).  Vigorous debate between voters.  Some kind of opportunity for the subject to be heard.  In other words not only would you need 66% of all votes to be in favor, and at least 15 people to say yes.  In other words even if you meet the percentage requirement if there are not 15 yeses, then I think there should be no ban at this level.<br><br>Permanent Ban:  75% Of all voters.  Minimum of 20+ in favor of the ban.  An absolute requirement of the person proposing the ban to state clearly and concisely the behaviors that in their mind warrant banning, preferably with chat logs and citations to the provisions of the Constitution that have been violated.  Further the accused would be able to give his or her reasons why they do not believe they should be banned providing any evidence they believe in their favor (including their own chat logs if so appropriate).  And any person who votes with a (nm) message should first be asked a follow up why (preferably with an answer beyond I just do not like them), and if no follow up is given said vote should be counted as an abstention until and unless some reason is given.<br><br>That&#39;s how I would set up the process or something similar.</p>

            <p>Lets say 100 people vote and 50 are in favour of an unqualified ban and 25 say they want a temporary ban of one year.

            <p>That bans should default to a temporary (one year, perhaps) ban in case it is not otherwise decided. If there is a draw — frankly, I don&#39;t think that happens very often — a second round of voting is possible.</p>

            <p>I agree that abstain shouldn&#39;t be anything other than a non-vote (though honestly the best way to abstain and prevent getting lumped in is most likely to just not post in the ban thread at all.)<br><br>I also believe the person getting discussed shouldn&#39;t have a say in whether or not they get banned.

            <p>I can&#39;t see how my decision was counted as &quot;I&#39;m against it&quot;. If I wanted it to be that way, I would&#39;ve simply vote NO. Then why, you may ask, have I decided to abstain? The reason is simple, and I think all others who had abstained will agree:<br><br>I have no opinion on the matter.<br><br>It&#39;s equal to me not replying to the thread at all. If I didn&#39;t, would you still count me as a &#39;no&#39;, hS?<br><br>I&#39;ve had an opportunity to observe parliamentary works from up close. And, referencing <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=295341;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">[this] post, not all voting revolved around &quot;changing A to B&quot;, but also &quot;should X be implemented&quot;, and in both cases there were abstain votes.<br><br>My proposition is simple, and I think that&#39;s what Phobos stated only explained more simply for uneducated folk such as myself:<br><br>We vote on X (be it a ban, a change, etc.). There are those who vote YES, there are those who vote NO, there are those who ABSTAIN. At the end of the voting - that&#39;s a separate discussion - we look at the tally. Example:<br><br>YES - 10<br>ABSTAINED - 17<br>NO - 5<br><br>In this case, the YES voters win.<br><br>Also, I may be wrong about this, but would a 60% majority really be necessary? By definition, a majority is the opinion of the bigger group of people. Even a YES-NO ratio of 10-9 would be in favour of YES voters.</a></p>

            <p>Mine was the only case where the vote was non-unanimous, to my knowledge. Every other vote for a ban in my memory has been absolutely one-sided, and I honestly expected the vote for my ban to go that way as well.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think abstentions should be counted one way or the other. Not in the totals to determine a majority; not as defaulting to whatever is the &quot;default&quot;, whatever that is. (Surely the default for dealing with a disruptive person should be &quot;ban&quot;? But I digress.) Abstaining formally should get the same result as abstaining informally (that is, not posting) - your vote doesn&#39;t count at all.<br><br>The person under threat of banning also shouldn&#39;t get a say; they&#39;re effectively suspended while the vote takes place. Of course, they can make posts defending themselves and trying to convince people to vote for them, but their opinion shouldn&#39;t be treated as a vote.<br><br>To counter the issue brought up below, about a 10-2 vote out of 100 people leading to a ban: we should require some sort of quorum for this sort of vote. Say, 33% of the people who have posted on the front page need to vote (and not abstain). Then whatever majority we decide is necessary for a ban to go through. No quorum = no decision.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this since it blew up a little bit ago.  I like the fact that the way abstentions were counted by hS skewed the vote in favor of the subject of the ban because, in a way, it is keeping general lack of knowledge and/or apathy from getting someone banned.  If you don&#39;t know enough to choose one way or the other, then the case for banning has not been made strongly enough.  At least that is my personal feeling.<br><br>That said, I see the point that you and StormeHawk are making.  If you really don&#39;t want to have your opinion counted, then that should be your choice.  In fact, anyone who just didn&#39;t say anything in that thread was already not having their opinion counted.  And that last point is actually what swayed me here.<br><br><br>So, I vote thusly:<br><br>Abstaining doesn&#39;t count toward either side and, in fact, shrinks the total number of votes being considered for purposes of determining percentages.<br><br>I also think a super majority of 66% of the pool should be needed to enact a ban.  Banning is a big deal and a simple majority just isn&#39;t enough.<br><br>The person who is being voted on doesn&#39;t need a vote, partly because we already know what it will be, but also because it shouldn&#39;t be their decision whether they&#39;ve broken the rules sufficiently to be banned.  That is the rest of the group&#39;s decision.<br><br><br>By my thinking, if you have 101 people in the group and one is up for a ban, then the total starting pool is 100 votes.  If 50 people abstain, the pool is reduced to 50 votes.  In order to enact a ban, at least 33 of those 50 remaining votes would need to be in favor of the ban.<br><br><br>Let me know if there are any questions.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I support the idea of three categories: In favor, against, and abstaining. A sixty percent majority of all votes--counting the abstaining--to pass the ban sounds good to me. Presumably, a person abstains for their own reasons, and their opinion ought to be counted when it comes to passing the measure.<br><br>Furthermore, I think a response thread ought to be started in which each person who feels they have been wronged or have seen wrongdoing <i>in a response to one of their own posts</i> can report it, linking to the offending post(s). That way, no one person feels they have to shoulder the burden of finding every instance of abuse and reporting it. Then, if it&#39;s necessary, someone can go through and create a master list of accusations so it&#39;s easier to keep track of. <br><br>The political side of me comes out in this: I think there ought to be a small committee, perhaps three to five, consisting of people who both know the Constitution and are relatively unbiased in this matter, to go through the master list and see if each accusation holds water. This should be done as speedily as possible. They can then present the new list as evidence: If someone has a problem with the new charges, I&#39;m not entirely sure what should be done. Presumably a debate would ensue, but it would likely result in a stalemate; this is the most tentative of my opinions. Feel free to completely disregard it--I know it would be a fair bit of work. Each committee would likely be different for each case for banning, but they don&#39;t happen much.<br><br>I realize that my suggested process is probably too laborious, but at the same time, banning is a big deal, and ought to be taken seriously. A process ought to be in place to make sure it&#39;s as fair as possible, and, hopefully, we won&#39;t have to use it much.<br><br>Those are my thoughts, take them or leave them. <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>I abstained with the intention of &#39;I&#39;m opting out of this vote, this is so that you know not to wait around for me to participate&#39;. Ultimately, yes, it means that I&#39;ll go with the majority, but the opinion behind it is generally &#39;I can&#39;t decide one way or the other, and so do not want to be counted one way or the other. I will abide by the majority decision even if I was not completely for it (or against it)&#39;. That&#39;s the type of abstention I learned about, and it&#39;s generally what I mean if I say I&#39;m abstaining.<br><br>And that&#39;s the definition I know /shrugs/ Probably the community should agree on a definition and state it either somewhere that applies to all votes unless otherwise stated or, of course, just remind people of it at the beginning of a vote. That way, if someone understands it to mean something else, they can be clear about saying &#39;I don&#39;t plan to vote in this and don&#39;t want to be counted at all in any direction&#39;, or &#39;I don&#39;t know which way I want to vote and so you can feel free to count me in with the default opinion&#39;, where one of these does not fit the PPC community definition of &#39;to abstain&#39;. That sounds pretty useful (though I don&#39;t mean it can never be mentioned with a different definition in a different context, just that there should potentially be an official definition of abstention for voting purposes).<br><br>And that&#39;s pretty much all I have to say about any of this right now. Doubt I&#39;ll be adding anything else, either, actually, especially with the holiday about to start (tomorrow evening, and yes, I most certainly do plan to post the Purim rp before Pesach/Passover :D).

            <p>I&#39;ve been debating whether or not to post this for a week or so, and I&#39;ve finally decided to go ahead and do it. I&#39;ve been curious about how the Sherlockians on the PPC, a place of fabulously diverse opinions and respectful banter, have received Sally Donovan. Personally, I have very strong opinions about her that I won&#39;t yet reveal, because this first post is neutral. <br><br>So go ahead! Discuss, argue, find someone else with your opinion, drink tea, read metas, and have some more discussion and do a bit more arguing. (I will be doing all of the above). As I&#39;ve said, I wonder how you all feel about Sgt. Donovan.<br><br><s>Also, I just wanted to talk about Sally.</s><br><br>-Vee</p>

            <p>Stupid stuff on the shield because of malapropers — the original fic had quite a lot of those, including a &quot;coup de tat&quot;; something to maybe represent Shatner-levels of ellipsis abuse, too. Colours, well, the Sue had &quot;heterochromia, one eye was a darker blue color, and the other was green blue&quot;.

            <p>And yeah, she... kind of does. Well, the only traditional one she&#39;d have is the rose (for obvious reasons) and those are a real pain in the neck to draw, and while one assumes <i>miri</i> are there as representations of the stars in LotR-Elvish arms, the gold five-pointed star as a symbol may not be relevant in the cultural context of Critta-Kalthin&#39;s very own Jafar.<br><br>Hammers and sickles are used in Communist ideology to represent the union of urban workers and rural peasants in the overthrow of capitalism.

            <p>... is clip out Lady Iximaz&#39;s rose and put it in the centre. It seems like the sort of thing Ye Scape-Grace might do (similar to Hieronymus using Neshomeh&#39;s green on his coat).

            <p>A few ideas:<br><br>-That d20 is just crying out to be used as an <i>indil in fore</i>.<br><br>-Feathers are always popular, and I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve had any in red yet. You could angle them into an X rather than a + if you wanted to differentiate them from mine and Des&#39;s arms.<br><br>-You could have a &#39;circle&#39; of swords, like the feathers on <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/File:RavenArms1.png">the Raven&#39;s arms</a>. (Massive apologies, but I can&#39;t remember if you have Permission yet; I&#39;m not sure whether to aim for four points or eight.)<br><br>-That ornate eagle tail could actually make a very nice point by itself. The curls could then semi-enclose any other designs.<br><br>If you want, I can mock up a couple of ideas (once I know how many points I need!); it&#39;s fun and my brain needs a break from everything else sometimes.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>1°) That seems like a good idea. Should have thought about it sooner.<br><br>2 , 3, 4°) All of these ideas have got merits and are appealing. However, it will be four points only. Although I was given Permission last December (and knew this during my birthday :)), and I&#39;ve wrotten three stories until now, yor Heraldry guide says that barons are the ones who can use eight points, not the knights.<br><br>Feel free to think about it, hS.

            <p>I&#39;ve been wanting to get involved with Plort. Should I just set up a profile and go? Or is there a process? I&#39;d be a civilian, of course, but since I&#39;m hoping to become a knight someday, would that make me a page? If so, should I attach myself to a knight? Sir Ekyl seems to be putting together a militia; should I ask them? Or would it go by Big Sib/Little Sib pairs? I don&#39;t have a Big Sib, but I could join House Skull Goblet, Kind Words and a Two-by-Four, or Darjeeling. <br><br>--Key is excited</p>

            <p>*I don&#39;t mind people creating their insert out-of-season. You can set up a page for it yourself, or post the tale of Cat-on-the-Keyboard here and I&#39;ll put it in the Cyclopaedia.<br><br>*When/if you get Permission, Plort!you becomes a knight, so there&#39;s no defined process your character has to follow prior to that (other than the stuff around the Knights&#39; Road). If you want to call yourself a page, squire, protoknight, or swordling, you can go ahead.<br><br>*Plort reflects the community. If your insert is attached to Sir Ekyl, you should probably have some connection to Ekyl yourself (though it&#39;s not really required). Similarly, your residence should be based on what you do most in the PPC community: are you on the Board, RPing, working on the Wiki, or chatting with people on Google Talk or whatever?<br><br>*<a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Beginner%27s_Guide_to_Plort">There&#39;s a beginner&#39;s guide</a> which is good to know about. (And yes, you&#39;re allowed to establish new locations in your origin story, though make sure they fit the theme...)<br><br>*I don&#39;t really know what Ekyl&#39;s up to; he&#39;s trying to establish himself as the centre of off-Board activity in the PPC, if his character&#39;s actions are to be believed.<br><br>*I need to make a Cyclopaedia page for heraldry. Gah.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>This is what I said on the last big Plort thread:<br><br>Each and every member of the PPC Community is also a resident of Plort. You can find the autobiographies of everyone who&#39;s done this before in the WikiCyclopaedia (mine is here, for example). If you haven&#39;t already written your history, why not join in and give one? There&#39;s a guide on doing so on the CycloWiki, and a glossary outlining most of the websites and fandoms in the setting.<br><br>For entertainment value, please post your bios here on the Board; if you want to cross-post them to the Cyclopaedia, go ahead, but I&#39;m happy to sort that out for you. A couple of notes:<br><br>-Make sure to choose which of the four nations of the Union you live in, and indeed where in it; there’s nothing wrong with adding small towns and villages wherever you please, or you can live in the cities. Up to you!<br><br>-Everyone can have their own pair of heraldic devices, according to Plort’s two systems as described <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CRwK0B70gWO0lJ_TgeiyTEF_l6A6_yyQ2BgH9ATKL6w/edit">here</a>. If you can describe your device/s, either formally as described there or just vaguely, I’ll (try to) make it for you.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>So there you go. The Sib Houses haven&#39;t yet made their way into Plort, though I&#39;d be interested to see them do so (they do after all have pre-made heraldry).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I would never dream of such a thing.  Having a jester is such a chore, after all.  You must feed them and walk them.  And one never knows when they will chew the furniture.

            <p>Greetings, Sir Ekyl of Godreve. I am Matthias Snow, newly named Knight from the town of Tumblar.<br><br>As you may have already heard, Baron Dann has named themself Baron Juliette the Forth. I would not normally be contacting you upon this simple matter, however the politics of Tumblar has led to much rejoicing on the matter, and I have once more discovered why exactly Dame Wandering Winterwood has nicknamed the area &quot;Ye Olde Mob Rental.&quot;<br><br>Indeed I have found myself entrapped within my place of business, and I request assistance as soon as you can manage. Included is a map towards my Forge from the entrance  to Tumblar from Godreve Road. I can apply arts of beytah on your arrival should you need it.<br><br>~Sir Matthias Snow, wishing godspeed to both you and this Pigeon on which my letter of knighting has arrived.</p>

            <p>I shall send some of my men-at-arms, and a portion of Godreve&#39;s militia, to restore peace to Tumblar. These are able men, veterans of many campaign seasons with me, and should be able to bring the mob to heel without anyone being seriously hurt. If you can, send correspondence to the town&#39;s leaders, and tell them to look for the sight of men marching under the crowned bull; they will work with local authorities to bring about order, and I&#39;m confident this matter shall be resolved soon. Let it be known that, in my capacity as deputy to Baron Cassie, I strongly suggest they get their act together, and have their peacekeepers start actually doing their jobs.<br><br>((I have no idea what this translates to OOC, but hey))</p>

            <p>You have my very preemptive apologies, I&#39;m sorry for the size of a mess that name and pronoun changes have on a wiki.<br><br>The works I&#39;ve contributed to PPC canon can stay as-is: I&#39;m pretty sure that Agent Dann is not trans, or at least has no interest in changing name or pronouns.<br><br>As far as references to myself go, I would be fine with redirecting my current name page to a new one with a note on names and pronouns. I&#39;m pretty much open about being trans, both online and off, so I&#39;m definitely not going to insist on retconning all references to me, or anything like that.<br><br>I can certainly contribute time to making the edits as well, when I finally get an evening free - I&#39;m afraid that life is trying to eat all of my spare time at the moment.</p>

            <p>It&#39;ll take a while for the wiki to update the search function, but.<br><br>Per the story, the situation is similar to the Board - there was Baron Dann, and now she is Baron Juliette.

            <p>I want to apologize in advance, though.  I have a fair bit of mental inertia, and it takes time to fully switch names and pronouns in my head.  I will probably screw up at some point, but I will be trying to get it right.<br><br>All that said, it is good to have you back.

My preferred apparatus is aerial hoop, which I have dubbed the Machine of Many Bruises. For an apparatus that rewards flexibility and graceful movement, it&#39;s very unforgiving.

            <p>My gift to you is... Eh, I&#39;m running low on creativity, so I&#39;ll just lend you my copy of &quot;Excluded&quot; by Julia Serano. It&#39;s special because it contains typos which can be used to decode a long-forgotten message... Telling of a world of which all knowledge has been suppressed. Read at your own risk... Also my copy of &quot;Flatterland&quot; by Ian Stewart. There&#39;s nothing special about that one; it&#39;s just a fun book. <br><br>Hi. I&#39;m Key. Or Cat. Or whatever. I am a cis female who randomly happens to know a lot about transgender issues (that&#39;s my story and I&#39;m sticking to it). I&#39;m a newbie.  I&#39;m fairly young and have a lot of dumb ideas.

            <p>Much as I hate to say it... I strongly disliked Excluded, mostly because of the wonderful things she had to say about the non-binary community (where I stake my identity claim), and people who identify as pan and other inclusive sexualities beyond bi. I am not a fan of how she spent multiple chapters arguing against making or lives subject to political rhetoric, and then immediately accused pan and nb people of claiming their identities with political intent.<br><br>...good heavens, it is much too early in the morning for discourse.<br><br>Anyways! It is good to meet you, and I will appreciate the gifts in the intent that they were given.</p>

            <p>I assumed you were mostly in her camp, though, since on your Tumblr you described yourself as &quot;transfeminine,&quot; which is her word, and one which <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2016/Sadlyno.com/archives/39263">has been criticized</a> for being binary.<br><br>But anyway, this reminds me that I haven&#39;t actually read Excluded in a while. When I first found it, I was 13 and utterly star struck by the fact that anyone was actually discussing specifically bi/pan/etc. issues in any way at all. Also, it made me want to be a writer, for whatever reason. So there&#39;s actually a good chance that my primary attachment to this book is more sentimental than it is rational... I&#39;m going to reread it. I haven&#39;t in...oh my, probably a year. Eek. <br><br>Here, pretend that I just gave you Flatterland. That one isn&#39;t problematic. Probably. It&#39;s a novel about geometry. There&#39;s probably lots of room for awful in there; I&#39;m just not getting it yet. But there&#39;s a personification of Mandelbrot&#39;s set and a lot of puns, so...actually, that probably makes it inherently awful... I&#39;m starting to realize that real books are a very bad returnbie gift. *shrugs*<br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>Especially around the idea of oppositional sexism that she wrote in Whipping Girl, and in general in the interests of being supportive of trans people of all stripes.<br><br>The community that I run in doesn&#39;t criticize &quot;transfeminine&quot; and &quot;transmasculine&quot;, so it&#39;s probably a regional difference - and I do identify as feminine (some of the time), and I did start in an assigned-male body, so &quot;transfeminine&quot; is a reasonably apt term for me - I guess I don&#39;t really see it as being hugely binary? Femininity is a major axis at play in gender, and in my trans journey, so I&#39;m comfortable with it.<br><br>But yeah. She&#39;s said things that I disagree with, and Excluded contained significantly more of them than Whipping Girl.<br><br>On the other hand, Flatterland looks incredible - anything that contains geometry and horrible puns is a solid win in my book.</p>

            <p>Well, yes and no. The school - SANCA - is one of the biggest circus schools in the nation, we&#39;ve got alums with Cirque du Soleil and various other big-name professional circusses. There are many staff and student shows throughout the year! (And if you&#39;re in the Seattle area, I definitely recommend catching one. Shameless plug is shameless, etc.)<br><br>However, I haven&#39;t performed yet (still working on moves, endurance, and turning a set of moves into a performance), and neither have most of my classmates - still working towards that point.</p>

It&#39;s effect is pretty cool; it grants Flying STAB and all the resistances of the Flying type (with none of the weaknesses) and increases the holder&#39;s base Speed by 25%. On Medicham, it&#39;s basically there for the Speed boost, since Medicham&#39;s base speed is fairly average at 80, but it still give a resistance to Bug and an immunity to the common Ground attacking type, which is always nice since Medicham&#39;s defences mean it sometimes has trouble switching in. Try an Jolly one with EVs in Attack and Speed, and give it the moves High Jump Kick, Zen Headbutt, Thunder Punch, and Drain Punch for some additional healing. Most importantly, though: have fun. =]</p>

            <p>... the colours those words come out as when you shove them into a font tag.<br><br>So [font color=&quot;Delta Juliette&quot;]<font color="Delta Juliette">like this</font>[/font].<br><br>They are calculable - we had a long thread a year or two back delving into exactly how the HTML parsed them. Let me think...<br><br>What it&#39;s doing is splitting your name into three chunks:<br><br>DELTA _JULI ETTE0<br><br>Then it&#39;s reading the first two characters of each chunk as a hex value, rendering everything other than 0-9a-f as 0:<br><br>DE 00 E0<br><br>... and that&#39;s your RGB value. The tricky part comes when a) your name is too short, or b) your name is too long. Oh, or c) your name would come out as 00 00 00.<br><br>(From memory: three letters or less gets split into three and then padded from the front: AA becomes AA0 becomes 0A 0A 0A. On the flip side, if the three chunks are more than 8 characters each, it trims them down to 8 from the <i>left</i> before continuing to trim from the right. And it will always trim all three equally from the left until it finds a valid hex code in one of them. It&#39;s all very strange.)<br><br>hS, rambling a bit</p>

            <p>It&#39;s so great that you&#39;re back that I&#39;m completely willing to ignore all the water you&#39;ve just splashed on to the carpet. <br><br>Good on you with all the gender change stuff. <br>I know bugger all about that kind of thing, but it must be rough. Or, at least, confusing. <br>I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve never tried it. <br><br>I must ask, by circus do you mean... y&#39;know, big red tent, acrobats, lions and stuff? </p>

            <p>Yes, I literally mean the circus arts of tents, acrobats, and the rest - lions aren&#39;t common any more, especially in the Cirque Nouveau movement, but I&#39;m sure we could get some acrobats to wear sufficient amounts of makeup! I&#39;m studying aerial arts at Seattle&#39;s <a href="http://sancaseattle.org/">School of Acrobatics and New Circus Arts</a>. I don&#39;t have any recent photos, but I&#39;ve been assembling the requisite collection of burns and bruises from silks, rope, static trapeze, and aerial hoop.</p>

            <p>Re. Agent Dann: I don&#39;t think so? He&#39;s a copy-paste of me from a very long time ago, well before I was even beginning to think about gender things. For what little authority I have over a character I stopped writing a decade ago, he&#39;s probably still guy-identifying, with a fairly androgynous presentation.</p>
