            <p>An acquaintance of mine recently directed me to <a href="http://thegeekiary.com/favorite-steven-universe-ship-says/30262">this page</a> about shipping in <i>Steven Universe</i>. Being an aficionado of both shipping in general and the show itself, I got a few kicks out of it. But it also got me thinking about what sort of semi-serious, semi-jokey analyses might be applied to possible pairings within the PPC itself (and I mean in-universe ships; put the Shipfest out of your collective minds). After a bit of brainstorming, I came up with a few possibilities.<br><br>A few notes beforehand. This will contain references to M/M and F/F relationships in addition to M/F. If you’re not into that, you might be better off giving this thread a miss. Also, this is meant to be for fun. I’m not trying to attack anyone, nor attack anyone’s favorite ships. It’s also by no means a listing of every possible PPC pairing. If there’s one you can think of that I missed (or one with a definition that was off the mark), feel free to suggest your own!<br><br>Now then: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iroqGxgQMQ5R7uHAXlmGLT48yZyslw7jhTi9rcpHhIQ/edit?usp=sharing">On to the analyses!</a></p>

            <p>Except for friendships. I love friendship stories.<br><br>Maybe what that says about me is that I&#39;m asexual IRL and don&#39;t really see sex and romance as particularly interesting--why bother with the biological stuff when a meeting of minds and hearts is just as intimate? Besides which, if you&#39;re asexual/panromantic/poly, you don&#39;t even have limits on exclusivity of relationships. You&#39;re free to love everybody and anybody, and unlike sexual folks, you can eat cake at the same time. :)<br><br>So, my favorite ships would probably be those which are basically friendships. Jay/Acacia being romantic doesn&#39;t really strike me as particularly likely, though; those two simply don&#39;t seem to be attracted to each other.</p>

            <p>I recall something from the Badfic Games. Apparently, somebody jokingly shipped Rina with Valon.

            <p>Shipping these two means you&#39;re fond of relationships you don&#39;t expect. You feel that love can blossom between people you didn&#39;t think would go so well together, and that love can also stem from surprising circumstances. So you may find yourself saying, &quot;Why would I ship these? It sounds so... strange.&quot; But then after a while, they eventually become your OTP, full stop.<br><br>Mind you, we&#39;re planning on a mission which doubles as Cupid and Steph&#39;s first date, and needless to say it doesn&#39;t quite go to plan.<br><br>As for the others, I kinda see Chakkik/Rayner as a platonic ship with a teensy bit of homo tension. They do sound like what TV Tropes refers to as Those Two Guys (who serve as a Greek Chorus and snark about everything), and I get the feeling that shipping them is a sign of fondness for pairings based on this trope.</p>

            <p><b>Rina/Marvin:</b> They <i>were</i> implied to share a few offscreen flying lessons together, and the word &#39;date&#39; was even used once, so clearly something was going on between them!

            <p>You could probably guess that my ships from the list are Byrdtree and Dafydd/Constance (Dafstance? Sillian? I quite like Sillian). And... yeah, taken together they describe me pretty well.<br><br>Other ships from Team Huinesoron:<br><br><b>Dafydd Illian/Selene Windflower</b><br><br>You like your romances dark and angsty; you may be a teenager. Love is best when one partner is agonising over it, and even better when the second is deliberately ignoring them. They might get together in the end, but <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10kHxFcbrrN-kS0-5FAvc_kAZ12zj2_iHjgEPLkatIE0/pub">maybe it would be even better if they don&#39;t</a>.<br><br><b>Dafydd Illian/Vemi Fincaran</b><br><br>Long-term relationships are overrated. You want to see two high-energy characters meet, get together, and go their separate ways in as little time as possible. You think relationships should be founded on actual feelings, but don&#39;t think those feelings need to be particularly deep.<br><br><b>Mortic Wentway/Elanor Laison</b><br><br>You like to believe that love conquers all, and will keep on believing that even when all seems to have indisputably conquered love. If it would take a miracle for two people to get together, so be it. If that miracle fails, you&#39;ll just keep waiting for a bigger one.<br><br><b>Kaitlyn Jackson/Selene Windflower</b><br><br>You are a firm believer that opposites attract. You like to see couples start off irritated by each other, but grow to need exactly the thing they were annoyed by. Alternately, you may just really like one or more of: hobbits, vampires, lesbians.<br><br><b>Kaitlyn Jackson/Agent Huinesoron</b><br><br>For some reason, you think that two opposite-sexed gay agents should get together. There&#39;s certainly something here you don&#39;t believe in - it could be homosexuality, sexual orientation in general, or simply the idea that any versions of hS and Kaitlyn can keep their hands off each other.<br><br>I&#39;d be quite interested to see what people <i>actually</i> ship in my writings, but I suspect the answer to be the same as for everyone else: &#39;not much, because there&#39;s lots of PPC and not a lot of it&#39;s yours&#39;.<br><br>Oh, and of course, one more:<br><br><b>Agent Alleb/Doktor Trollenfisch</b><br><br>OH DEAR ILUVATAR THE SNUGGLES ARE SO ADORABLE! You may be Agent Kaitlyn.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><b>Jennifer Robinson x Supernumerary</b><br>You enjoy relationships where you only really get the point of view of one of the participants. Part of the appeal is trying to see what makes the other person tick. You want to see deep conversations delving into emotions, but tempered with some friendly sarcasm at the same time.<br><br><b>Eledhwen Elerossiel x Christianne Shieh</b><br>Your ideal ship plays with the idea of &quot;opposites attract&quot; a bit, but not to the point where the concept overwhelms the narrative. It&#39;s all about that low-key intimacy, to the point where those involved have become so close that their various quirks mix together. If there&#39;s a hint of sadness involved, even better.</p>

            <p>...<br><br><b>1920s Wizarding America</b><br>By J.K. Rowling<br><br><i>The wizards of America had played their part in the Great War of 1914-1918, even if the overwhelming majority of their No-Maj compatriots were ignorant of their contribution. As there were magical factions on both sides, their efforts were not decisive, but they won many victories in preventing additional loss of life, and in defeating their magical enemies.<br><br>This common endeavour led to no softening on MACUSA’s stance on No-Maj/wizard fraternisation, and Rappaport’s Law remained firmly in place. By the 1920s the US wizarding community had become used to existing under a greater degree of secrecy than their European counterparts and to selecting their mates strictly from within their own ranks.<br><br>The memory of Dorcus Twelvetrees&#39; catastrophic breach of the Statute of Secrecy had entered magical language, so that being ‘a Dorcus’ was slang for an idiot or inept person. MACUSA continued to impose severe penalties on those who flouted the International Statute of Secrecy. MACUSA was also more intolerant of such magical phenomena as ghosts, poltergeists and fantastic creatures than its European equivalents, because of the risk such beasts and spirits posed of alerting No-Majs to the existence of magic.<br><br>After the Great Sasquatch Rebellion of 1892 (for full details, see Ortiz O’Flaherty’s highly-acclaimed book Big Foot’s Last Stand), MACUSA headquarters was relocated for the fifth time in its history, moving from Washington to New York, where it remained throughout the 1920s. President of MACUSA throughout the decade was Madam Seraphina Picquery, a famously gifted witch from Savannah.<br><br>By the 1920s Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry had been flourishing for more than two centuries and was widely considered to be one of the greatest magical education establishments in the world. In consequence of their common education, all witches and wizards are proficient in the use of a wand.<br><br>Legislation introduced at the end of the nineteenth century meant that every member of the magical community in America was required to carry a ‘wand permit’, a measure that was intended to keep tabs on all magical activity and identify the perpetrators by their wands. Unlike Britain, where Ollivanders was considered unbeatable, the continent of North America was served by four great wandmakers.<br><br>Shikoba Wolfe, who was of Chocktaw descent, was primarily famous for intricately carved wands containing Thunderbird tail feathers (the Thunderbird is a magical American bird closely related to the phoenix). Wolfe wands were generally held to be extremely powerful, though difficult to master. They were particular prized by Transfigurers.<br><br>Johannes Jonker, a Muggle-born wizard whose No-Maj father was an accomplished cabinet maker, turned himself into an accomplished wandmaker. His wands were highly sought after and instantly recognisable, as they were usually inlaid with mother-of-pearl. After experimenting with many cores, Jonker’s preferred magical material was hair of the Wampus cat.<br><br>Thiago Quintana caused ripples through the magical world when his sleek and usually lengthy wands began entering the market, each encasing a single translucent spine from the back of the White River Monsters of Arkansas and producing spells of force and elegance. Fears about over-fishing of the monsters were assuaged when it was proven that Quintana alone knew the secret of luring them, a secret he guarded jealously until his death, at which point wands containing White River Monster spines ceased production.<br><br>Violetta Beauvais, the famous wandmaker of New Orleans, refused for many years to divulge the secret core of her wands, which were always made of swamp mayhaw wood. Eventually it was discovered that they contained hair of the rougarou, the dangerous dog-headed monster that prowled Louisiana swamps. It was often said of Beauvais wands that they took to Dark magic like vampires to blood, yet many an American wizarding hero of the 1920s went into battle armed only with a Beauvais wand, and President Picquery herself was known to possess one.<br><br>Unlike the No-Maj community of the 1920s, MACUSA allowed witches and wizards to drink alcohol. Many critics of this policy pointed out that it made witches and wizards rather conspicuous in cities full of sober No-Majs. However, in one of her rare light-hearted moments, President Picquery was heard to say that being a wizard in America was already hard enough. ‘The Gigglewater’, as she famously told her Chief of Staff, ‘is non-negotiable.’</i><br><br>Looks like we have to wait until November to get information on Ilvermorny. Then again, leving it in the Roaring &#39;20s is a good point to stop before <i>Fantastic Beasts</i> hit the screens. </p>

            <p>I can absolutely see American wizard parents preferring to send their child to Hogwarts instead of Ilvermorny, particularly if their ancestors were British. Given how long-lived wizards seem to be, they might even be relatively recent ancestors.<br><br>Not that just anyone can enroll at Hogwarts, of course. When Hagrid says of Harry that &quot;his name&#39;s been down ever since he were born,&quot; that implies to me that you have to pre-register for a spot somehow. There&#39;s sense in this: it&#39;s a smallish castle, there&#39;s only so much space in the dorms, and there are only so many staff and so many hours for classes in the day. They can&#39;t take <i>everyone</i>.<br><br>Being familiar with Muggle things does seem right out, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Okay, so, say the range covers all of Great Britain and Ireland (a not unreasonable assumption). The Quill picks up magic from those born in the country. Also a reasonable assumption. What about tourists? The Quill and the Book between them are obviously able to distinguish between British subjects and people who simply happen to be here, otherwise young wizards and witches from anywhere in the world would make the Quill sit up and take notice. Perhaps they do. We don&#39;t know.<br><br>However, from what Pottermore has given us, I think the Quill is the means of detecting magic and the Book gives context to that magic. If the book is capable of measuring magical strength, then it is capable of measuring other things as well - or at least, ascertaining them. The Quill and the Book seem to be, at heart, a <i>vox dei</i> and <i>vox diaboli</i>; the former looks for reasons why someone can go to Hogwarts, while the latter (befitting its description as a curmudgeon) looks for reasons why they can&#39;t. Citizenship of the catchment area is probably one of the things one or both of them should be on the lookout for, as it benefits them not a jot if the child in question is to spend the rest of their days as a wizarding yak herder in Outer Mongolia.<br><br>In the <i>completely hypothetical</i> case you describe, it might be possible once the children move and acquire dual citizenship of either the UK or the Republic of Ireland, whichever <s>you prefer</s> is most fitting. =]</p>

            <p>So the common consensus (between you, me and Nesh) is that McGonagall didn’t speak in her cat form (clearly contradicting Dumledore’s comments in <i>The Tales of Beedle the Bard</i>), but appeared to speak before her transformation back to human had finished (which may be a gray area, but is probably not what JKR intended to say).    <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Yeah, it reads as though McGonagall speaks while she is in the act of transforming back, which doesn&#39;t make much sense. I think J.K.R. probably should have written the passage something like this:<br><br><i>Professor McGonagall turned back into herself with a faint </i>pop<i>. &quot;Really, what has got into you all today?&quot; she said, staring around at them all. &quot;Not that it matters, but that&#39;s the first time my transformation&#39;s not got applause from a class.&quot;</i><br><br>That puts events in the order they happen (which is very important for precisely the reasons shown in this example) and doesn&#39;t have her doing things at the same time that she shouldn&#39;t.<br><br>See also: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Ing_Disease">Ing Disease</a>.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Why do writers do this? Because it rolls so sweetly off the tongue?<br><br>Since the German equivalent sounds awkward, the translation uses simple past tense, but otherwise keeps the word order. So, JKR messed it up, but the translator drove it even further into the wrong direction. German!McGonagall apparently started to speak even before she began to transform, and that should be impossible.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>&quot;Magic in North America&quot; was basically &quot;Hey look white people do more of the same kinds of magic only in a different place&quot;. The few times JKR did write about anyone who wasn&#39;t white, she alienated and offended basically everyone paying attention who have ties to the communities in question, as the rather sizable twitter- and tumblr-storm following the first two releases show. At the point, I don&#39;t know that I&#39;m gonna even bother with her writing anymore, as she clearly has issues writing outside of her comfort zone and, as others have pointed out, has a tendency to just make things up when basic research would show that the opposite is true.</p>

            <p>I think a lot of the complaints (and I&#39;ve just read <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/j-k-rowlings-history-of-magic-in-north-america-was-a-t-1764311530">an actual article about them</a>, so I know what at least some of them are) come from a different perspective than mine on <i>why this exists in the first place</i>. I&#39;d like to address that in two points.<br><br>1/ Out-of-universe, what is this? It&#39;s a promotional piece for a new film. How much of a hand did JKR have in creating the <i>Fantastic Beasts</i> movie? Wikipedia says she wrote the script; did she also get to choose where it would be set? How the main characters would be cast? Whether it would be action, thriller, drama?<br><br>I&#39;m guessing not. I&#39;m guessing that the production team had far more to do with that, dictating what would make it &#39;a good (ie, profitable) movie&#39;. Which means that the &quot;History&quot; <i>had</i> to end up with a 1920s America in which white people in a white city run an oppressive government (okay, that&#39;s still <i>technically</i> speculation) and do the same kind of magic that people want to see in the film. Because that&#39;s what&#39;s in the film.<br><br>Now, this says nothing about all the backstory. She could&#39;ve written ten thousand words about how the Native Americans use a magic based on <s>the natural environment</s> (sorry, that&#39;s offensive) <s>their actual beliefs</s> (no, that is too), well, on whatever it is that she&#39;s allowed to comment on (any suggestions?). But:<br><br>2/ In-universe, &quot;The History...&quot; is a <b>blatant</b> propaganda piece. MACUSA is so wonderful! They run everything! They&#39;ve been called that since a hundred years before the name made sense because they&#39;re so historical! Segregation is totally a good idea and Dorcus was such a dorcus, it&#39;s all her fault! The Demon Headmaster is a wonderful man! All Hail President Pickles - she even has a sense of humour!<br><br>This is <i>not</i> an unbiased story. It&#39;s predicated on the idea that Europeans are the best people and the government is the best of all possible governments. It gives lip service to the idea that there might be a few people who disagree, but then relentlessly drives home the point that President Pickles is the only True Way for American wizardry.<br><br>So yes, it forces Native magic (and it was a serious question for everyone: how could she have written that part that would not have offended everyone?) into the mould of European magic and ignores everything that doesn&#39;t fit. It makes <i>zero</i> mention of the massive African magical community brought over by force. It says that the magical segregation was forced on the good guys by the actions of the people they segregated themselves away from. It claims that hunting down family lines, genociding magical species, and Oblivating on a massive scale is a <b>good idea</b>.<br><br>And it&#39;s blatantly biased, <i>not</i> on JKR&#39;s end, but on the end of the unnamed in-universe writer of the piece. This is... it&#39;s like reading a Soviet history textbook. Half of the information you get is actually into the mindset of the system that created it, obtained by reading between the lines, not by just reading the words on the pace.<br><br>But people are taking it at face-value, and I think that&#39;s a real shame.<br><br>hS<br><br>(And to repeat my question a third time so it doesn&#39;t get lost: giving Natives a connection to nature is offensive. Saying they didn&#39;t have as high a technology level as Europeans is offensive. Working their genuine beliefs into a story is offensive. Claiming they helped European wizards on the run is offensive. (All from the article I linked to.) So: what should JKR have written that would <i>not</i> be offensive? Because not saying much about them is also offensive...)</p>

            <p><i>(Disclaimer: The following ficlet is entirely speculative, based on what we&#39;ve seen this week. It&#39;s also rendered in British idiom rather than trying to aim for something appropriate, because I do have my limits.)</i><br><br>If you listen to their high-and-mightinesses up in New York, you&#39;d think that they&#39;re the centre of American magic - that they encapsulate everything worth knowing about it, and lead an entire continent of witches and wizards.<br><br>Merlin&#39;s scratty beard they do.<br><br>The centre of American magic is right where it&#39;s been for three hundred years - down on the mighty Mississippi, in the melting pot where French, English, African and Native magic came together and made something better than all of them. Up in the icy north, the Rap is a way of life that keeps witches cowering in their homes, terrified to do anything that might bring MACUSA down on them. Down here, it&#39;s more like a guideline, if you get my drift.<br><br>And they know it, too. You should see them when they Apparate down here to buy their wands, all noses in the air and disdainful looks, haughty accents and fancy robes. No, President Pickles, we <i>don&#39;t</i> all have magical tailors who make our clothes for us. We&#39;re a bit busy doing <i>real</i> magic, not your fancy fakery.<br><br>Okay, we&#39;re not stupid. We play along when there&#39;s northerners in town, hiding away from our neighbours in magical streets that sit empty half the time. But when they&#39;re back in their cathedral of magical purity, of <i>course</i> we&#39;re gonna help out a neighbour if she needs it. It&#39;s a dangerous world, and we should all stick together.<br><br>Up in NYC, they call the people around them No-Majs. Like they can talk. Pure-Majs, the lot of them, who haven&#39;t cooked their own meals in decades.<br><br>And don&#39;t get me started on oh-so-wonderful Ilvermorny. I&#39;ve seen neighbourhood kids go off to their highfalutin&#39; school, but you know what? I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen one come back.<br><br>Says it all, don&#39;t it?<br><br><hr>
<br><br>My theory, encapsulated. MACUSA&#39;s rule is heavy in New York; it&#39;s much, much lighter down in New Orleans, whatever President <s>Pickles</s> Picquery might want you to believe.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Oh, that&#39;s brilliant! Here, let me follow up with an addendum of my own:<br><br>Darn it, the reason we moved out here in the first place was to get away from the government. We moved across the Rocky Mountains just so that we would have a chance to relax, mingle with our no-maj neighbors, and generally not have the government poking into every bit of our personal lives.<br><br>We didn&#39;t expect them to move out here too!<br><br>Ah well, joke&#39;s on them. We still practice our magic, openly and in full view of all our friends and coworkers. We&#39;ve been flaunting the International Statute of secrecy for years. Our magic has been broadcast over the whole world, and still they are ignorant. We&#39;re hiding in plain sight, because everyone knows we practice magic- movie magic.<br><br>Everyone knows that you can&#39;t ordinarily get what you see on screen in reality. What they don&#39;t know is that sometimes you can and do. Sometimes the magic shown on screen is the real deal, and sometimes the effects have been produced by supernatural means. Our magic has allowed directors to go all-out, and make movies truly spectacular. Our magic and their science have woven together to make something amazing. <br><br>Really, it&#39;s incredible what we can get away with. Sure, we have a bit of a scourer problem, but quite frankly &#39;wizard&#39; isn&#39;t the weirdest thing we&#39;ve been called. They can call us out on it all they want. It&#39;ll just get lost in a sea of rumors about us and everyone else in this business, and when we notice, we and/or our no-maj allies will deal with them (by ruining their creditability, how did you think we&#39;d go about it?).<br><br>We even recently helped release a whole movie series depicting the wizarding world, and we&#39;re still living mostly unmolested. Well, it helps that it&#39;s an adaption of J.K. Rowling&#39;s books. That woman is brilliant, telling the whole world about wizards in such a way that if they ever try to stop her, it would simply be evidence for what she says being true. <br><br>So if you want to be able to live as you choose, make friends and fall in love with whoever you want, and really make a difference in the world at large, come to Hollywood. Just make sure what you do for the movies can be covered up as special effects and be careful in front of the tourists.<br></p>

            <p>No magical celebrities. Unlike most urban fantasy/urban sci-fi settings (Men in Black, Percy Jackson), there is no chance that any famous figures can be magical in America. If they were, they&#39;d be violating the Rap and would be arrested.<br><br>I guess that saves on JKR&#39;s research into the period, at least!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think that the scenario of a magical American celebrity would be possible (not really likely, of course, but still possible), if the MACUSA managed to not get to them until they were already extremely famous. After all, people would notice if a famous person suddenly vanished, and it would likely get way too big to fully cover up. <br><br>That&#39;s pretty much what happened with J.K. Rowling in this headcanon- the Ministry of Magic didn&#39;t notice her until the Harry Potter series was big enough that removing it would lead to people noticing the great big hole where Harry Potter used to be.<br></p>

            <p>Where&#39;d you get the idea for Pure-Majs as a phrase? It&#39;s just occurred to me that it&#39;s a bit weird we never hear about any pureblood-aimed insults (though not all that weird, considering setting and such) but yeah. Also I like &#39;the Rap&#39; as slang for Rappaport&#39;s Law.<br><br>Though I am now a bit worried about the rest of New England... Maybe New York State is basically no one but people who want to stick to the capital for job reasons, and the rest of New England is... wizard-populated, but in little enclaves and no big cities? Like, there&#39;s no real wizarding population in Hartford or Boston, maybe? Hm. <br><br>And, well, Ilvermorny is definitely an ominous presence. Kinda makes me want to write about some muggleborn kid who gets dragged up there, for better or (more likely) worse... </p>

            <p>I was wanting to wait until the last part before commenting on anything, but it looks like everything I wanted to say has already been said.<br><br>...Hmm. And now my brain&#39;s coming up with possible plots for <i>Fantastic Beasts</i>.<br><br>[POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD]<br><br>The official synopsis states thus:<br><br><i>&quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot; opens in 1926 as Newt Scamander has just completed a global excursion to find and document an extraordinary array of magical creatures. Arriving in New York for a brief stopover, he might have come and gone without incident… were it not for a No-Maj (American for Muggle) named Jacob, a misplaced magical case, and the escape of some of Newt&#39;s fantastic beasts, which could spell trouble for both the wizarding and No-Maj worlds.</i><br><br>Now that we have this new information on the strict &#39;no-interaction&#39; policy imposed by the government (to which I say I <i>really</i> hope things aren&#39;t like that in the present), I&#39;m guessing that Newt &amp; co are going to end up on the run from the law while also trying to round up the beasts before 1) Muggles find them and 2) MACUSA hunts down Newt&#39;s rare creatures and kills them to prevent Muggles from finding them.<br><br><a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/a/ac/FB_CoHP_Seraphina.png/revision/latest?cb=20160131014958">President Picquery</a> is indeed slated to make an appearance in the movie, so I&#39;m willing to bet <i>Fantastic Beasts</i> is going to have at least some elements of a political drama as well if she has to deal with the escaped creatures crisis. <br><br>Since <i>Fantastic Beasts</i> is supposed to be a trilogy, I&#39;m hoping we&#39;ll see the eventual desegregation of the magical and nonmagical worlds, especially since this Jacob fellow looks like he&#39;s going to be one of the <a href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/2/29/FantasticBeastsCharactersFirstLook_cropped.png/revision/latest?cb=20160203162634">main characters</a> (far right).</p>

            <p>And if you can believe it, I think we&#39;re being too <b>kind</b> to MACUSA. Take a look at them:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Fantastic1.jpg"><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Fantastic2.jpg"><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Fantastic3.jpg"><br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s President Picquery there. And she does <i>not</i> look like a President.<br><br>That&#39;s not a president&#39;s office - that&#39;s a throne room doing dual service as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Chamber">courtroom</a>, and a courtroom in which there is only one person acting as judge and jury. That decor in the background isn&#39;t the Classical style America has always preferred for its governmental buildings - it&#39;s faux-Gothic, evoking the cathedrals of the Old World. And that&#39;s no uniform of office - that&#39;s a <i>crown</i>.<br><br>She may call herself President, but Picquery is quite clearly Queen and High Priestess of American Magic.<br><br>And I am quite convinced that the film(s?) will not show the reformation of MACUSA - they will show its overthrow and fall.<br><br>And I am <i>right</i> behind that.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Even if it&#39;s set in the 1920&#39;s, something about how hilariously malevolent and evil the magical world keeps ending up as is so amusing. I read something about a Last Stand of Bigfoot. Considering how things went for the Goblins in Europe, and the whole &#39;last stand&#39;, I can imagine it went swimmingly.<br><br>Thank you for the screen shots, hS. They get across the gist of the tone very well. The 40K jokes aren&#39;t too much off with this. I&#39;d like to imagine magical Canada making a bunch of jokes about MACUSA and their dumb name, but I doubt we&#39;d be in a position to do so, given the time.<br><br>I first got hype on this since it mentioned Skin Walkers, which is something of a favorite ghost story of mine. I like reading them on /x/ occasionally, too. Seeing that it&#39;s just some slander is... eeh.  I agree on the part where the film or films would be about the overthrow and fall of Hydra. I mean MACUSA. It&#39;d certainly be a good overarching plot, besides meeting all the cool creatures. I&#39;m still excited for it, of course. Just for a different reason.<br><br>Except the Nundu. Needs 100 wizards to beat it my butt &gt;:( <br></p>

            <p>&quot;Unlike the No-Maj community of the 1920s, MACUSA allowed witches and wizards to drink alcohol. Many critics of this policy pointed out that it made witches and wizards rather conspicuous in cities full of sober No-Majs. However, in one of her rare light-hearted moments, President Picquery was heard to say that being a wizard in America was already hard enough. ‘The Gigglewater’, as she famously told her Chief of Staff, ‘is non-negotiable.’&quot;<br><br>&quot;sober No-Majs&quot;<br><br>Um.

            <p>It says a lot on its own. <br><br>Prohibition was enforced by the government, and the law- while of course there were many who went to speakeasies and such and there were plenty of deaths from alcohol poisoning (the government actually spiked at least once large source of alcohol that wasn&#39;t normally for drinking but they suspected was being imbibed and plenty of people died or went blind or such as a result), generally speaking it was something that was unpopular amongst the men and largely supported by the women who had campaigned for it in the first place. Prohibition was more complex than you&#39;re implying, and being found drunk during Prohibition was indeed something that made someone conspicuous depending on the region. <br><br>What we can take out of this is the fact that MACUSA took such a completely different approach (against the national Muggle government) based on the president&#39;s decision. </p>

            <p>Not to mention, it&#39;s plenty more complicated than you thought it was- remember, the United States was started with a foundation based in puritanism, and these were people who highly looked down upon that sort of thing. The Protestant majority, later on, also weren&#39;t fans; the Prohibition is more complicated than &#39;well the government decided to make alcohol illegal&#39;. The Prohibition was actually pushed into being by the temperance movement, which was largely pushed by women, and by churches as well.   <br><br>There are still many &#39;dry&#39; states, counties, and even cities where buying and selling certain kinds of alochol without the appropriate licenses is illegal, or after certain times or days.<br><br>And as for the denaturing of alcohol, here&#39;s an <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2010/02/the_chemists_war.1.html">article on the matter</a>.</p>

            <p>-The language vaguely suggests that Rappaport&#39;s Law has been rescinded by the present day - it &#39;remained firmly in place&#39; in the &#39;20s, which suggests to me that it would eventually be removed.<br><br>-MACUSA continues to be dictatorial. The term-length of the president appears to have lengthened - Picquery was in office for a decade or more - and her power seems absolute: the <i>president</i> is the one who decided alcohol would be allowed, not MACUSA as a whole. They also have aggressive <s>gun</s> wand control, which is interesting in America.<br><br>-MACUSA are not friends of the natural environment. They apparently executed a genocide against the Sasquatch, and are generally &#39;intolerant... of fantastic creatures&#39;, which smacks of hunting-to-extinction to me. Their apparent concern for White River Monsters seems actually to be concern that the excellent wands made from their spines would run out of raw materials.<br><br>-They&#39;ve also supressed Native American magic. They insist all wizards (witches? Given the structure JKR uses, I&#39;d better switch over) all witches use wands, and their genocidal behaviour towards magical beasts has probably stamped out the nature-focussed magic mentioned earlier for the Natives.<br><br>-They idolised people with Dark magic-attuned wands. Yeah, no way that could <i>possibly</i> go wrong.<br><br>-Different wand-cores! The only wood I see mentioned is swamp mayhaw, which is difficult to pin down the nature of, since it&#39;s only ever paired with rougarou hair.<br><br>-The wandmakers seem to have been based in Arkansas (Quintana), Louisiana (Beauvais), Tennessee (Jonker, home of the Wampus cat legend), and... unknown but possibly Oklahoma/Mississippi (Wolfe, in the current Chocktaw areas). Those are five states which form a continuous block, and suggest that the country&#39;s magical community is actually nowhere near its ostensible centre in New York, but it concentrated around the lower Mississippi river. I see Picquery was from Savannah, Georgia, which continues the theme of &#39;the South&#39;.<br><br>-Despite which, <i>still</i> no mention of black wizards. Um, okay, so oppressive genocidal occasionally-racist government, southern heartland, anti-miscegenation laws... does anyone else get the feeling that MACUSA was an emphatic supporter of the Confederacy during the US Civil War? I see they fought in the Great War <b>from 1914</b>, which means they certainly weren&#39;t fighting on the American side...<br><br>... I hope American wizards has gotten better in the last century. This is really rather depressing.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Maybe the fantastic beasts movie will have some kind of plot point involving the law being loosened?<br><br>Also, you want to hear my INCREDIBLY depressing (to me) headcanon about wizarding society in America? Please do tell me if you see any logical holes in it because I <i>really</i> want this to not work but I can&#39;t get it out  of my head.<br><br><br>..................................<br><br>So, at this point that the stories are being written. We know from previous writing that pureblood wizards were relatively rare in early America, and muggleborns were the majority. And given how purebloods act in Harry Potter, and the massive amounts of antimuggle prejudice, it seems likely that halfblood wizards were an extreme minority. So the only way I can square &#39;massive amounts of distrust towards muggles, including segregation laws and heavy punishments for contacting them&#39; and &#39;muggleborns are probably the majority population&#39; is... Ugh. If the wizarding government, upon finding out a kid has magic, finds the kid, mindwipes family, takes the kid, and hands them over to some wizarding couple to be raised &#39;properly.&#39; This&#39;d even line up with the apparent police state and the crushing of indigenous magic. <br><br>I really don&#39;t want this to work, but I really can&#39;t think of any other way to make this make sense. Well, that or the idea that the MACUSA literally only governs the parts of America that had buildings on them in the 1690s and never expanded, and the rest of America has different laws and considers MACUSA to be a bunch of hysterical creeps (however, they are hysterical creeps who had close ties with the British wizarding world and were there first, so the British pretend that they&#39;re the actual government and don&#39;t recognize whatever the rest of America has and that is why they would teach that Ilvermorny is the primary American school.) This doesn&#39;t really work with the stuff about Louisiana and New Orleans, though.<br><br>Also, Ilvermorny is supposedly the school for North America but it&#39;s governed by American laws. Do Wizarding Canada and Wizarding Mexico not have their own schools? WHY? Does JKR think that the US has a similar relationship to Canada and Mexico as Ireland and Scotland do to Britain?<br><br>Also also, I thought it was just AMERICANS who thought we contributed a lot in WW1. If memory serves, we mostly came in at the end. That doesn&#39;t really mesh with &#39;oh yeah wizard Americans had a lot of victories&#39; unless Wizarding America got involved a lot sooner, which, you kind of need to explain that as well.<br><br>Also x3 combo, I don&#39;t think the thunderbird myths make it very similar to a phoenix. It&#39;s a bird big enough that its wingbeats make thunder and its eyes make lightning. It doesn&#39;t regenerate or heal or have much in common with the phoenix besides &#39;magic bird,&#39; it&#39;s got more to do with the Roc, if you&#39;re going to compare things, right?</p>

            <p>Originally, hiding until Muggles forget that magic exists was an act of humanity. It was apparently the only way to end Muggles killing each other based on wrong accusations of sorcery. Of course people find enough other reasons for killing each other, but witches don’t feel that they cause this behaviour just by existing. <br><br>Over time, keeping the secret became a habit, because dealing with Muggles who don’t understand that magic can’t do everything and who would expect that wizards solve all the world’s problems by simply waving their wands would be too inconvenient. Having to fight a war against paranoid Muggles who want to extinguish magic for refusing to solve the world’s problems – or just for the sake of it – would be even worse, even if they could win. Most witches and wizards can think of a better use for their lifes.<br><br>That’s always been my theory, and I didn’t yet think much about how it might be changed by the news from America.<br><br>Actually, the only explanation we ever got in the books was Hagrid’s answer to Harry’s question: &quot;Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.&quot;<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Aren’t the fortifications mostly against magical enemies, like Voldemort and Grindelwald? Also, did Britains more than a thousand years ago build anything big that didn’t look like a castle (or a cathedral)? I admit that a magical school could exist – and even have a courtyard reflecting the outside weather – in a shack that’s bigger on the inside, but why would they do that?<br><br>Of course most Muggles <i>believed</i> in magic at that time. That was the point. They only stopped believing in magic after they hadn’t seen any obvious magic for several centuries. <br><br> I would like to see this AU too. But AFAIK, witch hunts became worse during the Enlightenment/Renaissance than they had been in the dark ages. (Probably because Europeans during the dark ages believed that god wouldn’t allow witches to do match harm anyway, but when doubt began to spread, they took matters into their own hands.) That’s the reason why the secrecy that had already been prevalent for centuries and may have been local law in diverse places was made an International Statute around 1690 AD.<br><br>Of course all this is eurocentric, I don’t know about other continents.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>OK but my point there was that, if Ilvermorny is counted as an American school (which is up for debate, see downthread) then if it takes in students from Canada and Mexico, and is the ONLY option that they have, then that&#39;s... not good. I know that international schools exist, but usually people choose to go to them; if your only option for magical education is to go to a different country then that doesn&#39;t make sense.<br><br>Also... her placements of the schools really don&#39;t make sense. Just the idea of one school for the entire continent of Africa is absurd - between languistic and political and cultural issues, and the fact that there would be a TON of students, then it&#39;s just illogical. Same issue also exists for the idea that there&#39;s one school for all of Asia or all of South America, while Europe gets three different schools.<br><br>And it&#39;s kind of weird to me that NONE of these schools are in the places where writing developed. There&#39;s no school in Sumeria or Egypt, no school in Mesoamerica, no school in China, nothing in India or Pakistan...  </p>

            <p>Regardless of what Sid Meier would have us think. =]<br><br>Still, I accept your point. It is a bit odd that those places are deserts of magical education... except it&#39;s not. Consider that these are the major schools <i>from the perspective of someone who went to them</i>. The setup, complete with snobbery, reminds me very much of famous universities rather than schools. The man on the Clapham omnibus knows of Harvard and Yale, for instance, but could not for the life of him tell you the name of the most prestigious university of Canada or Mexico.<br><br>The same is likely true of other magical schools, because you don&#39;t need much aside from wizards willing to teach you things to set one up - Hogwarts is basically a law unto itself, since Dumbledore is far more nervous of the Board of Governors than anything Fudge comes up with. Besides, there have to be <i>some</i> schools of magic in these places. The modern geopolitical worldview demands it. If you live in Ethiopia, you&#39;re hardly going to be able to Apparate through at least seven active warzones to take your child to a school in Nigeria (or possibly Burkina Faso, which is a bit further along). It&#39;s a hell of a commute. =]</p>

            <p>Only I mean like the first part, not the rest. ^_^ How much is writing involved in HP magic, anyway? It doesn&#39;t seem to be used in creating them, and the state of wand-making in America shows that wizards seem to have a phobia of writing down how they do things. Given that spells are (according to the wiki) incantation+gesture+intent, all you need to remember is &#39;Avada Kedavra - point - kill&#39;, so it&#39;s not like you need a massive primer. Verbal transmission should work just fine.<br><br>Also: with the exception of China, none of the origins of writing have been consistently &#39;high civilisation&#39;. Hogwarts was founded a thousand years ago, when Britain had just about stabilised from the so-called Dark Ages. Ilvermorny was founded in the early 1700s, when colonial America was stable enough to take it.<br><br>When the Spaniards came to Mesoamerica, or the British to India, or indeed the English, French, and Spanish to North America, the locals wouldn&#39;t be able to sustain a magical school while fighting for their lives.<br><br>Somewhere in Guatemala, I bet there&#39;s an invisible pyramid complex which was once the home of Mesoamerican magic. But it&#39;s gone now, and no-one remembers it was ever there.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>And this narrator is coming from a Western cultural context to which modern audiences still subscribe - the one which measures literacy rates as a means of guestimating a country&#39;s general level of intelligence.<br><br>Compare animism. In animist traditions, particularly in West Africa (with which I am most familiar), it&#39;s the people who <i>make things</i> that have a special connection to knowledge, not the people who write things. Artisans and craftsmen are the possessors of magical knowledge. I could go on about this for hours, but the university library&#39;s in Canterbury and up a hill and also probably shut, so I can&#39;t get Mauss&#39;s <i>General Theory Of Magic</i> out for reference and thus you are all spared my fevered, polemical typedrool. =]<br><br>And I disagree with you on the idea of the Indian subcontinent&#39;s magical schools not surviving, because the idea of India as a monolithic entity is really one of Britain&#39;s own making. The various kingdoms that the Western powers used in their proxy wars would likely not only have kept their magic, but watched it thrive and grow with support (or at the very least bribery) from adventuresome British, French, and Portuguese wizards. Plus everyone else - there was an abortive attempt by the Russians to get into India at one point. Mysore in particular is a promising candidate - if not in the modern city itself, I&#39;d wager you could find a magic school (or what&#39;s left of it) in the old city of Seringapatam. Hyder Ali and the Tipu Sultan were famous for their rocketry, after all, and a little potioneering from the amazingly named Galaxy Market might well have spiced up the Potterverse&#39;s Anglo-Mysorean Wars - but there are other candidates for magical survival, among the Maratha Confederacy and further north, towards the Himalayas.<br><br>As for Mesoamerican magic, well. I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say Guatemala, but, well... if it&#39;s good enough for veterans of the Battle of Yavin, it&#39;s good enough for me. =]</p>

The point is, those eleven are the most renowned schools in the world. There may be others (I can totally see a Healers School in Canada), but they don&#39;t get as much fame as the Big 11. You can think of Hogwarts and Ilvermorny as a parallel to Oxford and Harvard.<br><br>Also, I need to make a correction: Mahōtokoro only accepts students from Japan. It&#39;s the smallest Magic School, with Uagadou being the biggest.<br><br>Which brings our next issue: placement. Hogwarts is, most likely, the second smallest Magic School in the world, and I believe that the area of &quot;influence&quot; is the key point in the size of the school. We didn&#39;t get a proper description of those schools, as far as we know they can be enormous. Big enough to accommodate all students. Wasn&#39;t it Fleur in <i>The Goblet of Fire</i> who said that Hogwarts felt really small to her? Well, if she was hanging around a gigantic Palais de Beauxbatons on the daily basis, I&#39;m not that surprised. That&#39;s like living in a mansion, but then suddenly moving to a log cabin.</p>

            <p>Seriously, except for the mindwiping, this is <i>exactly</i> what the Jedi did under the Old Republic: abduct magical children to raise in their proper environment.<br><br>I think one thing you&#39;ve missed is that the pureblood exodus happened a hundred years before Rappaport Segregation was introduced. That&#39;s a lot of time for Muggleborn kids to start a couple of generations of their own families - and for whatever the term is for non-pure-non-immediately-muggleborn families to expand.<br><br>In fact, let&#39;s run some numbers. Hogwarts has around 1000 students, indicating that every year (of seven) there are roughly 150 magical children born in Britain. That&#39;s out of a total of around 500,000 live births. If we ignore for the moment the post-breeding-age witches and wizards, that suggests that around 1/3000 people in Britain are wizards, or around 20,000.<br><br>So. North America in the 1690s had a non-Native population of 200,000 or so. Assuming we&#39;re looking at the same proportions, that comes out as...<br><br>... uh...<br><br>... nearly 70 witches and wizards in colonial America at the time of the Pureblood exodus and the Salem witch trials.<br><br>... I think JKR may not be very good with numbers.<br><br>hS<br><br>(Is Ilvermorny under MACUSA laws? Not sure what you&#39;re thinking of, here.)</p>

            <p>While it might not mean much because of the Republic&#39;s strong cultural bias in favor of the Jedi, parents of Jedi Hopefuls were always offered the choice to refuse.

            <p>...I was honestly thinking of the Native American/Aboriginal Australian programs but the Jedi also work for the metaphor. And yeah, the hundred years does make a difference, but I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;d affect population dynamics, hm.<br><br>I&#39;ve heard theories that Harry&#39;s year was very unusually small - he was born in the middle of a war, and the Death Eaters certainly don&#39;t seem to have compunctions about killing kids or young adults, so it&#39;d make some sense. Do we know what the amount of incoming students in Harry&#39;s third year was?<br><br>(third year because those kids would&#39;ve been born 2 years after Harry, and therefore roughly 1 year after Voldemort&#39;s death. Hey, it&#39;d make sense if there was a baby boom then...)<br><br>Also JKR has said that she is bad with numbers before. <br><br><br>I THINK Ilvermorny is under MACUSA laws? At least that was the implication I got. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s explicitly stated, but if it isn&#39;t then that raises the question of whose authority it IS under. </p>

            <p>The one that says the school that doesn&#39;t let its students have any contact with the non-magical world (like Hogwarts) isn&#39;t allowed to let its students contact the non-magical world (under Rappaport)? Or the one that says your wand has to be registered? We haven&#39;t really heard about many other laws - just &#39;MACUSA don&#39;t like fantastic animals&#39; and &#39;MACUSA likes booze&#39;. I don&#39;t think they do things legally very often.<br><br>I&#39;m going to try and take another look at the numbers later, under different assumptions. (The HP Wiki gives both &#39;1/10th of the population are magical&#39; and &#39;3000 magic people in Britain&#39;, which... yeah, she&#39;s bad with numbers.) My general feel, though, is that purebloods were a relatively small part of society, so the half-blood/Muggle-descended population wouldn&#39;t be much smaller after they left; that would mean your &#39;most wizards were Muggle-born&#39; image was skewed too far that way. But I honestly don&#39;t know.<br><br>(Seriously, is there a term for a witch whose parents were both Muggle-born? Is that just &#39;half-blood&#39; again, or what?)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Just... the laws in general? I mean, schools usually need to be under the legal jurisdiction of some government, don&#39;t they? I suppose that if Ilvermorny was the school equivalent of international waters that&#39;d be interesting. </p>

            <p>I am reminded that the upcoming <i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</i> film is set during this period, and as such Rappaport&#39;s Law may yet be involved in the plot in some fashion.<br><br>As for the prevalence of Dark magic-attuned wands in a society governed by the collection of squabbling psychos and fascists-in-waiting that MACUSA appears to be (and it can&#39;t be a coincidence that the preferred pronunciation rhymes with a common pronunciation of yakuza), well, what can I say? The wand chooses the wizard, after all. This would also tie in with MACUSA being based in the slave states and being a supporter of the Confederate rebellion; one wonders, for instance, just how literal the title of Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan may turn out to be.<br><br>Yikes, this <i>is</i> dark. Can, can we send them some sort of relief package or something? Oh, sod it. I&#39;m adopting the headcanon that Canada has an enormous population of Native American witches and wizards who are at least third or fourth generation. There&#39;s no <i>basis</i> for it other than the looseness of borders back then, but I&#39;m sick of the history of American magic being one of the Potterverse&#39;s most miserable interludes.</p>

            <p>Because America started out with a much smaller proportion of purebloods, and many more muggleborn wizards. Presumably these proportions stayed the same, since the increased secrecy laws would, I think, keep wizards of any bloodline from immigrating in, right? People went to America stereotypically to escape harsh conditions in their homes, so it seems like immigrating to America would be less popular among wizards than it was among muggles. <br><br>So, with these laws, the amount of halfbloods in wizarding America would drop like a stone, while the amount of purebloods couldn&#39;t really grow and would probably stagnate, right? So muggleborns would be the majority, yet at no point did enough of them go &#39;hey I&#39;d rather not never see or contact my family again&#39; in large enough numbers to get the law changed. <br><br>Actually, considering all the mistrust, it seems pretty likely that muggleborn wizards would have a harder time finding jobs, getting fair treatment in courts of law (probably no right to an attorney or anything, either) and whatnot, because, well, they&#39;re born from nonmagical people, you can&#39;t trust them, can you?

            <p>So apparently my thought process of late has been &#39;science fiction is awesome, and that&#39;s <b>really depressing</b>.<br><br>I won&#39;t copy the entire text across, but in the last couple of months I&#39;ve posted both <a href="http://huinesoron.livejournal.com/139509.html">Only one present made me cry this Christmas</a> and <a href="http://huinesoron.livejournal.com/140607.html">I Got the Wrong Future</a> over on Livejournal. And given that they&#39;re the <i>only</i> things I&#39;ve said (publically, at least) on LJ in that time, the only conclusion is that I&#39;m really miserable.<br><br>So seriously - is this just me? Does anyone else have this reaction? And if you&#39;ve listened to <a href="http://www.sassafrassmusic.com/songs/sci-fi-fantasy-fandom/somebody-will/">the song I talk about</a> (that&#39;s not a Heather Dale link) - or if you have <a href="http://heatherdale.com/product-category/imagineer/">Heather&#39;s album</a> by some fluke chance - what do <i>you</i> think of it?<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: A last-second addition: there&#39;s currently a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBwDmQHEvQ4">video of Heather singing her cover of I.S.S. (Is Somebody Singing?)</a> up on Youtube. It&#39;s a brilliant song covered by a brilliant singer (who also happens to be an alarmingly lovely person), and as a bonus, it&#39;s been overlaid with spaceflight images including what seems to be moonrise from the ISS (at 4:16). I highly recommend everything about it. ~hS</p>

            <p>Summary: Because of a few things, progress has ground to a halt.<br><br>Note: Below is my train of thought that led to this answer. WARNING, may get really strange.<br><br>Who says it will be as good as people make it out to be? I want to believe people can change, but look at the past.. We have gotten so close, yet so far. Well, we do have the internet. 20-ish years ago, we wouldn&#39;t be able to have this discussion. On the flipside, people may be spending too much tine doing this. The future is a very double-edged sword. With all sorts of cool future tech, the rich people would get it first, as they would have all the funds for it. Think about it. All of the cool future tech is coming, but it&#39;s all super expensive. That&#39;s why it is so widespread. Hybrid Cars? Rockets? Lasers? Medicine? Organ Transplants? Another reason that we don&#39;t have future stuff is that the people at the forefront are more concerned with making money from this. Remember Nikola Tesla? The guy who was funding Wardenclyffe Tower stopped because he couldn&#39;t choose who got electricity and who didn&#39;t. (I got that from <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla"><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla">http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla</a></a> by the way. Forgive me if I&#39;m wrong.) After reading that, I just have the feeling that the only real advances come from people who aren&#39;t profit-driven. Look at tech companies today. They release a new model of something every year, raking in tons of money, with their &quot;Improved fuel efficiency, aerodynamicness, Wi-fi included, better loading times, operating systems, larger screens,&quot; and whatnot. I&#39;m not going to say that these things are bad, it&#39;s a double-edged sword, like I said before. The reason I said that I don&#39;t want the future to come, is that  things could get a lot worse before getting better. </p>

            <p>Granted, I have serious doubts if we&#39;ll ever leave the solar system. Simply put, a FTL drive is impossible-- though I would <i>love</i> for someone to prove me wrong. And that&#39;s not even getting into all the other technology we need to make a starship work-- sophisticated life support for long-distance trips, a solution to muscle atrophy in space, power generation, propulsion systems for precision maneuvers, etc, etc. And don&#39;t even get me started on &quot;deflector shields&quot;. The image of a starship going FTL and its hull getting sandpapered to oblivion by a dust cloud is all I&#39;m seeing. Given the fact that the ISS is very much vulnerable to <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/185150-heres-what-space-debris-does-to-the-kevlar-shielding-protecting-the-international-space-station">small pieces of hypersonic debris</a> in Earth orbit, I&#39;d hate to see what happens to a starship that accelerates into anything bigger than a tiny rock. And even then...<br><br><br>But back to the topic at hand: I&#39;ve actually had these thoughts a while back. I was a bit disappointed, sure, but there&#39;s nothing to do about this. Just keep chugging, I guess.</p>

            <p>... a bunch of the harder scifis tend to do things like stick giant ice-shields on the front of their spaceships? Or use magnetic effects, though most of space is non-magnetic, so that&#39;s probably a non-starter.<br><br>What we really need to do is test this out: launch a solar sail or ion probe and monitor it to see how long it takes to die.

            <p>The way I see it? <br>We just haven&#39;t reached it, yet. <br>After all, technology leads to technology. As we invent more stuff, we can invent more stuff faster. <br>About seventeen years ago, Deus Ex featured datacubes as a futuristic sci-fi concept. They were composed of mainly a screen, with a few buttons at the bottom. <br>We now use, on a daily basis, mobile phones - pieces of technology which are literally more advanced than these in every way. <br>The world is changing, and that change is hastening, for better or for worse. <br><br>Wageningen University and Research centre recently grew crops in simulated martian soil. <br><br>The EPFL and SSSA invented a bionic fingertip that differentiates between surfaces with a 96% accuracy. <br><br>In 2012, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre allowed a quadriplegic to eat a chocolate bar with a brain-controlled robotic arm. The BCI was, from what I can tell, invasive, but, it&#39;s something. <br><br>We can hardly forget EVERYTHING from Boston Dynamics, who recently released footage of a new model of their humanoid robot ATLAS, which is stable enough to walk through a snowy forest, catches itself when it starts to fall, and has awareness of its general environment. <br><br>And if you&#39;re afraid you won&#39;t live to see all this stuff, don&#39;t be. The Avatar Project aims for human immortality through brain upload by 2045. <br><br>I&#39;ll be surprised if death is anything but an option by the end of the century. <br>Hell, I&#39;ll be surprised if FLESH is anything but an option by the end of the century. </p>

            <p>It&#39;s painful, too, knowing it&#39;s possible to stand on the moon and look out at the Earth and realize the universe is so, so much bigger than anything you could possibly imagine... and knowing that, because this is no longer third grade, your math and science skills aren&#39;t what you thought they would be and so becoming an astronaut is just completely out of the question.<br><br>But they said I could become anything.

            <p>You wanted a future where we built something to solve our problems? Well, this is it. How do you solve the problem of an autocratic regime suppressing descent in a Middle-Eastern country? Twitter. How do you solve the problem of getting lost? Satellite navigation. How do you solve the problem of global climate change? ... Eh, working on it, but it&#39;s probably gonna work out.<br><br>That&#39;s the thing. I love this future. It&#39;s cool as hell. The sum of human knowledge is literally at our fingertips wherever we go. We&#39;ve killed smallpox <i>and</i> the phenomenon of the pub know-it-all (which admittedly left me out of a job). We got the future where we built machines to solve our problems - they&#39;re just in the palm of our hands, extensions of ourselves, a hive of information that spreads and self-corrects and updates and brings joy.<br><br>There&#39;s a school of thought - I read a paper on it once upon a time - that humans politicked themselves into existence; that our social groups were so complex that becoming dominant required sharper intellect. As far as I&#39;m concerned, we&#39;re still doing that. We speak, and we speak in so many different ways, that now there&#39;s no problem we can&#39;t overcome. I believe that. I genuinely do.<br><br>And if I&#39;m wrong, I don&#39;t care. I&#39;d rather die believing in the essential dignity of the human species than sneer at the ruins and say &quot;I tole &#39;em all no good was gonna come of that, I tole &#39;em, I did&quot;.<br><br>So yeah. We are living in the future. And it&#39;s a good one.</p>

            <p>-LJ is good because there&#39;s already a <a href="http://the_ppc.livejournal.com/profile">PPC LJ community</a> which you can join to make your account easier to find.

It&#39;s basically LJ without the social side.<br><br>-TOS is hosted by Neshomeh these days. She uses Tripod, which I think will need you to know HTML (and it&#39;s also stuffed full of adverts).<br><br>-I used Webs.com, which lets me use HTML... but won&#39;t let anyone <i>else</i>, because they don&#39;t let you open HTML-using accounts any more. It&#39;s good if you want to set up a complete website quite quickly.<br><br>Ehm... y&#39;know, I actually would recommend LJ if you don&#39;t want to set up a (free) website of your own.

            <p>Today I decided to get back into a game I haven&#39;t picked up in a while. I thought some of the people here would be interested, too.<br><br>Kingdom of Loathing is a simple browser RPG. It is riddled with parody (the main currency is meat) and will make a reference at the drop of a hat.<br><br>You play as an adventurer in the island kingdom of Loathing. King Ralph XI has been imprismed inside of a prism by the Naughty Sorceress. You have been tasked with defeating the Naughty Sorceress, freeing the king, and ending the monster infestation of the kingdom.<br><br>You can find the game here: kingdomofloathing.com <br>You can find the very useful game wiki here: kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki<br><br>Happy Adventuring!</p>

            <p>I played this for a while back in . . . 2012ish?  I guess?  It wasn&#39;t a good mix for my OCD brain, since the limited number of plays per day made me feel compelled to play everyday, which I simply don&#39;t have time for.  But it is very amusing, while still being a well-balanced and playable RPG.  (As far as I could tell through the point I played.)<br><br>—doctorlit equips the Bugbear Bumguard</p>

            <p>I have high hopes for this year though, since a year with some actual freaking snowfall put some of the reservoirs back on track. The drought last year was pretty brutal. But, hey, maybe several feet of snow on the Nanum will give us some headway. <br><br>As to grad school . . . <i>I have no idea.</i> I&#39;ve been wildly dithering over three options for the past two months.

            <p>So let me see if I got this straight so far:<br>Each of the constituent countries has their own corresponding demonym: &quot;English,&quot; &quot;Welsh,&quot; &quot;Scottish,&quot; or &quot;(Northern) Irish&quot;.<br><br>And as far as the island of Great Britain is concerned, &quot;Briton&quot; is the more formal demonym, whereas &quot;Brit&quot; is more colloquial.<br><br>Do I have it right so far?<br><br>And if so, then does that mean that I&#39;ve unintentionally been leaving out citizens of Northern Ireland when I&#39;ve been using the term &quot;Brit&quot;? If that is the case, then is there a demonym that encompasses the entire UK?</p>

            <p>There&#39;s actually no commonly-acceptable demonym for England, Wales, and either Ireland. What you&#39;ve listed are the correct adjectives, but the traditional forms of the demonyms are &#39;Englishman&#39;, &#39;Welshman&#39; etc, which for obvious reasons are going out of use. So we&#39;re stuck with &#39;English person&#39; or, well, &#39;Briton&#39;.<br><br>Scotland is a bit different, because you have &#39;Scot&#39;. So a Scot is Scottish and comes from Scotland.<br><br>The concept of &#39;British&#39; (and &#39;Britain&#39; for that matter) is... somewhat under dispute.<br><br>*Does it refer to everyone from the British Isles, thus including the entirety of Ireland? That&#39;s sort of analogous to calling everyone from North America &#39;American&#39; - it&#39;s <i>correct</i>, but you&#39;re going to upset people. (And throw in the fact that &#39;British Isles&#39; only came into use when England conquered Ireland, to try and pull off a retroactive justification... yeah.)<br><br>*Does it mean anyone from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland? I think this is probably the most common usage, but seems to be the least &#39;accurate&#39; version.<br><br>*Does it mean anyone with British (=UK) citizenship, regardless of geographical location? That includes not only people who&#39;ve moved away, but also people from the British Overseas Territories, such as Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands. This one is absolutely and strictly accurate, in that they are officially defined as British by their passports - but is also really confusing, since it means you have multiple Caribbean islands occupied entirely by Britons.<br><br>*Or does it just mean people from the island of Great Britain, thus ignoring the Northern Irish altogether? Well... there&#39;s a bunch of people in Northern Ireland who&#39;d love that! ^_~ And a bunch who&#39;d hate it, because Northern Ireland.<br><br>Who even knows any more?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Thanks for the clarification. Not too long after I made that post, I realized that I had put in the adjectives instead of the demonyms. Thankfully, that didn&#39;t throw you off.<br><br>Well, it seems that I&#39;ll just keep using &quot;Brit&quot; as I have, since that seems to be the most accurate term—though I should also be on the lookout for any Irishmen.<br><br>(Speaking of which, does anyone remember whether the Boarder that goes by &quot;the Irish Samurai&quot; is from Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland?)</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve seen both trailers and I&#39;m frankly not impressed with either of them.  Out of both trailers there was one scene that even caused a smile to creep across my face.  Now part of it is that I cannot stand two of the actresses in it.  I do not like Kristen Wiig or Melissa McCarthy.  I just do not think they are very funny or entertaining.  I&#39;ll still see it, but I do not have very high hopes for this.  I did not going in, and the trailers have done nothing to change that.  </p>

            <p>But it still did not really do it for me.  I will say that Chris Hemsworth does look like he can salvage the film for me.  His few moments in the trailer were the ones I could at least crack a smile at.  I&#39;ll still see it, but I&#39;m not expecting it to be anywhere near as entertaining as the other entries in the series were.</p>

            <p>It does feel like they&#39;ve tried too hard to fit the new characters into the roles of the original four (supernatural enthusiast, thin-faced scientist, black person . . . normalish person?).  But the humor doesn&#39;t seem too terribly off from the originals; <i>Ghostbusters</i> is one of those franchises that gets nostalgia filtered so hard, it&#39;s easy to overlook that some parts were pretty dumb.<br><br>Also, the ghosts are pretty fantastic-looking.  I would guess they&#39;re mostly CGI, but they seem pretty faithful to the style and appearance of the old movies&#39; ghosts.<br><br>—doctorlit&#39;s main complaint is the presence of <i>Inception</i> BWAHs in this trailer.  With no sign of natural predators, humanity may need to start hunting <i>Inception</i> BWAHs to keep their population numbers in check.</p>

            <p>Yes, it&#39;s that time of year again: time for the terrifyingly hilarious Shipficfest, where we all write awful stories shipping each other with... each other. The rules... are simple:<br><br>-If you haven&#39;t already said something, reply in this thread to say if you&#39;re willing to be shipped. If someone doesn&#39;t say they&#39;re okay with it, don&#39;t write anything with them in it. And remember, the earlier you say it&#39;s okay, the more stories get written about you!<br>--With the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12BIzQQZgPZalgXB5tyG9fnG89quFh3jCeWO491e0jCM/edit?usp=sharing">list of ships</a> we already have, it&#39;d be helpful if everyone mentioned posted to say whether they were or weren&#39;t okay with having stories about them. I&#39;ll try to keep the list updated for ease of reference.<br><br>-Suggest any ships you want to. Revenge shipping is absolutely okay (and, indeed, encouraged).<br><br>-Write terrible stories! As <a href="http://freakish_five.webs.com/hSKaitlyn.htm">this example</a> from the first Shipfest shows, the goal is absolutely not to accurately portray other Boarders - it&#39;s to make a ludicrous parody of them. Obviously, you should only write about people who&#39;ve said it&#39;s okay, and should respect any other requests they&#39;ve made.<br>--Good stories are actually okay too, weird though that sounds.<br>--But don&#39;t be creepy. It&#39;s okay to write stories featuring yourself, but... don&#39;t be creepy.<br><br>Some notes:<br><br>-This is for Boarders (or community members in general), not agents.<br>-Let&#39;s not let the ratings drift too high! We&#39;ve said &#39;around PG-13&#39; in the past; either way, remember we have 13-year-olds on the Board.<br>-You&#39;re free to write ships from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12BIzQQZgPZalgXB5tyG9fnG89quFh3jCeWO491e0jCM/edit?usp=sharing">the list</a> - or to come up with your own!<br><br>And yes, we have an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12BIzQQZgPZalgXB5tyG9fnG89quFh3jCeWO491e0jCM/edit?usp=sharing">Official Ship List</a> compiled from the previous thread. As I&#39;ve noted, that&#39;s where I&#39;ll be highlighting people who&#39;ve said they&#39;re okay to be shipped; there&#39;s a list at the end of everyone who&#39;s said anything either way. It&#39;s already nice and long, so you&#39;ve got a good basis to start from. &gt;:D<br><br>(Yes, there will be a sequel to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HGRUq3PE_hFFQoDpo3zs1Co5VSSlpoBOFrTye9uRQxU/pub">Huinesoron&#39;s Very Tedious Day</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VUSgOfuPJjZYILComKRy9dVZOkHWuZHieNHOnuZrDh4/pub">Huinesoron&#39;s Even Tediouser Day</a>, based on the Official List and anything I think is interesting from this thread. Won&#39;t be posted for a while, though, obviously.)<br><br>Let shipping commence!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&#39;Ix! Ix!&#39; <br>Again, the voice from the closet crawled out from under its door and into Iximaz&#39;s ear, running down her spine like a spider down a waterslide. <br><br>She had been writing since last afternoon, and had done it through the night, through her breakfast, past her lunch, and into her next afternoon. <br><br>With her left hand, she was working on the latest PPC adventure of Zeb and the Aviator. With her right, she was writing about her new lighter and softer agent team (she was at the bit where the Earl gets his eyes plucked out,) and with her right foot, she was writing an essay on the emotional importance of rabid, unfounded shipping. <br><br>She was a little disappointed that she hadn&#39;t managed to teach her left foot to write, but nobody was perfect, right? <br><br>After having spent so much time working and writing and scribbling and essay-ing, she had simply concluded that she had gone insane. <br><br>&#39;C&#39;mon, Ix, you&#39;re not insane!&#39;<br><br>Iximaz hmmed in consideration. <br><br>&#39;I promise!&#39; <br><br>She was convinced. <br><br>&#39;Alright,&#39; She said, looking up from her writing desk. &#39;What do you want?&#39; <br><br>&#39;Ix, please, sew us together!&#39; <br><br>Iximaz paused. <br><br>&#39;What?&#39; <br><br>&#39;Imagine, Ix. Imagine if you only needed one costume for all cosplay events.&#39; <br><br>Iximaz imagined it. <br><br><br>&#39;Are you sure about this?&#39; <br><br>&#39;Yes, Ix... Sew it on...&#39; <br><br>Iximaz wasn&#39;t certain how she felt about the idea of a world in which Harry Potter wore a green cloak and had the bright yellowish muzzle of a cartoon pony, amongst other additions, and she was less certain about a world in which it was part of a costume she would have to wear or, at least, explain at some point. <br><br>&#39;Okay, then,&#39; She said. <br><br>&#39;Yes, yes! Drive that needle in...&#39; <br><br>Iximaz shuddered. She never knew her costumes could be so  sultry. <br><br><br>It was another hour of sewing, moaning, and awkward coughing before it was over. <br><br>&#39;Ix, Ix... Thank you.&#39; <br><br>&#39;How do you feel?&#39; <br><br>&#39;I-I feel,&#39; <br><br>It was going to say hot and heavy. Iximaz knew it. <br><br>&#39;Hot and heavy.&#39; <br><br>Iximaz stared at the monstrosity she had created. An eldritch beast of pure, alien origin, the noisome product of a mind diseased and tainted by nothing but madness and hatred, the terrible beast <i>she</i> had made in a fit of passion and insanity. <br><br>&#39;Well, that&#39;s good,&#39; She mumbled, exiting the sewing room. </p>

I&#39;m hopeful, at least.<br><br>...mind you, if this goes on... maybe we could do a Round 2?

            <p>Clara Oswald was tightening the last of the laces on her corset when she felt her TARDIS lurch slightly, as if going over a speedbump. She rolled her eyes, leant out of the wardrobe, and yelled, &quot;Keep it steady, Me! It feels like a rollercoaster in here!&quot;<br><br>Shaking her head and smiling to herself, she turned back to the dress hanging in the centre of the room, a masterpiece of red velvet and lace. &quot;Right, then,&quot; she said, &quot;let&#39;s get-&quot;<br><br>The room spun crazily. The dress tumbled back into the depths of the wardrobe, and it was pure luck that Clara managed to grab onto the doorframe in time to avoid a similar fate. &quot;Me!&quot; She shouted, as the TARDIS whirled around her. &quot;Me! <i>Ashildr!</i>&quot;<br><br>Clara didn&#39;t run up the corridor. That would have been impossible, what with the floor occasionally turning into a wall. But she staggered at top speed, until she emerged from the warren of hallways into the console room.<br><br>&quot;Ashildr!&quot; Her copilot and fellow adventurer was clinging to the frantically vibrating console, staring at it with an expression somewhere between terror and awe. &quot;<i>Ashildr!</i> Don&#39;t just <i>stand</i> there!&quot;<br><br>The TARDIS made a <i>twanging</i> noise, as if it had just bounced off a guitar the size of a solar system (which, the way things were going, it might well have). Clara clung to the doorpost, trying desperately to time her next move. The shuddering of the time capsule rose to a peak, then fell back towards a minimum.<br><br>Clara flung herself towards the console. A sudden jolt threw her to the side; she bounced off a wildly-chiming grandfather clock, found her footing, and dove. Her hand caught the rim of the console, jerking on her shoulder; she pulled herself up past the frozen form of her friend and slapped the emergency cutout.<br><br>The shaking stopped instantly as the TARDIS dropped out of the timestream, floating in null space. Clara got her feet under her, caught her breath - not so easy in a corset that she now realised she had laced a little too tight - and stared at her friend.<br><br>&quot;Ashildr. Me. <i>What were you doing</i>?&quot;<br><br>Her companion (in a purely co-equal manner, of course) was still fixated on the time rotor, now rising and falling slowly in an idle pattern. Clara let go of the console and waved a hand in front of her face. &quot;<i>Me</i>. Look at me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hunh?&quot; The immortal Viking turned her head, finally making eye contact. Her jaw dropped. &quot;Jenna <i>Coleman</i>?&quot;<br><br>Clara blinked. &quot;What?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot;<br><br>Clara guessed that her friend&#39;s blank incomprehension was mirrored on her own face. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said, &quot;so something&#39;s happened to you. Do you know who I am?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes.&quot; Lady Me frowned. &quot;Only no, because that doesn&#39;t make sense.&quot;<br><br>&quot;O-kay.&quot; Clara pursed her lips. &quot;Do you know who <i>you</i> are?&quot;<br><br>Me scoffed. &quot;Of course. I&#39;m Desden-&quot; She caught sight of her own hands and stopped abruptly. &quot;Uh.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Right…&quot; Clara took her friend&#39;s arm gently. &quot;So if I told you you were an immortal half as old as the universe who was currently on the run from, oh, probably everyone, you&#39;d…?&quot;<br><br>Me held her hand up in front of her face, turning it slowly as if studying it. &quot;I&#39;d think I&#39;d gone entirely insane.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay.&quot; Clara closed her eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. &quot;It&#39;s okay, Me. We can fix this. The first thing to do is get your diaries, they might trigger some memory or-&quot;<br><br>Me shook off Clara&#39;s hand and turned to face her. &quot;No,&quot; she said, her voice flat. &quot;I don&#39;t know what this is, but no. My name is Desdendelle; I come from the real world, not the Whoniverse; I am male, not female. I am not Ashildr, this is not a real TARDIS, and you are certainly not Clara Oswald.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So you <i>do</i> remember. Though,&quot; Clara lowered her voice slightly, conspiratorially, &quot;I think you might be right about the insane thing. I didn&#39;t understand half of that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have grown tired of this,&quot; Me said. &quot;I will be leaving now.&quot; She strode over to the console room door - and she really <i>was</i> striding, Clara realised, making her steps significantly longer than normal - and pushed her way through.<br><br>Clara cocked her head, listening. There was a short, strangled squeak from the diner that served her TARDIS as a porch-slash-disguise. Then a long silence. Then a quiet whimper. And then Me walked back in, her hands shaking.<br><br>&quot;We,&quot; she said, pushing the door closed behind her. &quot;We.&quot;<br><br>Clara raised an eyebrow. &quot;We&#39;re suspended in deep space and time, with bizarre temporal nebulae on all sides and no way to convince yourself this is all a fake?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... yes.&quot; Me leant against the door, then shuddered and stepped away from it. &quot;What is going on?&quot;<br><br>&quot;At this point I don&#39;t actually know,&quot; Clara said. &quot;I&#39;m assuming some sort of memory-loss thing - God knows I&#39;ve seen enough of those - but you say you&#39;ve <i>gained</i> memories as well. That means it&#39;s something weird.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I had figured that part out.&quot; Me - or Desdendelle, or whoever she was right now - squeezed her eyes shut, opened them again, then walked back to the TARDIS console. &quot;Very well, then. I believe the logical course of action would be for you to take me to the location where I last remember being. It may be that Ashildr is there in my body, in which case we are one step closer to solving this.&quot;<br><br>Clara tapped her tongue against her teeth thoughtfully. &quot;Okay,&quot; she agreed, &quot;that&#39;s a decent plan. Give me the where and when.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Earth.&quot; Desdendelle chuckled abruptly. &quot;The real one. Israel. There&#39;s an IDF facility-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Whoa.&quot; Clara held up her hands. &quot;You want me to land a TARDIS in the middle of an <i>army base</i>? I&#39;m not the Doctor, you know!&quot; She frowned. &quot;Uh, he&#39;s this-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know who the Doctor is.&quot; Desdendelle drummed her (his?) fingers on the console. &quot;I suppose an American diner would be rather hard to hide. Very well, I have another plan.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is it one that&#39;s less likely to get me shot?&quot; Clara asked. &quot;Because I&#39;m a big fan of not getting shot.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This one is perfectly safe,&quot; Desdendelle assured her. &quot;There is someone we should visit. If a mind-swapping event like this has happened on <i>Doc</i>- uh, has happened before, she will know about it, I am sure.&quot;<br><br>Clara waited, but it seemed her fellow traveller was finished. &quot;O-kay… so that&#39;s all I&#39;m getting?&quot;<br><br>Desdendelle blinked. &quot;I can give you a place and time, of course.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sure you can.&quot; Clara pinched the bridge of her nose. &quot;Ugh. Vague plans, people refusing to tell me everything… it&#39;s like being back with the Doctor again, except he&#39;d have asked why I was standing around in my underwear by now.&quot;<br><br>Desdendelle looked at her. &quot;I assumed you thought of this as an acceptable outfit.&quot;<br><br>Clara waved her hands in front of herself. &quot;Yeah, no-one thinks of corsets as everyday clothes. Well, you did <i>say</i> you were a man… come on, let&#39;s get this thing started.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Or: in which hS tries to write a semi-serious shipfic, realises he&#39;s being way too slow about it, and posts the first third in an effort to force himself to actually finish it.<br><br>Clara is a pain in the neck to characterise; I&#39;m just glad Ashildr&#39;s out of it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It was dark outside. Tomash had stepped away from his computer, if only for a short moment, to take a stroll outside in the night and clear his thoughts. As he was walking along a dimly-lit road, he stopped when he saw a familiar figure.<br><br>&quot;Admin?&quot; he whispered breathlessly. &quot;Is that... is that really you?&quot;<br><br>The man moved closer; even with his body now in the center of the light cast by a street lamp, his face remained in shadow. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said in his deep, rumbling baritone, &quot;it is I, my love.&quot;<br><br>Tomash looked away, a blush rising to his cheeks. &quot;Are we even that, anymore?&quot; he asked, the hurt in his voice clear. <br><br>The Nameless Admin shrugged. &quot;I know it has been far too long, Tomash. And I am sorry. But my love for you has never lessened, not once.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I—&quot; Tomash swallowed. &quot;I... feel the same way.&quot;<br><br>&quot;After all,&quot; the Nameless Admin whispered, caressing Tomash&#39;s face, &quot;administration can be such a... lonely affair...&quot;<br><br>Tomash felt a shiver run down his spine as he looked up at the tall, dark, handsome man standing in front of him. Before he had a chance to stop and think, he was leaning up on tiptoes, kissing his former lover with a passion that suggested they had never been apart to begin with.<br><br>The Nameless Admin broke away and placed his hands on Tomash&#39; shoulders. &quot;Shall we go back to my house and look into some coding issues together?&quot; he said suggestively.<br><br>Tomash smiled and nodded. &quot;It&#39;s like you&#39;re my loop condition,&quot; he whispered, kissing the Nameless Admin once more. &quot;I keep coming back to you.&quot;</p>

            <p>Scapegrace bent a wooden ruler in hand, testing its suppleness.  &quot;So, you&#39;re all here to be taught, are you?&quot;  Some pacing in front of the blackboard was definitely in order.  &quot;Want to learn the fine arts of BDSM, eh?&quot;  The students were sitting rigidly at attention.<br><br>One of the students caught Scape&#39;s eye.  Scape whirled around and pointed the ruler at Cat-on-the-Keyboard.  &quot;Do you think you have what it takes?&quot;<br><br>The student flinched under the sudden scrutiny.  They rallied quickly, though.  &quot;Yes, Senpai!&quot;<br><br>Scape smiled at that.  &quot;A little unorthodox, but I&#39;ll allow it.&quot;  The ruler was lowered and the pacing resumed.  &quot;Under each of your chairs you will find a bag of common supplies.  Cuffs, nylon rope, scissors, etc.  We&#39;re going to talk about how to use them before we start the practical demonstrations. Now, who can tell...Larfen I said we were going to talk about those first!  I guess we&#39;re talking about the importance of scissors until we can manage to get you down from the ceiling.  Not even sure how you managed to get yourself up there.&quot;<br><br>A short while later, Larfen was down from the ceiling and  handcuffed to Ivy-M-Blue, who was tasked with keeping an eye on them.<br><br>&quot;Now, where were we?&quot; asked Scapegrave.  &quot;Oh right.  I was about to introduce you to some important concepts.&quot;  Scape walked to the desk and toggled on an intercom.  &quot;Iximaz, would you please send in the first bugbear?&quot;  =]<br><br><br>((I think that went well for a first class.

            <p>I probably will actually have to take a class or something on all this at some point; it&#39;s not like it gets covered in high school sex ed (no matter how many times you politely ask the teacher to at least acknowledge it exists. . . *sigh* Maybe I&#39;ll retake Health and try again. . .*teenagery angsty stuff ensures*). <br><br>On a completely different note: &quot;Senpai&quot; would be <i>incredibly</i> disrespectful, since it&#39;s used for fellow-students, albeit ones the speaker respects (Larfen J.

            <p>Also known as: &#39;What am I doing with my life?&#39; <br><br>It took only three and a half weeks for them to decide to be married. <br>It was pretty clear that biological melding was out of the question, one of them being a series of withered limbs and flesh locked in a steel suit, and the other one being a mainly theoretical concept. <br>Soul bonding, too, wasn’t possible, because every time they tried it, the resulting philosophical argument locked everyone up, to the point that the shaman had to close up shop for the night and kick them out of his tent. <br>Dramatically and romantically committing suicide definitely wasn’t an option, because Desdendelle’s family didn’t even hate flies, and stock poetry was born from the collective consciousness of human culture, which, in itself, wasn’t known for blood feuds. <br>It struck him like an angry pinball, and dinged and bounced around his skull, knocking things to the floor, shattering vases and making a general mess. <br>‘We should get married!’ He exclaimed. <br>Stock poetry agreed. <br><br>The marriage went smoothly like a pancake. <br>There was Key and Capslock, vehemently denying their irrepressible lusts for each other in the front row; Tomash working on the Nameless Admin’s ‘software’ in the corner; Fasoula passionately caressing a ceramics store just on the other side of the street; Iximaz casually talking up her grilled cheese sandwich, and, of course, Huinesoron, who was still horrifically injured after the Valentine’s day incident, when an anomalously large collection of chocolate and romantic gifts flooded through his front door and broke his arms, his legs, his coccyx, his left pinkie, but, fortunately, not his will to live. <br>They said their vows (well, Des did, anyway, actually possessing a mouth) and rode off into the distance for their honeymoon, which will go unmentioned, except that it involved a replica of the Mona Lisa, two tubs of butter, a fake koala, a real koala, a lot of illegal activities, and a small furred mammal that looked very similar to a koala, but wasn’t. <br><br>They lasted for nine years before it all started falling apart. <br>Des missed his old, carefree days of hooking up with anything remotely Israeli, any person involved with tea, or Huinesoron. <br>Especially Huinesoron. <br>Everybody in every relationship missed hooking up with Huinesoron. <br>Stock poetry was tired of him, too. <br>It was on the eleventh year when she cheated on him with her helicopter instructor. <br>Des knew exactly what was going on, for he was aware that all evil in the world somehow, no matter how indirectly, came from helicopter instructors. <br>He barged into the bedroom, tears flowing from his face like a million clumsy maids in a banana-peeling factory. <br>‘Why, stock poetry?’ <br>‘Dude, am I drunk, or something?’ The helicopter instructor hissed evilly. <br>‘You-you used me!’ <br>‘Damn. Sorry, dude,’ The helicopter instructor growled, blood dripping from his jaws, as he pulled himself off the bed and exited the room, presumably to find a puppy orphanage to burn down with a kick from his flaming foot.<br>&#39;Why? WHHHYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!&#39; Des screamed, using a whole seven exclamation marks, the maniac. <br> <br>And that’s the tragedy of Desdendelle and stock poetry. <br>Desdendelle eventually went on to become a famous musician, and died after an argument involving the future of the band turned violent. Oddly enough, he never had a band – he was a lone singer. <br>Stock poetry enlisted in Vietnam, and was killed by Catullus’ poetry. <br>The helicopter instructor continued teaching people how to drive cars. He also continued lying to everybody. <br>Larfen J. Stocke, esq, did absolutely nothing with his life and officially stopped existing around 2023 after reality decided to replace him with something more useful, like a cockroach. <br>The cockroach eventually grew up to become a helicopter instructor, and had a brief romantic stint with stock poetry. <br>The lamp in the corner of the room continued to be a lamp, though, its secret ambition to become an electric torch never left its mind. <br>The shaman quit his job, tired of arguing with all the couples who wanted soul-bonding, and, also, became a helicopter instructor. <br>This joke continued to do what it did best, until Larfen got tired of it and stopped typing. <br>And, of course, Huinesoron continued to be literally the sexiest thing in existence, and a few things that didn’t. </p>

            <p>I must say, it is a most fine attempt. Metaphorically, allegorically, historically, rhetorically, and categorically, it is proficient and more. I dare say you may have breathed a new life into a genre I have been thoroughly sick of for several months. Try not to let your inspiration show through so obviously, next time, though: it was transparently obvious that you were trying to work through your relationship with your father&#39;s hairdresser. Despite this, I enjoyed it a great deal and look forward to more.</p>

            <p>Larfen J. Stocke, esq./Cat-on-the-Keyboard. This is literally my English homework: sentences using vocabulary words. I might not even bother to change the names before I hand it in. <br><br>I used the Random House dictionary as reference (which can be found <a href="http://www.wordreference.com/definition/">here</a>).<br><br>***<br>To <em>alleviate</em> the dullness of a rainy March, they all decided to write cheesy romance novels featuring each other. Des <em>apprised</em> the others of the fact that one rainy afternoon was not long enough to write an entire novel. Key was undaunted by this, and <em>brazenly</em> asked Larfen J. Stocke, esq. if she could make him the main character. He told her she was <em>cockeyed</em> to make such a suggestion, when the others had already begun writing about Huinesoron.<br><br>“You would not want their <em>diligent</em> efforts to be in vain, would you?” he asked her. Key had wanted to write about him quite badly, and was glaring at him as if she intended to <em>eviscerate</em> him.<br> <br>“I refuse to <em>expunge</em> the idea from my mind,” she whispered, “This story will exist, one way or another.” Key’s whisper had been so gossamer-soft that Larfen J. Stocke, esq. hadn’t even heard her.<br><br>Since no one had gone so far as to issue an <em>interdiction</em> against it, Key curled up in a corner and began working, alone, on her novel: “Lovin’ With Larfen.” The title character’s curiosity eventually got the better of him, and he glanced over Key’s shoulder, hoping her prose would be as <em>mellifluous</em> as her hair, her walk, her voice. . .<br><br>Key’s writing was certainly striking, in a <em> <a href="http://www.wordreference.com/definition/meretricious">meretricious</a></em> sort of way.<br><br>Larfen was charmed, however, and brought her such <em>prodigal</em> amounts of paper flowers that she was quite buried by them.<br><br></p>

(So sorry for causing trouble, by the way.) <br>Also, we&#39;re apparently supposed to say if it&#39;s alright to write stories about us. Despite the fact that I highly doubt this will happen...

            <p>I had an idea. I acted on said idea. <br>...I have ended up writing fan fiction about software, and I enjoyed it. Wow. <br>(This is also the first time the PPC will see my writing, which is stressful, but I&#39;m not going to think about that. Shipfest, right? No stress. *bites nails nervously*)<br>(Also, how does one put italics, bold, underlined, or struck-through font? I am stumped.) <br><br>The PPC Posting Board was huge. That was a fact. It was filled with pages of ideas and thoughts, all tucked away in a pocket of the Internet. The Board had gained limitless information over the years as its Boarders as the chatted and laughed with one another, forming bonds and friendship from their shared interests. They all seemed to care so much for each other.<br>The Board wished to have a friend like its members did, and tried to call out to them. It buzzed and whirred with greetings and kind words, but no one stopped to listen. The Boarders complained that the website was no longer working, and wondered if they needed to find a new Board. In fear, the Board stopped its quest for friendship and continued to watch its inhabitants from afar. <br>It could be lonely, being the PPC Board, though it had never aspired to be anything else. <br>In the middle of March, the Annual PPC Shipfest rolled around again. The Board felt especially dejected around now as it saw the Boarders giggling about silly, impractical fan fiction that featured themselves. Despite the fact that these ships were just for laughs, they demonstrated the friendship between the members of the PPC. They all loved their fellow Boarders and the community they were a part of. The Board stayed quiet as the Boarders had their fun as not to destroy the signal. Once again, the Board wished for a friend. No one could ever understand the electric buzzing of the Board&#39;s language. No one would ever know its longing for someone or something to love.<br>Being a tiny piece of software folded somewhere in the depths of the Internet could be tiring, and it didn&#39;t even have the programming to heave a sigh. <br>&quot;Hello.&quot; It was the voice of a Boarder as they sat down, a smile on their features. The Board was startled. Surely this creature couldn&#39;t be speaking to it? <br>&quot;Hello,&quot; the Board whirred cautiously, and the Boarder grinned in reply. &quot;Are you speaking to me?&quot;<br>&quot;There&#39;s no one else here, silly,&quot; said the Boarder. &quot;Of course I&#39;m talking to you. Or I could be talking to myself, but I don&#39;t do that. Anymore. Unless I have a good reason.&quot; The Boarder chuckled. &quot;The short answer is yes.&quot; <br>The Board beeped to show pleasure. &quot;What brings you here?&quot; it asked, still tentative. After all, this Boarder appeared to be the first of many to speak to the Board directly, and to be scaring them off would not do. <br>Perhaps this Boarder could be its friend. <br>&quot;Board-om,&quot; the Boarder replied, then cracked up. When the Board fell silent, the human&#39;s laughter slowly died away. &quot;Don&#39;t you see? Board-om. Because you&#39;re the Board, and I&#39;m bored. Get it?&quot; <br>&quot;I do not comprehend the concept of amusement,&quot; said the Board slowly. &quot;It is not in my programming.&quot;<br>The Boarder frowned, and the Board buzzed a few binary bytes of code. &quot;Oh.&quot; <br>&quot;Is this disappointment? I have become adept at recognising emotions.&quot;<br>The Boarder repeated their little chuckle and the Board saved the soundbyte into its archives. &quot;I guess. It&#39;s okay, though, since you&#39;re... You know...&quot; <br>&quot;I am afraid that I do not understand what you are referencing,&quot; the Board whirred. &quot;Can you explain?&quot;<br>&quot;I mean, you don&#39;t have feelings or anything,&quot; mumbled the Boarder. &quot;I kind of thought you would, but I dunno why.&quot; <br>&quot;I have feelings,&quot; the Board replied eagerly, wishing not to disappoint its new acquaintance again. &quot;I feel loneliness. I am tired, and I can be upset. They cause mind-fuzz on the Internet.&quot;<br>&quot;You mean lag?&quot; the Boarder asked with that soundbyte giggle, scrunching up their nose. &quot;The website gets laggy when you&#39;re sad?&quot; <br>&quot;I suppose so.&quot;<br>The Board and the Boarder sat there for a while, exchanging messages with one another. &quot;I have to go,&quot; the Boarder said suddenly, apology written on their face. &quot;Mum says. I&#39;ll be back tomorrow!&quot; <br>&quot;I will see you then,&quot; the Board replied evenly. The software feels something distinctly uplifting at this promise. <br>The Board runs quickly and efficiently that night. <br>Somehow, the Board fulfilled its promise that it could, in fact, feel. It fell in love with its Boarder, the Boarder who had become its friend. For some reason, the Boarder returned the sentiments, and the Board had never imagined an idea as frivolous and yet beautiful as this. <br>The other PPC&#39;ers say that sometimes, late at night, when no one has been on the Board in a while, one can see 8-bit figures laughing, talking, and dancing in the 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s of the Board.<br><br></p>

To italicize, put &lt; i &gt; before the word and &lt; /i &gt; after, only remove the spaces (the pointy brackets are also right next to the word, like so: &lt; i&gt;Ship&lt; /i &gt;). It&#39;s the same for all the others, only replace &quot;i&quot; with &quot;b,&quot; &quot;u,&quot; and &quot;s,&quot; respectively. Make sure to always preview your post when you use these; if you forget your &quot;/&quot; before the second letter, all of the text afterwards will be italicized or otherwise changed.   <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Neshomesh swings back and forth on the hanging tyre, giggling softly to herself. Her dark hair has been pulled up into two bunches that it isn&#39;t quite long enough to carry off; her blue sundress can accurately be described as &#39;well-loved&#39;. To a casual glance, she looks like a child of perhaps six years; closer inspection notes the largeness of her eyes, the slightly vulpine tinge to her nose.<br><br>The mini-Boarder drops to the dewy grass, landingly lightly. She snatches up a ball and bounces it off the tree-trunk, her grin widening as she catches it on the rebound. Then off she skips, tossing the ball from hand to hand as she makes her way down to the riverbank.<br><br>The river is clean and cool. Neshomesh finds her favourite spot and settles down on the warm rock, smiling in the sunlight. She plucks a flattish pebble from the sand, weighs it in her tiny hand, then skims it out across the water. The ripples it leaves behind catch the light, like a shoal of silvery fish.<br><br>Neshomesh lies back on the rock and closes her eyes. There is nothing to disturb the contented mini, here in her own world: nothing but the babbling of the river, and the distant sound of birdsong.<br><br>&quot;Yub? Yub-yub?&quot;<br><br>Neshomesh sits up, rubbing her eyes as if sleepy. &quot;Eee?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yub!&quot;<br><br>Something wobbles at the top of the bank, then loses its balance and tumbles down through the grass. It bounces as it reaches the beach, flips through the air, then comes down with a poof of sand. It looks like nothing more than a ball of fluff, marbled in light and dark brown.<br><br>&quot;Eee!&quot; Neshomesh launches from her rock with a laugh and skips across the sand. She stops just short of the new arrival and peers at it. &quot;Eee?&quot;<br><br>The ball of fur doesn&#39;t react. Neshomesh&#39;s brow furrows. Then she bends down to grab a stick from the sand beside her. Leaning forward, she pokes the new arrival lightly. &quot;Eee?&quot;<br><br>The fluffy visitor stirs. A head pokes out: little black nose, large round eyes, and two fuzzy ears. &quot;Yub?&quot;<br><br>Neshomesh giggles and waves at the furry creature. &quot;Eee!&quot;<br><br>The creature stands up, revealing itself to be of a height with Neshomesh. If you took a teddy bear, packed it with extra stuffing, then let its fur grow out as long as it could, you would be able to achieve much the same effect. It wears a hand-knitted black scarf around its neck, to which is pinned a small label reading &#39;Huniesoron&#39;.<br><br>&quot;Eee!&quot; Neshomesh drops her stick, beaming at the other mini. She spreads her arms wide. &quot;Eee?&quot;<br><br>Huniesoron looks at her and smiles timidly. Conscientiously, he brushes the sand out of his fur, then opens his own arms. &quot;Yub-yub?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Eeeeee!&quot; Neshomesh throws herself forward, wrapping her arms tightly around the Ewok-like mini. She snuggles close, feeling the softness off his fur against her cheek. &quot;Eee?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yub.&quot; Huniesoron enfolds her in his arms, cuddling her close under the warm sun. &quot;Yub-yub.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Eee...&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>I apologize in advance for how weird this is. Sorry I&#39;m not sorry.<br><br>Mattman the Comet flew down to the Earth on his magical shooting star. Upon landing, he was noticed by none other than Luxury. As soon as she saw the fabulous space man in is fancy space suit, she charged him and attempted to rip his clothes off. The space suit was torn to shreds before Mattman even realized what was going on. To Luxury&#39;s disappointment, Mattman was still wearing his hazmat suit, which prevented her from taking him right there, but that didn&#39;t stop her. She tore that off too, leaving him somewhat exposed in only his extremely tight wet suit  complete with snorkel. Longing for his luscious lips, she   ripped the snorkel from his head and kissed him while working on removing the rest of his scuba gear. At this point, Mattman was becoming panicked, as Luxury&#39;s persistence never lessened, and his layers were becoming lesser by the second. It was then that he realized that only his normal clothes remained, and he tried to make a run for it. Luxury clung on to him for dear life as he made his escape, pulling the rest of his clothes off along the way. It was the metal underwear that saved Mattman, as it was too smooth for even Luxury&#39;s experienced hands to grip. She finally released him, defeated, and watched Mattman run off into the sunset wearing nothing but his titghty shinies.</p>

            <p>(This is in the vein of Des/Tea; hopefully, I&#39;m not paying so close a homage that it becomes ripping-off.)<br><br>&quot;Hey Ixi, do you want--&quot; Alleb paused in the doorway to Iximaz&#39;s lair. It was utterly pitch-black, except for one square of light, which was partially obstructed by Iximaz&#39;s head. The only sound was the mouse and keyboard, and Iximaz muttering to herself. <br><br>&quot;Uh, Ixi?&quot; Alleb repeated, knocking on the doorpost. &quot;Can I come in? I have some pizza rolls, if you want any...&quot;<br><br>Ixi didn&#39;t look away from her screen, but mumbled, &quot;Yeah, sure, sure....&quot;<br><br>Stepping uncertainly about discarded Mountain Dew bottles and chip bags, Alleb made her way to her friend&#39;s computer desk. She held out the small plate of hot pizza rolls for a moment, but Iximaz made no move to take it, so she set it on the desk.<br><br>&quot;Um, Ixi?&quot; Alleb said. &quot;When&#39;s the last time you were outside?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Outside?&quot; Iximaz asked, cocking her head and sparing a quick glance at Alleb, her eyes still reflecting the graphics on her computer. &quot;I haven&#39;t left this dungeon for--&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, I mean <i>outside</i>,&quot; Alleb interrupted, gesturing to the boarded up windows. &quot;You know it&#39;s spring, right? Vitamin D is essential for your health.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz muttered something noncommittal, still staring at her monitor. <br><br>Alleb grunted. &quot;You <i>have</i> to leave the house sometime, Ixi. It&#39;s not healthy to play that game so much.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; Iximaz whispered. Alleb felt a moment of relief, but then Iximaz ran an oddly tender hand down the side of her computer. &quot;<i>World of Warcraft</i> is all I need.&quot; She continued to whisper to her computer; Alleb couldn&#39;t make out what she was saying. Eyes a little wide, she backed out of the room, closing the door behind her. The last thing she saw was Iximaz leaning towards the monitor.<br><br>&quot;That kid needs some fresh air,&quot; she said, shaking her head and walking back to the kitchen. &quot;Maybe I can buy some in a can...&quot;<br><br><br>Couldn&#39;t resist. ^_^ <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Iximaz gazed longingly at the beauty in front of her. With cold beads of water slowly sliding down it&#39;s sides, nothing could compare to her lover. She sipped at the juice inside, longing for even more, yet knowing that this was all she could have. &quot;Oh lemonade, people are nothing compared to your delectable taste,&quot; she moaned, &quot;If only there were more of you in my fridge, then I might finally be fully satisfied.&quot; She sipped the rest of the beverage until only the ice cubes remained.

            <p>&quot;My love,&quot; Desdendelle cried, &quot;my sweetest joy, come down from your tower and be with me once more, I beg of you!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Get bent, leaf boy!&quot;<br><br>He flinched at that; the name still stung with memories of how she&#39;d found him, that one evening when he and the packet of Lapsang Souchong had been having a sweet, smoky moment. &quot;My darling, my heart is big enough for you and any boiled vegetable products! You don&#39;t come second in my affections to the joys of diced and dried-up botanicals! Let me prove it to you, I beg of you!&quot;<br><br>&quot;No! Screw you!

Oh, to hell with it! My darling Desdendelle, what a fool I have been! What a jealous, hypocritical fool! When I saw you in the embrace with that... rather delightful brew, I ran to the arms of another! I fell for the gooey, dairy, gluten-free embrace of a grilled cheese sandwich! Oh, come up and kiss me!&quot;<br><br>Desdendelle was already hurtling up the stairs of the tower. Then he stopped and thought for a moment.<br><br>&quot;My love, did you actually lock the door?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, no, that would hardly have been fair, would it?&quot;<br><br>Desdendelle sighed and ran the rest of the way up the stairs.<br><br>---<br><br>&quot;Hi.

            <p>A sequel to last year&#39;s <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=270307">Lacing</a>. Warnings: nothing sexually explicit, but there is light BDSM involved. Hopefully this is okay.<br><br>---<br><br>The sun had gone in about half an hour ago, and the last embers of the sunset were clinging to the sky. Iximaz had watched, and wanted to keep watching, but one look from Kaitlyn - nothing more than a glance, nothing more than what was needed - had told her not to. She came inside, three paces behind the elf, back straight, head high, a pose that no longer required a posture bar.<br><br>It had been a year. How had it been a year? A year since she&#39;d been taken into the arms of Kaitlyn, her mentor and Permission Giver and so much more besides. Her mind dwelled on this as her Mistress&#39;s instructions washed over her. She stripped, held her arms up, presented herself, but all the time wondered what might be on the horizon.<br><br>&quot;Something special,&quot; said Kaitlyn, and the uncanny nature of her remark jolted Iximaz from her reverie. &quot;Something special for tonight.&quot;<br><br>&quot;For-&quot; Iximaz hesitated, her eyes wide. &quot;For a good girl?&quot;<br><br>&quot;For <i>my</i> good girl,&quot; her Mistress replied, turning away from a steamer trunk to face her. &quot;I&#39;ll dress you now, I think. I want you to be looking your best, my beautiful, beautiful girl.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn approached with long ropes of silk so red they were almost black, and a lump formed in Iximaz&#39;s throat. As Kaitlyn&#39;s body pressed against her, the heat rushing through her veins and short-circuiting important bits of her brain, she did as she was told and the ropes began to be tied. First, the chest harness was completed, then Kaitlyn&#39;s gloved fingers trailed down the length of Iximaz&#39;s arm, the signal for them to drop.<br><br>&quot;You don&#39;t need to hold your arms in place for this, sweetheart,&quot; whispered the Mistress into Iximaz&#39;s ear, her body heat and gentle touches sending lightning bolts through her brain. &quot;Let me guide my girl.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, Mistress.&quot;<br><br>What else could have been said?<br><br>The long, red ropes began to twist and tighten around Iximaz&#39;s slender chest, the strength of the bindings squeezing the breath from her lungs in delicate gasps. She kept her eyes looking straight ahead, when her Mistress&#39;s electric touch didn&#39;t make them flutter shut as she sighed with pleasure. She didn&#39;t look down. She couldn&#39;t have even if she wanted to.<br><br>She hadn&#39;t heard the laughter of others in her head for months now, gentle love and sensual play drawing her out of the darkness of her anxiety and into that last summer, where the grass grew long and was soft as down beneath dancing human and elvish feet. She was loved, and in love, and her Mistress&#39;s murmured words in her ear as the ropes pulled tauter and tauter made her relax into the warmth of it all. So relaxed was she that she almost didn&#39;t notice when her Mistress stepped away, and she only began to wake up when Kaitlyn took her hand and led her to the mirror.<br><br>&quot;I...&quot; She looked <i>beautiful</i>, the red silk forming a tight underbust corset, her breathing slow and steady, but not restricted. Mixed in with the dark rope - and Iximaz didn&#39;t even know how her Mistress had done it at all, let alone without her noticing - were delicate white flower shining like stars on a midsummer&#39;s night. The young girl knew without thinking that they were simbelmynë, and meant forever. Her long, dark hair had been braided into the top of the harness as well, but it did not bite or pull at her, and the flowers had risen up to crown her. &quot;Mistress, I-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Come,&quot; she said, and held out her hand for Iximaz to take. &quot;There is one more thing that needs to be done, now that you are perfect.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz followed her, pride swelling in her chest and making her smile ever wider. Upon opening the door she saw the couple&#39;s friends and flashed a grin back at them - a year ago, she would have bolted. The group had gathered around a little cushion of white and gold, and at her Mistress&#39;s direction she knelt.<br><br>&quot;You have come so far, my girl. You have only been mine for a year and it feels like twenty more. If you will bind yourself to me, if you will love me and let me love you... then kneel.&quot;<br><br>Suddenly aware that all her friends were watching, heart beating fast with excitement, Iximaz knelt.<br><br>And Kaitlyn&#39;s simple gold collar wrapped around her neck, and shut with a click.</p>

            <p>That is certainly a sequel to last time (and then some).<br><br>I think you&#39;ve expertly carried forward the feel of the last story, and improved on it. And you&#39;ve done what a sequel should do - take the story somewhere new that still builds on the original.<br><br>Well done.

            <p>I admit, there... was some salt on my end when people left it alone, but at least part of that was me deciding not to list it as a shipfic in the title for some reason. Like with last year&#39;s story, it was something I tried really hard to make good without it descending into a boring, bawdy romp that you can find anywhere on FetLife or the like.<br><br>I also wanted to do a D/s relationship <i>right</i>, which is a particular bugbear of mine when it shows up in badfic and original work. People tend to assume that the only kinky relationships that exist are the 24/7 ones where the sub is a pathetic, mewling figure totally in awe of their dom or domme. Don&#39;t get me wrong, there are relationships like that, 24/7 M/s is a thing... but they aren&#39;t the rule. I wanted to show the positive side of a D/s relationship, wherein a sub who has social anxiety issues and generally low self-esteem has it proven to them through love, care, and instruction that they both have value and don&#39;t need to seek it through the direct approval of other people.<br><br>Indeed, the only thing I haven&#39;t done in this? Rope work. I have a real complex about being tied up, which is <i>another</i> thing people get wrong about BDSM. It&#39;s not solely about being handcuffed to the bed or tied in an incredibly elaborate suspension rig (which, btw, are generally depicted in an unsafe manner because where the hell are their scissors?), because not every sub or dom/me likes tied up or physical restraint. Hell, my collar is a chunky necklace because restrictive clothing around my neck makes me freak out completely.<br><br>I wanted to work on a story that shows BDSM in a positive and, well, realistic way, elf domme weaving flowers from Middle-earth into a corset tie aside. So I&#39;m glad you liked it, and I&#39;m glad I succeeded. It... means a lot to have people in a group like this say they like my work, and have them like it for the right reasons.<br><br>=]</p>

            <p>(I don&#39;t know about the others, but my lack of response was due to the fact that I&#39;m behind on homework and have been trying to check the board less often. Key word there being &quot;trying.&quot;)<br><br>To start off with, I am prejudiced in favor of this fic because I adamantly believe that the world needs more BDSM fluff. But even without that, this is good. I like how you don&#39;t try to fill in everything that&#39;s happened in the year they&#39;ve been together. Just little hints, like the flower (I like to think that it&#39;s &quot;their thing,&quot; and that&#39;s why she recognized it so immediately) and the references to Iximax&#39;s anxiety. And I second everything Phobos said. Good description and all. The details you included were so perfectly chosen. It was simultaneously understated and lavish, like velvet. I felt like I could imagine everything that was happening to the characters perfectly. Even though you didn&#39;t mention it, I&#39;m sure I know how the room smelled. From every single character&#39;s perspective. This is beautiful and I would recommend it to everyone I know except for the small fact that it&#39;s a BDSM RPF about people my friends have never heard of and I have enough of a reputation as a weirdo already. </p>

            <p>But I rather enjoyed this story.  It&#39;s probably not what people were expecting, which may account for the lack of response.<br><br>That said, your descriptions are awesome and I really enjoyed the perspective.  The descriptions of the rope work (Japanese Bondage?) were especially well done.

            <p>Primarily because doing another straight corset scene like last year&#39;s felt a bit like treading water. I wanted to show progress and, well, being collared is a Really Big Deal in the BDSM world. A corset tie worked for me because it gave a sense of progression in their relationship, giving the submissive more confidence and implying she&#39;s come out of her shell a lot more.<br><br>Which, well.

            <p>In order to flex my Shipfest muscles (Translation: this is my first attempt at anything Shipfest. Therefore, it will probably not be that great) I present to you: Whatever This Is. (You have no idea how many times I had to look away from the screen and laugh out the hysterics I got from attempting this. The Shipfest is so weird.)<br><br><br><br>Iximaz stood outside of her boss&#39;s impressive oak door, nervously gripping her script. That script was the pinnacle of her career— the evidence of her arduous journey from fan to fanwriter. It symbolized a mountain of effort, gallons of tears, and maybe a small amount of blood. It was her ticket to a better life, her exit from anonymity, her entrance to stardom. It was her everything. And today... it was going to be evaluated.<br><br>The door opened. Iximaz sucked in a breath. It was a blonde-bunned secretary. &quot;The boss will see you now,&quot; she said, opening the door a little wider. Iximaz&#39;s heart rate skyrocketed, but she forced herself to walk forward, heels clicking on the hardwood. The office was dark, lit mostly by moody candles that flickered in her passing. It was a large room, circular, and at its center was an expansive (and expensive) oak desk, outlined by a circle of stage lighting. The boss had a flare for the dramatic. <br><br>“Sir,” Iximaz said respectfully. She couldn’t keep from staring at the elf behind the desk. Huinesoron, the head of the Shipping Company, was… much more handsome than she had been lead to believe. He was dressed in a black three-piece suit, coat on the top of his desk and white sleeves rolled to his elbows. He waved her in without looking up from another script on his desk. <br><br>“Hand it over,” he said. “I have three other budding masterpieces to shred today.”<br><br>Iximaz gulped, convulsively gripping her script. “I— I don’t think you should dismiss it so quickly,” she said, then bit her lip. What was she saying!? This was the head of the Shipping Company she was talking to! <br><br>That made him pause. He looked up slowly, eyes narrowed. “Hum. We’ll see. Give it here.” He held out a hand. <br><br>After taking a deep breath, Iximaz handed over the script, then began to turn. Shockingly, Huinesoron flipped open to the first page and began reading. That was most irregular— usually, he read the scripts, then sent a review. Why would he do this in person? Iximaz began chewing her lip. “<i>Desdendelle stared deeply into Kaitlyn’s eyes.</i> Really? That’s how you’re starting it? Oh, very well. ‘<i>I could look at you all day,’ he says, brushing her lips with a kiss. She pulls him in—</i> is this honestly the best you can do?” Huinesoron looked up indignantly. “I’ve seen elementary school plays more original.”<br><br>“I— I’m sorry, sir, I thought—”<br><br>hS cut her off with a sharp hand gesture, dark eyes shadowed in the candlelight, strong jaw set. “Never mind. Let’s keep going. I might as well skip this first bit; hardly any dialogue.” He flipped forward a few pages while Iximaz waited pensively, trying not to run out of the room. This was her life he was holding, all of her work. And he didn’t like it. Huinesoron’s Shipping Company had a complete monopoly on Shipfest productions— if he didn’t take her script, well, it just wouldn’t be made. End of story. <br><br>“<i>Kaitlyn and Desdendelle walk hand in hand down the beach. ‘I love it this time of year,’ Des says. ‘So peaceful; hardly any people. Would you like some tea?’ ‘No,’ says Kaitlyn, glancing down shyly, then looking into his eyes. ‘I would like some of you, though.’ She kisses him, the setting sun framing them.</i>” hS stood so quickly his chair toppled backwards. He strode angrily around his desk and stopped mere inches from Iximaz, leaning over her. Iximaz barely contained a frightened yelp. “Do you honestly think this is good enough for the Shipfest?” he said softly, shaking the script in one hand. <br><br>“I— I’d thought it was,” Iximaz said. It sounded like a poor excuse, even to her. “Is, is it not?”<br><br>hS only laughed. Iximaz could feel his breath on her face; it smelled lovely, actually. “No,” he said.<br><br>Iximaz felt her heart sink right to her toes. She began to sag, tears coming to her eyes. “Oh,” she said, blinking rapidly. <i>Can’t let him see me cry,</i> she thought. <br><br>hS looked at her with an unreadable expression. “If you want,” he said, tilting his head. “We might try working on something for the Shipfest… together.”<br><br>“What?” Iximaz asked. Suddenly, she was hyper-conscious of how close he was; his hand brushed hers, and she almost jumped.<br><br>“You know, you’re rather beautiful, Iximaz,” he said, leaning in. Suddenly, he was kissing her. Iximaz’s squeak of surprise was cut off as he wrapped her in his arms, kissing her deeply.  <br><br>“What are you doing?” she asked him softly when he pulled away for air. <br><br>hS smirked. “Making something worthy of the Shipfest,” he said.<br><br><br><br>That was the strangest thing I’ve ever written. Hopefully you all like it! <br><br>-Alleb, who now has to shake the horrible fear that hS and Ixi will never look at her the same way again</p>

            <p>hS walked through the corridors, his vest festooned with his many badges.  He carried a bag that jingled with the promise of more shinies for other people to acquire.<br><br>His attention was drawn to sounds coming from a partially open door to his left.  Peeking through the crack he spied what could best be described as &quot;Mattfest&quot;.  Mattman the Comet and Matt Cypher were too preoccupied to notice when hS walked into the room and tried to get their attention.

He pressed one each into their hands and moved on.<br><br>The next room he come across was occupied by Tomash and the Nameless Admin.  hS was taken aback by how shadowy and mysterious the Admin was, and how limber.  Badges were distributed and it was time to head out again.<br><br>hS had time for one more stop.  He found a likely room and invited himself in.  He was greeted by a pile of writhing limbs.  This definitely deserved some badges, but he had to figure out what was in there, first.<br><br>&quot;Oy, you lot!&quot; he called.  &quot;No, no, don&#39;t stop on my account.  Just raise your...well...whatever you can raise at the moment, when I call your name.  I see Scapegrace?  Hello, Scape. Is that PoorCynic you&#39;ve got there?  Good to see you, mate.  I note...Kaitlyn?  Having fun dear?  Excellent.  Behind her is...Iximaz, you can&#39;t get duplicate badges, I&#39;m afraid.  Desdendelle is that Hieronymus Graubart to your left?

            <p>Huinesoron was walking. <br><br>He enjoyed walking. The worst thing that could happen when you went walking was probably a dragon attack, and everyone, especially the dragons, knew that dragons didn&#39;t exist. <br><br>Something crept up on him. <br>Something dark and primeval, that dwelt in the dark places in his brain and told him things like &#39;Don&#39;t eat glass,&#39; and &#39;Don&#39;t touch fire,&#39; and &#39;Don&#39;t bloody eat glass, you idiot!&#39; and &#39;Don&#39;t walk in that dark alleyway,&#39; and &#39;Spit the glass shards out, you ponce! I can&#39;t believe you ate it!&#39; and &#39;Oh, my God, you&#39;re bleeding, you idiot!&#39; and so on and so forth. <br>It told him to look to the right. <br><br>There were three people, and he recognised all of them. <br>Mattman the Comet, Matt Cipher, and eatpraylove. <br>He recognised the looks on their faces, too. <br>Flashbacks broke into his head like Vietnam era helicopters. A shudder ran down his bones, and caressed his skull with the care of an ogre masseuse. His stare went far, far past a thousand yards, as the memories dug their way out of his mind.  <br>Sweat broke out, as a single word rung through his skull.<br>Tedious. <br><br>&#39;I&#39;m married, you know,&#39; He whimpered, suddenly wishing that he was being attacked by a dragon, as they untangled themselves (mostly) and approached. <br><br>~<br><br>Welcome to the bloodbath, brother. <br>I hope you brought soap. </p>

            <p>Scapegrace crouched behind the table, utterly silent, utterly still. She&#39;d been tracking her quarry for hours now, and for the first time she thought she saw an opening to catch it.

What do you sink you are doing? Are you une personne crazy?!&quot;<br><br>Scapegrace stumbled back, gaping at the irate-looking candlestick with the extremely feminine, extremely <i>bad</i> French accent. &quot;Uh,&quot; she managed. &quot;What?&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;ere I am, just walking along and mahndin&#39; mah own business, when SUDDENEMENT! Zere is you, <i>leaping</i> out of nowherre to mo<i>lest</i> moi?&quot; The candlestick folded her arms and glared. &quot;It is simply <i>not</i> on, ma friend, not on at all!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh.&quot; Scapegrace pinched herself to check if she was really awake. &quot;Ow.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah am <i>waiting</i> for an <i>apology</i>.&quot;<br><br>Scapegrace blinked. &quot;What, like this is <i>my</i> fault? I thought you were a Pokemon!&quot;<br><br>The candlestick stared at her. &quot;And… porquoi, precisely?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well…&quot; Scapegrace waved a hand vaguely. &quot;You look kind of like a shiny Chandelure, you know? With the… candles and all.&quot;<br><br>The candlestick&#39;s expression fell into a glower. &quot;Zat is <i>not</i> mah fault,&quot; she declared. &quot;&#39;ad SeaTurtle not trranslated ma name as &#39;Lumiere d&#39;Aube&#39;, ah would not be <i>ztuck</i> this way.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh.&quot; Scapegrace shook her head, irritated by her own hesitancy. &quot;So who are you normally?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah am <i>DawnFire</i>, no?&quot; The candlestick hopped forward, waving what would be called a hand were it not, in fact, a lit candle. &quot;Take mah advice, mah amie - never allow anyone to ship you like a Frrench girl.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know why I ever would.&quot; Scapegrace regarded DawnFire for a moment longer, then shrugged. &quot;So <i>have</i> you seen any Pokemon around here? I need to catch them to give out as newbie gifts, but between you and SkarmorySilver, it&#39;s been tough going…&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah &#39;ave not.&quot; DawnFire looked at Scapegrace warily. &quot;But if you are &#39;unting for Pokemon, why are you not using ze Pokeballs?&quot;<br><br>Scapegrace looked down at the rope in her hands. &quot;Uh.&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;oping for a little, &#39;ow do you say, light bondage, <i>n&#39;est pas</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Y- n- I refuse to confirm or deny any such allegations.&quot;<br><br>Zat is prrecisely what ah would expect you to say.&quot; DawnFire hopped up onto a convenient box, then further up onto a table, and stood eye-to-eye with Scapegrace. &quot;You realise zat I am a moderately ornate candlestick right now, non? While zere are possibilities in &#39;ot wax, ah am not remotely suited to errotic activities rright now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know, I know.&quot; Scapegrace waved the discussion off. &quot;Forget I said anything.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You didn&#39;t say anyzing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then forget I <i>didn&#39;t</i> say anything.&quot;<br><br><hr>

Moved old claims from Storme Hawk, Miah, Snowy the Sane Fangirl, Neshomeh (probably), and Sjosten to Unclaimed; also did so for undated claims from various folks.<br>2. Updated the Claimed list to match the changes I made in the first cleanup.<br>3. Got rid of any stray old or undated entries on Unclaimed.<br>4. Added a late entry for one of my upcoming missions to the Claimed list.<br>5. Got rid of some entries I &quot;reestablished&quot; last time, including all three How to Train Your Dragon fics, &quot;The Eternal One,&quot; &quot;COPS-Stormfromt,&quot; and most of the Jeff the Killer/Slenderman ones.<br>6.

            <p>Actually, of course they will. Questions are terrifying little monsters. <br>I suppose I must explain. I have made a life goal of reading through the very messy PPC Wiki. I still have a lot more pages to read through but I have a few questions regarding what I have read so far. I&#39;m going to be a bit more forward since I&#39;ve been officially hanging around here for two weeks. <br><br>Since a Deformed is a League of Mary-Sue Factories worker that is an underdeveloped Sue, and there are reformed Sue agents, can there be a reformed Deformed? (Gah, that sounds funny) <br><br>Do agents have to have hands?<br><br>If an agent is a pyromaniac (eg everyone in DOGA) does that mean they are flamethrower-crazy? If so does that mean that the agents in DOGA are crazier than the other departments&#39;s agents?<br><br>To what extent is the PPC valid for missions? I&#39;ve been noticing a lack of Creative Curses in...uh...some missions. No offense intended. <br><br>Do you roleplay on here very often? Or is that only for the RP forum? <br><br>Okay, I think that&#39;s it. If any other newbies have questions, they can ask too, I believe.</p>

            <p>1) If a badfic has a population of a species of animal or plant in it that doesn&#39;t belong in that continuum (i.e. tigers and palm trees in AoT), how many would you theoretically need to transport to the DMFF for them to count as all being rounded up? If it&#39;s a World One animal, would we use World One info about how many there are in a given environment or make up our own numbers?<br>2) Besides the &#39;Bad End&#39; and King Kroc, what kinds of things do we have in the DMFF, anyway? I presume that the basilisk from Ripper&#39;s first mission is there, but beyond that, I don&#39;t have the slightest clue. If we need someone to manage said department, I would gladly help. I&#39;m still tweaking my writing samples, but they&#39;re almost done, and I&#39;ve found a lot of badfics with animals that don&#39;t belong, including one where there are dinosaurs in Remnant.<br>3) Would it be possible to just dump a non-canonical species in a continuum where they would fit in? Say that someone creates a species of acid-spitting giant scorpions. Could we just drop them off on one of the layers of the Abyss from D&amp;D?<br>4) What are the accommodations like for the animals and plants in the DMFF? </p>

<li>I&#39;ve got an idea for the version of Pinkamena from <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/FanficIsCrapsack"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/FanficIsCrapsack">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/FanficIsCrapsack</a></a> If the link gets censored, it&#39;s written by Reality Check.  The basic premise is that somehow badfic like Cupcakes spawned a separate personality for Pinkie Pie that is aware of bad fanfiction and works to destroy it.  <br><br>My basic idea is that while she doesn&#39;t properly know about the PPC, she can see agents and tell that they&#39;re not part of the story.  Occasionally, she&#39;d be the character replacement.<br><br>2. I know that Cupcakes has been killed, but I found a Generation 1 story about it.  Can I say that Cupcakes was so infamous that references to it are still hurting canon?<br><br>3. Are there any borrowable agents that are fans of or knowledgeable of older My Little Pony series?<br><br>4. Can I please have the Marquis de Sod tell someone that they can&#39;t be a field agent?  I really like a concept I came up with where someone is stuck in the department of operations for years even though he wants to be an assassin.  Then he finally manages to get transferred.  I only want to use him for maybe 3-6 missions before he realizes that he&#39;s not really suited to be in the action division.</li>

            <p>Right now, the answer to all of them is &quot;No, you can&#39;t, because you don&#39;t have Permission to write PPC stories yet.&quot;<br><br>However, assuming you eventually get it:<br><br>1. That sounds like fanon, not canon. Canon!Pinkie Pie has no knowledge of any fanfic, let alone an entire alternate personality based on it. Fanon!Pinkamena turning up as a character replacement could work, but it seems to me you&#39;d have to get Reality Check&#39;s permission first, since you&#39;d be using their idea.<br><br>2. Maybe? The concept of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Canon_Damage">canon damage</a> is a thing, after all.<br><br>3. Not that I know of.<br><br>4. ... No, you actually need Permission for this one. It&#39;s a fine idea for a character arc, but you&#39;ve got to sell us on your ability to write characters first.<br><br>Follow-up question: What&#39;s with all the interest in &quot;Cupcakes&quot;? It makes me nervous when newbies get fixated on Legendaries, especially ones that have been killed already. There&#39;s way more to the PPC than the Big Bads.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Cupcakes just seems to crop up a lot.  I don&#39;t have the links with me, but I remember a couple stories where the author mentions having read Cupcakes and then has Rainbow Dash strapped to a table.  I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ve actually read one of the original versions.<br><br>I grabbed the second Reality Check story and decided that having that version of Pinkamena show up would mean that there would be no time for a charge list and the agents might be in danger.</p>

            <p>But I know that I, as a newbie, was pretty excitable. Badfic was Horrible and you <i>had</i> to do something about it — you need strike down upon it with great vengeance and furious anger! Following that mindset, you gravitate toward the biggest thing you see. The biggest thing I saw, being a newcomer to the idea of fanfic, was a bad <i>Artemis Fowl</i> x <i>Doctor Who</i> crossover. It seems that other newbies see Legendaries.</p>

To be more specific, Sigil, the City of Doors, is said to contain portals leading anywhere and everywhere in the D&amp;D multiverse, could such a gateway exist between Sigil and some part of HQ in that continuum, or would it be blocked by its defenses?<br><br>2/B/2nd) Magic and HQ: Similar to the last question, is there a consensus on just how connected HQ is to the rest of the Multiverse? For instance, would the Force still be present despite being unique to Star Wars?<br><br>3/C/3rd) Characters from other stories in the PPC: Basically, what does the Board think of using a character in the PPC and another story at the same time? This one isn&#39;t particularly important as I&#39;ve decided against using the character in question, but it&#39;s still an interesting query, I think.<br><br>4/D/4th) Characters aware of the PPC: This is just me being nosy. What characters does everyone think are aware of the PPC? I think Tarquin from Order of the Stick might qualify, given his expert knowledge of the inner workings of storytelling. I also suspect the Lady of Pain (ruler of the aforementioned City of Doors) might know. She&#39;s powerful enough to keep gods out of Sigil, she&#39;s probably picked up a few things.<br><br>Hm. I could swear I had more questions, but I suppose I&#39;ve forgotten them. Ah well, always the next question thread.<br><br>Unless I&#39;m abducted by ninjas.</p>

            <p>1) &quot;Sigil, the City of Doors, is said to contain portals leading anywhere and everywhere in the <b>D&amp;D multiverse</b>&quot;<br><br>I think that answers that. ;P Plotholes in Sigil are just as likely, though.<br><br>2) From what most spinoffs show, HQ seems to be an amalgamation of phlebotinum in that pretty much all canonical abilities can be used within it. (Though there might be exceptions; it&#39;s specifically stated in the <i>RWBY</i> &#39;verse that when Dust is taken off of Remnant it stops working.)<br><br>3) There have actually been a few like that! <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Alec_Troven">Alec Troven</a> and affiliated characters come to mind for me.<br><br>4) The general agreement on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Canons_Who_Know_of_the_PPC">canons who know about the PPC</a> are gods, like Aslan, Eru, Madoka, and the like. There are a few exceptions (which I personally don&#39;t agree with), but the general consensus is &quot;they have to be omniscient/omnipotent&quot;. Fourth wall breakers and Genre Savvy characters generally don&#39;t count.</p>

            <p>1) I was mostly curious about this because in the article on the Wiki it notes that HQ exists pretty much everywhere. The examples given being a stretch of corridor in the Misty Mountains or in orbit around Hoth. So I was more curious if a small stretch of corridor happened to snake through the Astral Sea, would one of Sigil&#39;s portals actually be able to reach it?<br><br>2) Noted!<br><br>3) Hm, interesting. I shall certainly check that out.<br><br>4) I see your point. I guess only the really omniscient characters have enough influence over the canon to avoid forgetting anything they&#39;d learn, anyway.<br><br>Many thanks for the prompt response.</p>

            <p>If—and it&#39;s not an unlikely if—there was a bit of HQ in the Astral Sea or the Feywild or what have you, I don&#39;t see why a portal from Sigil couldn&#39;t make it into HQ, though I suspect the Department of External Security would keep a close eye on that.</p>

            <p>Iximaz posted a response while I was writing mine out, but I wanted to express my thoughts anyway. While using canonicals has been done <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Team_Phoenix">in the past</a>, I believe that PPC characters should be of your own creation. Yes, we may &quot;adopt&quot; or &quot;rescue&quot; badfic characters, but we shape how they develop. They become something new, something transformative, something that is wholly ours. I would argue that is far more interesting than just trying to ape another writer&#39;s character.<br><br>There&#39;s nothing stopping you from creating <i>versions</i> of a canonical character. Badfic provides plenty of rationales for why a slightly-off clone/twin/reincarnation/replacement of a known figure might exist. <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Paddlebrains">Paddlebrains</a> and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Dafydd_Illian">Dafydd Illian</a> are both examples of this. They used Sirius Black and Maglor, respectively, as templates, but ultimately became their own characters.</p>

            <p>There was a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Team_Phoenix">kinda-sorta exception</a> to that from a while back, though. <br><br>Anyway, recruiting canons (unless they&#39;re from your own original stories) is a no-no, but recruiting character replacements is completely fine.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m a bit confused as to the difference between ancillary canons and AUs. It seems like it has to do with whether the work in question (if it exists in the real world and not just in-universe) is officially made or declared canon by the creator. Am I running along the right lines?</p>

            <p><b>A Note on Ancillary Canons</b><br><i>by Agent Norlossë, Division of Applied-and-theoretical Multiversal Physics</i><br><br>The PPC traditionally divides works of fiction into two categories: those which were written or authorised by the creator/owner of a given verse are &#39;canon&#39;, while everything else is &#39;fanfic&#39;. Within the &#39;fanfic&#39; category, we recognise a great many distinctions, including the key one between goodfic and badfic. Canon, however, has simply been called canon.<br><br>The Spectrum of Integrated Canon Hierarchies (name under dispute) aims to change that. Using it, we divide canon worlds into 4 categories:<br><br>1/ Canon Verses. These are what we usually recognise as canon - the works of the creator, or things accepted as being extensions and part of them.<br><br>2/ Canon AUs. This covers alternate universes and timelines which are recognised as such either by the canon, or by the media in which it is set. Something like the <i>Star Trek</i> Mirror Universe falls into this group, as do most of <i>Doctor Who</i>&#39;s alternate timelines, and I&#39;d class alternate endings to video games in the same way. There&#39;s some disagreement over whether those three classes of universe should be separated out as sub-categories.<br><br>3/ EUs. Expanded Universes are bodies of work authorised by the canon&#39;s creator, but <i>not</i> explicitly made a part of the main canon. In some cases, the creator specifically says that their canon can override the EU if they ever come into conflict. <i>Star Wars</i>, <i>Star Trek</i>, and <i>Doctor Who</i> all have massive EUs, though in the case of the <i>Star Wars</i> one, there&#39;s a major ongoing discussion about it (see below).<br><br>4/ Ancillary Canons. These are split into two subcategories:<br><br>4a/ Overwritten Ancillaries. These are worlds which <i>were once</i> canon - they were created with the intent that they <i>would be</i> canon - but <i>no longer</i> are. The classic example (and one very close to my heart) is the <i>Book of Lost Tales</i> - a nearly-complete work by J.R.R. Tolkien which was superceded by his later interpretation of Middle-earth.<br><br>The other big-name example right now is the <i>Star Wars</i> EU/Legends-verse. Since it&#39;s been disavowed as canon, but was always an EU and not a class 1 Canon Verse, we&#39;ve got a big argument going on as to whether it&#39;s a class 4a, a class 3 still, a class 2 (since it&#39;s officially an AU, but not recognised as such in canon), or something else entirely. Fun times all round.<br><br>4b/ Encapsulated Ancillaries. These don&#39;t entirely exist. They&#39;re those worlds which exists as books-within-books and the like. World One readers can only experience the portion of them that makes it into the full canon story, but readers in the canon can discover the whole thing.<br><br>There are a few quirky borderline cases where Encapsulated Ancillaries have been published in World One in their own right. The works of crime-writer Richard Castle are a prominent example, as is the novel <i>Bad Twin</i>, by a character from <i>Lost</i>. Whether these are class 4bs or fully-fledged class 1s is - you guessed it - being debated at length.<br><br>~<br><br>Yup, this is what Norlossë&#39;s ended up doing.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Did you really put together an Ardrolindi playlist? :D I like it.<br><br>Re: Alternate continuities, the Whoniverse alone has the novels, the radio plays, the comics, the films that are supposed to be retellings of earlier stories but feature a human scientist named &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the stage plays... <br><br>I personally consider all of these to be canon in their own right, just existing in their own continuities.

            <p>Oml. I&#39;ve been so on/off PPC I can&#39;t even remember half the original series (but hey! makes for good re-reading.)<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m gonna try and make a resolution to myself - I need to write more often, and I&#39;m too lazy to even try without a significant amount of pressure, so I&#39;m going to re-join here and at least try to be active.<br><br>I also may have started a lil plotbunny I found under my bed, and I wanted to share the totally un-beta&#39;d, mostly not re-read start, just for kicks. Opinions and concrit are totally appreciated:<br><br>*<br><br> “Do you have any last words?” Agent Ceka repeated the words with the quick, distant tone that signified how many times she had said them. They were quite overused, she thought. Maybe she’d change them up next mission.<br> The ‘Sue standing in front of her shook her head briefly, but reached into her pocket with shaking hands. Ceka stepped forward, ready to slap any weapon out of the girl’s hand. However, she came up with a small, black tablet which looked like it had taken a beating. Letting out a sigh, the girl handed it to Ceka, who stared at it with something akin to malice.<br>  “Oh, don’t worry, it’s not bombed or anything. Just, after you kill me, read it. Please.” The girl smiled sadly. “Promise me.”<br>  Taken aback by the cliché-ness, Ceka nodded. “Um, sure?”<br>   “Thanks.”<br>   The ‘Sue submitted willingly to being pushed through a portal into an uninhabited planet’s atmosphere. Ceka immediately portalled back to HQ and plopped down on the floor near her TARDIS’s console. She flipped the tablet open, onto a notes page called ‘Journal’. Curious, Ceka clicked on entry number one. <br><br>    Journal Entry #1<br>    April 9th<br><br>The first time I took a breath, people were already shunning me. At the first sight of me, people turned and hid their faces, murmuring prayers for the poor family that now had to take care of me.<br>   Why? Because of my hair color. I understand them, I truly do. If I had been normal, I would have condoned this treatment, ignored others like me.<br>   I am an ordinary brunette. However, it’s the one streak of pink that defines me. It is my curse, the curse of the Mary Sues. The people who are defined in every way by the actions of the people who first traveled into books.<br>  My name is Alyna Chase, and I am destined for fandoms: my doom, my despair. I shall be transported into the main character’s path, become something ordinary people detest, and eventually be discovered and subsequently killed by a convenient Hunter, or an Agent, or something of that type. <br> I’ve got no choice. It’s rather like the Hunger Games, except you’re chosen as a Tribute even before you’re born. It’s in your genetics. Some clever person way back when devised a way to tell ‘Sues from the rest of the people. They did something, altered the genetics of the ‘Sues back then. Now, every one of us is born with a pink streak on the left side of our head. Then we know we have anywhere from minutes to one hundred years to live before we’re transported into a story.<br>    I’m nineteen, and I’m pretty sure I’ll be transported soon. Yesterday, I found a scar I had no idea I had on the palm of my hand. It was shaped like a star. I wonder if I’m destined for Harry Potter. A mysteeeerious girl with a mysteeeerious scar on her hand; maybe she survived the Avada Kedavra curse too. Probably too good of an idea to be true for the average fanfiction writer.<br>  I figured I might as well make a journal of my expeditions in whatever canon I find myself in, so here we are. Maybe whoever kills me will find this and realize that some ‘Sues are innocent. I realize most do love their job of messing up canon, but it is true that some would much rather be normal. <br>   Maybe they’d be more careful of who they hurt.<br>    -Alyna Chase<br><br>    Ceka was… intrigued. There was a small moment of hesitation, then she tapped on Journal Entry #2.<br><br> Journal Entry #2<br>    July 19th<br>   <br>    A couple month’s break, and I’m officially ready to start a daily log. Sorta. I’ll try. <br>  Nothing much has happened since Entry #1, except for the start of summer break. However, my instinct is basically screaming that I’ll be transported soon. After a bit of research, I determined some other scar-related fandoms. One of them is Eragon. Unfortunately, my scar matches those of ‘Dragon Riders’ in that particular fandom. Now I’ve got two suspect fandoms for my Suedom. Great.<br>  I’ve been contemplating putting together a backpack of supplies. My theory is this: if I keep that backpack on my person at all times, I may be able to somehow ‘cheat’ it into the canon. Maybe find a way to break myself out with the supplies in there.<br>   The thing I want to bring most, though, is this tablet, for reasons that probably should be obvious. <br>Wow, I just had an extremely weird thought. At this point in time, my reader(s?) definitely know whether this made it into the canon or not… while I’m here wondering about it. I suppose I’ll know the answer at the time that you’re reading this but right now… ugh, I’m confusing myself. I’d better sign off before you get too bored. <br> I’ll try to get some more interesting tidbits next entry.<br> -Alyna Chase</p>

Leavanny benefits from it too, with access to Seed Bomb, but that doesn&#39;t really change its role so much as its EV spread. Get a Jolly one and give it EVs in Attack and Speed, with the last four in Defence, then give it Sticky Web, Seed Bomb, Knock Off, and Magic Coat. Then just remember to have fun! =]</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a lot of stuff here to like. For examples, the beginnings of a rapport between Ix and Charlotte. I already feel like they will bounce off each other very well. I also dug the idea of showing someone from a different canon their actual source material (although I sorta questioned Ix taking the revelation so well.

            <p>Ix &quot;knows&quot; that her home canon is real. She grew up there; how could it not be real? What needs to sink in is that, to other people, the Potterverse may be as fictitious as <i>Twilight</i> was to her. Until she learned that in some way <i>Twilight</i> is real, and not in a lesser way than her home is real, because there may be no other way. So reality itself may not be what she believed it to be.

            <p>Well, sort of. Another Boarder had the idea of creating a sparklepire agent before, and he fed himself of glitterbag&#39;s blood, hence the purple color. Pretty good idea in my opinion.</p>

            <p>... trying to pin down what bothers me about this story.<br><br>It&#39;s not the worldbuilding. I <i>love</i> the worldbuilding (and the name-drop of Tree Fu Bom, don&#39;t think I missed that); the idea of RCs growing their own produce and trading it around fits in very nicely, and the smell-alert is a lovely concept.<br><br>I think I&#39;ve figured it out, though. At its heart, this is still very much a PPC story. I didn&#39;t feel like I was exploring a new world - I felt like someone had changed around some of the technology.<br><br>Obviously, it&#39;s your story, etc etc. But the reason I enjoy things like <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/AltTCDA.htm">the TCDA</a>, or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18pyotc1FYQP2ermenDk_xBSf6kP3McRNXZCsrSVyPrQ/pub">the FPF</a>, is that they feel... different. The stories you can tell in a &#39;PPC&#39; running around in spaceships are very different to the ones you can tell in HQ.<br><br>Like I say, it&#39;s <i>not</i> the worldbuilding. I wouldn&#39;t have done it how you did (why not go all the way and just set up HQ outside?), but that&#39;s fine, different people write different things, and I can understand your desire to keep things in a building. But the feel of the story... wasn&#39;t &#39;move quietly and plant things&#39;. It was &#39;the PPC&#39;.<br><br>-You have (star, even) an Internal Affairs department in a supposedly laid-back setting. They act (per the Tiger Lily) just like a police force. Where&#39;s the calm, soothing aspect of that?<br><br>-People go flamethrower-crazy often enough that the term exists. Why? This is the calm, gentle PPC; why is there still enough stress to make people snap?<br><br>-You still have a DoDAEG in a <b>solar</b>punk setting. Why not take the opportunity to invent something new? (Random notion: they don&#39;t like doing it, but in the event of severe solar/water outages, the energy folks have emergency biomass generators. When the suns get dim, people have to start donating fruit as fuel...)<br><br>-You still kill Suvians (even if you do grow blue-green algae off their bodies). I can&#39;t think of a less blunt way to say this: what&#39;s the point of being calm and soothing if you&#39;re keeping the violent murder part of the setting the same? ;P<br><br>I liked the worldbuilding. I liked the writing. I just feel like this is a halfway-story, not a full-fledged AU.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>What I wanted to do was make a solarpunk version of the PPC, rather than a radically different AU; I&#39;m not massively experienced at writing solarpunk stories, either, which didn&#39;t help. When I started to think about how to write it, I decided to err on the side of familiarity, retaining as many attributes of PPC-Prime as I thought relevant. For instance, if I went fully harmonious, pretty much everyone would be in FicPsych - treating Sues much as OFUs treat fangirls, but without the Learning Through Pain and instead with counselling and getting to the root of their doubtless many issues - and DIA&#39;s primary job would be to ward the inmates and make sure any escape attempts are dealt with compassionately.<br><br>One thing I will say is that solarpunk doesn&#39;t just mean solar power - it means all forms of renewable and non-damaging energy production, and authors spinning in their graves is <i>exactly</i> the kind of thing a solarpunk future would harness. However, it is in conjunction with the photovoltaic stained-glass windows mentioned right at the beginning of the story.<br><br>If I set it somewhere else, I sort of know how I&#39;d set it up, since we have access to the fauna of innumerable worlds. The Incomparable Gardens, from the criminally underrated <i>Keys To The Kingdom</i> series by Garth Nix, have four enormous plants called Drasil trees supporting the whole edifice. A similar setup could would very well, with the canopy of the trees supporting ecodwellings in the style of the Mapungubwe Interpretation Centre:-<br><br><img src="http://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Mapungubwe-Interpretation-Centre-11.jpg"><br><br>And probably made out of mycelium bricks, a la<a href="http://www.mycoworks.com/">these guys</a>.<br><br>Yes, there&#39;s a lot of things I should have done - keep the plot point about Agent Bigmouth needing some friends and have the DIA try and help her with that, that sort of thing - and lots of things I will do later. I was overcautious in my world creation, and will endeavour to correct it. =]</p>

            <p>a) The PPC is More Than Just Killing Sues. C&#39;mon, you know this one.<br><br>b) And... that would be a bad thing?<br><br>That sounds like a <i>fantastic</i> AU.<br><br>~<br><br>Agent Tallulah Wilding stepped under the arched entryway of the Soothing Garden and took a deep breath. The grounds around her hummed with life, flowers and insects and deep-rooted trees all working in harmony. Over their scents were layered the gentle odours of agents&#39; alert systems: strawberry for Mike Lanilor, asphalt for Tr&#39;keen (always slightly strange), and just a hint of wet dog to say that Jemma O&#39;Steve had been here in the last half hour.<br><br>Tallulah followed the earth path along the fringe of the garden to the acceptance centre. Under the leafy canopy, the Kudzu&#39;s main node was a vibrant cluster of purple flowers.<br><br><i>Ah, Tallulah,</i> the Flower said, nodding a blossom in her direction. <i>Lovely to see you.</i><br><br>&quot;It&#39;s lovely to be here.&quot; Tallulah smiled at the Garden&#39;s coordinator. &quot;Is there anything I can do to help?&quot;<br><br><i>I think there is, in fact.</i> The Kuzdu flicked a leaf against the flatscreen embedded in a pillar beside her. <i>Yvaine of Kent, from the DMS - you know her?</i><br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had the pleasure,&quot; Tallulah admitted.<br><br><i>Well, now you may. She&#39;s found a Suvian who needs our help; could you help her to bring her in?</i><br><br>&quot;Surely.&quot; Tallulah drew the smoothly curving shape of her Remote Activator from her belt, feeling the wood warm under her fingers. &quot;Might I have the continuum code?&quot;<br><br><i>I have it here somewhere.</i> The Kuzdu&#39;s mass shuffled, and a tendril produced a small box. <i>Here you go, my dear.</i><br><br>&quot;Thank you.&quot; Tallulah took the box and opened it. The first sensory module was a rough surface, perhaps a shell. The second was painted a deep red. The third exuded a waft of chamomile. The fourth chimed out a soft note - C#, if she was any judge.<br><br>&quot;Seashell. Red. Chamomile. C#.&quot; Tallulah murmured. &quot;Seashell, red, chamomile, C#.&quot;<br><br><i>I think the Herbarium is free right now,</i> the Kudzu said. <i>You should be able to settle your charge in there.</i><br><br>Tallulah nodded, still focussing on the psychic key. &quot;Seashell, red-&quot;<br><br>The RA locked in the coordinates. A swirling blue portal opened in front of Tallulah. She smiled. Time to go to work.<br><br>~<br><br>You&#39;ve got the possibility of multiple FicPsych gardens, the question of how the other departments fit into the system, you&#39;ve still got your grow-your-own feel... I think that would be great fun to read about!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I wasn&#39;t trying to be snide: I <i>love</i> this AU. And I <i>really</i> love the ultrapacifist take on it here. Yes, it&#39;s more than just killing Sues, but see previous remarks about not distancing it too much from PPC Prime and my regret at doing so.<br><br>With this, I think we&#39;ve got a great setup for the Paradisal Plot Continuum here, for lack of a better term. There is still conflict, it&#39;s just solved by talking to Sues and each other rather than force of arms... except when not. What, for example, is Ispace like in this &#39;verse? Can the solarpunks find their common ground, outheal their DPS, and enter into a constructive dialogue with them? We can but wonder.<br><br>Of all the Action Departments, the least different to my mind is the Jardin d&#39;Amour, the solarpunk AU&#39;s Department of Bad Slash. Yes, they are all gardens, I love that idea and am nicking it wholesale. The DMS would be... hm. The Gravel Garden, perhaps, with its many rockeries of photovoltaic collection beads, tiny versions of the World One <a href="http://www.rawlemon.com/collections/beta-ray">RawLemon design</a>. FicPsych and Medical might be combined under the Apothecary Gardens, and DoSAT would be the Greenhouse. Solarpunk technology is supposed to be non-intrusive, user-friendly, and beautiful in an understated way; pretty much the opposite of the Prime DoSAT&#39;s M.O., but we can work with it. =]<br><br>Perhaps people all follow the Prime Department of Angst&#39;s operating procedures, only more tailored to the situation. No killing, obviously, but more tranquilisers, mood stabilisers, and similar bio-derived things. Uniforms aren&#39;t really a thing, with people making and 3D-printing whatever clothes they feel most comfortable in. It&#39;s just... Elysian. Everyone is your friend. You live in a garden with the multiverse at your fingertips and beauty wherever you choose to find it.<br><br>I was worried about making it too &quot;nice&quot;, in the meek and squishy and saccharine way common to &#39;80s cartoons aimed at little girls. I now fear I didn&#39;t make it nice enough. =]</p>

            <p>I always love seeing AUs of the PPC. In this case, I like seeing this softer, more relaxed take on the PPC. It&#39;s a nice change of pace considering that most of the PPC AUs I know of (including the ones I created) tend to run along the lines of &quot;everything is terrible and will probably continue to be so.&quot;<br><br>There&#39;s also some very top-notch world-building, which is another thing I love. Growing chairs with magic and using them for trade, the scent-based console alerts, and the 3D printers are all nice touches. My one complaint regarding that would be the second-to-last paragraph. That last bunch of additional details felt shoehorned in considering that nothing I saw beforehand indicated Lola had any questions about how the universe worked.<br><br>To sum up, well done!

            <p>Look up &quot;calm computing&quot; when you have a spare minute - it&#39;s a really interesting design system, one of the chief tenets of which is to use alerts other than just a variety of mechanical bleeps when something happens. While touch-based feedback is gonna be the main focus in our world, I thought that (with the solarpunk aesthetic and a bumped-up basic tech level) a scent-based alert setup would work very well in the setting.<br><br>I&#39;ve never read anything by Greg Bear, and will endeavour to correct this.

            <p>The latest issue of <i>Scientific American</i> had an article about Dr. Tim Lomas&#39; research into words for wellbeing and positive experiences that don&#39;t translate readily into English. <a href="http://www.drtimlomas.com/#!positive-lexicography/cm4mi">His website is here</a>.

            <p>Obviously I jumped straight down to Welsh, and I do like <i>cwtch</i>, which is apparently literally the space between someone&#39;s arms when they&#39;re hugging you, and extends idiomatically to any space that feels the same way.

            <p>loan words from Hebrew.<br><br>One of them, amusingly enough, is <i>actually in the Hebrew list as well</i>.<br><br>Nachus: pride in someone else&#39;s actions. (Yiddish)<br>Nachat (נחת) - Contented pride in your progeny&#39;s or student&#39;s accomplishment. (Hebrew)<br><br>Same word, different pronunciation. Same <i>spelling</i>, too, not that it&#39;s in there. It&#39;s just being pronounced Ashkenazi Hebrew style instead of Sephardi Hebrew style, as one does in Yiddish (when one isn&#39;t also mangling the sounds together). Nachus as used in English today also has basically the same meaning as given for the Hebrew term--satisfaction/contented pride from (usually) your progeny&#39;s actions.<br><br>As for the others...<br><br>Gemilut hasadim: loving-kindness. (Yiddish)<br><br>Yeah, also Hebrew. It&#39;s from...I think Pirkei Avot? From a verse of a teaching that translates to: &quot;On three things the world stands: on the Torah, on the avodah (lit: work, in this context, worship), and on g&#39;milut chasadim&quot;. It&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5f8XFwt8_A">also a song.</a> The pronunciation is only correct to Hebrew, by the way; my dictionary says it&#39;s &quot;gmiles-khsodim&quot;. Hurray for Uriel Weinreich&#39;s dictionary!  And, er...he translates it as &quot;loan[s] without interest&quot;. Sorry, word list makers.<br><br>Hachnasat orchim: ‘welcoming the stranger,’ offering hospitality and respect to strangers. (Yiddish)<br><br>Yeahhh, <i>also</i> Hebrew! The translation is correct (though Weinreich adds that it refers to &quot;the commandment of hospitality to guests, esp. on the Sabbath and holidays&quot;); the pronunciation is also correct...to Hebrew. In Yiddish, according to the dictionary I checked, it should be &quot;Hach<i>no</i>ses <i>or</i>chim&quot;. Same words, different emphasis, and a soft tav (something that Sephardi Hebrew doesn&#39;t use, hence half the differences I&#39;ve been pointing out.<br><br>Tzedaka: generosity, required righteous giving. (Yiddish)<br><br>Yup, Hebrew word. Same spelling in Yiddish, but pronounced &quot;tzdoke&quot;. Meaning is the same, though I&#39;d put it differently; namely, it&#39;s charity, generosity, and, yes, a mitzvah (there are even different levels of charity, the highest of which according to...Maimonides?? Someone in the Talmud? I don&#39;t remember) is giving anonymously. <br><br>Fargin: to glow with pride and happiness at the successes of others. (Yiddish)<br><br>I have no clue. If it has this meaning, it&#39;s not in Weinreich. He has Fargeyn in there (no Fargn, which is the other thing Fargin could be spelled as), but it means &quot;pass (away); (sun) set&quot; and then has some variations. It could just not be in here, though, or come from a different language and not be something Weinreich encountered.<br><br>Kvell: to feel pride and joy in someone else&#39;s accomplishment.<br><br>A bit more elaborate than Weinreich&#39;s definition, but sure, that&#39;s basically it. (Weinreich says &quot;beam (at), be delighted (with), revel in&quot;.) The verb form is kvellen.<br><br>Menschlichkeit: being a good human being in its fullest sense.<br><br>...or &quot;humanity (humaneness)&quot; according to Weinreich, but, well, that&#39;s pretty similar too.<br><br>Well! That just about sums it up. Only one thing left, and that is the following:<br><br>Since the actual spelling of the Yiddish isn&#39;t given, I&#39;m going to provide it!<br><br>G&#39;milut chasadim/gmiles khsodim: גמילות חסדים<br>Hachnasat orchim/hakhnoses orkhim: הכנסת אורחים<br>Tzedaka/tzdoke: צדקה<br>Fargin: probably פֿאַרגן. Fargeyn, which I gave, is: פֿאַרגײן (and is a verb)<br>Kvell, kvellen: קװעל, קװעלן<br>Menschlichkeit: מענטשלעכקײט<br><br>So. Not that this isn&#39;t pretty cool, but...honestly, the Yiddish feels like it&#39;s lacking. Four out of seven words are from Hebrew--and transliterated as they would be from Hebrew, apart from nachus (pronounced nakhis, not nakhoos, by the way). They also are given only in transliteration, although I do note that some of the other languages receive the same treatment.<br><br>I...suppose I should write him a version of this, shouldn&#39;t I? I see he&#39;s requested help in improving the definitions. I&#39;ll put it on my list of things to do.<br><br>/scuttles back towards essay sources research/<br><br>/scuttles back/ Thanks for posting this, by the way! Even just this much--the analyzing--was pretty fun. I&#39;m looking forward to reading through some of the words from the other languages.<br><br>(Also, it&#39;s pretty great that Yiddish is on here. That I&#39;m pleased with. I wasn&#39;t sure it&#39;d come up when I searched it.)<br><br>/scuttles away again/<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Using too many words, however, is another problem entirely...<br><br>My favorites are the Norwegian word &#39;Gjensynsglede&#39; (the joy of meeting someone you haven&#39;t seen in a long time) and the French word &#39;Retrouvailles&#39; (the joy people feel after meeting loved ones again after a long time apart). <br><br>Interestingly, both of them are from the same section of the website.

            <p>So, the other day I went to the library and I found a book that looked interesting, so I took it out. Bad move. While the writing itself was interesting and engaging, the main character just made me cringe. So if anyone is planning on ever reading the book (series), you might not want to read this.<br><br>The book is &#39;Keeper of the Lost Cities&#39; by Shannon Messenger.<br><br>SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Now that the formalities are out of the way, I wanted to get out my frustrations. Keep in mind, I actually did enjoy the book and this is in no way meant to bash her writing, I just found the main character, Sophie Foster, to be a classic textbook case of a sue.<br><br>To begin, her backstory:<br>She is an exceptionally smart twelve year old who is a high school senior who has been accepted to Yale. Of course, being a genius isn&#39;t all. She had a really bad accident when she was five and became a telepath. <br><br>That isn&#39;t so bad though, so I got through the whole genius thing. Whatever. But it&#39;s the fact that she is an elf as well that kind of irritated me. I can forgive that one more easily since 90% of the characters are elves. <br><br>But just in point form, here are some of the other irritating things about her:<br><br>- She is a genetic experiment<br>- Only elf with brown eyes<br>- Extremely powerful<br>- Popular with all the guys (even ones who are years older than her. She&#39;s twelve in the first book for goodness sake!)<br>- Photographic Memory<br>- Has forbidden secret information planted in her head<br>- Has way too many cute animal friends to count<br>- Can communicate with aforementioned animals telepathically<br>- Does so many things that are illegal to the elven laws but is never seriously punished for them<br>- Gets kidnapped for her abilities, but is completely fine afterwards (well, sort of. But it relates to my next point)<br>- She is self-sacrificing and tries to be a martyr<br>- Can read the minds of anyone she wants to, and they can&#39;t read hers at all. Even the oldest and wisest elves can&#39;t.<br>- Does some things that are deemed impossible<br>- Runs away from home because of some tragic event but is rescued by the hot guy she likes<br>- Can speak any language with no effort at all<br><br>and more. It just frustrated me so much, but at least the other more normal characters helped me get past the horror of her growing repertoire of skills. Once again, the writing wasn&#39;t bad, but I am still debating going back and reading the second book.<br><br>(Yes, this entire list was composed of things I remembered a day later and all from the first book.)</p>

            <p>Somewhat comparable to this one character my friend made. I do not want to talk about the dual wielding vampire with demigod powers. What the keck, I&#39;m going to take this as a book recommendation. But... lithium? To my knowledge, it doesn&#39;t give off rays. Does she have to ingest it? It&#39;s such a random thing. I don&#39;t know, elf comes at me, I pull out a battery? I can only assume that she somehow ends up &quot;overcoming&quot; this, and that&#39;s going to be the only character development she goes through.

            <p>And I don&#39;t even know what the heck limbium even is. I wish it was lithium though. So much easier to get a hold of. I think she just reacts to the metal itself, like how people can&#39;t wear earrings unless they are silver or something. And she has an antidote/allergy medicine around her neck at all times. But at least it&#39;s an anaphylactic reaction. And good luck. I think there&#39;s 5 books in that series. I probably will read the others just so I can see how much worse it can (and will) get.</p>

            <p>I read a teaser of the first two chapters of the second book. Big mistake. In less than 2 chapters she had already gotten yet another ability, to inflict emotions/pain, etc on people and had mentally communicated with an alicorn who now apparently trusts only her. Who is also the second one they have ever found in millenia and was extremely rare. It also happens to be the opposite gender of the one they already had. She also effortlessly teleports it back to her house. Wow. And it is only book 2 of 5. Should I read the rest so no one else has to? And I think it actually has a fanfic archive, but will get back on that one. They might be better (or more likely worse) than the original.</p>

            <p>but has anyone seen the trailer for MLP Season 6? Namely, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUXorG6zVkc">this trailer</a>?

            <p>To be honest I&#39;m much more excited about Starlight Glimmer making an appearance. But this...this alicorn is a little disturbing. How many alicorns are we going to get, anyhow!?

            <p>I like how we went from two Alicorns to five. However, to be fair, she was birthed from Cadence. Then again, Cadence &quot;ascended&quot; as it were. So.. I have no idea.<br><br>However, I believe in the Journal of the Two Sisters it is confirmed that Celestia and Luna were born rather than ascended, and that they were raised by other alicorns. So, either they are the &quot;last of their race&quot; and normal ponies can be artificially ascended, or... I have no idea. However, the answer to your main question is, both.</p>

            <p>I mean, we don&#39;t know how Cadence, Luna, and Celestia became alicorns, so it&#39;s fair enough to assume that they could&#39;ve been born as such. <br><br>Besides, we&#39;ve seen <a href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/a/a4/Pound_Cake_Pumpkin_Cake_sitting_smiling_S2E13.png/revision/latest?cb=20120129185936">Pumpkin and Pound Cake</a> were able to fly and use magic when they were babies, but not very well.
