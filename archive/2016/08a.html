            <p>First, Z-moves. One or two trailers ago, we saw a glimpse of the new move selection interface, and there was a big thing at the bottom with a type symbol on it. This is, one assumes, a Z-move; a mahoosively powerful move that can probably obliterate anything standing in its way, hence why each &#39;mon only get one use per battle. We know it&#39;s that because the symbols shown in this new trailer match the ones in the previous one, which makes me think it&#39;s very much a move of last resort - a Sashed revenge killer using its Z-move to take out an opposing, heavily boosted sweeper, for instance. Now, this is just speculation, but I think it&#39;d have to be tied in at least <i>some</i> manner to the Pokémon in question&#39;s stats, and one assumes typing effectivenesses are the same - though by the same token, I have no idea whether a given Z-move will be Physical or Special in nature. Maybe it&#39;ll be whether or not the type is classified as Special under the old system, that&#39;d be kinda neat.<br><br>(NB: For them as don&#39;t know, prior to Generation IV, moves were <i>always</i> either physical or special, depending on the type being used. This led to the interesting state of affairs in which Hyper Beam was a physical attack while Crunch was special. Always a joy.)<br><br>Still, what matters is all the new Pokémon. Ninetales-Alola and Sandslash-Alola look like they&#39;ll breathe new life into... less than entirely competitively viable Pokémon. Sandslash-Alola in particular, with a cool typing and maybe different base stats - from the stuff on the site, it looks like it might have lower speed but boosted defences - seems to be a major upgrade. We only know of one ability for any of them, Snow Cloak, but the bumf in Sandslash-Alola&#39;s page talks about how it&#39;s much faster on snow and ice. Maybe there&#39;s going to be a Hail-using equivalent of Sand Rush, Swift Swim, and Chlorophyll at last! Hurrah!<br><br>Anyway, still hyped, hope they get some Mega Stones as well. =]</p>

            <p>After a long while, I finally come with something. An Interlude 8 months in the making! <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ynhko3LfMy59LBNaVZoVP5LDF-0e7lTH5SKpy9VJDY0/edit?usp=sharing">Corinna Chan and the Temple of the Last Flute: The End</a>. Spoiler alert: She doesn&#39;t make it to the temple. :( <br><br>Anyway, this story was mostly made to expand on and give proper closure to my old comic I started writing years ago on DA, and to connect it to the PPC as well. It&#39;s pretty much Nurse Chan recounting her backstory, and introduces some shake ups to the Status Quo. Wanna know more? Well click on the link!</p>

            <p>So I’ll not even try to conjure a proper review; I’m just going to berate you after saying that I actually liked this interlude.<br><br><i>Solvig sighed and momentarily lifted her gaze. When her gaze met with Nurse Chan’s gaze ...</i><br>Three gazes in one line, and a fourth in the next paragraph, are a bit much. Maybe you could try to find some other words?<br><br><i>The fact that nearly killed Sarah in that mission...</i><br>Missing word &quot;I&quot;?<br><br><i>&quot;Solvig, please stop,&quot; the Nurse said suddenly, stopping Solvig’s rant.</i><br>I’m not quite sure why this took me out of the story so that I had to take a note. It’s either because Nurse Chan had something &quot;said suddenly&quot; just on the previous page, or it’s the stopping &quot;stop&quot;. I guess &quot;interrupted&quot; might work better hear.<br><br><i>&quot;Solvig, I did tell you it was a different universe to those you know, did not I?&quot;</i><br>Shouldn’t this be &quot;did I not&quot;? Or perhaps &quot;didn’t I&quot; (messing with the grammar to be able to use a contraction, which Corinna Chan apparently does not do)? Or is this Corinna Chan not knowing English grammar? <br><br><i>... it ended in an stalemate…</i><br>Since this isn’t a quote from an old fic, it should be &quot;a stalemate&quot;.<br><br><i>Although I do question the validity of such occurrence ...</i><br>Shouldn’t this be &quot;such an occurrence&quot;?<br><br><i>I did not knew until later that I had caught a Riolu ...</i><br>Should be &quot;I did not know ...&quot;.<br><br><i>Nubis and I were just taking a stroll the shore of the lake ...</i><br>Shouldn’t this be &quot;on the shore&quot;?<br><br><i>I took a dry branch that found lying there and tackled the one who was directly attacking Nubis ...</i><br>Another &quot;I&quot; is missing there (should be &quot;that I found&quot;).<br><br><i>When I came back to my senses and realized I had done ...</i><br>Should be &quot;realized what I had done&quot;.<br><br><i>The rest of the group was stunned to what they have seen ...</i><br>Should be &quot;what they had seen&quot; (past perfect).<br><br><i>&quot;No. And would not be the last one... &quot;</i><br>Missing word? (Should be &quot;And it would&quot;.) Although I wouldn’t have noticed this if there weren’t so many other words missing. I could actually imagine that Nurse Chan left this one out.<br><br><i>She then stopped laughing as suddenly as she started ...</i><br>Should be &quot;as suddenly as she had started&quot; (past perfect).<br><br><i>... and a good amount of soldiers from sides deserted ...</i><br>Should be &quot;from both sides&quot;.<br><br><i>... artifacts for the summoning the Legendary Ho-Oh.</i><br>If &quot;summoning&quot; is used as a noun here, it should be &quot;for the summoning of the Legendary Ho-Oh&quot;. On the other hand, if &quot;summoning&quot; is used as a verb. it doesn’t get an article; it should just be &quot;for summoning the Legendary Ho-Oh&quot;.  <br><br><i>Her followers did not had the same restriction however, making the break in more difficult than it should have, the good thing ... </i><br>Should be &quot;did not have the same&quot; and &quot;than it should have been&quot;.<br><br><i>I had broken into one their hideouts ...</i><br>Should be &quot;one of their hideouts&quot;.<br><br><i>... where met the Elder Sage and left the artifacts under his care.</i><br>Should be &quot;where I met&quot;.<br><br><i>I felt like head was going to explode under all of that ...</i><br>Should be &quot;like my head&quot;.<br><br><i>... who was glaring me with scorn in its gaze ...</i><br>Should be &quot;glaring at me&quot;.<br><br><i>&quot;Oh, do not they? &quot; Nurse Chan said with a smirk.</i><br>The same word order problem as above; I think that should be &quot;Oh, do they not?&quot;<br><br><i>Solvig had a giggle fit after that, and as soon she was able to control herself...</i><br>Shouldn’t this be &quot;... as soon as she was ...&quot;?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>That&#39;s pretty gooooood. <br>You did that whole connecting thing pretty well (though, to be fair, it&#39;s rather easy with PPC stuff)<br><br>Bit of spooky phrasing with &#39;Undoubtedly she had touched a chord, that never should had.&#39;<br>Y&#39;know.

            <p>Now with the phrasing... I think I had it with &quot;have&quot; before a beta changed it... Not sure, though. I&#39;ll think about it.<br><br>Now to the hunter... uh, what? Corinna comes from the equivalent of a 1930s-40s time, sexism was pretty common during those decades, almost you could say it was &quot;normal&quot;. The point is not that no one&#39;s going to miss the hunter because he was sexist, it was probably for another reason, that Nurse Chan probably thought it was best for Solvig not to know... <br><br>And that wasn&#39;t the point of the bit either, the point was to imply how <i>twisted</i> she had become, as she outright states that she <i>felt nothing</i>, when she killed him in a legitimate act of self-defense. In other words, it was to imply how desensitized to killing she had become by that point.</p>

            <p>You&#39;ve woven it into the narrative as a story a character is telling; why not treat it like part of the narrative? With the bold text it feels like the piece is flipping back and forth between two separate stories. It&#39;s harder to feel that the woman in the flashback story is the same person who&#39;s telling it to Solvig. <br><br>And, yeah, it does look like you&#39;re quoting a badfic. I spent half the story waiting for her to go from powerful to ridiculously OPd. <br><br>Aside from the formatting quibbles, though, this was a solid story. The emotional drama felt justified by what had happened, none of which was improbable and most of which was exciting and fun. It was a little hard for me to read because I&#39;m not all that familiar with <i>Pokèmon</i>, and I almost set the story aside a couple times, but always I wanted to find out what happened next, even when I wasn&#39;t fully understanding the details of who was fighting whom and what the Mystical Mew was exactly. <br><br>I had a couple of notes on SPaG, but they were minor and on this tiny smartphone screen  it&#39;s tricky to flip back and forth between tabs while keeping everything in order. There were one or two, neither of which ruined my enjoyment of the piece. <br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>They replaced both God and an angel. How awesome. Thank goodness it&#39;s dead.<br><br>Let&#39;s see... I noticed two misspellings, oddly both involving the letter L.<br>1) Bela. Did you meant Bella, as is in Bella Swan, here? Or are names pronounced as Bella just cursed?<br>2) &quot;... a knife would suddenly in his back.&quot; I&#39;m not quite sure how you would kill somebody by putting a would in their back.

Zeb&#39;s mouth is so foul. First meanie, and then jerk? Somebody needs their mouth washed out with soap. Also. how the two deal with having to kill a replacement of God. The actions and reactions are priceless. Awesome as ever.</p>

            <p>Specifically, with how Hop is a blatant near-carbon copy of the canon <i>Overwatch</i> character Tracer shoehorned into the PPC. The energetic personality, the Cockney accent, certain details about their appearance; heck, even their first names are the same! You went so far as to put an <i>Overwatch</i> quote on her <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Hop">Wiki page</a>!<br><br>I really don&#39;t like this. It feels like a transparent attempt to try and write a mashup of <i>Overwatch</i>/PPC fanfiction. What&#39;s more, it&#39;s lazy. Rather than come up with your own character, this feels like you&#39;ve took someone else&#39;s and barely made a token effort to file off the serial numbers.<br><br>I might be a bit more accepting if Hop were some sort of AU version of Tracer recruited to the PPC. I would still think it&#39;s a lazy choice, but I would understand it better. But apparently, this character is supposed to be from the <i>Doctor Who</i> universe? The actual universe, and not a badfic? I&#39;m sorry, but that stretches my suspension of disbelief too far. The two universes don&#39;t have anything to do with each other! It just seems like a very weak attempt to hide the fact that this isn&#39;t really your character. It&#39;s like if I made a new agent who was a teenage wizard with a scar on his face and an English accent, named him &quot;Harry McAndrews,&quot; then said he hailed from <i>Shadowrun</i>.<br><br>Another detail about this character that bothered me: her phonetic accent. There are times where it was overused to the point of being nearly unreadable. At other points, it swayed from Cockney to almost Scottish (like anytime you used &quot;aye&quot; for &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;me&quot; for &quot;my&quot;). The trick with using dialects like this is to use an easy hand (unless the joke is that their accent IS so thick as to be hard to understand).<br><br>As for the mission itself, it was generally okay. The biggest issue I had was that there was a lot of telling as opposed to showing. It all very well to say that &quot;Hip and Hop cringed on seeing the contradiction&quot; regarding the venom, but it isn&#39;t very interesting to read. What were their reactions? What did they say? Or later on, when Cinder Fall and her cronies were taken care of in one sentence. There&#39;s nothing that could have been shown about that?<br><br>The dialogue was probably the sharpest part of the mission. Each character&#39;s personality came off very well through it. The conclusion was also very good, with the agents being clever and taking advantage of the Stu&#39;s weakened state. That, for me, will always be better than a knock-down fight between agent and Stu/Sue.<br><br>A few minor things:<br>— I agree with HG in that your portrayal of the Shadow People was very amusing, even if the tilde speech got a little tiring for me after a while.<br>— Charge list was clean and to the point. Nice. I am not a fan of lists that stretch for over half a page.<br>— While the matter is often debated, I personally do not think that miscapitalized words like &quot;semblance&quot; should not result in minis. I think of it like this: say &quot;Harry Dresden&quot; out loud. Now say &quot;harry dresden&quot; out loud. Is there a difference? Then again, that&#39;s just me.<br><br>All in all, I would have liked the mission a lot more had Hop actually been an original character. If I want to read about Tracer, I&#39;ll go read <i>Overwatch</i> fanfiction. The PPC should be for the stuff that comes out of our heads, not what comes out of others&#39;.</p>

            <p>And I won&#39;t deny that Tracer was the primary inspiration for Hop...

            <p>A very solid piece. These new agents are fun and quirky -- what I&#39;m starting to realize is my favorite type of spinoff (which means it&#39;s time to completely rewrite my Permission prompts again! Whee!). The writing was solid, with plenty of funny moments. I liked the pacing when the C-CAD started smoking. And I could picture the action and understand more or less what was going on, despite being totally unfamiliar with <i>RWBY</i> (although I felt that I was missing a lot. TOS made me read LotR; one more RWBY mission will put me over the edge into needing to watch it).<br><br>I did sometimes want more description of their surroundings; you gave the minimum required to understand what was going on, which is okay but not awesome. I can follow and enjoy the story, but I&#39;m not immersed in it. If you have plenty of other things to work on, ignore this, but if you feel nicely accomplished at having created this lovely comedic duo and want another target, I recommend description. <br><br>--Key, in an airport at midnight because Delta Airlines screwed up. </p>

            <p>As for Hop&#39;s second song (yeah, she&#39;s going to have lots of these) it&#39;s a paraphrase of a short number from <i>The Collector</i>, which you can see right <a href="https://youtu.be/4bEaWJLaKpk?t=8m36s">[HERE]</a>; it&#39;s kinda jazzy, showgirl-esque song.<br><br>Thanks for the sharp eye!</p>

            <p>With Hip &amp; Hop making there mission debut at that!<br><br>Like William &amp; VJ, Hip &amp; Hop&#39;s interactions are something I feel should be a standard in PPC writings: Light hearted and comedic at times.<br><br>Going into the fic, was a tad disappointed you didn&#39;t use the joke I made in Discord about Blake and nicknames for her significant other. But that come from my own thought process, not your own. <br><br>The Stu was a strange something to behold, with the premise of the Stu becoming prehistoric beasts being something I find fits more comfortably in a SkarmorySilver work.

Frydor, whom I hope to god is free to use, was a welcomed addition, the cannon equally so.

            <p>Also, is it bad that when I first read the antics of this particular Stu, the first thing I thought of was that MLP one I took on last spring term?

            <p>I&#39;m just gonna repost a rant from tumblr here and hope people listen. The stuff referred to is specific to the G1 Transformers Fandom on Ao3, but it holds true pretty universally. The original poster is LadyDragon76 on Tumblr and Ao3.<br><br>&quot;I got stuff to get done so I’m gonna bang this out fast, please ignore any typos, but in light of that truly SAD nonsense on Ao3, I need all my babes and lovelies, friends, associates, and ships in the night in this fandom to know how much I ADORE and appreciate your imaginations.<br><br>First point.  Mary Sues are IMPORTANT.  Do I want to read other people’s any more at my age?  In general no.  But lovelings.  WRITE your Mary Sues, WRITE your self-inserts, LIVE your fantasies through your fiction.  PLEASE never stop.  It doesn’t matter if I want to read it, someone will.  Someone will LOVE it.  YOU will touch someone’s heart and soul, and GUESS WHAT.  I’m the writer I am today because I wrote a Mary Sue and people cheered me on and begged for more.  WRITE!<br><br>Second point, also a direct response to that post.  Mermaid and Humanization tropes ARE canon in Tranformers.  WRITE them.  Some of the most creative character pieces I’ve ever seen were humanized fics. (and I don’t just mean my own, though I am proud of that baby)  Please never stop.<br><br>G1 Seaspray became a merman.  G1 Roddy, Springer and Arcee became human.  It’s Canon, and even if it wasn’t, screw that jerk and all who share the view that we can’t unleash our imaginations in any and every direction we want to.  What unhappy toads such people must be to attempt to place rules and demands on the creative, derivative side of fandom.  Please creators, NEVER STOP.<br><br>Normally I would say don’t feed the trolls, but in this case I wanted to speak up. Nothing in that sad post hurt me, but I KNOW how those kinds of things can hurt others, and I want any of you who were hurt by it to hear me now, if I may be so egotistical as to offer advice unasked for:<br><br>Our fandom NEEDS ALL the crazy AUs we have.  Give me your humanized, your mers, your mary sues, you bugs, your harpies, your high school, your coffee shop, your war never happened, your EVERYTHING.  Give it to me in fic, in art, in meta, in crafts, in photocomics.  Give me impossible ships and the obvious ones.  Give me plot and give me pointless rambling fluff.  NEVER, NEVER, NEVER STOP.  Because the random entitled dipwit that actually believes they have the right to try to tell us what we’re ALLOWED to create never understood the genius of creative fandom to start with.  Don’t let that sort of blind, ignorant idiocy hold you back from sharing your soul with the rest of us.  I promise you, typos and bad formatting included, fandom NEEDS every last one of your creations. <br><br>NEVER STOP! &lt;3&quot;</p>

            <p>First off, what gives <i>you</i> the right to tell people what they should and should not write? Apparently the PPC is more Orwellian than we thought. Secondly, really? You&#39;re going to tell me you will criticize my writing, while committing several spelling and grammar errors yourself? You seriously need to rethink your approach. Third, let&#39;s have <a href="http://seananmcguire.tumblr.com/post/149018626205/hi-i-was-just-reading-your-defence-against-bad">another sample from Tumblr</a> wherein a rather famous author, beloved by much of the PPC, or at least the old guard, agrees with someone defending people writing Mary Sues, and says she hates the term. If you search through the notifications, you can also find your vary own VixenMage, one of the aforementioned old guard, <a href="http://vmthecoyote.tumblr.com/post/149032852287">agreeing as well</a>.<br>As for judging and killing OCs, I suppose you&#39;re right. After all, that&#39;s certainly happened to the PPC a few times, by authors who took umbrage with your activities.</p>

            <p>1) Assuming quality writing has an objective facet to it (kinda necessary if you don&#39;t want to delve into relativism, in which case you can kindly keep your unimportant subjective opinion to yourself), those who think they know good writing from bad have a right to say &quot;this I find bad, and this good&quot;.<br>Related to that: if you make something public, expect people to express their opinion about it. Not all opinions will be positive. Fact of life, deal with it.<br>2) PPC missions get beta&#39;d and should be of a fairly high writing standard. I&#39;d like to take this opportunity to remind people to please proofread their posts before they post them here (as per the Constitution).<br>3) Dunno who that author is, and I don&#39;t really care, either.

            <p>Aside from what your cohort pointed out about VixenMage&#39;s post and the issues with refusing the subjective nature of quality (your response to which, by the way, is incredibly rude), you are right. People are entitled to their opinions yes, but there are two main issues with what you&#39;re saying. Firstly, what Midnight Starr proposed wasn&#39;t voicing an opinion, it was telling people what they&#39;re allowed to do, like some kind of fandom police, which you claim you&#39;re not. Secondly, if your opinion is that someone should not be writing, maybe, in the interest of good etiquette, you should probably keep it to yourself.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not a relativist. I assume (and you have to either assume this or not — it&#39;s not provable) that &quot;truth&quot; is objective and the  same for all subjects. That&#39;s why I can say stuff like &quot;quality has an objective facet&quot;. &quot;Quality&quot; is distinct from &quot;taste&quot;; for (fiction) writing, it includes things such as &quot;correct SPaG&quot;, &quot;does not break suspension of disbelief&quot; and &quot;within reason, keeps characters in-character&quot;. <br>This is distinct from &quot;taste&quot; — &quot;I like this&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t like this&quot;. A possible reason for either is &quot;quality&quot;, but it&#39;s not the only reason; you can acknowledge that something is bad (ie of poor quality) but still like it (like the way people enjoy <i>The Room</i>).<br><br>As to the whole &quot;opinion&quot; thing — &quot;You shouldn&#39;t write X because it&#39;s bad&quot; is a valid opinion <i>and</i> something people should hear, especially if their writing is in the public space where others can see it; saying that you should keep such opinions to yourself is akin to telling people not to tell their neighbours not to leave garbage on the sidewalk. Of course, in the interest of good etiquette, you should do so in a polite way. <br>Saying that something is badly written and making fun of it among your own circle of friends isn&#39;t &quot;Fandom Police&quot;. &quot;Fandom Police&quot; is harassing artists who draw fanart the way you don&#39;t like to the point they try to commit suicide. Did any PPCer ever go to a Suethor and say, &quot;you should stop writing fanfic&quot;? No. Some PPCers do try to leave constructive criticism (to varying degrees of success) but going on and telling people to not write if they can&#39;t not write badfic is not what the PPC does. You can&#39;t tell people what to think or what to say; you can voice your displeasure yes, explain why things are bad yes, call law enforcement if the situation necessitates it, but you as a random person cannot and should not tell other people what to do.<br><br>And one last point: since you&#39;re a relativist, why are you even bothering other people by saying that your opinion has any merit? Theirs have just as much.</p>

            <p>They did. The second link in their post. &quot;Observations &amp; Frustrations&quot; is the title of VM&#39;s blog.<br><br>Also, re: point 1, I&#39;m not sure quality writing <i>is</i> objective? People disagree on what makes good writing all the time, and trying to enforce a certain set of rules for &quot;proper English&quot; (beyond &quot;can pass a third grade spelling level) seems to fall under the realm of linguistic prescriptivism, which is not typically a road one wants to go down. That way leads to ultimately throwing out most fandom terms (including &quot;Fandom&quot;) because they&#39;re &quot;made up&quot; or &quot;improper&quot;. (Also if you&#39;re not careful, down that path lies dismissing valid dialects, like AAVE and netspeak because they&#39;re not &quot;right&quot;)</p>

            <p>I invite you to consider who would want to conceal their IP address from us. Your average Suethor trying to troll? Unlikely - an IP address isn&#39;t exactly something that points to a specific person.<br>To my mind, it&#39;s far more likely to be someone who knows we could check their IP address against past posts and find at least a handle from that - that is, someone who has been banned from posting and is circumventing their ban. Therefore, whether or not Suvian is Toroll, I believe that the most likely conclusion is that they are a banned user, and therefore should have their posts removed.</p>

            <p>I dunno, I can appreciate their desire to be strongly anonymous even if they aren&#39;t a banned user; showing up here to discourse on why we might be terrible people is a risky thing to do, and there are communities on the internet that would take that as an invitation to do lots and lots of harass-y things.

            <p>Firstly, there&#39;s what I said above; the m.o. is the same, and there&#39;s more reason to believe it&#39;s a disgruntled ex-PPCer than some random Suethor.

We&#39;re the only community on the web to use that term; otherwise, it&#39;s just a name (and anyone using Tor is not going to use their name as their handle).<br><br>Secondly, the OP says they &quot;hope people will listen&quot;.

Rude, accusing without support, and, again, familiarity with PPC terms; all of these are characteristics of Toroll.<br><br>In conclusion, I find that it is overwhelmingly likely that &quot;Suvian&quot; is an alias for the person known as Toroll, or is another banned user playing copycat.<br><br>But I&#39;m not in charge, so I&#39;ll bow to the wisdom of the oldbies.</p>

            <p>With Desdendelle: just because a banned user returns with a good post, doesn&#39;t make them un-banned. So if (say) ZDimensia showed up with a deeply moving display of her love of a certain canon, the correct response would be for the Nameless Admin to point out that she was banned, and potentially delete the post.<br><br>With Seafarer: I think this looks like Toroll. I&#39;ve only seen one other person use a Tor wossname (assuming they were even a different person at all), and the general behaviour looks Toroll-y.<br><br>But I also agree with Sergio: since there&#39;s disagreement as to whether it is Toroll, and since the response has basically made any trolling attempt a failure, I think it should be left up unless something else happens.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Yes, Mary Sues are a vital part of growing into writing.

Neither do I think characters with common Suvian traits, e.g. having powers, being tragic, etc., are ALWAYS Sues.<br><br>Rather, I think Sues are a symptom of bad writing, which is why they can pop up in original fiction just as much as they can in fanfiction. All those Sueish traits can be used well with proper characterization and storytelling, and a self-insert can be written realistically, with humility and good humor. When the same traits are used as cheap tickets to audience investment, and when the self-insert is just a way for the author to stroke their own ego, THEN you get a Sue.<br><br>I know there have been a few rather sparkly agents here and there over the years, but since the PPC strives to write <i>well</i> as much as it strives to be entertaining, I do believe that keeps the number of Sue agents down.<br><br>(And, y&#39;know, I don&#39;t think any of my agents are Sues.

            <p>Sues are, essentially, bad writing. But everything that makes them Sues <i>can</i> be done well. That&#39;s essentially what July tried to do with St Dymphna&#39;s, and it went well enough (mostly). <br><br>But that&#39;s more or less what I mean. The PPC takes many of the elements of Sue-ness and makes them <i>work</i>, often (but not always) through satire. I think fandom would be poorer without Sues, without people writing over-the-top Speshul characters in their writing journeys (though, I will say I could do with …fewer, perhaps), but I also think fandom would be poorer without the writers who specialize in laughing at themselves each other and their fandom. Not just the PPC, but all satire. All Sue-and-bad slash-and-bad crossover-joking stories.<br><br>And, as has been said before, we&#39;re not here to -eradicate- that badfic. We&#39;re here to make ourselves and each other laugh. </p>

            <p>What the PPC does isn&#39;t bash escapist fantasies - I&#39;ve seen a Tumblr post claiming as such, and I disagree with that particular notion. Escapist fantasies ARE a critical step in the writing process, and OCs of any kind are, too, Suvian or otherwise. In many cases, the Suvian in question COULD be better written, they just needed the right kind of feedback to improve upon their characterization and how they fit into the world in question.<br><br>That being said, we primarily deal with badfic that&#39;s written terribly when the author is at the experience level where they SHOULD know better. Characters who are grossly overpowered in an upstart author&#39;s first fanfic are one thing; characters who are still grossly overpowered even after several years of writing fanfiction for a particular fandom or community are a different matter entirely. I guess it&#39;s true that Mary Sues are the most common first step in the process towards becoming a better writer, but it&#39;s also true that we need concrit like the PPC delivers to move forward.<br><br>And here&#39;s the most important part. Constructive criticism is just as vital as the presented work itself. If people just heap loads of praise on a badly-written character without thinking about how they fit into the lore or world they&#39;re supposed to be a part of, the character will never be able to grow out of said bad writing. If we ignore the mistakes the writer has made, said writer won&#39;t realize what they&#39;re doing wrong and continue following the misguided path they&#39;re on. So yes, creating a Suvian character is perfectly fine. But so is accepting feedback that could go a long way towards improving said character and making them more consistent with canon, or better written in general.<br><br>In short, I both agree and disagree with the OP here. I don&#39;t know who they are, and what they&#39;re doing here, but while I respect that they make a valid point, I feel that they should&#39;ve known what they were talking about before quoting a Tumblr post of all things. An added discussion of the post in question clarifying or countering some of its points would&#39;ve made it a lot more palatable.<br><br>I should also add that in many cases, the fics sporked by the PPC are badly written in a truly horrible or hilarious manner. We&#39;ve dealt with mediocre fics before, and we&#39;ve felt that they&#39;re decent enough albeit in need of a little extra effort on the part of the author. But if your fic has Indiana Jones gain the ability to fly, without any sensible canon explanation, by <i>shoving an MacGuffin up his butthole</i> (yes, I went there), then you have no excuse.</p>

            <p>Now that I actually feel competent writing this, here&#39;s my thoughts.<br><br>Everyone&#39;s entitled to their own opinions. I thank you for your input. I believe that we can always learn something new from the thoughts of others, and that at the very least, I&#39;ll try to do that. You&#39;ve given us another point of view, and people can always take something away from that. There&#39;s pieces that you like, and pieces that you don&#39;t like. To my knowledge, this isn&#39;t a hate group, where we just go into fanfiction to kill characters that we don&#39;t like, though possibly some people within and outside our community think so. Personally, I have not seen elements of the former. True, imagination is an excellent thing, but sometimes, it can be perverted, like when the Imagination Nexus became the Maelstrom. That parable is a lighter and softer version of what I think is actually happening, however. There are very depraved things happening in fanfiction sometimes. Now, the previous statement is very much YMMV. My concept of depravity could be very different from yours. For example, some people think torture is a beautiful art, but I think it&#39;s despicable. It&#39;s all a matter of what floats your boat. This community is about preventing bad writing, and having fun while we&#39;re at it. The thing is, bad writing is objective, just like whether the death penalty is wrong or not. Of course, someone&#39;s going to argue against my point. I should be fine with that, because everyone&#39;s entitled to their own opinion.<br><br>If you have read this, thank you for listening to my thoughts.<br><br>TL;DR: &quot;Freedom is the Right of all Sentient Beings&quot; can be interpreted in many ways, because &quot;Freedom&quot; is a wild card.</p>

            <p>The vast majority of fanfiction contains Sues in one way or another, so the character type&#39;s association with bad writing was unavoidable.  Sues are symptoms of bad writing, but bad writing itself, and bad writing <i>in general</i>, are what the PPC community addresses in missions.  A disproportionate amount of missions involve Sues because, again, that&#39;s the shape of fanfiction.  But missions are more about pointing out what works vs. what doesn&#39;t work in the story.<br><br>But, of course, the real topic here isn&#39;t Sues themselves, but whether writing them is &quot;okay&quot; for authors.  And quite honestly, that argument is irrelevant in this community; we don&#39;t inform badfic authors of missions into their stories, and we certainly don&#39;t attempt to dissuade anyone from writing anything.  Missions exist only as part of the fictional setting of PPC HQ.  If a fanfiction renaissance ripped across the internet overnight tonight, and fanfiction quality took a huge upturn, I myself (and probably many other writers in this community) would craft artificial badfics to send my agents into, as a backdrop to my own continuing plot lines.  The badfics aren&#39;t the point; the points are our characters&#39; growth under strain, our intertextual cooperation between authors in our community to build stronger stories and a stronger setting, and our ability to find humor in bizarre moments we came across when looking at fanfiction on the internet.<br><br>Now, for some thoughts that are more distinctly my own than the general community attitudes above.  Firstly, in the original post, ladydragon76 mentions, &quot;I promise you, typos and bad formatting included, fandom NEEDS every last one of your creations.&quot;  Learning correct spelling, punctuation and formatting (and, most of all, learning to DOUBLE-CHECK one&#39;s work—I&#39;ve made numerous typos so far in this post, but I backspaced and corrected them immediately after I saw them) are important in real life, not just in fun writing.  I frequently get texts or written notes from coworkers filled with chatspeak, abbreviations, typos and incorrect grammar that confuse me and slow down my ability to respond or carry out instructions.  It&#39;s imperative that all young people growing up now learn correct writing format in order to communicate effectively in their future careers.  Learning those tools, and putting them to good use in fanfiction, will only help them down the road.  Disregarding the rules of writing only teaches bad habits they will need to unlearn as adults.<br><br>Secondly, while writing fanfiction is fun, I personally wouldn&#39;t bother with it if I wasn&#39;t going to put my every greatest effort into it, and make the final product as perfect and professional as I could.  To put it more generally, there&#39;s no point in doing something if I&#39;m not going to do it <i>right</i>.  As an admin on our wiki, and one of our active members working to make backup copies of older works for future rehosting, I treat my PPC hobby with as much careful attention to detail as I do my actual, paying career.  This is because, while I do them for &quot;fun&quot; (or at least, working on them and being able to show quality results makes me feel accomplished and valuable), &quot;fun&quot; does not mean shoddy or quick work, but rather complete, professional efforts I can be proud of.  I see no reason to expect any less from anyone else.<br><br>—doctorlit, letting his philosophy show a bit</p>

            <p>That hadn&#39;t occurred to me. These posts seem to be motivated very differently. Suvian is identifying themself with a consistent username, and appears to be trying to convince us we are wrong rather than trying to incite chaos the way Toroll did. They appear to be attempting civil debate and logic, rather than merely cackling like a villain in a children&#39;s movie. If this is Toroll, they&#39;ve changed a lot. I think they&#39;re a different person. It might be worth it to engage with this one; I think there&#39;s a chance they could be <s>assimilated</s> persuaded of our cause. <br><br>--Key has seen troll-like people convinced before</p>

            <p><img src="http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2013/11/thank-you-for-your-input.gif"><br><br>---<br><br>Right, now that the sarcasm&#39;s out of the way, have a measured response to your points that&#39;s largely in line with the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Other_People">FAQ</a><br><br>1) Writing Mary Sues is not an important step. It&#39;s a largely <i>unavoidable</i> one. A Mary Sue character, according to the definition we use here, is one that makes the entire story about themselves, being the centre of attention, and twisting the universe of the original work and the characters within it purely to sate the author&#39;s fantasies. A Mary Sue is a character you should try and <i>avoid</i> writing, and while it&#39;s good practice to learn from your mistakes, LD76 saying they&#39;re the author they are today because of all the Mary Sues they wrote is like me saying I&#39;m a good pinball machine repairwoman because of all the times I screwed up some simple wiring jobs and made a valuable mid-&#39;60s Gotty start belching smoke from its motor board.<br><br>2) AUs are not inherently bad things. In fact, the PPC is in favour of good AU stories! Our general ethos is less about rigid canon compliance and more about what Huinesoron of this parish terms canon-<i>friendliness</i>. Put it like this: if you&#39;re writing an interesting AU in which the Lord of the Rings is crossed over with, ooh, I dunno, Mass Effect or something, and everyone&#39;s in character and acting like the people they are in the source material, then we don&#39;t have a problem with it and will indeed praise it to the skies. Conversely, if you get a lot of trivia right but Aragorn wanders around acting like an entitled twerp with a broom up his back passage, then we are going to have a problem with it.<br><br>3) So lots of people like your terrible Mary Sue fanfiction. If I may be blunt, <i>so what</i>? Lots of people like Burger King food, myself included. That doesn&#39;t make it healthy. Like I said above, writing Suefic is largely unavoidable when you&#39;re starting out; you just learn how not to do it and write <i>better</i> OCs and have a <i>better</i> grasp of the canon characters and how they operate. That doesn&#39;t make writing Suvian characters good.<br><br>4) There are doubtless some people out there who view themselves as fandom police, and these people are rightly viewed as really, really strange. <i>We are not those people</i>. It&#39;s SOP around here not to tell badfic authors that the PPC has sporked their work, nor do we leave nasty comments. The PPC is, at heart, an organization dedicated to crafting constructive criticism in a way that at least tries to be funny. Neshomeh&#39;s missions are a great example of this if you want to check them out.<br><br>5) Since there is no chance in hell of you having read this far, happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp. =]<br><br>6) There is no point six.</p>

            <p>My points referred to our community&#39;s conduct - a community, incidentally, of which Tumblr user flyingcondors does not appear to be a part. I am more than welcome to be proven wrong on this, so if you&#39;re reading, do say hello. We are not responsible for the actions of those outside our group, and if you <i>do</i> have a problem with specific Boarders or people claiming to be a part of the PPC then I strongly urge you to name and shame. We are not a harassment organization, and we take that <i>extremely</i> seriously.<br><br>Problem is, you aren&#39;t arguing in good faith. At all. Nothing you&#39;ve said in the post to which I am replying has the slightest basis in fact. You are not arguing in good faith, so there&#39;s really no point in responding to you further.</p>

            <p>I disagree, to a point, but in the interest of providing full context to those wondering what&#39;s going on, look <a href="http://ladydragon76.tumblr.com/post/148371572085/never-stop">here</a> and look up Alex Anaheim&#39;s &quot;open letter to the fandom&quot;. I lost the link unfortunately, but basically the dude was being extremely rude and ranted about how AUs and Mary Sues were &quot;ruining the fandom&quot; (Which, for those not in the TF fandom, let me tell you it&#39;s been &quot;ruined&quot; by everything from Beast Wars to fans writing official comics) and how if he saw one more he would gouge his eyes out.<br><br>I expect this was posted here because honestly his attitude echoed somee of the same ones that have been put on display here. Apparently I was wrong when I told PC he was overestimating how little people care about us.</p>

            <p><i>Any shred of dignity <b>Ricard</b> had left went down the drain when he took his still sheathed swordstick and waved it at the mini, to the latter’s glee.</i><br>Who’s Ricard? A mini-Agent?<br><br><i>The dummy <b>had</b> also <b>take</b> another appearance once the Wraith <b>took</b> possession of it.</i><br>That’s a weird sentence. The correct past perfect would be &quot;had taken&quot;. But since the dummy taking a new appearance happened either while or after (not before) the Wraith taking possession of it, you need either past tense or past perfect in both cases or, if you want different tenses, should shift them around: &quot;The dummy also took another appearance once the Wraith had taken possession of it. &quot; <br><br>Do you intentionally treat the unbelievable hair and whining eyes like they are persons (<i>who</i> should actually be &quot;which&quot; in both cases)? In a weird way, it works for me.<br><br><i>‘She just transfers [...] if that’s her level in English,” she said ...</i><br>There’s the mismatched quotation mark Anonymous mentioned.<br><br><i>Marina grunted, <b>slipping</b> through more pages of the manga to find scenes confirming this.</i><br>Are you sure you got the right word? You may have meant &quot;flipping&quot;.<br><br><i>Complete with a cable linking the Sue and <b>him</b>.</i><br>I’m confused. Why is the cable linking the Sue and Richard? Or is it meant to link the Sue and the bird? Why is the bird male?<br><br><i>... he hissed, <b>her</b> face getting more and more angry with every word.</i><br>Did Richard suddenly turn female?<br><br><i>How bad it is?</i><br>Should be &quot;How bad is it?&quot;<br><br><i>Did you ever <b>heard</b> about the internet version of trolls?</i><br>Should be &quot;hear&quot; (infinitive).<br><br><i>... in the sole purpose of stirring up hate, wouldn’t it?” <b>S</b>he said ...</i><br>Since the sentence that started with part of what she said, is continued with &quot;she said, looking mildly annoyed&quot;, &quot;she&quot; should not be capitalized. (Yes, even when she said more than one sentence.)<br><br><i>Plan work better when people know how they work.</i><br>Shouldn’t this be &quot;Plans&quot; (plural)?<br><br><i>“I guess that would <b>work,”she</b> went back to the Sue and the other characters discussing ...</i><br>There is at least a space missing.

            <p>However, both of them are traditional JRPGs (which I&#39;ve recently found myself being terribly slow to complete) on consoles (when I far prefer handhelds for their portability), and my backlog is sufficiently large that I&#39;m not keen on getting more games right now (I don&#39;t ever want to go over 20 unfinished games again).<br><br>(Plus my brain keeps saying &quot;fireemblemfireemblemfireemblemfireemblem...&quot;)</p>

            <p>Excellent choice! Which title are you playing at the moment? I&#39;m currently halfway through the Conquest plotline of <i>Fates</i>. It&#39;s really a pain, since I am firmly a Hoshido supporter (aside from the obvious Revelation-is-the-best-outcome) and that the flimsy excuses that are thrown up to support the invasion of Hoshido are... nonsensical to say the least. <br><br>Then again, the writing in <i>Fates</i> isn&#39;t exactly stellar so...</p>

            <p>Yeah, the writing&#39;s bad. <i>Twilight</i>-level bad, in some cases (the worship of the royals springs to mind).<br><br>It&#39;s really a shame that they didn&#39;t do a better job of making the two routes more morally ambiguous, rather than black-and-white. Conquest has some fantastic maps, though. Right now, I&#39;m doing second runs on Normal to practise my class routing for higher difficulties.

On the Hoshido side of the border, it&#39;s Oboro while it&#39;s a tossup between Benny and Ignatius on the Nohr side. <br><br>All three of them can pretty much be airlifted to a hot zone and do considerable damage to anything that dares attack them.

            <p>So... Takumi and Niles. <i>Especially</i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiS8tIlw0Sc">Niles</a>. And then Midori with a Killer Bow and Spendthrift... &quot;My diagnosis?

            <p>And as such, I have only played FE13 and 14, with the latter being my favourite entry in the series (pathwise, Revelation.

            <p>No, there&#39;s no shame in only having played those two. I&#39;m not elitist (unless you haven&#39;t beaten Lunatic+ Awakening; then you&#39;re just a noob.) :-p<br><br>Honestly, Conquest without DLC <i>is</i> true Fire Emblem. It&#39;s probably the best in the series from a gameplay perspective; Attack and Guard Stance really added to it, especially since the enemy can do it too.<br><br>A lot of people will tell you that Blazing Sword is the greatest Fire Emblem game evar and you&#39;re a noob if you haven&#39;t played it... but I haven&#39;t played it, so I wouldn&#39;t know. I got Sacred Stones through the 3DS Ambassador Programme way back when, though, and it&#39;s pretty good. It has very similar grinding opportunities to Awakening, so it&#39;s overall pretty easy, too.<br><br>As for Shadow Dragon (which is also on Wii U VC), it&#39;s a remake of the first game in the series, and they pretty much decided to only update the graphics. I&#39;d only recommend that one if you&#39;re really hardcore into the series. (never play fe1 it is seriously terrible)<br><br>(Wait you have a Wii U I thought I was the only one :-D)</p>

            <p>What I like:<br><br>-It <i>looks</i> like Paper Mario. I love how the characters&#39; bodies behave like actual pieces of paper, I love the environment design, and I love the vibrancy of the colours here. Check.<br>-The dialogue and atmosphere are done right. Not much else to say here. Check.<br>-Breakdancing pig. Unexpected check.<br><br><br>What I dislike:<br><br>-THE CARDS THAT REPLACE THE ATTACKS UUUUUUGH<br>-No partners. The old turn-based battles made full use of each partner&#39;s strengths and weaknesses and forced you to be tactical about your choice; their absence makes combat a little bit more dull.<br>-Battle mechanics look repetitive and tedious. However, you have that colour meter thing that limits the use of certain attacks— this could prove to be interesting. Furthermore, if you only have access to a limited range of cards while on the offensive, that could force the player to develop some strategies...<br>-No obvious level-up system: why bother fighting enemies? What&#39;s the point if you don&#39;t get stronger as a character?<br>-ATTACK CARDS<br>-Seems to have an over-reliance on the colour hammer gimmick to make the thing interesting.<br>-Level-based world. Please, no, give us an open world again.<br>-Toads. Toads everywhere— the old entries in the series had a greater variety of friendly NPCs: Bomb-omb folk, Koopas, Paratroopas, Goombas, Boos, Doogans, Mowz, you name it. Their appearances made the world feel that much more alive, y&#39;know?<br><br><br>Verdict:<br><br>I have mixed feelings. I <i>want</i> it to be good. What has been shown has some promise and could make the game fun on its own— but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to call this a proper PM game. The spectre of the dreaded Sticker Star looms above this title, casting a shadow of doubt over this entry.<br><br>I&#39;ll need to see the full release to make a decision.<br><br><br>As for Fire Emblem... Shigure singing? I&#39;ll have to see that. Is it really Matt Mercer singing, though? After his recent appearance as everybody&#39;s favourite fan-hammering, flashbang-slinging, <a href="https://youtu.be/SPBUB42DoUE?t=52s">time telling Hero from Overwatch</a> I can&#39;t wrap my head around the concept of this guy voicing <i>Shigure</i>, of all people.<br><br></p>

            <p>IVs have always seemed yo me to be genes; heritable limitations on the upper limits of a Pokémon&#39;s power (as opposed to EVs, which represent training/practice). Hence, increasing an IV would require modification of the Pokémon&#39;s DNA in every cell in its body. This honestly seems rather painful.<br><br>Besides, making IVs just another number that you can increase kinda takes away from the uniqueness of Pokémon&#39;s system. There&#39;s no longer any practical variation between individuals within a species (other than natures, but I bet there&#39;ll be a way to change those in short order...)</p>

            <p>Just kidding. <br><br>I was really a fan of the turn-based style of the first two entries in the series— and the timing attack combat mechanics that went with them. Actual combat strategy was a thing and I felt that the game wasn&#39;t being overshadowed by too many gimmicks. TTYD refined what made <i>Paper Mario</i> a great game and thus turned it into one of my all-time favourites.<br><br>SPM was okay, but I missed the turn-based combat of the previous games. <br><br>And we don&#39;t speak of <i>Sticker Star</i>. Nope. Not ever.</p>

            <p>It was story-light, had a limited amount of times you could use an attack, and everyone was painfully generic. And bosses could be defeated in about 3 seconds flat if you had the right Thing sticker. It did have some good ideas, and the Enigmansion was good, but the game as a whole was poorly executed and very un-Paper Mario. </p>

            <p>Mario levelled up, gained companions, explored large worlds filled with NPCs, and the game actually had a concrete plot and chapters had interesting twists: for example, the Glitz Pit and Excess Express chapters in TTYD and the Shy Guy toybox of PM1 stand out in particular. It was fun-- and your companions made the ride even more memorable. <br><br>SPM was a platformer/RPG hybrid. Not a terrible game-- I actually like it-- but I wanted a bit more focus on the RPG side of things. <br><br>With Sticker Star, we have none of the above. No levelling up, combat is entirely item-based, no companions, no complex plot like the previous instalments, no open world to explore. I was promised an RPG-- instead, I felt cheated. </p>

            <p>Hey! I&#39;m Tesseract, and I&#39;m new, I guess. I&#39;ve read the Constitution, and I&#39;m obsessed with Harry Potter, all PJO, and a little bit of LotR. I got to the PPC wiki by searching &quot;the worst fanfiction&quot; on Google. This lead to the Legendary Badfics page, where I was scarred by the Little Miss Mary/Rose Potter missions.

            <p>At the end of a chain of events, I ended up with ownership of the PPC&#39;s Discord channel (which can be found <a href="https://discord.gg/puWCA">here</a>). I think that it definitely needs a mod since it&#39;s the most active in what&#39;s the wee hours of the night for me. How do we go on about this? Elections? Someone volunteers? Something else entirely?<br><br>PS: If anybody has duplicate nicknames on the channel, please tell me so I&#39;ll be able to kick the dupes (in the interest of an orderly user list).</p>

            <p>Main reason is that we vote over everything else important, so why not this?<br><br>After that, there&#39;s the question of what the mod powers actually are.

That sort of thing might even need to happen on the Board for clarity&#39;s sake.<br><br>The mods are there, I think, for fast-acting deescalation of unconstitutional things with warnings, then kicks, then if someone un-kicks themselves and keep behaving badly, a short ban.<br><br>Now, there&#39;s the question of who to give kick/ban rights to. I would nominate Iximaz, since she&#39;s in chat a lot and I figure she&#39;s a sane, level-headed person who would be responsible with these sort of powers.</p>

            <p>If we&#39;re going to have an election, we need people campaigning. Here&#39;s my speech: . <br><br>I&#39;m not a PG. I don&#39;t even have Permission -- because I&#39;ve been working and reworking the concept for my spinoff since March (Larfen can vouch that this is approximately true), looking at the same two characters from different angles and in different scenarios. I don&#39;t like to do anything hastily, which is a good quality in a mod: I won&#39;t ban people willy-nilly. <br><br>But lest you think me a wimp who will let trolls slide by, I am an adamant rule-follower. For instance, I believe I have adhered perfectly to the Constitution during my five months here. If you want another example, one of my agent bios is just about finished and I would be happy to post it; I worked hard to make sure he fit the rules of PPC canon and can field any and all questions.<br><br> I will  ban a user after all other methods of de-escalation have been tried -- steps which might look something like this: once one or more parties have been established to be behaving irrationally and/or rudely, asking them to take a break (politely, or course). If they refuse to comply, I would begin with a temporary ban (if the software allows), and if they are still causing problems after their enforced holiday, a permanent ban. Of course, with particularly egregious violations such as a user threatening harm, some of these steps may be skipped, and the community will probably have to convene to discuss the incident. <br><br>The above is not intended as a proposal for a specific system for banning users, but rather as an illustration of what I think being a mod means (maybe I should&#39;ve gone for some rhetoric about upholding the spirit of the community, but that kind of warm-fuzzy-make-everyone-feel-superior politics nauseates me a little bit. Which is probably why I tend to lose elections. I believe in fairness, how about that? It&#39;s true and should be deducible from my above descriptions of how I would behave as a mod).<br><br>Perhaps most importantly, I&#39;m on the channel fairly frequently -- not constantly, but often, especially at the times Des isn&#39;t on. Sometimes I lurk, sometimes I post, but I downloaded the Discord app just so I could get notifications for this channel. <br><br>I hope you, the Protectors of the Plot Continuum, find me worthy of this responsibility.<br><br>I&#39;m Key, and I approve this message. </p>

            <p>I recommend rotating moderators. Give three or four people a slot on a rotating schedule of mod-powers, to be changed out once a month or something like that.

            <p>That sounds needlessly complicated, and there&#39;s little point in mods if you don&#39;t trust them. Letting three fourths of the room overrule the mod means exactly that, and frankly I wouldn&#39;t want the job if the channel-goers wouldn&#39;t be willing to trust my judgement. (As it happens, I have the job anyway, but nobody told me my judgement shouldn&#39;t be trusted. So.)</p>

            <p>If you don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea, don&#39;t take it - no harm no foul. <br><br>Essentially, I think it&#39;s easy for mods and not-mods (ie, the rest of the population) to eventually get out of sync (on what rules should be, how they should be enforced) and wind up with different values. If this is left unresolved for long periods of time, it leads to a huge split, wherein both parties feel wronged by the system.<br><br>I do think putting one person indefinitely in charge of any amount of people is a bad idea for that reason - despite the best of intentions, sooner or later it gets tiresome, and then there&#39;s Drama. Regardless of who it is. What if you feel that someone is being offensive in stating their opinion*, but the rest of the channel disagrees? If you kick them off the channel, for a small or long period of time, people will start wondering &quot;If that&#39;s all it takes, who&#39;s next?&quot;<br><br>I know this sounds like over-complicating things. But if you don&#39;t set up a way to spread authority for rule-enforcing around the population, sooner or later the discontent will set in, and fester, and that never turns out well. That&#39;s why we have The Nameless Admin - so that doesn&#39;t happen here. Nobody is &quot;in charge,&quot; and elections for new PGs are semi-regular. It&#39;s always better to be prepared. <br><br><br>*If this sounds like a stretch, consider the following scenarios. A PPCer who is from the West Bank. A PPCer who believes, staunchly, in Mao and Stalin era communism. A PPCer who believes - and this is the one that would disqualify me from Permanent Mod Status - that the recent US shootings were faked. See what I mean?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure if inertia is an appropriate way to select a leader; The Nameless Admin has always seemed to me to be a janitorial position.

            <p>&quot;Writing/PPC-understanding ability&quot; is selling the position of Permission giver a bit short.

            <p>For one, I don&#39;t see PGs as deciding who <i>can</i> write for the PPC so much as who <i>can&#39;t</i>. I realise that sounds like semantics, but to my mind, the default assumption is that most people <i>will</i> get Permission. We should be a filter for the bad stuff, not an exam board only the best will pass.<br><br>Does that make us a form of moderators? Ehh... at that point it really <i>would</i> be arguing semantics. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonable to assume &#39;trust us to say what&#39;s good writing&#39; translates to &#39;trust us to say what&#39;s an acceptable topic of conversation&#39;.<br><br>As to your second point: I vehemently disagree. In fact, a claim of that nature is what led to GreyLadyBast leaving the PPC - she was told she should act to a higher standard, because she was a PG and a respected figure. She took it very badly. Just because we&#39;ve been voted into a position of mild authority, does not mean we have a responsibility to be an example.<br><br>Upholding the Constitution is everyone&#39;s responsibility, and it&#39;s no more mine than it is InvokerTheElementalist&#39;s. We were selected by the community to do a specific job; we have an obligation to do that job as best we can.

            <p>While I agree with what you say about it being everyone&#39;s responsibility to uphold the Constitution, I do think there&#39;s more to PGing than just knowing good writing from bad. Theoretically, <i>everyone</i> in the PPC should know that. It&#39;s why we&#39;re all here.<br><br>We were chosen rather than anyone else not just because we know a period from a hole in the ground, not just because of PPC knowledge, but also because people <i>trust</i> us to make fair judgements and not be jerks. At least, that&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking about when it comes time to elect new PGs.<br><br>The fact is, we&#39;ve earned the respect of the community, and whether you like it or not, that means they <i>do</i> look to us as examples of what to do and how to behave. You may have noticed that if we do things in our stories, other people tend to want to try them, too, yes? And you can bet that if we stopped respecting the Constitution ourselves, it wouldn&#39;t be long before everyone else stopped, too.<br><br>It may be, at least as far as you and I are concerned, that this has more to do with us as oldbies than us as PGs, but it&#39;s not a coincidence that the two often go together. It&#39;s not much good electing someone as PG if they&#39;re just going to wander off in a month or so, and you don&#39;t earn the trust of a community overnight anyway, so we&#39;ve also picked people who have been around for awhile and look as though they&#39;ll be around a while more. It&#39;s all entangled together.<br><br>And furthermore, we don&#39;t deny permission solely based on writing skill, either. We block people who behave badly enough to hurt the community, too, because—as we&#39;re so fond of saying—we&#39;re a community first. We don&#39;t want people playing in our sandbox if we don&#39;t trust them not to pee in it. Therefore, we DO have to be judges of character and appropriateness. See above point about people trusting our fairness and good natures.<br><br>Now, whether that extends to dictating that we MUST moderate everything, everywhere, is another question. I think it&#39;s quite fair to say that&#39;s not what we signed up for, so we shouldn&#39;t be forced into broad moderation if we don&#39;t want to do it.

            <p>I can&#39;t argue with most of your points, but:<br><br><i>You may have noticed that if we do things in our stories, other people tend to want to try them, too, yes?</i><br><br>Not yes. The most-copied person I&#39;ve noticed is Tawaki, who&#39;s not a PG. On the flipside, I haven&#39;t noticed strong trends of people spinning off ideas from Phobos, or PoorCynic, or VixenMage (or sundry others).

Though, as you say, it&#39;s all very much tangled together.<br><br>And: <i>We block people who behave badly enough to hurt the community, too, because—as we&#39;re so fond of saying—we&#39;re a community first.</i><br><br>Again, not really how I&#39;d put it. Mostly people are denied permission because they haven&#39;t contributed enough. It&#39;s not our job as PGs to decide whether they&#39;re harmful - that&#39;s a matter for the Constitution, and so for the Board at large. On occasion, a Permission thread has turned into a Constitution thread, but that doesn&#39;t make it the same thing.<br><br>Yes, there is an element of character judgement in being a Permission Giver. But it&#39;s a minor part compared to the writing/PPC parts, and I&#39;m uncomfortable with the suggestion - discussed almost entirely by Permission Givers themselves - that being elected a PG means you&#39;d make a good moderator.<br><br>Because I know I certainly wouldn&#39;t.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>a) Being a PG means the community trusts you, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t have voted for you.<br>b) Moderation is similar in that regard — a community should trust its mods.<br>c) Mods should be answerable to the community. Not in the overly-complicated way VM suggested; rather, if a mod ...s up, they should be told as much. We don&#39;t need (and can&#39;t implement in the channel, due to technical limitations) something like &quot;three-fourths of a room can overrule a mod&quot;; we need the mods to exercise common sense and decency just like everybody else. <br>d) I&#39;m not going to force mod-ship on anybody. Aside from not wanting to, it&#39;s not like I can force someone to use their own mod permissions, can I now?<br>e) Shouldn&#39;t the channel-goers start nominating people?<br>f) Assuming nothing happens till next week, I&#39;ll give all PG users on the channel (except Iximaz, who seems to not want to be a mod) — that is, PC and Delta Juliette — mod rights; if/when mods are elected, I&#39;ll remove their mod rights (unless, of course, they are elected mods anyway).</p>

            <p>Sorry for not commenting on that. It feels so incomplete that I don&#39;t know where to start, and I can&#39;t take responsibility for linking this as a completed mission on the Wiki. I recommend to rewrite, paying much more attention to what the readers need to know so that they can understand what&#39;s going on (starting with why Kelly needs a new Partner and what happened to September, and maybe you should have told Djinn&#39;s backstory before you send it on a mission).<br><br>Also sorry for being so late.

            <p>Right, so, your point (a very spooky point, indeed) is that magic can be considered a form of science, the application of which is then technology, in itself. <br><br>Comes down to the definition of magitek itself, then, whether it&#39;s magic comparable to technology, or (as I envision it) a marriage of naturalistic and magical principles, being a sort of sci-fi-fantasy horrific hybrid chimera monstrosity. <br><br>Tv Tropes notes that part of the nature of magitek is that magic is combined with something &#39;distinctively mechanical,&#39; which, you could argue supports my definition, but, then again, Tv Tropes is always so terribly cloudy with all this stuff, I&#39;m half expecting the site to collapse into raindrops. <br>I found another definition on some slang dictionary called Lingomash which says that magitek is &#39;any machinery that uses magic to function, or can manipulate magic,&#39; but what the hell is Lingomash, right? <br>Machines are defined as &#39;an apparatus using mechanical power and having several parts, each with a definite function and together performing a particular task.&#39; which certainly seems naturalistic to me. <br>Everything else just links over to Final Fantasy 6. Could find more, but I&#39;m not writing a bloody essay over here, for heavens sake! Having a casual discussion over the internet! <br><br>So, then, my thoughts are, then, that a golem, composed of a statue driven by magic, lacks that mechanical/naturalistic part (statues being not particularly mechanical,) and is therefore just magic. Y&#39;know, like wands, and enchanted swords, or magic rings. <br><br>My argument is filled with more holes than a beehive and I can&#39;t wait for it to be ripped apart. </p>

            <p>My search on technology came up with &quot;Technology (&quot;science of craft&quot;, from Greek τέχνη, techne, &quot;art, skill, cunning of hand&quot;; and -λογία, -logia) is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation.&quot;* Based on that, technology means that you have a tool that can accomplish it&#39;s intended objective. I&#39;d say that if magic is consistent, meaning that the same grunts and hand gestures will always net you the same fireball every time, you have a technology. The Elven Rings of power are a technology, in that they successfully preserved the Elves that lived in Arda. <br><br>On a tangent, science isn&#39;t evidence based on a hypothesis, it&#39;s a hypothesis based on evidence. If my ice beam defies the laws of thermodynamics, too bad. Go back to the drawing board. If I start floating 5 inches off the ground, no scientist has a right to stop me fom breaking their &quot;law&quot; of gravity. It&#39;s not actually a law, because you only think that everything must follow that rule. If it turns out its false, you should be overjoyed, because that&#39;s new knowledge. At least, that&#39;s what I think should happen. I haven&#39;t actually walked in a scientist&#39;s shoes yet.**<br><br>* Note: I should probably take what Wikipedia says with a grain of salt, but I&#39;ll take my chances.<br><br>** No, I&#39;m not implying that I have levitated in a Scientist&#39;s shoes, either.***<br><br>*** No, I&#39;m not a human being that can levitate.****<br><br>**** Yes, I am actually human, and not a panini press, though I do like paninis.</p>

            <p>I mean, not that I <i>understand</i> time travel that well, but apparently there&#39;s two types: one that can&#39;t change the past at all, and one that lights up an entirely new timeline.

            <p>I have realized that actual gameplay is very different from the dialogue and worldbuilding. Namely, almost every single class uses mana to perform their skills. It is because of that and the fact only one person has come forward saying they are mana-impaired that I jumped to the conclusion that anyone could use magic, and only a fraction of the population can&#39;t.<br><br>The following is the most complete text available ingame about how the world&#39;s magic works. It is very different compared to actual gameplay. Make of it what you will.<br><br>Magic on Lore <br>Magic on Lore is contained in ley lines, which run across and through the planet like haphazardly-placed latitude and longitude lines. Where these ley lines intersect, there are nexuses of magic which act as reservoirs. There are two central ley lines: the Verix, running North-South, and the Horix, running East-West. To perform feats of magic, a mage must draw on the magic contained in one of Lore&#39;s ley lines or nexuses. <br><br>Drawing from Ley Lines <br>The largest nexuses is the core of the planet; it contains the most pure magic available, and is centered where the Verix overlaps the Horix. There is no single mage strong enough to tap into this nexus, though it is rumored the Blue Mage or the Mad Weaponsmith have not revealed the full extent of their power, and they will neither confirm or deny their ability to utilize the central nexus. Normal nexuses and ley lines can be tapped into and drawn from safely, in controlled amounts. <br><br>As yet, no regular mage has been known to draw directly from the Core. Doing so would be like tapping a person&#39;s heart to draw blood: the pressure of the flow of blood/magic escaping would be overwhelming. <br><br>The magician would be flooded with pure magic, overcome in a deluge of power which would burn through their physical, mental, and magical veins. Their stores of mana - magical will and stamina - would be destroyed. They would be &quot;burnt out&quot; and lose the ability to perform magic... and their lives. <br><br>Severing another mage&#39;s connection to the ley lines IS possible, but dangerous. The potential for lashback - which would negatively affect the severing mage - is enormous. Most choose not to risk it. <br><br>Nexuses as Portals <br>Nexuses, formed where two or more ley lines cross, do not only act as reservoirs of magic on Lore; they can also be portals to the para-elemental plane of magic. On rare occasions, mages can directly transport themselves to the plane through the manipulation of these portals. <br><br>You may have encountered one of these portals in Lore already. Legend has it that if a magus looks inside themself and follows the pull of a focus stone, they will be led towards the nearest nexus. In that respect, it is both focus stone and lodestone. <br><br>While ley lines are fine for everyday magical needs, if the spell you are attempting requires massive amounts of magic, it would be wise to situate yourself near a nexus. The availability of extra power could mean the difference between life and death. IF you&#39;re strong enough to channel it all! <br><br>Focus stones, a Primer <br>Each mage on Lore has the ability to utilize a focus, usually made of a rare stone. These stones can allow the mage to hook into the ley lines and nexuses of magic which transverse the planet, and can guide them to the lines and reservoirs of magic across the world. <br><br>With practice and a stone for which they feel an affinity, a mage may also use the focus stone to enhance, to boost, their power. The crystalline structure of many stones allows it to hold the focused power mages channel through them. <br><br>As an example, think of a small tendril of a mage&#39;s power being funneled into a gemstone. That small jot of power bounces off the facets inside of the stone, gaining energy as it rebounds off the planes. That extra energy boosts power, increasing the strength of the magical working. <br><br>With the proper focus and will, a mage may find their strength greatly enhanced, the power of their spells increased manyfold. Of course, that is for normal mages. With the... unique... magic found in the Blue Mage or the Mad Weaponsmith, who knows? These two rare mages have not allowed a proper study of themselves to be made.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://forums2.battleon.com/f/tm.asp?m=21099744"><a href="http://forums2.battleon.com/f/tm.asp?m=21099744">http://forums2.battleon.com/f/tm.asp?m=21099744</a></a> , bottom of page, in spoiler tag, highlighted.</p>

            <p>We live on a planet where some people don&#39;t have the ability to stop bleeding after they get cut (ie, haemophilia), and that hasn&#39;t gone extinct (even though it&#39;s/was until very recently basically a 100% mortality rate for women even if they <i>don&#39;t</i> get injured). We have people with various issues who are absolutely in the &#39;unable to defend themselves to save their lives&#39; category, and yet mysteriously, they don&#39;t all get murdered by the age of 18.<br><br>For that matter, we have people who can drive tanks (the military) and people who can&#39;t (the everyone else), but the world isn&#39;t inhabited solely by soldiers! Just because they <i>are easily killable</i> doesn&#39;t mean they <i>will be killed</i>.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>It also probably depends on how &#39;not being magical&#39; comes about. Is it genetic and inheritable? Dominant or recessive? Or is it a developmental flaw? Is it racial - do people from Fantasy North Dakota lack magical powers? It could be related to lack of a trace element in the diet. Maybe it&#39;s people whose parents weren&#39;t around long enough to mystically open up their minds (subconsciously, of course), or people who don&#39;t have enough dead relatives in the past three generations to crack open their connection to the spirit world, or people who were born within the ten minutes after midnight (when, as all know, the gods rest).<br><br>Any of these possibilities, or dozens more, would give a different shape to the dynamics between them.

            <p>I know I certainly wouldn&#39;t make a world with that sort of thing. <br>I mean, it&#39;s that butterfly effect sort of thing, isn&#39;t it? <br>Smallest changes to anything in history, suddenly everything&#39;s different. Everybody having the potential to create fire immediately, and straight-up defeat death right there, is, I mean, a pretty bloody big change from our history, right? <br>We&#39;ve been positively ruled by, among other things, our climates and incoming death, for years (and still are,) and just those two examples shift things all over the place. <br><br>It&#39;d be a pretty wild place, is what I&#39;m saying. Endless &#39;what ifs.&#39; going on. <br>I&#39;d not do that because it sounds bloody hard. <br>Course, thoughts&#39;ll probably change with more information (how hard learning magic is, effects of using it, limitations,) but, y&#39;know.

<li><i>Charlotte grabbed the mini in her teeth the instant she and Ix appeared in the next scene. Ix glanced up at her horn, and then frowned at Charlotte’s saddlebags, concentrating. A dark green glow surrounded her horn and the saddlebags opened, the remote activator floating out. Ix grinned and opened a portal, and Charlotte tossed the mini through.</i></li>
</ol>This took me out of the story, because in hindsight I wondered who had opened the portal for the second mini. Charlotte?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>So far, it seems that everybody&#39;s said what needed to be said.<br><br>One teeny, tiny error in Luna&#39;s dialogue:<br><i>Luna shook her head and blinked in confusion, then stared at the agents. “We can feel our head clearing at last,” she said. “And we thank <b>ye</b> for your assistance.”</i><br><br>I know that you&#39;re trying to make clear that Luna has returned to normal, but your Early Modern English is off. &quot;Ye&quot; is nominative; it&#39;s &quot;you&quot; in the oblique cases. Perhaps have Luna talk to just <i>one</i> of the agents (and thus change the pronoun to &quot;thee&quot;), then bring in the other. For example, consider something like this:<br><i>then stared at Charlotte. &quot;We can feel our head clearing at last,&quot; she said. &quot;And we thank thee for thine assistance.&quot; Turning to Ix, she continued, &quot;And our thanks to thee as well.&quot;</i></p>

            <p>It sounds like a ten-year-old&#39;s first effort at fic-writing!

            <p>Wow, Charlotte really got the short end of the vampire-with-supernatural-power stick, didn&#39;t she? (That&#39;s one of the few interesting things her &#39;verse added to the vampire mythos, actually--the idea that notable traits from a human get further enhanced once they get bitten, like Jasper&#39;s presumed charisma and the love interest&#39;s super-presumed empathy/perception. Also, I thought Alice&#39;s specific brand of future-vision was cool.) <br><br>OK, random defense of cheesy, overly-abused vampire novel series over. Ix and Charlotte were really funny in this one, whether they were playing off each other or the fic&#39;s rampant idiocy. Midnight Star sounds like a decent name for a genderbent!Luna, but other than that, nothing.<br><br>The chocolate joke and the family jewels jokes were my particular favorites XD</p>

            <p>This episode... &quot;Starstruck Love&quot;!<br><br>Pfff... Alfie, although you have a cute name and many descendants, I would&#39;ve still slain you.<br><br>Lottie is a spider whisperer?! Hahahaha! What did she do when she was alive? Was she an arachnologist?<br><br>Okay... I believe that&#39;s the first time I see a script-fic. It&#39;s... kinda weird. <br><br>Okay, learning more about Lottie&#39;s badfic past. Good, that&#39;s always good.<br><br>Come on, Ix, cut the girl some slack. &quot;Dun, dun, DUUUUN&quot; is a fun thing to say!<br><br>Looking gifted horse in the mouth, Lottie? Literally? :P<br><br>Pff... the jokes just write themselves. Beautiful, ladies. Beautiful.<br><br>For some reason, hearing &quot;lunar republic&quot; made me think of a Star Wars/My Little Pony crossover—HOLD ON, HE&#39;S NINE THOUSAND YEARS OLD!?<br><br>&quot;puffed-up, pompous parasite&quot; as alliterations are amazing.<br><br>Huh, interesting method of assassination. Definitely original.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Overall, it was an enjoyable mission. I would probably enjoy it more, were I more into <i>My Little Pony</i>, but you made it entertaining with a spidery beginning (ALL SPIDERS MUST DIE!), and the mission was peppered with good humour. I feel like the pacing was good, too.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>And the ending. As you said, it falls kinda flat, and is quite corny, but when taken the story as a whole, I don&#39;t think it doesn&#39;t make a huge impact, enough to make the whole story bad.<br><br>Overall, I give it 4 stars outta 5.<br><br></p>
