            <p>Unfortunately it’s not too short in the good, I-wanna-read-more way. I feel disappointed because I didn’t get what I expected.<br><br>It starts so good, with a subversion of the narrative laws of comedy, but then the first paragraph already ends in a small anti-climax. <i>She capped her marker.</i> Really? That’s all? No relief? No fear of the Ironic Overpower soon making something worse happen to even out the good luck? Is September even aware that she barely escaped destruction of what may have been the work of hours? Does she just take it for granted, because she feels entitled to be treated in a special way? I can’t even say that September is out of character here because there is no character; it looks more like a paint-by-number robot. (It there were a who-are-you-and-what-did-you-do-to- September moment later, I would praise you for subtle foreshadowing.)<br><br><i>Kelly had been reading ...</i> and then immediately <i>... hit the acknowledge button</i>. So, did she use the console’s screen to read an e-book? Did she read a physical book, sitting on a chair in front of the console? Why? Is this the only place where she can sit while September occupies the other chair at the table? This is the second time the agents leave the RC to go on a mission, and I still have no mental image of the RC. For the second time, I got the impression that you try to show some of the agents’ life outside of missions – which is a good thing – but then are too impatient to really show it and just want to get into the mission already.<br><br>But this time, the problems carry on into the mission that doesn’t feel much like a PPC mission. Kelly and September don’t show any reaction to being dragged out of their comfortable movie-watching chairs again and again (do they even have easy chairs and a wide-screen TV to watch the movie?); they just go in, allegedly watch what happens not ever interacting with the fic, come back and talk about what they watched. They could just as well sit in the RC, read the words and MST the thing.  <br><br>Maybe the fic just isn’t suitable for a PPC-style mission. I sincerely doubt that it’s suitable for the mission format you chose. True, there are great chunks of story just plagiarized from the movie. But apparently there are also chunks of story where the OC acts on her own, and the agents never get to see them, neither in the movie (obviously) nor going into this parts of the fic. How do they know that the OC is redeemable if they didn’t actually watch her closely? How can I know that the agents are right about the OC being redeemable if I don’t want to read the fic myself?<br><br><i>“They&#39;ll be fine without you. Peter&#39;s going to get hurt if you don&#39;t leave now,” September said.</i> <br>Now that’s something that works for me. The agents don’t always need brute force, and Kaya’s reaction, putting her duty of protecting the Pevensies above a selfish need to act out her story, clearly shows that the agents are right. (I just wish I could see that this is based on how Kaya acted off-page.)<br><br>Technical Error:<br><i>“But he is in the movie, and I don&#39;t want to take Peter to Medical if I don&#39;t have to.” Kelly said as she grabbed her gun.</i><br>Since <i>Kelly said ...</i> continues the sentence that started with what Kelly said, the period before this should be a comma.<br><br>There is one other point I need to address. I’m not a Narnia expert, but from an (admittedly superficial) internet search I got the impression that elves in Narnia are more fanon than canon.  How does it turn out <i>that there are elves living in the High Forest of Narnia</i>? Would sending Kaya back really be a good idea?<br><br>I’m sorry that this sounds so harsh, and I want to finish with the last words September wrote: <i>Keep writing.</i> I guess you got the right ideas. Just take the time to flesh them out. (What? There’s another one up already? I’m afraid.)<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I was concerned from the beginning that the characters might not fit in.  They don&#39;t do anything really goofy or have angst or even play video games to talk about.  Their time between missions is a bit boring.  Maybe it&#39;s just me not understanding human interaction.<br><br>I&#39;m also open to the possibility that I found a bad story to mission.  I&#39;ve been having trouble with that aspect.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re correct, canonically Narnia doesn&#39;t have any elves in it, nor is there any place called the &#39;High Forest&#39; in Narnia for them to live in. </p>

            <p>Nice job with your mission, especially with the good quotes from the fic and recruiting the OC. I&#39;d like to see a bit more about finding the fox in the plothole and perhaps more reason to recruit rather than execute the elf.<br><br>You made your mission very accessible to people not familiar with the Narnia universe, which was helpful to me. I look forward to the next mission/interlude!</p>

            <p>Took me long enough.<br><br>As I mentioned in a thread a few weeks ago, I was working on a brand new workshop all about writing reviews. And lo and behold, it is here! Click <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:PoorCynic/Workshop_5:_Writing_Missions">this link</a> to check it out and maybe pick up some tidbits about reviews. As always, there is an associated challenge with it.

Sure, it took Nintendo/Niantic years to make their game, and it would probably only be a week or two before they rolled it out everywhere, but I&#39;m impatient! And I know JavaScript! How hard can it be?<br><br>Uh... not that hard, actually, provided you take a few shortcuts.<br><br>So I am pleased to introduce:<br><br><a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/">Pokemon Gone</a><br><br>The result of three whole days of work. I admit, it lacks a few things compared to <i>Pokemon Go</i>, such as... y&#39;know... the GPS stuff... but other than that, it&#39;s a fair substitute!<br><br>The observant among you may have noticed that there are no actual Pokemon behind that link. The <i>really</i> observant among you may have noticed that there&#39;s something slightly off about the text of this post. These two facts are connected. Instead of venturing outside to catch Pokemon for <i>Gone!</i>, you can stay right here on the Board!<br><br>Scattered across this p<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/DBHN.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>st, and across others of my posts on the front page, are tiny Pokeball symbols.

Can&#39;t you? The place to look is any post of mine where the subject line starts with a -. Keep an eye out for tiny Pokeballs replacing the letter &#39;o&#39;.<br><br>Q: I&#39;ve fought all the trainers! What do I do now?<br>A: Fight &#39;em again! Each time you enter a trainer&#39;s code, you get a fresh battle with a random member of their team, so there&#39;s always another chance.<br><br>Q: But there&#39;s only five of them and I&#39;m booooored.<br>A: Share your Gym Code on the subthread, and pick up someone else&#39;s Gym Code to fight their team! It works exactly the same as the trainers above.<br><br>Q: What Pokemon are in this?<br>A: As I write this, <i>Pokemon Gone!</i> includes the first 27 Pokemon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). I&#39;m adding more, but it&#39;s slow going. Eventually, I aim to have the entire Gen III Pokedex imported.<br><br>Q: HAH! I&#39;ve reverse-engineered your code and can give myself anything I want!

But it&#39;s also easy to just lie and say you did. There&#39;s no scoreboards or anything, so why not play the game how it&#39;s meant to be played?<br><br>Q: What&#39;s next for <i>Pokemon Gone!</i>?<br>A: The first thing is of course increasing the number of Pokemon - no-one wants to play too long with just Zigzagoon for company. As the Pokemon roll in, I&#39;ll add new trainers and Gym Leaders (Nentúrë&#39;s a bit lonely right now). I also want to write up an introduction page from Professor Mall<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/CM1G.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>rn (^</em>~). Eventually I&#39;ll be scattering Pokeballs across my site, to give the game a permanent home. There&#39;s a few changes I&#39;d like to make to the game itself - such as splitting ATK and SP.ATK back up - but I&#39;ll probably only do that if it becomes enduringly popular for some reason.<br><br>Q: Should I play this game and tell you what I think about it?<br>A: Why yes, as it happens, you should! :D<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Training up the teams I&#39;m going to put in my Ground/Rock gym, and encountered something rather weird, if both pokemon faint in the same turn (say due to poisoning) then the game gets stuck, you have to replace your pokemon as if you lost the battle but the AI doesn&#39;t replace their pokemon acting as if it still has HP despite the fact it has fainted. You can&#39;t select a move for your replacement pokemon to use or anything, the game gets stuck. </p>

            <p>Since you did sort of dare me to look at your code, and I was a TA for a computer architecture class last semester, I felt the urge to give you concrit on your thing.<br><br>- Your JS<br><br>1) Powers That Be in a bucket, indent your code! (Unless you were deliberately going for the unreadable look, of course). If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d accuse you of coding in <i>Notepad</i>. (Note: if you are actually coding in Notepad, I&#39;ve heard good things about Notepad++ on Windows, or you can pick up Emacs (or maybe Vim, if you like second-best) if you want to jump in the deep end of coding editors, but Google around for a good config in those cases)<br><br>2) Several variable should probably be dictionaries/Objects, not arrays. The main reason for this is that arrays use memory proportional to the largest valid index (that is, if you do <tt>var a = []; a[200000] = 5</tt>, you&#39;ll also use memory space for all of the <tt>undefined</tt>s that go in slots 0 through 199999. <br><br>2b) Which brings me to my next point, <tt>indexOf()</tt>, which is, as the theorists say, O(n). That is, the more Pokemon you add, the slower it will get, especially for errors. This can be avoided by dropping <tt>pokindex</tt> entirely and making <tt>pokedex</tt> an Object (<tt>var pokedex = {}</tt>).<br><br>This will allow you to check membership by simply doing <tt>numMon in pokedex</tt>. Also, you get the Magic that is JavaScript auto-coersion (most such things are terrible ideas but it&#39;s presence is not your fault). That is, if you do <tt>foo = {1: 2}</tt>, then <tt>foo[&quot;1&quot;] == foo[1]</tt>.<br><br>3) If you ever find yourself copy-pasting the same code several times and making minor changes (especially if there are variable suffixes such as thingA, thingB, ... involved), you might want to find another way to express what you&#39;re going for.<br><br>For example, here&#39;s a very functional-programming way to go from uppercase <tt>txt</tt> to <tt>digits</tt><br><br><pre><br>var digits = txt.split(&quot;&quot;).map(function (char) { return char.charCodeAt(0).toString(); }).join(&quot;&quot;)<br></pre>
<br><br>(plop the <tt>.toUpperCase()</tt> in there for extra golf)<br><br>3) atkset{1-4} should really be an array-of-arrays called <tt>atkSet</tt> for DRY (don&#39;t repeat yourself) reasons<br><br>4) <tt>&quot;&quot;.concat(foo[0],foo[1]...)</tt> is <tt>foo.join(&quot;&quot;)</tt> So, I might have written <tt>var trainOut = trainlets.join(&quot;&quot;) + document.getElementById(&quot;namecode&quot;).value)</tt><br><br>5) <tt>+</tt> works on strings, and might be advisable when there&#39;s only two<br><br>6) <tt>Verifier()</tt> is O(n) (and uppercase, which is usually reserved for constructors like <tt>Monster</tt>). To make it faster, you might want this<br><pre><br>function setLike()<br>{<br>    var ret = {};<br>    var numArguments = arguments.length;<br>    for (var i = 0; i         ret[arguments[i]] = true<br>    }<br>    return ret;<br>}<br></pre>
<br><br>and to pull <tt>allowed</tt> out into something like <tt>ALLOWED_FROBS</tt> to avoid re-defining it every time.<br><br>7) One-based indexing makes people cry. Are you a mathematician?<br><br>8) Similarly, using <tt>n</tt> as the index for a loop is just a bit odd, since <tt>n</tt> is often the length of the thing you&#39;re looping over, so <tt>foo[n-1]</tt> feels like assignment to the last element of the array. The usual loop variables are <tt>i</tt>, then <tt>j</tt>, (and <tt>k</tt> if you&#39;re doing matrix multiply, or other crazy things)<br><br>9) On the positive side, the code is split into functions, is understandable, and uses clear variable names (!).<br><br>10) Do you wont to get modern? Do you want to add an optional feature that works for everyone other than people on old internet explorer versions? Try <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a>. It&#39;s the hot net thing, and might actually be useful? You could stick the save code in there and re-populate the page on re-load.<br><br>Your HTML/CSS:<br><br>1) Putting a style on each thing, especially if you&#39;re copy-pasting them around, is, to put it strongly, Doing It Wrong. <br><br>You can assign classes to HTML things, and then style everything that shares a class at once.<br><br>For example<br><pre><br>&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;<br>.blockimg {<br>    width:50px;<br>    height:50px;<br>    position:absolute;<br>    left: 200px;<br>    top: 95px;<br>}<br>&lt;/style&gt;<br></pre>
<br>Then, you can put <tt>class=&quot;blockimg</tt> on all the image placeholders instead of copy-pasting. This reduces redundancy and makes it easier for you to change your mind.<br><br>2) Absolute widths in pixels make me personally sad. My eyes are perma-not-great, so I have instructed my browser to bump fonts to at least 16pt no matter what the developer wants. This means that I can&#39;t read the whole &quot;Go(ne)&quot; button. The exact remedy for this depends on what you&#39;re doing.<br><br>2a) em is a unit that is relative to the current font (and font size).<br><br>2b) If you&#39;re willing to rewrite everything, absolute positioning is vaguely considered not a great idea (mainly because cell phones). Many people use some variant of a <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-css-grid-systems/">grid layout</a> (have not used their code, but looks not-bad). If you want, leaving extra padding columns on the right (empty <tt>div</tt>s) will probably keep the current look.<br><br>But, the game is pretty cool, and it&#39;s pretty good for something made in three days. (I&#39;ve seen worse.)<br><br>- Tomash, who didn&#39;t plan on this getting so long, and hopes he&#39;s not being too harsh</p>

Doing an on-page stylesheet is a good idea, and one I&#39;ll definitely look into when I&#39;m in a coding mood again.

            <p>1) And when I&#39;m not, I&#39;m c<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/4LAL.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>ding in Webs.com&#39;s native HTML editor. And the reason I&#39;m doing that is that I&#39;m doing most of this on the computer at work, so I don&#39;t have my choice of coding editors. Also: laziness. ;)<br><br>2) and all points after: my coding knowledge is a bit haphazard. I&#39;ve done c<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/1KDG.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>urses in C++, Java, and C#, but most of the actual work I&#39;ve done is cludging things together in VBA (for work) or Javascript (for fun). It&#39;s very much been a &#39;how do I do this thing I need to&#39; process, so there&#39;s a lot of stuff I&#39;m not at all familiar with.<br><br>Example: I understand the problem you&#39;re describing with the pokedex, but I don&#39;t understand your solution. I guess I need to read up on dictionaries? This is probably the change I&#39;m most likely to make, since a) memory overhead, and b) I&#39;ve had at least one incorrect entry in pokindex.<br><br>3)  Wow, I don&#39;t understand at <i>all</i> what your functional-pr<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/AJQF.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>gramming did there. ^<em>^ One reason my code is so spaced out, particularly around &#39;digits&#39;, is that I was working out what it needed to do as I went.

You&#39;re right that &#39;allowed&#39; should be up in the top section; no reason to keep redefining it. (As to the style issue of the capital letter - yeah, I&#39;ve no idea what correct styling is for Javascript or anything else; someday perhaps I&#39;ll learn.)<br><br>7) No, I&#39;m a chemist. ^</em>^ And most of the 1-based indexes happened by accident, where for-l<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/BNVM.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>ops got a bit tangled up. I just didn&#39;t try to weed them out.<br><br>8) I&#39;ve had problems with &#39;i&#39; seeming to carry over from function to function, so tried to make all my loops use different letters; there&#39;s a loop in &#39;p&#39; somewhere. &#39;n&#39; showed up purely because I knew I hadn&#39;t used it yet.<br><br>9) And this comes about because I need to be able to see what a given piece is d<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/4LUL.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>ing, I was tweaking it so much! (Technically for this I should probably have named every variable and function a random string of ten digits, to make it impossible to puzzle out what it was doing... but haha, no.)<br><br>10) ... ooh. I shall look into this immediately. Though on the flip-side, it means I&#39;ll need a &#39;clear team&#39; button to make it easier to wipe clean... but I should have that anyway.<br><br>I&#39;ll reply to the HTML section later (because it means another p<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/1ANG.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>st to put Pokemon into), but thank you very much for this concrit!

            <p>1) Called it :). One thing I might recommend is using tabs to indent (despite the viewer-dependent length issue) since that&#39;s one key per level not {2,4,8} spaces.<br><br>2) Dictionaries. Also knows as maps, associative arrays, hashes, and maybe several other things. These are surprisingly useful things. They&#39;re sort of generalizations of arrays. Arrays let you quickly do Integer → stuff (especially if the integers are small). Dictionaries let you quickly do stuff → stuff (in stronger-typed languages, it&#39;s Key type → Value type). The usual way to make one is a hash table (look those up if you want to learn something).<br><br>To make an empty dictionary, use <tt>{}</tt>. Dictionaries with values in them are <tt>{key: value, key: value, ...}</tt> in JavaScript (some languages will use <tt>=&gt;</tt> instead). To look something up in a dictionary, use <tt>dict[key]</tt>, basically like arrays.<br><br>JavaScript is also a bit finicky, because objects are (as far as I can tell) dictionaries. That is, instead of doing <tt>&quot;&quot;.concat(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)</tt>, you can do <tt>&quot;&quot;<a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2016/%22foo%22," title="bar">&quot;concat&quot;</a></tt>.<br><br>This also creates the &quot;feature&quot; that in JavaScript dictionaries, all the keys are automatically converted to strings. (I&#39;m aiming for, roughly, program correctness research, so I&#39;m not a JS fan)<br><br>3) Ok, so I&#39;m going to want to go through that.<br><br>- We start with the uppercase string <tt>txt</tt><br><br>- Then, we <tt>.split(&quot;&quot;)</tt> it. <tt>split(sep)</tt> splits the string at places where <tt>sep</tt> occurs and returns a list of the parts, with the separators removed. In this case, this method creates an array of strings, where each string is one character from the original text<br><br>- Now, we come to a function that&#39;s well known in functional programming circles, that is <tt>array.map(function)</tt>. Map conceptually replaces each element <tt>x</tt> of the array by <tt>function(x)</tt> (it actually creates a new array with those results, but yeah). In our case, the function takes each one-character string in the array, takes the char code of the 0th (and only) character, and then converts that to a string. So <tt>[&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;].map(Number)</tt> gives <tt>[1, 2]</tt> and <tt>[&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;].map(function (char) { return char.charCodeAt(0).toString(); })</tt> gives <tt>[&quot;65&quot;, &quot;66&quot;]</tt><br><br>- The final <tt>.join(&quot;&quot;)</tt> flattens the array of strings into one long string, which gives you the 8-character <tt>digits</tt> (&quot;AaBbCcDd&quot;, as you put it) you were constructing earlier<br><br>4) It&#39;s not particularly obvious that that&#39;s a thing you can do. Thank you Stack Overflow!<br><br>5) That is a JavaScript &quot;feature&quot; <i>sigh</i><br><br>6) So, javascript (until last year&#39;s standard) is missing some form of set datatype. So, that function fakes one. Instead of having a set of things, you have a dictionary with the things as keys, but their value is always something meaningless and small, like <tt>true</tt>. Then, you have what you wanted out of a set data structure (fast membership testing, fast add, and fast remove) (ignoring pathological cases that shouldn&#39;t ever come up)<br><br>6b) So, several general guidelines for most C-like languages (check some variant of &quot;$lang style guide&quot; for specifics and minor cultural things.<br><br>- Types (and type-like things, such as constructors for types), start with a capital letter<br><br>- Functions and variables start lowercase.<br><br>- <tt>snake<em>case</tt> vs. <tt>camelCase</tt> vs.depends-on-what-you&#39;re-naming is a social thing per-project, and, in open source code, roughly per language. JavaScript uses camelCase everywhere.<br><br>- Constants like PI are ALL</em>CAPS<br><br>- Pick a style for brace placement and stick with it, stay away from the flamewars.<br><br>- In general, <tt>foo(1)</tt> and <tt>bar[1]</tt> but <tt>while (1)</tt><br><br>- Extra line breaks to make things fit roughly in 80ish characters helps avoid really long lines, which cause(d) problems<br><br>7) Fun. My mother&#39;s also a chemist. She did/does sort of polymer-related industrial research, IIRC, but then she went over to the dark side (aka management)<br><br>I figure this means you&#39;ve been around enough physicists (who&#39;ve hung around with certain groups of mathematicians) to pick up the [1, N] method of numbering N things, instead of the CS people&#39;s [0, N). I&#39;m still somewhat salty that a perfectly reasonable uniform floor numbering system made it so the basement of the CS building is floor 1, not floor 0 :). <br> <br>8) You&#39;ve run into another JavaScript &quot;feature&quot;. If, when you create a variable, you do <tt>i = 0;</tt> instead of <tt>var i = 0;</tt>, <tt>i</tt> become a <b>global</b> variable, and isn&#39;t isolated to your functions. This also applies to your for loops. So, use <tt>for (var i = 0; i &lt; limit; i++)</tt> and your problem goes away.<br><br>9) Well, that&#39;s one good reason to be using functions, along with the whole code reuse thing. It sometimes takes people a while to pick up on this.<br><br>10) Are you feeling lazy? Tell us there&#39;s a 6 or so character erase code, like &quot;000000&quot;, to allow dismissing a Pokémon. Then, just add that in. Saves you making a button.</p>

In this case, this method creates an array of strings, where each string is one character from the original text<br><br>- Now, we come to a function that&#39;s well known in functional programming circles, that is <tt>array.map(function)</tt>. Map conceptually replaces each element <tt>x</tt> of the array by <tt>function(x)</tt> (it actually creates a new array with those results, but yeah). In our case, the function takes each one-character string in the array, takes the char code of the 0th (and only) character, and then converts that to a string. So <tt>[&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;].map(Number)</tt> gives <tt>[1, 2]</tt> and <tt>[&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;].map(function (char) { return char.charCodeAt(0).toString(); })</tt> gives <tt>[&quot;65&quot;, &quot;66&quot;]</tt><br><br>- The final <tt>.join(&quot;&quot;)</tt> flattens the array of strings into one long string, which gives you the 8-character <tt>digits</tt> (&quot;AaBbCcDd&quot;, as you put it) you were constructing earlier<br><br>4) It&#39;s not particularly obvious that that&#39;s a thing you can do. Thank you Stack Overflow!<br><br>5) That is a JavaScript &quot;feature&quot; <i>sigh</i><br><br>6) So, javascript (until last year&#39;s standard) is missing some form of set datatype. So, that function fakes one. Instead of having a set of things, you have a dictionary with the things as keys, but their value is always something meaningless and small, like <tt>true</tt>. Then, you have what you wanted out of a set data structure (fast membership testing, fast add, and fast remove) (ignoring pathological cases that shouldn&#39;t ever come up)<br><br>6b) So, several general guidelines for most C-like languages (check some variant of &quot;$lang style guide&quot; for specifics and minor cultural things.<br><br>- Types (and type-like things, such as constructors for types), start with a capital letter<br><br>- Functions and variables start lowercase.<br><br>- <tt>snake<em>case</tt> vs. <tt>camelCase</tt> vs.depends-on-what-you&#39;re-naming is a social thing per-project, and, in open source code, roughly per language. JavaScript uses camelCase everywhere.<br><br>- Constants like PI are ALL</em>CAPS<br><br>- Pick a style for brace placement and stick with it, stay away from the flamewars.<br><br>- In general, <tt>foo(1)</tt> and <tt>bar[1]</tt> but <tt>while (1)</tt><br><br>- Extra line breaks to make things fit roughly in 80ish characters helps avoid really long lines, which cause(d) problems<br><br>7) Fun. My mother&#39;s also a chemist. She did/does sort of polymer-related industrial research, IIRC, but then she went over to the dark side (aka management)<br><br>I figure this means you&#39;ve been around enough physicists (who&#39;ve hung around with certain groups of mathematicians) to pick up the [1, N] method of numbering N things, instead of the CS people&#39;s [0, N). I&#39;m still somewhat salty that a perfectly reasonable uniform floor numbering system made it so the basement of the CS building is floor 1, not floor 0 :). <br> <br>8) You&#39;ve run into another JavaScript &quot;feature&quot;. If, when you create a variable, you do <tt>i = 0;</tt> instead of <tt>var i = 0;</tt>, <tt>i</tt> become a <b>global</b> variable, and isn&#39;t isolated to your functions. This also applies to your for loops. So, use <tt>for (var i = 0; i  and your problem goes away.<br><br>9) Well, that&#39;s one good reason to be using functions, along with the whole code reuse thing. It sometimes takes people a while to pick up on this.<br><br>10) Are you feeling lazy? Tell us there&#39;s a 6 or so character erase code, like &quot;000000&quot;, to allow dismissing a Pokémon. Then, just add that in. Saves you making a button.</tt></p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Since you did sort of dare me to look at your code, and I was a TA for a computer architecture class last semester, I felt the urge to give you concrit on your thing.<br><br>- Your JS<br><br>1) Powers That Be in a bucket, indent your code! (Unless you were deliberately going for the unreadable look, of course). If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d accuse you of coding in <i>Notepad</i>. (Note: if you are actually coding in Notepad, I&#39;ve heard good things about Notepad++ on Windows, or you can pick up Emacs (or maybe Vim, if you like second-best) if you want to jump in the deep end of coding editors, but Google around for a good config in those cases)<br><br>2) Several variable should probably be dictionaries/Objects, not arrays. The main reason for this is that arrays use memory proportional to the largest valid index (that is, if you do <tt>var a = []; a[200000] = 5</tt>, you&#39;ll also use memory space for all of the <tt>undefined</tt>s that go in slots 0 through 199999. <br><br>2b) Which brings me to my next point, <tt>indexOf()</tt>, which is, as the theorists say, O(n). That is, the more Pokemon you add, the slower it will get, especially for errors. This can be avoided by dropping <tt>pokindex</tt> entirely and making <tt>pokedex</tt> an Object (<tt>var pokedex = {}</tt>).<br><br>This will allow you to check membership by simply doing <tt>numMon in pokedex</tt>. Also, you get the Magic that is JavaScript auto-coersion (most such things are terrible ideas but it&#39;s presence is not your fault). That is, if you do <tt>foo = {1: 2}</tt>, then <tt>foo[&quot;1&quot;] == foo[1]</tt>.<br><br>3) If you ever find yourself copy-pasting the same code several times and making minor changes (especially if there are variable suffixes such as thingA, thingB, ... involved), you might want to find another way to express what you&#39;re going for.<br><br>For example, here&#39;s a very functional-programming way to go from uppercase <tt>txt</tt> to <tt>digits</tt><br><br><pre><br>var digits = txt.split(&quot;&quot;).map(function (char) { return char.charCodeAt(0).toString(); }).join(&quot;&quot;)<br></pre>
<br><br>(plop the <tt>.toUpperCase()</tt> in there for extra golf)<br><br>3) atkset{1-4} should really be an array-of-arrays called <tt>atkSet</tt> for DRY (don&#39;t repeat yourself) reasons<br><br>4) <tt>&quot;&quot;.concat(foo[0],foo[1]...)</tt> is <tt>foo.join(&quot;&quot;)</tt> So, I might have written <tt>var trainOut = trainlets.join(&quot;&quot;) + document.getElementById(&quot;namecode&quot;).value)</tt><br><br>5) <tt>+</tt> works on strings, and might be advisable when there&#39;s only two<br><br>6) <tt>Verifier()</tt> is O(n) (and uppercase, which is usually reserved for constructors like <tt>Monster</tt>). To make it faster, you might want this<br><pre><br>function setLike()<br>{<br>    var ret = {};<br>    var numArguments = arguments.length;<br>    for (var i = 0; i &lt; numArguments; i++) {<br>        ret[arguments[i]] = true<br>    }<br>    return ret;<br>}<br></pre>
<br><br>and to pull <tt>allowed</tt> out into something like <tt>ALLOWED_FROBS</tt> to avoid re-defining it every time.<br><br>7) One-based indexing makes people cry. Are you a mathematician?<br><br>8) Similarly, using <tt>n</tt> as the index for a loop is just a bit odd, since <tt>n</tt> is often the length of the thing you&#39;re looping over, so <tt>foo[n-1]</tt> feels like assignment to the last element of the array. The usual loop variables are <tt>i</tt>, then <tt>j</tt>, (and <tt>k</tt> if you&#39;re doing matrix multiply, or other crazy things)<br><br>9) On the positive side, the code is split into functions, is understandable, and uses clear variable names (!).<br><br>10) Do you wont to get modern? Do you want to add an optional feature that works for everyone other than people on old internet explorer versions? Try <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a>. It&#39;s the hot net thing, and might actually be useful? You could stick the save code in there and re-populate the page on re-load.<br><br>Your HTML/CSS:<br><br>1) Putting a style on each thing, especially if you&#39;re copy-pasting them around, is, to put it strongly, Doing It Wrong. <br><br>You can assign classes to HTML things, and then style everything that shares a class at once.<br><br>For example<br><pre><br>&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;<br>.blockimg {<br>    width:50px;<br>    height:50px;<br>    position:absolute;<br>    left: 200px;<br>    top: 95px;<br>}<br>&lt;/style&gt;<br></pre>
<br>Then, you can put <tt>class=&quot;blockimg</tt> on all the image placeholders instead of copy-pasting. This reduces redundancy and makes it easier for you to change your mind.<br><br>2) Absolute widths in pixels make me personally sad. My eyes are perma-not-great, so I have instructed my browser to bump fonts to at least 16pt no matter what the developer wants. This means that I can&#39;t read the whole &quot;Go(ne)&quot; button. The exact remedy for this depends on what you&#39;re doing.<br><br>2a) em is a unit that is relative to the current font (and font size).<br><br>2b) If you&#39;re willing to rewrite everything, absolute positioning is vaguely considered not a great idea (mainly because cell phones). Many people use some variant of a <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-css-grid-systems/">grid layout</a> (have not used their code, but looks not-bad). If you want, leaving extra padding columns on the right (empty <tt>div</tt>s) will probably keep the current look.<br><br>But, the game is pretty cool, and it&#39;s pretty good for something made in three days. (I&#39;ve seen worse.)<br><br>- Tomash, who didn&#39;t plan on this getting so long, and hopes he&#39;s not being too harsh</p>

            <p>You&#39;ve beaten my second obstacle, and only had what, three deaths? But we&#39;ll see how you do against Ace Trainer Isabell! She&#39;s the one I eventually gave up recording while I was training, because it took longer to record than it did to actually fight. Oh, by the way, did I mention that the Gym Leader has a little surprise up his sleeve? Since there were only five normal types when I made the gym, not counting Azurill, I had to fill in the spot with something, so let&#39;s see how you do against that something... if you get that far. Mwa ha ha.</p>

            <p>Okay, picking up where we left off: I need a strategy to take down Granz&#39;s Slaking. It has 225 HP, 197 ATK, 127 DEF, with Fury Swipes (90, Normal) and Hammer Arm (100, Fighting). My two levelled Pokemon are Probopass (90 HP, 97 ATK, 225 DEF) and Breloom (90 HP, 142 ATK, 105 DEF).<br><br>Fury Swipes is Normal-type, meaning it&#39;s weak against R<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/?OXL.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>ck and Steel, and can&#39;t hit Ghost at all. Hammer Arm is Fighting, which has strengths and weaknesses all over the place, but crucially is strong against Rock and Steel, and unable to hit Ghost.<br><br>Hmm. On thinking about this, I see two strategies:<br><br>1/ Send in Probopass. It can completely ign<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/1K0H.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>re Fury Swipes (being Rock/Steel), but will be utterly destroyed by Hammer Arm. So this is a gamble. It&#39;s also got very high-powered attacks, so can actually do a good job of cutting through that HP.<br><br>2/ Send in Breloom. As Grass/Fighting, it takes normal damage from both moves, but has Sky Uppercut, which gets doubled damage against Slaking. It&#39;s got higher attack than Probopass, so it can do more damage - but its defence is lower.<br><br>3/ Look for a ghost. Shedinja or Sableye, at this point. Trouble is, my rules <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/AOYF.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>nly allow me to take one Pokemon from each post, and I only have a handful of posts I haven&#39;t already claimed from. So this is a gamble. But if I <i>find</i> one, it&#39;s a no-trouble win.<br><br>Okay. I&#39;m going to try option 2 first. If that fails, it&#39;s on to Option 3.<br><br><b>Fight 34:</b> Breloom v. Slaking<br><br>-Round 1: Breloom actually does more damage than Slaking! Sky Uppercut does 47, while Slaking d<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/11NK.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>es 43. But, uh, I only have 47 HP <i>left</i> now, while Slaking has 178.<br>-Round 2 is even better: 55 versus 34. But I&#39;m down to 13 HP, and...<br>-Yep, out on Round 3. I got Slaking down to 76 HP.<br><br>Time to go hunting.<br><br>-Pokemon found: Ralts. No. Though if it evolves into Gallade, it could give it a try.<br>-Pokemon found: Nosepass. No.<br>-Pokemon found: Whismur. Don&#39;t think so.<br>-Pokemon found: Wingull.

My remaining Pokemon:<br><br>Plusle + Minun: No chance, no evolution, nothing.<br>Taillow: Hammer Arm is weak against Flying, so there&#39;s that.<br>Zigzagoon: Not likely.<br>Poochyena: Ditto, though its attack is better.<br>Wingull: Pelipper isn&#39;t exactly a big name.<br>Surskit: Yes, my moth will destroy your beast. Sure.<br>Nosepass + Probopass: Tough, but tough enough? I don&#39;t know.<br>Lotad: ... hmm.<br><br>Lotad can evolve twice, which means it&#39;ll end up stronger than most of my other beasts. I don&#39;t know what attacks it&#39;ll have, but they might be strong. And at least it&#39;s not weak to Normal <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/ADIO.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>r Fighting...<br><br>Okay.

Slaking<br>I will only be using Zap Cannon in this match. With 120 STR, it&#39;s the more powerful attack, and Electric and Rock are both normal-damage against Slaking.<br>-Round 1: It uses Fury Swipes. I take 6 damage. It takes 29. 84 v. 196<br>-R<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/1GXK.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>und 2: 80 v. 178. Fury Swipes again.<br>-Round 3: ... Hammer Arm takes me straight out of the game. 114 damage; I only had 90 HP to start with.<br><br>And that&#39;s where this challenge ends. I could train up my other Nosepass and hope for a fluke, but is winning based on a mucked-up RNG really winning? I could also cook up a post full of Nincadas and Sableyes and breeze through, but again, that&#39;s cheating. So instead, I will gracefully admit defeat.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Now, what did I learn from this?<br><br>-The actual battling is very deterministic. You have <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/3ENL.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>ne attack which is objectively the best; you should use it every turn. Hope the RNG doesn&#39;t use its better attack.<br>-If you&#39;re allowed to bring whatever Pokemon you want, it would probably be very easy. If I&#39;d allowed myself to look for a Sableye, I could&#39;ve taken the entire gym with it.<br>-This game could stand a few changes to play up its best aspects.<br><br>I think these are the changes I want to make:<br><br>-A &#39;Gym Mode&#39;, where you face each of a trainer&#39;s Pokem<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/1AFH.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>n without stopping. With no healing available, this adds more strategy to your team selection. You only get an output save code at the end of the battle.<br>-A counter on the Collection page that says how many battles you&#39;ve fought (ie, how many level-ups you&#39;ve had). There&#39;s challenge in trying to keep this number low, rather than just maxing everything.<br>-I think I really have to take 1visible&#39;s suggestion of reimplementing status conditions. Otherwise there&#39;s no point in having buttons: the computer can work out the best move just as well as the player (if not better).<br>-And, uh... more Pokemon! The Gen III &#39;dex g<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/BJRG.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>es from 252 to 386; I&#39;m at 317 right now, so there&#39;s still 69/134 to go!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>First off, I&#39;d have to agree with HG about the balance between the badfic and the mission. There were multiple points where I wasn&#39;t sure what your agents were talking about—September being surprised by &quot;<i>the Excaliber blade,</i>&quot; the incense being an aphrodisiac—because you didn&#39;t show the actual badfic text.<br><br>The mission itself also feels very mechanical. Neither agent did or said very much that distinguished them from each other. I feel like you could have switched their names around and the story wouldn&#39;t have been all that different. I feel like you missed some good potential moments for characterization by telling rather than showing. The line &quot;<i>September knew that they weren&#39;t allowed to drink on duty, but also knew that Synthale&#39;s effects could be dismissed easily.</i>&quot; is fairly dull on its own. You could have written a much larger scene here that could have allowed both agents to shine.<br><br>A few technical things to note:<br>— There are extra paragraph spaces around the seventh paragraph on the first page (the one that starts &quot;Kelly sighed…&quot;).<br>—It should be &quot;coming to,&quot; not &quot;coming-to&quot; on the final page.<br>— This is more a subjective technical note, but single-sentence paragraphs should only be used for either dialogue or as a means of emphasizing lines. The second paragraph on the first page fits neither category and could easily be merged with the following paragraph. Or you could throw in a line of dialogue; as simple as September saying &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; or similar.<br><br>There&#39;s a great deal of potential here. You could do so much with these two provided you put in the time and the effort. Maybe try writing some interludes focusing on both agents and their interactions. I&#39;ve always found that to be a good way to find out who characters are and what they&#39;re like.<br><br>Best of luck with your next mission.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>I didn’t cringe and flail about obviously missed opportunities, and the agents didn’t look like talking heads (does that count as two instances of praise?), so that’s certainly some progress from the previous mission.<br><br>Alas, I felt like the mission doesn’t give me a good representation of the badfic. It’s hard to find the right mixture of quotes, recap, and showing the agents’ reactions to events, and since I never actually tried to do it myself, I can’t give good advice on this. Does the badfic ripp off an actual <i>Star Trek</i> episode I should be familiar with? That might explain why some sentences seem still to be incomprehensible even after I read the badfic, specifically:<br><br><i>&quot;The incense is an aphrodisiac,</i> (how does September know this) <i>and I guess it was supposed to be an accident,</i> (in the canon episode?) <i>but then she admitted that she&#39;s &#39;known to screw around with everyone&#39;s mind.&#39;&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;Picard wouldn&#39;t have that much trouble staying in control around a beautiful woman, not when Riker&#39;s just flirting.&quot;</i> <br>Why is this brought up while the agents are in a part of the badfic where Picard and Riker aren’t even mentioned?  And looking further up both in the mission and the badfic, I still don’t see to what this may refer.<br><br>Technical errors:<br><br>In the title, <i>An elf in Star Trek</i>, &quot;Elf&quot; should be capitalized (and in the previous mission’s title, <i>An Elf In Narnia</i>, &quot;in&quot; should probably not be <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Capitalization">capitalized</a>.<br><br><i>September whispered. &quot;The incense is an aphrodisiac ...&quot;</i><br>Don’t English punctuation rules say that the period after &quot;whispered&quot; should be a comma?<br><br><i>Kim set the RA for a couple hours ahead.</i><br>Who is Kim? Did you mean Kelly?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>First up, I&#39;m going to admit that I haven&#39;t opened the doc up yet, but I think a couple of things need to be said before I do. <br><br>Right, &#39;I didn&#39;t manage to find a beta...&#39; You put up a post asking for a beta for this mission on the 2nd June, and then haven&#39;t really mentioned it since, alright I&#39;ll agree that no-one said they&#39;d definitely beta this for you then, but you could have asked again at some other time for people to beta it, like you did with the Harry Potter/Dollhouse mission. Instead there&#39;s one post mentioning it over a month ago and after one failed try it&#39;s &#39;I didn&#39;t manage to find a beta&#39;. Hell, if you&#39;d emailed me about it I would have been willing to beta it for you, Star Trek may not be my forte but I know enough about it to be able to beta a mission in it (so long as its not DS9) and I&#39;d have been willing to look over it if you&#39;d needed someone to. I always find that the best thing to do if you don&#39;t have something is ask, ask and ask again, there are a couple of tutors at my old uni who I swear would be happy if they didn&#39;t see another email from me again because of the amount of times I pestered them with questions about how to do certain bits of maths. <br><br>Secondly, it&#39;s always good to see mission&#39;s popping up on the board, but I think it may not be a bad idea for you to slow down just a bit. I don&#39;t mean this in any rude way, but I think that slowing down the speed you&#39;re writing missions at would perhaps help, I understand that people write at different speeds and I&#39;m quite happy to plod along quite slowly, but taking a breather isn&#39;t a bad thing, I always find I spot more of my own mistakes if I take breaks between me writing something and me reading it through, sometimes those breaks last a couple of days, sometimes they&#39;re a few hours, but by taking those breaks I find that when I come back to the piece of writing I&#39;m able to give it a more critical eye and spot more errors than if I&#39;m reading it through almost immediately after writing it.<br><br>Once again, I don&#39;t mean to be rude, or for anything to be taken the wrong way, but personally I feel that these things need to be said. If you want to call me out of either of these points, or want me to explain anything that I&#39;ve said I&#39;m happy to do so either on the board on by email (ig you can&#39;t find my email it should be linked at the top)<br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>Well for the first one, he would have to go out of his way using his powers to make something implausible or impossible work. He could do it, but it would take a long time for it to be right. And to answer your second question, he realized quickly that his powers can screw him over. So he made it so that when ever he wants to use his powers. He has to start each thought with the words &quot;I imagine...&quot; Or else nothing happens.<br><br>While this does take longer and leaves him up to be attacked while in thought.

            <p>I&#39;ve RPed with K&#39;eth (both the user and the character); K&#39;eth the character honestly doesn&#39;t seem like too much of a Gary Stu to me. From what I understand, he&#39;s an anthropomorphic personification of imagination; his reality-altering abilities are an extension of that.<br><br>As for a personality: he&#39;s a trickster god. He delights in screwing with people, and thinks that (among other things) angry demigods are the most hilarious thing he&#39;s ever seen. He never causes or intends lasting harm; he&#39;s an all-powerful prankster who hates boredom and dullness.<br><br>Sues meet their goals without effort... K&#39;eth just happens to not really have any goals beyond his own entertainment. He&#39;s a creature of whims, with no far-reaching ambitions or plans. All he wants to do is make life more interesting (even if that involves randomly turning into a girl and making out with someone, which he has done before).<br><br>Is he fit for duty as a PPC agent? Absolutely not. While not truly a Stu (at least in my mind), he&#39;s still a reality-warper and he probably wouldn&#39;t get along with the Flowers. He&#39;s too powerful for Action departments, and unlike Jenni he wouldn&#39;t keep his powers in check because he&#39;d probably be eternally bored without them.<br><br>I can&#39;t really speak for the rest of K&#39;eth&#39;s OCs; I&#39;m not as familiar with them as I am with the Embodiment of Imagination.</p>

            <p>Didn&#39;t read this particular thread until after I replied to the OP ^^; Anyway, yeah. I second what the others have said - I&#39;ve seen some other OCs on the MGE Wiki that are built in the same way as yours, i.e. &quot;a list of powers with a personality tacked on&quot;. Character personality has to come first, and it&#39;s also important to consider how your OC&#39;s abilities, if any, affect their lives and the world around them. It&#39;s part of why agents are thoroughly screen-tested by the PGs during the Permission process, the rest of course being how well they&#39;re written in general.<br><br>And, uh, if you didn&#39;t intend to fish for concrit when posting the OP, why post the OP? We look at just about any link to people&#39;s characters with a critical eye because we ourselves value well-written OCs. I understand that you&#39;re a friend of a friend and I&#39;m as willing to help you out as ever, but I hope you&#39;ll forgive me for stating that I don&#39;t think you thought this through. Then again I guess we all have those kinds of moments, sooo.<br><br>Also, please don&#39;t get the idea that we&#39;re scheming to tear down your reputation as a person, because believe me, people have actually tried to do that to me in the past and managed a partial success! :C We&#39;re always willing to lend a hand to anyone in need, and all you have to do is ask. It&#39;s just that your OP really sounded like a &quot;Look at these characters and admire them&quot; sort of deal, which I can say with confidence would not have ended well on any level in most other corners of the Internet. Malice isn&#39;t on our agenda - we&#39;re trying to help you as a writer and as a person - but I still feel like talking to me or Voyd in private before posting publicly would have been safer in hindsight. .<em>.<br><br>And lastly, well... here&#39;s a virtual hug from me, in the hopes of comforting you in the aftermath of all this.

            <p>I went into this having no idea what <i>Tokyo Mew Mew</i> might be. I couldn’t say that I know everything about it now, but I got a sufficient impression to see what’s wrong with the badfic.<br><br>While trying to whatch <i>Tokyo Mew Mew</i>, the agents get into a dispute about <i>Sailor  Moon</i>.It looks just like real life, although I don’t really understand what they are talking about, not knowing much more about this than I know about <i>Tokyo Mew Mew</i>. And then Ami reminds us that she isn’t human, and a totally unreal Delibird accepts the mission throwing a gift. Yeah, that’s HQ.<br><br>When gravity kicked in and Wile E. Coyote was referred, I started to smile, and I never stopped until the assassination. I like your humor.<br><br>There are some potential continuity errors:<br><br><i>&quot;That’s not how fire works. At all,&quot; said Miguel, catching the falling apostrophe.</i>  <br>But then:<br><i> Chris caught the fallen apostrophe and put it in his backpack with the spare periods.</i><br>Is this another apostrophe? Where did it come from?<br>Or did Miguel throw the apostrophe he had cought at Chris so that he could stow it away? Apparently not, because later <i>Miguel threw the apostrope at [the Stu]</i>.<br><br>Also:<br><i>Chris pulled out the first volume and looked at the opening pages.</i><br>Later:<br><i>“Hey, uh, question: What’s a ‘predasite’?” asked Chris, indicating part of the Words and putting away the first volume so he didn’t drop it in the next scene shift.</i><br>Even later:<br><i>Chris passed the first volume to Ami, who checked the chapter where Mint showed up.</i><br>So he still held it in his hand? Or when did he pull it out again? And what does he need Ami for? Last time we watched Chris was perfectly able to check it himself.<br><br>And:<br><i>“Not for long, you’re not, “ Ami grumbled. She kicked the mini-Stu that appeared into both the other mini-Stu’s body and a back wall of the café.</i><br>She kicked &quot;otaci&quot; into whom’s body? Is &quot;ostachui&quot; (or his corpse?) still around after the scene change? I thought &quot;ichiog&quot; and &quot;inchigo&quot; had killed him at &quot;the beach boardwalk amusement park&quot;. (This may actually be the body of &quot;itachi&quot;, spawned on the roller coaster, but apparently you didn’t notice &quot;itachi&quot; until he respawned at the audition.)<br><br>(Who is Kiki? Pudding’s name from the dub, misspelled? Figuring this out took me a while.)<br><br>Taking over the fic and telling the confrontation with the agents from the canons’ POV is not seen often and may actually be the first time; if done, it’s usually the Suvian’s POV. It works really well here, as does resetting canon by singing the theme song.<br><br>Ah well, the assassination. It put me off. It looked too much like torture for my taste. When I found the scene in the Floating Hyacinth’s office at the end, I expected for a moment that she was going to call them out for that.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>So... I just finished the new Ghostbusters movie today.<br><br>And my verdict?<br><br>Without spoiling anything, it&#39;s actually a fun, enjoyable flick! I have to say that the trailers made a very bad first impression and I was about to judge it poorly based on those alone, but watching this movie I could tell that there was a lot of love for the original and plenty of things to like about the new movie by itself. My engagement in the movie was a bit marred by the controversy surrounding its production at first, but that quickly went away as I started enjoying the plot, characters, effects, etc. I&#39;d definitely recommend seeing this movie and let&#39;s be honest, it did not deserve the enormous mess on the Internet the trailers ignited. :C<br><br>I&#39;m probably going to make a more detailed review of the movie on my Tumblr in due course, but for now, I&#39;ll leave this thread open to discussion about the movie itself and thoughts about it and all the controversy the trailers inspired. What say the rest of you?</p>

            <p>Just got back from seeing it myself. Final verdict?<br><br>There were enough changes for this to be its own movie, but it retained the same feel as the original. I got the impression it was pretty much one big love letter to the 1984 version.<br><br>Definitely can&#39;t wait for it to come out on DVD.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry for throwing a tantrum, for making myself look like a victim, and for offending the PPC community as a whole. It was a horrible thing to say, especially after all you people had done to me. I made a mistake of trying to put myself on the pedestal and turning the tables around so that I would be the one that was hurt, whereas the truth was completely opposite. I am truly sorry. It shall never happen again. One thing I can and will do to make things right is start seeing boundaries and respect people&#39;s decisions when they say &#39;stop&#39;.<br><br>To the victim of my harassment: I&#39;m sorry for being a controlling little ass. I&#39;m sorry for wanting to take control over your decisions, for thinking I was completely right all the time in doing so, and subsequently questioning your ability to make your own choices, disrespecting them, and calling them (and, by extension, you) stupid. Finally, I am sorry for then ignoring your obvious hints to stop pushing the subject further.</p>

            <p>Hello!  Newbie here.  Feel free to call me Aer, or Aero. Or any other appellation. I&#39;m not overly picky. <br><br>I&#39;ve only read the Original Series, and one or two other stories, sadly, but the humour and taking apart bad writing has convinced me it might be worth my while to crawl out of my cubby-hole and introduce myself. Way back when I was young, innocent, and naive to the ways of the internet, I had dreamt of myself as a fanfic writer (old shame, really).  I began a quest to seek out fine fanfics to use as examples of the shining standards of storytelling.  Needless to say, I encountered such disappointment in my search that I gave up on the dream for years.  <br><br>That is when I stumbled across the PPC.   </p>

            <p>And if you&#39;re still looking for top-quality fanfics, I recommend the &quot;Infinite Coffee and Protection Detail&quot; series by owlet on AO3. Set after &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier,&quot; the stories follow a deprogramming Bucky as he protects Steve from various HYDRA goons and generally adjusts to the future. Naturally, each of the other founding Avengers (and the Falcon) eventually play a role.<br><br>I found them consistently funny and interesting, though the parts dealing with Bucky&#39;s experiences as the Asset/Winter Soldier get sad and scary.</p>

            <p>Yes, I can see that.  It&#39;s grown rather...squishy. <br><br>I&#39;d reward you if you can prove you&#39;ve got them.  I&#39;m guessing that anyone who&#39;s read my introduction can already guess I&#39;m into LotR.  I&#39;m also a rabid fan of Neil Gaiman&#39;s The Sandman, pretty much anything Studio Ghibli puts out, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Hannibal.  I wouldn&#39;t say they&#39;re my top five, but they&#39;re definitely up there, and I figured they&#39;d be common enough to find like minds in most places.  </p>

            <p>I know it&#39;s got rave reviews already, but I cannot overstate how amazing it is, particularly in the context of a children&#39;s cartoon.  <br><br>Ghibli is my Disney.  I grew up on their work.  I feel like that left me with a lot of room for disappointment when I finally got that classic Disney I had so desired.  I love the subtlety of the storytelling, the heroines, and the art, of course, is stunning.  </p>

            <p>Heard the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owddukdxFv4">theme to Howl&#39;s Moving Castle</a>, recently. <br>It&#39;s bloody beautiful. <br><br>What do you mean by subtlety? I get sort of what you mean with it, (at least, what it looks like when something <i>doesn&#39;t</i> have subtle storytelling,) but what&#39;s specifically subtle in their stuff? <br>I need more reasons to beat myself up over not seeing their works. <br><br>I love subtlety, myself.

            <p>Joe Hisaishi is one of my favourite modern classical composers. One Summer&#39;s Day was the first piano piece I taught myself. <br><br>There&#39;s a lot of things they leave unsaid, or only hint at. Symbolism also comes into play. It&#39;s great that the audience (presumably the target audience remains children) are treated like they can grasp material that isn&#39;t shouted at them with a megaphone, can read between the lines, and tackle serious, unflanderized real-life issues that Disney films sometimes like to skirt over. And I love that their films are more character centred than plot-based. Heck My Neighbour Totoro doesn&#39;t really even have a plot. It&#39;s something I find much rarer in western animation.</p>

            <p>...you&#39;re just really touched by the music, my praising Ghibli, or if you&#39;ve actually gone and watched a film now. I do agree though.  I really loved it when there was subtle, complex storytelling, flawed, all-too-human characters, and ambiguous morality in my childhood fandoms.  Probably all a result of being weaned on Ghibli films.  <br><br>Also, are you by any chance British? </p>

            <p>So...<br>What do you guys thinks of shipping? I know that shipping characters with canon relationships is fine, but how about those ships about characters who are just friends or who don&#39;t have a romantic relationship, or who never interacted at all! The worst types maybe crossover ships.</p>

            <p>Does the writer <i>sell</i> it? I remember someone once complaining about a Lucy Pevensie/Sea Girl fic, but when almost everyone read it, they (myself included) thought it was extraordinarily well done. Personally, I&#39;d rather read a non-canonical shipfic that&#39;s well done than a flat, lifeless canon ship any day. In fact, though I know this is heresy, I prefer almost anything* to the official canon ships for Harry Potter. IMO, JK Rowling didn&#39;t really sell the pairings. They were all believable for high school sweethearts, but to jump from that to &quot;babies ever after&quot; seemed a bit much, to me. <br><br>So - yeah, I&#39;m all for it, as a fic type. As with just about any genre, my first and foremost qualification is Is It Well Written. Everything else is semantics. <br><br><br>*yes, really,<i> anything</i>. Even the canon pairings, which I have seen done well from time to time. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m the boring kind of fan who ships mostly canon and strongly-implied-to-be-canon ships. (Except Finn/Poe, because we need more interracial gay relationships between two complete dorks.) I also firmly believe that friendships are just as adorable and worthy of protection as regular ships. Not sure how I feel about crossover ships just yet.<br><br>Basically, as long as it&#39;s not creepy or stupidly out of character and you write or draw it well, I&#39;ll support your decision/right to ship it even if I don&#39;t ship it myself.

            <p>Fandom as we know it today can largely be traced back to Star Trek: TOA and the fanzines which circulated at the time. People, almost exclusively women and teenage girls, would submit fanfiction and fan art to these zines and it came mostly in two flavors: Kirk/Spock multichapter slashfic, or OC/Kirk usually a Mary Sue. There were, of course, exceptions, but most that was it. And this was so incredibly popular that these women actually saved Star Trek from being cancelled multiple times. Eventually it caught on and other TV shows got fandom zines. My mom has a binder of Quantum Leap fanfiction she typed on a typewriter because computers were not as common back then, and was too shy to send in to the QL fanzine.<br><br>Tl;dr, fandom was built on shipping, the rest came later.</p>

            <p>However, sometimes there are ships that simply occur just because. A pretty good example is the Plants vs. Zombies continua, as the characters have really bare bones personality, to the point that you could replace them without having to kill them. A pretty good example is Peashooter x Sunflower. While cute in the hands of talented artists and writers, there&#39;s no reason that the two would ever want to get together, since they lack any characteristics to do so, because those parts are blank slates. At this rate, Sunflower x Blover would be a more realistic ship, since they worked with each other in the Chinese version.<br><br>Speaking of which, I&#39;m considering labeling said continuum as a damaged one with its own rules for badfic (charge-worthy material shouldn&#39;t be charged unless it&#39;s actually bad/uncreative/Suvian, and unless it&#39;s bad psychology) (don&#39;t worry, I thought it through), and I&#39;m currently trying to write an agent who comes from it. But I digress.</p>

            <p>Shipping doesn&#39;t really hurt anyone after all. Certain ships I may not agree with, but honestly I will protect your right to ship whatever you want as long as it&#39;s clear you understand what the implications of certain relationships are.</p>

            <p>If it&#39;s canon compliant, great! This can include anything from canon ships, to ships the creator(s) have said could work even if they aren&#39;t canon, to ships that have been blatantly teased. If the characters are in a platonic relationship, that&#39;s where things get a little trickier. Are they the kinds of characters who would go &quot;Ew, no, X is like a brother/sister to me/We&#39;re friends and that&#39;s it&quot;, or would they be possibly open to a relationship with them? If it&#39;s the latter, then sure, go for it.<br><br>If it&#39;s not canon compliant, be it that the creator(s) have said &quot;Nope, no way, not in a million years&quot;, the characters actively hate each other and would have to be massively OOC for it to work, et cetera.<br><br>Of course, like all things, there are always exceptions. I have seen very well-written Leah Clearwater/Castiel before, and they&#39;re from two completely different canons. Do I ship it? Not really. (okay, maybe a little after seeing how well it can be done...) But good writing is good writing, and I enjoyed it immensely. I have seen well-written Dramione. I still don&#39;t ship that because there&#39;s just no way it would ever happen in canon. But the fic made it work, and work amazingly well.<br><br>So I would say: For the most part, keep things canon, because that&#39;s the easiest way to make it work. But if you can somehow pull off a noncanon ship, then write it, too!</p>

            <p>Specifically the shipping of people in a platonic relationship. <br>Romantic &#39;I want to nob you and make a mini-me burst out of your stomach in blood and poop and screams&#39; love is pretty overdosed, from what I&#39;ve seen. <br>There are very few cases where there will be two nice-looking lead characters of opposing gender who don&#39;t end up doing the romantic thing.

            <p>I&#39;m fine with canon ships, and ships that are left ambiguously defined, but my experience with shipping is that it gets wildly out of hand.  When people start plotting out romantic/erotic fantasies with characters who have a relationship that&#39;s been firmly established as platonic, or adversarial, it causes me pain.  That&#39;s not even mentioning the OOC of the characters involved, or the sudden sexuality switch when this happens.  It&#39;s just as ridiculous when the characters that have never interacted, and have no good reason to are shipped.  <br><br>That being said unnecessary romance has always been among my greatest pet peeves so I&#39;m writing this with a chip on my shoulder.  </p>

            <p>Now, there&#39;s something about Mudsdale that nobody seems to have picked up on, namely its style. People talk about it being a &quot;Trojan horse&quot; Pokémon because of its mane, which is in large part styled after a Trojan helmet. However, this doesn&#39;t tell the whole story, and it doesn&#39;t explain the long, thick bits of hair hanging down at the side. I <i>can</i> explain it, and more to the point, I will.<br><br>See, I dunno if you know this, but there&#39;s a very, very famous record label that specializes in reggae music. Y&#39;all may know that reggae is deeply associated with the Rastafari movement, which demands its practitioners wear dreadlocks. That label&#39;s name?<br><br>Trojan Records.<br><br>I put it to you that Mudsdale&#39;s <i>very design</i> is an elaborate compound pun on the part of the Pokémon Company&#39;s design team, which features at least one British national in James Turner. He&#39;s the first Westerner to be inducted into the hallowed halls of Game Freak&#39;s design coterie, where he designed the lines of Mandibuzz, Vanilluxe, and Golurk for Generation 5, and the Trevenant line for Generation 6. While I can&#39;t say for certain if he designed Mudsdale, it&#39;s not outside the realms of possibility that he may have had a hand in it.<br><br>So yeah. We have our first Rastamon. I suppose that explains the weakness to Grass. =]</p>

            <p>(and in general, what&#39;s going on with the weird characters)<br>I&#39;m going to start with a computer history lesson before I admit to silly mistakes made years ago. Part of this is that I&#39;m interested in all this stuff generally. Scroll rapidly if you don&#39;t mind being slightly confused.<br><br>Internally, computers have to represent the letters we post on the Board as numbers in order to do anything with them. This causes a problem: how do we assign numbers to letters? If two computers don&#39;t agree on what the numbers they&#39;re sending each other represent, you can get weird garbage text.<br><br>In the olden days, most of the Engilsh-speaking world standardized on ASCII (after some politics), which uses numbers between 0 and 2<sup>7</sup>-1 (127) to represent the characters available on a standard US keyboard and some other stuff.<br><br>This choice posed a problem for people who wrote with letters other than A-Z, or who didn&#39;t use $ for their currency, etc. They obviously wanted the computer to be able to use their characters, and they also wanted to talk with English-speaking people (and/or use their programs) without too much pain. <br><br>To solve this problem (at least around Europe[1]), people realized that bytes could go up to 255, and ASCII stopped at 127. This meant that they could fit any missing symbols they needed between 128 and 255. <br><br>Now this was a great idea, except that you couldn&#39;t fit <i>all</i> the missing letters into the 128 available slots. So, people in different parts of the world simply put in the symbols they cared about and ignored everyone else. And a great confusion was thereby loosed upon the Earth. If you took an email written in one of the Russian encodings and interpreted the bytes with a Western European encoding, it would look like garbage (except for the English). In the worst case, you would have to keep reinterpreting a document with every encoding you could think of until it made sense. Worse, you couldn&#39;t mix, say, Greek and Dutch in one document. Madness!<br><br>The solution to multiple competing standards is, of course, another standard. A while back, the <a href="http://unicode.org/charts/">Unicode consortium</a> decided that the problem was this one-byte thing, and published Unicode. The theory behind Unicode is simple: any character that people have used to write text, or any character that has appeared in a character encoding used by computers somewhere[2], should be given a number (or sequence of numbers, in some cases). The committee has given themselves the numbers between 0 and 2<sup>21</sup>-1 to work with, and they&#39;ve got plenty of room left.<br><br>Then, there was the question of how to represent this Unicode thing in computers. Just storing a sequence of 4-byte numbers seemed wasteful to English speakers (especially since any text would be 3/4ths 0 bytes), which would have killed the project. It also wasn&#39;t compatible with ASCII. The committee then came up with a clever solution called UTF-8, which uses [128,255] in a clever way to represent all of Unicode in a way that makes all ASCII text valid UTF-8[3].<br><br>Now on to our problems here on the Board. We (obviously) mostly post in ASCII, which is contained by most legacy European encodings and also UTF-8. The Board declares that the pages it sends us are in an encoding called &quot;Windows-1252&quot;, which contains several symbols and many accented latin letters on top of ASCII.<br><br>However, our posts are all over the place. Sometimes, we post our non-English things in UTF-8. Sometimes, we post in Windows-1252. This is all up to our web browsers, and we can&#39;t really do much about it as far as I can tell. <br><br>So, when I was scraping the Board, I had to deal with all this. T-Board, like a lot of recent software, stores all its text as UTF-8-encoded Unicode. So, I had to convert the Board posts to UTF-8. However, this would get weird if the posts were already UTF-8. I decided to <i>try</i> to interpret every post as Windows-1252, and re-encode it as UTF-8. If the process didn&#39;t work, the text was already in UTF-8, and we could move on. Failed applications of this rule is where all the Â and В come from, since some UTF-8 is also valid Windows-1252. If you want to fix them, see the runnable one-liner I created <a href="https://repl.it/Ch8D/0">at this link</a>.<br><br>This all sound straightforward, but there was a problem. When I wrote the archive script, I made a one-character typo in the encoding-related code. This resulted in, among other things, our love of &quot;Pokйmon&quot; instead of &quot;Pokémon&quot;. I have fixed the results of this mess in my copy of the Board scrape, and will probably be posting re-encoded archives with the 2016-2017 archive season (that is, next summer)[4].<br><br>Now, I would like to offer a plate of session cookies to the first person that figures out what typo I made. Hint: look at row E of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252#Code_page_layout">this chart</a> and also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1251#Code_page_layout">this chart</a>.<br><br>tl;dr: Tomash is a huge nerd, and also makes silly mistakes. Programming can be tricky, folks.<br><br>[1]: I don&#39;t know much about historical Asian, Arabic, etc. encodings, so I don&#39;t really know what they came up with<br><br>[2]: This is so that, you can go from encoding X to Unicode to X to Unicode ... without losing any information ever.[2.1]<br><br>[2.1]: This is where emoji came from. Japanese cell phone carriers encoded emoji, each in their own way, and the Unicode committee eventually promulgated a standard that all the carriers could agree on. Then, smartphone vendors had to support the Unicode group&#39;s decision, the characters became available on Western phones out of sheer laziness, and here we are.<br><br>[3]: This meant many Asian scripts went from a system with two bytes for many characters to three, but you can&#39;t please everyone, sadly.<br>[4]: Unless someone really wants them now. In that case, please ask.</p>

            <p>Maybe I&#39;m not looking at what I&#39;m meant to be looking at. When I click on a month in the index, I get a page with gray text on a light gray background, and links in blue. When I click on your Permission thread, though, I get the more familiar black and red on white, with horizontal lines as you mentioned.<br><br>On poking further, it seems as though opening a link in a new tab gets me the page rendered in black-red-white, while simply clicking on it gets me gray-blue-gray.<br><br>Also, 2008&#39;s 06a gives me a 404 error.<br><br>Using Firefox on Windows, BTW.

That&#39;s what Tomash has. Sparkle. He makes it more...&quot;<br><br>&quot;More real. I see.&quot; The figure reached up under his hood, rubbing his eyes. &quot;Very well, then. I will trespass no more on your time.&quot; He turned on his heel and stalked off into the crowd, lost to sight within seconds.<br><br>The Borrder turned to her friends, brow furrowed. &quot;Does <i>anyone</i> have <i>any</i> idea what that was all about?&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>That is a massively fun story to MST, it really is practically written for it. And you still managed to outdo the hilarity of the text itself! Impressive. I really enjoyed the interactions between Binkle and Finch - they&#39;re an excellent pair. </p>

            <p>Ah, good times, good times. Life is always better with Grignr around.<br><br>Did I say &#39;better&#39;?<br><br>I went into this for one reason: to reread some of <i>The Eye of Argon</i>. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the MST part of it actually complemented the experience. So hey! Good job.<br><br>I think what makes it good is the parts where you use the MST to highlight something that you&#39;d skip over if you were just reading. &#39;Lustfully&#39; is probably the classic example here, or maybe the right arm. Or... yeah, on rereading, you&#39;ve done this pretty consistently. Hooray!<br><br>hS, actually reading something this month!</p>

            <p>It&#39;s perfectly ridiculous. I will go back and read the whole thing when I&#39;m done reading LotR so as not to <s>ruin</s> spoil it for myself (which should take a while; I&#39;m only as far as the Council of Elrond).<br><br>Strangely enough, the thing which bothers me most about it is that the house in Rivendell is described as a &quot;crystalline palace.&quot; I&#39;ve been picturing it more like a big country house. . . am I missing something? Or is Boorman dramatically wrong here as in so many other cases? I dunno, I wouldn&#39;t call a &quot;crystalline palace&quot; a &quot;Homely House.&quot; And I wouldn&#39;t expect one to have a porch (I <i>know</i> there is a porch at Elrond&#39;s house. If I&#39;m not very much mistaken, it&#39;s where the council is held. Not on some glass table with naked Frodo)(I&#39;ve seen weird fan<s>dis</s>service before, but for some reason this takes the cake).<br><br>An incident with one thing wrong with it is a tragedy; an incident with a million things wrong with it is a statistic.<br><br>Hrrrrrr.<br><br>--Key is back, with shiny new fandoms.</p>
