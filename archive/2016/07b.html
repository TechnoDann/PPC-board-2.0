            <p>Unfortunately it’s not too short in the good, I-wanna-read-more way. I feel disappointed because I didn’t get what I expected.<br><br>It starts so good, with a subversion of the narrative laws of comedy, but then the first paragraph already ends in a small anti-climax. <i>She capped her marker.</i> Really? That’s all? No relief? No fear of the Ironic Overpower soon making something worse happen to even out the good luck? Is September even aware that she barely escaped destruction of what may have been the work of hours? Does she just take it for granted, because she feels entitled to be treated in a special way? I can’t even say that September is out of character here because there is no character; it looks more like a paint-by-number robot. (It there were a who-are-you-and-what-did-you-do-to- September moment later, I would praise you for subtle foreshadowing.)<br><br><i>Kelly had been reading ...</i> and then immediately <i>... hit the acknowledge button</i>. So, did she use the console’s screen to read an e-book? Did she read a physical book, sitting on a chair in front of the console? Why? Is this the only place where she can sit while September occupies the other chair at the table? This is the second time the agents leave the RC to go on a mission, and I still have no mental image of the RC. For the second time, I got the impression that you try to show some of the agents’ life outside of missions – which is a good thing – but then are too impatient to really show it and just want to get into the mission already.<br><br>But this time, the problems carry on into the mission that doesn’t feel much like a PPC mission. Kelly and September don’t show any reaction to being dragged out of their comfortable movie-watching chairs again and again (do they even have easy chairs and a wide-screen TV to watch the movie?); they just go in, allegedly watch what happens not ever interacting with the fic, come back and talk about what they watched. They could just as well sit in the RC, read the words and MST the thing.  <br><br>Maybe the fic just isn’t suitable for a PPC-style mission. I sincerely doubt that it’s suitable for the mission format you chose. True, there are great chunks of story just plagiarized from the movie. But apparently there are also chunks of story where the OC acts on her own, and the agents never get to see them, neither in the movie (obviously) nor going into this parts of the fic. How do they know that the OC is redeemable if they didn’t actually watch her closely? How can I know that the agents are right about the OC being redeemable if I don’t want to read the fic myself?<br><br><i>“They&#39;ll be fine without you. Peter&#39;s going to get hurt if you don&#39;t leave now,” September said.</i> <br>Now that’s something that works for me. The agents don’t always need brute force, and Kaya’s reaction, putting her duty of protecting the Pevensies above a selfish need to act out her story, clearly shows that the agents are right. (I just wish I could see that this is based on how Kaya acted off-page.)<br><br>Technical Error:<br><i>“But he is in the movie, and I don&#39;t want to take Peter to Medical if I don&#39;t have to.” Kelly said as she grabbed her gun.</i><br>Since <i>Kelly said ...</i> continues the sentence that started with what Kelly said, the period before this should be a comma.<br><br>There is one other point I need to address. I’m not a Narnia expert, but from an (admittedly superficial) internet search I got the impression that elves in Narnia are more fanon than canon.  How does it turn out <i>that there are elves living in the High Forest of Narnia</i>? Would sending Kaya back really be a good idea?<br><br>I’m sorry that this sounds so harsh, and I want to finish with the last words September wrote: <i>Keep writing.</i> I guess you got the right ideas. Just take the time to flesh them out. (What? There’s another one up already? I’m afraid.)<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>You&#39;re correct, canonically Narnia doesn&#39;t have any elves in it, nor is there any place called the &#39;High Forest&#39; in Narnia for them to live in. </p>

            <p>Nice job with your mission, especially with the good quotes from the fic and recruiting the OC. I&#39;d like to see a bit more about finding the fox in the plothole and perhaps more reason to recruit rather than execute the elf.<br><br>You made your mission very accessible to people not familiar with the Narnia universe, which was helpful to me. I look forward to the next mission/interlude!</p>

            <p>Took me long enough.<br><br>As I mentioned in a thread a few weeks ago, I was working on a brand new workshop all about writing reviews. And lo and behold, it is here! Click <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:PoorCynic/Workshop_5:_Writing_Missions">this link</a> to check it out and maybe pick up some tidbits about reviews. As always, there is an associated challenge with it. This particular one ties in nicely with our monthly challenge, which can be seen at the top of the main Board page.<br><br>Many thanks to Neshomeh for providing beta work and giving helpful insight.<br><br>Go forth and write well!</p>

            <p>As you may know, the release of <i>Pokemon Go</i> has been delayed in... anywhere that isn&#39;t Australia, New Zealand, or the USA. Even where it is out, it&#39;s apparently suffering from constant server issues.<br><br>On Sunday night, I decided that I was fed up with waiting. Sure, it took Nintendo/Niantic years to make their game, and it would probably only be a week or two before they rolled it out everywhere, but I&#39;m impatient! And I know JavaScript! How hard can it be?<br><br>Uh... not that hard, actually, provided you take a few shortcuts.<br><br>So I am pleased to introduce:<br><br><a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/">Pokemon Gone</a><br><br>The result of three whole days of work. I admit, it lacks a few things compared to <i>Pokemon Go</i>, such as... y&#39;know... the GPS stuff... but other than that, it&#39;s a fair substitute!<br><br>The observant among you may have noticed that there are no actual Pokemon behind that link. The <i>really</i> observant among you may have noticed that there&#39;s something slightly off about the text of this post. These two facts are connected. Instead of venturing outside to catch Pokemon for <i>Gone!</i>, you can stay right here on the Board!<br><br>Scattered across this p<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/DBHN.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>st, and across others of my posts on the front page, are tiny Pokeball symbols. If you click on one, you catch the Pokemon behind it!

(Bugs includes Pokeballs which don&#39;t link to proper pages - I&#39;m sure they exist! Also, the pages have been tested in Chrome and IE, but I don&#39;t have access to anything else.)<br><br><hr>

Can&#39;t you? The place to look is any post of mine where the subject line starts with a -. Keep an eye out for tiny Pokeballs replacing the letter &#39;o&#39;.<br><br>Q: I&#39;ve fought all the trainers! What do I do now?<br>A: Fight &#39;em again! Each time you enter a trainer&#39;s code, you get a fresh battle with a random member of their team, so there&#39;s always another chance.<br><br>Q: But there&#39;s only five of them and I&#39;m booooored.<br>A: Share your Gym Code on the subthread, and pick up someone else&#39;s Gym Code to fight their team! It works exactly the same as the trainers above.<br><br>Q: What Pokemon are in this?<br>A: As I write this, <i>Pokemon Gone!</i> includes the first 27 Pokemon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). I&#39;m adding more, but it&#39;s slow going. Eventually, I aim to have the entire Gen III Pokedex imported.<br><br>Q: HAH! I&#39;ve reverse-engineered your code and can give myself anything I want!

But it&#39;s also easy to just lie and say you did. There&#39;s no scoreboards or anything, so why not play the game how it&#39;s meant to be played?<br><br>Q: What&#39;s next for <i>Pokemon Gone!</i>?<br>A: The first thing is of course increasing the number of Pokemon - no-one wants to play too long with just Zigzagoon for company. As the Pokemon roll in, I&#39;ll add new trainers and Gym Leaders (Nentъrл&#39;s a bit lonely right now). I also want to write up an introduction page from Professor Mall<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PokemonGone/CM1G.htm"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/PokemonGone/pkbl.gif"></a>rn (^</em>~). Eventually I&#39;ll be scattering Pokeballs across my site, to give the game a permanent home. There&#39;s a few changes I&#39;d like to make to the game itself - such as splitting ATK and SP.ATK back up - but I&#39;ll probably only do that if it becomes enduringly popular for some reason.<br><br>Q: Should I play this game and tell you what I think about it?<br>A: Why yes, as it happens, you should! :D<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Since you did sort of dare me to look at your code, and I was a TA for a computer architecture class last semester, I felt the urge to give you concrit on your thing.<br><br>- Your JS<br><br>1) Powers That Be in a bucket, indent your code! (Unless you were deliberately going for the unreadable look, of course). If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d accuse you of coding in <i>Notepad</i>. (Note: if you are actually coding in Notepad, I&#39;ve heard good things about Notepad++ on Windows, or you can pick up Emacs (or maybe Vim, if you like second-best) if you want to jump in the deep end of coding editors, but Google around for a good config in those cases)<br><br>2) Several variable should probably be dictionaries/Objects, not arrays. The main reason for this is that arrays use memory proportional to the largest valid index (that is, if you do <tt>var a = []; a[200000] = 5</tt>, you&#39;ll also use memory space for all of the <tt>undefined</tt>s that go in slots 0 through 199999. <br><br>2b) Which brings me to my next point, <tt>indexOf()</tt>, which is, as the theorists say, O(n). That is, the more Pokemon you add, the slower it will get, especially for errors. This can be avoided by dropping <tt>pokindex</tt> entirely and making <tt>pokedex</tt> an Object (<tt>var pokedex = {}</tt>).<br><br>This will allow you to check membership by simply doing <tt>numMon in pokedex</tt>. Also, you get the Magic that is JavaScript auto-coersion (most such things are terrible ideas but it&#39;s presence is not your fault). That is, if you do <tt>foo = {1: 2}</tt>, then <tt>foo[&quot;1&quot;] == foo[1]</tt>.<br><br>3) If you ever find yourself copy-pasting the same code several times and making minor changes (especially if there are variable suffixes such as thingA, thingB, ... involved), you might want to find another way to express what you&#39;re going for.<br><br>For example, here&#39;s a very functional-programming way to go from uppercase <tt>txt</tt> to <tt>digits</tt><br><br><pre><br>var digits = txt.split(&quot;&quot;).map(function (char) { return char.charCodeAt(0).toString(); }).join(&quot;&quot;)<br></pre>
<br><br>(plop the <tt>.toUpperCase()</tt> in there for extra golf)<br><br>3) atkset{1-4} should really be an array-of-arrays called <tt>atkSet</tt> for DRY (don&#39;t repeat yourself) reasons<br><br>4) <tt>&quot;&quot;.concat(foo[0],foo[1]...)</tt> is <tt>foo.join(&quot;&quot;)</tt> So, I might have written <tt>var trainOut = trainlets.join(&quot;&quot;) + document.getElementById(&quot;namecode&quot;).value)</tt><br><br>5) <tt>+</tt> works on strings, and might be advisable when there&#39;s only two<br><br>6) <tt>Verifier()</tt> is O(n) (and uppercase, which is usually reserved for constructors like <tt>Monster</tt>). To make it faster, you might want this<br><pre><br>function setLike()<br>{<br>    var ret = {};<br>    var numArguments = arguments.length;<br>    for (var i = 0; i         ret[arguments[i]] = true<br>    }<br>    return ret;<br>}<br></pre>
<br><br>and to pull <tt>allowed</tt> out into something like <tt>ALLOWED_FROBS</tt> to avoid re-defining it every time.<br><br>7) One-based indexing makes people cry. Are you a mathematician?<br><br>8) Similarly, using <tt>n</tt> as the index for a loop is just a bit odd, since <tt>n</tt> is often the length of the thing you&#39;re looping over, so <tt>foo[n-1]</tt> feels like assignment to the last element of the array. The usual loop variables are <tt>i</tt>, then <tt>j</tt>, (and <tt>k</tt> if you&#39;re doing matrix multiply, or other crazy things)<br><br>9) On the positive side, the code is split into functions, is understandable, and uses clear variable names (!).<br><br>10) Do you wont to get modern? Do you want to add an optional feature that works for everyone other than people on old internet explorer versions? Try <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a>. It&#39;s the hot net thing, and might actually be useful? You could stick the save code in there and re-populate the page on re-load.<br><br>Your HTML/CSS:<br><br>1) Putting a style on each thing, especially if you&#39;re copy-pasting them around, is, to put it strongly, Doing It Wrong. <br><br>You can assign classes to HTML things, and then style everything that shares a class at once.<br><br>For example<br><pre><br>&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;<br>.blockimg {<br>    width:50px;<br>    height:50px;<br>    position:absolute;<br>    left: 200px;<br>    top: 95px;<br>}<br>&lt;/style&gt;<br></pre>
<br>Then, you can put <tt>class=&quot;blockimg</tt> on all the image placeholders instead of copy-pasting. This reduces redundancy and makes it easier for you to change your mind.<br><br>2) Absolute widths in pixels make me personally sad. My eyes are perma-not-great, so I have instructed my browser to bump fonts to at least 16pt no matter what the developer wants. This means that I can&#39;t read the whole &quot;Go(ne)&quot; button. The exact remedy for this depends on what you&#39;re doing.<br><br>2a) em is a unit that is relative to the current font (and font size).<br><br>2b) If you&#39;re willing to rewrite everything, absolute positioning is vaguely considered not a great idea (mainly because cell phones). Many people use some variant of a <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-css-grid-systems/">grid layout</a> (have not used their code, but looks not-bad). If you want, leaving extra padding columns on the right (empty <tt>div</tt>s) will probably keep the current look.<br><br>But, the game is pretty cool, and it&#39;s pretty good for something made in three days. (I&#39;ve seen worse.)<br><br>- Tomash, who didn&#39;t plan on this getting so long, and hopes he&#39;s not being too harsh</p>

Doing an on-page stylesheet is a good idea, and one I&#39;ll definitely look into when I&#39;m in a coding mood again.

            <p>1) Called it :). One thing I might recommend is using tabs to indent (despite the viewer-dependent length issue) since that&#39;s one key per level not {2,4,8} spaces.<br><br>2) Dictionaries. Also knows as maps, associative arrays, hashes, and maybe several other things. These are surprisingly useful things. They&#39;re sort of generalizations of arrays. Arrays let you quickly do Integer → stuff (especially if the integers are small). Dictionaries let you quickly do stuff → stuff (in stronger-typed languages, it&#39;s Key type → Value type). The usual way to make one is a hash table (look those up if you want to learn something).<br><br>To make an empty dictionary, use <tt>{}</tt>. Dictionaries with values in them are <tt>{key: value, key: value, ...}</tt> in JavaScript (some languages will use <tt>=&gt;</tt> instead). To look something up in a dictionary, use <tt>dict[key]</tt>, basically like arrays.<br><br>JavaScript is also a bit finicky, because objects are (as far as I can tell) dictionaries. That is, instead of doing <tt>&quot;&quot;.concat(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)</tt>, you can do <tt>&quot;&quot;<a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2016/%22foo%22," title="bar">&quot;concat&quot;</a></tt>.<br><br>This also creates the &quot;feature&quot; that in JavaScript dictionaries, all the keys are automatically converted to strings. (I&#39;m aiming for, roughly, program correctness research, so I&#39;m not a JS fan)<br><br>3) Ok, so I&#39;m going to want to go through that.<br><br>- We start with the uppercase string <tt>txt</tt><br><br>- Then, we <tt>.split(&quot;&quot;)</tt> it. <tt>split(sep)</tt> splits the string at places where <tt>sep</tt> occurs and returns a list of the parts, with the separators removed. In this case, this method creates an array of strings, where each string is one character from the original text<br><br>- Now, we come to a function that&#39;s well known in functional programming circles, that is <tt>array.map(function)</tt>. Map conceptually replaces each element <tt>x</tt> of the array by <tt>function(x)</tt> (it actually creates a new array with those results, but yeah). In our case, the function takes each one-character string in the array, takes the char code of the 0th (and only) character, and then converts that to a string. So <tt>[&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;].map(Number)</tt> gives <tt>[1, 2]</tt> and <tt>[&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;].map(function (char) { return char.charCodeAt(0).toString(); })</tt> gives <tt>[&quot;65&quot;, &quot;66&quot;]</tt><br><br>- The final <tt>.join(&quot;&quot;)</tt> flattens the array of strings into one long string, which gives you the 8-character <tt>digits</tt> (&quot;AaBbCcDd&quot;, as you put it) you were constructing earlier<br><br>4) It&#39;s not particularly obvious that that&#39;s a thing you can do. Thank you Stack Overflow!<br><br>5) That is a JavaScript &quot;feature&quot; <i>sigh</i><br><br>6) So, javascript (until last year&#39;s standard) is missing some form of set datatype. So, that function fakes one. Instead of having a set of things, you have a dictionary with the things as keys, but their value is always something meaningless and small, like <tt>true</tt>. Then, you have what you wanted out of a set data structure (fast membership testing, fast add, and fast remove) (ignoring pathological cases that shouldn&#39;t ever come up)<br><br>6b) So, several general guidelines for most C-like languages (check some variant of &quot;$lang style guide&quot; for specifics and minor cultural things.<br><br>- Types (and type-like things, such as constructors for types), start with a capital letter<br><br>- Functions and variables start lowercase.<br><br>- <tt>snake<em>case</tt> vs. <tt>camelCase</tt> vs.depends-on-what-you&#39;re-naming is a social thing per-project, and, in open source code, roughly per language. JavaScript uses camelCase everywhere.<br><br>- Constants like PI are ALL</em>CAPS<br><br>- Pick a style for brace placement and stick with it, stay away from the flamewars.<br><br>- In general, <tt>foo(1)</tt> and <tt>bar[1]</tt> but <tt>while (1)</tt><br><br>- Extra line breaks to make things fit roughly in 80ish characters helps avoid really long lines, which cause(d) problems<br><br>7) Fun. My mother&#39;s also a chemist. She did/does sort of polymer-related industrial research, IIRC, but then she went over to the dark side (aka management)<br><br>I figure this means you&#39;ve been around enough physicists (who&#39;ve hung around with certain groups of mathematicians) to pick up the [1, N] method of numbering N things, instead of the CS people&#39;s [0, N). I&#39;m still somewhat salty that a perfectly reasonable uniform floor numbering system made it so the basement of the CS building is floor 1, not floor 0 :). <br> <br>8) You&#39;ve run into another JavaScript &quot;feature&quot;. If, when you create a variable, you do <tt>i = 0;</tt> instead of <tt>var i = 0;</tt>, <tt>i</tt> become a <b>global</b> variable, and isn&#39;t isolated to your functions. This also applies to your for loops. So, use <tt>for (var i = 0; i  and your problem goes away.<br><br>9) Well, that&#39;s one good reason to be using functions, along with the whole code reuse thing. It sometimes takes people a while to pick up on this.<br><br>10) Are you feeling lazy? Tell us there&#39;s a 6 or so character erase code, like &quot;000000&quot;, to allow dismissing a Pokйmon. Then, just add that in. Saves you making a button.</tt></p>

            <p>You&#39;ve beaten my second obstacle, and only had what, three deaths? But we&#39;ll see how you do against Ace Trainer Isabell! She&#39;s the one I eventually gave up recording while I was training, because it took longer to record than it did to actually fight. Oh, by the way, did I mention that the Gym Leader has a little surprise up his sleeve? Since there were only five normal types when I made the gym, not counting Azurill, I had to fill in the spot with something, so let&#39;s see how you do against that something... if you get that far.

            <p>First up, I&#39;m going to admit that I haven&#39;t opened the doc up yet, but I think a couple of things need to be said before I do. <br><br>Right, &#39;I didn&#39;t manage to find a beta...&#39; You put up a post asking for a beta for this mission on the 2nd June, and then haven&#39;t really mentioned it since, alright I&#39;ll agree that no-one said they&#39;d definitely beta this for you then, but you could have asked again at some other time for people to beta it, like you did with the Harry Potter/Dollhouse mission. Instead there&#39;s one post mentioning it over a month ago and after one failed try it&#39;s &#39;I didn&#39;t manage to find a beta&#39;. Hell, if you&#39;d emailed me about it I would have been willing to beta it for you, Star Trek may not be my forte but I know enough about it to be able to beta a mission in it (so long as its not DS9) and I&#39;d have been willing to look over it if you&#39;d needed someone to. I always find that the best thing to do if you don&#39;t have something is ask, ask and ask again, there are a couple of tutors at my old uni who I swear would be happy if they didn&#39;t see another email from me again because of the amount of times I pestered them with questions about how to do certain bits of maths. <br><br>Secondly, it&#39;s always good to see mission&#39;s popping up on the board, but I think it may not be a bad idea for you to slow down just a bit. I don&#39;t mean this in any rude way, but I think that slowing down the speed you&#39;re writing missions at would perhaps help, I understand that people write at different speeds and I&#39;m quite happy to plod along quite slowly, but taking a breather isn&#39;t a bad thing, I always find I spot more of my own mistakes if I take breaks between me writing something and me reading it through, sometimes those breaks last a couple of days, sometimes they&#39;re a few hours, but by taking those breaks I find that when I come back to the piece of writing I&#39;m able to give it a more critical eye and spot more errors than if I&#39;m reading it through almost immediately after writing it.<br><br>Once again, I don&#39;t mean to be rude, or for anything to be taken the wrong way, but personally I feel that these things need to be said. If you want to call me out of either of these points, or want me to explain anything that I&#39;ve said I&#39;m happy to do so either on the board on by email (ig you can&#39;t find my email it should be linked at the top)<br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p><i>Anything he imagines comes true ...</i><br><br>How does this work? What happens if he imagines something implausible or physically impossible (supposed the setting isn’t so magically that nothing actually is impossible)? <br><br>I imagine &quot;K’eth&quot; attempting to cross a road, and he thinks <i>Uh, this is a dangerous situation. I may be run over by a truck.</i> CRASH! <br><br>How would such experiences inform his personality? Would he become overly cautious, never daring to do anything dangerous, because he can’t avoid imagining possible consequences?<br><br>Ah, no. I see he became reckless, never thinking about consequences, because that’s the only way to avoid them.<br><br>Why does he have all those redundant weapons? Can’t he just grab a stick and imagine that it transforms into the weapon he needs?<br><br>Well, I imagine that’s actually how he got &quot;Fearstriker&quot;; he just imagined it, and then he kept it, because carrying a sword around is easier than imagining it again when he needs it again. So, &quot;imagining&quot; isn’t easy, it takes some toll (I wonder what that might be). <br><br>Played in the right way, &quot;K’eth&quot; may be an interesting character. Put into the wrong hands, he may become a terrible Gary Stu. So keep him, play him, make him grow!<br><br>The others didn’t tickle my imagination in the same way, and I don’t see the point in creating characters when you apparently don’t intend to use them anyway.<br><br>HG<br><br>PS: Agent Hieronymus’s Power of Imagination doesn’t plagiarize &quot;K’eth&quot;.

            <p>Well for the first one, he would have to go out of his way using his powers to make something implausible or impossible work. He could do it, but it would take a long time for it to be right. And to answer your second question, he realized quickly that his powers can screw him over. So he made it so that when ever he wants to use his powers. He has to start each thought with the words &quot;I imagine...&quot; Or else nothing happens.<br><br>While this does take longer and leaves him up to be attacked while in thought. He doesn&#39;t have to live in fear of him accidentally destroying the universe.<br><br>And yes his power can &#39;cover up&#39; or destroy Plotholes, but only for more plotholes to show up.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve RPed with K&#39;eth (both the user and the character); K&#39;eth the character honestly doesn&#39;t seem like too much of a Gary Stu to me. From what I understand, he&#39;s an anthropomorphic personification of imagination; his reality-altering abilities are an extension of that.<br><br>As for a personality: he&#39;s a trickster god. He delights in screwing with people, and thinks that (among other things) angry demigods are the most hilarious thing he&#39;s ever seen. He never causes or intends lasting harm; he&#39;s an all-powerful prankster who hates boredom and dullness.<br><br>Sues meet their goals without effort... K&#39;eth just happens to not really have any goals beyond his own entertainment. He&#39;s a creature of whims, with no far-reaching ambitions or plans. All he wants to do is make life more interesting (even if that involves randomly turning into a girl and making out with someone, which he has done before).<br><br>Is he fit for duty as a PPC agent? Absolutely not. While not truly a Stu (at least in my mind), he&#39;s still a reality-warper and he probably wouldn&#39;t get along with the Flowers. He&#39;s too powerful for Action departments, and unlike Jenni he wouldn&#39;t keep his powers in check because he&#39;d probably be eternally bored without them.<br><br>I can&#39;t really speak for the rest of K&#39;eth&#39;s OCs; I&#39;m not as familiar with them as I am with the Embodiment of Imagination.</p>

I knew I was going to get...&#39;hate&#39; for it. But I did it anyways....What the hell am I saying. I&#39;m going to dump my head in bleach, later.</p>

            <p>Seriously, I&#39;m still confused about what you were expecting. Did you just want people to go &#39;ah yes this is a 100% great bunch of characters, good job&#39;? Did you want the page views on that to just increase? I&#39;m genuinely confused here.<br><br>Also, nothing Ix said could be construed as hate or even &#39;hate.&#39; Further, suicide threats?

            <p>Didn&#39;t read this particular thread until after I replied to the OP ^^; Anyway, yeah. I second what the others have said - I&#39;ve seen some other OCs on the MGE Wiki that are built in the same way as yours, i.e. &quot;a list of powers with a personality tacked on&quot;. Character personality has to come first, and it&#39;s also important to consider how your OC&#39;s abilities, if any, affect their lives and the world around them. It&#39;s part of why agents are thoroughly screen-tested by the PGs during the Permission process, the rest of course being how well they&#39;re written in general.<br><br>And, uh, if you didn&#39;t intend to fish for concrit when posting the OP, why post the OP? We look at just about any link to people&#39;s characters with a critical eye because we ourselves value well-written OCs. I understand that you&#39;re a friend of a friend and I&#39;m as willing to help you out as ever, but I hope you&#39;ll forgive me for stating that I don&#39;t think you thought this through. Then again I guess we all have those kinds of moments, sooo.<br><br>Also, please don&#39;t get the idea that we&#39;re scheming to tear down your reputation as a person, because believe me, people have actually tried to do that to me in the past and managed a partial success! :C We&#39;re always willing to lend a hand to anyone in need, and all you have to do is ask. It&#39;s just that your OP really sounded like a &quot;Look at these characters and admire them&quot; sort of deal, which I can say with confidence would not have ended well on any level in most other corners of the Internet. Malice isn&#39;t on our agenda - we&#39;re trying to help you as a writer and as a person - but I still feel like talking to me or Voyd in private before posting publicly would have been safer in hindsight. .<em>.<br><br>And lastly, well... here&#39;s a virtual hug from me, in the hopes of comforting you in the aftermath of all this.

            <p>So... I just finished the new Ghostbusters movie today.<br><br>And my verdict?<br><br>Without spoiling anything, it&#39;s actually a fun, enjoyable flick! I have to say that the trailers made a very bad first impression and I was about to judge it poorly based on those alone, but watching this movie I could tell that there was a lot of love for the original and plenty of things to like about the new movie by itself. My engagement in the movie was a bit marred by the controversy surrounding its production at first, but that quickly went away as I started enjoying the plot, characters, effects, etc. I&#39;d definitely recommend seeing this movie and let&#39;s be honest, it did not deserve the enormous mess on the Internet the trailers ignited. :C<br><br>I&#39;m probably going to make a more detailed review of the movie on my Tumblr in due course, but for now, I&#39;ll leave this thread open to discussion about the movie itself and thoughts about it and all the controversy the trailers inspired. What say the rest of you?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry for throwing a tantrum, for making myself look like a victim, and for offending the PPC community as a whole. It was a horrible thing to say, especially after all you people had done to me. I made a mistake of trying to put myself on the pedestal and turning the tables around so that I would be the one that was hurt, whereas the truth was completely opposite. I am truly sorry. It shall never happen again. One thing I can and will do to make things right is start seeing boundaries and respect people&#39;s decisions when they say &#39;stop&#39;.<br><br>To the victim of my harassment: I&#39;m sorry for being a controlling little ass. I&#39;m sorry for wanting to take control over your decisions, for thinking I was completely right all the time in doing so, and subsequently questioning your ability to make your own choices, disrespecting them, and calling them (and, by extension, you) stupid. Finally, I am sorry for then ignoring your obvious hints to stop pushing the subject further.</p>
