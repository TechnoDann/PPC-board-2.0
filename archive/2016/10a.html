            <p>You know, I&#39;ve had an epiphany recently, and that epiphany is: writing permission prompts involving a pair of characters who may be horribly broken is probably a <i><a href="http://www.BadIdea.com">www.BadIdea.com</a></i>, and may end up being a bit of a <i><a href="http://www.WasteofTime.gov">www.WasteofTime.gov</a></i>, and might end up with me looking a little bit <i><a href="http://www.Silly.bly">www.Silly.bly</a></i>.<br><br>So, I did what I always do in my time of need, and panicked needlessly and called the police! <br>Also, I rang the beta bell! <br>Got to have people checking on my agents, Maz and Yocherry.

            <p>I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s a &quot;safety feature&quot; Wikia employs on mobile to make sure people don&#39;t get redirected to sites they weren&#39;t wanting to access—although, I&#39;ve certainly opened missions from Wikia pages before.

            <p>Firstly, I&#39;m thinking about an elan psychic warrior, ascetic or dervish path, or an elven magus with dervish build, as my characters.<br><br>But, given the fact people cannot always be there for every game, why not go for the group being part of some mercenary organization?

            <p>But I&#39;m a little apprehensive. I haven&#39;t played a tabletop game since my first group four or five years ago, and I&#39;ve never played online before.

            <p>The animation is just gorgeous.

Now about that Gorilla Grimm... since every species is named after something famous (Beowolves for... well, Beowulf, and Nevermores from Poe&#39;s <i>Raven</i>), I&#39;m gonna go on a lim and say this one&#39;s name is Kong.<br><br>And of course... mah girls. Ruby looks awesome, Weiss looks trapped in her prison of a house, Blake is just a vigilante and Yang looks like a street brawler. Also, Ren and Nora grew their hair from the looks of it.</p>

            <p>Greetings to all!<br><br>I started hanging around the PPC in 2011, then returned for a brief stint in 2013, but haven&#39;t been able to stick with it, due to school and personal life stuff. Now, however, I am graduated and hoping to return to the PPC on a more permanent basis!<br><br>Which leads me to a thought I had. I&#39;ve been messing around with Sims3, specifically the Create-A-World function. In the course of that, I recalled the PPC had one place that isn&#39;t completely irrational - New Caledonia, the PPC city.<br><br>I&#39;ve done some looking at the wiki, and come up with a general gameplan for making New Caledonia, Sim style. My question is, would that be okay with people? And if I do make the world, I would want to populate it with Sims based on agents, so who would be okay with that?</p>

            <p>Hey everyone! We&#39;ve got two new things here for you to peruse and (hopefully) enjoy. The first is another post-PPC Hunger Games story, featuring both <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-i1Uu8A9ZRkBSpJt5aLZuYitMcgXiMwpUcSEq2XPWAM/pub">Library and Gremlin</a>.<br><br>The second is <a href="https://en.shindanmaker.com/667112">an agent test</a> that July whipped up. Find out just what kind of PPC agent you would be, including details like your preferred weapon and which Headuarters incident you were involved in!<br><br>Feedback is, of course, always appreciated. Posting your results from the test would also be appreciated.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>Because I rather liked it, and I don&#39;t understand why people didn&#39;t comment on it. It&#39;s always nice to see Library get a bit of airtime, and her interactions with Gremlin are amusing and fun to read. This was a good, solid read and I am glad of its existence; I wasn&#39;t super active in either Hunger Games&#39;s RP element, and I <i>won</i> one of them, so it&#39;s kind of got me thinking about doing a brief interlude involving Lola.<br><br>Also:-<br><br><i>Agent Cassandra Heath is part of the Department of Implausible Crossovers. Their main fandoms are Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Sherlock Holmes, and Halo, but they keep getting missions into The Inheritance Cycle. A katana is their preferred weapon. A giant spork is something they are known for using to unexpected results. Agent Cassandra Heath is infamous for accidentally setting loose a horde of kittens in HQ. They are considered normal for the PPC.</i><br><br><i>Agent Melanie Bloxham is part of A/V Division. Their main fandoms are Yu Yu Hakusho, Battlestar Galactica, and Dragonriders of Pern, but they keep getting missions into Harry Potter. A sledgehammer is their preferred weapon. Their fists are something they are known for using to unexpected results. Agent Melanie Bloxham is infamous for accidentally setting loose a horde of kittens in HQ. They are considered normal for the PPC.</i><br><br>===<br><br>&quot;I keep telling people, it&#39;s not a katana, it&#39;s a <i>kiem</i>! Completely different country, completely different swordsmithing traditions, it&#39;s more like a jian than anything else, but no, it&#39;s Asian and it&#39;s a sword, it <i>has</i> to be a katana, which means I wind up listening them blathering on about some Godforsaken animoo rubbish forever an&#39; a day...&quot;<br><br>Mel smiled benevolently as Cass continued to rant. They&#39;d met about a year ago, during the Kitten Incident (or, as the Monitor&#39;s headline had called it, Apocalypse Meow), and had really hit it off. Like, turn up in each other&#39;s RCs only to not leave for weeks hit it off. People said they looked good together, though; Cass was a gangly, bony beanpole with a mane of hair permanently singed at the ends by dragon fire, while Mel had the short and stocky build that suited lugging camera equipment around at a dead run when someone heard the Clown&#39;s fateful approach.<br><br>She dipped back into the conversation, more of a rant really-<br><br>&quot;And that&#39;s why they really need to pay more attention, because in <i>Elementary</i> they retain a plot point involving identical twins but use an iris scanner as the lock on the locked-room mystery, which is just <i>daft</i> because even identical twins don&#39;t have the same irises, while on <i>Sherlock</i>...&quot;<br><br>-and dipped back out again, just smiling and nodding. She knew that when Cassie had built up a head of steam about something it&#39;d be more worth your time to talk a Hiei-lusting agent into going into Face The Strange, so she stroked the tall girl&#39;s hand and made the appropriate noises.<br><br>Introverts and extroverts made up pretty much every team in the PPC, and they were no exception. Mel was the one who dragged them out to parties and meetings and the occasional agent munch, while Cass just devoured canon books and designed things, from weird tabletop games themed around giant dieselpunk mecha to mods for a game she couldn&#39;t even get her RC&#39;s monitor to run properly. <i>To look at us now</i>, she thought, <i>you&#39;d think it&#39;d be the other way around.</i><br><br>Perhaps it was, she thought. Perhaps it was.</p>

            <p>But that&#39;s always the danger of sharing two different things at once: people will focus on one (particularly if it&#39;s interactive) and the other won&#39;t get many comments.<br><br>But, to be fair, at least four people commented on the story, which may actually be above par for the Board these days.

The greatest weapon there is!)</b><br><br>Agent Pretzel is infamous for telling people pollen is plant sperm. <b>(Hehehe... This does kind of sound like something I&#39;d do...)</b><br><br>They are considered mostly lucid. <b>(Aw, only mostly? Though after working in the Cafeteria, I can see why.)</b><br><br><br>And now for my real first name...<br><br>Agent Christy is part of DoSAT. <b>(Nice. Probably one of the departments I&#39;d actually want to go into.)</b>)<br><br>Their main fandoms are Kingdom Hearts, Les Misérables, and Inuyasha, but they keep getting missions into Twilight. <b>(Wow. Of all of these, I&#39;m vaguely conversant with Les Mis and hate Twilight with a passion. Huzzah!)</b><br><br>A mace is their preferred weapon. <b>(...I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s a very small mace.

I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to be hefting a standard battle mace any time soon.)</b><br><br>A knife is something they are known for using to unexpected results. <b>(Like making tasty food!)</b><br><br>Agent Christy is infamous for being part of a secret book club. <b>(Oh, nice! Wonder what kinds of books are talked about...)</b><br><br>They are considered boringly sane. <b>(Huh. I must&#39;ve just started at the PPC, then, rather than being... Oh, wow-- an eight-year oldbie. Dang, time flies.)</b></p>

It were the badfic games, after all.<br><br><i>Their main fandoms are Dragon Ball, Transformers, and The Inheritance Cycle, but they keep getting missions into My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic.</i> – Well, I recognize all four titles, but that&#39;s next to all I can say about &quot;my&quot; fandoms.

            <p>I really like the way you weave together a bunch of different strands - the agents&#39; fleeting encounters in two separate violent events becomes an actual theme, not just a coincidence.

            <p>First, my agents.<br><br><i>Agent Richard Legard is part of the Department of Character Protective Services.<br>Their main fandoms are Yu Yu Hakusho, CLAMP, and A Song of Ice and Fire, but they keep getting missions into Firefly.<br>Critical reasoning is their preferred weapon. <br>A giant spork is something they are known for using to unexpected results.<br>Agent Richard Legard is infamous for reading bad fiction from the 1600s aloud through the corridors.<br>They are considered not all there.</i><br><br>Now, I can iagine him in this department, reading ASoIaF, a bit CLAMP... But no knowledge of the two others. Lie the weapon and th surprise, and the rest of the trivia is adequate.<br><br><i>Agent Marina Nicodelli is part of Building Maintenance.<br>Their main fandoms are The Inheritance Cycle, Babylon 5, and The Phantom of the Opera, but they keep getting missions into Tokyo Mew Mew.<br>A longsword is their preferred weapon. <br>A katana is something they are known for using to unexpected results.<br>Agent Marina Nicodelli is infamous for telling people pollen is plant sperm.<br>They are considered a little crazy for the PPC.</i><br><br>Hum, I&#39;ve got a massive nothing here about Marina. Maybe other could see her as crazy, but for the rest... I&#39;d totally like these weapons for me, though<br><br>And after that, results for my Boarder pseudo and real name!<br><br><i>Agent Richard redacted is part of the Division of Cool and Unusual Punishment.<br>Their main fandoms are Kingdom Hearts, Dragon Ball, and The Legend of Zelda, but they keep getting missions into The Phantom of the Opera.<br>A lightsaber is their preferred weapon. <br>A chainsaw is something they are known for using to unexpected results.<br>Agent Richard is infamous for getting too heated about whether a certain fanfiction was a Mary Sue fic or not and ending it with a duel.<br>They are considered boringly sane.</i><br><br>Alright, I can see me in this department, and I read DB, but my knowledge about the other ones... Like the lightsabeer, ut I don&#39;t have the build for a chainsaw. Besides, <i>Zombie Survival Guide</i> explains well why it&#39;s a bad idea. The duel, verbal perhaps, but I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t fit the boringly sane bill at all.<br><br><i>Agent Hardric is part of the Department of Bad Slash.<br>Their main fandoms are Young Wizards, Battlestar Galactica, and The Legend of Zelda, but they keep getting missions into Young Wizards.<br>A knife is their preferred weapon. <br>A shovel is something they are known for using to unexpected results.<br>Agent Hardric is infamous for accidentally preventing themselves from being born in one universe.<br>They are considered normal for the PPC.</i><br><br>Hahaha, no. I&#39;m not going near Bad Slash if I can avoid it, even with a pretty long pole. Once again, blank with the fandoms, although I&#39;ll have to give Young Wizards a try someday. Knife and shovel? Why not. Normal PPCer, I can see that, and, well, I think I could be light-headed enough to provoke this...</p>

            <p>and brushed off his clean, unobtrusive business suit with the kind of conventionality that would have fit right in with the apron-equipped housewife of a 1950s American suburban household. <br>While John Clamp, the protagonist of his favourite fandom, CLAMP, had spent the last fourteen pages of badfic brutalising passing puppies, winking at nearby schoolgirls, and generally acting nothing like his (ever famous) canon self, Larfen knew better than to overreact, or add some kind of rude, critical commentary to the situation. <br>No. Larfen always said: &#39;A negative attitude leads to a negative mission!&#39; amongst &#39;Practice makes perfect!&#39; and &#39;Slow and steady wins the race!&#39; and other statements he was sure were very meaningful and intelligent, and made his higher-ups think he was a very meaningful and intelligent person. He was a professional, who knew all the ins and outs of being a proper PPC agent. He had won employee of the week over four times, so far, and couldn&#39;t even count how many times he had been called a &#39;star player&#39;. He spent all his free time by the local water cooler, chatting about things like the weather, the game, cars, mortgages, accounting, and other such burning topics. <br><br>It had been three weeks since he had entered the fic, and Larfen had finally decided his charge list was of suitable length. He spent more time collecting it into his bag, added the classic &#39;<i>Angering agents!</i>&#39; to the end of it with a flourish of his pen and a quaint chuckle and, five weeks and three days into his mission, he made for the kill. <br>&#39;John Clamp, or replacement thereof,&#39; <br>John Clamp or replacement thereof spun around like a dog caught in the middle of browsing through inappropriate websites, urple hair swishing and whooshing through the air. <br>&#39;What?&#39; <br>&#39;You are hereby charged for, section one: Character Disruptions, division oh point one: causing canon characters to be, subsection one: token lecherous jerks, subsection two: token homophobic jerks, subsection three: and/or woobies when they otherwise...&#39; <br>An hour rolled by. <br>&#39;Division four point five, subsection four: having a speshul name, subsection four point fifty eight: having an improbable appearance, subsection five: creating...&#39; <br>The earth rotated. Plants grew. People were born. Some people died. The ones in between were, respectively, very happy and very sad. The sun went down. The sun went up. <br>&#39;Section kli-alpha: subsection fifty: trivialisation of triple homocide, subsection nine and a half: misuse of the colour blue, particularly within the context of...&#39; <br>Needless to say, it was very easy to assassinate a replacement when they had lapsed into bored unconsciousness. <br><br>&#39;It&#39;s as I always say: a positive attitude makes for a positive mission.&#39; Larfen chuckled aristocratically at his clever wordplay. The mission had gone splendidly, as they always did. The CLAMP continuum was safer than a block of wood in a complex mechanism designed to keep it still when being worked on. <br>&#39;So, how&#39;s the wife?&#39; He asked, winking a wink that was drenched in mischievous camaraderie (Larfen was never above the famous &#39;whacky hijinks&#39; of his fellow agents.)<br>Larfen never found out how the wife was, of course. Everybody who hadn&#39;t gone the John Clamp replacement route and dropped into sleep on the spot had gone out in search of more interesting entertainment. The local wet paint and growing grass had never received such enraptured attention. <br>Larfen was more than happy with this - it was not interrelational connection that drove his existence, rather, the joy of a job well done and the dangling carrot that was the possibility of promotion. <br>And a job well done it had been. And a carrot well dangled it was. </p>

            <p>The mission itself might have done with some line breaks, especially when the &quot;camera&quot; jumps from agent to agent. Aside from that, the mission was readable, and the agent interactions went well; you played Zeb, Rina, and Alex off each other quite well. <br><br>Were you in a hurry to post this mission? I do not believe that 11:00 PM is a usual time for you.

The correct spelling is &quot;Sweetie Bell<b>e</b>&quot;.<br><br>5) <i>Our C-CADs liked blowing up so much we kind of stopped carrying them,</i><br>Missing comma. Put a comma after &quot;blowing up so much&quot;.<br><br>6) <i>If I wanted to get eaten by Victreebel I would’ve stayed at home!</i><br>Another missing comma: put it after &quot;Victreebel&quot;.<br><br>7) <i>Peregrin was speculating about what the large-scale geometry of HQ.</i><br>As is, this is a sentence fragment. Delete the &quot;what,&quot; or add the rest of the sentence.<br><br>8) <i>There was an earsplitting crack, and the Sue’s body exploded, overwhelmed from all the power it had absorbed.</i><br>Don&#39;t you mean &quot;Stu&#39;s body&quot;?<br><br>And one more thing, this time just curiosity on my part:<br><br><i>Zeb’s teeth were chattering. “Fire.

            <p>I agree so far with everything that has been said. There is a TOS feel to it, but you didn&#39;t give the characters time to develop as characters instead of mouthpieces. Also, if Jack was working for the PPC (since I&#39;m assuming that Jack is the vertan and Shawn is a newbie), how does he have a 9-to-5 job? Unless I&#39;m mistaken, the PPC isn&#39;t known for keeping regular hours...<br><br>There are plenty of errors that I&#39;ve caught:<br><li>
<em>“Spore huh? I loved that game. I blew up an entire galaxy,” Shawn said.</em><br> Put a comma after “Spore”.</li>
<br><li>
<em>“You wanna take out a ‘Sue? We need more than just a CAD.” Shawn said, pulling a glock out of his luggage.<br> </em>Capitalize “glock”; it’s a brand name.</li>
<br><li>
<em>“Yeah, we can do that too,” Shawn said, picking up his backpack and a CAD.<br> </em>Comma before “too”.</li>
<br><li>
<em>“You didn’t think to use that when you were face down in an alley though?” Shawn asked.<br> </em>Comma before “though”.</li>
<br><li>
<em>“Maybe the ships wouldn’t have gotten there in time?” Jack offered, “Then again, maybe the author is just inconsistent.”<br> </em>The comma after “Jack offered” should be a period.</li>
<br><li>
<em>Jack took the box for Spore out of his backpack and pressed it against the ‘Sue’s head, “Avaunt! In the name of Will Wright, leave this… character,” The goddess emerged from the ‘Sue.<br> </em>The comma after “head” should be a period. The comma after “character” should be a period. And also, since you should have a new paragraph when the main actor changes, that last sentence should be in a new paragraph.</li>
<br><li>
<em>“Almost. Now we have to perform the <strong>rights</strong> that will stop them from returning. Ahem,” Jack said,</em><br> Homophone error: <strong>rites</strong>. Also, that comma at the end should be a period.</li>
<br><li>
<em>“Kirk! My love!” She shouted before a shot went into her neck.<br> </em>Lowercase “s” in “she shouted”; you’re continuing the sentence.</li>
<br><li>
<em>“I’m sure that’s it,” Jack said, “Now come on, time for phase two,”<br> </em>The comma after “Jack said” and the comma at the very end should both be periods.</li>

            <p>First off, sorry this took literal days to reply on. Darned Board pushing things further down the front page. I don&#39;t really have an answer for the SPaG stuff except to fix it and make sure I don&#39;t make that mistake in the future, but I can explain the point about Jack having a 9-5 job. Jack used to work in Internal Affairs, and what I&#39;ve seen of that Department led me to believe that it did function more like a regular office than the PPC usually does.</p>

            <p>I honestly share the sentiments most others had - it was very reminiscent of TOS, what with similar sort of character dynamics and dialogue and whatnot. <br>Which was great, by the way. Loved that dialogue. They&#39;re snarky as hell, but clearly mates. Something about it all feels so classic, y&#39;know? <br>Perhaps it&#39;s just because of the aforementioned TOS similarities, but there&#39;s a type of chemistry with the two characters that I&#39;ve seen before, and that I haven&#39;t seen in a bit, and it&#39;s nice to have that sort&#39;ve thing popping up again. <br><br>And: good on you for finishing this!

            <p>I intended to say mostly what Nesh said, but didn’t get to write it down yet.<br><br>Specific errors I took notes of:<br><br><i>Inside was a small, cluttered, room with a hammock strung up in the corner ...</i><br>&quot;cluttered&quot; is part of a list, not an insertion that needs a comma at the end; &quot;a small, cluttered room&quot; would be correct.<br><br><i>The ‘Sue was, in fact doing something.</i><br>&quot;in fact&quot;, on the other hand, is an insertion. &quot;The ‘Sue was, in fact, doing something&quot; is how this should read.

            <p>On mobile, so I can&#39;t comment in too much depth, but I thought somebody ought to break the ice and give you some feedback.<br><br>So, good points: at times, especially early in the story, it reminded me of TOS. I think the agents are funny, and I like that they approach the mission with positive, upbeat energy.<br><br>Points that need work: there are a number of punctuation errors left, and the dialogue got a little dull at times with a lot of Shawn said, Jack said, Shawn said, Jack said. You don&#39;t always need a speech tag. Even with them, I&#39;m having a little trouble telling which one is which, but that might be my own failing.<br><br>I raised my eyebrows at a couple things: 1. Both agents leaving the mission to get disguises. Unless I&#39;ve missed something, it&#39;s always been the case that at least one agent had to remain in-fic til mission&#39;s end. 2. The exorcism at the end. Lampshading that it was unusual doesn&#39;t fix the fact that it was indeed unusual. I would have liked an actual explanation or for things to have been handled differently (treating the goddess as a mere voice in the Sue&#39;s head comes to mind as an option).<br><br>Otherwise, though, pretty good mission with plenty of entertaining bits and characters I wouldn&#39;t mind getting to know better.

            <p>I need to look back over for those punctuation errors, because I thought I got all of them, but that should be a simple fix. As for the exorcism, yeah, saying the &#39;Sue was actually crazy and just hearing voices probably would have been a less complicated way to do things that I really wish I had thought of.<br><br>With the &quot;trouble telling which one is which&quot; thing, you&#39;re right, and I definitely need to work on that.

<p>'Oh, you shouldn't do that, you know,' Bingle advised, emptying the salt. 'And, absolutely. We like company, don't we, Finch?' </p>

            <p>He tried to reassure Finch "I'm not insane. Or at least I think I'm not. You can never be entirely sure about such things. I don't <em>remember</em> having the Book thrown at me..."
He trailed off into thought, and then realized he wasn't sure who he was talking to. So he said "I'm Agent Peregrin, and my partner over there is Tomash. We are members of the Ord­— Department of Mary Sues. Who are you? I don't believe we have met."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tomash was talking with Bingle. "Well, the trees themselves were pretty ordinary trees, maybe a bit on the gloomy side. I mean, kids' show, so you can't have anything <em>too</em> scary. But the Stu was sort-of controlling them, and he apparently didn't want to be exorcised, so the trees sort of started leaning in on us and trying to thwack us with their branches. Peregrin was busy putting on a really showy exorcism —"</p>

<p>Peregrin cut in."— My exorcism technique was not needlessly 'showy'. Such occasions call for a certain formality." </p>

<p>"But you don't need a whole long chant. You just wave a bell around and yell stuff about Faust. That's what everyone else did, anyway."</p>

<p>"I still hold that banishments require a certain <em>weight</em>."</p>

<p>"Yeah, so anyway. Peregrin was doing his thing, and there was a tree getting pretty close, so I had to put the bell down and hit the thing a few times. Then I think it realized that attacking agents wasn't a good idea."</p>

<p>"Dude. Pregrin. Relax!"  Tomash said reassuringly. "They're with <em>Building Maintenance</em>,  not DIA or some sort of inquisition."</p>

<p>Peregrin was somewhat reassured, and the mention of inquisitions led him to reminiscing. "If they were with something like the Inquisition there would be no reason to worry. All Inquisitors ever did was look in about once a decade to make sure we hadn't build a nuclear reactor in the kitchens. Now Suur Thelenoses, her you had to worry about. She was Warden back when I was much younger and less rule-abiding. And she could spot just about <em>anything</em>. I remember when..."</p>

<p>While Peregrin was taking a trip down memory lane, Tomash told Bingle "Yeah. I don't know what happened with the forest, exactly. Apparently, the guy died and 'merged'  with it. I mean, I can sort of see stories where that would work, but that fic wasn't one of them. And i'll try not to ruin the hallways."</p>

<p>Peregrin overheard this and commented. "Yes. It's best to be careful with the hallways. Especially since all of the likely notions of 'near' for the corridors are extremely hard to work with, I've found."</p>

The Librarian just shook his head. "Madness, I say. Madness."<br>
Des sighed and got up. "Tell you what - I'll get you some Cointreau and a bite to eat, aright? You look like you need it."<br>
The Librarian mumbled something, and Des made his way toward the bar proper.</p>

            <p>A moment ago, he had been ready to ask Randa's help in describing their home.  He glanced at Vania, but she was staring into the distance and fiddling with something under the table.</p>

<p>He turned back to Shamrock and cleared his throat.  "Um.  U.S. is short for the United States, which is the country I lived in.  It started out as separate colonies owned by another country, but the colonies worked together to become their own country.  That's why it has a weird plural name."</p>

<p>Doc watched Shamrock's face to see if she seemed bored, but dove in to her next question.  "And Australia is a huge island where the animals evolved to be really different from the rest of the planet's.  The mammals there carry their babies in pouches of skin on the outside of their body, and two of them even lay eggs.  And a lot of the snakes and spiders there have very powerful venom, so it does have a reputation for being dangerous, by Earth standards.  But we still don't have any actual monsters, like your world does.  So, like I said, pretty mundane."</p>

<p>He paused.  "Although now that I think about it, I don't know what causes those fire tornadoes.  Hm."  He furrowed his brow and took a drink.</p>

            <p>Shamrock pulled a chain out from under her shirt and held out the phial on the end. "This is my emergency supply," she said. "Dust comes in both crystal and ground forms; it's what allowed humans and Faunus to first fight back against the Grimm when we were nearly driven to extinction. People harness Dust's powers to channel elemental effects, like fire or ice."</p>

<p>Randa returned with a bowl of walnuts for Shamrock and a sandwich for herself. Shamrock began stuffing the food in her mouth, pausing when she realized Randa was giving her a meaningful look. "What?" Shamrock said around her bulging cheeks.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Randa said, turning her attention to her sandwich.</p>

<p>Shamrock chewed, swallowed, then said, "So tell me more about these egg-laying mammals!"</p>

            <p>"There are two mammals on World One that still lay eggs like birds, and they both live in Australia.  One is the echidna, which basically looks like a hedgehog—um, four legs, skinny snout, covered in spines, burrows underground and eats bugs.  And the platypus is a weird animal, because it's furry, but it lives in rivers, so it has webbed feet and a duck beak and a flat tail for swimming.  Oh, and male platypi have a chunk of bone sticking out of their back ankles that can poison predators they kick, and they're the only venomous mammal.  In my world, anyway."</p>

<p>Vania was holding her arms out towards Doc while looking at her new tablemates.  "This.  He pulls this crap every mission.  Something happens in the badfic, and he's all like, 'That's wrong, because blah blah blah fourteenth-century Scottish castle construction blah blah.'  It's—" She huffed and put her head in her hands.  "is that, is this, just a thing?  That partners do?  Do you two do this at each other?  I mean, <i>I</i> never get a turn.  Ugh."</p>

<p>Doc shrugged.  "I read.  Things."  He sipped more of his drink.  "Castles were mostly being phased out for tower houses in Scotland by the fourteenth century, though."</p>

<p>"Augh!"</p>

<p>((Turns out, three of the four echidna species are critically endangered right now, and I have a sad.  :( ))</p>

<p>((Also, arbitrary assumption that Shamrock would know what a duck beak looks like, but not a beaver tail, is arbitrary.))</p>

            <p>"Yeah, so you know how Butterbeer has almost no alcohol in it, to the point where eleven-year-olds can drink it in wizarding society?  Well, Doc is apparently such a rampaging teetotaler that he flipped out when he found out he had been drinking stuff meant for preteens."</p>

<p>"Nuuuuuuuuu . . ."  Doc began sinking slowly down in his chair.</p>

<p>"And he freaks so badly, he convinces himself—purely psychological, mind you—that he must be drunk now, because that's how it works, obviously.  And I wake up the next morning to an RC full of plastic flamingos full of glitter, because Doc has been out remote activating under the influence all night."</p>

<p>"Stop ignoring my wishes," Doc whispered, head just barely over the tabletop now.</p>

<p>And he went to Camp Halfblood, of all places—Doc, have you even read any Percy Jackson?"</p>

<p>"Not as of the time of this writing," came the answer from beneath the table.</p>

<p>Vania grimaced at the weird answer and continued.  "And then went to a Sue town—which we're at peace with, so thank goodness he didn't start some kind of incident."</p>

<p>"You're killing me, Vania, I'm dying now."</p>

<p>"And then he ends up back on World One, in the middle of some beach in winter, and nearly gives his fool of a self frostbite."</p>

<p>"Vania, why is your shirt full of—"  Then, he made a sound akin to footwear hitting a jawline.</p>

<p>"So Rina and I track him down, through all this, and freeze <i>our</i> butts off getting him to Medical so he doesn't die.  <i>And</i>, we had to run damage control and neuralyze a bunch of people who saw our portal.  You'd best believe the Hyacinth had some words to say about that."</p>

<p>"That was only part of the reason for our punishment," mumbled Doc from the floor.</p>

            <p>Printworthy smiled over his glass of wine, patiently waiting for his partner to get the excitement out of his system. If he were truly honest with himself he was rather flustered as well. It was quite the harrowing experience. They have both had faced against many dastardly villains in the past, glitter-dos of such power, they could rival Tirek in raw strength. But for one to wield the powers of the Everfree Forest itself? He knew he had vanquished far more challenging foes, but this one...</p>

<p>"Then, <i>wham!</i> I don't think I've seen somebody, just, freaking, get launched that far! I mean, hope they're OK and all, but by Celestia was it funny."</p>

<p>The unicorn took a gentle sip. He decided the next drink was going to be some manner of bleep-cohol. He was used to the mystic chaos of the Everfree by now, of course. He's had to plunge into it's depths many times before. He had even grown accustomed to its unique flora and fauna. Learned to think of it as yet another forest. Yet, this particular glitter-do brought back all his childish fears again. The writhing vines, rushing forth to ensnare him, rend the flesh from his bones, and consume his soul. It was... Disturbing, to say the least.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness I brought my spear. Would have been up all kinds of creeks without it!"</p>

<p>Printworthy signaled for another round. He had managed to maintain his composure in the middle of the crisis, even as childish fears and traditional wisdom beat against his training. At least, he believed so. Perhaps the traces of bleeprin wafting through the air was beginning to affect his memory. Even still, as he sat, listening to Marvin spin his tales of grandeur, he began planning a visit to Fictional Psychology. Just a therapy visit, somebody to talk to and be sure everything was all right. He could not risk suffering a mental breakdown the next time he was required to venture into that cursed wood again.</p>

<p>"You know, it just hit me. Wasn't this set in, like, season one? So, then, how come there were so many plants from that attack in <i>Twilight's Kingdom?</i> You know, the ones that the Tree of Harmony was suppressing. I don't know, maybe canon was trying to salvage something from this mess. Or, maybe I'm just seeing things. I dunno."</p>

<p>Printworthy took his new glass, passing two bits over to the humble bartender. He took a deep sip of the bitter drink, relishing the dampening of memory. He was not one to abuse bleeprin, unlike most of his peers, but even he had to admit, the feeling of relief from mental anguish that washed over his brain was quite welcome. Besides, he had no reports to write this afternoon, Celestia willing. He could afford a little irresponsibly.</p>

<p>"Hey, you alright man? You're a bit quieter than usual."</p>

<p>The unicorn shook his head. "My apologies. I was in a rather contemplative mood this afternoon. Must be the wine working its wonders."</p>

<p>Marvin shrugged, taking a swig of his cider. "No worries. Just checking in, is all." At this, his eyes wend wide. His hands flew down to his pouches, feeling around theor contents. "Did you grab the DVDs? I don't have em."</p>

<p>Printworthy searched his saddlebags. "Blast. It appears not."</p>

<p>Marvin groaned. "Ugh. Now we have to get replacements. I just hope the cleanup crew found them first. Else, somepony is gonna have an existential crisis on their hooves." He took a big gulp of his cider. "Still. 'Least we purged the monster. That's nice."</p>

<p>Printworthy smiled, raising his glass. "Indeed. Cheers to that." </p>

<p>Marvin looked around the crowded pub. He saw old friends, new acquaintances, and many unfamiliar agents. Something stored inside him. In a flash of inspiration, and alcohol enhanced confidence, he stood, ponding on the table. "A toast!" he cried, swinging his mug. "To dead Sues and Stus. May they fall quickly, and sparkly!"</p>

<p>Printworthy shook his head, but raised his glass high. "Cheers!" As his partner sat back down, he decided to assess the crowd himself. "Well, now that you demanded everyone's attention, perhaps we should socialize. Join with others in the festivities."</p>

<p>Marvin nodded, as he chugged his drink. "Yeah, sure," he said, wiping off cider from his chin. "Right after I finish this drink."</p>

            <p>Before Marvin could finish his cider, a young man with rainbow-colored hair and a light blue pilot's jacket joined the two of them. His magenta eyes twinkled with delight, his pointed teeth (pointed teeth?!) bared in an excited grin.</p>

<p>"Could it be? Could it really be <i>THE</i> Marvin and Printworthy?! It is! OmigoshomigoshomigoshomigoshomigoshOMIGOSH! Hiiiii, nice to seeya! Rayner Blitzkreig, DMS, it's an honor!"</p>

<p>"Is it, really?" A tall, dark-haired young woman, bound in chains of light with a large book chained to her ankle, had also joined them. The strangest thing about her wasn't the horns on her shoulders, or the leather wings on her back, or her reptilian tail. No, it was the fact that her severed head was currently balanced, upside-down, on top of the stump of her neck.</p>

<p>"What's so significant about these two, really?" asked E.V.L. "They're just <i>agents</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Just</i> agents? The All-Purpose Department, <i>My Little Pony</i> Division? They buckin' <i>founded</i> that division!" He turned back to the two of them. "Sorry 'bout that, guys. My partner's as rude as Tartarus, and I can't really change that no matter how hard I try."</p>

<p>"What, no mention of all those trips to FicPsych?" E.V.L. smirked.</p>

<p>"Those. Don't. Count. Anyway... Can we sit here? We were hopin' to talk to you two. Assuming you can put up with my nasty excuse of a partner, that is!"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut it, <i>Pony Boy.</i>"</p>

            <p>"Erm. Well. Uh, thanks?" Marvin coughed, looking to Printworthy. "Sorry. Cider. Throat. You?"</p>

<p>Printworthy smiled, extending a hoof to the rather unexpected fan. Although, he was somewhat used to it, from his past life. "Well, it is a pleasure to meet you too. Please, sit down." He took a look over his new guests. They were rather unique individuals. Almost certainly from Mary Sues. Even now, outside of combat, the rainbow haired one held a slight defensive stance. "I must admit, I am honored and humbled by your appreciation of our work. However, your partner is right. Here, we are all agents."</p>

<p>Marvin managed to stop choking somewhere in the middle of Printworthy's little speech. "So, fellas. Where you from? Home World's, I mean. I'm from World One, and you get one guess about old Prints over here." He glanced at the female, and snickered. "Hold on, let me guess. Hot Topic?" He clamped his hand over his mouth. "Sorry."</p>

<p>((I'm a little swamped right now, with work and woodcutting. However, when things calm down a little on my end, I may be interested, yeah.  Fair warning: I take a long time to write.

            <p>So, I&#39;m planning on dipping my toes back into the whole mission writing thing (surprise, surprise, RL took up most of my time the last two years, but I&#39;m finally done with my second degree!). I found a suitably bad romance!fic in the <i>Star Wars</i> continuum to mission, but I&#39;ve got a bit of a logistical problem:<br><br>Darth Vader has been replaced by, of all things, a creeper!vampire!Anakin who has no need of the suit (because there was a random vampire on <i>Mustafar</i> of all places that turned him before Obi-wan got slice-happy with his &#39;saber), which means canon!Vader will need to be neuralyzed. However, this is set roughly around <i>A New Hope</i> as far as I can tell, which means canon!Vader will have his suit, and thus filters on his eyes (I&#39;m assuming the lenses on his mask work as polarizing filters, much like sunglasses, but IDK). Also, I&#39;m not sure if Force abilities would work on him either. <br><br>Any suggestions would be great, especially if they&#39;re canon-appropriate. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Probably anything that affects a canon character should affect a non-canon character as according to the the universal laws that govern the fictional universe they&#39;re in.  So, logically The Force should affect creeper!vampire!Anakin. <br><br>I hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Would be his meditation chamber. As far as I can recall (been a while since I&#39;ve watched the trilogy, really need to fix that.) he&#39;s without the mask portion of his helmet while inside, so if you could somehow get him out of the plothole and in to the chamber you might have a shot.<br><br>You&#39;d have a devil of a time sneaking up on a Sith Lord, particularly while he&#39;s meditating, but if it&#39;s a Legends fic you could snag an Ysalimir off Myrkr. If not... Well, I&#39;m sure your agents will think of something.<br><br>Another problem would be getting to Vader while he&#39;s in the chamber, but you might be able to solve that with an imperial officer disguise.<br><br>If all else fails, he can (depending on circumstances and canon) survive without the helmet for short periods of time. However, as the helmet is actual armor, about the only way to get it off that I can see would be open combat, so... Probably not a good idea. Sith Lords are rather renowned for their efficiency in killing people, and Vader is deadly even by Sith standards.</p>

            <p>Given that the biggest plot hole in the fic is the fact that he wasn&#39;t, y&#39;know, turned into Roasty-Toasty Vader on Mustafar, I might be able to take care of things then and not have to worry about the suit at all.

            <p>I can probably conjure something up from the latter (if nothing else, dropping him into an ysalamiri field should let you get the drop on him), but don&#39;t really know enough from the former.<br><br>Though it feels like that might be leaning too heavily on the idea of having more tech/resources than him. The PPC is about doing more with <i>less</i>. How about not wiping his memories at all, but tricking him into thinking they make sense? You could pull him out of the plothole before he falls in and play a game of &#39;keep real Vader distracted and away from fake Vader until you can get rid of fake Vader&#39;, that could be fun. Or convince him that the plothole is a Rebel scheme of some description to imprison him. How well do plotholes stand up to lightsabers? I can&#39;t imagine he&#39;d sit quietly, and if he can break out by himself, you&#39;re in a situation where he does the convincing part himself, and you <i>still</i> have to trick him away from the mission...<br><br>Sorry, I got a bit derailed there, but I think the whole &#39;agents running interference for the badfic (so they can stick around long enough to kill it properly)&#39; idea has something going for it. If you want it, take it; if you don&#39;t, let me know and I&#39;ll probably try it myself sometime.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Apparently new piece of writing on our favourite American Wizarding Regime has been released on <i>Pottermore</i><br><br>(Disclaimer: Any material <i>Potter</i>-related is owned by J. K. Rowling, blah, blah, blah, support the official release)<br><br><br><br><b>The Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA)</b><br><br><u>Origins</u><br><br>The Magical Congress of the United States of America, known to American witches and wizards by the abbreviation MACUSA (commonly pronounced as: Mah – cooz – ah) was created in 1693, following the introduction of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy. Wizards worldwide had reached a tipping point, suspecting that they could lead freer and happier lives if they built an underground community that offered its own support and had its own structures. This feeling was particularly strong in America, due to the recent Salem Witch Trials.<br><br>MACUSA was modeled on the Wizards’ Council of Great Britain, which predated the Ministry of Magic. Representatives from magical communities all over North America were elected to MACUSA to create laws that both policed and protected American wizardkind.<br><br>MACUSA’s primary aim was to rid the continent of Scourers, corrupt wizards who had hunted their fellow magical beings for personal gain. MACUSA’s second great law enforcement challenge was the number of wizarding criminals who had fled to America from Europe and beyond, precisely because of the lack of organised law enforcement such as existed in their own countries.<br><br>The first President of MACUSA was Josiah Jackson, a warlike wizard who was voted into post by his fellow representatives because he was considered tough enough to deal with the difficulties of the post-Salem Witch Trials era.<br><br>In these first years, MACUSA had no fixed meeting place. Meetings were held in different locations to avoid No-Maj detection.<br><br><u>Law Enforcement</u><br><br>President Jackson’s immediate priority was to recruit and train Aurors. The names of the first dozen volunteers to train as Aurors in the US have a special place in United States’ wizarding history. There were so few of them, and the challenges they faced so great, that they knew they might be required to lay down their lives when they took the job. The descendants of these witches and wizards have been given particular respect in the US ever since. The original twelve were:<br><br>Wilhelm Fischer<br>Theodard Fontaine<br>Gondulphus Graves<br>Robert Grimsditch<br>Mary Jauncey<br>Carlos Lopez<br>Mungo MacDuff<br>Cormac O’Brien<br>Abraham Potter<br>Berthilde Roche<br>Helmut Weiss<br>Charity Wilkinson<br><br>Of these twelve, only two survived into old age: Charity Wilkinson, who would become MACUSA’s third President, and Theodard Fontaine, whose direct descendant, Agilbert, is the present day Headmaster of Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Also of note are Gondulphus Graves, whose family remains influential in American wizarding politics, and Abraham Potter, whose distant relationship to the famous Harry Potter would be uncovered by eager genealogists centuries later.<br><br><u>Challenges</u><br><br>America remained one of the most hostile environments for magical people, mainly because of Scourer descendants who had vanished permanently into the No-Maj community and who kept suspicion of magic alive. Unlike most Western countries, there was no cooperation between the No-Maj government and MACUSA.<br><br>Initially, an enchanted edifice was created in the Appalachian Mountains as MACUSA headquarters, but over time this became an inconveniently remote location, especially as wizards, like No-Majs, were increasingly congregating in cities.<br><br>In 1760, MACUSA relocated to Williamsburg, Virginia, home of the flamboyant President Thornton Harkaway. Among many other interests, President Harkaway is credited with breeding Crups – dogs that closely resemble Jack Russells, apart from the forked tail. The Crup’s devotion to wizards is only surpassed by its aggression towards non-magical people. Unfortunately, President Harkaway’s pack savaged several local No-Majs, who afterwards were only able to bark for a period of 48 hours. This breach of the Statute of Secrecy led to Harkaway leaving office in disgrace. (It might not be coincidence that Williamsburg was the first city in the US to have a dedicated psychiatric hospital. Sightings of odd happenings around President Harkaway’s residence might account for the admission of No-Majs who were, in fact, perfectly sane.)<br><br>MACUSA relocated to Baltimore, where President Able Fleming had his home, but the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, followed by the arrival of the No-Maj Congress in the city, made MACUSA understandably nervous and they departed for Washington.<br><br>It was in Washington that President Elizabeth McGilliguddy presided over the infamous ‘Country or Kind?’ debate of 1777. Thousands of witches and wizards from all over America descended upon MACUSA to attend this extraordinary meeting, for which the Great Meeting Chamber had to be magically enlarged. The issue for discussion was: did the magical community owe their highest allegiance to the country in which they had made their homes, or to the global underground wizarding community? Were they morally obliged to join American No-Majs in their fight for liberation from the British Muggles? Or was this, simply put, not their fight?<br><br>The arguments for and against intervention were protracted and the fight became vicious. Pro-interventionists argued that they might be able to save lives; anti-interventionists that wizards risked their own security by revealing themselves in battle. Messengers were sent to the Ministry of Magic in London to ask whether they intended to fight. A four-word message returned: ‘Sitting this one out.’ McGilliguddy’s famous response was even shorter: ‘Mind you do.’ While officially the American witches and wizards did not engage in battle, unofficially there were many instances of intervention to protect No-Maj neighbours and the wizarding community celebrated Independence Day along with the rest of American society – although not necessarily alongside them.<br><br>One of the most significant American magical laws was created in 1790, when MACUSA approved an edict to enforce total segregation of the wizarding and No-Maj communities. Rappaport’s Law, named after then-President Emily Rappaport, was created as a result of one of the worst breaches of the International Statute of Secrecy ever known, a breach in which the daughter of Rappaport’s Keeper of Treasure and Dragots and a Scourer descendant almost exposed the existence of magic worldwide. With the passing of Rappaport’s Law, intermarriage and even friendship between wizards and No-Majs became illegal in the United States.<br><br>MACUSA’s base remained in Washington until 1892, when an unforeseen uprising of the Sasquatch population caused another security breach. Historians place the blame for the rebellion on Irene Kneedander, Head of the Body for Protection of Magical Species (Humanoid), whose interpretation of her job title had involved attacking any Sasquatch that ‘stepped out of line.’ The arrival in Washington of the Sasquatch necessitated mass Obliviations and extensive repairs to headquarters.<br><br>MACUSA needed a new refuge, and over the course of several years, wizards infiltrated the construction team of a new building in New York. By the time the Woolworth Building was completed it could both house No-Majs and – if activated by the correct spells – transform into a space for wizards. The only outer mark of the MACUSA’s new secret location was the owl carved over the entrance.<br><br><u>MACUSA in the 1920s</u><br><br>As with most other magical governing bodies, the Department of Magical Law Enforcement is the largest department in MACUSA.<br><br>Rappaport’s Law was still in operation in the 1920s and several offices in MACUSA had no counterpart in the Ministry of Magic; for example, a sub-division dealing with No-Maj Fraternisation and an office issuing and verifying wand permits, which everyone, citizen and visitor, was supposed to carry within the States.<br><br>A significant difference between the wizarding governments of the United States and the UK of this time was the penalty for serious crime. Whereas British witches and wizards were sent to Azkaban, the worst criminals in America were executed.<br><br>In the 1920s the President of MACUSA was Seraphina Picquery from Savannah. The Department of Magical Law Enforcement was headed by Percival Graves, a well-respected descendant of one of the original twelve American Aurors.<br><br></p>

            <p>Well, that looks like a description of a fairly malicious organisation. So naturally, since I&#39;ve been calling them corrupt and evil from the very beginning, it&#39;s time for me to do a complete 180.<br><br><u>MACUSA - A Sympathetic View</u><br><br>From the very beginning, MACUSA was hounded on all sides. Its name encapsulates its founding ideal - a congress of magical peoples and creatures, united across the states of the Americas. The International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy had led the North American wizards to the belief that they could join together in a glorious magical equality, untroubled by the affairs of non-magical people. Together, they pioneered the concept of <b>representative democracy</b>, which would become so fundamental to North American identity.<br><br>Then came Salem. Then came the influx of magical criminals, and the onslaught of the Scourers, wicked wizards who hunted their own kind. The golden optimism of MACUSA had to be bent towards their own protection, because no-one - certainly not the European wizards who disdained any contact with the Americans - would do it for them.<br><br>President Jackson was faced with an unenviable task, one many said was impossible. He dedicated his life to the task - first to the training of the First Dozen, and then to the gruelling secret war against the murderous Scourers. He paid with a lifetime of service; ten of the Dozen paid with their lives.<br><br>There was no security for the magical peoples of the Americas. Their traditional alliances with the magical creatures fell by the wayside - the various Bodies for the Protection of Magical Species could do little to prevent the attrition of their charges by non-magical colonials, and the magical creatures fled further into the wilds. Through no fault of its own, MACUSA became a human organisation - and one under constant threat. President Harkaway&#39;s breeding of Crups as watchdogs for the magical community, while misguided, certainly speaks to the harsh times he lived in.<br><br>MACUSA&#39;s headquarters strove to follow the migrations of its charges - from the mountains to Williamsburg, Baltimore, and Washington, as the wizards of North America gathered in the cities. They sought constantly to forge alliances and friendships with the distant European wizards, but Europe paid no heed to their cries for aid. When war threatened to tear North America asunder, Britain made its utter disinterest in their welfare clear. America&#39;s wizards rejected the unfeeling advice of their colonial masters, choosing to set aside the stricter readings of the Statute of Secrecy and fight to protect their countryfolk. For a decade, the possibility of cooperation between wizard and No-Maj was broached with increasing optimism in MACUSA.<br><br>Then came the Twelvetrees Incident, and the shocking reminder that the Scourers were still an active and malevolent force in the newly-formed United States. In 1790, the Rap came down - the all-encompassing law which forbade any contact between wizard and No-Maj. For a magical community which had founded itself on cooperation and openness, this was the final crushing blow. First the departure of the magical creatures, then the rejection from Europe, and now the collapse of any possible coexitence with non-magical America; all of the New World&#39;s wizards and witches wept that day, and none harder than Emily Rappaport.<br><br>Little changed over the next 130 years, and the continued decline of MACUSA&#39;s relations with anyone around them lent a grim aspect to their new headquarters in New York. The loss of the Native American contingent during the purges by No-Maj President Jackson (no relation) brought despair, and the Sasquatch efforts to bring down MACUSA in response to a single official&#39;s misplaced zeal was referred to by the president of the time as &#39;just another miserable Thursday&#39;.<br><br>If MACUSA became hardened, with its wand permits, its death penalties (which were nevertheless more lenient than the tortures British wizardry inflicted on their prisoners in Azkaban), and its distrust of outsiders, it was only through the long, crushing experience of being - as one prominent member of the Picquery government put it, &#39;history&#39;s whipping-post&#39;.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>The great thing about fictional history is that you can absolutely read it both ways. The world I&#39;ve just described is identical to both Rowling&#39;s descriptions, <i>and</i> to my southern-American complaints about The Rap. It&#39;s all entirely about your point of view.<br><br>President Pickles is still evil, though.<br><br>hS</p>

Both take place in an established universe, but explore entirely new regions of that universe (Doc Strange being the first proper magic in the MCU). I thought it could be really interesting... but yeah, I didn&#39;t have anything to say about that one, either.<br><br>hS</p>

Move the apostrophe.<br><br>Either way, those were some good fics. You&#39;ve already heard the kudos about having the timeskips affect the baby, but I now have a few questions.<br><br>This first question, I&#39;ll leave open for the community at large: As a general writing matter, what actually constitutes a chargeable timeskip? Every piece of literature has to skip over periods of time; no book goes over every second of every day of its characters&#39; lives. <br><br>This second question is to Iximaz in particular: How exactly have the timeskips affected the baby (or is that spoilers)? Unless I am mistaken, in this mission alone, there were timeskips spanning years. However, the Aviator (presumably) gave birth to a newborn, not a little child, albeit a few months earlier than expected.<br><br>And if you don&#39;t mind me asking, what job are you starting? I thought you were in school.</p>

            <p>When I say timeskip, I mean very sudden ones, where they might appear in the middle of a paragraph. In the mission I just did, the author would have sudden jumps in the middle of a paragraph, like <b>The next morning, she rode quickly. The journey took her longer than she expected and she arrived in Kuasta a month before she was due.</b> Suddenly going from &#39;the next morning&#39; to &#39;nine months later&#39; in the same paragraph irks me greatly; I&#39;d say you want a new paragraph, at least, for minor skips and show a more definite break in the narration for larger skips. YMMV, though, and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a boatload of differing opinion on this.<br><br>As for the baby, the stress of the timeskips on the Aviator&#39;s body caused her to deliver prematurely, though that&#39;s not going to be the only consequence. It&#39;ll be a few years before I can really show it, but since it&#39;ll be caught early on I don&#39;t see why I should keep it secret. Elanor&#39;s Time Lord ability to sense the flow of time is going to be a bit... messed up. On the plus side, HQ&#39;s wonky time stream won&#39;t give her headaches. On the downside, she&#39;s got about as good a sense of time as your average human.<br><br>Right now I&#39;m not in school; my parents and I decided it would be better for me to withdraw for this semester and take some time off for a breather after what happened recently with the hospital visit. Right now I&#39;m working as a video/photography production assistant (and having an absolute blast!) but it&#39;s part-time, so I got a second job at a department store where I&#39;ll be processing online orders and shipping them out.</p>

            <p>It was really nice to see Randa again, especially because I remember back when she and Rina were just starting out.  Rina really has come a long ways.<br><br>One thing I noticed in the mission - <i>So make that a metric button of charges</i>.  I assume Zeb means &quot;butt ton&quot;, but I&#39;m not sure if this is intentional or a typo.<br><br>Also... the part about Rina throwing away her medication bothered me, because that&#39;s not how it works.  Depression doesn&#39;t just go away because you&#39;re in a better situation, and it can lead to serious issues in the future if you think it does.  I know it&#39;s from Rina&#39;s perspective, and she doesn&#39;t exactly have a history of making the most healthy decisions, but still... it hit me kind of personally, I guess.  As someone who is dependent on that sort of medication, I dislike seeing it presented as a crutch that I could totally overcome if I was happy enough. I know you didn&#39;t mean it personally or anything, I guess it just sort of hit me hard.</p>

            <p>As for Rina throwing out her medicine, presented from her viewpoint, it was a crutch, something to be ashamed of. Throwing them away was supposed to kind of tie in with her going off the deep end later because of her refusal to seek help. <br><br>I have to be on medication for the same reason and didn&#39;t mean to cause any offense.</p>

            <p>Now that we have a Discord channel, who here would be interested in everyone logging into voice chat and doing a dramatic reading together? Possible options being My Immortal, the Eye of Argon, and Thirty Hs.

Anyone else wanna read character voices? There&#39;s Denmark, a random witch, Inuyasha, Korra, Reicheru&#39;s evil dad, her half-sister Yuki... and lots more in later chapters, though there&#39;s no way we&#39;re doing the whole thing in one go.

            <p>I&#39;m not sure if any of you are familiar with the Night Vale Twitter account- you know, the one that spits out such crazy and heartwarming sentiments as &#39;Greet each day with a smile. An ominous smile. A knowing smile. Smile at the day until the sun returns to its horizon, scared and tired.&#39;<br><br>:)<br><br>Anyway, I was on Discord a while ago, and I proposed the idea of having a PPC Twitter account running (Radio Nutmeg? the Multiverse Monitor, perhaps?) with similar sentiments. Probably revolving around Headquarters, you know. <br><br>I originally suggested this as a way of getting people interested in the PPC, but it seems like a fun idea anyway, so...<br><br>Thought?</p>

            <p>But... these are your choices as I see them:<br><br>-A man who manages to get more offensive every time he says or does something. That&#39;s slight hyperbole, but only slight. He&#39;s a man who is outright supported by white supremacists, and who has a long history of truly vile (&lt;&lt;&lt; opinion) racist and sexist comments.<br><br>-A career politician, with all that that entails. From what I can tell, she has been cleared of significant wrongdoing in the &#39;scandals&#39;/&#39;controversies&#39; being attributed to her. (Oh, and according to some supporters of the first candidate, she shouldn&#39;t be president because she has a nagging voice/has wrinkles/her husband cheated on her/other stuff that translates to &#39;she&#39;s female and we don&#39;t like the idea of a woman in power&#39;.)<br><br>-A bunch of third parties who can&#39;t win. Not &#39;it&#39;s unlikely&#39;, but they literally can&#39;t in the current system. Which means that casting a vote for a third party is identical to not voting, as far as the result is concerned. Unless you literally have no preference at all between the two real candidates, you should vote for one of them.<br><br>I realise that last sounds harsh; that&#39;s because it is. In the UK, we just had a referendum where - apparently - enough people chose to protest-vote that they actually swung the outcome. Now we&#39;re leaving the EU, despite the majority of the country <i>not</i> wanting to.<br><br>2016 has been a truly awful year. Please don&#39;t let the US presidential election be the capstone to that.<br><br>If you disagree with my characterisation of either candidate, or of the viability of third parties, I&#39;m interested to learn more.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Something I&#39;ve been wondering for a while. Or, rather, a few somethings, directed at the PPC-at-large:<br>1) Where do you put yourself on the political spectrum?<br>2) Why?<br>3) What does the political situation in your current country of residence look like? Who would you support, and why?<br><br>In the interest of fomenting this discussion, I&#39;ll answer those questions, too.<br>1) I&#39;ve been saying I&#39;m centre-left for a long time, but I think I&#39;ve been moving rightward a little recently, so centre, I guess. It should be noted that in Israeli politics the main left/right divide isn&#39;t economical/social as in most countries; rather, it&#39;s more about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<br>2) On one hand I&#39;m against being an ass to people because they&#39;re not of the right skin-colour/religion/whatever. On the other I&#39;m also against self-flagellation (hello, Meretz), asinine revolutionism for the sake of revolutionism (hello, Merav Michaeli) and identity politics (hello everybody). I&#39;m also growing more disillusioned as to the chances of peace as the time goes by.<br>3) Terrible. The sane people figure they can&#39;t achieve anything in politics so they don&#39;t bother, so all we have pol-wise are crazies (hi, Meretz), crazier crazies (hi, Bennett) and corrupt power-grabbing career pols (hi, Bibi).</p>

            <p>So, general thoughts, which I think take me to a weird mix of socialism and libertarianism.<br><br>There&#39;s two ideas that I think make good starting points, but should not be taken too far because then bad stuff happens. The first is that people should be generally free to do whatever they&#39;d like, as long as they&#39;re not hurting others. The second is that the whole &#39;market&#39; system (people are buying, selling, trading etc. stuff, whether physical or otherwise) is a decent idea.<br><br>But this sort of obvious market libertarianism has a few big problems. One glaring issue, I believe, is that if you put a market over things that are actually necessary for life (food, water, shelter, health care, social interaction, ...), some people will get &#39;priced out of the market&#39;. That is, people could (through no real fault of their own) die because of this system. That is a Bad Thing, so you have to adjust your system to avoid it. One aspect of that is a class of necessary regulations that put a &quot;floor&quot; on the free market. For example, a minimum wage (property implemented, which it isn&#39;t) ensures that the price of labor doesn&#39;t spiral so low that people can&#39;t make a living. Similar arguments apply to things like unemployment, welfare, and so on (they protect you from failure modes of the market). I think a basic income would be an ideal floor, but I&#39;m not convinced we have the technical capability to implement it.<br><br>The second problem is negative externalities, such as pollution. These are things that a person (or, more commonly, a group of people) can do that hurt everyone. So you can try to patch around them by adding the notion of a crime against everyone, and you give the government (which represents everyone) the power to prevent those crimes through regulation. This also justifies antitrust bills, since big monopolies hurt everyone by closing off the market in spheres where it would be better for it to be open.<br><br>tl;dr certain pretty broad classes of regulation are necessary.<br><br>As to the current US political situation: I would have preferred Sanders, but I can&#39;t really object to Clinton. The worst-case for a Clinton presidency is that we stay more or less where we are, the best case is that scoot a bit closer to what I want. Trump is insane.<br><br>And on a specific policy note: first past the post voting is a terrible system. Implement instant runoff today! Elect the candidates everyone&#39;s mostly OK with, while providing information about actual preferences!<br><br>(and my ideal far-future would be something like the Culture. That is, there&#39;s so much of everything that the price of anything important is indistinguishable from 0, and we&#39;ve found technical solutions around basically all negative externalities. Then you can drop the regulations and everything still works.)</p>

            <p>1°) I guess I&#39;d be somewhere on the left. I think entreprises have responsabilities beyond their bottom line and the idea of mondial regulation for finances, and taxes on transactions seem legit for me and that the state has obligations about its citizens. In the same time, I think social aides shouldn&#39;t be a crutch for people to live off the rest of society, unless they cannot reallistically apply for a job.<br><br>Now the situation in France... Oh boy. Precedent rigt president was not liked at all by the end of his term, but actual left president managed to make &#39;better&#39; about this (and give up an eco-tax fairly important because a few... protesters with red caps in a region of the country didn&#39;t agree &gt;:().<br><br>We&#39;ve got elections next spring, but he still intend to run for left, despite the fact he &#39;promised&#39; to not run if the situation was as ducked up as she is actually, meaning that other people at the party want the canddature at left, to the point where other just left the party to prepare their own campaign. <br><br>And the right is in the same state because the ex-president, who had &#39;retired&#39; from political life, is coming for the candidature for the right, leading to another micmac like the one in the left. <br><br>Only party going well is far-right, where the daughter of the precedent leader there, who was someone with a murky background at best, has succeeded in selling her... message, when she&#39;s as much a racist as dearest daddy. She cannot win second turn of the election, but is almost certain of going there.<br><br>I&#39;d vote for the left, provied they change of leader. If not... I&#39;ll still vote, if only for not giving their victory to the far right nutjobs vaunting the success of &#39;Brexit&#39;, forgetting these nutjobs jumped off the ship as soon as possible...</p>

            <p>I&#39;m a socialist. For more or less the reasons hS gives: I think it is hypocritical to have this national ideal that the human rights are &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,&quot; and yet stymie all of those. With wealth caps when given the chance - health care costs money (…life?), college costs not money so much as &quot;the rest of your life in debt,&quot; (life, and also… happiness?), if you&#39;re arrested for nigh-on anything, the difference between liberty and bondage is just how much money you have. <br><br>And that doesn&#39;t even touch on how this impacts people of color more harshly in all cases. BUT, of course, being an historian, I&#39;m aware the US was founded on those ideals (the difference being that pursuit of happiness was initially listed as private property rights, which included, of course, slices), with the heavy caveat being &quot;if you are a propertied white man.&quot; Nonetheless, I think they&#39;d be good things to have if we could get them to work for all people. <br><br>…another factor is that the US has been stuck in the Cold War for the past 60-70 years, and it may have doomed the planet, so the sooner we get out of that idiocy, the sooner there&#39;s hope for all of us. <br><br>The current political situation here, as far as I can tell, is that the Conservative party in our country, in their increasingly radical attempts to put down the left and characterize their opponents as evil monsters of in-American evil, has finally overstepped to the point where they can no longer support their own weight (because most conservatives might support laws against making insurance companies pay for birth control, but they won&#39;t support someone who brags about sexual assault; likewise, most conservatives might support immigration restrictions and racial profiling in general, but they won&#39;t go for actual Nazis), and fractured heavily. Since they&#39;d become a huge drag on the government&#39;s ability to function lately (ie, when they were a majority they blocked the president, when they were a minority they filibustered or threatened to filibuster every time they couldn&#39;t get their way, and most recently they decided to defy precedent and law because of sheer orneriness and not wanting to lose the Supreme Court), I&#39;m applauding. Maybe the left can finally have a chance to effect real change now. </p>

            <p>My outlook on life is that the only real value in any human behavior is in serving our species and our planet.  It&#39;s everyone&#39;s job to support each other, and to ensure the long-lasting nature of the human species and the planet it calls home.<br><br>So I have little respect for the political parties, especially the big two in the United States, because their only goals are to be self-sustaining and serve their own interests, to the detriment of average citizens.  (I also have no respect for large businesses that think their only purpose is to keep amassing larger amounts of never-used money in their bank accounts, rather than to provide a quality service or product to society.)  Hence, I vote based on what an individual candidate seems likely to do for the community and the people who live in it.<br><br>The current U.S. presidential election is a difficult one for me.  I frankly don&#39;t want either big party candidate elected.  Trump quite simply is not a leader in any way, and is likely to have any policies he puts forward influenced by his clearly bigoted and prejudiced views.  The only positive thing I can see coming out of a Trump presidency is that he&#39;s not likely to send U.S. troops to deal with any random conflict that doesn&#39;t directly affect our country out of a sense of &quot;peacekeeping,&quot; but I&#39;m also quite worried his temper and argumentativeness will get us into another war with a far more dangerous power.  Clinton will be a more competent leader, but I also feel, after the years she and her husband have spent in politics, that she&#39;s potentially in the pockets of Gan knows how many corporate interests.  The couple have also left a trail of bodies behind them from cover-ups—I know some people consider that a nutty conspiracy theory, but frankly, there&#39;s just too much evidence for me to dismiss it.  So even though I think she would do the job well, there&#39;s so much darkness in her past that I don&#39;t feel she deserves to be rewarded for her actions with the presidency.<br><br>For very personal reasons, I also refuse to vote for anyone in the Libertarian party, because members of that party attempted to run me over while I was walking home from the bus stop one day.  (My mom was working as personal secretary to Arizona Secretary of State <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Dee_Hull">Jane Hull</a> at the time, and the implied drive-by was meant as a threat to Hull&#39;s office.)  So I basically have terrible options in this election overall.  Green Party?  Probably Green Party.<br><br>So yeah.  I don&#39;t really know what to call myself, and I don&#39;t particularly care what political label applies.  Again, the parties don&#39;t matter; people and planet do.<br><br>—Fun fact: The first exposure doctorlit had to Tolkien was watching the animated Hobbit film on a VHS tape in Secretary Hull&#39;s living room, because I was sick out from school, and had to go to &quot;work&quot; with Mom.  He still has trouble watching the scene with Gollum to this day.</p>

            <p>I am right. Very right. As in, take a long walk down to the far end of the political pier, jump off into the murky waters no one seems to know exist, and you should see me, struggling to make sense of the world.<br><br>In all seriousness, though, I&#39;m an Anarcho-capitalist. However, since I very much doubt any of my political or social views will gain much traction in my lifetime, I pretty much just lump myself in with the Libertarian party and hope for the best.<br>As to the why, that can largely be summed up as, &quot;I don&#39;t think government is moral, and I think we can manage without it.&quot;<br><br>As for my opinions on my country&#39;s current politics... It&#39;s a mess, plain and simple. <br><br>And as for who I would support, I don&#39;t know Clinton&#39;s policies well enough to have a real opinion on her, much less vote for her, Trump needs to be smacked in the face with a trout, and the last candidate to win on a third party ticket was Abraham Lincoln. So, no one. So far as I know it&#39;s too late for me to register anyway.</p>

            <p>I mean, the whole left-right thing is a mess anyway, and varies wildly between countries. But I suggest you not say you&#39;re far-right, because that usually translates as fascist/racist/nationalist, which isn&#39;t what you&#39;re saying.<br><br>The <a href="https://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2">Political Compass</a> site instead uses a 2D spectrum: it has a horizontal left/right line, which is basically &#39;how much control should the government have over the market&#39;. On that one you do come down as far-right (&#39;entirely free market&#39;), while I perch out on the left (&#39;capitalists don&#39;t make people happy&#39;).<br><br>They also have a vertical social axis, which they run from &#39;authoritarian&#39; to &#39;libertarian&#39;; it seems to be &#39;how much should the government control what people are allowed to do&#39;. On that scale, you&#39;re somewhere down at the bottom, again as you might expect.<br><br>The interesting point is that most people fall on a straight line from Libertarian Left to Authoritarian Right. The Libertarian Right (and Authoritarian Left) quadrants are usually empty.<br><br>So lookit that! You&#39;re a special snowflake. ^<em>^<br><br>We actually played around with the Political Compass site this time last year - it seems to be an annual thing - and I ended up mapping everyone who responded to the thread. It kind of demonstrates what I just said:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/MoralCompass3.png"><br><br>The axes aren&#39;t quite the website&#39;s 0/0 lines - I was plotting people relative to each other, not to an arbitrary scale - but the spacing is accurate. You&#39;re probably swimming somewhere in the south-eastern ocean. Hope you brought a life jacket...<br><br>hS<br><br>PS:<br><br><i>The great continent of Plortitics is a land divided. Of course. Because they all are.<br><br>The main hub of civilisation is the great Central City, where the towns of PoorCynic, Elcalion, Phobos, Iximaz, Hieronymus, James Shields, and World-Jumper have joined together in a metropolis to astound the world. Under the protective aegis of Central City, the villages of Huinesoron, ratbrainbasher, and SeaTurtle prosper. So too do the twin port-towns of DawnFire and eatpraylove, but they do not go uncontested.<br><br>The nomads of the Great Desert have begun to band together. Trading ports have sprung up at Seafarer in the south and Sergio Turbo in the north, and there are rumours of a city to rival Central growing out in the wastes, at Desdendelle-Darkotas. Yet relations between the civilised peoples and the nomads are friendly - they are allies against other powers.<br><br>The northerly Grand Forest is home to woodsmen of unparalleled skill; all the technology of Central City cannot rout them from their tree-bound fastness. Their hidden refuge of Pippa&#39;s Ghost is guarded by the fastnesses of JulyFlame, Irish Samurai, and son</em>of_heaven176.<br><br>And far to the east, explorers in the Towering Mountains have reported two vast fortresses, teeming with warriors. None know their alliegence, but whispered rumours have assigned them names: Dark Brother and Uber Overlord.<br><br>And that is all... save, perhaps, for the peoples who live west of the Fabled River. The villages at Artell, Scapegrace, and VixenMage are small and humble... but legends tell of a vast, deserted metropolis buried at Kaitlyn, an ancient power long-since forgotten... at least, forgotten by those east of the river...</i><br><br>~hS</p>

Still. Because of course.<br><br>The heart of Plortitics tells a tale of invasion and conquest. Over the centuries, the vast Central City of Hieronymus has extended its reach, and the advent of the railroads has accelerated the process. The villages of Huinesoron and doctorlit have been brought under the Hieronymus aegis, and vast iron towers pierce their skies. The ancient cities of nearby lands have fallen: the port of eatpraylove-DawnFire subsumed by the harbour-city Neshomeh, the desert metropolis of Desdendelle-Darkotas now the railworks at PoorCynic-Hardric.<br><br>Even beyond the reach of Hieronymus, change is the order of the day. The refugees of eatpraylove fled along the coast, conquering their rival desert port of Seafarer; in turn, Seafarer lived up to its name, setting sail as a floating slice of desert.<br><br>To the north, the retreating nomads of Desdendelle found their way to the Grand Forest. The fortress-cities fought in vain: Desdendelle rose anew in the ruins of their civilisation, and only JulyFlame survived, standing tall amid the burned lands of the war.<br><br>Invasion comes not only from the west. In the east, the mountain stronghold of the Dark Brother has fallen to a new ruler, the War-Queen Alleb. It is unknown whether she has formed an alliance with the Uber Overlord, or whether he fled from her, but his vast brass fortress has crawled across the mountains clear to the borders of the Great Desert. In its wake, insidious spiders of gleaming metal crawl across the land, remaking it in their image. The plains east of the Forest are now known only as the Brasslands.<br><br>Brasswork has penetrated the southern ocean, too. The floating snowflake of Badger421 is a bastion of order amid the choppy seas, separate by choice from the governments of Plortitics. West and closer to the coast, the steel island of Tomash stands firm amid the strongest swells, strange lights gleaming in its upper reaches.<br><br>But what of the Fabled River, traditional boundary of the Central government? Though its course has been altered close to the sea, it remains as it has always been: a gentle, clean stream, flowing down from the mountains. The long-abandoned ruins at Kaitlyn still guard its upper courses - but even in these wide plains there have been changes.<br><br>The towns of Vixenmage, Scapegrace, and palindromordnilap no longer sit on their ancient sites. Trading with Tomash, they have worked brass and steel into the very fabric of their buildings, and now they roam across the landscape, clanking through the night.<br><br>So matters stand in the vast, isolated lands of Plortitics, but more change is on the way from the north. A storme is coming, and the hawks of war flock in its wake...<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Kaitlyn is at -8.75, -6.05, for (my) future reference.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been looking for land mapmaker a for a long time for D&amp;D campaigns - most of the ones that come up are just internal dungeons, and you&#39;re stuck with pencils and graph paper (not that there&#39;s anything wrong wih that), but the Inkarnate tool (still in beta so a bit clunky, and I don&#39;t remember the URL - it&#39;s either .net or .com or .org or something) is really, really helpful. </p>

Currently, sixteen inhabited asteroids are included in the segment.<br><br>The main cluster remains as chaotic as ever. Asteroid JulyFlame has just completed a two-year orbit around the newly-colonised Asteroid Storme Hawk, and appears to have picked up some kind of resonance with Asteroid Desdendelle. This resonance may have caused the rapid ejection of Asteroid Seafarer, which is spinning rapidly to system west.<br><br>The slow-moving Central Group - Asteroids Neshomeh and doctorlit - are continuing their stately way through space, though there are concerns that Asteroid Neshomeh may be due for a close encounter with the careening Seafarer. Of far more immediate concern is the  impending collision of Asteroids PoorCynic and Hardric; the evacuation effort is ongoing, but an attempt to alter their orbits by shunting the fast-moving Asteroid HG into their vicinity has failed.<br><br>The migrant Commie Cluster continues its passage through the south-western reaches of the segment. Asteroids Vixenmage and Scapegrace form the heart of the group, while Asteroid Huinesoron has spun off towards the centre of the segment, and may become entangled in the gravitational fields there. Asteroid palindromordnilap has just recently entered the segment, and is considered a member of the Cluster; the trailing Asteroid Tomash&#39;s status is under debate.<br><br>In the far system north-east, Asteroid Alleb has recently entered the segment. It is currently being used as a staging post for extra-segment observations of the hyperaccelerated Asteroid EAIUO: this body, ejected from what was known as the Realm of Evil and Darkness, is on a beeline for the heart of the segment. If it cannot be diverted, there is a significant chance of a catastrophic collision.<br><br><hr>

            <p><s>I randomly changed your numbers for my own entertainment.</s><br><br>Nah, what I&#39;ve done is readjust the axes to centre around the average of <i>Boarders&#39;</i> responses. We concluded last time that the Political Compass is great for letting you compare your results to other real people, but tends to shift everyone left+down compared to their calculated politicians. So the red lines aren&#39;t quite a match for the ones on the website, which I think would place <i>everyone</i> this year except you left-of-centre.<br><br>The average is at -5.2, -4.72 right now, which is why you&#39;re <i>so</i> far out there.

            <p>And the answer is simple.  Donald Trump.  When the Republican Party nominated him, I wanted to get as far away from him as possible.  I could no longer even remotely support a Republican Party that nominated him.  And so that caused me to reevaluate my stances on most things.  And so I determined that the Democrats were offering an infinitely more reasonable platform so I shifted accordingly.  The biggest changes for me was actually Taxes and Gun Control.  After San Bernardino I decided enough was enough, something needed to change.  <br><br>As for taxes, I decided that right now the US Tax Code is an issue, too many  people who do not need tax breaks get them, and cutting spending alone is not going to be enough to fix the budget problems.  So the US needs to raise taxes and there is lot of very wealthy people who can afford higher taxes and don&#39;t pay much if at all.  I also determined that on an economic scale, trimming bloat from Government Programs is a better choice than getting rid of them altogether.  <br><br>The other part of it is, that with Trump&#39;s rise, I went back looking at my own personal stances on many issues, and I realized that some of my previous held arguments did not seem to hold water, and when I could not find a better reason to maintain that stance, I adjusted accordingly.  And so I wound up shifting left.  </p>

            <p>Okay, so first off, Anarcho-Capitalism is pretty much just the belief that government is immoral, and can be replaced by voluntary cooperation and free market systems. I realize that&#39;s a bit vague, but I&#39;m not sure how to fix that given how varied it can be and my rather unimpressive ability to explain those variances, so... Yeah. If you&#39;ve got more specific questions I can try to answer them, but there&#39;s no guarantee I&#39;ll actually have a decent answer. Still learning myself, actually.<br><br>I&#39;m fairly sure there are a few websites out there that go into the philosophy behind anarcho-capitalism (the one that springs to mind being the Mises Institute,) but I really don&#39;t know much about them, so I&#39;ve no idea if they&#39;d be at all helpful.<br><br>Now, as for why I disagree with the morality of government, that&#39;s a bit complicated. The basic principle for me is that I think it&#39;s wrong for people to force others to do things by force or threat of force, and I don&#39;t consider the government to be anything more than just people. If the individuals who make up a country do not have the right to dictate the lives of others, then I don&#39;t think they can delegate that right to others.<br><br>And getting by without government, that&#39;s the part I&#39;m shakiest on. I personally think that if the government is nothing more than people, why couldn&#39;t everything the government does be done voluntarily? Crime and infrastructure are some thorny issues, but there are possible solutions to them, and I think they&#39;d work.<br><br>Right then, hopefully I&#39;ve managed to write something useful rather than just vaguely nattering for four paragraphs. Let me know if you have any more questions. I might not have useful answers to said questions (and I might not convey them well if I do) but I will do my best.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very practical, for one big reason: humans are jerks.<br><br>You say that you think it&#39;s wrong for people to force others to do things by force. That is, in my opinion, a fantastic thing to believe - I&#39;m sure most people here believe something similar - but there are some people who just don&#39;t care about morals. They&#39;d do what they wanted, because there&#39;d be no risk of punishment. The only way to put a stop to it would be to <i>force them to stop by force.</i><br><br>On government: the way I see it, a government is an organisation (non-profit, which might be anathema to your capitalist ideals, but bear with me) which has the purpose of making life better for the people living in the area it administrates. Yes, sometimes it uses force or implied threats to force its citizens to act in specific ways, but, in general, it only does this for situations where the actions of a person or group of persons would infringe on the well-being (/rights) of another - which, to my mind, is the exception to the &quot;forcing people to do things is wrong&quot; rule.<br><br>So I really disagree with the idea that government is immoral. Do you have any thoughts on any of my points? I&#39;d love to hear any solutions your philosophy might provide.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not used to discussing this stuff through text, hence why it&#39;s taken so long to respond.<br><br>So, to your first point, it&#39;s not entirely accurate to say an anarcho-capitalist society is one without consequence. There are a few ideas I&#39;ve come across but the one I think would work best would be a system of contracts. Everything you do is built on contracts: Water, power, heating, internet, food, business transactions, etc. So, if you do something immoral, say, fraud, you&#39;d most likely be breaking a contract. Include a clause in the standard contract that stipulates maliciously violating the terms of a contract allows other parties to break their contracts with the offender, and/or some form of compensation agreement, and there you go, consequence.<br><br>Of course that system has problems (a profound lack of data being a glaring one), but so does every system, at least this one is voluntary.<br><br>To your second point, yes, not every action government takes is violent, but all are built on the first initiation of force that is collecting taxes and enforcing law. There&#39;s never any agreement to be bound by US law, there&#39;s no option to say no. If you&#39;re born here then as long as you have an income the government will hound you for a piece of it, and as long as you live here they will fine or imprison you if you violate its decrees. The threat of consequence you never agreed to is always there. That&#39;s not something I can accept as moral. <br><br>Hope that was helpful to you. As I mentioned, really not used to discussing this stuff over text, so I apologize if I&#39;m not being clear. Thanks for the questions, though. It&#39;s interesting to see what people think of this stuff.</p>

            <p>I think Nesh brought up my main objection to the contract thing: someone who wants to (insert violent crime here) somebody isn&#39;t going to sign a contract with that somebody saying they won&#39;t (insert violent crime here) them unless constrained to.<br><br>The other thing, though, is this: who enforces the contract? If you&#39;re a weedy nerdy person like me, and you sign a contract with a group of big and strong but not terribly bright people to do their brainwork in exchange for them giving you money and muscles, and you fulfill your side, but they don&#39;t fulfill theirs, what can you do in your system to gain recompense? Because they won&#39;t be able to solve it on their own.<br><br>This ties in to how I see government (and I see you brought up taxes - score!): the government puts in place the laws agreed on by the people alongside infrastructure for mediating breaches of said laws. In exchange for this service, anyone expecting protection under these laws pays the government to provide that protection. (This, actually, is what we call the social contract - everyone agrees to follow the government&#39;s laws in exchange for not having to tidy up all their own disputes with others, among other things.) If you don&#39;t want to follow a specific country&#39;s laws, fine - you have the option of changing country.<br><br>tl;dr: Government provides services and thus expects to be paid; government is the ultimate extension of your system of contracts.</p>

            <p>If everything is based contracts, does that mean that you have to sign an agreement with every single person you meet that you won&#39;t murder them and take all their stuff? And if you don&#39;t have a contract with them, is it totally okay in your world to murder them and take all their stuff?<br><br>Legit question; you talk about morality, but then you focus on utilities and business, saying nothing about what happens when someone actually harms another person, which is usually the heart of any conversation about morals. This confuses me very much. Methinks you are maybe confusing ethics and morals?<br><br>Also, what about children? What&#39;s their ability to give informed consent to any kind of contract? Are their parents allowed to discipline them, or what? Do they have to sign a contract saying they agree to feed, clothe, and otherwise nurture that child, or they&#39;re allowed to beat them, starve them, and otherwise abuse/neglect them all they want? Is anyone allowed to tell them that&#39;s wrong and they should stop it? Do they have any recourse at all if the parent says &quot;make me&quot; and pulls a gun or something?<br><br>If someone, say, signs a contract with their local coal mine saying it&#39;s okay to put their child to work down a dark hole all day, that&#39;s perfectly acceptable?<br><br>Can we, like, ask everyone to sign a contract with the planet promising not to pollute it to the point that we can&#39;t live on it anymore?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>When it comes to violent crime like robbery or murder, the options are pretty much the same as under government: protect yourself and your property to the extent you deem necessary or seek protection from an outside agency. A rather important exception to the &quot;don&#39;t compel others by force&quot; rule that I completely forgot to mention is self defence and defence of others. There are even some people who advocate for including prisons in the list of things carried over from government, though how they square that with the whole &quot;right to life, liberty, and property&quot; thing I have absolutely no idea.<br><br>Now, as for why I was focusing on consequence through contract when replying to Seafarer, that was simply because they mentioned people doing whatever they wanted without fear of punishment, rather than something specific like in your post (still getting to that, by the way).<br><br>And as for the children, that&#39;s one of the areas I mentioned where I just don&#39;t have an answer. Not a particularly compelling one, anyway.<br>You could put together community contracts establishing certain moral standards, but unlike with utilities, goods, or services, there&#39;s not really much inventive to sign them. You could rely on people being moral enough to refuse service to people who don&#39;t treat their children well enough, but that has far too many holes to be anywhere near reliable and does nothing to actually stop it. You could work into a community contract provisions for removing a child from an abusive home (come to think of it, that might be how some people justify the prison system I mentioned. Hmm.), but again, there&#39;s no reason to sign it, and if they don&#39;t agree it&#39;s no different from government. Lastly, you could rely on individuals to act themselves to remove the child, but then they themselves would be initiating force and infringing on the rights of others.<br>Maybe one of these or other solutions would work, but without data and a whole lot more thought, I just don&#39;t know.<br><br>And as for a child&#39;s ability to give informed consent on things like security, I honestly don&#39;t know how to answer that. Maybe someone else does, but I don&#39;t. As I mentioned, I&#39;m still learning. Questions like that are why I try not to present anything I say as a certainty.<br><br>The thing is, I&#39;m not an anarcho-capitalist because I think it&#39;s a perfect system, far from it. I&#39;m an anarcho-capitalist because it&#39;s the best alternative to government I&#39;ve found so far. Maybe there&#39;s an answer to your question that squares well enough with my philosophy, maybe there isn&#39;t. If there is, I may never find it. All I know is that I cannot countenance statism, and I trust humanity to find alternatives.</p>

            <p>Seafarer said: &quot;a government is an organisation (non-profit, which might be anathema to your capitalist ideals, but bear with me) which has the purpose of making life better for the people living in the area it administrates.&quot;<br><br>Neshomeh said: &quot;I consider the role of government to be enforcing the will of the people it governs—ideally with full consideration of human rights for all and for the world we all share. [...] to uphold the rights of women, black people, gay people, Muslims, etc., when certain vocal and powerful groups would silence them, subjugate them, or even kill them for the offense of not being straight white Christian men.&quot;<br><br>Badger421 hasn&#39;t framed it precisely, but this makes their idea pretty clear: &quot;If the individuals who make up a country do not have the right to dictate the lives of others, then I don&#39;t think they can delegate that right to others. [...] not every action government takes is violent, but all are built on the first initiation of force that is collecting taxes and enforcing law. There&#39;s never any agreement to be bound by US law, there&#39;s no option to say no. If you&#39;re born here then as long as you have an income the government will hound you for a piece of it, and as long as you live here they will fine or imprison you if you violate its decrees.&quot;<br><br>My interpretation of the above is that they feel governments exist to enforce their own laws, and to fund themselves through taxes - something of a self-sustaining system where the purpose of a government is to go on being a government (much like a corporation).<br><br>For myself, I mostly agree with Seafarer: the purpose of a government, or any political/country-management system by any name, is to improve the lives of its people, and ultimately to make the world a better place. Whether it does that by representing those people (per Neshomeh, and per democracy as a whole), or by some other means, depends on the government. So I guess that&#39;s my answer to &#39;what is government?&#39;, too: any system or setup which attempts to carry out the purpose of government. It may be wildly ineffective (the king sits in his castle and issues orders which no-one listens to), but it&#39;s still (a) government.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I also believe that it&#39;s wrong to force your beliefs on others... but I consider the role of government to be enforcing the will of the people it governs—ideally with full consideration of human rights for all and for the world we all share. It&#39;s not some external body coming in from outside and pushing us around for lulz, and I think it&#39;s very necessary to uphold the rights of women, black people, gay people, Muslims, etc., when certain vocal and powerful groups would silence them, subjugate them, or even kill them for the offense of not being straight white Christian men.<br><br>I&#39;m wondering, how does your philosophy answer a situation like somebody bombing an abortion clinic? I think we would both agree that women should have the freedom to seek that service, and that no one should be allowed to enforce their will on them, but what do you do about it without rule of law and a government to enforce it? Isn&#39;t any action another person would take against the bomber also enforcing their will on the bomber? Hurting others is clearly wrong, but how does your philosophy reckon with preventing someone from doing it, or punishing them when they do, if no one can enforce their will on anyone ever? And—let&#39;s just make it thornier while we&#39;re at it—does the unborn fetus also get consideration in this? Does it have a right to exist, even if the mother can&#39;t feed it, or love it, or safely bear it to term?<br><br>... Feel free not to answer that. I picked a tricky issue on purpose, to shine a bright light on the problems I see with what you say, but I don&#39;t want to put anyone in a situation where they&#39;re not comfortable speaking.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>But Shadowrun and, to a much lesser extent, the modern (and past, for that matter) world aren&#39;t really fair comparisons to anarcho-capitalism. There are some pretty significant differences, the most relevant being that big corporations like in Shadowrun often gain (or at least maintain) their monopolies through government. Lobbying for excessive fees and regulations that smother new businesses, artificially securing a monopoly on products through intellectual property law, things like that.<br><br>The idea of regulation through capitalism is to vote with your wallets, essentially. If a company is doing something immoral you don&#39;t forbid them from doing it, you just buy from someone else. If an unscrupulous company isn&#39;t sufficiently moral for the buying public, another company with take its place. Competition is everything, and competition favors the business practices that most satisfy the consumer public. <br><br>Of course, this is all just my opinion. I don&#39;t have data to back it up (not entirely sure how one would gather data on this, either), it&#39;s just my interpretation of my own observations. I may be wrong, or I may be right. Or I could be varying degrees of both, draw your own conclusions.</p>

            <p>I think you underestimate the extraterritoriality&#39;s status in Shadowrun, making the megacorps their own &#39;nations&#39;, owing nothing to no one. There are plenty zones where the abscence of government lead to the worst. And even in zones with government, they pretty much do their own thing.<br><br>And that leads me to my actual point. People worshipping the bottom line, who already failed at all levels in self-regulation, like the current crisis proves it, can litterally cannot be trusted. <br><br>If one these companies decided to do something ammoral like storng-arming me to buy their products or anything like this, I&#39;d have absolutely no answer. and forget about voting with my wallet, these dudes will have taken it a long time ago. <br><br>There would be nothing stopping them to do that, and even if they didn&#39;t use actual violence, indiret pressures can do the job pretty quickly. Competition with some rules already crashed pretty hard, it&#39;s a no-brainer that competition without rules will end with an even worst result.<br><br>You&#39;re right, competition is everything. Thing is, once all the rules are gone, morality is one of the first things thrown under the bus. And the rest follows very quickly.</p>

            <p>And whatever else you might think of them, Republicans are excellent at marching in lockstep, regardless of whether or not it&#39;s in their interest. However, forcing the Republicans to switch gears so drastically is going to take money they might not have and time they definitely don&#39;t, so I don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to be as much of a gridlock as people think.<br><br>Put it this way: Trump&#39;s presidential campaign is such a lost cause that he might lose <i>Utah</i> to a local independent. This is a good thing. However, <i><b>WE CANNOT BE COMPLACENT</b></i>. Complacency is how Brexit happened. Get out the vote. Make people vote for Clinton. Don&#39;t let another Nader issue happen again. Don&#39;t follow the pattern established by Maine&#39;s last two gubernatorial elections. Please. For the sake of the rest of the planet, vote Democrat this year. Mass action doesn&#39;t work if the people don&#39;t mass, and the easiest way to delay mass action is to appeal to individual disengagement, to convince people that no, their vote does not matter. Your vote matters, your vote counts. Vote for who you want, but please, I implore you to vote for Clinton. Vote for someone who will appoint left-leaning SCOTUS judges. Vote against a posing, grunting dictator who belongs in a banana republic.</p>

            <p>I realise Scape is our vocal socialist on the Board, but I&#39;m out there too. I&#39;m the one who voted no to Brexit on /principle/, rather than evidence.<br><br>Why?

Our goal should be to help /everyone/, not just the rich or the English.<br><br>Right now, Britain kind of sucks at that. We have a conservative party in power, gleefully privatising everything they can get their mitts on while dragging us out of the continental union.

            <p>Thank the electoral college system; I live in a very red state, and I have a feeling that most people here are going to vote by party rather than by candidate.  Plus, the Republican VP used to be our state governor. <br><br>I guess I&#39;m just sick of the constant pressure to &quot;pick a side&quot; from both parties.  Politics is something I just do not have the energy for, neither candidate is appealing in terms of personality, and I don&#39;t feel like I have enough understanding of their plans to improve the country to vote on that.  And given that my parents fall to one side and most of my friends fall to the other, I feel like I&#39;m constantly being pulled both ways at the same time.  It doesn&#39;t help that everyone seems to act like it&#39;s an issue of morality.  I feel like I have to defend a side I don&#39;t agree with because otherwise people I care about are being demonized.<br><br>It&#39;s just really stressful, and I just want to get away from it.  Nothing I do will make a difference one way or another, so why do I have to feel awful about it?</p>

            <p>By which I mean, he needs to accept that the modern left is a post-nationalist, globalist effort that cannot and should not favour economic protectionism; letting drug companies dictate the prices of their medicines is forcing the sick and the dying to negotiate with people who have everything to gain. Without a single buyer like the NHS, drug companies hold all the cards; with a single buyer, the patients can get the care and medicine they need without breaking the bank (or, for instance, being forced to pay hundreds of dollars to <i>hold their baby after giving birth to it what is <b>wrong</b> with you people</i>). That, I think, is what he should be advocating for rather than this proposition.<br><br>Additionally, while it&#39;s a supremely unpopular position in the US, I would personally like to see massive cuts to the insanely bloated defence budget - but I would counter the bad PR of this with an expansion of veterans&#39; benefits. I&#39;m a pacifist; I do not believe that war is even slightly necessary, and while I have the greatest respect for those who choose to enter military service, militarism and those services have been running roughshod over the political landscape for far, far too long. The United States, with a population somewhere north of three hundred million people, is the only country in which military personnel constitute a <i>voting demographic</i>, and the existence of such an enormous military bothers me considerably. I reiterate that my problem is not with the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and everyone else; my problem is with the scale of their budget and the interventionist hawks who shout from the rooftops that the US military must be deployed anywhere and everywhere someone said a mean thing about America/Americans/McDonalds/Nike/Coca-Cola (delete as appropriate).<br><br>I recognise that that&#39;s idealistic.

            <p>Part of your answer is that the questions are often deliberately ambiguous: they want to know not just your answer, but (by way of that answer) what you think the question means.<br><br>I actually &#39;agree&#39;d with that one too (sorry, Scape!); my thought process is that outsourcing and importing can lead to far bigger crashes in domestic industry than it benefits the other countries. A related thought - though one that I admit I didn&#39;t have at the time - is that a major reason companies operate overseas is that regulations are weaker there. If your clothing company can manufacture in Bangladesh, they can skimp on both wages and safety for the workers. &#39;Protectionism&#39; - in the sense of encouraging domestic manufacture rather than trade - seems to me to be (partly) an anti-sweatshop technique.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Wikipedia* says &quot;some commentators, such as Jagdish Bhagwati, see developed countries [sic] efforts in imposing their own labor or environmental standards as protectionism.&quot;<br><br>I... kind of raise my eyebrows at that. On the one hand, I kinda get how it could be seen as keeping the little man down, since developed countries may have had more opportunity to come up with technologies and approaches that are more labor- and environment-friendly, where as developing countries may not have the same resources... but on the other hand, if the developing countries of the world can skip ahead to better practices, that sounds like a good idea? Can we maybe help with that?<br><br>* or at least someone who edited Wikipedia once<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I agree unreservedly with the first point. When it comes to human rights - and I think <i>health</i> is pretty high on everyone&#39;s list of those - allowing corporations to free-market their way into charging vast amounts for them is just... wrong, in my view. Which is why I view the current ongoing sale of chunks of the NHS <i>to</i> private corporations with abject horror. A National Health System is one of the best and greatest things ever to come out of the UK, but for decades now it&#39;s been whittled away. The Cameron/May governments have just been accelerating that.<br><br>The military, though... while I would also call myself a pacifist, I disagree that war is unnecessary. It&#39;s unnecessary <i>if everyone agrees it is</i>. If the world consisted solely of North America and Western Europe, then absolutely: throw out the weapons and invest in a dove factory (disclaimer: I have no idea how they build doves). But it doesn&#39;t. We have North Korea. We have ISIS. We have <i>Russia</i>, which seems worryingly inclined to revert to conquering swathes of territory (anyone remember the Crimea? It&#39;s still Russian, these days, and Ukraine can&#39;t do a thing about it).<br><br>We don&#39;t live in a world where you can scrap the military, both because it&#39;s a deterrent against other people acting, and because sometimes the only way to help people outside your borders is to get down there and shoot - or at least threaten into submission - the people who are ruining their country.<br><br>Is the US military oversized? Probably! Probably so is ours, actually; I would be happy to see both reduced to some extent. But right now, in this world, they need to exist. (Though if we could get a proper strong UN Peacekeeping Force in play... no? No? Dang.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think that giving the UN the keys to a proper strong peacekeeping force is a bad idea. Their peacekeeping forces around here — UNIFIL and UNDOF — have done a shockingly bad job of keeping the peace. Further, I wouldn&#39;t trust the UN with a lemonade stand, much less an army, since it seems to have all the worst qualities of governments without any of the redeeming features.</p>

            <p>Basically, the UN should be &quot;let&#39;s all work together toward making the world a better place for everyone&quot;, right? Except it&#39;s so full of politics it doesn&#39;t do that. The Arabs use it as a tool to bully Israel, the stronger states (Russia, US, China, etc) veto stuff they don&#39;t like, and so on and so forth. &quot;United Nations&quot; is a misnomer. &quot;World Council of Arguing&quot; fits better.</p>
