            <p>I&#39;d mostly recovered from the first blows of the election reminding me that half this country does not agree with universal human rights. And then this news sent me over the edge again. Have any of you listened to his very last album, &quot;You Want It Darker&quot;? It&#39;s heartwrenching. Quite reminiscent in a very strange way of David Bowie&#39;s farewell album. <br><br>Though I&#39;d heard &quot;Hallelujah&quot;&#39;s many covers, the first time I heard Leonard Cohen himself was back when I was involved in Food Not Bombs, a group of anarchists who used groceries&#39; discarded produce to make public meals, which were cooked in the basement of a synagogue, and distributed in a dirty and somehow still pretty park nearby. There was a boombox on a fridge, and people shuffled their mix CDs and cassettes through it, and one day, the song was &quot;Everybody Knows.&quot; I mention this because it was the first time I&#39;d heard a song like that, and because I think L Cohen would approve of this story. The song is grim and angry and bleak and yet beautiful. <br><br>That&#39;s what my memories of Hartford are. A city that&#39;s empty, usually, and dark, but the gardens are beautiful even while overgrown, and we saw a great blue heron land in a pond that was more trash than water, one day. I associate Leonard Cohen very heavily with <a href="http://www.rice-boy.com/see/">Rice Boy</a>, and probably always will.<br><br>Somewhere in my mind is a memory of Leonard Cohen saying that one day, as a student, he “came across a poem by Federico Garcia Lorca that ruined my life, I am happy to say.” The same is true of Cohen - he showed us the beauty in shadows and dust and broken glass mosaics in the cracks of the roads, and he was honest about the loneliness and the meaning of love and of G-d and of the position of self, and, and, I feel the world is missing something now that he is gone from it. <br><br><br>That was too long, and self-indulgent, but this man&#39;s music really has been a central part of my life for a long, long time. </p>

            <p>... is on the buses. Each of our local buses has a picture of a plaque under the driver&#39;s window, and each one has the name and dates of a soldier who died in the Great War. It&#39;s an excellent way to promote remembrance without in any way glorifying what happened.<br><br>And one of the best places I know of to <i>learn</i> what it was like is the book <i>Tolkien and the Great War</i>, which is built around Tolkien&#39;s time on the Somme. He went out there at the same time as three of his schoolfriends; only he and one other came back. It&#39;s a heartbreaking book that I heartily recommend. (Obviously.

That having been said, a specially defensive Lunatone can work; try a Modest one and give it EVs in Special Attack and Special Defence, with Moonlight, Calm Mind, Psychic, and Earth Power for coverage. This works best with sand support from someone like Tyranitar or Hippowdon, as sand boosts the Special Defence of Rock-type Pokemon by 50%. However, the key thing to remember is to have fun. =]</p>

            <p>Preferably neutral opinions, hence the lack of name. Apologies if that&#39;s wigging anyone out. If you guess who I am, please don&#39;t out me, at least not right away.<br><br>I was challenged to write a Permission piece using a fairly old <a href="http://legacyofkain.wikia.com/wiki/Legacy_of_Kain_Wiki">Nosgothic</a> <a href="http://legacyofkain.wikia.com/wiki/Vampires">vampire</a>, using the prompt &quot;The agents must navigate a food fight to get to the coffee.&quot; Qualities I was meant to address in the challenge include vampires&#39; weakness to water, arrogance, and need/desire for nothing besides blood.<br><br>I had an idea right away, so I went ahead and pulled about 800 words out of my butt, and now I submit them for the Board&#39;s review. So, let me know: if this were part of a real Permission attempt, would it pass muster?<br><br><hr>
<br>Shimon rustled his black wings in quiet agitation. &quot;Partner of mine, is it truly crucial to cross this dark sea of humanity?&quot;<br><br>Caprice nodded. &quot;Buddy, I need coffee like you need blood. This is happening.&quot;<br><br>However, they both hesitated. Beyond the doorway where they stood, the Cafeteria was in a full-spate riot. Food items of questionable provenance flew wildly in all directions. Agents climbed on chairs and tables to gain a better vantage; others scrambled under the same tables or else fled for the doors. Every so often, someone would escape and go pelting by the pair, leaving a spatter of mashed potatoes in their wake. Of course, mashed potatoes were the best-case scenario. Tantaflaf was almost always on the menu, and Shimon&#39;s keen vampiric senses identified what he would almost swear was brains. Not that he objected to viscera himself, but he hadn&#39;t heretofore had the impression that most humans were so open-minded about their food.<br><br>&quot;I should have left that callow Martin to rot in his shell,&quot; he muttered, echoed by a low tremolo deep in his syrinx. &quot;Now the fledgling is safe and sound back at the castle, and here I am, bound to a human with a death wish.&quot;<br><br>Caprice snorted and tossed her brown ponytail over her shoulder. &quot;You&#39;re so dramatic. What&#39;s the big deal? It&#39;s not like they&#39;re throwing holy water and wooden stakes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;For your information, mortal, we are not vulnerable to piddly splinters of wood. However, the chance that they may indeed be throwing <i>water</i> is one that I do take seriously. Water burns my kind like acid.&quot;<br><br>Caprice put her hands on her hips and took another good look around. &quot;I think anything in a cup has probably spilled by now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wonderful. So I shall only burn my feet.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can&#39;t you just, you know, fly over it?&quot;<br><br>Shimon arched a long, sculpted eyebrow at her. &quot;My wingspan is over nine feet wide, and there isn&#39;t enough clear space to get up to speed for a takeoff.&quot; He adjusted his circular spectacles—an affectation that he thought made him look distinguished. &quot;The more I think on it, the more I find this endeavor to be pointless. I will learn nothing of undoing the corruption of demons here, so I will leave you to your hunt and go spend my time on something more fruitful.&quot;<br><br>He rose onto his toes from his crouch, unfolding his long, blue legs, and turned to go.<br><br>&quot;Oh, no, you don&#39;t!&quot; Caprice grabbed his hand and hauled in the direction of the doors.<br><br>Shimon let out an involuntary <i>screep!</i> in surprise and flapped for balance. However impressive he might look at his full height, he was lighter than his size would suggest. &quot;Let go of me!&quot;<br><br>&quot;No! I&#39;m getting my coffee, and you&#39;re helping. Put that ridiculous wingspan of yours to good use and cover me.&quot; She threw all her weight into pulling him toward the Cafeteria.<br><br>He could have just sat down, and that would have been the end of it. He was stronger than any human. More powerful, indeed, than most of the other species in Headquarters. And perhaps that was why he allowed himself to go along with it. He could just imagine this impetuous young mortal running her mouth about how the big bad Razielim was afraid of a little food fight, and the thought was perfectly abhorrent.<br><br>&quot;Very well,&quot; he growled, baring his fangs. &quot;But we do it my way.&quot;<br><br>He picked his partner up and tucked her firmly under one arm, ignoring her cry of protest and her tiny fist pounding against his rib cage, and sprang forward. Rising to his full nine and a half feet of height, he stood above most of the comestible carnage and bounded over people and furniture alike, wings extended for balance and for the occasional boost. He couldn&#39;t get a full downsweep, but even a partial was enough to provide acceleration and knock some idiots down along the way.<br><br>Finally, he leaped over the service counter and deposited Caprice on the floor beneath the coffee urns. She sat still for a moment, dazed at the suddenness of it all, and straightened her windswept hair and clothes.<br><br>&quot;Wow,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;Yes, yes. Get your coffee so we may be gone. I do not know if this cover will remain adequate for long.&quot;<br><br>She nodded and pulled her thermos out of her backpack, located the regular coffee, and filled it. Once the lid was securely refastened, she looked up at Shimon and nodded. &quot;Okay. I&#39;m ready this time. Let&#39;s go.&quot;<br><br>He looked down his nose and grinned. &quot;Caprice, I have changed my mind. I do not wish to carry you again. I will see you back at the response center if you survive. Good luck!&quot; He vaulted the counter again before she could react.<br><br>&quot;You bastard! Get your feathery blue butt back here!&quot; she shouted, but in three heartbeats, he&#39;d cleared the room and was gone.<br><br><hr>
<br><b>Bio notes:</b><br><br>(Or, <i>Things I couldn&#39;t work into the story, but thought worth mentioning for context</i>.)<br><br>Shimon is a Nosgothic vampire of the Razielim clan, from an AU timeline in which they were not eradicated by Kain. They have evolved to resemble the Ancient Vampires, with increasingly bird-like traits each new period of evolution. (See this lovely lady&#39;s <a href="http://nightsail.deviantart.com/gallery/37133368/LoK-related">LoK-related gallery</a> for reference.) Shimon&#39;s wings and syrinx are fully developed, marking him as a very old burdy. He is a historian with an interest in the corruption inflicted on his homeworld by the demonic Hylden, and by extension the corruption of Mary Sues and other badfic influences. While humans aren&#39;t treated like cattle in his time, they are used as slaves. He sees them as entertaining pets at best, idiotic cretins fit only for food at worst.<br><br>Caprice is your basic World One college girl who joined the PPC for all the usual reasons. She loves her fandoms, she&#39;s not afraid to get down and dirty for them, and she&#39;s a bit of a smartass. She likes classic monsters, but she&#39;s not a gamer, so she doesn&#39;t know much about LoK, let alone AUs of it.<br><br><hr>
<br>I know the first critique I can think of is that Caprice is less developed than Shimon. However, my challenge was based on the supposed difficulty of writing a Nosgothic vampire in the PPC, so that&#39;s what I focused on here. Were this an actual Permission attempt, I&#39;d make up for it in the other prompt.</p>

            <p>Seriously, you didn&#39;t spot the acrostic? I am sorely disappointed in you, Neshomeh.<br><br>As for Shimon == Nume... interesting. I guess what I want to ask is, other than &#39;acting like he&#39;s better than you&#39;, what did you do to make Shimon Nume? This doubles up as another question: what do you think separates Nume from, say, the Notary, or early Agent hS - other than species? What makes him unique among the arrogant quarter of HQ?<br><br>(I ask this for both our sakes - yours because I think getting your thought process written down will help you understand it, and mine because I&#39;m fed up of all my characters converging on &#39;snarky-but-friendly one-liners&#39; and would love some advice on how to separate them - again, other than species and circumstance.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... So there is. And I did miss it. Phooey. {X D I figured you&#39;d know exactly what was going on, though.<br><br>My process for translation started with basic personality, including stuff like sarcasm, misanthropy, being a know-it-all, a touch of vanity, etc. Then it gets into interests. Nume Prime is a sci-fi and fantasy geek, but they don&#39;t have <i>Star Trek</i> and LotR in Nosgoth, so I had to go for something else. History geek is close, and giving him an interest in the Hylden&#39;s corruption also gave me a reason for him to join the PPC: he&#39;s interested in undoing said corruption. This also ties into one of Nume&#39;s stealth traits, which is that he is a protector. He doesn&#39;t show it overtly, but he <i>loves</i> Middle-earth, <i>Trek</i>, etc. If he didn&#39;t, he wouldn&#39;t be doing this job despite all his bitching about it.<br><br>The squick intolerance could easily still be a thing, abetted by the fact that Nosgoth vamps are sterile and only &quot;reproduce&quot; by passing the blood curse on to humans. (Not that I imagine Shimon would have any interest in doing that, either.) He could also still have his eidetic memory, though the Bleep habit could prove tricky if the Razielim are avian enough to be allergic to it. Still, there is still that pesky need to drink blood in order to avoid withering away and dying. I don&#39;t imagine he enjoys having to do that.<br><br>Aaand I am just about out of time, so more later. Any specific questions I can address?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Hey, that&#39;s a good idea, I should try that. No, wait, I shouldn&#39;t. :-/ Anyway, I can at least throw a few thoughts at you, good and bad:<br><br>I think you&#39;ve done a good job of differentiating your agents&#39; characters, both in terms of their dialogue and actions - I like the fact that Shimon&#39;s first line ties directly into his issues with water - and the way the narration treats them. Caprice tosses a ponytail over her shoulder; Shimon gets a low tremolo in his syrinx. It&#39;s a clever technique (assuming it&#39;s deliberate!). On the other hand, I think might take it <i>too</i> far at times (what in blazes is a syrinx, anyway?); don&#39;t fall victim to thesaurus disease.<br><br>Now, a question: whose head are we in, anyway? It seems to be Shimon most of the time - &#39;ignoring her cry of protest and her tiny fist pounding against his rib cage&#39; - but we get random things like &#39;an affectation that he thought made him look distinguished&#39; or &#39;perhaps that was why&#39; etc that sound like they&#39;re picking on him. I feel like you have a third character trying to break through in the narration.<br><br>Ehm... your plot is good, though your answer to the question &#39;why does the vampire want coffee?&#39; is &#39;he doesn&#39;t&#39;. A partner is always a good way to force someone to do something; in the event that you can&#39;t do that, either (maybe his partner is a Dalek?), you&#39;d need to work in another character who they both have reason (social or employment-based) to try and help. Arrogantly. Anyway, I think the plot as it stands works well - Shimon&#39;s initial resistance, his reason for acquiescing, and his &#39;victory&#39; at the end (which makes me grin).<br><br>Speaking of which: humour. You haven&#39;t made the story overtly comedic, but what you <i>have</i> included is very well done. The deadpan &#39;So I shall only burn my feet&#39; is wonderful (as is &#39;piddly splinters&#39;... to be honest, Shimon is just funny), and you&#39;ve also worked in a little slapstick - the initial foodfight description, the <i>screep!</i> moment. Though, speaking of the latter, your physics is off: if he&#39;s light enough to be dragged around, then sitting down isn&#39;t going to prevent that.<br><br>Had something else to say, what was it? Oh, yes: you did a good job of working in trinkets of PPC knowledge (Tantaflaf), and telling me what Shimon&#39;s type of vampire can do/what he looks like. On the one hand, the &#39;blue&#39; part might have been good to know earlier; but on the other hand, I feel like some of it was probably extraneous anyway. I guess that&#39;s one of the hazards of Permission prompts, they can become As-You-Know-Bobs. But this one wasn&#39;t. If it were part of a Permission request, I think I would look on it favourably.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t want to say too much for fear of giving up the game, but:<br><br>These guys have both a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx">larynx</a> in the usual place and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrinx_(bird_anatomy)">syrinx</a> at the bifurcation of the trachea, from whence his birdy noises come. It was the only word for the job.<br><br>If I revise this (and I might!), I&#39;ll clean up the whose-head stuff. Thanks.<br><br>The vampire doesn&#39;t want coffee, but the prompt only needs him to <i>get to</i> the coffee. I decided to take the wording literally.<br><br>My line of thinking on the physics is that his higher center of gravity, plus being top-heavy due to his wings, plus not being as heavy overall as he should be, would make him easier to throw off balance if taken by surprise, as he was here. By the same token, lowering his center of gravity by sitting down would make it harder for him to be dragged around, and he could focus on using his strength to stay put. Does that make sense?<br><br>Thanks for responding!</p>

He made no attempt to welcome the man in front of him, no effort to put him at ease; merely tipped his head, the merest fraction of a nod. &quot;So. You are the famous Craban.&quot;<br><br>The man shrugged, seemingly entirely comfortable with standing in front of the Steward of Gondor unshaven, still dressed in travelling clothes. &quot;That&#39;s what they call me,&quot; he said, his accent strange and harsh to Denethor&#39;s ear.<br><br>Not that the Steward would ever allow his distaste to show. He looked out over the White City, and the vast fertile plain of the Pelennor beyond. &quot;It seems rumour has made your fame greater than it truly is, Master Craban,&quot; he said, allowing himself a thin smile. &quot;No hosts of citizens turning out to greet you, whatever we may have heard.&quot;<br><br>The scruffy man smiled back, a defiant glint in his shadowy eyes. &quot;The rich rarely welcome anyone who stands up for those they exploit... my lord.&quot;<br><br>Denethor felt his smile crystallise. &quot;My people do not exploit one another, Master Craban,&quot; he said, locking onto the other&#39;s gaze.<br><br>Craban did not flinch away. &quot;There&#39;s more to Gondor than Minas Tirith.&quot;<br><br>Denethor held the stare for another moment, then let it drop and turned towards the north-west. &quot;As I well know. But you are not from Gondor, are you? You come to us out of the north - from Eriador.&quot;<br><br>Craban nodded. &quot;Arnor, as was,&quot; he said, &quot;and mayhap will be again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And in that forsaken land, your claims of abuse may hold some truth,&quot; Denethor allowed. &quot;But this is Gondor. We are of fairer stock.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So I have often heard, on my travels,&quot; Craban said with a slight nod. &quot;Usually from the tongues of noble lords who care nothing for the poor and downtrodden outside their walls.&quot;<br><br>Denethor stiffened. Did this man have no sense of decorum? It seemed not - that he was unable to comprehend the Steward&#39;s subtle message. Time, then, for the sword to slip a little from its sheath. &quot;Yes, the downtrodden. You are a great champion of the... mistreated, are you not, Master Craban?&quot;<br><br>Craban eyed him, but nodded firmly. &quot;That I am. All deserve a fair chance, whether they be born rich or poor.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed.&quot; Denethor turned again, facing west along the White Mountains, and held out his hand to indicate them. &quot;Unless, of course, they happen to be Rohirrim.&quot;<br><br>The ragged man&#39;s brow furrowed deeply. &quot;The Riders have just the same rights as any other.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh?&quot; Denethor affected an expression of polite surprise, and loosed his attack. &quot;Then it is not true that you claim to have friends among the Dunlendings - those same wild men who daily ravage the western skirts of the Mark?&quot;<br><br>Craban scowled as the hit went home. &quot;There can be no peace without discourse,&quot; he said. &quot;If Rohan wishes to put an end to the depredations of certain folk of Dunland, they must talk to them. There is no other way.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed.&quot; Denethor took the opening and thrust again, driving words of steel under the other&#39;s guard. &quot;And I daresay the same can be said of the Orcs who even now hold all of Ithilien in their iron grasp?&quot;<br><br>Craban bent forward a little, as if fighting against the wind - or doubling over as the Steward&#39;s sword took him in the belly. &quot;If the goblin-kind can be brought to a treaty, surely that is better than constant war.&quot;<br><br>Denethor let his icy smile return. &quot;If this is the wisdom of the north,&quot; he said, &quot;then it is small wonder the kingdoms of old are no more.&quot;<br><br>Craban flinched as if physically struck, then straightened and took a deep breath. &quot;Lord Denethor,&quot; he said, his voice firm once more, &quot;I did not ask this audience to debate peace and war. I came on behalf of the poor among your people - to ask that you give them aid in this time of famine.&quot;<br><br>Denethor nodded sharply, angered that the Arnorian dared question his rule or try to dictate to him. &quot;I have heard their plight,&quot; he said, &quot;and have already acted to alleviate it. Lady Lothron - of Pelargir, Master Craban, not of the White City - has undertaken to support the nobles and merchants who are suffering. As they recover, so the poorer folk around them will be carried along with them, and all Gondor will be fairer for it.&quot;<br><br>Craban&#39;s mouth actually dropped open. &quot;And if the rich do not choose to share their bounty?&quot; he demanded. &quot;What will you do then, when the people of Gondor lie dying in the streets?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Master Craban,&quot; Denethor snapped, &quot;you forget your place. I rule in Gondor, not you.&quot; He reached up and touched a dry branch of the White Tree. &quot;And Gondor endures, Master Crow. For thousands of years it has endured. When the North foundered, Gondor remained firm. My people are strong-willed; they will break this famine, it will not break them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Strong-willed,&quot; Craban repeated. &quot;There is a fine line between strong-willed and stubborn, my lord Steward. Good day to you.&quot; And with no more than the most perfunctory bow, he turned on his heel and strode down into the city, leaving Denethor alone.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Craban is the singular of crebain, as in crow; I figured Corbyn was close enough to Corvid. Lothron is the month of May, as in the Prime Minister. And Denethor has no truck with socialism.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So chances are most of the non-Mormon Christians would flee to the Tex-Mex Republic--love that name--but I&#39;m guessing at least a few would band together. Here&#39;s that country. ^_^<br><br>It&#39;s called Antemurale Christianitatis, or just Antemurale. It originated in Kentucky, then migrated south to Alabama, and now stretches across Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. Antemurale has had some troubles in the past with leadership. Everyone could agree that they needed some kind of government, but no one could agree on what it should be. Finally, they decided to split themselves up by denomination and then arrange themselves like the America of old, with each denomination acting like a state within the Union. <br><br>Antemurale largely carries on the industries of the states they occupy, but there&#39;s been an astonishing upswing in conversion to the Amish way of life, so they&#39;re also known for their excellent cabins and cabinets. <br><br>-Alleb, who could not resist</p>

            <p>...am so far off schedule that I&#39;ve written about 3k words total, have definitely not written every day, and actually almost half my word count comes from the two short essays I wrote yesterday for a midterm (I like them.

It&#39;s annoying.<br><br>I have no clue if I&#39;m going to break even 10k words this time (not counting the essay I need to write for the end of the month), but I look forward to finding out.

            <p>In particular, the focus on the special effects in the trailer, as opposed to the characters, is kind of worrying for me; we only see Ed and Al, and Ed (I believe) is the only one who has any lines.  Plus... I know we didn&#39;t see much of his acting, and the only part we did was intended to be a quieter scene, but Ed just seemed kind of flat to me.  I love how expressive the characters were in the original, and I&#39;m afraid that in an effort to make it more &quot;serious,&quot; Ed will lose his cocky attitude.<br><br>Also, I get toning down the colors when transitioning from animated to live-action to some degree, but Ed&#39;s coat just looks <i>wrong</i> to me.  It&#39;s such a popular cosplay item that I think it would have been in their best interest to copy it more accurately.</p>

            <p>My first impulse was excitement, but then I started thinking about how much plot there is, and wondering how on earth they&#39;re going to cram it into a standard feature film.

            <p>Iximaz: Okay, I just want to start this off by saying I FRIGGIN&#39; CALLED IT.<br><br>Aegis: Well of course you called it, you&#39;ve been talking with the walking spoiler. And you still fell for the red herring.<br><br>Iximaz: Oh, shut up, you did too.<br><br>Aegis: DID NOT!<br><br>Iximaz: DID TOO.<br><br>Aegis: DID NOT, slander and calumny! Well, maybe a bit, but only for five minutes or so. Besides, around now people reading this probably haven&#39;t the slightest idea what we&#39;re talking about. <br><br>Iximaz: Fine, fine. We&#39;ll get on with the review. As a fair warning, spoilers ahead.<br><br>AHEM.<br><br>...<br>...<br>...<br><br>Oh my god, you guys, I can&#39;t believe they killed the niffler.<br><br>Aegis: Well, the reveal that it was actually Dumbledore more than made up for it. By now, the audience has probably gathered that we are, in fact, kidding. But if you don&#39;t want spoilers, leave now. <br><br>Iximaz: Okay, for real, you guys: I loved this movie. I can&#39;t say it enough. It was <i>almost</i> good enough to make up for the <i>Cursed Child</i> fiasco <s>because nothing can really make up for that mess of a glorified fanfic NO I&#39;M NOT STILL MAD ABOUT THAT</s>. The humor was spot-on, the characters were likeable <s>especially the niffler he was the best</s>, the plot was engaging, and I had the stupidest grin on my face the whole time I was watching it. Almost nothing but overwhelming praise for it.<br><br>Aegis: Aw, now I can&#39;t fanboy over it. Hmm. I suppose the best place to start would be the format. Shush, Ix, I&#39;m not talking about the niffler. You can do that. Something to note is that we both saw this in 3D, and it was worth it. There are several moments that are extremely immersive. A few even made me flinch, and the Apparition may well give you motion sickness- it&#39;s THAT cool. <br><br>Iximaz: Oh, yeah, the Apparation was really cool, especially how much it was used in the final showdown; it makes sense, considering they were both practiced wizards instead of students. BUT OKAY, CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABOUT THE OBSCURUS AND MY THEORY ABOUT ARIANA?<br><br>Aegis: No. We can&#39;t. Mostly because I agreed with it. Go on and explain. <br><br>Iximaz: Okay, for those of you who for whatever reason haven&#39;t seen the movie yet but want the spoilers anyway, an Obscurus is a dark force of magic that is created in young wizards when their magic is deliberately suppressed though constant abuse (theory as to why this didn&#39;t happen to Harry: the Dursleys only neglected him, never forcibly squashed his magic outbursts). *puts on tinfoil hat* Ariana Dumbledore, after her encounter with the Muggle boys who beat her, was kept locked up in the house and it was implied that Kendra Dumbledore abused her children, but that didn&#39;t prevent Ariana&#39;s now-damaged magic from randomly bursting out at times. What if Grindelwald first found out about Obscurials through Ariana before she was killed, because she was slowly turning into one? *removes tinfoil hat*<br><br>Aegis: Oh, go ahead and spoil the whole thing, why don&#39;t you! For those of you who don&#39;t know, there was a long-standing rumor that Grindelwald would be appearing. When it was announced that Johnny Depp would be portraying the wizard, and would be making an appearance in this film, the rumors flew thicker and faster than Dementors chasing Harry Potter that Grindelwald was a lot closer than most people believed. In fact, he was Graves. And, at long last, those rumors can finally be. . . <br>. . .<br>Confirmed! When Graves gives Credence a token to call him with- a token in the form of Grindelwald&#39;s logo? Both Ix and I got funny looks from the entire audience from the palpable squeeing. Dark wizard pimp aside, it was awesome.   <br><br>Iximaz: ...Yeah, he totally looked like a wizard pimp and not Dumbledore&#39;s archnemesis. Which was a tad disappointing. But I still totally called what happened with Graves! HA! *clears throat* Anyway, the only major complaint I have about the movie is the resolution. Because frankly... that was kind of stupid.<br><br>Aegis: Oh, you mean the bit where the Thunderbird made venom rain over New York? Venom which failed to make contact with the majority of the populace, by virtue of their being indoors like EVERY SINGLE NEW YORKER, and ensuring that half of the Muggle- sorry, &quot;No-Maj&quot; population now recall an Obscurus wreaking havoc and devastation over all of New York? Yeah, that bit was moronic. However, it did make an interesting point when it noted that Muggle physiology differed from magic physiology, enough that the venom affected only the Muggle population. Just so long as they don&#39;t end up using Midichlorians, I&#39;ll be fine with it. <br><br>Iximaz: I still think they would&#39;ve been better off calling in the Men in Black.<br><br>Aegis: Makes you wonder why they started off with a perfectly good shot of the Statue of Liberty if they didn&#39;t want to switch her torch with a neuralyzer, really.<br><br>Iximaz: But anyway, stupid resolution aside, the rest of the movie was... <i>fantastic.</i><br><br>Aegis: *is too busy facepalming to respond at the moment* <br><br>Iximaz: &gt;:) Alright, alright, joking aside, it really was a good movie; while I can understand why some people might not like the &quot;gotta catch &#39;em all&quot; vibe it had going, I think it was well-done and I <i>loved</i> seeing all the creatures in the book (and then some!) come to life on the big screen. It definitely would&#39;ve been hard to convey just how cool they were in writing. <br><br>Aegis: Yep, I agree on pretty much all counts, though the Occamy tempts me to try. Those things were gorgeous. I have to say, it doesn&#39;t come off as a &quot;gotta catch &#39;em all&quot; premise. There&#39;s a nice emphasis placed on the political thriller aspect- namely, Grindelwald&#39;s rise to power, and on character development for our stars. Seeing the Eleventh Doctor with a TARDIS trunk was extremely amusing, even if he was posing as Newt Scamander. <br><br>Iximaz: Not to hate on Redmayne, but I just kept seeing Matt Smith in his performance. Which was pretty good, I gotta say. ^^; He was adorkable and basically everything a Hufflepuff should be.<br><br>Aegis: Makes him perfect for a &quot;gotta catch &#39;em all&quot; protagonist. Nobody else would be able to make the spot checks. <br><br>Iximaz: Especially for that niffler. Which was, hands-down, the best character. Any of you who say otherwise are wrong.<br><br>Aegis: *preferred the Occamy* Occamy are cool.<br><br>Iximaz: Except when you somehow manage to lob a cockroach across a room into a tiny little teapot to trap said Occamy.<br><br>Aegis: Honestly, I have no idea how it was even surviving on said cockroaches when it was the size of an apartment, but you&#39;ve gotta admit, the giant blue serpent with shining scales was gorgeous. Not to mention a dead ringer for Quetzalcoatl.<br> <br>foofooman3: One thing I have to ask: Grindelwald, the most powerful Dark wizard of the age, defeated over fifty aurors single-handedly but was taken out by a nerd with a bat?<br><br>Iximaz: Pff, pretty much. So, final verdict: 9/10 stars. Take one off for the ending. Otherwise: awesome movie and definitely worth the ticket money. I can&#39;t wait to see it again.<br><br>Aegis: More than worth the ticket movie. Overall, it was the best Pokemon story featuring the Doctor as a protagonist against a backdrop of Palpatine the Pimp&#39;s rise to power that I have ever seen. 8/10, would see again. One star for the ineffectual ending, one star for the arbitrary nature of the Obliviation of Jacob Kowalski. Seriously, Newt drops the case at his feat filled with silver eggshells that have obviously hatched, claims that they come from a magical creature, and this presents no problem. And yet his love interest walks in and suddenly he remembers everything? <br>*raises skeptical eyebrow*<br><br>Er, right. Ix says shut up, so I&#39;ll just go then, shall I?</p>

            <p>Because no one is bringing up the parts I thought were important! (SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS ahead!)<br><br>Sometimes, rarely, I latch onto a character and see every scene from their point of view. I reflexively invent a running commentary of their thoughts and feelings. While watching this movie, this happened to me. . . with Credence. You can imagine how upset I am.<br><br>I think it&#39;s totally amazing that this character, mentally ill as the result of trauma, isn&#39;t just a danger that had to be stopped. He has hopes and dreams and people he cares about. And the GREATEST THING EVER is that when the team from MACUSA comes to shoot him down, they look needlessly violent: our heroes were well on their way to talking him down. They could have calmed him, gotten him into treatment (not that they were likely to have any decent mental health treatment in this time period, but this time period didn&#39;t have Nifflers either) -- his death was a preventable tragedy stemming from governmental over-reliance on militarized law enforcement.<br>And this happens in real life.<br>And all those kids I saw in the audience will hopefully internalize that Credence didn&#39;t need to die and grow up and make the world a better place.<br>Who knows, maybe that&#39;s all a load of dingo&#39;s kidneys. But it might not be and that makes me hopeful.<br><br>So yeah, the only character I was seriously invested in probably won&#39;t be showing up again. And there seems to be little chance of Newt/Jacob happening (although it NEEDS TO), so I&#39;m not likely to watch the rest of the movies.<br><br>Other things: my mom is a total nerd about Jewish New York history, and she pointed out that if Jacob Kowalski is living on Orchard Street, he should probably be Jewish, but his last name isn&#39;t a Jewish last name. However, Tina and Queenie are Goldsteins, a very Jewish last name, and it&#39;s kind of weird that Queenie is blonde. Basically, I want more of their family history.<br><br>Although maybe I <i>don&#39;t</i>, considering how adeptly their family history is handled in the movie. Could <i>anyone</i> tell what Tina&#39;s relationship to Credence and the New Salem-ers was? I was confused, as were the two people I watched the movie with and the two people I asked afterwards. . . help!<br><br>One last point: if MACUSA is apparently progressive enough to elect an African-American woman president, why is she the only POC in a position of any power? The only others in the entire movie: foreign diplomats (different governments, don&#39;t count), a nurse/executioner (who didn&#39;t seem to give orders, just to carry out her particular job), and. . . no, wait, I think that&#39;s it. All the Saints and the donkeys they rode in on.<br><br>--Key has been taking an African-American Film History class and may never be able to watch mainstream movies again.</p>

A little scrap of fiery shadow stuff was seen escaping out of the subway by what seemed to be its own power. Newt noticed it, but of course didn&#39;t let on. So, there might be hope!

            <p>Yaaay, we saw the movie today, so I don&#39;t have to worry about spoilers anymore! But you might, so caution reading ahead. {= )<br><br>Anyway, yeah. I liked it. It was fun. For me it was just good, though, not great. It had a lot of really good stuff going for it, but I think it was trying to do just a little bit more than the run time allowed for. I really would have liked to get more in-depth with the characters—Barebone and the New Salemers felt especially shafted to me. Like... who even is that lady? Why does she hate witches/wizards so much? Why is she such a bitch? Maybe there were explanatory details that I missed, but that&#39;s kind of my point: I would&#39;ve liked a little more time to expand on these things.<br><br>I also wanted more information about all the marvelous creatures we got to meet so briefly. I honestly wouldn&#39;t have minded more romping around New York catching escaped beasties. We could have done something new instead of going after the niffler a second time, even. Yeah, he was adorable, but still.<br><br>I&#39;m not entirely clear on what the heck Grindelwald was doing there, either. Not in New York in general, I totally get that he showed up because of the Obscurial and that he probably knew a thing or two about them thanks to Arianna, but how was he able to get into what looked like a fairly high position in MACUSA coming fresh from causing mayhem over in Germany (if it was Germany)? Was there a real Graves whose place he took, or what? And why did he go to all the trouble himself? Does Grindelwald work alone, or does he have followers who might have gone in his place? Inquiring Minds Want To Know!<br><br>Also, I love Jacob and I think it&#39;s totally bogus that he got himself <s>neuralyzed</s> Obliviated at the end. Did he decide he&#39;d gotten in over his head? Was he worried about making trouble for his new friends? I don&#39;t know! We didn&#39;t have nearly enough time to get to know him, and I&#39;mma pout about it. Hmph.<br><br>Just... so many questions. o.o Hopefully the next movie will answer some of them.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Grindelwald killed the real Graves and took over his position, apparently. <br><br>I guess I kind of overlooked the rest because my brain filled in information from the Magic In North America pieces and the Fantastic Beasts book, so I didn&#39;t even realize there was a lack of exposition in those facts. ^^;<br><br>I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be seeing Jacob next time, what with Queenie showing up at the end and all.

            <p>Jacob will be back, I&#39;m sure. And he remembers most of it too. Keep this in mind: the venom removes <i>bad</i> memories. For the vast majority of the muggles, they were either terrified or unaware of the magic going on. But Jacob was having the time of his life, for most of it. There were moments of terror, removed, adding to the idea that it was all a dream. But the rest of it? The best moments of his life.</p>

            <p>Note that this doesn&#39;t quite qualify as an Emergency. More of a… sort of infestation of the PPC, with a noxious fungal growth seeping in via extra-dimensional means. The fungus varies in appearance, and was initially dubbed Ventriloqungus, for its uncanny knack of mimicking PPC voices. This is just my team&#39;s reaction. I invite your own in the thread. <br><br>***<br><br>&quot;Better or worse than the ypurs?&quot; Mohan wondered, between bursts of the flamethrower at his shoulder. <br><br>Lyn waited for another pause, sprayed a burst of liquid nitrogen over the blackened area, and shrugged. &quot;The ypurs were bad, but we got a decent source out of them - so tasteless, you could stretch any recipe out with the paste, remember? This is just… noxious.&quot;<br><br>A vworp noise and a trail of purple smoke signaled Jof&#39;s arrival. The Enderman glanced around, sizing up the area, and shook his oblong head. &quot;Not sure about this,&quot; he muttered. <br><br>Mohan nodded. &quot;Every time we clear out a patch, it pops up somewhere else. What do you do with that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;In some of the consoles, they&#39;re just ignoring it,&quot; Lyn offered. &quot;Can we seal off this section of the kitchen? It probably won&#39;t make it into the Cafeteria proper.&quot;<br><br>As she spoke, a tendril of the growth rose gently out of the area on the wall, where Mohan&#39;s flamethrower hadn&#39;t yet penetrated, and reached towards them, emitting greenish spores that churned nauseatingly and sparkled in the cool air as they floated.<br><br>The strangely echoing voice of Barid whispered, {you don&#39;t even know th—}<br><br>Mohan grimaced and blasted the air in front of them, drowning out the inevitable insult with a roar of flames.<br><br>&quot;Just keep fighting,&quot; Jof said with a shrug. He hefted the heavy axe at his hip and swung it down, shattering the frozen, charred muck on the floor. The crumbs of poison slowly faded from the air, and he reached to swing again. &quot;Don&#39;t breathe it in.&quot; Another swing, another crunch, another tile cleared. &quot;Don&#39;t believe it.&quot;<br></p>

            <p>So I published the first chapter of a series that is called &quot;In Times Gone Past.&quot; It&#39;s about a 17-year-old called Erika, who travels with a mysterious stranger from her dreams...<br><br>Your eyes glazed over, didn&#39;t they? But don&#39;t fret. Yes, this sounds like a Mary-Sue, but that&#39;s because I&#39;m planning for this series to be a satire on Whovian Sues we see today. That will mean that every adventure will be as original as possible - no canned episodes allowed! And I do have a planned amount of stories, and an end for it all.<br><br>But one thing is clear: this is a very, very complicated project. My biggest yet. And I do need betas, particularly Classic betas, but a critical review posted on this story&#39;s Pit entry would be wonderful (seriously, it has no reviews whatsoever, and that always annoys me, to see 22 views but no REviews). But anyway. If anyone wants to beta this or review it or give any advice at all, or if you just want to check it out, here&#39;s the link for the first chapter. Second chapter is still in progress. And thank you!<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12202194/1/In-Times-Gone-Past"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12202194/1/In-Times-Gone-Past">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12202194/1/In-Times-Gone-Past</a></a></p>
