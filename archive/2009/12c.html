            <p>I really hope I wasn&#39;t late this time (then again, considering different time zones,I probably am to someone, considering the Board&#39;s diverse membership).

            <p>You know, I haven&#39;t been able to bring myself to read all of My Immortal. The person who decided to make it into a comic is a genius, though. I love the hilarious panels and the drawings. (The &quot;Dude-ur-so-retarded&quot; is epic win all by itself.)</p>

            <p><b>1. Could I add a new page to PPC wikia to describe this new Fandom?</b> Of course you can! Everyone is allowed and encouraged to edit and alter the wiki and add to it if they want. <br><b>2. If there are badfics, where do I list them?</b> <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Unclaimed_Badfic"> Right here.</a> Add the category where appropriate if you need to.<br><b>3. Could I make up a new type of minis, such as mini-Knightmares?</b> Of course you can, if there&#39;s no OFU for the canon in question. If there is, they usually list what the mini is in the first chapter or so. (Oooor you can just ignore that.) Try to not choose anything common or not unique. Like mini-Dragons. <br><b>4. Does anybody know a Permission Giver&#39;s email? I MIGHT need Permission sometime.</b> I know many PG emails, and would amuse myself by giving some of them to you, but you can also ask for Permission right here in the open on the board. I believe that&#39;s the usually preferred way of doing things.<br><br><font color="#000000">*</font><font color="#161616">D</font><font color="#2b2b2b">i</font><font color="#414141">s</font><font color="#565656">a</font><font color="#6c6c6c">p</font><font color="#808080">p</font><font color="#959595">e</font><font color="#ababab">a</font><font color="#c0c0c0">r</font><font color="#d5d5d5">s</font><font color="#ebebeb">!</font><font color="#ffffff">*</font></p>

            <p>Font colors work with a hexadecimal color code, meaning a six-number code of numbers 0-9 and letters A-F. All 0s is no color, or black; all Fs is white. Between, you&#39;ve got red, green, and blue. For example:<br><br> produces <font color="#770000"><b>red text</b></font>.<br><br> produces <font color="#007700"><b>green text</b></font>.<br><br> produces <font color="#000077"><b>blue text</b></font><br><br>I&#39;ve also bolded the text so the color shows up better.

            <p>In my fic I have a scene where the protagonist boards another ship by breaching the airlock, but I never really thought about how this would be done.  If you simply destroyed the airlock with a bomb, the adjoining room would probably be sealed off to prevent the atmosphere from escaping the ship.  In your fandoms, how do people usually breach an airlock?</p>

            <p>the thing that gets me is that an airlock is made of two doors and both of them would probably closed.  You would have to cut through both of them and then leave the enemy ship with no way to stop venting oxygen.  For some reason I don&#39;t totally understand this doesn&#39;t seem right.  I&#39;m trying to find a way to board the ship, steal all of the cargo, and leave without depressurizing the ship (Although the engines are disabled.)</p>

            <p>You just kind of have to deal with that. The dock method is the only one that doesn&#39;t seal interior doors automatically, but they&#39;ll probably seal the interior doors anyway. Unless you can hack the airlock open, you&#39;ll depressurize at least one compartment unless you fix the door.</p>

            <p>I have no idea how this got into my head. But basically- Imagine that random infections from various fictions all existed simultaneously. The Blacklight virus from Prototype, the 28 days later Rage virus, the Left 4 Dead zombie virus, the Headcrab infestation from Half-Life, and Aliens from Aliens for the hell of it. They almost count as an infection.<br><br>I&#39;d probably start focussing on one specific infection, then start mentioning trouble in other places, then start spreading across the world. The biggest reason I want to do this is- What happens when a headcrab jumps on a Tank&#39;s face that has a chestburster growing inside him? The horrific combinations that could occur would be awesome.<br><br>So yeah, thoughts?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not certain, but I believe someone - July, maybe? - was ordered to PPC one of her own old fanfics and ended up recruiting. I&#39;m not sure. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with the idea - after all, badfic is badfic, and it&#39;d be a good lesson for the agent - but I imagine you&#39;d want to wait until either your agent is sufficiently experienced to handle it or until they&#39;ve done something for which the Flowers punish them.<br><br>But be careful - I don&#39;t think any PPC agents ever go into a fic for the sole purpose of <i>saving</i> an OC. Mary Sues and Marty Stus are often unsaveable - it&#39;s usually the bit characters we recruit. Your agents would probably have to go in and make the decision to recruit him while on the mission, not beforehand.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s no official list of fandoms the PPC covers. The PPC covers anything that needs covering/that they have agents to work in.<br><br>The only pseudo-official fandoms are the ones that are so hugely popular that divisions have been created for them in the various departments, like LotR and HP, because they generate so much badfic. Most fandoms don&#39;t fall into this category, but that&#39;s not because they don&#39;t have badfic. It&#39;s just not so overwhelmingly common. {= P<br><br>Inversely, there are a few fandoms (Twilight, Eragon) that are hugely popular but that no agent will go near, simply because they can&#39;t distinguish between the badfic and the canon and can&#39;t be trusted not to kill canon characters. That&#39;s not to say that the PPC wouldn&#39;t cover them if they had people willing to do it, though.<br><br>Some fandoms, like Farscape, are lucky enough to have virtually no badfic. Some mediocrefic, but no badfic. I&#39;ve looked, and I&#39;ve never once seen any hint of a serious attempt to break up the canon romances, for example. Most of the fic on the Pit is filling-in-the-blanks or AU, with a few &quot;canon adventures&quot; for spice. It&#39;s astonishing.

Basically a second pirate age occurs, only on a grander scale than before.  While the strongest pirates travel space searching for a planet&#39;s worth of treasure left by the last pirate king, Lieutenant Mark Wagner deserts the marines to form his own pirate crew.<br><br>This is my first fanfic so give me some tough love</p>

            <p>*shrug* Posting this here because it&#39;s slightly relevant, and I want to hear what you guys think:<br><br>Private letter of kerfluffle to GAFF (in their current incarnation):<br><br>Plz to be noting that it is one thing to mock someone for doing something particularly full of fail, such as writing a truly horrible fanfic, farting loudly in church, or doing anything that would get them played off by keyboard cat. This is standard to internet culture, and if you&#39;re here, you&#39;d better get used to it. However, mocking someone for giving a care about a legitimate concern (e.g., animal cruelty, or religion, or sufferers of debilitating health problems) is something else entirely.<br><br>Mocking someone for fail can be seen as a warning sign, should they choose to heed it. It&#39;s a sign that they&#39;re doing something wrong. (Also it&#39;s an excellent source of lulz, the gold of the intarwebz.) However, the targets of the second kind of mocking have done nothing wrong, and in fact show maturity by their caring. By mocking them you are telling them that doing that is wrong. You are saying, essentially, that animals can be tortured, anyone who believes in any religion is a sucker who should be laughed at, and people with cancer or AIDS can just die alone like they&#39;re fixing to do anyway. (None of which I believe to be true, and if you do, I pity you. And also want to keep you at arms length, with pepper spray and a katana if necessary.) &quot;It was for the lulz&quot; is not an excuse, if for no reason other than that the effects of what you say continue outward despite what your motives were. Screw you, I have seen too many nice people turn cynical because of stuff like that.<br><br>This, my friends, is where mocking turns into trolling.<br><br>That line is why I don&#39;t personally have a problem with MSTing and what the PPC does, even when it edges into mocking the person rather than the fanfic. The PPC, bless them (us?), does not cross that line.<br><br>Some things are just not funny.<br><br>With regards,<br>Piper<br><br>So. Discussion? I am right, or am I totally off-base? Is there a crucial ethical point I&#39;m missing? I want the board&#39;s thoughts on this.<br><br>P.S. Oh gosh that was really serious, Emo-Crusader Piper! Here, Board, have some Christmas candy in various inappropriate shapes with my apologies! Don&#39;t let my emo-ness rub off on you now--it&#39;s ever so hard to get the black stains out of your clothes.</p>

            <p>Your heart is certainly in the right place, and I agree with the basis of what you&#39;re saying - so no ethical arguments, no - but actually, I have a few nitpicks about the text itself.<br><br>This is a letter you&#39;re sending out, right? There&#39;s a few places where you seem to fly back and forth across the formality line. On one hand you sound professional, but you also say &quot;Screw you&quot; or use &#39;lolspeak&#39; like &quot;Plz to be noting&quot;, which doesn&#39;t really fit the tone. (I admit to having a personal grudge against &#39;lolspeak&#39;, and of course it depends on who, exactly, you&#39;re writing to, but consistency is a big part of presentation, and since you want to make a point, you probably shouldn&#39;t offer up alternate targets to be fired at by people who disagree.)<br><br>One definite error: <i>keep you at arms length</i> should be &quot;arm&#39;s&quot;.<br><br>Also, unless the discussion is already about the PPC, I&#39;d personally prefer if you didn&#39;t mention us. We&#39;re a small, hard-to-find community and generally seem to prefer to keep it that way. I don&#39;t think we cross the borderline you&#39;re talking about (we mock and curse the authors themselves, yes, but I don&#39;t think we jab at their personal lives, mainly because we don&#39;t know a thing about them), but why stir up trouble? Stick to mentioning MSTs, which everyone knows anyway.<br><br>But yes, overall, I agree with your point. I wouldn&#39;t call it &quot;trolling&quot; so much as &quot;outright rudeness&quot;, but that&#39;s just terminology. It&#39;s also just a matter of politeness and good taste, which are points/words you may want to mention at least in passing, as they&#39;ll strengthen your argument.<br><br>...And now I&#39;m going to shush and go to sleep, because it&#39;s too late at night for me to think straight. Good letter, in any case. Can I ask why you&#39;re writing it? (I haven&#39;t been to GAFF for about two years, so I&#39;m out of date.)</p>

            <p>Merry Yuletide everyone. It&#39;s a wonderful day to be at home with family(if you can stand them), presents, and your hot drink of choice--especially if you&#39;re on the east coastl ike me. Brrrrr!<br>So, to help everyone celebrate this holiday season, I have a wonderful Yuletide present for everyone from the Pit of Voles. It&#39;s guarenteed to make you laugh. Here&#39;s the link - <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/536905/1/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/536905/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/536905/1/</a></a>. It&#39;s a wonderful jab at all the writers who spawn that crap that produces the PPC missions, and as always, a wonderful present for any holiday.<br>Merry Yule everyone,<br>Honu_Wahine (*dances around with a sprig of misletoe, cackling madly*)</p>

            <p>I seem to be the opposite of Neshomeh. If I&#39;m introducing a new character, I&#39;ll mention one or two major features just to give everyone (including myself) a visual grounding - usually hair colour, but sometimes clothing or height if it can help build the character&#39;s personality. For instance, if I want to introduce a stuffy, arrogant aristocrat, I may write something like: <br><br><i>Walking down the hall was a man in a heavily-embroidered and obviously very expensive waistcoat,</i><br><br>- and then continue with the dialogue or narration that tells the events of the story. If it&#39;s not so important to set the character&#39;s look from the start, or if it&#39;s a character we already know and I want to casually mention what they&#39;re wearing, then I&#39;ll find a way to slip it in later in the scene, like I did here in a chapter from my <i>Wicked</i> fanfic: <br><br><i>“Oh… fine,” said Glinda, a little startled as she took off her cherry-red overcoat. “It all went fine, really; just took forever.</i><br><br>Of course, it depends on how you write in the first place. I try to weave my narrative and dialogue together with a rather steady pace and flow, so I&#39;ll insert dialogue tags in the place of commas, and if the speaker is making a rather extended pause, make that tag longer in order to convey the time in the reader&#39;s head - like the above example. If you write very little description otherwise, that method probably won&#39;t work. <br><br>Of course, that&#39;s only if you <i>want</i> to be unobtrusive. If you want to make a point out of it, you can have a sentence or two about their appearance, but never go beyond that - actually, keep it to one sentence, if you can. You can be a very visual writer without drowning us in details. <br><br>I suppose it also depends on what character&#39;s point of view the story is being written from. I usually write in a fairly distant style, but if your story is told through the eyes of, say, an artist, they&#39;ll notice much more detail than a lawyer, and you&#39;ll have more leeway to describe it without making your readers feel bored.<br><br>So... all you can do is try, I guess. Was that any help?</p>

            <p>What I do is focus on a few important details and leave the rest up to the reader&#39;s imagination. I almost always give basic eye and hair color with perhaps one adjective each, no more, but a lot of times you can just give the basic complexion, like swarthy or fair, and it&#39;s up to the reader to know that swarthy usually means dark eyes and dark hair, and that fair usually means a blue-eyed blond. I may offer the structure of a person&#39;s face if it&#39;s distinctive--square-jawed, round-faced, etc. I rarely if ever describe clothing unless it&#39;s important, as in a situation where the character is dressing for a certain effect or purpose, and then I&#39;ll stick to the one or two articles that specifically make the look. (Though if you have a particularly <a href="http://neshomeh.deviantart.com/art/Evarel-Starshade-the-Charmer-37764361">flamboyant</a> character, they tend to break those rules for you.) The trick is to chose your words very carefully, and pick the one that means exactly what you want instead of a whole bunch that dance around the point.<br><br>Another thing is that all the details don&#39;t have to be given right away if they don&#39;t fit in with the moment, for any character. You can string out the description in bits and pieces for as long as it takes to do it gracefully. If you win the readers over with the character&#39;s personality, they&#39;ll wait for the details.<br><br>I hope that helps. I feel like I&#39;m not being very clear, but so much of writing is subjective that it&#39;s hard.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Here is some Harry Potter BadFic. <br><br>Another chance with a human time turner, By Missuglychick: <br><br>What happens if a witch happens to have extra abilities sends Ginny, Hermione and herself back in time. Can they change Voldemort from killing Harry&#39;s parents? Only time will tell. GW/SB RL/OC JP/LE HG/SS <br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5606343/1/Another_chance_with_a_human_time_turner"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5606343/1/Another_chance_with_a_human_time_turner">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5606343/1/Another_chance_with_a_human_time_turner</a></a> <br><br>Comments: the first is a time-travel Fic, which as a science teacher and as a person of general logic I have a deep loathing for. Whether it is the COMPLETE lack of grammar, the idiotic names, Ron bashing, or simply pairing people for the sake of pairing, this is one that must die painfully. <br><br>Hairy Snotter and the Voldymort&#39;s Bone, By Alicecooperultimaterockpenguin: <br><br>J.K Roaring or whatever she is called didnt write the story properly. I am going to tell you the brutal and horrifying true story of what happened to Hairy Snotter. <br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5606528/1/Hairy_Snotter_and_the_Voldymorts_Bone"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5606528/1/Hairy_Snotter_and_the_Voldymorts_Bone">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5606528/1/Hairy_Snotter_and_the_Voldymorts_Bone</a></a> <br><br>Comments: The second one is attempted rewrite of the Harry Potter books and in the summary claims J.K. Rowling had it all wrong and THEY (Alicecooperulitmaterockpenguin) (no, really) have the real story. I might have let it pass if it had a parody tag but alas its tags are Tragedy/Horror. Granted it has only one chapter but it&#39;s pretty scary and not in a good way. <br><br>Harry Potter: Life in America, By GredForgeweasel: <br><br>It&#39;s Harry&#39;s first year at Hogwarts. He not only learns about magic, but he also finds out that he has a sister who is seven years older than him at Salem Academy of Magic and Arts. <br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5605516/1/Harry_Potter_Life_in_America"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5605516/1/Harry_Potter_Life_in_America">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5605516/1/Harry_Potter_Life_in_America</a></a> <br><br>Comments: Eh where to begin... well disregarding the fact that if Harry DID have a sister that was seven years older then him that Lily would have been pregnant at 13; That there would be not such thing as a wizards internet in 1991 as the Internet was released for muggles commercially in 1991 and that even then it wasn&#39;t very popular; That Katy Perry’s song &#39;Waking up in Vegas&#39; as released in 2009 NOT 1991; That the tri-wizard tournament was in Harry&#39;s fourth NOT first year; That there is no Salem Academy of Magic And Arts (mentioned canonically), And that Jailynna Lillian Snape is a blatant Mary-sue, there is absolutely nothing wrong what so ever. No siree bob.</p>

            <p>The third one was discontinued due to circumstances that forced the author to move suddenly and drop the Fic due to lack of time! However the plot that she had planned was terrible. If only all BadFics were dropped like that.</p>

            <p>*sigh* These look messy and a real knot to untangle. I think the second one maybe a troll fic, judging by the title and such. Or it&#39;s a parody, even without the tag. And the Sue? She must die. Painfully.</p>

            <p>Since the filking thread fell off the front page, I don&#39;t mind sharing this here. It&#39;s more of a story in poem-form than a song anyway.

The rhyme scheme is the same as the original poem, which was quite a challenge at times. For one thing, I&#39;m aware that &quot;merry&quot; and &quot;wary&quot; aren&#39;t necessarily a true rhyme. Maybe I&#39;ll think of something better later. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Excellent work. As much as I love Wicked, it&#39;s nice to see a happy ending for everyone, more or less. I almost wish this was how the story really went, but then, we wouldn&#39;t have a good muscial, would we?</p>

            <p>When Pads and I sporked LittlefootxCera, it wasn&#39;t finished. So we did one huuuuuuge mission up to the final posted chapter, and then as other chapters came out we sporked them individually. But I would only advocate this as a method for something where you can keep the hilarity going. If it&#39;s going to be boring, don&#39;t do it.<br><br>And the safest thing to do regarding authors is not to contact them, not to talk about them, not to do anything. We list their names with their fics on the wiki because they did write them and put their names to them, so we credit the author in that way. But we don&#39;t really want them to find out what we do with their work, because when you get right down to it, this is something we do for fun, not because we&#39;re internet police, or on some grand mission. And it&#39;ll hurt their feelings if they find out what we do. They&#39;re 99.9999% not bad people, just bad writers. Why spoil their day?<br></p>

            <p>In these cases, you need to look at how long it is since the fic was updated. If it&#39;s a year or more, it&#39;s probably safe to assume that the author has abandoned it and won&#39;t be coming back. </p>

            <p>You can PPC an incomplete fic. In most cases those missions would also end up with a dead Sue.<br><br>I don&#39;t think there is a point in going back into a fic if the author continues it, unless they explicitly resurrect the Sue you killed and their story becomes a critique of your mission, like your mission was a critique of their story. That could get confusing.<br><br>So, yes to your last question/suggestion.<br><br>And you don&#39;t tell the author to stop, you give them pointers how to improve their story. PPC-ers don&#39;t actually police the fandom. So, unlike the police, we can&#39;t tell authors whether or not they can or cannot continue down the road they are traveling on. </p>

            <p>But I also post my missions on FFnet which makes it more likely that someone stumbles across a mission than if I posted on LJ or on a private website. My message is:<br><br><i>Hi,<br><br>I&#39;m sending you this message to let you know that I&#39;ve written a spoof of INSERT TITLE.  The spoof is not meant as a personal attack on you as the author of this story, but if you have a strong attachment to the character of INSERT NAME OF <s>SUE</s> OC I suggest you don&#39;t read chapter CHAPTER NUMBER of INSERT TITLE OF APPROPRIATE PPC SERIAL.</i><br><br>I think that has gotten me three or four author reactions, and the most negative was &quot;Hey, you said your wrote a story about my story, but I don&#39;t see it&quot;. Because I also usually wait a few days for a reaction before I post the chapter.</p>

            <p>In general we <i>don&#39;t</i> tell them, because we write the missions for ourselves, not them. Also, more importantly, waving the mission under the writer&#39;s nose would probably just result in bad feeling and possibly ignite a flame war, which nobody wants.<br><br>On the other hand, if you know the writer would be a good sport about it, there&#39;s no reason not to tell them.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>
