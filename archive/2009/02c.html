            <p>(I should know, I&#39;ve sent the last three months betaing it.)<br><br>Ahem. Yes. Well done, KG. As I&#39;ve told you elsewhere, it&#39;s funny, and I particularly liked the Agent interaction. Marcus is great fun, with his &quot;seen it all, done it all,&quot; attitude. We need more veteran Agents. There&#39;s a few from before Crashing Down, but I can&#39;t think of any Agents that are currently active from Reorg-era and before.</p>

            <p>Hello from the Urplefilms Ltd. production team: Trojie, Cassie and our newest addition, KG.<br><br>We&#39;ve collected almost everyone&#39;s lines now (Ansela, Pads and Plat, yes, we ARE looking at you), so we&#39;re looking for people to start drawing pictures for us!<br><br>Before you all start complaining that we&#39;ve not given you any details, we&#39;ve decided to be incredibly generous and share the entire script with you. We&#39;re looking for environments such as RCs and other rooms, and character sketches. There are plenty of details to be found on the PPC wiki about characters, too.<br><br>Movie script - due to the sheer length of it, we&#39;ve split it into five documents.

            <p>I&#39;m somewhat busy, so it may be a few weeks before I get anything in in any case, but what would you say to images in... distinctly unrealistic styles? Specifically, that of <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/">The Order of the Stick</a>? I can do that pretty well, at least for fairly standard-shaped people (as opposed to, for instance, insectoids or multi-headed creatures), but I worry that it wouldn&#39;t fit with other submissions or the tone of specific sections.</p>

            <p>So if you have the inclination to do so, please feel free to send me pictures in that style.<br><br>As it stands, we have (off the top of my head) seven &#39;threads&#39; in which the action happens (each thread follows one set of characters), and we&#39;re hoping to keep the art in each thread as similar as possible, but each thread&#39;s style will be different to all of the others, because obviously we are going to have a large number of artists, all of whom will only have limited time etc for doing this, so we&#39;ll probably marry up artists with similar styles for each thread. The whole thing will either look like a) an artsy montage of styles or b) a mess, but ... well, let&#39;s hope for a), shall we? :)<br><br>Long story short, please do send me any artwork you do - there&#39;s nothing to say that one thread can&#39;t be that sort of artwork. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been wondering about starting a webcomic lately. On the other hand, I really want to be a published writer someday. If I did a webcomic and my online work got popular, would it be likely to have repercussions if I tried to get &quot;officially&quot; published? I ask because of the fanfic thing, since TM quit the PPC when she got some work published. Would it be &quot;safe&quot; if I used a pen-name for my &quot;real&quot; published work, or is that not necessary?</p>

            <p>Megatokyo does, Girl Genius does, Ctrl+Alt+Del does... And the books always sell pretty well. If you start a webcomic (which I plan to do one day soon too, actually) and then want to publish it later, it&#39;s fully possible. If you plan on publishing a totally different story than your webcomic, that&#39;s even simpler. As for using your real name, most webcomic artists do for ownership reasons. Like Adrian &quot;Adis&quot; Ramos, or Tim &quot;Absath&quot; Buckley. Of course, there are dangers to posting your real name online, but that&#39;s just something you have to decide on your own. If you end up publishing your work, people are going to know who you are and be able to connect your identities anyway. You could always create a pen-name for yourself and use that for your published work too (like you suggested). Heaven knows you wouldn&#39;t be the first writer to do that.<br><br>I can&#39;t think of any &quot;repercussions&quot; in that it might make it difficult to get something else published later on. Hell, it might even look good on your resume if it got popular.<br></p>

            <p>But then don&#39;t tell anyone else online? Like, don&#39;t post it publicly? Quite honestly, the internet is so huge that unless you make a point of telling people and they actually go out of their way to look for you, it&#39;s unlikely that other RL people are going to connect you to your fanfic. At least, that&#39;s what I think. Same with your webcomic, just don&#39;t link to your fanfic wherever you host your comic.</p>

            <p>Well, the problem with the PPC and ISBN publishing (digital books would also get ISBN) is that the PPC is fanfic based and fanfic has some copyright issues. I think that was the trouble TM wanted to avoid.<br><br>A webcomic isn&#39;t necessarily fanfic, so you could avoid the infringing someone else&#39;s copyright problem. I know of a few webcomics that are also published in albums that you can buy and put on a shelf. Usually with some &quot;not previously published on the Internet&quot; material to make them more interesting for purchasers.<br><br>Getting an on-line following might actually be a good jumping ground to becoming a published author. You may not be able to publish (with ISBN) what you had previously published on the internet, but that&#39;s because publishers like to have exclusive exploitation rights for a set period of time. You&#39;ll just have to write something for them that you haven&#39;t posted on the internet.<br><br>I guess the advice would be to keep your fanfic related stuff separated from the non-fanfic stuff. Though even if you did it would still be possible to link the two (they post from the same IP-address for instance). </p>

            <p>Much as I hate to think it, anyone who tried would probably have little difficulty linking out internet lives to our real names. I hate that.

            <p>In a thunderous crash, the front doors of the PPC headquarters flung open. The receptionist looked up.

What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I could tell you, but then I&#39;d have to kill you.&quot; He sounded smug.<br><br>The receptionist rolled her eyes, grabbed her phone and dialed a number.<br>&quot;Security? Could you please escort some asshole out of the lobby?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ooookay, I&#39;ll show you,&quot; the man said hurriedly. &quot;Here&#39;s my ID.&quot; He handed her his Canadian health insurance card.<br><br>&quot;Security, you still there? Forget it, that&#39;ll be alright,&quot; the receptionist said in the speaker. She took the man&#39;s card and examined it. A smirk formed on her lips. &quot;THAT&#39;s your name? Calvin Percival Baudette?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shhh, not so loud,&quot; the young man whispered, wincing. &quot;I prefer to be called Cal.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...Yeah, that&#39;s... understandable,&quot; she agreed, visibly making tremendous efforts not to laugh. &quot;So what&#39;s your background and experience, Cal?&quot;<br><br>Cal made a halfway decent attempt at a cold, businesslike tone.<br>&quot;I&#39;ve served for six years in the FBI, two years in the CIA and one very long day at CTU Los Angeles. I&#39;ve been decorated for my involvement in the Gulf War, where I led a squadron of six F-16&#39;s. I have a degree in computer science and another in engineering, and I—&quot;<br><br>&quot;According to your ID, you&#39;re only twenty,&quot; she interrupted.<br><br>&quot;...Oh yeah, that. Ah, um... Well, it&#39;s a long story but—&quot;<br><br>She rapped impatiently on her desk.<br>&quot;Just say it. No experience?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No experience,&quot; Cal confessed reluctantly. &quot;But I&#39;m adaptable, I promise.&quot;<br><br>The receptionist&#39;s gaze went to the man&#39;s eyepatch.<br>&quot;List your disabilities,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;I have no disa— oh, the eyepatch? I don&#39;t need it, really, both my eyes are fine. But it DOES make me look totally badass, don&#39;t you think?&quot; He removed it and stuffed it in one of his pockets.<br><br>&quot;Fill out these forms,&quot; the receptionist said with mild annoyance, handing Cal a thick pile of variously colored papers. &quot;Then bring them to the human resources office, if you can find it. They&#39;re so desperate for personnel that even you might stand a chance of getting hired.&quot;<br><br><br>__________________________________________<br><br><br><br>Hey all. My name is Gabriel (age 20), and I live in Canada (province of Quйbec).  I recently discovered the Protectors of the Plot Continuum, and to me it already looks awesome — I love metafiction.  As I type this I have read only four stories out of the Original Series&#39; twenty-five, but I already get the idea and I cannot wait to begin.  I hope to be able to write my own missions in a few weeks at the most.  For this I have created Agent Cal, an incompetent and overenthusiastic young agent who takes himself VERY seriously (maybe I will give him a sidekick later). I will operate mainly in Middle-Earth, the Potterverse and the Caribbean, since those three settings are plagued by mind-boggling amounts of badfic and an infestation of Mary Sues, but I will not limit myself to those if I find a bad enough fic in another fandom with which I am familiar.<br><br>Feedback on my writing would be greatly appreciated: I do not want to disgrace the great work started by Jay and Acacia.  Note however that my English is not perfect (my first language is French), so be tolerant.<br><br>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Okay, I know I have a long way to go before receiving the green light: I have read only a small part of the Original Series and I joined the forum only two days ago. But as I said, Agent Cal is very enthusiastic about his job. He has little patience and a short attention span, and he holds a very high opinion of himself and his capabilities. But in truth, it&#39;s mostly me who just can&#39;t wait before starting.<br><br>Since I don&#39;t have the authorization to post official PPC missions, consider this as nothing more than a practice, not an actual mission. Please tell me how to improve.<br><br>The following, an assassination operation, is based on this badfic. Only the first page is important.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2165630/1/Black_Rose_of_the_Sea"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2165630/1/Black_Rose_of_the_Sea">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2165630/1/Black_Rose_of_the_Sea</a></a><br><br><br>__________________________________________________________<br><br><br><br>Cal was busy putting wallpaper in his brand-new office in the PPC headquarters when the console on his desk emitted a strident BEEEEP. A badfic with a particularly blatant Mary Sue had just been detected in the Potterverse, as the young agent saw when he looked at the screen. (Technically, Cal was not yet an agent, but &quot;Agent Cal&quot; just sounded cool.)<br><br>He wondered what to do about it. He had joined the PPC no more than a few days ago and had only begun his training yesterday. He had not even read the full 300-page protocol and all the old mission reports, and though he understood the basics well enough, he was strictly forbidden from going on an operation (let alone a solo operation) until he was ready. If he went, he could get fired before even becoming an agent. On the other hand, everyone knew that nearly all secret agents, cops and detectives routinely had to act against their superiors&#39; orders to solve a case or stop an atomic bomb. If Cal wanted to be taken seriously as a PPC agent, he was expected to Go Rogue at least once; the sooner the better.<br><br>Eagerly, he went to his wardrobe and put on his grey trenchcoat and fedora. Anyone with a fedora, be he a gangster, an investigator or an archaeologist, obviously meant business. In the huge mirror he had recently installed, Cal saw that he looked every bit the sexy badass he fancied himself as. But something was missing... Ah, yes, the eyepatch or sunglasses. Which looks the most hardcore? He tried both at the same time, but it was slightly uncomfortable (not to mention silly-looking). In the end he settled for the eyepatch: it suited much better to his pulp detective style. He would keep the sunglasses for Sundays, when he wore his MiB suit and tie.<br><br>With the console, Cal generated a portal to the Potterverse, where a Sue may already have started her vile work to destroy the fragile continuum of J. K. Rowling&#39;s fifth and best novel. According to the report, this Sue who went by the name of Marina Rose Black was the daughter of Voldemort and the adoptive heir of the Black family.<br><br>Stepping into the portal, Agent Cal emerged in a dusty and dimly-lit place that looked like the living room of an old house. He was alone here, and it appeared to be the middle of the night. On a wall was the family tree of the Blacks. He was at Grimmauld Place, then. There was probably no better place to meet someone who called herself the heir of the Black family. Cal tried to find the best spot in the room to hear and see what was going on.<br><br>Suddenly he felt something creep along his neck. With a muffled cry of disgust, he threw to the ground a small hairy creature with very sharp teeth that had somehow managed to get under the collar of his trenchcoat when he inadvertently got too close from the doxy-infested curtains. Nasty vermin: if he remembered correctly, doxys were venomous.<br><br>After a minute of silent waiting, he distinctly heard the front door of the house creak open not too far from there. The song-like voice of the Mary Sue resounded in the corridor:<br>&quot;Baba! Kreacher! I&#39;m home.&quot;<br><br>The old house elf and the painting of Sirius&#39; mother responded immediately, greeting Marina Rose Black warmly. The fifteen-year-old Sue, coming back from her vacation at the beach, acted as if she owned the place — and indeed, she did. For some reason, none of the sleeping members of the Order of the Phoenix heard her noisy entrance. She went upstairs and remained out of Cal&#39;s earshot for a long while. All of a sudden, angry shouts came from the second floor: Sirius Black had finally met her, and they were having a heated argument about whose house this was. A few minutes later, Molly Weasley&#39;s voice was defending Sue against Sirius&#39; understandable burst of rage. The shouts eventually ceased.<br><br>Some time later, Molly and Sirius walked down the stairs and entered the living room. The young PPC agent hid behind a couch, wearing his fedora very low as if it could make him harder to see. Marina soon came into the room and attempted to explain her presence here to the two canon characters. Before long, Albus Dumbledore&#39;s head conveniently appeared in the fireplace to tell Sirius and Molly that the house did indeed belong to Her Sueness. As Agent Cal crept closer, he heard the headmaster of Hogwarts say something that made him feel like he had just swallowed broken glass:<br><br>&quot;...she will be the one who decides the end of the great war, it is all placed in her hands and I&#39;d rather keep her here and safe before we have to allow her near the dark.&quot;<br><br>Cal almost groaned aloud. What is wrong with Harry, anyway, that makes suethors think he is unworthy to be the one who defeats Voldemort? Trembling with outrage, he waited for everyone to leave the room and go to sleep. <br><br>Half an hour later, the ancestral home of the Blacks was silent again. Moving like a shadow, Agent Cal went in search of Sue&#39;s bedroom. When he found it, he quietly closed the door behind him — there was enough moonlight to see everything. Marina Rose Black was sound asleep in her bed, her blue-black hair framing her somewhat Asian features. First step: master her, so he can tell her the list of her crimes against canon before dealing with her. Cal took off his fedora and pressed it on Sue&#39;s face to smother her. She thrashed wildly — that is, until the young agent sat on her body to keep her immobile. With a wince, he heard two of her ribs crack noisily under his weight. After a minute Marina stopped moving, unconscious.<br><br>Cal firmly tied the girl to her bed and stuffed a piece of cloth into her mouth to keep her silent. Then he woke her up by poking the broken ribs with a finger. The Mary Sue&#39;s eyes flew open to stare at him with surprise and terror.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m Agent Cal,&quot; he said, taking on a menacing voice that was perhaps a little too theatrical, as he showed her his membership card of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons club (he did not have his PPC card yet). &quot;You must have heard of me?&quot; The Sue shook her head. Cal was a bit disappointed. He went on solemnly: &quot;In the name of the Protectors of the Plot Continuum, I charge you with disrupting the canon, interfering with the character of Dumbledore and being a Mary Sue. As jury, judge and executioner, I declare you guilty and hereby sentence you to death. Execution is to take place immediately.&quot;<br>Cal&#39;s gloved hand slipped into one of the bottomless pockets of his trenchcoat.<br>&quot;I have good news and bad news. The good news is that, as a typical pulp hero, I can&#39;t hit a girl.&quot; His tone then became apologetic: &quot;The bad news is that I am quite resourceful.&quot;<br><br>He pulled from his pocket four large doxys he had found in the curtains. While the Mary Sue writhed helplessly against her bonds, he put one doxy on her face, one on her throat, one on her chest and one under her pants. With clinical detachment, he watched her squirm and emit muffled cries for nearly ten minutes before she finally succumbed to over thirty vicious bites on every part of her body. Her dead eyes stared at the ceiling in mute horror.<br><br>Satisfied, Cal untied the twisted corpse and dragged it to the kitchen downstairs. With some difficulty, he somehow succeeded in stuffing it into the pantry, though he had to make extensive use of the bone saw lying on the table. Since Marina did not have much meat on her, Kreacher would probably manage to get rid of her body in only a few stews or roasts. His task done, Agent Cal opened another portal and quit the now much cleaner Potterverse.<br><br>.</p>

            <p>By now, Cal was surrounded by a small crowd of people, who all seemed rather happy to see him. Some of them, however, were making the expressions of dismay common to those who have encountered a short person with bony elbows and a vicious mindset. Mad Maudlin (for it was indeed she) pushed Makari aside and stood in front of Cal, looking him up and down- although the heavy eyeliner made it hard to tell exactly where she was looking. She grinned slowly. &quot;Nice hat. Welcome...to the <i>PPC!</i>&quot; This was accompanied by a menacing laugh. She continued, &quot;I&#39;m Maudlin Hart, although you can call me Mad Maudlin, or just Maudlin. Anything else will result in <i>pain</i>. Please, deposit your sanity in the provided bucket; I assure you it will not be needed here.&quot;<br>Cal looked at the bucket. It was blue, and the words &quot;Warg Fodder&quot; were written on the side. He could understand why this person was called mad. &quot;I-&quot;<br>&quot;DID I TELL YOU TO SPEAK?&quot; Maudlin shrieked. &quot;I don&#39;t think so! But you can speak anyway. And here is some chai tea, and here is a shiny crystal thing, and here is some Suenicorn jerky, and they are all for you!&quot; She handed Cal these items, then bowed low and disappeared into the crowd. <br><i>What a strange person,</i> Cal thought.<br></p>

            <p>Cal stuffed the various gifts in the bottomless pockets of his trenchcoat. He turned his attention to the bucket, and for a moment he wondered how the heck he was supposed to deposit his sanity in it. After some thought, he realized that wondering this was a sure sign that he was still sane, and thus that he needed to get rid of his sanity — a thing he did not know how to do. But conversely, if he understood just HOW to do it, then he would certainly be insane — but then he would not need to deposit his sanity in the bucket. Thus, he was faced with a paradox. But, if he were insane, he could choose to ignore the paradox and deposit his sanity in the bucket ANYWAY. This led to a second paradox, since he was not insane and as a result did not know how to get over paradoxes. But if he were insane...<br><br>*Bzzzrt*<br><br>A few millions of his neurons suddenly went dead under the strain. When Cal regained his senses after a brief blackout, he found that he now understood how to deposit his sanity in the bucket, and promptly did. There was not a lot of it — the Wargs would still be hungry. But there would always be plenty of Mary Sues for them to eat.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m currently writing a potential mission.  However, there are a few issues that neither TOS nor the Wiki seem to clarify <i>quite</i> to my satisfaction:<br><br>1) Does the D.O.R.K.S. supplement or replace the Disguise Generator?<br>2) Based on what I&#39;ve seen, I take it that both of the above gadgets implement actual shape-shifts rather than just illusory disguises.  Confirmation?<br>3) If agents have to kill a demon!Sue, are there any tactics/weapons that are especially effective against such a foe?  (It&#39;s a relatively weak demon—just big, loud, and inclined to kick.)</p>

            <p>1) From what I&#39;ve heard, the DORKS enables you to change your disguise while still in the fic. Otherwise, you&#39;re stuck as an Orc or whatever for the whole mission. I may be wrong, though.<br>2) <i>Ja, fraulein</i>. In TOS, Jay and Acacia got the actual thorns and branches and eighteen-feet-tallness when they used Entwife disguises.<br>3) Demons. Hmmm.

            <p>Yeah, blood elf disguise (and one of the agents—who, ironically, is stated to <i>play</i> blood elves in WoW—grumbles about it).  There&#39;s a scene in the story where all three objectives are in the same place at the same time, and killing the Eredar!Sam would also make the Sue&#39;s survival unlikely.<br><br>The Eredar!Sam doesn&#39;t seem to have the good sense to cast spells (in the final battle, his solution seems to be just to increase his size and <i>kick</i> the Vindicator!Sam a few times) until the last moment (when he puts some kind of curse on the Sue that blinds her and makes her cry oh-so-dramatic bloody tears).</p>

            <p>I&#39;m thinking the Vindicator!Sam dies first.  <br><br>The Sue idiotically jumps into the middle of the fray (ROFL at melee clothie) and gets separated from the group.  (A blood elf shoots her in the back with a poisoned arrow; however, the eredar takes a shine to her and heals her.)<br><br>This leaves the Vindicator!Sam (who doesn&#39;t have the good sense to heal himself) with no direct backup.  At least one agent has a crossbow (it&#39;s a canon weapon) with some power to it; the Vindicator!Sam is in chainmail, which (IIRC) is <i>not</i> great at stopping bolts.  I thought that <i>one</i> agent who&#39;s a good shot might be sufficient here; however, I&#39;m beginning to think that one can&#39;t be too careful.<br><br>The Vindicator!Sam uses a sword, not a hammer.  Its quality is not specified.<br><br>By this point, the Sue has been shot, and staggers into the area where the Eredar!Sam is.  The Eredar!Sam is currently <i>seventy freakin&#39; feet tall</i>.  In the actual Suefic, he somehow hypnotizes the blood elf who had the good sense to shoot the Sue (one of the <i>two</i> times in the story that he seems to use any offensive magic at all) then  <i>steps on him</i>, heals the Sue in a way that leaves them magically linked, and vanishes.  <br><br>I&#39;m thinking the agents need to stop the Eredar!Sam before he can heal the Sue...while avoiding getting stomped on themselves.  But, as you see, I don&#39;t tag him as an Eredar!Sam lightly.  (In the initial MST, it was joked that he could only be beaten by someone who out-Sammed him...such as the Vindicator!Sam.  And it probably wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to leave <i>him</i> alive that long.)<br><br>My best bet is probably to somehow drop him through a portal—preferably one that leads to other demons.  I don&#39;t think the Burning Legion takes any too kindly to their junior officers becoming infatuated with airplane-headed Anchorite!Sues.<br><br>And...two more silly questions:<br>1) If a Suespawn is conceived in the story, and the author has created a time paradox that gives the Suespawn <i>more</i> than enough time to gestate...what are the odds of the Suespawn being spontaneously generated?  Or has the situation simply never come up before?<br>2) If an author&#39;s skill at setting a scene is such that readers sometimes wonder where, exactly, the characters are...what would this mean for the mission?  My thought was that the agents&#39; surroundings would be blurry and warped, and that there would be urple fog.</p>

            <p>With that in mind...arcane torrent alone probably wouldn&#39;t dispel the size increase (as I mentioned, he&#39;s seventy feet tall by the time they get there).  <br><br>Now, they <i>could</i> just drop him through a portal as planned (need a big one).  But I&#39;m guessing one <i>should</i> still charge even demon!Sues before killing them.  And the pre-existing size increase makes it a bit difficult <i>to</i> charge him without getting swatted like flies, or ensure that the other demons to whom he&#39;s being turned over know just <i>why</i> he&#39;s been a naughty boy.  (Thinking someone writes &quot;DRAENEI-LOVER!&quot; on him with a permanent marker.)<br><br>Then, we have the Anchorite!Sue.  Several solutions will be suggested (including turning her over to the Auchenai or to a <i>less</i> affable man&#39;ari eredar) but all will be rejected on the suspicion that she&#39;d somehow either win them over or just <i>supplant</i> them.  As it is, I have two possibilities for her final fate.  Still balancing them in my mind.</p>

            <p>How exactly would two Agent pairs deal with the kidnapping of two heads of state, the entire fleets of two factions from a different universe appearing in orbit around Whoniverse Earth, and the ROTS era Sith and Jedi Masters running around the planet? Oh, and rebel troops are occupying New York...<br><br>We&#39;ve narrowed it down to three or four main options, listed in decreasing advisability:<br><br>1)Persuade the Imp fleet to follow our orders through the use of the EU recognition codes and tow them with a PPC issue TARDIS on loan because of the above.<br><br>2)The same, except a modified Doctor&#39;s TARDIS is substituted for the PPC issue one. Rather pointless when you&#39;re practically replacing the TARDIS with DoSAT tech...<br><br>3)Use the Little Doctor on both fleets. Hope they respawn in the right universe.<br><br>4)Get yet another fleet from a different universe/the Whoniverse and use it to persuade the two SW fleets to cooperate. Most of the choices are either too weak (Star Trek/Haloverse) or untrustworthy (Dalek flying saucers/Warhammer 40k Chaos).<br><br>The fic is here: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4562700/1/The_Earths_Greatest_Battle"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4562700/1/The_Earths_Greatest_Battle">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4562700/1/The_Earths_Greatest_Battle</a></a></p>

            <p>Portal-wise, the City of Heroes Universe has the Rikti, essentially evolved humans, who were able to make portals of essentially any size appear wherever they wanted, required a large power source, but hey, we have that in the Department of Dead Author Electricity Generation.<br>Superweapons, on the other hand, might be a little harder, especially on a scale that large. In your shoes, I&#39;d probably actually delve into a Goodfic and see if they have something that might help you. Permission from the author, obviously.<br><br>Or, as an alternative, use something that both / all groups are completely unused to. In this case, magic. If you&#39;re after a group that would know what was going on (From the PPC point of view), I&#39;d recommend the Crest Holders from &#39;Worlds Apart&#39;, by Articunomew. They&#39;re powerful enough to actually fight a fleet that big if need be, but would be able to send them back to their correct Universes if that&#39;s the choice you want as well.</p>

Sweet! Just out of curiosity, why limited to Tortall? I&#39;ve always preferred the Circle books, myself. My agents welcome you, as do I!

As an aside, have you heard of <a href="http://www.steelsings.com/forum">Steelsings?</a> It&#39;s a fairly good roleplay (or at least it used to be, I don&#39;t know how true that is now), and you meet a lot of cool people.<br><br>Anyway, welcome to the Board!
