            <p>It&#39;s been six -seven years since I joined the PPC. Though I have faded into the background of the workings and don&#39;t know any of you lot, I still consider myself a member. <br><br>A lot has seriously changed. It just used to be Lord of the Rings and now, now we&#39;ve got everything and a banana thrown in.  <br><br>I feel old and out of place, but I am pleased to see the lit torches of mad villagers storming the castle still around. <br><br>~Alec Troven</p>

            <p>So, we got chatting just before the post about the Macrovirus memorial post Cassie made a few weeks back, and we were wondering if anyone would be interested in doing an RP for a memorial service/party type thing for the Invasion.<br><br>Considering the fact that it comemmorates not only the LMSF being beaten off, but is also a memorial service for the Agents who died in the macrovirus during the month prior to the invasion, we thought that it might be hosted by one of the Flowers, or possibly a veteran Agent of some type.<br><br>We&#39;re basically wondering if anyone would be interested, and we&#39;re looking for ideas about where it&#39;d be, who&#39;d be in charge, what the attractions/events should be, and the like.</p>

Foxglove Sue shook her pretty ringlets and giggled, kneeling on top of the stunned Drake&#39;s chest and holding a delicately wrought knife to his throat.

            <p>Sue Laburnum sneered and stepped forward, complicated-looking half-sword-half-axe blade at the ready and black leather clothing gleaming. Naomi surveyed her opponent, looking for an opening.

Maybe she could use the Sue&#39;s awkward weight distribution to her advantage ...<br><br>A yell echoed down the corridor and Stormsong ran past, screaming &quot;SKYFIRE! MOLLY! HELP!&quot;, pursued by a glimmering silver-furred weasel with a black rose in one paw and several very nasty-looking knives in his belt. Stormsong&#39;s shirt was torn, and the Stu-weasel&#39;s belt was undone. Naomi&#39;s subconscious filed this information away while the rest of her brain was occupied with fending off Laburnum Sue and started coming up with smart-aleck comments for future reference.</p>

            <p>Stormsong stepped outside the response centre and took the knives from the squishy pile of weasel-Stu. &quot;Trust me, thou wilt meet her soon. Just follow the trail of carnage and ferret urine. I swear, we <i>tried</i> to housebreak her ...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um, do you know you&#39;re robbing a corpse?&quot; Laburnum asked, wrenching her axe free and rolling the Sue over to get the jacket. &quot;Not that I&#39;m objecting as such, it just seems unusual coming from you specifically.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aye - best time.&quot; The weasel plucked a particularly impressive barbed blade from the corpse&#39;s belt and examined it. &quot;After what it did, I feel it owed me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Y&#39;know, sometimes I forget you were raised among vermin, and then you say something like that.&quot; Laburnum tugged on the jacket and shook Luke and Jessie&#39;s hands. &quot;Hi. Yeah, we should stick together ... we should go check and see if Skyfire&#39;s okay first, but then we&#39;ve just got yours and Naomi and Drake&#39;s to deal with, and I think we can take them together.&quot;<br><br>Foxglove examined the dead Stu, took a crossbow bolt from her quiver, broke off the point, and drove it into the bullet-hole nearest to the heart. The real Stormsong gave her a very strange look.<br><br>&quot;What? He looked kinda vampiric.&quot;</p>

            <p>Jessie shook her head at Stormsong&#39;s brief description of Molly. &quot;And no, we&#39;re not new. I&#39;ve been here since 2001, and Luke-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I joined back in 1998,&quot; Luke said with another grin. For some reason he was in a rather good mood.

Jessie and I haven&#39;t run into our copies yet, though we killed one that looked remarkably like a friend of ours earlier.&quot;<br><br>Heading out into the corridor, he chuckled when Foxglove stabbed the dead Stu. &quot;Hey, trust me, he&#39;s dead. Once I kill something, it doesn&#39;t come back.&quot; He rubbed at his eyepatch absently, looking up and down the corridor for enemies.<br><br>Jessie stamped on his foot as she passed him, ignoring his yelp of pain. &quot;Ignore him, he&#39;s just got an ego the size of HQ.&quot; She jumped as the wall of the room they&#39;d just left crashed inwards to reveal an urple copy of the fox guy, whose name she hadn&#39;t caught. &quot;Um... should I - oh, looks like he&#39;s dealing with it. Never mind.&quot;</p>

            <p>There was a loud boom and most of the urple fox disappeared, along with a large chunk of the wall. Drake was propelled backwards into the opposite wall, and when the dust cleared he was sitting in the dent his back had left in it, clutching his railgun so hard his knuckles were white under the fur.<br><br>Laburnum looked at Jessie. &quot;Yeah, so that&#39;s Drake.

Yeah.&quot; Cassie turned round from the cupboard where the weapons were kept. &quot;I thought it was some April Fool&#39;s Day joke when I went to look it up, but now it looks like there&#39;s an actual invasion or something.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Didn&#39;t we &#39;ave enough o&#39; that <i>last</i> year?&quot; the lanky girl complained, sitting on the edge of her bed for a moment before what Cassie had said sank in. &quot;What?&quot; She jumped up and grabbed her own weapons. &quot;Come on then!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is that really such a good idea?&quot; said the third occupant of the room, who up till then had been silent. Kelvin shifted nervously as both women glared at him. &quot;Um, we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, is all...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then we need to go and find out,&quot; Cassie replied. &quot;Come on, grab your stuff.&quot; She glanced over to the minis&#39; bed, but neither of them were in the RC. <i>Ah, well. Guess they can take care of themselves better than we could.</i><br><br>A random pair of EPC Agents got the surprise of their lives - and deaths - a minute later when three PPCers burst out of the room next to them.<br><br>&quot;That wasn&#39;t so bad,&quot; Nat said as she wiped off her sword. &quot;More Sues. They should be easy enough ta deal with.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wait a moment.&quot; Kelvin was examining one of the bodies. &quot;This looks like our flashpatch, except for the sword.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No kidding...&quot; Cassie looked around at the now-unfamiliar black corridors. &quot;I really don&#39;t like this. Let&#39;s try and find someone else. Maybe they&#39;ll know what&#39;s going on.&quot;<br><br>There was total agreement from the other two, and the trio set off warily down the corridor, keeping a close lookout for more trouble.<br><br>Of course, rounding the next corner to come face to face with a large group of Sueish-looking people would probably have counted as more trouble.<br><br>&quot;RUN!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now what?&quot; Kelvin asked as they tried to outrun the gang.<br><br>&quot;We run an&#39; find &#39;elp!&quot;</p>

Despatch is currently readying a list of the most flagrant goodf-</i>&quot; Marcus, well and truly fed up with hearing that same announcement over and over, turned around and blasted the P.A. without a second thought, casually reloading his Mossberg afterwards, as if oblivious to the shower of sparks. A matter of seconds ago, they had been standing right in front of almost thirty EPCers. Now, all that was left of that group was the mass of bloody chunks that had been left by the sheer firepower he and Zodfang brought to bear and which they were now standing in.<br><br>  &quot;Haha, wuz wunderin&#39; when ya&#39;d shuddit up, &#39;Oomie.&quot; The Ork said, letting out a hearty laugh as he hefted the massive heavy bolter with ease. The weapon had laid pretty much anything Zodfang pointed it at to waste, clearing entire corridors of EPCers with ease and destroying most other things it hit as well. This served their purposes nicely, as could be expected of a machine gun that used rocket propelled grenades for ammunition. <br><br>  Currently, they were on their way to DoDAEG to prevent the Enforces from cutting off power in HQ, but along the way they had been seeking out and destroying as much of the EPC&#39;s stuff as they could, especially the Sueification stations. The black of their uniforms could barely be seen for all the EPCer blood drenching them. They had been travelling with a fairly large group to head to DoDAEG, but had got separated from them in the fighting.<br><br>  &quot;What can I say, I don&#39;t like being told stuff I already know.&quot; Marcus said, shrugging as he made sure there was a shell in the chamber. &quot;I wonder what happened to Troy&#39;s guys, we need to meet up with them again.&quot;<br><br>  Before their banter could continue, they heard a great deal of commotion in a nearby corridor. Even in a situation like this, they couldn&#39;t get a break, it seemed. Nodding to each other, they walked side by side towards the source of the noise, keeping their guns at the ready. When they finally rounded the corner, they were standing behind a throng of at least twenty Enforcers, each charging towards people they couldn&#39;t see.<br><br>  Marcus reacted first, depressing the Mossberg 500&#39;s trigger in a smooth motion and immediately re-cocking the weapon to bring another shell into the chamber. Not one to miss a beat, Zodfang brought his heavy bolter to bear.<br><br>  &quot;<b>WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!</b>&quot;<br><br>  The thundering noise of the bolter drowned out even Marcus&#39; shotgun blasts as EPC agents started to be blown apart even as they turned to face whatever was annihilating their unguarded rear flank. A couple got off some potshots, but they went wild as the Enforcers firing them got reduced to a gorey slush.<br><br>  The cavalry had most certainly arrived.</p>

            <p>&quot;Thank you!&quot; Kelvin ducked an attack from somebody else as his counterpart fell to the floor, then pushed Sedri out of the fighting. &quot;You&#39;re hurt, stay back!&quot; He plunged back in to join his partners.<br><br>Cassie had managed to get herself stuck, back to the wall, trying to fend off about four people at once. She couldn&#39;t help but notice that her partners were trying to reach her, but were being hampered by the other fourteen or so... Agents. If they even were. Why the hell would Agents be attacking each other?<br><br>Someone&#39;s boot connected with her knee and she fell. Before she could move, another person stood on her sword blade, preventing her from using it. <i>Oh, crap.</i> She threw her free arm up as a last-ditch defence against attacks from above.<br><br>Nat saw her friend go down and redoubled her efforts to reach her. This was made easier when Kelvin joined her, but one of the attackers still managed to get in a lucky slash at her left arm. She yelled in pain, but the sound was drowned out by a gunshot and a primal bellow she definitely recognised.<br><br>Kelvin, being the tallest, was the first to notice the massive-gun-wielding Ork coming up the passageway. His eyes widened and he dived to the floor, dragging Nat with him just in time.<br><br>Once the (metaphorical) dust had settled, everyone looked up. Cassie managed a grin at the two newcomers. &quot;Fantastic timing, guys.&quot;</p>

            <p>The entire corridor was cleared of Enforcers in maybe eight seconds, the bloody mess on the floor and walls again all that was left, aside from a couple of intact corpses. Some shots had missed, and the explosions of those bolter shells left sizeable holes in the walls and floor. Overall, it was a strong reminder to Marcus of why exactly he never let Zodfang bring his heavy bolter on missions, it was just plain <i>overkill</i>. Smirking, Marcus started to walk forward once the shooting stopped, looking around in the hopes of seeing whatever Agents had been in trouble.<br><br><i>I hope Zodfang didn&#39;t accidentally shoot them,</i> he thought, kicking aside what was left of an Enforcer&#39;s torso as Cassie spoke up. Sighing in relief, he grinned back at the group of Agents on the ground, kneeling down and offering a hand to help Cassie up. It had been a little while since he&#39;d last seen her, but these weren&#39;t the circumstances he&#39;d had in mind of running into that little group again.<br><br>  &quot;Glad we were able to get here on time,&quot; he said. &quot;We were just heading down to DoDAEG. Anyone severely wounded?&quot; </p>

            <p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said, accepting his help to get to her feet and looking around at the mess. &quot;This&#39;s pretty impressive.&quot;<br><br>Kelvin stood up himself and wiped off his sword before sheathing it. &quot;I&#39;m all right, thank you, but Nat and Sedri-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; Nat climbed to her feet, one hand over the gash in her arm. &quot;It&#39;s nothin&#39; ta worry about.&quot; She eyed Zodfang&#39;s weapon with interest.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re hurt,&quot; Kelvin insisted, gesturing at the sizeable cut. Her t-shirt sleeve was already wet with blood, but it wasn&#39;t exactly pumping out.<br><br>&quot;Bugger that,&quot; was the only response as the lanky girl picked up her sword and turned to Marcus. &quot;What&#39;s DoDAEG an&#39; ow do we get there?&quot;<br><br>Cassie just rolled her eyes and limped over to Sedri, her knee throbbing from where it had been kicked. &quot;How are you?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we get you down to Medical? That cut looks pretty bad.&quot; He continued, walking up to her to examine the gash. Zodfang had given her a &quot;back off&quot; type look when she started eyeing his gun, but was now just standing around looking rather agitated. Either that or bored, at least.<br><br>  &quot;C&#39;mon, &#39;Oomie! We&#39;z gonna miss da fightin&#39;! Dis is a propa WAAAGH! in &#39;ere!&quot; He said, continually looking around as if hoping some Enforcer would pop their head out for him to shoot. Sighing, Marcus shook his head.<br><br>  &quot;The fighting&#39;s still going to be there if you wait, I want to make sure they&#39;re not too hurt.&quot; Marcus explained, trying to take another look at the wound. &quot;Anyway, DoDAEG is the Department of Dead Author Electricity Generation. I was thinking they might try to cut off HQ&#39;s power to hamstring our defenses, so we were heading there to make sure they didn&#39;t try it.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;I told you you shouldn&#39;t be out,&quot; one said, sounding somewhat exasperated and female.  &quot;If that last one hadn&#39;t falling for the old &#39;behind you!&#39; trick-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, and what if Nick got hurt?

It still worked, so she wasn&#39;t going to make a fuss.<br><br>Kelvin moved up beside her, one hand on his sword hilt. &quot;We&#39;re PPC,&quot; he explained to the newcomers, glancing over to Marcus and Zodfang for backup just in case these people were the enemy.<br><br>&quot;Oh, for heavens&#39; sake,&quot; Cassie interrupted, coming over to join the others as Sedri headed off to get herself seen to. &quot;They&#39;re on our side, Nat, we met them a few months back.

            <p>&quot;Sorry, it&#39;s a bit hard not to be jumpy when we&#39;re fighting people who look almost exactly like us.&quot; Marcus said, nodding apologetically to the newcomers. Zodfang merely grunted, keeping a distrustful eye on them as Marcus brought his attention to Cass.<br><br>  &quot;Ya shuldn&#39;t sneek up&#39;n us like dat, &#39;oomies,&quot; Zodfang said to the newcomers. &quot;Coulda shot ya.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s right. Anyway, Cass, I figured that with this invasion going on, the first thing the enemy would do to try to weaken HQ&#39;s defenses is turn off the power. We can&#39;t fight if we can&#39;t see, right? If they disabled the power, it&#39;d give them a big advantage, so I figured they&#39;d go for Upstairs and DoDAEG first. We were coming back from some fighting in Operations when we passed through here.&quot;</p>

            <p>...just not Good good. They obviously knew what they were doing, and Sedri had two long, bloody gashes in her arm before Kelvin&#39;s double was finished. Kelvin had, by then, joined Nat in trying to keep Cassie alive, and somebody had resorted to pulling hair.<br><br>&quot;Ow!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Very mature,&quot; grumbled Sedri, who was next to useless now, and just watched as the three other agents dispatched their opponants.</p>

            <p>&quot;Die, Agent dog, di-&quot;<br><br>The ridiculously muscular young man&#39;s voice abruptly cut off as Drental grabbed him by the throat and closed her crushgaunt-covered fist. His neck gave way with a loud crunch, and he fell limp. That left the other two EPC patrollers, both of whom had instantly moved to attack the Agent. One appeared to be a cyborg wearing some kind of gold body armour and the other was a pointy-eared elf holding a glowing sword. <br><br>Drental sighed and dropped to one knee as the elf swung her sword in an arc towards the Mandalorian Agent&#39;s head. The blade hissed through the air inches above her helmet, clipping its antenna as it passed above it. Drental brought her blaster pistol up to waist height, aimed, and squeezed the trigger...<br><br>only to see her shot go wild and then herself fly into a wall as the elf made a subtle hand gesture.<br><br><i>Fierfek, not a Jedi Elf.</i> Drental thought.<br><br>Drental suddenly found herself being bodily lifted off the ground and shoved into the wall. A loudspeaker cracked under the pressure as the gold SPARTAN held the struggling Agent against the wall. He then began tightening his grip and Drental started to choke.</p>

            <p>SPARTAN Shadow-118 looked at the struggling PPC Agent and grinned under his golden helmet. <br><br>Once Master Chief&#39;s older brother and commander,he&#39;d been recruited to serve a higher purpose by the EPC: the destruction of all who opposed their inspired vision. A vision of unity, of peace under the banner of the Emperor. Their Lord and Master had commanded them to cross the void between the worlds and bring down the butchers of the PPC. This mockery of their holy work would fall: the Emperor of All Universes had decreed it, and so it would be.<br><br>Suddenly feeling euphoric at the thought of victory, Shade looked at his partner, Jedi Knight Celeboraian Moonsong. An elf from Middle-Earth, she&#39;d been trained in the ways of the Force and had a knack for taking down Forceless warriors who specialized in hunting Jedi. She laughed, her voice tinkling and sweet even as the tone turned malicious.<br><br>&quot;That tin can didn&#39;t do you much good, did it, butcher?&quot;<br><br>Shade chuckled.<br><br>&quot;Do you want it or should I?&quot; he asked. The Mandalorian struggled for a moment, then stopped when Shadow tightened his grip. In a few seconds, he&#39;d finish the PPCer off, but for now, he&#39;d enjoy the feeling of power he had over the murderess.<br><br>Moonsong shrugged, then blinked her sliver eyelashes.<br><br>&quot;What&#39;s that beeping noise?&quot;<br><br>Shadow frowned and looked down in time to see a humming, perfectly spherical ball slip from the Mandalorian&#39;s fingers. The thermal detonator flared and vanished in a ball of flame.<br><br>Drental and Shadow, despite being at the blast&#39;s epicenter, were more or less unharmed due to the low-power setting of the explosive and their own armour. Moonsong, who was wearing only a revealing variant of a Jedi tunic, was less lucky. Her smoldering corpse slumped against a wall, scattering ash as it fell.<br><br>Shadow looked up from where the explosion had thrown him to see the Mandalorian looming over him, a strange gun held in its right hand. There was a click, and the world turned white for the EPCer as the Verpine slugs penetrated his helmet.<br><br>Drental dropped the empty slugthrower, struggling to stay upright as she fought the combined effects of dizziness and lack of breath from her near-fatal choking. She&#39;d staggered two corridors away when she ran into a face she&#39;d never expected to see.</p>

            <p>At the sight of Agent Warren, one of the Enforcers slowly drew his violet laser whip, a weapon so indescribably awesome that it could only come from a Sueniverse. Before he could make use of it, his head was brutally smashed against the nearest wall in an explosion of bone splinters and bits of brain. The other Enforcers turned toward the attacker in surprise, only to find an innocent-looking little girl with a sweet dimpled smile, huge amber eyes and a bloodied flail larger than her. Behind her came a grim-faced young man with trenchcoat, fedora and eyepatch, who seemed to come straight out of a cheap mystery novel of the fifties.<br><br>&quot;Come ooooon, ya can fight better than that, I trust,&quot; said the girl to the Enforcers with a creepy grin. She rose her flail again and nonchalantly swung it above her head, prompting her companion to prudently draw back a few steps.</p>

            <p>With the EPC closing in on either side of the four PPC Agents, things were looking grim. <br><br>At least, they would have been looking grim if the first, larger group hadn&#39;t been decimated by a certain malfunctioning android. A pink haired &quot;gothic&quot; girl wailed as she ran away from the carnage, only to be stopped by the application of a spiked ball to the back of her head. Smiling slightly, Ellen continued to efficiently slaughter the remaining EPCers.<br><br>The other three Agents were having less luck. Cat&#39;s trenchcoat was now sporting several charred holes, Chase was running low on ammunition, and Alex...Alex knew better than to even try firing a ranged weapon. Slowly but surely, the two patrols of EPC newcomers were forcing the Agents back.<br><br>&quot;What else can go wrong?&quot; Alex shouted in despair, completely forgetting the PPCs resident Law in the process. The Overpower never could resist a statement like that.</p>

            <p>Three squads of Suevians marched in perfect formation through the cafeteria doors and towards the group, stepping over bodies from earlier conflicts inside the cafeteria. True to EPC form, not a single one was blemished; they were all exactly the same height and had the same mocking smile. <br><br>Their leader, a grey and gold armoured stormtrooper holding a glowing sword, gestured at the group, then spoke.<br><br>&quot;Weapons.&quot;   <br><br>Each of the Sues raised a gun of some kind, aiming at the six Agents.<br><br>&quot;Aim.&quot;<br><br>The Sues lifted their weapons to shoulder height and deactivated the safeties. <br><br>&quot;Fi-&quot; The stormtrooper stopped midword, reaching for the side of his helmet with the hand not holding a blaster. He seemed to slump slightly, then gestured. Unbelievably, the other EPCers lowered their weapons and stepped aside. Another group of Agents entered, each of them familiar but twisted. It seemed the Suevians had a sense of irony. <br><br>A trenchcoat-wearing Stu-Cal led the six newcomers as they charged towards the PPCers. Looking at his counterpart as it screamed obscenities at him, Alex thought, quite randomly, <i>Thank God for mook chivalry</i>. <br><br>Weapons clashed and the battle was joined.</p>

            <p>Adder roared, recognizing her and Deuce&#39;s own counterparts, who (to her grim triumph) still looked a bit beaten up from their last encounter.

As she moved closer to her Suvian counterpart, she could see the pearly white teeth from the maniacal yet still mind-numbingly beautiful smile. It made Chase want to retch. With an almost unnoticed flick of Sue!Chase&#39;s wrist, the whip had cracked dangerously close, and Chase had to side-step to dodge the recoil.

It was when the Sue got cocky; she was trying to cast a spell, and Akemi swung with full force across the girl&#39;s neck.

The other&#39;s might need help,&quot; Akemi shouted to drag Chase out of her dazed state.<br><br>&quot;If they need help they&#39;ll ask,&quot; she replied, standing.<br><br>She aimed for the battalion of Sues and began to open fire.

            <p>Deuce was in difficulties. His Stu counterpart was just as short and scrawny as he was, but (being a Stu) possessed unnatural strength and a katana. Deuce cursed both inwardly and out loud. He was skilled in hand-to-hand combat, having lived on the streets for a good three years of his life, but one of the skills he&#39;d never gotten the hang of was sword fighting.<br><br>Stu!Deuce whirled the katana in a flashing figure-8, for the sake of showing off his skill, before swinging it downward at Deuce&#39;s head. The PPC Agent managed to catch the katana strike with the crossed blades of his daggers, and kicked the Stu hard in the lower stomach for good measure. Before he could recover his balance fully, the Stu brought the katana down and around, slashing at Deuce&#39;s abdomen. Only his swiftness saved his life, but the blade still caught him in the side. Gritting his teeth against the pain, Deuce switched his grip on one of his daggers and flung it. Stu!Deuce dodged it gracefully.<br><br>Snarling, Deuce ducked the flashing katana blade and maneuvered through the fighting to the dagger he&#39;d thrown. Summoning up his nerve, he stooped to retrieve it.<br><br>He was too slow. Stu!Deuce made his move and cannoned into him, knocking him to the ground and jarring the remaining dagger out of his hand.<br><br>Deuce found himself flat on his back, with the dagger he&#39;d attempted to pick up just within his reach. He stretched out his hand to grab it when the Stu drove the blade of the katana through the downed agent&#39;s shoulder. Deuce could not hold back a cry of pain, and he felt the sword&#39;s tip scrape the ground beneath his bleeding shoulder.<br><br>&quot;Oh, no you don&#39;t!&quot; the Stu hissed. &quot;How dare you, you evil, murdering PPC agent! Suevians are superior! We will cleanse the Multiverse of your fil-&quot;<br><br>Deuce grabbed his opponent&#39;s uniform front with the hand connected to his uninjured shoulder, dragging him down. When the surprised Stu was within reach, Deuce raised his head and sank his jagged teeth into the side of the Suevian&#39;s neck. With a savage jerk of his head, Deuce tore out the Stu&#39;s jugular before shoving the twitching body to the side. A strangled &quot;urrrgghhnnn...&quot; escaped from the dying EPC agent&#39;s mouth.<br><br>I hope he regenerates like me, please let him regenerate like me, Deuce thought frantically. The Stu, however, stayed dead, and Deuce inwardly rejoiced having thwarted the Ironic Overpower.<br><br>Suddenly, Sue!Adder was looming over him, pointing an M-16 in his direction with a twistedly beautiful smile on her face. Deuce nearly panicked right then and there, but--<br><br>&quot;HEY! YOUR FIGHT&#39;S WITH ME, BOYO!&quot; Eyes still suffused with blood, Adder advanced on her counterpart, her lightsaber held at the ready.<br><br>&quot;Relinquish your weapon or your partner dies.&quot; Sue!Adder said flatly, only to be beheaded two seconds later.<br><br>With the atrocity dead, the Bloodwrath faded. &quot;Deuce! You okay?&quot; she asked her partner worriedly.<br><br>&quot;Oh, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Deuce replied dryly. &quot;I&#39;m just lying here relaxing, pinned to the floor by a sword through my shoulder. Be a dear and get it out, will you?&quot;<br><br>Adder complied as carefully as she could. Deuce bit back a scream of agony, his blue eyes closed, and he passed out from the pain.<br><br>Taking up her lightsaber, Adder stood over her partner and lashed out furiously at any Suevian foolish enough to get too close.</p>

            <p>Alex stared at himself. He stared back. As was usual with AU doppelgangers, the two were almost identical, down to the same light grey jacket and slightly pop-eyed stare. There were some subtle differences, such as the Stu&#39;s slightly longer hair and the lightsabers of canons replacing those of Sues on his belt, but they were hard to tell apart at a glance. <br><br>There were shouts from nearby and the clanging of weapons as the Agents clashed with the their EPC counterparts, but Stu-Alex continued to casually stroll towards his canon opponent. Alex knew he was taunting him, but couldn&#39;t help rising to the challenge. <br><br>&quot;For canon!&quot; he shouted, slashing at the doppelganger. Said Stu calmly sidestepped as Alex ran at him, then gave him a hard shove in the back. Alex stumbled, tripped over a piece of debris, and landed heavily on one of the tables. Stu-Alex chuckled deeply, pacing back and forth a meter away.<br><br>&quot;Pathetic. I&#39;d expect my counterpart among these vermin to have a modicum of skill, but it seems I expected too much.&quot;<br><br>Pushing himself off the table with a grunt, Alex turned and looked at his counterpart.<br><br>&quot;Die.&quot;<br><br>Reaching into his pocket, Alex pulled out a small, blue sphere and pressed a red button mounted into its middle. As the plasma grenade began to hiss and glow, he threw it at the Stu. <br><br>His eyes widening, Stu-Alex leaped to the side, spitting curses at Alex as he did so. The plasma grenade went off with a buzz, sending arcs of electricity in all directions and leaving a smoldering crater where a set of chairs, a Sue, and a teapot had been moments earlier. The fate of the teapot, while important in the larger scheme of things, does not factor into this discussion and will not be mentioned again.<br><br>Stu-Alex staggered to his feet, eyes literally blazing due to his usage of Enraged Glare #6. A smirking Alex walked up to him casually in an almost exact reenactment of the scene from moments earlier.<br><br>&quot;You were saying?&quot;<br><br>The Stu pulled out a curved, engraved lightsaber hilt, fingers tightening around the handle. Alex noted that it appeared to be identical to that of Asajji Ventress, and the knowledge of what had likely occurred added to his rage.<br><br>The Stu pressed his saber&#39;s activation stud and a blood-red blade hummed into existence from the handle. His face and jacket blackened and scorched from the grenade, Alex-Stu struck Dramatic Pose #4, then lunged for the canon Alex. He parried, and the duel began in earnest.</p>

            <p>Much to Cal&#39;s dismay, Stu!Cal was closely followed by Sue!Ellen, who was just like Ellen except that she was fully operational and wielded a... lightflail. Of a beautiful urple color. Panicked, Cal put his android partner back on the ground and re-activated her, hoping she would act more or less normally now.<br><br>Instead, Ellen resumed what she had been doing when Cal had switched her off, namely the Joker&#39;s amazing pencil trick. But Sue!Ellen made the grievous mistake of running straight at her at this very moment, her deadly weapon swinging high above her head.<br><br>It turned out that pencil beats lightflail.<br><br>Cal did not prove as efficient against his own evil counterpart.

            <p>There was a flash of light and a shower of sparks as the two lighsaber blades struck each other and their owners pushed. Alex pulled his lightsaber free from the lock and swung again, only to miss completely as the Stu sidestepped again. Stu-Alex smirked again, and made a beckoning gesture with his hand.<br><br>&quot;Stop doing that!&quot; Alex shouted. The Stu&#39;s smirk widened. <br><br>&quot;Pathetic, useless fool. How your kind came to dominate your multiverse, I&#39;ll never understand.

Stu-Alex casually blocked it, then swung his own lightsaber an inch lower. Alex felt an intense heat on his saber hand as the sword passed centimeters above it and saw his blade vanish as the Stu cut through the top of the handle. <br><br>The Stu grinned, showing his perfectly white teeth in the process.<br><br>&quot;Goodbye, vermin.&quot;<br><br>Smiling, Stu-Alex lifted his sword and brought it down for the kill...only to bring the blade down in front of him in a last-second parry as Alex activated the laser whip he&#39;d salvaged earlier and sent the flexible energy beam hissing towards the Stu. The violet beam wrapped around Stu-Alex&#39;s saber blade, and Alex tried o pull it back. Unfortunately, the Stu had recovered from his momentary shock and easily, almost contemptuously, pulled his saber back, taking the vibrowhip with it. The weapon deactivated upon being pulled out of Alex&#39;s grip, skittering under a table and out of reach. The Stu was smirking again.<br><br>&quot;As I was saying, goodbye.&quot;</p>

With a yelp, Adder ducked the blade. She stood over her unconscious partner protectively, scared out of her mind but unwilling to leave him. Deuce had been right; apart from wild swinging and chopping, her sword skills were dubious at best. Gritting her teeth, she ducked another swing from the glowing blade. All the stress lately, piling on top of the trauma from the smutfic she and Deuce had been sent into, had snapped her sanity. But the Bloodwrath she had experienced refused to resurface; now she was herself again, forced to fight with nothing but what little skill she had.  <br><br>There was a familiar grating roar, and a small, dark red shape shot toward the storm trooper and snatched the sword from its hand. Dashing forward, Adder ran the EPCer through and turned to her rescuer. &quot;You took your time getting here, Zoku! What kept you?&quot;<br><br>Zoku the Mini-Fire-Dragon merely snarled in reply, before breathing a mouthful of fire into the face of Alex&#39;s Suevian counterpart, right as the latter was about to bring down his lightsaber for a death blow.</p>

            <p>Alex was crouched in front of a table as the Stu prepared to strike, his hands clenched into fists and held up in a futile gesture. The Stu brough the blade down...and dropped the saber as flames washed over him. The curved lightsaber rolled away from the EPC Agent as he staggered backwards ,screaming in agony and clawing at his now-burned face. <br><br>Alex picked the saber handle up and briefly contemplated making some witty remark before deciding to simply finish the imposter off. Stu-Alex&#39;s screams quickly died down as he stopped clawing at his own face, replaced by gasping. Alex looked at his counterpart and saw something that resembled a well-done steak more than a human face. Both of the imposter&#39;s eyes had been completely burned away, and blackened glitter oozed from the sockets.<br><br>&quot;Payback time.&quot; Alex snarled. The imposter swivelled towards him, flailing wildly with his burned arms in a vain attempt to block him. Alex calmly and quickly swung the saber in a low arc. There were two buzzes in rapid succession, and Stu-Alex&#39;s torso fell one way as his legs fell another. Shrieking in pain, the imposter continued to wave his arms as he fell on his back. <br><br>&quot;Relax.&quot; Alex said, an unpleasant smile on his face. The Stu continued to scream, so Alex turned the lightsaber over in his hands and stabbed down. The Stu clutched at his now impaled sword hand with the other, gritting his teeth in pain. Alex noted that he&#39;d stopped screaming, then took the other hand. <br><br>To his credit, Stu-Alex was completely silent when Alex lifted the lightsaber above his head for the final time. There was a hiss as the lightsaber passed through the EPCer&#39;s neck, and Stu-Alex&#39;s head rolled off.<br><br>Alex deactivated the lightsaber, and looked at his counterpart&#39;s body.<br><br>&quot;Hm...jacket seems to be intact.&quot;<br><br>Alex bent down and promptly relieved the imposter of the jacket. There were some burn marks, and the hood had been singed by Alex&#39;s lightsaber swipe, but it was more or less intact. Better yet, he had four lightsabers on his belt.<br><br>The battle in the Cafeteria had quickly grown into a full scale skirmish. With reinforcements from both sides pouring in through the doors, there were now several dozen Agents from both sides inside the cavernous room. Stray energy beams and projectiles flew in all directions and the clanging of swords echoed through the room.<br><br>Putting on the imposter&#39;s jacket instead of his own now-tattered one, Alex looked around. Agents of all shapes and sizes were fighting Sues, many of them their counterparts. Alex heard a hiss and turned to see a large cat jump at him, claws extended. He chuckled and ducked. A moment later, he was very surprised when it abruptly shifted into a large wolf and knocked him to the ground, claws tearing into his jacket. <br><br>He tried to gut it with his lightsaber, but the Animorph Sue saw the movement and knocked the saber from his hand with one massive paw. In a now-unpleasantly familiar situation, Alex saw the saber handle go flying off into a Suefic surface rubble pile. Jaws snapping, the morphed Sue prepared to tear the Agent&#39;s throat out.<br><br>(OOC: I know that Animorphs can&#39;t shift directly from one form to another, but the Sue doesn&#39;t.)<br></p>

            <p>Akemi shrieked at her partner, and Chase was able to turn fast enough to see the fight Akemi was referring to. A wolf was pinning one of the other Agents down, preparing for the fatal strike. Chase aimed her zat and caught the animal once, but the second shot missed and hit a wall as the wind was knocked out of her.<br><br>Chase hit the ground and the zat slipped from her fingers, and she turned to face the storm trooper that had knocked her off balance.<br><br>&quot;Isn&#39;t that a little un-sueish for you?&quot;<br><br>She shoved the trooper away and scrambled for the zat, but her face fell as the weapon was picked up by another pair of hands. As Chase saw the Storm Trooper lift himself off the floor to pull out his blaster, she saw a blue beam pulsate towards his figure.<br><br>Akemi, shaking some from the close call, reached the zat out to Chase, who took it and stood up to get her axe.<br><br>It looked like more reinforcements for their side had drawn in, and the fight dragged on.<br><br>&quot;Stop throwing food at people and start chopping some heads!&quot;<br><br>Akemi nodded and made her way to the storm troopers as Chase ran towards the other Agent and the wolf.<br><br>The wolf sue had recovered sooner than she had hoped, and was moving too quickly for Chase to get a decent shot without hitting the other Agent. She tried to get closer to intercept the two, but nearly tripped on something. She looked down to see the lightsaber, shut down but still functional, and quickly tossed it towards the fighting Agent.<br><br>&quot;Heads up!&quot;</p>

            <p>Apparently aware of her surroundings again, the android broke free from Cal&#39;s grasp, wrestled with Akemi for a moment and managed to get her hands on the cookie with the most chocolate chips per square centimeter.

            <p>through the hallways, locked in combat with their respective mirror-selves. Cthulhu the ferret had emerged victorious over his own opponent, though he was limping badly, and Adder could not be sure that all of the blood staining his white fur had belonged to the EPC ferret.<br><br>Deuce was making a grave mistake; every now and then, he would look up, frantically searching for the familiar door to RC 6664. Because of this, they were nowhere near it.<br><br>Finally, Deuce decided to ignore his partner&#39;s earlier advice concerning pyrokinesis. Concentrating, he summoned a flame and sent it blasting into his opponent&#39;s face. Unfortunately, the thing refused to die.<br><br>&quot;BLIGHT IT ALL TA HELL!&quot; The small Agent snarled. Stooping, he scooped the injured ferret up in one hand and grabbed Adder&#39;s jacket sleeve with the other. &quot;Come on! We have to find safety somewhere!&quot;<br><br>Adder aimed one final blow at her opponent with her cricket bat before joining her partner in a full-out sprint down the hallway. An RC door was ajar; without thinking, Adder grabbed her partner and flung him through it. Then, diving into a shoulder roll that would have made her sifu proud, she made it into the open RC. Flipping over onto her back, she shoved the door closed with her foot, causing the pursuing EPC agents to smack into it in a rather un-Sueish way.<br><br>Deuce lay on his side, breathing hard with both fatigue and relief, and Adder looked up to see whose RC they&#39;d charged into. To her immense relief, she recognized one of them.<br><br>&quot;Why, hello, Cal,&quot; she greeted, somehow managing her braces-studded Cheshire Cat smile. &quot;How&#39;s the coffee maker?

            <p>Ansela Jonla, Princess of Thieves and Senior EPC Agent ran a delicate yet strong hand through her shoulder length auburn hair as she strode through the captured corridors of this PPC.

There was resistance in this sector, their telepath said, and they were to stamp it out before it could become organised, not that these mundane murderers could ever be a true threat. It was with great shock then, that Ansela came face to face with a group of these incredibly dull, unglamorous looking &#39;PPC Agents&#39;.<br><br>Pulling a perfectly formed bejewelled dagger, with a hilt of pure gold and a blade of silver and steel, from her belt, Ansela&#39;s whiskey-coloured eyes locked onto one of the resistance in particular. This woman bore some superficial resemblance to the EPC Agent, close enough in fact, that they might even have been twins if the PPC one carried the glow of a Sue and a true woman within her.</p>

            <p>The scream went up as Agent Adder hurled herself headlong into the fray.

            <p>After the disasterous attempt to take over this multiverse&#39;s Department of Operations, the unexpected level of PPC resistance forcing them back, he had been charged with taking DoDAEG with the taste of defeat still in his mouth. Thanks to these worthless canon-lovers, he had lost a lot of his friends on the way here, but they&#39;d managed to escape the slaughter, and now they were here in this hall. Putting a hand to the still-bleeding cut on his face, he couldn&#39;t believe the PPCers had marred his once nearly-perfect visage.<br><br>  &quot;Heh. Are you sure you know where you&#39;re going, Marcus?&quot; Zodfang asked, standing to his left. Zodfang was about as handsome as an Orc got, with ornately designed battle armour modified to fit EPC uniform regulations, the mithril axe in his hand dripping with PPCer blood. A rare Orc!Stu from the Elder Scrolls &#39;verse, Zodfang had been his partner for a long time, the fact that they were friends the only reason Marcus tolerated the huge Orc second-guessing him.<br><br>  &quot;Of course I am, we&#39;re getting closer every minute,&quot; he said, giving Zodfang a sharp look before glancing behind them to Cassie and Nat. &quot;You guys ready? It shouldn&#39;t be much further.&quot;<br><br>  Once he had got a response from the two, he checked his revolver and pistol to make sure both were loaded. Satisfied that they were, he started to head down the corridor. It wasn&#39;t a long walk before they came out into another corridor, only to find the corpses of a group of their own Agents, being stood over by PPCers who looked almost identical to them. It didn&#39;t take a genius to figure out just what happened, and the Enforcer couldn&#39;t contain his anger, raising his weapons into a firing position...<br><br>  Only for a bullet to go straight past his head, causing him to yell in surprise and duck back around the corner.<br><br>***<br><br>  Marcus and company had been walking for a while before they found much worth noticing, the few Enforcer groups they ran into easily dispatched, much to Zodfang&#39;s disappointment. They didn&#39;t seem to be any closer to learning the truth behind this random attack, and any attempt to take EPC members prisoner didn&#39;t amount to anything, but at the least he knew he still had to lead the group to DoDAEG, and they were getting closer. It was only a matter of time before they rounded a corner and say Trojie, Pads, and Ansela standing over the corpses of their doubles.<br><br><i>Finally, a pleasant surprise,</i> he thought about to call out to them when he saw himself (?!) round a corner behind them. The conclusion was an easy one to reach, and as his double started to raise his guns Marcus had already slung the shotgun onto his back and taken out the Colt, switching sheer power for precision in the hopes of picking the Stu off. Unfortunately, his shot just barely missed, but it caused his double to cry out and duck back around.<br><br>  &quot;WATCH IT! We&#39;ve got hostiles,&quot; he shouted to the group ahead of him, squeezing off a few more shots at the area his double had come from to buy Trojie&#39;s lot time to get into cover. A bullet nearly clipped his ear, but the fact that it missed meant he only reacted by motioning Zodfang up. &quot;Zodfang! Get up here and give us some suppressing fire! Maybe we can disable them, find out what&#39;s going on here!&quot;<br><br><i>And to think this had been a relatively quiet 1 April.</i></p>

            <p>Nat reached for her own weapon, but stopped when she realised who the PPCers further down were. &quot;Don&#39;t shoot at &#39;em!&quot; she yelled at Marcus, not having seen the mirror&#39;verse Agent. &quot;They&#39;re on our side!&quot;<br><br>Cassie leaned round to see who it was Nat was talking about, but glanced back at Zodfang in alarm when Marcus called for the Ork to come and help.<br><br>&quot;Trojie!

            <p>&quot;Suppressing fire, huh?  Reckon I can help there,&quot; she said, moving forward.<br><br>Leas grabbed her shoulder.  &quot;Protective magic first,&quot; he told her firmly.  It was good that they hadn&#39;t had to use them before, but he wouldn&#39;t like to take on someone like Marcus&#39;s double without protection, and he doubted the others would, either.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Deryn sighed, making sure she wasn&#39;t in the line of fire before starting on casting Protect on everyone she was sure was on their side.</p>

            <p>looked around the corner to fire a shot at where he&#39;d seen his double, trying to yell over the incredibly loud din of Zodfang&#39;s heavy bolter as it pounded the hell out of the EPCers&#39; cover. There were very large chunks torn out of the walls where bolts had either gone stray or hit home with the intention of forcing the EPCers to keep their heads down, allowing Marcus to move up into his position and try to get closer to the trapped Agents.<br><br>  &quot;Ansela! Trojie! Are you alright?! Listen, just make your way over here, we&#39;ll try to keep them pinned down!&quot; Marcus screamed, trying to make himself heard over the sheer volley of fire. The bolter was deafeningly loud, but he thought he saw his words register to the people he was talking to, though he couldn&#39;t be sure as he again fired at the EPCers, this time nearly hitting one who had stuck his neck out too far.<br><br><i>Alright, we&#39;re doing good, now as long as Zodfang doesn&#39;t run out of-</i><br><br>  *click*<br><br>  &quot;ARGH! ZOGGIN&#39; &#39;ELL, &#39;OOMIE, I&#39;M OUTTA BOLTZ! FER GORK&#39;S SAKE, COVA ME, YA GROTS! NEED TA RELOAD!&quot; <br><br>***<br><br>  &quot;Okay, these guys are starting to annoy me!&quot; Mirror!Marcus snarled, slamming in another clip for his solid gold Colt .45 as the hulking beast that served as this multiverse&#39;s answer to Zodfang bellowed out to the world that he had run out of ammunition. Leaning out, he hesitated for a moment, unsure of whether to shoot at the Agents on the ground or the ones firing, but as he aimed his pistol at one of the prone female Agents, he almost lost his head again, causing him to duck back and look at the others. Somehow, aside from Zodfang&#39;s arm being grazed, none of them had been hurt, almost as if the sheer torrent of fire was more to keep their heads down than to kill them. Muttering several expletives, he fired around the corner.<br><br><i>They&#39;re MOCKING me!</i><br><br>  &quot;You lot&#39;re all right?&quot; Marcus asked, again returning fire at his double. If they wanted to advance, fine, it would just give him the pleasure of wringing the life out of the fake Marcus with his own hands.</p>

            <p>feeling fairly useless, as their weaponry was pretty much limited to their swords, which in this kind of situation were about as much help as wings would have been. Exchanging a glance, the pair of them watched their companions fighting and occasionally peeped out anxiously to check on the progress of Trojie, Ansela and Pads, who were crawling up towards them.<br><br>Kelvin, though unnerved by the events, was contributing as much as he could. Unlike Zodfang, who didn&#39;t even seem to grasp what the word &quot;aim&quot; meant, the Elf was taking his time and actually trying to hit the people firing from around the corner.<br><br>When Zodfang stopped firing, Cassie and Nat looked at each other, the same thought going through both their heads, and scrambled out to begin crawling down to help the others out.<br><br><i>If we can get ta the corner, we can take &#39;em out,</i> Nat thought, trying to ignore the fact that her arm was protesting against being used for the current exercise.<br><br>Beside her, Cassie&#39;s thoughts were more on the line of <i>What the HELL have I just done?! Too late to back out now, though,</i> she added as she rolled behind an open door just in time to avoid getting her head blown apart. Why the hell anyone had left their RC door open she had no clue, but it was definitely useful. &quot;Nat!&quot; she yelled, an idea coming to her. &quot;Open the doors so we can use them as cover!&quot;<br><br>Nat gave her a blank stare for a moment, pressed up against the wall on the opposite side of the corridor, but she quickly grasped the idea and scrambled forwards to open the next door along.<br><br>A blonde girl leaned out, seemingly to get a better look at the situation, and Kelvin let fly. She screamed and ducked back, the arrow lodged in her shoulder.<br><br>***<br><br>Mirror!Nat gasped in horror as her friend fell back, an arrow in her shoulder, and rushed to help. &quot;It&#39;s all right, you&#39;re going to be just fine,&quot; she said soothingly, trying to help the crying girl up. &quot;We can get you sorted, just stay calm.&quot;<br><br>&quot;They&#39;re getting closer,&quot; Cassie sobbed, crystal tears rolling down her face and splashing onto her uniform. She looked pleadingly at Marcus and Zodfang. &quot;We&#39;ve got to stop them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shhh, it&#39;s okay, you just stay calm,&quot; Nat said, trying to ease the arrow out and eventually pulling it free. She examined it for a moment, then angrily snapped it and threw it across the corridor befor trying to bandage her friend up. &quot;We&#39;ll pay them back for this.&quot;<br><br>Once she was finished, she left Cassie sitting out of the way and joined the other two, trying to return fire at the stinking PPC Agents who&#39;d hurt her friend.</p>

            <p>but both were determined to do what they could.  They&#39;d been here a while.<br><br>&quot;Keeping them down rather then outright killing, huh?&quot; Deryn murmured, her gaze distant as she considered which spell would be best.  &quot;Suppose it&#39;ll help work out what plans there are, if we can get &#39;em…&quot;<br><br>Leas nodded.  &quot;I&#39;ll see if what I know can help,&quot; he said, and pushed a pack into her hands.  &quot;Remember not to push yourself too far before refreshing yourself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, dad,&quot; Deryn groaned, inching up.  She looked at the field, and thought.  A bomb would be a good distraction, but with agents coming towards them and her aim not being the best with grenades and the like, a fire was probably the safer bet.  Failing to char the target hadn&#39;t exactly been part of her training, though…  &quot;If I can get the gun…&quot; she murmured, and focused on aiming at that.<br><br>Leas, meanwhile, had started singing softly- a simple chant, meant to rejuvenate the spirit.</p>

            <p>Busy at school, but all work and no play makes Joe a sad puppy. Still going through trial-and-error processes with various characters and things, and today I have four things to show off: one old, and three new. I&#39;d muchly appreciate any feedback you can offer on any of the lot, either here or in the Livejournal.<br><br>The old one is Agent Narcolepsy, who is here since I revised his first profile into the more commonly-used format, which gave me a chance to expand his backstory and flesh out his personality a bit. He&#39;ll be back shortly after this, too.<br><br><a href="http://warrior-joe.livejournal.com/1843.html"><a href="http://warrior-joe.livejournal.com/1843.html">http://warrior-joe.livejournal.com/1843.html</a></a><br><br>The first new face is Agent Silas, a member of the Race from Harry Turtledove&#39;s Worldwar, which you may recall me asking about a while back. I still don&#39;t have the books, but if today&#39;s trip to the U of M bookstore yields no fruit, I&#39;m going to give in and order the things off Amazon. I&#39;m not fond of Amazon, but we must make sacrifices for our cause. I don&#39;t intend to even touch Silas until I&#39;ve read the books, mind, but I wanted to get the idea down before it fled.<br><br><a href="http://warrior-joe.livejournal.com/2447.html"><a href="http://warrior-joe.livejournal.com/2447.html">http://warrior-joe.livejournal.com/2447.html</a></a><br><br>Number three is Agent Comstock, who was born directly from my frustrations over my laptop biting it for the second time in less than a year. No guesses as to who he&#39;s partnering up with.<br><br><a href="http://warrior-joe.livejournal.com/2746.html"><a href="http://warrior-joe.livejournal.com/2746.html">http://warrior-joe.livejournal.com/2746.html</a></a><br><br>And the big one is a story!

            <p>...here are some more characters who play major roles in Chliever and Winston&#39;s stories:<br><br>The Floating Hyacinth: Chliever and Winston&#39;s Head of Department, so of course he shows up occasionally. At one point, he sends them on a punishment mission to the entire works of Starjeffry.<br><br>Agent Grendel de Bry: The self-proclaimed &quot;Morally-ambiguous head of genetics and regeneration&quot; for the Medical Department. He&#39;s responsible for all tanks in HQ, such as the regeneration tanks and the Floating Hyacinth&#39;s tank. He enjoys randomly breaking into bouts of evil laughter, wearing horrible-smelling latex gloves, and generally looking and acting a lot like Professor Hojo.<br><br>The Insane Canon: This (canonically) insane canon character is saved from a squickfic by Chliever and Winston, is sent to Medical for treatment, and subsequently escapes, ultimately moving in with Chliever and Winston despite their protests. Who this is is a pretty big spoiler for the early missions, so I won&#39;t tell you just yet, but I am well-versed in this person&#39;s native canon and thus should be able to write them fairly well.<br><br>Chliever&#39;s Dumbass Brothers-in-law: Algort the Contaminator, Pustol the Mortifier, and Burt the Stealer of One Sock from Each Pair respectively. These three get dumped by the Warp into the RC and immediately make with the mooching. They&#39;ll appear from mission three onward.<br><br>Chliever&#39;s Nerglings: Chliever has thirteen adorable Nerglings back home. Most of his paycheck gets sent to them. They may move into the RC later on, I&#39;m not sure yet.<br><br>Agent Michel Javert: If Tomato will let me use him, I&#39;ve got a big role planned for him later on.<br><br>EPC: Yep, I&#39;m planning to do a Mirror Multiverse story. Features appearances by the mirror Dr. Fitzgerald and Bashir Hologram, the latter of who&#39;s identity is... disturbing, to say the least.</p>

            <p>Rapist!Yamcha. My eternal enemy has struck again. Oh, and King Vegeta being upset that his son married an earthling. What an original plot device. You can totally tell the author didn&#39;t just take a bunch of plot devices from other fics and then mixed them together. <br><br>*gets the feeling that if she actually clicks the link, there is a good chance she will start breaking stuff.*</p>

            <p>Yes, of course lions have skin, but the bit I was referring to was talking about should have said fur, not skin, as it was referring to a... colour, I think.

            <p>Alex saw the lightsaber fly through the air and jerked to the right in an attempt to catch it, throwing the wolf off balance in the process. Hand reaching out, Alex lifted his arm as the lightsaber began to fall down, his fingers curved as he prepared to hit the activation button...<br><br>And promptly felt the hilt hit him between the eyes hard enough to make his world turn black for a moment. The handle dropped to the ground with a clatter. <br><br>&quot;Sorry!&quot; Chase called, then was forced to turn back to her opponent as he nearly took her head off with his sword. All the nearby Agents were similarly occupied, so there would be no help for Alex from that quarter. <br><br>The wolf Sue had gotten back to her paws by this point and snarled viciously as she jumped at Alex. The PCCer, who had just gotten his fingers around the saber hilt, was thrown off his feet. <br><br>The saber handle slipped from his grasp once again, only inches out of his reach. Reaching for it with his left hand, Alex tried to the wolf&#39;s jaws shut and away from his neck with the other. He wasn&#39;t having much luck. The wolf&#39;s claws tore holes in his jacket and jeans and left bloody gashes in his chest and legs as it struggled to break free of the death-grip Alex was exerting on its jaw. Alex struggled to twist to the left, and the wolf took advantage of that to jerk its jaw free of Alex&#39;s grip. <br><br>It lunged for the Agents neck at the same time he got a grip on the curved saber handle and swung it above him. The Wolf! Sue impaled its head onto the lightsaber, shrieking as the energy blade burned through its lower jaw and skull before emerging through its left eyesocket.<br><br>The howl stopped, and the Sue collapsed onto the Agent. Panting and exhausted, Alex tried to move, only to be stopped by the corpse&#39;s sheer bulk. Absently, he noted that the body was just the right size to be made into a very nice rug. <br><br>Fortunately and unfortunately for the trapped Agent, the combatants of both sides were too busy killing each other to notice him. Fortunately because it meant a Sue wouldn&#39;t come over to finish him off. Unfortunately because help would not be forthcoming. Two minutes later, Alex finally worked up the strength to push the body off and pull himself up. Wincing with each movement and the pain it brought from his various injuries, the Agent got back to his feet.</p>

Lime-green painted nails dug into the Generic walls as some girl (presumably an agent) launched past her and onto an unidentified, way too pretty female...thing. Presumably a Sue or agent gone crazy, B&amp;b concluded and quietly stepped out into the hall, shutting the door behind her with an unheard click, lost among the chaos of noise and yells.<br><br>She leaned up against the door, crossing her arms and ankles casually, watching the mayhem with an expression similar to a bored woman forced to watch a horse race. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; She asked whoever was near her, currently fighting something that looked like a weasel, though she couldn&#39;t see all too clearly. </p>

With a stool she smashed the ribs of a Stu and singled him out for interrogation.<br><br>&quot;FEDERAL AGENT!&quot; she yelled at his terrified face. &quot;WHERE IS THE BOMB?&quot; She grabbed his thumb and snapped it like a twig.<br><br>&quot;<i>Arrrgh!</i> There&#39;s no bomb, I swear!&quot;<br><br>&quot;THEN WHERE IS YOUR LEADER?

The plan was to incinerate their bodies. This way we not only destroy the canon-makers, but we also paralyze the PPC headquarters.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How many are you?&quot; asked Ellen grimly.<br><br>Before the Stu could answer, a pirate Sue shot him with a pistol, killing him instantly. &quot;DAMMIT!&quot; snarled Ellen.</p>

            <p>Most of the remaining Enforcers were either surrendering (haha!) or fleeing, except for a few particularly stubborn ones who fought on against all odds. The floor of the cafeteria, slick with blood, was littered with the dead and the dying. The janitor would be even angrier than the day of the so-called &quot;Food Fight to End All Food Fights&quot; (but that&#39;s another story).<br><br>&quot;Follow me!&quot; barked Agent Ellen, still in Jack Bauer mode, to anyone who would listen. &quot;To the Department of Dead Author Electricity Generation!

            <p>Yesterday I found a mission I had been working on on a friend&#39;s computer. I&#39;d forgotten I&#39;d even written the mission. (That Bleeprin is some potent stuff) The Sue&#39;s been charged, all that&#39;s needed is a good way to get rid of her. I remember I had such a method, but having forgotten about the mission, I also forgot about that method.<br><br>The thing is, the Sue&#39;s Jack Harkness&#39; daughter and she claims his immortality has passed on to her. So if I shoot her she just resuractes. I think I have three options now:<br>1) reasoning with the Sue that she cannot be immortal;<br>2) burying her maffia style (in the concrete foundations of a building);<br>3) bumming a ride of a couple of agents that have a TARDIS (my agents weren&#39;t around when those were issued) and drop the Sue in the black hole where the Doctor (10) dropped one member of the Family of Blood (because they too wanted to be immortal).<br><br>I like the irony of the last one. Does anyone have any other suggestions? Whose agents can spare a couple of minutes to help out my agents?</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s an idea - release some sort of massive Biblical demon that feeds on life energy, and, when they&#39;ve killed each other, CUT HER LIPS OFF. That way no bloody Welsh police officers can snog her and bring her back.</p>

            <p>I suspect that RCs continue to be favored because a) they are traditional, b) they make for better story points, and c) they can&#39;t make the agent pair seem overpowered.<br><br>The main differences between TARDIS and RC are that the TARDIS is mobile in space and time and much, much bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside. The RC, on the other hand, is fixed in time (though it&#39;s HQ time, which is rather flexible) and space--you can&#39;t take it into the fic with you and bop around in it like you can with a TARDIS. RCs are also notoriously tiny, though some are better-designed than others. It just depends.<br><br>The thing is--and I&#39;m revealing my bias here--a TARDIS pretty much eliminates the need for some of the usual PPC tech, like a portal device, and it also means that the agents don&#39;t run around through the story on their own legs, whatever shape those legs happen to be at the time. In doing so, it also eliminates many possibilities for an interesting (and funny) mission. If the agents can just sit comfortably in their TARDIS and watch what&#39;s going on around them, what fun is that?<br><br>That said, no one is going to stop you from putting your agents in a TARDIS if you want to when you have Permission... but it will make me sad if you do.<br><br>~Neshomeh, stodgy old traditionalist.</p>

            <p>What if you didn&#39;t give it to the agent in question right away, but let him or her spend a few missions in an RC, wanting a TARDIS? Maybe there&#39;s a shortage for some reason--maybe the Doctor Who continuum called and asked for most of them back, since the Crisis has been over for some time now. I wonder what he or she would do in order to get one. It would be interesting to read about that. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh, who also thinks that instant gratification is no fun.</p>

            <p>He&#39;s one of the tougher Flowers. With his job, he has to be. {= P Anyway, I don&#39;t see any problem with the scenarios you describe. Seems to me the worst that can happen is that the agent will end up passing out from either a lack of oxygen in the first case (followed by a visit to FicPsych and possibly prescription sedatives) or a minor concussion in the second. This sort of thing happens all the time around here. {= )<br><br>As for proving themselves, it seems to me that extremely powerful and unrestricted technology in the hands of someone that unstable is a Bad Idea and something the Flowers would tend to avoid. We wouldn&#39;t want something like <a href="http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/comic.php?current=2253&amp;theme=17&amp;dir=last">this</a> to happen. So, perhaps if they prove themselves, then they can <i>have</i> one.<br><br>... On the other hand, I just got a mental image of a TARDIS with training wheels. I&#39;m not sure how one would put training wheels, metaphorical or otherwise, on a TARDIS, but that&#39;s beside the point. The thing <i>could</i> be programmed to immediately return to HQ and then power down if it senses dangerous levels of insanity in its occupants. Or something.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>There are a few minor goofs in spelling and punctuation, but that&#39;s nothing a beta-reader won&#39;t catch.

One thing you can do to improve that is to listen to people talk, obviously, but another thing you might try is reading aloud to yourself.

            <p>TARDIS&#39; started to be used during the Macrovirus Epidemic because they were moveable whereas RCs are (supposedly) fixed locations.

What I&#39;m saying here is that this person may be open to help. I think she just put the &quot;no negative reviews&quot; thing on because she&#39;s gotten some spam from a troll called EdwardlovesJacob, among others. So what do you think?

            <p>Whether it causes offence or not isn&#39;t quite the point. It&#39;s more that there&#39;s a mutual unspoken agreement to limit swearing, particularly in subject lines. Partly it&#39;s for the look of the thing - we give a better impression to newbies and strangers if we&#39;re using language that&#39;s appropriate for any register, whereas if we&#39;re effing and blinding all over the place it makes us appear more insular and less accessible. And partly it&#39;s because, while we all have the dislike of badfic in common, there&#39;s plenty about each other we don&#39;t all know, and tolerance for expletives is included in that, and so swearing&#39;s kept minimal so as not to offend or alienate those who don&#39;t like it.<br><br>Now glaurunging, on the other hand, that&#39;s an <i>excellent</i> example of language promoting ingrouping. It helps with a sense of identity, and so is permissible in subject lines.<br><br>There you go, there&#39;s my two cents as a linguist. And, if it helps, I don&#39;t consider crap foul language either; most of what I say out loud is pure Anglo-Saxon. It&#39;s just that there&#39;s a time and a place, and subject lines aren&#39;t it.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not saying we should all start dropping f-bombs like Quentin Tarantino characters and such, but there&#39;s also no need to immediately jump on someone for something relatively minor. There&#39;s limiting, and then there&#39;s total suppression, which I assume isn&#39;t what we&#39;re going for. I do see your point, but also don&#39;t entirely agree, especially when it&#39;s a more or less a pretty nonoffensive term. I had some other stuff to say, but I&#39;ve forgot it. Point is, moderation is good, but that goes both ways. Not something worth fighting about.</p>

We all have different standards. If we tried to hash out a list of acceptable and inacceptable words, we&#39;d be here forever and we&#39;d never all agree. So we err on the safe side, and we stick to the unspoken rules of the group, because that way we&#39;re demonstrating mutual respect for everyone in it. And, of course, the converse is true - if we deliberately break the unspoken linguistic conventions of the group, we set ourselves apart from the rest, which isn&#39;t good in terms of social cohesion.<br><br>(Chase, if you&#39;re reading this, I&#39;m not actually having a go.

            <p>Can I just point out that some people do think that &#39;crap&#39; is an offensive word, and therefore may not appreciate seeing it as a subject line, be they a Boarder or a boss/teacher/parent reading over a Boarder&#39;s shoulder at the wrong moment. In blocks of text, such as a main post, it wouldn&#39;t be as noticeable, but when it&#39;s the only word used it is quite noticeable.</p>

(For the record, I&#39;m siding with the fan-authors, etc.)  And I&#39;m having trouble with it, as it&#39;s been hard for me to find references to use, and I have little to no idea what kind of proposal I could make about this.<br><br>So, yeah.

            <p>But you might want to look up the people who&#39;ve banned Fanfiction of their work.  Anne Rice and such.  See what they&#39;re doing to try and stop it.  Another interesting thing to look up would be any authors who actively encourage fanfiction etc., and how.<br><br>What I normally do for my essays is head to wikipedia, scan read, scroll to the bottom and check out the citation links, and any other links.  I mean, fanfiction leads to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_issues_with_fan_fiction"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_issues_with_fan_fiction">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_issues_with_fan_fiction</a></a>, and that has lots of interesting looking links.<br><br>Google books might be worth checking out as well.<br><br>For the proposal, do you just have to present one solution or many possible ones?  Either way, try a spider diagram.  Scribble down all the solutions you can think of an work off them.  The only thing I would point out is that if you&#39;re siding with fan authors then you need to think of what the issue that you need to address is.  Is it checking that people aren&#39;t copying your work word for word or that they&#39;re not making money off it?  The first is easyish to solve (searches for text chunks), the second a little more tough.  If you want a solution to how to stop fan authors altogether, then you really do need to check out Anne Rice etc.<br><br>Good luck.</p>

            <p>I wonder if capitalization is always grammar, though. Sometimes caps or no caps can differentiate between two different things rather than just indicating the function of one thing. For example, Earth is not the same thing as earth. I&#39;d call that a matter of spelling, because the first character marks each word as distinct from the other. On the other hand, the word &quot;on&quot; at the beginning of this sentence carries the same meaning with a lowercase &quot;o,&quot; so the capitalization serves the strictly grammatical purpose of marking the first word of the sentence.<br><br>It may be different in different languages, too. I know that all nouns are always capitalized in German, so in that case it&#39;s definitely linked to grammar.<br><br>It&#39;s an interesting question.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I love these sorts of questions.<br><br>In some ways I guess capitalisation falls under punctuation, because it exists at the start of a sentence in order to give clarity, the same way that commas, full stops and so on do - they don&#39;t change the meaning of the word either (strictly speaking; if a sentence ran on with no commas it could get ambiguous, but to keep it simple...). On the other hand, the apostrophe is definitely a punctuation mark, but it <i>does</i> change the meaning of the word in a similar way to how &quot;Earth&quot; and &quot;earth&quot; are different. <br><br>So where do we draw the lines? :D</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t checked, but I know my fellow Boarders, so you&#39;ve probably been handed a dozen links, and twice as many rules in various forms. However, what a lot of people seem to forget is that trying to set rules for the PPC Board is like trying to herd cats when the cats are on fire and swimming in treacle. Possibly they are also all possessed by insane aliens. In other words, it don&#39;t work, and the results wouldn&#39;t be pretty if it did.<br><br>So. This is the Board. You make threads with the Post Message button, and you reply to posts with the Post Reply button. And then the Board moves along and hopefully people reply to you.<br><br>We have a Constitution. No one ever links to it any more, but it&#39;s still linked at the top of the Board. <a href="http://oddlots.digitalspace.net/PPC/board_constitution.html">Look!</a> We also have a vague rule about not making two threads in a row, or too many in a short period of time, but apart from that -- nothing.

            <p>Lovely to meet you. Here, have a bag of pebbles and Random Shiny Object.<br><br>How this Board works... I assume you mean regarding writing PPC stories. Well, we have a few guidelines that we prefer people to follow.<br><br>First of all, you should hang around for a month, posting and letting everyone get to know you. Then, after that month is up, you post with basic bios of your Agents, a writing sample and a fic you&#39;d like to take on. Then it&#39;s up to the Permission Givers to say yea or nay. If they say yea, then you can sally forth and defend Canon with pride!<br><br>And as for the Canon worlds, you can take on any one you like. We have people covering all sorts, from LOTR to Star Wars to Halo 3. <br><br>Lovely to have you here. I&#39;m sure somebody will be along to throw the relevant links at you in a bit, they&#39;re traditional newbie-gifts.</p>

            <p>Welcome. Here&#39;s a tall ship.<br><br>Pretty much all continua are under protection. Star Wars is a popular example, as are Stargate and other SF universes. Fantasy universes too (Pern, Valdemar, ASoIaF, WoT, SoT, Eragon... and yes even Twilight), as well as TV shows (House, CSI...) and even RPF (actorfic, bandslash, etc.).<br>I just joined and haven&#39;t asked for permission yet, but personally I&#39;ll be protecting Star Wars, Star Trek, Stargate Atlantis, Watchmen, some fantasy universes, House MD, Numb3rs and U2.</p>

            <p>Er, sorry about that...Anyway, hi! Welcome to the Board. Please deposit your sanity in the provided receptacle. *holds out bucket marked &quot;Warg fodder&quot;* We don&#39;t tend to have much use for things like that here. Also, have some hugs and a thermos full of chai tea. Use them well!<br>How the Board works? It works like this. People post topics and other people reply to them. Eventually, old topics are pushed off the page to make room for new ones; for this reason, we tend to frown on making truckloads of new topics. That&#39;s how the Board literally works, but perhaps you were asking for an explanation of how the Boarders work? Well, most of us are completely insane. (See first paragraph.) We&#39;re usually very happy when there are newbies- you will likely be presented with lots and lots of virtual gifties. We natter on about a lot of random stuff and help each other with writing. It&#39;s fun!<br>List of continuums under protection...hurm. It would probably be easier to list all continuums <i>not</i> under protection, but I don&#39;t have a complete list of those either. What I do know is that, although <u>Twit-lit</u>, also known as <u>Twilight</u>, has lots and lots of Mary Sues and badfic written about it, I&#39;ve never seen a PPC mission for it, except when it is crossed-over with another continuum. I can&#39;t speak for the rest of the Boarders, but I personally don&#39;t like said book. If you do, I won&#39;t hold it against you. (Ooh, that reminds me- Have a can of patent Sparklevamp repellent!) <br>Someone will probably come along and give you shiny links to things which will help explain more stuff to you, and they&#39;ll know how to use hyperlinks, so it will be prettier than if I just gave you links. Signing off...<br>-Mad Maudlin</p>

            <p>Hehe, thanks. I&#39;ve not read the Twilight series, but from what I&#39;ve heard having truckloads of MSes around would not surprise me. Some of the continuums I&#39;m interested in protecting:<br><br>Left 4 Dead (There is some BAD fic out there. Apparently some people are under the misimpression that Tanks can be killed with single headshots... from pistols. Erm, no.)<br>Warhammer 40,000 (Because it would be fun. One of the few universes that can pretty much guarantee being capable of delivering something worse that the fic itself when called upon. It&#39;ll probably be within 5 metres too!)<br>Neon Genesis Evangelion (Not sure if there&#39;s much badfic out there. There is definitely SOME, though, in DIRE need of sporking and liberal application of automatic weaponry...)<br><br>As for fanfic *reccomendations*, a good list can be found here:<br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFicRecommendations"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFicRecommendations">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFicRecommendations</a></a><br>It&#39;s where I go to find good fic. Incidentally, it&#39;s also where I came across PPC in the first place; there&#39;s an article on there for it already.<br><br>Meanwhile, it seems I should be trying to invest in a Bag of Holding...</p>

            <p>I like the Inheritance cycle. Not because of Eragon himself, because of Angela. She is totally awesome. I wonder what the real-life Angela thought of the character&#39;s portrayal in the movie? (cross between Tia Dalma and a stripper) Watch out for ferrets!</p>

            <p>Nice to meet you! I... wait, hang on.<br><br>[Shuffles through boxes] I know I&#39;ve got it around here somewhere... aha!<br><br>[Dons a Crotchety Old Man hat; Pulls out a walking stick and starts waving it about]<br><br>Now then you youngster, you listen up well! When I were a lad we didn&#39;t have these Pii Pii See Boards, no siree! We had to write our missions in stone tablets! Uphill both ways, unless that was something else.<br><br>... aaaaanyway.<br><br>If I know my fellow Boarders, you&#39;ve already been bombarded with links, rules, guidelines, recommendations and presents. Well, I&#39;ve been here longer than most of them (hence the walking stick), so I can get away with saying chuck &#39;em all out! Except the presents, obviously.<br><br>While the PPC has certainly gotten very large (some would say cumbersome) over the years, it all started with two people. <i>They&#39;re</i> the ones you need to read about. So if you haven&#39;t already, read <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">Jay and Acacia&#39;s missions</a>.<br><br>Also, since you&#39;re posting on the Board, you need to read <a href="http://oddlots.digitalspace.net/PPC/board_constitution.html">The Constitution</a>. Sadly it&#39;s not signable any more, but still. And that... is it.<br><br>Seriously. You can look over the other stuff too if you want, but the <i>only</i> things you <i>need</i> to read are those. The Board is a place to be silly (again, hence the walking stick), not a world of rules and regs and so on. So relax! And be thankful we don&#39;t have editing access for the Constitution, otherwise it&#39;d be about a hundred times longer now.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Thank you, I&#39;ll read them tomorrow.  Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not changing my mind about the Department of Mary Sues anytime soon.  By the way, is it okay to create OCs if you put them through the OC_analysis on livejournal first to make sure they&#39;re not Sues, or will that only get me kicked out?  No, I&#39;m not talking about my PPC agents.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s perfectly OK, that&#39;s why I did with my Trio. You can have them analyzed, or not, if you wish. But anyway the Permission Givers will check the profiles to see if the future Agents are Sues or not.</p>

            <p>Nice to meet you. Welcome to the Board. Have a bag of pebbles and a Random Shiny Object.<br><br>About posting... well, I think a brief explanation of how the Board works would be a good idea.<br><br>When you arrive, you&#39;re generally asked to hang around on the Board for a month or so, posting and letting people get to know you. During that time, you can develop your Agents and maybe join in any RPs with them.<br><br>Once that month is up, you can post asking for permission to write PPC missions. In that post, you put a brief profile of your Agents, a sample of your writing and maybe the fic you&#39;d like to take on for your first mission. Once that&#39;s done, people will look at it, and if they like it, the Permission Givers will tell you whether or not you&#39;re good to go.<br><br>So basically, you can post profiles of your Agents, but you most likely won&#39;t get permission to write with them just yet.<br><br>Also helpful to know: have you read the Original Series and/or The Reorganisation and Crashing Down? The PPC Wiki is also useful. I&#39;m sure somebody will be along shortly to throw the links at you either way.<br><br>Welcome again.</p>

            <p>Is there any chance that someone could delete this entire post?  I was a little nervous about what I was going to post, so I ended up deciding that I would give fanfics to other users until I can go on my own PPC missions.  I was going to post about my Watchmen OCs, but I wasn&#39;t sure if the board really cared about a fanfic a user was working on.</p>

            <p>We don&#39;t mind people suggesting &#39;fics for people to kill. Nor do we mind people talking about their own fanfics. Of late some people on-Board have seemed a little strict, but we&#39;re not actually like that. So go on, have fun.<br><br>(That said, if you want to talk about your OCs, you might want to stick it onto this thread rather than making a new one -- I mentioned strictness, and recently quite a few people have gotten tetchy about multiple threads by the same person on the front page, especially if it&#39;s two in a row.

            <p>All right, I was reading fanfics written by Rorschach Suethors and I ended up creating this idea.  I was thinking that a girl gets saved by Rorschach and creates this fantasy in her head where she&#39;s a princess and he&#39;s her knight in shining armor.  In reality, he couldn&#39;t care less about her and thinks of her as nothing more than a stalker whore.  Unfortunately, she doesn&#39;t get the hint and let&#39;s just say this fanfic does not have a happy ending.  Here are my OCs if you&#39;re interested.

            <p>That there&#39;s any real formula to a fleshed out character profile, though usually when I do write one it tends to depend on how much I need to keep for reference while I continue the story.<br><br>I think it&#39;s more important for an Original Character rather than a canon for the fact that in most cases people who know the fandom know the character like the back of their hand. And you would figure that it should be more likely for someone making up their own character, but the originality and the familiarity one may have with a new character may go through different stages, just like someone would go through multiple edits on a story.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d find it overkill, but I would start with a biography for her, describing some times in her past, little things that may give you something to draw from or to derive how she would act in a given situation. A quick sheet of the effects of nature and nurture that everyone should have to make a person who they are.<br><br>Things like her age, which could help you figure out how her dialogue should go. <br><br>Then keep it on hand when you do write your story, and keep the Watchmen volume with you as well. I would also suggest jumping into a little bit of V for Vendetta to get Alan Moore&#39;s dialogue style for both characters: they&#39;re both very set in a particular moral base but you can almost compare the two and be able to figure that they&#39;re not going to sound alike. While both are vigilantes, V does not look at particular people under a microscope, unlike Rorschach.<br><br>Sorry, kind of droned on there, I hope you got what I was going for in there.</p>

            <p>Well, I already have some of her background planned.  I just didn&#39;t want to put too much information in the OC_Analysis because I didn&#39;t want to give any spoilers away.  Not to sound rude, but I have discussed Rachel&#39;s more fleshed out background with a beta-reader and she is very good at pointing out Sues.  She even has her own livejournal account that&#39;s soul purpose is sporking Ledger!Joker Sues.  Plus, I kind of want to hint to my character&#39;s background throughout the story while exploring the depths of her sanity.  When Rachel&#39;s sanity is completely shattered, the story ends.  I&#39;m just glad that you see some potential in my character.  It means that you don&#39;t think she&#39;s a Sue.</p>

            <p>The profile would be for your benefit and your beta reader&#39;s alone. I&#39;m not saying post the whole thing on your livejournal, especially if you&#39;re trying to weave a story that is majorly based on your character development. I stand by my suggestion that it would greatly benefit you to do that, though it&#39;s up to you whether you do or not.<br><br>But I can&#39;t give my opinion based on what you do have as to whether she&#39;s a Sue or not. Your beta-reader sounds very qualified in deciding which is good. Go with that and take heed to his/her advice; I haven&#39;t met an Alan Moore fan yet that has completely missed the point. <br><br>I wish you good luck with this, it&#39;d be great to read a successful OC Watchmen fic.</p>

            <p>Thank you.  I wasn&#39;t going to write this at first, but my beta-reader insisted I write the fanfic, because its primary purpose is to show the effect of mad obsessive love on people.</p>

            <p>I know nothing about Watchmen, so I can&#39;t help you there.<br><br>I would just like to point out that, due to the nature of the Board, it isn&#39;t very polite to keep making fresh topics every time you have something new to say. You could have added this to either one of the two topics you already have on the front page.</p>
