            <p>hS told me I had to get a beta to make sure I kept within PPC canon. I&#39;m coming to the end of the first chapter of my first mission, and I&#39;d like to run it past someone so I can upload it. The fic is a three-way crossover between Harry Potter, Young Wizards and LotR.</p>

            <p>Hey, just so you know, usually on the Board we try to discourage posting topics directly one after another. That&#39;s just because, like you noticed on asking about changing sites, old topics get pushed off of the bottom, and eventually disappear completely. It&#39;s no big deal now and then, but just so you know, to save space, we try to not post too many original topics on top of each other.<br><br>Also, congratulations on writing your first mission! (I don&#39;t know Young Wizards, and it looks like you&#39;ve got a beta already) but good job! </p>

            <p>It&#39;s not just the Midlands, Pads. ITV news had one of their reporters showing the street sign at one end of a street in London with an apostrophe placed correctly, but missing at the other end. The same reporter asked three pedestrians outside King&#39;s Cross the meaning of the apostrophe in the sign for that station, and only one got it correct. <s>I&#39;m not sure where the first guy wanted to put the apostrophe, and the woman wanted to modify it to &#39;Kings&#39; Cross&#39;.</s></p>

            <p>Dropping the . after Mr and Mrs is one of those examples of language evolving, similar to how we&#39;re currently in the process of doing away with the hyphen.

            <p>Funny thing, that, the clearing of ambiguity. English is already unusual in that word order is of paramount importance, thanks to our dislike of declensions. You lose the hyphen, and word order becomes even more important. So I like it, in a way. Losing the hyphen further distinguishes English from other, declining languages. (And by Glod I hate declining things. Old Norse this semester is going to be <i>murder</i>.)</p>

            <p>I would assume the designers would have allowed for all normal species types.  Your average Space Marine is about 8 feet tall with power armor.  9 feet tall with Tactical Dreadnought (Terminator) armor.  Probably would have to stoop, though.</p>

            <p>It seems to me that the halls ought to be as wide as is best for the situation. If it would be funny for the Marine (and, by the way, I know of at least three canons offhand that use that same terminology, all of which have different sizes of armor.

<br><ul>A thread or two asking about operating procedure in certain cases</ul>

<br><br>How can any of those except maybe this one possibly be construed as complaining? I don&#39;t quite understand how this one is complaining either - it was an honest question, to which I got an answer, and I am content with the answer. The screen stretchy eye bleedy comment was largely tongue in cheek, though I recognise the difficulty of inferring tone of voice over the Internet.</p>

I&#39;m going to the cafeteria, see if there&#39;s anyone who knows what&#39;s going on,&quot; Ansela opened the door and grinned at Risa. &quot;Want me to get you anything?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I would appreciate it if you would find some clothing that does not look like it will fall off as soon as you do so much as breath deeply.&quot;<br><br>Ansela nodded. &quot;Will do.&quot;</p>

            <p>Why is it, that in just about every fandom or such-like that I have looked into, gender-bending has cropped up?<br>Not that I mind, since, thanks to a certain trope associated with genderbending, the results are usually pleasing to the eye.<br>It doesn&#39;t hurt that I hold a passing interest in genderbending myself, but who&#39;s paying attention to that?</p>

            <p>Not sure when it&#39;d be set because the mission I&#39;ve just done was around November 2007, so it&#39;d be either then or present day. Without getting too spoilery, Laburnum and Drake are going to keep genderbending on occasion when off-duty for a while - she out of curiosity and because she wants to spend some time being someone else (because she has unresolved self-loathing issues left over from buggering up the Nighthunt fiasco), he because he has a creepy transformation fixation - so we could work on it somehow.</p>

            <p>Although PPC RPs are great fun, I don&#39;t think they need to be as common as they are. Wouldn&#39;t it be more interesting -- and easier to keep track of afterwards, since RP transcripts tend to be very difficult to write up -- to let people write their own stories about the events and link them all from a central page? Then anyone who wanted to collaborate, either by writing a story together or by writing two that interacted with one another, could do so, and anyone who just wanted to write their own story could do that, too.<br><br>Just a suggestion, obviously, but...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;d be interested in expanding the event, actually, and making the solution a little more difficult to achieve. Maybe the DORKS isn&#39;t the cause of the problem after all, or something. I don&#39;t know. For me, it&#39;s an excuse to develop Nume&#39;s character and possibly reveal some things I might not be able to otherwise simply because I can&#39;t think of a normal situation in which he&#39;d ever let them come up. For that reason, it&#39;s better to have him (her) interacting with people other than Ilraen. That&#39;s my motivation.<br><br>&#39;Course, I also think it would be fun to learn Dafydd and Constance&#39;s reason(s) for being back in HQ just in time for this.

            <p>The sue is carrying sue cooties. the orignal genderbending portal was caused by a prototype console that was corrupted by a sue in a fic. so it is sue technology, and thus odd. and old PPC technology, so it might have locked onto the flash badges of the agents, and modifiyed the SEPF gendertors somehow. so while the DORKS was the original cause, the returning everyone ot normal might take longer.</p>

            <p>OOC: Dunno if I should post this here or in a different subthread, but I&#39;ll just post my Agents&#39; responses. This is set after my Agents&#39; latest, in-progress mission(#3 OOC, #6 IC).<br><br>There was a low pitched humming noise as a glowing portal appeared in the middle of RC-1138B. A dull thump quickly followed as an exhausted, soot-covered Alex Warren fell through it and landed heavily on the sofa. Hugging a cushion with one arm, he massaged his temple with the other. &quot;Never, never again...&quot; he groaned into the cushion. He looked up from the sofa as an equally battered but still standing Drental stepped through, holding a backpack that was bulging slightly at the seams. Alex&#39;s eyes narrowed as he saw glitter stains seeping through his bag.<br><br>&quot;Drental, you didn&#39;t put the Sue&#39;s scalp in my bag, did you?&quot;<br><br>The Mandalorian Agent shrugged, causing Alex to start spluttering.<br><br>&quot;Drental, all my stuff&#39;s in there!&quot;<br><br>Drental shrugged again.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not like a little glitter will damage it.&quot;<br><br>Right on cue, the Overpower caused the Suvian blood to start burning a hole in Alex&#39;s prized ROTS novelization. It then waited for Alex to give it its next cue.<br><br>Alex opened and closed his mouth several times, then closed it when he couldn&#39;t think of a good counterargument. A moment of silence later, he sat up and looked at his partner.<br><br>&quot;Seriously though, that thing was a nightmare. Grievous, droids, and a regenerating Sue at the same time. Why the hell didn&#39;t they list that on the report?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The writer went mad and thinks he&#39;s a rubber duck now, remember?&quot; Drental replied dryly.<br><br>&quot;And the first person and body change...Honestly, I hope that never happens to us again.&quot;<br><br>Pop.<br><br>Alex sighed, looking down at herself for a moment before going back to her previous position on the sofa. Drental, meanwhile, simply shrugged and continued taking off his now somewhat uncomfortable armour.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;d think I would have learned to keep my mouth shut by now,&quot; Alex mused. There were shouts from outside, and Alex blinked.<br><br>&quot;Looks like we&#39;re not the only ones...&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Drake, I shall be cruel to be kind,&quot; explained the weasel, grinning ominously. &quot;On a scale of bad ideas, the idea of &#39;messing&#39; with this thing would be somewhere between walking around an OFU with one&#39;s sex changed without telling anyone and trying to store a poisonous snake in one&#39;s pocket. Thou hast already done the former. Please do not move further along the scale.&quot;</p>

            <p>Alex poked her head out of the RC&#39;s doorway, looking from side to side. As she watched, a scantily clad fox holding a box of ramen noodles ran past followed by a group of very angry Agents yelling at the top of their lungs. Shaking her head, Alex stepped back inside. A moment later, a flaming frisbee whistled past the doorway where her head had been a moment earlier and she hastily closed the door. Drental watched all this with some amusement from the console chair. <br><br>&quot;Going somewhere?&quot;<br><br>Alex shook her head.<br><br>&quot;Chances are Medical&#39;s clogged up, and it&#39;ll get cleared up eventually. Besides,&quot; Alex said, a smile spreading across her face. &quot;it&#39;s not like we&#39;ll get a mission until this is over.&quot;<br><br>&quot;True.&quot;<br><br>Walking over to a table standing next to the bathroom door, Alex picked up one of several stacks of books piled up on it. Glancing at his partner, Drental noted titles such as &quot;Your Mind Makes It Real: How To Use Generic Substance&quot;, &quot;Dalek: A Complete History&quot; and &quot;100 Ways To Kill a Warrior! Sue&quot;. Falling heavily onto the sofa, Alex opened up the first book and began reading, dead to the world.<br><br></p>

            <p>I seem to recall his voice breaking during the filming of LWW and his sister having to do some of his lines. Whether our agents would know the difference between hebephilia, ephebophilia and paedophilia is another matter. Whether the author realised James McAvoy is in fact married to a 38 year old woman is also another matter.</p>

Not that I&#39;m a great example these days), check up on PPC proceedure as described in, at minimum, the Original Series, and try again in a little while.<br><br>On the positive side, not that that&#39;s particularly negative, your agents do look interesting, and their interaction (what I read before I started skimming to check how much bold there was) looks good.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>For being receptive to feedback. It always makes me happy when new people handle themselves so well. <sup>_<sup><br><br>This</sup></sup> may seem like hypocrisy, but it&#39;s generally not a good idea to let anyone else tell you when you&#39;re ready to show your work.

            <p>..that the point Neshomeh was getting at is that you&#39;ve put great chinks of the fic itself in the mission. When it&#39;s as NSFW as that (although I&#39;m not suggesting this is gospel, I am after all but a newbie) I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really necessary to have all the explicit detail there. You can sort of skirt the issue by having either reactions or just by removing the excerpt and describing events less explicitly.<br><br>It also isn&#39;t necessary to have that much of the badfic itself in there, so far as I&#39;m aware of.

            <p>There&#39;s actually little to no quoting of the original badfic in the Original Series, if I remember right. Mostly they just paraphrase what happens in the badfic in such a way as to highlight how ridiculous it is. The humorous paraphrase is a skill I&#39;m working on in my own missions.<br><br>~Neshomeh, possibly one of the least prolific writers around as compared to others who have been around about as long.</p>

            <p>Ah, the paraphrases. Always a good thing. And we certainly need a lot of &#39;em in Bad Slash, else our readership would be limited to about three people. But occasionally one comes across a line that just needs to be quoted in its entirety, for the WTF points.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t want to freak anybody out if this is just happening to me, but I&#39;ve noticed over the past few months that my malware protection software, Sophos, has been catching rather a lot of Trojans (especially seeing as I&#39;ve never had any problems before), and it seems to happen most often when I&#39;m here. I&#39;ve also noticed it when I&#39;m on deviantART, though. What happens is that I&#39;ll click on a link to go somewhere and a little box from Sophos will pop up telling me it&#39;s quarantined a Trojan. Meanwhile, I&#39;ll get a blue screen in my browser, Firefox 3.0.5, that tells me the action was illegal and blocked by something-or-other. I&#39;ve gotten Adobe randomly opening and telling me it can&#39;t open a file because the file is damaged--Sophos doesn&#39;t like that, either.<br><br>I bring this up now because I just had the page I was looking at randomly turn to an X-Box ad twice. Clicking Back returned me to what I was looking at. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s up with that. Sophos didn&#39;t have anything to say about it.<br><br>So, clearly I need to take my laptop to campus&#39; IT department and have them take a look at her, but I wanted to mention it just in case anyone else is noticing the same kinds of things, or in case they aren&#39;t noticing and they should be. I suspect it&#39;s related to the kinds of ads we get here, but I really have no idea. Any information would be really helpful.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... yeah, couldn&#39;t resist that. Let&#39;s see now.<br><br>I&#39;m rather worried by the description of Mulhoon as a &quot;legend&quot;. In fact, this section:<br><br><i>Mulhoon was something of a legend in the PPC, as being near impossible to disturb. He was regularly sent on missions to the most graphic fics, and rarely if ever actually took Bleeprin.</i><br><br>... concerns me. It <i>is</i> possible to make a &#39;Sue or &#39;Stu in the PPC, and being undisturbable is one way to do so. So is claiming to be legendary -- I did that once, but later rewrote that passage to indicate that the agents in question thought /themselves/ legendary, while leaving the actual state of affairs open. The obvious question is, if he&#39;s a legend, why has no one ever talked about him before now?<br><br>So I don&#39;t know. On the flip side, I <i>do</i> like Render. He&#39;s well characterised, and looks like he could develop well. So... yeah, I don&#39;t know. Those are my comments, but I&#39;m not going to make a decision. I&#39;ll leave it open for someone else to say yea or nay. Or yay! or neigh! depending on their preferences.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I was planning on being very careful that Mulhoon didn&#39;t become too good to be true. Certainly he&#39;s not immune to the effects of Mary Sues on the average agent, and he&#39;ll probably have a fairly strong aversion to abuse of the English language. What I meant to convey with that section is that he can go to a fic with graphic violence of particuary bad slash and not feel the need to throw up. Disturb is not actually precisely the word I want - &quot;squick&quot; would be more accurate there, but I have a slightly more formal writing style, and I&#39;d prefer not to use colloquialisms in narrative text.<br><br>As for the question of why he&#39;s not turned up in previous stories if he&#39;s so legendary, I&#39;d honestly not thought of that. I&#39;ll probably change that bit then. I might also have to change the bit about being sent to the most graphic fics reguarly, simply because I can&#39;t find any particularly graphic ones in the fandoms I&#39;m most conversant with!</p>

            <p>On reading over the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/2008_Mary_Sue_Invasion#Links">collected roleplay</a>, I noticed that Morgan&#39;s partner&#39;s name has been misspelled on the two occasions she&#39;s mentioned. She should be Traf, not Tarff, and I&#39;m not sure how that happened, since I know I would&#39;ve noticed if July&#39;s reply had had that incorrect version. Anyway, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s carried over into your scripts. It&#39;s not a <i>big</i> problem (and to be honest no one other than me will notice :P) but, yeah.<br><br>hS, helpfully annoying</p>

            <p>I thought you wouldn&#39;t. :P<br><br>They&#39;re very quiet. For scene 2 I had to have my headphones on and volume to maximum, and that was about the volume I&#39;d expect it to be at normal level. So you&#39;ll definitely need to up the volume when you finalise them. Other than that, the intro&#39;s good. Very ominous. :P<br><br>Scene 3, a bit louder (good). Obviously the tracks need fiddling a bit, as you say (might I recommend you pay particular attention to the slight click on and off on each clip? A very brief fade effect might help with that, or if you can find a static removing function that&#39;d be even better).  At the moment my ears are too busy adjusting to the sudden background hiss to understand much of what Tess is saying. And. Er. The third voice later is either Tess with a reverb on or a Flower. I can&#39;t tell which, and I can&#39;t actually make out anything it says. So. Yeah.<br><br>Scene 5 is great, and I don&#39;t just say that because I wrote it. :P Obviously some of that is the fact that it&#39;s a single microphone not having to change, but it&#39;s at a decent volume and I can understand it. It&#39;s rather spooky without context, but that comes later.<br><br>Scene 6: decent volume, I can understand most of it, but there&#39;s a lot of variation in how the voices sound. Not so much a problem when you&#39;ve got visuals, but at the moment it sounds like there&#39;s about five people there. And, again, the differing background noises leave that slight delay in understanding.<br><br>As a note on that, you could try adding a single background noise to the entire scene (air conditioning or something :P), and then including a slight (quarter second, even) fade at the beginning and end of each line. That&#39;d make the backgrounds less noticable, and might facilitate understanding.<br><br>Ah, if only audio editing was as easy as fiddling with pictures...<br><br>Scene 39 I&#39;ve heard before, but somehow sounds better now. Not sure whether you&#39;ve edited or not. It still has slight clicks at the end of lines, but a bit of background noise (which is basically required for the Tomb) will mask that perfectly. And I can understand the Flower, too. So I have only good things to say about that scene. And it makes the problems I noted with the previous ones look likely to go byebye. So good. ;)<br><br>I&#39;d offer my help for editing the audio here, but I suspect you&#39;ve got it pretty much in hand. If you do need me to help out, though, well, you know where I am.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Audio effects are still being fiddled with, so comments like these are very helpful and will definitely be taken on board :)<br><br>You&#39;re right, I&#39;m hoping that the addition of the visuals will help differentiate between everyone&#39;s voices, but as it is I&#39;m going to need to recut Scene 5 anyway - the disparities between how the two actors recorded their lines and then how I had to pitch-alter one of them for some reason confuses Audacity mightily and meant a need for some serious fiddling around with rates ... so that one&#39;s in line for probably the most drastic alteration.<br><br></p>

            <p>Okay, so it seems to me that the best plan will be to *standardise* the volume across scenes, at least, and to try and do even more noise removal. <br><br>The echo effect for the Flowers/psychics definitely needs work, agreed. I&#39;ll see what I can do about toning it down.</p>

            <p>Cos I&#39;ve found two BSG fics with OCs in them, and I want to know if any of you think they&#39;re Mary Sues or just borderline.

            <p>I used to like BSG, but I&#39;ve sort of fallen off the wagon in the past... er... four, five years? <sup><sup>;<br><br>The</sup></sup> first one is almost certainly a &#39;Sue, though.

            <p>That is, if no one else decides to be brave. Although Trojie and I aren&#39;t actually feeling all that masochistic at the moment, and we can&#39;t understand this whole Teatime/Carcer thing either. So we&#39;ll consider taking missions one and three if and only if no one else will take them. <br><br>The Bad Het one&#39;s rather more of a possibility, since it&#39;s actually got grammar and line breaks.

            <p>Technically it&#39;s only Agent Trojie who&#39;s banned from the Disc. Pads is allowed in ... <br><br>Also, our malfunctioning attempt to steal missions we want could probably throw one of them up, at least. They&#39;d probably get caught, though.

            <p>Found this over on <b>scans<em>daily</b>. You have to wonder about the intelligence of American bureaucrats sometimes. The entire thing is as posted, with no edits by myself. (I.e., I am not to blame for any spelling or grammar errors.)<br><br>--<br><br>CPSIA sounds like a supervillian plot. Unfortunately this law is all too real... How can one US law result in censorship, banning kids from libraries, bankrupt schools, cultural genocide, and taking away vital items from the disabled?<br><br>Oh yeah, and may result in many comic series being canceled of significantly increasing the price. And absolutely crushing many small presses. Censorship under another name.<br><br>Read on beyond the cut... prepare to be angry and disbelieving.<br><br>The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA H.R. 4040) had a good goal: protect kids from dangerous imports tainted with lead. Bravo! Unfortunately it goes about doing so in such a way that it’ll drive up costs across the board, drive many manufacturers and retailers out of business, and not really make kids any safer. And will mean many kids comics cease production.<br><br>Oh yeah, and throw in bankrupting schools, forcing libraries to ban children, and taking away products from the disabled.<br><br>So what does CPSIA do? It mandates lead testing for ALL items intended for children under 13 or PERCEIVED as being for those under age 13. So items commonly regarded as “kids stuff” even if it is intended for adults, such as many comics, plushes, animation, collectible action figures, etc, still falls under the statute even though they’re aimed at adult collectors.<br><br>It requires UNIT testing. The final product must be tested from each batch. It doesn’t matter if all the components going into it are certified and have been tested as having no lead, it still must be tested for lead. This includes even things made entirely out of certified organic products!<br><br>Here’s an example. You publish comics for kids. You&#39;re a small publisher and print two different comics with all the same materials, on the same day, on the same press, with the same crew manning it. You must test Captain Awesome and the Miss Amazing separately because they may contain lead!<br><br>This basically seems to imply that somehow alchemy works. Non-lead containing item + non-lead containing item= LEAD! It also implies that somehow a different arrangement of the words and pictures inside will generate lead.<br><br>And let&#39;s not forget that CPSIA also covers things PERCEIVED as being for those 12 and under. Which covers virtually all the comics except the porn. Comics are considered kids stuff. There&#39;s 0% lead risk from reading comics.<br><br>The manufacturer needs to provide a testing certificate to the retailer, which must be available for inspection, should a Consumer Product Safety Administration inspector come in. No certificate, the retailer can’t sell it. (watch many recent back issues vanish from your comic shop come February)<br><br>Objects without a certification have to be tested. So those copies of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows that were printed in 2007 that are still available new at Amazon may have to be destroyed as of February 10th 2009 because they haven’t been tested for lead. (Amazon is taking this seriously and sent a mail to all affiliates asking them to provide the lead testing certificates for all items)<br><br>How bad can the punishment be? For selling books and comics? Up to $100,000 PER ITEM and up to five years in jail. It’s also a felony. Get busted, you may lose your right to vote in some states. Even if you can fight it in court, you’ll likely go broke doing so and your local newspaper will carry the headline “Local business selling lead tainted goods”… even though you know they aren’t. Good luck getting them to print the retraction months or years later after that PR disaster.<br><br>This includes not just selling, but distribution. So you can’t donate the untested goods to your local library, Good Will, or literacy program. You also can’t sell them to overseas collectors either, as they’re illegal to export. (preventing dumping of truly toxic goods on third world markets is one of the few good portions of this law. Good job on that, bad job on the rest)<br><br>The American Library Association is FURIOUS because this basically means as of February 10th, they can&#39;t lend children&#39;s books... or they&#39;ll have to ban kids from libraries. <a href="http://www.wo.ala.org/districtdispatch/?p=1573">the press release from the American Library Association</a><br><br>Is our children learning?<br><br>The law also has an inherent flaw: it assumes that laws weren&#39;t strict enough. It&#39;s not the laws weren&#39;t strict enough, it&#39;s that the existing ones weren&#39;t enforced!<br><br>The original problem was lead in Chinese imports. China&#39;s lead standard is stricter the US. It was at the time of the problem. (it&#39;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/business/worldbusiness/11lead.html">90 PPM</a> US standard is now 600PPM) The Chinese just aren&#39;t enforcing it. Or they&#39;re outright forging the documents. Or finding ways to game the test. The entire melamine fiasco was due to them gaming a different test. cheating to get around the test produced the problem!<br><br>CPSIA requires additional third party testing and documentation. Easily forged documentation. And self-reporting. Criminals do not report their crimes to the police! Assuming they will do so is absolute IDIOCY!<br><br>The original problem will still be there, it&#39;ll just now be even harder to find due to the mountain of unneccessary paperwork! Testing items that have never had any problem with lead for lead is like looking for terrorists in Antarctica. Sure, it looks like you&#39;re being thorough, but its just wasting time and money that could be used actually dealing with the problem.<br><br>What to do? Write your Congressman. You can look up the mailing info for your Congressman and Senators through <a href="http://www.wo.ala.org/districtdispatch/?p=1573">House.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate.gov</a> Call them on the phone too!

            <p>But yes, generally brass (and electroplate-over-brass, if the electroplate is worn) will discolour your skin green if it&#39;s snug against your skin and you a) sweat a bit or b) have what the jeweller I talked to referred to as &#39;weird skin pH&#39; (I haven&#39;t investigated yet to see if it IS a pH issue, so take that with a grain of salt) and, like me, cause every metal except gold to tarnish and leave colourful residues on your skin. I *used* to wear about half a pound of assorted metals on my wrists, until I realised that the amount of black and green on my skin made it look like I was a victim of domestic abuse.

            <p>Without being too spoilery, it&#39;s going to set the foundation for a little bit of a longer storyline later in the OFUR year, so I want to get it right.<br><br>Speaking of getting it right, I have a potential joke based on Asian folklore and I don&#39;t know if it would come across as odd to use it. See, this mission is set pre-Macrovirus, so Makes-Things would still be around, and according to the Wiki he was born in Korea. Agent Drake is a vulpine shapeshifter from an anime continuum, therefore he is to all intents and purposes a kitsune. The Korean relative of the kitsune is the kumiho, which is axe-crazy evil and eats people. Drake is not any more evil than most assassins and does not eat non-Sue people, but the railgun might make people wonder about the &quot;axe-crazy&quot; bit. I was thinking of Makes-Things asking Drake if he&#39;s sure he&#39;s not a kumiho after Drake expresses some inclination towards violent behaviour. Does this sound okay?</p>

            <p>After skulking about here for six and half months or so, occasionally talking with folks I have finally acquired enough nerve ask for Permission (I kidnapped someone and stole their nerve).<br><br>My agents:<br><br>Jane Shackleton<br>Age: early thirties<br>Appearance: impeccable, but not particularly attractive. Dark hair and eyes, pale skin. She has a normal sized body, but she wears a corset, so her waist is immpossibly small.  <br>Jane is a product of an ill-defined story set, due to the author&#39;s scanty knowledge of history, somewhere between the Regency and Victorian Eras. She has an obsession with manners and propriety, a penchant for pretty looking guns and lethal fans (the kind used too cool oneself, not the rabid kind), as well as a horror of technology. She refuses to even touch the consul. Jane is also a somewhat competent witch and has a secret desire to be a Jane Austen heroine, though she is more inclined towards a woman like Miss Bingley. <br><br>Oliver Shackleton<br>Age: late twenties<br>Appearance: medium height, stocky with dark unruly hair. He has glasses and is blind as a bat without them.<br>Oliver entirely under the thumb of his elder sister. His argues with her constantly, but always acquiesces to her requests. He used to swear like a sailor, but, due to a spell of his sister&#39;s, can&#39;t swear any longer and has to use substitutes, which infuriates him greatly. Under the influence of fellow PPCers, Oliver has become more modern, in both language and behavior, much to his sister&#39;s distress. He is also hopeless with technology, but since his sister refuses to deal with it, he has to.<br><br>Moren Armstrong Crewe III<br>Age: eighteen<br>Appearance: pale, lanky and entirely nondescript, usefuly for blending into the background which he would do admirably if he weren&#39;t so clumsy.<br>Moren stumbled upon the PPC while being chased by bullies from his private school. He is timid and clumsy. Violence makes him sick and he is currently unaware of how the Department of Mary Sues disposes of said Sues. Apparently, Marquis de Sod did not think to inform him.<br><br>I presume sibling teams would be frowned upon at the PPC. Upstairs has enough insanity to deal with, without that. But Jane and Oliver come as a pair. You can&#39;t get one without the other.<br><br>My writing sample is here: <br><br><a href="http://helenofpylos.livejournal.com/"><a href="http://helenofpylos.livejournal.com/">http://helenofpylos.livejournal.com/</a></a><br><br>And feedback is always appreciated.<br><br>Helen</p>

            <p>The type of witch she is, has to do with her past, and I haven&#39;t really gone into that yet, but mostly her power extends to keeping her hair in place when combating a Sue. A clearer explanation of the spell itself will come out as Moren becomes comfortable enough to ask.<br><br>I&#39;m not quite certain what you&#39;re asking with your second question, but if it&#39;s what I think, then Jane is being contradictory.

            <p>A &quot;consul&quot; is an overseas diplomatic position which is often part of an embassy. The term &quot;console&quot; (the part of a pipe organ where the organist sits) is old enough that Jane would be familiar with it. I&#39;d believe that she could mis-hear &quot;you&#39;ll get your assignment from the console&quot; as &quot;...from the consul&quot; the first time at least, but it shouldn&#39;t be a totally new term.<br><br>..or maybe I&#39;m overanalyzing a typo.<br><br>Also, I&#39;m pretty sure the Marquis de Sod needs the &quot;the&quot; at the front of his name - Marquis is a title, after all, rather than a first name.<br><br>Permission is granted, but I would suggest getting a beta who is at least somewhat familiar with the PPC.</p>

            <p>The DCPS (Department of Character Protective Services) assigns agents to individual canon characters. The DOOCH (Department of Out-of-Character Hobbits) deals with cases involving hobbits in general. It&#39;s run by the Authoritative Elanor (I think), wears green uniforms, and is tacitly ignored by the rest of HQ. The staff include the infamous Yellow Roses, which explains a lot. :P<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think it depends on your interpretation. If the characters are so OOC that they may have been replaced by other people, and these other people seem Mary Sues (or at least one of them), then the DMS could still handle it. It&#39;s a case of character replacement. Look for plotholes where the canons may be hiding and then charge and kill the Sues.<br><br>Oh, and floaters seem to handle pretty much anything.</p>

            <p>And probably, if there isn&#39;t a method in-canon, by importing something useful from out of canon and throwing logic at it.

Hmm.&quot;<br><br>:P I got fired a while ago for being too good. <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4763715/1/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4763715/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4763715/1/</a></a> She&#39;s improved a bit in the later chapters, but she wouldn&#39;t listen to any of my comments that &#39;this makes no sense at all&#39; and &#39;the characters suck&#39;.</p>

            <p>Which means not PPCing the work yourself. It&#39;s too easy for her to find it, and that&#39;ll just make things worse; the last thing you want is her throwing a fit at you personally. <br><br>I&#39;d say toss it out for another PPCer to pick up and wash your hands of her work. It&#39;ll keep her from being wounded - perhaps far more deeply than if you were a random stranger - and preserve your reputation. Someone around here will deal with it. :)</p>

One of my first thoughts when she asked me to beta was &quot;dang, now I can&#39;t PPC her stuff anymore&quot;.

            <p>Show us the link and if the rest of the PPC Hive Mind agrees, someone will probably PPC it. Alternatively, one of us might try to take over your role in supervising her fics, seeing as how you two have fallen out. She has shown some willingness to revise her stories, which is more than most Suethors, so I&#39;d go easy on her for a little while longer--see if we can&#39;t bring her back to the straight and narrow.<br><br>What&#39;s the fandom, by the way?

            <p><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1070129/doctors_gal_1792"> Doctor&#39;s Gal 1792</a>. <br><br>The story I betead was the fifth chapter of &quot;Before the Worst&quot;. Incidentally, in her request to me she mentioned that her other beta had abondoned her. There may be something of a patern there.<br><br>The story I would be interested in PPCing is &quot;The Lost Daughter&quot;. It has an interesting premise, but in my opinion the author screws it up by having the lost daughter and her dad bonding from the moment they meet. Which I feel unlikely since (a) the dad thought she died 100 years previously, and (b) she is now working for an organisation he hates. Also, around chapter seven or eight, the author introduces a friend of hers as bit character.<br><br>Those two stories are both Torchwood. The author has also written a few others (that might be Sue worthy, I haven&#39;t checked) in that fandom. A few stories in Doctor Who (among others one where she retells the story of &quot;Titanic&quot; with 10 and Rose in the roles of Jack and Rose; that&#39;s got to be good).<br>And some stories for Titanic and Enchanted. </p>

            <p>&quot;Before the Worst&quot; is passable, and could possibly be shaped into something decent. I can&#39;t see it becoming a masterpiece, but hey, baby steps. I&#39;ll give her a review and see what happens.<br><br>I don&#39;t know much about Titantic, but from a Whovian perspective, the story is... I&#39;m sorry, I just can&#39;t see the Doctor sitting around and moping about how lonely he is and how he needs a soulmate to share his life with <i>while Jack is on board the TARDIS</i>.  Beyond the fact that the Doctor generally keeps his angst to himself, I feel a strong urge to point out that Jack would happily be his &quot;best mate to the one person he really loved.&quot; Actually, I&#39;m not sure what that means, but you get the idea.<br><br>I&#39;d still recommend you placing up the stories on &quot;Fics-to-be-killed,&quot; seeing how you&#39;ve been involved in her affairs. Surely there are other Whovian Agents in the PPC?</p>

            <p>It was a good thought -- besides, how&#39;s she going to learn if someone does it all for her? I never learned things that way. : |<br><br>Anyway, IMO, it would be at least somewhat petty to PPC any of her &#39;fics. You&#39;ve a good rule of thumb there, methinks.
