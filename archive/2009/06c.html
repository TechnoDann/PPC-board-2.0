            <p>Just trying to hash out a date in plenty of time. If everyone wants to do the karaoke bar, it needs to be booked well in advance, so we need to pick a date fairly soon. First week in September is looking good so far. Are there any dates anyone absolutely can&#39;t do?</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll give it a tentative yes, dependent on what happens over the next month or so. If I&#39;m going I&#39;ll be there by then, put it that way. And if I&#39;m not, it&#39;s only a fiver on the bus. It&#39;s just that the weekend previous I&#39;d likely be moving if the Plan works.</p>

            <p>So. While wandering about The Pit, I stumbled upon this: <br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4838206/1/Desolee"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4838206/1/Desolee">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4838206/1/Desolee</a></a><br><br>The protagonist is a blatant Sue under the Oh So Average American name of Desole&#39;e Litu&#39;an. She has &quot;Rainbow eyes&quot; and long black hair (that it hurts her to cut, literally), and, oh, the angst, cannot speak. <br><br>And, for once, I am annoyed that there isn&#39;t more to the story, because to the point that it&#39;s been written, it hasn&#39;t entered the Canon which she&#39;s destined to fall into from the Real World. <br><br>Which means we can&#39;t kill her yet... <br><br>*Lurks around the page for it to update so she can pounce with a large hammer* <br><br>Just felt I had to share my frustration/agony with the rest of you... </p>

            <p>Kill, kill, kill! It&#39;s too bad that the story hasn&#39;t moved on. Who wants to bet that miss &quot;Rainbow Eyes&quot; ends up trying to get Briar or Pershan? (Though, if she does, I&#39;ll be inclined to donate a machete for her killing. Leave the Canon Characters alone, Suethors. Not that they listen.) Anyway, why are there all of these little archives for the Circle of Magic, Circle Opens, and Will of the Empress? There&#39;s already a Tamora Pierce archive...</p>

            <p>Basically, the reason that there are all these little one-story archives is because the authors are Stupid. I&#39;m guessing that yes, she&#39;s going to go after Briar. Which will be amusing to watch. In the most sickening manner. </p>

            <p>I wish that once, just once, that fangirls would write a fanfic about their LO, <b>without</b> having someone fall in love with them. Or maybe they shouldn&#39;t write at all.

            <p>Sorry. I guess I meant the Suethor kind of fangirl. I just hate to see the characters from my books turned silly and lovesick for any Sue (or Stu) that happens to walk past them. I don&#39;t mind them writing about the Canon, but when they start writing in Sues/Stus and completely change the Canon Character&#39;s personalities, that&#39;s where I draw the line. No offense intended for the fangirls that don&#39;t write about Sues and Stus. </p>

            <p>I know the fandom. It&#39;s one of my favorites, in fact. Right up there with Tolkien and Megan Whalen Turner. And I can already tell where this is going to lead. <br><br>Her profile informs us that she&#39;s a virginal nymphomaniac (*Eyeroll*) who loves smutfic.... *sigh* If she goes after Briar I&#39;m going to go ballistic...

            <p>I&#39;m one. I&#39;m more of a Tortall person, but I&#39;m a mild fan of the Emelan books. She better not go after Briar. He&#39;s not my LO, but he deserves protections from Sues. I don&#39;t want him to become Emelan&#39;s variant of Sirius. Like I said, if the person updates and you want to kill this one, I will gladly donate a machete to the cause. Or a weed whacker...</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think that posting a review saying &quot;please hurry up and write some more, so I can kill your character in an extremely nasty manner&quot; will have quite the desired response, somehow. Pity :P<br><br>Now I&#39;m trying to think of some sort of relativity-appropriate death for her (although in saying that, I&#39;m sure she&#39;s going to do much worse than slandering Einstein, sooner or later). Maybe portalling her to the vicinity of a black hole would be fun - she could learn about the process of spaghettification...very briefly, that is. *evil grin*<br><br>Oh, and judging by the way she&#39;s pushing the &#39;I&#39;m adopted&#39; line, what are the odds she turns out to be the relative of a canon character sent to our world somehow for reasons of Melodrama?</p>

            <p>This idea I got from a third-grade science experiment.

Replace vinagre with Pink Stuff (Or Purple Stuff, for that matter). Hand to Sue. Run away (or perhaps portal to a safe distance) quickly.

Seriously, Rusvul Reguba was kind of a jerk for most of the book, but he would NOT be wrong to be unhappy that his son was banging somebeast who, as far as he knows, could EAT HIM.

            <p>Plugging a lovely if utterly un-PPC-like website called <a href="http://www.givesmehope.com/">Gives Me Hope .Com</a>. <br><br>It&#39;s basically a reservoir for uplifting stories about the lovely things people do for each other - big and small. Reading a few of these every day could, I think, make everyone in this world just a little more optimistic. And just to prove that I&#39;m a softie, this one made me cry: <br><br><i>A boy was dying of cancer and needed an expensive brain surgery, but his family, broke and desperate, couldn&#39;t afford it. His eight year old took sister Tess took her piggy bank savings to a pharmacist in order to buy a &#39;miracle&#39;. It just so happens that the right man witnessed the little girl&#39;s tears at the pharmacy counter: a neurosurgeon. He performed the surgery for free. </i></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been hanging about the Board Lurking for quite some time (Stumbled across this place some time last year), and started posting here a little over a month ago. <br><br>I was going to wait a little longer before asking Permission, but then I stumbled upon this rather terrible Tamora Pierce Fic ( <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5035998/1/i_kissed_the_rogue"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5035998/1/i_kissed_the_rogue">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5035998/1/i_kissed_the_rogue</a></a> ) and have been itching to kill it since then. <br><br>In any case, I am hereby requesting the use of RC Sp&#39;nьff(24) for Agent Rose/Ross of the Department of Floaters. <br><br>Quick Bio: <br>Agent Rose/Ross is a cheerfully blatant Author Insert. She makes no bones about it, and is in fact rather proud of the fact. She is quick to smile, and quicker to apologize for anything, regardless of it having been her fault or not. (“It’s raining out.” “I’m sorry…”)<br><br>In her brief history in the Department of Floaters, Rose/Ross has been through three partners, the last one of whom retired, probably directly due to Rose/Ross. <br><br>Agent Rose/Ross’s favored weapons include a fountain pen with a turned wooden handle called Whatthehell, a fencing Sabre named Ow, and a large rawhide mallet dubbed Beatsthings. <br><br>Rose/Ross hales from the Real World, supposedly from a Bass Akwards town in Washington State with more cows than people. <br><br>The reason for the slash in her name is this: Agent Rose/Ross does not suffer from Multiple Personality Disorder. She enjoys every minute of it. So does her twin brother, with whom she shares her body. Little is yet known about the brother, Ross, save that he exists, and that he is rather deadly with their fountain pen.<br><br>And a link to a full Bio/description: <a href="http://dawnbluewings.livejournal.com/28198.html"><a href="http://dawnbluewings.livejournal.com/28198.html">http://dawnbluewings.livejournal.com/28198.html</a></a><br><br>Also, a link to a Writing Sample: <br><a href="http://dawnbluewings.livejournal.com/28612.html"><a href="http://dawnbluewings.livejournal.com/28612.html">http://dawnbluewings.livejournal.com/28612.html</a></a><br><br>And as I said at the top, I wish to tackle the Tamora Pierce fic &quot;i kissed the rogue&quot;, found here: <br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5035998/1/i_kissed_the_rogue"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5035998/1/i_kissed_the_rogue">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5035998/1/i_kissed_the_rogue</a></a><br><br>So.

            <p>Sp&#39;nьff(24) is a joke with several friends of mine regarding the fact that one of them once accused me of eating the number 24. Therefore, we had to replace it with another number.

            <p>The fic I&#39;m in the process of killing right now is a Tamora Pierce fic of the Tortall universe. I have thus far run into two Minis in it, but... I have no idea what shape they are. There&#39;s nothing anywhere that I can find regarding Tortall-Minis, and I was thinking, Mini-Stormwings? <br><br>Anyone else familiar with the fandom have any input? Anyone who&#39;s previously found a Tortall-Mini here to correct me? <br><br>Also, would anyone like a &#39;Pidgin&#39;?

            <p>But there&#39;s only three chapters of it, and it hasn&#39;t been updated in about five years. I always thought that the Mini-Stormwings were a bit odd. As to Mini-Chaos, (courtesy of Uusoae), I wish that would work. Or maybe Mini-Hurroks, Mini-Skinners, or Mini-Ysandir. Could I have a pidgin?</p>

            <p>Technically, I think that Silver Script is the Handwriting Evil Cousin to Purple Prose. <br><br>You know how an eleven-year-old will practice her cursive for hours on end, and then when called on misspelling her own name will insist that it doesn&#39;t matter because &quot;It looks pretty!&quot;? Or maybe you don&#39;t... Anyway, I&#39;ve tutored too many eleven-year-old girls, thus I&#39;ve been subjected to this many times. <br><br>But that&#39;s what Silver Script is.

            <p>.....YUCK.<br><br>Yeah, I&#39;ve seen that. I never had that problem as a kid, though.

            <p>Never liked writing or reading in cursive. I think people should just write normally because it&#39;s more readable and practical, really. Easier on both the writer and the eyes. I don&#39;t really care about how to use it, to the point that I can&#39;t sign my name. No big loss though.</p>

            <p>The Tortall-verse is rife with such horrors, I know.<br><br>Just a minor nitpick: <i> “Hello there,” she murmured, scratching it behind it’s ears. “What are we going to call you, hmmm?”</i><br><br>No apostrophe in the &quot;its&quot;. That&#39;s a weird pronoun, but &quot;it&#39;s&quot; is only used for a contraction of &quot;it&quot; and &quot;is.&quot; There is no apostrophe for making the pronoun possessive.<br><br>Other than that, good job. I&#39;m not as familiar with the Provost&#39;s Dog series as any of her other Tortall works, but I do know that that version of Beka is about as OOC as it gets. Nice kill.</p>

            <p>The mission was very amusing, aside from the fact that the author who wrote the badfic obviously hadn&#39;t proofread her work. The Pigins seem cute. I&#39;d like one for my agents, if possible. (I would mention the existence of a Pigin in their RC as a snippet between the first and second missions, as soon as I get around to writing them. That is, if you don&#39;t mind your Agents being mentioned as the ones who gave the Pigin.) Congrats on your first mission!</p>

            <p>Sure, of course you can have a Pidgin. There are far too many in the RC right now... <br><br>The sad thing about that mission was that the author threw out the standard &quot;im dyslexic dont poke me!&quot; in her profile. Not an excuse.

            <p>Lots of the most capable and consistent spellers I&#39;ve seen have said they&#39;re dyslexic. I&#39;m sure there are a few other Boarders who are as well.

            <p>It&#39;s an... aquired taste, shall we say?<br><br>The watersports one could be less ambiguous though. How does an unsuspecting fanfic newbie know that it&#39;s that and not, say, sex on a jet ski? I feel sorry for that hypothetical person. :P<br><br>I first encountered it in a Harry Potter fic on AFF. Basically, Draco, Crabbe, Goyle and I believe one other person (maybe Blaise) gangrape and beat Hermione half to death and then start pissing over her. Then Draco Obliviates her (which I thought was a bit too complex a spell for him given I think it was set in OotP) and then... you guessed it... changes the memory so Harry and Ron did it all. *headdesk* Despite the fact that everyone would know that is so supremely out of character for those two and the fact that there&#39;s bound to be a wizarding form of forensic science and that would reveal the true attackers.

At the time, we felt like it wasn&#39;t worth possibly offending people about aforementioned religious matters.<br><br>On the other hand, maybe that discussion can be re-opened. For my part, as long as the thing is handled with some regard for people&#39;s sensibilities, I have no problem with it. I figure it&#39;s the same as Bad Slash: there&#39;s nothing wrong with being gay, but if the characters being slashed aren&#39;t, and it&#39;s not handled well, it&#39;s bad writing. In the same way, there&#39;s nothing wrong with religion, but if the character &quot;turning to the Lord&quot; has no real reason to do so--having not been noticeably anti-religious or evil to begin with, in this case--then it&#39;s out of character.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>But that&#39;s a good point. I would just suggest proceeding with caution, avoid making too many charges based on religion alone, and stick in a very clearly-worded author&#39;s note about how it&#39;s the fic tht offends, not the religious content.<br><br>In this case, I see enough implausible encounters and OOCness in Harry (overdefensiveness, for one) to charge even without the religious content. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m crap at jokes, so excuse the poor telling of it. It was something along the lines of Farrah Fawcett dying and going to heaven and being asked if she had any last requests for happenings on Earth. She asked for all the children of the world to be happy and safe. So they killed Michael Jackson. Of course, as jokes go, it works rather better if, unlike me, you a) know who Farrah Fawcett is and b) know she also died that day.</p>

As for spelling errors, there are a few, but the only one that overly annoys me is a constant misspelling of &#39;commoner&#39; as &#39;commonor&#39;. Oh, and a character who may have died in the last book (Jane Farrar) survived, but may be in character (she&#39;s still a pretty b****h). I&#39;m still at chapter 4, and all in all, this doesn&#39;t seem to be pretty bad (in fact, I&#39;m starting to like it). Your opinions?  </p>

            <p>Winston and Chliever both screwed up in their first mission together. This was not just coincidence; I&#39;ve wanted to do this storyline from the beginning.

With his Plaguesword gone, look for Chliever beginning to use his diseases as his main weapons. Also, what&#39;s worse than an escaped canon in your RC? Your superior mistaking her for an Intern!

            <p>I&#39;m willing to suppose that Medical and FicPsych are busy, and maybe sometimes somebody slips away. I also understand the agents being too panicked to tell anybody about it.

            <p>I don&#39;t even know how to say this.<br><br>First off, I don&#39;t think we should be attacking things posted on people&#39;s personal journals. I remember this topic coming up a long time ago, when someone brought up a community started by badfic authors on LJ which wouldn&#39;t allow anyone non-approved in. Someone (I want to say Huinesoron, but I&#39;m not sure) pointed out this was what people were supposed to do: put their stuff on private communities, unless they wanted it reviewed. Yes, his stuff sucks, but it&#39;s not on The Pit, or any communities that I can see, so why bother? His fics are an abomination, yes, but what he does on his Livejournal is his business. <br><br>Secondly, a warning would be nice. <br><br>Thirdly... Um, did you have a beta for this? It&#39;s generally Strongly Recommended. Anyway, yeah.</p>

            <p>... A warning about the M-rated nature of these things would probably be a good idea in the future.<br><br>I&#39;ve seen some crude rude stuff before, but I think the comparison of the &quot;trail of tears&quot; takes the cake. *gags*<br><br>A few technical details. First of all, the Plants speak telepathically, which is usually rendered in italics, not quotation marks. Second, you left the N out of Hyacinth a few times, as well as a few other miscellaneous spelling and punctuation oopses. Third, did you really mean for the CAD to say &quot;Watch out for hundred-<u>food</u> [censored]&quot;? And, if so, why didn&#39;t that appear on the charge list?
