            <p>No, there can only be one OFU per fandom. As for AUs... I think it&#39;s the same for non AU. If the characters are OOC or there are Mary Sues running around screwing things up, then it&#39;s not good. And it has to be a plausible AU.

            <p>The AU I&#39;m speaking about quotes almost everything not related to the romance from the books. It&#39;s almost as if you have to have the books the fic is following with you so that you can read along. The pairing can be compared to a Draco/Hermione fic. It also describes one of my favorite heroines as having color-changing eyes. I just want to make sure that I can kill it before I fly into a rage and rant about it. The writing is pretty good, but the plot is awful. It ruins Protector of the Small, Tortall fans! Down with bad hate-love fanfics between enemies! I can&#39;t stand &#39;em.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s our poor blonde pretty boy she&#39;s paired with. But that story has seriously pissed me off. I&#39;m going to kill it as soon as I get around to my first few missions. It&#39;s a long story, so I need a few simpler ones first. Here&#39;s the link:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4648148/1/The_Only_Volunteer"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4648148/1/The_Only_Volunteer">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4648148/1/The_Only_Volunteer</a></a><br><br>Some of the more notable quotes from it are:<br><br>- <i>&quot;Kel had lost control of her calm mask, and Joren found the show of emotion on her face very intriguing. He had discovered during their study times together that Kel&#39;s eyes became more green than brown when she was angry or excited. Right now there was only a thin ring of brown around the outer edges of her irises. Joren smiled widely, which only seemed to irritate Kel more and he watched as her eyes seemed to come to life with her anger.&quot;</i><br><br>(This made me want to vomit.)<br>- <i>&quot;As the &#39;best man&#39;,&quot; Sir Paxton explained, &quot;I am here to support Merovec and keep him calm, represent my father and vouch for Nond House&#39;s support of this marriage, sign the official documents, and certify that the marriage had been consummated. After that, the real festivities may begin.&quot;<br><br>Joren digested that last bit of information, &quot;So you ... you have to watch them? And the feast has to wait until ... after?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Goddess, no!&quot; Paxton laughed. &quot;That was necessary back in the ancient days, when we had to steal our brides from their often disapproving families, but it&#39;s no longer required in these modern times. Thank all the gods that the only thing I must do is wait outside the bridal chamber. Mero will hand me the sheet afterward.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The sheet?&quot; Joren asked, feeling completely ignorant about the whole affair.<br><br>Paxton laughed some more. &quot;Surely you know how ... certain things are done. The common folk are much less concerned about all this, but we nobles still like to verify that the bride was in fact a virgin at the time of the marriage. There will, of course be ... evidence.&quot;<br><br>Joren turned red with embarrassment. &quot;I had no idea it would be like this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;My father told me that when he married my mother, there was a Mithran priest behind a curtain in the room with them the entire time.&quot; Paxton shook his head at the memory. &quot;Back then, he explained to me, the Daughters of the Goddess and their priestess would parade around with the blood-stained sheet and perform a little fertility dance before the feast could begin. Nowadays, all I have to do is show the sheet to the priest and then the young ladies will have their &#39;Maidens&#39; Dance&#39; to announce the happy occasion. It&#39;s much less embarrassing for everyone.&quot;<br></i><br><br>(This one is very lulz-worthy, &quot;written&quot; by &quot;Joren&quot;.)<br>-<i>&quot;I was the only volunteer<br>To show you the palace ways;<br>You were the only volunteer<br>To help me write my essays.<br>When I saw you dressed as a lady -<br>Like all the others on a summer day,<br>I knew I could fall in love with you, <br>If you&#39;d only let me say:<br>&quot;Volunteer to leave your knight training<br>And volunteer to learn a lady&#39;s ways.&quot;<br>Then I will be the only volunteer<br>To love you for all of your days.&quot;</i><br>(It&#39;s hysterical and nauseating at the same time!)<br><br>(I added this one below because, although it&#39;s a bit more canonical than Mood Ring Color Eyes!Sue above, it made the Agent Sive part of me Bloodwrathy. Dom dueled with Joren<br><br>-----Spoiler Alert-----  <br><br>in the fic to <i>avenge</i> what that bastard had done to Kel when she was a Fourth Year page about to become a squire. And she forgives Joren for sabotaging her tests a few days after she finds out who was on trial because Vinson was supposedly the main plotter in this fic and just needed money. Joren also wanted Kel to give up and become a lady. WTF? No one in their right mind would forgive Joren for doing such a thing, no matter what back story.)<br>- <i>&quot;Two minutes later, Joren performed an intricate twist and sweeping arc which sent Dom&#39;s practice blade flying into the sand. Kel was shocked when Lerant laughed and told her to look at the bright side - she hadn&#39;t lost any money on their bet and she&#39;d be able to sit back and watch Raoul get his own revenge on the blond squire. His comment disturbed Kel so much that she went to Raoul before they headed out to the makeshift jousting lanes.&quot;</i><br><br>- <i>&quot;Relief washed over Joren when he realized that he truly was in the Living Realms. He&#39;d made it back to the chapel. He&#39;d survived his Ordeal! Severe pain made him wince as he brought his hands up to his face and he pressed his bloodied palms against his eyes to hold in the tears. He heard someone order him to lie still while the healer used his Gift to heal two cracked ribs and a severely bruised collarbone. Joren would need stitches to close up two small, but deep gashes, and time would heal everything else.&quot;</i><br><br>For the sake of sanity, I&#39;ll leave out the ones about the one time Neal and Kel kiss, poor Cleon gets neglected (he needs a bunch of hugs after I fix this), and Roald practically admits that he has a huge crush on her. I might be more paranoid than everyone else about these sort of stories, but to me, these deem it kill-worthy. I&#39;m very biased against most enemies-become-lovers plots. I prefer canonical pairings, thank you.<br></p>

            <p>It&#39;s more like I take the stuff off of Sues who no longer require the said item (aka dead Sues) or I sell a rich Sue&#39;s belongings. Then I tamper with the items. You&#39;d be surprised at how effective this method of getting cool Raven Armory stuff is. (Selling the Sue&#39;s hair for wigs also fetches quite a bit.) It&#39;s not exactly legal, I know, but it makes me feel better about all the Sues swamping Tortall.<br>No tea, thank you. Although, if you do find a badfic in which Dom falls in love with an OC or a really bad (as in magical powers, weird hair coloring, color-changing eyes, or a generic go-to-convent-become-a-beautiful-lady plot) Replacement!Sue of Kel it would be greatly appreciated by one of my agents. She&#39;d just loooove to beat up anyone who trys to take Dom, aside from Canon Kel, of course. Then she only acts surly. Just a thought.</p>

            <p>Maybe someone reported its awfulness. Don&#39;t worry. There&#39;s still plenty of awful Tortall fanfics to use as examples. Take a look at some of the Kel/Joren ones, for example. There&#39;s only a few that aren&#39;t bad. On a lighter note, I found a Suefic in which the Rogue was called the Rouge.

            <p>That makes me want to vomit and I don&#39;t ever feel nauseous while reading. At least, until that story. <br>Wyldon is married and has children, for Mythros&#39;s sake! A Scanran attack in winter? That&#39;s fricking impossible in this continuum! The books clearly stated that the only thing that happened at winter during the Scanran War was the reports from Daine&#39;s spies! Also, isn&#39;t Wyldon about thirty or forty years her senior? Erg. That&#39;s pushing the limits of my gag reflex.<br>Modern AUs are disturbing. I tend to not like any of them, except parodies.<br>The AU I found made Kel&#39;s eyes change back and forth between hazel and green (but only green when she is in wuv wid pwecious Jorwen). It also made Joren&#39;s family &quot;oh so horrible, unchaste, and controlling&quot; and made Joren look like a crappy knight. The Suethor said basically that he stunk at everything but swordplay, which wasn&#39;t true in the books. This is an AU, but still... You&#39;ll all love this about it, too: Because Joren is supposedly dyslexic, Kel gets to &quot;tutor&quot; him, and both Kel and Wyldon practically state that &quot;all those who have dyslexia are stupid&quot;. I about snapped at that point. That is just wrong, wrong, wrong. Kel and Neal kiss, Cleon gets dissed, and Joren survives the Ordeal. But what really ticked me off in the first place were three things: There are over sixty chapters in the story, Dom gets beat by Joren in a swordfight while Kel <i>watches</i>, and there are, on average, about fifteen quotes from the books per chapter. All in all, it&#39;s confusing to read, (although there&#39;s not that bad of writing), stupid to read, and completely contradictory of the books. I hope Tammy never finds it. It would scare her.</p>

            <p>Or, we can make it go to the Chamber of Ordeal, if that&#39;s even possible. In one of the books, it did say that anyone with suspicious intentions towards the Chamber were &quot;reduced to ash&quot;, or something like that. Sues count as having suspicious intentions, on my scale. Or maybe the Chamber will want to inflict punishments on the Sues itself! That would be interesting to find out.<br><i>You don&#39;t belong here, it said. You are what humans call a &quot;Mary Sue&quot;. You look beautiful on the outside, but have ugly intentions.

            <p>I just came up with a possible story about an incubus. I actually have a few others about incubi/succubi, but none of those do much beyond suck out energy and, in one case, get someone pregnant.<br><br>However, this latest idea, probably a oneshot, has the incubus seduce a woman before doing the incubi thing and sucking out her soul. This kills her. My question is this: does this count as snuff? Personally, I’m not sure (and if it does, I’ll probably abandon the story). It’s just, in my experience, snuff is written for sexual pleasure. While I do show the sex scene (or I will, depending on how much I believe I can get away with), I’m not aiming for the reader’s sexual pleasure in the soul-sucking and death section.<br><br>Basically, the woman and the incubus (though she has no idea he is one and I’ll leave only minor clues throughout the story until this part) sleep together. When they climax, the incubus kisses her and does something magical. This intensifies and keeps her climaxing until he can suck out her soul, which happens quickly. After that, she twitches briefly in the sort of aftershocks of death and then goes still. And that’s it.<br><br>This is only a draft and writing it like that has made me worried about whether it could be interpreted as being written for sexual pleasure (it isn’t, let me assure you). I’m perfectly willing to accept rewrites, but what do you think? As is, would it could as snuff?<br><br>A second, related question is, how would Fiction Press react to me posting this? Should I risk it? Or should I post somewhere else?</p>

            <p>Yes indeed. Continuing my masquerade as a Responsible Adult, I am, at long last, moving away from my parents and in with my fiance.

I&#39;m shooting for the final move to happen this Sunday. How much I&#39;ll be around after that will depend on whether my fiance has signed us up for an internet connection by then and, of course, by time spent on the job hunt and then the job itself.<br><br>Big change is ahead for me.

            <p>a) Getting used to someone else&#39;s habits always is a little, I think, but when I moved out I was so sick of living at home that anything seemed better, and by the time the novelty wore off we were used to each other :)<br><br>b)When things were difficult, I handled it by going &#39;okay, WHY is he acting like this?&#39; and by making sure I didn&#39;t hold a grudge. And getting things out in the open. Don&#39;t let little grievances fester. That&#39;s the most important thing. Have a little argument now when you can easily make it up, rather than letting them build to the point where you have a huge argument that you can&#39;t just pout for a bit over and then go ask for a cuddle afterwards.<br><br>Change is scary.

            <p>A few pearls of wisdom I&#39;ve picked up while living with a male housemate:<br><br>1) Impress upon him the importance of toilet roll. Living with your parents, you&#39;ll have had a mother with sense and a well trained father. Living with your young man, you may well find that he&#39;s perfectly capable of saving up his poos until he gets to work, and doesn&#39;t realise that this method does not actually work for women.<br><br>2) Be prepared for an array of unpleasant substances on tissues dotted about your home. Earwax is the prime culprit in this house, although given your average man there are many other possibilities.<br><br>3) There will be Smells. You have been warned.<br><br>I wish you the best of luck in your man-training. And also in your moving. Still, at least you get unpacking and shelving books to look forward to.</p>

            <p>Ah, you think you&#39;re prepared for the smells. I smile at the innocence, but at the same time I grieve for the awakening you will have. Boys&#39; bums, seriously. There&#39;s something <i>abnormal</i> going on up there.<br><br>I think Trojie has the best words of wisdom, actually. I&#39;m not living with a boyfriend, just with a housemate who happens to be a man. Once a month we find me going absolutely mental at him over the slightest things. We&#39;ve both found it helps to stop and think &quot;hang on, why is she doing this?&quot; When he realises I&#39;m hormonal, he doesn&#39;t take it personally, and when I realise I&#39;m hormonal, I immediately say as much, and apologise for not really being that in control of what an enormous bitch I&#39;m being. Overall, it works pretty well, and you can see how it wouldn&#39;t if it were never commented on. So that&#39;s probably your best bit of advice to take on board - always consider the whys before you jump to being royally pissed off (and hope to Glod he does the same).<br><br>What shelving system have you decided on? Are you merging books or keeping them separate? Alphabetised? Dewey decimalised? And how many books - have you been sad enough to count?</p>

            <p>So, my housemate just wandered in to trade a brew for a fag, and we ended up discussing the relative merits of written pornography versus visual pornography. As you do. He complains that his imagination&#39;s abysmal since he cleaned himself up, and I pointed out that he won&#39;t do himself any favours watching, ahem, TV all the time because it rots the brain. Long story short, I now need links to PWP to throw at him. Not just any old PWP either, but really excellent stuff. (And preferably in fandoms I know so I can explain when he gets confused.)<br><br>So, any recommendations?<br><br>Oh, and some het would be good, because trying to get him on the slash might not really help me make my point all that well.</p>

Tell me this is a Mary Sue parody and not a real Sue, please. Burn, spork, and vaporize. All that I can say good about it is that there was some action and deaths in it. I would have died of laughter if one of the vermin who was nearby when &quot;precious Azalea&quot; was found dead had patted Ferhago on the back and said, &quot;It&#39;s alright, Chief. I feel your pain.&quot;</p>

            <p>Hello all! Pipistrellus is the name, lurking&#39;s my game. Let me tell you a little about myself. I am currently working on a Bachelor of Arts somewhere deep in the southeastern US. I do a lot of lurking on SomethingAwful, news sites and (gasp!) a few blogs. I love humor in all its forms and media. I&#39;m into a fair amount of fandom--mostly Avatar, X-Men, Spider-Man, Harry Potter, and some LOTR. When I can tear myself away from the computer, I work in the garden, paint, and sell produce at my local farmer&#39;s market.</p>

            <p>Well, I love Nightcrawler in just about all forms of X-Men, but I also like the Brotherhood from X-Men: Evo, esp. Toad. I loved Harry in the Spider-Man movies (James Franco--whoo!); I followed Morbius from the comics for awhile. I like Sandman and Gwen Stacy from the Spectacular Spider-Man tv show.<br>LOTR and Harry Potter are a little harder. I can&#39;t really pick a fave from either, &#39;cause I like &#39;em so darn much!</p>

            <p>... it might take me a while, given I&#39;m currently on an intensive statistics course in a country far from home and I don&#39;t have a great deal of time on Teh Intarwubs. I probably won&#39;t have the time to do a proper beta on anything until I get home, which isn&#39;t til early August.<br><br>Also, telling me where I might find it would probably be useful. <br><br>(PS: you can also email me - you do have my address, don&#39;t you? :) just a thought)</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t really require a full beta, just a check to make sure I&#39;ve got the science facts in &quot;Background Information&quot; down right. I&#39;ll email it to you. :]<br><br>Although I might warn you that the Background Info is the biggest section in the lab. </p>

            <p>We&#39;re prepping for our Personality Dialysis lab as we speak (refer to <a href="http://lily-winterwood.livejournal.com/4711.html">this</a> if you have no idea what the hell I&#39;m talking about) and we need some Suvian specimens! The methods we are testing are:<br><br>Dialysis<br>Genetically Modified Vampire Bats<br>Dwarf Hair/Saliva<br>Glitter Extraction (kinda like the Embryo Extractor in BadSlash)<br><br>So based on that, we&#39;ll need some more victims.

            <p>I have two badfics for you guys to PPC/MST. Please, for the love of god, someone kill them. Just… *coughs nervously* don’t look at the author’s name?<br><br>*sighs* Yeah, I decided that, what the hell, I’d throw up my two earliest fanfics. I hope. You see, I first thought that Years of Hell was my first. Turns out that old adage of never forgetting your first was wrong. Unless repressed memories get excluded? Because that’s the only way I could have forgotten the horror of my actual first fanfic. Let’s hope for everyone’s sake that I don’t uncover any more things. Well, barring that one Eragon ripoff I did. Urgh. Out of all the things I could have plagiarised for schoolwork, why did I have to choose Eragon?<br><br>Anyway, for the fics I’ve throwing out to the wolves, I have one for both sides of the fandom war, both equally horrible…<br><br>Years of Hell: The Darkness Spreading: A Star Wars story, set after the Vong War. This is without my having read more than snippets at the time of writing the fic and still only having read the final New Jedi Order book right now (though wishing I had the others) and I can’t remember much of it. Mary Sue is Anakin’s apprentice (this was written before The Force Unleashed was announced, too), super-Sith appear, turn out to be not so super against Mary Sue, two sequels planned involving time travel and Mirror Universes fortunately abandoned along with this. Here’s the address: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5205702/1/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5205702/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5205702/1/</a></a><br><br>8472: A Star Trek epic compressed into two pages. Every bit as bad as that sounds. Written for English homework. Got a B for it. Teacher was probably drunk. There is nothing else I can really say other than I screw with the Federation, the Borg, Species 8472 and, for reasons that shall forever remain unknown, the Talaxians. Address here: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5205700/1/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5205700/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5205700/1/</a></a><br><br>If anyone does take on these fics, my only request is on my profile page. Basically, give me links to wherever you post. Thanks. Also, *begs for forgiveness*</p>
