            <p>Or a sure-fire way to ease the symptoms at least.<br><br>Step one: the Hot Toddy. Get a mug, preferably not too big. Start with a triple whiskey. Throw in a teabag (normal black tea; none of this fancy herbal bollocks). Top up with boiling water, and add lemon juice and a big dollop of honey to taste. Stir well, and drink.<br><br>Step two (optional): a very large joint.<br><br>Step two works by making you so spaced out and sleepy you don&#39;t realise you&#39;re ill. Can be combined with a hot bath or snuggling under a duvet in front of a fire for optimum relaxing effect. Step one is similar, except it works by getting you drunk, and is not recommended in the bath. And if you don&#39;t want to get drunk, go with a single shot of whiskey, and it&#39;ll take the edge off the ache and soothe your throat.</p>

            <p>Get lots of sleep. That&#39;s very important. Also, blow your nose frequently, don&#39;t just snuffle it back. Sniffing it back makes phlegm in your lungs, and it makes you cough a lot. Don&#39;t get too cold, because even if being cold doesn&#39;t cause sickness, it lowers your immune system.<br><br>If you can get your hands on Cold-Eze lozenges, those are a huge help, and may cut the overall sickness short.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve heard alot about this anime and I&#39;m thinking about watching it.  From what I&#39;ve heard, Light sounds like Rorschach mixed with the Joker and Misa sounds like Harley Quinn.  However, I&#39;m not really sure about it.  I&#39;m not as into anime as I used to be, despite the username.  So, I was wondering if I could get anyone&#39;s opinions about it.  Please, try to keep them spoiler free.</p>

            <p>But then again, I read that back before they made the anime, and it&#39;s so plot driven that once you&#39;ve watched/read it and understood it there&#39;s no need to read/watch it again.  I watched the first couple of episodes and couldn&#39;t get into it.  Maybe you need to do one before the other?<br><br>If you like drama and twisted plotlines, it&#39;s definitely worth it.

            <p>There&#39;s a fairly drastic change that happens about a hundred issues into the manga that disappointed me - I suppose the situation couldn&#39;t continue forever, but I think the incident could have been handled a lot better.

            <p>Is that they set up a collapsing situation that there&#39;s no escape from. It&#39;s great to watch the characters get more and more frantic as the situation closes in on them, and it&#39;s really well done (in the manga, anyways), but I&#39;m really not satisfied with how they resolved the situation. And then they tried to set up a similar situation, and that was just awkward. That&#39;s about a hundred issues in, though, so there&#39;s lots of good watching before then.</p>

            <p>So I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t comment.<br><br>Don&#39;t take what I&#39;m saying as trying to hint that the series isn&#39;t worth your time - it&#39;s really, really good. Just be forewarned that you may end up giving it up halfway through when it stops being really good, and there&#39;s really no satisfying conclusion there.</p>

            <p>And I graduated from college, so I have a BA in English in name even if I don&#39;t actually get the piece of paper quite yet. They need my grade from my course in London before they&#39;ll give it to me, but that&#39;s okay. {= )<br><br>But, yeah. My boyfriend of about two years got down on one knee after my commencement, in front of all the parents, and I said yes. <sup>_^</sup> We don&#39;t have a wedding date set at the moment, because we figure it would be good to have jobs first, but that&#39;s just details. {= )<br><br>I have a shiny white-gold ring.

            <p>I intend to spork a Suefic in this series as a first mission. Thing is, House is more in Whatev&#39;s interests, Krisp&#39;s are more in science fiction series. But What&#39; could also be a good character to pair with your agents as needed. (hehe I look forward to see Krisp&#39;s and South&#39;s reaction to What&#39; &#39;being unfaithful to them&#39; hehe and to see What&#39; with any of your agents... lulz)<br>Well, if you ever find an abuse fic, What&#39; will be the one.<br><br>If you ever need an agent for another continuum, you can pick. What&#39; is into House MD, Numb3rs and U2, and hates abuse, hurt/comfort and OOCness, Krisp is into Star Wars, Star Trek, Stargate, Watchmen and U2 and is more after Sues, bad sex and OOCness, and South is into fantasy book series and hates bad grammar/spelling and bad humor.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d be more than willing to coauthor a mission or two after I get my first one up (finals are over in like two weeks, so it should be about then or slightly after). Narcolepsy would do nicely for the comedic combination.</p>

            <p>(She&#39;s on my friends list, you see.)<br><br><br>Name: Ariella<br><br>Gender: Female<br><br>Species: Homo sapiens<br><br>Lust Object(s): Dr. Gregory House, Archie Goodwin, Indiana Jones<br><br>Appearance and Personality: Ariella is 5’9”, wears a little too much funky-colored eyeliner, and has short brown hair. She likes dressing in nice blazers with ripped jeans, has a nose with a bump on it, and moans almost all the time about how her height precludes her from both wearing high heels and getting a boyfriend taller than her (a subject that she focuses on all the time, when not being an annoying smart-ass—then she gets a beau, remembers she doesn’t actually want one, dumps him, and starts all over; her partner is sick of this).<br><br>Ariella is well-read to the point that she can call herself a sesquipedalian and not have to look up how to spell it. As for general attitude, Ariella is a (for lack of better terms) callous bitch. Though known to be enjoyable and enthusiastic to hang out with and sometimes even pleasant in mixed company, she is unthinkingly malicious and painfully honest. Coupled with a naturally quick mind and a large vocabulary at her disposal, insults slip off of her tongue unnoticed and automatically. If Noлl Coward and Gregory House had a child, she would be it. Unfortunately, her personality is juxtaposed with a strong streak of protectiveness, so she shows she cares by keeping the ‘only I can do that to them’ policy.<br><br>As for hobbies besides copious reading, she is in love with music including, oddly enough, musical theatre and will belt songs at the top of her lungs. Ariella also passes the free time she doesn’t have in the PPC by debugging viruses from computers, watching House MD, poledancing, and being a hypocrite.</p>

            <p>You&#39;d be talking a fairly massive malfunction - this is technology hundreds of agents use daily without mishap - and you&#39;d need a reason why it couldn&#39;t reversed - Medical is damned good - and you&#39;d need to make it for comedic effect too.

            <p>Possibly only two. I can&#39;t remember whether the person who got turned into a Pak Protector was in disguise at the time. But anyway, that one and the two people who got turned permanently into elves got stuck because they&#39;d experienced something which would kill them if they changed back (in the elven case, several hundred years). The other case is Tawaki, who is now a Time Lord due to being on the verge of death when he was disguised as one. That meant he regenerated and thus would be dead if he changed back. Again, disguise filter or something.<br><br>Note that this doesn&#39;t work for weapon strikes - Jay and Acy got shot up with arrows as Ents, but were still able to change back. So I can&#39;t see any reasonable way someone could become a dragon due to that sort of malfunction. Any other kind, I don&#39;t know of any precedents for, so that&#39;s up to the author.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>in Dragonlance, Bronze dragons can breath (or throw, I can&#39;t remember which) lightning, but only after having absorbed some, be it from a lightning strike, or launched by another bronze.  that, at least in the dragonlance continuum, is enough to fry a human.  or a dwarf, or any other non-magical being without protection.  or, of course, I could simply portal into the forgotten realms continuum immediately before the Dragonrage occurs, and have him sleep for the several centuries that it lasts for.  that would also work.</p>

            <p>I thought the lightning would be a novel alternative to simple killing the replacement clans in a certain warriors fic, and as for the transformation, it would be very difficult for two agents disguised as cats to carry around books, writing utensils, and various other things.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not a PG, but I&#39;m saying no, this idea seems like a bad one. It seems to me that you&#39;re giving your Agent an ability that would make missions far too easy for him. Yes, all Agents would love the ability to shapeshift, but that is part of the reason why the DORKS exists.<br><br>In the other part of the thread you mentioned using human disguises to kill the Sues. I don&#39;t know about the Warriors series past what I&#39;ve heard on fanficrants, badficquotes and TVTropes, but I&#39;ve got the impression that these are feral cats. Feral cats, as a general rule, will run away from humans and therefore human Agents wouldn&#39;t get close enough to kill them. Never mind the problems that your Agents would have carrying weapons around in modern day Britain.<br><br>Lightning throwing dragons would be an even bigger attention drawer. As I&#39;ve already pointed out, disguises are there to help Agents blend in with canon. Modern day Britain is no Rivendell to allow Agents to walk around in a disguise that sticks out like a sore thumb. Dragons stick out like a sore thumb.<br><br>I guess what I&#39;m trying to say here is that this permanent transformation into a dragon would make your Agent too powerful with too few drawbacks, as far as I can see. He is, in my opinion (which may not count for much, I know), in danger of becoming a Stu with this idea.</p>

            <p>Do you know anything about dungeons and dragons, or, specifically, the dragonlance campaign setting?  the dragons in that continuum, or at least some kinds, are natural shapeshifters and magic users.

            <p>... and apparently, center-clicking on the &quot;return to messages&quot; button (to bring it up in a new tab) posts the message. Good thing I finished the sentence...<br><br>Anyways, to continue with my thought, Acacia manages to carry enough stabby things to mangle a small army, regardless of disguise. Details change to fit the disguise - bows become big ugly Uruk-Hai ones, arrows become poisoned, and so on, but the weapons stay around, useable, and canonically correct. I would add a caveat to that, Continuums don&#39;t know what to do with anachronistic weapons, so a shotgun brought into Middle-Earth would remain a shotgun.<br><br>I would strongly advise against making an agent into a dragon, especially if it works perfectly and there are no humorous side effects afterwards. Look at what the PPC does: We&#39;re ordinary people slowly going insane because we&#39;re trying to do an impossible job to save not just one world, but many. Becoming a flying, hyper intelligent, armor plated, magic-wielding, fire-breathing killing machine really doesn&#39;t seem to me to fit that theme.<br><br>There have been crazy fanfiction ideas that have worked, and worked really well (E.G. &quot;hey, let&#39;s make a school for suethors where all the Canons are teachers!&quot;), but this one really does concern me. I&#39;m not sure how practical, or even possible, it would be to pull off well. <br><br>Also, you must consider that a dragon is a fairly significant creature in a lot of continuums, to the point where a dragon agent could well be noticed and forced to play the part of a random dragon - which would be just as disruptive to the Council of Elrond as, say, a Sue. (And quite a bit more risky, too - Glorfindel took down a Balrog, I suspect he could do the same to a dragon.)</p>

            <p>It&#39;s probably a good thing that I plan on working primarily in the Warriors continuum, which is set in *probably* modern England/Britain.  And is about cats.  Therefor, I could use the agent I plan on turning into a dragon to hold onto the equipment while they are cats.  I mean, how often do you see a cat with an anti-tank weapon?  Or a Tavor assault rifle?  The dragon&#39;s shapechanging ability morphs the dragon and any weapons or clothing they are wearing while in humanoid form.  And the kind he would become glows very brightly when transforming.</p>

            <p>the continuum i will *normally* be in is set in modern britain.  therefore an assault rifle is technically canonical, according to the time period.  besides, the agent will probably at least try to disguise himself as a sergeant in the SAS.  justifying him carrying an assault rifle when he is in human form.  and his partner&#39;s Arctic Warfare Magnum sniper rifle.  and the ammunition.  and anything else he might need.</p>

            <p>I was reading the prologue to the Department of Bad Parody (regrettably, the only DBP story that exists), and it mentioned a Head of Department called the Kelp. He doesn&#39;t seem to head up any department that I know of, but there are three Divisions that lack heads: DAVD Intelligence, DAVD Medical, and DTO, Historical Inaccuracies Division. Should we decide which of those he heads?</p>

            <p>I was reading through some of the spin-offs and looking at some badfics when the thought occurred to me: What do you do about a badfic that has nearly all OCs?

            <p>Depends on the OCs. What they&#39;re doing, and how they&#39;re doing it. You get some fics that are pretty much entirely descendants of canons, but the characters, while OCs, are well characterised, and their actions fit canon - there, we have no kill. Then we have fics where we recognise no names, it&#39;s all descendants, but they&#39;re all horribly WRONG, and they don&#39;t fit canon, and they warp the ideals, the standards and the laws of the canon. Then, even though they&#39;re all OCs, we can still kill. It&#39;s the spirit of the canon we have to maintain, after all.</p>

            <p>In that case, I&#39;d say it would depend on a few factors.<br><br>Is it in the canon world? -Big deciding factor~.<br><br>If it is, does it warp the canon world?

            <p>Well, I only looked at the ones that really seemed like badfics. Here&#39;s what I found in them that might help:<br><br>- They were in the canon world.<br>- It ripped off a book&#39;s entire plot.<br>- At least two, (if not more), OCs were supposed descendants of canon characters that had none.<br>- The one canon character that was in the one of the badfics was totally out of character, besides contradicting the laws of science. (She was in the story even though she was supposed to be dead by then.)<br>- They had modern songs with a few words replaced to fit the timeline. <br>- Almost every OC had Mary Sue qualities.<br>- The badfics didn&#39;t make any sense half the time.<br>- There was bad grammar and spelling.<br><br>Does that deem the badfics killable? As in, if I ever found some more of these and put them in the Unclaimed Badfics section of PPC&#39;s wiki, would another agent kill them?<br></p>

            <p>&quot;Being descended from a canon character&quot; isn&#39;t chargeable - if it was, we&#39;d have to kill off most of the Silmarillion. &quot;being descended from a canon character who had no offspring&quot; may be chargeable, depending on how definitely said character had no children. Neither is reason enough to assassinate on their own, but the second is a charge worth adding to the official list, if it isn&#39;t on there already.<br><br>As for the story, I&#39;d definitely call it killable.

            <p>And not necessarily, because while people do claim fics from the list, they don&#39;t always- it&#39;s a supply and demand thing. Sometimes they like finding their own fic to PPC, or what&#39;s on the list isn&#39;t exactly what they need for whatever reason.<br><br>But hey, go ahead.

            <p>I&#39;m of the opinion that if they&#39;re using a Canon world and claiming to be descendants of a canon character, especially if said character either has no descendants or they&#39;re already accounted for, then it&#39;s still killable.<br><br>I&#39;d either kill if they were Sueishly bad, or recruit. I did so in my second mission when a Sue created two new kids for Aragorn and Arwen so that she could play babysitter. I offed the Sue and recruited the kids, both of which are now happily in the PPC Nursery.

            <p>Osbert had been about to answer Celinus&#39; question, but when the trumpet sounded he instead turned on his heel, facing the players. Old reflexes and habits kicking into action, he found himself standing at attention, his arm snapping rigidly into a salute as Leas called for two minutes&#39; silence. In his peripherals, he could see Langston struggle to his feet, almost falling but managing to stand and fire off his own salute even as he swayed drunkenly.  Nobody said a word, total stillness befalling the Store as a spirit of reflection and remembrance took hold over the celebrations from before. In almost eighty years, he had seen several occasions like this, but he was sure that for many of the people inside, it was their first. By God, did that make him feel old...<br><br>  <i>You watching us up there, boys?</i><br><br>***<br><br>  Troy had wrapped an arm around Cassie&#39;s waist to support her when she said she needed to sit down, and had been about to try to lead her to one of the empty RCs he had seen along the hallway, but was interrupted by the call for a moment&#39;s silence. Keeping his hold on the young woman to keep her from falling over, he took on a sombre expression, lowering his eyes to the ground. So many people dead, not all of them his friends but all of them comrades-in-arms, it was just terrible. He shuddered, thinking about how many people he almost lost, and <i>did</i> lose, especially as at the same time he wondered how Berger was holding up. His partner had been hit a lot harder by the Invasion than he had.<br><br>  <i>Shine on, ya crazy diamonds.</i><br><br>***<br><br>  To Roy Berger&#39;s mind, it was almost as if the fighting had still been going on even as he half-heartedly drank and celebrated with the others. The call for silence had its intended effect, apparently, especially as his eyes moved to the floor and paused at the two mechanical fingers on his right hand. Prosthetics, of course, he&#39;d lost the genuine articles in that damned Escher Room. Gunshots, metal swinging through the air, the screams of the dead and the damned, in the back of his head it was all as fresh as when it happened. Fifty Agents trying to hold off what had seemed to be hundreds of Sues...why had he been the one that made it?<br><br>  <i>Damn it, don&#39;t fool yourself...it&#39;s because you</i> ran. <i>Just left them to die while you high-tailed it. You Eru-damned coward! Damn it, Silas, Dixon, Carpenter, Harris, Reason, Silverman...they all deserved to make it out of that room more than you did. They were walking around with far worse than a couple missing fingers! You should&#39;ve faced your fate with honour, dammit!</i><br><br>  A hand placed itself on his shoulder, and he looked over just out of curiosity, having to redirect his glance downwards at the shorter man to his right. He didn&#39;t dare break the silence, but the look on his face communicated well enough.<br><br>***<br><br>  To use a saying that had popped up long after he had supposedly &quot;died&quot; on the fields of Waterloo, Alois Bouchard had been given the short end of the stick. Being dragged off the field by what he had thought were either angels or looters in the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Waterloo, delirious and nearly dead from three bullet wounds and having been stabbed with a bayonet, he&#39;d been an Agent less than a month before the viruses hit. Still not fully recuperated from his wounds or the shock of Napoleon Bonaparte&#39;s fall and finding himself in totally alien surroundings, he&#39;d had to fight for survival against gigantic, monstrous macroviruses that tore Agents apart by the hundreds. Even after that it hadn&#39;t been over, he&#39;d had to face a literal army of Mary Sues.<br><br>  He didn&#39;t know what it was, the hand of God, his own skill, or something else entirely, but somehow he&#39;d made it through the ordeals and fighting far more hellish than what he&#39;d seen in the Grande Armeй with not even a scratch. His partner hadn&#39;t been so lucky, she didn&#39;t even have a chance before the bugs ripped her apart.<br><br>  In the silence of the Store, he could still hear Lee&#39;s screams and remember his own frenzied attempts to fight through the viruses to her. If it hadn&#39;t been for that strange blond-haired Norseman, he&#39;d have likely met a similar fate to his first partner. Now, though, he stood here where there was no gunfire, no screams, no dying, just those who lived remembering those who had not. Shaking himself out of his reverie, he looked to his left at the Agent who stood by him. The man was a good bit taller than the 5&#39;1 Alois, but even without looking at their face he could tell they were upset. In response, he found his hand reaching out, resting on the man&#39;s shoulder in what he hoped was a comforting gesture.<br><br>  <i>Am I the only one in this store with dry eyes?</i><br><br>***<br><br>  Sandra Richardson placed down the mug once the request for silence was heard, the drinking contest she had so boisterously called for grinding to a halt as she looked to Leas, not even paying attention to the drunk man on the other side of the table whose gaze had now drifted to the front of her uniform. She&#39;d been one of the ones lucky enough to escape HQ during the Macrovirus attack, and hadn&#39;t been very active in the Invasion&#39;s fighting, but she knew many people who had been. Most didn&#39;t make it, not even her best friends or partner. That unlucky bugger had caught a bullet with his head in the very last seconds of the fighting. It was a sobering thought, but it hadn&#39;t stopped her from coming to the party and trying to enjoy herself like she knew they&#39;d have wanted her to. Her eyes started to water up, but she closed them and shook her head, trying to force any of those feelings down. She couldn&#39;t let her feelings or memories get in the way of the party. Eventually, everyone in the store would be dead, why get so worked up?<br><br>  <i>Oh, who the hell am I kidding?</i><br><br>***<br><br>  Basilico Andretti had done a rather good job of blending into the crowd. In fact, he wasn&#39;t entirely sure if the majority even knew he was there. However, he was comfortable with this, as he was there just as much to keep an eye on potential troublemakers as to pay his respects to the dead. Of course, he still gave the bar a very wide berth, unlike many of the partygoers, especially since the one time he&#39;d tried to go over one of the people there had given him a look so hateful he almost thought he&#39;d drop dead on the spot. Still, as the moment of silence was called, he bowed his head in respect, even though he&#39;d lost no friends in the fighting.<br><br>  <i>Lord, please watch our fallen comrades as we ourselves watched o&#39;er them. Let them not be wanting, or troubled. For in Your kingdom, there is naught but peace, and respect for canon. Never shall they go unremembered or unloved, for the PPC still lives, and so does Your kingdom in Heaven. As the Word Worlds are in our care, so are their souls in Yours. In Nomine Patris, Et Fili, Et Spiritus Sancti, Amen.</i></p>

            <p>Luke looked around for a moment, noting the wet eyes around him, then blinked hard as the memories of last year&#39;s tragedy rose up. While he&#39;d made it through without sustaining any real injuries, he&#39;d seen plenty of others who hadn&#39;t been so lucky. For a moment the memory of finding his partner nearly dead in the aftermath of a battlefield threatened to overwhelm him, and he had to wipe hard at his eye to stop the tears overflowing.<br><br><i>Damn it, Jessie, why&#39;d you do that anyway?</i><br><br>At least she had pulled through. He&#39;d known others who weren&#39;t so lucky. Taking a deep breath, the tall man swallowed the lump in his throat and stared at the floor, remembering the friends he&#39;d lost.<br><br>***<br><br>Nat, who hadn&#39;t known any of the fallen, was nevertheless swept up in the emotional wave sweeping the room. She might have complained about the PPC non-stop since she&#39;d arrived, but nothing brought home just how special it was here as much as the sight of all these other people joined together to remember those they&#39;d lost. Suddenly, the solemn atmosphere dragged up some incredibly painful memories, and despite trying to fight them she broke down, though thankfully without making too much noise.<br><br>Next to her, Kelvin had also been touched by the remembrance ceremony of silence. He barely knew anything about the event being comemmorated, but took the opportunity to pay his own respects to the fallen. When Nat suddenly burst into quiet tears, however, he reacted instinctively and gently embraced her, letting her cry on his shoulder even as he tried to repress his own emotions.<br><br>***<br><br>Despite having been rather giggly and fairly tipsy, Cassie was quick to sense the changing mood of the room, and sighed sadly as she let the memories of the fighting return. While she&#39;d managed to avoid the most brutal of the fighting, she&#39;d still seen several Agents killed in the Tomb battle, including one man who&#39;d caught a bullet aimed at her. Sniffling a little at that, and somewhat aware of Troy&#39;s comforting arm around her waist, she returned the favour and leaned her head on his shoulder, feeling a bit better for the company.<br><br>***<br><br>Jessie stopped dancing and turned to face whoever had spoken as the call for silence went out. Having just been beginning to enjoy herself, the switch back to solemnity was a rather unwelcome surprise, but she guessed it couldn&#39;t be helped. She glanced around the room, and was mildly surprised to actually spot Luke wiping tears away. <i> Guess he must be more upset than he let on,</i> was all she thought before turning her mind towards the friends - and lover - she&#39;d lost in the fight.<br><br>Waking up in Medical, still shocked to find out she&#39;d needed an emergency operation to save her spine, only to then be told that Emma had died in the battle... Jessie blotted the tears away on her sleeve. <i> Don&#39;t cry, dammit. Just pay your respects and don&#39;t bawl your head off. Em&#39;s gone, but she wouldn&#39;t want you to cry. You know that.</i><br><br>***<br><br>A young brunette woman hovered near the door, biting her lip as she took in the scene. She&#39;d wanted to help out her fellow Agents during the invasion, but, being a member of the DIA, she had been drafted in to help keep order in the PPC city. She&#39;d seen the injured coming in to rest up, though, and couldn&#39;t help but feel somewhat relieved that she hadn&#39;t had to face the fight.<br><br>Across the room, she spotted a fellow DIA Agent, Basilico Andretti, and nodded silently to him to acknowledge his presence. Then Hollian Tannis joined the rest of the PPCers in paying her respects to the fallen.</p>

            <p>She gave an almost delighted smile upon seeing him. &quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting to see you here either. I promise not to tell Teek if you don&#39;t.&quot; Her smile turned faintly teasing for a moment.<br><br>Rilwen nodded a little gravely at his comments about the tribute. &quot;I felt it fitting, even if I never knew them.

            <p>&quot;How thoughtful of you.

            <p>&quot;In fact, his name is Cuauhtemoc. No, Krisprolls didn&#39;t nickname him this time. Guayas did. Guayas is his brother, by the way. Well, Banzai&#39;s one of the fastest ships in the fleet, and one of the most outgoing guys I know. Only Krisprolls and Guayas are worse. Banzai is also very nice with people. Thing is, Krisprolls always has bad ideas to test on him. When <i>I</i> don&#39;t have the bad ideas...&quot;<br>&quot;This guy is <i>too</i> nice. He&#39;s so high on playing nice and &#39;I would die before you could harmed oh so slightly in any way&#39; and stuff like that. He just deserves a smack on the head.&quot;<br>&quot;Krisp!!!&quot;</p>

Taking a large gulp, he turned in his seat again to face Luke, gripping the bottle tightly and looking at Luke like he&#39;d lay the big man out if he tried to take it away from him. &quot;Heh...arright.

            <p>Marcus replied, having not heard Luke whispering to Leto and his assistant bartender, before taking another drink of the vodka bottle. It was awfully strong stuff, but that <i>was</i> why he&#39;d asked for it. Perhaps it was hitting him a bit harder than he thought it would, but he figured he could take care of himself, even drunk. He was about to try to slur together something to continue the conversation when someone to his left cleared their throat.<br><br>  &quot;An Agent of your calibre turning out like this, getting so plastered he can barely stand?&quot; the person asked rhetorically, annoyance registering in their cultured British accent. &quot;Langston, you disgust me.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;The &#39;ell&#39;re ya-&quot; Marcus started to say, turning to face the speaker. However, he choked down whatever he was going to say as he was faced with Osbert. Marcus had only met the man a couple times, and was lucky enough that he <i>hadn&#39;t</i> been trained by the old man, but he still knew enough about Osbert to immediately shut his mouth. &quot;Er...&#39;ey, Osbert.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;&#39;Hey, Osbert&#39; yourself, Langston,&quot; Osbert said, frowning somewhat visibly, though Marcus couldn&#39;t tell if it was out of annoyance or the sense of disappointment he seemed to regard <i>every</i> Agent with. &quot;Just what in God&#39;s name are you doing with that vodka? You&#39;re accomplishing nothing but disgracing that uniform and the memory of our dead comrades, you know.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;You might want to sit back down, before you do something stupid. Oh, Leto? As I was saying, I&#39;ll have a brandy, if you have any.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Believe I do,&quot; Leto said, starting to look through his supply as Osbert returned his attention to the two Agents. He knew Langston somewhat, having met the man on a few occasions and not always on the best of circumstances. Honestly, he half wished he had been the one to train him, but it didn&#39;t particularly matter in retrospect. As the glass of brandy was placed on the bar, he sized up the large Agent who had stood up to him, idly taking a sip. He was both taller and a lot more built than Osbert was, but these days that applied to a lot of people, and he wasn&#39;t particularly impressed. Big people were just as easy to break as small ones. Still, he had no idea who the person was, though he appeared to be a friend of Langston&#39;s.<br><br>  &quot;Hm, on that note, I don&#39;t believe I have any idea who you are,&quot; he said to the larger Agent, adjusting his glasses again. &quot;Do not believe we have met before, though you appear to be a friend of that mess sprawled on Leto&#39;s bar,&quot; he gestured to Marcus, who slurred something unintelligable and gulped at his drink again. &quot;I am not mistaken, am I?&quot;</p>

I&#39;m Luke Celinus, by the way.

            <p>However, he was cut off by the sudden display of fireworks, the loud bangs and crackles making the Agent jump. He knew a firefight hadn&#39;t suddenly erupted in the store, especially with the bright flashes, but he still wheeled around in surprise. &quot;BLOODY FLAMING DENETHOR FROM HELL!&quot; the mix of World One and PPC expletives left his mouth before he really thought of what he was saying, turning sharply to find the source of the random firecrackers. Giving Leto a sharp look, he took a few seconds to let his heart stop racing before setting down the brandy and turning to face Celinus and Langston again. At least he knew where Leto had disappeared to, he supposed. &quot;Sorry about that, usually don&#39;t cuss but he took me off...hm? Where&#39;s the other one?&quot;<br><br>  <i>Speaking of disappearing...</i><br><br>  Celinus was still there when he turned back, but Langston seemed to have vanished. Finding this odd, he took a few steps to the side and looked around, only to find the drunk Agent huddled under the bar, looking around and generally trying to calm himself down. &quot;It&#39;s only a bit of firecrackers, Langston,&quot; he said with a bit of a sigh. &quot;Stop with the &#39;duck and cover&#39; stuff.&quot;<br><br>  Marcus grumbled something that sounded a bit like &quot;shu&#39; ya mouth, &#39;sbert...&quot;, before getting back out from his spot under the bar and looking around, a hand on his head. &quot;Bloody fi&#39;works...&quot;</p>

            <p>Luke quickly regained his cool and shook his head slightly, surprised that the entire place hadn&#39;t started freaking out at the racket.

            <p>The heavily intoxicated Agent resisted at first, meaning Osbert&#39;s efforts almost knocked him over, but eventually he seemed to give in, taking his seat and gripping the bar to keep his balance. Langston mumbled something, staring at his hands, but Osbert didn&#39;t make it out entirely.

            <p>Osbert scoffed, treating what had been a decision made by the Flowers years ago with visible contempt. He still remembered treating the decision with total incredulity, even if he&#39;d taken his reassignment as a trainer of new Agents with dignity and gratitude.<br><br>  &quot;I was about forty years old when I was recruited,&quot; he told Luke, after searching through his memories. &quot;I&#39;d grown a pretty thick skin by then, and a badfic is really nothing compared to some of the things you can face in World One. Back then there wasn&#39;t much of a workload, either. After a while, though, it all becomes just another job, you get desensitised.&quot; Pausing for a moment, the old man couldn&#39;t help a small chuckle. &quot;Trust me,&quot; he said. &quot;Sometimes it&#39;s more frustrating teaching a recruit how to properly fire a gun than it is to charge a Sue.

            <p>By now, Langston was singing something to himself, but Osbert really couldn&#39;t understand many of the words due to the alcohol muddling the Agent&#39;s brain. The tone was recognisable as Eric Bogle&#39;s &quot;The Green Fields of France&quot;, but not much could be clearly made out. Returning his attention to Celinus, he gave the large Agent a nod.<br><br>  &quot;I prefer field work myself, it&#39;s much more exciting, and my family has always preferred to take care of things personally.&quot; Osbert sighed, adjusting his glasses and helmet. &quot;Still, at least this way I&#39;m putting some backbone in these Agents. I&#39;m not letting them out into the missions until they can shoot straight, hit hard, operate a Console without blowing it up, and don&#39;t need to run to Bleeproducts every time something goes wrong.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Not to brag, but I think it&#39;d be safe to say I&#39;m one of the better Agent trainers; a lot of them just stick something pointy in the recruit&#39;s hand and throw them into an RC. Just who would your partner be?&quot; Arching an eyebrow, Osbert tried to think of the particularly memorable cases he&#39;d seen come through his training room. He had enough trainees on a regular basis that it was hard to remember any one in particular on most days. Celinus&#39; mention of his partner had got him curious, though, so he tried to think of if he had met her before. Unlikely, if this was his first meeting with Celinus himself.</p>

            <p>Osbert went quiet after that, thinking better of making his true opinion known. Giving Celinus a look, though, he thought of something. That black scarf around the eye, the large build, the red hair...had he seen him around, before? there was something unquestionably familiar about him.<br><br>  &quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve met, Celinus, but were you in Operations, during the beginning of the fighting?

            <p>Osbert seemed sobered by this, but not overtly upset. It was hard to be, after forty years on the job. Asking for another glass of brandy, he sipped lightly, being careful not to let it go to his head while he thought. &quot;I lost a lot of friends, too. Makes-Things was the last non-Flower Agent who was here as long as I was. Got to know him real well, and then he was the first to go.&quot;<br><br>He sighed, shaking his head at the memory. &quot;I couldn&#39;t do anything, I was still training that day&#39;s batch of recruits when it happened. I got as many people into the training rooms as I could, set up a watch, and sealed the doors once I figured there was enough food and the like for us to last however long it&#39;d be before a cure was made. When the Sues came in, I&#39;d already been getting the survivors out of the RCs and training rooms. Damn things tried to take Operations, cut the head off of our resistance before we could put up a fight.&quot; A laugh escaped him, grinning a bit as he took another sip. &quot;Woulda worked, too, but we were ready for &#39;em. I pretty much gave everyone a weapon, gathered up everyone who&#39;d been in the area and anyone who we ran into that looked like they could hold a weapon. Gave those bitches hell!&quot;<br><br>Osbert couldn&#39;t help but break into a bit of a cackle, there. &quot;Most of the trainers are either people with military experience from the outside, or former Action Agents who were taken off the beat, whether due to age or injury. On our own we probably could&#39;ve cleared the whole place out, let alone with the bunch of recruits and Agents we brought with us. Sent &#39;em running with their tails between their legs.&quot;</p>

            <p>Luke debated whether or not to get another drink, but on regarding Marcus&#39; current state, he decided against it. He might be able to hold his drink all right, but if he was going to carry his friend back to his RC, he needed to be sober himself.<br><br>Turning back to Osbert, he just shrugged. &quot;At least you had some company.

            <p>Leto, noticing that several Agents can&#39;t grieve on drink alone, brought some Sandwiches, Salads and Chocolate cake. At the same time, a portal suddenly opened and a box came out of it. On the Label, it said: <i> This is a present from the heads of various OFU&#39;s to the Protectors of the Plot Continuum, in order to commemorate the valiant Agents that died in the defense of it&#39;s Headquarters last year</i>. When Leto opened the box, he found out that it contained various foodstuffs, oviously untouched by Gandalf or any of the other OFU cooks.  </p>

In fact, nobody had actually seen him enter, not even his partner, he just seemed to be there, making an exception of his rule of not dispensing drinks to &quot;meatbags&quot; in light of the events that had happened before his programming had been complete. The DoSAT technician that had made him included a program of the entire history of the PPC, so he knew what had happened and one of his databases had a complete list of the casualties, but the sentient vending machine had only been completed a few months after the events. Performing a quick scan of the three in front of him, he concluded that they were not Agents he knew of. Not only that, but they were apparently androids.<br><br>  &quot;INTRODUCTION: I AM SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED VENDING MACHINE, SAVM, DEPARTMENT OF BAD SLASH. PLEASED STATEMENT: IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE FELLOW NONORGANIC AGENTS HERE, AS YOU ARE CLEARLY NOT MEATBAGS. QUERY: ARE YOU THREE NEW AGENTS? I HAVE NOT SEEN YOU BEFORE.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;If you see no mess in this area, your scanners need serious revising. There have been some fights, heavy drinking, not only on our parts, bantering, the same, and what have you. And I think saying &#39;meatbags&#39; for &#39;organic beings&#39; won&#39;t please everyone. We don&#39;t mind, we&#39;re too crazy for that, but if you ever come across someone who does, you&#39;ll remember it for the rest of your life, and that won&#39;t be long.

You consider that a bad thing? From what I&#39;ve heard, most Real World girls have positive feelings concerning the mall.&quot;<br><br>Adder returned his look tenfold. Deuce grimaced. &quot;Right. You&#39;re not most Real World girls. But what&#39;s your problem?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You know that feeling you get sometimes,&quot; said Adder, &quot;when you&#39;re in some place and you have that unexplainable feeling that you do not belong there?&quot;<br><br>Deuce grimaced again. &quot;I know that feeling far more than you could possibly comprehend.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, I get that feeling whenever I&#39;m walking around in the mall. So I call it my mall feeling.&quot;<br><br>Deuce nimbly dodged a mini-Balrog that had made a grab for his daggers. &quot;Why exactly are you getting that feeling now?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because we had nothing to do with the Mary Sue Invasion, so therefore we reeeally don&#39;t belong here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Says who? A bunch of the newer recruits are here. See, there&#39;s that Abominable Trio I keep hearing about. Hey, they have Pan Galactic Gargle Bleeprin Blasters!&quot;<br><br>Adder raised an eyebrow. &quot;I didn&#39;t take you for a Hitchhikers Guide fan.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, please,&quot; Deuce rolled his eyes. &quot;I had it shoved in my face during training. I&#39;m completely familiar with it.&quot; Grabbing the drink, he took a sip. &quot;Well, well. It really does feel like getting your brains smashed out with a slice of lemon wrapped around a gold brick. What was I saying?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s the Bleeprin working,&quot; Adder muttered. &quot;I don&#39;t drink. And Deuce, if you get so wasted that I have to carry you back to the RC, heads will roll.

            <p>If Milask were to turn around, he&#39;d pretty much instantly see who had spoken. While Montgomery Osbert III didn&#39;t leave Operations and his training area terribly often, the 79 year old man was still fairly easy to pick out of a crowd. Even if it weren&#39;t for his obvious age, and the fact that with Makes-Things&#39; passing he was now the longest serving human Agent still active, his bearing, fairly simple attire, and the large red helmet he wore would have made him stand out. Like most of the others in the store, he was currently unarmed, and his hands occasionally fidgeted around as if he wasn&#39;t used to not carrying so much kit with him. Allowing himself to lean on the stereo a bit, he looked around the immediate area and the Agents that had started milling around.<br><br>  &quot;I&#39;m surprised this store has enough foom for so many Agents,&quot; he said, adjusting his glasses. &quot;Still, seems like there aren&#39;t terribly many of them in a festive mood. Can&#39;t say I blame them, can you? Hm...it&#39;s probably odd to ask, but I&#39;m not sure if I saw you in the fighting, chaotic as it was. Were you there? Particularly during the fighting in Operations?&quot; Perhaps it wasn&#39;t the best thing to ask on the anniversary of a fairly horrific event, but bluntness had always been Osbert&#39;s way. With his fairly advanced age, his memory could get a bit hazy at times, especially in events as chaotic as the Invasion, so he was trying to place if he had seen the other man before. Besides, it was better than awkward silence.</p>

            <p>&quot;nfortunatly I was not there for the fighting.  Leto had roped me into helping him install a new portal stabilizer here in the store.

            <p>&quot;Montgomery Osbert III, at your service. Most call me Osbert. I&#39;m one of the Agent trainers in Operations, probably why we haven&#39;t met.

            <p>Nodding, Osbert started to follow Milask over to the bar, thinking over what he should get. It had been a while since he&#39;d touched spirits, but it would help him loosen up. When Leto asked them what they would have, Osbert thought for a few seconds before making his choice. &quot;I think I&#39;ll just have some brand-&quot; he was cut off by the sound of a familiar voice on the other side of the bar and looked over, seeing a very clearly intoxicated Marcus Langston bantering with another Agent. &quot;Hold that thought,&quot; he said to Leto, moving around to the side of the bar where the two others were.<br><br>((OOC: If ye don&#39;t mind, Leto/Milask, thought we could bring this up to where Luke and Marcus are bantering, thought it&#39;d reduce clutter.))</p>

            <p>In the middle of it all, a short and fairly rotund Irishman made his way inside. Smoothing down hia hair with his hand, Gerald Murphy, best known by most as &quot;Small Murphy&quot; due to the fact that he was only about 5&#39;4, looked around his competitor&#39;s store almost nervously. It was true that he had made a lot of money off of the Invasion, but he had still thought he should at least show some respect by attending the memorial, especially when his giant of a brother threatened to smack him upside the head if he didn&#39;t. As the 6&#39;10 James Murphy (or &quot;Big Murphy&quot;) squeezed through the doorway, the brothers nodded at each other, before Gerald pulled out a flask of whiskey. While they had each decided to make sure they were about as well-dressed as they could be without being out of uniform, Gerald had never been dissuaded from bringing his own drink.<br><br>  &quot;C&#39;mon, James,&quot; he said in his thick Irish accent, looking up at his brother while taking down a swig. James really didn&#39;t look much like him, sometimes, it was almost as if they weren&#39;t really brothers. &quot;Like you said, least we can do is pay our respects.&quot;<br><br>  As the two Irish businessmen started to mingle with the crowd, Marcus made his entrance, followed by Zodfang. Instead of the usual banter, both were silent. In fact, the past week Marcus hadn&#39;t so much as said two words to anyone, even during missions, only really talking when he had to read out a charge list. The hulking Ork next to him had been trying to get Marcus fired up and talking again, but he was now silent, mostly because Marcus had quite bluntly told him that he&#39;d blow Zodfang&#39;s head off if the Ork went about any of his usual antics. Nodding to his partner, Marcus went off into the crowd, looking for anyone he knew. He felt eyes upon him, and even if they didn&#39;t say it, he couldn&#39;t help but feel like they agreed with him; he hadn&#39;t been there, he hadn&#39;t been able to fight, so what right did <i>he</i> have to be here? If he hadn&#39;t been suspended, were there people who had fallen that&#39;d be alive now? Reece, Dylan, Seth, Steven, Alex, Travis...could he have saved at least any of those men? Any others? He should have been able to fight. Agents moved wordlessly out of his way, as he made his way to a bar some Agent had set up in the corner of the General Store. Dropping himself onto one of the makeshift seats, he let out a sigh, looking up at the youngish man behind the bar, a nasty scar from the Invasion&#39;s fighting obvious on his face.<br><br>  &quot;Oh, hello,&quot; the man said, slightly surprised. &quot;Didn&#39;t see ya come up. What can I do ya for?&quot; He asked, looking at the stash of drinks he had stored under the bar. &quot;Bleepka, I bet? Bleepsynthe?&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Nah,&quot; Marcus said, shaking his head. &quot;Never thought I&#39;d say this, but just give me the real thing. Leave the bottle, don&#39;t wanna bother you by continually askin&#39; you to fill up a glass.&quot; It didn&#39;t take long before the Agent set down a glass and a bottle of vodka in front of Marcus, who nodded in gratitude as he poured some of the bottle&#39;s contents into the glass. He had told himself he&#39;d never touch alcohol again, when being drunk was what got him into the PPC, but there were extenuating circumstances, he supposed.<br><br>  Meanwhile, in another part of the crowd, agent Vincent Cyrus looked around sombrely. The rest of his group were standing around him, but they didn&#39;t seem particularly talkative either. Though he, Einarr, Greg, and Yuri had all made it out alive, it had been a close call, and they each knew several people who hadn&#39;t, especially on that barricade they&#39;d set up. Vince supposed it had been worth it though; that barricade in the middle of the corridor had stopped a lot of Sue reenforcements from making their way to Medical when the fighting there was at its hottest. &quot;This ain&#39;t much a party,&quot; he said, almost mumbling to himself. &quot;Feels more like a funeral.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Over a thousand warriors paved their way to Valhalla with the bones of the Sue invaders,&quot; Einarr said, nodding to himself. The wiry Agent and his long blond hair didn&#39;t look quite as imposing without his spear and bullet-deflecting shield, but Vince knew that even unarmed the former Viking was always holding himself ready for a brawl, even while at a party commemorating the deaths of one thousand Agents. &quot;The atmosphere is appropriate, I believe. Anything else would be disrespectful.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Da, the Norseman is right,&quot; Yuri said, his left hand unconsciously moving up to touch part of his ear that had been blown off in the fighting. The Russian usually seemed fairly jovial, seeing everything as better compared to fighting Hitler&#39;s forces on the Eastern Front, but even he was sobered. &quot;Many people died here, da? We should show our respects.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Suppose y&#39;all&#39;re right,&quot; Vince replied with a shrug, looking to Greg. The former Gear, whose skills with the Longshot sniper rifle had saved them many times over, remained silent as he sipped from his drink. He was even less talkative than usual, it seemed, so instead Vince looked around to see if there was anyone else he knew in the immediate area.</p>

            <p>Dragging her partner by his shirt, Sara entered the store and looked around.<br><br>&quot;Is this really necessary?&quot; the taller Agent grumbled, readjusting his skewed glasses.<br><br>&quot;Yes. You need to socialize more,&quot; his partner nagged, pushing him towards Cassie and Nat and scanning the room for any other familiar faces. She noted Marcus at the bar, and raised an eyebrow as she read the label on his bottle of drink. Making her way through the crowd, she tapped Zod on the shoulder.<br><br>&quot;Oi, Zod.

            <p>However, the veteran wasn&#39;t on the attack. Instead, he merely snatched the bottle out of the woman&#39;s hand, filling up the glass again before downing it all in a couple swigs. The bottle and glass were placed back, the Agent letting out a sigh and giving his new companion a pointed, if lazy, look. Had he not already been at a rather decent level of intoxication, part of him would have realised how pathetic he looked, but right now he didn&#39;t care.<br><br>  &quot;The &#39;ell is it to <i>you</i>?&quot; He asked, unable to hide the slight slur to his voice. &quot;<i>Everyone&#39;s</i> drinkin&#39;...Heh, the Bleeproducts...they just dun&#39; do the trick, y&#39;know?&quot;<br><br>  Taking another long drink, Marcus could hear the music starting to turn up, partygoers tentatively dancing to the stereo&#39;s choice of music as bit by bit some people attempted to liven the place up. Really though, he honestly couldn&#39;t care less. People had <i>died</i>, and he&#39;d never been able to do anything but stand by helplessly and try to get some of the wounded out, but here people were almost celebrating it. He just didn&#39;t get it. &quot;Well?&quot; He asked, impatiently. &quot;Wh-wha&#39;d ya want?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Looked like the strongest stuff &#39;e had,&quot; Marcus replied, placing the bottle on the opposite side of the glass from Sara. &quot;&#39;Sides, not <i>that</i> bad. Otherwise ya wouldn&#39; be drinkin&#39; it!&quot; Snickering to himself, Marcus stared at the empty glass, half listening to the song and half losing himself in his alcohol-veiled thoughts. What the hell was it so important to her for, anyway? Couldn&#39;t a man just get plastered in peace?<br><br>  Not too far from where Sara and Marcus were, Troy stared at the bar with a look of concern on his face. He had never known Marcus to act like how it looked he was acting. Part of him wanted to go over to the man he considered a friend, but at the same time, he was enjoying the music and Marcus had always preferred to take care of his problems personally. Adjusting his sunglasses, he moved onto the dance floor again, looking around for the bespectacled (and rather generously endowed, which was odd but not unheard of in the PPC) young Agent that had caught his eye a few seconds before. After all, wouldn&#39;t their dead comrades have wanted them to have fun?<br><br>   Watching the slowly filling dance floor, Gerald Murphy shrugged a bit. &quot;I can look into it later, should probably find Leto,&quot; he said to his brother. &quot;You know how business is, bro. You go have some fun for us, aye?&quot;<br><br>  Chuckling a bit, James grinned at Gerald before heading onto the floor. &quot;Aye, sure.

            <p>At first, James didn&#39;t recognise the person speaking, but after the fireworks settled down enough for him to actually focus on her voice and what she looked like, he grinned. &quot;Good to see you&#39;re alright, Jessie,&quot; he said, scratching his head a bit. Jessie was a rather frequent customer of the Murphy brothers, finding them a lot more conveniently placed than the General Store and Armoury. She also had a nice eye for what was worth selling, often bringing in pretty nice finds from her missions, which tended to fatten either Murphy&#39;s wallet significantly when another customer came around. While they weren&#39;t all that close, he did get along with her, and had actually found himself rather worried when she had been wounded. It was nice to see that she was on her feet again.<br><br>  &quot;That pistol you ordered finally came in, finding the exact model wasn&#39;t easy,&quot; he said, trying to talk over the din of the music and people dancing, finally starting to liven up from the mournful atmosphere earlier. There was respect for the dead, then there was just being a mood killer, he figured. Wouldn&#39;t they want those left behind to remember them with happiness, not despair? &quot;Once you feel up to it, just come on down with the right payment. I got the Beretta and plenty of ammunition, was actually pretty cheap. Or did you just want to chat?&quot;</p>

I&#39;ll come by later, sure. But chatting sounds like a good idea. It&#39;s not as though I&#39;m in a massive rush anywhere; for one thing, I&#39;d have to round up Luke and detach him from whoever he&#39;s hitting on first.&quot; She rolled her eyes, sure Big Murphy&#39;d know what she meant.

            <p>Shrugging as the much smaller woman apologised for the inconvenience, he snickered a bit at Jessie&#39;s description of her partner. He&#39;d met the man a few times, especially since Luke had a particular interest in collecting guns, and Jessie&#39;s description seemed pretty accurate. The guy really <i>would</i> hit on anything vaguely female, it seemed. James half wondered how the guy went through missions without trying to get in the Sue&#39;s pants. Looking around, taking advantage of his height to see clear over the heads of almost everyone in attendance, he eventually spotted what looked like Luke near the bar, talking with two other male Agents. While he couldn&#39;t make them out 100%, they looked like Osbert, one of the more well-known Agent trainers, and Langston, who was another occasional customer of his.<br><br>  &quot;Well, the good news is he&#39;s not hitting on anyone right now, unless he&#39;s suddenly decided to switch orientations on us,&quot; he told Jessie, looking back down to her. &quot;Hm, wonder where the bloody hell my brother went. Hard to keep track of someone that short sometimes. Anyway, what&#39;ve you been up to? Enjoying yourself?&quot;</p>

            <p>couldn&#39;t see Luke, so accepted what her companion said with a shrug. &quot;Can&#39;t see him doing that. He&#39;s always been after girls as long as I&#39;ve known him.&quot;<br><br>Shifting her weight from one foot to the other to ease the slight cramp, Jessie nodded at Murphy&#39;s friendly enquiry. &quot;Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve been enjoying myself as such, the occasion being what it is, but things haven&#39;t been going too badly.&quot; Resisting the impulse to touch the scar - it seemed to be tingling, for some reason - she gestured around at the dancers. &quot;Everyone else seems to be trying to have fun, so I thought I&#39;d make an effort.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;I understand that we should respect the dead, but that also means we shouldn&#39;t be letting ourselves get down in the dumps about it. I don&#39;t think they&#39;d have wanted us to waste their sacrifice like that, that would be more disrespectful than total irreverance, I believe.&quot;<br><br>  Placing his hands in his pockets so he wouldn&#39;t accidentally hit anyone or anything like that, he looked at Jessie&#39;s leg as she shifted her weight. &quot;Your leg alright?&quot; he asked, nodding to the leg that, unknown to him, had started cramping up. &quot;Can&#39;t blame you for not exactly enjoying the atmosphere, I know it still feels odd to me, but think of it as honouring our comrades the way they&#39;d have wanted to.

            <p>Though he hesitated for a second, before long he had also started to dance, trying to make out what music the stereo had changed to as he started moving to the beat. He had never been much of a dancer, but he figured he may as well try. Somehow he managed to move well enough that he didn&#39;t accidentally knock anyone out with his bulk, helped by Agents who saw the giant Irishman start to move decided to give his spot on the floor more of a berth, and eventually started to settle into a kind of rhythm, though he still didn&#39;t move as well as Jessie seemed to be. He still didn&#39;t know where his brother had gone, but he was sure the guy was doing fine on his own, even if it was odd for so many Agents to just be hanging out, no missions going on at the moment and no danger of Sues.<br><br>  <i>Funny to think this was a battlefield a year ago.</i></p>

Justified or not, her comments only served to push his buttons, which he had already been making a good showing out of pushing himself. Excluding Sues, he had never hit a woman, but the look in his eyes showed he was definitely considering knocking Sara&#39;s block off. &quot;Y-you think you&#39;re so frackin&#39; smart, dontcha?!

            <p>Seth was mildly surprised. He&#39;d known Marcus for years, had been his <i>partner</i> at one point, but he&#39;d had no idea the guy had even been at the party. Still, maybe it wasn&#39;t all that surprising.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, I know him all right, and he&#39;s just that kind of person,&quot; the DAVDer managed after listening to what Sara had to say. &quot;He&#39;s very, uhm... protective of his friends, so not being able to help them out <i>would</i> have upset him.

He hated this kind of situation, mostly because he had no idea how to deal with girls on the verge of tears. Maybe offering a hug...? No, probably not a great idea, too many Agents tended to react violently to physical contact from virtual strangers.<br><br>&quot;And, uh, I do know how you feel. I lost my partner in the invasion. He wasn&#39;t much younger than you, I think, and I feel terrible about it.&quot; Seth leaned back against the wall and sighed. &quot;Nearly ended up getting killed myself, too. But anyway,&quot; he added, trying to change the subject, &quot;what did Marcus say to you to get you so upset? He&#39;s not the kind of guy who goes around upsetting people... not on purpose anyway.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Well, I have this nickname because not many people outside Norway can pronounce my real name. In fact, that&#39;s what they say when they give up, and Krisprolls had this stupid idea of nicknaming me this. I retaliated by giving him the name of a Swedish roasted bread brand which kinda looks like his name, and South has this name because he was originally named after the most Southern part of our country.&quot;<br>&quot;Like &#39;Statsraad Lehmkuhl&#39; is <i>so</i> difficult to say.&quot;<br>&quot;What South said. By the way, I&#39;m Christian Radich and this guy is Sorlandet. And I guess you know why people called us the Infernal Trio. We totally deserve it. OK, let&#39;s go to the bar.&quot;</p>

            <p>First were Cassie and Nat, accompanied by Kelvin as usual. Although the two girls couldn&#39;t really say they knew anybody from the Invasion last year, they&#39;d taken the opportunity to meet people and have a couple of drinks - and pay their respects to the Agents whom they knew had to have died. They snagged a Bleepka cocktail each and mingled with the crowd, with Kelvin trailing behind them sipping at a glass of wine. For some reason, the Elf got nervous in crowded places and preferred to stick to the company of people he knew.<br><br>Not far behind them came two people who seemed to give off the impression that they didn&#39;t want to be associated. The taller of the two, a solidly-built man in his mid-thirties with auburn hair and an eyepatch who went by the name of Luke Celinus, looked a little serious as he entered. However, once he was able to mingle with the crowd he began to relax and flirt somewhat with the majority of the female Agents he met.<br><br>The smaller Agent, a woman coming up for thirty with red hair and the name of Jessie Lancaster, rolled her eyes and headed in a completely different direction, intending to actually commemmorate the sad events of last year.<br><br>Finally, a Japanese man wearing the DAVD flashpatch and glasses came in. Quietly sneaking over to the drinks table, he lifted a glass in memory of his teenage partner, who had died in the catastrophe, and downed it. &quot;Here&#39;s to you, Reece,&quot; he murmured.</p>

            <p>So far, the party was just starting to get fun, far as he was concerned. He still hadn&#39;t found that girl, but he was working up a good sweat dancing, had managed to put away a few nice drinks, and was overall having a good time. He did wonder where Roy went, but before he could contemplate the location of his partner much longer he emerged from the crowd at one point of the dance floor and almost knocked over a young woman that was edging around the majority of the other dancers, mostly since he&#39;d been distracted by the random fireworks.<br><br>  &quot;Gah!&quot; Jumping back a bit, he gave the girl a once-over to make sure he hadn&#39;t smashed into her, shaking his head. It looked like he&#39;d managed to get out of the way in time, at least. &quot;Heh, sorry,&quot; he said, allowing his eyes to wander behind his sunglasses. He had to admit, the girl wasn&#39;t bad-looking, though at the moment he couldn&#39;t tell if she was the one he&#39;d seen earlier. &quot;Didn&#39;t see you there until I almost plowed into ya.

            <p>Straightening himself up after introducing himself, he had another look at Cassie. She had blonde hair, and a pair of rectangular glasses that framed her face nicely, in his opinion. Not exactly short, but she was a good few inches smaller than he was, with a sort of perpetually untidy look about her, especially when she&#39;d clearly had a few too many drinks. She looked to be a bit on the chunky side, but wasn&#39;t fat or anything, looked like she had a nice shape to her.<br><br>  &quot;Nice to meetcha,&quot; Troy said, as if he hadn&#39;t been taking the time to check Cassie out. &quot;Enjoying the party so far? I thought it&#39;d be a real gloomy affair, but it&#39;s been fun. Fancy another drink? Was gonna go over and get some for myself anyway, worked up a bit of a thirst on the dance floor.&quot; Laughing a little, he looked around, finding a drinks table not too far from where they stood. &quot;There&#39;s a table right over there, if you&#39;re interested.&quot;</p>

            <p>and then back up at Troy, smiling. &quot;Nice to meet you too. And yeah, I&#39;ve been enjoying the party. Up till my friends starting taking the rip out of me for something that happened <i>ages</i> ago,&quot; she grumbled.<br><br>At the mention of drinks, she decided that she did want one. &quot;Sounds like a great idea.

            <p>&quot;I&#39;ve tried a bunch of different kinds, can&#39;t say there&#39;s one I prefer over every other,&quot; he said, following Cassie towards the table. &quot;Never tried a Sonic Screwdriver before, suppose I&#39;ll try one. Wonder if it&#39;ll be any better than Bleeprum.&quot; Reaching the table, he took a glass filled with the mentioned beverage, looking to Cass before raising the glass in a mock-toast. &quot;To canon, and the brave lads who die for it.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;That what your friends were ripping on you about?&quot; he asked her, drinking his own cocktail more carefully before setting down the empty glass and exhaling. &quot;That&#39;s pretty good stuff,&quot; he said. &quot;Not the strongest I&#39;ve ever had, but definitely pretty good.

            <p>&quot;Yeah. Getting drunk too easily, among other things... but I won&#39;t go into that now.&quot; She eyed the table for a moment, debating whether or not to get another drink, but turned her attention back to Troy as he continued talking. &quot;Hm?

            <p>Taking another drink, Troy downed it a bit less carefully than the last, closing his eyes for a moment before looking back to Cassie. &quot;Just think you should be careful,&quot; he said, smiling again. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t want someone as pretty as you getting hurt or just ending up passed out on the floor.&quot; Looking out at the partying Agents for a moment, Troy finished his glass. He hadn&#39;t expected the anniversary of something so horrific to be so festive, but that was the PPC in a nutshell, he supposed, and it wouldn&#39;t seem right any other way. <br><br>  Not wanting the woman to think he was ignoring her, though, he looked back to her after a few seconds. &quot;Heh, sorry about that, just admiring the view.

            <p>Cassie ducked her head slightly for a moment, a rather shy smile spreading across her face. &quot;Um, thanks,&quot; she muttered, taking a sizeable swallow of her drink despite her earlier decision to take it slowly.<br><br>&quot;I have to agree,&quot; she said on looking out at the party and listening to Troy&#39;s comment on it. &quot;It&#39;s certainly lively, at any rate.&quot; Tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear and pushing her glasses up again - they seemed to have an annoying tendency to slide down whenever she was trying to relax, she&#39;d noticed - she realised that she was getting a bit less sure of her balance.<br><br>&quot;Um... Troy? I think sitting down might be a good idea. Honestly, I stay sober for ages, and then all the drink hits me at once.&quot; She felt a bit silly, but he seemed sympathetic enough.</p>

            <p>Even as the silence ended, and the party was hesitantly picked up, it took him a short time before he continued to speak, looking at the young lady. He hadn&#39;t seen her during the Invasion, but it seemed like the event had no small amount of an effect on her, judging by her body language and the sniffle he had heard. He&#39;d been thinking of making a move, but at the moment it didn&#39;t seem right.<br><br>  &quot;Hey, Cass,&quot; he said, looking to her. &quot;You alright?

            <p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine,&quot; she replied, giving him a small smile. &quot;Just got a bit caught up in it all, you know?

            <p>However, he couldn&#39;t argue that it was a very pleasant surprise. Holding the woman closer, he nodded, leading her out of the Store. It took a few moments to locate the proper room, but once he found the door he opened it, allowing Cassie to go in first before following her.</p>

            <p>...Zach found himself unconsciously rubbing his arm where it had been broken in the fight. He knew he had been lucky, pulling through with only a broken arm when many of his friends had lost their lives. He glanced over at Bree and couldn&#39;t help but quirk a smile as he watched her pull them into a big, cheesy group hug.<br><br>As the two minutes ended and conversations began slowly picking up again, he whipped off his foggy glasses and cleaned them carefully on his shirt, taking the time to wipe eyes eyes. When he had replaced the spectacles he noticed, to his surprise, Nat crying. He walked over to the Welsh woman and put an arm around her, awkwardly patting her back.<br><br>&quot;Hey, hey there,&quot; he he murmured, trying his best to comfort someone he&#39;d never thought he&#39;d see cry.</p>

            <p>He&#39;d had no idea Nat even knew how to cry - nothing ever seemed to touch her feelings in that way. Fortunately, their companion seemed to be at as much of a loss as he himself was.

            <p>Zach grinned and hugged Nat back tightly. When she released him, he held her by the shoulders and smiled at her, noting amusedly that they were about the same height and that she had a nice face.<br><br>&quot;Now, no more crying, okay?

            <p>&quot;If ya so desire, m&#39;lord,&quot; she replied, trying to dredge up the old-fashioned language she remembered from watching old costume dramas at home. She took his arm, grinning hugely, and examined him as they moved towards the dance floor. &quot;Ya know, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a clumsy dork, Zach. I like ya, anyway,&quot; she observed, before leaning over and giving him a gentle kiss on the cheek.<br><br>A few seconds later, she blinked and registered what she&#39;d just done, at which point her face went bright red.<br><br>Meanwhile, Kelvin had watched his friends walk off without a backwards glance, and smiled slightly. At least they were looking happier. He leaned against the wall, just watching them quietly and feeling like a bit of a wallflower.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the Infernal Trio tried to forget the incident by drowning in Bleepka, Bleepsinthe, Bleepnapps and Bleepquila.

            <p>Hello, everyone. As we all know, yesterday was the anniversary of the Mary Sue Invasion which took the lives of 1000+ agents. However, I was too sick, tired, and overall distracted to do much of anything to commemorate the occasion. I don&#39;t know if any of you remember my post trying to gether interest in a memorial RP, it was forced off the page by the April Fools&#39; one, heh. Regardless, I am attempting such an RP on the other Board, but before I actually make the post I would like to make sure there are people interested. I know Leto (who suggested the General Store be used), Cassie, Trojie, and Gabriel are interested, are there any others among you? If nobody&#39;s gonna be interested, after all, I might as well just write an interlude. :P</p>

            <p>The space smelt vaguely of feathers, straw and disinfectant, and it was dark, and there was a suggestion of rising damp on the nearest wall, but it was perfect. Agent Trojanhorse of the Department of Bad Slash looked around it with an approving smile on her face, and dropped the cardboard box she was carrying. It raised a puff of dust as it landed.<br><br>The first thing Trojie pulled from her box was a fluorescent light tube. And a stepladder. Once she had the place properly illuminated, she extracted cleaning products.<br><br>Three days later, two concerned figures - one short, blond and male, the other tall, redheaded and female - found her mucking out practically fossilised Hippogriff dung from one of the stalls.<br><br>&#39;Trojie?&#39;<br><br>The agent in question raised her head.  &#39;Yes?&#39; she asked brightly.<br><br>&#39;Are you okay?&#39; asked Pads. &#39;I haven&#39;t seen hide nor hair of you for ages.&#39;<br><br>&#39;I&#39;m perfectly fine,&#39; said Trojie. She peered at the stall. &#39;And it looks like I&#39;m finished, too.&#39;<br><br>&#39;Finished?&#39; asked Oscar.<br><br>&#39;Yep, finished. All clean.&#39; Trojie looked around the place once more, and smiled. &#39;The Cute Animal Friend Adoption Agency is once more open for business!&#39;<br><br>***<br><br>Basically, it seems like the CAF Adoption Agency has been sadly neglected for a long time. Agent Trojie, in the interests of not filling her RC with homeless animals any more than it has already been filled, has volunteered to start it back up again. <br><br>So if anyone comes across Cute Animal Friends or miscellaneous minis for continuua who don&#39;t already have keepers of lists of minis, feel free to email me at trojanhorseshadowfax AT gmail DOT com and I&#39;ll keep track of them. And if you&#39;d like to ADOPT a retrained CAF or need a specific kind of animal for a mission (horses, dogs, etc, perhaps), feel free to get in contact with me and we&#39;ll see what I can sort out. <br></p>

            <p>Would redeemable characters from Warriorverse badfic count as Cute Animal Friends or possible agents?  They&#39;d be cats, so that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking.  There are a lot of characters in Sue-fics who are mentioned in the lists of characters and then never again or named in the fic once and given no personality, so you might need some help.  Agent Nocia would be happy to help in the Cute Animal Friends Adoption Agency, once she and Agent Kierra are written up.  My agents, Tirya_Moonflame&#39;s agents and jabbuk d&#39;eldrin&#39;s agents are currently taking care of the Mini-Sharpteeth (miniature mountain lions) from that universe.</p>

            <p>I would say the difference would be - if they&#39;re sentient/sapient, they should be Agents - if they were written in to be pets, they can come to the CAF agency :)<br><br>And help is always welcome!</p>

            <p>I love RPG&#39;s, and I happen to have only one exam left before university releases me from its clutches. Before I commit myself, I have a few questions. The answers are unlikely to significantly influence my decision, though.<br><br><br>1. It&#39;s not related to the PPC or any canon work, is it?<br><br>2. Is it time-consuming? Some very crowded and fast-paced RPG&#39;s require each player to spend about an hour per day just trying to catch up with the story before they write anything.<br><br>3. What kind of RPG is it? Is it just RP-writing, or are stats, dice rolls and a GM involved?<br><br>4. <i>We have pretty boys! =D</i> ...Here, the obvious question from a heterosexual male is: Do you have pretty girls too?</p>

            <p>Turns out there&#39;s an important family party on the Saturday evening, which I cannot miss on pain of being dismembered by outraged grandmother.

            <p>As previously mentioned there&#39;s the three-day birthday bonanza slash concerted effort to contract liver failure a few days after that weekend, and the first of the guests coming up for it arrives on the Friday.

            <p>Since there seems to be a distinct lack of anyone being able to get to the London Gathering in May, unless there&#39;s a sudden upsurge, I&#39;ve said she might as well come over to Bath and have a &quot;Gathering&quot; with Kaitlyn and me. If anyone is closer to Bath, and/or for some other reason would be able to do that but not London, they&#39;d be welcome. And of course, if more people can do London, it&#39;s easy to switch back.

If I just use one layer of fur-fabric, maybe with a bright red lining if I have time, and an opening up the front, I could make it look like a pelt. Cut the edges ragged, tear out random clumps of fur, splatter red paint and maple syrup on it, and I&#39;m done!

            <p>... or at least not to sit down in it on fabric seats in public, since the largest concentration of maple syrup and fake blood would be on the tail end, ifyaseewhatImean. (Hard to find fake blood out of Halloween season too, but there are costume shops and such which have it.) Hm. Will need a few yards of orange fur fabric, some white for the belly, and some black for the tail-tip. Buying black gloves and socks for the paws might be easier than doing the fiddly bits even if it means they aren&#39;t as fluffy as the rest - will have to remember to buy two pairs of gloves. Can cut up the unnecessary fourth glove for the nosetip and such. Some of that hard-drying modelling clay (what&#39;s it called?) would be useful for the claws and teeth. Not sure how to make the snout stay stiff, though - something to keep the snout sticking out and not flopping over my face would be useful.</p>

            <p>Any possibility of fake syrup instead? Otherwise I see plenty of comedy for your companions, but you yourself may object to being a) constantly sticky and b) chased around by demented wasps all day.</p>

            <p>Fake blood isn&#39;t a problem, I can get that from a theatrical supplies shop, but I see what you mean about the syrup. Not sure what else there is I could use that would work ... maybe mix some brown food colouring into glue and let it set so it isn&#39;t sticky any more? That way it won&#39;t wipe off either.<br><br>Of course I&#39;m still stuck explaining to family why I want to make a costume designed to look like the skin of a six-foot-tall three-armed fox that was sodomised to death by trees, but that&#39;s my problem.</p>

            <p>Glue on a few leaves and wipe it in poo, for the truly authentic look.<br><br>No clue what you could use to fake syrup. Something that sets would be best in terms of it not wiping off on everything, but you&#39;re going to want something that looks like syrup still. Not sure white glue will, y&#39;know, reflect the light and such in the right way. If you know anyone who works in a makeup department, could be worth asking them. Otherwise, good luck with the glue.</p>

            <p>If you wanted to write two pairs, you could. If you wanted to write some missions with another person, some solo, you could :) I started off by writing two solo missions, gained a writing partner for my next three, lost the writing partner, wrote another couple of solo missions (one of which I wrote solo but borrowed (with permission) another Boarder&#39;s agent as a partner for my primary agent), gained a new writing partner ... and between us now Pads and I write nine agents, one of whom was in fact invented by July, and do/have done/are doing a fair number of co-cowrites with other Boarders such as July, Sedri, Lee, Laburnum ...<br><br>Basically the whole name of the game is to a) have fun and b) mock badfic.

            <p>I started out with two Agents and planned two more.

Oh, yeah. Basically, partner up your Agents as you please, co-write as you please, etc. There are no rules about how Agents work, and there are occasional teams of PPC writers - for example, as others have said, Jay and Acacia themselves, and Trojie and Pads. Others have teamed up on occasion, too - I recall Rilwen and Lycaenion doing a piece a while back, and I seem to end up co-writing a lot of interludes for my gang with Kgarrett.<br><br>Okay, rambly rambling ending now.</p>

            <p>I started writing two agents of my own, but quite frankly, it got boring, and the only missions I&#39;ve managed are co-writes. It&#39;s really just a question of what will get your missions done, and if you can find someone to write with. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m sort of dying of overworked-ness right now. The reason cowrites work with Trojie is because we&#39;re in the same time zone and can work together in real-time, and I think that&#39;d be a lot harder for you. And my brain appears to be made of cardboard at the moment... <br><br>Could try, I suppose. It&#39;d take a lot longer if we do it on LJ or via email, but it&#39;s possible.

            <p>Actually, having gleaned what I can from the tiny, tiny preview screen, I still think FATAL is worse. I mean, Black Tokyo is all kinds of wrong, and has some pretty screwy mods (&quot;Phallic spear&quot; with 350 ft reach? WTF?), but FATAL was just badly conceived to begin with. At least Black Tokyo doesn&#39;t seem to take itself seriously. The guys at FATAL do.</p>

            <p>Clearly you have been reading the wrong poets. Because I&#39;ve got a ton of the stuff in me. I mostly put it down to a childhood diet of Dahl and Belloc.

            <p>Technically, it&#39;s actually three goodfic, but they&#39;re very closely related. I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m tooting my own horn here. They&#39;re not mine, but I have pitched the author ideas quite occasionally.<br><br>It&#39;s not every day you find notable Power Rangers fic. It&#39;s even rarer that you find GOOD Power Rangers fic. And it&#39;s a true gem of a fic that&#39;s a good Power Rangers DYSTOPIAN, SOCIAL COMMENTARY fic.<br><br>Now, I&#39;ll assume that none of you were under rocks during the &#39;90s, and therefore know who the Rangers are. These fics are a good deal darker than the show, but not so much so that they change the premise. I don&#39;t know how he pulled it off, but he did.<br><br>The first is &quot;A Future In Ruins&quot; (<a href="http://www.rangerboard.com/showthread.php?t=92403"><a href="http://www.rangerboard.com/showthread.php?t=92403">http://www.rangerboard.com/showthread.php?t=92403</a></a>). Taking place seven years after SPD (2005&#39;s season, set in the near future), the Rangers now occupy diplomatic positions in the Galactic Space Alliance. However, the GSA&#39;s president, Alan Lutler, is growing more insane and Draconian by the day, and at the same time, a union of thugs and terrorists called The Skull is bringing down democratic planets, paving the way for the United Worlds, led by the tyrannical Lord Braska, the brutal General Petrofski, and the shady Dark Venom. Are these things connected? Of course! What&#39;s good about this one is that the author, Darky, writes with complete seriousness, and somehow manages to make such reviled Ranger lore as Justin and the infamous Ninja Turtles crossover work in that seriousness.<br><br>Its prequel is &quot;Prophecies of the Morphing Grid&quot; (<a href="http://www.rangerboard.com/showthread.php?t=101503"><a href="http://www.rangerboard.com/showthread.php?t=101503">http://www.rangerboard.com/showthread.php?t=101503</a></a>), set millions of years in the past, it explores the time when ancient characters like Zordon, Ninjor, and Auric were Rangers themselves, as well as the origins of Big Bad-to-end-all-Big Bads Dark Specter. Currently on hold while he writes...<br><br>&quot;A Future in Recovery&quot; (<a href="http://www.rangerboard.com/showthread.php?t=113113"><a href="http://www.rangerboard.com/showthread.php?t=113113">http://www.rangerboard.com/showthread.php?t=113113</a></a>). After Lutler&#39;s defeat, his authoritarian policies are reactivated by a shadowy cabal of business leaders in response to terrorist attacks spearheaded by The Shredder, enemy of the Ninja Turtles, and three alien mystics comprising the diabolic Pentastar Federation. At the throttle of both sides is Mordecai, a monster who escaped from the future of the &quot;Time Force&quot; season. Along the way, the Rangers discover some shocking truths about SPD, Time Force, and some well-known conspiracy theories. Each villain represents a real social evil, such as greedy business practices, cults, dictatorship, and sleazy lawyering. So, essentially, the premise is that the people we wanted to be as a kid are beating up on the people we hate in real life. There&#39;s a lot more to it than that, but it&#39;s a satisfying idea. He provides a behind the scenes section to look up the conspiracy theories and aliens he uses. There&#39;s some &quot;crossover-but-not-really&quot; elements to this one; i say &quot;but-not-really&quot; because the justification is the same one used for the Ninja Turtles in the show: each party thought the other was fictional until they actually met.<br><br>Hope you enjoy it.</p>

            <p>And they&#39;re from some of my favorite fandoms, too! I&#39;m not sure if these qualify, but I think they sure show signs of plenty of plot holes. And Sues. And more Sues.

            <p>While I haven&#39;t read the Immortals series for a very long time, the Tortall-verse fic is just terrible. Rainbow eyes, SUPER-SPESHUL sparkly green hair, and more power than just about anyone Canon? I&#39;d be willing to bet twenty diamonds that the main character&#39;s a Sue. *reads past Chapter 1* ...Wait, what? Antlers? &#39;Dark cream&#39; skin? And she&#39;s resurrected at least once? Definitely a Sue. She should be killed. Repeatedly, until that damned resurrection stops.<br><br>The HP-verse fics look pretty bad. The second one has terrible grammar, a bad plot, and bad biology on top of it. Nobody enters puberty at 10, barring an extreme biological fluke. *facepalm*<br><br>The author&#39;s note at the end was worth a cheap laugh though - &quot;want others to Wright good stories&quot; made me imagine a very confused Phoenix Wright suddenly popping up in the fic.<br><br>Oh, and... *hands over a few bottles of Bleepto-Dismal*</p>

            <p><i>Nobody enters puberty at 10, barring an extreme biological fluke.</i><br><br>Beg to differ on that one. I couldn&#39;t quote you any statistics, but the onset of puberty in girls has been getting younger and younger. Back in the nineties, they reckoned 14 was about right for starting your period. By the time I turned 14, most of the girls in my class already had ages ago. These days 12 seems to be the average, or at least that&#39;s the impression I get. Puberty at ten is certainly not bog standard, but it&#39;s not uncommon either.<br><br>*removes biology hat*</p>

I mean, would they really want an AI like her in the computer network?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m new, a hopeful-recruit-within-a-month, and an anti-Sue person. I just want to say &quot;hello&quot;, point out badfics, become a new recruit sometime before I die, and not get too many messages regarding the fact of whether I have indeed read the PPC Constitution yet. (Yes, I know there is no &quot;Rule 15&quot;.) <br>I attack mostly MSs, (Mary Sues, Marty Stus, Marty Sams, Mentally Stupids, etc. Whatever you like to call them is fine with me.), from the Redwall, Tamora Pierce, and original fiction* categories. <br>Before you ask, I am a fan of LotR, (I&#39;m guessing most on this board are), and I&#39;m a fan of HP. However, I think most people here are attacking the Mary Sues from LotR and HP Mary Sues are a headache I don&#39;t think even Bleepka could deal with. Oh well.<br><br>In short, hello to you all!<br><br>~ Cinnia Aine ~ <br><br>*Not ALL original fiction, mind you. It&#39;s just the REALLY obvious Mary Sues that irk me.

            <p>Guess where I&#39;m going to be assigning my Agents to.<br><br>Incidentally, this is the charge list for just ONE of those above fics:<br><br>Interim Charge List:<br>Both:<br>-Setting the story in the future for no reason (2030? Wha?)<br>-Writing incredibly clichйd romance and Twu Luv and &#39;magic vows&#39;<br>-Writing Mary Sues<br>-Having an incredibly stupid title too: “Freedom Love, Till Death Never Do Us Part”... wha?<br>-Using the term &#39;zombie&#39; - L4D&#39;s not using the Z-word here! It&#39;s the Infected all the way...<br>-Using Author&#39;s Notes to explain the plot<br>-Keeping up to date with events in an Infected town using the NEWSPAPERS. Zombie apocalypse, and they&#39;re still delivering NEWSPAPERS?<br>-Explaining things the reader will already know (Yes, we about the Infected types. We do not need your input. And how exactly would the advice of a sword-swinging Marty Stu actually help or apply anyone normal, anyway?)<br>-Claiming the Infected only come out at night (contradicts Canon)<br>-Missed capitalisations (&#39;mercy hospital&#39;)<br>-Contradicting the Canon plotline (L4D does NOT take place in 2030, thank you)<br>-Contradicting it&#39;s own plotline (notably about where the Infection starts and spreads from).<br>-Trying to describe characters using their clothing.<br>-Witch howls attract Tanks. Um, no they don&#39;t. Hell, the Director specifically avoids sticking Tanks and Witches together!<br>-Tanks can NOT throw planes, thank you.<br>-The Smoker&#39;s tongue is not &#39;wet, slippery rope&#39;.<br>-Accumulating a ...ing huge charge list from just under 6000 words (Annoys the Agents)<br>-Addendum the above: having enough charges on it&#39;s own to generate a charge list to use for charging other L4D fics. That&#39;s quite the achievement there, mate<br>-Having by and large good grammar and spelling... and still writing crap<br><br>Ms. Brenda Lightstar:<br>-Having a name that sounds like it&#39;s from the Star Wars continuum<br>-Addendum to the above: Having a very stupid name<br>-Surviving on your own for a month without getting Hunter&#39;d<br>-”the horde doesn&#39;t give me too much of a problem” - she is so going to regret saying that.<br>-Surviving with just two pistols against the horde without a problem (ahem!)<br>-Addendum to the above: And then proving completely useless and having to be regularly rescued once her Twu Luv shows up<br>-Describing her boyfriend as &#39;her angel&#39;<br>-Being physically incapable of living without said boyfriend<br>-Lying to said boyfriend about the origins of the Infected (only explanation that makes sense)<br>-Having &#39;pure black&#39; eyes (what the crap? Is she infected too?)<br>-Makes Mr. Stoic Awesomeness smile only at her<br>-Being able to kill infected before her Supah Spechul Twu Luv can spot them<br>-Using the actual goddamn phrase &#39;one true love&#39;<br>-Being unaware that Freedom is equipped to fight when he carries around a GIANT ...ING SWORD.<br>-Annoying the Agents (at least Freedom has some justification for being able to survive on his own)<br>-Being a Mary Sue<br><br>Mr Melodian Freedom:<br>-Being an Infected without becoming... y&#39;know, a freakin&#39; zombie<br>-Being a &#39;Spechul Infected&#39;<br>-Combining all the Infected abilities with none of the drawbacks<br>-And in spite of the above, using a goddamn sword<br>-Killing a TANK with aforementioned goddamn sword in ONE swipe<br>-In addendum to the above, doing the same thing to a Witch<br>-In addendum to the above, doing the same thing to an AIRPLANE<br>-Being able to decapitate 10 infected a second (Yes, it actually says that)<br>-Being able to insta-kill Infected with his goddamn EYES.<br>-Claiming not to be an Infected to gain Twu Luv&#39;s trust. He is, and has stated as such<br>-Having the stupidest name ever<br>-Having the stupidest nickname ever<br>-Trying to create some sort of mysterious backstory with a mysterious government conspiracy and mysterious amnesia.<br>-Being a super-strong, angelic, &#39;aloof and lonely&#39; fantasy boyfriend<br>-Trying to make himself a lust object (I&#39;m getting some SERIOUS Twilight vibes here)<br>-Wearing white leather with a big sword like some sort of Final Fantasy character<br>-Being so awesome he emits white light<br>-Having multi-coloured eyes<br>-Having colour-changing eyes<br>-Being so awesome everyone is afwaid of him and he is all awwone. Aww, poor thing, NOT.<br>-Becoming as weak a sick puppy around his Twu Luv<br>-And then completely annihilating a Horde (complete with Tank and Witch) in spite of the above<br>-Being so awesome because of some freakin&#39; vow.<br>-Giving advice on teamwork when he works alone<br>-Being willing to give his life for his Twu Luv despite &#39;not feeling the love I had yet though&#39;<br>-Claiming &#39;by gut instinct&#39; that the Poles will have less infected. This should be freakin&#39; obvious what with it being really cold and uninhabited and that...<br>-Being able to withstand a Tank punch<br>-Being able to dodge multiple Tank punches<br>-Annoying the Agents<br>-Being a Marty Stu<br><br>I am going to enjoy PPC-ing this one.</p>

            <p>My books are Well of Lost Plots by Jasper Fforde, Farenheit 451, Little Women, and I&#39;ll switch one of the movies for another book if you don&#39;t mid; probably Candy Girl by Diablo Cody (Something every mature-aka, probably sixteen and up--girl (and guy) should read, about the world of strippers. She worte the script for Juno, and she spent a year as a stripper, it&#39;s her memoir and so utterly fantastic.)<br><br>Movies would be either Singin&#39; in the Rain or Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (that&#39;s the problem with musical movies from the fifties; all the same, but still so gorgeous), Ratatouille (fooood), Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, and all of House, MD.

            <p>Hmmmm, well, books...<br>One book about cooking in difficult conditions,<br>One book about how to identify poisonous stuff you don&#39;t want to eat/touch/get stung by on a desert island (and how to treat said poison without the aid of synthetic antitoxins),<br>And probably a collected edition of all Tolkeins work (Including Mr Bliss, which is still one of the funniest childrens books ever).<br><br>Movies, probably Ameile, Spirited Away, Bugsey Malone, Sound of Music and Casablanca.<br><br>Alternatively a book about how to make a boat and sail around the world in it would be good!<br><br>This is rather like the premise of a popular BBC Radio 4 show, except it is three books plus the complete works of Shakespere and the Bible and five pieces of music.</p>

            <p>So I went on the rants and raves section of Craigslist.org....<br><br>It has to be worse than any badfic I&#39;ve ever read, want to know why? They go on about politics. But no, not any normal and educated political debate or argument; half the posts are pictures of monkeys (with edited photos of our current President).<br><br>I understand the discontentment for the other side, really, I do. I get that had McCain been voted in there would most likely be similar posts to what is being done to Obama. What I don&#39;t understand is why there is no actual political argument, all the contents are just crude picture after crude picture. Based on his race no less, not on his actions so far as our President.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;m just being hypocritical, since I would see pictures of Bush and find them funny. Yet, I didn&#39;t see such a racial comparison of him; most of the time they weren&#39;t even edited (the guy held an American Flag backwards, good for giggles).<br><br>This post isn&#39;t here to spark a debate. I don&#39;t mind that someone would dislike our current President. There has not been a time everyone was happy for the elect. I just wish, you know, that people could refrain from such a personal, offensive, and downright depraved exclamation of their dissatisfaction.<br><br>I&#39;m not asking everyone love one another, but at least offer an amount of respect.... :(</p>

            <p>Sadly, this happens anytime anyone argues politics, or anything, really, on the internet. With complete anonymity and a captive audience, people will exhibit despicable behavior because they know they can get away with it. Of course, some people do it just to get attention (trolls) but some really are just that loony, and the internet gives them a voice. <br><br>My advice: Stay out of arguments in general on the internet. After all, we all know the aphorism: Arguing on the internet-&gt;Special Olympics, etc. </p>

            <p>Engineering out the bigot gene? If only it were that simple. Genetics doesn&#39;t actually work that way, which is probably a good thing, because I&#39;m told eugenics is a bit of a murky path to tread. (Unless I&#39;m in charge of who gets offed and who gets to breed, of course, but ymmv).<br><br>Not sure where I read it, probably Dawkins, but we&#39;re just great at respect and treating each other well, but only in small tribe-sized groups. Start dealing with groups as large as countries, and there are just too many people involved for the brain to recognise them all as real people. And respecting a faceless automaton is a bit tricky, really.</p>

            <p>No one remembers this, do they? (Ah, you Oldbies don&#39;t count) It&#39;s a fine old PPC tradition. Basically (and it is very basic), someone (that&#39;s me!) posts a number of (real) fanfic summaries (doesn&#39;t have to be badfic, either!), and you (the Boarders) write a story to fit them and clear up the plotholes in them. Just a short, silly story (I need to stop making these parenthetical asides), which has nothing to do with the original story. It&#39;s not a PPC mission, it&#39;s a story fitting the summary (misinterpret at will). And yes, you can do one someone&#39;s already done.<br><br>Let&#39;s see now... (all summaries taken from the first four pages of FF.net&#39;s LotR section).<br><br>1. <i>Ignis</i><br>Sauron’s daughter, who was born and raised in modern America, is pulled to another world, right in the middle of the war of the Ring. Not your average Mary Sue.<br><br>2. <i>Crisis on Middle Earth</i><br>Epic, funny tale about a girl with her friends and several enemies who are transported to the LOTR dimension.

Perhaps that distant thunder would come down from the mountains and shower the Last Homely House with a gentle, well shower. At least, that was Erestor&#39;s thought process until it was suddenly derailed by a large shadow falling over him, and the realisation that <i>that wasn&#39;t thunder.</i><br><br>&quot;Erestor, my love, the moon of my delight! Will you not now accept this humble token of my affection?&quot;<br><br>With a sigh, Erestor put his scroll down and turned. &quot;Glorfindel,&quot; he said heavily. &quot;I&#39;m sure the explanation for this will be stunning.&quot; &#39;This&#39; was a ten-ton grey beast more than fifteen feet tall, with huge flapping ears, massive white tusks, an appallingly prehensile nose, and a certain blond Balrog-slaying elf on its back.<br><br>&quot;Do you not recall, oh star of my heart&#39;s desire?&quot; Glorfindel asked, in the same tone he&#39;d been using ever since that wood-elf from Mirkwood had convinced him he&#39;d been fed a love potion. &quot;You promised that if I were to bring you an oliphaunt from the far distant lands, you would consider my--&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;Not even&#39;, Glorfindel,&quot; Erestor grated. &quot;My words were &#39;<i>Not even</i> if you rode in on the back of an oliphaunt.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... oh.&quot; Glorfindel looked non-plussed. &quot;Um... I guess I&#39;ll take it back, then?&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>Your turn.<br><br>hS</p>

He didn&#39;t know where, apart from the fact it looked like a fantasy world. South would have told him which one, but he wasn&#39;t there. Well, Krisp would have to find out by himself.<br>He was currently into some woods, with, well, random trees and other various plants he couldn&#39;t tell which they were because he wasn&#39;t a botany geek. Well, in any case he would have been screwed. Nobody in the Infernal Trio was a botany geek.<br>Krisp walked a bit around and stumbled on some underground city, full of funky people with pointed ears. Vulcans, maybe. OK, so they were Vulcans. He would teach them how to have fun. It was clever of him to keep the lighter and the aerosol bomb.<br>Krisp wandered around until he found a place full of people. He then lit his lighter and sprayed the aerosol bomb on it. He shouted &#39;SURPRISE, HAHAHAHAHA&#39; and ran toward the crowd. The Vulcans were a little bit more emotional than expected, but they managed quite well to evacuate. Krisp chased them in the corridors, almost burned himself on several occasions and still managed to make some people panic.<br>Then he ended up in a small gray room, where two other guys were shouting at him.<br>&quot;Krisp, will you stop this? Oh my glod, you went flamethrower-crazy!&quot;<br>&quot;Where have you been?&quot;<br>&quot;Oh, sorry, guys, I just arrived... I was in some funky place full of weird Vulcans, I was having a little fun, and I didn&#39;t realize I was back here...&quot;<br>&quot;And you got FLAMETHROWER-CRAZY on the people there???

            <p>I have to add a disclaimer to this, I do not own LotR nor to I own Bold Font, though she is a good friend.  Sorry for any and all spelling mistakes, I have no spell check right now.<br><br><br><br>Leto and Milask were sitting in the PPC General Store during a very odd quiet time.  The minis were stocking the shelves with latest barterings from the agents, one notable thing to come in recently was a box from the Who verse.  No not a Tardis, but it relied on many of the same principles.<br><br>Milask is humanoid cat standing about 150cm (5 feet), was lounging in the back room when his fur stood on end.  &quot;What is happening out there Leto?&quot;<br><br>Leto, a young (dare I say it) man called back, &quot;what do you mean?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am getting this creapy fealing that something has come up that needs emergency repair,&quot; Milask yelled back.  &quot;Just when I was about to nod off, too.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What ever it is, we will just send it to HQ.  They owe us enough...&quot; Leto finished with a mutter.<br><br>Milask tried to go back to that semi vegitative state that he loves to assume when he got the chance.  It wasn<code>t often, specially when his best friend</code>s wife was a dragon.  Literally.  She could transform into any form and size that she wanted, due to the ability to share L-space.  Currently she was in her lab trying to make some new concotions to sell.  Her form was that of a 14 year old Japanese girl.  Milask would call her jail bait if he wasn<code>t affraid of getting his head bitten off figuatively by Leto and litterally by the dragon herself.  Life is interesting, not necessarily safe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Milask couldn</code>t get to sleep, the pressure to his sixth sence was starting to get uncomfortable.  Like when someone scratching in one place constantly for about an hour.  <br><br>&quot;Are you sure nothing is happening out there?&quot;  Milask yelled out to Leto.  There was no reply.  &quot;What?  You trying to be funny now?&quot;  Milask jumped to his feet and went to the door that lead to the store proper.  Something was telling him that he was not going to like what he would see on the other side.<br><br>Instead of yanking the door open like he was origionally planning he cautiously opened the door a small amount.  Only to have the door punch him in the gut when Smeagul, the mini-balrog, pushed it forcefully from the other side.  Smeagul was not happy.  Now Milask<code>s curriosity was truly stilled.  There is truth in the maxim</code>curriosity killed the cat<code>and Milask had already lost a couple.  It was times like this where he didn</code>t know if he is glade or not about the minis ablity to speak.  All he knew was the Smeagul what mad.<br><br>&quot;Calm down, I<code>m sure that we can fix what ever is out there.  Is Leto still out there?&quot;  When Smeagul shook his head, Milask knew he was in for &lt;i&gt;Interesting Times&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Don</code>t worry, I am sure that we can get your toy back,&quot; Leto hated when Milask refered to him as Smeagul<code>s plaything.  But being a cat, Milask didn</code>t care.<br><br>Going back to the door, Milask opened it fully.  Smeagul got out, so there couldn<code>t be anything dangerous in the immidiate vacinity.　What he saw was the black box in the middle of the floor, crap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking his time, Milask went to the shelves and graped a portal generator, a couple of disguse kits and a emergency kit.  The only place where he would blend in would be the &lt;i&gt;Rifts&lt;/i&gt; continuum and the later age of &lt;i&gt;Dr Who&lt;/i&gt;.  Not a very broad range.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then he touched the box.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Milask woke up in a place that could only be described as downtown Brooklyn.  Leto was beside him in his shop clothes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;</code>Bout time you got here,&quot; Leto said to him.  &quot;Unfortunatly, the portal generator doesn<code>t work and for once it isn</code>t because you landed on it and brock it.&quot;  <br><br>It is common knowledge that no matter where you packed the generator.  Be it in its own hard case or in the middle of a backpack, you will fall on it and it will break.  Depending on how you packed it, that call be a very painful fall.  The experienced agent will just carry it in his or her back pocket and have repair tools as part of his kit.<br><br>&quot;I don<code>t think that this is a regular mission,&quot; Leto commented.  &quot;I mean, this world is fully formed and real.  I almost got hit by a taxi after waking up.  Wonder what is happening.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Well we better find out fast, this disguse itches,&quot;  Milask complained.  Never mind that the disguses only bent light, Milask said that he could feal it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leto rolled his eyes at him and started looking around.  Some music was comming from an open window.  &quot;Wonder what that is...&quot;  Milask started walking over to the window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inside was a girl sitting at a computer with the lable IGNIS in bold letters across the top of the moniter and a LotR game playing.  &quot;Daddy Sauron, can you get me some water please, I am at a difficult part of the war and I am thirsty!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Okay, that was strange..&quot;  Suddenly a tugging fealing at their navel caught them both and the scene went blank, they both passed out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The woke to find themselves in a desert.  Now being of the variety of being that is covered in fur and dark fur at that, the sun was uncomfortable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Hey, aren</code>t those the Blue Mountains over there,&quot; Leto said pointing.  &quot;What are we doing in ME?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don<code>t know, but what is with this desert?&quot; Milask replied, &quot;I thought this area was forests.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;That would put up in Elven territory then, we better change our disguses then,&quot; Leto muttered.  He fiddled on the dial on Milask</code>s and his own disgise generator changed them to elf.<br><br>At this point a group of young women crested a dune not that far away.  Their bickering started to get heated (pun intended).  One was crying and one was rolling her eyes at everything.  &quot;And where are you precious elves.&quot; Was heard by the two men.<br><br>At that point, one of the girls saw them.  The squwee must have been heard by the dogs in the southern deserts.<br><br>&quot;HOT ELVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;  Leto never saw this in his life, but this girl was now in the middle of a flying glomp, and Milask was the target.<br><br>Milask side stepped yelled back, &quot;Yes, I am a hot elf.  The heat is killing me.&quot;  To the girl that was now rolling down rest of the dune.  &quot;Are you responsible....&quot;  The tugging sensation came again and the two men passed out again.<br><br>**********************<br><br><br>When the revied again Leto started to get the fealing that he has done this before, but couldn<code>t remember where, or how he got out of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This time they found themselves in more of a Rohan type area.  &quot;Guess we will have to go back to human.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Could you say that with a little less disgust, I am human you know,&quot; Leto said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;You aren</code>t the one who has to make sure that your tail doesn<code>t exit the field,&quot; Milask shot back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, Jane, Leto</code>s wife, popped into exsistance.  She didn<code>t look happy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;What.  Am.  I. Doing. Here?&quot; she accused the men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Love, I have no idea.  We just found ourselves here ourselves.&quot;  Leto said.  &quot;We just start to figure out what is going on, then we find ourselves somewhere else.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Oh crap.  We are in a Fill-the-Plothole.&quot;  Jane said, she only looked fourteen currently, if you found out her true age, she would have to kill you.  Not even Leto knew how old his wife was.  But he did hear a funny story about Rome in its hayday that sounded...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fealing clicked in Leto.  &quot;Great, we have have to get through these, then we can leave.  that is why the portal generator isn</code>t working.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You two maybe, but as soon as this scene is finished, I am out of here.  Someone has to look after the hatchlings while you are here,&quot; Jane said.  &quot;Oh, and don<code>t waste time.  You know how the minis get when you leave them alone for too long.&quot;  Jane said with an evil grin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From out of nowhere a battle started.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Did you bring any weapons?&quot; Leto asked Milask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;No,&quot; came the rueful replie.  &quot;I thought that we could portal right out of here as soon as I found you.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Then, RUN.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The three of them took off in different directions, soon they lost eachother.  Que tugging sensation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Milask and Leto awoke to find themselves in a chaotic area.  The land was not keeping still.  Now that the boys figued out what was happening, they just let it go on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon they cam uppon a man that was spewing a strange aura.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I thought that Bold Font kept him locked away in her sub conciousness.&quot;  Leto said.  &quot;Nothing good can come of this...&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thankfully that was when the tugging sensation came.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They woke to find themselves in a wilderland, and it was wilderous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;What is that?&quot; Milask asked.  It looked like there was an elf floating by.  &quot;Wait, I thought that we were in ME.  There is no flying elves in ME.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Well, only if they are being flown somewhere by eagles,&quot; Leto replied.  &quot;Those things are huge.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A huge pressure come over the whole area, it felt like the pressure of logic.  Just when it seamed as if there eyes where about to pop out, and eagle can into existance under the elf and they flew away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Guess that solves that...&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TUG  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They were woken by music.  Leto</code>s musical education was not that good, but he knew a bad chord when he heard one.  And this song had one.<br><br>&quot;Hey, isn<code>t this Mirkwood?&quot;  Milask asked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;You know, I think you are right,&quot; Leto replied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After wandering around for a bit, something shifted in Milask</code>s vision and building poped into view.  &quot;Wowww, I think that we beter get out of here.&quot;<br><br>Milask lead them to along a path that seemed to leave to area.  Luckly they were still in elven disgises.  Soon they came uppon an whining sound.  Since that seemed to be the only thing happening, Milask followed it and found a fighting erik.<br><br>There was what looked like a crying elf in the sand and one holding a practice sword standing nearby talking to another elf.<br><br>&quot;I only got one strike to the head in and then he started crying like he did when he first came her as a child.  I have no idea what went wrong.&quot;  The one with the sword said.<br><br>&quot;Give him another strick to the head, that may fix it,&quot; said the other elf.  &quot;I have seen this once before a couple of hundred years ago, that was what fixed it for me.&quot;<br><br>The man approached the black haired elf gave him a good thawk to the head.  After the one on the ground came to himself again, 20 minutes later.  &quot;Oww, my splitting head.  What happened?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I got a lucky strick in my lord, your lord father came at once when you passed out,&quot; said the elf holding the sword.  &quot;How are you fealing now, other than the headacke?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Like I just want to put my childhood behind me, I don<code>t know why...&quot;  Legolas said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tug  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They woke to find themselves sitting in the back of a classroom while the class was in full swing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;What the hell,&quot; Milask muttered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The teacher in the front of the room was looking at the black board with a</code>oblivious gavze<code>.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;What are we doing here?&quot; Leto asked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a scratching of a pencil near by when where was no one else writing.  They were busy trying to figure out what a</code>gavze<code>and if it will be on the next test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, Milask could not stand it anymore and stood up and walked over the writting student.  &quot;Hey Leto,&quot; Milask called out.  &quot;I think we have out culprit right here.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Milask pulled the pencil out of the student</code>s fingures and the tugging sensation came back.<br><br>***************************<br><br>When they woke, they found themselves at a zoo.  This was not an orginary zoo, it was a zoo in Middle Earth.  They knew this because they were looking at two great big oliphants.<br><br>Above the cage were the signs Erestor and Glorfindel.  Now normally when you have two males of any spcies together they will drive the other one off.  That didn<code>t seem to be the case here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;What is happening here,&quot; Milask asked.  &quot;Wait, they aren</code>t going to...  No, NOOOOOO.&quot;<br><br>At this point the tugging sensation came and not a moment too soon.<br><br>***********************<br><br>&quot;Well I hope you have had your fun boys.&quot; Jane said when they came too.  &quot;The hatchlings need to be fed.  There is a cow to be quartered in the back, just give them a chunk of that.  I have to go to HQ and get that box dealt with.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Love you too, dear,&quot; Leto replied and went to find his children.  &quot;Man, I have a headacke.  And don`t you dare say anything, anything at all...&quot;<br><br>Milask just laughed and went back to the staff room.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Hope you liked that!  I tried to add logic to all the stories.  Leto</p>

<li>The Best Maths Class EVER!<br>This was actually written during Maths under the oblivious gavze of our wonderful Teacher. We hope you like it.<br><br>Jen and Cassie did their best to stifle a giggle as they swapped the piece of paper between desks. It was Maths Class, but through a (in their eyes) wacky trail of &#39;coincidences&#39; involving a certain movie, teenage hormones, teenage boredom and general teenage silliness, it was quickly developing into something else entirely.<br><br>The best part was probably that they looked completely innocent doing it. Writing on a piece of paper in the middle of a class of people writing on pieces of paper? Completely innocent, clearly! The Teacher even smiled at them as it did it&#39;s cursory gavze of the classroom. They smiled back, careful to keep what they were actually doing well hidden beneath the textbook. Jen had forgotten hers, leaving her to share with Cassie and leading to their current enterprise. The Teacher trundled past to lock on to a pair of boys in the back spending their time in a more obviously unproductive way.<br><br>Cassie had scribbled something in the margin. &quot;goin 2 put this on ff?&quot;<br>Jen grinned. &quot;yep!! XD&quot;<br>&quot;awesome!&quot;<br>&quot;this is the best story eva!&quot;<br>&quot;lol XD!&quot;<br>Jen sniggered and reviewed what they&#39;d written so far, ignoring the whirring and screaming as the Teacher converted to Combat Mode against the boys at the back. It had Leggy and Aragorn in, who wouldn&#39;t love it?<br>The two girls looked at each other and grinned. This was the best Maths Class EVER!</li>

            <p>Thranduil, Legolas, and the rest of their hunting party rode to the village at breakneck speed, chastising themselves for not evacuating the inhabitants when Dol Guldur&#39;s power begean to extend to Mirkwood&#39;s northern reaches.<br><br>When they got there, all was in chaos. Many of the villagers were former warriors, some of them veterans of the War of the Last Alliance, and thus were able to defend themselves better than most. Several militia and border the troops had also arrived from their postings, and while their numbers were inadequate, they still put up enough of a fight to delay the orcs. <br><br>Thranduil let off a couple of bowshots from horseback, and then charged; scattering the attackers. The rest of the party followed suit.<br><br>They fought for the next several minutes, rallying the defenders to rout the orcish raiders.When the fighting was over, they spoke to the village leader, an elf who,after Oropher&#39;s death, had foresworn war and settled down in this once-peaceful part of the kingdom.<br><br>&quot;Forgive us for coming late to this battle. We were only informed some time earlier in the morning.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Milord, this village woudn&#39;t have survived if you hadn&#39;t come. I thank you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The rest of the party will stay here and help the people rebuild; while I and Legolas go back to the wounded warrior who alerted us to this raid.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Very well. Farewell!&quot;<br><br>Legolas and his Father rode back to where they had found the wounded man, and were relived to find out he was still  alive. They had wanted to leave one of the party members with him, but he had insisted that <i>all,</i> of them must go, so as to increase the chances of victory. <br><br>&quot;The village has been saved. Are you all right? The wound doesn&#39;t look fatal, but it may have come from a poisoned blade.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good. I&#39;m...glad that you got there in time.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let&#39;s take you to the halls, then.&quot;<br><br>After bringing the warrior inside the tunnels, Legolas and his father went into his private study, where They discussed the ramifications of the attack.<br><br>&quot;They&#39;ve never come so near to our home before. That means that they&#39;re getting bolder, and that there&#39;s a reason for it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Necromancer?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes. We must be wary. If only those fools had listened to Gandalf when he told them that Dol Guldur must be attacked, and soon.&quot; <br><br>&quot;It was Saruman that swayed them, <i>ada</i>. Remember, even we tought it was a good desicion.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, but no longer. When the next meeting comes, we shall join Gandalf in asking for an attack, and not rest until we have made the thrat clear.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I hope we suceed, <i>ada</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If we don&#39;t, then our time in Middle-Earth is short.&quot;<br><br><br><br></p>

            <p><i>3. friendship over no bounds<br>three friends end up in middle earth seperated and have to fight in the war for the rings disclaimer i do not own anything from the tolkiverse</i><br><br>Max blinked and looked around. He&#39;d just been smoking pot down behind the changing rooms on the park with his best mates, and now he was in this whole other place. There were men in armour rushing all over the place, and people were yelling in a strange language and everyone was carrying absolutely lethal looking swords.<br><br>Determined to find out what was going on, Max went up to one of the men yelling orders. Before he could say anything the man turned and glared at Max, before grabbing his arm and dragging him towards one of the buildings that men were coming from.<br><br>Half an hour later, Max was wearing the same armour as everyone else, with a white tree emblazoned on his chest and a sword at his side that he had no idea how to use. <br><br>--<br><br>Tim sat uncomfortably on the horse he&#39;d been given, shifting slightly to try and ease muscles sore from several days of riding. It&#39;d been years since he was last on a horse, but he still remembered some of the basics, which was all to the good since he didn&#39;t think any of the men surrounding him were about to give lessons to a beginner. Not that he would understand them at any rate, since none of the bastards seemed to speak English. He&#39;d been conscripted into an army whose language he didn&#39;t speak and whose weapons he couldn&#39;t use, to fight a war that he didn&#39;t even know the meaning of.<br><br>&#39;If I was gonna slip through the Rift or whatever, why couldn&#39;t I have ended up in the Napoleonic era or later. Somewhere with guns,&#39; he thought, &#39;not swords and spears and shit that doesn&#39;t even make a decent noise when you use it.&#39;<br><br>A horn sounded and the column of horses unfolded into a line. Tim found himself near one of the ends, but not so near that he could slip away unnoticed. He knew what would come next now that a line had been formed, and for all his bravado normally, he didn&#39;t want to kill a man for a reason that he wasn&#39;t sure of. He didn&#39;t think that the other side would give him a choice though.<br><br>--<br><br>Stuck in the middle of a marching column of armed men, James felt like he was going to die. When he&#39;d been found by the side of the road, alone and dazed, he&#39;d been given a sword and shoved into the column. Everywhere he looked the men were as dark-skinned, or darker, than he was. There wasn&#39;t a white person in sight, and James was starting to get the bad feeling that white people would be the enemy. <br><br>Ahead, lying limp in the still air, he could see a red flag with a black serpent on it, all the way at the front of the soldiers. It was heavily guarded, the spear points of the men around it gleaming in the sun, and James quickly decided to stay away from anything that required that much protection. Between that and the monster elephants at the very back, James reckoned he&#39;d be lucky to survive his &#39;own side&#39;, let alone the enemy.</p>
