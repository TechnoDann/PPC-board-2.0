            <p>...someone going by &quot;Ugolino&quot; asked for a link to a story mentioned (but left unnamed) on the &quot;Villain Sue&quot; entry on TVTropes.  Considering the fandom and the details, that sounds like a piece called &quot;Stand of the Exiles,&quot; which I sporked on a blog a few months ago.  <br><br>Much fanwank resulted, so I don&#39;t want to link to the damn thing directly.

            <p>This is along the lines of the chose your own adventure plot bunney a couple weeks ago.<br><br>The idea is, you are reading through a fic from the characters perspective, when you make your choice in the story, if it is not the <code>sue choice, you go along in the story.  If you take the</code>sue choice, you get visited by agents and the story ends.  (It may have to be a couple of chices but I really haven:t figured that part out yet)<br><br>I was thinking that an existing good fic could be used for this and side story lines could be written in by many people.<br><br>Is this a good idea?  It would be a break from the regular agent perspective and have it from the `sues perspective.<br><br>Leto</p>

            <p>I had a similar idea: an entire PPC fic from the POV of the Sue or the brainwashed canons. The latter would be similar to one of the POTC Mara stories in which Grimes is aware of the Agents.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve had a tough time getting access to the British Life on Mars television show. I&#39;d be more than willing to rent it from the video store, but there is no domestic import; while I&#39;ve managed to get my hands on copies from Britain, the DVD format is different and messes with my laptop. You&#39;d think that if a show was so  appealing to people that various countries <i>around the world</i> are remaking the series, it would be a good idea to export the original, but noooo...<br><br>Sorry, this has been a long-running pet peeve. I&#39;ll stop ranting now.<br><br>Also, while I haven&#39;t been actively trying to buy it, I&#39;ve heard of gamers who wanted to get the Japanese game called &quot;Metal Wolf Chaos.&quot; However, the company won&#39;t export it even though the game has the most spectacularly awesome concept ever.</p>

            <p>If you trust me I can get it to you, depending on if I can get it. I would have to get your real life address (off list of course).  Or you could even have amazon send it to my place, and then I would send it to you.<br><br>What are you looking for? (I may be able to get it at a cheaper price than amazon).  Since it isn:t an English book or something like that, it is not easy to get english books in Yamaguchi-ken. *wink*<br><br>Up to you, I would not be offended in the slightest if you don:t want to give me your address at all.<br><br>PS, depending on the weight, international shipping can be very stupid.  Four paper back books form Canada to Japan by mail cost $30 CAD.  If you don:t mind waiting for it (~6 months) I can get cheap shipping.  If not, it does add to the price of the object.<br><br>Leto</p>

Could reach all other addresses, plus I could reach the hotmail address from my yahoo.com address. I told yahoo about this problem; they told me there was a problem with my service provider.

            <p>The short explanation for this poll is: Rilwen called Pads on a grammatical construction that may or may not be standard. Pads and Sedri bickered goodnaturedly over it for a couple of hours. Neither Pads nor Sedri has the neccesary linguistical toolbox to explain a) what was going on in the sentence under contention or b) why one version or another might be standard. Both Pads and Sedri have called on their respective linguistics professors for clarification. To date, only Pads&#39;s professor has replied. His notion is that the grammatical construction in question may or may not be standard, but it seems to have a geographical basis. In the spirit of pure inquiry, we therefore ask you all to answer the following two questions:<br><br>a) where are you from?<br>b) which grammatical construction would you usually use?<br>(i)&quot;he needs his head checking&quot;<br>OR<br>(ii)&quot;he needs his head checked&quot;</p>

            <p>a) Seattle<br>b) it really depends on context - if you&#39;re saying &quot;I think he&#39;s crazy or obsessed about something&quot;, it&#39;s &quot;I think he needs to get his head checked&quot;.

Learned my English from TV (I&#39;m sorry English teachers, but that&#39;s the truth of it), so it&#39;s a mix of British, American, Canadian and Australian.<br>b) second option. First option made me ask: what does his head need to check? I assume that the intend of both sentences was that someone&#39;s head should be examined rather than that the head does some examining.<br><br>Regional difference could be very likely. In Dutch there are several difference between the Netherlands and Belgium in how certain things are said, and even within the Netherlands there are regional differences. For instance in the south someone would say: I brought the book with (litteral translation, so excuse for the incorrect English for a moment). And people from the north always insist the correct sentence is: I brought the book with me. For a southerner the &quot;me&quot; is implied; who else are you going to bring a book with?<br><br>Guess something similar may be the case here: in the first sentence it is implied that heads to check things, so they must be the things getting the checking.</p>

            <p>The &quot;to have&quot; is implicit, not directly stated. The &quot;checked&quot; is past tense. To need to have one&#39;s head checked seems, semantically, to be expressing a desire for one&#39;s head to <i>have been</i> checked. We&#39;re still waiting on word from the linguistics professors on how to break down &quot;he needs it checking&quot;, but, to me and to everyone who took part in my informal straw poll in the pub tonight, the continuous present seems a better verb form to use when referring to an action one wants to come to pass.

            <p>(Warning: I Am Not An English Teacher. take with a grain of salt)<br><br>Would &quot;checked&quot; still seem like past tense if I was to say &quot;he&#39;s having his head checked by Dr. Freedenberg&quot;? Transitive or intransitive, I don&#39;t think &quot;checked&quot; is past tense. It&#39;s being used in the perfective aspect, that of referring to the action as a whole, rather than the past tense. The two of them using the same word is just bad language design.<br><br>To my (American English) mind, anyways, &quot;to have&quot; can&#39;t be made implicit, because it&#39;s the primary verb in the sentence.

            <p>Any insight your professors could give would be smashing.<br><br>Gerund&#39;s a verb acting as a noun, right?<br><br>Past participle of some description sounds about right, I&#39;m just terribly bad at remembering the words for all these things, since I was actually taught them in German. I had a good chat with my dad about it last night, and we&#39;re pretty certain &quot;needs&quot; is acting as a modal verb. So if we were speaking German (except they&#39;d express the idea completely differently), that last verb would take the infinitive, which is very close to the English &quot;needs to be checked&quot; except without the &quot;-ed&quot; on the end. Not sure what form the verb would take in any other languages though.<br><br>The reason I ask about Latin is that, in mine and Sedri&#39;s original conversation, she also commented on me splitting infinitives, and this not being allowed. So she seems, at least to some degree, to have been taught the prescriptive Latinate grammar touted as superior in the 19th century. It&#39;s possible the checked/checking thing results from that same attempt to force a Germanic language into a Latin mould, so looking into Latin modals would be useful.<br><br>Then there&#39;s still this issue of &quot;His head needs checking&quot; versus &quot;He needs his head checking&quot;. We&#39;ve none of us yet been able to come up with any concrete reason why the former would be acceptable while the latter wouldn&#39;t. And my linguistics professor says that one&#39;s still up for debate. Any ideas? Looking at your previous post, and everyone else&#39;s, it seems as though the general consensus is that there&#39;s a head check noun phrase involved, but if that&#39;s the case, it makes no more sense to tack -ed on the end than -ing. If &quot;needs&quot; is being used as a modal verb, it needs another verb after, and that other verb can take various tenses (&quot;I should go&quot;, &quot;I should be going&quot;, or &quot;I should have gone&quot;, for example) depending on meaning. Of course, stating this clearly brings us no closer to deciding the most appropriate tense for that verb. I&#39;m just sure that past is no more (and also perhaps no less) applicable than the continuous present.<br><br>Gah. Tying my brain in knots here.</p>

            <p>You can charge for the misspelling with extra venom, considering that the writer should at least be able to spell their own characters&#39; names, but other than that, not much happens.

            <p>For one, it means that it hides all the text put into the cut, so that you only see that by clicking on the post.<br><br><a href="http://lady-rilwen.livejournal.com/">Take a look in here. Scroll down a bit.</a> The entries with those bolded bracketed links are entries with LJ cuts. If you click on one of those entries, it will open it up, and you can see the full post. Until then, see how much easier it is to find individual posts? It&#39;s far less cluttered that way.<br><br>Also, on livejournal there is a thing called the friends page, where you can see all the posts made recently by your friends. Without an LJ cut, a post like yours is truly huge on the friends page, and requires a lot of scrolling to go past. It&#39;s considered polite to put long posts behind a cut.<br><br>Also, you use LJ cuts if you are saying something or using images that a person may find distressing or are not work safe. Then you use a cut, and warn outside the cut for what is in it.</p>

            <p>You make a good point about the Sue and Stu labels being too widely applied. It doesn&#39;t sound like the Twilight books are ones that I&#39;ll ever really enjoy, though. I much prefer my romance to be secondary to another plot.<br><br>Interestingly enough, I noticed that that other fic by the same author, the Hermione/Eragon one, actually shows vestiges of what would be excellent characterization if it weren&#39;t for the fact that the character in question is Hermione. She sounds exactly like your average American teenager, her parents sound like parents, etc. The dad goes over the top, but that&#39;s not unheard of in real life. It&#39;s like she just took her own experiences and applied Hermione&#39;s name and appearance. Also, she clearly uses a spellchecker. She just doesn&#39;t know which words she actually wants. Very interesting.<br><br>I&#39;m still going to PPC the story at some point, though. The spelling errors are just too funny to pass up.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... er, vampire <i>stories</i>, that is. Really, from a biological perspective I like the idea that sunlight doesn&#39;t burn them, because that&#39;s a REALLY stupid evolutional adaptation to have, and historically I therefore see a need for there to be some other reason why they can&#39;t go out into sunlight, for which some sort of obviously inhuman characteristic makes sense... but SPARKLES?<br><br>Really, we could&#39;ve dumped them in a barrel of glitter. Pfft. <br><br>Pads? I&#39;ve an idea. let&#39;s figure out some better reason for inhuman immortal creatures (and we can just do away with the word &quot;vampire&quot;, if your Transylvanian headdesking is too painful) to have to stay out of sunlight. Some other obvious trait other than SPARKLES. And Trojie can help with the biology. </p>

            <p>The idea that vampires could <i>evolve</i> is definitely right up her alley. (We&#39;re talking about the woman that worked out that, cladistically speaking, unicorns are goats, remember.) I think the sunlight thing&#39;s in there because notions of vampires draw rather more heavily on supernatural methods of thinking than evolutionary and scientific ones. You might as well question the possible evolutionary benefits to having your innards on fire.<br><br>But yes, as soon as Trojie&#39;s back from her convention, let&#39;s sit down and work this one out properly.</p>

            <p>Very few people seem to know the answer to my question, so I thought I’d come to you and see what you thought.<br><br>Where exactly is the line drawn between M and NC-17 (or MA as FF now uses)? Because I have a number of stories planned that I don’t particularly want to get banned for (on this note, do people get a warning first, or are they instantly kicked off?).<br><br>What is the line between M and MA for gore? What is the line for swearing? Most importantly, what is the line between M and MA in regards to sexual content? Is there a line at all, or is it just depending on the context it&#39;s in and the administrator who sees it?</p>

            <p>FFnet doesn&#39;t allow MA rated stuff, but says the rating is for graphic sex and graphic violence. But what is graphic? <br><br>It seems that if you name all the bit parts by their proper names it&#39;s graphic (or too graphic for FFnet). Talking in metaphores and similies would often be okay for M, or even T (though will probably make half the people here want to slap you).<br><br>I once wrote a scene were there was one mention of how blood splattered. I offered it for consideration to an administrator of a fanfic site/forum and suggested an M rating. They said I should scratch the sentence about the blood and tag on an M rating (while the blood sentence was the only reason I thought it should be M). It&#39;s currently on FFnet with the blood line and rated T. Used to be M, but the rest of the story so is not, and I don&#39;t think the one sentence has enough shock effect in it to warrant the M.<br><br>And really do warn for things. There&#39;s another story, in the same fandom as my above mentioned story, where a torture scene takes place. It&#39;s rated T, but I stopped reading when the first joint popped. I asked the author to at least warn for gore if they weren&#39;t going to mark their story as M. The  torture is built up slowly, and that&#39;s just too much drama (for lack of a better word) for a T rated fic.</p>

            <p>Out of interest, how do you deal with people talking about their wedding vegetables? &#39;Cause in dialogue, a lot of the time, medical terms aren&#39;t going to do you many favours in terms of characterisation. <br><br>Trojie and I keep having this problem with her Narnia fics. Latest decision we made on how Caspian X would refer to the crown jewels was based on the realisation that the Telmarines probably originated on the <i>Bounty</i>, and, being nautical types, they&#39;d know some fairly colourful language. So we turned to the Earl of Rochester as an example of contemporary terms the Telmarines, or at least the ones who aren&#39;t posh and kingly, might use. Unfortunately, this is actually fairly sound logic, so we couldn&#39;t throw it out the window after realising just what sort of language this would require us to use.<br><br>Plan number two, therefore, is to go with courtly language instead, as all this requires is asking one of my lecturers &quot;How would King Arthur describe his testicles?&quot;</p>

            <p>I hardly dare speculate. Although I&#39;m going to anyway. &quot;Honeypot&quot; just says &quot;sticky&quot; to me. Admittedly the front bottom does not tend to be <i>sticky</i>, per se. But the application of the gentlemanly parts and their subsequent leakings do make the entire affair somewhat tackier (in the not-quite-sticky sense, not the cheap sense). Also, presumably, men are bees who, er, like to... store memories by making patterns in vaginas?</p>

            <p>When you say leaking, what sort of quantities, velocities etc are we talking here?<br><br>If a man ejaculates inside a woman sans condom, and she then lies down for snuggles or sleep or angstiness or whatever (please, don&#39;t detail the whatevers you&#39;ve found on aff.net for me), she&#39;s going to be feeling a bit... <i>damp</i>, thanks to their combined fluids.<br><br>If she gets up the next day, throws her knickers on, and dashes straight out to work, she&#39;s going to be finding semen in her undies all day.

            <p>Some people are born without an appendix, it seems. But the lack of it provides no decisive advantage.

            <p>Rape is pretty much by its nature an NC-17 issue. <br><br>Dub-con is, yes, dubious consent. And yes, it&#39;s that stuff. Usual use of it is when someone is pressured into going along with things, but never actually says no, and sort-of ends up enjoying. It&#39;s a hazy, rather grey area. I&#39;d generally use it if a participant was not 100% consenting. Some badslashers like to write stories where one character is soooo persuasive that they talk the other into it by their OMG TEH AMAYZING SECKS POWARZ - it starts off non-con and ends up pretty much consenting. That I&#39;d also call dub-con, but not a lot of badslashers actually bother to warn for things like that, so *shrug*.<br><br>As with everything, it&#39;s always best to warn. People might like surprises in their stories, but not these kinds :)</p>

            <p>As well as the locking, which Ansela&#39;s explained, lj also has adult content filters. So say you&#39;d written a graphic and gory non-con fic. You&#39;d mark it with the highest category of filter. Then, if anyone was logged into lj and tried to view your fic, if their stated birthdate makes them under 18, they&#39;ll be denied access. People who aren&#39;t logged in have to click a button confirming their age. It&#39;s not going to stop anyone from reading what you&#39;ve written, but that extra level of attempt, on lj&#39;s part, to make sure underage people go where they&#39;re going willingly and with warnings, covers them slightly more legally (I presume) and means they&#39;re not so fussed about really graphic stuff.<br><br>On the other hand, don&#39;t <i>ever</i> specifically say a character is under 18 in an unlocked post if they&#39;re making with the sexytimes.

I think that Britain&#39;s legal age is sixteen. If I was writing something set around Roman Empire times, surely it&#39;d be acceptable to write about a thirteen year old girl, say, in the first stages of sex. It&#39;d be too uncomfortable for me to go &#39;all the way&#39;, shall we say, but that was what happened in that era. In one country (I can&#39;t remember what) grown men are married to girls before they&#39;re even out of the womb.<br><br>A couple of my scenes involve seventeen year olds, because that&#39;s perfectly legal here. I&#39;ve considered one with two fifteen year olds, but I can&#39;t remember what for and it&#39;s not that far from the legal age, so it&#39;s relatively fine compared to some things I&#39;ve read. *glares at SuicideKing on AFF*</p>

            <p>I know ages of consent vary, but what matters is the legal age in the country that houses the servers that host your fic. And if you&#39;re posting on lj, that&#39;s America. (Or is it Russia now? I lose track). The age of consent <i>on livejournal</i> is therefore 18, even if you&#39;re English and writing about English teenagers having perfectly legal and consensual English sex.<br><br>When all this kerfluffle went on last year (I seem to recall it was some extremely conservative American group causing hassle, or claimed to be; I forget the specifics), the rule being implemented was simply No Sex Involving Minors. In the ensuing purge of livejournals, fanart (and not necessarily realistic art) of possibly-minors was hit, as were some journals and.or communities in which people discussed their experiences of sexual abuse. Suffice to say, it was a tad silly, but the net result is you&#39;re better off not taking the risk.<br><br>Of course, locked posts are another matter, because it&#39;s not like the general public is just going to stumble upon them, be outraged, and report you.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t understand one night stands all that much. I&#39;m a man and I wouldn&#39;t even consider sex with a woman (or man, if I turn out to be gay) unless I had a major emotional connection with them. Sex with a prostitute, for example, just wouldn&#39;t be as mentally satisfying as with my wife for example (I think. Given that I&#39;m a virgin, this is all speculation). Unless, of course, you know, I happened to be dating a prostitute. *shrugs*</p>

            <p>You might change your mind once you start having it. A lot of people just have urges that need fulfilling. Depends on your sex drive, really. And it&#39;s not always about the mentally satisfying, either. One night stands are more about the physically satisfying. For that matter, sex in a committed relationship&#39;s sometimes mostly about the physical satisfying too. It&#39;s, y&#39;know, <i>fun</i>. In theory, anyway.<br><br>Of course, it helps if you&#39;re drunk. One night stands, I mean; if you need to get pissed to shag your wife there&#39;s a bit of a problem.</p>

            <p>Homosexual acts decriminalised in 1967 in England and Wales. Ditto in Scotland in 1980 and Ireland in 1984. Age of consent lowered from 21 to 18 in 1994. From 1997 attempts were made to lower it to 16 so as not to breach the European Convention on Human Rights, but Lords kept blocking it. Finally passed in 2000 despite the resistance of Lords, but was superseded in 2004 by the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which basically removed any gender-specificality from sexual acts, and also incidentally made it legal for two men to engage in homosexual acts while other people were elsewhere in the building.</p>

            <p>I think they could anyway. It was a long time before lesbian acts were even recognised in law.

            <p>A lot of the time Wizarding law doesn&#39;t seem to differ at all from Muggle law. Their age of consent, inasmuch as they have one, is 17 - at 17 they can Apparate... and, er... actually, no. There&#39;s 16 too; at 16 they can leave school. And that&#39;s all we really know. At any rate, all the magical laws we know of are relating to things that don&#39;t crop up in the Muggle world. The only comparison I can see is the school leaving age; you can leave at 16, or stay for NEWTs until you&#39;re 18.<br><br>Anyroad, wizarding society being what it is, can you really see them being <i>less</i> conservative than Muggle society? Especially given, as you mentioned, the whole blood purity thing. Unless, of course, the fanbrats are right, and male wizards&#39; magic will somehow allow them to carry children. If that&#39;s the case, I can see them being more liberal. If not? Purity of blood = important = strict rules pertaining to virginity; and necessity of perpetuating bloodlines = necessity of fecund relationships = predisposition towards viewing heterosexual relationships more favourably.</p>

            <p>When you post to a community on LJ you can choose to leave it as a public post that anyone can see or lock it so that only members of that community can see it. Most communities require this for all explicit fanfiction/art and media downloads. Some communities, such as RPF/S comms are completely locked.

            <p>I realise that it&#39;s going to be a while before I can get Permission. By this point, there are so many PPC spinoffs that it&#39;s impractical to read them all. So which are the important ones to read to understand the current state of the PPC? I&#39;ve read TOS, but things have changed since then. Things like Makes Things dying, which I discovered by accident browsing the wiki. What other major changes have there been since the time of Jay and Acacia? And how much leeway does Permission give you with canon? What sort of changes are permissable to make with the basic Permission?</p>

            <p>But do you know which Department you&#39;ll be wanting your agents to work in? Because if you want to write for the DMS, reading DMS missions is more important than reading DBS ones, for you to get an idea of how things work. And I&#39;m sure hS will jump in with a link to Crashing Down et al soon enough; it&#39;s not stuff that you absolutely need to know, but he&#39;s been writing the history of various major events, and it&#39;s interesting stuff, and generally accepted as fairly canonical since half the Board views him as some sort of minor deity.<br><br>As for changes, so long as stuff&#39;s plausible and doesn&#39;t wildly counteract what anyone else has written, you should be okay.

            <p>That&#39;s all there is to it, really. The fluid nature of PPC canon means the only things you <i>have</i> to acknowledge as solid canon are the events of TOS, though a lot of people have a sort of &quot;everything is canon&quot; mindset. Most of the major events like the Reorganisation, CD, the Mirror Multiverse thing, or some of the Sue invasions happened long enough ago to not really be relevant. You can pretty much do whatever you want as long as it&#39;s not offensive and doesn&#39;t contradict anything specifically set in stone, especially since HQ and the PPC itself are so huge.</p>

            <p>Does anybody know anything about the apparent trend of adding letters after RCs that have the number 32? (32C, 32D) I ask because that&#39;s something along the lines of what I&#39;d like to do.<br><br>However, I don&#39;t want to tread on anyone&#39;s toes if it&#39;s Their Thing or whatever, so I have been advised to check first to see if it&#39;s just a coincidence.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s only two of them (32C and 32D). Could be that they&#39;re for agents created by the same author.<br><br>My agents are in 80s as they mainly work in fandoms that were on TV in the eighties. But I also use an RC that has not yet received a number (I figured it would be easier to find as you wouldn&#39;t know what you were looking for).</p>

            <p>I guess I&#39;m the unofficial editor of the List of RCs.  I don&#39;t know why the trend has started with the number 32, but it&#39;s fine to add letters after a RC number. (The problem arises with adding letters BEFORE the number. Only Jay and Acacia have that.)</p>

The One Electronic is <br><a href="http://headtripcomics.comicgenesis.com/"> Head Trip </a> is fun and has fandomy stuff, and a few priceless strips regarding Twilight.

It&#39;s brief, hilarious, graceful, creepy, macabre, and often thought-provoking. Here is what they wrote in the description for one of their t-shirts:<br>Here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen when you wear this shirt out: A really attractive person is gonna come up to you and say &quot;Oh, A Softer World! I read that too! Man, I wonder what the heck is wrong with that Joey guy, seriously? Who thinks up things like that? Anyway can I buy you a coffee or something -- Oh my God, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t realize you two were together! Faux pas!&quot; And then as the three of you awkwardly laugh off the faux pas the person will slip a small piece of paper in your jacket pocket. When you get home you will notice it and unfold it. On the paper will be the following message:<br>YOU ARE BEING WATCHED</p>

            <p>People seem to have covered most of my favorites, so I&#39;ll just post a few:<br><br>Shortpacked!--set in a retail toy store, the comic mainly focuses on the lives of the cast, but occasionally throws in comics that make fun of various fandoms--primarily the DC comics universe and Transformers, but it includes others. It makes fun of fandoms and fan antics in the way only a veteran greek would know how to do. Screamingly funny, with a spinoff comic posted on Mondays. <a href="http://www.shortpacked.com">www.shortpacked.com</a><br><br>The 10 Doctors--This is actually a fan webcomic, but it&#39;s so awesome I had to include it. It&#39;s a Doctor Who comic wherein all ten regenerations of the Doctor are brought together for unknown reasons and, in typical Doctor fashion, get caught up in all sorts of strange adventures. It captures the spirit of the show perfectly and is a must-read (in my humble opinion) for anyone who&#39;s ever enjoyed the show. comics.shipsinker.com/<br><br>Errant Story--A half-elf mage decides to take over the world for a school project.  On the way, she gets caught up in a rather spectacular adventure. I get the feeling that the authors set out to write a different story than they ended up with, since the beginning is fairly different from the rest of the story, but it&#39;s still a pretty great fantasy webcomic in my opinion.<br><a href="http://www.errantstory.com">www.errantstory.com</a></p>

It&#39;s crude, lewd, and pulls no punches on things like lesbianism, nudity, sex, pimples, boogers, and other things normally not mentioned in polite conversation. Also totally awesome.<br><br><a href="http://lfgcomic.com/">Looking for Group (LFG)</a> - Funnier if you have at least a passing awareness of World of Warcraft.<br><br><a href="http://www.galactanet.com/comic/index.php">Casey and Andy</a> - Ended, so no new comics, but full of mad science and geek humor.<br><br>I think the rest of mine have been mentioned already.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>My favorite webcomics:<br>DMFA (<a href="http://www.missmab.com">www.missmab.com</a>) (Dan and Mab&#39;s Furry Adventures): A truly hilarious webcomic.  The main characters: <br>Daniel Ti&#39;Fiona: A feline Incubus who also is an adventurer.  He kind of is unwilling to come to grips with his ancestry.  Kind of Stuish, but he still is cool.<br>Miss Mab: An extremely purple Fae with a bubbly personality.<br>(I haven&#39;t read this in a while, but it still remains funny).<br><br>VG Cats (<a href="http://www.vgcats.com">www.vgcats.com</a>)<br>A webcomic seemingly devoted to one purpose: Sporking all video game cliches.  Not for those of more delicate sensibilities due to swearing, violence and some sexual content.<br><br>Fine.  You think these are both awful.  Go ahead.  Flame me.</p>

            <p>This seems to be a deadlock.  Mini-Bloodthirsters look more like Mini-Balrogs, but Mini-Nightbringers are an established fact.  I guess it would depend on which has more lulz.  I need a definitive answer, though.  I found a mini-________ in a badfic.  Abbadon.  It has a particular fondness for 80&#39;s music.  And dinosaurs.</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>First up, then:<br><br><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/CardGame.htm">The PPC Card Game</a><br><br>The Third Generation features a rewritten set of rules (designed to increase the role of chance, and decrease the amount of duplicate material), as well as two new types of card, and a new playable fandom: the PPC. It also includes (or, er, will include, at this moment -- I&#39;ll sort and upload it once I&#39;ve written this) a Theme Deck, centered around (what else?) <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/CrashTitle.htm">Crashing Down</a>. This allows you to play as the Agents, the Mary-Sue Factory or the Black Cats in your attempt to take over HQ. It&#39;s great fun. ;) Not that anyone&#39;s ever played it.<br><br>Now, the request. The Fourth Generation is going to be an expansion pack rather than a rewrite, which means I need material. And that means I need your help. There are five types of card you can suggest:<br><br>-<b>Agent</b>: Always the most popular type of card. If you want your Agent or Agents added to the game, you need to give me a few details: The Agent&#39;s name, Department, the Fandom they work in most (yes, only one) and their species are straightforward. The years of their recruitment to the PPC or transfer to this Department, and of their retirement/death/whatever if it&#39;s happened, are less simple, but still do-able. You also need to give them a Lust Object from the fandom named above (and, as mentioned further down, it&#39;d be really nice if you could give me the Canon card for that LO). Again, only one. And you need to list their favourite weapon. I will try to fit this into a broad category, so if you say &quot;orc bow with poison-tipped arrows&quot;, be aware that a) you just ripped off Acacia, and b) it&#39;ll just be a bow.<br><br>Now the complicated bits. First up, I need need <b>need</b> a picture of your Agent. This can be a photograph (always good), or a drawing or doll-maker image if you absolutely must. But I need a picture. If there&#39;s no picture, there&#39;s no card. Simple as that.<br><br>Secondly, your Agent needs to have a Special Ability. You can look at the cards from the last three generations to get an idea, but in general these should be a single sentence which allows the Agent to do something he or she couldn&#39;t by the rules of the game. Most Abilities are boosts to stats. If there&#39;s a problem with your stated Ability, I&#39;ll tweak it.<br><br>Thirdly and most confusingly, the stats. There are six of these:<br><br>-Attack: Determines how strong the Agent&#39;s attack is.<br>-Defence: The same, for defence.<br>-Speed: Usually assigned by species, thus: 1 = troll, elephant, other lumbering creature. 2 = normal human speed. 3 = elf or similar. 4 = something with hooves, paws, or any other fast four-legged type. 5 = winged speed. However, there may be slight shifts, depending on the Agent in question.<br>-Stealth: Helps to ambush their enemies.<br>-Insanity: Higher insanity means that a &#39;Sue who messes with their Lust Object will be easier to kill. Lower insanity means it&#39;ll be harder.<br>-Special: Used to see whether you can use the special ability.<br><br><b>Your Agent&#39;s stats must add up to fifteen</b>. No more, no less. Each stat must be a value of five or less (no negative numbers, in case you were wondering). They can be zero, except for Insanity, which needs to be positive due to the rules. And, remember: the goal here is to represent your Agent accurately, not to make the must unstoppable card you can.<br><br>I really hope the rest of these are shorter.<br><br>-<b>Enemies</b>: New to the Third Generation are Enemies of the PPC. So far, these only include the Black Cats and the Mary-Sue Factory crew. If you can think of any more (including others from either of those -- or maybe the League of MS Factories? I don&#39;t have them), please contribute them. The details I&#39;ll need are much the same as for the Agent (including, again, a <b>picture</b>), with these exceptions:<br><br>-Instead of Department and Fandom, you need to say what Faction they&#39;re with -- Black Cats, Factory, or something I haven&#39;t got yet.<br>-You don&#39;t need to give any years, or a Lust Object.<br>-Two of the Stats are different, specifically:<br>--Stealth is replaced by Observation. This is used to counter Stealth.<br>--Insanity is replaced by Reinforce. The higher this stat is, the greater chance the Enemy has of calling another Enemy to its side to assist.<br><br>Once again, the stats must add up to fifteen, and none can be greater than five.<br><br>-<b>Mary-Sues</b>: The traditional enemy of the PPC, and thus far one of only two types of badfic represented. As with Enemies, these are similar to the Agent, with some exceptions:<br><br>-No Department, Fandom or years. Instead, I need the &#39;Sue&#39;s age, and whether it is male or female.<br>-No Lust Object.<br>-No weapon. Instead, she has an artefact, which has to be one of:<br>--Pendant (restores health)<br>--Tiara (helps against humans)<br>--Jewel (helps at certain locations)<br>--Dagger (helps against anyone using a sword)<br>--Crown (allows her to seduce both male and female Canons)<br>--Ring (helps at certain locations)<br>--Necklace (helps at certain locations)<br>-Two of the stats are different, specifically:<br>--Stealth is replaced by Observation. This is used to counter Stealth.<br>--Insanity is replaced by Allure. This allows the &#39;Sue to seduce Canon characters, which increases the strength of her special ability.<br><br>-<b>Location, Canon, Monster</b>: If you place an Agent in a Fandom, they can&#39;t be used unless there are Locations for them to visit, Canon characters to encounter, and Monsters to defeat. So it&#39;d be nice if you could provide a few.<br><br>--Locations require a picture of the location, along with its name, fandom, and what sort of location it is. In an indoor fandom, this may be different to an outdoor; while the former might distinguish &quot;room&quot; from &quot;chamber&quot;, the latter might just relegate the whole thing to &quot;building&quot;, or even &quot;city&quot;.<br>--Canon characters need their name, gender, fandom, and species. And a picture.<br>--Monsters need a name, fandom and species, along with (yes) a picture, a <b>location</b> they would be found in (which means it&#39;d be nice if you gave me the location card, too), and three stats. In this case, the stats can each go up to <b>six</b>, and are independant -- no limit on the total. The stats are Attack, Defence and Health, each fairly obvious; the only 6-6-6 monster so far is the Balrog.<br><br>I should point out that the five fandoms already in use are: LotR, Harry Potter, &quot;Anime&quot;, &quot;Sci-Fi&quot; (yes, I&#39;ve clumped genres together there) and, now, the PPC itself. LotR is pretty much saturated for Monsters and Locations, but the others are fairly wide open.<br><br>I&#39;m happy to take as many cards as you want to offer. Don&#39;t feel you can only post one Agent -- give me everything you&#39;ve got. :P And then, someday, I&#39;ll find someone to play this with me...<br><br>hS, continuing his mission to waste a lot of time.</p>

            <p>May I use the Cult in an interlude? My idea was for Warren to come across a luckless pair of its cultists carving a scene from Celebrian into a wall. He would then go completely nuts, as that series led to his suffering a mental breakdown before he joined the PPC, and attack them... Thoughts?</p>

            <p>Of course, there is another referencing system, which is where we get World One (ie, the Real World).<br><br>As I recall from (read: I&#39;ve just checked) Tawaki&#39;s mission 29, the long version is the Despatch Continuum Identification Code, presumably usually used internally by Despatch, who need to be precise about these things. The World One etc version seems to be used primarily by the DES. Both of them are apparently gaining more currency (New Caledonia has been described several times as in World One, I think, and obviously Tawaki&#39;s used the long form) but I don&#39;t think either of them are standard.<br><br>My current theory is that the DES are numbering worlds which have doors to HQ (with Earth being World One out of courtesy; presumably Origin was World Zero), while Despatch are trying to be organised about it. Most of the rest of the PPC doesn&#39;t care either way.<br><br>However, as stated, that&#39;s just how I&#39;m mentally rationalising it. It may be right, it may be wrong.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You know? Not all consoles might do it the same way, owing to how odd the PPC is. I&#39;d assume there&#39;d be more than one filing/designation system, and good old temporal uncertainty did the rest, so now they&#39;re in use at the same time. Confusing is PPC HQ&#39;s stock in trade.</p>

            <p>Uh. Hi! I&#39;m Piper. I&#39;m an incurable lurker, a computer geek with a huge soft spot for 1960&#39;s hacker and open-source culture (Jargon file, anyone?), and occasional lover of a truly disgusting number of random fandoms (Teen Titans, OUATIM, Death Note, Merlin, Numb3rs, Digimon, SE Lain, etc. ad nauseum). I&#39;ve been a fan of the PPC for a long time. In any case, since I&#39;ve come to a standstill on my attempts to get my older computer to run Linux, I&#39;ve decided to take some time to hang out here and pretend to myself that I&#39;m actually gonna write a spinoff of my own! So here I am. :)</p>

            <p>Have a Prinny suit. *goes into Copy and Paste Capt. Exposition mode* It increases stats (in an RPG sense), may or may not come with complimentary Prinny bombs and a pair of swords, and makes you say &quot;-dood&quot; at the end of every sentence. It makes people explode when thrown, but that&#39;s... usually... only a problem in NIS videogame canons and similar games. Basically, games where people can be tossed around anytime, by anyone.

            <p>Boy, and I thought David Tennant would go down in history as the Prettyboy Doctor. I figure either the BBC is actively trying to provoke fanlust, or he&#39;s <i>just that good</i>. Let&#39;s hope it&#39;s the latter. On the brighter side of things, the amount of new bad 10/Rose fics will probably go down...probably.<br><br>The hair is a bit silly, though. Maybe we should throw Sylar at him. Sylar is very good at haircuts.<br><br>Have to admit, I was rather hoping for an older Doctor in the style of OldWho, but I&#39;ll reserve judgement until we&#39;ve seen him onscreen. Hey, is it true that a ton of fans threw tantrums when they heard that Christopher Eccleston left, causing the Outpost Gallifrey boards to go down? Is something like that going to happen again?</p>

It was bad enough this past autumn, with no Robin Hood and so no pretty men on the box of a Saturday night. With Ten gone, I&#39;ll be doomed. Or doomed to watch repeats on BBC3 obsessively, at any rate.<br><br>And oh Glod the hair. It&#39;s just so painfully emo.</p>

            <p>I know the feeling. Everyone has their own Doctor, the one they&#39;ll always keep a special spot in their heart for. Mine was Nine, and I still mourn his passing. Such is the nature of the show.  There will always be another Doctor, and there will always be another Companion. Just try to keep an open mind for each new arrival.<br><br>And hey--we still have a little more time left with Tennant. And who knows, maybe Eleven will get a haircut before Series 5 starts (they have, what, a year left?). Hope that cheers you up.<br><br>Also, I highly doubt that the BBC will cut down on the ridiculously gorgeous men in the next few seasons. Just a hunch.</p>

            <p>Mostly because I heard only recently that UK law prohibits illustrations that could constitute dubious pictures of children as well as photos of it, and a couple of webcomics I read could be borderline - nothing graphic, I hasten to add, but if you ever read &quot;Jack&quot; or &quot;Gorgeous Princess Creamy Beamy&quot; you&#39;ll know what I mean. The former has an arc or two focusing on child abuse, and has a couple of pictures of unclothed children, posed in such a manner that you can&#39;t see anything, and they&#39;re nonhuman and covered up by fur or feathers anyway. Nothing is actually happening, though it&#39;s made clear what was about to happen, if you see what I mean, but the abuse is treated as a serious issue and a Bad Thing within the comic&#39;s context. The latter comic has an arc involving underage teens standing around naked but not really doing anything dubious.<br><br>I did not know that such material was potentially iffy when I read the pages in question, and I don&#39;t know when the law passed so it may not have been so at the time. As far as I know, all material in the comics is legal in the US, where it was created.<br><br>I want to know exactly what UK law says about such material so I know what to avoid. I know in practice the likelihood of this causing problems is low, but I want to make certain. If it could be a problem I just won&#39;t look at those particular comic pages again, and if necessary I&#39;ll stop reading the comics in question altogether.<br><br>In other news, I&#39;m considering treatment for paranoia :) Really, I just want to know exactly what&#39;s what and don&#39;t know where to find out.</p>

            <p>I just want to not give anyone any excuse.<br><br>But yeah, far be it from me to protect the rights of people who would actually harm children, but this particular law would be pretty much unenforceable. Technically it would be illegal for me to draw a stick figure with its &quot;hand&quot; level with the groinal area of a much shorter stick figure, not that that would ever reach a conviction (mostly because nobody could tell that was what it was supposed to be, what with the stick-figure limbs all lumped together).

            <p>&#39;Ello everyone! All having good new years so far, right? Anyway, if you&#39;ve been paying attention to the wiki and to my writing in the recent interlude and Christmas party (I know all of three people ever read the stuff I write, but still ;)), you&#39;ll know I&#39;ve started my own team for the AHAIRQL, with Trojie&#39;s permission. Anyway, I need at least four players, and I&#39;ve already got Zodfang (team head) and one of my own agents (Troy) in to sorta help the team get off its feet, but I&#39;m going to need players, and I know there&#39;s bound to be a few people interested in getting in the League. So, I figure we have a &quot;you scratch my back, I scratch yours&quot; deal going on here. If anyone&#39;s interested in getting on the team, post here with the Agent you want on the team (or both if that&#39;s how you swing :P) and I&#39;ll add you to the roster. I need at least two people, but can easily deal with more if that&#39;s the case, though apparently only four players can be in any one game. Hopefully we&#39;ll all have fun with this, heh. Only real thing left that needs to be addressed is one particular idea of mine, namely the fact that I plan on turning practices for the team into a sort of running joke, or at least Zodfang&#39;s attempts at a practice.<br><br> Now, obviously, for these scenes to work when I try to write them I require the permission of the people who control the agents on the team, though a lot of the time they&#39;ll only be mentioned, and probably their cooperation to make certain that the agent(s) in question are kept in character throughout. So, when applying to the team, please state whether you are alright with this or not. I am reasonable, and if for some reason you&#39;re not comfortable with it, I can work around it, but I do need to know these things in advance. Thanks for your time.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d forgotten you&#39;d chosen the name Parjir. I know I read it and frowned once before, but put it out of mind without saying anything. Perhaps my brain was avoiding the problem, since I&#39;ve had a future Agent in the works for quite some time now, named Parjai.

            <p>Well, it would be interesting if the two meet. Ms. Parjir is a Travissite Mandalorian in the style of Kal: an aggressive recruiter about as fanatical as Traviss is in real life. Let&#39;s see how your commando reacts to her aggressive recruiting...<br><br></p>

            <p>*sound of tinkling glass as her mind shatters*<br><br>That... it... just... <i>why??</i><br><br>Apparently this writer has a thing for crossing good fandoms with fandoms that many people despise. I guess I don&#39;t know for sure how people here feel about Twilight, but my guess is that anything in which the canon characters actually sparkle is bound to be frowned upon. My morbid curiosity isn&#39;t even enough to make me try reading the series. {= P<br><br>If nobody wants the HPxEragon one, I&#39;ll put it on my kill list.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Aye, this needs sporking. This exchange is going to give whatever Agent witnesses it a real headache.<br><br>“By the way my name is Eragon.” he told me as he took his seat.<br><br>“Hermione.” I said<br><br>“interesting name”<br><br>“I could say the same to you.”<br><br>“My parents got it from Shakespeare, how about you.”<br><br>Then there was a look in his eyes that seemed to be getting glossed over with hard thought. “I really don’t know, I never knew my parents.”<br><br>“How sad” I said trying to sound worried.<br><br>Now, either one of them says two sentences in a row, which doesn&#39;t seem to work, or a third person joins in unannounced. Trying to read it, it seems the speakers are Eragon-Hermione-Eragon-Hermione- waitaminute, Eragon comes from Shakespeare? Shakespeare doesn&#39;t exist in Alagaesia. Then after that it&#39;s Eragon speaking again.</p>
