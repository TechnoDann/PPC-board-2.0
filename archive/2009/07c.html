            <p>I went to see it with my sister, and while we both thought it wasn&#39;t a &#39;&#39;bad&#39;&#39; film, it really wasn&#39;t that great either.

            <p>I actually really liked it. They managed to concentrate the content of the book into it very well. Also they made the upcoming romance with Ginny a bit more noticeable - you know, more than Harry&#39;s offhand thoughts. I just thought it was odd at the end of the book when he wound up with her after thinking about how pretty she was all of three times and having the same thoughts about other girls.</p>

            <p>I did want the inferi to be more typical zombie-like with rotting bodies instead of the more dessicated look, but it&#39;s marketed as a family/kid movie, so meh.<br>I think this was actually one of my favorite HP movies.

            <p>It amused me, actually.<br><br>I only read the book once, and that was when it came out, so I can&#39;t really remember it.  I spent most of it thinking with all the slash potential in it, why hasn&#39;t the Internet exploded yet?  And the rest of it wanting to mother Malfoy, who is very clearly the best actor out of the kids.  Some of his scenes actually seemed /too/ emotional, because he was along side Potter who was boring as hell.<br><br>There were some shots that were absolutely stunning though, so a thumbs up to the cinematographer, and to the composer, because the music was better too.

            <p>I wondered when this thread would happen.<br><br>The movie got mixed reviews from me and my fiance. I like it very much from an artistic standpoint. The balance between plot and fluff was quite good, I thought, and they did some wonderful things with the camera.<br><br>However, as usual, they did some fairly unforgivable things to the story. I don&#39;t remember personally, since it&#39;s been a long time since I read the book, but my man assures me that the attack on the Burrow did not happen and was a waste of film time that could have been used for other things, like showing more of the collection of Voldemort memories. Also, the rule about no Apparating in or out of Hogwarts applies equally to everyone, including Dumbledore. He was very disappointed that they didn&#39;t include the remnants of Dumbledore&#39;s Army and the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. Also the lack of the Order of the Phoenix doing anything at all. I was personally annoyed that they didn&#39;t give Snape his line at the end. &quot;Don&#39;t call me coward!&quot; Very important character moment.<br><br>On the other hand, I thought the scene at the underground lake was very well done. I cried the first time, especially when Dumbledore got up and torched all the Inferi. It was so awesome and so awful, knowing he was going to die soon. {= (<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I found myself sort of indifferent, actually - possibly because it&#39;s now been so long since either a book or movie came out and I&#39;ve moved my fannish madness to other fandoms.

            <p>You&#39;re not the only one who&#39;s fairly apathetic about it.

            <p>The attack on the Burrow was probably transposed here from Deathly Hallows, as in that book it was heavily dependent on a plot point (Bill and Fleur being engaged) that doesn&#39;t seem to be in the movies.<br><br>That said, I liked it a lot. It was a shorter book, which means more stuff could be left it (though I wonder how they&#39;ll explain the cup) and it definitely looked great. Also, I&#39;m so much of a geek, I could tell which Death Eater was which on the tower, even though they&#39;re only named in the book. Bella continues to amuse, Aragog&#39;s funeral actually was rather sad, and Slughorn was spot-on even without his mustache. The interaction between Harry and Ron was fantastic. Also, I think this director ships Harry/Luna.</p>

            <p>First up, and heaven knows it&#39;s been long enough coming...<br><br><a href="http://www.ppchistory.webs.com/CrashPart11.htm">Crashing Down: Chapter 19 -- The Oak Has Hit The Ground</a><br><br>In which I start the final cast roundup, the SO demonstrates a strain of blinding ignorance, and there are two major revelations which I rather spoiled by revealing them years ago.<br><br>One chapter and one epilogue to go...<br><br>Also! In order to prevent fights breaking out, I&#39;ve started a new website:<br><br><a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/">The Twisted Skein</a><br><br>(Note the Tangled Webs-inspired design. If it works...)<br><br>The Twisted Skein is home to my non-canon PPC works. This includes the various AU stories I&#39;ve written, as well as anything taking place in the future -- ie, later than Crashing Down. I&#39;ve moved The End Of The Beginning over there, along with the AU stuff from Tangled Webs.<br><br>The future stuff is something <i>I</i> will treat as canonical in my writings, but it&#39;s projected, and pretty unlikely to evolve naturally through the PPC community. So it&#39;s not &quot;the future of the PPC&quot; so much as &quot;hS&#39;s future of the PPC&quot;. Please don&#39;t feel any sort of need to take it as authoritative.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t mean to bother you, but I&#39;m just curious about something. Is the mention of the Waterlily Commander a mistake, or was the DMF&amp;F actually larger than Floaters at that time? Also, I apologise for the delay in the things I&#39;m writing up, but it&#39;s been a matter of getting to them (and, in the case of the email, organising everything in a neat manner).

It has friendship, fighting, cool military tech, RPG Club sessions (only one of the main characters is a member), and for the laidies, romance. There are also hints of an action-filled backstory, all but one of which went unanswered. The character art is excellent, done in a very animesque style. While there are a few things that bother me (such as the lack of bacstory), the strips are very easy to read (I managed to get through all of it in one sitting, although then again, I have a lot of time on my hands). Try it! I swear to you that you won&#39;t be dissapointed. <br><br></p>

            <p>I have to agree with Pads here. Not all ladies, or &#39;laidies&#39; like romance, and that genre is not exclusive to women either.<br><br>Plus, unless it is animated it can&#39;t be &#39;animesque&#39;, since anime is short for &#39;animation&#39;. Sorry, but I am nitpicky about this kind of thing.</p>

            <p>Its just that I was trying to hide the fact that I <i>liked</i> the romance by adding the &#39;laidies&#39; part. Also, the ship sinking in the ending was perfect from a literary standpoint (I also said that in the other post), and I tought I&#39;d just look whiny complaining about it. And yes, I forgot that not all complaints about fictional works are from a literary standpoint. </p>

            <p>It could, I suppose, be reminiscent of anime. That might vaguely work. But then, since women can&#39;t like friendship, fighting, cool military tech, or RPG Club sessions, then maybe not.</p>

            <p>But Hitsugaya and Kenpachi are my favourite captains, so I&#39;m easily swayed by the change to fangirl.  And while Kenpachi wasn&#39;t actually in that episode, if he doesn&#39;t become important in this plot line the writers need to be slapped and asked what the hell they were thinking.<br><br>Thanks for bringing that up though.  I don&#39;t watch Bleach any more because I got bored of it being so repetitive (perhaps if it wasn&#39;t a series where no one ever dies it might be more exciting; I read it instead so it takes up less time and leaves me more time to watch more interesting shows), but I&#39;ll watch these fillers.</p>

            <p>What a bizarre request.<br><br>I&#39;ll throw in my two pence. ... or I would if I could think of the one I just thought of and then forgot.<br><br>Let&#39;s chuck out random words in the hopes that I&#39;ll remember it: Sushi, Nausea, Penguin, Hippopotamus (*going on animals now*), Aardvark, Scarab, Liplurodon (an awful approxamation of a sea-dwelling dino that I can&#39;t spell right now).<br><br>While I can&#39;t remember what the name I wanted was, I vote for Aardvark now.

It also has Aardvark-horse-dinosaurs on another world.<br><br>On a somewhat related subject, if you have a friend called Faye who is a Star Trek fan, <i>Private Eye&#39;s</i> Psuedo-Names section gave her a wonderful name if she ever wants to changes.

            <p>So, I was looking through the PPC wiki when I noticed something weird on Makes-Things&#39; profile page: It says he was born in 1954. TOS was first published in 2001. In his first appearance in TOS, as well as non-TOS missions I&#39;ve seen, he has been described as a &#39;young man&#39;. If he was born in &#39;54, He would have been in his late forties to early fifties in these missions, and that&#39;s not exactly young. Am I missing something here?</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been scrounging around for some truly awful notable fic, which could probably be considered for Legendary status. All of it is both squickful and, more importantly, well-known, so I thought some of these would be worthy of discussion as to whether or not to induct them into the - ahem - lofty aforementioned ranks. All links go to MSTs when available to keep brains intact.<br><br>So, without further ado...<br><br>Hogwarts Exposed: Harry Potter. Don&#39;t know much about it, except that it&#39;s a series, that it involves pedophilic voyeurism, and that HMS_STFU ranks it in the same class as Rose Potter and Subjugation.<br><br>Chocobo Nights: Final Fantasy VII. Tifa spends the night at a Chocobo ranch and discovers that humans and Chocobos are genetically compatible. These two facts are, unfortunately, related. TVTropes ranks it as &quot;So Bad It&#39;s Horrible.&quot;<br><a href="http://web.pitas.com/ficbitches/chocobonights.html"><a href="http://web.pitas.com/ficbitches/chocobonights.html">http://web.pitas.com/ficbitches/chocobonights.html</a></a><br><br>Obsession: Evangelion.

            <p>But the thing about Legendary Badfics is that they need to be fairly &#39;legendary&#39;.

            <p>These are already notable enough to have caused flamewars and to attract the attention of TVTropes. Basically, they&#39;re already famous, but since the PPC is so community-oriented, I thought I&#39;d run them by The Board before calling Legendary on my own.</p>

            <p>Ah, hello there. *bows*  I am hereby requesting permission to write PPC missions.  I have been here for one month exactly, and I&#39;m too eager to wait! &gt;w<br>If accepted, my partner would be Rose/Ross, Department of Floaters, RC Sp’nьff(24).  (We&#39;ve been plotting together. 8D)<br><br>Short Bio: Meip is fresh out of the barracks newbie, newly assigned to the Department of Floaters with her new partner, Rose/Ross.  She is, in all essence, an author insert.  In fact -if you could ever mange to get her to talk about it- she’s quite proud of being one.<br><br>She is a rather short girl with a mass of brown curls and brown eyes partially hidden behind a pair of silver framed glasses.<br><br>Meip is very much the quiet one in a group.  She is very shy and hates physical confrontations, this has made some people wonder how she could have ever gotten into the PPC.  If asked she would inform you that she believes that correcting badfic is one of the things she’s willing to fight about. Unless you ask Meip a direct question that requires more than a yes or no answer, she will make small noises as answers, questions, statements, and ums.  Frequently used noises are; Meep, gnarf, mwah and small growls.<br><br>Meip calls Earth her home planet – most of the time – and has lived in the same spot all of her life, in the middle of nowhere surrounded by pine trees.  Her family believes that she is currently off at college.<br><br>Meip’s weapons are a 357. Magnum pistol, a rather amazing variety of hardback books, and a horde of angry cats whom followed her from Earth.  She also has the ability to accurately shoot a 22. rifle, various beebee guns and a bow.  Meip is also the very proud owner of a Bag, in which she keeps a multitude of things, including a couple of cats on occasion.<br><br>Full Agent Biography:<br><a href="http://miss-meip.livejournal.com/587.html"><a href="http://miss-meip.livejournal.com/587.html">http://miss-meip.livejournal.com/587.html</a></a><br><br>Writing Sample:<br><a href="http://miss-meip.livejournal.com/793.html"><a href="http://miss-meip.livejournal.com/793.html">http://miss-meip.livejournal.com/793.html</a></a><br><br>And the first Badfic I&#39;d like to tackle with Rosie is &#39;A Squire&#39;s Pain: <br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2413177/1/A_Squires_Pain"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2413177/1/A_Squires_Pain">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2413177/1/A_Squires_Pain</a></a></p>

            <p>It is granted. {= )<br><br>To add to Pads&#39; advice about punctuation, I advise you to choose your adjectives a little more carefully. Take the following:<br><br>1) a veritable mass of brown curls<br><br>2) a massive cat lover<br><br>&quot;Veritable&quot; is one of those words, like &quot;literally,&quot; that have been wrongly co-opted as expressions of emphasis. If you want to say that Meip has big hair, &quot;mass&quot; by itself serves the purpose. If you need to emphasize the mass, choose a word that truly describes it, like &quot;springy&quot; or something.<br><br>As for the second phrase, the word &quot;massive&quot; there makes it sound either like Meip is very overweight or like she loves massive cats. (Clearing up that ambiguity is how a hyphen would come in handy.) I suspect you&#39;re embellishing on the cliche &quot;big cat-lover.&quot; The trouble is that that phrase, though in common usage, isn&#39;t correct. The cliche slides under the radar because it is everywhere. When you change it, though, you draw attention to it and the incorrectness of the phrase jumps out. You could say that Meip is a devout cat-lover, an obsessive cat-lover, an unrepentant cat-lover.... There are many possibilities in which the description is correct.<br><br>I hope that all makes sense. Let me know if I can clarify anything for you. Meanwhile, welcome to the PPC. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>You ought to be aware, Sedri. After all round one of said Hyphen Debacle was arguing with you. If memory serves, it was the correct placing of the hyphens when interrupting directly reported speech for a spot of action, then returning to the speech. In Meip&#39;s case, I plan to point out that when we use hyphens as a means of sneaking another clause into the middle of a sentence - like this - we have spaces either side.</p>

            <p>Hi. I have internet again. {= )<br><br>Also, the set of rules mainly used on this side of the Big Pond tell me that hyphens really shouldn&#39;t be used to separate clauses at all.

            <p>I asked my dad about this one in pub tonight - he&#39;s generally handy, as not only is he a Dad and thus a Fount of all Knowledge, but he also picked up a degree in Linguistics in the late seventies - and his feeling, which matches mine, is that, in UK publishing, the m-dash went out in the seventies. Probably typewriters are to blame, and computers as a continuation of that, since only Word does m-dashes these days. Anyroad, wherever it&#39;s printed, be it book, newspaper, pamphlet, whatever, these days, in the UK, it&#39;s simply a normal hyphen with spaces either side; the m-dash is dead. Certainly that fits my vague idea, gleaned simply from reading books, that the m-dash is archaic.<br><br>I will, however, keep an eye out. Already spotted Haruki Murakami&#39;s &quot;Wind-up Bird Chronicle&quot; goes with my style of hyphen, but I don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s Japanese translated or written simply in English for the UK market.<br><br>Most papers hold themselves to lower standards. The Grauniad, by way of being the Grauniad, likes to hold itself to interestingly different standards. One still is covered in ink after reading it, mind.</p>

            <p>Agreed, but as m-dashes are hard to get when typing, and double hyphens are often split when at the end of the line, I&#39;m happy with hyphens instead.

            <p>Generally I think it&#39;s just a matter of aesthetics. Split hyphens, however, annoy the hell out of me, because you end up doing a double-take to figure out what was actually meant. :(<br><br>(Of course, when text displays put a hyphen showing an interruption - like yours, Pads - on the next line anyway without acknowledging it as attached to the word, the whole thing ends up pointless and leaves me grumbling at the text displays themselves.)</p>

            <p>was that the Borg grow babies in an incubation chamber (First appirences in TNG).  Which is refuted in later episodes.  I think in Voyager they say that the Borg do not have children.  If they assimilate children, they are put into a maturation chamber to accellerate growth to adulthood (the Borg children).<br><br>I myself think that it would be impossible for the Borg to have children because the flesh of the borg is esentially dead, not the grey palor.<br><br>That is my reasonings.

            <p>Unless I&#39;ve missed a lot. Their flesh is grey because their bloodstreams are filled with nanoprobes - machines made of grey metal. Once Seven of Nine had the bulk of them drained from her system, her flesh turned a healthy pink. <br><br>That said, I&#39;d forgotten about the maturation chambers. Generally I take the &#39;facts&#39; of the later <i>Trek</i> episodes over the early ones - in TNG they seemed to be very much feeling it out, and things solidified later (later in TNG, and in Voyager). After all, the Ferengi were originally supposed to be dangerous villians. They became a laugh.<br><br>:)</p>

            <p>Very true, but then one has to wonder why they bother hanging on to children and assimilating them. Be easier (and more sensible, in terms of maintaining populations to assimilate) to leave the kids and just take the adults. Presumably they&#39;re interested in making up the numbers of drones, and I&#39;d guess they could probably just as easily grow a foetus as grow a toddler up to a suitable age.</p>

            <p>...I think not. If there are in-built safeguards to prevent drones from getting too emotional, I imagine there would be safeguards against biological &quot;infestations&quot;. And there is, you know, the armour that keeps anything biological from going in or out.<br><br>If possible, it would be a way to increase their numbers, but they just don&#39;t seem to need that, since infants don&#39;t provide much new data to assimilate. <br><br>That said... there is nothing in canon to say definitely not, but I think it unlikely.</p>

            <p>My way of thinking is: the Borg assimilate a body, and improve that body in whatever way they can. Would a Borg within the Collective be improved by having working reproductive organs, or by having them shut down somehow? Given said organs aren&#39;t going to be used at all, thanks to the Borg assimilating rather than breeding asexually, any resources used by the body for the maintenance of the reproductive organs are resources wasted. Assuming the Borg are advanced enough to be able to supply their drones with some sort of implant or upgrade that will regulate their hormones and suchlike, I suspect a lot of the reproductive organs would be removed or otherwise shut down.</p>

            <p>Because I’m a total wacko, I ignored writing one of my many, many in progress fics to start a new one, a possible short series of short stories. I’m asking for a beta. It’s a <i>Star Wars</i> story, but it’s set just before <i>The Old Republic</i>, BioWare’s upcoming MMO. While I usually want to write something for unreleased games or films, never before have I just sat down and <i>wrote</i> without anything backing me up but a vague timeline, a single piece of concept art (albeit sodding awesome) and a trailer (that, obviously, does <i>Attack of the Clones</i> better than <i>Attack of the Clones</i> did). Regardless, I came up with a prologue to my story and I’m looking for someone to tell me how to improve it (and probably come up with a better title).<br><br>As next to nothing is known about <i>The Old Republic</i>, any <i>Star Wars</i> beta reader should be fine, but a vague knowledge of <i>Knights of the Old Republic</i> might be helpful (though unlikely). All you really need to know is that the Sith just came back and just totally pwned Coruscant and the Jedi Order. Thanks in advance,<br>Jade</p>

            <p>Yes, I&#39;ve seen some other similar ones as well - from recollection, it was Sweeney Todd, with a list at the top of which characters were playing which parts (can&#39;t remember what the other canon was at the moment), and then just a copy-and-paste of the words. I cannot work out why people even bother writing this sort of thing - it just seems like an utter waste of time, to me.</p>

            <p>Yep, complete and utter theft, word-for-word - makes you wonder why she even bothered.<br><br>I&#39;m a big fan of the series (though each to their own, of course :) ), and I definitely know it well enough to PPC it, aside from the little matter of producing a writing sample and requesting Permission, which I have yet to get round to. What&#39;s the procedure in cases of outright plagarism, though? Since there&#39;s not really enough of a story (at least, an original one) to PPC. Most of it belongs to either Stephenie Meyer or John Marsden; though I suppose you could snark at the awkward way that the two stories have been jammed together.<br><br>(No, the scene with the car slipping on ice just does not <i>work</i> in Wirrawee in the middle of summer, no matter how well it suits Forks in wintertime).</p>

            <p>That plagerism is less of a worry than the fact that she&#39;s so awkwardly forced the two worlds together. What you need is an Untangler - plagerism itself is just a (particularly important) charge.</p>

            <p>Things poor Ross gets particularly bitchy about: <br>1) Stereotypical portrayals of DID/MPD (Guess why)<br>2) &quot;Male twin of the pair&quot; Stus (I think he&#39;s afraid that he himself is, in fact, one of them, but just doesn&#39;t realize it. His sister laughs at this...)<br>3) Inaccurate representation of a character&#39;s ethnicity. <br>4) Falsifying Twinning relationships. <br>5) Falsifying Twinning likelihood. (Seriously. Twinning is rare unless there is twinning in the family, and then it skips a generation. So one of a set of twins is likely not to have twins unless her husband&#39;s parent was a twin...)<br>6) Trivializing Twinning relationships. <br>To name his top six... <br><br>And this fic had... 2, 3, 4, and 6. <br><br>... I like having the &quot;Sane, controlled&quot; one go off his rocker every now and then. There are two types of Ross Anger you have to deal with. The yelling, stomping, facewalling kind is easy to get him to calm down from. It&#39;s the slow, cold, deliberate stuff that gets out of control. As can be seen by... well, WRITING a Stu to death. </p>

            <p>Seriously, that&#39;s twice now I&#39;ve seen misquotes of it. That&#39;s a pretty impressive number, considering that it&#39;s in the front of every book in the most likely edition a fan writer would have access to, two other editions, and I highly suspect every edition ever. Furthermore, it appears in the fellowship of the ring.<br><br>Lastly, it&#39;s in poetry, the original purpose of which was to be easy to remember.<br><br>This may be a personal thing, but the forgetting of a space ticks me off because I pronounce dark lord and darklord a bit differently, and one doesn&#39;t seem to fit the pattern.</p>

            <p>She&#39;s got purple eyes and red hair, and she&#39;s chosen by the Goddess. Other than that?<br><br>Well, she has Knightly Skillz, yes, but remember how she worked her arse off in training, because girls are naturally weaker? It&#39;s not Sueish to have muscles after a hell-camp like that, it&#39;s realistic. Actually, it would be more Sueish to have her still be weak, or complaining about not being as strong as the guys. <br><br>She was chosen by the Goddess, I think, because she was the first woman knight in centuries. (I&#39;m <i>sure</i> Tammy mentioned somewhere that there were lady knights, long ago in the past.) <br><br>Anyway, if you want to find a Canon Sue in that series, I&#39;d point to Daine, love her though I do. She&#39;s a girl with a tragic past, (bastard-like birth [redeemed of course] AND orphaned by bandits, AND traumatized by her powerz, and awesome beyond-the-ken-of-man powers that she can&#39;t quite control, AND of course immediately liked by [almost] everyone (given this is Tortall, where generally the cast is pretty friendly), AND gets the Older Wiser Court Wizard to fall in love with her, AND has Brand New Speshul Magicks.) Canon Sue, much more strongly than any other character, I think. Everything always comes easily to her, with just the right amount of angst. But, as I said, I do love her, because <i>Wild Magic</i> was my first Tammy book. And because, what can I say? AMINALSSS.</p>

            <p><i>Wild Magic</i> was mine too. And I love the Twilight comparison. :D For me, though, it was Skysong that made me squee. I&#39;d take lovable dragon kit to talking over animals any day. It may explain why I want to copy the idea in any similar fantasy I write. *hugs Skysong* Someone needs to make a Skysong plushy. I&#39;d totally buy that. :P<br><br>And yes, Alanna came along a century after the last female knight had died. Fortunately, Keladry came along in less time. :P<br><br>As for the training, exactly. I&#39;m using that as help for part of the draft for one of my fics, training Heroes. A Hero in the fandom is basically a knight/samurai/Jedi (including a magical power known as Force Push :D). It&#39;s difficult to know what pushes them over the boundraries of Sue in the training and what would actually happen had these guys existed.</p>

            <p>In most Universal Litmus Tests, the pre-test instructions are not to panic if you get a really high score (at least, the ones I&#39;ve seen, or the ones aimed at authors, not agents. Plus, that might be the fanfic bit you&#39;re using; Canon characters are different.), because in all honesty, if it&#39;s written correctly? Characters with higher scores can be interesting, thought-out, very human characters. It&#39;s all about personality, context, flaws. Alanna has all of these, and I think Tammy pulls it off perfectly, leaving you wondering at the end (if you&#39;ve had experience with Suefics beforehand) how on -Earth- she just wrote a purple-eyed, red-haired, Goddess-chosen, magic-wielding Knight and somehow made her human, real, and completely drew you into the story, too. (I think one of my favorite things was how she turned down Queenship for George. Not Sueish. Sues would downright <i>seduce</i> Jon for that chance.)</p>

            <p>Tamora Pierce does pull it off pretty well at the end of the book series, but during the first few books she does seem a little over the top, even though it&#39;s pulled off and balanced. Also, Tammy is a much better writer than most of the fanbrats we have to deal with. Yeah, the score was really high, but I have to agree with you. I&#39;m certainly not going to panic over it, but I may poke fun at it in a parody or two.</p>

            <p>Not really sure what fandom to patrol, I&#39;m a casual fan of a number. Might go for wheel of time, but starwars, starcraft, and warcraft before WoW are also likely options. If I ever get around to getting the Sword of the Stars books, I might also do that one.</p>

            <p>So, this requires some explanation. We&#39;ve all seen fics where the Sue pops in, tells the male character she can tell he&#39;s gay even though he didn&#39;t know himself, and convinces him it&#39;s all okay to go bang his friend. I&#39;ve found one of these, but with a difference. The Sue in this case claims to be the &quot;soul&quot; of one of the main male characters. Since he manages to hold conversations with her, this kinda defeats the purpose of what a soul is unless you&#39;re writing fic for Philip Pullman&#39;s works (this fic is not), and basically she&#39;s the result of the author&#39;s brain working on painfully heteronormative lines because the claim in the fic is that since he has a girl soul that makes him gay and it all just gets hideously confusing.<br><br>Question is, should we kill her, or just exorcise her? Personally I think she&#39;s a Sue impersonating the character because souls do not work that way in this fandom, and therefore she needs killing, but I thought I should ask.<br><br>Oh, and I found a new drink for the Agents to get hooked on: <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/41/unicorn-chaser.html"><a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/41/unicorn-chaser.html">http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/41/unicorn-chaser.html</a></a></p>

            <p>That said... hm, interesting. Simplest option would be to just charge her with lying and being all too full of herself, I guess. See, I think it depends on how you define a &quot;soul&quot; - I would say that we all <i>are</i> souls, and we <i>have</i> bodies; therefore, there&#39;s no way someone could talk to their soul without they themselves being an inert or robotic empty body. But people disagree, and as you said, in different Word Worlds.<br><br>If you want to play it safe, I&#39;d say exorcise her and neuralyse all her memories so she ends up being basically a blank slate, and then either release her into a continumn where she can&#39;t do much harm or recruit her. On the other hand, if she makes you angry enough and you&#39;re willing to risk upsetting the Flowers, kill her, but exorcise her first just in case you accidentally damage the canon character. </p>

            <p>I think souls in the continuum I&#39;m talking about work the way you describe, though it doesn&#39;t come up much, and she behaves nothing like the guy in question. Previous PPC installments have established that canon characters can&#39;t die until the original creator says they have (see DAVD and The Cluny Fic - poor Thranduil and Redtooth) so killing her probably wouldn&#39;t irrevocably harm the guy she&#39;s supposed to be connected to. We should probably neuralyse him first, though, just to &quot;break the connection&quot; as it were.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s properly spelled &quot;Carue&quot;, I think, but Karoo is an alternate way it&#39;s been seen.

And since the fic focuses mostly on the Stu and the five core Strawhats (and Chopper), I&#39;d say you have sufficient knowledge. It mentions Robin, Franky, and Brook, but they&#39;re pretty much cameo appearances.</p>
