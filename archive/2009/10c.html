            <p>It was... satisfactory.  For a night of simple amusements.<br><br>But, coming away from it, I had an awful lot of quibbles and AU suggestions and Ideas.<br><br>First, i honestly thought Toby was an android from the beginning (until the actual scene, of course) and I thought it would have been better if the &quot;accident&quot; had just required a memory-core retrieval into a replacement body, followed by a scolding and a possible grounding.<br><br>However, the disconnect between Human memories and Human chauvinism against robots was an interesting point.<br><br>From there.. i should have suspected that Cora was a Metro from the cut of her clothes, though early on I kinda remarked to my guest that I figured that her parents were somewhere farming taro and pigs.  And where does food come from?  Minerals for additional robots?  If there was such a disconnect with the surface... well, the inconsistancies are getting to me.<br><br>Probably can&#39;t expect more from an IP derived from an early-50&#39;s Manga, but anyone else see it?<br><br>What do you think?</p>

The other one an alien, with a curved back, white skin, and bedecked in black armor.  They simply stare blankly at the other party-goers before wandering over to a corner to chat.  The human begins doing complicated tricks with a knife, the blade whirling around and around his hand in a blur.  The Sangheili is making motions with his hands; the two seem to be talking about combat of some sort, probably hand-to-hand.</p>

Foxglove had untied her braids for the first time in living memory and redone her hair into dreadlocks, while Laburnum&#39;s had been rinsed red and teased into a huge floppy forelock.<br><br>Laburnum tugged at her Steely Dan T-shirt and resumed her argument with Foxglove. &quot;I STILL don&#39;t see why you cast me as the short guy with all your costume suggestions ...&quot;</p>

            <p>Laburnum pulled out a Bleepette. &quot;See, these two teenage boys, Arcturus - that&#39;s me - and Hunter - that&#39;s Fox - get really sick of how stupid their peers are, so they set up a business where people pay them to assist with elaborate suicides.

            <p>Skyfire appeared, looking pointedly at Kestrel. The stoat was clad similarly to Stormsong, in a long coat and little round sunglasses, the main difference being that her coat was yellow. &quot;Hi. I didn&#39;t think a Halloween party was a good place for a baby, so I got Tagg to look after Moses - they didn&#39;t kill each other the last time, so I suppose it&#39;s safe, and Tagg did say he wanted to spend more time with what&#39;s technically his cub.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yay!

            <p>&quot;Given that about half the canon vermin sorta sound that way anyways.

Remember I told you when I was a student they broke into the dorm and filled my shoes with slugs because I was young and dumb enough to actually tell them?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Pervy vermin fancier.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yerss, yerss indeedy.&quot;<br><br>Skyfire ignored them. &quot;And do you perchance know what happened to him?&quot; she continued quietly, trying to cover Molly&#39;s ears at the same time. &quot;You know, with the elaborate and horribly painful death thing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Stoppit, Mama, I know,&quot; said Molly, pushing away Skyfire&#39;s paws. &quot;I over&#39;eard somebeast talkin&#39; &#39;bout it ... well, I dunno wot really &#39;appened but it was summat to do wi&#39; that word I&#39;m not allowed to say that Aunty Laburnum yells at the console when it don&#39;t work. Wot is it agin? Oh yeah, &#39;f&#39;-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Molly, you use that word and you&#39;re off live prey for a week!&quot; Skyfire snapped. Molly sagged and grumbled to herself.<br><br>Meanwhile, Stormsong was explaining to Deuce. &quot;Well, the OFUR library hath a few different versions of &#39;Wind in the Willows&#39; - charming tale, almost no deaths at all for a change - and Laburnum and Foxglove insisted on showing us the one with the cast of ... something called &#39;Monty Python&#39;, though I saw no snakes in it. Then they insisted we wear costume for this party, and I insisted on something slightly more subtle than their chosen garb.&quot; He gestured to Laburnum and Foxglove, who were now removing the bullets from Foxglove&#39;s handguns so she could resume the Happy Gun Dance. &quot;So we dressed as the weasels. Cheating, aye, I know.&quot;</p>

(Really? Because generally people harp on Bono being short. I&#39;ve never heard that Larry was actually shorter. <s>And anyway, when they&#39;re onstage the personality is so immense that you honestly can&#39;t tell. Well, you can. But it is so eclipsed by the awesome. And the platform boots just make everything cooler.)<br><br>In all seriousness, seconded! There are not a whole lot of people who will admit to being hardcore U2 fans out there.

I love the relationship between (well, the whole band, but especially) Edge and Bono.

            <p>&#39;m completely crazy, too. Why would I be here if I weren&#39;t?<br>Bono is 1.72m, Larry 1.70. Edge and Adam are 1.79.<br>Totally seconding about Bono and Edge, and Edge&#39;s Vulcanness. Spock is a musician, too. That means something. Edge also has other Vulcan characteristics:<br>- He can spend several days and nights in a row WORKING. He himself said he had to stop watching TV after a week, day and night, after 9/11. OK that&#39;s not working but still. A WHOLE WEEK.<br>- He&#39;s basically a science geek.<br>- He doesn&#39;t show so many emotions (but still a few). Bono called him &#39;zen monk&#39; more than once.<br>- He LOOKS Vulcan. Except the ears.<br>I could find even more.<br><br>BTW, feel free to plug One, Vertigo and others. I plug them too, everywhere.</p>

            <p>Yeah, Edge is pretty amazing. Have you ever seen the video where Bono wakes him up first thing in the morning to follow him around with a video camera for a few hours? It&#39;s hilarious, and awesome. &quot;And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the sound of The Edge blowing his nose.&quot;<br><br>The way he&#39;s always so stoic makes it just that much more moving when he really gets into something, too.<br><br>(I meant One the organization, not the song; I generally only plug songs on existing threads, not starting new ones.)</p>

            <p>&quot;You said eleven. It&#39;s ...in&#39; half eight!&quot;<br><br>Very awesome. I think one of my favorite things about the band is their sense of humor (even Larry, dour as he comes off sometimes).

            <p>In the Real World? Nope, it&#39;s extremely unlikely. See Darwin&#39;s <i>Origin of Species</i> for a much more in-depth discussion of why hybrid animals tend to be sterile.<br><br>In a sci-fi canon, however, it depends. If we&#39;re talking, say, Star Trek, then hybrids are possible even when it makes my brain hurt (eg Vulcan copper-based blood not causing any problems with Human blood). If it&#39;s a sci-fi continuum with no hybrids, then it&#39;d be a no. I&#39;m trying to think if there are any hybrids in Doctor Who canon, and drawing a blank.<br><br>Mind you, I suppose there was that woman and that cat in Gridlock.

The blurb for it describes the main character, Sakura Tenshi, as &quot;A &quot;Wish/Chobits flavored&quot; Gratuitous Japanese speaking amnesiac &quot;alluring little kitten goddess yet innocent&quot; angel tenshi-chi with love powers strong enough to destroy Heaven, Hell, and everything in between... in Cowboy Bebop.&quot;<br><br>From what I&#39;ve read, the setting and characters of Cowboy Bebop have changed to match the sugary... shoujoness of the main sue and the motley crew of freeloaders (including a dark-sided version of herself) she brings to The Bebop.  It also has the most annoying Fangirl Japanese that I have ever seen.  The Gratuitous Japanese page mentions such gems like:<br><br>-&quot;Naze are we teishing?&quot;<br>-He looked yuki white with dark ruby and kuro eyes. <br>-Hentai thoughts ran through Jet’s head.<br><br>This is another long one.  The first story is 88 chapters long.  The author has a web page for the series.  But I can&#39;t make heads or tails of anything on it due to the shitty site design.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/799650/1/DragonBall_V"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/799650/1/DragonBall_V">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/799650/1/DragonBall_V</a></a><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1469636/1/DRAGONBALL_V_SEASON_TWO"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1469636/1/DRAGONBALL_V_SEASON_TWO">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1469636/1/DRAGONBALL_V_SEASON_TWO</a></a><br><br>The blurb for this on the God Mode Sue page reads:<br><br>&quot;Meet Valis. A female Saiyan survivor. Destined wife of Piccolo. Destined mate of Vegeta. Embodiment of an ancient warrior prophecy, with Inner Senshi-style &quot;warrior women&quot; assistants. More powerful than Goku. Bigger clothes-horse than Cher. Destined Universal Queen.&quot;<br><br>She&#39;s also Goku&#39;s long lost sister and, like the blurb says, has a shitload of clothing and hair/eye color changes.  (Why?  From going Super Saiyan, of course.)<br><br>What do you think, sirs?  </p>

            <p>Grrr. *slitty eyes* Keep your messed-up hands off my religion, bub. If I were writing missions... I would tackle that one, ten billion chapters and all. Religious fury aside, wouldn&#39;t it be great fun to have an excuse to bluescreen somebody&#39;s universe? It&#39;s not like it&#39;s a canon universe, nobody cares if you nuke it, right? :D :D :D<br><br>OTOH, I&#39;m only really familiar with one of those series, and that&#39;s Rurouni Kenshin. But then, lack of familiarity with a series never stopped me from reading fanfic before... ;)</p>

            <p>Also, all of the main universes have massive infodumps that go on about their storylines in the first &quot;book&quot;, if I remember correctly.  And a lot of the canon characters used are just the character in physical description only.  A lot of them have had their names and personalities completely changed.  </p>

            <p>Anything that reminds one of that travesty of a &quot;romance&quot; series SHOULD be nuked. Just to save us all having post-traumatic flashbacks. -_-;<br><br>FWIW, neither polygamy nor combining parents&#39; names is really a Mormon thing.

            <p>I doubt it, though, because ALL the guy&#39;s work is like this. Not all with the kittens, but the misogyny and OOCness is in everything he writes. Setting up the persona would take way too much effort for a troll.<br><br>This is a lot worse than TS. At least the characters in that were furries to begin with.</p>

            <p>Forgive the emoticon, but that&#39;s all I can say. I dunno, though. There&#39;s plenty of people who think that Ebony/Enoby Dark&#39;Ness Dementia Raven/Tara Way isn&#39;t a troll. I think she is, but...<br>-M&#39;n&#39;M, confuzzled</p>

            <p>Nobody could ACCIDENTALLY render &quot;Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge&quot; as &quot;Mystery of Magic Cornelia F**k&quot;.<br><br>But something about the kitten guy makes me think he&#39;s for real. There&#39;s something so creepily earnest about him ... Don&#39;t get me wrong, I firmly believe that what somebody writes does not necessarily bear any resemblance to what they may think in reality. (Though after some thought I think I will edit the warning on my &quot;Mossflower Science Theatre&quot; page to reflect that Chaser Wolf pointed out that in the book Matthias&#39; age isn&#39;t given, so we can imagine it&#39;s an AU where the poor kid&#39;s eighteen. I don&#39;t know if that was CW&#39;s intent, but I&#39;m going to pretend it is. Given that the characters are clearly fictional it&#39;s unlikely to get me into any trouble if I don&#39;t, but just in case I ever go to Canada or something :) ... Didn&#39;t occur to me there&#39;d be a problem when I first put it up because it&#39;s clearly fictional and I didn&#39;t write the icky bits myself, and if it was going to be a problem someone would have told me long ago, but now I think I&#39;d be more comfortable if I redid it like that. Won&#39;t change the actual MSTing though. Excuse long tangent.) But this guy ... to quote someone on LJ, the inside of his head has to be one ugly place.</p>

            <p>I think my brain just died.  I don&#39;t know much about Naruto now because I haven&#39;t read it in a few years, but I&#39;m seriously hoping that&#39;s a troll making the effort to not look like a troll.  If that&#39;s a real fic, I have just lost all faith in any writer that is on the same site as that thing.  I have no words for it.  I&#39;m going to go drink fifteen bottles of Bleepka now.</p>
