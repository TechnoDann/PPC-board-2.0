            <p>My impression of the Draconians, whatever the color, was that they aren&#39;t too bright. They also tend to explode or do other bad things when injured or killed.<br><br>Honestly, if you think you need some kind of big impressive species/weapons for your agents to be interesting, you&#39;re going about it the wrong way.

            <p>We are not D&amp;D munchkins trying to make the most powerful agents (as if there were actually a chance of the Sues winning when <i>you</i> are writing your own missions). Jay and Acacia got rid of a great number of Sues without even belonging to an impressive species or having loads of advanced weaponry. They were just smart and resourceful, and most of all their missions were cleverly written to make their victories look credible. Many of our best agents are <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normals</a>. Being excessively powerful for no particular reason is against the spirit of the PPC.<br><br><br><br>&quot;He who fights Sues should look to it that he himself does not become a Sue.

            <p>Haven&#39;t the foggiest, but, in the interests of not shoving posts off the first page, in future could you perhaps put additional questions in the same thread, if you&#39;ve already got a question near the top of the page? A series of new threads by one person makes it easier to miss things, and if you simply put another post in your existing thread, people will still notice it and answer. Cheers.</p>

            <p>My primary set of Agents is currently a trio - Cassie, Nat and Kelvin - but as far as I&#39;m aware, most Agent teams are in pairs.<br><br>Back in the golden days of the PPC, i.e. before the LOTR movies came out, I&#39;ve heard that Agents used to go around in threes quite regularly. However, the influx of badfic once the first LOTR film was released meant that there just weren&#39;t enough Agent teams to deal with it all, so the groupings were reduced to pairs. And, of course, there are Agents who don&#39;t have partners at all because of the understaffing.<br><br>And I&#39;ve always had the image of most Response Centres being set up to only hold two Agents. My trio doesn&#39;t have so much of a problem, because Kelvin&#39;s an Elf and therefore doesn&#39;t actually need sleep as such. He&#39;s willing enough to kick back on the sofa and rest there.</p>

            <p>you could try to put in more.

            <p>First, I&#39;d like to plug two missions.<br>One I finished at the beginning of this month, but hadn&#39;t plugged here yet: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3413231/9/"> Like Father, Like Daughter</a>, a Torchwood mission.<br>And one I posted today: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2873191/25/"> Over the River</a>, an A-Team mission.<br><br>I&#39;ve added up all the missions I&#39;ve written (varying in length between 500 and 15000 words) and came to a total of 50 missions.<br><br>And I thought it was the day-job that was giving me burnout.</p>

            <p>... it&#39;s not only England that&#39;s allowed to call Gatherings. To my knowledge there&#39;ve been at least three official ones outside the UK -- Canada, New Yorkish, and somewhere antipodean. Obviously if you live in Mongolia or somewhere it&#39;d be a bit tricky, but most places you can pull at least two or three other people together.

            <p>I feel bad for him, the poor elf. No canon character deserves that type of fan abuse repeatedly. I don&#39;t like lemons because of past bad experiences, but I don&#39;t usually have problems with them. This, though... I read the author&#39;s note and two lines, then stopped. It made me nauseous just thinking about it. My poor brain can only stand limes at the worst these days. I think this is why I would fail at the Department of Bad Slash.

            <p>Thank you very much. I know what&#39;s desensitised me; repeated readings of badfic, up to and including C*l*br**n, and prolonged exposure to Pads/Trojie/their missions/Sara/other assorted gutterminds. Which accounts for me volunteering to take on a fic for Bad Slash that even Trojie said she wouldn&#39;t touch unless someone asked her nicely. :D</p>

            <p>We&#39;ve had problems in the past because people claimed the PPC was persecuting them directly. By all means do whatever you want -- we&#39;re not the Thought Police -- but it would be nice if you did <i>not</i> claim to be acting on behalf of the PPC.

            <p>So, here&#39;s the thing: I was poking around the Pit about a month ago with Cirichen Anekath when I stumbled across a section for a series I&#39;d always believed to be terribly obscure - Earth&#39;s Children. Intrigued, I decided to investigate. Imagine my horror on discovering a Suethor whose first Sue appeared to be about twelve years old.<br><br>So, to cut a long story short, I decided to kill her. Here&#39;s a link!

            <p>Inwardly, Zach breathed a sigh of relief.

The last thing she wanted was to accidentally hurt him.<br><br>Eventually, Nat slowly broke the kiss, but only so that she could put the drink down and wrap her arms around Zach properly, one arm around his waist and the other hand resting on his shoulder.

            <p>I agree completely.<br><br>Ohhh... Well, I once read some stuff out of a book called &quot;The Book of Animal Ignorance&quot;, where each chapter described bizarre facts about certain animals. Apparently, two male penguins in a zoo actually got together during mating season raised an egg together. (Where they got the egg, the book didn&#39;t say.) I think I mentioned that vaguely somewhere in the mission and forgot to explain it.</p>

            <p>So do swans and at least one type of geese. They tend to let a female stick around long enough to lay the egg and then keep it for themselves, or steal one from another nest.<br><br>And there used to be a Wikipedia entry entitled &quot;Homosexual necrophilia in the mallard duck&quot;. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still there and I don&#39;t quite dare go looking. (Apparently the event described only happened in front of a human observer once, which is kind of a relief.)</p>

Chliever and Winston confront junk mail, North Korean propaganda, character replacements, Teen Titans, Castlevania villains, second person, present tense, urple romance, ethnic stereotypes, EZ-Bake, and dismemberment caused by typos! Also, they&#39;re forced to do half the mission IN THE DARK!<br><br>This is what I&#39;d call a &quot;bonding&quot; mission, as, if you recall, Chliever and Winston barely met before being sent off on their first mission. Winston&#39;s still sort of a sidekick at this point, but I have big things planned for him later on. Also, if you&#39;re an observant sort, see if you can spot the first mention of a character who will be very important later on.</p>

            <p>Capitalization errors are by far the most egregious offenses, because they&#39;re so, so easy to get right. Proper nouns get the caps, acronyms get the caps, the starts of sentences get the caps, and that&#39;s about it! It&#39;s acceptable to use caps to add emphasis to shouting lines, but beyond that...<br><br>Ugh, I&#39;m just glad I don&#39;t have to look at this one again. Part of me thinks I really should have taken it a bit farther; in the next chapter it was revealed that she saved Chilly at some point before that story, which we never see more detail of, and then [saccharine] everybody loves her because she&#39;s so sweet and helpful! [/saccharine] Blech. But at that point, I just couldn&#39;t take anymore of the atrocious grammar errors.</p>

However, the PPC recognises them as another <i>version</i> of the canon, and gives them equal legitimacy - regardless of how different they are to the original source material.<br><br>Sorry to disappoint (there are plenty of canon characters we&#39;d like to take a sharp object to, believe me), but that&#39;s how the PPC is - it&#39;s the way Jay and Acacia did it, so we can&#39;t outright contradict it.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know if it would do any internal damage, but you could always try sulfur mustard, also known as mustard gas.  it causes horrendous burns.  that would be very humiliating to a Sue.  or if you are aiming for long term unconsciousness you could use EA-3167, which would cause the victim to remain unconscious for several days with a very small dose(injected into the bloodstream).  or, again, for burns or blisters, Lewisite.

            <p>I&#39;ve found a Sue, who, after being subjected to torture which involved burning her eyeballs out with a hot sword, somehow managed to regrow said eyeballs, despite being full-blood human and coming from a continuum which follows Real World laws of physics and biology. Her eyes are now solid crimson, she has heat-vision, and she can replay past events on her retinas. <br>Would the DoMSE like said eyeballs recovered for research purposes?</p>

            <p>That means that some <i>may</i> have stomachs that function the same way as humans, although the fact that they stay thin even after they &#39;give up their bad habit&#39; may mean that this is a red herring. Also, there are indications that their reproductive systems function differently than those of humans. The lack of menustration whih I mentioned in the other post is only one of them. For example, almost no genetic defects relating to looks and personality traits are passed down Suvian children.<br><br>Also, it&#39;s possible that the Glitter in the Sue&#39;s blood is a mutagen tied to the author&#39;s will. This explains why Increasing or Decreasing the level of it adds to Suvian charactheristics (Intelligentpetin and other substances may also have an effect). Since the consensus is that Marysues are non-sentient, it could also mean that the glitter can prevent sentience from forming, although it <i>can</i> create an imitation of the soul(purposefully made to be sucked out to advance the story&#39;s &#39;plot<br>). I make no definite conclusions, however.  </p>

            <p>What I mean is, several fanfics show Sues having souls that are sucked out and eaten by their designated enemies. Since many people think that Sues are non-sentient (this is my weakest point), those sould could possibly be imitations, especially since a majority of Sues belong to worlds where sentience=soul(like LOTR). </p>

            <p>Ah, much better clarification. Thank you.<br><br>Of course, we could have a long and rambling and ultimately pointless argument about whether a canon who believes himself to have a soul actually has one, or whether he&#39;s simply mistaken, since for them to exist, even in a Word World, a lot of Science has to go right out of the window. But I&#39;ll grant that there&#39;s certainly <i>something</i>, be it a soul, a spirit, a mind, or just an emergent feature of a working human brain, that can be sucked out, for example, by Dementors.<br><br>As for Sues&#39; lack of sentience, I&#39;m not convinced on that one yet. They are able to communicate with Agents, after all, and it&#39;s not known whether the Suethor constantly has her attention on her fic. And if the Suethor&#39;s not paying attention and hasn&#39;t written her Sue interacting with Agents, then presumably that interaction is of the Sue herself&#39;s volition. And I can see this ending up drawing a lot of parallels with artificial intelligence, so I shall stop there for now.</p>

            <p>I can accept that. Of course, the Sue interacting with the Agents sent to kill it may have been because it was temporarily transferred to the control of <i>another</i> author.

            <p>...What? I can steal Trojie&#39;s hat if I want to. :P<br><br>How long you live is determined by your cells&#39; ability to regenerate, if memory serves. They keep replacing themselves throughout your life but as you get older they get less good at it. That&#39;s a really bad way of explaining it, but most of the details are buried in either a) the back of my brain or b) one of my books downstairs which I can&#39;t be bothered to go get. But basically if your cells could always regenerate perfectly then, barring illness, you could live pretty much forever.<br><br>Decomposition is more about bacteria and such eating you when you&#39;re dead.

Who knows.<br><br>At a guess I&#39;d say the only nourishment they take from normal human food is the sugar (for that special saccharine sparkliness), and possibly such things as aspartame and monosodium glutamate. So unless they&#39;re living on chocolate and junk food, calorie intake would be minimal, thus explaining the gaunt physique.<br><br>Also on the drinking front, the idea of getting absolutely trashed as a means of being sociable and <i>not</i> to facilitate angst is clearly utterly alien.</p>

            <p>In fact, story reasons may override any suvian charatheristics as long as the Author demands it. That further strengthens the theory that Glitter is tied to the will of whoever runs the story. Since Semi-Suvian OC&#39;s have only been recruited when the Author&#39;s attention is removed from them, that could mean that if the Sue could be cut off from it&#39;s Author&#39;s baleful influence (through Glitter withrawal or the severing of the mystical link itself), it can gain non-suvian traits, like sentience and common sense. Of course, only a few main characters and many side ones have only been cut off from Authorial influence, so I can&#39;t say for sure.</p>

            <p>The question is, where does the potency come from? Is it because the Glitter is the embodiment of authorial will, or just connected to it? We cannot ignore the role of the author in the formation of the sue. <br><br>There is another question, however. What happens when a reasonable OC gets transferred into the control of a Suethor, or a Sue is transferred into the control of a Goodfic author? Do brains just degrade or develop instantly?

            <p>Yep, that&#39;s right. After nearly two months, a good few weeks of which I didn&#39;t even want to touch it, I&#39;ve finally finished my second mission for the PPC. Can&#39;t say I enjoyed having to write it, but I&#39;m <i>really</i> glad to see this particular Sue dispatched.<br><br><a href="http://rc5593.webs.com/mission2.htm"><a href="http://rc5593.webs.com/mission2.htm">http://rc5593.webs.com/mission2.htm</a></a><br><br>There you go, hope you enjoy it. I should say, the mission is rather long, so please be sure you have a good chunk of free time before reading it. Now, for the warnings: The mission in question contains violence, including a rather detailed description of a fight that occurs later on, blood from both Agents and Sues, and instances of adult language. However, I&#39;ve taken pains to make sure it remains work safe. The warning is repeated in the disclaimer, almost verbatim.<br><br>Now, on to more fun things. One of the four hammerspace knives has been reserved by Cassie Cameron-Young, but if you wish to obtain one, just request such here and say which of your Agents you would like to have buy the weapon. Keep in mind that Big Murphy, the character to whom the knives are pawned, will not sell them cheaply, but other than that there&#39;s pretty much no strings attached. Just be sure you&#39;ve actually read how the knives are described in the mission to help with using them and such, though that&#39;s more advice than anything. <br><br>Now, on to minis. I acquired five mini-P.A.s over the course of the mission, would anybody like to adopt one?</p>

            <p>KGarrett did get incredibly irate while writing this mission. I should know, I betaed it for him. :P<br><br>As for charge lists, there were about fifty charges there altogether, not including the four &quot;interrupting a PPC Agent&quot; ones. There have been longer, I&#39;ll say now. The longest one I know of was actually one of mine - about 110, in the end.</p>

            <p>Well, I suppose it just seemed longer because of the interruptions and because he was so erudite with the charges. It&#39;s obvious he&#39;s passionate about M*A*S*H, which I wholly approve. While the show was a bit before my time, I&#39;ve loved all the episodes I&#39;ve been able to see.</p>

            <p>Because have I got a fic for you!<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1828598/1/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1828598/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1828598/1/</a></a><br><br>I personally think, that had this been in a more well-known fandom, this could easily qualify for Legendary Badfic. It has all the hallmarks, namely, really graphic and badly-written sex, violence, and cliches.<br><br>In this fic, we are introduced to Experiments 411 and 412, a hooker and a pimp designed to cause political sex scandals. Hunkahunka returns, modified by Hamsterviel to stimulate sex drives instead of just infatuation. Mertle gets pecked and tries to marry Lilo, also, Jumba and Nani get pecked and rape Pleakley. Angel, now a musical theater diva, has her co-star in &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; get pecked and think he really IS the Phantom of the Opera. Finder humps a tree. Lots of Experiments have sex and die. Hamsterviel abuses his Experiments (despite them being his own financial property) and can shoot lightning. And then... there&#39;s Karnax...<br><br>Experiment 001 was created brain-dead, so Jumba conjured up the soul of a war god, Karnax, to possess the body. Now, this TECHNICALLY isn&#39;t a Charge (we didn&#39;t know who Experiment 001 was at the time this was written), but I think the presence of magic in &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; is. Karnax kills people bloodily, including the hooker, whom he rips in half and then forges each half into a sword. He kills Nani too, as it turns out she&#39;s pregnant and he eviscerates her to get the baby. And it ends with a hook for a sequel...<br><br>If no one wants this, I&#39;ll take it.</p>

            <p>Basically, rocks fall, everyone dies. Also, a monster from &quot;Dexter&#39;s Lab&quot; appears as an experiment, Pleakley kidnaps Ben Stiller, Cobra Bubbles is killed by Osama bin Laden (and is FBI, not CIA), and there&#39;s this subplot about Houdini trying to gain confidence that never goes anywhere.<br><br>There ARE actually some good parts to it, particularly, Jumba&#39;s ex-wife makes a great villain, and chapter 6 is fun. But that&#39;s not enough to save it. The author admits that the entire plot is lifted from Sonic Heroes; I&#39;ve never played that, so I don&#39;t know the extent of the plagiarism, but it&#39;s probably a lot.<br><br>And guess what? It ends with ANOTHER sequel hook, as Hamsterviel downloads his mind into the Internet and Jumba creates three new experiments.</p>
