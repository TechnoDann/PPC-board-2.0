            <p>Hey all<br><br>Our Wiki is looking really good these days, but we still have over 300 wanted pages - and while a lot of them are pages for Agents, there are still a lot of canon characters, tech, worlds, events and so on that have redlinked pages.<br><br>If everyone pitched in and did a page each, just one page, a night for a week, even if it was just putting in the very bare bones and making a stub page, then we could get a decent chunk of these redlinks gone :)<br><br>And if people could also look over and check none of their agents have redlinks that would be cool too - *someone* must know who all these people are!<br><br>We don&#39;t need vast amounts of detail. We just need a couple of sentences - the great thing is that once a page has been created, people will edit it, but everyone seems to be shy of being the person to create the page. <br><br>Everyone&#39;s been doing a great job of keeping the missions up to date, and the Unclaimed, Claimed and Killed Badfic Lists, and the pages we already have are always being checked over for spelling and content, which is awesome, and huge thanks to everyone who does that. Even if you just move a comma to its correct place, that&#39;s still a help.<br><br>But let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t kick that Wanted Pages list into shape, shall we? <br><br>- Trojie, your friendly Not At All Any Kind of Authority Figure, Friendly and Periodically Overenthusiastic Wiki Admin</p>

            <p>Jeeze... I wish I could go back. I&#39;ve been re-reading Harry Potter and reading the Shoebox Project in preparation for a massive fanfic undertaking, and it&#39;s making me miss England terribly. And now this. And the Armouries look really cool, what with the shinies and the critters and all. I think the most critters I saw in one place on my trip were the ravens at the Tower of London (unless you count my classmates), and I couldn&#39;t pet those.<br><br>My fiance and I could move in with one of you guys for a while, right? Just until we got jobs, right? ... Let&#39;s just never mind that no British publisher is probably going to want an American on staff. That&#39;s okay, I&#39;ll sell tea or flowers or something. I&#39;m looking into tea stores over here as it is.<br><br>... Anyway. I&#39;m glad the Gathering worked out. This third of it at least sounds like a great time. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1165397/1/Corvus_et_Serpensia">This</a> is in desperate need of attention, both because it is unfinished, which bothers me, and because I started writing it a million years ago, and therefore it sucks, which bothers me more. The fact that it&#39;s based on a role-play that took place a million years ago doesn&#39;t help, but still. The guy who played Snape and I both have versions, and we&#39;ve both decided to re-write to bring the whole thing as close to canon as possible. That means there probably won&#39;t be Angsty Mansex, but there will be Teenage Drama, and I&#39;ll probably have to cut it with some bizarre humor such as the Shoebox has to offer. Plus, the Shoebox Project is just plain awesome.<br><br>Tea and copy editing, all under the same roof. Hmmm. It could work. I must give it some thought....<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Not even a little bit of Angsty Mansex? *pouts*<br><br>I&#39;ve skimmed through the first couple of chapters and it doesn&#39;t look too bad to me. That said, the only stuff I usually see with OCs in is stuff being sporked by DMS agents, so I can see it&#39;s definitely better than that, but not much else. I&#39;ll look forward to betaing the revised version though.<br><br>You know, the more I think about it, the more I like the idea of a sort of tea house where one can sit down and have a good brew and also get one&#39;s essays proofread.</p>

            <p>Yay for Angsty Mansex! There should be more of it in the world.<br><br>I was more sort of picturing how well such an establishment would work on the main road near me - it&#39;s a sort of high street, ie full of shops and cafes and coffee shops and such, and it&#39;s student central. Get a good range of reasonably priced tea in, interestingly eclectic yet quiet music, nice big armchairs, possibly a few bookshelves, wifi, and a big comfy armchair in the back for whoever&#39;s on beta shift to sit in and go over any essays or assignments for a small fee.

            <p>The favorite example being the time that Jay and Acacia were Ents, got shot with arrows, and didn&#39;t mind (until they dropped the disguises). A similar thing happened when they were dragons and someone ate a Sue and regretted it after the disguises were dropped. However, it&#39;s not a complete change, as the agent&#39;s mind is mostly untouched by the disguise. Also, as seen above, I don&#39;t think you could use a disguise to repair an injury.

            <p>If I may ask a polite question, how do you write missions so quickly? Especially while doing them so well? I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how to get more productive with my own missions, especially since I have so many Agents, so I thought I would ask. If it&#39;s not a bother that is; I was just thinking that maybe I could pick something up. On the whole, just curious and thought there wasn&#39;t harm in asking.</p>

            <p>I guess in part it seems that I write missions quickly because I&#39;ve just posted two in nine days. This last one took me about a month to write. The one I posted last week was written in a matter of hours (badfic was posted on the fourth, my mission on the sixth). I have a betareader that responds very quickly.<br><br>I think the main thing is that I make time to write missions. And experience probably also plays a part in it: I can write missions quickly because I&#39;ve written a lot of them. Also, I write missions by hand, so when not able to take a laptop with me (too heavy, battery is on life-support) I can still take the mission with me and work on it.<br><br>I think it also helps that I put badfic on FFnet on alerts when I first see it. That way I never have to really hunt for badfic, and I can see which of them have been updated since (and which haven&#39;t and likely don&#39;t have enough charges for an interesting mission).<br><br>Other than that, I&#39;m probably just a fast writer. <br><br>Trojie and Pads are very productive too. Perhaps they have some additional secrets to share.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s not all of it, though, because I know my co-writes aren&#39;t exactly going quickly, though it&#39;s more my fault than my co-authors&#39;, heh. I haven&#39;t seen either of them in a long while, but I can ask them if I manage to get in touch with them. And yeah, I know looking for the badfic is always one of the hardest parts for me; I tend to try to do the intro and possibly outro first, then work the actual mission in there once I&#39;ve got a fic. <br><br>I should probably start trying to write things by hand, too. It&#39;d balance out how unreliable this computer is until I&#39;ve got a better one, for one. Another problem might be the sheer volume of projects (and missions) I&#39;m trying to do all at once, but that&#39;s a matter of prioritising I guess. <br><br>I&#39;ll keep what you&#39;ve said in mind and work on writing more quickly, as well as getting past writers&#39; block more easily. Next time I see Trojie or Pads, assuming I can get a word in, I&#39;ll ask their input on it, too. I try to avoid fics that&#39;ve updated really recently in case they update while I&#39;m writing, or after I&#39;ve finished the mission (completed badfics are good for that), but I can start looking at those more, too. Thanks, though, I&#39;m hoping it&#39;ll help me actually produce stuff (and stuff worth reading; no point being productive if it&#39;s worse than the stuff we&#39;re sporking, heh).</p>

            <p>We write by dumping the text of the badfic to a googledoc and then one of us starts writing, cutting the bits of fic we want to refer to into the mission with italics and so forth, and deleting the unused bits, until they run out of steam, upon which they gchat the other person saying &#39;tag&#39; :) <br><br>But at least partly it&#39;s the experience thing as well - we&#39;ve been writing together (not PPC) since 2004, and I&#39;ve been writing PPC missions since 2003. Until Pads joined me here in 2008, though, I&#39;d only completed five missions. Now, we have each other to kickstart us when we&#39;re blocked, we have the experience writing *together* (so there&#39;s no worrying about if the other one will like what we&#39;ve done or will get offended if we edit what they&#39;ve written), and we&#39;ve had the practice actually doing missions. We know what works and what doesn&#39;t. And the only way to get that is to just keep plugging away :)<br><br>I think the most important thing is to push yourself past your block. If you get blocked, make yourself write another couple of sentences. Even if they suck. Then quit the doc and go do something else. When you come back, yeah, those two bad sentences will be there, but maybe you&#39;ll see a way to fix them and that will spur you on :) And practice, practice, practice!<br><br>/end pep-talk :)</p>

            <p>Seconding the importance of writing even if the words coming out are crap. Keep going and keep writing anyway, and come back and fix or delete later as necessary (this is the bit badfic authors tend to fall down on). This is sort of how Trojie and I end up writing non-mission things: she&#39;s a lot better than I am at getting words written whatever the quality, and I&#39;ve got a knack for using what she produces as a basis and adding the pretty sprinkles that were eluding her, and between us it works. But without that initial push to just keep writing and get the words down, we&#39;d have nothing to prettify and things would go at a snail&#39;s pace.</p>

            <p>Literally, in this case.<br><br>I just saw that movie 9 yesterday. (No clue what those critics were talking about; I thought it rocked.) And anyway, after watching it, I had some odd and somewhat horrifying thoughts that I thought I might bring up for the sake of discussion. A fandom sprung up around WALL-E. The very same will probably happen with 9. And we all know; with a fandom, comes badfic. To make matters oh so much worse, two of the characters (3 and 4), are TWINS. Moreover, they are ADORABLE. And inseparable. And they are 3 and 4. As in, Rule 34 (sick director&#39;s joke or odd coincidence, I wonder?). Do you all see what I&#39;m getting at here?<br><br>Still more horrifying is the point I&#39;m getting to. If badfic is to spring up, well, how exactly does one do a mission in a universe where all life on earth has been wiped out, and the number of living, sentient creatures is so specific, it&#39;s actually the title? I suppose a possible disguise would be those spider-robot mook things, but then again, they don&#39;t appear until very late in the movie, and they&#39;re all wiped out by the end.<br><br>Needless to say, I have prepared my panic room.<br><br>Your thoughts? Just curious.</p>

            <p>That said, in regard to potential disguises for Agents, I think I&#39;ve read a few missions where they went in as themselves. If that doesn&#39;t work out, perhaps something could be done to render the Agents invisible so any noncanons don&#39;t see them? Having canon-compliant disguises sounds rather difficult, though since I&#39;m not familiar with the canon, I may be wrong.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m trying to stay with friends wherever possible, but I have also looked into hostels. Most of the YHA/HI London hostels are GBP 22.50 a night for a shared dorm. I stayed at two when I was in London a couple of years ago (St Pauls and Oxford Street) - I preferred Oxford Street as it had nicer rooms (at least at the time).</p>

            <p>Look online for hostels. We&#39;ve got them all over the place. So far as I know you&#39;re usually looking at fifteen or twenty quid a night, though I&#39;ve not investigated this personally.<br><br>Dunno if I&#39;ll be able to make it. I seem to have utterly lost my ability to handle public transport, and the current cash situation is a bit minimal, thanks to being on the dole. I&#39;ll give a better idea nearer the time.<br><br>Where are you going in England? Is it just London, or are you seeing the rest of the country? Only within a month there&#39;ll be two of us in Hull and another just up the motorway in Leeds, and a fourth just across the Pennines. Come north!</p>

Slightly better summery inside Slytherin!Harry Vampire!Harry<br>Harry Potter - Rated: T - English - Horror/Supernatural - Chapters: 1 - Words: 1,065 - Published: 9-12-09 - Harry P. &amp; Severus S</i><br>Ignoring the Slytherin!Harry.<br><br>&quot;Ugh! I can&#39;t believe he gave you detention for that, Harry!&quot; <br><br>Harry grimaced and made an irritated noise in the back of his throat, but the rest of his speech was cut off as Hermione came up behind them.<br><br>&quot;Really, you can&#39;t, Ron? You can&#39;t believe Professor Snape gave Harry a detention for putting slices of frog liver on his seat when he wasn&#39;t looking? Because it seems pretty believable to me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He was asking for it,&quot; muttered Harry. &quot;Sometimes I wish there was something I could do to really get back at him for what he&#39;s done. It&#39;s all his fault anyway, he practically encouraged Malfoy to throw that vampire blood at me.&quot;<br><br>The three winced at the recollection, when Snape had turned his back and Harry had gotten a few swallows of vampire blood in his mouth. The incident had left him <s>sparkling in the sunlight forevermore</s> with a pale complexion and a craving for blood, which he now drank a glass of every night before bed, usually the blood of an orangutan. Dumbledore maintained that it hadn&#39;t been Snape&#39;s fault, and Malfoy had suffered for quite some time, but for Harry and Ron, despite Hermione&#39;s halfhearted protests, something was wrong with the whole picture.<br><br>Ron held the Great Hall door open as they entered. &quot;Yeah, sometimes I wonder if he&#39;s even got a heart at all.&quot;<br><br>Harry didn&#39;t miss the Look from Professor McGonagall in his direction as Snape leaned over to tell her something, the usual sneer on his face. He grimaced again and forced down the rest of his lunch, dreading the detention to come. The rest of the day passed in a blur, and he trudged down to the Potions Dungeon with a heavy heart that night.<br><br>&quot;Mr. Potter,&quot; came the sneering voice from the dungeon. &quot;Please be so kind as to shut the door behind you.&quot; <br><br>Harry stepped in, closing the door carefully behind him. &quot;Yes, Professor.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Due to the nature of your... prank,&quot; he said, pronouncing the word as though it was a kind of toad, &quot;You will be removing the livers from enough frogs to get my sixth-year advanced class through next year.&quot; <br><br>Harry had no idea how the next words made their way to his mouth, without bothering to check with his brain first. &quot;Ron&#39;s right, you have no heart.&quot;<br><br>Snape blinked, so taken aback, for the moment, that he had no response ready to hand. Then he cracked an amused expression, which might&#39;ve been a smile, had it not also spelled D-O-O-M in neon flashing letters to Harry. <br><br>&quot;Potter, you swallowed vampire blood last year.&quot; Harry tried to keep from looking blank, but only succeeded in looking blankly terrified. Snape sighed. &quot;You really are your father&#39;s son.&quot;<br><br>Well-chosen words, the usual barb jostled Harry from his mental state and he glared. &quot;My father, sir, was--&quot;<br><br>&quot;About as subtle as a brick wall,&quot; Snape drawled. &quot;You&#39;re a vampire, which means that you can see body heat. Which means you can see that I have a heart, and, furthermore, that it is beating.&quot;<br><br>Harry blinked, and, curious, allowed his eyes to relax. Very, very faintly, his eyes located thermal images, proving that Snape indeed have a heart. He opened his mouth, but was cut off again.<br><br>&quot;But thank you for the compliment, Potter. Which reminds me, why don&#39;t you also remove the hearts from those frogs and pickle them? Should keep you out of... trouble, for a few hours.&quot; The malicious sneer made it perfectly clear that there would be no Quidditch practice, and furthermore that this was part of the plan. Harry sighed and got to work on the frogs. Life as usual, he supposed.</p>

Slightly better summery inside Slytherin!Harry Vampire!Harry</i><br><br>Meir Brin of the Hogwarts Fanfiction Academy shook her head sadly. &quot;There&#39;s no doubt about it,&quot; she told the assembled staff. &quot;Madam Pomfrey says it&#39;s as bad a case of Severitus as she&#39;s ever seen.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So, he&#39;s just going to keep doing that?&quot; said Professor McGonagall. &quot;Sort of... <i>splintering</i> like that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Until the disease runs out of non-canon versions of Harry Potter to sever off him. Or until Professor Snape can brew the cure,&quot; Brin amended almost as an afterthought.<br><br>Harry Potter lay on a medical bed before them, looking pale, but fortunately sedated. Before their eyes, he grew filmy and indistinct, like a snake&#39;s skin just before molting. Then, as though someone had taken a knife and pared off an extra layer, a second Harry separated itself from the first and came to stand at the foot of the bed. This new Harry was almost the same as the first except for the Slytherin crest on his robes and the look of deep angst and woe on his face. He opened his mouth as though to bemoan his existence, but he was clouted soundly on the head first. He crumpled to the ground, revealing Madam Pomfrey and a very large case of medical supplies.<br><br>Pomfrey shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s better for the patient this way.&quot;<br><br>The staff shook off their surprise and moved the new Harry to a bed of its own. At that time, Severus Snape appeared.<br><br>&quot;How is it going, Severus?&quot; Dumbledore asked.<br><br>Snape scowled. &quot;The same as before, Headmaster. It won&#39;t work unless I can have a heart.&quot; He eyed Harry speculatively.<br><br>&quot;Yes, it is a shame we had to destroy the last one,&quot; Dumbledore said, casting a look of regret toward a bed with a sheet thrown over it. The sheet didn&#39;t quite disguise the fact that the body beneath had a rather large stake through its chest. &quot;But perhaps this new one will be of more use.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We shall see,&quot; said Madam Pomfrey. &quot;I&#39;ll ask you all to please keep back, this is a very sensitive matter.&quot;<br><br>The staff gave Pomfrey her space, as none of them really wanted to see what was about to happen. There came a sound awfully like <i>splorch</i>, and a smell of freshly cut grass and warm dust filled the room.<br><br>&quot;Summery,&quot; Meir Brin commented. &quot;Weird.&quot;<br><br>The others nodded.<br><br>A few minutes later, Madam Pomfrey emerged from behind the screened-off bed and held out a porcelain bowl to Snape. &quot;There you are,&quot; she said. &quot;One heart.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good,&quot; said Snape, though not as enthusiastically as he might have had the organ in question come from the original and not a copy. &quot;The potion should be ready by the end of the day.&quot; He took the bowl containing the heart and returned swiftly to the dungeons and his potion.</p>

            <p>Warning: slightly, er, noncon. Although utterly non-explicit, because we realised halfway through writing this that we don&#39;t actually know how to write het. We have taken the liberty of assuming the author of the fic summary is a Sue, and inserted her into this fic. Enjoy, or something.<br><br>***<br><br>&#39;Like, here kitty kitty?&#39;<br><br>Hissing softly, Greebo shrank further back into the dark recesses of his latest hidey-hole. The <i>creature</i>, whatever it was, surely wouldn&#39;t find him here. He flicked his tail, annoyed, as he heard the soft footsteps getting closer.<br><br>&#39;Mister kitty cat, won&#39;t you come and play?&#39;<br><br>Even the voice was unnatural, smooth and yet tinkly and making all the hairs down Greebo&#39;s spine stand on end. And that was to say nothing of how the thing <i>looked</i>...<br><br>&#39;Gotcha!&#39;<br><br>Suddenly there was light.<br><br>Greebo skittered out from his den of discarded wooden crates, and made a break for it through the impossibly slender and slightly sparkly legs in front of him. A perfectly manicured hand shot out, and missed him by a whisker. He skidded round the corner at high speed.<br><br>And stopped. Ahead was a blank wall, too high to leap. Behind, and rapidly approaching, was a beast straight from the Dungeon Dimensions. It gave a feral smile as it advanced.<br><br>There was only one possible escape, and Greebo took it.<br><br>There was a horrible moment where morphic resonance twanged like a piano-string, and then he was lurching to two flat, clawless feet.<br><br>The terrible beast was now at least a head shorter than him. Greebo grinned. He liked having the advantage. He wasn&#39;t well equipped, in this form, to bite the back of the creature&#39;s neck and shake it until bits snapped, but these strong human arms ought to be good for something. He reached out, and seized the thing with one hand.<br><br>&#39;Mroooowl?&#39;<br><br>&#39;Erk!&#39;<br><br>Mrrrroww!&#39;<br><br>It struggled in his grasp, but something still wasn&#39;t right. Like any self-respecting cat, Greebo was in the habit of playing with his prey before eating it, though he was willing to concede that tossing it into the air and catching it might be a little difficult without paws. He&#39;d been quite willing to give it a try just a moment before, but as his fingers tightened round its throat, he found himself overcome with an urge, or, more accurately, an Urge, to play with it in a slightly different manner.<br><br>He sniffed. Ah, there was the reason. The Beast had, it seemed, been party to similar Urges. Had being the operative word here. Now it seemed mostly to be harbouring fear. But Greebo was rather sensitive to smells, and both were lingering.<br><br>Well that was <i>fine</i>. Greebo rather liked fear. And Urges too.<br><br>He also liked the way this human form wasn&#39;t lumbered with clothes when Nanny wasn&#39;t about. It made things so much easier, not having to try to handle buttons. This meant that he was rather exposed, of course, but the fiend didn&#39;t seem to have any idea at <i>all</i> about not playing fair, and kept its knees resolutely down. And pressed tightly together.<br><br>He looked down.<br><br><i>Ah</i>.<br><br>Yes, definitely Urges. The sparkling, whimpering creature followed Greebo&#39;s gaze, and gulped.<br><br>We will draw a delicate veil over the story at this point, and reconvene several months later ...<br><br>&#39;Oh, Greebo, you naughty boy!&#39;<br><br>&#39;Naughty doesn&#39;t really cover it, Gytha,&#39; said Granny Weatherwax, looking down at the sad, mewling heap on Nanny Ogg&#39;s doorstep.<br><br>&#39;I&#39;m sure he didn&#39;t mean anything by it, really,&#39; Nanny said, clucking. Granny sniffed.<br><br>&#39;And why are they so <i>glittery</i>, d&#39;you think?&#39;<br><br>&#39;Search me,&#39; said Nanny, picking one of the strange kittens up and inspecting it closely. &#39;But don&#39;t you think they&#39;ve got his eyes?&#39;<br><br>&#39;So long as they haven&#39;t got his temperament.&#39; Granny sniffed once more, then peered at the dangling scrap of sparkling fluff in Nanny&#39;s hand. &#39;Well,&#39; she added. &#39;They&#39;ve definitely got his smell.&#39;<br><br>&#39;Oosa widdle sweetie den?&#39; asked Nanny of the kitten. Granny rolled her eyes.<br><br>&#39;Widdle sounds about right,&#39; she said. </p>

            <p>Barnabus tried to blink as the message ended. The tasoth had received many strange instructions over the millennium, ranging from a giant jellyfish with poison replaced with weapons it could not use to a T-Rex with a sonic cannon, but an underwater cat was particularly strange. Still, when commands came from T&#39;leth, he obeyed.<br><br>Barnabus picked one of the lobstermen on the base at random to help with the design. After a few hours, the design seemed mostly complete, but something seemed off. The half-inch thick aqua plastic armor was somehow un-catlike. When he asked the lobsterman about it, the lobsterman said, &quot;Yes, but it may run into X-com troops.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh. Okay then, the armor is fine. Actually, give it more armor.&quot;<br><br>Something seemed vaguely off about the cluster of facial tentacles, but Barnabus decided it was good enough and sent the design to the cloning vats.</p>

            <p>To make a cat, you must first make a deuterostome.<br>Take an ovocyte, make it divide for a certain number of times, until you get a hollow sphere called a blastula.<br>Then, fold one half of the blastula inside the other and stretch it somewhat (the exact way depends on species). You&#39;ll obtain a gastrula, with a hole at one end which will become the anus. The ectoderm (outer layer), mesoderm (filling the former hole of the blastula) and endoderm (inner layer) are formed at this step. You have now a deuterostome.<br>Then, you&#39;ll have to get a chordate.<br>Development continues with neurulation: the neural tube is formed by folding the dorsal ectoderm along the notochord (structure existing in all chordate embryos, but which persists in only a few chordate species). Then, somites (corresponding to future vertebrae) form, one after the other. You have a chordate.<br>With a chordate, you then make a vertebrate, a gnathostome (jawed vertebrate, jaws form from branchial arcs), an osteichthyan (the name means bony fish, as opposed to cartilagenous fish (chondrichthyan), but it also includes tetrapods as well). Than you get a tetrapod, by forming the limbs. The tetrapod becomes then a mammal and then a cat.<br>Let the cat grow for a while, and you&#39;re done.<br><br>Well, in fact, it&#39;s a bit more complicated, but that&#39;s a rough outline.</p>

            <p>Must it be within the fandom originally used? Because if not, I can already think of something (still fanfic, but in a different fandom) to do with the last one. <br><br>If not, well, I&#39;ll try something else. </p>

            <p>–or– What happens when Victor Frankenstein wants a pet.<br>Please help me make a cat!<br><br>Victor Frankenstein sat in his study, a cup of tea at his elbow, contemplating. His life as a student was not a bad one, but lonely. He closed his book, and looked at his covered table. It was almost finished. <br><br>The knock on the door startled him out of his reveries. <br><br>“Henry!” he cried, gesturing for his friend Henry Clerval to come inside. “You’re just in time! Henry, please help me make a cat!”<br><br>“A cat?” Henry asked, looking shocked. <br><br>“Yes, a cat! I want a cat!” <br><br>“So why don’t you just go and find a cat?” asked Henry, confused. <br><br>“Where’s the fun in THAT?” Victor asked, his grin infectious. “Look, I’ve been working in this for months! I’ve got everything finished, I just need a little help…” <br><br>Henry shook his head, but sat down at the table anyway. “Alright, fine, tell me what needs to be done.” <br><br>***<br><br>Victor’s maniacal laughter was wearing on Henry’s nerves. “Alright, Vic, that’s it. What now?” <br><br>Victor’s eyes lit up. “Bring me my electric eels!” he cried, his laughter only increasing. <br><br>With a sigh, Henry brought him the bucket of electric eels, which Victor then dumped into the vat that contained the inanimate cat. <br><br>Henry, having had a cat in the past, could have warned Victor about the side-effects of a cat waking up in a vat of fluid, would Victor have listened. <br><br>He didn’t listen, of course, and so, a few moments after the eels were introduced, was greeted with a face full of angry, wet cat. <br><br>Henry sighed, detached the cat from his friend’s face, and wrapped it up in a towel, attempting to dry the hissing feline. “You see, Vic, cats don’t like to be wet,” he said, handling the need-sharp creature with care. It was starting to calm down, a little bit, but still pointy and angry. <br><br>“I think I know that now,” said Victor, looking askance at the cat. <br><br>“Come here and pet it,” Henry said, holding the feline out to his friend. “And the next time you decide to make a cat, be sure you declaw it before you add life.” <br></p>

            <p><b>1. The Road to Lothlorien</b> by KounetsuDeb<br><i>With orcs behind them and the maze of forests ahead of them, the fellowship could use a guide. Luckly Haldir is there to guide their way, unless he&#39;s too distracted by the green-eyed wizard among them. boyboy implied.</i><br><br>Boromir shook his head. &quot;Orcs behind, the Witch of Lothlorien ahead... we could use a guide, Aragorn.&quot;<br><br>Aragorn looked uncomfortable. &quot;I am myself uncertain what course to take,&quot; he said. &quot;The last time I was here... it wasn&#39;t quite so, well...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maze-like?&quot; Gimli suggested. &quot;For all Elves are strange creatures, I wouldn&#39;t expect them to sculpt their whole forest into a labyrinth. Crazy lot.&quot;<br><br>Ahead, Legolas stiffened. &quot;You speak of the Lady of the Golden Wood,&quot; he reprimanded the dwarf. &quot;Show a little respect.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have to agree with Gimli,&quot; Boromir put in. &quot;The maze is a bit much.&quot;<br><br>Suddenly a voice called out from the single tree they were passing. Legolas smirked, and Aragorn let out a chuckle. &quot;What?&quot; Gimli demanded. &quot;What did he say? I know Elvish speech when I hear it.&quot;<br><br>It was Frodo who answered. &quot;I make it &#39;We may be crazy, but at least we&#39;re not lost,&#39;&quot; he said.<br><br>Gimli scowled at the tree. &quot;Come down here and say that, Elf,&quot; he snapped. &quot;My axe will-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Be useless, I rather suspect,&quot; Aragorn interrupted. &quot;I recognise your voice, Haldir of the Galadhrim. Come down and make our acquaintance.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What need have I of acquaintance, when I already know who you are?&quot; Haldir said, dropping lightly to the floor. &quot;Nine left Rivendell, and nine have come... uh.&quot; He stopped, blinked, and stared at the ninth member of the party. &quot;Who is that, and why is he glaring at me?&quot;<br><br>Aragorn glanced over his shoulder. &quot;Oh, <i>him</i>. We found him in Hollin -- it was very strange. Mithrandir called him a wizard, but he doesn&#39;t seem to speak Westron.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Or Sindarin, or Quenya, or Rohirric, or Adunaic, or the Black Speech,&quot; Sam muttered. &quot;Or Telerin, Silvan, any of the tongues of the Avari-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, thank you, Samwise,&quot; Aragorn cut him off. &quot;He seems to be rather jealous of Elves in general, though -- practically green-eyed with envy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Does he have a name?&quot; Haldir asked, still watching the &#39;wizard&#39; cautiously. Merry sniggered.<br><br>&quot;We don&#39;t know,&quot; the Hobbit said. &quot;We just call him Boybo-&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Haldir</i>,&quot; Aragorn cut in, trying to get the border guard&#39;s attention. &quot;Can you <i>please</i> help us make sense of this maze?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... what? Oh. Right.&quot; The elf shook his head and turned back to the Ranger. &quot;You&#39;re too far from Caras Galadhon to get there tonight, so if you&#39;ll come with me, there&#39;s some flets you can rest on...&quot;</p>

            <p>Okay. I have two cats, Numair, who is a dark gray tabby, and Maura, who is a light gray &quot;Bleachspot&quot; calico. Numi has white socks, is extremely affectionate, and we think that he was weaned too early, since he has the tendency to attempt to nurse my mothers and my ears. Maura is mostly light gray, with tan patches that look like she got in the way of someone going berserk with a bottle of bleach. She is slightly more aloof than Numi, for the most part, but will occasionally do something incredibly, stupidly affectionate. Since the death of our old queen, Maura&#39;s sort of take it upon herself to fill the absurdity vacuum left in the house. She also has the Greebo-esque tendency to try to catch deer... <br><br>Now, to CAF it up. <br><br>Iv got too kats, Numair (i naimed him after the charri lol!) and Moora. Nummi is silver with black stipes like a tieger, so i call him mie tieger kitteh. he is the sweatest kitteh in teh hole werld, and luvs me teh bestest of nybuddy ever. he has wite socks and will life 4 eva bcuz he is magical liek that. <br><br>Moora is a little kittin (shes only 2 yeers old) and she is silver to with pyoor wite patches liek woah. she is my gardian and she is kinda rood to other poepple, but she luves me alot. she is reely brave and will hunt and kill mooses evn!!!11! when our old kat dide, Moora tuke on her sole, so now she is too kats, and the old cat is reely wize and tells me thing like teh tiem she said that there was a fier so i had to go home. <br><br>... <br><br>I..

            <p>At the moment I have three cats: <a href="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y160/Purplefluffychainsaw/Random/2CelinaDorcas020505.jpg">Selina</a>, who is fat and black, and <a href="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y160/Purplefluffychainsaw/Random/Pepper1.jpg">Pepper</a> and <a href="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y160/Purplefluffychainsaw/Random/Bentley1.jpg">Bentley</a> (I was trying for Adam, but when mum offered Bentley instead I leapt on it) who are siblings.  Pepper is torteshell and Bentley is black and white, but both of them have white socks and bibs.  Selina&#39;s lazy, and has been on a diet pretty much since we got her, but Pepper and Bentley are as crazy as all kittens are and love sticking their noses in places they shouldn&#39;t, trying to eat my hair and using people&#39;s legs as scratching posts.  Also, none of them know how to miaow: Selina meeps, and the kittens mrr.<br><br>But CAFified...<br><br>i hav 3 cats that r like my guardien angles.  Celii is the oldest, and she is rly big, almost as big as a dog, and dark black lik my soul and since her son died protecting me form an evil monster she&#39;s been lik so depressedd but she still comes to sav me when I need her<br><br>Peregrin (I named her after the hobit!11) and Bently are kittens and r so kawii!  Peregrin is red and black, like flames, and bently is all black with white around his face that makes :3, but both of them have white socks.  They run arund all the time and let me now if theirs danger ahed.  They are brother and sister and they share thier power together!  I saved them from a men person who was abuzing them becoz I don&#39;t like 2 see anyone being hurt (see my history for more details!!)  <br><br>They all spek to me, but it&#39;s in a speshil code that no1 undrstands so that noone can over here us!</p>

            <p>I have two dogs, Lady and Monty. Lady is a pure black German Shepherd with a long coat, who quite frequently gets compared to a bear. Monty is a Rottweiler/Labrador (we think) cross breed, who was abandoned by his previous owners meaning that he ended up in the care of the RSPCA. They wrestle over who the boss is, but they never actually try to hurt each other. They usually act like big puppies, especially when food is around.<br><br>*engages Sueification machine*<br><br>I hav 2 kawaii doggies called Lady Midnight and Montezuma Black. Lady Midnight is pure black and is realy a wolf that can turn into a bare if she needs to. Montezuma Black is a puppy and he was going to be killed by some men because they wanted mean rottwielers and hes more liek a labrador, which is much cuter. Their both super loyal to me and if anyone trys to attack me then they hurt them until they run away. They&#39;re also really smart and can understand every word I say and even speak to me in they&#39;re own speshul barking code.</p>

            <p>Now, this is a tough one. My pet has blond hair and blue eyes, and he already does all sorts of useful things, like making me a cup of tea in the morning, and going to the shops for me, and hanging my washing out to dry, and making me more cups of tea, and he always makes me laugh. Which sounds a bit CAF-like as it is, except he&#39;s human, and he&#39;s technically a housemate rather than a pet. Nonetheless.<br><br>I have a pet monkey, and he is the most awesomest monkey in the whole world. He does everything I tell him to, because he&#39;s really really smart (except when it&#39;s funnier that he&#39;s silly). Sometimes my monkey lets me put him in a suit and he acts as a butler, and answers the door to let my amazing cool friends in, and he fixes us all drinks and stuff. They say money doesn&#39;t grow on trees, but that&#39;s a lie - it does, but only my amazing monkey knows where that tree is. He&#39;s also really sleek and cute with white hair and azure eyes, and all the girl-monkeys want his uber-kawaii monkey babies.<br><br>,,,<br><br>And now I feel slightly dirty.</p>

            <p>Okay, Murphy&#39;s a big fat sable-pattern ferret, with a bad case of hairless tail (something to do with his last moult going funny, the vet assures us it should grow back). He used to be a stray, and was in an unfortunate accident which, to put it bluntly, circumcised him, poor little guy. He&#39;s cute and huggable and I&#39;ve trained him to lick my nose on command (&quot;kiss!&quot; - awwww <sup>_<sup>)</sup></sup> but he has the disgusting habit of drinking his own urine, then trying to lick inside my nose and mouth, so I don&#39;t do that often.<br><br>Jinx is smaller, skinnier, and yellow. He doesn&#39;t do hugs as much, he&#39;s a wriggly little monster and he&#39;s always gotta be doing something. He still bites sometimes, but he has an excuse because he appears to have been neglected a bit as a kit. I haven&#39;t been able to train him to do anything except let go when I yell at him for biting me again.<br><br>*turn on Sueify machine*<br><br>Okay, after Sueification, Murphy&#39;s tail hair is back ... and he now has three of them, which he can spin around really fast to fly with like a helicopter. Instead of being different shades of brown, his fur is now raven black and snowy white (it actually physically hurt to type that). In place of his unfortunate injury from when he was a stray, he now has a dramatic battle scar on his shoulder, where it&#39;s clearly visible and a lot less embarrassing, from one of the many times he saved Sue-me&#39;s life. He now understands English perfectly rather than just obeying one command when he feels like it, and he no longer has his bad habit of drinking his own urine because I&#39;m pretty sure Cute Animal Friends don&#39;t excrete. (It&#39;s not &quot;cute&quot; to mess everywhere, and if they don&#39;t have to pass waste a Sue can keep them in her pocket/handbag/bra for as long as she wants.)<br><br>Jinx now has bright gold-coloured fur instead of pale yellow, and he understands English as well. Instead of merely being able to squeeze through most small gaps I don&#39;t want him to squeeze through, he now has the power to phase through solid walls. And rather than simply never having suffered any interesting injuries, he has magical regeneration powers! And teeth which can puncture solid steel! And super-speed! And ... argh, this is painful to imagine.</p>

            <p>I have a cat named Merlin, only he&#39;s living with my mom because the apartment here is really too small. Anyway, he&#39;s a platinum-mink Tonkinese, which is really impossible to accurately describe, so <a href="http://nueva-paz.deviantart.com/art/Merlin-2-110289875">here&#39;s a picture</a>--a friend of mine took it while catsitting. He&#39;s quite an intelligent cat, very people-friendly. He&#39;ll reach up your leg to be picked up like a little kid. However, he&#39;s a bit skittish, and he can be very mouthy when he thinks he needs something we&#39;re not giving him. Also, while he generally never bites or claws--and he has all of them--he would get angry at me for leaving for extended periods of time (like a weekend) and not be satisfied until he&#39;d taken it out on my arm. Just me, mind, no one else. {= P I maintain that he once deliberately spilled hot tea on me, too.<br><br>Now, while that&#39;s long-winded enough to be a CAF description, I can do better.<br><br>HI I have a kewl kitteh named Merlin, because he&#39;s part Kneazle and super-smart! He follows me around like a dog and protects me! His fur is totally silver and pale gold colored, and he has sapphire-emerald eyes (they&#39;re kinda both!)! Also he&#39;s part dragon, but he pretends to be a cat because its easier, but that&#39;s why he can telelport and fly and stuff. And he can talk! Kawaiiiiiii! <sup>____<sup><br><br>...</sup></sup> Yeah. &gt;.<br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Since so many people said they like Agent Derik, I don&#39;t mind sharing a couple of things he has already inspired. {= ) The first is a drawing of him and his partner outside their new Response Center. It should have been a nice group photo, but... well, <a href="http://neshomeh.deviantart.com/art/Response-Center-1110-133479763">there&#39;s a kender involved</a>.<br><br>The second is a playlist Barid put together back when I was still working on Gestalt Therapy. I added tracks 6 and 12, but otherwise it&#39;s just as he made it. It follows Derik from his origins in badfic all the way to his new posting in RC #1110. To know what&#39;s what, see the Notepad file that comes with the tracks. You should be able to download everything <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/havcr9szok">from here</a>. Let me know if it doesn&#39;t work.<br><br>Otherwise, enjoy. <sup>_<sup><br><br>~Neshomeh</sup></sup></p>

            <p>Like most of the people here, I love to write. However, because of this hobby, I have a writer&#39;s callus on my right-hand middle finger, where my writing tools are supported. So, I&#39;m just wondering if anyone else here has a writer&#39;s callus. (It&#39;s also a question to get my mind off of today&#39;s mood, if only for a little while.)</p>

            <p>I used to have a rather huge callus on my middle finger from writing; it hasn&#39;t come back for a year or so, though, probably because I&#39;m splitting my writing fairly equally between notebook and computer (or maybe it&#39;ll reappear in high school, who knows).</p>

            <p>I used to have one, back in school. Came from a combination of hand written work in classes, and a penchant for writing emo poetry which happily I grew out of by the age of eighteen.<br><br>Don&#39;t have it any more, however. I may have just spent three years doing a degree, but one could get away with taking very little by way of notes, and all work was typed (I&#39;ve a suspicion they won&#39;t actually accept hand written work), so throughout my university career, the writer&#39;s bump would reappear whenever I sat an exam and that was it.<br><br>Mine&#39;s not on the middle finger, though. (Middle&#39;s the longest one, right?) It&#39;s on the ring finger. Probably because I hold my pen weirdly, with the first two fingers and thumb on the pen, and the ring and little fingers tucked away.</p>

By using their greed for power, the dark lord changed them into his followers, doing his biding.”<br><br>“Why are they after us?” Sam asked.<br><br>“They are servants for <b>Saruman</b>. They are drawn to the evil that the ring carries.” He replied. “We must leave here.”&quot;<br><br><br>Seriously, what? Most badfic writers at least understand slightly better than that.</p>
