            <p>*pokes*<br><br>Welcome!<br><br>I see you got the Big Bag o&#39; Links. May I also direct your attention to the <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/">Lost Tales Archive</a>? It&#39;s under construction and likely to be for some time, but it&#39;s the place to read some PPC stuff you won&#39;t find anywhere else now that Geocities is gone. And there&#39;s more where that came from (read: on my hard drive until they&#39;ve been spiffed up a bit).<br><br>Good to meet another aspiring writer. However, as such, you might want to watch your capitalization (or lack thereof). It&#39;s important to the craft. {= )<br><br>What fandoms are you into?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>LotR will always be my first true love. I&#39;m not as knowledgeable as some about the finer points of Tolkien lore, but when it comes to the main canon (<i>The Hobbit</i>, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, and <i>The Silmarillion</i>) I know my stuff. And if I don&#39;t, I have reference books to help me. <sup>_~<br><br>After</sup> that, there&#39;s Farscape, HP, Dragonriders of Pern, Phantom of the Opera (Leroux and Kay for the most part; Webber&#39;s all right as long as it&#39;s not the movie), Jekyll &amp; Hyde (book and musical), Animorphs, and assorted other sci-fi and fantasy. Most recently I&#39;ve gotten into Temeraire and the new Battlestar Galactica, though I&#39;ve only read the first book and seen the first season, respectively.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I comes bearing links. *drags out Big Bag O&#39; Links and digs through it*<br><br>First off is the link to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">Wiki</a>, a veritable fount of information for a newbie to read through. Especially helpful for you if you want to write missions would be the page on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> (note the capital P).<br><br>I would advise against reading any <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>, unless you are of strong mind and stomach. Even the summaries have been known to give those of weaker constitution nightmares.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, not knowing what you have already managed to find, I have several links for you. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek) is a good place to start, as the PPC did many aeons ago. <s>What do you mean I&#39;m exaggerating?</s> <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">The Department of Geographical Aberrations</a> is another interesting place to visit, if you have the time and inclination. Also by hS is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/index.htm">Tangled Webs</a> site, which contains backstory for the PPC as an organisation. If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be. And last, but most definitely not least, <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/">Response Centre 45</a> is where Trojie and Pads&#39; missions are archived.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay here.

            <p>But marble is not that hard... you take a hammer and chisle to marble and marble loses.

And it&#39;s not marked AU. I don&#39;t know if this one&#39;s PPC-able as such, but it might make an MST. If anyone wants to try co-MSTing it, I&#39;m up for the challenge.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1563512/RattytheScourge"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1563512/RattytheScourge">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1563512/RattytheScourge</a></a><br>All this girls&#39; work needs looking at. I considered PPCing it, but A) she&#39;s a friend of a friend and B) I have no idea where to begin, because it&#39;s all Babelfished from Russian and I can&#39;t make out what&#39;s actually supposed to be going on. It contains fangirling of Cluny the Scourge who inexplicably does not kill the imaginatively-named Sue &quot;Ratty&quot;, and such hilarious lines as &quot;Bryony couldn t realize this moment, when she stoped feel anything. Only pang of scalding cold sharp her body and her heart contracted of painful spasm like thousand needles went into it. And then became frivolousness.&quot;<br><br>As for the RP thing, I recently posted in my LJ that I&#39;d been inspired by Chuck Palahniuk&#39;s book &quot;Haunted&quot;. As I said on LJ: <i>&quot;It&#39;s a collection of short stories, with a framing device involving nineteen people on a writer&#39;s retreat who end up getting trapped in the abandoned theatre they were staying in. Unfortunately, they all sabotage each others&#39; attempts to escape, hoping they can sell the story of their time in the theatre when they get out. They also destroy all the food, plumbing, and electricity in attempts to make it more dramatic, making their situation worse. The short stories in the book are the stories of the characters&#39; lives, which they tell each other to pass the time.<br><br>&quot;It occurs to me that a scenario like this would make for an awesome LJ roleplay game. Characters trapped in a situation, preferably via their own fault, with only a suitcase&#39;s worth of their most prized possessions each, slowly running out of food and other necessities ... Sadly it would be hard to RP, because it could only go on for so long before they either escaped or all died, and people would probably object to having their characters killed off one by one.&quot;</i><br><br>I did, however, get a comment from someone saying they think it would be possible to work it. According to them, &quot;maybe it could have ways so that people can still play once their characters have died. I was thinking ghosts, but that could get a little cliched. Or the players of deceased characters could control environmental factors. NPCs that anyone can play might make things interesting, but there would have to be a reason to not use them as meatshields to protect a beloved character...&quot; I think it could be done, but I don&#39;t know enough about LJ roleplaying to know how. Does anyone else have any ideas?</p>

            <p>... for that to bother me, and you&#39;re right, it&#39;s not impossible for there to be a Japan analogue (could have some fun exploring that in fic, except I know nothing about medieval Japan and all I know about modern Japan was picked up from anime and the webcomic Gai-Gin). But the hermaphrodites were kinda the fanfic equivalent of a punch in the face. Rather like the bit in Chaser Wolf&#39;s fic where Martin is completely unsurprised at the mention of a unicorn.</p>

            <p>The sad thing is it would have made a pretty good original fic, as weird furry fetish fics go, if they hadn&#39;t used Mossflower place names, or a reasonable Redwall fic if they&#39;d left out the random hermaphroditism. As it is, it just looks like someone tried to convert Mossflower to some kind of bad hentai, and the OFUR already does that with the Grimblett. (Sadly nobody will actually get tentacoo-waped by it, because that&#39;s going a tad too far even for us. Having everyone be disappointed when people they hate don&#39;t get tentacled is okay, though. Or maybe have it in a mission opening, we can get away with more there ...)</p>

            <p>Actually, to your point about Earth still being &quot;green&quot;-- nuh-uh. It ain&#39;t happening. There&#39;s a guide-book to the movie that just came out(20 freaking dollars, damnit...) that said that Earth was basically an over-crowded cesspit that was just barely liveable. Think one of the worst slums you can find on Earth, doesn&#39;t matter where, multiply it by ten, and then spread it all over the entire world. Wait....That does fit the Nar Shaddaa thing pretty well, doesn&#39;t it? Eh, who cares? The book was good, but damn expensive, more&#39;s the pity.<br>Yeah, I guess it is a Toruk. Heheh. I&#39;ve watched the movie twice already and plan to go a third time....*epic fail!* I suck.<br>The sad thing is, this once pristine, shiny new fandom sparkling with light has now been hit with a plague. Ye gads. Do suethors ever take a freaking vacation? Wait, no, don&#39;t answer that.<br>Travesty one: The Girl That Never Lived. *beats head against a wall* Oh god, make it stop. The main OC is Jake Sully&#39;s sister, which has no canon backing, has created her own Avatar body(in 3 to 4 months, when it takes about 6.9 years to make a full-grown one...that might explain something...), and her lack of description/story sense makes me sad.<br>Number Two: Pandora&#39;s Box. Why? Because the first person POV stinks, and the writing and some of the descriptions are horrible. Or it&#39;s just the lack of descriptions, except in the first paragraph where there&#39;s no pacing to speak of, and the only good descriptions are of the main antagonistic bastard and her stupid gengineered pet wolf. In the last two or three paragraphs of her first chapter, there&#39;s a description completely at odds with the entire freaking Avatar &#39;verse Earth. I&#39;m sorry, but there is *no freaking room* for a godsdamned ranch! AHHHHHH!<br>Excuse me for a moment. I have to got beat my head against a wall until the pain stops. I may be prejudiced against most authors, but these two stories deserve the mile long rant. Both of them just seem....horrible.<br>*walks off stage, muttering about tylenol and a large hammer*<br>-Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>I agree with you about the stories.  And no, as long as there are teeny-boppers, there will always be sue-fics.<br><br>But an observation.<br><br>Some have cited the existance of Dr. Augustine&#39;s cigarettes (tobacco and wood paper) as evidence of a plothole vis-a-vis the existance of Terran plantlife.<br><br>However...<br><br>This could be fixed by saying that Earth has basically fallen into neglect in comparison to the off-world, in-system colonies.  The oceans have been maintained somewhat to keep the oxygen cycle going, but most plantlife is now found on these self-same colonies (except for the &quot;breather&quot; algae and plankton in the oceans, of course).<br><br>However, due to the depression cited, even thesde steps may be flagging. <br><br>It may be Canon, but I just find it unbeleivable... if only for the fact that we as a species are too dang vain to let the earth become a city-world without it being maginally attractive (if horribly overcrowded in the style of Tokyo).<br><br>But that&#39;s just me.  I just don&#39;t like senseless dystopias... sensible ones, yes, but it&#39;s a quirk.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I guess you have good points. According to the book(it&#39;s formatted as an illegal, unauthorized guide to everything Pandora, with warnings about the RDA), Earth is slowly dying in a toxic sludge pit, and not just the ground, it&#39;s also the atmosphere. So, either the ozone layer has left the house completely(something that I kinda doubt), or there&#39;s just so many heavy metals and dangerous/toxic/unsafe chemicals in the air that it wouldn&#39;t make a difference either way. According to aforementioned book, the masks that the humans on Pandora were wearing are one step away from becoming standard wear on Earth, to go with crappy carb/you-don&#39;t-want-to-know-what-the-hell-it-is food supplements and like ten people to a room housing conditions. The only upside seems to be that basic gengineering, like getting your eyesight enhanced, or getting bioluminescent tattoos(very popular with the Pandora-lovers/tree hugger set) is fairly easy and a mainstream type thing.<br>It&#39;s actually fairly cool to think about that, but then these blasted teeny-boppers come along and ignore the rules set up by the canon&#39;s parent-figure for the universe. If I ever get my novel finished and published by Baen(I shoot for the moon, lol!), I&#39;m going to state that fanfiction for my work will result in instant legal action... Hmmmm. This is what the lack of caffeine and an all-night internet-trawling session has done to my coherency. I&#39;m going to log off now, before I *completely* loose my mind.<br>*wanders back off her soapbox, muttering about Nyquil and bed*<br>-Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>Its plot was a bit too &#39;aliens are better than you&#39;, but, a.) it&#39;s essentially a film about Native Americans being kicked off their land, so of course they&#39;re going to be shown in a better light, and b.) the plot is secondary to this movie&#39;s true goal, which was essentially to create an inhabited moon from scratch and show it off.

            <p>Hey there, all PPCers! We discovered a particularly godawful pair of LOTR fics a few months ago, starring a rather obnoxiously overpowered Sue named Talana Tathdel, and decided to spork them.

            <p>I&#39;m working on a mission and it suddenly occurred to me that I have read the badfic:<br>once to determine it was mission worthy;<br>a second time to write the mission;<br>a third time to make note of the charges I missed by skipping some of the scenes in the mission (to avoid it getting too long and boring).<br>(a fourth time when I decided that I should write the charges mentioned in mission not on the same list as the other charges, so I can distinguish between them when charging the Sue).<br><br>In all, I have read the badfic at least three or four times. Which, considering the number of &quot;if you&#39;d read this a second time you would have spotted this&quot; kind of errors makes me think is far more often than the badfic author. If she had read her story as often as I had, I would probably not have been reading it (at least not more than once).<br><br>----<br><br>Nough about that. I have a question too. What are the positions of boarders on charging Sues at the end of the mission with things that were mentioned in the badfic, but have not previously been mentioned in the mission?<br><br>For instance, I usually only charge the Sue with the things that I have mentioned in the mission were bad. I generally don&#39;t throw new things at them. (one time I did, and my beta pointed out that that charge had not been mentioned yet). But in this current mission there are quite a lot of things that have not been mentioned in the mission, but are chargeable things. Such as:<br>- referencing a season five event, while the fic should be set season three at the latest to avoid contradicting itself;<br>- A character -- that should know better -- claiming that arsenic killed almost instantaneously (as far as I have been able to find out: symptoms of arsenic poisoning are a lot like cholera symptoms, and that did not kill instantaneously. Unless, by that you mean slow and painfully);<br>- trying to shoe horn everyone into a relationship (in canon these people all broke up, so it would be the reverse of breaking up a canon pairing);<br>- excessive attention to detail of what female OCs are wearing.<br><br>These are but a few of the additional charges. Should I charge the Sue with these, or leave them out because I have not previously mentioned them in the mission?<br><br></p>

            <p>In my experience, charge lists can be incredibly boring, and I think there are two solutions: either seriously cut back on them, or cut back on commenting on the charges during the mission so that the charge list is something new. I think either way is valid as long as there are enough major charges in the charge list to justify the kill. It&#39;s not so important to get every little thing in there.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Well, I dunno about charging Sues, cos we don&#39;t do that in the DBS. But we exorcise for things that haven&#39;t previously been mentioned in the mission. We also pick up charges from bits of the fic we don&#39;t actually have our agents bother watching. This is generally explained by Agent Pads being impatient and reading ahead in the Words.</p>

            <p>Hello Anity, I see my fiction has been posted under Badfic Reports and Claims.

            <p>Luna is so out of character I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s still her; a non-canon fifth Hogwarts house for speshul people, which has no Head of House and no uniform; the fact that someone seemed to know Luna and her friends would go there before the Sorting Ceremony; a wand made out of silver and other Magical Mary-Sue Artifacts; a Cute Animal Friend (Othello the Miniature Eagle Owl); making dignified adults (i.e. Mr. Ollivander and Madam Hooch) faint at &quot;Luna&#39;s&quot; awesomeness; and of course the poor spelling, punctuation and grammar.<br><br>Those are just the ones I can remember off the top of my head.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s still not likely that someone like Ollivander, who&#39;s seen more strange things than most, would actually faint over something like that.

            <p>To quote the PPC&#39;s founders:<br><br>&quot;We love fanfic. Honestly, we do.<br><br>&quot;But changing the *main plotline* of the canon story is ridiculous. (Except in speculative AU &quot;what-if&quot; type stories.) And Mary Sues upstage the canonical main characters, which really should not happen. If you want to be the main character, try doing original fiction.&quot;<br><br>To rephrase, yes, fanfic is for exploring possibilities left open by the canon, but there&#39;s a right and a wrong way to do it. In general, good &quot;what-if&quot; or Alternate Universe fics take one point in the story and explore a singular alternative. &quot;What if Luna&#39;s mother hadn&#39;t died?&quot; &quot;What if there were five houses in Hogwarts?&quot; &quot;What if Luna had become Harry&#39;s best friend instead of Hermione?&quot; &quot;What if Luna was the one in the prophecy?&quot; Stuff like that. Once the writer asks a question like that (usually just one, since it&#39;s more difficult to write a believable AU the more things you change), their challenge is to answer it while also staying true to the spirit of the original canon, and that&#39;s where a lot of writers miss the mark and stray from legitimate AU or &quot;what-if&quot; fic into badfic.<br><br>To run with the Silvermoon fic as an example, there are things she could have improved to make it more believable as an AU. First and foremost, there&#39;s no escaping the fact that Luna is completely out of character. It&#39;s a big problem because we love Luna for her quirky personality and the weird things she says and does, and there&#39;s none of that in the fic. If the author didn&#39;t want to write about that Luna, she shouldn&#39;t have used her at all.<br><br>It&#39;s the same problem with Ollivander and Madam Hooch: that wasn&#39;t the wise, strange Ollivander I read about in Harry Potter; it was some flaky old guy with blood pressure issues. It wasn&#39;t the strict, competent Madam Hooch, either.<br><br>It&#39;s the same problem again with adding another house, especially the way she did it here. The writer claimed it was a new house, that it had no Head of House, and that the students didn&#39;t have to wear the Hogwarts uniform. That doesn&#39;t fit in the Hogwarts I know and love. It throws Hogwarts out of character, if you like. The new house has no history, no depth, and nothing to help it fit in with the canon: it exists simply because the author wanted to make her cast of characters stand out, which is something a good writer should be able to do without gimmicks.<br><br>Remember, the writer was attracted to Luna for some reason in the first place. Presumably Luna stood out to her for some reason; but in her fic, whatever that reason was is erased and ineffectively replaced with gimmicks and shiny baubles.<br><br>... That&#39;s a lot of text. I hope I&#39;m not stretching your patience too much; I&#39;m just trying to explain my standpoint and that of most people on this Board as completely as possible. Do you understand what I&#39;m getting at?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I suppose I do, but what  I am saying is that this is the writers &#39;imagination&#39;. Some might imagine Luna being that way, and some characters don&#39;t have a solid personality. There are plenty of open endings for us to fill in. Like ,for example, how we don&#39;t know if Luna was always the way she is, or how Madame Hooch behaves. In fact, to many, even coming up with a name of Luna’s mother can change the whole entire canon personality! The very definition of fanfiction is fiction written by fans of a TV series, movie, etc., using existing characters and situations to develop new plots. And to not all is it ridiculous. In fact, that is just an opinion. Some find it quite alright to change the main plot of the story.<br>Also, they might not in fact be doing so. If they are telling the story from a different point of view, why should they include what&#39;s going on in someone else’s life, if, in fact, they are focusing on another?<br>And who says there is a right or wrong way in fanfiction.The plot of a fanfic is supposed to be completely up to the author of said fanfic. And who said that what we see is the true personality of Luna. She is a fictional character. Yes in many she is just as real as anyone else, but is it right to give her a strict personality? There are many thing that are unexplained in her life that can leave to new possibilities, and possibly a whole new Luna.<br>And yes that may be the Hogwarts you know an love, but to others it is not. In fact, to some people it may be a spy organization!<br>Now do you understand where I am getting at?</p>

            <p>To be honest, I don&#39;t really understand your point of view. I don&#39;t understand how you can say there is no good or bad, no right or wrong, because I think a world without those things would be drab, lifeless, and boring. It excludes the possibility of the very good just as surely as it excludes the possibility of the very bad, and I just don&#39;t want to live in a world without the very good.<br><br>Some of the things you say are true; for example, the writer is entitled to her imagination, and the plot of a fanfic is completely up to its author. However, the writer is not entitled to everyone thinking the product of her imagination is a good read, and just because a fanfic author CAN write whatever they want, that doesn&#39;t mean that they executed it well, or that I have to like it.<br><br>I think we have a different concept of what &quot;canon&quot; means. To me, canon is to fiction as the laws of physics are to reality: you can&#39;t change them and expect the world to be right. Furthermore, the original author (the one whose name is on the books) is to canon as God is to the Bible. So, when you say Hogwarts might be a spy organization, I say, &quot;No, it isn&#39;t, because J. K. Rowling says so and she created the thing, so she should know.&quot; Same goes for the rest: J. K. Rowling made the Harry Potter characters the way they are, and since it&#39;s her world, she&#39;s the ultimate authority.<br><br>(For the record, I&#39;m not a very religious person, and I&#39;m especially not about to worship a work of fiction or its author. It&#39;s just an analogy.)<br><br>Anyway, if a fanfic writer wants to change things for the sake of imagination, I&#39;m fine with that. I just expect it to be done with regard to the canon and to have some kind of logical reason and explanation behind it in the fic. I call that well-executed. If a fic isn&#39;t well-executed, I call it a badfic and I&#39;m not going to take it seriously.<br><br>Closing thoughts: If you don&#39;t love Hogwarts and its people as they are in the books, how can you call yourself a fan of them? Isn&#39;t a fan someone who loves something?<br><br>~Neshomeh (who is going to bed now)</p>

            <p>Interesting conversation. For myself, I can see your point, in that fanfic is a work of fiction coming from the ficcer&#39;s imagination, and in that sense, there should be no limit to it. If you want to create a new character and call her &quot;Luna Lovegood&quot;, what&#39;s to stop you? That freedom is part of what&#39;s so awesome about writing.<br><br>However, even in the sphere of original fiction, there are restrictions on this freedom. Principally, the reader. A storyteller has to be able to pull the reader into the story. The reader has to feel that it&#39;s real, for the time that she is reading. That&#39;s hard to do if the reader can&#39;t suspend her sense of disbelief about the whole thing. That&#39;s why many readers of fanfic insist on things like characterization and setting consistent with canon. I hate to start reading a fanfic, expecting the characters and setting that I grew to love in the original, only to find a strange world populated with people I don&#39;t recognize. It breaks the spell. Of course, this doesn&#39;t bother everyone, any more than shoddy characterization and weak plotting bothers everyone who reads a book or watches a movie. But we don&#39;t lower our standards for them to the lowest common denominator.<br><br>But I have a question: You said you came here because you were &quot;interested.&quot; Interested in what? You may cite opinion, but the violations Neshomeh cited are standard for the PPC. They were decided upon way back when the PPC started, and we, as a community, have decided to work by them. They are not merely her opinion, but all of ours. So my question is, have you come here because you are interested in the PPC as a community and story-universe, or have you come here because you are interested in criticizing our standards for fanfiction?</p>

            <p>Hello again. {= )<br><br>As I was saying, a lot of the things I&#39;ve said are kinda the general consensus hereabouts. You might want to have a look at the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:For_Other_People">FAQ: For Other People</a> on our Wiki. Its tone is often snarky, but that&#39;s because we&#39;re used to dealing with people who aren&#39;t good sports and we get a little impatient. Please forgive us. It does, however, thoroughly answer the questions we&#39;ve encountered over the years.<br><br>As for WHY we have these opinions, let me try another analogy:<br><br>Many, many people have compared writing to giving birth, and one famous male author (whose name I cannot for the life of me come up with) said something to the effect that writing is the closest men can come to bearing a child. So, consider that an author&#39;s work is like their child; their characters are their children. Lots of authors are good enough to let other aspiring authors play with their children, because they know it&#39;s a good way for the aspiring authors to learn. That&#39;s fanfic.<br><br>Now, is it right for the fanfic writers to do anything they can think of to someone else&#39;s children just because they can? Is it right to ignore the way the child was brought up and to try to force them to become something else, whether it&#39;s right for them or not? I don&#39;t think so. Some authors don&#39;t think so, either--that&#39;s why they don&#39;t allow fanfic of their works. The ones that do are trusting us to play nicely with their children, and as an aspiring author myself, I respect that.<br><br>So, that&#39;s why I feel the way I do. It&#39;s a matter of respect for the original author, whose pure creative genius created the world they&#39;re graciously allowing us to play in. Their house, their rules; have fun, but don&#39;t break anything; and so forth.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>...a canon that has been sort of &#39;absorbed&#39; by another?<br><br>I&#39;ll explain what I mean. Let&#39;s say we have two canons. Initially, they&#39;re completely independent of each other. They&#39;re connected in some way, but they don&#39;t interact at all. Then, suddenly, a retcon in one establishes that the other is canon to the first one. The two canons are now... sort of... canon to each other.<br><br>Baseline example: Castlevania. Initially, it was a series about Dracula, yes, but Dracula is a public domain character. Then, along comes Bloodlines, which establishes that the &#39;real&#39; Dracula story (the Stoker novel) is now part of the Castlevania story.<br><br>Does this make the two one canon? Would the PPC treat it as such? Could a copy of the book be used to exorcise a Castlevania fic?<br><br>Now, this is a fairly rare phenomenon, and I don&#39;t think the PPC has encountered it yet. I just thought it would be best to be prepared in case we do.</p>

            <p>I think they&#39;d be treated as separate except in cases where the connection between them is relevant.<br><br>So a Dracula badfic obviously wouldn&#39;t benefit at all from a copy of one of the video games, but a Castlavania badfic might from a copy of the book. However, I&#39;d say that in the latter case, it&#39;d probably not be very effective unless the fic specifically violated the part of Castlevania canon that&#39;s supposed to be covered by Dracula.<br><br>I guess. &gt;.<br> </p>

            <p>I think that the Dracula story is the Canon.  Castlevania is an offshoot of the Dracula legend, like the branch of a tree.  In this case, it seems more like the offshoot is trying to become more true to the original Canon.<br><br>To sum up, they are both Canon, but I would call Castlevania a child-Canon to Stoker&#39;s parent-Canon.  The good news is that you can definitely use a copy of the book to exorcise a Castlevania fic.<br><br>I think that if you have two canons that are connected, with or without actual interaction, then they are actually part of the same root canon.  That canon may not have a name, but I think it still exists.</p>

            <p>a) Anyone can edit the Wiki, so yes, you&#39;re allowed to. However, I&#39;d also point out that it isn&#39;t necessary to make an article for every badfic, no matter how horrendous. There will always be more, and the Wiki is for PPC stuff, not badfic. So, badfics should either be related to missions or particularly notorious. Also, make sure you follow the formatting of the Wiki.<br><br>b) Links to other articles are formed like this: [[Name of Article]] or this: [[Name of Article|text]]<br><br>b.1) External links go like this: [URL.tag] or this: [URL.tag Text]<br><br>c) I think the spoiler warning tag is: {{spoiler}} I&#39;d check that by looking at the Wiki markup for pages with the warning on it.

            <p>Trust me. This is *worse* than C*l*br**n. Read at least three chapters into the &quot;It is the voice of a Noldo&quot; fic line, and you will, in all likelihood, take a running jump out the nearest window in an attempt to get rid of all the body horror and....pr0n that appears. Poor Elladan and Elrohir...Poor Legolas... My heart weeps for canon. *&quot;Going Home&quot; begins to play in the background.* Trust me. It&#39;s that horrible. It NEEDS the article--there are at least 1500 missions, without going into the storylines, for agents. But, if the chapters are broken down by line, there&#39;s only 600 missions of horrendous, brain-searing, mind melting horror to endure. Some of it attempts to revert back to canon, and then someone like Esteliel, Gabby(i?) or talics pops up and the story goes to hell again. <br>*begins beating head against the wall, and reaches for her older sister&#39;s bottle of tylenol and a large hammer.* Excuse me while I go purge my mind.<br>Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>You asked a question, you were given an answer; no one&#39;s holding it against you. Believe me, we actually have to say that sort of thing a lot. Actually, the only thing you&#39;ve done that might tick people off, as far as I can see, is the excessive use of exclamation marks and CAPS LOCK SYNDROME. So please don&#39;t grovel; there&#39;s no need to sound like a badfic writer ;p<br><br>That said, yes, it sounds horrible. I don&#39;t think I even want to touch it, let alone read it.

Did I mention that they won&#39;t delete chapters, and that their are multiple oppotunities on some threads to write a PPC mission for this...?<br>*There&#39;s another one.* It could be even worse than the first one.  <a href="http://www.esteliel.de/cgi-bin/3/story.pl?next=1&amp;chapter=0"><a href="http://www.esteliel.de/cgi-bin/3/story.pl?next=1&amp;amp;chapter=0">http://www.esteliel.de/cgi-bin/3/story.pl?next=1&amp;amp;chapter=0</a></a> It&#39;s a War of the Ring interactive...horror, shall we say? The link is for the first chapter, and the results of it can be just as horrifying. There are, at last count thankfully only 316 chapters of brainmelting horror--although some of them are pretty good with the coherency and an attempt for plots... <br>If you like Denethor or Thranduil, or pretty much any of the canon characters, don&#39;t read unless you&#39;ve got an entire case of Bleepka to yourself.<br>--The horror-<br>Honu_Wahine</p>

Not before I&#39;ve been here for a month. I&#39;ve heard you guys are &quot;Quirky&quot;, but considering that my normal thought process is &quot;Maths sounds a lot like Mats. Hey, I haven&#39;t talked to Matthew in a while&quot; I think I&#39;ll fit in fine.<br><br>I&#39;m also throwing around an idea for a new department in my head. Thought that you guys might be interested. Most departments are about killing sues, or removing author-wraiths, or helping someone else do one of those things. My new idea for a department is about capturing unique sues and testing out their strange abilities. For example, Sue A is underwater for a ridiculously long time in her story, so we see how long she can hold her breath, then throw her in a vacuum and see how well she does in there. &gt;:D<br><br>I&#39;ve read the original series and most of the spinoffs on Miss Cam&#39;s site.<br><br>And- Woah, long winded introduction.

            <p>*tosses a P-90 at you* Hm. What you propose sounds very much like the Department of Mary Sue Experiments &amp; Research. More information on that on the Wiki.<br><br>I comes bearing links. *drags out Big Bag O&#39; Links and digs through it*<br><br>First off is the link to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">Wiki</a>, a veritable fount of information for a newbie to read through. Especially helpful for you if you want to write missions would be the page on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> (note the capital P).<br><br>I would advise against reading any <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>, unless you are of strong mind and stomach. Even the summaries have been known to give those of weaker constitution nightmares.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, not knowing what you have already managed to find, I have several links for you. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek) is a good place to start, as the PPC did many aeons ago. <s>What do you mean I&#39;m exaggerating?</s> <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">The Department of Geographical Aberrations</a> is another interesting place to visit, if you have the time and inclination. Also by hS is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/index.htm">Tangled Webs</a> site, which contains backstory for the PPC as an organisation. If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be. And last, but most definitely not least, <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/">Response Centre 45</a> is where Trojie and Pads&#39; missions are archived.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay here.

            <p>I sorta started writing a base for the first mission that I might undertake, and a question about disposal methods popped up.

Am I allowed to do that, or is it considered cruel and unusual punishment, even by PPC standards?<br>And one last thing--I probably shouldn&#39;t be writing missions just yet, but hey, be prepared, huh?<br> --3 days till my head goes boom(If they f--- with &quot;Avatar&quot; I&#39;ll kill them!)--Honu_Wahine</p>

I do think more non-assassin agents would be a good thing, everyone seems to concentrate on the &quot;blowing stuff up&quot; aspect and not the HQ work (obviously the blowing-up-stuff is easier to make fun, but the HQ stuff is worth a try). She needs a makeover to make her look less like Sakura in aspects other than the rabbit ears, so we&#39;ll have to work on that.</p>

            <pre><code> Greetings, salutations, and….yada, yada, yada. I guess one could get the idea. My name is Honu_Wahine, I just joined the PPC wiki, in the hopes that by January, I can become an agent to give a—dare I even think that thought—\*writer\* the (in the words of General Tirathon) horsewhipping that the author so clearly deserves.&lt;br&gt;     Ummmm… That wasn’t out of line for a first post on the message board, was it? I’ve been reading a thousand or so word review by the great Tirathon, and wondered “Why hasn’t this troll gotten the hint and stopped writing in this fandom?” I managed to compile a pretty good charge list, and hope that I can get permission to kill all four—four!—of these fics myself. Sadly—agents = month long probation on the boards before being considered as an agent.&lt;br&gt;     I really should stop doing this where the author can’t find me (mainly cause this ain’t even my normal penname), but I can’t. This travesty must be stopped—I am begging you, PLEASE! fanfiction.net/s/5537621/1 is the home URL of this travesty, er….story! Yeah, that’s what I meant, the story! &lt;br&gt;     The abomination called “An American Colonel name Hogan,” if anyone really cared...and there are three more by pink kommandant that are just as bad. \*whimpers\* &lt;br&gt;     \*Begins beating head against the surprisingly heavy industrial-sized sander.\* If this post is out of line with the ranting, and not enough of the introductions, feel free to remove it…or just laugh at me. I don’t really care which.&lt;br&gt;--Honu_Wahine, a desperate former suethor

            <p>Hi, KillerPiplup. Are you introducing yourself to the PPC in hopes of becoming an agent?<br>If so, there&#39;s a handy button at the top of the section where the newest thread post is, that says &quot;Start new thread.&quot; It&#39;s really convenient for keeping threads from getting turned into free-for-alls or flamefests when somebody says something not related to the particular thread--course, this *is* the PPC, so that might be common. Meh, who cares?<br>But, this is, or was, my introduction thread. Nice meeting you anyways. Here&#39;s a handydandy bucket to deposti your sanity in next time you come on to the boards--don&#39;t worry, the Worg&#39;s won&#39;t eat it all...<br><br>--Honu_Wahine, Agent-candidate Hopeful</p>

First, there&#39;s his wife--who, if written correctly and well could be called proper fanon--who is, for some reason, in a non-Coed POW camp. She also has one kid, according to one of those travesties. Oh, and did I mention that Hogan is Patton&#39;s son, and that Patton visits a *German Stalag* regularly? So, that&#39;s Hogan who&#39;s been replaced, as well as one of WWII&#39;s greatest generals. Shall I continue, or have you seen enough to go after this girl?<br>Lastly, this...author-person is 13 freaking years old. Okay, not a bad thing, some 13-year-old&#39;s can be good authors--and claims to be a *fan* of Hogan&#39;s Heroes, when she doesn&#39;t even seem to grasp the ...ing concept.<br>I&#39;m sorry, was that last line a little too vicious?

            <p>Thanks. I now have an almost complete set of armor, and plenty of weaponry (plus a cool sticker!), to be used when I finally beg for permission. The shield is *awesome*!<br>Hogan&#39;s Heroes--A brief rundown: A 60s sitcom set in a WWII Luftwaffe POW camp. The Allied prisoners run rings around the Germans, aided(unknowingly) by the Sergeant of the Guard, Schultz, and Kommandant Klink. Much speculation and an almost-flamefest free-for-all break out occasionally over the identity of Nimrod. It&#39;s good for a larf or two. *grins manaically* If you want a really funny story, and proof of my insanity(not that anyone ever needed it...) check out the multi-chapter author!insert story, &quot;The Mary-Sue Experiments.&quot; I won a great award for &quot;Best Development of a Character Voice.&quot; I&#39;m so proud.<br>-HW</p>

            <p>Hi IndeeMaat! It&#39;s me, IronAmerica! Yeah, I kinda got that-but seriously, some of Tir&#39;s extended reviews count as PPC missions all on their own...

            <p>It took a moment before I recalled your name (I&#39;m not really involved in the Hogan&#39;s Heroes fandom), but then I remembered seeing it on Tir&#39;s forum.<br><br>Yes, Tir&#39;s extended reviews are great. I also love that they stir up discussion among other fans. I&#39;ve tried to set up a similar forum in Torchwood, but not many takers on discussion there.<br><br>Great to hear that you have taken on board the comments on your story and take improving your writing seriously. Many (most) PPC authors have written a Mary Sue story at some point in time (usually one of their first attempts at fic writing), so as a former Suethor you are not alone.<br><br>How is the Sue situation in Hogan&#39;s Heroes?

Writing that seems really strange<br>     - Escape on the Menu, Sparkshaven-- I really couldn&#39;t read this. The lack of research and writing skill, the American *woman* flying *COMBAT!!!* *curls up in a corner, jibbering madly*<br>     - The author Hippiechick. Her stories are good, and surprisingly well-written, but the OCs don&#39;t really need to be there. Just rewrite them a little, and you&#39;ve got a nice in-canon story, m&#39;kay? I just don&#39;t like the strange, sort-of out of place OC in there, but that&#39;s just me, I guess...<br><br>Well...Like I said, most of it&#39;s just annoying, or the roles that the OC takes(hippiechick!) could easily be filled by canon characters, even the bit ones, like Olsen, or dear Sergeant Joe Wilson--who appeared but briefly, but has since taken on a life of his own.<br>Thankfully, we have people like Tir(WHO REALLY NEEDS TO FREAKING UPDATE!!!!), Hubbles, GSJ, and most of the authors on there. A really cool slash series is on their that&#39;s worth a look, and actually does a good job of explaining away the slashiness of it all. Ah well. The situations mostly under control. It&#39;s just the ones that have cropped up since Tir decided to quit life on the boards and give us such wonderful things as the &quot;car mechanic analogy&quot; and wonderfully hillarious extended reviews.

            <p>Replacement-Canon characters who are so totally warped as to no longer resemble their original selves - in other words, are new characters that just happen to have the name and face of the canon in question - are qualified as kill-worthy by the DMS. However, you have to remember to find the real canon character before leaving the fic; they&#39;ll probably be stashed away in a plothole somewhere nearby. Go and read a few DMS fics, or read around on the wiki for a while, and you&#39;ll get a clearer idea :)</p>

If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be. And last, but most definitely not least, <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/">Response Centre 45</a> is where Trojie and Pads&#39; missions are archived.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay here.

It&#39;s not exactly lost, but there are a couple of discrepancies between what was on the Oddlots site and what&#39;s on Miss Cam&#39;s site--namely, Oddlots was missing &quot;No Way Back&quot; and Miss Cam is missing &quot;The Dark Elf.&quot; So, it might be nice to have a complete archive, and it&#39;s always good to have a backup in any case.<br><br>Third... I&#39;ve been over and over the question of cleaning up the Original Series for a long time. Thus far I&#39;ve restrained my inner editor because, as July wisely pointed out, the OS isn&#39;t mine to edit. And yet, I can&#39;t help but feel that it would be nice to fix the minor little things, like missing dots in ellipses and stuff like that. Also, if I do archive it, it&#39;ll be in my archive. More than that, it will be in the PPC&#39;s archive, because the site belongs to all of us. So... what do we all think?<br><br>To reiterate:<br><br>Archive the OS = Yes/No?<br><br>Edit the OS for spelling &amp; punctuation = Yes/No?<br><br><s>Neshomeh is awesome = Yes/Yes?</s><br><br>In all seriousness, it&#39;s important that everyone have a say in this, so please take a moment to respond. Even if you&#39;re a lurker. Even if you just joined. This is our Canon we&#39;re talking about, after all.<br><br>Also, I remind you that this project is open to everyone, so if you want to help with the HTML--just looking over things for broken code, links that don&#39;t work, things that look wrong, etc. would be very helpful--please, please step up.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Mainly what I need are extra eyes to look things over and make sure I haven&#39;t missed anything--which I do, frequently; e.g. there&#39;s at least one broken link in the SIELU complex, and I don&#39;t remember where it is. I just remember spotting one while browsing where I&#39;d typed &quot;SIELE&quot; instead of SIELU. &gt;.<br>Re. apocrypha: I didn&#39;t know, either, until a couple of days ago. I came across a link to &quot;Gemini Stone&quot; on the Wiki, and since it was on Odd Lots, I was going to fix the link to point to the same story on Miss Cam&#39;s site. Only it has a different title (&quot;Broken Doll&quot;) and a different number there.

            <p>Making your connection cry. I am aware of the issue, and I mean to try various things and see if I can&#39;t get the file sizes down without actually reducing the visibility.

            <p>This is the third time I&#39;ve had a beloved canon that&#39;s been woefully in need of editing.<br><br>BagEnders was <i>awesome</i>, but it has some technical errors and the odd hiccup that a beta would have caught. The Shoebox Project is awesome, but same again plus a couple of Americanisms. I like being a fan of such things, but I&#39;d rather be a fan of something that&#39;s clearly had a beta and been edited to standard English standards. I feel it reflects on all of us badly when we try to be a community that upholds all standards of good writing, yet our canon material fails in any way on that front. So my vote would be yes, clean up the OS, if you&#39;re archiving it on your own site.<br><br>Also, yes, might as well archive it. Who knows when it may disappear? It&#39;d be handy to have the record. If someone ever had the space, it&#39;d be awesome to have <i>all</i> PPC missions on one site, but that&#39;s just a pipe dream, I fear.<br><br><s>Yes, Neshomeh is awesome.</s></p>
