It&#39;s a bad idea, all right?<br>- Plus if they find you you&#39;ll have someone &#39;trained to kill from birth&#39; and his protectively homicidal warlock manservant after you.<br><br>I must not refer to Uther as &#39;King Giles&#39;.<br><br>Swords are to be held in the hand during use, not thrown. They are not aerodynamically suited to being projectile weaponry.

            <p>Redwall&#39;s one of what you might call my secondary fandoms, but that was a pretty horrible fic. Poor Kieran. By the way one of the other people he might meet in the Nursery is Galeya Telcontar, a non-canonical daughter of Aragorn and Arwen whom I rescued last year. She&#39;s nearly six.

            <p>You see, I discovered the anime series, Baccano!, a few weeks ago. Natually, I searched for fanfic, and I found this:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4405692/4/One_Hell_of_a_Ruckus"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4405692/4/One_Hell_of_a_Ruckus">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4405692/4/One_Hell_of_a_Ruckus</a></a><br><br>Problem is, this fic is also a crossover between two other series, Gunslinger Girl and Black Lagoon, which I have yet to watch (I&#39;m still at Vision of Escaflowne, and am planning to move on to Code Geass). Therefore, I can&#39;t asses it&#39;s quality. Can you tell me if this is good?</p>

            <p>Every now and again, story ideas get buried in the depths of my mind due to lack of time to write them or them being just plain rubbish. Occasionally, they’ll make a return at some point with a few new ideas. One of them, a <i>Harry Potter</i>/<i>Lord of the Rings</i> crossover, just made its third attempt at resurgence, with a flood of new ideas. The last time it raised its ugly head, I shot it in the face for the first chapter alone (in which Harry was almost certainly OOC). This time, it’s wised up to my strategy for headshotting and come up with a way to avoid the OOC Harry and a way to integrate him into the LotR world relatively seamlessly. Here’s where my question comes in. While I’m looking for your views on the basics of the plotline, there’s a specific aspect of it that I want to know about to discover if I need to bury the fic again:<br><br>Harry dies fighting Voldemort (though taking Voldemort with him) after having fought the Dark Lord for about five years after DH. He wakes up at or near Esgaroth/Erebor about five, maybe six hundred years before the War of the Ring, with no memory of who or where he is, only remembering his name. Exploring, he encounters the local population (probably Esgaroth as I feel I could write humans far better than dwarves) and manages to communicate with them (as time goes on, he grows more and more fluent in most of the LotR languages). It’s about this time he discovers that he’s an elf.<br><br>At which point, my conscious mind went ‘Wait, <i>what?</i>’ until my brain decided to explain a bit more of the plot to me. It’s dripfed throughout the fic, but I’ll give an infodump here. Harry was an elf first. Let’s call him… Glorgathon, because I have no name for him currently and can’t be bothered to find a proper Elvish example name that hasn’t already been used by Tolkien. Glorgathon died in the War of the Last Alliance, possibly just before the end. I only have a ridiculously basic grasp of the Elven afterlife and I’m probably getting everyone’s names and roles wrong, so don’t kill me if I horribly screw it up now. The Valar (the sort of second-in-command gods, right?) are aware of Voldemort (possibly because the Valar exist in both worlds or maybe the act of creating a Horcrux was so horrific that they became aware of Voldemort) and want someone to sort the guy out. Glorgathon agrees and they send him in the form of Harry Potter. After Harry’s death, Glorgathon is brought back to the Halls of Mandos (?) and given a gold star and a fruit basket before being kicked into Middle-Earth. At first, he has no memory of anything that’s happened to him in either world, but as time passes, he eventually pieces together memories and works out what happened.<br><br>Anyway, Harry/Glorgathon (we’ll call him Harry, though) is led to Mirkwood (I’m guessing my subconscious chose Mirkwood simply as a probably misguided attempt to be different from the Suethors who choose Lothlorien or Rivendell for their Sues) and is recognised by the elves he meets, though he can’t say the same of them (you’ll really have to forgive me here. I have no clue how the resurrection part of Elven afterlife works. Do they randomly appear as adults or are they born and raised like any elf child until they reach a certain age where they say, “By the way, I’m Glorgathon” or is there another method?). This lack of remembrance causes chaos when it turns out that he’s married to… umm… Glorgatha the elf. After that, cue life in Mirkwood as he tries to figure out what happened to him, try to cope with having a wife he can’t remember and Sauron rearing his probably ugly head in the East once again. At some point, Glorgatha dies when she… err… ingests rat poison (*shrugs* haven’t figured out her death yet). Now, I’m vaguely, <i>vaguely</i> (lots of emphasis on the ‘vaguely’) aware of Finwe and Miriel (anyone care to explain properly?). Could the same thing possibly happen here? Because my brain is currently demanding that he have a human love interest in Minas Tirith/Edoras around the time of the War of the Ring. This is the main question I’m asking, by the way.<br><br>When the war does begin, Harry volunteers to represent the elves, but Legolas is chosen instead. Therefore, Harry only encounters the Fellowship every once in a while (Helm’s Deep and Minas Tirith, probably). There are two things I can do here; a) have him choose to defend Minas Tirith (and get injured while doing so, meaning he’s not at the Black Gate) or b) choose to defend the Mirkwood and Erebor et cetera from Dol Guldor, but I have no idea of the specifics of those battles (I somehow doubt that <i>Battle for Middle-Earth II</i> is reliable) or even if it’d fit Harry’s character to be that far away from the battles that would actually bring about Sauron’s downfall.<br><br>After that, stuff happens. Probably Harry healing, marrying his love interest, having two point four children and then leaving Middle-Earth soon after she dies.<br><br>So yeah, what do you think? I’m guessing (and kind of hoping, given my current workload) that you’re going to tell me not to ever write this under pain of pain. If I did, I’d obviously come here for beta readers, but it all depends on your reaction. So?</p>

            <p>Well, that is most likely an Improbable Crossover, but it could work if you are <b><u>really</u></b> careful.  I agree with the idea of keeping the Love Interest alive and him learning to live with her.  If Harry is going to be an elf, please still give him weaknesses and dear Eru, don&#39;t even dream of having him learn weapons or languages in weeks, or even in months. *stabs The Inheiritance Cycle*  They take years to get really good at.  Harry would probably be really unhappy about not being part of the Fellowship, and dear Eru, no Tenth Walker to get around that.  If you can figure a way to get him to the battles with Sauron, more power to you.  I personally can&#39;t right now.  Good luck and may the typo demons avoid you.</p>

            <p>He takes less time than usual to learn weapons, but not due to being Eragon. He learns languages and the basics of weaponry skills as he unlocks more of Glorgathon&#39;s memories, but he still requires training for a long time to truly master either.<br><br>As for Tenth Walker, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m aware of how much that deserves to join the fate of the Ring. Basically, Harry was just going to hear rumours and hop around from place to place getting caught up in battles (or just happens to be staying in a certain spot when stuff happens). For example, if the human love interest gets kept, Harry might go to Minas Tirith and say goodbye to her as the civilians all run off, then he might stick around with the soldiers.<br><br>And is there any crossover that truly works? Surely every fandom contradicts every other fandom in some way?</p>

            <p>What about turning the HP universe into a second &#39;province&#39; of Ea(can&#39;t add the double dots, sorry), in which access to the Music of the Ainur was more open to humanity (and possibly elvenkind). You can then make the spell system used by wizards a degraded version of it (using latin, and whtever tounges percieved as high). Then, turn Harry/Glorgathon&#39;s mission into the reintroduction of the &#39;true music&#39;, which is love (already his post powerful exsisting power). Just my two cents! </p>

            <p>Knew I&#39;d forgotten to mention something. The HP magic is a wild card at the moment. It flickers on and off. I don&#39;t want it to happen randomly, because that&#39;ll be rubbish.

Also Winston&#39;s first exorcism, and the debut of Chliever&#39;s brothers-in-law, who will appear from here on. Sorry if I stepped on anybody&#39;s toes with all the cameos in the cafeteria scene, by the way.<br><br>Mission #4 - Poor Eponine (<a href="http://agent-chliever.livejournal.com/2327.html#cutid1"><a href="http://agent-chliever.livejournal.com/2327.html#cutid1">http://agent-chliever.livejournal.com/2327.html#cutid1</a></a>). NSFB. Les Miserables torture porn? Say it ain&#39;t so, Jim! Alas, it is, and it falls to our Agents to sort it out and get everyone&#39;s favorite street wench away from hardened criminals such as Harold Grumbled. Ever see a god of pestilence get sick on the job? It&#39;s not pretty. Also Winston&#39;s first direct kill.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll be able to read these in more detail when my connection at home is back up, but I thought I should say I like it so far.

            <p>Kh&#39;orr&#39;ak&#39;t&#39;ann was actually a character created by myself and a friend when we were younger. He was sort of a comedic character, who could only manage to assimilate worlds for the Tyranids by accident. We&#39;ve long since outgrown him, but I liked him a lot so I signed him up with the PPC. We never put him to paper, or even considered doing so, so he sort of exists somewhere between a semi-fic blip and entirely imaginary (see: Louise). I also wanted to use Schlect (who was recruited on Jay&#39;s last mission and hasn&#39;t been seen since), so I threw in someone big and scary-looking for him to utterly dominate.<br><br>As to how he functions, Mission 3 gives a clue.

            <p>I answer that with my own question. How did Sues become so common? Because all these authors are too busy [unsure if I&#39;d get into trouble if I post this word] over their supreme author skillz to notice that the only thing they should be writing is their signature on a court order forbidding them to come within fifty metres of a keyboard.</p>

            <p>&quot;As usual&quot;? That&#39;s quite a compliment, m&#39;dear. *bows* Thank you. And it was just a nitpick. It really is sad that so many badfic writers are unaware of how terrible they are...<br><br>Though really, it&#39;s harder than most of us make out. Last week I spent six hours writing a cold draft of a chapter, and when I read it over two days later, I hated it. Things seem so, so, SO much better as you write, because you&#39;re seeing the story in your head without cumbersome words getting in the way. I&#39;m not excusing all those thousands of badfics - the authors should have stopped, read them over later, redrafted, edited, and so on - but it&#39;s all too easy to see how it happens. :(</p>

            <p>I’m looking for betas for two short fics. The first fic is a <i>28 Days Later</i> oneshot (<i>’28 Seconds Later’</i>), though it, confusingly, has two chapters (the second being the original version of the story before I decided to rewrite it and existing merely for comparison purposes). It has a bit of gore in, but I’m thinking that I’ll probably put it as a T rating on FF.net or maybe, if I really, really push it, a K+ rating. There are eight pages in total.<br><br>The second story is a <i>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</i> oneshot set around Revan’s apparent death (<i>‘Malak’s Betrayal’</i>). I’m mainly looking for a simple spelling and grammar check as, to my knowledge, the Canon is perfectly intact, but if I’ve made any horrible mistakes, I’d be grateful to know about them. It’ll probably fit into K+ or T ratings. There are four pages in total. If you think the title’s too plain, any help would be appreciated on that front too.<br><br>Thanks in advance,<br>Jade</p>

            <p>Now, my knowledge of genetics is rusty, I know, but wouldn&#39;t it also be possible for there to be a disease for which the relevant immunity-gene, as it were, is only on the X chromosome and requires two copies to successfully defend against said disease? Then you&#39;d get gender-specific illnesses too.<br><br>I suppose it&#39;s also possible there could be something on the Y chromosome giving an immunity to some disease or other, meaning only women would be affected, but this seems less likely. I just can&#39;t quite articulate why, as I&#39;m half asleep.<br><br>Of course, if we&#39;re meaning diseases as in hereditary ones, it gets a lot easier to explain. The only infectious disease I can think of that&#39;s markedly different between genders is some sexually transmitted diseases, which eg have lots of lovely oozy symptoms in women, but go totally unnoticed in men. Not sure why that&#39;s the case though, so can&#39;t formulate any principles based on it.</p>

            <p>Genetic illnesses can be coded for either on the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) in which case if you&#39;re unlucky enough to have one (in the case of a dominant) or both (in the case of a recessive) chromosomes carry the thing, then you have it, regardless of gender.<br><br>If the gene is carried on the X chromosome and you are a girl, then you have two options. If it is a recessive allele you need both of your X chromosomes to have a copy of it before you will show the disease. Otherwise you are a &#39;carrier&#39; but not a sufferer. If it is a dominant allele, having just one copy is enough. You will have the disease.<br><br>If it is carried on the X chromosome and you are a male, then you will have the disease, because there is not a corresponding &#39;slot&#39; on the Y chromosme to mask it in the case of a recessive (in the case of a dominant, well, you only need one copy to have the disease).<br><br>This pattern also follows for non-disease-y traits that are carried on the X chromosome. If a gene is carried on the X chromosomes it is termed X-linked.<br><br>If the gene is carried on the Y chromosome exclusively, then only males can get it. Very few diseases are carried this way - the Y chromosome is very small. Traits carried on the Y chromosome are termed Y-linked.</p>

            <p>You can&#39;t entirely separate airborne diseases from genetics though - without genetics you wouldn&#39;t have a body for the disease to attack. Plus the principal difference between men and women (aside from the obvious external decorative differences) is the Y chromosome. If an airborne disease is only affecting one sex, it&#39;s pretty likely that it&#39;s something on X or Y affecting susceptibility.<br><br>If you modify Trojie&#39;s explanation, it works - rather than considering a disease carried on the X or Y chromosome, consider a gene or collection thereof on one or other of said chromosomes which effectively prevents one sex from either getting your airborne disease, or else from developing symptoms if they&#39;re a carrier.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not a PG, obviously, but I&#39;d guess not really. You&#39;ll be asking for permission to write missions, and they&#39;re done in straight prose, unlike the MST script format.

            <p>This is coal from the Titanic. The only actual Titanic artifacts that are allowed to be sold are lumps of coal from the ship&#39;s bunkers, now scattered across the seabed (obviously; the rest of the ship can be effectively considered a mass maritime graveyard).<br><br>So I want one. And the problem is that I can only get one from this traveling exhibit, when it comes around. So I have been unable to get one for like a decade.<br><br>I&#39;m mostly into 20th Century history; World War II in particular is my forte, but (as you might have guessed) I&#39;m also big on the Titanic. And the Hindenburg disaster, while not quite as interesting of a human interest story as either of those two, did happen to occur on my birthday, so yeah.<br></p>

            <p>So are you going to burn this coal? Or just... keep it, forever?<br><br>I like the human interest part of WWII - last story I got off my grandparents was about when the docks burnt, and my dad found an unexploded grenade in the cupboard under the stairs once. But at school it was all just dates and battles and yawn. And my grandparents were all born at the end of the twenties, so the really entertaining stories have come down from WWI and my great-grandparents instead. So I&#39;ll stick with the Vikings for now, because they&#39;re being surprisingly fun.</p>

            <p>When you MST a fic, you&#39;re basically trying to mimic the TV show effect of &quot;watching&quot; a fic. Thus you follow TV show format, AKA script writing.<br><br>However, fanfiction is supposed to be narrative. And in a narrative, you use prose. If you&#39;re writing a script for a TV show or movie, then you use script form. It doesn&#39;t matter if there&#39;s actually going to be a film or not, you write it with that intention in mind (even if the intention is just pretend because you like script format). It&#39;s a totally different case from normal fanfiction in my mind. I actually find prose much much easier than script because it&#39;s a style I&#39;m more familiar with, I don&#39;t watch much TV. But script writing is different to normal narrative. <br><br>Please feel free to write whatever you enjoy most though, really. Keep in mind though that FF.net has rules against script format and as a privately owned site it is within their rights to make that rule. I&#39;m still not exactly sure what you&#39;re asking us and why though. <br><br>Also, my head is completely gorilla free for the moment nor has it imploded in any fashion. That only happens on Tuesdays. </p>

            <p>First and foremost, I dislike it <i>because</i> it&#39;s easier to create. A person doesn&#39;t have to put as much time into it, which makes such things far, far more prone to being rubbish. A good writer will avoid that anyway, of course, but still, there is a great deal more pleasure to be had in reading prose, because it actually draws you into the narrative - it&#39;s literal storytelling, rather than the cold, clipped attitude of a script. That&#39;s not a story - it&#39;s the very detailed outline of a story. It&#39;s much harder to enjoy.<br><br>That said, there&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with it, but I won&#39;t read anything - fic, misson, whatever - that&#39;s in script format. </p>

            <p>I once had a Star Wars spoof written in script form. When I deleted all of my stories to start afresh and turn over a new leaf, that went the way of the dinosaur. In the rewrite that I&#39;m toying with, I wondered briefly if I should do it in script format again. After a fairly short period of time, I swapped to normal format and I doubt that I&#39;m going to be looking back. For a start, story format is better for descriptions and I&#39;m a big fan of descriptions.</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t speak for everyone, of course. But if it&#39;s a script, then script form is the way to go. One of my favourite Discworld fanfics was in script movie form. It&#39;s annoying when writers use script form incorrectly or in the wrong context though. A novel or a short story is very different from a play. It may be easier for you to write in script form, but it is difficult to read sometimes and you miss out on a lot of the description with script form. Personally I think prose is easier to read and write. <br><br>Also, if you don&#39;t care if your audience finds reading your story difficult, then you obviously don&#39;t care if they like your fic or not. Therefor, if someone complains about it, you shouldn&#39;t care about that. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m working on a Star Trek: The Next Generation fanfic and since my current beta-reader knows nothing about the fandom, I was wondering if anyone here would like to beta-read it.  My fanfic is about Data being mistaken for Edward Cullen by Twitards (in the 24th Century, the data on all the movies have been lost, so the only thing the Twitards have to go on is the books and that leads to complications), and he&#39;s definitely not happy about this.  I got the idea when I read a few discussion about Twitards comparing Data to Wardo (Edward Cullen).</p>

            <p>The only real way to be an eighth elvish would be to have a single elvish great-grandparent, which means... *digs for LoTR appendicies* ...said agent would have to be a child of Vardamir, second king of Numenor (and thus entirely Numenorean herself), or alternatively... *digs for Silm* ...a great-grandchild of Idril and Tuor? She would have to be a grandchild of a sibling of Earendil&#39;s, and given the human requirement, that would put her lifespan closer to the fall of Gondolin than the fall of Numenor.<br><br>In other words, canonical pairings are pretty much out of the question. You will probably have to invent one. Considering that the Valar basically said &quot;no more&quot; when Elrond and Elros decided, I rather doubt there would be another... <br><br>The trouble with Tolkien&#39;s universe is that Elvishness really isn&#39;t very divisible. If you&#39;re set on having a part-elvish Agent, you might want to pick a more condusive Canon for her to come from.</p>

            <p>1) Universes don&#39;t get PPC&#39;d - fics do. The Spies who trawl for badfic submit reports when they find fics that require PPCing. This is what the Department of Intelligence does.<br><br>2) Only if they&#39;re an ex-Sue or semi-fic blip, I suspect. Being part-anything, part-human tends to be considered Sueish, and you&#39;d need a good justification for doing it.<br><br>3) Depends on what works best for the story.

            <p>I&#39;ll answer question 4.<br><br>Possibly. It depends on whether fanfic writers use said misprint as canon in their fanfics. A good example is in the Official Fanfiction University of Redwall, where one of the students read an earlier edition of Redwall, which had a misprint that Killconey the ferret was a girl. As a result, said student was responsible for the creation of Girl!Killconey, or Konnie as she is often referred to.</p>

In the opening cinematic, after the four main characters fight their way through a horde of ravenous zombies and make it safely to a rooftop, I love the exchange of:<br><br>&quot;We made it! I can&#39;t believe we made it!&quot;<br>&quot;Son, we just crossed the street.&quot;</p>

            <p>Good MST though. Also, that fic had way too many technical errors.<br><br>About the <sup>%*||+-</sup> bit... Daleks print out parts of NetHack levels and stick them to walls?

            <p>And the Dalek speech is something that Ugolino picked up on, not me. I have a rather rudimentary knowledge of the Whoniverse; my reasons for picking this fic were the technical errors more than anything. And as anybody who&#39;s ever had me beta for them knows, I can&#39;t stand technical errors. :P</p>
