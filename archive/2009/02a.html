            <p>To get straight to the point, I&#39;m doing a short essay on the film adaptation of <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>, focusing mainly on scriptwriting and deliberate alterations, for better or worse, from the books. There are a number of moments where I think that they may not have made plot points clear to people who haven&#39;t read the books before, or made changes that upset/don&#39;t satisfy fans who have.<br><br>I&#39;m not asking for much, but if any of you can throw your opinions and / or experiences at me - especially if you can give me some links that&#39;ll look nice and shiny on my bibliography - I&#39;d very much appreciate it. <br><br>Cheers, <br>- Sedri<br><br>(...And I trust this isn&#39;t TOO off-topic.

            <p>I like Prisoner of Azkaban, only because it&#39;s the only stylish Potter film they&#39;ve made so far (Alfonso Cuaron has a lot to do with that). They did miss a fair bit of stuff out, but the question remains - do you stick religiously to the text, and end up with an overlong, crammed film without any atmosphere until the final moments, a la Goblet of Fire (essentially, a Greatest Hits package), or do you compile the most captivating film you can by liberally cutting and altering a few elements? Yes, the Marauders should have remained, but other than that, I think Azkaban is better for its changes.</p>

            <p>(&#39;course, I hate all the films in general and generally consider each worse than the last.  I actually walked out of the newest one.)<br><br>In response to Sedri, my main objections were the - in my mind - inaccurate characterizations of Remus Lupin and Sirius Black, the addition of the evil accountant&#39;s mustache on Remus, the changes made to the Boggart lesson as I thought they took away from Neville&#39;s characterization, and <i><b>explaining who the Marauders were</b></i>...and the mustache.  Remus is my favorite.</p>

            <p>Been a while since I&#39;ve seen it, and I&#39;ve only got it on video, so this is going off memory. But I remember bitching about that film <i>loads</i> so that should be alright.<br><br>Deliberate alterations have to include That Damned Moustache. JKR generally mentions facial hair when it&#39;s there. She mentions none on Lupin. And the one the film-makers gave him was just dire.<br><br>Other small alterations that annoyed the hell out of me include the ages of Harry&#39;s parents&#39; generation. They should be 33/34 in his third year, but they&#39;re all blatantly ancient. And it&#39;s Moony, not Mooney, and changing it to the latter on the Map was unforgiveable.<br><br>Main problem, which I think you&#39;re getting at, is the total lack of backstory. I&#39;ll see if I can get hold of a working video player tonight so I can give you a breakdown of everything that&#39;s wrong with them cutting out the backstory, because my brain&#39;s mostly blocked it out. Then I&#39;ll send you a lovely long ranting email about it.</p>

            <p>And it&#39;s why we have adaptation theory in Film Studies.  Yes, they should have.  But there&#39;s all kinds of arguments as to why they didn&#39;t need to, starting with that people had no idea how important his past coinciding with the Marauders would be when they started the film (although, really, people should just assume things are important and leave them in.

            <p>Was the omission of the &quot;parting of ways&quot; scene, in which Sirius and Snape come face to face in the Hospital Wing and Dumbledore explains in no uncertain terms that they are now on the same side and must at least pretend to get along. And then sends Snape on a secret mission. I couldn&#39;t believe they didn&#39;t include something as significant to their characters and the overall story as that.

            <p>Leaving aside Hermione&#39;s ghastly pink monstrosity, wasn&#39;t it PoA when Harry started wearing hoodies? And ones that fitted, at that, despite him supposedly wearing Dudley&#39;s hand-me-downs. Hoodies of the style Harry sports in the film weren&#39;t really standard accessories in the early nineties. I was wearing them in the late nineties, but as a so-called &quot;mosher&quot; - the trendies and the teggers wouldn&#39;t have been seen dead in hoodies. Dudley certainly wouldn&#39;t wear them. So unless Diagon Alley had alternative clothing stores in the early nineties, Harry&#39;s clothes can be charged for.<br><br>Can probably charge for hairstyles too. Early nineties, remember. It was a terrifying age. It also featured leggings, and shell suits, and other ghastly things I&#39;m doing my best to repress.</p>

In my day, there weren&#39;t so many of us, and not many sub-denominations were needed. Way back when, the outfit was huge trousers and a band hoodie or t-shirt, and an oversized keychain. Makeup on men, silly piercings, and dodgy illicit substance habits optional. Stupid dyed hairstyles were pretty much mandatory. Precursors to the emo kids, if you like, except we didn&#39;t generally slit our wrists.<br><br>Teggers = local word for townies.

            <p>Is it ok to make a Mandalorian Agent not take bleeprin? I know this is generally a Bad Idea, but I think it&#39;s plausible for the following reasons:<br><br>1.The Agent in question is a Mandalorian mercenary. As such she really doesn&#39;t care about the universes in questions, just the credits.<br><br>2. If something occurs which DOES offend her, such as violations of the Mandalorian code or the Author attacks Mandalorians/Mandalorian warriors, she goes completely berserk.<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br></p>

            <p>Bleeprin isn&#39;t mandatory. A lot of agents appreciate its effects, but many get by fine without it. Example from the DBS: Agent Paddlebrains ODed on it during training, and on one occasion Agent Trojie threw a lot of Bleepsinthe down Agent Paddlebrains&#39;s throat in lieu of retcon, but aside from that, neither of them really use the stuff.<br><br>Also, as mentioned, there really <i>aren&#39;t</i> any credits to be had.</p>

            <p>... I&#39;ve never actually seen that movie.<br><br>Anyway! It seems we have an epidemic on our hands, people. What do we think? What do we know? What can we prove?<br><br>We know that Agents of the PPC have been genderbent and that the effect doesn&#39;t appear to be limited to agents actually in HQ, though that one case could be a blip in the data. We don&#39;t know if all of HQ has been affected. Have agents on missions suddenly found themselves with a different set of parts? What about Flowers with a known gender? What about minis? Further investigations must be done in these areas.<br><br>We think this epidemic is linked to contaminated technology brought back from a mission by Agents Laburnum and Foxglove, with support from Agents Stormsong, Skyfire, and Drake, as well as Makes-Things and Dr. Fitzgerald. We also think Drake is probably to blame for spreading this contamination to the rest of the affected population. We can&#39;t prove this yet, as we don&#39;t know exactly what triggered the genderbend. We also don&#39;t know how to reverse the effect.<br><br>Further, we have yet to determine the extent of the effect. Is it just biology that gets switched? Is there an associated change in personality/behavior? In attire? Is sexual orientation affected? So far it seems the answers to these questions are Mainly Yes, Only insofar as hormones regulate personality/behavior, Yes, and No, but best to be sure.<br><br>Discuss.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who is taking an epidemiology class this term.</p>

            <p>At the moment, there&#39;s nowhere to go. We have a lack of internal consistency what with people dropping in and out of existence and, with the DORKS already recovered, no plot. So I think a bit of re-writing is in order before anything else happens. I&#39;d like to see the foxhunt go on for a while, at least. We can still have Ansela and Risa catch Drake if they want to, but not so quickly. I&#39;d also like to write my agents back into the scene to fill out that stretch where the RP left me behind.<br><br>Another problem is that I misinterpreted the door in hS&#39;s original post. He wrote &quot;the door of HQ.&quot; I read &quot;the doors of HQ,&quot; plural, and figured one of them would be the door to RC #999. Do we want the setting to be the corridor outside that RC, or something else?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think my normally female Agents would be very pleased about suddenly having harem girl outfits barely covering their new male bodies.

            <p>So, conclusions so far:<br><br>-We need to edit it a bit to indicate that C&amp;D came in from Outside.<br>-We need to extend the fox-hunt before Ansela catches Drake.<br>-We need to sort out the Lux thing. This is a conclusion I&#39;ve just invented, but it makes sense. As it stands, what happens is: Ansela claims Drake was waving the DORKS, Drake claims she gave it to Lux, and then reveals that&#39;s a lie. But Ansela would&#39;ve known it was a lie, and Drake doesn&#39;t seem to have any reason to say she did and then revoke it (except that Kit felt like he&#39;d driven me out of the thread or somesuch, which wasn&#39;t true :P). So that could do with making more sense.<br><br>I think we can agree that the genderbending is because of the DORKS... or can we? Kit keeps suggesting it&#39;s something to do with Drake&#39;s flashpatch, while it could also be the portal device MT rescued from the &#39;fic... but it&#39;s probably the DORKS. So the plot needs to centre around who has the blessed thing.<br><br>Hmm. How about (just a suggestion, now) we turn Drake&#39;s lie into the truth. Ansela never saw the DORKS, and Drake /did/ give it to Lux (or at least to someone). Then we can have a severely picked-on Drake forced to go along and try to help retrieve it, all while (if it is Lux) the genderbending takes on new quirks as Lux fiddles with the DORKS. Since you /know/ she&#39;d do /something/, and don&#39;t I remember her fiddling with technology sometime during TOS?<br><br>... bother. You know /he&#39;d/ do something, etc. Genderbent.<br><br>Okay, I don&#39;t know.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Given that C&amp;D had no PPC technology with them (although apparently they did have a portal generator of some sort, unless the door they came in through is local), introducing the flashpatch as a source wouldn&#39;t solve any problems, and would just mean we were chasing the wrong bit of tech for the entire story.

            <p>Yes, according to EGS canon, the TF gun adds hetero attraction to the switched person&#39;s usual orientation, therefore a straight guy would become a bi girl, etc. Official explanation is because it was designed for use by genderless aliens who wanted to settle among and interbreed with species which did have genders. Drake is pansexual (i.e. potentially likes everyone, including men, women, and tentacle monsters - hey, he&#39;s from an anime continuum) and didn&#39;t even understand the concept of orientation as such until Naomi explained it after a TS Bad Slash mission, so nothing&#39;s changed for him/her.<br><br>In the genderbending mission which started everything, nothing changed because they weren&#39;t using El Goonish Shive technology to genderbend until Skyfire got zapped at the end bit. The Sue tech works some other way.</p>

            <p>It sounds very techno-babble-ish. ^_^ And, the plothole thing makes sense. My idea is that someone did something with the Sue-contaminated portal device--turned it on the wrong way or something--and instead of working like a regular portal, it tapped into a bunch of plotholes, which caused the genderbend. So, to undo it, they&#39;d basically have to recreate the same circumstances with the contaminated portal device. That way, it would tap the very same plotholes, which should now contain everyone&#39;s original gender, outfit, etc., and things will go back to normal.<br><br>Not without some amusing trial and error, though, I&#39;m sure. *eg*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

Drake used it to go female, it instead tapped into the halfway fixed Sue portal, (which is actually PPC tech that was stolen by sue spies and reworked) and since it was PPC tech, it was able to bypass the security protocols, and did the ripple effect.<br><br>Now, the question I have is, would DIS or DIO get involved, since it is sort of Drake&#39;s fault for the genderbending?</p>

            <p>As I mentioned to Ansela earlier, and admittedly my biology can be corrected here, but, as you say, it&#39;s HIV that builds up in one&#39;s system. Not AIDS. The nasty one&#39;s passing on? It&#39;s not AIDS, it&#39;s HIV. And it doesn&#39;t always develop into AIDS. I think there&#39;s tests that show HIV pretty quickly, though possibly not as quickly as the fic mentioned has, but tests that pick up AIDS after that long? Whoever&#39;s got it must have a piss poor immune system, for it not to just have been transmitted but also to have developed that fast.</p>

            <p>Wow.  I wander back in after 5 years and it&#39;s like nothing has changed - well, except some of the names, but I remember Huinesoron and Neshomeh and... wow, I&#39;ve missed you guys. *overcome with sudden nostalgia*<br><br>Anyway, I dropped back by because my boyfriend recently started asking me some questions about LotR, and that made me remember how much I enjoyed this community. I just wanted to see if you guys were still around.<br><br><br>For those of you who weren&#39;t here 5+ years back, hi - I&#39;m Laureril, also known as Laura (irl) or Agents Erin and Maralys of the Dept. of Mary Sues LotR division.<br><br>In real life, I&#39;m finishing up a BA in Linguistics, with a minor in Comp Sci.  I&#39;m not sure when/if I&#39;ll get back involved here - I&#39;ve got a lot on my plate atm, but it&#39;s strangely good to be back.  Gah, I haven&#39;t really written fanfic in years.<br><br>So don&#39;t mind me, or my entourage of minis, I&#39;m just sticking my head in to say hi.</p>

            <p>My envy knows basically no bounds.  I really love linguistics, and was planning to major in it at one point (then I went to classical studies, then I went to Latin Teaching, then I went back to classical studies . . . then I dropped out of college to move to England.  Ahh, my life)<br><br>Welcome back to the board!  :D  I&#39;m kind of amazed that it&#39;s still active too . . .</p>

            <p>I remember you - good to see the resident techie is still around.<br><br>To answer your question:<br>Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics.<br><br>Fun stuff - like machine translation and syntactic parsers.  My theory is that if I know enough about the linguistics side, I can help design stuff, and then send it off to people who are better at programming than me to make it work.  Plus there&#39;s sometimes a lot of prep work in compiling corpora and most of that is very syntactic/linguistics-y.<br><br>I was originally planning on going into Comp Sci, but I couldn&#39;t keep up with the math, and the programming was getting over my head.  Now I&#39;m in Linguistics, which still kicks my butt on occasion, but at least there&#39;s less debugging.</p>

            <p>None at all in sunny Jersey (that&#39;s the Channel Island), although we did have some earlier this week. It&#39;d all bally melted before lunchtime. On the plus side, we did manage to get a snowball fight out of it.</p>

            <p>Inch or two fell on Sunday night, all turned to slush on Monday, then it rained. Ever since, the weatherman&#39;s been promising snow that has yet to turn up. <br><br>My brother-in-law had marvellous fun with the snow in Cornwall earlier in the week. There was no point in him driving to work, because down there everyone abandons their cars, often in the middle of the road, at the merest hint of snow. So he walked to work - three miles up and down hills, with no pavements, although fortunately no-one daring to drive either. I&#39;m jealous.<br><br>Ansela, stop hogging the snow!

            <p>Alex walked through the door and closed his eyes as a wave of sound and light washed over him. Various Agents, only a few of whom he recongized, were standing around nibbling on appetizers and holding drinks. They were mostly humanoid, although there was an Andalite and what looked suspiciously like a Dalek. <br><br>Looking back, Alex saw that it was indeed a Dalek and quickly backed away until it was out of sight. Wandering aimlessly, he wondered what Drental was doing: the Mandalorian had decided to return to their RC instead of indulging in what she saw as decadent and wasteful. Seeing a table loaded with refreshments, he made this way through the crowd, eyes fixed on the neat stacks of plastic bottles. <br><br>The nurse had called it Bleepan or something like that, but Alex didn&#39;t care what it was called. All he knew was that things had become a lot less unpleasant once he&#39;d taken the pill. Supposedly there were more bottles of this Bleepan on sale in the General Store, but there hadn&#39;t been any when he&#39;d visited. It looked like his luck was finally beginning to turn.<br><br>I watched with some amusement as Alex eagerly slid through the crowd towards the refreshment table, sipping my Coke as I discretely followed him. Closing my eyes for a second, I reached out to the others and saw the plot threads which connected them all to each other and to Alex. I knew everything there was to know about Alex, not only because he was my creation. In many ways, he was me. It was the differences which made him interesting. <br><br>I&#39;d dropped in shortly before Alex had stumbled across the party; I&#39;d made it quite clear that I was to be out of sight and in the middle of the crowd by the time he arrived. No wonder Vonnegut went a little mad in Breakfast of Champions: this sort of power is quite intoxicating. On a whim, I made a random Agent spill his drink onto Alex. The Bleeprum splashed onto his grey jacket, staining it and leaving him spluttering. As the Agent started profusely apologizing, I approached him from behind, blending in perfectly with the Agents and my fellow Boarders. I couldn&#39;t quite repress a chuckle as I planned the next few accidents; they&#39;d come close to topping his last mission. Not quite topping, but it was the best I could do when there were so many others limiting my control. I looked up slightly and saw Alex looking back at me. He seemed to be frozen in shock for a moment, which was all the time I needed to spin around and flee. Unlike Vonnegut, I had no intention of meeting my creation here or anywhere else, but this was especially unexpected. As I dropped the charade and began to run in earnest, one thought echoed inside my head. <br><br>This is NOT supposed to happen...</p>

            <p>...I actually make these lists for fun while I&#39;m sitting in class! The ones I make up in math are the most violent. If I were an agent, I might actually do most of these.<br><br>940. I will not lock my partner in the Aperture Science Testing Center, no matter how inept she is.<br><br>941. I will not paint a mural on the HQ hallway wall in the blood of Mary Sues.<br><br>942. I will not attempt to rickroll HQ, especially if I think Rick Astley was hot and really dig the whole 80&#39;s vibe he&#39;s got going in that video.<br><br>943. I am not allowed to let sock puppets take responsibility for any of my actions, nor can they go on my missions for me.<br><br>944. Attempting to subtly convince the canon characters that I am a child molester is. Not. Funny.<br>-Except in special situations. However, it makes it difficult to do your job if they don&#39;t trust you. Really.<br><br>945. I am not allowed to attempt to purchase any canon character&#39;s soul, nor am I allowed to set up a &quot;slave trade&quot;.<br>Even if I claim that it&#39;s a historical re-enactment.<br><br>946. Not allowed to join the Black Cats. Or the &#39;Sues. Or the fangirls.<br><br>947. I am not allowed to make posters of anti-flower propoganda.<br>-Or flyers. Organizing protests is right out.<br><br>948. The flowers may be plotting to steal Christmas, but I am still not allowed to organize a protest.<br><br>949. I am not authorized to fire Flowers.<br><br>946. Black body paint is NOT a uniform.<br><br>947. I am not the psychological warfare mascot, and therefore I may not conduct psychological experiments on the flowers. Or other agents.<br><br>948. Any reports submitted with my blood on them will result in disciplinary action in the future.<br>-The flowers do not even want to know how I managed to digitize my own blood.<br><br>949. I am not allowed to replace the no-drool videos with snuff flicks.<br>-Or pornos.<br><br>950. There is no monster living in the console.<br><br>951. I am not allowed to nickname the console &#39;stupid b***&#39;. The monster will get offended.<br><br>952. I should not teach the flowers gang handshakes.<br><br>953. &#39;Best 2 out of 3&#39; does not apply to missions.<br><br>954. A rubber band and a paperclip is not an authorized PPC weapon.<br><br>955. THE REVOLUTION IS NOT NOW, goddamnit.<br><br>956. If I insult an agent in another language, the advantage is lost if they&#39;re wearing a translator.<br><br>957. I may not jury rig a portal jammer and deploy it in HQ, or anywhere else for that matter.<br><br>958. Making canon characters cry is not what I was hired for.<br><br>959. No, I cannot get a pay supplement for every time a Sue annoys me.<br><br>960. I am not a &#39;Ninja in Training&#39;, so hiding in the ceiling vents and jumping out at people is not allowed.<br><br>961. I am also not allowed to induce a panic attack in my partner by suggesting to her that perhaps there ARE no vents, and we should keep the door open to avoid suffocating to death.<br><br>962. The minis do not like tootsie rolls, which are bad for their health.<br><br>963. None of the vending machines are trying to kill me. Probably.<br><br>964. I am not allowed to play with liquid nitrogen.<br><br>965. I am not allowed to experiment with bleeprin and ethyl alcohol.<br><br>966. I am not allowed to make a molotov cocktail with a bottle of alcohol and some bleeprin, even if I think it has a hilarious similarity to the mentos and coke experiment.<br><br>967. I am not allowed to threaten suicide with pop rocks and coke, nor with mentos and coke.</p>

<li>Traumatizing Amano Ginji in order to get him to toast all the &#39;Sues in the vicinity with lightning will result in an investigation of my sanity and capability, not to mention angry (armed) visits by fellow agents for harming a canon.<br><br>932.

<li>Doctors Crell Moset, Demagol and Jenna Zan Arbor are never to be allowed to meet.<br>-The same goes for any other doctors and scientists of their brand of cruelty.<br>899. If anybody has wound up in the same room as Agent Cavan Shenn, I will not lock the door on them.<br>-He can lock the door on his own, thanks all the same.<br>-I&#39;m not to lock anybody in with Luxury, either, even to keep her from chasing me.<br>900. I will not engage in drinking contests with members of species that have more than one liver, unless I am similarly equipped.<br>901. No matter how balloon-like that canon superheroine&#39;s chest is, pins will not make her deflate. I will not experiment in this matter.<br>-It is acknowledged that attempting to deflate Sues may still be considered amusing.<br>902. I am not the long-lost Hair Washing Servant of Severus Snape.<br>903. Glitter is not a food condiment.<br>904. Unless I have found a coherent and efficient alternate means of communication, I will refrain from taking vows of silence.<br>-Interpretive dance does not count as an alternate means of communication.<br>905. Unless there is actually a location requiring it, a ballerina costume is not a suitable disguise for my mission.<br>906. No, I can&#39;t shave the Wookiee.<br>907. I am not to steal Wash&#39;s dinosaurs.<br>-If I do, I deserve whatever Zoe does to me.<br>908. My partner&#39;s eyebrows are not challenging me to a duel.<br>909. Most Agents from the Trekverse have already had the &#39;Sexy Data Tango&#39; inflicted upon them. I will not force them to endure repeat hearings.<br>-I will never, never, never play that song where Data, Tasha Yar or any other canon character can hear it.<br>910. I am not a Barbie Girl, the PPC is not a Barbie World, and offers to &#39;undress me everywhere&#39; will lead to no sympathy whatsoever if Lux hears me.<br>911. Despite the name, it is still wrong to convince somebody to drink a Molotov Cocktail.<br>-Unless they&#39;re a Sue.<br>912. I am to accept that I deserve both the stab wounds and the long litany of similar canon names if I imply Agent Shadowflame&#39;s name resembles that of a Sue.<br>-She has a long list from Star Wars history, and she&#39;s not afraid to use it.<br>913. NO, the Naruto tailed beasts do not belong in a petting zoo.<br>-Further inquiries will see you directed to FicPsych, in the worrying case that you&#39;re unable to see why this is a Very Bad Idea.<br>914. Even if I&#39;m sure I&#39;d do a better job, I am expressly forbidden from staging coups, mutinies or other takeovers to replace a canon character in a position of authority.<br>915. If I can&#39;t get the mission done without that inflatable barnyard animal, it&#39;s time I re-evaluated my grasp of PPC procedures.<br>916. My fellow Agents are not there to be dissected.<br>-Even if I&#39;ve never seen their like before.<br>-<s>Even</s>Especially if I have a &#39;really interesting scientific theory&#39;.<br>918. I will not pit conventional vampire slayers against unconventional vampires.<br>-No. Buffy will not be fighting that Anzati. Ever.</li>

            <p>One thing is clear to meh now.<br><br>We must eliminate all furry woodland creatures who are small. The squirrels and chipmunks have joined forces, and have discovered many sorts of powerful weapons with which they&#39;re gonna kill us all. I hear that one such weapon is a kind of acorn that SOMEHOW creates a manifestation of their mind in the form of some... weird... brain... demon... thingy that can shoot fire and stuff. Yeah.<br><br>So, anyone who dares, come and fight for the cause! Any tiny death machines? Great! Orbs with a giant laser circumference? Better! Time-travelling magic katanas? Awesome!

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>First off, I&#39;ve gotten off on a new project: a fic series based on the first Michael Bay TRANSFORMERS Movie and only the first. Although based on the trailer for the second, I will introduce Ravage as a rebuilt composite of a half-dead Scorponok and the Mountain Dew Earthbot (who had been killed by Soundwave after begging for an end to the pain that had been inflicted upon him by the humans to turn him into a hound).<br><br>Anyway...<br><br>My main area of concern is my main female OC: Edith McPherson.  She&#39;s from Louisville Kentucky, white lower middle class and had a professional-turn-romantic-turn-nookie relationship with Miles Lancaster (aka Best-human-friend of Ladiesman217) while an exchange studient in SoCal.  In usual narrative fashion, no protection was used and thus was concieved Alvin.  Personal choice and a somewhat conservative social environment resulted in a closed adoption, and in any other universe that would hae been the end of the story (aside from Miles developing a lovelorn alcohol problem and Edith going through any number of psychological dramas and traumas).<br><br>However, Starscream, upon return to the Crashed warship NEMESIS on the Martian surface (and with forced assitance from a Barricade fearing execution for desertion) discovers  something about her (and her son) that would not only give him and the remaining Decepticons the ultimate bargaining chip... but would clear the path for the war to come to a successful end.<br><br>Because 10 years ago, on a sight-seeing trip to the Grand Canyon, a bored, 8-year-old Edith wandered off and discovered a dark, shiny cube with funny symbols roughly 1 inch square. gripping it in her right hand and wanting to take it back to show her parents, the cube nevertheless began crackling blue and practically dissolved into her hand.  <br><br>She spent the rest of the day at the Visitor&#39;s medical center getting the burn treated, but when she arrived home strange things began happening whenever she touched electronic devices with exposed skin (main tv switching channels erratically, toaster running away).  A fear of things electronic was formed, later abated in her teens by wearing gloves and long sleeves whenever using a computer or calculator.  When Alvin was born, the cube manifested itself as a flexible, growinng crystaline lattice-work on the anterior surface of his spine.<br><br>So, when (perhaps intentionally) fragmented medical records documenting the death of the adoptive couple&#39;s first child reach the Decepticons, decisive action is taken.  Edith is located, shown the findings and used as a caretaker for Alvin as Barricade travels to Autobot territory to invite Prime to Starscreams ultimate offer:  not only a mere truce, but a repair of Cybertronian society into a factionless prewar Ideal, led by one Prime and one Lord High Protector (of course, Starscream nominates himself for the position).<br><br>Now, I&#39;m not trying to Flanderize anyone.  The remaining Decepticons go along with this, but that does not mean that they are suddenly &quot;Nice&quot;, or immediately become heroic Autobots.  There are malicious pranks, political wrangling and a lingering distaste for organics.<br><br>Likewise, I&#39;m trying to keep Edith from becoming a Sue: Instead of reveling in her former powers, she was afraid of them.  And she fears for Alvin not only dying, but also being raised without proper knowledge of what he can do or how to avoid large messes involving cars, soda machines and videogames.<br><br>There is also something else, far out in space, that is interested in the Allspark.  And this thing will not be interested in human wellfare.<br><br>To review my work so far, theres my Livejournal or Ff.net pages<br><br><a href="http://gandalf-beige.livejournal.com/"><a href="http://gandalf-beige.livejournal.com/">http://gandalf-beige.livejournal.com/</a></a><br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/449017/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/449017/">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/449017/</a></a><br><br>So, does anything have to improve, or is there a movie litmus test or what?</p>

            <p>Maybe a little Sue-y, but if you make sure to concentrate on the giant robots rather than the humans it should be cool. Of course, I&#39;m no expert on Transformers canon. I saw the Bay movie, but not from a fannish perspective. I only went because I was promised giant robots blowing stuff up and I just can&#39;t resist that.</p>

            <p>Actually, that&#39;s what I planned: the main focus is on Starscream&#39;s attempt to (alternatively) dangle hope for a peaceful future in front of Prime, while at the same time guilting Prime into the deal (which involves Edith keeping Alvin) by turning Prime&#39;s &#39;talking points&#39; back at him.  <br><br>Themes like choice and freedom will be bandied about by Starscream, with him basically saying that if Prime cannot apply those words to Edith keeping her son, then they are the hollow words of a fool... a fool, coincidentally, who would care more for the same Government who tortured one of his soldiers than for the fate of his own species.<br><br>There is also, of course, some human stuff, but that&#39;s more along the line Miles trying to come to terms with exactly what role he wants to play.  He wants to help Edith... but beyond that, in terms of re-starting a relationship with her or even the thought of being a family unit with his offsprng and genetomate; those are wild dreams, secret dreams.  Plus dealing with the adoptive parents in an appropriate way, but I&#39;m working on that.<br><br>Chuck in some more Robot stuff with Frenzy, Lazerwing, the Earthbots and a little slapstick and Sitcom-ery... we&#39;ll see where this planned series takes me.    </p>

            <p>I know this may be me being cynical or something, but I have a bad feeling about this author&#39;s motivations.<br><br>A short while ago Zero&#39;s seiyuu, Mamoru Miyano, announced that he was newly married and that his wife was with child. Cue fangulls screeching that they hated Mrs Miyano and that they wanted her and the baby to die in horrible and painful ways. This may be unconnected, but it still gets me riled up anyway because of that exact shitstorm.<br><br>Luckily the handful of LJ communities dedicated to shows where Mamoru Miyano has a part were much more sensible, and any of that sort that snuck in were quickly shot down.</p>

            <p>I got asked an interesting question yesterday, to which I have no answer.<br><br>&quot;A fic is on Fanfiction.net and Adultfanfiction.net, word for word identical. If you read the reviews for the fic before the fic itself, which would you believe? A review on FF.net saying that the fic is good/horrible or a review on AFF.net saying the exact opposite?&quot;<br><br>What the hell is the logical response? Generally, reviews from both FF.net and AFF are rubbish and worthless, AFF only moreso. However, you get the occasional intelligent reviewer on FF.net. But you also get the very rare person on AFF who appears to be a decent human being. I even spotted one person who could justifiably say &#39;If you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t read it&#39;, something that I can&#39;t say the same for FF.net.<br><br>What are your views on this?</p>

            <p>I would assume what it indicated was just the level of smut in the piece, more than the relative intelligence of FF.net reviewers or AFF reviewers. If the review on FF.net was good and the other one was horrible, I&#39;d assume it had plenty of smut. If it were the other way around, I&#39;d assume it had one of those cliffhanger-smut endings, where you suggest the smut but never actually get into it. That would make most AFF denizens mad, I think. :D</p>

            <p>If I want to see my favourite characters have explicit sex (and I occasionally do), I have my better places to find it. Places with classier layouts and funnier jokes. Still, as far as I know, it&#39;s just FF.net with more smut, yeah? I haven&#39;t browsed it enough to have any idea what the general level of fic is. The only times I&#39;ve been is when a specific fic has been recced to me. <br><br>I&#39;m likely to treat the reviews with equal respect (translation: none) and either just read the fic myself to find out or not bother at all. <br><br>There are good fics on FF.Net, so I&#39;m sure there&#39;s good fics on AFF.Net. However, the reviewers are much worse judges of good writing than the actual writers are in my experience so I don&#39;t bother taking them at face value. <br><br><br>(FYI, Adultfanfiction.net seems much more like smut for smuts sake than what I&#39;m into (if Cassie gets back in time to read this she&#39;s gonna laugh her head off) so I don&#39;t go there very often.)</p>

            <p>The answer I&#39;m leaning towards is &#39;Screw the reviews, let&#39;s read this fic with rockets launchers standing by.&#39;<br><br>And the general level of fic... hmm... search up Deathstalker (mainly for the Resident Evil section, but expands once in a while) or SuicideKing (for Harry Potter). Those will assure you that you never wish to return to the site again. But yes, you can get the very, very, very occasional goodfic on the site (or, at the very least, averagefic). I&#39;ve encountered two that I can think of: one which has no smut whatsoever and just focuses on killing Lara Croft in a thousand different ways. It was well-written and the idea was so obvious yet rare that it was immediately spared my wrath. The second was a... actually, I can&#39;t remember what the second one was. A contender for the spot, however, would be a Star Wars fic with would be a very good (and incredibly phregging disturbing) torture fic if it hadn&#39;t had the sexual elements in (though, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve read it and they could potentially enhance the story further depending on your mindset).<br><br>AFF has very few non-smut fics and, hilariously, the reviewers complain when something <i>isn&#39;t</i> smut. DCase in point: that Tomb Raider fic mentioned above, one reviewer shouted &#39;ZOMFG how can you find this erotic, you sick bastard&#39; or something to that extent, completely missing the point that it was simply too bloody for FF.net, rather than being too erotic.</p>
