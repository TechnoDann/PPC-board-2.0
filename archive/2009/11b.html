            <p>But Meowth worked hard for a long time to learn human speech; this Bidoof just seems to randomly be able to talk with no explanation how or why. (Although I only read the first chapter, so maybe it&#39;s addressed later?) But yes, the butt-sex is definitely the bigger issue here.</p>

            <p>What ho, fellow Boarders!<br><br>Rumour and gossip has reached this fair green isle, of a conference to be held next summer. <br><br>&quot;So what?&quot; we hear you ask as you shrug disinterestedly. <br><br>But this conference is not just any conference, no, for lo! it goeth by the name of the International Palaeontological<br>Congress, and our very own Trojieface is in the process of looking into funding to attend. It will be a lengthy journey, with many toils through great darkness (unless the plane flies the other way around the world), but if all goes to plan she will set foot upon these shores (&#39;these shores&#39; being England) for the first time in seventeen years at the end of June 2010.<br><br>Naturally, our great and glorious Trojieface cannot be kidnapped and kept indefinitely in a box under her partner&#39;s bed immediately, as attending this conference is sort of a necessity. However, when it is complete, she plans to set aside her intellectual travails for a<br>period of not less than one week, and journey into the grim reaches of the north.<br><br>We recognise that it is entirely possible that the only thing that has thus far kept the world from imploding is the careful maintenance of twelve thousand miles between Trojie&#39;s brain and Pads&#39;s brain.<br><br>However, should it come to pass that the Empire survives this momentous meeting, we feel it only fair that Pads let the rest of you share in this exciting and joyous jubilee of gutter humour and energetic glomping, even if only for a few hours. (This will give her time to put the final touches on the Great Kidnapping Plot.)<br><br>And so, bearing in mind that this is all very tentative, and funding may not be achieved, we&#39;re thinking Hull Gathering, early July 2010.<br><br>Anyone up for it?</p>

            <p>Suppose I could materialize a limited number of military units (Infantry squads, armor, etc) as well as some equipment for myself.  <br>They would not be human lives, merely imitations of life that could recieve orders telepathically and obey without question.  <br>They could fit in with the canon or be generic soldiers with M1 tanks.  <br>I would not need to constantly think about them to keep them present but if i were to fall asleep or be knocked unconscious they would all dematerialize.  If I were riding in a gunship and fell asleep for even a moment i would fall to my death.<br>I would only be able to summon things that are related to combat (weapons, armor, etc) and would have to create fuel and ammo regularly.  <br>The units would have a limited range to keep them from being able to go to the other side of the world while i drink biscuits and tea.  Summoning each one would cost some kind of energy or stamina or something.  maybe you have ideas.<br>I also don&#39;t know if I want to be able to create the soldiers from nothing or transform existing matter into soldiers.

            <p>The essence of the PPC is that we&#39;re never going to finish our job; that&#39;s why the sadistic Flowers have so many Rules in the first place. What you suggest would be efficient, effective, and absolutely no fun. Who wants to read a story like that? It&#39;s effectively the Mary-Sue version of a war game. <br><br>That said, if you scaled it down immensely and put in a lot of problems that cause your agent&#39;s minor advantage to often malfunction, backfire, or otherwise be a source of humour without breaking the general PPC agent mold... that has potential. You&#39;d have to run it by the Board first, though.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d strongly, <i>strongly</i> suggest reading the Original Series. It&#39;s where this entire sub-sub-sub-culture comes from, and well worth the read even if you&#39;re not an Agent, just for the entertainment value. (Hell, even if you don&#39;t know LotR canon, they&#39;re good.) They&#39;ll also give you a very good idea of original PPC canon. The spin-off series&#39; can be really awesome (and in most cases are-- or all cases, I&#39;m hardly an unbiased observer), but the Original Series is where the PPC comes from, it&#39;s what the PPC really looks like, and it should definitely be your first resource while looking for an idea for an Agent.<br><br>And if you&#39;re a One Piece fan, if that&#39;s where your agent would be, why the need for a superpower at all? Most of that world seems to be fairly normal, except for those who&#39;ve eaten Devil Fruits. Your agents&#39; disguised as pirates should be just fine to take down any Sue/Stu  -- or if you really wanted, a shark or something, even. But that&#39;s just my two cents.<br><br>(As a nitpick of an aside, I&#39;d recommend also that you go through your posts before putting them up and check your grammar. They&#39;re not that bad; just a quick once-over will probably do, if you don&#39;t mind. It&#39;s kind of in the Constitution. Also, be careful of double posting, and try not to start too many original threads so close together. Each new thread bumps an old one off the front page, and another one off into the Dead Space of the Net.)</p>

            <p>You really should read The Original Series. The PPC has a rather unique feel to it, just because a power isn&#39;t grossly overpowered doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;ll fit well. There have been rather powerful Agents who fit in, and I could fairly easily write one who would be a perfectly normal person... and yet be completely and utterly the opposite of what the PPC is trying to do. (Huinesoron <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn3/Badfic.htm">already did</a>, actually...)<br><br>So, read TOS. It&#39;s a very good read, and ultimately, if you haven&#39;t read the original material, writing fanfic is rather hard...</p>

            <p>Just want to make sure I explained the jarate thing properly (For those who don&#39;t play tf2) before proposing something else:<br>Becoming a jarate &quot;master&quot; only takes as long as you need to piss in a jar.<br>Enemies who have been hit by jarate lose the will to live (At least in the game).<br>This probably wont work on &quot;ebil&quot; sues, who always seem to have some weird fetish.</p>

            <p>I enjoy the Canterbury Tales. Chaucer was a man after our own hearts, if you ask me. According to my lit professors, most of what he was doing was snarking at the foolishness of the Catholic Church and the upper classes (and other mock-worthy people, like alchemists), which makes the whole experience funnier.<br><br>Disclaimer: I have nothing against Catholics or the Catholic Church.

            <p>There are a few female agents I can think of who are supernatural beings--<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Vemi_Fincaran">Vemi Fincaran</a> turned out to be a Maia; <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Verra_Rose">Verra Rose</a> is well-known for being a dragon; there are a couple of vampires, including <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Selene_Windflower">Selene Windflower</a>; and then there&#39;s my own <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Jennifer_Robinson">Jenni Robinson</a>, who fits the description to such a degree that I&#39;m afraid she&#39;s the one you were referring to. ^_^;<br><br>But the key thing you said there was &quot;chooses to limit her power,&quot; which means that the supernatural part is more a piece of trivia than anything else, aside from a couple instances of telepathy in Jenni&#39;s case, one of which was not her idea. Similarly, I don&#39;t recall Vemi ever using power of any sort, and Selene got into huge trouble for letting her lightning ability get out of hand. Verra might have eaten a few &#39;Sues, but that&#39;s only to be expected from a dragon, and a neat way to dispose of them to boot. Also, all of those except Jenni are either retired or insane, and Jenni works in FicPsych, not in the Word Worlds. Anyway, the key is not to be ostentatious in any way--as others have said, that&#39;s not what we&#39;re about. Read any of the aforementioned women&#39;s missions, and you&#39;ll see.<br><br>Recap: Yes, there are agents with powers. However, they do not make a point of it, and they get slapped down for it if they get ideas above their station and use them during missions. Most agents do NOT use <s>Sueper</s> superpowers.<br><br>And do read the Original Series first and foremost.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>There&#39;s no wiki article because we haven&#39;t needed one. The rule runs thus: if it&#39;s extra or sparkly or amazing or in some way beyond the abilities of your average bog standard human, then it&#39;s not an idea to run with. There&#39;s leeway if the agent in question isn&#39;t human, but even then, the aim is to make agents as normal and non super powered as possible.<br><br>Consider it this way: if you need an agent with amazing sparkly powers to beat the Sue, then you&#39;re validating that Sue&#39;s existence. We take them down with logic, sanity, laws of physics, and hard graft. Any Sue can be taken down with such. A Sue that <i>needs</i> magical powers to be dealt with? It&#39;s like you&#39;re admitting her powers are special and sparkly and beyond human.</p>

            <p>I think it&#39;s disgusting. The worst one that I found for the Tortall series is actually canon (or quasi-canon; I forget). They call Numair Salmalín &quot;Numy&quot;. Some like it, but it makes me feel like vomiting. I think the Tortall fandom has rather a lot of nicknames.</p>

            <p>Except it&#39;s the Tortall-verse OT4: Alanna, Jon, Gary, and Raoul. A lot of the fans on Goldenlake like making crack fic about it. Don&#39;t ask Goldenlakers about Mindelan Sandwiches. You might be better off not knowing. However, if you already know, then you know that it&#39;s always used in a humorous manner.

            <p>And oh yes, there&#39;s a U2 fandom: LJ comms (u2fic, u2slash), websites (loveisblindness.net), whatever. Where U2 get slashed by twos, threes and fours. Same for the wives/girlfriends (except there are no fours as one of the U2 members is single but still). there are also fics with Mary Sues half the U2 members&#39;s age, and fics about the children. Fics come from the whole timeline. I came across a LJ comm which spotted U2 badfic: wrath<em>of</em>thawg (where I found the U2 bondage fic MSTed).<br>I admit, I did write some (gen) fic (before I knew of the fandom) and it was pretty bad.<br>U2 aren&#39;t the ones being treated like this, aren&#39;t the worst (My Chemical Romance and Panic! At The Disco come to mind. These guys get slashed like hell).<br>One factoid : Bono doesn&#39;t like the mullet he had in the 80s anymore.</p>

            <p>I know it&#39;s out there, I guess. I just don&#39;t think about it. Some things... U2 is sacred to me. That&#39;s not the right word, but it&#39;s the closest I can come.

            <p>I too tend to avoid U2 fic. In fact, I only look for sites mocking it. But I haven&#39;t been lucky so far (a dead LJ comm).<br>There are a lot of h/c fics, like everywhere (and they finish the same way... sorry for your mind). Some people can&#39;t help seeing homo subtext in the U2 members&#39; body language, and can&#39;t help writing it as text. At &#39;best&#39;, it&#39;s only implied or treated as &#39;secret love&#39; because the guys feel bad about cheating on their wives with each other... FECK.<br>That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like reading U2 fic. One time or another, I come across a sentence along the line of &#39;Dude A&#39;s love towards Dude B&#39; or something. In an otherwise totally gen context. I don&#39;t think friends, even as strong as U2 are, would &#39;love&#39; each other. I don&#39;t know of a good word, because &#39;like&#39; is too weak in this context, and &#39;love&#39; has romantic connotations... but wtf.<br>BTW the animal was a skunk, I think.</p>

            <p>Yeah... I dunno. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I have no problem with slash. It can be well done, and I enjoy reading a well-written slashfic every bit as much as a hetero fic or whatever. Hell, even noncanon slash -can- be written plausibly. But slashing real people (who are straight)... Eh. I dunno.<br><br>Love is the word you are looking for, I think. Platonic love. Love is <i>definitely</i> the word to describe U2. But... platonic love is not eros. It&#39;s not lust. Hell, eros can&#39;t even be equated with lust, though they overlap. Do you see what I&#39;m saying? Love is there, yes. But there is more than one kind of love. (I can&#39;t recommend <i>The Four Loves</i> strongly enough on that topic. Nobody says it like CS Lewis. ...would it sway your opinion if I told you Bono is a Lewis fan? Hell, he based parts of MacPhisto on Screwtape.)</p>

            <p>I have never heard any member of U2 -call- another &#39;love,&#39; as a name. I&#39;ve heard love used as an endearing nickname (or term of affection, you know what I mean), but not by them. But then, we don&#39;t know what they do when the cameras are off. <br><br>...no, I couldn&#39;t write that paragraph with a straight face. We don&#39;t know exactly what they call each other when the cameras are off, but I&#39;d be willing to bet what they&#39;re doing is writing songs and making music, joking around like four friends who have known each other since highschool... and not having hot gay sex. And not just because they&#39;re married, but because <i>platonic love is not romantic love.</i> Don&#39;t get me wrong here, romantic love can spring from platonic love. But after feckin&#39; thirty YEARS, I think it would&#39;ve happened if it was going to happen. I&#39;d bet that what they have is so strong, it kicks the ASS of whatever lust-oriented motives would result in four-ways between them. That is to say, <i>theoretically</i> (and if you go way, way, WAY out of context), there could be something there, th motives don&#39;t necessarily have to be lust-oriented. But... well, I&#39;ve never read these slashfics (with, I think, sufficent reasons given), so I don&#39;t necessarily know. But-- tell me if I&#39;m wrong here-- I&#39;ll bet that if you read these &#39;fics with an analytical eye, the motives are almost exclusively lustful. Especially if you read between the lines-- not even necessarily the author&#39;s given motives for the bandmates to be jumping each other, but the author&#39;s motives for writing it. <br><br>(Let me make this clear, too: What you want to fantasize about in your own head is your own business. Go ahead and daydream about Larry and Bono getting it on if that&#39;s what floats your boat. But writing that? Sitting down and taking the time and the words and the altogether work to type that all out? And then putting it up in public... that&#39;s, that&#39;s a little scary, to me. If you&#39;re slashing Legolas and Aragorn, okay, whatever. It&#39;s not canon, it might be horribly written, and it&#39;s completely out of character, but they&#39;re fictional characters, so... yeah, whatever. But when you&#39;re doing that to <i>real people</i>? I think... maybe it&#39;s just me, the writer in me, but I think actually writing that shite down is a bad move, because physically writing it out can mess with your head. And it also makes the whatever you want to call it in your head that much stronger, and, hell, <i>they can see it</i>. A quick google search would show any curious member exactly what their fans think of them. Eh. Personally, my fantasies run along the lines of, ya know, writing this amazing article about some vastly important news story, covering it firsthand before anyone knew about it-- maybe busting the US President for funding anti-fair-trade attacks or something-- and getting to meet Bono, winning his approval, maybe his respect. Getting to tell him he&#39;s my hero, he is part of the reason why I am who I am. It&#39;s every bit as absurd and unlikely, it&#39;s an improbable, if not entirely impossible, fantasy. And it&#39;s a fictional story about real people. And that is why you will never see me write it down as such. Because that, in my book, would be <i>wrong</i>. My inner writer is the truest part of my soul. It&#39;s okay for me to have stupid fantasies in my head, in the same way that it&#39;s okay to have horrible nightmarish images, because it&#39;s just a passing thing, sometimes stuff I barely control. But to write it down? To consciously put pen to paper, fingers to keyboard, and make that vision, a fictional story about a REAL PERSON into a concrete thing... that would be a violation of my inner core, in a way... I don&#39;t know. Anyway. More than you needed to know. That&#39;s why I reacted to you mentioning that there are U2 slashfics out there by a suppressed scream, followed by laying my head on my desk for several minutes. Because that feels... <i>wrong</i>, in my twisted little soul, at least.)<br><br>So. WAY too much information, but to answer your question, no. No, I don&#39;t think most friends call each other &#39;love.&#39; They might feel a deep love for each other, but I doubt it would be vocalised quite like that.<br><br>(Another thing, one which slipped my mind when I was talking about platonic love versus romantic love earlier, and yes, another <s>paraphrased</s> Lewis quote: Friends are shoulder to shoulder, they look in the same direction. Lovers are face to face, they look at each other.) Or something like that.</p>

            <p>I already knew the answer to my question, and just wanted to have confirmation. I don&#39;t see U2 at ALL as slash partners, and I agree with you on that. It just is that I came across a fic (an apparently gen one) and I read Bono calling Edge &#39;love&#39; (or the other way around, I don&#39;t remember).<br>I&#39;m too of the ones who don&#39;t like non-canon relationships in any fandom, real or fictional. U2 are friends, I see them as friends. I was just pissed at the fact that not everybody can get it. I even came across fics where they waited for like 10, 15, 20, even 30 years before admitting they&#39;re in love with each other. Feck.<br>If only we could tell the people on U2 fanfics comms. I agree with you that writing about real people is weird. What would they think if they knew they were slashed with each other? Frak. You&#39;re right not to read that.<br>BTW, I love your quote. It pretty much sums up it all.</p>

            <p>I think you have to be ignoring a lot of subtext to actually believe that any of them are RL slash, though. (For one, they&#39;re all very clearly hetero.) Especially anything with MacPhisto-- half his act was draping himself across the rest of the band. But if you hear them talk... there&#39;s something very emotional, very strong, very loving there, but it&#39;s definitely platonic. If it&#39;s anything more than that, it&#39;s just a stronger-than-usual platonic relationship, taken to another level by the way they connect through music. I figure, no one could hang around the same three guys for thirty years without some kind of bond forming there-- that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a romantic bond.

            <p>I haven&#39;t read the book, but I think it could be useful, yes.<br>I second everything you say. Yes, it seems that most people think every non-family bond is a romantic one (and there are some twisted people out there who think that even some family bonds can turn into romance), and showing affection towards a fellow human being is only a way to ask for sexual favors, or something, rather than the expression of anything else than romantic love. This mistake has led some people to think showing affection to your child is paedophilia... so why not thinking showing affection to your fellow U2 member is homosexuality? (not being a homophobe here, some people still get that mixed up)<br>Oh, and I think the U2 members think of themselves as brothers or something. Which would make them a family of almost 20 people (wives and children included). This in fact inspired me for my original fiction: some of my aliens live with their best friends and their respective families, and friendship bonds are as important there as love is on Earth.</p>

            <p>Actually, I think he was supposed to be in his late thirties, and J.K. Rowling has said she was thinking of Rickman when she designed the character, but I just like him because he&#39;s badass. Really, &quot;he&#39;s hawwt!1!!&quot; doesn&#39;t need to be in the list of reasons to like a character. Reasons I like various characters from various continuua include &quot;badass&quot;, &quot;could beat up Edward Cullen&quot;, &quot;shiny&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m attracted to power&quot;, and &quot;hot&quot;. Which is at the end of the list. (Of course, I have a skewed idea of what constitutes &quot;hot&quot;.)</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know if the address will change, I&#39;ll have to check when it&#39;s up.<br><br>I do need to ask about one thing: the new host (streamline.com) does not allow adult-rated content. This shouldn&#39;t affect it too much, I&#39;ll just have to move my Mossflower Science Theatre stuff back to my LJ. Can I still get away with having links to my sporkings of adult-rated fics up on my site if they&#39;re not hosted there? If not I&#39;ll just comb through my lj and tag them properly so they can still be found there, so no biggie.<br><br>Speaking of Mossflower Science Theatre, I&#39;m reworking the warning because on closer inspection of the original fic&#39;s disclaimer I think the author was trying to say Matthias had been aged up. The exact phrasing was along the lines of &quot;he&#39;s thirteen in the cartoon, but it doesn&#39;t say his age in the book&quot;. So, as far as we&#39;re concerned, we can say he&#39;s of age because it&#39;s a fanfic and we can do that. Well, that&#39;s my story, anyway, because I&#39;m more comfortable being associated with the thing that way, even if all I did was spork it.</p>

Several people have already sent him emails reading only &quot;meep&quot;. Apparently he forwarded the emails to the police. I cannot for a minute imagine the police will do anything, so I&#39;m very, very, very tempted to join in.</p>

            <p>The E-mail address is posted in public, on the school&#39;s official <a href="http://www.danvers.mec.edu/dhs.cfm">website</a>. The act of sending E-mail to that address definitely shouldn&#39;t be illegal.<br><br>The other legal issue one could run into is harassment - Massachusetts law (<a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/265-43a.htm">Chapter 265, Section 43A</a>) defines harassment as &quot;willfully and maliciously [engaging] in a knowing pattern of conduct or series of acts over a period of time directed at a specific person, which seriously alarms that person and would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress&quot;<br><br>Interpret that as you will - I could see someone making a whiny brat plea in front of a court, and given the way this idiot is responding to E-mails by forwarding them to the police, I wouldn&#39;t put it past him. However, felony harassment is something that&#39;s up to the prosecutor&#39;s office to indite for, rather than the principal of a high school, so I doubt anything would come of it.<br><br>So, yes, it could conceivably get us into trouble, just like conceivably, you could get hit by lightning while roller-skating. I&#39;d give them about equal odds. Just for a bit of protection, you might want to include more in the E-mail than just &quot;meep&quot; - something like <br>&quot;I protest your ban on the word &quot;meep&quot; and the associated infringement on the students&#39; first amendment rights to free speech. While I understand and agree that disruptions to classes are intolerable, I believe that banning the use of a word is both overreacting and ineffective - what the meep will you do if they start using &quot;the&quot; or &quot;math&quot; instead?&quot; <br>should lower the odds of legal action to something resembling those of getting hit by lightning while roller-skating <i>indoors</i>.<br><br>(disclaimer: I am not a lawyer)</p>

            <p>The author is quite right. I definitely identified with what she (he? didn&#39;t check) was saying. I never had the whole &#39;teenage heartthrob&#39; thing, but I did have a six-foot poster of Orlando Bloom as Legolas on my bedroom door for about a year. <s>SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP</s><br><br>Twilight is just another fad-- and yes, the books suck, though I don&#39;t know about the movies, but there&#39;s nothing wrong with girls having crushes on movie stars. It&#39;s just a thing, ya know? Especially the bit where she says &quot;We imagine what we&#39;d say to him if we were more confident,&quot; which is actually really sad, thinking about it. I can&#39;t be the only one on this &#39;Board who remembers middle school, and the fact that most guys were every -bit- as out of reach as Orlando Bloom or whoever the guy was at that point. There&#39;s something comforting, I think, in thinking about a guy who&#39;s unattainable to all the girls in your school, the popular and pretty girls just as much as the geeky, awkward kids.</p>

            <p>The main problem with fanfiction.net is that it&#39;s a bit akin to showing up at a big pot-luck dinner where about half the people who actually brought something can&#39;t cook, and the other half couldn&#39;t agree on a single theme, so you&#39;re stuck with a good three fourths of what&#39;s technically edible being lima bean ice cream or steak with a chocolate bar melted on top.  Then, just when you&#39;ve finally found a good hearty stew, and a loaf of bread to take a slice of to mop it up with, it turns out that the bread is actually angel food cake, and it&#39;s sitting there soaking in meat juices and you just want to cry, but suddenly you feel heartened because you see that somebody has brought a rather tasty fish dish you want to try, and then, just as you&#39;re arriving, you find that it&#39;s actually tofu, and you&#39;re allergic to tofu, and it&#39;s around then that you can&#39;t take it anymore and just go home to order out for pizza, but you know, next time you get an invitation, you&#39;re going to go again anyway, in the hopes that maybe you can find something to eat.</p>

            <p>(though I generally only use it when the headache is pushing towards affecting ability to function),<br><br>I&#39;ve heard putting a rubber band around your head works for some causes, because of blood vessels constricting, or something. Actually, someone I knew swore by it. Sometimes a hot shower can help, if it&#39;s a sinus thing, just because the steam helps soothe that kind of thing-- same with a bath, which is also relaxing. Or just drinking a glass of water or having something to eat-- I&#39;ve had headaches brought on by mild dehydration or fatigue, or overhunger, before. If all else fails, a nap often gets rid of headaches, too.</p>

            <p>Only it takes more of it to work, since it isn&#39;t concentrated. ... I can&#39;t remember if the raw salicylic acid in willow bark is more or less likely than aspirin to cause stomach irritation. Meh. Either way, pretty much the same thing.<br><br>If you&#39;re interested in an herbal remedy, though, you might look into skullcap (I&#39;ve also seen it spelled scullcap). It&#39;s associated with easing nervous tension, so if that&#39;s the underlying cause of the headache, it might help.<br><br>Just remember, using herbs is just like using any medication: they all have potential side effects, and they might not work for you the same as they do for other people. You also have to do your homework and look into drug interactions.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Take things like that too much though and they lose their effectiveness. Trust me. I used to take paracetamol/ibuprofen/aspirin (whatever I found first) as soon as I felt a headache coming on. Eventually I was having to take a double dose to get any effect. For that reason, I don&#39;t think pharmaceuticals should be the first resort for a headache.</p>
