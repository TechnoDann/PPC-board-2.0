            <p>Yes, the Chliever and Winston stories will actually have an overarching plot, hopefully culminating in an Emergency storyline that anyone can participate in.<br><br>Anyway, in mission 5, Chliever and Winston volunteer in Medical, and we are introduced to Agent Andreas de Bry, who will become the third most important character in my stories, after Chliever and Winston themselves. Then, they travel to Phantom of the Opera to sort out a Raoul replacement, ultimately running into one of the PPC&#39;s most mysterious foes. And what&#39;s this about an escaped canon? And why is there a pirate hiding in the pantry?<br><br><a href="http://agent-chliever.livejournal.com/2745.html"><a href="http://agent-chliever.livejournal.com/2745.html">http://agent-chliever.livejournal.com/2745.html</a></a><br><br>Enjoy!</p>

            <p>Just out of curiosity, did you contact Starwind about permission to use the Mystery Assassin? I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s been considered general use or you asked. I did enjoy the mission, though. Nice work.</p>

            <p>However, not everything was all mapped out nice and shiny. I did have an appearance in mind for him, though, beneath the mask. Do you have a gmail or MSN? We can discuss our ideas on it, I think we could actually work together on these plot ideas to make a pretty neat result, with all the ideas that&#39;ve been running around in my head. That is, if you&#39;re interested. Thought us cooperating on it would be better than unintentionally working against each other. I enjoy reading your missions, it&#39;d be a pleasure getting the chance.</p>

            <p>Hmmm.  &quot;Scouring a Blue Soap&quot; doesn&#39;t quote much.  It mentions the characters&#39; names and a few of the more annoying aspects of the story, but the original piece is both &quot;epic&quot; and rambly enough that quoting would be more trouble than it&#39;s worth.</p>

            <p>I only know the new series. May have to look into that.<br><br>Not sure whether the Sue actual said she was a Gallifreyan (would have to look up the fic again). I think the agents assumed it when she called herself a Time Lord. Tasmin then argued she could not be a Time Lord, because she had not received that gift from the Gallifreyans (That gift indeed leaves open the possibility for non-Gallifreyan Time Lords).</p>

            <p>Hi all! Ever since my roommate introduced me to the original PPC missions, I&#39;ve been a huge fan! As a *ahem* former sue writer myself...*sheepish look* I think this is such a great idea. Haha, maybe one of these days I can atone for my sins by doing some Sue slaying of my own :-P <br><br>At any rate, I just wanted to say hello! </p>

            <p>Wouldn&#39;t be able to use any of them, really. If there isn&#39;t any problem with character naming for OCs or original fic, there&#39;s a problem with actually writing the story. At this point, I can&#39;t really say I can write worth a damn. That&#39;s why I never bothered with Agents or Permission. Might consider trying to not suck at making fic, but not at the moment.

            <p>I feel your pain. I can never think of names. My first agent&#39;s name comes from the Shoebox Project. My second, Stevius, was a bugger to name - we decided we wanted a faun, and it took hours of debating details of backstory and trying to come up with vaguely Ancient-Greek-y names before we said &quot;to hell with it&quot; and settled on a name and a backstory that fitted.<br><br>As for in all other writings, I just ask Trojie for the names.

            <p>I comes bearing links. *drags out Big Bag O&#39; Links and digs through it*<br><br>First off is the link to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">Wiki</a>, a veritable fount of information for a newbie to read through. Especially helpful for you if you want to write missions would be the page on Permission (note the capital P).<br><br>I would advise against reading any <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>, unless you are of strong mind and stomach. Even the summaries have been known to give those of weaker constitution nightmares.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, not knowing what you have already managed to find, I have several links for you. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek) is a good place to start, as the PPC did many aeons ago. <s>What do you mean I&#39;m exaggerating?</s> <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">The Department of Geographical Aberrations</a> is another interesting place to visit, if you have the time and inclination. Also by hS is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/index.htm">Tangled Webs</a> site, which contains backstory for the PPC as an organisation. If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be. And last, but most definitely not least, <a href="http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/65922.html">Response Centre 45</a> is where Trojie and Pads&#39; missions are archived.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay here.

            <p>The combat can be really awkward , especially when you&#39;re doing combos. Mounted fighting is absolutely awful, because there&#39;s no fluidity to the movements and you get knocked off if an enemy so much as looks at you.<br><br>Plus, the horrific voice acting really puts me off. It sounds like the guys they got to do it didn&#39;t even make an effort.</p>

            <p>I think the voice acting comment is unfair. Hugo Weaving was all right as he&#39;s actually Elrond. The other voice actors, frankly, I didn&#39;t even notice them (except the Witch-king, because I hated every part of that stupid battle). The only actor (barring Weaving) who put in an effort is also the only one who shouldn&#39;t have done. &quot;Use your special arrows!&quot; No! I won&#39;t! The special arrows are ridiculous! Three arrows at once? I kill you!<br><br>And mounted combat was moronic. I&#39;ve driven tricycles with more power. In regards to combos, what combos? Warrior class&#39;s special ability is &quot;Rapid Death.&quot; Ironically, the best class is the Mage that shouldn&#39;t exist.</p>

            <p>It was suggested I post this here, since it is very much an amusing thing, and we here are the sorts of people who&#39;ve likely wanted to carry out such an arrest.

It contains a truly epic retort.<br><br>ucemujeproblem: <br>The music is quite unadeqite..<br>badger5079: <br>...as is your spelling.<br>ucemujeproblem: <br>Its the spelling police!<br>I surender<br>badger5079: <br>You are hereby charged with the offense of spelling without a permit.

            <p>As those of you who have read my fifth misson know, Chliever got his fat green hinder kicked six ways to Sunday by the Mystery Assassin. As such, he needs to get checked out at the infirmary, get his sword fixed, and fill out the respective paperworks for a Medical appointment, a weapon repair, a mission gone wrong report, a stolen kill report, an enemy encounter report, and try to stall so he doesn&#39;t have to fill out an &quot;escaped canon hiding in the laundry room&quot; report or a &quot;pirate appearing from the pantry&quot; report. The PPC being what it is, he&#39;ll probably be tied up in any combination of Medical, the Armory, or the Fern&#39;s office for at least a few days.<br><br>So, anyone who needs a temporary partner is welcome to Winston.</p>

            <p>To the point: I&#39;ve been trying to decide on a Flower to head a subdivision in the DoSAT, the Testing and Application Division. I had settled on fireweed, mostly for the sake of humor (considering it grows, as the name suggests, mostly in burnt areas). However, fireweed is known in Britain (and I know British English is our preferred mode) as rosebay willowherb, which is all well and good, but which also lessens the punch of the humor.<br><br>So which name would I be better off using?</p>

            <p>Two of those divisions (A/V and Biotic Materials) were already there, as was the Armory notation.

He said it was probably him (as the character), due to a lack of other active named Agents/Technicians in the DoSAT (though the character has only had one mission written so far, hence why in-universe it&#39;s a little unclear why he got the position).

I found you, I brought you <s>home</s> a&#39;Board, and I&#39;m keeping you. {; p<br><br>My <i>Tolkien Companion</i>, which my wonderful fiance found for me, defines lembas as follows:<br><br>The Sindarin name for a kind of travellers&#39; food or &quot;way-bread,&quot; baked by the Elves of Lothlorien. It resembled <i>cram</i> (the waybread of the Men of Dale) in purpose but not in effect, being quite delicious and greatly sustaining, the more so if it was not mingled with other foods. It consisted of light-golden meal-cakes which kept fresh for many days if left in their mallorn-leaf wrappings. (J.E.A.

            <p>Hello lovely people.<br><br>Owing to the small and fancy nature of my high school, my graduation ceremony (yesterday! I finally have my diploma!) included a brief blurb read aloud by the Head of School regarding each graduating senior. Mine was almost entirely to do with my writing which, if predictable, was nonetheless gratifying. I have since been meditating on how the great distance I have come throughout my eighteen years. One of my only kindergarten memories involves the intense jealousy I felt towards my friend, who had won some little award or other for her short story. I did <i>not</i> understand why I couldn&#39;t write. Really, writing was a closed book to me up until the age of twelve, despite my love of books themselves.<br><br>I&#39;m sure you&#39;re wondering where I&#39;m going with this, so I’ll get to the point. The idea that I too could write only really took hold after I began to read fanfiction. Some of it was very bad, some was very good, and all was anonymously critiqued. Naturally, my first attempts at writing my own stories regarding my favorite books were <i>awful</i>. However, with time and practice comes improvement, and my own improvement was rapid, urged along by a solid stream of encouragement, flames, and helpful critiques.<br><br>The story goes on of course, but I would be curious to hear some of your responses to this question: What role does/has fanfiction played in your life? For me, it ignited a fierce passion that I&#39;ve come to rely on immensely; how has it affected you?<br><br>- MB</p>

            <p>In my case, I was writing before I discovered fanfiction. For me, it was initially a way to bond with the small corners of fandom in which I found myself--first for the game &quot;Creatures,&quot; and then more significantly for &quot;Farscape.&quot; My first Farscape fic was also the first story of any significant length that I actually managed to finish. It&#39;s not great, but I did it, and I&#39;ll forever know that I can.<br><br>Furthermore, that fic led directly to joining the PPC thanks to one of the helpful people on the Friends and Defenders of Pilot message board, who pointed out in the kindest possible way that my original character in the fic was probably a Mary-Sue. Not knowing the stigma attached to the name, I readily agreed that yes, that was probably right. Later, I discovered Fanfiction.net, which led to OFUM, which led to the PPC. And I&#39;ve been here since.<br><br>I still have one fanfic that I feel I ought to finish, even though it&#39;s been years since I started, but overall, as I&#39;ve sporked, I&#39;ve drifted away from fanfic and tried to apply my skills to my own work. I have a nice little collection of vignettes now, and a full-scale fantasy world in the making.<br><br>Fanfiction and the sporking of it also made me realize that I&#39;m better than most people at spelling and grammar. I&#39;ve worked on becoming very good at it in the hope of turning it into an editing career. That way, theoretically, I&#39;ll be able to make a living, because I know I won&#39;t be able to do it writing. I just don&#39;t have the consistency for it.<br><br>One downside of getting heavily involved with the art and craft of good writing is that it has made me realize some of my favorite writers as a young person are actually not that great. The board has also confirmed that I will never be able to love any fantasy work as much as I love &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; which for me embodies technical perfection as well as masterly world-building and story-telling. On the other hand, the PPC message board is responsible for introducing me to some of my new favorite authors, particularly Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, who have taught me that it is still possible to be original and to be damn good at it. They give me hope.<br><br>On that note, I think I&#39;ve talked more than enough. ^_^; Kudos and hugs if you actually bothered to read the whole post.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>and hugs, of course...<br><br>Being new to all this, I&#39;m not really sure what to say.  I can appreciate all that you guys are doing for writing, and I really enjoy reading all of it, but I&#39;m not much of a writer myself, as I was sad to discover.  I have tried, and failed, and will probably continue to try on occasion.  I read like a fiend, but the fact remains that I am not original or creative in a literary sense.<br><br>That being said, I really REALLY admire everyone who can, even if it skinks horribly and is filled with Mary-Sue&#39;s and impossible plot holes, (fill it with a raccoon, Neshomeh!) and the author can&#39;t &#39;speel to sav they&#39;re live&#39;.  <br><br>This is not to say that I am for brain-melting paradoxes and &#39;waterfalls of hair&#39;.  However, I am for learning, and I&#39;m glad that there are people (and other beings) out here like you, protecting what deserves it and helping what doesn&#39;t.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;ll keep writing, maybe I&#39;ll finish that fanfic for Neshomeh someday (Yes, yes, I&#39;m on it.

            <p>Similarly, the PPC is responsible for introducing me to Terry Pratchett (my obsession with Neil Gaiman is simply a result of my comic book geekiness)... and draining my bank account as I desperately purchased every book he has ever written :P<br><br><i>&quot;One downside of getting heavily involved with the art and craft of good writing is that it has made me realize some of my favorite writers as a young person are actually not that great.&quot;</i><br><br>I found this to be an interesting point, as I probably tend to revere those childhood authors more than they deserve...

            <p>Is Anne McCaffrey. It&#39;s hard to explain, because I&#39;m a big Pern fan, but there are things about her writing that really bug me, especially her more recent work (and don&#39;t even get me started on her son). Her Acorna series especially turned into one big Suefest, and I couldn&#39;t keep reading the books. I partly blame her change of co-authors for that, but still. I liked &quot;The Rowan&quot; and I&#39;ve read all the books in the Talent/Tower and Hive series, but the more I think about it, the more a lot of the main characters look like Sues and Stus to me. I never liked the Crystal Singer books because they were all about how special the main character was.<br><br>I can&#39;t think of any other specific authors that I loved as a child, but Diane Duane and Brian Jacques also come to mind. With Duane, it&#39;s the same sort of thing as McCaffrey: her ideas are fantastic, but her execution could be improved. As for Jacques, he created a great world, but by the time I started reading his books (middle school), I was old enough to notice pretty quickly that he recycled the same plot in almost every book, and I lost interest.<br><br>I don&#39;t fault CS Lewis. His writing, at least in the Narnia books, is the result of the time he lived in and the fact that they were meant for young children, not that he didn&#39;t know what he was doing. He certainly did. I just happen to like his contemporary, Tolkien, better. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh, who doesn&#39;t remember reading Beverly Cleary or AA Milne.</p>

            <p>Ohhh, I do see what you mean. Seeing as I have a six year old sister, when I think &quot;childhood authors&quot; I tend to think of books associated with that age group (ie AA Milne, author of Winnie the Pooh, I&#39;m sure you did read it once :P). I definitely experienced the something similar with Tamora Pierce&#39;s books - not quite so much her first few in the Song of the Lioness series, but some of her others. A strong female character isn&#39;t a bad thing by any means, but she tends to cross the borderline into boring and stereotypical, as I only realised later when I attempted to reread some of them.<br><br>I haven&#39;t read any recent McCaffrey, so I&#39;ll bear that in mind... I recall her fondly, so it&#39;s probably best that I don&#39;t taint those memories. <br><br>- MB -</p>

            <p>despite never having read any EU novel ever. God, do we not want to go into what emerged (*shudders*). Then I got into Harry Potter badfic, hit a bout of plagiarism (*turns tomato red*) and then died on the Internet. Then I returned, deleted <i>everything</i> and all became good in the world as the plagiarism incident ironically made me better.

            <p>At least you learned something from it. Plagiarism is a dreadful, icky thing, and it&#39;s probably (definitely) for the best that you dealt with it via fanfiction, where the consequences were minimal. Or rather, minimal when compared with expulsion from school and such.</p>

            <p>While most people here seem to have had the same problems I encountere when trying to write, there is a bit of a difference; they got better at it <i>before</i> joining the Board.

            <p>Fanfiction, for me, was a way to really LEARN. I mean, I started when I was thirteen, and it&#39;s been a few years. For some reason, I lacked the ability to develop my own ideas. I mean, besides the fact that my writing wasn&#39;t all that good, I honestly could not come up with an original story setup that was actually good.<br><br>Then I found fanfiction.<br><br>Of course, it wasn&#39;t an instant thing. I still wasn&#39;t a great writer, and my first few stories either crashed into the ground or staggered and twitched for a while before dying. Through fanfiction, I didn&#39;t really NEED to come up with an original idea, because I could use other people&#39;s ideas to practice my writing style and my plot-developing skills. And I found that, as time went on, my writing improved, and I actually used fanfiction to create my own original plotline. The best part was the fact that complete strangers could take an objective view on my writing, and really tell me how well I was doing.<br><br>A particular point of significance was when I discovered that Happy Tree Friends had its own section on the Pit. I don&#39;t know why, but it must have unlocked something, and I immediately spewed forth a story that, in hindsight, could probably be much better, but it was still significantly more original than the others. It was also the first multi-chapter fanfic I actually finished. In fact, I think I&#39;ve had the most success in the HTF fandom.<br><br>Currently, I&#39;m writing my own original fantasy. The plot is basically a combination of characters, plot points, and ideas from my Happy Tree Friends fanfics, as well as some issues in the Real World. I&#39;m pretty confident about it.</p>

And I sort of dropped the idea.<br><br>Fanfiction hit me like a ROCK at the age of seventeen, and I promptly turned out several mediocre-to-poor slashfics, and then the PPC, and then my actual writing declined in quantity as more and more of my time was spent sporking. <br><br>However, I credit sporking with teaching me what is and is not good writing practice, and showing me what I like and don&#39;t like as a reader, making it easy for me to make judgements on what and what not to write. <br><br>My long-term association with Pads started off in fandom, and now we both write and spork together.

            <p>I have some confessions to make.<br><br>Firstly, I don&#39;t care about your drama. Your &quot;epic&quot; story arcs, your ZOMG SOOOO AWSUM Agents, your OMG THAR IS AN EMERGENCY WE GOTTA FIGHT AN HAVE AWSUM STUFF HAPPEN...did you ever stop to consider that PPC missions are meant to be...well, normal life for an Agent, as normal as the whole thing can be? You go in, you rant a bit, you snark, you kill the Sue, you leave. It&#39;s what we do. We&#39;re not here to attract attention; we&#39;re here to get the job done.<br><br>Secondly, I am not impressed by your big weapons. Please remember that we do this for the comedy and for the &#39;verses. And you know what? Being the underdog is funny. We&#39;re not supposed to be superior. It&#39;s why we call it the Duty. Because that&#39;s what it is...a duty, something that we want to do not because we get to be all flashy and use big weapons, but because worlds that we love are all the better for it. The job itself...we hate. But we do it for the effects that the work we do has, and people seem to have forgotten that.<br><br>Thirdly, I&#39;d like to beat some sense into whoever decided that we should have Emergencies every other month. One of the things that makes something special is that it is few and far between, and this applies greatly to Emergencies. Once they happen annually, or even bi and trianually, they&#39;re not special anymore. They&#39;re boring and become trivial...which goes completely against the whole concept of an Emergency. It ties back into the comedy versus drama thing: drama is great, but it&#39;s not what the PPC is all about. Not to mention that it completely messes up the status quo. Sure, the death of Makes-Things was sad and plot-driving, but we needed him.<br><br>Fourthly, I understand that you really, really want to add to PPC canon, but don&#39;t forget that you do that just by writing missions. Consider leaving major decisions, like what Flower is going to be Head of which Department/Division up to the people who are directly affected by said decisions. Namely, the people writing for said Departments and Divisions. Think about it this way: you add a Flower to a Department that you don&#39;t evern write for. Good for you, you&#39;ve just added to the canon, but you&#39;re not doing anything with it. But then someone wants to write in that Departemnt, and they&#39;re the first to do so. Wouldn&#39;t it maybe be their right, as authors actually working with that Flower, to decide the specifics of said Flower? They&#39;re the ones feeling the affects of the decision. Now, I&#39;m not saying that only certain people should be allowed to add to the canon. I&#39;m saying that certain things should be left to the people that they directly apply to.<br><br>Fifthly, I really don&#39;t care how many tropes you have in your mission. I don&#39;t care if your Agent has a BFG or CMOA...it&#39;s a mission, frak it, and frankly, for all of your tropes your sporkings are lacking. Bear in mind that there is a reason that something is on TVTropes: it&#39;s cliche and used all the time. So when you write it just like you see it on TVTropes, that&#39;s what your mission becomes: cliche and boring.<br><br>Finally, your originality stinks. Cool, your Agent is a taller-than-average man who can&#39;t be beat at fights physical or magical, and is also a very experienced Agent that nothing surprises anymore who is somewhat angsty because he has a bad past. Does he have any character flaws? Any little quirks that liven him up a bit? Does he have a unique personality? No? Then why should I care about him? And why is he any better than the Stus that we try so hard to kill? There&#39;s been a sudden influx of Agents that are more Sue/Stu than person, and it&#39;s not only saddening but bloody hypocritical. Take another look at your Agents...maybe you&#39;ll see that their originality is only on the surface. If so, I hope you&#39;ll do what you can to make them a true character.<br><br>There you have it. I hope it&#39;s been enlightening, because, at the moment, I want very little to do with the PPC community and where it&#39;s heading. I&#39;m not saying that you&#39;re terrible people, I&#39;m just saying that the actual PPCing itself is looking pretty shabby compared to how it was a few years ago when I first joined. So now I&#39;m challenging you to look at yourself, to say, &quot;I can do better than this,&quot; and then to proceed to do better than this (and don&#39;t think that I consider myself exempt from this, because I definitely don&#39;t).<br><br>Good luck,<br><br>Sara</p>

            <p>I think everyone just needs to sit back, examine the problems, and try to find some solutions before things blow over completely. It&#39;s perfectly natural for a community as large as the PPC to have differences in opinions, and it can&#39;t be helped that someone is going to take issue withwhat someone else does.<br><br>But talking it out is probably the best way to deal with a big problem like this, because most times it dies out (as Huinesoron said) and generally clears the air. If people have a problem with something, getting that out in the open is probably better than not saying what you feel and letting it simmer away. Letting small irritations build up into something larger is never a good thing, and the PPC has weathered worse storms.</p>

            <p>No squick, no excessive gore, no genderbending. Just some agents splatting Sues with a minimum of drama and maximum of snark. Trying to keep the rating down too, as my agents developed the habit of cursing too much during the squickfic missions and I need to do some more that everyone can enjoy. (Will have to lampshade that in a future mission: &quot;It&#39;s R-rated. Obligatory swearing is obligatory.&quot; Excuse the troping.)<br><br>While on that topic, I can promise I will NEVER EVER use rape as a punchline again. I have a very dark sense of humour and I&#39;d been reading a lot of Something Positive around the time I wrote the missions with Drip and the Trees. I am aware it&#39;s not funny in real life, and even in fiction it&#39;s not funny if something which counts as a person is on the giving or receiving end (unless it&#39;s a Fanficrants entry about how poorly-written it is, of course). I don&#39;t personally think it has the same dynamic if the victim&#39;s a much-hated badfic character and the attacker&#39;s a tree because nobody has ever been attacked by a tree in real life and therefore nobody can really be reminded of bad experiences or anything by it, but that was funny *one* time and I&#39;ll not use it again because I am not Randal Milholland and can&#39;t push my luck with it. Besides, the agents should have learned their lesson from whatever hell FicPsych put them through. They DID get in trouble for that in-universe, I just didn&#39;t make much of it onscreen because I couldn&#39;t find a way to make it funny or interesting.</p>

            <p>Now this makes me glad I haven&#39;t gone and tried to write my own missions. Otherwise, Glod knows I would have been flamed to hell and back at some point. I&#39;m sure that with my utter lack of writing experience, I would have ended up making some of the biggest Agent!Sues in PPC history. This is precisely the reason why I decided to never attempt PPCings before first gaining the ability to write good characters and stories. If I do end up trying, however, I&#39;ll try to keep this in mind and avoid that sort of thing.</p>

I like my characters, including their abilities, which are part of who they are. I like using them for this. I don&#39;t believe they&#39;re Sue/Stu.

            <p>Force-users aren&#39;t a problem. The problem comes if they&#39;re, eg, Force users who use wands to channel the Force (although, considering we&#39;ve got the Nightsisters, even that&#39;s not too farfetched), or if they use the Force to beat the point of the PPC around the head, or just Force-choke every &#39;Sue from a safe distance, or whatever.

            <p>Before I begin, I would like to warn anyone who plans on reading this that I&#39;m not very experienced with the PPC, since I&#39;ve only been here for about two months. I also tend to ramble.<br>I haven&#39;t written any missions, but I really hope I can keep these things in mind for them. I&#39;m not planning on writing any emergencies. Sheesh. I thought the point was to kill the Sues and point out the flaws of the badfics. In fact, after I read TOS, I was dismayed to find out that Makes-Things had been killed nearly a year earlier from when I found the PPC. I guess it&#39;s stuck that way now, at least for me.<br>Personally, I like the way TOS was set up: fairly standard with extra humor and twists added in. There was that blue unicorn deal with Lux, a vacation at the OFUM, the barbeque, a few agent changes, and a department change, among other things. Both agents had their blatant flaws and good attributes.<br>Hopefully, since this came up before I began any missions, I can write out the mental storyline better. I don&#39;t want my characters to become total Sues. I shudder to think of what would happen then. <br>Anyway, I agree on most of these views and I really hope I don&#39;t end up tripping up on one of them. I just want to write and take a whack at the badfic I loathe. Good luck to all other newbies who plan to write missions!</p>

            <p>...agreed, agreed, agreed. The reason I haven&#39;t been around here much has nothing to do with the influx of newbies (hell, we <i>need</i> newbies, and I for one welcome them with open arms) as much as it does with the sheer amount of drama and random PPC-wide emergencies that have been going on for quite a while. <br><br>And frankly, I don&#39;t care for it.

            <p>I know, it sounds like a stupid idea and you&#39;re going to yell at me, but hear me out. There <i>is</i> precedent for dead PPC staff being brought back to life (for example, all of Team Phoenix, Elanor, and Dafydd, as well as technically Tawaki if you consider him turning into a Time Lord to be a form of coming back from the dead), and there are canonical ways to resurrect the dead in some continua. I&#39;ve actually toyed with the idea of a Medical worker obsessed with figuring out how to bring him back to life, though I might or might not use that character. <br><br>The point is, we could get around the issue by simply acknowledging that he died, but bringing him back through a canonical resurrection method. We might not be able to say he never died, but we could easily get around the issue by finding a way to restore him to life. Alternately, we could bring him back as a ghost, since it&#39;s obviously possible for such to happen to Agents and Staff. It&#39;d actually make sense that his spirit might hang around DoSAT, I&#39;d think, considering his name was synonymous with that Department while he was alive. It&#39;s just an idea.<br><br>*braces self*</p>

            <p>It&#39;s just that, with people thinking about that and the fact that I <i>know</i> people don&#39;t like Makes-Things being dead (in fact, one of my first memories of the PPC was how entertaining I found Makes-Things, I was really shocked when I found out he&#39;d died during my absence), so I thought I&#39;d suggest it. It did seem simple enough to just bring him back/have him come back as a ghost. The canon doesn&#39;t have to be retconned that way, but we still get Makes-Things.<br><br>As for the second bit, I must admit I&#39;ve thought about that sort of thing, but I&#39;ve always intended for anything like that to be at least a few years down the line if I even did it, not something that happens right now. A lot of the time, haven&#39;t intended on it at all, and it&#39;s just been idle thought. Actually been debating whether it&#39;d be better to have absolutely nothing happen in 2012 (making the Catastrophe theory look silly) or to have something happen then (to go along with it). Either way, my point is I don&#39;t intend on doing something like that at the time, and any plans I might have aren&#39;t supposed to happen for a long while.</p>

            <p>Whose idea WAS it to kill Makes-Things? Personally I think it was about as good an idea as installing a screen door in an airplane. I read some of the OS before joining up, and I thought M-T was an awesome character, because for some bizarre reason I thought he was very lets-give-him-a-noogy cute. So I developed a bunch of fun ideas for how to have him interact with my agents, only to look him up on the PPC Wiki and find out the guy had died almost a year before. Talk about disappointment. Personally, I&#39;m taking a He&#39;s Just Hiding stand on the whole thing, which is why I choose not to mention him in my missions.</p>

I did not like it one bit that a single PPCer just decided to kill Makes-Things, but on the other hand, Jay and Acacia aren&#39;t around anymore, and leaving everything of theirs untouched and stagnant is not a good idea, either; the story of the PPC as a whole is active, and shouldn&#39;t be locked down in parts. <br><br>That said, I think these sorts of decisions can be made, but should be made by group consensus. </p>

It&#39;s only natural for that to happen, especially since not even PPC HQ itself can be considered constant.<br><br>But Makes-Things is pretty much a PPC regular and was (at least in my opinion) an integral part of HQ, and killing him off wasn&#39;t exactly the brightest of moves.

            <p>If we&#39;re indulging in a group confessional here, Boarder! Trojie and Pads will raise their hands to excessive use of unexplained in-jokes and PPC drama - we have had a non-PPC friend say she felt like she was wandering into a long-running soap opera mid-season, after reading one of our missions. This is clearly not a welcoming practice, and we will be putting up a general post on Trojie&#39;s LJ explaining background and backstory in the interests of clarifying things for newcomers.<br><br>Also we are guilty of allowing a Potterverse AU character to use Potterverse spells in other magical continua, although in our defence, this was only in continua so warped that their own laws of behavior weren&#39;t working in the fic, and the spells were used directly to counter the effects of a Suethor, for instance, giving Lucy Pevensie a sex-change. Said Potterverse AU character is also an implausible recruitment/resurrection of a canon character. Oops.<br><br>We&#39;re also very, very guilty of Not Taking Things Seriously, playing les buggeures risibles in missions and on the Board, seeking out, deliberately, the worst smutfic missions we can find and then downplaying their disgustingness, having Agents specifically tailored to suit their jobs enough that squicking them is tricky (one a biology fanatic, one from such a bloody bizarre AU with regards to sex and sexuality that a lot of things are &#39;normal&#39; to her...) and a large number of adopted animals, CAFs, minis, children, and Agents in general in our repertoire.<br><br>We sound like we&#39;re taking the piss towards the end of this, and this is not technically true. What we are trying to do is admit to failings without moping, and striving towards improvement without losing our senses of humour. <br><br>We have also recently been found guilty of posting missions unbetaed. We&#39;re very, very sorry. </p>

            <p>As I haven&#39;t really been around, the main thing I have to offer is the point of view of a (sort of) oldbie who has recently returned, and therefore is able to offer a fairly accurate perspective of what has changed.<br><br>Unfortunately, I&#39;m going to have to agree with Sara on many of your points. As I&#39;ve been desperately been trying to catch up with things via wiki, the number of &quot;emergencies&quot; is overwhelming. From what I can see, everybody wants to be able to say &quot;my character was there when...&quot; and the fact is, not everybody is going to be internetfamous all the time. I&#39;ve also noticed the trend of increasingly Sueish agents, which is a problem. As Sara pointed out, these are supposed to be regular people doing a job that they care about. It&#39;s difficult, it&#39;s frustrating, the food is awful and the pay is low. We do it because we love canon.<br><br>Also, something everybody may want to keep in mind; fellow PPC&#39;ers are not the only ones reading your missions. As I&#39;ve been recently reminded, my old (not particularly good or original I realise) PPC fanfictions drew a good handful of people to the PPC who perhaps would otherwise never have heard of it. As I&#39;ve been trying to catch up on what&#39;s been going on, something I&#39;ve noticed is that your stories are SO full of in-jokes and PPC drama that anybody who isn&#39;t heavily involved in the PPC is probably going to very quickly lose interest.<br><br>Hopefully this thread doesn’t disintegrate into a massive, pointless flame war. I feel that Sara has brought up some very valid points which are worth looking into and discussing.</p>

            <p>True, non-PPCers will read our missions, but people unfamiliar with <i>Star Trek</i> might fall into the middle of a <i>Deep Space Nine</i> episode about the Dominion War - the writers aren&#39;t requried to re-explain the history of the Federation in ever episode. That&#39;s what running series <i>do</i>. We don&#39;t need high ratings to keep going - we don&#39;t have to pay for advertisements - and essentially, we are writing for ourselves, so if someone loses interest... a shame, but it shouldn&#39;t run our &#39;lives&#39;, methinks. <br><br>That said, we could sidestep most of the problem by just putting an author&#39;s note with a link to The Original Series at the top of every mission. <br><br>Just my two cents. </p>

            <p>Well, in mine and Trojie&#39;s case, a link to TOS wouldn&#39;t help much - it&#39;d explain the PPC set-up, but most of our in-jokes come from the fact we&#39;ve so many missions under our belts. And we like to have preamble and closing scenes about the agents, so there&#39;s been a lot of character development, and it&#39;s there the confusion comes in. We&#39;ve a nice tidy sticky post with links to all our missions, but that&#39;s a lot to wade through. So we&#39;ve been putting together a brief introduction to the RC#45 Soap Opera, for anyone who wanders in and is hideously confused. Hopefully it&#39;ll help.</p>

            <p>Yeah, those were the type of in-jokes I was mainly referring to, not so much the history of the PPC itself. <br><br>Sedri: Yes, we are writing for ourselves. However, it&#39;s simply a characteristic of good writing to make the details of your story easily accessible to your readership. If we continue with your Star Trek metaphor, no, they don&#39;t explain the entire history of the Federation in each episode. However, when put into context, the events of the story are generally pretty easy to figure out. </p>

            <p>The world would be pretty boring if we all found ourselves in constant agreement, after all.

            <p>I&#39;m pretty new here, so I don&#39;t presume to know much, but...<br><br>I dunno, I think using that same formula makes things a bit monotonous. I mean, it&#39;s often stressed that killing Sues and exorcising Wraiths and such is dangerous work, but a lot of times agents just, as you say, go in, snark a bit, kill the threat, and leave. I mean, shouldn&#39;t we spice things up a bit by actually showing that what our Agents are doing can be life-threatening as well as sanity-threatening?<br><br>And also, &quot;Tropes are devices and conventions that a writer can reasonably rely on as being present in the audience members&#39; minds and expectations. On the whole, tropes are not clichйs.&quot; That was quoted from TVTropes. Just because it&#39;s a trope doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s automatically a cliche. I mean, there are some tropes like the Big No and other Discredited Tropes that are considered overused, but not all of them are.<br><br>With the Emergencies and the big weapons and stuff, I agree. So far I&#39;ve only seen one of the former, and I don&#39;t consider big weapons to be much fun. But I don&#39;t really see many of the SueAgents. Or maybe I just have low standards. I don&#39;t know.<br><br>Just wanted to put in my own two cents.</p>

            <p>Not necessarily on an HQ-wide scale. Just buggering up the mission and allowing the Sue to escape, if only briefly, or succeeding in the mission but revealing their existence to some canon characters in a way which takes a little more effort than instant neuralysation to fix (say, in a place with security cameras).<br><br>Or more non-mission-centric snippets about the agents interacting with each other. Some of the agents have families, how does one deal with HQ life and raising kids? (Molly is technically a nursery inhabitant but she&#39;s had so many temporary bans that she&#39;s practically living with S&amp;S fulltime.)</p>

            <p>I think you might be over-exaggerating a bit with regards to the OMG EMERGENCIES. The only one I recall in recent memory was the 2008 Invasion, which was over a year ago. The April Fool&#39;s Day Invasion was a one-off gag, and the Macrovirus Crisis was essentially in the background.<br><br>I haven&#39;t really noticed any fixation on big weapons, to be honest. Chliever has a pretty big sword, but he&#39;s a pretty big guy and said type of sword is standard issue for his race. Maybe I&#39;ve just been reading the wrong missions...<br><br>Your third point is the same as your first, incidentally.<br><br>I&#39;ve made up a couple heads for Departments, but only because I was sure those Departments would otherwise never be used again. Does ANYONE remember the All-Purpose Department. I thought not.<br><br>You misjudge TVTropes, I see. Tropes are simply writing devices. They&#39;re not synonymous with cliches. If they&#39;re used too much, they become cliched. Not all tropes are cliched, as they&#39;re only cliched when they become boring. If we were boring, we&#39;d all be cliches.<br><br>And really, I&#39;ve noticed no increasing Suvianism in Agents. Perhaps you&#39;re overreacting?<br><br>Decent argument, but not without a few holes. I hope I don&#39;t come off as flamey.</p>

            <p>I give fair warning: Not all of this is directed at Chliever. Just most of it. I&#39;m saying what I&#39;m saying and I&#39;m not holding back. I don&#39;t care if someone gets hurt feelings at this point, people&#39;s blood is boiling too much in the background for me to care for hurt feelings.<br><br>That&#39;s not a decent argument, that&#39;s an excellent one. <br><br>And I&#39;m going to be honest before everyone right here and right now and say you&#39;re one of the ones I have the biggest beefs with, with what she&#39;s said.<br><br>How can it be possible for something to be forgotten when there&#39;s so many people and there&#39;s been use of that department for spin offs before? And I stated what Sara said to someone before; just because a spot is empty doesn&#39;t mean we need to fill it before someone else does. Just because you can do something in theory doesn&#39;t mean you ought.<br><br>What the hell is a Spirit Tree, and why would one department have two Flowers from the same continuum? Why the hell would the PPC let in an &#39;Elder Evil Tree&#39;? Isn&#39;t that just asking for trouble? Not only is it evil, apparently, it&#39;s also an elder evil. EVIL THINGS. THEY ARE BAD. EVIL THINGS GENERALLY ARE A BAD IDEA IN THE PPC. <br><br>Why the hell do we have a sentient orangutan in the PPC? And if an Agent has the same name as a canon and isn&#39;t that canon or isn&#39;t secretly that canon or some insane gone round the bend person thinking they&#39;re that canon, IT IS BEING DONE WRONG.<br><br>Using &#39;he has a cold, almost uncaring demeanor, quite odd for a doctor.&#39; as a description? POOR. WHAT SORT OF DOCTOR, HOW IS IT ODD, WHY DOES THIS EVEN MATTER?<br><br>And, your main Agent, Chliever, is a GIANT PLAGUE BEARING BEING FROM A CANON OF GRIMDARK. And is nice. And &#39;as a member of Floaters, Chliever takes great pride in his versatility, and firmly considers himself one of &quot;the best.&#39;   And you handwave all of the potential aughdanger from him. Last I checked, the PPC does have a sense of preservation. A poor and misdirected one at times, but there is a great deal of &quot;I WOULD LIKE TO LIVE, AND STAY HEALTHY OUTSIDE OF THE OCCASIONAL STUNTS I PULL ON MISSIONS BECAUSE THE SUE WAS TARGETTING MY LO.&quot; I honestly can&#39;t see many agents wanting to stay in the same building as something like it, sanitized or not. Hell. SUE. STU. AIRY OO OR WTFEVER.<br><br>On the subject of Emergencies: WHEN PEOPLE KEEP COMING UP WITH SOME EMERGENCY OR ANOTHER THAT IS GOING TO DOOOOOOOM DOOOOM US ALLLL WE&#39;RE DOOOOOOOOOOM-ED, YOU KNOW WHAT? It gets boring. It is nonexciting. It becomes expected. Formulaic. Because no one is actually going to let it actually DOOOOOOOOOM the PPC. And amazingly enough, people are going to actually, you know. Have the Agents save the day. Against impressive odds. Despite everything. <br><br>Sueish, much?<br><br>Emergencies I can think of off the top of my head since the 2008:<br><br>Macrovirus, Sue invasion, mega mission because of a SUE THAT WOULD DOOOOOOOM US ALLL ALLL I SAY, Gender Bender, Fake Emergency of April Fool&#39;s.<br><br><br>And your whole damn reply to Sara? Goddamn, man, I haven&#39;t read such a condescending response since I reread what I&#39;m writing right now.<br><br>Continuing on, I have a huge beef with a lot of you. Some of you seem to have forgotten manners, like asking for permission before borrowing someone else&#39;s agent characters (Cassie. Who knows who else), writing boring missions (Ugolino, Cheliever, KGarrett because it seems someone told him interesting bits that build character SHOULD BE GOT RID OF), not writing missions at all (ME), too afraid to state your own opinion on matters because you&#39;re afraid of being disliked or not being welcome on the board if you do it(Once again, KG, Trojie, Vixenmage).<br><br>I&#39;m stating this right out.<br><br>I think a lot of people are making this place suck. And because everyone here wants to be nice, they don&#39;t say anything to all the idiots that ignore the politely given suggetions, they politely withdraw and leave rather than huring feelings. STOP THAT. COME BACK HERE. DON&#39;T MAKE ME COME AFTER YOU.<br><br>AND YOU PEOPLE MAKING EVERYONE LEAVE? UGOLINO, KG, CHELIEVER, JOE, WHATSYOURFACE. <br><br>SHAPE UP OR I SHALL GO AFTER YOU TOO. LISTEN TO PEOPLE. ACTUALLY TAKE ADVICE. LOOK AT WHAT YOU ARE DOING COMPARED TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE.<br><br>I have a lot more to say, but this is enough for now.<br><br>Besides this:<br><br>OOGAH BOOGAH I&#39;M COMING AFTER EVERYONE.<br><br></p>

            <p>Spirit Trees and Evil Trees are rival types of sentient trees. Spirit Trees are kind and helpful and can teleport you places (provided you prove you&#39;re a friend of the gnomes) including to Evil Trees. Evil Trees aren&#39;t exactly malicious, just hideous and unruly; you can try to keep them under control for training. <br><br>I thought it would be a good idea for the two corners of DAVD to have rival heads and before you knew it, out came these two. You can use them. The EET is new, remember (because Evil Trees are a recent update in RuneScape), so he wouldn&#39;t be around during Crashing Down, which could also explain why DAVD(i) reports directly to the Big Thorn there.<br><br></p>

            <p>So the Spirit Tree is generally helpful and probably lends a hand in DAVD Medical when patients need moving. The EET is more disgruntled, but still an effective Division Head; he may also be prone to inflicting bizarre punishments on Agents who mess up (since this is the PPC, and bizarre is fairly RuneScapish too, from what I know).

            <p>Seriously, July, calm down a little. You make a number of good points, but they don&#39;t need to be in the form of personal attacks. I know you were ranting (and Tulkas knows I want to do the same thing sometimes) but &quot;everyone here wants to be nice&quot; isn&#39;t (and shouldn&#39;t be) a condemnation. In all the long years I&#39;ve been with the PPC (and I have an official Old Man Walking Stick to prove it!) I&#39;ve only seen Boarders angry at one another a handful of times, and never (I don&#39;t think) about story-related subjects.<br><br>I&#39;m going to quote from the Constitution now:<br><br><b>4. ...You don’t have to agree with anyone, of course, and stating your own opinion is encouraged, but no telling other people that their opinion is WRONG...<br><br>11. If you have a problem with a fellow PPC Boarder, please try to work it out in private emails. Don’t turn the Board into a free-for-all Flamefest.<br><br>14. If someone says something that seems offensive, but you’re not sure exactly what they meant, ASK them first, before jumping down their throats. They probably didn’t mean to offend anyone. (If they DID mean to insult people, go ahead and jump down their throats if you like.)</b><br><br>The PPC isn&#39;t just about the missions, entertaining though they may be. It&#39;s about a community of people who despise bad writing. That means that we need to help each other when we see it emerging in PPC work, and that we need to be receptive to constructive criticism of our own stories (Concrit -- it&#39;s not <i>just</i> a building material in HQ!). But we also need to be nice to each other.<br><br>I think it would be sensible for any changes to the structure of the PPC -- new Flowers, Departments, Emergencies -- to be brought up on-Board before actually being implemented. Then anyone objecting would have a chance to object. Because we need to remember that this is a shared universe, and that we can only make it work by working on it together.<br><br>Oh, and going back to the Constitution:<br><br><b>20. Remember to have FUN.</b><br><br>And so, since I&#39;m not fond of throat-jumping personally, I&#39;m going to close in the spirit of Rule 16. Aardvarks are orange -- but only on Tuesdays!<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: And leave Cassie out of this. I know you&#39;re on her LJ; it&#39;s not fair to start throwing things at her right now. ~hS)</p>

            <p>I have odd reservations about giving concrit to fellow PPC writers. Well, I find it odd. I think it mostly has to do with the fact that I consider the permission to write missions also as some sort of diploma for knowing how to write stories. So, I feel awkward telling people with this &quot;story writing diploma&quot; that their story writing isn&#39;t up to scratch. I don&#39;t want to appear condensending or have this whole &#39;I know better than you&#39; air. Even if I do think the story could be better or an easier read with some modifications.<br><br>What doesn&#39;t help, is that these stories are beta read by other PPC writers. More people who, I think, should know how to write a story. Why didn&#39;t the beta reader point out to certain author that their story reads more like a story outline than a story? Why didn&#39;t the beta of other author tell them to not use the gerund so much, and mix some shorter sentences in among only semi-paragraph long ones?<br><br>I feel outnumbered on those occasions.<br><br>I&#39;m more comfortable giving concrit to new PPC writers (those with no more than a few missions under their belt. It&#39;s like driving: you don&#39;t really learn how to drive until after you&#39;ve got your license and drive a lot). Those, I thought, would be more open to concrit. Until I got such a reply from one of them for pointing out a continuity error that I decided that for reviewing PPC missions goes the same as for reviewing stories on the Pit: no feedback for anyone under the age of 16, preferably 18.<br><br>It feels wrong to have this rule of thumb, but I can really do without the annoyance of being told I&#39;m wrong (even if only in the tone used in the response) for pointing out an error.</p>

            <p>Every time I get a new customer I have to toe the waters for a while to figure out exactly what they want and what they&#39;re not willing to listen to. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it gets messy. Since recieving some outright nasty replies from fanfic authors after offering to beta for them, I feel just as meek as you do. Pads is right; there&#39;s only so much we can do, and I wish there was a more common differentiation between SPaG beta-reading, content beta-reading, and actual approval of the work in question. <br><br>I also want to second your first paragraph, about the feeling that Permission = Writing Ability. It is so very much not true. I&#39;ve read some PPC missions which I&#39;d like to <i>bury</i> in ConCrit, but I keep my mouth shut, because except for Pads and Trojie and a few others, I&#39;m not really sure how such replies would be taken. I&#39;m not a newbie, but I&#39;m not an oldbie, and the informal hierarchy that comes with that leaves me unsure of what I should say and what&#39;s better off left alone (hence why I will probably never be named a Permission Giver).<br><br>That said, I welcome ConCrit from <b>everyone</b>. I may not use it - I may not have the time or energy, and may disagree - but I will always thank you and consider it. </p>

            <p>I also tend to fall victim to &quot;someone else will handle it&quot; syndrome and walk away without saying anything, mainly because I don&#39;t want to come off as that mean person who&#39;s always ready to criticize everything.<br><br>At the same time, though, I&#39;ve been training myself for years to take concrit, and it has gotten to the point where I&#39;m really frustrated when no one has anything to say on the subject of how I could improve.

            <p>I haven&#39;t had as much of a chance to beta as most of you, but I do try to give as much concrit as I can when I do have the chance. Have a tendency to be very blunt about it, though, which might alienate people, and in the PPC it&#39;s really not my place to offer criticism to <i>any</i> of you I think. Besides, like anyone would listen to my ilk? :P<br><br>Seriously though, I completely agree, especially with the desire for concrit. I&#39;m always specifically <i>asking</i> for it in my plugs, not just from betas but from everyone who reads them (which is probably nobody outside of my betas, actually :P) because I&#39;m always looking for criticism that can help me write better, especially since I want people to actually enjoy my spinoff (spinoffs? Does it count as multiple if you have multiple Agent pairs doing missions?). <br><br>It gets frustrating, because so few people ever even try and it seems like nobody actually cares enough to offer any (if, as said, anyone even read it. :P), but I&#39;m always willing to hear people out, and do tend to try to go back through a mission to fix details where needed. So, yeah, it&#39;s pretty much an open call for all concrit from anyone who has any to offer. SPaG itself shouldn&#39;t be the only thing addressed. I know I should probably stop crawling out from the woodwork like this, but I thought I should make my opinion known, especially since the <i>lack</i> of offered concrit has always frustrated me. Forgive me for not being as eloquent about it as hS or Neshomeh, but that&#39;s where I stand.</p>

            <p>There is sometimes only so much a beta can do.<br><br>Giving a long list of things that are wrong with a story tends to make people defensive. Pointing out huge problems in narrative style can be even worse, because it&#39;s so personal to the writer. With, say, Trojie or Sedri, I <i>know</i> they appreciate me ripping what they&#39;ve written to shreds and picking on anything and everything, and I <i>know</i> they&#39;ll take it well. With people I don&#39;t know so well, a softer approach is needed, with more sort of guiding principles about things that don&#39;t need to be said or done in whatever way.<br><br>Then, of course, there have also been occasions when I&#39;ve pointed out problems with agents&#39; abilities or the writer&#39;s take on how canon would react to the badfic, and been utterly ignored. It&#39;s made even more difficult because I know how <i>I</i> would write the mission, but my way isn&#39;t necessarily the best way. When the writer&#39;s not listening, there comes a point where I simply throw my hands up in defeat, SPaG-beta the thing, and wash my hands of it.<br><br>At which point said author then goes and sticks my name at the top as a beta suggesting I&#39;ve done an excellent job and the mission has my seal of approval. Which is frustrating as hell, because I&#39;m aware quite a few people round here view me as a good beta.<br><br>As for giving concrit to writers with many missions written, IndeMaat - feel free in my case. The more the better, as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>

            <p>Perhaps it is because you haven&#39;t been here quite as long as some of us. In the two years I was here before the 2008 Invasion, there were <i>no</i> Board-wide Emergencies. After April? Suddenly there are more and more Emergencies cropping up, and not just on the Board. Missions become less mission-y and more Homeric epic-y. RPs become less of a fun, lighthearted way to play around with characters and more of a means to more drama. And believe me, the Macrovirus Crisis was <i>anything</i> but in the background.<br><br>No fixation on big weapons? Perhaps you haven&#39;t seen the posts asking for usage of high explosives (I also seem to remember one asking if it was okay to use the power of the <i>gods</i>?!) to take out a Sue that, while seemingly impossible to destroy, could easily be defeated with brains and not brawn. Just because you&#39;re using your brain to write doesn&#39;t mean that your Agents don&#39;t have to use theirs to complete their mission with as little disruption to the &#39;verse as possible.<br><br>Perhaps it is, but it is a point all the same.<br><br>There&#39;s <i>always</i> an exception. You can <i>never</i> be sure.<br><br>I stand by my point here. Yes, they are writing devices, but when you write them only as they&#39;re seen on TVTropes, they are cliche. Try tweaking them. Making them different. Or maybe even make them <i>subtle</i>.<br><br>...really. What about the Agents randomly turning into Time Lords? Don&#39;t we, y&#39;know, <i>charge</i> &#39;fic characters for that? How about the ones that are supposedly unphased by anything and everything? The ones who can use noncanonical spells? The ones who shouldn&#39;t be Agents at all due to the impossibility of them being recruited? Take a look at the Agents on the wiki. A goodly amount are more Sue-ish than not.</p>

            <p>Can be explained in every &quot;repeated routine drives the focused character to madness&quot; clip show ever included in any show or movie ever.

            <p>I understand that routine gets boring, but we need to find a happy medium. Look at July&#39;s missions, for example. They&#39;re the formulaic missions, but they also have long intros and outros filled with various hijinks that help to define her Agents and make the actual piece more interesting. Writing things besides missions is perfectly all right, but it stops being okay when it turns into a drama production that would make <i>Shakespeare</i> cringe.</p>

            <p>Maybe actually, you know, write things more than occasionally. {= P<br><br>My own confession is that I find myself drawn over and over toward psychological drama and, though I shudder to say it, angst. The fact of dealing with insane people in insane situations makes me want to know what makes them the way they are, and to explore the effects badfic has on them physically and psychologically. This fascinates me, but it leads me away from humor at times. I have to fight that tendency when it comes to my own agents and, perhaps, develop it into writing about the canon characters in FicPsych instead. In that case, I also have to get over my fear of writing canon characters. If they&#39;re in FicPsych it&#39;s a given that they aren&#39;t quite themselves, right? So if I get some things off I&#39;d be forgiven, right? ^_^;<br><br>Hopefully my next story will set some things right.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... agents dealing with some everyday non-mission-related problems. More character interaction. Nothing huge and world-threatening, just how they deal with life and the problems that naturally come along with being a PPC agent. Or, heck, what happens when missions go horribly wrong? Not necessarily involving the agents being captured and nearly tortured to death, but it&#39;d be more fun if occasionally they screwed up.<br><br>Reminds me, I need to come up with something horrible to happen to Agent Foxglove - Laburnum&#39;s already been through a nasty near-failed mission thanks to her own inability to think things through.</p>

            <p>All these recent dramas haven&#39;t even come close to catching my interest, and I have no interest in reading missions that are predictable and more concerned with &quot;great&quot; new things than the agents and the awfulness of the badfic - because that&#39;s what the PPC is about: Badfic. <br><br>If I recall correctly, in the notes of one of their early missions, Jay made a comment about how she and Acacia were finding that their agents were getting a lot of screentime, and was concerned that the readers weren&#39;t interested in the agents. They were, thankfully, and that&#39;s why most of us are here, but the point is that the PPC&#39;s own founders did not start this wonderful place in order to write about themselves - the intention was always to deal with badfic. <br><br>Let&#39;s keep it that way, &#39;kay?</p>

            <p>So, if I could be permitted to give us a break from the unfolding wank over in that other thread, I was wondering what some of The Board&#39;s favorite goodfic are. Anyone want to share?<br><br>Me, I showed you one of them a while back, and I&#39;m also particularly fond of this guy&#39;s stuff: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/574797/Cyber_Commander"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/574797/Cyber_Commander">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/574797/Cyber_Commander</a></a>.

Also proves even more that, as Trojie and Pads stated, there is no such thing as a bad genre. Bast herself liked the fic, as shown in her reviews and her old FFN account&#39;s favorites list. I found it through there, and was not disappointed.<br><br>There&#39;s a most likely not dead sequel <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2247097/1/Harry_Potter_And_The_MiddleEarthians">here</a>. Seems the author is determined to prove that almost every single one of the PPC&#39;s most kill-worthy offenses can be written well, as this is a HP/LoTR crossover that doesn&#39;t have my blood boiling. I&#39;m beginning to wonder if she&#39;ll try turning the Prophesied Hero OC or Woeful Angsty Past plot points into something readable next.</p>

            <p>Yay, at least I feel ready to make a request to start PPCing.<br><br>Whilst I do have character bios around, they&#39;re also quite long, so I might as well summarise them here.<br><br>Department of Mary Sues Daniel Anders and Luciana Taylor.<br>The two are rescued bit-characters from a Sue-fic, recruited by the Assassins sent to kill said Sue. In the story, Taylor was a mercenary and Anders an English Language scholar (the irony is deliberate), but due to a slight... &#39;glitch&#39; in the parent fic&#39;s writing, Anders always looks somewhat vague (having lacked any physical description at all) whilst Taylor has become narcoleptic from staying awake for *four weeks* straight in the story. Yes, narcoleptic. It&#39;s not as fun as it sounds.<br><br>The two very much have to work together. Whilst Anders (being a linguistic scholar who takes badfic as something akin to a personal affront) is certainly enthusiastic, Taylor is the only one with any real combat experience, but of course has the problem of simply falling asleep at inopportune moments. The combined efforts of Medical and the Department of Fictional Psychology has alleviated this somewhat; she now only falls asleep on the spot when exposed to spectacularly bad writing. This is still quite a problem however, and the full effects of narcolepsy can easily return if she doesn&#39;t/can&#39;t take her medication in time. As such, their takedowns are always a bit chaotic, and prone to going to horribly wrong at inopportune moments. By and large, Anders takes care of the chargelist (seeing as Taylor will miss most of it due to her condition) whilst Taylor will try and manage the actual kill, assuming she&#39;s sufficiently conscious at the time. When she isn&#39;t (quite often), things get interesting...<br><br>The two have an interesting history in terms of how they came to be: Daniel is basically my inner snarky bastard (I&#39;m an English Language student), whilst Taylor was spawned from a one-shot joke I dreamt up involving a character going catatonic at a spectacular piece of badfic. Fridge Logic popped in to point out that, for an Agent, losing consciousness at badfic would be a serious problem, and thus Taylor was born. As for their names, they&#39;re both from a story I wrote ages and ages ago. It was quite bad. Given that they&#39;re rescued characters, it seemed appropriate.<br><br>The two also have a fair number of quirks (Anders wields an armoured copy Cambridge Encyclopaedia for the English Language in a sling as a sort of flail, Taylor has a variety of neuroses related to her condition and a lot of expertise in the misuse of explosives, and you must never, EVER call her by her first name in full) as well, but I&#39;m trying to keep this fairly short...<br><br>To sum up the character dynamic between them:<br>Anders is a headcase of the funny / awesome variety, Taylor is a headcase of the sympathetic / pitiable variety. Offsetting this, Anders is the least capable of actually taking down targets, whilst Taylor&#39;s sole area of expertise is dedicated to this. Taylor is also the saner of the two, likely because she is saved from the horror of badfic by simply nodding off at it, whilst Anders tends to start frothing at the mouth at such points.<br>They also have serious trouble completing missions without each other; they very much have to work alongside one another to get things done despite their various weaknesses and strengths. Naturally, breaking this dynamic separating them and making things generally go to hell quickly is something I&#39;ll be doing a lot. It&#39;ll be fun. Plus, trying to portray a genuine psychological problem and do proper justice to it will be a interesting challenge.<br><br>The first target is this: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4918474/1/Freedom_Love_Till_Death_Never_Do_Us_Part"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4918474/1/Freedom_Love_Till_Death_Never_Do_Us_Part">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4918474/1/Freedom_Love_Till_Death_Never_Do_Us_Part</a></a> - A Left 4 Dead fanfic featuring a Mary/Marty-Sue couplet of the Twilight variety (he is an amalgamation of all the Special Infected types, with all the strengths, none of the weaknesses, a sodding huge BFS that accidentally defies physics on occasion and also an Author Avatar of massive proportions; she is... very flat and uninteresting, but their love is EPIC! and HEARTRENDING!) chosen for, despite having technically accurate grammar/spelling, being an absolute travesty of a story and an insult to its host Canon (pay special attention to the dates and times mentioned in the &#39;fic. Draw own conclusions. Laugh, cry or go insane. Pick two)<br><br>As for writing samples, I don&#39;t have that many. I&#39;ve written some fanfic (hopefully in the &#39;goodfic&#39; category) which you can find here: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/~mrcj"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Emrcj">http://www.fanfiction.net/~mrcj</a></a>, but in terms of being understandable without having to understand the original Canon first, this would probably be your best bet: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5103813/1/Parallel_Running"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5103813/1/Parallel_Running">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5103813/1/Parallel_Running</a></a><br><br>Another thing worth noting is that I believe PPCs of actual fanfic should be kept self-contained; that is to say that they should be accessible to anyone, regardless of their familiarity with the PPC or even the Agents involved. As such, I have every intention of using out-of-mission vignettes whenever I want to do something that revolves heavily around the characters rather than their missions. As for the missions, they&#39;ll (hopefully) be a mix of snark, righteous Sue-hunting and the characters&#39; various weaknesses and neuroses throwing them for loops to keep things interesting. I blame Evangelion for that; I seem to be incapable of writing characters without at least one major problem now...<br><br>Hoping he&#39;ll be accepted,<br>Guessmyname</p>

            <p>On the condition that you quit describing things as their trope names. Similes and metaphors are much more fun.<br><br>Also, I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t say they&#39;re recruits from badfic unless they&#39;re actual recruits from actual badfic. They&#39;re allowed to be from a story you wrote ages and ages ago, given a new life and purpose in the PPC. As to how they got to HQ, that&#39;s what random plotholes are good for.

            <p>Duly noted. As for the trope names, I only use those when making notes; it&#39;s easier and quicker to describe things using them, and I usually have a good idea in my head of how I&#39;m going to apply them in-story. I wouldn&#39;t actually use them in-fic. Tropes are meant to be building blocks, after all.</p>

            <p>Does anyone know the best way to download entire webpages from geocities?

            <p>I suppose you could copy and paste the source code to a Notepad file. You&#39;ll lose any images associated with the pages, but there&#39;s no help for that. You&#39;ll just have to grab any images separately. Some of the stuff linked from the Handbook isn&#39;t actually on Geocities, though, so check first.<br><br>When is Geocities supposed to die? There&#39;s probably other PPC stuff on there that ought to be saved.<br><br>And, yes, agents can work in multiple fandoms. I haven&#39;t read your Permission request yet, because I&#39;m about to go eat something (and then I&#39;ll come back), but I noticed that you&#39;re aiming for the DMS. That&#39;s fine. Agents in the DMS can list more than one fandom in which they&#39;d like to kill Sues, and they often get things they didn&#39;t sign up for when the Flowers feel like being evil. They can also join the Freelance Division and be subject to all Sues everywhere, if they&#39;re really keen.<br><br>I hope I understood that question correctly.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who will be back soon.</p>

            <p>So, pronouns in Old Norse come in singular, dual, and plural - I, we two, and we (in the nominative). But it&#39;s just occurred to me that, though we form it out of two words rather than one, we have a difference between dual and plural, at least in the accusative, and at least round my end - we say us two or us lot, and you two or you lot.<br><br>Does anyone else use two and, particularly, lot to distinguish between dual and plural?

            <p>Unless context alone wouldn&#39;t make it clear, &quot;you&quot; or &quot;we&quot; suffices here in the midwestern United States. If it is necessary to make a distinction, we&#39;d probably say &quot;the two of us/you&quot; or &quot;we/you all.&quot; Occasionally &quot;we two&quot; might occur, but not often in spoken form--too easy to confuse that with &quot;we, too.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Us&quot; in place of &quot;we&quot; does happen, but in the subject, it&#39;s informal if not outright wrong usage.<br><br>&quot;Lot&quot; in that sense isn&#39;t in the dialect.

            <p>We do that too - technically one &quot;ought&quot; to say &quot;we both went&quot; rather than &quot;both of us went&quot;, as us is the accusative form of the nominative we, but that one&#39;s certainly widespread and common enough to be standard spoken English.<br><br>What I&#39;m more interested in this case is the modification of we, us or you to indicate number: as a child my siblings and I were always &quot;you lot&quot; (or occasionally &quot;you three&quot;, which is standard); you lot are all PPCers; them lot over there are knobheads - that sort of thing.

            <p>In addition to that (and Neshomeh&#39;s comments), I&#39;d like address a paragraphing issue. This:<br><br><i>&quot;Richi!

The first paragraph looks like it&#39;s Richi talking to Richi. Would look better like this:<br><br><i>&quot;Richi!

It&#39;s really easy, so c&#39;mon, anyone interested in spilling some free time into this?<br><br>The IRC info is #MCS on irc.blitzed.org.

            <p>As of today&#39;s Momentous Decision, if all goes well I&#39;ll actually be living in Leeds in September. It&#39;s a wait and see for now, but if all goes to plan, we could go with September rather than August, and then if anyone&#39;s coming from a fair distance away (or even if not) I&#39;d likely be able to provide sofa/floor for an overnight stay if anyone needs it.<br><br>Also I have a friend who loves karaoke, who would love to crash this thing, if no one objects.</p>

            <p>Would make it easier for people to come. I think that place does them.<br><br>Should also start picking songs. (I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll do &quot;Closer&quot;.

            <p>... but then this is the guy who does vodka shots through his eyeballs, pierced the skin of his forearms, used to eat caramel slice rather than taking his insulin (he&#39;s diabetic), and once got drunk, took one of my kitchen knives and hacked his jeans off into a miniskirt, then took off his underwear, then decided to take ALL his clothes off, put his wedding tackle in my dish-draining rack (I boiled it afterwards, don&#39;t worry) and then gave my male flatmate what would have been a lapdance had it not been done over his *face* (naked guy tackled other guy out of chair before doing said lapdance).<br><br>On the plus side, that stunt earnt him the winning last ten points on our 2008 Manlove Moment tally chart ... <br><br>... gosh, I really have lived in some strange flats ...</p>

Yes, he screwed up bigtime with this. Doubtless they&#39;re be more times. And his ass has already been flamed in regards to what a stupid waste of life he is by himself, and also by Pads apparently. <br><br>4) Drama. Over. Now. Everyone get over yourselves. KG, that means you especially. You&#39;re not an idiot and you&#39;re not worthless, you&#39;re just in the negatives when it comes to self esteem. Everyone lay off, now. I&#39;m glad we all had that little ranting and getting the fury out earlier this week, time to go back to peacetime and all that.<br><br>That said, everyone shut up.

            <p>Didn&#39;t it recently come up in conversation that we were getting a lot of people joining the Board after seeing the links on TVTropes? I remember thinking that it might be easier for our little community if there weren&#39;t any links over there, but I don&#39;t think I ever said it and I&#39;m not sure anyone else did. <br><br>To be honest, I&#39;m not sure this is a bad thing, but that&#39;s me with my let&#39;s-keep-our-community-small preferences. *shrug*</p>

            <p>That is basically the reason given by the person responsible for the edits.<br><br>--<br><br><i>&#39;Part of me snapped and believed it was the only way to stop the PPC from continuing on the downward spiral it has been. No more TV Tropes entries = far fewer newbies (I&#39;m not stupid enough to think it&#39;d completely <i>stop</i> newbies from coming; we get &#39;em from other places too)  = far fewer people messing things up = those who are already here/not screwing everything up can go into damage control. Seemed to me like the only way to help fix things. <br><br>I figured, all the people causing the problems are newbies. Therefore, remove the newbies, you remove the problem. Most of the &quot;bad&quot; newbies come from TV Tropes, I observed; ergo, remove any way to get to us from TV Tropes. Hypocritically, I have yet to leave myself even though I&#39;m one of the people ruining things. Actually, I think I cracked upon reading Rohirric Monkey&#39;s post, though there&#39;s not much in there that should have made me snap about this. shrug But yeah, that&#39;s why. It&#39;s also why my edit reasons tended to have a somewhat apologetic tone. I figured, once things were fixed, I could always just put them back, but there didn&#39;t seem to be any way otherwise. At least I&#39;m not trying to stop new people from joining ever again like I originally pondered.</i><br><br>--<br><br>They admit that they &#39;went temporarily insane and add <i>&#39;It seemed like the only way. At the least it&#39;d slow things down enough that  we could fix things without a flood of people adding to the problem.&#39;</i><br><br><font size="1">Yes, I know who it is.

            <p>I certainly don&#39;t want to stop newbies coming in; &#39;closing ranks&#39;, as Pads said, is a terrible. I suppose I didn&#39;t phrase myself very well - sorry, Ansela. I just meant that I myself wouldn&#39;t put a great deal of energy into replacing those links. Since they said &quot;Someone <b>claiming to be</b>&quot; one of us, I assumed it wasn&#39;t and shrugged it off. Sorry. <br><br>That said, giving the wrong impression about the PPC is even worse than trying to close ranks. I&#39;m not going to go and advertise our presence, but negative &#39;press&#39; is even worse. </p>
