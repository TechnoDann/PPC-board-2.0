            <p>Doubly fitting title! As, this monstrosity is one of the reasons I finally decided to join up here, instead of just lurking around. However, I&#39;m not entirely clear-- does the PPC cover comics or just writing?<br><br><a href="http://waterbender196.deviantart.com/gallery/#H-I-B-Y-comic"><a href="http://waterbender196.deviantart.com/gallery/#H-I-B-Y-comic">http://waterbender196.deviantart.com/gallery/#H-I-B-Y-comic</a></a><br><br>Whatever the case, there&#39;s no denying that this thing is terrible. I have no problems with Zutara, but I do have problems with Zutarans who create things like this. EXTREMELY lazy art with frequent copy-paste, completely inappropriate speech phrasing and dress styles, characters so far out of character they might as well be someone else (and that accounts for most of the main Avatar cast). Mai is outright evil, Azula has been lobotomized, Toph&#39;s personality appears to have been castrated...<br><br>The list goes on. And the most recent page (229) has possibly the most flagrant set of offenses, which I&#39;m not even going to detail here.</p>

            <p>Well, at least they didn&#39;t mangle Zuko too much, but Mai and Azula... WEESHT they&#39;re OOC. It&#39;s quite annoying when people use amnesia as an excuse to completely reverse a character&#39;s personality. And Toph fighting in a dress like THAT.<br><br>I understand this person&#39;s hatred for Mai, though. At first, I HATED Maiko because it was just completely out of nowhere and creepy, but when Mai saved their bacon in The Boiling Rock Pt. 2 (with that killer awesome line, &#39;What are you doing?&#39; &#39;Saving the jerk who dumped me.&#39;), I thought, &quot;Well... OKAY... I...GUESS I&#39;m okay with it...&quot; I was grudgingly supportive, more due to my undying loyalty to the canon than anything else, until the last episode with that scene between Zuko and Mai, where I gave in and squeed at the fluff.<br><br>I actually had an idea for an Avatar fic with elements of both Maiko AND Zutara, but the former is the OTP whereas the latter is a one-night stand that both of them regret with every fiber of their being.<br><br>... What did that have to do with anything? Crap, I was rambling again. Apologies.<br><br>Please kill that comic. Every other panel is the same... brain hurts.</p>

            <p>Oooooh dear, I&#39;ve heard of this one. Can the PPC take on comics? It has the most OOC Mai I&#39;ve ever seen. Possible character replacement? Either way, Katara kills her in a way that would make Mr. Selatcia proud.</p>

            <p>Mai is almost certainly a replacement- she&#39;s blunt, easily bored, and certainly somewhat vindictive, but not evil to the point of causing miscarriages or attempting murder otherwise. Katara is very OOC (I&#39;m fairly certain Katara would NEVER Bloodbend to kill, and even if, she&#39;d have some trouble doing so in the daytime as she appears to here), and while Laureril makes a good point with Toph about age tempering, well, temper, she&#39;s been blunted a bit much even accounting for some growing-up. And, as I mentioned, Azula has been pretty much lobotomized outright.</p>

            <p>Hmm...<br><br>I did catch a mini on pg. 63 (Toph Befong instead of Beifong)  The clothing and some speech is anachronistic (anasocistic? Is that even a word?) and there&#39;s definitely some major problems with the characterization.  I&#39;m less worried about Toph since three years can change people, and  I can see her growing up a bit (she was only 12-13 in the series and three years makes a HUGE difference at that age.)  I have to say that I&#39;m not particularly fond of the Agnst!Drama! tone that the main characters have, especially in contrast to the minor characters who all seem to have become happy-go-lucky.<br><br>The art doesn&#39;t really bother me.  It&#39;s obvious that the author is at least trying - although the random photo-realism is a little disconcerting.  No one said that copying and pasting was an absolute no-no for comics. (See: <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/"><a href="http://www.qwantz.com/">http://www.qwantz.com/</a></a>)  There might be some copyright issues with using actual images from the series sans disclaimer though.<br><br>Also: Aang&#39;s head bothers me.<br>There&#39;s a bunch of proportion/perspective issues, but they&#39;re not as bad as some I&#39;ve seen (and drawn myself!) but Aang&#39;s head is... really bad.<br><br><br>As to PPC-ability, my vote is that it should be fine if you want to try and take it on.  It&#39;s the Plot Continuum, not the Protectors of the Writing Continuum.  Maybe there&#39;s a separate fan-comic division? Doushinji are typically well written, but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a few lemons out there that could use some PPCing.</p>

            <p>Dragons was the first one I thought of, but there&#39;s already other canons with mini-dragons of various types, it&#39;d get too confusing.

            <p>Maybe the writer Ron Miller was in fact Jim Theis, who published this book under a pseudonym to escape the unfortunate notoriety The Eye of Argon gave him.

            <p>Okay, the fics are very short, the best way to do it would probably be one mission for the lot of them. Ninja Academy and School of Dark Moon appear to be original fic (though still flagrant Mary Sues), but Hello Smexy has Hatake Kakashi, Uchiha Itachi and Sesshoumaru, and The Door has Dante of Devil may Cry.</p>

            <p>Technically, you can kill the Sue however you want. Usually I just shoot them, for example, similar to how TOS did. However, you&#39;re supposed to kill them in the fic/continuum they&#39;re from. Body disposal is a sort of &quot;anything goes&quot; (like feeding them to Cthulhu), but they&#39;re not supposed to leave the canon.</p>

            <p>Gotta be careful with that one, though-- you can only trust universes to handle things on their own to a certain extent. Case In Point: what happened when Jay and Acacia left a LotR Elf Sue to be discovered by the Discworld Elves, assuming the natural course associated with the Disc&#39;s Elves would occur (it didn&#39;t).<br><br>Still, I hardly disagree with that method, since so very many of them offer such wide varieties of death. Just gotta Do The Research first to make sure said death is guaranteed early on.</p>

            <p>The elves just took their time about it, so when the Flowers scanned, the Sue showed up as still alive.<br><br>True. Too much risk of it simply leaving them alive but in pain forever, and Sues being Sues there&#39;s too much chance of them escaping. Also need to make sure the agents don&#39;t go in to watch it first-hand because if the Holder sees them, they probably have to pass its test to get out, and they&#39;d probably rather fail the test than face the Flowers after having brought an Object into HQ. Though if they went to see the Bride of the Seeker, they could get rid of the Object that way, because if they pass her test but aren&#39;t the Chosen, she gives them the option to get rid of the Object and forget all about the Holders. Could work with that.</p>

            <p>To be frank, though, you probably don&#39;t have to see the effects. Given the nature of most of the Holders, you can probably HEAR them, from considerable distance.<br><br>And remember, self-resetting canon. As long as you don&#39;t actually run one of the Holder tests to completion and get your hands on one of the items, all the Agent has to do is bail out of the canon back to HQ and it&#39;ll eventually reset itself, given the style of writing. And provided they never actually ask to see a Holder, just have the Mary Sue do it, they&#39;ll never get snared. One potential Chosen at a time, no matter how hopelessly doomed.<br><br>(And I like to imagine that the Flowers have some kind of arrangement with the Bride of the Seeker for getting rid of those items Agents inadvertently DO bring back to HQ. After making a few public examples, it hasn&#39;t happened for a while, but the agreement stands.)</p>

            <p>They give the impression of not having set co-ordinates, so I don&#39;t know if PPC portal tech would be able to deal with them, and knowing the Holders they&#39;re probably set so you can&#39;t leave except either when you&#39;ve finished the trial or at the set bail-out points some of the less cruel ones have.</p>

Recruited due to his power, his opposition to the Sue, and because Great Unclean Ones, with their attachment to humans, are the easiest type of Daemon to condition at FicPsych to have something resembling human morals.<br><br>Personality: Likes watching old bad movies, reading stuffy old novels, and anime. Yeah, he&#39;s a geek. Prone to yelling at anyone who disturbs these activities, or who crack jokes about his hygine. He has a special inhibitor installed to keep him from being sucked back into the Warp (and thus requiring a human sacrifice to resummon him) but of course it&#39;s far from foolproof. It&#39;ll occasionally short out, reverting him to his bestial persona of wanting to infect others with horrible diseases. He can rid himself of these impulses by punching himself in the face.<br><br>Agent: Winston Chalmers<br>Race: Vaguely-defined human<br>Home: Somewhere in England, Harry Potter<br>Department: Floaters<br>Specialties: You! and Me!Sues<br>Age: Seems late twenties<br>Height: 5 and a half feet or so<br>Weight: Well, I never!<br>Family: None to speak of.<br>Registered Lust Object: Why you presumptuous little...!<br>Berserk Button: Possession Sues<br><br>Origin: Popped into existence in a Harry Potter fic, gave exposition, then popped out of existence. Like all such characters, he&#39;s very vaguely defined, and thus just seems to be a young wizard with gray hair and eyes and pale skin.<br><br>Personality: A hopeless neat freak, so of course he was paired with an embodiment of pestilence. He&#39;s the token calm one of the duo; it&#39;s very hard to set him off, and pretty much the only things that can are Author-wraiths possessing his favorite characters and his partner&#39;s eating habits and droning on about his family. Bought a possessed couch from Rook Takes Pawnshop so he wouldn&#39;t have to bunk with Chliever. Comedy being what it is, it often tries to eat him.<br><br>Agent: Twinker<br>Department: Floaters (Decommissioned)<br><br>History: Chliever&#39;s previous partner, a reformed Star Trek Sue or something. Chliever has no knowledge of that canon whatsoever. Decommissioned from the PPC due to, in apparent complete lucidity, attempting to recruit Martin Van Buren. </p>

            <p>Just felt like sharing.<br><br>Name: Adrienne Marten (Agent Adder to you)<br>Species: Human<br>Gender: Female<br>Age: 15<br>Continuum: Real World<br>Department: Floaters<br>Personality: A bit overenthusiastic at times, and often quick to retaliate. It&#39;s relatively easy to annoy her. One of the best ways is to interrupt her while she&#39;s talking. She&#39;s not afraid to get her hands dirty, but she has a slight phobia of continual beeping (made worse by the inevitable console), and she hates fascists. At certain points, she will mutter/snarl/scream in Spanish.<br>Appearance: Rather tall and broad for a girl, with long mousey brown hair and glasses. On most occasions, she dresses like a guy.<br><br>Name: Deuce<br>Species: Human?<br>Gender: Male<br>Age: He says he&#39;s thirteen and he looks thirteen, but Adder&#39;s beginning to wonder what he means by &#39;just physically&#39;.<br>Continuum: That&#39;s the funny thing. He&#39;s from an original fiction that has not yet been published, so I guess you could say his continuum doesn&#39;t exist. Yet.<br>Department: Floaters<br>Personality: Snide, sarcastic, morbid, and a just a little bit arrogant, unless confronted with a particularly nasty badfic. Adder considers him a Pyro, which he most definitely is. He reacts negatively to stature jokes. And by &#39;reacts negatively&#39;, I mean &#39;attacks you, most likely with fire&#39;.<br>Appearance: He&#39;s the exact opposite of Adder: short for his age, and wiry. This, however, comes with the advantage of speed. He has blue eyes, and dresses in standard teenager attire of a hooded sweatshirt and geans. Oddly enough, his hair is a muted shade of gray, and he has three parallel slash marks across his left eye. Adder once asked him what happened to his face, to which he replied, &quot;Same thing that&#39;s gonna happen to yours if you don&#39;t shut up.&quot; (for the record, she shut up.)<br><br>These two are also aided by Cthulhu the ferret, who was a gift from Lycaenion.

            <p>Hello, it&#39;s me, Agent (to be) Chliever. While I&#39;m in my one month of permission limbo, I decided to report some badfic. Warning, none of this is brain safe. May I present the work of StarJeffry: <a href="http://starjeffry.livejournal.com/"><a href="http://starjeffry.livejournal.com/">http://starjeffry.livejournal.com/</a></a><br><br>It&#39;s ridiculous, but oddly enough, it doesn&#39;t read like a troll to me. It reads like a sixth grader who just took his first sex ed class. The author has an unhealthy obsession with Hermione, one of the more notable gems in there is a SELF-INSERT &quot;MY HUMPS&quot; SONGFIC about her.<br><br>Merry has something called a &quot;oenis&quot; in one of them. Worth confiscating?<br><br>If nobody wants to claim, I&#39;ll take it once I become a full Agent.</p>

            <p>Basically,  since I am a man who loves my music (and whose brain has a tendency to work with the Imagination and cook up in-head music videos for whatever I&#39;m hearing), I&#39;m just wondering what music everyone else likes/currently has stuck in their head. Preferably something they associate with the PPC, but I&#39;m hardly picky.<br><br>I&#39;ll start off with five of my own. My own tastes run more to &quot;oldies&quot; (ELO is possibly my favorite band ever, for example), but these five are all on my Songza playlist at current. As well as good.<br><br>Soft Cell- Tainted Love<br>Scissor Sisters- I Can&#39;t Decide<br>Rogue Trader- Voodoo Child (I blame Dr. Who for all three of these)<br>AC/DC- Back in Black<br>Creature Feature- The Greatest Show Unearthed</p>

Although most Eighties rock is: please consider<br><br>- Pour Some Sugar On Me by Def Leppard<br>- Cherry Pie by Warrant (okay, I know, it misses being an Eighties song by a year, gimme a break :P)<br>- Bad Medicine by Bon Jovi<br><br>When I&#39;m not listening to dodgy Eighties hair metal, however, my taste runs more to grunge (yes, I know, most grunge musicians would have crucified me for listening to hair metal, but meh); Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Babes in Toyland, Silverchair (pre-Diorama, srsly) and to seventies rock - Led Zeppelin, Cream, Jethro Tull, Black Sabbath, etc<br><br>And Queen.<br><br>And, uh, Savage Garden, ABBA, Steps, Vengaboys and S Club 7.

            <p>There&#39;s nothing I particularly associate with the PPC. Well, maybe &quot;The Call&quot; by Regina Spektor, which for some reason I have on my computer.

The man-thing brought three albums round on Monday, and I&#39;ve been rinsing them ever since. Occasionally this is overtaken by the Propellerheads, but that&#39;s not so much in my head as floating up from the living room, as my housemate has of late developed a distressing habit of juggling half-naked in the window, and it helps him keep his rhythm.<br><br>As for general tastes? Swing, ska, punk, dub reggae, drum &#39;n&#39; bass. In other words, the soundtrack to my mis-spent youth.<br><br>Incidentally, I heard the Rogue Traders one in a shop the other day, and was immediately overcome by the urge to come home and watch the season three finale.</p>

            <p>Can&#39;t say there&#39;s a particular kind of music I love these days. I like mainstream styles: generic punk, generic rock and generic classical (it&#39;s very vague, I know).

            <p>...I&#39;m very interested in the metal genre.  I&#39;ve also been known to listen to early music, such as baroque and renaissance.  Also, Samuel Barber is God.  He wrote &quot;Adagio For Strings&quot;.  He lends the title to Dan Swanö on the weekends, however.<br><br>I&#39;m currently listening to the Katatonia CD <i>Brave Murder Day</i>, with I just ripped onto my computer, and I have to say it&#39;s very good.  Recently my favorite bands are Epica (I have to mention them, seeing as I&#39;m wearing an Epica t-shirt at the moment), Nightingale, Tristania, Nightwish, Opeth, Arch Enemy, and Dark Tranquility.  What, you expected me to just pick one?</p>

            <p>But very little pop.

I&#39;ll sing most Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals, Wicked, West Side Story and so on for musicals, soundtracks for most of the classic (ie, before 2000) Disney films, Scottish and Irish folk music - Riverdance, the Corries, the Rankin Family - as well as some random singers, most of which stopped performing about the time I was born. <br><br>As for instrumentals, Pachelbel&#39;s Canon is my absolute favourite, along with the theme for &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot;, and this beautiful extended piece from Star Trek: TNG (Picard&#39;s flute, for anyone who&#39;s seen that episode). <br><br>And I&#39;m quite sure anyone reading this has lost interest by now, so I&#39;ll just shut up :P</p>

            <p>Seriously, it&#39;s just about always something Broadway, and not something that is easily specified further. There are certain musicals - Scarlet Pimpernel, Secret Garden, Les Mis, Andrew Lloyd Weber stuff - that are more common than others, and love songs seem more likely to come up than other types, but I can get almost any musical in here.<br><br>I&#39;ve only gotten the mental music video thing twice, sort of; once with a piece of classical music I don&#39;t remember that resolved as a Studio Ghibli credits sequence, and once with <i>Sleigh Ride</i>, which came out as a movie trailer involving an automated snowball catapult.</p>

            <p>My favorite is Blind Guardian, in all their fantasy-obsessed glory: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9chQnUjnYk">Nightfall</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M155UIfxFPA">Times Stands Still</a> are great, especially if you like <i>The Silmarillion</i>.<br><br>There&#39;s also Ayreon, a series of progressive rock/folk music/heavy metal sci-fi rock operas.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqzyUrxeOxM">Here&#39;s</a> a song from <i>Into the Electric Castle</i><br><br>Iron Maiden, too, although they&#39;re not so into sci-fi/mythology/fantasy.<br><br>The Master dancing to his own personal soundtrack while taking over the world is quite possibly the best thing ever.</p>

            <p>Besides, I think her theme band would be Mindless Self Indulgence. &quot;Molly&quot; and &quot;Pre-Teen Violence&quot; are in competition for being her theme song. (Considering what her father nearly did to her, &quot;Pantyshot&quot; might be on there too, but that&#39;s way too dark for the PPC even though we&#39;re talking about an adorable anthro ferret kid who eats people.)<br><br>I don&#39;t associate any particular songs with the PPC in general, but I do sometimes associate certain songs with certain characters or situations.</p>

            <p>The latter two songs I mentioned in my first post are two my aforementioned &quot;Mental Music Video&quot; function associates with the PPC. &quot;Back in Black&quot; hooked on when I got to the climactic battle while reading the logs of HFA, and I imagine &quot;The Greatest Show Unearthed&quot; as agents staging some kind of demented carnival of the PPC&#39;s history and the history of the Mary Sue in your traditional Creepy Deserted Fairgrounds.</p>

You&#39;re right that the PPC almost always simply kills the Sue, but The Department of Mary Sue Experiments keeps them under lock and key long enough to, er, observe them and their habits. In that case, the length of a Sue&#39;s stay depends as much on her individual traits as her actual crime.</p>

            <p>These are my agents:<br><br>Full Name: Valdis <br>Species: Uknown<br>Age: Unknown<br>Department: Department of Mary Sues, Freelance Division<br>Response Center: Omega<br>LO: Kiba and Tsume from Wolf’s Rain<br><br>Description: About four feet tall at the shoulder with a long tail. She is a large, black, wolf with a red mark on her chest. <br><br>Detailed description: Valdis has one yellow eye and one green eye, her coat is black and she has a red marking on her chest that upon closer inspection is revealed to be the Japanese symbol for death. When she is angry her eye color changes to red and the pupil disappears, a very disturbing effect. She is a highly intelligent, though somewhat crazy, canine-like creature with a taste for blood that her PPC partner swears is part vampire and part wolf, but her file marks her as a product of a crossover between Harry Potter and Full Metal Alchemist. Valdis is useful in taking attacks as she has amazing regenerative abilities,  but if Valdis is killed then she will be out of action for a minimum of ten minutes while her body reboots. She is fairly argumentative, quick to anger and sometimes childlike, but when the time comes to do her job, she becomes serious and she does it as she does most things… gleefully. She likes a good fight, is indifferent to bad grammar and, for most stories, doesn’t care much about canon one way or the other, though she knows what her job is and enjoys doing it. Valdis is loyal, mostly to herself, has a sense of humor, and is slowly becoming more…controllable, doing her duty to hunt down Sues and Sams. She is sometimes reckless, but because of her ability injury is in general not a problem. <br><br>Full Name: Jasper Caspi likes to be called Jazz<br>Species: Human Female<br>Age: 19<br>Response Center: Omega<br>Department: Department of Mary Sues, Freelance Division<br>LO: Faramir, Legolas, Colonel Roy Mustang, Murtagh, Kakashi Hatake, Shikamaru Nara, Guy Cecil<br>Description: Height 5’6”, Green eyes, white blond hair, fair skin<br><br>Detailed Description: Jasper, or Jazz as she likes to be called, has green eyes, long, wavy, white blond hair and fair skin, she appears to be fairly soft and innocent, but Jazz is a fire mage and as such is also a pyro. Her powers feed upon her body’s energy so if an attack uses more energy than she has, she could die. She is quite useless as a forward melee fighter but can use long distance weapons such as a bow. She has a tendency to take things literally and is just getting used to sarcasm. Jazz really loves canon pairings and if one is changed she gets angry. She is very book smart, and bad grammar is one of her biggest pet peeves, however she can be a bit ditzy at times. She loves reading more than anything else but is also familiar with some videogames. She is usually even-tempered, except when she is working on a particularly bad fic.<br><br>This is my writing sample:<br><a href="http://rcomega.webs.com/writingsample.htm"><a href="http://rcomega.webs.com/writingsample.htm">http://rcomega.webs.com/writingsample.htm</a></a><br><br>This is the badfic I will be taking on with my friend Makari (who is already a PPCer)<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2658641/7/Tales_of_Symphonia_Remix"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2658641/7/Tales_of_Symphonia_Remix">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2658641/7/Tales_of_Symphonia_Remix</a></a> <br></p>

            <p>...Permission <i>half</i> granted.<br><br>That is, permission to write Jasper Caspi is granted, but I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re going to have to scrap Valdis. Or at the very least, tone her way, way down.<br><br>First problem: an agent does not have to care about every canon in which she finds herself, but she should at least have an undying love for one or two universes. The whole <i>reason</i> for being an agent is out of love for a specific canon. We&#39;re not generally &quot;out for blood&quot; at the PPC. The reason we hate Sues and badfic so much is that we love good stories <i>even more</i>.<br><br>Second problem: &quot;Valdis has one yellow eye and one green eye, her coat is black and she has a red marking on her chest that upon closer inspection is revealed to be the Japanese symbol for death. When she is angry her eye color changes to red and the pupil disappears, a very disturbing effect.&quot;<br><br>So, let me get this straight. Your agent has unusual, multi-colored eyes that change with her mood, a &quot;badass&quot; Japanese marking, super special abilities, a &quot;cool&quot; nickname, and an attitude problem? <br><br>...<br><br>I hope I don&#39;t have to tell you what&#39;s wrong with this. But if I do, please hold off writing your first mission until you&#39;ve spent more time here.  <br><br>Here&#39;s a good test of an agent character: does she take herself too seriously? If so, does it get hammered into her skull early on that this is a bad thing? Also, could you, the author, <i>poke fun</i> at this agent multiple times during the story? If not, the agent should not be in the PPC.<br><br>You do write well, so if you pair your second agent with someone else, go ahead and send me your first chapter, so I can look at it.

            <p>&quot;It is over,&quot; Recruit Cal said in a dead voice, pale and trembling. He blinked in disbelief, pinched himself hard to make sure he was not in some horrible nightmare, and finally let the dreadful truth assert itself in his uncomprehending mind.<br><br>Alas, his coffeemaker was no more.<br><br>It had just let out its last struggling breath, then had fallen silent. The valiant machine that had relentlessly supplied Cal with its elixir of life for as long as he had been here would give him happiness and comfort no more. It was an old coffeemaker, to be sure, and the young Recruit had never expected it to live forever, but its tragic passing at the moment he needed it most was more than what he could bear. But even as he mourned his old companion, silvery tears gliding down his cheeks, Cal already thought about finding a replacement. It was disrespectful for the deceased, but also necessary — for what is a man without coffee? For the greater good of the Protectors of the Plot Continuum, he had to find a new coffeemaker.<br><br>&quot;You can surely understand,&quot; sobbed Cal, addressing his lifeless sidekick. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I shall never forget you for as long as I live.&quot;<br><br>Someone passed in the corridor just outside Cal&#39;s office, and the young Recruit immediately put on his usual mask of grim stoicism. He was supposed to act professionally, and a professional does not weep. No, tears would not solve his problem. He should immediately look for a new assistant to replace the one who had just left this sad, joyless world for a better place.<br><br>It took him quite a while to find the Department of Sufficiently Advanced Technology in the inextricable maze of the Headquarters. Slaloming between the white-coated technicians testing their revolutionary inventions or reading thick books of physics, Cal went directly to a Token Black Man, who looked like he had a significant rank.<br><br>&quot;Excuse me, mister Token,&quot; Cal said in a businesslike tone, &quot;but I need a coffeemaker quickly.&quot;<br><br>The man raised an eyebrow, either because of how Cal had called him or because of the Recruit&#39;s strange request (or, maybe, a bit of both).<br>&quot;Uh, you can probably find one in the storage room over there,&quot; he said, pointing. &quot;It&#39;s where we put what we want to get rid of at our next yard sale. It&#39;s a bit of a mess, but you can take whatever you want. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s anything valuable in there.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br><br>As it turned out, saying that the storage room was a bit of a mess was a massive understatement. Under a thick layer of dust and cobwebs, an incredible number of appliances, tools and strange gadgets occupied almost every square inch of the floor. Cal picked his way carefully, looking everywhere in the dimly-lit room for a coffeemaker.<br><br>Then he tripped on someone.<br><br>Gasping, he looked down at the face staring up at him. No, not someone: something. To be more precise, an android in the shape of a little girl with tangled black hair and large, innocent hazel eyes. She (it?) was badly damaged, with many multicolored wires laid bare, but her contact with Cal&#39;s foot had woken her up. With an eerie little smile, she started singing the digits of Pi on the tune of the Soviet national anthem. The young Recruit stared at her with astonishment. Then, forgetting all about his coffeemaker, he examined the girl. She was apparently very sophisticated, and without the wires she would look perfectly human. But she was broken, that much was plain. Cal suddenly forgot his initial purpose here, fascinated by the android. He did find a coffeemaker somewhere and absent-mindedly put it under his arm, but when he quit the storage room with the android in his hands, only her deserved his full attention.<br><br>By the time he reached his response center, the robotic girl was now making a lecture on the many useful applications of string theory to winemaking. Cal put her on the floor and rummaged in his closet to find his toolbox. He was not much of an engineer, but he intended to repair her no matter what. Pouring himself a cup of coffee (the new coffeemaker was even better than the previous one), he opened up the android with his knife and got to work. Here in the Headquarters, time knew nothing of logic or regularity, so the young Recruit used cups of coffee as an approximate unit. From one to three cups, the robot girl translated one of Barack Obama&#39;s speeches into pirate speak (&quot;Arrrr, matey, aye we can!&quot;). From about three to six cups, she composed an opera version of The Matrix. At seven cups, she predicted the next big San Andreas earthquake for October 2014, along with a rough estimation of damage and casualties. From eight to ten, she recounted every single move of the six chess games that opposed Garry Kasparov to the computer Deep Blue in 1997. Cal thankfully found a way to shut her down just as she was starting to graphically describe every sexual position known to man, and from then on he was able to work in silence.<br><br>Around fourteen cups of coffee and a half, Cal was extremely tired, but he felt he had done a decent job. All wires had been reconnected and several missing parts had been replaced. He only hoped his tampering had not turned the android into a blood-thirsty megalomaniac bent on world domination.<br><br>Of course, there was only one way to find out, and it was to flick the switch — which he did.<br><br><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br><br>Okay, this was part one of the introduction of my second agent.<br><br>I will post part two when I have found a name for her. Feel free to make suggestions.</p>

            <p>Around fourteen cups of coffee and a half, Cal was extremely tired, but he felt he had done a decent job. All wires had been reconnected and several missing parts had been replaced. He only hoped his tampering had not turned the android into a blood-thirsty megalomaniac bent on world domination.<br><br>Of course, there was only one way to find out, and it was to flick the switch — which he did. The android immediately came back to life, and Cal half expected her to start explaining in Morse code why France lost the Algeria war. When she did not, he took this as an encouraging sign that his repairs may have worked.<br><br>&quot;Where am I?&quot; was the first thing the robotic girl asked, frowning with puzzlement.<br><br>&quot;Response Center 72,&quot; answered Recruit Cal. &quot;Headquarters of the PPC.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah... and who am I?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have no idea,&quot; Cal apologized. &quot;I found you in the storage room of the Department of Sufficiently Advanced Technology. Apparently they wanted to get rid of you in a yard sale.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t you have any concern for my self-esteem?&quot; the girl complained.<br><br>&quot;Oh, sorry. You were broken, and I guess the Department couldn&#39;t be bothered to repair you. But I did. And I won&#39;t sell you in a yard sale.&quot; He paused. &quot;Unless the price they offer is really good. But I&#39;m not planning a yard sale any time soon, so don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here: I should start going on missions in just a few weeks, but they haven&#39;t given me a partner. You interested?&quot;<br><br>She thought about it. &quot;What do we do on those missions?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We kill Mary Sues and restore the plot continuum.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Does it involve spiked flails?&quot; she asked hopefully.<br><br>&quot;Yes, if you want.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m in,&quot; she grinned.<br><br>&quot;Great. What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dunno. I don&#39;t remember anything about myself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then find yourself a name.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sure. I&#39;ll browse the Web, I have Internet access.&quot; Her gaze grew distant. After a moment her grin widened. &quot;Hey, did you know that the Meganeura, a kind of dragonfly from the Carboniferous period, had a wingspan of 75 centimeters? Most. Awesomest. Insect. Ever!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t get sidetracked,&quot; sighed Cal impatiently. &quot;The &#39;Net is interesting, but you only need to find a name.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Could I be called Meganeura?&quot;<br><br>&quot;NO.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay, fine,&quot; pouted the android. She went on searching the Web. It took her half a second. &quot;I&#39;ll go with Ellen. After Ellen Ripley, from Alien.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, she&#39;s...&quot; Cal began, his ears reddening. &quot;...She&#39;s my Lust object! I can&#39;t have a partner who&#39;s named after my Lust Object. That would be disturbing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s either that or Meganeura,&quot; replied the girl stubbornly.<br><br>&quot;Arrrrgh, okay. Anything but Meganeura.&quot;<br><br>&quot;HA! No one argues with a badass like Ellen!&quot; exclaimed the android triumphantly.<br><br>Cal rolled his eyes. Being partnered with someone more or less sane was probably too much to ask.</p>

            <p>To the point where I would like to have a transdimensional airship rather than a TARDIS or a response center. Airships are made of pure, undiluted awesome.

            <p>It isn&#39;t that we wouldn&#39;t retaliate--it&#39;s just that I&#39;d like to think we&#39;re not stupid enough to retaliate in a way that would lead to the destruction of the human race.<br><br>Despite what I said earlier, the primary drive of any species is to ensure its own survival. As stupid and crazy as some people can be, we all share that drive. If it came to the point where the entire species was, beyond denial, on the edge of destruction, everything would stop. What we would have left to work with at that point is questionable, I grant you, but we&#39;re not going to destroy everything, because if we did, whatever we were fighting for would become null and void.<br><br>Frankly, I think anyone who uses nuclear weapons, now that we know what they do, automatically loses as far as principles go. They might pound the opposition into glowing dust, but they won&#39;t have any friends left afterward. Not much point to that kind of victory.<br><br>If you really must argue with any of that, I have an e-mail address.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Just because Russia is re-arming doesn&#39;t mean that World War III will break out. I mean, yeah, things look pretty bad, but if there will be a war we should be looking to the Middle East not to Russia, although Russia will most certainly be involved. Another note is that we are in a recession, not a Great Depression, at least not yet. Humans are a very adaptable resilient species, we&#39;ll pull through. </p>

            <p>Ding! You&#39;re right. The Mayans thought that the world came in &quot;cycles,&quot; and managing to live to the end of a cycle was a cause for celebration, not cowering in fear of fire or damnation or big mean Russians.

            <p>Sometimes I get the feeling that some people eagerly wait for doomsday. They may fear it, but they also unconsciously hope it will happen soon. That would explain why 2012 is such a big deal.<br><br>The whole 2012 doomsday theory is based on the fact that the calendar of a people that did not even use the wheel stops there! You could easily dismiss the fears of the &quot;2012ists&quot; with rational arguments, but they still wouldn&#39;t believe you: they WAIT for doomsday, just like those survivalist nuts who have a fallout shelter in their basement. If 2012 passes without a major catastrophe, thousands will be disappointed.<br><br>The end times have ALWAYS been imminent, for as far back as you can go in history.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got a beautiful article on it somewhere, but I don&#39;t have time to upload it just now. Very, very, very short version: They calculated everything astronomically and worked out their calendar dates backwards and forwards, everything running in cycles; twenty in all, each twenty times shorter than the last. The first three, I think, were all finished before Buddha and Christ turned up. The current one started in 1987 and will end on December 21st, 2012 - the winter solstice when the milky way is perfectly aligned to our planet.<br><br>They do not predict death and disaster. Opinions and interpretations vary, but it&#39;s just as likely to be an awakening of spiritual consciousness. <br><br>Also, they aren&#39;t the only ones. At least one Native American tribe - I forget which - predicts great happenings for that same year; possibly even the same date. <br><br>I&#39;ll get the details later, promise. Right now, must dash.</p>

            <p>... which is what I do best, I&#39;d like to point out that this is hardly a major perturbation.<br><br>Planet&#39;s been here for 4.6 billion years. It&#39;ll probably manage at least another 4.6 billion years. We&#39;ve been here less than ten thousand years. Our influence extends maybe three or four miles into the crustal rocks, and up into the atmosphere, maybe the troposphere. And a few bits of space junk. This planet has some FABULOUS feedback systems that mean that, if we were removed, in the blink of a geological eye our influence would dissipate (of course, this doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that if we continue doing what we&#39;re doing, OTHER fabulous feedback loops will make things considerably worse, but I digress). <br><br>Given evolution works how it does, I suspect that another sentient species would arise. Or maybe not. It&#39;s not like a planet has to have a sentient species, it took about five hundred million years for us to toddle along, after all :)<br><br>Basically, guys, gals and undecided, life goes on. Whatever happens, the sun will keep shining, photosynthesis will keep happening, water will freeze and water will evaporate, sand will move, gravity will hold rocks down ... so why worry? Keep writing, or hey, go outside, look at the sky, see the grass (the most successful organism on the planet, grass), enjoy yourself. You&#39;re alive. That&#39;s all that matters.<br><br>/end serene eccentric scientist warbling.</p>

            <p>Russian rearmament is fairly inevitable - their economy tanked in the 80s and continued going down when the Iron Curtain fell, so military spending dropped fairly significantly. A resurgence is only to be expected, especially with ex-Soviet states starting to have border squabbles. Also, considering the last seven years of American foreign policy, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see Russia taking a more aggressive hand in international politics.<br><br>If it does come to nukes, though, you&#39;re probably fine. Soviet-era nuclear doctrine consisted of atomic strikes on nuclear military installations (B-52 bases, sub pens, ICBM silos) and runways long enough to serve nuclear bombers (&gt;11,000 feet, IIRC) in tactically important places. If you live more than ten miles from any of the above, you&#39;re not going to be killed by blast effects. While initial fallout will be major (and should be avoided if possible), it&#39;s mostly very hot, short-lived particles. In 10 days, radiation levels will drop to 1/10th of the initial, and after another 10 days, it&#39;ll be down to 1%. After a month, you&#39;re down to background radiation levels except for a couple square miles at each epicenter.<br><br>Seen pictures of downtown Hiroshima? It&#39;s a thriving city, and grass grows around the ruins of the nuclear war memorial. Admittedly that was a small nuke, but the physics is the same, it&#39;s just on a larger scale.</p>

We humans ended up on this earth, a fact which we can all agree on, no matter what religion we follow or whether we follow one at all, and this earth is the only one we have. We have to take care of it, and we haven&#39;t been doing a very good job of it lately. When it all comes down to it, the fate of the world really does rest in our hands.

            <p>Sure, we&#39;ve only got one Earth now. Plenty of other places even in the solar system though - how about some cash spent on working out successful ways to get a few colonies started?

            <p>We&#39;ve chucked car-sized spacecraft so hard that they&#39;ve exceeded not just Earth&#39;s escape velocity but also the Sun&#39;s. We&#39;ve landed more than two metric tons of scientific equipment on Mars, and gotten enough data back to assemble fairly comprehensive geologic maps of the planet. We&#39;ve landed spacecraft on Venus. We&#39;ve nailed comets with bullets fired years earlier. We put people on the moon when the most powerful computers on the planet were less powerful than the average modern graphing calculator, and all within 100 years of the first powered flight in history. I would not be so quick to denounce human potential.<br><br>And no, we wouldn&#39;t have to terraform entire planets for colonization. Large-scale tent cities are feasible on Mars, at least, where low pressure and gravity make holding up tents with internal pressure possible.<br><br>(And I disagree on the possibility of terraforming planets. In the last few thousand million years, Earth has been everything from a volcanic lava planet straight out of the dreams of Lucas to a ball covered in green oceans under a carbon dioxide atmosphere to a smoldering impact wasteland. Terraforming is quite possible, although it&#39;ll probably take geological time, rather than a more human scale, to complete. Mars will be harder than some worlds, as it&#39;s small and has no magnetic field.)<br><br>Space exploration and colonization is a matter of time and will, not possibility.</p>

            <p>I think whoever wants to start something might target the Internet first. After all, according to <a href="http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-03/who-protects-intrnet">Popular Science</a> magazine, our precious intrawebz are just a bunch of fiber-optic cords at the bottom of the ocean. Remove some, and there&#39;s no connectivity in a certain part of the world.<br><br>So if there is going to be a nuclear holocaust, I predict that the intrawebz are going to get cut first and thusly cut off communications from the rest of the world. After all those virus and hacker stuff, a physical attack on the Internet is likely to be on a terrorist&#39;s list of things to do before nuking the planet.<br><br>(*taps foot* Where are the spaceships and battlestars when you need them?)</p>

            <p>Are you familiar with Pandora? It&#39;s a great music discovery website. I&#39;ve got <a href="http://www.pandora.com/people/techno.dann">a few channels</a> there with techno: Daft Punk Radio is, well, Daft Punk (real techno), while Keep Hope Alive Radio is more dance-esque (based around The Crystal Method&#39;s work). Dragonstea Din Tei Radio is real electronic dance (&#39;90s, mostly), and E Nomine Radio is some of the fun-ness that happens at the intersection of Gothic Metal, classical choral music, and electronic.<br><br>Other music that&#39;s less techno but might appear in DoSAT would be E.S. Posthumous and Hyper (see Cascade Radio).<br><br>Okay, that&#39;s just music I like. But still, it&#39;s good music.<br><br>Just a note, I am still kinda working on DoSAT stuff. It&#39;s very, very backburner thanks to school, work, and life in general, but please don&#39;t make additions totally impossible. </p>

            <p>Is that it has to be, you know, <i>legendary</i>. Something that can be mentioned and everyone will groan and say, &quot;Oh THANKS for bringing up that memory!&quot;  So new things generally don&#39;t qualify. That said, it looks horrible, and I hope to see it die soon.</p>

            <p>Never heard of your agony thingy. That&#39;ll be why it&#39;s not legendary. Well, not because <i>I</i> haven&#39;t heard of it, but... Legendary needs, primarily, to be bad in an accessible way. Example: legolas by laura is a continuum we all know, and is a quick read, and everyone comes across it. C*l*br**n, too, is an accessible continuum. That Series is mostly just putting me off ever reading Redwall, but. Les Mis, however, isn&#39;t highly read or known. Which reduces the chances of the legendary staus, because it just won&#39;t make an impact on enough people.</p>

            <p>Mm, but if it&#39;s only been heard of in Australia because of a ban there, it doesn&#39;t quite qualify. Barring extreme circumstances that guarantee fandom-wide recognition, the legendaries are, alas, mostly limited to the fandoms frequented by the majority of the Board. Simple reasoning being that most of us aren&#39;t in a position to judge the badness or otherwise of, say, a Power Rangers fic, because we don&#39;t know the canon.</p>

            <p>...about being legendary within the PPC. Unfair, probably, but we can&#39;t be universal, and it&#39;s listed on our wiki. So I think it&#39;s most likely to be admitted only if 80% of the people on the Board know - and groan - about it.</p>

            <p>Well, the monster is purportedly made out of books on the nuances of torture. Sounds pretty flammable to me, and since the fic never actually has him grow we might be able to take him out at ground-level. Hitting the monster first would obviously be preferable so as to forgo the possibility, and then we could exorcise Lord Zedd.</p>

            <p>The OC in this story, and the essential avatar of the author&#39;s kink, will be problematic to kill. As a monster, he&#39;s prone to growing huge when destroyed, so big we&#39;d need a giant robot to fight him. Does the PPC issue Megazords? I can&#39;t imagine it&#39;d be hard, we have Sun Crushers and TARDISes, but Power Rangers badfic isn&#39;t exactly prevalent, so I wonder if DoSAT has even seen a need to do so.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve seen equally gory stuff (I browse Yiffstar for fun) but with at least one of those, the author noted at the beginning that this is not a good thing to do in real life, and something about the tone of the story made me think the author actually does <i>understand</i> that.

            <p>Based off a line from the first chapter, which said Kimberly evidently &quot;excited Lord Zedd in ways he didn&#39;t quite understand&quot;, I think it was... God, I have no idea. Definitely the Author putting himself in Lord Zedd&#39;s position in this. Residual anger at Kimberly for exciting his own latent sexuality?

            <p>I wouldn&#39;t call it a fixation, I was just never a Power Rangers kid. Wall-E I&#39;m a lot more attached to.<br><br>Anyhow. Lord Zedd is probably the most out-of-character in the batch, seeing as how I doubt he&#39;d really revel so readily in seeing any of the Rangers in pain (and that line at the start makes it rather clear where the self-insert is). He&#39;s really drinking it in in here. Granted, he hates the Rangers for constantly foiling him, but at the level portrayed? I sincerely doubt it.<br><br>While I can believe that he&#39;d be fascinated by finding out something new, I do not believe he&#39;d never heard of torture before coming to Earth. He&#39;s an evil overlord. Honestly. That&#39;s a big problem, since it branches out the rest of the fic. Also, as it mentions within the fic itself, he doesn&#39;t nominally make regular calls to taunt the rest of the Rangers while enacting his plans. That seems mostly contrived to create more horror on the reader&#39;s part by imagining how the Rangers feel in that position.<br><br>The Rangers, I have to say, are pretty much spot-on in character. We could probably charge for thesaurus abuse or repetitiveness later on since the Author starts running out of alternate ways to describe Kimberly&#39;s pain.<br><br>Also, isn&#39;t abuse of canon characters a charge?

            <p>I&#39;ve always assumed that means that they die, at least in the context of the continuum currently under their influence.

            <p>Ah. Can&#39;t help you on that one. Have your agents got any handy powers that might help? Failing that, any canonical weapons that would help? Because I hear it&#39;s frowned on to bring weapons in from other continua.</p>

            <p>Both of them are actually human—so far, anyhow—but humans would be out of place at the point where they enter the Suefic.  So...they&#39;re going to have to take on another form.  Luckily, the beings as which they&#39;re going to be disguised have a power that&#39;s rather nifty against magic-using enemies.<br><br>As for weapons...they&#39;ve got crossbows (at least in one case) and sharp pointy objects.  Not only are these canonical, but one agent requests a specific type of crossbow from the continuum.  The secret weapon I&#39;m thinking of having them use against the eredar is either <i>directly</i> canonical, or a distillation of a canonical substance (if that&#39;s legit).  <br><br>In fact, I think the only non-canonical weapon that they may have is an industrial-strength Sharpie marker, if that counts.  (The current version of the story does have a mention of a camp knife.  However, not only is that <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=7005"><i>not</i></a> <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40772">necessarily</a> non-canonical, but it could easily be replaced by a dagger if it&#39;s too dubious.)</p>

            <p>So all I will say on this one is that you don&#39;t <i>need</i> confirmation of legitimacy for each and every assassination method. You&#39;ve got a method that suits canon, that your agents are capable of using (with a bit of luck and prayer, but then, we do have the power of narrative causality on our side), so just run with it.<br><br>Ah yes, disguises with powers. I tend to forget about those - we don&#39;t generally need disguises in the DBS, as there are rarely Sues, so I forget the disguise generator exists.<br><br>Funnily enough, despite not knowing the canon, I was thinking crossbows. You can&#39;t go wrong; they&#39;re Traditional. And if in doubt, you can always have the bolts be flaming.<br><br>Extrapolating from canon principles generally works, because of the Narrative Causality thing. Remember, the PPC is a world of stories, so if in doubt, refer to those narrative laws that we all learn as children. Eg &quot;It&#39;s a million to one chance, but it just might work&quot;, or technobabble in the spirit of the continuum, or whatever sounds like it <i>should</i> work.<br><br>I&#39;ll smile and nod at the marker pen. I&#39;m too drunk for such deep delvings into an unfamiliar canon.</p>

            <p>The Sun Crushers are arguably deadlier and harder to keep track of, and regular Agents have made liberal use of the Planet Shattering Kaboom before.(the Federation ship/portal set-up comes to mind) There&#39;s nothing really too great and terrible: the prototype would be much easier to destroy than the Crushers and is much more limited firepower wise. <br><br>If they&#39;re giving out TARDISs, disguise generators, and portal creators (only the last seems to have a fail-safe), a WMD wouldn&#39;t raise too many eyebrows(If Flowers had them, that is).</p>

            <p>The Federation ship and the multiple portals were because we <i>couldn&#39;t</i> use a Sun Crusher - they&#39;re not for general use. Hence agents, except those in DOGA, don&#39;t, as Neshomeh said, have too much awesome power at their fingertips.</p>

            <p>No offense intended, I just don&#39;t think his writing is the Holy Grail of PPCing people make it out to be. Also, even if there&#39;s nothing to suck up for, people still suck up to him. Something&#39;s instantly gold if his name is as much as vaguely attached to it, and honestly I get the feeling that if pretty much any other PPCer suggested anything for the overall &quot;plot&quot; (if there is one), they&#39;d be shouted down for not being him. But that could just be a vibe I get. I just don&#39;t like when people suck up to other people, especially when one person is elevated to be some kind of supreme ruler when everyone&#39;s input is supposedly of the same value. The only people who &quot;own&quot; the PPC are Jay and Acacia, wherever they are now, and even hS had to ask really nicely to be allowed to write in their setting. :P</p>

            <p>Since I&#39;m married to him, and have in fact been a PPCer for longer than he has, I can say this without being a -- hm -- suckup.<br><br>hS has spent nearly six years with the PPC.  He has been an active poster the entire time.  He&#39;s written hundreds of pages of PPC stories, written over forty characters, written and acted in the Playscriptes/Radio Plays, organised multiple Gatherings, created two PPC websites, crossed the Atlantic three times to meet up with people he knew from the Board, and seen the Board through almost every one of its major crises.  He has respect on the Board because he&#39;s put more time into the PPC than anyone else has, ever.  He&#39;s earned that respect.  When you&#39;ve put as many hundreds of hours into the PPC as he has, you&#39;ll have the same respect.  Until then, kindly stop projecting your insecurities onto my husband.  Thank you.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t have a problem with hS, never have. I respect what he&#39;s done, I like a lot of what he&#39;s done even if I think it&#39;s a bit overhyped (I never could get into Crashing Down, but that&#39;s just me, and it&#39;s been for no lack of trying), the only thing I possibly have a &quot;problem&quot; with is how some people act towards him, which he&#39;s already said makes him uncomfortable. I don&#39;t think he doesn&#39;t deserve respect, I just also don&#39;t think he&#39;s a deity and disagree with those who believe so, one of many reasons I&#39;m no longer welcome on the Board if my hunch is right. :P (Yes, that is a joke) But that&#39;s the last I&#39;ll say on the matter, especially since I&#39;ve &quot;clarified&quot; this point about five times already and it&#39;s honestly not going to make me any less despised for what I&#39;ve said. The problem was never with hS, was never meant to be such, it&#39;s just with how some, but not all, people act around him. That said, we can finally <i>drop</i> this useless topic.</p>

            <p>which means that his writing is as valid as anyone else&#39;s. It&#39;s hardly his fault if we all like it, is it?<br><br>Look, put it this way. Your PPC writing, and anyone&#39;s, for that matter, is considered canon once it&#39;s published. It&#39;s considered to Have Happened in the world of the PPC. And so does his. It&#39;s just he&#39;s tended to add to the greater mythos etc etc rather than just do missions. </p>

            <p>I wasn&#39;t saying he didn&#39;t have the right to add to things, heck, I&#39;VE been trying to flesh out parts of the &quot;greater mythos&quot; and the like, too. Kind of following in his footsteps except that I feel like he&#39;s the only one &quot;allowed&quot; to write like that. I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s his fault or people aren&#39;t allowed to like it. Heck, my only opinion on the matter is that while I like him as a person and enjoy some of his work, I think a lot of his writing is overhyped.</p>
