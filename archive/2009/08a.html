            <p>I spent some time with family not too long ago, and I have to say, the encounter made me a tad depressed. These relatives watch Fox News almost exclusively and bitch about &quot;Obama this, Obama that&quot; for stupid shit that frankly makes no sense. They didn&#39;t used to be like this, as far as I can recollect; they didn&#39;t used to watch Fox News 24/7. They used to be relatively normal people.<br>Let me add that I am an independent all the way and voted Obama; the man is not the Messiah and is far from perfect, but I believe he is the best person for the job.<br>I don&#39;t mean to start a flame war, but perhaps others could share stories with political nutjobs of all flavors.</p>

            <p>Glod, you make me thankful I don&#39;t live in your country.<br><br>That said, we had elections here recently. More important than most; these were elections for the European Parliament, and the interesting thing with the European Parliament is, unlike the national government, they&#39;ve actually heard of proportional representation. This makes me smile, and I had high hopes.<br><br>Unfortunately, I ended up having the same argument with my housemate that I&#39;ve had every year since he hit eighteen in 2004. I&#39;ll spare you the detailed ramble about why a European Parliament, if done properly, is an immensely excellent thing, and skip to the bit where my housemate didn&#39;t bother to vote because, once again, he assumed there was no point.<br><br>This was coupled with me discussing these elections with various people around the same time, and discovering one of our PPC members was going for voting UKIP, and one was going for the BNP.<br><br>You expect this from your family, I think. They&#39;re your blood, and you love them, no matter what, even when they hold some bloody weird views, and they <i>will</i> hold some bloody weird views. What I <i>wasn&#39;t</i> expecting was to have PPCers espousing the same views as the BNP. I passed on the arguing about it, because I&#39;m old enough to be jaded, but it was worrying in the extreme nonetheless.</p>

            <p>Actually, I was intending not to name names. Easier that way.<br><br>How exactly a bunch of racist nutters would <i>help a bit</i> I&#39;m not sure. My scepticism is based in large part on the fact that the party seems determined to lay every problem the country has at the feet of non-white citizens, and assumes forced repatriation will sort everything out and bring back to glorious days of Empire. I&#39;d rather have a government that&#39;s slightly more grounded in reality.</p>

            <p>Crap. Now I remember what I forgot to do. I was intending to quote Mass Effect. They have a BNP-like party called Terra Firma which is very pro-human. Even the xenophobe in your party is pissed with them for being racist, saying that (I believe, hence why I wanted to check), while there aims are good, they should do something, anything to weed out the extremists in the party. If the BNP did that, then they&#39;d be fine, as would UKIP, Labour, Conservatives, Lib Dem etc etc etc etc. It&#39;s not ideas that are at fault (... most of the time), it&#39;s the people that carry them out. Communism is pratically the perfect system. Humans, on the other hand, screwed it up enormously. Dictatorship is pratically the perfect system. Humans, on the other hand, screwed it up enormously. Democracy is pratically the perfect system. Humans, on the other hand, screwed it up enormously. I&#39;ve come to the not-so-thrilling conclusion that humans suck.</p>

            <p>not because I wasn:t elegable, but because I wasn:t in the country.<br><br>I am not a fan of the American system, where the draw out the length of the voting period to practically over a year (waiste money much?).  But Canada called an election and finished it all withing three weeks.  Yes WEEKS.  I didn:t even hear about the election until one week to it.  There was absolutly no time for me to register and get a ballot in time for the dead line.<br><br>I was just glad that the out come was contrary to the PMs hopes.  He saw it as a seat grabbing exersise, but in the end he lost a bunch.  Then again, if he waited out the term maybe we would have gotten a different PM because enough people are sick of him now.<br><br>Just my two cents.<br><br>L </p>

            <p>Three weeks? Now that is impressive.<br><br>Mind you, ours don&#39;t tend to be loitering for very long between being called and actually occurring. This may be because the government has this little habit of waiting until public opinion is in their favour and then calling an election for as soon as humanly possible, lest things swing the other way in the interim.</p>

            <p>There are legitimate reasons to not vote, honestly. Like, for example, disagreeing with 1) the process of voting, in general, how it&#39;s handled, 2) all of the candidates, in every single possible way (except the basics, like &quot;murder is bad&quot;), 3) the government, in almost every tangible way.<br><br>I won&#39;t vote in the next election. Or I&#39;ll do the blank ballot thing. This government <i>sucks</i>, all governments suck, I am an anarchist, and I think it&#39;s ridiculous that this country/government/society puts so much pressure on everyone to &quot;VOTE! VOTE! YOU ARE UNDESERVING OF THIS COUNTRY IF YOU DON&#39;T VOTE&quot; especially since there&#39;s so much misinformation and stupidity thrown around pre-elections, and most people are incredibly misinformed, and the whole thing is just UGH.</p>

            <p>Yeah; this guy, however, was a rich white kid who had everything he could ever want and didn&#39;t vote not because he had anything against the system, or had issues with government--he just didn&#39;t care. As long as he had his video games, and porn, and crappy restaurant food, he cared about nothing else. It&#39;s one thing to care and not vote--it&#39;s entirely different to be an apathetic bumhole with tunnel vision and stunted social growth. It was like 1984...<br>Anyways, I vote because there is always someone I want in office. I&#39;m okay with the voting system. Also, I always remind myself that, less than a hundred years ago, women couldn&#39;t vote. I better damn well get my ass to the local polls to honor the women who fought for suffrage (as a feminist, this is important to me.)</p>

            <p>My scariest with the BNP was I thought we were safe. I thought we&#39;d had a few nutters around who really hadn&#39;t put the slightest moment&#39;s thought in. And then, a couple of weeks later, when who&#39;d voted for whom was all academic, it turned out <i>my</i> constituency was the only one in Europe who&#39;d voted out some vaguely liberal type and voted in the <i>...ing</i> BNP.<br><br>It seemed scary but in in an academic way. <br><br>And then I had more than one conversation with PPCers who&#39;d actually voted for those ...s. I had conversations with people I&#39;d thought were reasonable human beings, but it turned out they&#39;d <i>deliberately</i> voted for that. You have trouble with your family, because they vote like that. I have trouble with this <i>entire damned Board</i>, because before you know it, people you thought were vaguely reasonable, and might have ideas that didn&#39;t quite jive with yours but nothing major, suddenly, when it finally counts, they&#39;re votting for the <i>...ing BNP</i>. You expect your family to vote against you. They&#39;re still your family.<br><br>I thought here we&#39;d maybe have some common ground.<br><br>No.<br><br>...ing BN ...ing P.<br><br>Of the two here I talked to, one was appalled when I pointed out what their policies mean, but it was too late, the vote had been cast. The other, my objections didn&#39;t mean shite. That person still thought the best vote was for the ...ing BNP.<br><br>Arguments with family over politics would be preferable. My family won&#39;t change their views based on what I say, but I know they&#39;ll listen. And it&#39;s academic anyway; we&#39;ve all, without ever being coerced to it, ended up voting Lib Dem. <br><br>I find it a ...load scarier that here, where we&#39;re meant to be a sort of meeting of minds, and we&#39;re all meant to have common ground... even here, I find supporters of the ...ing BNP. And not just supporters, but people who&#39;ll argue any line, fight any fight, and <i>still</i> vote for the <i>...ing</i> BNP.<br><br>On behalf of Yorkshire, Europe, I&#39;m sorry.</p>

            <p>And that would be because you live somewhere reasonably safe, where the worst that can happen to you personally based on your vote is having arguments about it. Some places, some times, you or your family could be ostracised, you could lose your job, be attacked or even killed simply based on how you voted. If you know that&#39;s the case it takes a lot of guts to vote how you want to rather than voting for the party that won&#39;t get your kneecaps smashed. In the interests of not intimidating voters, we therefore have secret ballots.</p>

            <p>Yeah, we are pretty much safe in that regard, but the safety is maintained by the secret ballot. We don&#39;t have much politically based violence, because we&#39;ve no way of distinguishing between Us and Them and so working out who to attack.<br><br>Example: say you vote for the BNP. And then say you&#39;re applying for a job, and the bloke interviewing you is a hardcore Green Party member.

            <p>Aye, I know, it just came as a shock. Mind you, politics has a tendency to do that.

            <p>It&#39;s scary to find out your friends suddenly turn out to hold views that turn your stomach.<br><br>The thing I found scariest about the EP elections, though, was that a lot of the people who wanted to be elected into EP didn&#39;t even know how they can influence policy in EP and for which policy influences they need to be in the national parliament (these &quot;politicians&quot; wanted to vote no on things in EP which the EP doesn&#39;t even vote on, and for which a no in the national parliament actually carries weight).<br><br>I&#39;m sure every countries has sent its share of idiots to EP. I&#39;m starting to think the EP is a modern form of bannishment. </p>

            <p>Back during campaignin&#39; time, my mom was helping out at a Boy Scout camp. She was sitting down to eat with the other staff, and they were all going on about how great Sarah Palin is, and how perfect she is for the job, and how McCain did a great thing when he chose her as his running mate.<br><br>Consider now that they were referring to a woman who has made disconcertingly stupid comments, who answers questions without really answering them (granted, many politicians do this, but her way of doing it is more distinct them most), who is COMPLETELY inexperienced, and who, to top it all off, is very proud of the fact that she shoots moose from helicopters for fun.<br><br>My mother, who was a supporter of Obama, reacted thus:<br><br>&quot;Wait, you&#39;re saying you want four more years of stupid? You like what Bush has been doing for the past eight years, and you want four more years of it? Really?&quot;<br><br>That shut them ALL up.</p>

            <p>When I heard a film called G-Force was coming out, I immediately of the old eighties anime that I watched as a (very small) kid. That would&#39;ve been fun.

            <p>Freaking Disney...they haven&#39;t made a good movie since 1995 or so. Okay, so I liked Lilo and Stitch, and Hercules was all right. And their Pixar stuff is great, but their live action and traditional animation stuff has gotten more sickening over the years. I wouldn&#39;t have liked this movie even as a kid. I can only hope The Princess and the Frog jumpstarts Disney into better quality.</p>

            <p>Hello, people. I&#39;m not sure if you remember me, but I used to post on this board fairly often until about six months ago. I had two shiny new Agents and was working on my first mission when I veered off into real life and never really returned.<br><br>Well, I&#39;ve been thinking about the PPC a lot lately--usually at night, when I&#39;m trying to sleep--and I&#39;ve decided to give it another shot. I&#39;m trying to write a lot more often these days, mostly fanstuff, but I&#39;m hoping to get it together to polish this original story I&#39;ve got stashed somewhere.<br><br>So. Uh.

            <p>I got one of my Agents off of you! She&#39;s been nagging at me the way characters do. &quot;Hey Fiveclawed, you said you&#39;d write me once summer break started, but it&#39;s nearly August and you haven&#39;t done *CENSORED*! Get up off your lazy tuchus and get back onto LJ!&quot; This is problematic, since LJ doesn&#39;t seem to be working at the moment, but it doesn&#39;t matter to her. She&#39;s threatening me with her necromancer bells.<br><br>The original story involved this Tibetan woman who was living in exile who comes back to Tibet after her long-lost brother contacts her. I actually finished the story but saved it onto a USB drive, and then my mother LOST IT. After that I had a hard time bringing myself back to the story, and then the Tibetan riots broke out in China, so I think I&#39;m gonna have to put some pretty major changes into place. Like I said, I&#39;m not working on it now; I&#39;m focusing on writing fan-based stuff to get back into the swing of things. Think training wheels on a bike.</p>

            <p>Well, there are a few fantasy books/series with sentient tall ships already... the Liveship Traders from Robin Hobb is the most well-known example. There&#39;s another in which the ships are dragons, but they&#39;re not quite sentient. I can&#39;t remember the title right now. And I would have like to get my hands on the &quot;Sails ans sorcery&quot; anthology to see if there are others.<br>But the main difference between these and my ideas is my sentient tall ships have their own society.</p>

            <p>Not from a mission, but:<br>Grimmjow Jaegerjaques, Bleach.

(Oh how I wish fanbrats would <i>stop</i> butchering his character like that already.)<br><br>Ulquiorra Schiffer, Bleach. In FicPsych to have his emotions removed after overexposure to Sues and/or non-canonical love interests. He&#39;s meant to be even less emotive than a Vulcan, which is something that most Suethors, and bad slashers, forget.<br><br>Aizen Sousuke, Bleach. In FicPsych due to being turned into a genuinely kind and caring person, instead of a cold, calculating sociopath who only sees others as pawns to be manipulating according to his will.<br><br><br>Grimmjow and Ulquiorra are GivenName FamilyName, Aizen is FamilyName Given Name.<br><br>Aizen is the sort who is likely to start plotting a takeover once he&#39;s recovered enough to resemble his canon self. Keeping his sword away from him and preventing him from having contact with Ulquiorra and Grimmjow is probably a good idea. Ulquiorra won&#39;t act without orders from Aizen, but Grimmjow may require frequent sedation to keep him from looking for Macroviruses to tear apart or vaporise, especially if he&#39;s been cooped up for a while.<br><br>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Recently I&#39;ve been noticing more and more slash fans that, at the very least, dislike fictional heterosexuality in all its forms. On the other hand I&#39;ve also become more aware of the opposite attitude amongst het writers. Very few writers I&#39;ve seen are actually willing to consider both het and slash as viable options. I know it&#39;s probably just me paying more attention, but it&#39;s an interesting phenomenon nonetheless.<br><br>Het fans of the PPC, how do you feel about slash? Slashers, what do you think of het? Is anyone here an equal fan of both het and slash? If you&#39;re firmly on one side, what puts you off reading the other, if there&#39;s a specific reason that you feel like sharing?</p>

            <p>As long as it&#39;s a goodfic, anything goes. And as long as it&#39;s realistic, no ten-second romances or anything; I&#39;m vehemently against the concept of &#39;love at first sight&#39; and related things. Love takes time or hardship, and lots of fics apply neither of the two to the pair. These are normally considered badfic.<br><br>Mostly, though, I prefer nonromance plots or ones where the romance is not the main plot. I like stories more when the ships, canon or not, occur as an aside instead of dominating the story. Large or small, it&#39;s subplots most of the time. After all, it seems somewhat silly to have a world where people live for relationships alone.</p>

            <p><i>it seems somewhat silly to have a world where people live for relationships alone.</i><br><br>Mostly true, except when the protagonist is a teenage girl. Obsession with potential romances is a common theme of those years.<br><br>I was pondering last night why I like plot in books, but I&#39;m less fussed when I&#39;m reading on the screen. Didn&#39;t come to any conclusions at all, except possibly that fic with lots of plot tends to be on the long side, and I&#39;ve more patience for a long read in book form.

            <p>Slashfic sounds like all the characters are being murdered and they need to solve the mystery before everyone is dead.<br><br>And het just sounds like a pairing between a hat and a net, which, sadly, is exactly the kind of nonsense I expect from fanfic writers in general.<br><br><br>I am, however, always willing to read a good pairing, and whether the characters work together matters to me more than the statuses of the individuals involved.<br><br><br>Heck, I once read a well-written pairing between Plank and the Companion Cube, after Johnny had been abducted by GLaDOS.</p>

            <p>This is mostly because I dislike romance fics as a whole, and whenever I see a summary that includes either <i>slash</i> or <i>yaoi</i> (how on earth do you pronounce that, anyway?), I always get the impression that said fic is entirely <i>about</i> the slash*. Which, to me, is boring and likely to involve canon rape (as is shipping in general). I know this isn&#39;t always the case, but I don&#39;t want to wade through the 999 pieces of crap to find the single gem.<br><br>*This applies to yuri as well, but it&#39;s a lot less common.</p>

            <p>I hadn&#39;t thought about it before, but that&#39;s the impression I get, too - if &quot;slash&quot; is in the summary, I think it&#39;s all about a slash relationship.<br><br>Though in all fairness, that&#39;s probably because so many of the &#39;fics out there centre on a romance of some sort - if I see &quot;Harry/Ginny&quot; in a summary, I tend to expect it to be a romance as well, or at least focused on them.

            <p>Possibly a Hopeless Romantic, but I&#39;d like to think I have some sense. That said, if you&#39;re asking what I like to read, then it&#39;d be lovely to have more stories around that don&#39;t involve romance at all... but then, it&#39;s rather hard to cut it out entirely, since all character interaction between a pair (or not-pair, as the case may be) can be affected by the percieved relationship - body language, terms of endearment, and so on. <br><br>As for labels, maybe we should start a habit of labelling all stories as &quot;slash&quot; OR &quot;het&quot; OR &quot;no romance&quot; - treat the &quot;het&quot; label as being as necessary as the &quot;slash&quot; label and see if it catches on?</p>

            <p>One reason I&#39;m fond of obscure pairings that are neither confirmed nor denied nor vaguely alluded to in the least either way in canon, is that one can have fics with an established relationship in, without people being able to say &quot;that&#39;s OOC!&quot; And if you&#39;ve got an established relationship in there, the fic <i>doesn&#39;t</i> have to be filled with all the getting-together romantic wossnames and first-time angst and such. It can have plot instead, and be like any book or fic in which Plot Occurs and two of the characters happen to be together.<br><br>(Of course, this does not stop me from being a sucker for a well-written first time fic, but constant romance just gets boring.)</p>

            <p>I feel it may be time to point out, in response to a notion more than one people have hinted at subscribing to, that there is such a thing as Good Slash. <br><br>Some people, it seems (whether here or in IMs on the topic), object to the fact that slash pairings simply aren&#39;t canonical, or that in slash canonical pairings are disregarded, or even that to make a character non-straight is to make them wildly OOC. I invite all of these people to check the standard DBS charge list.<br><br>If slash is Good Slash, then canonical het pairings are acknowledged. If a canonical het pairing stands in the way of a slash pairing, then in Good Slash the het relationship will be dissolved via a well structured and well written plot, with all due care and respect paid to the source material. Given that the whole point of fanfiction is to alter aspects of canon, I see no problem here.<br><br>&quot;But they&#39;re canonically straight&quot; is one I&#39;m not touching right now, because it&#39;s been done to death, and it&#39;s the insistence upon the heteronormative status quo inherent in that statement that, in part, drives me to slash.<br><br>And finally, the OOC thing. In Good Slash, the characters are not out of character. This is because Good Slash is, by definition, well written slash, and well written fic keeps the characters in character.<br><br>So, bearing all this in mind, and seconding Trojie&#39;s point that the Happy AU Where Everyone Is Gay is a great big cross on the &quot;Bad&quot; side of the equation, I can&#39;t see any reason for objection to slash pairings in fiction. If a fic&#39;s solely about the pairing, and that pairing&#39;s not your cup of tea, fair play, but some slash on the side, for the sake of realism? Who could object to that?<br><br>Oh, and while we&#39;re at it, is it time to borrow ffr&#39;s standard disclaimer: &quot;Except in Torchwood&quot;? Because anyone objecting to slash fic in <i>that</i> fandom is clearly not watching the same show as the rest of us.</p>

The best slash usually has some het in there too, and that doesn&#39;t bother us slashers in the least. Sure, I tell her off for writing smelly het, but it&#39;s mostly a joke born of my defensiveness about slash. And the defensiveness comes in part from the inequality; no one minds a bit of het on the side in their slash, but people get very vocal about not wanting the slightest hint of slash in their het.</p>

            <p>One would hope. I suspect it may take rather more than ten years though. Unless they&#39;re marketed as LGBT, it&#39;s pretty hard to find a book today in which characters just happen to be non-heterosexual. I&#39;m hoping this may change within a few decades as more and more of the slash writers who&#39;ve cropped up over the past decade start writing original fiction and getting it published, but even then there&#39;s the publishing industry&#39;s standards to take into account.</p>

            <p>In practically all of Marcedes Lackey`s books there is at least one slash pairing amoung the het.  Most of the time it is just a background mention, but some times it is the main character.<br><br>She is also not discrimenatory in gender as well.  She slashes both.  About one couple in ten in her stories are slash, which I think is about right statistic.<br><br>These books are aimed at an older teen to adult level of reading (I read most of them when I was younger though).  But since she writes fantasy, that maybe one of the reasons that she goes by unnoticed in that regaurd.<br><br>Leto</p>

            <p>I admit that I sort of had plans to be part of the problem in this case; I was going to write a teen-level book, featuring two characters who acted as gay for each other as I could possibly make them without actually holding their wedding on stage, just so I could pretend to be horrified when people asked me if I meant it that way. Yeah, my sense of humour is a little odd.</p>

            <p>When it comes to reading, I&#39;m not really a &#39;shipper in any sense of the word. Romance is fine if it happens, but I won&#39;t be disappointed if there is none at all. Slash, het... it&#39;s all the same to me. Both can be done well, both can make me want to vomit.<br><br>Funny thing about me, though: I dig romance that arises in role-play--especially screwed-up, complicated romance--but I don&#39;t particularly enjoy writing it on my own. Again, straight or gay makes no difference. I have brought characters to the brink of relationships only to take them away, and I have created established couples (successes and failures), but I don&#39;t do putting them together. There&#39;s just something weird and maybe fake about it. I dunno. *shrug*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>On a fundamental, subconscious level, I don&#39;t believe in slash, in much the same way that I don&#39;t believe in breathing underwater.<br><br>This does not mean that I run screaming from the merest whiff of same-gender interaction; I have no objection to interaction, friendship, even situations that look compromising, between two persons of the same gender.

            <p>because, while I do have some gay relationships in my stories, I don&#39;t think I have just them. I have het as the main thing because, obviously, that&#39;s what happens in real life and if I&#39;m trying to keep my characters real, I&#39;m not going to have them all turn gay in an instant. I have played with a few small fics set around a gay character, but those never amount to anything.<br><br>I&#39;m also more comfortable with femslash. Don&#39;t know why. Could be I&#39;ve read more bad slash than bad femslash. All I know is that the majority of my gay/bisexual characters are women and there&#39;s only one male/male relationship I can think of and I can&#39;t actually remember what fic that was in.<br><br>Honestly, though, I don&#39;t give a toss. I&#39;ll read good stories, regardless of what the hell is happening in it. The reason I stay away from slash a bit is possibly due to seeing more bad fics attempt to pair off two random characters who <i>hate each other</i> and do it appallingly. I&#39;d type more, but I keep thinking of something else to add mid-paragraph and that makes me forget what I was saying to begin with.</p>

            <p>... I&#39;m a slasher. Always have been, always will be, since the beginning of my stumblings into fandom. <br><br>However, there are places in my heart for het pairings, both canon and non-canon, which I cherish and love and dislike seeing wrecked. It&#39;s just ... those all tend to be in fandoms I don&#39;t actively read or write for. <br><br>Reading het almost bores me, to be honest. Het is ... well, the majority. A well-written slashfic can have so many little edges of &#39;forbidden&#39; and &#39;what will our friends/neighbours/relatives/coworkers think?&#39; and all that society and psychology stuff to it ... that&#39;s what I like.<br><br>Which is not to say that all those things cannot be found in het fic, but slashfic also has, for me at least, one other feature: the slightly less literary and more self-serving aspect of, I am a straight woman, I find men attractive, and you know what&#39;s more attractive than one man? Two men!<br><br>As far as I&#39;m concerned though, there doesn&#39;t have to be &#39;het VS slash&#39;. They can coexist. Maybe not in the same person&#39;s brain, necessarily, but one is not better than the other. They are different.<br><br>Actually I&#39;ve read some lovely fics that centre on multiple partnerships - both slash and het. There&#39;s nothing worse than fic set in the Magical World Where Everyone Is Gay and all the couples happen to be same-sex. <br><br>/end ramble as it&#39;s nearly midnight<br><br>- A possibly slightly incoherent Trojie, who isn&#39;t keeping up with her intarwub responsibilities well lately...<br><br></p>

            <p>I have a great problem whenever this question comes up because, in spite of the best efforts of our dear Pads, I just can&#39;t read slash without hitting the &quot;back&quot; button. <br><br>I have nothing against it - really, I would like to <i>strangle</i> the next person who accuses me of being a homophobe, because there is a DIFFERENCE between not approving of something and just not wanting to be a part of it - I liken it to the difference between knowing your parents had to have sex to concieve you and actually watching them do it. That&#39;s how I feel.<br><br>So as you can guess, I don&#39;t read slash in any form. I just side-step it. I can&#39;t say I understand why people write it, but neither can I understand why people write non-canon pairings - and yes, that question has been anwered for me several times by several people, so I get the theory, but I myself have never really been inclined towards any uncanonical pairings.<br><br>I think it has something to do with the way I percieve the original canon stories themselves; I see them as a cohesive whole, and if Character A &#39;originally&#39; (ie, in canon) fell in love with Character B, then I feel like something major would have to change in their personality/characterisation for them to fall for someone else. This may, however, be related to the kinds of stories I read; I tend to go for more fairytale-like interpretations, too. I&#39;m sure it doesn&#39;t help that, Dumbledore/Grindelwald aside, none of my main fandoms involve slash pairings of any sort. <br><br>I&#39;m rambling now, but is it making sense? To answer your question directly, my own sexuality - as a woman attracted to men - basically controls the sorts of relationships I like to read about. I can&#39;t really understand(/internalise) why other people have other tastes, but that doesn&#39;t bother me in itself - I&#39;m quite happy to live and let live. <br><br>It is an interesting phenomena, though, and I&#39;ll be more than interested to read everyone else&#39;s opinions.</p>

            <p>A lot of what I read is femmeslash, but I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m a slasher. If I&#39;m looking for mindless romance, or *winces* smut, it&#39;s gonna be femmeslash, chances are, since I&#39;m a lesbian.

            <p>I mainly stick to reading het fanfictions, just because most of the canonical pairings in my favorite book series are het. I don&#39;t mind original fiction slash, but I don&#39;t see much of it around, either. I really can&#39;t read slash fanfiction because, for some reason, I can&#39;t stand the thought of my favorite canonical pairings disappearing. The nausea I feel at the thought of a Draco/Hermione fic is the same amount I feel at the thought of a Draco/Harry fic. To me, once there is a canonical pairing, as stated or as written by the author, I think it should stay that way in fanfiction. At least in what I read, fanfiction wise. Yeah, the shipping wars are scary, but I don&#39;t join in them, if possible. <br>Hermione/Ron, Astoria/Draco, and Ginny/Harry FTW!<br>I understand the slash fanfics with characters who didn&#39;t have canonical pairings and sort of implied what type of pairing they would prefer. *coughUblazcough* Those I can stand, but they are few and far between.<br></p>

            <p>Ah, canon pairings, one of the most abused aspects of fanfiction.<br><br>I&#39;m lucky in that the two confirmed, <i>named</i> canon pairings in my main fandom aren&#39;t an obstacle to slash by the main canon timeline. Both of the wives in those pairings are dead, one to an illness and the other protecting her son. Somehow my fandom seems to be sane enough that those two women are mostly respected, partly due to the effects they had on the characters that they interacted with.<br><br>As for your Harry Potter examples... I&#39;ve never really been a fan of Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny myself. The former is built on the fact that they argue with each other constantly and the latter is, to me, Harry trying to be like James by having a wife who looks like Lily. Remus/Tonks is a pairing I definitely hate that, as I said to Pads in chat earlier, seems to me like JK was reading fanfiction while she was writing. It seems deliberately forced in to piss off the Sirius/Remus slashers.<br><br>As for slash with characters with no canonical pairings, again I&#39;m lucky in that my main fandom is a shounen manga/anime, where romance isn&#39;t really a priority. There are hints at one-sided crushes and massive amounts of manipulated love, but very few confirmed love interests, giving me plenty of leeway as to who I pair characters with.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m lean quite heavily towards slash, personally. It makes up the bulk of what I read and write on the internet. I see nothing wrong with het though, especially now that I&#39;ve started looking at the het subtext in my main canon, as well as the slash. <br><br>My main reason for avoiding het fics is the fact that very few het pairings interest me, and it&#39;s pretty hard to find well-written fics for the ones that do.

            <p>To me, it really doesn&#39;t matter as long as it&#39;s at least somewhat plausible of a pairing. (Snape and Dumbledore?  No, not seeing it.)

            <p>I comes bearing links. *drags out Big Bag O&#39; Links and digs through it* I know you has some of these already, since you mention the Wiki, but as I don&#39;t know which ones you&#39;ve found...<br><br>First off is the link to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">Wiki</a>, a veritable fount of information for a newbie to read through. Especially helpful for you if you want to write missions would be the page on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> (note the capital P).<br><br>I would advise against reading any <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>, unless you are of strong mind and stomach. Even the summaries have been known to give those of weaker constitution nightmares.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, not knowing what you have already managed to find, I have several links for you. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek) is a good place to start, as the PPC did many aeons ago. <s>What do you mean I&#39;m exaggerating?</s> <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">The Department of Geographical Aberrations</a> is another interesting place to visit, if you have the time and inclination. Also by hS is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/index.htm">Tangled Webs</a> site, which contains backstory for the PPC as an organisation. If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be. And last, but most definitely not least, <a href="http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/65922.html">Response Centre 45</a> is where Trojie and Pads&#39; missions are archived.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay here.

            <p>I&#39;m feeling unusually chatty lately...<br>Anyways, to counter my more serious topic, a fun and bubbly one! That&#39;s right, it&#39;s post your favorite fanfic time! Doesn&#39;t matter what fandom, post it up! Here&#39;s mine:<br><b>Fandom:</b> X-Men: Evolution<br><b>Author:</b> King of the Worthless<br><b>Title:</b> Brotherhood Five: The Fugitive Nine<br><b>Link:</b> <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4190186/1/Brotherhood_Five_The_Fugitive_Nine"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4190186/1/Brotherhood_Five_The_Fugitive_Nine">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4190186/1/Brotherhood_Five_The_Fugitive_Nine</a></a><br>Even though it&#39;s located in the Pit, I think it&#39;s awesome. It&#39;s like a spin-off of Evolution, focusing on the Brotherhood instead of the X-Men. Plenty of action and humor, with a good plot and good grammar--whoda thunk?</p>

            <p>Fandom: crossover between Ranma 1/2 and Sailor Moon (yeah, I know)<br>Author: Fire<br>Title: Destiny&#39;s Child<br>Link: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/26926/1/Destinys_Child"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/26926/1/Destinys_Child">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/26926/1/Destinys_Child</a></a><br>This, I think, is one of the best fukufics I&#39;ve ever read, with the possible exception of one or two which are still in progress, and I&#39;ll need to see how they end to decide if they&#39;re better.  Namely, Contrast Match and A Time Apart.<br>Sure, it has Ranma collecting entirely too much stuff, but the idea is that the events of Ranma happen well in the past, and they&#39;re entirely less... momentous, and he&#39;s been hanging around collecting things till now.<br><br>Besides, he kinda needs it to match power levels properly.</p>

            <p>...and most of them are by a small number of authors.<br><br>The <a href="http://2metaldog.livejournal.com/187821.html">Bleach Ficlet: Dare To Live</a> and <a href="http://2metaldog.livejournal.com/120155.html">Saiyuki Serial: Beautifully Broken Evolution</a> by LJ&#39;s <a href="http://2metaldog.livejournal.com/">Iron Dog</a> are among my favourites. Her two-part <a href="http://2metaldog.livejournal.com/246440.html">Orgy Fics</a> are what introduced me to her writing, and they&#39;re the best cross-fandom eight-man orgies I&#39;ve ever seen written. <br><br>Another favourite writer of mine is <a href="http://bleach.adultfanfiction.net/authors.php?no=1296781982">Dracoqueen22</a>, and her large number of Bleach fics, especially her <a href="http://bleach.adultfanfiction.net/story.php?no=600010733">Of Violence</a> fic, which is the best story on the topic of spousal abuse that I have ever seen in any fandom. Dracoqueen22 is also on ffn under the same name, which I no longer frequent all that often.<br><br>Unless, of course, I&#39;m tempted there by <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/40404/DelMarch">DelMarch</a>. I might be biased here because she primarily writes about my two favourite characters, but she is a good writer whose work I love reading.<br><br><a href="http://bleach.adultfanfiction.net/story.php?no=600010603">A Shadow of What Was</a> is another of my favourites. It&#39;s pretty long, and not yet finished so it may take anyone who attempts it a while to read.<br><br>And, of course, there is the Poignant Pevensie Porn series, as well as the Seamus/Dumbledore fic written by our very own Pads and Trojie, that can be found on <a href="http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/65922.html">this post</a>, below all the PPC stuff.</p>

            <p>Did you know that most chocolate companies get their cocoa from slave plantations in Africa? Well, now you know. They do. Huge amounts of child labor.<br><br>There&#39;s genocide going on in the Sudan. That, there&#39;s not a lot we can do about, other than educate people, raise hell until it&#39;s stopped. (Check it out as soon as you get a chance, though-- Google &quot;Darfur Genocide.&quot;) The AIDS emergency is sweeping the continent of Africa, killing hundreds of thousands of women and children. Malaria kills huge amounts of people on its own; famine is another huge problem.<br><br>All of these, Americans can honestly say we are not actively contributing to. (English, Aussies, Germans, etc. I mean first-world countries in general; as an American, it&#39;s easier for me to talk about my country, and my countrymen, and I also feel like less of a hypocrite getting on a soapbox.) <s>I mean, besides supporting China, which is funding the Darfur genocide... but that&#39;s neither here nor there.</s> We didn&#39;t create civil war, or famine, or malaria, or AIDS, and other than <a href="http://www.one.org/">support the organisations</a> doing something and pray, what can we do? (there are things. but most people don&#39;t really want to be that involved, or don&#39;t care enough, or don&#39;t have the resources. but anyway.)<br><br>But there&#39;s something more. On the Western Coast of Africa (mostly Ghana and Cote d&#39;Voire), there are slave plantations. And a lot of child labor. And I honestly mean slave labor. Not wage-slaves, not sweatshop-labor, (though both of those are also deplorable), but honest-to-goodness forced labor without pay in horrible living conditions, underfed, abused. And this is where most of the world&#39;s chocolate comes from. <br><br>Which means, in the end, that almost every chocolate bar you&#39;ve ever had (there may be exceptions, but not a lot of them) has been produced by partly slave labor. It&#39;s impossible to tell whether or not a particular bar was produced by a plantation-- by the time the cocoa beans make it to the processing factory, it&#39;s impossible to trace them back. <br><br>What can you do?<br><br>1) DON&#39;T BUY IT. Refuse to buy, or eat, chocolate from companies that use slave labor.<br>1A) Chocolate is not a necessity, whatever marketing has led you to believe. You will survive without M&amp;Ms.<br>1B) If you refuse to pay for chocolate that has been produced by slave labor, you are sending the message that this is wrong, and you will not support it.<br>1C) There are other ways! Fair Trade chocolate is always bought from farmers at a fair price, meaning that their workers have fair conditions and they still make an actual profit.<br><br>2) Write to those who have influence! The companies themselves, whatever politicians you have influence (as a constituent) over, the upper-leaning officials of the company, the shareholders... whatever it takes.<br><br>3) SPREAD THE WORD. This is the most important thing you can do. Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your teachers, acquaintances, coworkers, tell everyone. Because, it may be idealistic of me, but I refuse to believe that more people than not would eat chocolate still if they knew where it came from. <br><br>Also, there&#39;s a facebook group <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/group.php?gid=234371580290">here</a>. <br>The list of fair-trade companies is <a href="http://vision.ucsd.edu/~kbranson/stopchocolateslavery/main.html">here</a>.</p>

            <p>The only Fairtrade chocolate producers in the Philippines that I&#39;ve seen are Ben and Jerry&#39;s and maybe (low chance of having it) Guittard. And they aren&#39;t particularly accessible, either. I am likely screwed in terms of chocolate if I stop buying from other sources.</p>

            <p>Actually, though, not all Ben and Jerry&#39;s stuff is fair trade either. Some of it is, though. *shrug* Most of the stuff around here is rather expensive, and harder to reach than regular chocolate, but I figure if it&#39;s a choice between being out of chocolate and supporting slave labor... eh, yeah. Turns out I&#39;m not as addicted as I thought.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think they sell exclusively Fairtrade, but they have products labelled as such, and that&#39;s a start at least. I might email their HQ saying this is good and they might wanna consider using Fairtrade chocolate in more of their products - anyone want to join me? The more people say so, the more chance they&#39;ll listen. Probably people have already asked them this, but we might as well join in.<br><br>I don&#39;t like Green &amp; Blacks&#39;, it&#39;s weirdly bitter, but as a rule I&#39;ve found stuff labelled Fairtrade tastes better than stuff that&#39;s not labelled as such. Might be psychosomatic on my part, but hey. (My one experience with Fairtrade orange juice, however, was horrible, and sticking to my principles is not worth drinking stuff that tastes like orange-flavoured vinegar. I&#39;ll send the protest organisations a cheque instead.)</p>

            <p>Nice mission.<br>Some nitpicks.<br><br>All the paragraphs have a one space indentation. I only noticed the indentation on my second look at story. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to indent when leaving a blank line between paragraphs.<br><br><i> “You’re my new partner, then?” she asked cheerfully, ignoring how naked she was.<br><br>“Nadine Moreno,” she said awkwardly, nodding.</i><br><br>Two things here: (1) in both sentences a &quot;she&quot; is referred to, both they are two different people. A little more distinction would be nice. (2) &quot;Ignoring how naked she was&quot; is Jodi&#39;s POV, while up to that point everything had been Nadine&#39;s POV. Some people (I imagine mainly those that have read a lot about keeping POVs consistent) would find such a switch jarring. (It&#39;s much later that Nadine notices she can follow her partner&#39;s POV, which I find a great escape for POVs that sometimes wander.)<br><br><i>Guessing that she was finished getting dressed, Nadine turned around and saw her sitting on the edge of one of the bookshelves.</i><br><br>Blame my high-school education for this one: whenever I see &quot;she&quot; I think the antecedent is the last female mentioned previously. In this case Nadine. Which made this sentence confusing on first reading it. Changing &quot;she&quot; with Jodi or the girl would sort that.<br><br><i>“Hey, if you’re going to clean for me, it’s fine with me,” Jodi said. Nadine smiled slightly, and nodded.<br><br>“Do you know when we’re going on our next mission?” she asked, sitting back on the bed and pulling off her boots. Her partner grinned.</i><br><br>The people that say, &quot;start a new paragraph when a new person starts speaking&quot; are not entirely right. A new paragraph can (should, depending on how strict you are) start when a new person starts acting or speaking. Which means that when a person first acts and then says something then that can be done in the same paragraph. In the above example:<br><br>“Hey, if you’re going to clean for me, it’s fine with me,” Jodi said. <br><br>Nadine smiled slightly, and nodded. “Do you know when we’re going on our next mission?” she asked, sitting back on the bed and pulling off her boots. <br><br>Her partner grinned. (...)<br><br>Could you make direct quotes from the fic stand out in some way (putting them in italics, bracketting them, opening the paragraph with a minus sign) so that  a distinction can be made between what you wrote and what came from the fic?<br><br>After the impostors are apprehended Nadine seems to take charge of the situation and Jodi, her more experienced partner, just waits around for her. This seems unlikely for a seasoned agent and a cat-person. I imagine neither to be good at following orders. Waiting impatiently because their partner had run off with the equipment they needed, that I can imagine.</p>

            <p>I opened the story and enlarged the font once. Then all the paragraphs (except the first) I could see had a one space indent. I apparently assumed without checking that this is a layout thing throughout the story. Should have checked; have checked again now. When I scrolled down there were a few more with indent, but also without indent. At 25% in I guess most paragraphs were without indent.<br></p>

            <p>So, Cassie and I have been discussing arrangements for the Gathering. We&#39;ve decided on a date and time: Saturday September 5th, 1pm, outside the Leeds Royal Armouries. (It would be great if everyone coming could eat lunch before they come, it&#39;ll save us having to find somewhere.) After we&#39;ve done with that, we&#39;re going to head to OK Karaoke. It&#39;s half an hour&#39;s walk away, through the shopping precinct, so we can stop and pick up snacks if we want and browse in the bookshops if everyone&#39;s agreeable, because we&#39;re PPCers and need books to live :) I&#39;ve emailed the bar in question asking if we&#39;re likely to need an advance booking. If we do, it&#39;s £10 per person per hour with a recommended minimum of two hours and we have to show up at a set time, so I&#39;m hoping we don&#39;t need to, but I&#39;ve asked anyway and will tell you when they get back to me. Anyone need Googlemaps showing the aforementioned locations?<br><br>I&#39;ll be burning CDs of the PPC Mix I&#39;m arranging for everyone who attends, so if anyone has any more song suggestions, tell me now. Here&#39;s the list so far: <a href="http://chelonianmobile.livejournal.com/76205.html"><a href="http://chelonianmobile.livejournal.com/76205.html">http://chelonianmobile.livejournal.com/76205.html</a></a><br><br>Meanwhile, a look at the darker depths of a certain PPC agent&#39;s mind: <a href="http://chelonianmobile.livejournal.com/76781.html"><a href="http://chelonianmobile.livejournal.com/76781.html">http://chelonianmobile.livejournal.com/76781.html</a></a></p>

            <p>I think the bar has to buy the rights to use each song or something first, I don&#39;t know.<br><br>&#39;Sides, I would probably get arrested for singing most of my favourite songs in public. They tend to involve murder, rape, suicide, or all three. Anyone who thinks Eminem or similar are bad influences on kids never looked up Nick Cave or Colin Meloy. Then again, no kids know who Nick Cave or Colin Meloy actually are, so I guess you can&#39;t call them a bad influence ... And Meloy&#39;s songs are freakin&#39; DIFFICULT to sing too.</p>

            <p>Sadly, I won&#39;t be able to make it. Possibly the next Gathering, but I won&#39;t be able to get to this one, not enough time to get everything arranged and such. Especially since I&#39;d still need to get all the papers and such in order for transcontinental travel (I don&#39;t even have a passport). <br><br>I thought I should say, since when this was brought up earlier I&#39;d said I&#39;d make the attempt to get there, but it turns out I cannot. I apologise for this. I did want to come, but can&#39;t this time. Also, about the CDs, would it be too much hassle (including transatlantic costs) to mail one to me after the gathering, or failing that to email me the mix (though in that case, I don&#39;t know how to burn it to a CD, and my computer currently has no sound, so I wouldn&#39;t be able to listen to it on the computer) so I can burn it? I can email the address in the case of the former, and provide my email in case of the latter. I was interested in the mix idea, so I thought I&#39;d ask about that, even though my plan of actually attending fell through. Sorry again.</p>

I just felt it was a good idea to email them and ask if it was likely to be crowded enough that we&#39;d have to pay, or if the actual bar opens at that time but the karaoke doesn&#39;t start till later, or something (because it would be just my luck to have something like that happen), but I think we should be safe.

            <p>I am looking for a good sue test.   Things to look for, things not to.   For example the following character,<br><br>Philip Martins (Longish swords-master, exiled)<br>Age 27<br>Hight 5&quot; 9<br>Weight: Never Given<br>Position of Swords-master:   In the Longish court the swords-master is normally the bodyguard of the heir to the throne.   Over the years the position has grown so that the swords-master, while remaining the most skillful swordsman in the empire (at least in theory) has also commanded armies for the king.   Philip Martins broke all records when he was appointed swords-master at the age of 22.<br><br>Back story to exile: Philip Martins was swords-master to the King of Longen for three years before he was exiled for a sexual relationship with the then 20 year old daughter of the Duke of Gibsgone.   The duke, a hardened catholic in his beliefs was horrified that his daughter was engaging in sex outside marriage and blamed the older swords-master for abusing his position of trust and used all of his political power to bring about the ruin of the swords-master<br><br>Philip Martins&#39; back story:   He was born in the capital of the Longish empire to a whore and a soldier.   Both his parents died or abandoned him before he was five and he was forced to live on the street.   The Longish empire has the practice of rounding up street boys every few years in order to train them to become the elite units of their army.   Philip was rounded up along with hundreds of others.   He displayed great speed and ability to learn in early training and when he was ten he was sent along with the cream of his round up to a training camp in the Villious Hills.   There he was trained in the sword, bow and knifes (both throwing and hand held).   His skill soon out stripped his fellow trainees and he was sent, now 13, to the aging swords-master for training.   He was appointed swords-master at the age of 21.<br><br>Dress:   As a swords-master he is dressed in light mail which falls to his knees, with light plate covering his shoulders and belly.   This is covered by a white tunic normally.<br><br>Further story.   Philip Martins completes a quest to find a sword of magical ability and is recalled to the Longish Court with all his position and rights restored.   He becomes a close friend of Queen Ashara (the princess he was body guard to during his first term as swords-master.)   In Queen Ashara&#39;s court he uses his influence to rehabilitate Commander Vivan Vicbarr, a commander whose skill is undeniable, but whose political ties see him in rebellion.   He also uses his position to help Commander Martindale (the commander that defeated Vicbarr&#39;s rebellion) to reform the Longish army.   Queen Ashara appoints him duke of Sigerman when that duke dies without heir in an effort to shore up the political dangerous area of the empire.   During the civil war that follows the death of Queen Ashara (between her daughter and son who were born twins) Philip declares for the daughter.   Both Philip Martins and Commander Martindale are killed at the Battle of Cave Hill where the daughter&#39;s army, of which he was one of the primary leaders is out flanked and destroyed by the son&#39;s army lead by Commander Vicbarr.</p>

            <p>Okay--post your least favorite webcomic(s)! I came across this sad thing through a friend of a friend on LJ.

            <p>I wonder if there is an LJ community dedicated to the bad webcomic. There was a Blogger site that bashed the more popular shitty webcomics, but they haven&#39;t updated in over a year.

            <p>... because a lot of them, e.g. Penny Arcade, give the impression that they would be very funny if I had the faintest idea what they were talking about. (I don&#39;t play any videogames beyond Diner Dash.)<br><br>I used to like the work of Ralph E Hayes. That got old fast. If I&#39;d agreed with even one of the political rants he put in the comic, maybe I&#39;d have kept reading them longer - I don&#39;t object to &quot;Ozy and Millie&quot;, which does a similar thing on the end of the political spectrum that I agree with. I kept reading &quot;Tales of the Questor&quot; till he started sticking unrelated pages featuring his latest blathering in there. Though I gotta admit, much as I despise him on a personal basis, the guy draws better comics than I do.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been told I have the attention span of a badly concussed ferret (which I understood to mean very short, from the way they said it,) but I&#39;ve always found the dice to be the part I can pay the most attention to, because mine are in pretty colors and they make amusing noises when I roll them.<br><br>I&#39;ll occasionally interrupt the plot to tell people that I just rolled my birthday on the dice or something similar.</p>

            <p>The dice shouldn&#39;t make up that much of the game, anyway. Most of it should be... well, role-playing. Funny, huh? The dice are just there to make sure people don&#39;t just do whatever crazy/stupid/impossible things they can think of, especially when it comes to fighting. Though the fights do tend to drag on sometimes what with everyone taking turns. Oh well. In any case, a good GM doesn&#39;t let the dice get in the way of the game.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who has a lot of experience with tabletop gaming.</p>

            <p>That was ALL dice-rolling. It was kinda like Snakes and Ladders but with goblins ... Bo-ring. I&#39;ve heard the &quot;real&quot; game is better, but I don&#39;t have the money to spare to buy the sourcebooks.</p>
