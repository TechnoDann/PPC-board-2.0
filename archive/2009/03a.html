            <p>Hello, all, NovaKrazny here. I was made aware of the PPC about two weeks ago thanks to TVTropes and I&#39;ve just been dawdling around since. Didn&#39;t feel confident enough to be posting, though (that and this chat format is honestly terrifying to a mind that&#39;s been drugged on Proboards and its ilk pretty much since getting on the &#39;Net).<br><br>Guess that changed now. I&#39;m fascinated enough by what&#39;s been started here that I&#39;ve decided to stick around; help with the Wiki, make some friends, maybe even write a story (though that possibility is, of course, a month off at the minimum). In the meantime, I promise to be polite, to use good spelling and grammar just as I was taught, and to not drop the good china.<br><br>Might look into that insanity thing the Constitution mentioned sometime, too. My best friend tells me it&#39;s one heck of a ride.</p>

            <p>I like most things. Cartoons are a favorite, along with some animes that I hold in dear nostalgia. Digimon, Pokemon, and Avatar are probably the three that I know the most about, with limited knowledge in other realms. I could write a damn book on the first three (well, first and third) seasons of Digimon.<br><br>I also like a considerable number of video games, though I&#39;m not experienced very well in any of their canons (somewhat in the Haloverse).<br><br>As for other stuff, I have most of the Redwall books practically memorized (don&#39;t ask me to quote page numbers, though, I can&#39;t memorize like that), along with some bits of the Star Wars EU (most specifically the X-Wing series). While I know some tenets about the Lord of the Rings, my knowledge is not nearly as extensive as some people I&#39;ve seen. I&#39;m also a big fan of the Young Wizards series, which gets FAR too little airtime and recognition. I am also a considerably intense World War Two buff.<br><br>But my real crown jewel is my knowledge of the NUMA canon. Dirk Pitt, Kurt Austin, the crew of the Oregon- I own every book Clive Cussler has ever written (and only two have gone missing), and I&#39;ve got parts of some of them memorized. I&#39;ve met few others who know of this guy- an outright Fanfiction.net search turns up five works total- but I really wish there were more. He&#39;s awesome.</p>

            <p>...it believe that the original purpose of the PPC was for comedy. There was no Grim Dark, there was only the snarky and generally lighthearted elimination of Mary Sues. <br><br>Because that&#39;s what this is all about. Lightheartedness. Having fun. Sometimes there is no need for Grim Dark or excessive drama.</p>

            <p>Though now I want to make an Agent with the motto, &quot;There is no such thing as goodfic, only degrees of bad&quot;. But still, killing babies is just too much. It&#39;s reprehensible enough that I think the Agent that did it could very well be kicked out, if not just hunted down. Besides, it&#39;d just be more interesting if you thought of another way, and Lycaenion&#39;s claimed this fic anyway. Also, the tone honestly depends on whose spinoff you&#39;re reading. You can be more cynical in tone without resorting to baby killing.</p>

            <p>Anyway, it&#39;s possible to say that the &quot;babies&quot; do not actually exist, but standard PPC policy for infants in badfic is to bring them to the Nursery to be raised as Agents. Dunno if it&#39;s ever been anything else, but that seems to be current policy.</p>

            <p>My first impression: Whoever came up with that soundtrack should be fired. Out of a cannon. &quot;Hallelujah&quot; for the Archie R-rated sequence? Seriously?<br><br>Secondly, the people who designed and built Archie deserve a huge raise. Archie was just like he was in the book, but better.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t that impressed by the ending. The line &quot;Nothing ends, Adrian. Nothing ever ends.&quot; from Jon is what finally breaks Adrian in the comics, and I was disappointed that it wasn&#39;t used for the same effect.<br><br>Also, what happened to Hollis? We didn&#39;t see him get killed, we don&#39;t see him in the resolution, he&#39;s just a dangling end.<br><br>Final nitpick: What&#39;s with Nite Owl&#39;s &quot;NOOOOOO!!!!1!!&quot;? He randomly follows Rorschach, sees him killed, and then yells &quot;NOOOOO!!!!&quot;... and then stops, gets up, and walks inside. Anticlimactic, muchly?<br><br>Okay, one more. No squid-beast-thing. :(<br><br>Overall grade: A. Most of my complaints are with the cinematography rather than the book-to-movie conversion, so that&#39;s a point in its favor. The shooting seemed clunky at times, but the fight choreography was smooth and beautiful. The whole <i>300</i>-esque messing-with-time bit in fights was done just right.</p>

            <p>With the soundtrack thing! I ADORED it! Bob Dylan yayness!

            <p>Parents think it sounds awful, so I don&#39;t want to admit that I wanna see it just for lulz. Must admit I was disappointed to find out it was about &quot;killers of lesbian vampires&quot; and not &quot;lesbians who kill vampires&quot;, because I think the latter would probably make for a better movie.

            <p>I&#39;m pretty excited to see the movie, but I do like knowing what will be different. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to keep my inner nitpicker under control. As long as this adaptation isn&#39;t like The Seeker then I think I&#39;ll be fine.</p>

            <p>Never seen the Seeker film (nor read the books), but the Agony Booth review is worth it:<br><br><a href="http://www.agonybooth.com/recaps/The_Seeker__The_Dark_is_Rising_2007.aspx"><a href="http://www.agonybooth.com/recaps/The_Seeker__The_Dark_is_Rising_2007.aspx">http://www.agonybooth.com/recaps/The_Seeker__The_Dark_is_Rising_2007.aspx</a></a><br><br>So yeah, I hope Watchmen is better. Shouldn&#39;t be too hard. But I, too, tend to nitpick a little (or a lot), and my first reaction to the film adaptation of a good book is always one of worry. True fans of Watchmen seem to have generally liked the film, though, so my hopes are up.</p>

            <p>I was a bit worried when the first professional reviews came out (they are quite mixed), but all in all it looks like it will be a good film. The user rating at the Internet Movie Database is 8.5/10 (based on 3451 votes) as I type this, which is more than satisfactory for such a difficult adaptation.<br><br>At the risk of being burned at the stake by a hundred rabid Alan Moore fans, I thought the Watchmen comic was only good, not OMG TEH BEST COMIC EVAR!!!!!1<br><br>But, with my faith renewed, I&#39;ll certainly go see the film.</p>

            <p>School has finally caught up with me, which explains my two-week absence from the Board(s). It&#39;s probably going to continue like that, so I apologize to anyone who was expecting my presence or participation for various things.<br><br>The good news is that I have my weekly schedule for my London spring course. I&#39;m really interested in meeting as many of you fine PPCers as possible. Right now it looks like the best time for a Gathering would be the weekend of May 9 and 10, since I have both days completely free, but I have other free times, too, if that doesn&#39;t work for enough people. Please let me know if you&#39;re interested. I&#39;ll keep an eye on this thread. If you need/want it, my e-mail is exswyzie14 (AT) yahoo (DOT) com.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... because there&#39;s a family party on the Saturday evening. If everyone shows up on the Saturday and nobody else can make Sunday, I&#39;ll come on the Saturday and leave a bit early so I can get home in time, but it looks like I won&#39;t be able to do both days.</p>

            <p>I was thinking finances would rule me out completely, but it seems there&#39;s a megatrain option from Hull (and about time too - the megabuses don&#39;t run from here and it is very annoying). Round trip would cost between two and six quid. But the earliest I could arrive is 11.19am, and the last train back is about half past two, and ten hours travelling for three hours there doesn&#39;t seem worth it.<br><br>Mind you, this is still all very tentative on my part, because not only is it the start of the birthday week, I&#39;ve also got two people coming up for that week with dates as yet unfinalised, and there&#39;s also a possibility I may be cramming for my Old Norse exam.</p>

            <p>Well, technically I have Myths, Legends and Language of the Vikings. Half the grade&#39;s an essay, and half&#39;s an exam, of which 25% is grammar, 50% is translation of something from the sagas into modern English, and 25% is commentary on what&#39;s been translated. I&#39;m quite looking forward to it - getting that much knowledge in my brain will be tough, but there are actual right and wrong answers, unlike for the rest of my degree, so this exam makes the difference between a first and failing the module.<br><br>Ah, Old English.

            <p>... we can only do the Saturday anyway, but it&#39;s a good idea  to give the option for both days. We&#39;ve had a couple of Gatherings where people could only do one or the other, so it came out as two Gatherings with a few common people between them. So you might have Kaitlyn and me on the Saturday, but Laburnum on the Sunday. Other people could go to both, or just one, or whatever.<br><br>As to organising it, that basically comes down to picking a meeting place and time, and giving an estimate of when it would end. If there&#39;s something several people want to do, it&#39;d be an idea to meet there, but at the least the meeting place needs to be near a train station, preferably at a major landmark. London has lots of train access, of course, so it&#39;s pretty dependent on where people want to be.<br><br>Um, so yeah. Date, time, place. And then put together a list of who&#39;s said they&#39;ll go, so you know who&#39;s not made it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...to help me with three things.<br>THING THE FIRST. One&#39;s mother, having been told of the PPC and its activities, believes firstly that the lot of you are child molesters and secondly that writing MSTs and other sporkings is bad for the soul. How to rectify this situation?<br>THING THE SECOND. How does one deal with a badfic in which the POV changes every few paragraphs, the tenses shift every sentence, and as for the first-, second-, and third-person views... ah, frag it all. Can someone lend me a DOGA mod CAD?<br>THING THE THIRD. While flipping through a gardening catalog, I came upon this. <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v189/anneheathen/media/DarkLordGeranium.jpg" alt="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v189/anneheathen/media/DarkLordGeranium.jpg"><br>It is called the Dark Lord Geranium. Am I right in assuming that it should be made an honorary Flower That Is? With spiky black armor? Spiky....<br></p>

            <p>Thing The Third: I find myself wondering if there are any departments or divisions which do not yet have a stated head.

            <p>THING THE FIRST! Join the club, honey, join the club. However, having paranoid parents is a good thing. Just put up with her griping, and explain to her that you&#39;re not giving away personal information or doing anything that&#39;ll encourage the child molesters to hunt you down. As for sporking being bad for the soul? Nah. It&#39;s actually just creative critiquing. <br><br>THING THE SECOND! I don&#39;t have one, but I&#39;m sure someone does.

            <p>Sorry, I had to do that.<br><br>On THING THE FIRST:<br><br>Having parents like yours (and now I have moved halfway around the world), distance is a great thing.  Not using your home computer to do PPC related things helps alot.<br><br>If your parents make side comments about us, just ignor them.  Besure to answer all comments about other topics, eventually they will drop it.  Parents are like children that way.<br><br>If your parents fear for your soul (especially churchy parents), ask them <code>is ignorance bliss?</code>  My brothers and I are having a long and very fustrating time reeducating our parents about the church.  I am not anti-religion, I am just anti ignorance. <br><br>I could not belive it when my mother made the comment one time sayting that something is wrong just because the bible said so.  To back this statement up:  1.  The Jewish people only eat cosher, the reason:  When these rules were laid out, many people were dieing of badly buchered and preserved food, especially meat.  When the people found a way to do the things correctly (ie, not get sick) it found itself in the religius writing and teachings as a message from <code>God</code>.  2. Roman Catholocisim; no meat on Fridays, reason:  In the (guessing at date, not reason) 1400s, the fish merchants went to the Pope to enlist his help in selling more fish.  In return they would give a very generous <code>donation</code> to the church.  So the Pope declaired that to honor Christ<code>s sacrifice, the people should not eat meat on Friday and eat fish instead (my family did this until the late 1990s).  3.  The Bible was put together to help people to understand the world around them.  When ever it says</code>God<code>s will</code>, was it really a will of some super natural power, or was just some science that they did not understand?  The Bible was written well before the advent of modern science and people wanted answers.<br><br>The Bible is not always correct.<br><br>/rant<br><br>But my first sujestion should work, did on mine.<br><br>On THING THE SECOND:<br><br>Your agents may need neck braces for whiplash.<br><br>On THING THE THIRD:<br><br>Cool!  Definatly already a Flower that Be, or maybe it is a Flower that is responsible for agents to go rogue? Hmmmmm...  I can see the flowers starting their own councils and fellowship to depose of the Dark Lord Geranium.  Crap, I now have a plot bunny clining to my leg, anyone want him?<br><br>Leto</p>

            <p>On the FIRST: I don&#39;t think it is possible to explain the PPC to someone that thinks that fictionally killing fictional thirteen-year-olds (between the ages of 13-35, and a few that were older due to immortality) equates to real life child molestation. Is your mother the kind of person that believes that authors can only write about what they know? i.e. that if someone is killed in a novel that the author must have experience killing people? (rather than an overactive imagination?)<br><br>I do agree on the second matter, in a way. If I had a soul, I&#39;m pretty sure that reading badfic would be bad for it. It is bad for the brain after all. MSTing is actually rather cleansing.<br><br>On the SECOND: I once thought about following a fic from an anti-gravity room due to its massive tense switching (within sentences even). I guess you should stock up on crash dummies, and have the agents follow the fic from the confindes of their TARDIS.<br><br>On the THIRD: great name for a flower. Now I wants one for my garden.</p>

            <p>...as far as the &quot;child molester&quot;/scary people thing goes.<br><br>There was a survey taken on the Board--most of the members at the time participated--and here are the results. (The survey was public, on the Board itself, so none of these responses would have been faked.) What are the chances that ALL of these people are lying?<br><br><a href="http://formerlydf.livejournal.com/29181.html#cutid1"><a href="http://formerlydf.livejournal.com/29181.html#cutid1">http://formerlydf.livejournal.com/29181.html#cutid1</a></a><br><br>Here is the short version, the summary of what it says about us:<br><br>__<strong><em><br><b>Survey Summary</b> <br><br>From the 44 surveys filled out, it is immediately apparent that the majority of the members on the PPC Posting Board are female and around 16-20 years old. It’s also obvious that they absolutely love the Board. When asked to describe the Board in three words, they say things like “marvelous”, “awesome”, “home”, “insane, entertaining, addicting” and “hellloadofFUN!”. They place a lot of importance on being nice to other members of the Board– for customs, one of the most commonly repeated answers is “be nice to others”. There’s also an insistence on giving virtual presents to new members and generally making them feel welcome. The Board is a fun and funny place, where everyone is practically guaranteed to share common interests with at least one other person. In fact, according to the people who took the survey, the people of the board are the absolute best thing- not the stories or amusing things posted, but being able to chat with people who are apparently entertaining, supportive, and intelligent. Another thing very obvious is the enthusiasm of the Board members– in my request for people to fill out surveys, I stated that I only needed 25.

            <p>A good way to explain the PPC is that we are an all ages group dedicated to finding humor through the critique of online fiction, which is done in the form of MSTs and sporking. We analyse the structuring, plot, grammar, and general accuracy of fanfiction in a creative way, comparing it against the original works in a way that can be explored with merit. Most of the PPC&#39;s active members are in their teens and early twenties- in fact, a great deal are under twenty, and many are under the age of eighteen, from what I can remember of the ages of active members. <br><br>Beyond that, here are some positive facts:<br><br><br>It&#39;s a nice hobby that improves your reading and writing skills. Reading is awesome. It&#39;s something most of us like. Reading is good. We support that massively.<br><br>For many members who participate in doing PPCs, sporkings, and MSTs, their skills in editing, writing, and the use of spelling and grammar increase. At least one PPCer I can think of has turned what they&#39;ve found here into something to do as a career; there are also at least two more I can think of who are in the process of going through schooling who are also going into jobs, or considering jobs, that can be helped with a skillset that might have been buffed and polished through being members here.<br><br>And something something something fish.</p>

One&#39;s mother, having been told of the PPC and its activities, believes firstly that the lot of you are child molesters and secondly that writing MSTs and other sporkings is bad for the soul. How to rectify this situation?&quot;<br><br>...interesting question. It can&#39;t be dealt with easily: I feel that making her read C***b***n to show her the evils of badfic is NOT the way to go.<br>Personally I just don&#39;t face this problem, because my parents don&#39;t know (and don&#39;t care) about what I do online. Isn&#39;t there a way to spork badfics quietly, without trying to hide it but without talking about it either? It&#39;s not like it&#39;s a shameful or immoral thing to do.<br><br><br>&quot;THING THE THIRD. While flipping through a gardening catalog, I came upon this. It is called the Dark Lord Geranium. Am I right in assuming that it should be made an honorary Flower That Is? With spiky black armor?

            <p>The Dark Lord Geranium&#39;s probably already a Flower, just a matter of finding a suitable Department, heh. And yes, the battle armour is a must.<br><br>As for your first question, I can&#39;t really think of anything to suggest other than trying to convince her that it&#39;s really quite harmless. But she doesn&#39;t seem like she&#39;ll listen to reason. The second is also tricky, but some motion sickness pills would help.

            <p>Clearly my realistic mindset is not compatible with most of the PPC, heh. I can&#39;t have something done <i>not</i> be done for an expedient, sensible, logical reason. Hence me arguing that making a Division solely to give ol&#39; DLG a job wouldn&#39;t have a point and wouldn&#39;t be a thing the Flowers would do. Especially since, to be honest, there aren&#39;t exactly a lot of villain!Sues (not saying evil!Sues because, by our definitions, <i>all</i> Sues are evil). Maybe Flowers practice nepotism? DLG shows up, he&#39;s an old friend of one of the higher-up Flowers, said Flowers sets it up so DLG gets a job as head of a new division? I could make the Division and agents fairly easily, though unlike some divisions/departments it&#39;d be open to any and all.</p>

            <p>As for the others, I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;d imagine it&#39;d be pretty much like any other department/division, except the specific type of Sue targetted.
