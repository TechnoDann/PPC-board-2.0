            <p>What are your favorite webcomics?<br><br>I know a lot of webcomics, but not all have really caught my interest for a long time. Generally I like those with adventure (as opposed to slice-of-life), strong continuity (as opposed to joke-of-the-day) and a good balance between comedy and drama.<br><br>For the moment my three favorite webcomics are, in no particular order:<br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots.html">Order of the Stick</a>. Probably the most famous and possibly the best Dungeons and Dragons comic out there. At first there&#39;s not much of a plot, and a newcomer may be put off by the very simple art (stick figures), but be patient and open-minded, there&#39;s a reason why it won five Web Cartoonists&#39; Choice Awards over the years. Some familiarity with D&amp;D (or role-playing games in general) is required to understand many of the jokes.<br><br><a href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php">Girl Genius</a>. A steampunk webcomic featuring &quot;adventure, romance and mad science&quot;. Made by a professional cartoonist, and it shows.<br><br><a href="http://www.errantstory.com/">Errant Story</a> . My most recent find (I just completed my <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchiveBinge">archive binge</a>), and much less famous than the two above. Influenced by manga and anime. Looks like generic fantasy (magic, Elves, gods, etc), but tries to deconstruct, subvert or lampshade many of the tropes associated with the genre.<br><br><br><br>All of those webcomics feature a complex setting, a convoluted plot and interesting, morally ambiguous characters.</p>

            <p>If you like convoluted plots, might I suggest <a href="http://www.narbonic.com/">Narbonic</a>? Sure, its characters aren&#39;t so much morally ambiguous as explicitly and openly evil, but it&#39;s &quot;pink-heart evil&quot; rather than Xykon-evil. It has a number of similarities to Girl Genius. Currently rerunning with cartoonist&#39;s commentary.<br><br>You might enjoy <a href="http://keychain.patternspider.net/">Keychain of Creation</a>, which I understand to have been directly inspired by Order of the Stick. It&#39;s based on Exalted rather than D&amp;D, but I know next to nothing about Exalted beyond what&#39;s explained in the daily notes and I still enjoy it. (&#39;Course, when I started following OOTS I knew next to nothing of D&amp;D, so.)<br><br>... If you don&#39;t mind archive binging a whole lot, you might be interested in <a href="http://irregularwebcomic.net">Irregular Webcomic</a>. It&#39;s mostly a LEGO photocomic, and it has about sixteen different (mostly interlocking) storylines, but all but two or three of those have very strong continuity. Be warned, however: it&#39;s been updating daily with no misses since early 2003, and it&#39;s currently up to number 2297.<br><br>I want to suggest <a href="http://www.adventurers-comic.com">Adventurers!</a>, but a very large part of it, even once it gets a plot, is joke-a-day. This is occasionally justified as sidequests, but not always. You might be more attracted to <a href="http://antiheroforhire.com">Antihero For Hire</a>, by the same guy.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve started to read more plot based ones recently, don&#39;t know why.  I still love Something Positive and the Devil&#39;s Panties and such as well.  :D  My favourite ones are normally the ones I&#39;ve come across recently though.  XD<br><br><a href="http://dreamless.keenspot.com/">Dreamless</a>  - actually, I&#39;m half reading this one because of her name.  It&#39;s so creepy when that happens.  <br><br><a href="http://requiem.seraph-inn.com/">Phoenix Requiem</a>  - drawn by the same girl as Dreamless.  The story and art is amazing.<br><br><a href="http://devilspanties.keenspot.com/index.html">The Devil&#39;s Panties</a> - and then a joke a day one.  ^___^  Although it&#39;s been going seven days a week for far too long, so archive binges are only recommended if you have a week to spare.</p>

            <p>Anyhoo, I recently emailed Miss Cam for permission to write an OFU of my own (a friend of mine and I will be co-writing it.) It&#39;s been about a week and a half so far, and I haven&#39;t received a reply. Should I email again just in case, or would that seem pushy of me?<br><br>Also, I&#39;m beginning to contemplate an HP fanfiction, and I wanted to give my heroine (Hogwarts student, not transferred from America thank you very much) a pet Kneazle/cat. I was just wondering if it would be considered a CAF it has one eye, numerous claw scars, and all the amiability of a junkyard dog.<br><br>This final question has been niggling at me since I started reading about the Reorganisation (I&#39;m on Chapter 3 of the Crashing Down): How the heck do you pronounce Twp&#39;atwt?</p>

            <p>Answer the first: Miss Cam doesn&#39;t do permission for OFUs any more. I found that out about a year ago when I first spoke to her. You&#39;re more than welcome to write one, but you MUST credit her for the general idea of OFUs. I co-write one myself with Oozaru Angel, and in the disclaimer for every chapter we make sure to credit Miss Cam for the idea of OFUs and minis.<br><br>Answer the second: You&#39;re not familiar with Discworld by any chance? That description sounds a lot like Nanny Ogg&#39;s Greebo to me. Not that it would cause a problem, I&#39;m sure; as Sedri said, just treat it as you would a humanoid character and don&#39;t go overboard.<br><br>Answer the third: I wondered about it for a while, but the last time this was brought up I believe someone pronounced it Toop-a-toot.</p>

            <p>on what exactly the other fandom was (other than the Pizza Cats, which I am familiar enough with to give a decent on-the-spot rendition of the Fan Club Oath if pressed), but now I think I know. Warriors is that book series about cats fighting basically a cat-scale war, right? By... *goes upstairs and digs book out of little brother&#39;s shelf* Erin Hunter?<br><br>I read the first one of those a while back out of sheer curiosity, but never really progressed onwards into the series (hence my extremely simplified summary of it). Even so, based off my experiences with that one book, this is a HELL of a crossover. I could write an essay on why this makes no sense.</p>

            <p>At the most basic level, yes, Warriors is about the cats fighting an ongoing cat-scale war by Erin Hunter.  I could write an essay on why that crossover makes no sense and needs to be killed ASAP.  As in now if not sooner.  Why do people write stuff like this?  WHY???????!!!!!!!</p>

            <p>Okay, a while ago, I posted the following five paragraphs asking for help. Then what happened? My access to the site was cut off. I only got a chance to read one reply, let alone respond to that. Fortunately, my access is back again and I had saved the question in a Word file. So here we go... again...<br><br>Does Pokйmon have any logic in whatsoever? Because I’ve got a fic in progress but, as I’m trying to go for a thought-out story, I’m thinking about all the wacky things that tend to happen in it. Let’s ignore the whole romantic tension between ten-year-old and the fact that said ten-year-olds can defeat a crime syndicate time and time again and that no-one ever ages (does anyone age in any cartoon/anime? (Pokйmon’s anime, right?)).<br><br>Pokйballs: is there a logical explanation for the fact that metal, which seems to have a lot of electronics inside, can expand from the size of my big toe to the size of my palm? Is there an explanation for the fact that Pokйmon, random creatures with at least 493 species, can all be shot at with a… laser(?) and turned into a laser and sucked into a Pokйball (which then is compressed back to toe-size)? Is there a logical explanation for how they come out (in a weird flash of white light)? Hell, is there an explanation for how they can sometimes come out on their own? They can’t be in stasis of any sort, because they generally seem to know what’s going on (also, they’d be angry if all they ever saw was battle after battle). Also, they seem to heal between battles even if they haven’t been sprayed with Salvon or whatever’s in that bottle they sometimes use. And if they’re not in stasis, then can they starve to death if they’re not let out for a long time?<br><br>Pokйmon Evolution: How the hell do they evolve so constantly? And why do they glow when it happens? They only seem to need to beat up a few other Pokйmon to evolve (or have a catalyst in the form of a magic rock, of which an explanation would also be useful). At least Digimon had an explanation: they were all pieces of data, so they could happily switch back and forth between all sorts of evolutionary stages. Also, the Digidestineds’ Digivices (Digithis, Digithat) seemed to act as a trigger. But Pokйmon has no explanation. And what’s up with Eevee? It can evolve into one of five things???<br><br>Pokйmon Attacks: Some can be explained. Psychic attacks simply require brainpower, fire attacks obviously come from a fuel source within the Pokйmon et cetera. But were does the water in Water Gun come from? How do they form explosive(?) bubbles with Bubble Beam? Where do all these razor-sharp (and as strong as steel) leaves and infinitely long vines come from with Grass-types and their Razor Leaf and Vine Whip attacks? <br><br>This wasn’t meant to be as long as it was, but I spotted more and more weird things as I went. Any help would be very appreciated. Also, if you can explain any more weird things that I’ve missed, that would be just as good. Even if you can’t explain them, point out the weird stuff so I know what to deweirdify.</p>

Any form of help is appreciated, especially from someone with as much biology knowledge as you.<br><br>“Animals and plants are grouped based on different charactersitics, and the idea of grouping them is to make sure that each group contains only organisms that are more closely related to each other than they are to everything outside the group. And modes of life are very important criteria for dividing up organisms - outward appearance is actually one of the least important criteria - it is so easily changed by selection pressure. So given that all Pokemon have this same basic mode of reproduction/metamorphosis, which can be catalysed by rocks, of all things (and I&#39;ll get onto THAT later as well), I&#39;m going to group them in their own class, part of the phylum Arthropoda and a sister-taxon to the classes Insecta, Chelicerata etc etc. This group is cladistically correct because it is monophyletic (nothing that belongs in the group has been left out - no other animals reproduce like Pokemon do)”<br><br>… wow. Just wow. You may be “talking out [your] arse” as you say, but that makes perfect sense in a ‘had to look at the dictionary sixty-eight times’ kind of way. :P I’m not sure, but that could very well work. Unfortunately, that’s a bit too much information for my needs and I have nowhere to put it all. Sorry. Professor Birch plays a mild to moderate part of my fic (especially at the beginning), so if I get the chance, can I use him as a mouthpiece for you as he babbles on about a new discover. The only problems are Eevee and Ditto. How do you explain a Pokйmon that can evolve into seven completely different species (and don’t say ‘unstable genetic code’ unless that’s actually plausible :P) and a Pokйmon that can take the form of anything?<br><br>Re: Professor Birch. For some reason, I’ve started seeing him as a Scottish bloke when I’m writing him. Can anyone help me understand why?<br><br>“As for the rock catalyst thing, it is possible (not probable, and not likely, but possible) that these magical rocks contain essential elements or compounds that catalyse the chemical processes that cause them to metamorphose, or that stress them into changing, somewhat like bad water conditions force axolotls (which are normally neotenous and happy about it) to undergo the last stage of development and become newts.<br>This is a poor and depauperate explanation but I&#39;m sort of scraping the bottom of the barrel here.”<br><br>No matter as I never use rocks in the game unless I have to (find them fairly pointless really), so I don’t think my characters will use them unless as a last resort for some reason (e.g. the Apocalypse that I have planned). :P</p>

            <p>&quot;The only problems are Eevee and Ditto. How do you explain a Pokйmon that can evolve into seven completely different species (and don’t say ‘unstable genetic code’ unless that’s actually plausible :P) and a Pokйmon that can take the form of anything?&quot;<br><br>For a start &#39;unstable genetic code&#39; doesn&#39;t exist. Not in that way, at least. So we&#39;ll just not think about that. <br><br>However, saying it evolves into seven different species doesn&#39;t work, either, because you cannot change species. No individual has ever changed species, just like no individual has ever evolved. Evolution is a process that happens between generations. So, here&#39;s my thoughts on Eevee - I can&#39;t remember if the things it evolves into are Pokemon that can also evolve from other baby Pokemon or not, but if that is so, then I would say that the Eevee version are mimics rather than the same &#39;species&#39; as the same adult-appearance evolved from a different juvenile. If the things that Eevee evolves into are ONLY known as end products of Eevee evolution, well, then what you have is extreme ecophenotypic variation. I&#39;m assuming that different catalysts or events or triggers or environments are required to get it to change into any specific adult? It&#39;s not random? Then it&#39;s merely variation, not a different species. This point would be strengthened were it to turn out that each Eevee-adult of different appearance could still breed with Eevee-adults of dissimilar appearance.<br><br>As to Ditto, well, mimicry again. Of course I&#39;d like to investigate the mechanism by which it does it, but plenty of animals are capable of imitating other animals, plants, rocks etc, and there are enough chameleon-like animals that can change colour, and from memory it&#39;s a sort of jelly-ball thing when it&#39;s not being something else? Perhaps it&#39;s got an amorphous body and a really really good colour-change system, and enough sense-organs to produce a good enough picture in its brain of what it needs to look like to enable it to change form to imitate other Pokemon.<br><br>Again, still talking mostly out my arse here, esp. on Ditto (Eevee I&#39;m happier about because hey, evolutionary biology is kinda my thing) but whatever, hopefully it&#39;s useful technobabble for you :D</p>

            <p>“I, personally, gave up on logic in Pokemon a long time ago. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s meant to make sense, but just to entertain. It&#39;s a fantasy world with different rules etc.”<br><br>But what would the rules be? After all, we wouldn’t want Christopher Paolini getting away with all the weird stuff in <i>Eragon</i> by saying “this world has different rules,” would we? :P Most fandoms have different rules to our universe (magic, starships et cetera) but whether or not those rules are explained is a different matter.<br><br>“Evolution could just be a case of &#39;I&#39;m too powerful/experienced for this form now, I need to be at the next one to continue getting stronger.&#39; There are exceptions, of course (i.e. Ash/Satoshi&#39;s Pikachu and its ability to defeat almost anything), but most things evolve once they&#39;re strong enough.”<br><br>Yeah, about Pikachu, why <i>doesn’t</i> it ever evolve and can still beat up everyone? I mean, surely some other Pokйmon should have objections to evolving as well.<br><br>“I believe it was mentioned somewhere, perhaps in the Pokedex of one of the games, that Eevee has an unstable genetic code and therefore can evolve into whatever Pokemon is attuned to the stone you use on it (about seven or so now I think).”<br><br>An ‘unstable genetic code’? The only thing I can think of is that it means is that it’s missing pieces… which sounds ridiculous.<br><br>“People do age in anime, most of the time, but Pokemon is just weird with its non-aging. The Digimon Adventures 01 characters were older by the time of 02, to use your other mon-anime example.”<br><br>Yeah, but that was due to it being set later on (and with new characters). Pokйmon’s being going on for years now with the same core characters (mostly).<br><br>“Good luck with figuring out Pokemon logic and science.”<br><br>Thanks. I’ll probably need it.</p>

            <p>“There is no logical explanation behind Pokeballs, other than the diffusion of matter. In my stories, the Pokeball contains technology capable of transferring physical matter into a pure energy form, thus allowing the Pokemon to be stored within the Pokeball. As all amtter is simply different forms of energy, the conversion is easy enough to say in theory, but hard ot put into practice.”<br><br>That actually makes perfect sense. My story’s based on a combination of <i>Ruby</i> and <i>Sapphire</i> and in all of the games, someone says something like “Technology is incredible! You can now store and recall items and Pokйmon as data via PC!” (from <i>Red</i>). Therefore, that is very easily transferred to your theory. I suppose I better ask anyway: mind if I nick your idea?<br><br>“Additionally, Pokeballs can expand or reduce in size due to the technology of the Pokeball moving around, thus allowing it to enter a more compact mode.”<br><br>And that one.<br><br>“It&#39;s unsure what the inside of a Pokeball is like, seeing as the being inside is theoretically pure energy, but it is often guessed, and supported by Nintendo, that the inside of the Pokeball varies to give the mind of the Pokemon, or the physical body if the energy process turns it to energy, then to matter again inside the Pokeball, a more sane level of existance. A water type may need water, thus the Pokeball compensates thruogh inbuilt technology. In this thread, of the inside of a Pokeball is chosen to suit the Pokemon, it also follows that the environment is suitable for the Pokemon to rest and heal.”<br><br>If it’s supported by Nintendo, why does it need to be guessed?<br><br>“Given the choice, I suppose a Pokemon may even be able to listen to events occuring outside its Pokeball, giving the possibility that the Pokeball has psychic capabilities and responds to the thoughts of a Pokemon.”<br><br>The Pokйball has psychic abilities? I just figured that it let sound through or something.<br><br>”Within the anime and games, Pokemon do need additional medicine for particularly extreme wounds or conditions (Poisoned, as an example), but other than that, Pokemon have probably developed accelerated healing abilities as a result of their frequent practice of battling.”<br><br>What about the wild ones though? They don’t battle nearly as much and they obviously have enhanced healing abilities.<br><br>“Pokemon have aso been shown to be fed regularly outside of the Pokeball, showing that the Pokeball doesn&#39;t seem to provide nutrition. As a result, they can starve to death unless they are Ghost Types.”<br><br>I suppose that answers the question of whether ghost types need to eat. But what about others? Regirock, Regice and Registeel have no mouths and it even comments in <i>Ruby’s</i> Pokйdex that no-one has any idea what Registeel eats.<br><br>“Pokemon do not evolve constantly, as each tends to have one, or at most, two forms to evolve into. Humans are constantly evolving in their childhood to their teenage, and then adult forms, it&#39;s just more gradual. In the case of Pokemon, these changes are more sudden.”<br><br>Yes, but some Pokйmon change so bizarrely that they can’t be said to merely be growing up (plus, that would imply that Pikachu is a perpetual child). Also, what about some Pokйmon that evolve into multiple things (ignoring Eevee). For example, Wurmple can evolve into Silcoon or Cascoon depending on its stats.<br><br>“It&#39;s the training that allows a Pokemon to evolve, similar to how exercise and nutrition allows the human body to grow towards adulthood.”<br><br>What about wild Pokйmon? I can’t picture a Jigglypuff fighting so that it can evolve (and definitely not Magikarp).<br><br>“It&#39;s quite similar to the human developement, just occurs at set stages that can spontaneously happen, whether upon an emotion trigger or the need to evolve to deal with their current situation (See when Ash&#39;s Charmeleon evolved to Charizard to save Ash from the Aerodactyl).”<br><br>*remembers* Damn, you’re saying that my idea isn’t original. *curses* I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. It’s not all that original to have a Combusken evolve into Blaziken in order to save her trainer from being killed by a Team Aqua member. Well… <i>that</i> might be original, but the general idea probably isn’t.<br><br>“The elemental stones are shown to contain concentrated doses of whatever element they represent, which leads to the suggestion of radioactivity, a natural element not found on earth or even divine blessing.”<br><br>… I think I’ll go for radioactivity out of those choices (though obviously a form that has no effect on humans).<br><br>“Eevee is capable of evolving because it is very adaptable. It has been specifically noted that Eevee&#39;s DNA is unstable, allowing it to potentially absorb part of the environment around it and evolve to best suit it. This would explain why Eevee evolves around the Ice Rock in Diamond and Pearl, or to Vaporean when exposed to a Water Stone.”<br><br>As I said to Ansela, an ‘unstable genetic code’? The only thing I can think of is that it means is that it’s missing pieces… which sounds ridiculous.<br><br>“Pokemon attacks can be a bit tricky, but again, I also dealt with this in my own Pokemon fanfic.”<br><br>*is relieved* I just had a worrying thought that you guys might think I’m weird for writing a Pokйmon fic.<br><br>“The water used by certain water Pokemon (Squirtle, Totodile, Mudkip, etc) is developed in an internal water pouch which frequently fills with either excess saliva, stomach acid (Explaining why several Water Types are also poison types), or is capable of combining oxygen in the air with hydrogen produced naturally by the body.”<br><br>There are Water/Poison types? I’ve never seen any. I can only really picture Squirtle and co and any big Water types having space for a water pouch given how much they seem to use sometimes. I think I’ll use a combination of that idea and the air one (e.g. Mudkip would breathe in (Water types seem to do that a lot) and blow out and do something magical that combines both the oxygen and hydrogen together without a water pouch).<br><br>”Leaves and vines are harder to explain. However, there are cases where plants can be quite effective against regular metal. Theoretically, by binding together thousands of paper thin layers of membrane, you can create a substance equal in power to steal. This would be seal in a laquer naturally product by grass Pokemon.”<br><br>Hmm… can I nick this too?<br><br>“The vines may simply be the result of seeds carried by the Pokemon being forced to grow rapidly, or even the Grass Pokemon itself forcing its body to grow by concentrating sunlight, nutrients and water in its body to force the growth or attack (Solarbeam requires sunlight to fire, etc).”<br><br>What about when they retract the vines though?<br><br>“And that&#39;s all stuff I&#39;ve dealt with in my story. It&#39;s actually quite fun, applying logic, you just gotta ask &#39;How can this work&#39;, and then create the theories. I dealt with the paradox of &#39;Pokemon fire = Not Death&#39; vs &#39;Building on Fire = Death&#39; by saying that fire types excrete a natural chemical in their fire sacs which limits the heat their flames can reach.”<br><br>I presume you’re talking about how Pokйmon fire won’t kill <i>humans</i>. I’ve gone against the anime with this in that Pokйmon fire can and will kill (especially if you get it in the face). After all the Pokйdex entry for Torchic in <i>Ruby</i> says “This Pokйmon breathes fire of over one thousand and eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit, including fireballs that leave the foe scorched black.” For Pokйmon, I’ve decided that, like prey always do, each species has developed defences against the things that could kill it. Therefore, Wurmple has spikes on its tail to drive off Swellow, all Pokйmon can survive brief blasts from fire types if their skin is toughened against flame etc. Fire types themselves have totally different views on fire. Taken from the draft of one story of mine from a Blaziken’s POV. “Taking a deep breath, she blew out, expelling some of her inner fire with the air. Flames spewed from her mouth, but they felt cold to Miska. As a Blaziken, she was adapted to survive the fire she used. When it was cold to her, it was still very hot but pathetically weak compared to her true power.” My current theory (though I’m open to suggestions) is that fire types are like a flamethrower. They need a flame of X size inside them to get it going and then use fuel to expand that into a deadly weapon. The fuel in my theory is stolen from the dragons in <i>Reign of Fire</i>.</p>

            <p>They are not like buses, for a start. Every twenty seconds at the start of labour? Er, no. So far as I know you&#39;re not meant to head to the hospital until the contractions are close enough together, which suggests they&#39;re initially far apart.<br><br>From experience: when I was having a three hour natter on the phone to my sister to distract her last time she was giving birth, she wasn&#39;t that far advanced then, but it was probably every ten or fifteen minutes or so (I&#39;d have to check). She&#39;ll be calling me tomorrow to wish me happy birthday, so I&#39;ll try to remember to ask her then. In the meantime, google might help, but you&#39;re likely to get conflicting information - try your google-fu on &quot;how far apart should my contractions be before I head to hospital?&quot; and use that as a baseline.</p>

            <p>Generally you&#39;ll have what they call a &quot;show&quot; quite a few hours before it all gets going - this is the plug of mucous from your cervix coming out. When that goes, you know the baby&#39;s going to follow sooner or later.</p>

            <p>What happens is that the baby is floating inside a sac of what&#39;s called amniotic fluid, which rather resembles water in looks, inside the womb. When the sac breaks, which it will do at some point during labour, the fluid escapes. That&#39;s the waters breaking. The show, as has already been explained, is something totally different.</p>

            <p>I was my mother&#39;s last (even if she does occasionally insist I&#39;m the eldest) so no knowledge from there. But my sister dropped her first three years ago, and her second&#39;s due in about three weeks. And this second&#39;s not being so easy, so I&#39;m learning plenty from it. For example: you also can&#39;t have a home birth if your iron levels are ridiculously low.

            <p>For some women (rare cases - first timers) the time between breaking water and finish can be as long as  three to four days, sometimes longer.  But that is extream.  For first time labour, the time is rarely less than six hours.<br><br>The second child, labour can be as short as one hour.<br><br>Extream short time (I am not sure if this was the woman<code>s fourth or fifth child), she brock water while shopping, drove to the hospital and the child was already halfway birthed by the time she got to the emergency ward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are absolutly no averages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing to factor in is body shape.  There was a reason why men wanted their women to have wide hips (child bearing hips).  It was so that the woman in question would have an easier time having children and the less possibility of her death.  Now with C-sections, that is largely taken out.  Women with narrow hips can have a 10 to 13 pound baby, which in earlier times would have almost guranteed her death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are things you have to think about with your character.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this helps.

            <p>I doubt the baby would have to stay in hospital for long at all. I&#39;ve been annoying my mother, who was a midwife for long enough, and she says babies born at seven or eight months are no different than full-term ones; there wouldn&#39;t necessarily be any need to keep them in hospital, unless the doctors are either paranoid or greedy for money.</p>

            <p>There must be <i>some</i> difference, or else why would the usual gestation period be nine months instead of seven?<br><br>So far as I&#39;m aware premature babies often have trouble with their lungs not being adequately developed. If it&#39;s known the baby will be coming out early, they can give the mother something (steroids I suspect) to stimulate lung development, but if it&#39;s a surprise appearance at just seven months, there could be trouble in that department.<br><br>Like Cassie says, money&#39;s not an issue in British fandoms. It&#39;s the baby&#39;s health that&#39;s important. And they don&#39;t like sending &#39;em home when they&#39;re really tiny (although if it was only a week or so premature that wouldn&#39;t be a worry either).</p>

            <p>I was under the impression the reason they&#39;re so often early or late is because of the dating of conception. Dating goes by the date of your last period. Though they can revise it once you&#39;ve had your scans, not all babies are exactly the same size, so there&#39;s still some room for error. Hence an awful lot of babies are a few days early or a few days late.<br><br>And then of course some babies are just comfy, and have no plans to shift. Amazingly, I wasn&#39;t one of them. Made it for it ever since though.</p>

            <p>Joren (as quoted from the TP wikia):<br><br>&quot;Joren of Stone Mountain is the son of Burchard of Stone Mountain. He is very much a conservative and appears in First Test, Page and Squire as the main nemesis of Keladry of Mindelan, hazing new pages brutally and picking on Kel especially because she was a girl. He arranged the kidnapping of Kel&#39;s maid Lalasa and her dog Jump to make Kel miss her exams and was charged for the crimes, but was only forced to pay a fine because he was a noble and Lalasa was not (this lead Kel to ask King Jonathan to change the laws). <br><br>In the novel Squire , Joren is found dead in the Chamber of the Ordeal. However, it wasn&#39;t the Chamber judging him for his crimes but his own inflexibility that killed him. The Chamber doesn&#39;t judge the character, it just tests if the candidate is fit to survive as a knight of the realm. As &quot;Joren could not bend, even a little&quot;, he didn&#39;t survive the test set for him by the chamber.&quot;<br><br>Joren has longish white-blond hair, blue eyes and is described in the books by Kel as being &quot;the most beautiful boy she had ever seen,&quot; or something like that. (She also mentions that Joren&#39;s looks go to the point of almost being feminine.) <br><br>I personally just think that he&#39;s a rival character of Kel and the Suethors should leave him alone. If they can&#39;t write him correctly, then they shouldn&#39;t bother with trying until they learn how. Poor boy. He&#39;s an absolute fangirl magnet.<br></p>

<li>A provisional yes, dependent upon the specifics of each case. If it fits the general feel of the PPC, doesn&#39;t grant your agents Sueish powers, and doesn&#39;t interfere with anyone else&#39;s PPC writings, go for it. If you&#39;re thinking a piece of technology that would somehow radically change the way your agents tackle missions, and that would have ramifications throughout HQ, best to check with the other Boarders on a case by case basis. Basically the rule is: so long as you stick to the PPC spirit and don&#39;t tread on anyone&#39;s toes, and remember the aim is comedy, you&#39;re fine.<br><br>2. and 3. Depends if the mission will be improved by the creation of one, really. If the mini adds nothing, best not to bother. A surname would certainly create a mini; on place names I&#39;m not entirely sure.<br><br>4. Just because a fic is AU doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not bad. Granted I do Bad Slash, not Sues, so the detail of Sues in AUs I&#39;m not familiar with, but I&#39;d guess the principle is the same. In the DBS we charge for implausible sex, implausible characterisation, implausible lube, implausible biology etc. These things are a constant whether the fic is AU or not. I&#39;d guess with Sues the same is true - a Sue is a Sue, whether in the original canon, a straight fanfic, or an AU. And if she&#39;s enough of a Sue to warrant killing, that should be obvious whether the fic&#39;s labelled AU or not.</li>

            <p>Trojie and I came up with it when we had a puddle of blood to clean up from the floor of a canonical room. We needed some way to restore the room and canon restoration wasn&#39;t going to do it, so we created a Towel that soaks up blood and deposits it in a plothole. It didn&#39;t make our jobs any easier and is the sort of thing you&#39;d <i>expect</i> HQ to supply us with anyway. So that was perfectly fine. <br><br>And yes, that was mainly written as an advertisement.<br><br>As for Question #4, I&#39;ll just second Pads - using the &quot;AU&quot; label is one of the cheapest and most common ways badfic authors try to claim that their work is good.

            <p>Also, about your answer to number four, I think that the author completely made a Possessed!Sue of one, if not more, of the characters in that shipfic. Checklist:<br><br>* Long, lengthy descriptions about gorgeous looks, namely the eyes.<br><br>* &quot;Chauvinistic Prig&quot; attitude.<br><br>* Author-created &quot;pity-party&quot; problem. (She gives the character dyslexia. At least the symptoms are fairly correct.)<br><br>* Author-added abusing and overly-controlling family members. <br><br>Those were the ones that tipped me off.

            <p>I meant that the relationship that this author is trying to pull off from the &quot;Protector of the Small&quot; quartet is being compared to a Draco/Hermione shipfic. You know, the classic &quot;evil rival from school suddenly falls for heroine&quot; story. Joren from this series acts pretty much just like Draco. Sorry for the confusion. <br><br>You&#39;re right, of course. Badfic authors never write the two correctly. Never.</p>

            <p>I actually had a piece of equipment in mind. Modified sunglasses for usage in the Warhammer 40k continuum and other continua with Eldritch Horrors/things which can drive people mad by being looked at. Based on Zaphod&#39;s sunglasses in &quot;the Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;, they blur or black out the relevant object/being (eg. Slaneesh/Cthulhu/Chaos icons and symbols...). <br><br>High turnover rate or no, Warhammer 40 k Agents must have <i>some</i> way of resisting going mad from looking at Chaos stuff after the 3rd mission or so...  </p>

            <p>So long as there&#39;s thought gone into it and it&#39;s not going to give your agents super powers that detract from the missions, go for it.

            <p>... a solution that doesn&#39;t involve massively powerful weapons? Exorcisms would work the same way as anywhere else (only stand well back when they take effect; supernatural entities don&#39;t necessarily wake up well). Depending on the entity, they might be susceptible to tranquilisers, chloroform, etc to make it easier. Heck, even acting like a bumbling idiot, pretending you think they&#39;re a famous author, and asking for their autograph would get you near enough to exorcise, easy.<br><br>Killing is different, but not necessarily harder. [Has now glanced at the &#39;fic] There&#39;s dozens of continua where angels can be killed -- if you can&#39;t think of anything better, just drag her over there and stab away. Or you could tempt her with something she can&#39;t resist (she&#39;s a Sue, shouldn&#39;t be too hard), then point out that she&#39;s just become a Fallen Angel and violated her character description; with luck she&#39;ll implode from logic overdose. Or you could borrow a hero from an Eddings book, they&#39;re prone to killing divinities and their servants. Or... dozens of things.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Given how Metatron reacted to the fire extinguisher incident in canon, I do not envy the agents who have to exorcise him. Nor do I envy them having to bring home a Mini-Golgothan. (In case you don&#39;t know what the Golgothan is, it&#39;s a walking hostile pile of faeces formed from the bowels and bladders of crucifixion victims releasing in their death-throes. Pleasant creature, but I figure it&#39;d be an appropriate Mini.)</p>

            <p>It was a very enjoyable read, I have to admit. Though I&#39;m going to have to find my place again, because this isn&#39;t anywhere near where I last was, heh. Was interesting seeing Kayleigh&#39;s serious side for once. Forgive me for speaking out of turn, I just thought I&#39;d comment, and state the weirdness inherent in that, reading something entirely different and not being near anything PPC-related, I knew you had updated.

            <p>Hello everyone, my third mission and (technically, though her first with that particular Agent) Cassie&#39;s fifth has just passed Pads&#39; beta-reading, so now it&#39;s done and ready to be plugged! We cowrote it and finished it right quick, it just took Pads a little while to get to betaing it, but that doesn&#39;t matter now. Here&#39;s the link on my site:<br><br><a href="http://rc5593.webs.com/mission3.htm"><a href="http://rc5593.webs.com/mission3.htm">http://rc5593.webs.com/mission3.htm</a></a><br><br>I assume Cassie&#39;s gonna put it on her LJ or something, but I&#39;ll leave her to post a link to it when she gets it on, as my site&#39;s the only place that has it at the moment. My fourth mission is underway, though I don&#39;t have an actual fic yet (if anyone knows a particularly bad Zelda suefic far enough in to give me enough to work with, that&#39;d be nice, but I&#39;m looking for myself anyway). Hope you enjoy it and, as said in the final authors&#39; notes, constructive criticism is requested. I&#39;m going to be rather put off if nobody aside from Pads even <i>tries</i>. ;) See y&#39;all topside. *goes back to working on fourth mission*</p>

            <p>So there&#39;s someone on LJ who&#39;s taken something of a novel approach: namely, taking a Suefic and <i>rewriting it so that it&#39;s no longer a Suefic</i>.  The author knew about the project ahead of time, and is being given credit where it&#39;s due.  (Which doesn&#39;t mean that she&#39;s <i>happy</i> about it...but she kind of brought it on herself.)<br><br>What&#39;s the policy on something like that?  (And no...although I&#39;m aware of the situation, I&#39;m not directly involved.)</p>

            <p>Well, it&#39;s novel if they take the actual fic, and keep the name of the OC and such.<br><br>I&#39;ve done something similar.

            <p>Sorry, it&#39;s just I never figured that people could have <i>not</i> heard of it, even if they aren&#39;t games people. The mainstream media kicked up a big fuss about it on a lot of occasions (the Columbine massacre being the major one though). They spoke utter bull, as usual. Then there&#39;s the sequels, the movie, I think there were a few other big things as well. Oh, well, I gave you the link, so no worries. Now you know.</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m pretty certain I got Permission from Miss Cam to write PPC in late 2003, as I was still at high school. I think I attempted being on the Board for the first time in 2004 - but it didn&#39;t last long as I was on dialup at the time and the Board EATS the internet for breakfast and the Parental Unit, with whom I lived at the time, was Not Impressed. <br><br>I think I reattempted Boarding again in 2005, with a similar fail. <br><br>I finally got broadband access and reacquainted myself with PPCing properly sometime in late 2006-2007, and have been here fully ever since :D</p>

            <p>Many moons ago, while co-writing with July, Trojie and I noticed a peculiarity of her grammar,which we merrily corrected throughout. But betaing for KG recently, an identical non-standard construction cropped up all over the place. So we&#39;re starting to wonder if it&#39;s a common and perfectly acceptable manner of speaking in the States. An example:<br><br>&quot;When I was going to the bus stop, I saw a man.&quot; - standard grammatical construction; simple past tense.<br><br>&quot;When I had been going to the bus stop, I saw a man.&quot; - variant spotted in July and KG&#39;s writing; pluperfect followed by simple past, which I&#39;m not at all convinced is standard (though feel free to correct me). Looks odd to me, because that &quot;had been going&quot; suggests &quot;ceased going prior to the seeing&quot;.<br><br>So, does anyone else use the second grammatical construction? And since it&#39;s always interesting to see the geographical spread of these things, if you use it (or not), where are you?</p>

            <p>I think I&#39;ve heard that before with a contraction; &quot;When I&#39;d been going etc. etc.&quot;.<br><br>It certainly doesn&#39;t seem grammatically correct and I doubt I&#39;ve ever used it myself, but I do think I&#39;ve heard similar things before.

            <p>The bugger of it is that there actually are well-documented links between class and grammatical deviations from standard. Never bothered me, but then, I&#39;m English. We&#39;re practically <i>born</i> with an understanding and acceptance of class here.<br><br>Random informtative fact of the day: One of the biggest effects on whether one&#39;s grammar is non-standard is actually only indirectly related to money - it&#39;s level of education. Of course, this gets blurred to some extent these days thanks to access to global media, and it&#39;s certainly going to be blurred amongst people you meet round here thanks to online influences on us all. But there was a section on my sociolinguistics exam last year which involved some data collected a few decades ago. Said data demonstrated no or very few non-standard grammatical forms in people (who knew they were being recorded to have their idiolect analysed) who were university educated, with a sliding scale down to consistent deviations in over half the grammatical constructions being analysed from people who never made it past the eleven-plus. And, if memory serves, it also demonstrated that amongst the working classes or the less educated, women deviate less than men, but amongst the highly educated or the upper classes, men deviate less than women.<br><br>I think the point of that ramble was &quot;class is a loaded word so sociolinguists tend to avoid it&quot;.</p>

            <p>...for my periodic gmail plug. Not only do Trojie and I keep our missions on livejournal, which isn&#39;t likely to go under, they&#39;re also all stored in google documents, accessible anywhere and not at the mercy of hardware failures. I suppose it&#39;s possible for google to under, but I can&#39;t see it happening any time soon. Plus you&#39;ll never have to play word document ping pong again!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m betaing a Harry Potter/Stargate crossover for someone and we&#39;ve been discussing the ATA gene and if it has an effect on HP magic or not/controls HP magic or not. She came up with this and asked if this was sound. From what I can understand, it seems to be, but I thought I&#39;d get a second opinion (obviously, this is directed mostly at Trojie, goddess of biology). In case you&#39;re not familiar with Stargate, the ATA gene (does that actually stand for anything?) is what gives people the ability to control Ancient/Alteran technology.<br><br>&quot;There are three general principles that are the basis of this theory.<br><br>1. Either you have a gene, or you don’t.<br><br>2. The expression of genes you do have can be strong, weak, something in between, or even non-existing.<br><br>3. Promoter genes are genes that tell other genes if they should be turned on or off, and how strong their expression should be.<br><br>Keeping that in mind, if you look at the ATA gene, you either have it, or you don’t. If you don’t have it, you cannot turn on, or in some cases even control, Ancient technology. If you do have the ATA gene, the expression can be different. O’Neill, Beckett and Sheppard, for instance, have a very strong expression.<br><br>The ATA gene has shown no sign of being recessive, so I’m considering it as a dominant gene. It is, however rare, and needs some promoter genes to work, which is the reason the gene therapy works for McKay, but not for everyone. McKay has the necessary promoter genes to turn the gene on, while others don’t have it, so the gene therapy doesn’t work on them. The promoter genes are passed on separately from the ATA gene, so active ATA genes are not always heritable.<br><br>All magical people, and that includes most Squibs, have the ATA gene, but in order to have working magical abilities, they need to have an additional, dominant gene, which I’ll call the MAG gene. Squibs, born from two magical parents, do have the ATA gene in most cases, but lack the MAG gene, so they can’t do magic. Muggleborns have one parent with the ATA gene, while the other has the MAG gene, and they have inherited both, enabling them to do magic while their parents can’t. The fact that Wizards need both rare genes to be magical accounts for the very low number of magical people on Earth.<br><br>Magical ability is correlated with the expression of the MAG gene, just like the strength of the ATA gene is correlated with its expression. <br><br>In my story, Daniel has both the ATA gene and the MAG gene, with a moderate ATA gene expression and a strong MAG gene expression (like Harry had before the merging). Jack doesn’t have the MAG gene, but he does have the ATA gene and it is expressed very strong.&quot;</p>

            <p>*isn&#39;t sure how to start with this*<br><br>I may be mildly incoherent in this explanation, so if I&#39;m unclear, do ask.<br><br>Um, okay. Genes. Right. <br><br>Genes are lengths of DNA. DNA is read from one end to the other, so they have to be in the right order to work correctly. DNA condenses into chromosomes, which come in pairs. Each member of a pair has the same genes (well, theoretically, but we won&#39;t go into crossing over and mutations and things here) because they are copies of each other. So you have two copies of each gene. <br><br>There may be two or more slightly different versions of a gene - these are called alleles. It is alleles that are either dominant or recessive, not genes. <br><br>So, the way I interpret what you&#39;re talking about is that the ATA gene has two alleles - dominant (= can use Ancient tech) and recessive (= can&#39;t use it). If someone is homozygous dominant (that is, they carry two dominant alleles), they have the &#39;strong&#39; expression of the gene (= phenotype). If they are a heterozygote (have one copy of each allele) they have a more moderate expression. Someone who is homozygous recessive is not able to use Ancient tech - they are a &#39;normal&#39; human. As is the case with blue eye colour, it is very possibly for the recessive allele to be more common in a population. <br><br>The promoter gene would be heritable in the same way, and the MAG gene as well.<br><br>Basically her theory follows, but with the modification that genes themselves are not dominant or recessive; that it is their different forms that are :)<br><br>Or at least, it works enough for fiction - a real geneticist, which I am not, would most likely kick up at the details, but then again, they&#39;d probably kick up about Ancient technology and about magic as well :P<br><br></p>

            <p>and I totally agree.<br>I would have thought MAG would be a downstream gene from ATA (which would be involved in two different, but similar, functions: using Ancient technology, and using magic, though the MAG gene). But any way could work.</p>
