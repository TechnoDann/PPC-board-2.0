You&#39;ll also notice Winston start to come into his own a bit, including making his own calls when to charge. I tried to take some of Sara&#39;s advice in her &quot;how to write better&quot; thread to heart, but I&#39;ve been planning on doing this for a while, so, nobody think they forced me, okay?<br><br>Also, they bring back much unacanonical tech that I&#39;m sure DoSAT could have a field day with, including a lightsaber that turns into a bazooka!</p>

            <p>Agreed with WikiMaster - Incest between close relatives is bad, because of the pregnancy risk. Don&#39;t know too much about Avatar, but I&#39;m sure Zuko&#39;s OOC to its logical extremes, and I&#39;m fairly sure Azula is too. If I hadn&#39;t resolved to not feel squick at anything short of Agony in Pink-level extra-graphic torture, tentacle pr0n art, or more than ten minutes on /b/, I would be squicked. As it is, I just want to kill it with... something that isn&#39;t fire, actually.<br><br>On an unrelated note, the author has something in his/her profile that says every single Mary Sue-type character in existence is bad. Cue massive amounts of headdesk.</p>

            <p>Oh god, the sheer uncanon of it all. She denounces all the canon &#39;ships right then and there. And then there&#39;s the Ron/Ginny.

            <p>Not all torture porn is bad. There&#39;s a pretty good Gundam 00 AU that spawned off a prompt on the fandom&#39;s kinkmeme where one of the pairings is extremely sadomasochistic. The most recent installment of the series had the masochistic partner kidnapped and tortured and it was good. <s>It was also left on an Everest-sized cliffhanger so in my opinion the next part can&#39;t come soon enough. With my luck though the next part to be posted won&#39;t be the conclusion.</s></p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to have disagree with that one. Torture porn doesn&#39;t work but it doesn&#39;t work that way in real life. As someone who&#39;s been on a very thorough tour of Tuol Sleng/S-21, I can tell you that real torture techniques would make even the most die-hard S&amp;M fan recoil. Actual torture is not about arousal-it&#39;s about breaking people. As a result, it depends on raw physical pain, and more importantly, fear. For example, waterboarding depends entirely on primal fear. Sure, it&#39;s also painful, but the main point is to overload your mind with the fear of drowning. All this stuff with nipple clamps and whatnot is just pointless, really.<br><br>The reason that it worked in, to use Trojie&#39;s example, &quot;War Stories&quot;, was that it was actually a fairly realistic depiction of torture.<br><br>Sorry to rant about this, but this is something of a sore spot for me.</p>

            <p>Aliens decide that Earth is too valuable as a life-supporting planet to die due to human behaviour, and after Keeanu Reeves&#39; character (an alien in human form) is thoroughly discouraged by the hyper-paranoid American government and has had a chance to show off his Amazing Mind Control Of Electricity And Machines Power, decides that, yes, all humans have to die. Lead Female Character tries to change his mind. Big chase. American Defense People are paranoid and shoot, shoot, shoot. Lots of proof that alien technology is WAY superior to ours (except our CGI workshop) despite being hypocritical considering that they&#39;re Uber Environmentalists.<br><br>Reeves&#39; character eventually gets all sentimental and agrees that, yes &quot;we&quot; (humans) do show their best qualities when on the edge of death (this is, by the way, after Lead Female Character has cried and insisted that &quot;We can change!&quot; many times over), and goes out and nearly (or perhaps actually) gets himself killed stopping his own machines, which then fly away, but have already destroyed most of New York (of course. Why is it never Perth or Anchorage or Bristol?), and have ruined all electrical power so humans will have to Go Back To Nature.<br><br>Very moralistic. <br><br>That wasn&#39;t short. Pfft.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve never got around to reading Pratchett. *is shamed*<br><br>But it always amazes me that writers, both in fanfiction and published writers think that bigger is better.

An Australian man is in Amsterdam, trying to find a prostitute, but every one runs away when he pulls it out, afraid it&#39;ll hurt them. Eventually, he finds a brothel owner who swears that one of her girls will be big enough for him and she asks how big it is.<br><br>Man: &quot;Seven inches.&quot;<br><br>Brothel Owner: &quot;Seven inches?

            <p>I remember I was linked to it because I felt like reading an absolute shedload of badfic and coming out mostly unscathed. I succeeded, for the most part - I had to skim Subjugation and Agony in Red/Pink though, ten percent because they&#39;re disturbing and ninety percent because they&#39;re long and repetitive.

            <p>It&#39;s extremely rare, but I&#39;ve encountered two parodies in the Star Wars section. Parodies of the crap on the rest of the site. :D<br><br>There&#39;s also a decently written torture story (I think. It&#39;s been a while since I read it) which, as far as I can remember, had no issues but the usual AFF format screwups (where words merge etc) and the sexual element and a bit of fandom-breaking stuff (it was Jaina Solo being tortured to death by a sentient ship that Anakin Skywalker had pissed off and being raped by her lightsabre).<br><br>There was also a Tomb Raider fic which was decently written. It was a &quot;Lara dies every single chapter because that&#39;s what happens in-game&quot; fic. It was very amusing to read the comments whining about the lack of sexual content. As one comment said in response, while AFF is usually used for porn, there&#39;s no rule saying there has to be porn.</p>

            <p>Thank god for L4D. The Resident Evil section is filled with goreophilia. Badly written goreophilia at that.<br><br>I have two rapes in my combined stories (that I can remember right now anyway). One victim is a seventeen-year-old woman, the other a fourteen-year-old girl. I&#39;m going to be trying to handle it as realistically as possible and therefore, those fics are high on the &quot;I&#39;m going to make this <i>perfect</i> before I even consider uploading&quot; list. So therefore, no comfort sex (or even thoughts of it) and no &quot;oh, I liked that, do it again!&quot; bull et cetera.</p>

            <p>&quot;Hello. We are from a faraway place. We would like to cooperate with you to form a better life for both of our species. However, we must warn you that if you should in any way attempt to harm us, we have access to weapons that could very easily shatter your homeworld. We would say you&#39;d all just become ash, but the fact is it&#39;d be more likely for those who took the brunt of the blasts to be vaporized. The few of you who survive will likely succumb to the fallout and die shortly.&quot;<br><br>It occurs to me that I&#39;m a somewhat aggressive individual.

            <p>Just like a venom blade, only it dampens felings of lust in the people you cut with it, instead of poisoning them. As for Anti-Lustin, It is a substance that stops people from going head over heels in lust whenever they meet a hot canon character (it doesn&#39;t work on Sues, however). The sword produces its own. </p>

            <p>Oh, sweet cherry pie, yes. But wouldn&#39;t a dagger work a little better than a sword, given that the purpose doesn&#39;t seem to be wounding the target but bringing them from out of a daze? A dagger would be considerably more precise. Plus if it were a nice throwing knife, you could just flick your wrist, yank it out, and stride away.</p>

            <p>I comes bearing links. *drags out Big Bag O&#39; Links and digs through it*<br><br>First off is the link to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">Wiki</a>, a veritable fount of information for a newbie to read through. Especially helpful for you if you want to write missions would be the page on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> (note the capital P).<br><br>I would advise against reading any <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>, unless you are of strong mind and stomach. Even the summaries have been known to give those of weaker constitution nightmares.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, not knowing what you have already managed to find, I have several links for you. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek) is a good place to start, as the PPC did many aeons ago. <s>What do you mean I&#39;m exaggerating?</s> <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">The Department of Geographical Aberrations</a> is another interesting place to visit, if you have the time and inclination. Also by hS is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/index.htm">Tangled Webs</a> site, which contains backstory for the PPC as an organisation. If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be. And last, but most definitely not least, <a href="http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/65922.html">Response Centre 45</a> is where Trojie and Pads&#39; missions are archived.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay here.

            <p>My dear, I&#39;ve read through the entirety of My Immortal. My system has been sufficiently strengthened, I should think, against terrible literature of all shapes and sizes. I did start with the original series, (I fell asleep about halfway through. Not out of boredom - they were a great read - but because I started at about 12:30 in the morning.)<br><br>I did not know there was a wiki, so thanks for that, truly!<br><br>THe Department of Geographical Aberrations... hm... I&#39;ll look into that sometime! ♥ All this other stuff is nice as well. Odd that I&#39;ve missed the movement for so long.<br><br>And the response center! LOVELY!<br><br>In any case, don&#39;t worry, my sanity was shattered into convenient bite-sized chunks for use when needed long ago. (My character&#39;s germaphobia?

We&#39;re all a bit crazy here, and keeping your sanity (preferably in a box) is pretty much optional.<br><br>That said, here&#39;s some helpful information; no, you don&#39;t have to be a Tolkien nut to join here. We cover every fandom that anybody wants to cover, from Tolkien to Star Wars to Redwall and all kinds of others.<br><br>The best thing to do would be to check out the Original Series (those written by Jay and Acacia) and the PPC Wiki, not to mention The Reorganisation and Crashing Down. Other people&#39;s recommendations, and links, will probably be presented to you very soon. I personally recommend the above, and also to read the PPC Constitution for the basic rules of behaviour we&#39;re expected to follow.<br><br>If you want to join and write your own stuff, the basic guidelines are as follows;<br><br>1. Thou shalt hang around the Board for a month or so, so we can get to know thee.<br><br>2. Thou shalt then post asking for Permission, including in the post thine Agent profiles, a sample of thy writing, and maybe the fic thou intendest to kill.<br><br>3. The Permission Givers shall then gaze upon it and, if it be to their liking, grant thee Permission. And therefore, verily, thou mayst go forth and PPC to thine heart&#39;s content.<br><br>Basically, not too much is required of you except for the above requirements, and when you join you can work in any fandom you feel confident enough in.<br><br>Once again, lovely to have you here. I hope you have fun.</p>

            <p>If any of you have read Wicked (by Gregory Maguire), what&#39;s your opinion on that book? I&#39;m not sure I like it.<br><br>I saw the musical recently, and I quite enjoyed it, until my friend compared it to the book. Of course, the musical cut out a lot, and I for one am rather glad it did. Because even though Wicked is a published work, it is still technically a fanfiction. In my honest opinion, it kinda ruined the Ozverse. But what do you guys think?</p>

            <p>When something is published, it becomes a Word World. And therefore the Oz of Wicked is canon. Its own canon, though, rather than being considered the same canon as the original novel/s by Baum, or the film. <br><br>I believe however that the Wicked book and musical are considered different &#39;verses of the same canon, from what I&#39;ve gleaned. <br><br>Sedri would be your expert here. But my feeling is that it&#39;s not fanfiction, it&#39;s a Word World of its own by virtue of being published and by having so much independant canon and backstory that the original novel or the film. <br><br>I&#39;m halfway through it now, actually, and I have to say I enjoy it, but that&#39;s probably got a lot to do with the fact that Maguire has done (a LOT better) for the Ozverse something similar to what a lot of my fic does to the Narniaverse - try to shoehorn adult considerations and politics into a canon written for children :)</p>

            <p>From a fanfic and PPC standpoint, it&#39;s definitely a Word World of its own: Baum&#39;s work was out of copyright when Maguire wrote it, and it&#39;s published - thus, it is fully-fledged canon. There is a clear differentiation between the musicalverse and the bookverse for fanfic writers, however, those are considerd <i>Wicked</i> fanfiction, not <i>Oz</i> fanfiction.<br><br>However, from a story-reader&#39;s viewpoint, it can be either. Generally I find that those who didn&#39;t like <i>Wicked</i> in one way or another consider it Published Fanfiction and therefore ignorable, which is perfectly valid. I was never a big fan of <i>Oz</i> before <i>Wicked</i>, and so I consider Baum&#39;s work to be more of a background from which details can be drawn to give substance to the Wickedverse, but which is not strict law, meaning I can ignore the &#39;childish&#39; and ridiculous aspects of the original Oz books that I don&#39;t like. So it works both ways.<br><br>Also bear in mind that there is quite a difference between Baum&#39;s <i>Oz</i> books and the 1939 film with Judy Garland which most people know - in the book, the ruby slippers were silver, Glinda was Witch of the South, and the Witch of the West was a one-eyed coward with perfectly normal skin. Maguire&#39;s <i>Wicked</i> is a combination of the two which leans more heavily towards Baum&#39;s book, while the musical is extrapolated almost exclusively from the &#39;39 movie. So you basically have two parallel works of Published Fanfiction - one in books, one acted on film or in theatre - and <i>four</i> different potential &#39;verses, of which fans can theoretically pick any. <br><br><br>To answer your first question: I personally don&#39;t like Maguire&#39;s novel very much, for almost the same reason that Trojie seems to like it: Maguire seems to be trying way, way too hard to make an adult world - there&#39;s way too much unecessary sex and violence in the <i>Wicked</i> book for my taste. Butt the musical definitely isn&#39;t written for children - there&#39;s torture, several main characters die, and the love song verges on explicit - and I like that. I like the adult-but-still-soft version in which Elphaba was someone I could like. Of course, the fact that I saw the musical first will have a great deal to do with it. :)</p>

            <p>If I&#39;m honest, I just have issues with periods of time shorter than ten thousand years. <br><br>Uncyclopaedia tells the truth when it says &#39;One of the main difficulties in communicating with geologists is their belief that a million years is a short amount of time and their heads are harder than rocks. Consequently, such abstract concepts as &quot;Tuesday Morning&quot; and Lunchtime are completely beyond their comprehension. (This difficulty generates problems particularly when dealing with the girlfriend/boyfriend/spouse and attempting to explain why you were &quot;gone for so long&quot; or why something is taking &quot;so long to occur.&quot;)&#39;</p>

            <p>Okay, right. Where to start. I&#39;m simplifying this, uh, a bit.<br><br>The record of life through time is the fossil record. The fossil record is things that are preserved in rock. Rock gets laid down in a number of ways and at varying speeds. Sometimes you&#39;ll get three inches depth of sediment over a million years. Sometimes you&#39;ll get thirty feet. Sometimes you&#39;ll get three hundred feet.<br><br>Rock also gets destroyed in a number of ways. The longer a given body of rock has been around, the more likely it is to get destroyed soon. There are very few places on the Earth where unaltered rock from, say, the Archaean, are preserved. <br><br>The period of time of interest to us is the base of the Cambrian, 542 million years ago (Ma). This is, I&#39;m sure you can appreciate, quite some time ago, even to those of us who work with deep time (for reference, the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago, human ancestors arose around about 4-3 million years ago ish (this is another one of those &#39;controversial&#39; issues), etc etc). <br><br>Unaltered Cambrian rock (by &#39;unaltered&#39; I mean not squeezed to hellandgone by more rock on top, not baked by heat and depth, and outcropping at the surface - i.e., rock we can get at) is not actually that common. Most of it has been metamorphosed, subducted or eroded by now. So, baseline for understanding here is that the history of life through time is a book, and the closer to the beginning of the book we get, the more pages are missing.<br><br>Now, let&#39;s get back to that thing about sediment getting deposited over time. <br><br>Evolution happens over time. How much time is debatable (see &#39;Dawkins vs Gould&#39; by Kim Sterelny for a good synopsis of the two sides of the debate on this one), but for the purposes of right now, we&#39;ll just accept &#39;a long time&#39; and move on. So any given population of animals or plants changes by very small increments (okay, okay, there are exceptions, I&#39;m not going into them here, just work with me). <br><br>Not all animals are preserved in the fossil record. Off the top of my head, I think the preservation rate is somewhere between one and ten percent of any given species may enjoy the luxury of fossilisation. It&#39;s all dependant on the environment they die in and a few other things. The great majority of fossils that are found are of marine organisms, because the environment is better for preservation under the sea.<br><br>So, we have basically a roulette here. Not many specimens are preserved. The rock they&#39;re preserved in is becoming increasingly rare. The ones that are preserved are not necessarily the ones that show any kind of easy-to-see change.<br><br>And there&#39;s one more thing. Generally, the only bits of an animal that fossilise are the hard parts - shells, teeth, bones. But I bet you can think of a dozen things alive today that don&#39;t have any of those. <br><br>This is where the term &#39;Cambrian Explosion&#39; comes in. At about 542Ma, suddenly in the rock record we find multicellular organisms with shells. It&#39;s literally, bang, there in the rock. Like an invisible line - below it, only microfossils, if that. Above it, shellfish (not quite molluscs, but basically shellfish). <br><br>So, the reason I say &#39;sudden&#39;, is because in all likelihood it was nothing like sudden. It&#39;s just that it appears sudden because the rock is not preserving all the evidence - it&#39;s like a strobe light. You put on a strobe light, and dance. Watch your friends dancing. You only see flashes of what they&#39;re doing, not all the bits in between. If one flash of the light they were not wearing a hat, and the next one they were, it&#39;d look to you like the hat just magically appeared. Of course it didn&#39;t - they had to pick it up and put it on, but you didn&#39;t see that bit. <br><br>Um, I hope that explanation helped. </p>

            <p>Yes, it still requires two people to make a child.

            <p>I hate life. Life sucks. No children in the future, offered jobs which I&#39;m scared of and worse. And yeah, it involved phone contact (which I&#39;m terrified of. I&#39;m no good talking face-to-face, let alone on the phone). Fortunately, I came up with a perfect solution to turn it down. My mum&#39;s heavily, heavily disabled and a 9 to 5 job from Mondays to Fridays would stop her ever leaving the house to go to my grandparent&#39;s as I&#39;m the only one capable of helping her (i.e. lifting her and her wheelchair up large steps).</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve... umm... I&#39;ve been encouraging one of my friends to try to write fanfiction for a while. I just succeeded. This... umm... this is what he came up with. I&#39;m really not sure what to say. He has a lot of severe learning disabilities and I can vouch for this, so forgive the atrocious spelling. However, the learning disabilities have also made me confused as to whether or not he&#39;s aware that this is badfic approaching My Immortal... help?<br><br><b>Chapter 1 <br><br>Halo</b> <br><br>The year is 2553 the unknown weapon halo has been destroyed by humans. Halo a weapon in the shape of a ring, Captain Keyes has died but his daughter carries on the search to wipe out all covenant scum from the face of the earth. In a distant galaxy far far away a new species is forming which are known as Jedi and sith. They must join Keyes’s daughter in the fight against the covenant on earth. One person has come back to help them win the fight against the covenant and that the covenant are scared of the one person they now to well he is known as the MasterChief. <br><br>The MasterChief tells Keyes were the covenant are hiding. He says to Keyes’s daughter “the covenant are hiding somewhere on earth”. The covenant is hiding in LA. He tells her to go to another galaxy far away out of reach of the covenant and to get help from the others that are going to help them wipe out the covenant on earth. The MasterChief tells her to go to the planets of Naboo, Mustarfar and Tatooine and Hoth to collect the last remaining Jedi and Sith to join them in the battle against the covenant on earth. MasterChief says to Keyes “there is more covenant on earth than humans.” He tells her to head for their home planet Earth.  <br><br><b>Chapter 2 <br><br>The covenant on earth</b> <br><br>Once the MasterChief and Keyes had collected all the remaining Jedi and Sith from their home worlds. They lade in a new course for Earth. They had to go into hyperspace to go to their home planet of Earth. It was a race against time. The covenant were sending their drop ships into the Earths Atmosphere. Keyes say to Cortana “they are already landing their troops on the earth’s surface”. Cortana says to the MasterChief “you know what to do.” Keyes says to chief “I will drop you somewhere else quite near covenant landing zone”. “All right lets move out Jedi’s and Sith” says Johnson. Johnson what is it chief “I need a weapon” says MasterChief. “Let’s go kick some covenant ass” says Johnson. The covenant are almost insight said Samikoto one of the Jedi.   <br><br>MasterChief and the others went see if the covenant were ready for a fight for the planet and to see if they can get earth back to its original state of beauty and to get the people back to living a normal life. Cortana says “covenant drop ship inbound.” <br><br><b>Chapter 3 <br><br>The covenant start the fight</b><br><br>The covenant saw the pelican take off and leave. One of the grunts says that he has a bad feeling about this to the other lot of grunts. MasterChief “you go that way” says Johnson, the MasterChief <br><br>Followed the orders he was given. By Johnson. Johnson said the MasterChief “shall I make the covenant scared or make them jump.” And Johnson says you go make the covenant scum scared Chief said Johnson. As soon as he got near the grunt that saw the pelican take off. He shouted boo to the grunt and the grunt turned around and looks up and screams and shouts run away he’s back he’s back ah. He going to kill us all no. Then MasterChief throws a plasma grenade at the grunt and the grunt shouts get it off of me. He then gives the sign to move in to Johnson. Johnson then tells the Jedi to go to the left and the sith to go to the right and the marines to follow him and the MasterChief. <br><br>Cortana orders a mongoose, a scorpion tank, warthog to be drop near the sith and Jedi and the marines. The covenant were starting a fight with the sith and Jedi. The covenant had lost a great number of troops. More troops were getting dropped from other ships that were landing. The arbiter was helping the humans and the MasterChief.  <br><br><b>Chapter 4 <br><br>The fight continues</b><br><br>The covenant were winning the fight. Most of the marines were lost because of the grunts lobbing plasma grenades. The Jedi and sith were doing much better at getting rid of the covenant by using there knowledge of the force and the MasterChief was get the same amount of kills as Johnson but they were getting wiped out. <br><br>The MasterChief got into the scorpion tank and started to shout all the remaining covenant scum into a oblivion from the face of the earth and the earth was not safe yet as they started to celebrate a home coming victory they saw that the sky was turning dark and they all looked up and saw covenant drop ships transport elites, jackals and grunts down to the surface.<br><br>The fights were almost over the Jedi and sith were loosing numbers fast and the marines were winning the fight against the last of the covenant and they were culling them all. Then the MasterChief was near the control room to halo. The Jedi’s and sith helped with the door to the control room. <br><br><b>Chapter 5<br><br>The assault on the control room</b> <br><br>The Jedi and sith were the first to enter the door to the control room and then MasterChief was the next to enter the control room. Once they all had entered the control room they headed towards the main heart of the control room. They saw that the weapon halo hadn’t been finished. They had to shoot through tons of flood which were easy to kill and once they had defeated the flood they moved onto the heart of Halo. Once they were in they had to deactivate the rings controls to halo so no one could use it to destroy humanity.  <br><br>Once they had done that they had to get out before more covenant reinforcements could arrive to active halo again. The MasterChief had done it again. The peace on earth was restored once again and the Jedi and sith well had been dropped back to were they came from. <br><br><b>Chapter 6 <br><br>The Peace on Earth</b><br><br>Once the MasterChief and the marines had been pick up life on earth<br><br>Had been restored to the way they were living before. The covenant had been destroyed by MasterChief and the marines. The earth was safe from the covenant once again. What about halo well its safe now because they had completed their final mission to wipe all covenant scum from the face of earth. And stop the final halo from being activated and to bring peace and humanity back to earth for the final time. The arbiter had been left on earth to protect the humans and children from another covenant invasion. The arbiter says fare well to the MasterChief and the other humans who helped bring peace and humanity to earth. He says under his breath see you Old friend.<br><br>And... err... that&#39;s it... umm... what do I say in response?</p>

            <p>I like my tea to be proper tea. Camomile, cinnamon and mint do not count as tea. They are herbal infusions, and thus weird flavoured water.<br><br>I have been known to have the odd cup of white tea with strawberry, or green tea with blueberry, pomegranate and red grape, but this is because my friend Becky doesn&#39;t drink normal tea and so only has crappy red label in the house, which tends to taste of dishwater.<br><br>For preference I take my tea in a pint and a half mug. Which is never cleaned inside - I&#39;ve been working on its innards since Christmas, and have got it to a lovely state of black-and-flaky (although my housemate has a tendency to stir it too vigorously and knock off flakes, and has even on one memorable occasion attempted to wash my mug).<br><br>A pint and a half mug takes a long time to brew, so I&#39;ve got lazy of late. Teabag goes in first, then water, then a quick stir and then milk, and the bag&#39;s left in to brew. Takes about half an hour, by which time the tea is just cool enough to drink. Which also takes half an hour, by which point it&#39;s time to empty the bladder. Which involves passing the kettle, and getting another brew on the go.<br><br>Yes, I take my tea seriously. I&#39;m a Yorkshirewoman, what do you expect?<br><br>In other people&#39;s houses it&#39;s a pint mug, brewed for the length of time it takes to smoke a cigarette. No sugar. Biscuits may be the ginger nut or the chocolate suggestive, though cake is an acceptable alternative. Ideal biscuit accompaniment is the fruit shortcake. Tailors are required for special occasions, but for day-to-day consumption, a hand-made cigarette is necessary with every cuppa.<br><br>Also, you can&#39;t beat a cuppa and a smoke in the bath.</p>

Finally, screwing down the entire thing as tight as you can unless you like boiling water flying at your eyeballs.<br><br>THEN, once that&#39;s done, you put three spoonfuls (three and a half for me) of sugar into the metal cup, and when the coffee is up, just put the slightest bit in. Then, whip it up so until it&#39;s at the approximate consistency of a milkshake. After that is done, pour the coffee in to get the espuma.<br><br>Then, and only then, do you have the perfect cafecito.</p>

            <p>Earl Grey is my preferred black tea, although I am a heretic who takes it with milk rather than lemon.  (I can&#39;t stand lemon in tea.)

            <p>... but I just can&#39;t bring myself to drink tea. Any kind - black, green, white, herbal, fruit, whatever. No thanks.<br><br>Or coffee. Makes my consciousness-rollercoaster even worse.

            <p>I just don&#39;t particularly like hot drinks very much. I&#39;ll make an exception for a deliciously chocolately hot chocolate now and again, and if circumstances really require it I&#39;ll take a coffee loaded with sugar, but tea... just no.

            <p>If I&#39;m in a coffee shop with my mum and brother I&#39;ll usually have a hot chocolate with all the trimmings, except for one place I go to that does gorgeous white/milk/dark chocolate with strawberry/banana/orange milkshakes. I like going there because you get a free chocolate with every drink, and because my mum doesn&#39;t eat chocolate I get hers as well since my brother is a grumpy, lazy git who finds a table as soon as and sits down so doesn&#39;t get a say in things. I&#39;ll sometimes have a milkshake at the Thornton&#39;s Cafe as well, since theirs are made with ice cream.<br><br>There are several places here that do wonderful milkshakes, the sort where you pick a sweet or chocolate bar and it gets blended into your drink. Bounties and Daims are my usual choice there, although I did have a Crunchie one from the Italian ice cream place today.<br><br>At home I drink lemonade, and very rarely anything else. I keep a two litre bottle next to my keyboard at all times. For variety I tend to have at least one can of Ting fizzy grapefruit juice hidden somewhere, and a few bottles of Oasis, water and Sprite of varying levels of fullness. There is alcohol hidden somewhere, but I only touch that very rarely.<br><br>When eating out, usually in the food court, it depends on which vendor I&#39;ve ended up at. Apple juice, J2O and water are my usual choices. If we&#39;ve just gotten a drink from the shop then I&#39;ll have water, Sprite or Oasis, which is how they end up in my room half-drunk and destined to be forgotten about. When at Costco, where the choice is free coffee or free orange juice, I&#39;ll always pick the orange juice. <br><br>I haven&#39;t had a hot blackcurrant drink in <i>ages</i>. I might have to see if there&#39;s any squash in the house so I can make some tonight.<br><br>Wow, this reply seems to have turned into a bit of an essay.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve never encountered a place that does chocolate bars blended into drinks... I think I&#39;m slightly envious now ;) It sounds heavenly.<br>I&#39;m mostly a water drinker - I only drink soft drinks or hot chocolate when I&#39;m eating out. Occasionally orange juice, but it&#39;s usually that really cheap stuff that you make up from the powder, that doesn&#39;t really taste like proper orange juice at all. Other than that, I could not live without my hot blackcurrant *coughs* Sad, I know.</p>

            <p>Honestly, I can&#39;t stand the taste of white tea; I&#39;ve tried different fruit blends with the stuff, but anything that starts with white tea just doesn&#39;t do it for me.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I wouldn&#39;t fancy it by itself. With strawberry it&#39;s alright though. And handy for when we run out of milk, because I won&#39;t drink black tea (as in milkless). I&#39;ve seen what it does to my cup, I don&#39;t want to think how fast it&#39;d make my teeth brown.</p>

            <p>Each one is a little different, but the basic idea is spiced black tea with milk and sugar. You can drink it straight, but it&#39;s just not the done thing in this case. The sugar brings out the flavor of the spices, so that&#39;s important.<br><br>Most chais include some combination of cinnamon, clove, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, cardamom, and/or anise. Some are more complex, some more simple. I prefer the ones without anise, but if you like that sort of thing, it&#39;s up to you. {= ) They come in teabags, as a powder, or as a concentrate. I like all kinds of leaf chai, but I prefer Oregon Chai as a powder and Tazo Chai as a concentrate. If you get concentrated Tazo, though, I warn you that they take the &quot;spice&quot; part seriously. You really, really want to make sure you get the balance of milk right so as not to hurt your throat. Believe me, I&#39;ve done it. Their ginger is really potent.<br><br>I hope you try some chai soon, and enjoy it. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Personally, I prefer the concentrate of Oregon Chai&#39;s vanilla chai. If you want to add a little bit more...well, flavour, I guess, I also suggest trying it with soy milk. It takes some getting used to, but after a while you get kinda hooked. ^_^</p>

            <p>It depends, of course, upon the time of day, the amount of sleep I have had, the mood I am in, and what it is I am trying to achieve by drinking tea. <br><br>As a general rule, Chai is my favorite, with good cream (none of this 2% milk stuff) and lots of sugar. It is good on just about any occasion, particularly when I can get ahold of really good Chai. After one particularly horrendous night of finishing my portfolio for this passed quarter, my study partner introduced me to what is called a &#39;Dirty Chai&#39;, which is good Chai tea with a shot of espresso in it. <br><br>For other things, I am very much partial to mint as a rule, particularly chilled peppermint tea. Also, Yogi has a beautiful tea that is Egyptian Licorice and Peppermint, which is something akin to heaven for me. Instant calm and goodbye to any headaches. <br><br>Russian Caravan is one of my favorites when it comes to black tea. It&#39;s this lovely strong black tea with a very smoky flavor to it, and always makes me think of the description of Trader Tea out of Tamora Pierce&#39;s Circle of Magic books, if any here know of them. It&#39;s wonderful when trying to stay awake for homework/being awake for class the next morning after a homework spree. I bought a pound of it this past year, and it served me well. I was brewing it by the gallon in strength so as to be nearly black. My friends called it Crack Tea....<br><br>A nice subtle Ocha (green tea- the kind you get in a sushi restaurant) is nice for being calm and writing surrealist stuff. It also wakes me up, but doesn&#39;t give me the Burst-o&#39;-Caffeine that Caravan does. I used to get a cup of Ocha every morning while waiting for the bus when I had Karate at nine in the morning. <br><br>As an afternoon pick-me-up/cool-me-down, or as a nice comfort when sick, either Tazo Passion or Celestial Seasonings Cranberry-Apple Zinger are WONDERFUL. The first is Passion-fruit flavored, the second, well, that&#39;s rather obvious, isn&#39;t it? <br><br>*stares at what she wrote* <br><br>Okay, that was a lot of writing. I&#39;ll just post this now... </p>

            <p>Hi and welcome, by the way. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve talked yet. {= )<br><br>Anyway, my preference depends on the day, the time, where I am, who I&#39;m with, and a host of other things. There are a few teas that I will hardly ever refuse, though. One is chai. I&#39;m a bit of a chai connoisseur in that I&#39;ve had many kinds, and I can almost tell you what spices are in a particular one. The ones I know by taste or smell, anyway. Usually I like chai as a breakfast or after-dinner tea.<br><br>Another tea I will almost always drink is Earl Grey any way you care to make it. I like it straight black, and I like it with milk and a little sugar. It&#39;s good for waking up in the morning, with food, with dessert, and when I just need to smell bergamot to feel better about life.<br><br>Green tea is good with just about everything if I can&#39;t think of anything better.<br><br>As for black teas, I admit I don&#39;t really know the difference between most of the varieties, but I believe I like English Breakfast and Darjeeling.<br><br>I also like Oolong tea.<br><br>... I just plain like tea. I wrote an article about tea for a little publication at my college which I&#39;d be happy to share, if people are interested.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

The first one will have far, far, far too many egg jokes because of this guy: <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Exeggcute"><a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Exeggcute">http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Exeggcute</a></a></p>

            <p>So, in honor of my exceedingly stupid decision today to take on a 17 mile bikeride after having only biked 9 miles TOTAL in the last month, who here is a fan of the Two Wheeled Horse? <br><br>I myself am a rather avid cyclist when I get the chance (See above. A good eight miles of it was into the wind, no less, and with a semi-broken gearshift), but occasionally forget that I own a bike for long periods of time. Of course, then it comes back to me, and I do things that will leave me hurting for days, often feeling like I&#39;ve been on the receiving end of some very bad slash due to the fact of living several miles away from the nearest paved road, but that&#39;s okay. It&#39;s worth the pain... <br><br>Anyone else? Any interesting mishaps to report? Fun scars? Strange things passed while on your bike? Anything? </p>

            <p>O.o....<br><br>That reminds me of the (first) time my dad attempted to teach me to ride. <br><br>We live at the top of a very steep hill. <br><br>He gave little, eight year old me a bike made for a grown-up, strapped me all up with helmet, knee- and elbow-pads, and pushed me down the hill. <br><br>My bike and myself ended up in a ditch filled with rose bushes at the bottom of the hill. He then got angry because I hadn&#39;t stayed out of the ditch. My bike ended up being left in the ditch until I went back and got it three days later. <br><br>Four years later I taught myself to ride, rather than letting him teach me.... <br><br>My mother still to this day refuses to ride a bike, due to an almost exact occurrence in her childhood.

At the time we were constructing a shed, so both parents and an uncle were in the yard to keep an eye on me.  Our backyard is situated on a hill, a perfect way to learn to control your bike as your gaining speed.  Well, I went down the hill and fell straight into a horseshow spike.  I fell onto it and bruised the inside of my thigh and got my ankle caught in the bike chain.<br><br>2nd Accident<br><br>This was several years later.  I was out riding with one of my sisters around the block in our neighborhood.  We had to go in since I was going to a sleepover with a friend that night.  We figured one more time around the block wouldn&#39;t hurt, but we agreed to turn it into a race.  The way it would work was that we would start in the same spot but we would go in different directions.  We made it to the far corner at the same time and were trying to turn the corner at the same time.  Unfortunately, we both decided to go the same way when we turned.  My front wheel met her back wheel and while she went down, I went over the handlebars.  I scrapped up both my knees and elbows.  The only thing she got was a small bump on the head, despite wearing a helmet.<br><br>1 Near Mishap<br><br>You always hear about people who run over animals in their car.  Well, I had the distinct pleasure of almost running over an animal while on my bike.  I saw it just in enough time to stop before I hit the chipmunk.  When I looked down, there was probably a few centimeters between my front tire and the chipmunk.<br><br>Those few incidents were enough to teach me to be a lot more careful on my bike.</p>

            <p>Actually, I can&#39;t, but I love my bike anyway. It is blue.<br><br>Hm...favorite bike story? When I was first learning to ride, I had training wheels and no matter how much my parents tried to convince me, I refused to take &#39;em off. So one day my mom &quot;accidentally&quot; ran over them in her van, and with no help whatsoever I took &#39;em off, hopped on, and started pedaling around.<br><br>And then there&#39;s the time I almost fell off a cliff my first time riding my current bike...went over a rock weird, got thrown, and was semi-dangling and flipping out a bit until my brother came to pull me up.

            <p>I love cycling, but am far too good at getting bikes nicked, so haven&#39;t had one in years. Longest journey by bike was to the seaside - the railway line from here to the various towns on the east coast was taken out decades ago, and is now a cycle track. Thirteen miles to Hornsea. My arse didn&#39;t half hurt afterwards, and it was a hot and sweaty day so we were all covered in thunderbugs (what they&#39;re really called, I don&#39;t know). And then there was ice cream. Fun times.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m hoping to assemble a PPC fanmix, burn a few CDs and bring them to the next Gathering - speaking of which, is the first week in September good for everyone?<br><br>Anyway, need help assembling the music. I figure the Men in Black theme tune would work. The Decemberists&#39; &quot;The Tain&quot; would work as the PPC Emergencies theme song - it&#39;s eighteen minutes of pure unadulterated awesome, including the wonderful threat to &quot;bleed your heart through a samovar soon&quot; (a samovar being a type of Russian kettle, as far as I can tell). Pink Floyd&#39;s &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; would be a good Bleeproducts advertising tune. Any more?</p>

            <p>The idea was a soundtrack for a PPC mission using (almost) all-soundtrack music, especially from popular continua. I only have ten so far:<br><br>1. Prologue - John Williams - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone [Welcome to HQ]<br>2. Concerning Hobbits - Howard Shore - LotR:FotR [Meet the Agents]<br>3. The World - See-Saw - .hack//Sign Original Soundtrack [The World - things aren&#39;t well with it]<br>4. The Knight Bus - John Williams - Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban [The console goes off! It&#39;s a mission!]<br>5. To Lands Unknown - Sleepy Emp - Chrono Symphonic [Off into the Word World]<br>6. Go on Through - Afro-Celt Sound System - Further in Time [Enduring the badfic]<br>7. Rock Anthem for Saving the World - Martin O&#39;Donnel, Michael Salvatori - Halo Original Soundtrack [Moving in for the kill]<br>8. Listen Here - Eddie Harris - House M.D. Non-Album Tracks Vol. 2 [Reading the charge list]<br>9. Robinton&#39;s Whistle Tune II - Mike Freeman &amp; Tania Opland - Masterharper of Pern [Triumph! Celebrate!]<br>10. &quot;Aslan&#39;s Theme&quot; - from WonderWorks&#39; Chronicles of Narnia made-for-TV series [A sense of satisfaction and that all is well. Coda to track 4. Repeat.]<br><br>I think the only one not affiliated with a canon is the Afro-Celt Sound System one. The title and lyrics are appropriate, though.<br><br>What I feel this mix lacks right now is something to accompany the kill itself. It should be percussive and upbeat without being too loud, fairly short, and I&#39;ve preferred mostly instrumental works with a few exceptions. Any suggestions?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I mean, I might be a shameless Cowboy Bebop fan, but either of them would fit for our main theme pretty much perfectly. We could even slightly PPC-ify the latter&#39;s lyrics. &quot;I ain&#39;t &#39;fraid of no Sue...&quot; For Emergencies, March of Cambreadth would work for the Agents&#39; mindsets. &quot;Guard your women and children well, send these bastards back to hell! We&#39;ll teach them the ways of war, they won&#39;t come here any more! Close your mind to stress and pain, fight till you&#39;re no longer sane... let not one damn cur pass by! HOW MANY OF THEM CAN WE MAKE DIE?!&quot;<br><br>Not sure exactly where we&#39;d fit it, but I&#39;d be fond of using The Battle Cry of Freedom if we could find a spot for it. For some reason, I can see &quot;Don&#39;t you forget about me&quot; as the song for retiring/recently deceased Agents. Maybe I&#39;m just in a weird mood. New recruit theme could be the main Morrowind theme, it&#39;s always given me the feeling of discovering a new &#39;verse, with all sorts of unexpected challenges and experiences ahead of you. And another weird one from me- the Yarrow&#39;s plans to infect the PPC with Macroviruses set to &quot;Be Prepared&quot;.<br><br>That&#39;s all I can think about music-wise for now, but I&#39;ll post here with other ideas as I think of them. With the September thing, I&#39;ll see if it&#39;s possible. Not entirely sure.</p>

            <p>Oooh, I like. I&#39;ll have to use this on a few friends. Thankfully most of my Uni friends are (almost) as great of Tea Fiends as I am, so the call of &quot;Who want&#39;s to go to Az&#39;s place and have tea?&quot; in a crowded room almost always elicits at gathering in my home and at least one strange combination. I think the most interesting thusfar has been Russian Caravan tea (really strong smoky black tea) and Anise Extract. It actually turned out quite good.... </p>
