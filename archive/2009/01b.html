            <p>So, yes, it appears that sometime this year a sequel musical to <i>Phantom of the Opera</i>, set on Brooklyn&#39;s Coney Island, will be opening.

            <p>I don&#39;t care if Andrew LLoyd Webber is composing; stories have a beginning, middle, and end, and if you try to change that, you&#39;d have to to a DAMN good job to keep from spoiling the tragic poignance of the original. This is how <i>The Matrix</i> died and what soured <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>. You&#39;d think they&#39;d have NOTICED by now.<br><br>Idiots.</p>

            <p>Specifically, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women_(musical)">Little Women: The Musical</a> and <a href="http://www.littlewomenmusical.com/">Little Women: A Little Musical</a>?<br><br>The former is somewhat older and quite a lot better known, having run on Broadway, but it is the latter of which I&#39;d like to speak.<br><br>Three years ago tonight, due to a class I was taking at Utah State University, I was assigned to see and amateur-review a local community theater production. So impressed was I that on the way out I bought a copy of the soundtrack. I was a little disappointed, for reasons I&#39;ll get to in a moment.<br><br>This &quot;Little Musical&quot; covers about half of the book; I don&#39;t remember exactly, but it ends sometime between Beth&#39;s funeral and Jo&#39;s (re)departure for New York. (Certain events were changed or put in different orders; Jo never went to New York the first time in this version.) As I discovered when I encountered the Broadway musical, many of the songs are at the same points of the story. But one song, one I really liked, is missing from the soundtrack. It is the equivalent to &quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot;; Laurie is telling Jo that he thinks Meg has fallen in love with his tutor, and she retorts that &quot;Love Doesn&#39;t Happen That Way&quot;. It&#39;s a great, funny song, and is reprised when Laurie proposes at Beth&#39;s funeral. But it doesn&#39;t appear even once on my soundtrack, so I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s some way I could get ahold of a (legitimate) recording thereof.<br><br>The website offers a perusal score, which would presumably include it but would have no sound; it also offers the original soundtrack recording, probably the one I have, and a premier DVD. I don&#39;t really want to spend fifty dollars on a DVD of totally unknown quality, especially when I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s cut to remove the very part I want. Does anyone have knowledge of that?</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t really form much of an opinion. The sunsets were really nice, and the winter was cold, and that was about it. I spent most of my time in the computer labs instead of going to class, as a result of having discovered the PPC, <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/milliways_bar">Milliways</a>, and Wikipedia, as well as half a host of lesser distractions, in the span of a few months.<br><br>I don&#39;t know about the choral program, much.

            <p>The New Alpha I&#39;ve seen, but as it&#39;s only got the prologue up so far, not nearly enough for a mission, I contented myself with dumping a steaming pile of concrit into the reviews.

            <p>Fighting badfic, especially graphic badfic, has been described multiple times as being a very sanity-challenging job - see Agent Len&#39;s episode with the flamethrower. While it&#39;s certainly possible that an agent has been around for a very long time, and it&#39;s also possible that he&#39;s pretty much numb to the effects of graphic badfic, there&#39;s really no way he can manage to have both of those and still be a normal person. I would suggest that Agent Mulhoon should have some (or several) psychosises, neurosies, pet peeves that whip him into a killing frenzy, and so on, both to be more reasonable and to be more entertaining. It&#39;s a lot more fun to read a PPCing where the agents actually react to the fic, after all.<br><br>Either that or you could have him be a robot, but that should probably be stated explicitly.<br><br>Your writing is quite good, but Agent Mulhoon comes across as more than a bit of a Marty Stu - and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Jaycacia_Thornbyrd">that&#39;s not a good thing</a>.<br></p>

            <p>Certainly he&#39;s not meant to be perfect. He&#39;s as competant as any agent, and the fact that he&#39;s less prone to insanity or homicidal rage doesn&#39;t mean he has an easy job. It&#39;s not going to be &quot;Mulhoon turns up, everything fixes itself&quot; like it was with Jaycacia.

            <p>The first mission is easy, and the second usually fairly straightforward, but trust me when I say that if your agents don&#39;t have enough texture, it gets really hard to be creative when you&#39;ve reached your third or fourth mission. <br><br>That said, am not a PG, so take this as friendly advice.</p>

            <p>Most of the time, characters need to grow and develop in order to be interesting. Personality quirks make them entertaining, which is also important for this kind of writing, but it&#39;s their development as people that makes readers care about them.<br><br>At least, that&#39;s the theory. And also the basis from which I&#39;m working with my own pair of agents, though the growth only really applies to one of them (the other just has not-blatantly-touted secrets) and has only begun in earnest with the end of their third mission.

            <p>Render will definitely be undergoing character growth, at least if I&#39;m a good enough writer to pull it off. I&#39;m good with the technical use of the English language, but I&#39;m no good at making plots. I figured PPC would be fairly easy to do because the basic plot&#39;s already tere - console goes off at importune time, go into badfic, suffer through bafic, deal with badfic, get home, deal with any minis, play with any collected shinies, console goes off again.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure how much character development is possible for Mulhoon, as I&#39;m pretty sure the reason for his personality is because he has the approximate emotional capacity of a teaspoon. He doesn&#39;t particularly do sadness, happiness, worry, disgust, just mild annoyance. While intellectually he understands the effect emotions have on other people, he doesn&#39;t get them himself. I&#39;m a bit like that, though not nearly to the same extent, and I&#39;ve spent the last ten years actively trying to learn emotions. He just doesn&#39;t care that much.<br><br>~Heliomance, who would be asking for Permission if he&#39;d been here long enough, but is contenting himself with getting the formalities out of the way.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s one thing to say and plan for a character to grow, and quite another to make it actually happen. That said, PPC misison plots can be somewhat differentiated from the character arcs of the agents, which span all of your writing. Let the necessities of each mission grow and let your agents do their own thing.<br><br>I think you&#39;re running a risk starting with a character who has &quot;the emotional capacity of a teaspoon&quot;. It&#39;ll certainly be interesting and fun to have him be unknowingly harsh and cause spats by casual carelessness, but after a while, I imagine you&#39;re going to have to have him start developing emotional reactions, otherwise he will simply get dull. Ther could be a great deal of fun in having him struggle to deal with basic feelings.<br><br>That said, at the end of the day it all boils down to the writing.

            <p>*goes into obligatory Copypasta Captain Exposition mode* It increases stats (in an RPG sense), may or may not come with complimentary Prinny bombs and a pair of swords, and makes you say &quot;-dood&quot; at the end of every sentence. It makes people explode when thrown, but that&#39;s... usually... only a problem in NIS videogame canons and similar games. Basically, games where people can be tossed around anytime, by anyone. (It&#39;s amusing to see the biggest normal enemies being carried by the smallest creatable characters in Disgaea, where the suits are from. Testing on the Final Final Boss, Baal, has not been attempted yet.) Welcome to the Board, person who is... err... <i>most definitely not</i> under duress.</p>

            <p>The quintessential missions would be Meg Thornton&#39;s <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/791153/1/">Tales from Despatch</a>, which I really ought to re-read myself.<br><br><a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999.html">Then there&#39;s me</a>.

            <p>This requires a little background. I work at a movie theatre, and kitsune106 asked me in email if we were allowed to see movies for free. We are, and we&#39;re allowed to bring a guest if we sign them in. I told him I&#39;d offer to take him, but a free movie wouldn&#39;t be worth an eight-hour flight to get across the Atlantic. He said it depends on the movie, so I wondered what kind of movie would be worth flying eight hours (and another eight hours back, if we&#39;re talking from the UK to the US) to see, even if getting into the actual movie is free. (For perspective, tickets for a round-trip on a plane can cost upwards of four hundred UK pounds each, not sure what that is in dollars.) I thought this would make a fun Board discussion.<br><br>A sample answer from me: First, there would have to be a legitimate reason I couldn&#39;t see it in the UK, or would miss out on something by doing so. Maybe to go see a really big premiere. Second, a bunch of other PPCers and various other friends would have to be there, and we&#39;d have to be at a private screening or in a soundproof VIP box so we could squee and joke around if we wanted. As for the actual movie:<br>- Based very faithfully on a story co-written by Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman, and JK Rowling.<br>- Co-directed by Peter Jackson and Tim Burton.<br>- Starring Johnny Depp.<br>- CGI animals and monsters done by the same people who made the Talking Beasts for the recent Narnia films.<br>- And it should be a musical. A good one.<br>- We can get onto what it&#39;s actually about later.<br><br>So, anyone want to piece together their ideal movie? Directors, actors, special effects, soundtrack and plot suggestions?</p>

            <p>One being far more realistic than the other. <br><br>This doesn&#39;t technically count, as it&#39;s a play, not a movie, but I&#39;d fly international to see a performance of <i>Wicked</i> with the best cast combination - Idina or Stephanie, Norbert, Kristin, and Michelle Federer or Jenna Leigh Green (and yes, I&#39;m aware that those names will mean absolutely nothing to most of you, but they are more or less the original Broadway cast, and they&#39;re GOOD). It&#39;s highly unlikely that my ideal cast will ever perform again, let alone together, but I&#39;d pay a fortune to see that play, if only I had a fortune to spend.<br><br>As for the non-existant movie... oooh. Activating Inner Fangirl...<br><br>- Fantasy, definitely. NOT set on Earth, and no trying to draw parallels to real life issues; pure escapism.<br>- A not-so-simple good vs. evil conflict in which we can see from everybody&#39;s point of view, but not in a way that makes me feel bad when the villian is killed.<br>- lighthearted, with witty dialogue, a non-sappy romance and snappy action scenes that do NOT drag out too long<br>- Tim Burton&#39;s art direction, with elaborate costumes to match<br>- Johnny Depp, because he can play ANYTHING and make it great<br>- while we&#39;re at it, Helena Bonham Carter, because if you have Burton and Depp, you have to have her. She&#39;s great. <br>- subtle CGI (Weta is good) that tells the story and doesn&#39;t linger showing off how good technology has become<br>- music that wraps itself around my heart unti, I have to sing or dance or play it for the next two months. Either vocal or instrumental. Alan Menken or Stephen Schwartz, maybe. <br>- and... I can&#39;t think of more just now. Nice thread; thanks!</p>

            <p>It would be co-directed by Peter Jackson, Tim Burton, <i>and</i> Guillermo del Toro, Johnny Depp would definitely star as Sexy Evil Overlord (he would look <i>truly</i> fine in spiky black armor), it would be so gothic tiny vampire bats fly out of the screen, the fight scenes would be a hybrid of &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; and LotR, there would be pyrotechnics galore, and there would be fun and Eeevil songs to sing along to. It would also have to be something that could have fangs worn to its premiere (which goes along with the tiny bats), Enya would be on the soundtrack, it would take place in a variety of locations including mountains, deserts, underwater, and creepy Mayan temples, there would be undead somewhere in there...*takes deep breath* Um, I agree with you about the CGI. *collapses from lack of oxygen*</p>

If the Toa are capable of wearing the mask without being corrupted themselves (which seems to be what you&#39;re describing), there shouldn&#39;t be any real danger to using it... It&#39;s more of a question of character, really.</p>

            <p>Kgarrett, Sara and I are doing a group mission that involves a First Person POTC Sue. We couldn&#39;t find a method of killing the Sue that wouldn&#39;t damage the dummy, so we&#39;ve opted for using a piece of PPC tech.<br><br>As far as we could establish, a DOGA CAD alters tense and POV for the Agents using it, and my Agents happened to lay hands on one just before their latest mission, so they&#39;ll be taking that into the group mission.

            <p>Well, I&#39;ve began a new story, and as part on my growing trend to shy away from crossovers, It is, like the title says, based on the 2007 Trnaformers movie, with only minimal input from the upcoming sequel (what I&#39;ve heard is leading me to beleive that it&#39;ll be too cheesey even for me).<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4695216/1/Transformers_Starscream_Ascendant"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4695216/1/Transformers_Starscream_Ascendant">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4695216/1/Transformers_Starscream_Ascendant</a></a><br><br>However, I admit that it did start as a reaction to another story set in the same canon and it does contain some common elements: Miles, a pregnant chick, and Starscream.  But from there it diverts radically.  <br><br>In the other fic, Miles (a fourth-tier character from the movie) only meets the pregnant chick and worries for her conditon; in mine, he&#39;s responsible for it.  In the other story, the Autobots settle on earth and take US Citizenship: in mine, they just cannot bring themselves to even humour the idea that they may here to stay, never to venture back to the stars or to rebuild their homeworld.<br><br>It is here that another chance is found, and when found by Starscream and the rest of the Nemesis&#39; crew (the &quot;disgraced&quot; Barricade, the scientist, the intellectual, the medics and &quot;the insufficently loyal&quot; that Blackout left behind when his team went to Earth), Starscream does the unimaginable... <br><br>But that would be spoilers, wouldn&#39;t it? </p>

            <p>I need betas for three fics, so far all fairly short.<br><br><i>28 Seconds Later:</i> A <i>28 Days Later</i> oneshot. Five pages. Confusingly, it has two chapters, one being simply the original, unfinished version of the story (three pages) that I’m including because I want to see what people think of it.<br><br><i>Harry Potter and the Mouth of Hell: </i> A <i>Harry Potter</i>/<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> crossover. A mere two pages of prologue that won’t be commented on again for fifty thousand chapters, but it was the best fic opener out of the many ideas that have flashed through my head for it. Also searching desperately for a slightly better title (and prologue subtitle, I suppose).<br><br><i>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2: Liberty’s Cage: </i> A <i>Red Alert 2</i> game novelisation where I’ve screwed with Canon (though it was clearly asking for it :P) slightly to explain some weird gaps in logic. Two pages (one page of which is annoying author note. I’m not all that happy about it, but most of it was going to have to go in at some point or another, so why not at the beginning?) and also looking for a better title (“Liberty’s Cage” meant something, but I can’t remember what).<br><br>I’d obviously prefer someone with knowledge of any and all Canons, but anyone will honestly do. Especially for <i>LC</i> and <i>MoH</i>, which I’m trying to make accessible to people who have no knowledge of <i>HP</i>, <i>BtVS</i> or <i>RA</i>. For that, I’d obviously need your continual services (at least normally reading the thing). For <i>MoH</i>, I’ll seriously, seriously need help to write a song for Harry during ‘Once More With Feeling’, but fortunately that won’t occur for a long time.<br><br>Thanks in advance and my e-mail address is the<em>jade</em><a href="mailto:falcon@hotmail.co.uk">falcon@hotmail.co.uk</a>.</p>

            <p>Remembering that missions are written to amuse, it&#39;s far more interesting to see a non-powered Agent have to come up with a trick to do the job, than for Jaycacia Thornbyrd to wave a hand and wipe everyone out.

            <p>I think a disguise generator generates a disguise, i.e. just the physical appearance of the agent changes. The agents do not become the species that they look like (unless they already are that species). Actually, a female agent disguising as a male of the same species will still not be able to find out what the big deal is about peeing standing up.<br><br>I like that limitation of the device. If the device could give the agent any power they&#39;d like from the fandom they were in, the device might better be renamed the Mary Sue generator. As that is what Sues do: they take on the powers of the fandom they like, and then some.<br><br>Which is not to say that agents have not taken over some of the minor powers of their species of disguise. I once disguised my agents as fairies from Torchwood, wings included, with which they managed to fly. That is if your definition of flying is falling down and occasionally missing the ground. (so they got the power, but couldn&#39;t control it. Ah, conflict)<br><br>Anyway, I guess if an agent disguised as a shapeshifter they&#39;d probably be changing appearance throughout the story. And knowing how PPC equipment works, they&#39;d be changing appearance at random, and quite often at inconvenient times.<br>Would that work for your story?</p>

            <p>about the potential for abuse.

That gives me an interesting idea...<br><br>The Agent tries shifting to a rancor to eat the Sue. It fails spectacularly, and the Agent instead collapses into a puddle of black goo.

            <p>In the end, it comes down to this question IC: do the Agents&#39; actions create plotholes? If not, there&#39;s no reason for the Sues to mind.

            <p>The PPC&#39;s tools are really the only reason the majority of agents are able to accomplish their task at all, given that they tend to be fairly average human teenagers. As Protectors of the Plot Continuum, it is their responsibility to see that they don&#39;t abuse such powerful tools as the disguise generator even as they take advantage of them in order to remove the Sue. I think Legal is willing to overlook a few things as long as the Sue is duly stalked, captured, charged, etc., but if you&#39;re going to eat a Sue, be sure that there will be side effects once you&#39;ve reverted back to your normal form.<br><br>If it helps, I described the effect of the disguise generator as creating an overlapping morphic field around the agent. It doesn&#39;t exactly change your nature like shape-shifting or morphing does, but you do physically become the disguise for all intents and purposes.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not personally a big fan of that trick, to be honest. However, I think it&#39;s possible to make an argument for how it could work. One possibility is that a disguise generator hooked up to a TARDIS has enough oomph to enact a permanent change on the subject&#39;s own morphic field. Another is that a Time Lord&#39;s regeneration is powerful enough in itself that it can extend beyond the morphic field of the disguise to include that of the subject. Someone could probably come up with more possibilities.<br><br>Anyway, my explanation of disguises is just my explanation. It&#39;s not The Way Things Are unless everyone decides it it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>
