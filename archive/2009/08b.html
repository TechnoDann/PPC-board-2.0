            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure there was a KH fanfiction university at one point that used human minis (or whatever a given character was) with different hair and eye colors. Admittedly they ended up as more like children than Munchkins, but still, actual mini-characters.</p>

            <p>Hey, You Just Got To See This, <br><br>Listen, if you&#39;re looking for a simple way to generate income online, then<br>you need to see this. <br><br>There&#39;s something new - a new form of Niche Marketing  called Niche<br>Marketing 2.0 that&#39;s being secretly used by a handful of guys in the deep<br>inner circles of the Internet marketing elite..<br><br>And man o man, they&#39;ve been literally *killing* it with  this new method, and<br>no one had a clue what was going on. <br><br>Until now... <br><br>Two of the most successful Niche Marketers out there - Adam Short, and <br>Alen Sultanic - who regularly generate 5 figures per month online from their<br>&quot;part-time&quot; niche businesses, broke the silence and revealed this new method <br>right out, plus put their own twist on it that puts it on *steroids.* <br><br>Heck, they should call this Niche Marketing 10.0, because it&#39;s light years ahead<br>of anything else out there. <br><br>Ok lets cut to the chase now.<br><br>Hop over to [<a href="https://imi.infusionsoft.com/go/npc/a11319"><a href="https://imi.infusionsoft.com/go/npc/a11319">https://imi.infusionsoft.com/go/npc/a11319</a></a>] to get all the  juicy details on Niche Marketing 2.0 and check it out. <br><br>But listen, before you go over there and see for yourself, I want to tell you the *best* part about Niche Profit Classroom. <br><br>The best part, absolutely the best (and you&#39;ll see for yourself), is that Niche Profit Classroom is a new type of hybrid site. It has over 400+ hours of videos to show you everything step by step in the most microscopic detail.<br><br>It has software built right into the site so you can put some serious fire power <br>behind everything you learn.<br><br>But best of all, it has a built in community that&#39;s *always* there for you when <br>you need help to steer you in the right direction.<br><br>This is the TOP reason 99% of people fail to generate income online, because <br>they get everything from 100&#39;s of different sources rather than finding one good<br>system that works. Then, even if they do find a good system, they don&#39;t have anyone there to help answer their questions (and there are bound to be some).<br><br>But at Niche Profit Classroom, the entire site is laser-focused on helping  you succeed.  All of the software and tools were built to help you reach your goals fast.<br><br>Anyhow, don&#39;t take my word for it (I expect you to make your own judgments  <br>on what&#39;s good and what&#39;s not, I can only point you in the right direction). <br><br>Check it out <a href="https://imi.infusionsoft.com/go/npc/a11319"><a href="https://imi.infusionsoft.com/go/npc/a11319">https://imi.infusionsoft.com/go/npc/a11319</a></a><br><br>All the best,And <br>To YOUR Success roysumme</p>

            <p>I’ve got a character in a story for <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</i> who I’ve given amnesia to solve ten thousand issues with the pre-game story. This has the unfortunate side effects of a) having no name, making me constantly call her ‘she’ for the first and second chapters minimum (hey, it’s better than the first-person present tense prologue) and b) causing this scene to make me tear my hair out. After six rewrites, I still can’t get it right. Basically, she woke up in the Imperial City prison with no memory of who she is or what she did (and yes, it’s the later Champion of Cyrodil). She’s called a guard to get help for her, but no matter how I write this scene, I can’t think of any ways to get it more… well, interesting and realistic would be good. The guard is practically a plot device/mild exposition guy and I can’t really disguise that fact. He never appears again barring once later (later) scene where he re-encounters her long after she’s escaped from the prison and fills in a bit more of the amnesia checklist. Can anyone come up with any advice for me to rewrite this scene well? Or is it actually good as it is? If you think I could use a bit more description of some things, be aware that this is a flashback, so I’ve already described quite a bit already, but in case I haven’t, tell me anyway.<br><br>X<br><br>“All right, all right, I’m here,” the guard said, annoyed at being disturbed. “What is it?”<br><br>She leapt to her feet and promptly hit her head on the ceiling, only now realising how small the room was. She yelped in pain, a headache forming on the spot, but tried to ignore it as best as she could. “Please, I need to see a doctor,” she pleaded.<br><br>The guard frowned and looked her over. “Why? I can’t see anything wrong with you.”<br><br>“I…” She hesitated, afraid that he wouldn’t believe her.<br><br>“Out with it!” the guard snapped. “If you don’t tell me, you don’t get a doctor even if you do need one.”<br><br>“I can’t remember who I am,” she admitted. “I don’t remember anything. I don’t remember committing any crime, I don’t remember my life, I don’t even remember my name.” She paused and looked at him. “Do… do you know it?”<br><br>“I only arrived from Anvil this morning,” the guard said, frowning. “I don’t know what you did or who you are and, frankly, I couldn’t care less. You’re all scum if you’re in here.”<br><br>“But I didn’t do anything!” she protested. “Or, if I did, I don’t remember it. I just remember waking up five minutes ago. That’s it! Please, you have to help me.” She tried reaching through the bars to grip his hand for some measure of comfort from a law enforcer, but he drew back, his hand reaching for his sword instinctively.<br><br>His frown deepened and he looked into her eyes, seeing no trace of deception there. His experience, however, had taught him to always be cautious. “I’ll do some checking up on you,” he promised. “Who you are, who you stole from or killed or whatever… if I come away from that believing you, I’ll get a doctor to check you over. If whatever happened to you is curable, then you’ll do your time. If not, I would presume you can appeal against your sentence on the grounds of ‘you’ not being the same person.”<br><br>“Please,” she begged, her eyes watering. “I just want to go home… if I even have one,” she said to herself in a half-murmur. She looked up at him. “Help me.”<br><br>The guard hesitated before speaking. “Turn around. I’ll help you a bit as a promise to do more if you’re telling the truth.” She did so, not understanding his intent. After a second or so though, the guard approached her cell’s gate and put his hand through. A cooling feeling swept across her feet and the biting pain in her ankles was soothed away as they healed. She turned around, grateful, but the guard had already gone. She looked at the bars blocking her exit mournfully and returned to her bed, exploring her cell with her eyes, not wanting to actually touch anything in the grim chamber. She wondered if he would ever return despite his act of kindness. Even she could tell that it seemed like a flimsy excuse for an escape attempt and she was actually suffering from amnesia. The guard would be extremely doubtful. She wondered if she always had bad luck or if having a cautious guard come to her was just a blip in what was usually good luck. She looked around her cell again, spotting the rusty manacles hanging from a secure bolt in the ceiling. <i>Guess I know the answer,</i> she thought.<br><br>X<br><br>Well? Any ideas?<br><br>Oh, and on this note, I’m looking for a beta reader for the fic. While I would obviously prefer one familiar with <i>TES</i> lore (I’m not as familiar as I’d like to be, having entered the series with <i>Oblivion</i>), this is not a requirement in the least. I already have one <i>TES</i> fangirl helping me on that side of things (though that seem a bit of a mean thing to say, I mean it in the kindest possible sense because she’s quite wonderful (and very intelligent, too) and only gets fangirlish if I poke her by saying that BioWare can craft massively better RPGs (which they can and let no-one tell you any different either :P)). Therefore, even someone who can only help on the spelling and grammar side of things would be most appreciated (because, damn, I think I need it for the horrific prologue which, as I’ve said, is in first-person present tense). Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>It does the job of showing what happens when she wakes up in prison, which I assume is your intent. I&#39;d kind of like to follow the guard a bit now as he goes sniffing for information--it would give you a chance to explore his thoughts and his reasons for helping the main character--but if it&#39;s a flashback, maybe that doesn&#39;t work.<br><br>Also, I think you need a comma in this sentence: &quot;Even she could tell that it seemed like a flimsy excuse for an escape attempt and she was actually suffering from amnesia.&quot;<br><br>It should read: &quot;Even she could tell that it seemed like a flimsy excuse for an escape attempt, and she was actually suffering from amnesia.&quot;<br><br>Otherwise, it sounds like you&#39;re saying that she can tell she&#39;s actually suffering from amnesia, which is silly, because that&#39;s already established.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... this is sort of the continuation of that (if you want me to post the waking up, I can). I tried leading directly on from the prologue but it didn&#39;t work, so I set it a bit later and then had a flashback in dream form.<br><br>As for the comma, I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve always been taught that commas before ands were a stylistic thing and I don&#39;t do that. I&#39;ll try to reword the sentence. Thanks.<br><br>The guard wandering around I hadn&#39;t really considered as part of the story. I had pictured how he would do it, but not thought about actually showing it. She escapes in less than a day so it would be fairly moot and she&#39;ll encounter him later on one day anyway. I was thinking of having him tell her then that he couldn&#39;t find any paper trail about her at all and ooh, isn&#39;t that strange and all that stuff.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been re-reading the Discworld books lately, and a rather curious sensation keeps popping up. See, to my American eyes, the book has a distinctly British feel, as you might expect from a book written by a British writer. But sometimes, when I&#39;m reading his books, I find myself thinking, &quot;Wow, this feels very American,&quot; or &quot;Geez, he really got this bit of America down flat!&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure that part of the reason is that I&#39;ve been rereading books set in Ankh-Morpork, which is something like the horribly mutated spawn of New York and London bred together in a ghastly experiment that should never have taken place. But I can&#39;t help wonder if this feeling goes beyond that--that maybe Pterry hit upon something international that everyone around the world feels and identifies with as a member of their country.<br><br>...Not quite sure if that came out right, tell me if you need clarification.<br><br>Anyways, I was wondering if any of you guys have ever felt the same thing: &quot;Wow, he&#39;s really got (Insert Country Here) down perfectly!&quot; I know this board is international, which is one of the reasons why I&#39;m posting this question here, because I&#39;d like to hear from people outside America and Britain especially.</p>

            <p>Of course all major cities are so like each other that it isn&#39;t even funny.   A-M could be New York, or London or Madrid or Paris or Berlin or Washington or any major city.   I feel the differences between major cities are much akin to identical twins getting their hair dyed and this is why you will always see something of home in A-M</p>

            <p>My take on it, as an English reader, and bearing in mind just what he&#39;s playing off, is that Ankh-Morpork&#39;s got nothing to do with New York; rather, New York has its origins in the same city Ankh-Morpork does.<br><br>Ankh-Morpork is really nothing to do with New York. A-M is an evolved twist on London as was. But so, in fairness, is NY (or so Pterry says) - this is why so many Discworld cities have an A-M flavour while not being A-M; this is why so many Real World cities have a flavour of London. All cities, in a Platonic sense, are echoes of one city, Pterry tells us, and that city is Ankh-Morpork.<br><br>Or, if you&#39;d rather, the man&#39;s not that familiar with America or New York, but he <i>is</i> familiar with London as is and as was, and also with the tropes surrounding fantasy cities. Mix the two, and you might get something resembling New York, but it&#39;s not actually based on New York. It&#39;s more a case of reality resembling the fictitious natural progression of that city.<br><br>(He also gets a lot down pat, because the man&#39;s an excellent satirist, and there&#39;s a lot of readily available source material.)</p>

            <p>I mean, the place does have a popular song that runs &quot;Ankh-Morpork, Ankh-Morpork, So Good They Named It Ankh-Morpork&quot;, so there has to be <i>some</i> connection.

            <p>Seeing how the Daleks had this whole big war with Gallifrey, I&#39;m pretty certain they have death-rays customized for preventing Time Lord regeneration. I mean, what&#39;s the point of exterminating someone if they get back up two minutes later with a different face?<br><br>Of course, Daleks are not the most reliable of allies. Maybe if you got your hands on one of their armor-shell-things and brought it back to base, someone could reverse engineer their death ray for missions like yours.<br><br>And then there&#39;s the obvious solution: dumping them down a black hole, leaving them at ground zero seconds before an A-bomb drops--you know, anything that breaks them down to their atoms. I&#39;m pretty sure they can&#39;t regenerate from that. Of course, you might need a TARDIS to do the job.</p>

            <p>Killing them thirteen times just adds to the fun!  If you insist on killing them only once, I recommend something brutal that they couldn&#39;t possibly regenerate from.  Decapitation, ripping out both hearts, incineration, etc.  It may be hard to set up, but I doubt they could regenerate in a vacuum either.</p>

            <p>Evidence from both the Old and New Series indicate that a Time Lord can&#39;t regenerate if the death is too fast. Witness the Doctor&#39;s drowning in Turn Left, or the shooting of the Castellan in Five Doctors.<br><br>The Doctor has also been in danger of permanent death from having his brain burnt out (Forest of the Dead), and according to the <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Regeneration#Limitations">Tardis Wiki</a>, you can kill a Time Lord by stabbing both hearts simultaneously. Or you could just make them not want to regenerate (Last of the Time Lords).<br><br>To be honest, regeneration is one of the least useful aspects of Time Lord-ness. There&#39;s just so /many/ ways to stop or disrupt it; the Doctor worries about dying practically every story.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know of anything specifically relevant, but your best bet as a general rule is to consider how best to get an entertaining mission out of it. Treat it as diary format if you like, if you can make that work to make a readable mission. If that&#39;s not workable, throw some pseudobabble in to excuse it being translated to third person. It&#39;s really up to you either way, how you feel is best to deal with it. Honestly, there&#39;s a lot less Rules about than people often seem to think. Just play it by ear.</p>

            <p>Does anyone here know the Musical/film <i>Newsies</i>?<br><br>I&#39;m currently dealing with a Sue that was not content with just messing up one canon, she had to make it a crossover. She  got herself into the world of Newsies. I know absolutely nothing about said canon, other than what I can find on wikipedia. From that I&#39;ve learned there the author is largely following canon (and describing it rather unimaginatively).<br><br>What I need to know is: what were the key romance scenes in that film? There is some romance in the fic and I want to know whether that was written in there by the author, or that the Sue is taking over the part of one of the canon characters.<br><br>Most helpful would be if someone with knowledge of  <i>Newsies</i> would be willing to read (certain chapters of) the fic and confirm my suspicion of line-stealing.</p>

            <p>My favorite musical movie as a little kid. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t remember everything about the movie, but I might be able to help. I think that the only vague romantic pairing, as I remember, was between Jack Kelly and David Jacob&#39;s sister. I could read some of the story for possible line-stealing.

            <p>Yesterday I also did some websurfing and found a script for the Newsies (when I first decided to do the mission (many months ago) I had looked for a Newsies Transcript and found nothing useful). That should cover the line stealing. And it means you don&#39;t have to jeopardise your childhood memories of the musical. If you feel daring, this is the link: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4474871/8/BACKBEAT_LOVE">Backbeat Love</a> to the first chapter where Newsies appear. The Sue&#39;s name is Morgan; Jeffrey is a canon character from the other canon.<br><br>You could help me out with something else, though. In the fic and in the script, the characters say &quot;pape&quot; rather than &quot;paper&quot; and I would like to know how pape is pronounced.<br>Is it pape that rhymes with tape?<br>Or is it more like papah, and was the R dropped on paper because they didn&#39;t pronounce it?</p>

            <p>ARGH. I&#39;m terribly sorry to have to tell people this, but the karaoke bar we were thinking of going to is problematic. Their website *says* they open at 1pm on Saturdays, but apparently &quot;open&quot; does not translate to &quot;running karaoke in the public bar&quot;, even though they advertise as, y&#39;know, a karaoke bar. The DJ who runs the karaoke does not arrive until 9pm. I&#39;m sorry about this, their website misled me but it is my mistake.<br><br>On the plus side, the private booths are actually FIVE pounds per person per hour, not ten as I previously claimed - don&#39;t know where I got that number from. Worst comes to worst, if everyone still wants to go but doesn&#39;t have much spending money we can just book in for one hour. Does anyone still want to go, or should we skip it and find something else?</p>

            <p>Maybe.

            <p>... and we&#39;re likely to be able to hear ourselves over the background noise, fine. I&#39;ve never actually been in a bar for more than about five minutes at a time (I have no friends nearby who would go into one with me and being in a bar alone is about the most depressing thing ever, especially if you aren&#39;t drinking anything) so I&#39;m not familiar with how they work.</p>

            <p>They tend to be fairly quiet of an afternoon, at least during the week. Saturdays would be a bit busier but we&#39;d be afternoon, so not too bad.

            <p>I realise this is probably sacrilege in your eyes ;) but being in pubs and bars makes me uncomfortable in itself. I really don&#39;t like being in large noisy rooms full of total strangers, particularly potentially-intoxicated total strangers, without there being some purpose for me being there other than drinking stuff which I could just as easily drink at home. Then again, if there were people I *knew* there with me maybe it&#39;d be okay. I&#39;ll try it out.</p>

            <p>Not sacrilege; a fair point if you&#39;re not used to it. Afternoon pubs tend not to be full of strangers. They tend to be full of your drinking mates, and two old men and a dog. You&#39;re giving me massive urges to try all the drinking styles I know until we find one you can hack. So are you opposed to drinking on principle, then?</p>

            <p>I drink some types of wine at holiday gatherings and such, but I don&#39;t like the taste of most types of alcoholic drink, and since I drink so rarely I have no head for it on the occasions I do drink. I went over my limit by about one glass once at a Boxing Day party and wound up lying on the bathroom floor waiting for the sick feeling to go away.

I responded by saying &quot;you haven&#39;t tried the Belgians!&quot; because, well, they don&#39;t taste like beer. I shall bear in mind you&#39;ve no tolerance, but do at least try one half-pint, if we head to Ansela&#39;s bar? The stuff doesn&#39;t taste of booze, it tastes of strawberry juice.

            <p>I&#39;ve never been hungover, but I imagine it feels like the time I drank too much at a Boxing Day party. I had to go hide in the bathroom, because I did NOT feel well AT ALL. Felt fine after about ten minutes, but it wasn&#39;t fun while it was happening, and I was kinda dizzy all night. It might have been partly psychosomatic, but I drink maybe six times total in a year, so my tolerance would naturally be pretty low. I generally tell people I don&#39;t drink at all because it&#39;s easier than explaining. (Same way I explain my Aspergers&#39;-related pickiness with food to waiters when my family take me out and I ask them to leave bits I don&#39;t like off what I&#39;m ordering as me having allergies; it&#39;s easier than a long explanation and it makes me feel less like I&#39;m being awkward.)<br><br>Strawberry beer sounds like a very Mossflower-y thing, now I think about it. Will have to include it in the OFUR. Perhaps the students can figure &quot;strawberry cordial = good, October Ale = good, mix the two together = better&quot;, do so, and puke, because that&#39;s not how to make strawberry-flavoured beer. They&#39;re mostly teens and college-agers, experimenting unsuccessfully with alcohol is what they do.</p>

            <p>A ten minute hangover? I should be so lucky. :P<br><br>I&#39;m guessing this October Ale is, well, an ale, rather than a lager.

            <p>There&#39;s also Kriek, which is well worth trying if you ever come across it; it&#39;s cherry beer.<br><br>I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve smelled beer brewed in England, which tends to be a bit on the grim side. One&#39;s generally better with bottled stuff brewed on the continent, but if you haven&#39;t acquired the taste even that wouldn&#39;t be great. It&#39;s excellent stuff if you&#39;re planning to get involved in burping competitions though.

            <p>It was me who said I didn&#39;t like the taste of beer. But Pads&#39;s idea sounds pretty good. Once I get a drink or two in me I&#39;m likely to be one of those singing rather loudly, but what else can one expect from a tipsy Assassin? :D</p>

            <p>Ansela, darling, if that muppet of yours comes, he&#39;s buying his own damned drinks. We may buy one for him, if he can&#39;t get served, since he&#39;s a birthday coming, but beyond that he&#39;s on his own, and if he had the lack of foresight to be born in a year when one can&#39;t get served at fourteen that&#39;s his look-out.<br><br>Do not ask about the plan, love.

For commissions, I can do three different sizes; sketches, lines, grayscale, colored pencils, combinations thereof; figures, scenes, portraits, animals, whatever. Basically, if it&#39;s in my gallery, I can do it. If it isn&#39;t, I might be interested in trying anyway.<br><br>As for prints, well, I just have to figure out how that [devART&#39;s system] works.<br><br>So, if you would be interested, or if you know someone who would be interested, please let me know!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yes, I have actually finished something! I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s a bit of a monster, being 34<sup>1/2</sup> pages in OpenOffice, but it&#39;s broken into five reasonably-sized parts: Prologue, Epidemic, Interlude, Invasion, and Epilogue.<br><br>So, I need at least one person, preferably two, to tackle the lot and do SPaG and a general review of continuity, accuracy, timing, characterization, etc. I&#39;ll also take as many as want to look at just one or two parts, since there&#39;s so much. Knowledge of the events of the 2008 Macrovirus Epidemic and Mary-Sue Invasion is good but not required. Knowledge of various canons, including Pern, Phantom of the Opera, and Dragonlance, is also good but not required. Knowledge of the PPC in general is a must.<br><br><sup>_~<br><br>~Neshomeh</sup></p>
