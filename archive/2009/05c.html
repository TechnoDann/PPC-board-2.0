            <p>I&#39;m about to start work on sporking a fic in the Merlin (BBC) canon, and as far as I&#39;m aware a) no-one&#39;s done one yet, and b) no mini is designated for this canon.<br><br>Being as it&#39;s unique to the programme, I would propose that the minis be mini-Questing Beasts. There are other monsters in Merlin but mostly they&#39;re pretty generic heraldic beasts. <br><br>The only issue with the Questing Beast is that its bite is canonically fatal and incurable. <br><br>So my question is, if I did end up using mini-Questing Beasts, would it be best to say that the minis do NOT have this canonical power, or that they all have to be kept muzzled, or simply to pick a slightly less invariably deadly creature to be the mini?</p>

            <p>It&#39;s popped up in other Arthurian fantasy before. I know I&#39;ve seen a few literary references here and there. Should probably make a good mini, though.<br><br>As for mini-ness, I think they should just lack the bite of doom. Muzzles are a bit risky - they might be forgotten or removed somehow, which might mean loads of dead Agents. Generics just don&#39;t work as well.</p>

            <p>Ooh, you got references? I know next to nothing about the Arthurian legend, it&#39;s just that I&#39;d not heard of the Questing Beast before and I figured that a creature that&#39;s a hybrid of what looks like a leopard and a cobra and which is tied into a religion that appears to have mostly been made up of pick n mix aspects of fantasy/Celtic religions was mostly an invention, but I&#39;d be really interested if you know where I could find more to read about it.</p>

            <p>As I was thinking of that, I realized that I completely forgot just where I heard of it. Pretty sure there was at least one mention of King Pellinore trying to skewer an undescribed Questing Beast of some sort, in some story I read quite a while back. I&#39;d guess a little digging around about the beast might turn up something useful.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t watch <i>Home and Away</i> - I only know the title because half the people in Australia seemed to watch it - so usually I&#39;d ignore anything about it, but <a href="http://www.3news.co.nz/News/Home-and-Aways-lesbian-love-plot-comes-under-fire/tabid/423/articleID/106528/Default.aspx?_cobr=MSN">according to this article</a>, the show recently introduced a lesbian love story and is being <b>berated</b> for it.<br><br>The first thing that jumped to my mind when I read that was one of Pads&#39; responses to my interview questions about fanfiction a few months ago: She said a lot of fanfic slash is &quot;a response to the total lack of slash available offline&quot;, and that &quot;The media is saturated with sex, and it&#39;s all heterosexual sex. A fairly hefty proportion of the population is alienated by the images they&#39;re subjected to all day, every day. I&#39;d like a rather more realistic portrayal of sexuality, and that means including gay characters as well as straight.&quot;<br><br>And she&#39;s absolutely right. I&#39;m not a slash fan, but I get really, really angry reading things like this: <br><br><i>&quot;I think it&#39;s another example of an agenda that&#39;s being pushed by several parts of our society to try and depict the gay lifestyle as normal and natural,&quot; says Presbyterian Youth Minister Andrew Vines.</i><br><br>&quot;Normal and natural&quot;?

            <p>I&#39;m finally doing research for my essay on John Wilmot and his most excellent play <i>Sodom, or, the Quintessence of Debauchery</i>. This has involved looking up attitudes to homosexuality during the Restoration. We&#39;re talking 250-350 years ago. Interesting points of note:<br><br>Homosexuality was viewed as having great potential in theatre, generally as a means of social commentary or satire. Rochester goes a bit beyond most (and there was a whole lawsuit about obscenity), having sodomy equated with Catholicism.<br><br>However, sodomy wasn&#39;t viewed as a sin, or against Church doctrine. (That&#39;d be the Anglican church; the play passes comment on Charles II&#39;s motives for pushing religious tolerance in Protestant England.) It was just viewed as not the best way of expressing sexual desire.<br><br>Plays were generally seen by the upper classes, but there was worry that the themes and ideas within would trickle down to the lower classes, and warp the thinking of a lot of unsophisticated young men.<br><br>So there wasn&#39;t the &quot;omg sin not normal get it away like NOW!&quot; response, but there was still the idea that youngsters might be getting ideas.<br><br>Just thought I&#39;d throw that in, since it&#39;s an interesting parallel.</p>

            <p>Which to kill every moron in the world with? Hmm... decisions, decisions...<br><br>For God&#39;s sake, seriously? WTF?<br><br>First of all, I should point out that I have no idea what orientation I am. I&#39;m a &#39;&#39;total&#39;&#39; virgin who&#39;s never even been kissed. For now, I&#39;ll identify as heteroflexible (because Pads thinks it sounds funny).<br><br>I&#39;m not exactly a Slash fan, but I think that&#39;s more because none of it that I&#39;ve encountered has been written well at all. If I find a good one, chances are I&#39;d enjoy it regardless of pairing.<br><br>I presume that I&#39;d be vaguely uncomfortable with gay people in that, if they start to hit on me, I&#39;ll be slightly confused as to how to respond. That&#39;s theory as that&#39;s not happened to me yet. However, that&#39;s nothing bad, because I feel uncomfortable if women hit on me (it happened once :P). I just have no idea what to say, my stammer hits like an anvil dropped from the sodding atmosphere, my head could be mistaken for a tomato. I presume that it&#39;d be the same for gay people.<br><br>However, I do support gay relationships and gay rights. I think that Star Trek should have one, even if it&#39;s only a minor role at first. No more beating around the bush, an actual proper gay episode. As Gene Roddenbury said &quot;In the 24th century, no-one gives a shit!&quot;<br><br>I have at least three bisexual friends, two lesbian and one undecided, on top of my indecision. In fact, the only part of gay rights activism that I don&#39;t approve of (that I know about, anyway) is gay couples being allowed to adopt children. This isn&#39;t religious fanaticism or mindless homophobia (after all, if I find myself in a homosexual relationship, my views will affect me). This is pity for the child in question. Children can be utter devil-spawn when they want to be. I&#39;ve bullied to the brink of suicide throughout my life. Can you imagine the type of flak that&#39;d get thrown a child&#39;s way if the others found out that they had two fathers or two mothers? I hope that one day, I can support gay adoption, but that day won&#39;t be a long time if it&#39;s even within my lifetime. That day will only come when homosexuality is accepted for what it is: nothing to be afraid of.<br><br>But that&#39;s the problem isn&#39;t it? This generation&#39;s homophobia is infecting the next generation. Our children won&#39;t be able to tell that it&#39;s wrong if all they see and hear are homophobes ranting mindlessly about shit like this. Therefore, I come back to my original question: P90 or phaser?<br><br>Just my two pennies.</p>

            <p>Heck, the film opens with a flashback showing baby Jay&#39;s first word to be &quot;f---&quot; (censored because of Board filtering system) and it goes on from there. The plot goes roughly like this:<br><br>Jay and Silent Bob are a pair of stoners living in New Jersey, who spend most of their time hanging around outside a convenience store selling weed. At the start of the film the convenience store gets a restraining order against them, so they go to hang out in a comic book shop instead. They meet up with a friend who, in a previous film, wrote a superhero comic entitled &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot; with characters based on them, but has now sold the rights to Miramax. This basically means that the movie&#39;s going to be made and Jay and Bob won&#39;t get any of the money, and on top of that they see that random kids are making fun of them on the Internet. They decide that the best way to stop this is to go to Hollywood and stop the movie being made. They hitch a lift with what they think is an animal rights group, Jay following along because he&#39;s attracted to Justice, one of the girls with the group. (Most of the fans of the movie loathe her and think she was just put in to prove Jay&#39;s heterosexuality. If she was, she failed miserably, because he still has WAY more tension with Bob, though I don&#39;t think she did anything to deserve the level of hate she gets.) Anyway, Justice persuades him to &quot;prove his love&quot; by breaking into a research lab and stealing Suzanne the orangutan. This is actually a decoy, because the &quot;animal rights group&quot; is actually a gang of international jewel thieves, and they&#39;re breaking into the bank across the street while Jay and Bob free the animals. They go on the run with Suzanne, and eventually get to Hollywood and try to sabotage the movie. It doesn&#39;t work, but Bob does persuade the director to let them share in the profits, which they use to travel around the country and beat up people who said bad things about them online.</p>

If they&#39;re exposed at a very young age to the idea that some people have parents of different genders, some have parents of the same gender, and some have only one parent, and some have three or four or five parents, and the reasons why are explained, little kids at least tend to be pretty accepting of the whole deal.<br><br>Might be a bit different when they hit teenage years, but if you&#39;re going to take the &quot;let&#39;s not give the bullies ammunition&quot; route, you could just as well argue that my parents shouldn&#39;t have been allowed to have me, because a child who&#39;s a) ginger b) fat c) bespectacled d) socially inept and e) the smartest kid in the class is going to get a <i>lot</i> of shit.<br><br>Basically, pretty much everyone will get bullied for something. You won&#39;t improve matters by pretending homosexuality doesn&#39;t exist until kids hit their teens. All you&#39;ll do is ensure they come across something very different to anything they&#39;ve ever known at a time when most of them, frankly, are utter shites who could do with a damned good smack and then solitary confinement for ten years until they turn into reasonable human beings. Kids pick on anything <i>different</i>. If gay couples can adopt, then it&#39;s not such a big difference; kids are more used to the idea.</p>

That&#39;s ridiculous and will make the problem worse. I&#39;m saying that it can&#39;t just <i>happen</i>. It has to be a gradual thing, slowly introducing them to concepts that the current generation finds distasteful. As time goes on, we&#39;ll introduce these concepts faster and faster until it <i>can</i> by a child from birth that people are all different and that&#39;s nothing to be afraid of. That&#39;s what I&#39;m aiming for, slow gradual change. Fast change could possibly do more harm than good.</p>

            <p>Yeah, but the thing is, it already just happens. And it doesn&#39;t automatically lead to children being bullied to the point of suicide. Might be handy to hear Trojie&#39;s perspective here, on how her bloke coped having three mothers.<br><br>Anyway, half the problem is that gradual change is bloody hard to effect. It sounds like you&#39;re suggesting we need to eliminate homophobia in every parent, in every media outlet, in everyone who might at all affect a child enough to make them bully other kids based on their parents&#39; gender, before gay adoption can be allowed. That sort of blanket acceptance is pretty much impossible, and one way to work towards it is to expose kids to the idea that there&#39;s nothing wrong with it from a young age. Having schoolmates with same-sex parents is an excellent way from children to learn that. Sure, later on they&#39;ll some of them likely pick up homophobia from other sources, but not all of them will. Some who&#39;d never really think about it, not be opposed to the idea per se, but would be mildly uncomfortable about the idea, would have some basis for reference and would have examples, from an early age, of perfectly normal and healthy same-sex relationships. Takes away the mystery, takes away the difference, takes away the fear, and so takes away the hate.</p>

            <p>My partner was mocked at school for having &#39;two mums&#39;. He dealt with it in a very mature and typically teenage boy fashion from what I&#39;ve gathered - he by turns ignored, offered violence to, or mocked in retaliation the people who did it. And he grew up fine. Except for the odd detention for the violence, I understand. <br><br>Being bullied at school happens. Kids who bully don&#39;t need excuses. If they can&#39;t get you on one thing they&#39;ll get you on another. The way to deal with bullying is to deal with bullies, not to try and &#39;not give them reasons&#39;. They don&#39;t *need* reasons. They don&#39;t care about reasons. Kids who bully do it because they like control and they like power. They&#39;re not doing it because they feel it&#39;s their right to persecute those who are different. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m not suggesting everyone&#39;s opinion be changed, because that&#39;s just stupid. Just most of them, and definitely the mainstream media. But gradual change is coming all the time. This Home and Away thing. The garbage Fox talked about the Shepard/Liara relationship in Mass Effect (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect#Fox_News_on_the_sex_scene"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect#Fox_News_on_the_sex_scene">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect#Fox_News_on_the_sex_scene</a></a>). The Star Trek books with gay characters. Every fanfiction author who writes slash (good or bad). It&#39;s all helping. Slowly, maybe, but the more things change, the quicker change can happen.</p>

            <p>I think it&#39;s still too big a change for now. I&#39;m praying that I can see it happen in my own lifetime as children are a major, major hope for my life.

            <p>It&#39;s still a gradual change though - it&#39;s not like every gay person in the world is going to immediately want to adopt a child. And the hope wouldn&#39;t be ruined in the slightest - there&#39;s adoption, surrogacy, fostering, etc.</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t believe people still get away with spouting this sort of nonsense about homosexuality being something that should be kept away from &#39;normal&#39; people.<br><br>Here&#39;s me. I&#39;m straight (well, probably logically what I am is just someone who hasn&#39;t found a member of the same sex attractive *yet* :P). I&#39;m engaged. When I get married, I will find myself with (to all intents and purposes) three mothers-in-law - my partner&#39;s mother, her ex-partner who helped raise my partner and is acknowledged by him as his second mother, and his mother&#39;s current partner who has recently given birth to my partner&#39;s adoptive half-brother. Yes, it&#39;s a confusing wee family tree, but they are a happy, stable family. I go round to visit and to cuddle my brand-new almost-half-brother-in-law and it&#39;s like being in any other family home. It&#39;s not that much different than going round to see my friend (who is a single mother) and cuddle my godson. <br><br>Thing that really gets me, right, is that people happily interact with people of the opposite sex all day long without worrying that they&#39;re being eyed up. But tell them that someone of the same sex who they&#39;re interacting with is gay, and they suddenly start getting worried that they&#39;re going to get jumped in the locker-room, as it were.<br><br>When I was a girl guide, we had one (1) male leader. He was gay. He was not allowed to supervise us unless a female leader was around at all times (which sort of defeated the purpose of having him as we were really short on leaders at that point in time). For some reason a large number of the mothers got it into their heads that because he was a GAY MAN he automatically wanted to molest their TEENAGE DAUGHTERS.<br><br>Wtf? The logic, I see it not. They eventually got him kicked out, I might add.<br><br>But then again I get angry at things like national stereotypes and other kinds of sweeping judgements against large groups of people, so perhaps this is all just part of that.<br><br>- Trojie, half an hour past her bedtime and it&#39;s showing ...<br><br></p>

            <p>Are you familiar with the webcomic Suicide For Hire? At one point the main character Hunter is harassed and threatened by a gay guy and ends up warning him off by threatening him at gunpoint. The guy&#39;s reaction is to scream &quot;hate crime&quot;. Hunter responds that he does indeed hate him, but because of his behaviour rather than his orientation. Storyline starts around here: <a href="http://suicideforhire.comicgenesis.com/d/20060920.html"><a href="http://suicideforhire.comicgenesis.com/d/20060920.html">http://suicideforhire.comicgenesis.com/d/20060920.html</a></a><br><br>Before anyone gets offended by it, the unfortunate implications caused by the only gay character to appear in the comic so far being, quote, &quot;a vile, disgusting would-be rapist&quot; are mostly cancelled out by the fact that the nature of the comic means all the *straight* people are pretty damn unpleasant individuals as well, Hunter himself actually being possibly the worst.</p>

            <p><i>&quot;This is a typical gay agenda propaganda exercise, we should be used to it. It&#39;s been going on since the AIDS epidemic started. Trying to normalise homosexuality, AIDS is everyone&#39;s problem etc. Get used to it folks!&quot; -Dave<br><br>&quot;So if you think it&#39;s normal ponder this if everyone turned gay the human race will be extinct in less than 50 years! I for one are turning off home and away shame I did really enjoy it but now I will turn to a good book with an uplifting story. I have very close girlfriends who I absolutely adore but why confuse it with a sex! They should get a life! Shirley&quot; -Shirley<br><br>&quot;So as always homosexuals get special treatment (even tho they don&#39;t think so). There is uproar when a natural heterosexual couple kiss and make out on daytime TV for kids veiwing but hey, lets put 2 girls doing it and confuse our kids more than they already are! A lot of people get cancer, but does that make it normal?&quot; -Jacqui</i><br><br>*facepalm* This type of narrow-minded viewpoint is all too common. Just look at &#39;Global warming isn&#39;t real&#39;, &#39;L0Lbanz0rz violent videogames!1!!one&#39;, and &#39;Muslims are ALL terrorists&#39;. Might be a medical condition - lack of live braincells, perhaps? First one has extra fail points though, for the &#39;only gay people have AIDS&#39;. AIDS is most definitely not exclusively sexually transmitted - this one&#39;s never heard of blood transfusions or injections, methinks.<br><br>I agree with WarriorJoe - I don&#39;t mind alternative sexuality, but I&#39;m more comfortable with heterosexuality. Basically, if a gay guy doesn&#39;t go after *me*, then it isn&#39;t a problem. Although some overly flamboyant homosexuals can be disturbing - but then that&#39;s the Philippines for you. Some gay people here are a bit strange, but others aren&#39;t.</p>

If Muslims were to police themselves and weed out extremists, then they would find that the world would think of them far more favourable.

In fact, if everyone were to turn homosexual instantly, that would be a good thing. It&#39;d solve world overpopulation in an instant.

            <p>Quick googling listed that first. Never heard of him until now, but I do have a few comments on his theories. I will read his books sometime though, given the chance.<br><br>In my opinion, there isn&#39;t too much of a problem in believing that there is a supreme being. I&#39;m personally set to believe the truth if it is proven, no matter what it turns out to be. If there is a God, then disbelievers are wrong. If there is no God, then believers are wrong. And it doesn&#39;t pose much of a problem for me, unless either side starts a war.<br><br>Having an image of a governing deity or deities is not in itself bad. If people are just deluding themselves, sure. It&#39;s fine with me, unless the supposed delusion leads to fanaticism. If it leads people to become better because they&#39;re making themselves think they have to be to avoid damnation, then good. The true problem lies in the zealots who twist and manipulate religious teachings to fit their malignant and almost invariably wrong beliefs, then use theism as a shield to justify the atrocities they commit in their god&#39;s name.<br><br>Religion is not in itself the problem, per se. It&#39;s just one piece of a combination that, depending on its other parts, can lead to great good or great evil. And sometimes great genocidal assholes. Some atheists can likewise commit great crimes due to hatred of religion in general. Religion changes causes and possibly targets, but usually not effects in general. The Catholic Church used to have people killed for not converting. Some Muslims have people killed for whatever militantly religious reason they might have. Some atheists might harbor thoughts of killing people just because they&#39;re preachers. An Omnicidal Maniac is an Omnicidal Maniac. Religion&#39;s main problem is that it can be so easily exploited as justification, and that&#39;s most of it as far as I know.<br><br>Scientology seems to be another case entirely. Exploiting belief for profit is just being an arse. That&#39;s the other main problem about belief. Not much more I can think of there.<br><br>And on that line of Leviticus, I facepalm at whoever the hell felt like sticking that into the Bible. The book was written by people, and people are frequently biased, after all. Hence &#39;left-handed people and tattoos are evil&#39;, among other things.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll grant you there&#39;s no problem in believing per se, so long as you&#39;re not buggering anyone else about in the process. But Dawkins&#39;s main point revolves around this:<br><br><i>If it leads people to become better because they&#39;re making themselves think they have to be to avoid damnation, then good.</i><br><br>This is reminiscent of the notion expressed by many believers that morality comes from their god. Dawkins thinks that we <i>shouldn&#39;t</i> be good because, effectively, we&#39;re scared of monsters under the bed or retribution from a higher authority. He thinks we have the capacity to be moral without any gods at all.<br><br>A parallel, if it helps: say you&#39;ve hurt me in a major way, and I want to kill you as vengeance. I might not kill you because my god would punish me, or I might not kill you because I know killing&#39;s wrong. The effect is the same, and your mileage may vary, but I for one would rather the latter than the former.<br><br>And I&#39;m with you on the bias of people, but the bit that irks me is when someone thinks it&#39;s divinely inspired, and still disregards it.<br><br>Tattoos are wrong? Where&#39;s it say that?</p>

            <p>Someone on Yahoo Answers asked, someone answered, I read. One passage (I think it was in Leviticus, which Trojie proved to sometimes spout bull out of many orifices) had something about not having them. Back then, though, tattoo artists were apparently nonbelievers who slapped pictures of their idols specifically onto their skins.<br><br>As for the other stuff, good point. Logic is good, because it stops people from being idiots effectively. Although, one thing particularly struck me: the issue of morality.<br><br>I think it&#39;s important, but can take a bit of a backseat to what provides necessary progress and general advancement. Say, if some lucky asshole acts out popular fiction and takes over the world with a money-guzzling corporation, then it wouldn&#39;t change the fact that Robin Hooding the guy out of trillions and knifing him would be morally viewed as bad, because stealing and murder obviously doesn&#39;t mark you as a pillar of society. However, it would probably be the right thing - if it helps all the others survive, it saves people who are helpful and useful to society when looked at in the bigger picture. It also puts a dent in a megalomaniacal dick&#39;s plans. Moral sacrifices can be necessary, but not all the time. Balance is good.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d guess the edict against tattoos was probably one of many ways of distinguishing between Us and Them. (I&#39;d be buggered, I have three.)<br><br>You seem to be assuming that morality is fixed and immutable; that Killing Is Wrong, for example. That&#39;s the line that religions tend to take - no shades of grey, just right and wrong as defined from above. Generally, in a society in which one <i>can</i> lead a money-guzzling corporation, then by that society&#39;s morality robbing one of one&#39;s money would be morally wrong. Stealing it all and redistributing it? Not necessary wrong, dependent upon the consequences (but positive consequences would be very hard to implement). You could argue it&#39;d be right to kill the megalomaniac, or you could argue it&#39;d be wrong, but the point is you&#39;d be <i>thinking</i> about it, and considering all options logically, before coming to a conclusion, rather than simply denouncing the one for greed and the other for theft and murder.</p>

            <p>And how about getting to the top of the ladder, seeing others flailing halfway up, and so lending them your ladder? Because that&#39;s what Dawkins tries to do when he encourages people to think instead of believing without question.</p>

            <p>&quot;Excuse me while I weep in the name of Dawkins.&quot;<br><br>Who&#39;s Dawkins?<br><br>And you&#39;ll have to forgive me, I&#39;m not greatly familiar with the Bible. Leviticus is the Old Testament, correct? If so, the OT is fanfiction (*wonders if he&#39;ll get flamed for that*). God was a bloody psycho in the OT. Frankly, I ignore it completely. After all, Genesis: Eve <i>is</i> Adam. Then they have lots of children. Who have sex with each other. If that&#39;s true, then humans are all deformed monsters of what we once were (especially since the gene pool was again destroyed with Noah). So, really, the Bible promotes incest. But that&#39;s another rant.</p>

            <p><i>Who&#39;s Dawkins?</i><br><br>*continues weeping*<br><br>He&#39;s about the most militant atheist you can get. Your library should have a copy of <i>The God Delusion</i>; read it. And then read <i>The Blind Watchmaker</i> and <i>The Selfish Gene</i>.<br><br>Leviticus 18:22 states &quot;Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind; it is abomination.&quot; It&#39;s fairly clear (and also leaves room for lesbians - if a lesbian reads it then it pretty nicely affirms that she should stay away from penises. Funny how homophobic Christians tend to miss that one).<br><br>Also, I&#39;m not sure the Old Testament could be fanfiction, given it&#39;s written rather earlier than the New Testament. So far as I understand, the God of the New Testament, and his teachings through Jesus, supposedly supersede the Old Testament, but then you have to wonder why they keep the Old Testament in there.<br><br>And as for the incest bit, you have to remember that when that creation myth was coined, there was no concept of genetics. Fertility itself was surrounded in mystery - look at all the Greeks who were fathered by Zeus in his guise of a swan or a bull or a vase of flowers; look at Rerir&#39;s wife being pregnant with Volsung for six years in the Volsungasaga; look at Henry VIII steadfastly refusing to believe his inability to father a son could have anything to do with him; look at the eighteenth century notion that the womb caused hysteria. It wasn&#39;t even all that long ago that a firm link between sex and pregnancy was understood and recognised in scientific literature. Look at Darwin too - many of his children suffered congenital illnesses, and this helped inform some of the ideas he later set forth. But a few thousand years ago? It wasn&#39;t known. For a start because it&#39;s rare - women would be married out to someone of a neighbouring tribe, not to members of their immediate family, because the latter had no point. And if a deformed child was born of an incestuous union, it would be presumed that the parent(s) had angered the gods, or were under a curse, or whatever, rather than being a simple matter of genetics. Adam and Eve, and Noah, were God&#39;s chosen, and therefore not cursed (except for the original sin thing), and so would not have deformed children.<br><br>Uh, that was rambly. The point is, it&#39;s myth, not legend. When you start throwing the supernatural into the mix, rules of genetics no longer apply.</p>

            <p>Correction: any good library should have a copy, and they can order it in for you if they don&#39;t.<br><br>The pick and mix aspect of religion is a whole different rant. But by ignoring the Old Testament God and sticking with the New Testament one because you prefer him, you&#39;re doing it yourself. The entire thing&#39;s meant to be the word of God and so infallible. <i>If</i> it&#39;s the word of God, then you have to believe all of it or none of it. If it&#39;s <i>not</i>, then the entire argument is a moot point because there&#39;s no way to verify the truth of any of it.<br><br>Yes, you still get people saying evolution isn&#39;t true. I&#39;d direct them to Darwin himself, because, in <i>Origin of Species</i>, he at no point states that evolution and religion are incompatible; simply that animals, once on earth, evolve. There are two problems from the religious point of view: God&#39;s creations are meant to be perfect, but evolving to suit their environment suggests imperfection; and God created the world about six thousand years ago, but evolution requires considerably longer time periods (if Trojie will forgive the gross understatement). The problem&#39;s not with evolution, it&#39;s with trying to reconcile evolution with scripture.<br><br>That was rambly too. Basically, there&#39;s nothing (that I know of) in the Bible that simply cannot be reconciled with modern understanding of genetics, especially when you remember that (except for the hardcore fundamentalists) Adam, Eve and Noah are taken as myths, not legend.</p>

            <p>Yeah, well, as I&#39;ve told you before, my library&#39;s not good. Besides, I owe them Ј30 or so right now and I&#39;m not paying it back for a while.<br><br>The bits I&#39;ve read of the NT are so wildly contradictory to the OT that that essentially cancel it out.

            <p>By &quot;go after&quot; you do you mean actively trying to get in your pants even though you&#39;re straight or simply checking you out and finding you attractive?

            <p>That... sounds like they&#39;re indirectly and possibly-unknowingly trying to murder your dogs. What with cars, starvation, predators that may be found in the nearest forest... Oy. Hearing things like this make me very, very angry. I agree that a lot of the time, they trade thought for blind obedience to their beliefs. Personally, they have *no* right to take pets from loving, caring owners who might just be the only reason they&#39;ve lived. Padlock the gate, might help.<br><br>(offtopic, and completely irrelevant socialization) For some reason, whenever I hear about dogs, I want to see them or know more about them.

            <p>We don&#39;t have a forest near here, per se, but there is a hunting wood... on the other side of a railway line. I&#39;d hate to think what would happen if the dogs got in there. There&#39;s also the problem of the idjits who think they&#39;re the next Lewis Hamilton racing around, not caring about anything.<br><br>I&#39;d love to know how they got the gate open without being attacked, really.

            <p>Never believed in it. For some, it&#39;s a life choice for health reasons. Fine by me. For others, it&#39;s because they don&#39;t want to &#39;be mean to the animals&#39;.

            <p>Bugger. That would&#39;ve been the easiest line to take.<br><br>My housemate was vegetarian for years because he objects to the treatment of animals. About a year ago he decided he was going to be &quot;freegan&quot; instead, and only eat stuff if it was free or going to waste. Of course, this meant he had to eat some poor quality sausages that would have been thrown away after a barbecue. When he bitched about them being gross, I promptly fed him pheasant, which he loved. And now he&#39;ll eat meat but not buy it.<br><br>Of course, while he was still vegetarian, I could never get him to eat free-range chicken or game...</p>

            <p>While some parties, possibly some large corporations, keep animals in inhumane conditions, they aren&#39;t everyone. I know that if I kept animals for food or by-products, I would ensure that they could live out their lives in comfort. Killings in the wild by other animals can be several times more brutal and painful than a farmer having to put down poor Bessie to feed his family, especially when you consider that some animals like live meals or playing with their prey. Ah, generalizations. Can&#39;t live with them, can&#39;t live without &#39;em.</p>

            <p>And I agree with you. I dislike slash, but only when it has canons acting out of character or having sex with relatives or trivializes rape or other things like that.

            <p>I, for one, am well aware that homosexuality is a part of nature. Not just in humans, but in a truckload of other species as well, so there&#39;s no arguing that it&#39;s a perversion or something that can be changed.<br><br>However, that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m comfortable with it anyhow. I&#39;ll be honest-- I find it weird. Not necessarily bad, and I&#39;m certainly not the type who&#39;s going to go parading down the street with a GAYS ARE THE DEVIL&#39;S CHILDREN sign or anything, but I can&#39;t help finding it weird. I don&#39;t think it has all that much to do with the way I was raised, since I was raised to be tolerant, so in the end it just IS weird to me.<br><br>People get angry about things they find weird or not like them because, deep down (or not, in some cases) they feel threatened by them. It doesn&#39;t matter how silly that feeling is, or the fact that it&#39;s caused more problems for humanity over the years than anything else under the sun; it&#39;s a long-ingrained response. Changing that is almost as hard as changing being homosexual. And it doesn&#39;t help ease the threatened feeling when people seem to be so intent to push homosexuality into the spotlight.<br><br>Granted, keeping it in the dark forever isn&#39;t a good idea either; a balance has to be reached. But it hasn&#39;t been found yet. So in the end we have two indelible traits of nature clashing against each other.</p>

            <p>But think about what you&#39;re saying. Homosexuality should kept quiet because you think it&#39;s weird, or it makes you uncomfortable? <br><br>Some people find interracial relationships weird. That&#39;s not a valid reason to keep them &#39;out of the spotlight&#39;, is it?<br><br>You probably think that homosexuality is weird because our culture tells us that it is. It doesn&#39;t matter how tolerant you think you&#39;ve been brought up to be. You&#39;d probably think two men walking down the street holding hands would be weird -- go to the Middle East, and you&#39;ll see it all the time. Weird in one culture is normal in another.

            <p>&quot;Should&quot; is such a horrible word in that it means someone is wrong not to do one thing or the other. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what Joe was saying anyway, though. <br><br>I certainly agree that Western culture doesn&#39;t help matters; everything from gender-specific clothing shops to &#39;sexy&#39; pairs of models reinforces the message that everything is about the differences between people, and that&#39;s horrible. Even knowing tht, homosexuality does make me a bit uncomfortable - I have three female friends who are to some degree either bisexual or lesbian, and it&#39;s hard not to be aware of that a lot of the time, but the degree to which they choose to display it is none of my business.</p>

            <p>But facts are, I find <i>heterosexuality</i> to be a little weird. I&#39;m bi, but the idea of only being attracted to one gender is a little off putting to me.<br><br>That said, I&#39;m not going to be parading down the street protesting straights either. So I can&#39;t be angry at you for thinking homosexuality is weird, especially since you&#39;re aware enough to know it&#39;s not weird and perfectly natural.<br><br>As for pushing homosexuality into the spotlight... That&#39;s more trying to end the discrimination and get rights like marriage. Being discreet never worked for any other civil rights battles. If people aren&#39;t aware that these people actually exist, they won&#39;t care about the issues. Otherwise they think the homosexual population is limited to a handful of perverts littered around the country and nothing anyone should be concerned about. (BTW, by &quot;pushing into the spotlight&quot; I mean the normal forms of protest that are perfectly peaceful but extremely noticeable. Violent protest is never the answer and I perfectly understand feeling threatened if that ever went down, though I haven&#39;t heard of any cases).  </p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;ve been on the board since last August or so, if a bit erratically. I&#39;m asking permission for the use of RC .999... for agents Nadine and Jodi, Department of Floaters. <br><br>Agent biographies are at <a href="http://slashmarks.livejournal.com/1373.html"><a href="http://slashmarks.livejournal.com/1373.html">http://slashmarks.livejournal.com/1373.html</a></a> and the writing sample is at <a href="http://slashmarks.livejournal.com/1544.html"><a href="http://slashmarks.livejournal.com/1544.html">http://slashmarks.livejournal.com/1544.html</a></a> .<br><br>Oh, and a note: I&#39;m not entirely sure about how well I&#39;m writing Agent Nadine&#39;s OCD. If any of you are obsessive compulsive, would it be possible to have you beta? Just having someone with actual experience with it reading my stuff through would be reassuring; I keep worrying I&#39;ll mess up and offend someone.</p>

            <p>The rest of the series is decent, but it&#39;s increasingly difficult to keep going if you&#39;re not a true fan. By the fourth book, the universe and the characters have changed too much to my taste. Although I am otherwise an atheist, I firmly believe that <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>. That&#39;s why Duncan Idaho is my favorite character: while everything changes, and not always for the better, Duncan remains.<br><br>I know that Leto II warns us against status quo and stagnation, using his 1500-year reign as a scheme to force humankind to evolve, but I refuse to follow the Golden Path. Long live the old empire!</p>

            <p>and my agents are bored; Party Time!<br><br>*****<br><br>&quot;Drat! Where is that party supposed to be again?&quot; Eesa struggled to hold on to about five bags of party supplies and a generous jug of bleepka as she trotted beside her partner down a hallway. Sive, who held nothing except a bag of popcorn, merely rolled her eyes.<br><br>&quot;Response Center 20736. It says it here on the paper.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Well, where is that? Our Response Center is nowhere near, surely.&quot;<br><br>One of the bags slipped from Eesa&#39;s grasp and spilled its contents all over the floor. Sive sighed and bent down to gather up the dumped items, mainly Silly String and confetti.<br><br>“We’ll find it eventually.” <br><br>*****<br><br>Eventually, as it turned out, happened to be two hours later. After lugging around the party stuff for this amount of time, Eesa felt like her arms were going to drop off. Luckily, this room couldn’t be mistaken for any others. The sign on it clearly read: “RC #20736”.<br><br>“Uh… Could you knock on the door, Sive? My arms are kinda full.” <br><br>Her partner took one look at the overburdened teenager and rapped on the door twice.<br><br>“Why did you bring so much stuff? I just brought popcorn.” Sive asked, rattling the bag she held slightly.<br><br>“’Cause I wanted to and that’s why.” Eesa retorted.<br></p>

Thar’s binded ta b sumoen heer hoo lieks teh same stufs yoo lieks (since we’re such a diverse group.) adn we lieks new peeps adn fresh meat — er, opinionz. Don’t worriez, teh Regularz’ barks iz far worse than deir bytez. (Although we doez bark lotz, I kan tell yoo.)  <br><br>10. If yoo dun understand sumfin, dun b afraid ta aks. Srsly!

            <p>The first scene in Celebrian (cut off where the smut starts; I ran that through it, too, but figured I probably shouldn&#39;t post it here):<br><br>Celebrian standed befoar teh goblin kin, hedz boweded. Her lawng silvah locks hided her faec. Silent tearz streameded down durtee checks. <br><br>Teh orcz haded nawt mistreateded her—woe ta n e orc hoo spoileded teh kin’s pleasuer-toy. But teh hem uv her travelin dress wuz wet adn muddied by teh lawng walk thru watah loggeded tunnelz. Her hehr wuz matteded adn her affecshun-appendixez werz muddied, bruiseded adn kut frum menny a tumble in teh dark. Noen uv dat mattered compared ta teh faet dat awayteded her at teh handz uv dis sow-cawleded kin. <br><br>&quot;Whut iz dis?&quot; sayed teh goblin kin. Teh lift uv him loin cloth cauzd by teh stiffenin uv him cock demonstrateded full well dat teh kweschun wuz moot. <br><br>&quot;A elf-bitch, yur highness, bringed frum teh caev at teh top uv teh pass. We snatcheded her whiel her sleeped.&quot; <br><br>&quot;wuz her alonze?&quot; askeded teh Kin. <br><br>Him yellow, watery eyup gazeded at him captiev. Dowz eyup displayeded a hint uv fear uv elf-warriorz but faar moar  dey gloweded wif lust. Elvez wud stawp at nofin ta reclaim a losed woman ta teh orcz. Az well dey shoodz, thot, teh kin contemplatin whut lied in stoar foar dis fien specimen uv elven womanhood. Breakin her ta him needz wud b exquisiet. <br><br>&quot;noes, yur highness. But dey haz nawt pursueded awr yet. gardz iz posteded. We will nows if dey com.&quot; <br><br>Celebrian kud follow deir werdz, foar teh orcz werz a mixeded lot uv big Uruks adn liddill woodz-goblinz adn uzd teh Westron tun ta communicaet. Her hart kud nawt halp leap wif teh remindah dat her husband Elrond wud com in search uv her. adn noes foarce uv orcz kud stay her rescue. Her haded ownlee ta owtlass her captorz foar a liddill whiel. <br><br>Teh goblin strokeded teh stubble awn him chin wif a graet claweded hand. Him idly pikkeded teh nostril uv him large pig-noes adn twicheded him pig-earz sow dat teh tuftz uv hehr in teh earz twicheded. Tusk-teef protrueded upward frum him undah-slun jaw. <br><br>Him smileded. Him knowed whut her wuz finkin. adn him knowed dat valor or nawt, eet wud taek graet effort foar Elvez ta track dem thru teh maez uv tunnelz. Dey haded nawt idly bringed her thru watah-filleded tunnelz: trackin wuz near impussible. <br><br>Teh Elvez wud com, but nawt foar a lawng tyme. adn him wud likely b goen lawng befoar dey arriveded. But if nawt, well, sum pleasurez werz worth teh risk. <br><br>&quot;Strip her,&quot; him sayed at lass. <br><br>Celebrian’s hedz jerkeded up. Her hehr falled awai frum her faec revealin violet eyup undah slivah eyebrowz, a fien small noes adn a tiniez, delicaet mouf. <br></p>

            <p>Frankly, I don&#39;t have the time to look through this as it&#39;s expanded rapidly. It&#39;s a rewrite of one of this author&#39;s old N&amp;C fics, which I objected to on sheer suckage factor by changing the ending to be a happy one and therefore ruining the entire message of the book. She then rewrote the story, coming to me for beta reading help. I accepted. She fired me about three days later because I pointed out plothole after plothole (and a number of biology errors, too). To my knowledge, she only kept the spelling and grammar erros (of which there were a lot). What I saw of it and the author&#39;s attitude makes me think badfic was imminent. Therefore, I&#39;m flagging this so someone else can read it and see if my suspicions were correct.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4763715/1/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4763715/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4763715/1/</a></a></p>

            <p>Hi everybody! None of you will remember me; I was active a few years ago, but not really for a long enough to have made any kind of lasting impression. So I suppose I will start with a brief introduction.<br><br>I primarily dabble in Lord of the Rings fanfiction, although I have been taking a several year hiatus. I actually recently returned due in part to the new Star Trek movie, figuring that the entire Star Trek Continuum is going to need some extra help with its recent revival in pop culture. I am female, and I once wrote a Mary Sue at twelve years of age; an unforgivable sin I know, but I do owe my writing ability to that early start. <br><br>I actually have a question for everybody, seeing as I haven&#39;t been around. What are we doing about the Twilight series? It&#39;s practically a canon Mary Sue... the author should be taken out and shot. Yet I&#39;m sure there&#39;s fanfiction being written on it. Anyway, that&#39;s more idle curiosity than anything else... it is <i>such</i> a dreadful book.<br><br>- MB</p>

            <p>So if anyone actually gives half a damn about my PPC work, you&#39;re probably going to have to wait a while for my third mission. While it&#39;s already been started, I just got back from the first session of my summer class on Hemingway, and by the look of things it&#39;s gonna put me through the wringer. I have to read all of A Moveable Feast (which is 200-odd pages), plus two online articles, and write a page-long paper, all by Thursday.<br><br>Regardless, I&#39;d really like to hear what other people think about Hemingway. I think I&#39;m gonna love this class, mostly because Hemingway is possibly a more interesting character than any he ever wrote himself. Just based off the synopsis of his life I got in my first class today, he was Hunter S. Thompson before Hunter S. Thompson had the chance to be (not joking; the parallels between them are almost alarming).<br><br>Anyone have any thoughts?</p>

            <p>My first thread on the subject was more a plea for review and criticism, but this is more a proper discussion.<br><br>I have, from early in my stories development, planned to integrate certain spiritualist elements into it:  the nature of the Allspark, a different (but not heinously uncanonical) interpretation of Starscreams character as half power-seeker and half religous fanatic and, more recently, what it would really mean to have a god born into a human body... a god that had been mostly instinctual in it&#39;s action until then (though the question of it&#39;s actual level of sentience is debated).<br><br>Since then, I have become a casual, CASUAL mind you, fan of the Dune Universe.  The Kwiatz Haderach, the Abomination and several other bits of Bene Gesserit lore intrigue me (and I intend to add them as small but meaningful bits of argument between characters).  The guys who make the government codenames, as I said, are Dune fantics and have a &quot;sick sense of humour&quot;.  However, I am unsure of one more bit of tie-in that I am pondering, anf I wonder if it would be too Blatant.<br><br>In short, Frenzy will (eventually), be revealed to be the last known member of a semi-collective species of &quot;Cybertroid&quot; life form.  Him and others like him have no central spark and normally have borderline plant level intelligence (thank you Mr. Soundwave).  But they came together on their native world to feed off geothermal energy below the surface, travelling in great, burrowing masses to move from fault to fault, vent to vent.  Their waste product:  tiny blue crystals that still held incredible amounts of residuaal, refined energy: Energon.  <br><br>Now, as someone will say, he is a Trout without his Worm, foundering in a sea of sand.<br><br>I speak in riddles, But am I being too obvious, even for Dune virgins?   </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve loved Star Trek: TNG, DS9, and Voyager, but I saw a few episodes of the Kirk series (and the newer Enterprise one) and just didn&#39;t like it. Too young, I guess; it felt contrived. So I went in with fairly low expectations.<br><br>They&#39;re sort of... gone, now. :D<br><br>I think that time-travel was the only reasonable way to make a movie like this without having it nit-picked to death by obsessed fans, and with that in mind, they did a really good job. I think we have to bear in mind that these Professional Scripwriters don&#39;t know crud about derivative writing like we do - we&#39;ve <i>seen</i> how horrible it can be and are jaded by iffy but can-be-done-well concepts like time travel AUs. When that particular revelation came in the film, I grinned and thought something like, <i>YES! That works everything out!</i><br><br>Of course, that gave them leave to demolish Vulcan, which made me very, very unhappy. <br><br>I don&#39;t like the womens&#39; uniforms either - I would NEVER wear one - but it has the excuse of a 60s canon, so... *shrug*<br><br>As for Spock/Uhura, the most volitle issue... it didn&#39;t bother me, but if they&#39;d left it out I would&#39;ve been just fine. The sense of Uhura being put in a relationship because she&#39;s the only lead woman is annoying, and as far as I see, they could&#39;ve picked Sulu or Scotty as easily as Spock, and only chose the latter because he&#39;s the most important character. It could&#39;ve been worse. Actually, I went looking for Spock/Uhura fics to see if any fanfic writer out there could sell me the pairing. So far, they haven&#39;t, but maybe they would be more likely to if I found Spock as attractive as the fanbase does.<br><br>Nero... wouldn&#39;t think of himself as an Evil Overlord, but that aside; no, definitely not. He made many classic mistakes. <br><br>If it were a fic, I would caution the author to be more traditional, but then, that is my style, and it has been done quite well. Admittedly, the music and the great visuals hit me a lot more strongly than a description of the bridge as being &quot;clean and white&quot;, or whatever.<br><br>(And yeah, why did no one start this thread sooner? *is puzzled*)</p>

            <p>&quot;(And yeah, why did no one start this thread sooner? *is puzzled*)&quot;<br><br>I just figured that it had been done to death already so I didn&#39;t make it myself.<br><br>I will admit that it was better than anything I could have possibly dreamed of. None of the pre-release trailers/interviews/whatever inspired confidence in me because they seemed to mess up Canon completely with bad time travel. The plot as a whole, though, removed those doubts. It was awesome.<br><br>Of course, it had a smegload of plotholes in and the second I get the DVD release, I&#39;ll be writing a list of them. Every. Last. One. Including the fact that they probably killed Tuvok and/or his family, thereby messing around with Voyager. They also ruined Unification Parts I and II.<br><br>As for the mini-miniskirts, this has made me laugh much as I try to watch TOS. Seriously, I&#39;m not even sure if they&#39;re <i>wearing</i> skirts. It actually does seem to be underwear and a shirt a lot of the time. And I laugh loudly every time I think this. For all the great equality and enlightenedness of Starfleet, they sure do love to humiliate their female officers. (And 60s TV has nothing to do with it. The least they could have done was give them midi-skirts like actual female military officers wear nowadays).<br><br>And what exactly is the Evil Overlord List?

            <p>It was great, and I think the reboot/AU idea is fantastic, because it&#39;s going to give the whole Trekverse a new lease of life. <br><br>If it was a fic I would applaud it!<br><br>The girls having no pants is standard Trek - it is the FUTURE!

            <p>Fourth time today. (Glods bless Odeon and its cheap Tuesdays - I&#39;d happily go alone but this way I get to attempt to convert friends.)<br><br>It is <i>amazing</i>. I went in with middling expectations and not much idea of what it was going to be about. Didn&#39;t even have a clue who they&#39;d cast, except Simon Pegg.

            <p>I really enjoyed the movie.

Some of you might be having aneurysms at the thought, but give me a minute. We have better technology now. We have better science, better special effects, and, let&#39;s face it, better plot devices than &quot;Kirk gets the girl.&quot; We come armed with the knowledge of how the five-year mission goes, so we have the potential for a series with more scientific intelligence and better internal consistency.

            <p>Hobbit movie, maybe. Depends how much craptastical fanfiction appears in it&#39;s wake (like Star Trek XI has).

            <p>The no-pants thing...well, it&#39;s canon.  At least for that part of Starfleet history.  The time-travelling Romulans probably didn&#39;t have much impact on military fashion.<br><br>Time travel as opposed to an unexplained retcon?  Good thing.  Time travel that lets Nimoy!Spock give the Vulcan salute to Quinto!Spock?  Good thing.  Time travel as opposed to just working with the canon that was already there?  Meh, not sure.<br><br>Yes, but if someone had shown Nero the Evil Overlord List, he would have killed Spock, and that would have made me very sad.  And it would have been a very short movie.<br><br>The parts of the movie that deviated from canon were all explained as part of the time-travel thing, which was certainly preferable to just disregarding canon without explanation.  And I felt that they did a fairly good job at staying true to what the show really meant.</p>

            <p>At Odeon they&#39;ve a trailer for the upcoming summer of films, featuring clips from various ones. It&#39;s got Spock crouched down immediately after being beamed onto Vulcan.

            <p>(A basic summary, as I haven&#39;t gotten to the part that fully explains what everything does yet)<br><br>The Canon Regulation Institute. A highly advanced, trans-dimensional organisation whose job is simple. Stop paradoxes. Reality must not be allowed to contradict itself. The main cause of reality contradictions? Why, those ever glittering bastards, the Mary Sues.<br>The CRI&#39;s Militavy Fleet consists of nearly innumerable Canon Protection Vessels (infinite number of dimensions = infinite resources and technology to leech off everyone else) are spread across the multiverse, hunting down Mary Sues wherever they can find them, and fixing reality contradictions before they can spiral out of control and seriously ruin everyone&#39;s day (which they *will* if they go unchecked).<br>Ironically, they&#39;re actually hunting down the prime source of contradiction: the Original Character, but since they can only detect the reality distortions, they only hunt down the &#39;bad&#39; ones that are, y&#39;know, breaking reality and stuff. The &#39;good&#39; ones (that don&#39;t do the above), are just ignored; the CRI can&#39;t detect them, so they just slip right through the nets. The CRI itself isn&#39;t too fussed about this, though a few factions within it are.<br><br>Sounds all sane, reasonable and normal(ish), right? Well...<br><br>Say hello to the CPV Icarus, a somewhat dilapidated old Juggernaut from the old days where the CPVs had to be roughly the size of a small continent to cram all the technology and equipment needed for stable dimensional transitions, reality shielding and so forth. Officially, the CRI is keeping it in service out of respect for the vessel&#39;s long and infamous tour of duty. Unofficially, it&#39;s the dumping ground for all the people they don&#39;t like very much. It&#39;s crewed by nutters. The only reason it hasn&#39;t imploded itself yet is that its current captain absolutely adores old fashioned ships and would, does and will put her own life on the line without a thought to keep it flying. It&#39;s considered something of a bad joke within the CRI... a measuring stick to compare all the other ships against. And yet, it still somehow manages to do its job, capturing and de-Sueing more OCs than even some of its more respectable cousins. Thus, the Icarus keeps flying...<br><br>Caught between the idiosyncrasies of its own crew, jealously and irritation from the rest of the CRI and of course the reality-distorting whims of the &#39;Sues, can it stay that way?<br><br>That&#39;s the premise. And believe me, a lot of the characters are quite cheerfully mad (in the funny, endearing way). Bizarrely, so far it&#39;s looking like the character interactions may get more focus than the whole &#39;Sue-hunting&#39; thing... this might be because I&#39;m more fond of character-driven stories, mind. And it&#39;s not set in any particular continuum; the CPVs are fully capable of trans-dimensional jumping. At the start, they&#39;re hanging out in the Harry Potter verse, snagging &#39;Sues as they try to get on the &#39;Express (CRI personnel and equipment are invisible to normals thanks to Reality Shielding - this is also how they can get away with sticking a great big continental-sized slab of metal in low-Earth orbit without seriously screwing up things like the tides).<br><br>So, what does everyone think? I can post up more (ie Character notes, what I&#39;ve written so far etc) if anyone&#39;s interested. Comments, ideas and criticisms all accepted; particularly the latter. The sooner you spot a problem...</p>

            <p>Basically, I think this idea sounds awesome. I love space stories, though my own attempts at writing them usually fizzle.<br><br>I&#39;d advise you, since you&#39;re writing this with heavy emphasis on the characters, to keep a close eye on them. Characters, especially those who you think you&#39;ve plotted out their personalities and such beforehand, have a tendency to get away from you and run off in their own direction. You might have to jerk them back into line every now and then.<br><br>(In my own experience, Fritz is a good example of this; he&#39;s shown himself to be much less worrisome and more aggressive and laconic than I&#39;d originally intended. Some of my older characters also refuse to be pigeonholed.)<br><br>That said, I admire you for doing something like this, and based off the character sheet you posted you&#39;ve got a good strong roster to work with, and a solid premise to build on. If you ever need beta-reading, drop me a line.</p>

            <p>Character-driven is good. Don&#39;t shy away from that. Just make sure that whatever you show about and between the characters has bearing on the story as a whole.

            <p>Don&#39;t worry, there are very few parallels, apart from the Sue-hunting thing. The CRI&#39;s primary job is to fix reality distortions rather than actually destroying the Sues (where possible, they actually &#39;un-Sue&#39; them if they can) and they don&#39;t go Sue-hunting from actual fanfic either. Really, Sue-hunting is a bit more background, to the point where I may actually change it to something more accessible to a wider audience. Like, say, Mad Scientists...</p>

            <p>When spaceships appear, expect large battles with lasers and stuff. Use some technobabble when needed. Justify or Handwave some of the most common tropes (Dogfights in Space? Say that guided missiles are good, but Sues can be killed better by named characters and besides, those are expensive anyway). As for parallels, what I meant was the job situation of the crew, and its effects on their emotional state (yes, I knew that this kind of story exsisted before the PPC, but since this came about directly or indirectly, as a result of Sue Hunting...).</p>

            <p>Also, at least have one member of the crew spend it on stuff like action figures and teddy bears, instead of booze. Chocolate and cotton candy are just as good as alcohol and women (at least in my opinion, not that it matters much). <br><br>And finally, make efficient use of a continent-sized warship. Even if only 5% or less is being used for habitation, that&#39;s still a lot of space. And if you really want to switch to something more mainstream, try Cosmic Horrors (Cthulhu! you&#39;ve had it too good for too long! And does that other abdomination that threathens to destroy the universe when he awakes, we&#39;ll just use Jigglypuff music on him!). Of course, that would harm the canon, unless you can make it belivable. This is only a suggestion, of course. </p>

            <p>Mm. After much thought, I think I&#39;ll change it to an intersellar police force. Keep the same basic theory (ie the Icarus is still the adhoc, outdated dumping ground for all the people that Admin don&#39;t particularly like), cutting out the Sue parts entirely, to focus fully on the warped cast of characters. Still, the focus is on silly to heart-warming character interactions and how the cast can still interact with each other despite being spectacularly messed up individuals (with the exception of the one, lone, sane person aboard the ship, who basically got transferred there by a typo).<br><br>Current Character Sheet:<br><br>Tashi Invanargres.<br>The Captain of the Icarus. Is known mostly for being pretty-much in love with her own ship, and probably knowing more about it than most of the engineering staff combined. Leaves most of the operations to Myka. Not that fond of her last name (for being hard to pronounce). Frequently found tinkering with something. Also notorious for knowing next to nothing about criminology and actual police-work; it&#39;s pretty obvious she&#39;s only there because she wanted the ship when no-one else did. In fairness to Tashi, she is probably the best the Icarus could have hoped to get for a captain; someone who actually gives a damn about the ship rather than someone who got the posting forced on them because they&#39;ve been disgraced. A side effect of this is that Myka effectively directs the ship&#39;s operations. Tashi doesn&#39;t care so long as she gets to mess around with the ship. She will pull rank if he tries something that could potentially damage the ship, however.<br><br>Myka<br>Commander of the Marines contingent aboard the Icarus, and responsible for planning and operations. Seems to be trying to get into Tashi&#39;s good books, but for the most part is just considered a drinking buddy; Tashi likes her ships a bit too much. A money-grabbing magnificent bastard, who&#39;s cost cutting policies annoy the marines about as much as his planning skills impress them. Has been barred from joining in the team pools created by Mayweather and Lude, for cheating and manipulating events into his favour. Very careful to keep Tashi on his side, since she&#39;s the only person who can actually pull rank on him.<br>If there&#39;s something with money involved, expect Myka to inexplicably pop up at some point.<br><br>Luciana Taylor<br>A gun-crazy female marine in the Corps. Known for being remarkably trigger happy with her dartgun (the Judiciary Marines use non-lethal dart-guns to subdue suspects), she frequently butts heads with Myka over ammunition allotments. Also known for being exceptionally hyper, with a love for annoying nicknames. Never, ever call her &#39;Luce&#39;. Is aware that she comes across as a lunatic, and makes frequent jokes about it (to the point where it&#39;s very likely she&#39;s actually completely sane and just pretends not to be for fun). Boisterous Bruiser.<br><br>Jacks<br>A permanently calm, apathetic and inattentive military brat who&#39;s usual response to anything is basically &#39;Eh.&#39; Usually found following Taylor or in one of the bars. Doesn&#39;t really seem to care about anything and generally goes around like he&#39;s permanently stoned. Like most things, Lude and Mayweather have a pool running on this. Wound up aboard the Icarus by annoying his posters by not paying attention / care. The Stoner, more or less.<br><br>Fields<br>An albino midget with an ordinary claw-hammer, she is actually in her thirties (and thus actually older than Kanz), but appears to be a young girl. Is renowned for being completely unflappable and almost robotic. Taylor seems to treat her as a little sister; whether Fields finds this annoying or not is impossible to tell. Shares a strong platonic relationship with Kanz, to the point where the two trust each other completely. The Stoic. Whilst she never herself takes advantage of her bizarre appearance, everyone else frequently does (except Kanz).<br><br>Kanz<br>A large, muscled man, known for being very quiet, polite and gentle. No-one&#39;s entirely sure what he&#39;s doing in the Marines, but he has a good aim and even treats the criminals cordially. Lude and Mayweather have a pool running on how long it will take him to snap, but as no-one thinks he actually will few have put money in it. Generally seen as the Team Mom, of sorts; even Taylor says that annoying Kanz is like kicking small puppies, even though he&#39;s bigger than her by at least two foot.<br><br>Pandell Lude<br>A giant, bald man with a fondness for his rifle and for betting on random things with Mayweather. Remarkably loyal, considering his friend...<br><br>Lewis Mayweather<br>A tall, thin, gangly man in his early-twenties with long hair, a vaguely Scottish accent and a near-permanent grin. Fond of bets and practical jokes, and for some reason Fields. Money switches hands between him and Lude so fast the two practically share the same account.<br><br>Dr Cassandra Lodgewick<br>For the most part, a walking ball of irritation and cigarette smoke, who loves narcissism as much as she does narcotics, but gets Pet The Dog moments around Lye. Finds Taylor annoying. Is basically an Expy of Ristuko Akagi from NGE, with a bit more snark and Les Yay.<br><br>Lye<br>Lodgewick&#39;s mute secretary. Communicates through action and expression. Is mute from a throat injury, and always wears a black neck-brace. Implied to be ex-Marines. Generally inseparable from Lodgewick, who usually acts as her translator of sorts. Frequently uses her &#39;Cute Mute&#39; status to her own advantage, and knows sign language (the problem being that few others do as well apart from Myka and Lodgewick).<br><br>Daniel Jones<br>A young, irresponsible would-be fighter-jock fond of annoying Sanderson and flying stupidly fast. Has a very obvious infatuation with Sanderson, which only serves to drive her further up the wall.<br><br>Lauren Sanderson<br>An tired, responsible skiff-pilot and about the only sane person aboard the entire ship. Finds Jones irritating, but occasionally drinks with Lodgewick and Lye. One of the few people who will not resort to extreme violence when threatened. Wound up posted to the Icarus thanks to a typo on a transfer form that resulted in her getting the posting instead of someone else with a similar name. In recognition of her sanity and sense of responsibility, Myka has put her in charge of rationing dangerous substances (ie caffeine and sugar). The betting pool on when *she* snaps is getting into the thousands. She herself even has a stake in it.<br><br>Sakura Onegai Bench<br>As a &#39;Sue from the original version of this story, I admit, about the only reason I&#39;m considering making Sakura an actual character is because her name makes me giggle. Serves in the Marines. Is very self conscious about how ridiculous her name is, and is generally naпve and easily to embarrass. Confusion (and teasing) abound on how her name can be read to mean &#39;Please bench Sakura&#39; and whether that counts as a euphemism or not. It&#39;s strongly implied that her parents never liked her very much.</p>

            <p>Has anyone ever wondered if a few of the best PPCers, working together, could conceivably write something of a high enough quality to be published? Either a novel or a collection of short stories?<br><br>Not something of the PPC, of course. Fanfiction and its tropes are not well-known enough to write novels about, and the &quot;meta&quot; side of fanfiction (Mary Sues, &#39;shipping, etc) is only studied by a handful of Internet nerds. But the general concept of a bunch of cynical and <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> characters exploring fictional universes, with loads of unconventional humor (Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett-style) and a healthy dose of postmodernism, certainly has a place on the shelves of a library.<br><br>It&#39;s just an idea thrown in the wind, not a project.</p>

            <p>The problem, of course (and yes, I know you said not a project, but I&#39;m a thinky sort) is that involving fictional universes brings to pass all sorts of unpleasant licensing issues. Using public domain works brings it uncomfortably close to the works of Jasper Fforde (which I have recently started reading), so my mental telescope can already see a rock on one side, a hard place on the other.<br><br>Unless, of course, a bunch of PPCers were able to publish their own original works and then set stories for this in those... but that&#39;s a bit over-ambitious even for the Board, methinks.<br><br>Anyway.

            <p>I haven&#39;t written a single real mission for the PPC, and English is not even my first language. Besides, as I mentioned on my LiveJournal account on the off-chance that there&#39;s someone who glances at it once in a while, I am <i>already</i> losing interest in the PPC and in the universe created by Jay and Acacia (yeah, I know... that&#39;s pathetic). So this is certainly not something I will have a hand in. Just an idea, nothing more.<br><br>While reading some of the old missions by Jay and Acacia, it struck me that this stuff is much more addictive and original than many of the professionally written novels you find on the shelves. It is not deep, but it is very funny and light-hearted, and it features great characters in a great setting. Once you start reading, it is hard to stop. The original series is nothing short of brilliant, and even though Jay and Acacia are no longer with us, some of us may have what it takes to aim higher. I&#39;m not saying that a novel written by PPCers would have any success, but getting something published is already quite an accomplishment — and not, I think, one that is out of reach for the best of us.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s funny, with characters you know and care about... But they are, whatever else, fanfiction characters. They therefore have no sellable characteristics, because you cannot legitimately sell fanfiction.<br><br>Jay and Acacia are a dynamic that work. That doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re characters with a plot that works - not one that could be sold. This stuff works because we&#39;re all a part of it and we all see it and we all recognise it. That doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s a non-derivative story in it. Jay and Acacia and their idea works <i>within</i> the bounds of fanfic; it works online where we all know the boundaries. But there isn&#39;t a <i>plot</i> behind Jay and Acacia. There isn&#39;t a story about them that needs to be told. The only story to tell draws far too heavily on copyrighted subjects. So we leave well be.</p>

            <p>I just want to say, ahead of time, that if I stepped on anybody&#39;s toes with all the various references in my stories, then I&#39;m sorry. I like stories with an emphasis on continuity, that can dredge up something nigh forgotten at any time, and that&#39;s what I was trying to do, because those are the stories and storytellers I admire. I used things like Schlect, King Kong Comma, and the All-Purpose Department because I was fairly sure no one else would if I didn&#39;t, but if someone did, and I created a plothole, I apologize.<br><br>Oh, P.S. Does the PPC issue Megazords? Power Rangers has more Sues than is commonly thought, and I can think of no less than three situations (a team of Sues with their own Zord, Sue co-opts an existing Zord, Sue is a Monster) where a big robot would come in handy.</p>

            <p>That is, basically, the direction my fic is going... basically in a few directions:<br><br>-After everything is settled, Simmons reveals that the guys in charge of the codenames (the NBE label having been scrapped) are both Herberttes and have, I quote, &quot;A sick sense of humour&quot; in giving certain characters near-prphetic labels.<br><br>-the effect of a humanized Allspark (in the baby) going off is signified by the eyes becoming an incandesant blue-within-blue, and a blue that is closer to autobot optics than the human shade.<br><br>-Starscream is still going to be an underhanded backstabber in this version, but more by sin of ommission than outright deceit:  letting Prime and his group hurl themselves against the Big Bad, get scragged, the &#39;Cons stay back and beat the the Bad through technology, hail Optimus and the Autobots as martyrs in public while being glad that they&#39;re out of the picture.  Mix this in with a bit of religous fanaticism based in his &quot;former life&quot; and you&#39;re dealing with a dangerous enemy and an even more dangerous ally.<br><br>But besides that, I just finished up by first big fight scene and I&#39;d like some constructive criticism, so, if people would be so kind as to review, heres the obligatory shameless pluggage:<br><br><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/transficsation/429748.html"><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/transficsation/429748.html">http://community.livejournal.com/transficsation/429748.html</a></a><br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4695216/9/Transformers_Starscream_Ascendant"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4695216/9/Transformers_Starscream_Ascendant">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4695216/9/Transformers_Starscream_Ascendant</a></a><br><br>I hope you enjoy... and if anything is too egregious, let me know.<br><br></p>

            <p>Well, if the canon&#39;s not actually meant to be dead, and is being killed in the background, I&#39;d suggest one or both of your agents taking a detour and saving said canon. But if worse comes to worst, just get the corpse to Medical quickly. </p>

            <p>Because as I said, this happens in the second paragraph of the story. So it kind of comes at you right out of the gate.<br><br>I figured that was what would be the case (I really don&#39;t like this story, either. Sokka&#39;s death, along with the complete derailment of the entire finale of the show, is only serving as a momentary excuse to launch into full-blown Royal Family incest. YECH).</p>

            <p>Canons can be resurrected if killed when they&#39;re not supposed to be. The Disturbing Acts of Violence Department covered this one once. The explanation for it is that the Canon character only thinks they&#39;re dead, but if the cause of death is fixed, they can be resurrected and put back into their homeworld as if nothing had happened.</p>

            <p>Dunno anything about the given canon, though the mission still seems to be pretty good. Nice work. Out of curiosity, just how tall is this Prophet Velen supposed to be exactly? Also, I seem to be unable to find the continuum&#39;s mini-type in the mission for some reason or other, probably general inattentiveness...<br><br>Is that FFN profile you posted in the guestbook of the Link&#39;s Queen shrine really LQ?

            <p>1) The average draenei seems to be somewhere between 7&#39; and 7&#39;6&quot; (males are not much taller than females, although they&#39;re much bulkier).  Prophet Velen is described as towering at least a half head over the tallest of his guards.  In game...<a href="http://i39.tinypic.com/70kyer.jpg">well, here</a> <a href="http://i42.tinypic.com/20qg8iu.jpg">you go</a>.<br><br>2) They got into the story and out before the Wrath Cadets actually spawned.  If the consequences of such actions are unknown, I&#39;d be glad to write &#39;em.<br><br>3) I believe it <i>was</i> LQ at one point.  Not sure what it is now.</p>

            <p>Seeing as nobody&#39;s done it yet... *drags out Big Bag O&#39; Links*<br><br>First off is the link to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">Wiki</a>, a veritable fount of information for a newbie to read through. Especially helpful for you if you want to write missions would be the page on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> (note the capital P).<br><br>I would advise against reading any <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>, unless you are of strong mind and stomach. Even the summaries have been known to give those of weaker constitution nightmares.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, not knowing what you have already managed to find, I have several links for you. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek) is a good place to start, as the PPC did many aeons ago. <s>What do you mean I&#39;m exaggerating?</s> The <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">Department of Geographical Aberrations</a> is another interesting place to visit, if you have the time and inclination. Also by hS is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/index.htm">Tangled Webs</a> site, which contains backstory for the PPC as an organisation. If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be. And last, but most definitely not least, <a href="http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/65922.html">Response Centre 45</a> is where Trojie and Pads&#39; missions are archived.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay here.

            <p>I&#39;m trying to sort tickets to go and see my sister next month. The way there&#39;s alright - five hour break between buses, which is plenty of time to work out how the hell to get from London St Pancras to Victoria coach station. The way back&#39;s a bit more troublesome - it&#39;s the same journey in reverse but with only an hour available. Given that London confuses the hell out of me and the odds of me getting hopelessly lost are reasonably high, does anyone know if I can actually make that journey in the allotted hour? tfl.gov.uk is being spectacularly unhelpful in working this out.</p>

            <p>My account got half-drained on Friday thanks to Star Trek and a game I&#39;d preordered (down Ј76 in an hour). In three weeks, I&#39;ll be drained again when I buy the DSi to <i>play</i> said game. Then, every few weeks, I&#39;ll be spending more money on Xbox games. I suck with money.

            <p>You&#39;ll be pushing it.  If there&#39;s any delays, you&#39;ll be in trouble.  Victoria -st pancras on the Victoria line only takes twenty minutes/half an hour (did it every weekend last summer), but add ~20 minutes to walk from the coach station.<br><br>But, yeah, as hS said, get the Victoria line, and it&#39;s a straight trip.  Since you&#39;ll have already done it one way you shouldn&#39;t have to worry about getting lost.  Make sure you check the closures the week before hand - they have a tendency to take out the tube you need when you need it, and it&#39;s always better to know before you get to the station and have to suddenly backtrack.  </p>

            <p>...If I remember correctly, anyway.  XD  Depends if it&#39;s a decent time of day, of course, but if you do get stuck it might be worth it.<br><br>Generally, if there&#39;s closures, they just give you a list, which is why it&#39;s useful to check in advance.  That way you can plan an alternate route.  It might just be a case of, Victoria line&#39;s closed, get the Circle line instead (or, if you&#39;re lucky, there&#39;ll be no closures and you can go straight through).  What I normally do if there&#39;s lots of closures is print off a tube map, mark off the stations/lines that are down and then go from there.<br><br>Also, with tickets, there&#39;s normally quite a big queue at Kings Cross.  The machines/booths are right next to the entrance to the Victoria line, though, so easy to spot (you have to go past them on the way down from Kings Cross, but I&#39;m not sure about St. Pancras).  I&#39;d suggest getting an oyster card, though.  If you go to one of the desks with actual people, you&#39;ll be able to get one.  It&#39;s cheaper, and means you won&#39;t have to worry about buying a ticket on the way back.<br><br>There&#39;s also tickets machines/booths in the overground stations, which are generally less busy, but way more complicated.  And I&#39;m not sure if the ones in St Pancras/Kings Cross do underground tickets (I assume they do, but I know that the Victoria ones do).<br><br>London isn&#39;t so bad as long as you can read the tube maps.  XD  First time I went there alone, I got completely lost, but still managed to get home safely.<br><br>(By the way, &quot;shanks&#39; pony&quot;?)</p>

            <p>An oyster card? Is that like the lobster card they mentioned in the Easter special of Doctor Who?

            <p>It runs in a loop (hence Circle) that goes through both King&#39;s Cross St Pancras station and Victoria station. KCStP is linked directly to St Pancras main-line station, and Victoria is half a mile north-east of the coach station. On the way there you&#39;ll need to make sure you head for Victoria coach station rather than Victoria bus station (which is local), and on the way back... it /should/ take about half an hour to go round the Circle line, so you should be okay.<br><br>Alternately, you could take the Victoria line, which runs from KCStP to Victoria in about a third of the distance. Given how often the Circle line is closed for works, thaaaat&#39;s probably a better bet. And faster, too.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>There should be security guards around, but in all honesty, the best thing is to look for signs for Victoria Line {(Southbound) in KCStP, (Northbound) in Victoria}.

            <p>Seeing as nobody&#39;s done it yet... *drags out Big Bag O&#39; Links*<br><br>First off is the link to <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">the Wiki</a>, a veritable fount of information for a newbie to read through. Especially helpful for you if you want to write missions would be the page on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> (note the capital P).<br><br>I would advise against reading any <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>, unless you are of strong mind and stomach. Even the summaries have been known to give those of weaker constitution nightmares.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, not knowing what you have already managed to find, I have several links for you. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek) is a good place to start, as the PPC did many aeons ago. <s>What do you mean I&#39;m exaggerating?</s> The <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">Department of Geographical Aberrations</a> is another interesting place to visit, if you have the time and inclination. Also by hS is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/index.htm">Tangled Webs</a> site, which contains backstory for the PPC as an organisation. If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be. And last, but most definitely not least, <a href="http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/65922.html">Response Centre 45</a> is where Trojie and Pads&#39; missions are archived.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay here.

            <p>*bangs head against wall, keyboard and other hard objects*  Can I kill it?  Or do you want to join the Warriors division at least part-time?  Either way, Kierra wants the pelts to make a far too brightly-colored rug out of.  Why do people do this to us?  I advise, since it seems to be a live clan, or at least acts like one, steal any redeemable cats, and then blow the place up.  I don&#39;t care if they are dead, somebody is going to kill them again.  If they have somewhat canonical names and aren&#39;t complete sues, Nocia can work on rehabilitating them.  Also the kits might be okay if they don&#39;t have stupid fur colors or if the canon snaps them to regular cat colors.  *stabs pillow in lieu of fic&#39;s author*</p>

            <p>Triple mission plug! As usually happens to us, we start missions in a reasonably regular and orderly fashion, but are stymied by two things - our apparent inability to work unless we&#39;re under pressure, and our kamikaze muse who buggers off for weeks on end and then suddenly swoops in and compels us to finish everything we have on the books at once. So, for those of you who&#39;re curious about what our characters have been up to since February, may we present you with the adventures of Veridian and Stevius in the disturbing world of Narnian RPS:<br><br><a href="http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/85271.html"><a href="http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/85271.html">http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/85271.html</a></a> (warnings - awful SPaG, fluff, underage)<br><br><a href="http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/85577.html"><a href="http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/85577.html">http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/85577.html</a></a> (warnings - dub-con, age-gap, first-time-fic)<br><br>And Trojie, Pads and Oscar&#39;s gallivant through the Jurassic Park-verse:<br><br><a href="http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/85191.html"><a href="http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/85191.html">http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/85191.html</a></a> (warnings - underage, bestiality, rape)<br><br>It goes reasonably without saying that these missions are NSFW and NSFB, and all three are R-rated. </p>

            <p>Dunno ... I picked it up somewhere and have used it ever since. I always think of what our agents do as &#39;the Duty&#39;, which is, funnily enough, what the Death of the Discworld calls HIS job ... and is probably where I got it from.</p>
