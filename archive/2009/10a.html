            <p>Um. So, my LJ got found by one of my officemates, because I managed to forget to f-lock a post that involved something he&#39;s researching, so of course he found it when he Googled it.<br><br>This is Bad. <br><br>Y&#39;know what&#39;s on my LJ? ... quite a lot of quite explicit slash. Yeah.<br><br>I&#39;m going to be moving to Dreamwidth, getting a separate journal for my personal stuff, and basically dumping my LJ. It&#39;s a case of duck and cover, stop drop roll, all that stuff.<br><br>So, if you&#39;re on my flist, don&#39;t panic, I&#39;m not dead, I&#39;m just hiding in a bunker. Everything&#39;s been either f-locked or private-locked for now and I get to spend tomorrow setting up a DW account and moving everything.<br><br>So, none of the links to missions that are on my LJ will be working on the Wiki for a while. I&#39;ll change them all when I get it all sorted.<br><br>- Trojie, currently freaking out</p>

            <p>So, we&#39;ve got two shiny new dreamwidth journals set up, one for fanfic (gmtaslash.dreamwidth.org), and one for missions (rc45.dreamwidth.org). Both imported fine, although now we&#39;re faced with the lengthy task of going through and deleting everything irrelevant. Also, the amount of a href links that will need fixing is phenomenal. <br><br>There is one thing you (general you) could do to help if you&#39;ve got time: there are close to sixty mission links, plus various interludes, MSTs, AHAIRQL matches and the like, listed on the wiki that all point to the now-locked lj. All of these links will need changing to point to the appropriate shiny new dreamwidth entry. Said entries should be easy to find, since everything that was imported was locked and we&#39;re only unlocking the missions (although they&#39;re not all unlocked yet - Trojie&#39;s currently working her way through them). So, if anyone&#39;s got some time to kill and fancies a spot of wiki editing... *puppy eyes*<br><br>Pages I can think of off the top of my hand that will have links to be changed:<br>Trojanhorse; Paddlebrains; Oscar Henson; Iza; Stevius; Veridian Green; Marsha; Katie Cray; Gypsy; Lasa; Montbretia Tornquist.<br><br>*disappears to continue the laborious process of sorting the new fic journal*</p>

            <p>I have a similar problem with my MSTing of a fic involving lemony bits with an underage character. If it was illegal to do that someone would have told me so by now, and given that A) the characters are blatantly fictional, B) I didn&#39;t write the fic in question and I said so, C) the reason I&#39;m quoting it is to point out how bad the writing is and I made it abundantly clear that that was the reason, D) nobody arrested Stephen King for that scene in &quot;It&quot;, I REALLY don&#39;t think it&#39;d have any legal repercussions other than possibly &quot;oi, stop copy-pasting other peoples&#39; work&quot; and given that it&#39;s a fanfic even that doesn&#39;t really apply, but I&#39;d still like to keep it away from people who would give me funny looks over it, like my student counsellor.</p>

            <p>... I have to work with him, and will do for the rest of my life. NZ geology and palaeontology isn&#39;t such a big field that I can risk making a huge deal of this. It&#39;s best to just let it blow over, which I am doing. If he and I fell out over it, not only would I end up losing a mate (yes, a mate who&#39;s currently being a dickhead, I know) but also a potential collaborator and someone who would then in the future probably be in the right place to, if he so chose, reject any of my academic papers that came his way for review. Not that I think he *would*, but it&#39;s worth bearing in mind.<br><br>I appreciate the sentiment a lot, just so you know. But duck and cover is still my best option :)</p>

            <p>Dreamwidth allows us to import a friendslist and basically means you&#39;ll still see our posts on your lj flist, and will have permission to comment on them on dw even if they&#39;re locked. So it shouldn&#39;t be too much of a bother, really.<br><br>As for the tracing Trojie back, I think the most important thing is getting the porn separated from the uni-related posts. If each is on a separate account, and the two aren&#39;t linked, then even if someone knows it&#39;s the same person posting, it&#39;s hardly sullying the good name of Trojie&#39;s uni, and what she posts on her own time is, obviously, her own business. And I always post the porn if she&#39;s at work anyway, so that&#39;s alright.<br><br>Also, we&#39;d been meaning to tidy up that lj for a while anyway - for a start, Trojie doesn&#39;t like having her fanfic and her PPC missions all mixed up together and on an account she uses on various comms both to post fic and to find badfic. This has just meant we&#39;ve had to get on with the process rather sooner than intended, that&#39;s all.<br><br>I&#39;m in the process of importing the missions to a dreamwidth account; we&#39;ve gone with rc45 as a username, if anyone wants to add it. There&#39;ll be a separate journal for other fanfic too.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve never used it either. Got an account but never needed it. Only one of my contacts has switched over to dw, and they&#39;ve got their flist imported so I miss nothing, which is how I know that&#39;s possible. At any rate, I&#39;m going to be thrown in at the deep end as soon as the import&#39;s finished, because there&#39;s going to be a <i>lot</i> of tidying up to do.</p>

            <p>Hello. Sorry to bother you all, but Cassie and I finished another mission not too long ago, and our usual beta is unavailable at this time, so is there anyone here who wouldn&#39;t mind betaing? I know people tend to be busy around this time of year, but we really could use one, so I figured I&#39;d ask. I know it&#39;s rather brief, but there&#39;s really not much to say. Thanks for your time, and we&#39;ll have it up soon after a beta&#39;s had a look-over.</p>

            <p>Cass told me some of the stuff that was going on, so I suggested we clean it up a bit, work on some other stuff, then ask for another beta to give you time to sort all that out.

            <p>Well, I was intending to get on with a beta for Lily Winterwood this evening, and then I&#39;d be free to go over yours, as I skipped seeing either parent today because I sense an incoming lurgy and have no wish to spread swine flu round Hull Royal Infirmary. But then the post above this thread happened, so that&#39;s eating up my time. In better news, there&#39;s talk of my dad being allowed home at the weekend, so that&#39;ll free up some time. SO I&#39;ll see what I can do over the weekend, but no promises.</p>

            <p>but I&#39;m pretty sure that there isn&#39;t a command word for a given type of magic items, only a potentially different one for each magic item.

            <p>Another HFA chapter? That&#39;s awesome! I&#39;ve read the first HFA and loved it (*bows to you*), but I haven&#39;t quite gotten around to reading the other one. I will read it, though, when I get a chance. (I can&#39;t help with the beta thing, sorry. I don&#39;t read manga that much.) </p>

            <p>It always amazes me when people think that they can make a show where the main characters fight with edged weapons &quot;bloodless&quot;.

            <p>They put out official subs every week, I think, or they were. Only available if you live in America though, which resulted in many irritated people outside of the States and thus no decrease in fansubbing of the series. There was even a proper, subbed DVD of the first three eps shown at ComicCon this year, which was awesome.<br><br>*wanders off to LJ comm*<br><br>Yeah, the majority of the dub cast has <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/fm_alchemist/6484885.html">already been announced</a>.<br><br>Oh, this was the channel messing around and editing the show on top of what the American censors had already done to it. They pretty much made Naruto unwatchable for me, even if I had been able to overlook the voice acting. And they weren&#39;t fighting with edged weapons, because there were no edged weapons, or even blunt weapons for that matter, in sight. Stupid censors. It wasn&#39;t like they were putting it on in the middle of the day. It was <i>after</i> the watershed.</p>

            <p>They&#39;re weapons, um, &quot;borrowed&quot; from a Sue. They&#39;ve been modified so that they can fight against Sues. Go figure. (In other words, yes.

            <p>Why would they slow down in zero gravity?  That would actually be easier to aim, as there&#39;s no atmosphere to affect your aim and no gravity to arc the arrow.  And it&#39;s frictionless once it leaves the bow, there&#39;d be absolutely no change until it hit something.</p>

Imagine Narnia with all the Christian symbolism replaced with seventies rock music.<br><br>Whatever Chaser Wolf thought, Mudge never did screw the unicorn, in case you&#39;re wondering. Shame, but there you go. I doubt he&#39;d want to be related to a Skipper of Otters either, Mossflower&#39;s otters are too darn goody-goody. Reminds me, I was thinking when my exorcists kill that fic (gotta do it sometime) they portal back into the Spellsinger universe to check that everything&#39;s normal there, and Stormsong accidentally discovers he can spellsing. It&#39;ll only work in the Spellsingerverse, because otherwise A) he&#39;d suddenly be ridiculously overpowerful and B) causing magical effects whenever one sings would actually be horrifically inconvenient, but if there&#39;s a suitably big canon break while he&#39;s at work it may start working again because of the damage to the fabric of reality. Or something. I thought it&#39;d be funny, anyway.</p>

            <p>... I&#39;ve only been a non-teen for a fortnight or so (I turned twenty on the 17th), so close enough, and I was a teen while I was reading them for the first time <sup>_^</sup> I just got the seventh book out of the eight in the series (&quot;Son of Spellsinger&quot;) with my birthday money. Yay!<br><br>Y&#39;know, it&#39;s fun to see if one can come up with songs which would be suitable for casting certain spells. I gotta admit I&#39;m not good at that because most of my favourite songs are by the Decemberists, who mostly do songs about gory deaths or the hard lives of the poor or tragic love or similar fun topics, all set to inappropriately happy tunes. (For example, &quot;The Chimbley Sweep&quot; has the catchiest tune ever but the lyrics are really depressing - I&#39;m still wondering whether it&#39;s actually supposed to be about an underage male prostitute, because the last verse sure sounds like it, but they&#39;re still depressing even if it isn&#39;t.) Most of them wouldn&#39;t be much use for spell casting. I&#39;d particularly struggle at the points in the later books when Jon-Tom tries to conjure up a boat, because all the songs I know about boats and ships involve them sinking ...</p>

            <p>Happy belated birthday!<br>Anyway, I just suck at writing lyrics, and I say that without any regret.  Every so often I go back and read what I wrote for my Redwall fanfic, and every time I do it makes me wince something terrible.</p>

May contain spoilers.<br><br>The Spellsingers don&#39;t have to write lyrics, they can just pick appropriate songs that they already know. Jon-Tom discovers his power by playing &quot;Purple Haze&quot; and getting a lot of purple smoke. I know a few which would be useful during a battle (Heather Alexander&#39;s &quot;March of Cambreadth&quot;, Slipknot&#39;s &quot;Pulse of the Maggots&quot;, etc) but in everyday circumstances ... I could get Jon-Tom home, though. See &quot;Los Angeles, I&#39;m Yours&quot;; if it didn&#39;t bring him home, it&#39;d make him stop wanting to go back there. (It&#39;s a Decemberists song about how horrible Los Angeles is. Yeah, they&#39;re a weird band.)</p>

            <p>Go read the main TVTropes.org page, it&#39;ll help you get a lot of injokes in fandom-type circles.<br><br>&quot;Culling of the Fold&quot; might be useful for an assassination, but beyond that I can think of no practical use for any Decemberists songs unless one finds oneself in dire need of an 1800s hooker (well, Mudge could probably find a use for one) or a giant ship-eating whale. Why are all my favourite songs depressing or violent? No wonder I had so many emotional problems in my teen years. Nine Inch Nails is pretty useless too. I could probably eventually find a song for any situation, but what impresses me about Jon-Tom is that he does it WITHOUT the benefit of a lyrics website with a search engine.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s just that in some parts of the united states, 16 is when you can get your drivers license. So in the event that the parents have more money than sense, they may give a car on the 16th birthday.</p>

If anyone sounds interested, despite the fact that I haven&#39;t mentioned anything possibly related to it last year (Okay, that was another, discontinued, fic project, but notice that I said possibly); please email me.
