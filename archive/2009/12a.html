            <p>After an incident on my fic journal where a parent caught their child looking at one of my more adult stories, I&#39;ve decided to put a disclaimer on my pinned archive post. Problem is, I don&#39;t generally bother with this sort of thing, so I don&#39;t know what to put. This is what I&#39;ve scribbled out so far, but advice on if anything else is needed would be appreciated.<br><br>--<br><br><font size="4"><b><u>General Disclaimer:</u></b></font> This journal contains works of <b>fiction</b> unsuited to those under the age of eighteen, or the equivalent age of majority in the country that the reader originates from. All characters involved in these works are considered to be over the age of eighteen, unless stated otherwise. If you are reading this statement then you have stated at least once before reaching this page that you are over the age of eighteen. <font size="3">I take no responsibility for the actions of others in reaching this archive. If you, or someone you have responsibility for, lies about their age to access the stories contained here, then they are the ones who have perjured themselves. <b>I can take no responsibility for the actions of people separated from me by up to thousands of miles.</b></font> Themes contained within these works of fiction include, but are not limited to, graphic male/male sex, bondage, torture and issues of dubious consent and non-consensual sex (rape).

            <p>It sucks that you need a disclaimer to point out that you are not responsible for people lying about their age.<br><br>I would take out the part from &quot;I take no&quot; to &quot; thousands of miles&quot;. People who deliberately read past two or more age warnings are not going to be bothered whether or not that is your responsibility (it is, it&#39;s never their fault /irony), and it kind of takes away the will for anyone else to read further. Whereas I think that the section on themes is important to be read. Perhaps you could even off-set the last two sentences in their own paragraph.<br><br>Hope you&#39;ll be spared this kind of asshattery in future.</p>

            <p>It isn&#39;t aimed at the people who lie about their age to gain access to that journal. That would be rather hypocritical of me. It&#39;s aimed at pissy mothers who try to place the blame on me for their children reading my fics. That sentence is there because the woman was basically saying that <i>I</i> was the one at fault.<br><br>I think I will put those last two sentences in a separate paragraph. And maybe move the bit about the themes so it&#39;s the second sentence. That sentence you pointed out... it is a bit strong though, and redundant really. And, although the Board seems to have lost that coding, it&#39;s in size=3 font on the actual post.<br><br>Thanks for the help.</p>

            <p>Might want to make it a bit shorter, though. Essays worth of disclaimers tend to be irritating after a while, especially if it sounds defensive. Also, people are more likely to read something short.</p>

            <p>That <i>is</i> the condensed version though. The original was several paragraphs long, had several all caps sections, rather more bolding and was mostly set to size=3 and size=4 font. This is the edited one from after I calmed down a lot.</p>

            <p>Back in March, Trojie and I wrote a mission for <i>Wicked</i>. Aside from missing a beta-read and needing a lot of technical fix-ups later, it was a standard job... until I re-read it and realised that we&#39;d neglected something. I&#39;ve written this itty bitty coda and affixed it to the mission itself, but in case anyone&#39;s interested, or actually remembers said mission, I thought I&#39;d post it here, too. Trojie approves.<br><br>(<a href="http://sedri.livejournal.com/36275.html">Original Mission: &quot;Worth Loathing&quot;</a>)<br><br><br>Nine hours – or maybe months – later, a shiny blue portal sprung silently to life in a generic dormitory in Shiz University. Agent Sedri stepped through, scowling and muttering something like, &quot;...such an <i>idiot</i>... should&#39;ve learned <i>last</i> time...&quot;<br><br>Avaric lay sleeping quietly, looking nothing like the cocky and immature rapist he&#39;d been written to be, and had been left as by the agents who had somehow forgotten about him during their merry murder and exorcisms. He was a difficult character to class as either replacement or OOC, given that his personality was so poorly defined, but as there was another Avaric sleeping in a nearby plothole, it was rather easy to decide the fate of this particular manifestation.<br><br>A <i>swish</i>, a stab, a gurgle and a <i>thump</i> later, one very ticked-off agent left the dorm again, hauling a body-bag that left red streaks on the floor behind her.<br><br>Her faithful Capillary Towel followed, wiping up the mess.</p>

            <p>Hong Kong? Nice. My uncle and his family live there, and a few of the people in my Japanese class hail from Hong Kong :D<br><br>I comes bearing links. *drags out Big Bag O&#39; Links and digs through it*<br><br>First off is the link to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">Wiki</a>, a veritable fount of information for a newbie to read through. Especially helpful for you if you want to write missions would be the page on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> (note the capital P).<br><br>I would advise against reading any <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>, unless you are of strong mind and stomach. Even the summaries have been known to give those of weaker constitution nightmares.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, not knowing what you have already managed to find, I have several links for you. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek) is a good place to start, as the PPC did many aeons ago. <s>What do you mean I&#39;m exaggerating?</s> <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">The Department of Geographical Aberrations</a> is another interesting place to visit, if you have the time and inclination. Also by hS is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/index.htm">Tangled Webs</a> site, which contains backstory for the PPC as an organisation. If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be. And last, but most definitely not least, <a href="http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/65922.html">Response Centre 45</a> is where Trojie and Pads&#39; missions are archived.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay here.

            <p>EMP, if properly done, PERMANENTLY fries your circuitry. K-9 may or may not be shielded, but it has to be fairly specialized--and very strong--shielding.

            <p>Lol, I had the project going last summer to come up with a comprehensive plan to take down the Borg. One part (and only one, mind you) of it was to take them down on a cube-by-cube basis by sabotaging their fusion reactors--and the EMFs containing them--to create a huge EMP that would hopefully fry all the mechanical tech in their entire ship. That&#39;s the only reason why I know so much about EMP at all. XD So I&#39;m glad to have the info be useful!</p>

            <p>If you could get to the reactor, couldn&#39;t you just blow it up and let the Borg on board the cube just sit there until they died? If that wasn&#39;t an option, you could just knock out the reactor and shoot the now-unshielded cube a lot.<br><br>Seems like that would take less effort.</p>

            <p>Not necessarily. (Though maybe.) Remember their tech regenerates itself? That&#39;s why using lots of firepower didn&#39;t work for the Federation. The idea is that the EMP wouldn&#39;t damage the tech so much as incapacitate it, thus possibly knocking out its regeneration ability, or at least causing serious enough damage to delay it long enough to take it out with conventional guns and stuff, like you said. None of which would necessarily take it out anyway, but like I said, it was only one part of a bigger plan. The Borg were designed as this completely unstoppable Juggernaut, which is why it&#39;s fun to come up with ideas for killing them.<br><br>Yes I am a big big dork. XD</p>

            <p>As far as I know, EMP works by inducing high voltage currents in electronics, permanently frying any integrated circuitry not shielded by a Faraday cage. Which the K-9 may or may not have. It&#39;s not so rare; Your cell phone has that kind of shielding, to keep out interference from--for example--your microwave. And Titan probably has a lot of ambient electromagnetic radiation, so K-9 may have been built with shielding. The shielding in your cell phone wouldn&#39;t be strong enough to help against an EMP, though, and it&#39;s a toss up as to whether K-9&#39;s would have any effect.<br><br>But anyway, the classic way to get an EMP is to get a big explosion (nuclear, usually) and let the Earth&#39;s electromagnetic field freak out and do the work for you. But (IIRC) the explosion has to take place very high in the atmosphere, so that the air particles have time to do their thing. So in close quarters like HQ, the canon character would have more success just setting up a fluctuating magnetic field, which he/she could probably jury rig a device to do from spare parts in the DSAT, if he/she knew how to do so. (Something possibly involving either a microwave/something that emits microwaves, or a fusion generator of some kind. I couldn&#39;t tell you the specifics.) Lightning strikes also generate EMPs; one fried my computer once. And that strong of an electromagnetic field can be really painful if it&#39;s very local or directed. It&#39;d probably make anyone in the area throw up from vertigo, at least.<br><br>But this seems more promising to me: If you get a light one--not an electromagnetic pulse, but a strong electromagnetic field--probably all it&#39;d do is make his circuits temporarily freak out and wipe his hard drive. See the Supernatural episode Ghostfacers for an example: Dean jury rigs a big electromagnet--I think from a car battery, but I don&#39;t remember--sticks it in a duffel bag and sets it on a timer so that a few minutes after they leave, it goes off and wipes all the hard drives in the area. :D If something like that was used against your K-9, it would probably wipe his programming, but not affect his circuits. (That&#39;s assuming he&#39;s not shielded, because if he is it may not have any effect, depending on the strength of the shielding.) If he&#39;s anything like normal computers, he might have limited function from the BIOS, which is programmed directly into the circuitry. Either way, he&#39;d be quite thoroughly incapacitated, but easily recoverable so long as somebody had a backup of his programming. (If not, or if the backup was incomplete, you could have some fun with the followup of him acting really weird and buggy as they tried to fine-tune his programming.)</p>

            <p>Does K-9 have an off switch? Maybe a reset button? Or they could take the batteries out, I suppose. Although that could be difficult, since I seem to recall K-9 firing lasers at Giles at one point. Hmm.</p>

            <p>Hello.

I think I did pretty well (Don&#39;t find it though, I&#39;ll hate you for it).<br><br>I also have got a rather large original story in my head. I want to keep it a surprise, so I&#39;m not going to say much more about it other than that it&#39;ll be one of the more major points in my PPC writing.<br><br>Speaking of my PPC writing, I&#39;ve already got some done, and have about 2 or 3 agents written down already... The more sinister side of the PPC is also a central role in my PPC related writing, portraying it as slightly more destructive and manipulating than what I&#39;ve seen everyone else write it like. And each of the stories I&#39;ve written down are far larger than a mission, rather they&#39;re more like a series of missions with original stuff interspersed inside every now and then.<br><br>...And that brings me to why I&#39;m here:<br><br>1. I want permission.<br>2. I want to show off some of my writing, which I will if I have to do so in order to get said permission.<br>3. I&#39;ll improve my writing doing this, and get lulz in the process.<br><br>...I hate introductions...</p>

            <p>Greetings, life-form.  I come bearing dice.  You now have a full set...if a full set means 300 d12&#39;s and a d30.<br><br>I am fairly new here, but I have to say...some of what I see has me worried.  I think that you should listen to the advice of Neshomeh and the rest and run your ideas past someone who has been around awhile.

            <p>... using your ideas for an original work, rather than a PPC-based one? I don&#39;t want to discourage you from joining or writing PPC-based stuff, but we decided as a community some while back that we&#39;d had enough world-shaking events, and though I can&#39;t speak for the whole Board, my personal feeling is that what you&#39;re describing is more complicated than we&#39;re prepared to deal with right now. (I hope other people will speak up on the matter one way or another.)<br><br>This community was founded on a love of canon and light-hearted sporking. I don&#39;t know which PPC missions you&#39;ve read, but you <i>should</i> read the Original Series, which is here: <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html"><a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html</a></a><br><br>Also, this is the article on Permission that Pads mentioned: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission</a></a><br><br>And finally, first poke! *pokes*<br><br>Welcome!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I did read the Original series, it was a good use of some time a while ago I&#39;ve also read a couple other ones.<br><br>Yes, I know, the Genesis are a bit too crazy for this. I should have kept that one to myself, despite them being really cool and all. Forget everything I said about them.<br><br>Omega is fine though. I never liked that idea much.<br><br>As for my overly serious tone compared to the other stories, I guess that&#39;s just how I write. The world isn&#39;t a very nice place to me, and it shows in my writing. I&#39;m sorry if my writing feels out of place, but it&#39;s what I do.<br><br>I&#39;ve also managed to create a Sonichu article on the PPC wiki.

            <p>Trust me. The world can be a really shitty place-- I know what you mean. It hasn&#39;t been the greatest life for me, either. But the best way, in my experience, to make things that much more bearable is to laugh them off. Or at least laugh at them. If you&#39;re walking home from work, and it&#39;s sleeting and snowing and raining, all at once, and a truck goes by and soaks you to the bone, it sucks, but if you&#39;re laughing, it takes a little of the sting out of it. Life&#39;s easier if you can laugh at yourself. Fumble a catch, stumble in your graceful catwalk, hell, spill ketchup all over your new shirt. It&#39;s easier if you can laugh.<br><br>Terry Pratchett&#39;s a good example-- his world can get pretty dark, but the sense of humor comes through anyway. That&#39;s like the PPC, a lot. It&#39;s not necessarily a cheerfulhappylovely place, but that doesn&#39;t mean it has to be all drama and angst.</p>

            <p>...but it&#39;s not how we write. And it&#39;s not what we at the PPC are about. I have nothing against serious stories, but if you want to write a spin-off that becomes part of the PPC universe, you can&#39;t take your story (or your characters) too seriously. <br><br>To quote Neshomeh from an earlier post: <br><br>&quot;On that note, I&#39;d like to talk about the spirit with which the PPC was intended. I&#39;ve noticed a disturbing trend among newer members toward levels of power and aggression, completely unmitigated by an appreciable sense of humor, that I have no doubt would make Jay and Acacia regret ever leaving the PPC for others to write about.<br><br>Get this into your heads: The PPC is NOT about who can be the coolest, most badass agent. It is NOT about who has the biggest, most explosive toys. It is NOT about who can handle the most disgusting smutfic. It is NOT about doing something that no one has done before. It is NOT, and I stress this in particular, about making sense.<br><br>The PPC, in a nutshell, is NOT a pissing contest.<br><br>The PPC is about humor, good writing, humor, good writing, and, yes, humor. If your goal is anything but both humor and good writing, then please go away. I&#39;m serious about this. I like seeing new people come in, I really do, but I&#39;m sick of people thinking they need to improve the PPC, be it with novelty, expansion, logic, or anything else.&quot;<br><br>So, welcome to the Board...and I would like to see what you have written so far before giving Permission.<br><br>~Araeph</p>

            <p>Welcome! And may I say it&#39;s excellent to see such enthusiasm. A few points:<br><br>1) I&#39;m sure someone will throw you the wiki link to Permission soon enough (I don&#39;t know the coding to embed it myself). The short version is: we don&#39;t just hand it out willy-nilly. You&#39;ll need to hang around for a month while we get to know you a bit first.<br><br>2) You will indeed have to show off your writing; how else can Permission-worthiness be judged, if not by checking your writing skills?<br><br>3) Most excellent reasons for writing. I heartily approve.<br><br>And a subsidiary 4) Tell us more about this sinister side. From what little you say it sounds like the sort of idea that could do to be run past the Board first.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s a rather gruesome transformation sequence from the second story:<br><br>_________________<strong><em><br>Falras contorts into a bizarre shape. His hind legs fold up, and shift position, so they&#39;re in between his four arms.<br><br>They stretch and warp, making snapping and cracking noises all the while. Metallic feathers rip out, making them look like wings.<br><br>His spine grows in length at an extreme speed. Gore spews out of the gaping hole in his backside. Metallic veins begin to run along the newly made structure, looking like highly elaborate barbed wire.<br><br>His fur falls off at an alarming rate. His ribcage bursts open, exposing organs and metal tubing. The abomination&#39;s hands fall off, and four massive blades sprout from his bloody wrists while the arms stretch and extend.<br><br>And finally, his skull crumbles into a puppet-like blob, resembling a human head. It is perfectly smooth and featureless, compared to the rest of the jagged, disgusting form...<br><br>Now he does not speak. Only the sound of extremely loud breathing comes from him. The exposed skeleton is a polished chrome, and it&#39;s flesh is a dull metallic gray...<br></em></strong>______________<br><br>That&#39;s a roughish draft of the transformation sequence. I&#39;m hoping to make it more disgusting/gruesome than it already is.<br><br>As for the question about the PPC being sinister and the like, that&#39;s going to be the main thing in the third story, which I&#39;ve only started. Some of the more familiar villains of the PPC will appear in the third one as well, as the other two that I&#39;ve got anything written for have new enemies.<br><br>The bizarre Genesis are ancient beings, older than the PPC or even World One. They used to be the natural protectors of the myriad continua that they themselves created until World One was created. When World One was formed, the Genesis flew into a rage, crippling all the worlds that they had created and going into hibernation until one of the worlds they had created was restored. They can travel in between continua, and speak of things such as the &quot;Natural Order&quot;, &quot;The Mother&quot; and &quot;The Grand Amalgam&quot; when they threaten and address the PPC.<br><br>There are two major threats in the second story that are new, at least to the PPC:<br><br>Omega are creatures that reproduce by destroying continua. They are the very threat the Genesis had to completely eradicate early on in the existence of everything itself. The transformation sequence I put up there earlier is a pretty good description of what one looks like. Poor Falras D:<br><br>And finally, The Grand Amalgam.<br><br>Mostly called that by the Genesis, it is better known to the PPC and World One as Sonichu, a webcomic that puts even the most disgusting of legendary badfic to shame. It must constantly absorb more continua in order to stay cohesive. If left to run, it would absorb all continua, and simply cease to exist due to the reality inside it being stretched to the very limit.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>Why the new line for every sentence? Why the present tense? If you must keep the present tense, that first &quot;so&quot; really doesn&#39;t fit.

            <p>Have you tried Google documents? It&#39;s an online word processor, that uses a lot less RAM than Word, doesn&#39;t eff up as often, saves all work online so documents don&#39;t take up hard drive space, can be accessed from any computer with an internet connection and, best of all to me, allows you to share documents for beta reading and cowriting. You can do spreadsheets and presentations on there as well.</p>

            <p>Our beloved Pads is fondly known as a Grammar Nazi for good reason. Don&#39;t take it personally.

We&#39;ve had people come in before with Very Big Ideas that were almost all politely turned down for reasons very similar to why I imagine yours will. It&#39;s very possible to redeem them, of course - ever Mary Sues can be redeemed - but... well, I think I&#39;ve said this already in my other post, so I won&#39;t repeat it.<br><br>Also, Pads, if you read this, I may have a very massive beta job coming up in a few weeks.

            <p>I read the first 2 chapters, which is pretty much what&#39;s out, and there are already the counselor on the Enterprise, the Sue and her family and friends (I skimmed through that), and I think the rest will come later. I had the link from a LJ comm of Data fans, one of the members posted links to her fic there. I think my Agents are going to kill the whole thing in desperation. Or whatever. (no, that doesn&#39;t mean What&#39; is going to commit suicide. Don&#39;t rejoice so fast.)<br>As for the House fic, it was a Sue who caught some disease when she was abducted and dragged in South America and who died (or was it her mother? I don&#39;t even remember), but it was all a dream! So she&#39;s saved in the end. And the Sue&#39;s mother was a childhood friend of House, back at a time when he was nice. Which makes the mother a Sue, too.</p>

            <p>Unm... hi. I&#39;m just starting out on here, but I&#39;ve been following the adventures of the PPC for a while now. <br><br>I like to write fanfics, and hope to become a published writer, but I still feel I can make improvements. But I have a considerable dislike of Mary Sues, as they make writing a good story... trickier, I guess. And they&#39;re really annoying.<br><br>Therefore, I have finally made a venture to post with the board (under a handle I hope is okay), bringing with me a humble offering of a list of horrendous badfic, that by all accounts and means, must die horribly: <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Horrible/Fanfic"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Horrible/Fanfic">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Horrible/Fanfic</a></a><br><br>I hope to really become a part of the PPC experience soon!</p>

            <p>Hey - I&#39;m new around here obviously... Found the PPC while research bad writing as a method of improving my work, I figured knowing what not to do always helps. =)<br><br>I&#39;m told by friends (adults and teens alike) that I&#39;m pretty good, but being that they are my friends I&#39;m concerned they might be biased so recently I&#39;ve been trying to seek additional opinions.<br><br>Currently I have three or four writing projects going at once, an original fiction I hope to someday get published as a novel, and a couple fanfics. I want to share my writing, but fear of becoming yet another suethor keeps me from showing off any of my recent writings, and I continually shoo readers away from my old stuff because it&#39;s just plain awful.<br><br>I suppose what I most need is a beta reader, preferably someone who knows the Assassin&#39;s Creed 2 fandom fairly well. Please? I need to be sure my OC isn&#39;t too Sue-ish before I can feel comfortable posting my writing anywhere. <sup><sup>;</sup></sup></p>

            <p>I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know that fandom, so I can&#39;t help you directly, but I commend your dedication. It took me about six years to swallow my perfectionistic fears and post my work, and it was only thanks to some very good &#39;net friends that I&#39;ve since built up my courage and am trusting myself - and yet I still find myself clinging to the feedback from my betas.<br><br>(By the way, you might want to start by changing &quot;research&quot; to &quot;research<i>ing</i>&quot; in your first line.)<br><br>As for your actual request, our community isn&#39;t exactly a free beta-reading service; we do favours for each other, yes, but generally our lives are busy and we stick to writing missions because that&#39;s what we love best. So it&#39;s really up for grabs as to whether anyone around here has both the time and background knowledge to give you a hand. If no one can help, might I suggest some other methods?<br><br>Firstly, there are various litmus tests around which you can take to help judge it yourself, some of which cater to original characters, which can therefore be adapted reasonably well to any fandom for which no specific test has been devised. A few seconds of googling found me <a href="http://www.springhole.net/quizzes/marysue.htm">this</a>, which looks pretty good, at first glance. If it doesn&#39;t work, just do some searching on &quot;Mary Sue litmus test&quot; until you find something that does work.<br><br>You could also browse around fanfic archives specific to Assassin&#39;s Creed and ask some active writers whose work you think well of if they would mind reading over yours and giving a brief opinion - most people, I&#39;ve found, are more than willing to give up a little time (especially if you compliment their work first, but I didn&#39;t say that).<br><br>Or, if there&#39;s absolutely no other option, you could simply dive in and see what happens. I suggest this, actually; the worst thing you could get is a bad review, but if you put a polite, succinct author&#39;s note at the start saying you would <i>really</i> appreciate honest feedback because you are <i>so</i> worries that your OC might have some Stu-traits, you will almost certainly get feedback. It won&#39;t all be good, but some will, and that&#39;s what you&#39;re after, right?<br><br>Also, if you&#39;re anything like I was seven years ago, then I suspeect you may feel like you have to present something perfect right away or else your penname will get a not-so-great &#39;reputation&#39;. If so, let me say that it&#39;s an empty worry. For one thing, this is the Internet - you can always change your name and start over. But even besides that, you&#39;ve got to feel comfortable with your work because <i>you</i> like it. If you stake your feelings on other people&#39;s opinions, you&#39;re forever going to be a slave to them. Trust me. That&#39;s not how a writer should work. To be happy with it yourself, simply be honest. Ask yourself the hard questions. Would you be willing to completely scrap your favourite scene, plotline, or character if it was bringing the story down? Are you putting too much of yourself or your wishes into the story? These are the kinds of questions the litmus tests will make you think about, even if they don&#39;t apply directly. They&#39;re probably your best bet.<br><br>... I&#39;ve rambled on. Oops. Sorry; tends to happen. I do have one last question: Are you joining our PPC community, or are you just dropping in to ask for help this once? Either is fine, but it would be good to know. <br><br>That said, nice to meet you :)<br><br>- Sedri</p>

            <p>The PPC Holiday Filk game! Aztec reminded me. <sup>_<sup><br><br>It</sup></sup> works like this: pick your favorite holiday song and rewrite the words, PPC-style. You can do as many or as few as you want, and you can do the same one more than once. With your permission, I&#39;ll then collect your entries and add them to the <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/songbook.html">PPC Holiday Songbook</a>. (I&#39;ve just added last year&#39;s excellent entries, because I am a spaz.) Please go through the songs and enjoy! There&#39;s some great stuff in there.<br><br>I also encourage you to sing the songs if so inclined, and if you send me a sound file, I&#39;ll add it to the songbook. My e-mail is exswyzie14 (AT) yahoo (DOT) com. I plan to do one or two myself, especially if I can get Barid to sing with me. It should be interesting. *g*<br><br>~Neshomeh, pondering what song to filk this year.</p>

            <p>I love writing stuff like this. Especially now that I&#39;ve listened to &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas,&quot; Shrek-style, and &quot;The Muppet&#39;s Christmas Carol&quot; excessively.<br> The first one is a bit sacrilegious, but it was fun to think out. It kinda loses its momentum in the second half, but I still like it. It&#39;s set to the tune (and some words) of &quot;The First Noel&quot;. There&#39;s only two verses to it (instead of the original song&#39;s six) because I ran out of ideas and I only know the first two original verses. I might go back and write more in, though.<br><br>--<br><br>The First &quot;Oh Hell&quot;<br><br>The first &quot;Oh hell&quot;, the agents did say<br>was to certain poor Consoles in rooms where they lay.<br>In rooms where they lay processing Sues<br>for assassins to kill; hey—that&#39;s old news.<br><br>Oh hell, oh hell,<br>Oh hell, oh hell.<br>Born is a Sue and canon&#39;s unwell.<br><br>The fic was bad—the worst they&#39;d seen.<br>Duty was calling to kill the teen.<br>Agents looked and saw her near,<br>so they charged and murdered without fear.<br><br>Oh hell, oh hell,<br>Oh hell, oh hell.<br>Dead is a Sue and canon is well.<br><br>--<br><br>I wrote the second one and found that it was frighteningly easy. Song and tune filked is &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer&quot;. It was originally going to be &quot;Mary the Talking Unicorn&quot;, but I changed it when I found a better one. Most of the words are from the original song. The canon names are from these fandoms, in the same order: Harry Potter, Provost&#39;s Dog, Chronicles of Narnia, Lord of the Rings, Discworld, A Series of Unfortunate Events, Star Wars, and Pirates of the Caribbean. Also, I&#39;m not calling these characters Sueish. I&#39;m just naming them because they work the best and are relatively well known. This song is a dedication to all those PPC-ers who dislike certain canon Sues and would kill them if they could. (Note: Canon in the song is being used in place of saying &quot;permanent character from a series&quot;.)<br><br>--<br><br>&quot;Mary the Sueish Canon&quot;<br><br>You know Harry and Beka<br>and Aslan and Frodo.<br>Rincewind and Olaf<br>and Leia and Sparrow.<br><br>But do you recall... The most famous canon of all?<br><br>Mary the Sueish Canon <br>had some very wilver eyes.<br>And if you ever saw her,<br>you would say they attract guys.<br><br>All of the other canons<br>used to laugh and call her names.<br>They never let poor Mary<br>join in any canon games.<br><br>Then one foggy winter eve<br>Mary saved the day.<br>&quot;Mary with your wilver eyes,<br>you caught bad guys by surprise!&quot;<br><br>Then all the canons loved her<br>as they shouted out with glee,<br>Mary the Sueish canon,<br>watch out for the PPC!</p>

I&#39;ve heard it put to two different tunes, as performed by the Choir of Trinity Church and by Elisabeth Von Trapp (yes, <i>those</i> Von Trapps).

            <p>It&#39;s just that I was seeing so many divided beats that I thought maybe you&#39;re all thinking of a different version (or that my memory is off, given that I&#39;ve heard the song all of once).<br><br>...

            <p>My family&#39;s not big on Christmas - actually, we&#39;re about as unChristmasy as you can get without not giving presents all together. I grew up annoyed by most Christmas carols - especially the overtly religious ones - and never bothered to sing them. Usually once I start singing something they&#39;re branded in my mind forever, but these melodies tend to escape me.</p>

            <p>Well? Who did it? Who won? Who made their goal? Who failed miserably but had fun doing it?<br><br>I set my goal at 20k, because this was my first attempt at any such thing, and I made it. This is a first, writing so much in such a short period of time, and I hope it won&#39;t be the last. It&#39;s been fairly cool, if also hair-pulling-ly maddening at times. Next year, maybe I&#39;ll even try for the full 50k. <sup>_<sup><br><br>~Neshomeh,</sup></sup> almost looking forward to going back and turning it into somewhat decent writing now.</p>

            <p>Did it. Didn&#39;t finish... But oh, I had much fun! It&#39;s good to really get writing again. The output didn&#39;t make much sense, but then I started rearranging the scenes in yWriter, and now I&#39;m really excited to start smoothing it out into something decent!<br><br>But first I need to actually, you know, finish the story. That was my problem: No idea of the plot specifics. Overall arcs, yes. Specific plot points? No.<br><br>Output: 22,473 words.

            <p>We are the more common subspecies of Michigander--I think the term is Trolls, though I&#39;ve seen Wombats (&#39;cause we&#39;re &quot;down under&quot; the Mackinac Bridge, I guess). We are carless in Ravenswood, but if you&#39;d like to come hang out in the city sometime, that would be cool. With any luck we can get former Boarder Tungsten_Monk to come, too. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>
