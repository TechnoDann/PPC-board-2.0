            <p><i>Good day, all.<br><br>We of the Department of Fictional Psychology congratulate Agents Sara Knight and Zach Homewood on the completion of a successful mission. However, we are concerned with some of the particulars of said mission. We would like it to be known that any use of the &quot;snaperrifle&quot; in any capacity other than the strictly professional will result in the offending party being banned from all Bleeprin supplies. We simply do not wish to contemplate the kind of mayhem such a thing would cause in the halls of HQ.<br><br>Thank you for your consideration.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>The Kudzu Vine</i></p>

            <p>If anyone&#39;s had their head to the ground for the last month or so, then they&#39;d know that a small contingent of PPCers is  planning to get to San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2009.<br><br>I&#39;ll be going with a group of six, half of the group being PPCers to San Diego for the 21st-28th of July.<br><br>Said group will consist of, tentatively: Me, Fynn, Jai, Ansela, Fhajad (who you do not know), and a friend of Ansela&#39;s. <br><br>We&#39;re gonna be trying for Seaworld and Comic-Con for that week- in short, this is going to be a weeklong Gathering, roughly.<br><br>So, why this random post, in February, you&#39;re probably wondering.<br><br>Well, this is to look to see if anyone else would be interested in making this a massively large Gathering.<br><br>Be forewarned, though, Comic-Con is expensive, and I&#39;m estimating at around 700$USD for everything for that week, except traveling to San Diego and from San Diego, if go with four people in a motel room. Price estimate includes Comic-Con, day at Seaworld, renting a car (if divyed up amongst four people), food, and hostel.<br><br>It&#39;d obviously be cheaper if you decided to cut down on the days besides the four of Comic-Con and stuff- or live off of the cheapest food you can find- but I&#39;m rambling now. <br><br>Anyone else interested?<br></p>

            <p>Otakon tends to get a bit expensive, partially because we drive back and forth every day to Baltimore. There is also the wonderful booths that just tend to draw you in and suck all the money out of your pocket.</p>

            <p>Hello, everyone, bet y&#39;all thought ya&#39;d never hear from me again (*waits for the chorus of &quot;damn&quot;s and &quot;it&#39;s him again&quot;s to stop*). I&#39;m getting pretty darn sick of this first mission of mine, as I&#39;m sure y&#39;all are getting sick of waiting for it, which is fine &#39;cause none of y&#39;all are gonna read it anyway! :P Seriously though, I&#39;m pretty much wrapping it up, but neither of my usual betas are available! So if anybody would mind giving it a beta for me before I put it on, I&#39;d much appreciate it. At the least I&#39;d owe you a favour. :P So, yeah, any takers?</p>

            <p>I just skimmed the fics. First one has a  run on sentence problem, but didn&#39;t seem too horrid. Basic &quot;Doctor Who is not a TV show it&#39;s real&quot; premise.

Uh, is this Rose who wants to get married to human!Doctor? Then how did 21 year old Rose get a 13 year old daughter? <br>No wait, don&#39;t answer that. Just kill it.<br><br>Third one: too short. Just leave it a critical review. That will kill it.<br><br>Do you want to take any of these on yourself? I&#39;ve noticed your rather prolific. If not, I may want to take my chances for brain damage on the second fic.</p>

            <p>We muck around with Bleeprin in the PPC, laughing about agents overdosing or goiing loopy, but it&#39;s very possible that people could overuse it just as so many pharmaceutical are overused. Dependancy would be so damn easy. The article touches on this, but not in enough detail, I think.<br><br>Really, I hope that they find some flaw and dump the whole project. Too risky. And besides that, people need to learn to deal with fear, or they&#39;re just going to spend their lives fearing an incident that will make them afraid. That&#39;s no way to live. </p>

            <p>The drug does not take away the memory; it takes away the fear associated with the memory. The person would still have the bad memory. He would just not be affraid of it anymore.<br><br>I&#39;m reading the linked article and though the point of the Dutch researcher is made (not changing the memory, just changing the response), the British scientists that respond (mostly) seem to fail to see this point. They&#39;re talking about  it being bad to change a bad memory, &#39;cause memories are useful. But the memory wasn&#39;t changed, the response to it was.  So it would have been nice to see these scientists respond to the usefulness (or not) of changing a response to a bad memory.<br><br>They make valid points, though they are some what irrelevant to the research that was presented.<br><br>That said, when the item opened my first thought was of bleeprin aswell.</p>

            <p>It just requires a neurosurgical degree/license and a consent form. =)<br><br>Actually, a gentle electrical stimulus across certain sections of the brain is a perfectly acceptable research method.  That and information gathered from strokes are how the areas of the brain have been identified.  A slightly simplified example might be where a surgeon applies a current to a certain area in the brain and the patient suddenly starts babbling or complains about pressure on his leg.<br><br>Yay for taking a cognitive neuroscience class!</p>

It... er... well, see for yourselves. <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4869155/1/Unexpected_Beginnings">Here.</a><br><br>The nice thing is, this person wants to improve. They acknowledge they&#39;re not the best right now, and have advised me to be as brutal as necessary when whipping things into shape. (So please don&#39;t verbally eviscerate them? =P)<br><br>Only thing is, this person is American. And so am I. While this story takes place in England and Scotland. Even if there <i>is</i> an American student involved -- I&#39;m still skeptical about this -- it should be correct. Britically. Or something like that. ^^; I volunteered to go fishing and see what I could find, and they asked if I would be so kind. <br><br>Any of you kind Boarders feel up to it?<br><br>My next resort is the Pit&#39;s beta feature. Could be iffy. ^^; But if no one&#39;s brave enough, I can go fish over there too.<br><br>Thanks for your patience, at the very least~</p>

            <p>Have a prinny suit. It has the unusual side-effect of making you say &#39;dood&#39; after every sentence. It looks like a penguin with small demon wings on the back and a pouch for explody and/or pointy objects. A Scarf of Non-Explodiness, which negates the explosiveness of prinnies when thrown, is optional. The suit will go well with the baby penguin, at least.</p>

            <p>First of all, welcome, welcome, welcome. :) It&#39;s always nice to meet new people. My gift to you is a stuffed duck - use it wisely. Please feel free to leave your sanity at the door.<br><br>That said, crazy as we are, we have some rules of ettiquette that are considered rather important to follow. First off, I&#39;m guessing by your exploding ducks and such that you&#39;ve already read <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a>? If not, please, go and do that right now. :)  Also, have a look around the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">PPC Wiki</a> - again, if you haven&#39;t already. <br><br>That said, it&#39;s good to see you&#39;re so enthusiastic, having two agents ready already, but you see, we have a policy that requires any writer to be an active participant on this board for at least a month before asking <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> - this link will tell you all you need to know. The main one is the month-long wait, and the point is that we need to get to know you before a senior member - a Permission Giver - can reasonably give you permission to write your own PPC stories.<br><br>So this really isn&#39;t the time to be starting new departments, let alone something that is only affiliated with the PPC. A deconstruction department would probably fall under <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Intelligence">Intelligence</a> quite easily anyway, so there&#39;s no need to seperate yourself. Also there is already a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Sub-department_of_Rare_Fandoms">Sub-Department of Rare Fandoms</a>, which it sounds like your agents would fit into quite well. <br><br>I hope I haven&#39;t discouraged you. Please feel free to join in on any discussions, no matter how inane. We love to talk. <br><br>Cheers, <br>- Sedri</p>

            <p>I just finished the latest chapter of a fanfic I&#39;m in the middle of. It&#39;s called Voyage of the Cat&#39;s Eye and it&#39;s a Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles AU (with a bunch of other CLAMP crossovers). It&#39;s set in a pirate &#39;verse and it&#39;s romantic/comedy/adventure.<br><br>Basically, my problem is this. Cassie normally betas for me, and quite energetically. She&#39;s already done most of the chapter, but I went back and edited quite a lot so I need her back. However, at the moment I&#39;m unable to get in touch with her so I need a new beta! It&#39;s basically just spelling and grammar issues, along with any thoughts on pacing and the like. I know not many of you know the fandom in question, but that&#39;s okay because it&#39;s an AU and I&#39;m pretty comfortable with my characterisation. I just need someone to spell and grammar check for me.<br><br>Any volunteers?</p>

            <p>Well, there are modified CADS for it. If nothing is used, then either one or both Agents are possessed by the Suevian spirit and act out the role of the Stu/Sue.

            <p>Does Pokйmon have <i>any</i> logic in whatsoever? Because I’ve got a fic in progress but, as I’m trying to go for a thought-out story, I’m thinking about all the wacky things that tend to happen in it. Let’s ignore the whole romantic tension between ten-year-old and the fact that said ten-year-olds can defeat a crime syndicate time and time again and that no-one ever ages (does <i>anyone</i> age in <i>any</i> cartoon/anime? (Pokйmon’s anime, right?)).<br><br>Pokйballs: is there a logical explanation for the fact that metal, which seems to have a lot of electronics inside, can expand from the size of my big toe to the size of my palm? Is there an explanation for the fact that Pokйmon, random creatures with at least 493 species, can all be shot at with a… laser(?) and turned <i>into</i> a laser and sucked into a Pokйball (which then is compressed back to toe-size)? Is there a logical explanation for how they come out (in a weird flash of white light)? Hell, is there an explanation for how they can sometimes come out on their own? They can’t be in stasis of any sort, because they generally seem to know what’s going on (also, they’d be angry if all they ever saw was battle after battle). Also, they seem to heal between battles even if they haven’t been sprayed with Salvon or whatever’s in that bottle they sometimes use. And if they’re not in stasis, then can they starve to death if they’re not let out for a long time?<br><br>Pokйmon Evolution: How the hell do they evolve so <i>constantly</i>? And why do they glow when it happens? They only seem to need to beat up a few other Pokйmon to evolve (or have a catalyst in the form of a magic rock, of which an explanation would also be useful). At least Digimon had an explanation: they were all pieces of data, so they could happily switch back and forth between all sorts of evolutionary stages. Also, the Digidestineds’ Digivices (Digithis, Digithat) seemed to act as a trigger. But Pokйmon has no explanation. And what’s up with Eevee? It can evolve into one of five things???<br><br>Pokйmon Attacks: Some can be explained. Psychic attacks simply require brainpower, fire attacks obviously come from a fuel source within the Pokйmon et cetera. But were does the water in Water Gun come from? How do they form explosive(?) bubbles with Bubble Beam? Where do all these razor-sharp (and as strong as steel) leaves and infinitely long vines come from with Grass-types and their Razor Leaf and Vine Whip attacks? <br><br>This wasn’t meant to be as long as it was, but I spotted more and more weird things as I went. Any help would be very appreciated. Also, if you can explain any more weird things that I’ve missed, that would be just as good. Even if you can’t explain them, point out the weird stuff so I know what to deweirdify.</p>

            <p>Disclaimer - my entire knowledge of pokemon is based on my having watched the first series of the cartoon when I was about eleven or twelve, which is over ten yeras ago now.<br><br>Pokemon biology ... yeah. I can&#39;t really say much on the front of the mechanics of Pokeballs or of the whole laser thing, but as for the &#39;evolution&#39; ... well. There are things I can say on that score.<br><br>Evolution, for a start, is the wrong term. Metamorphosis is the correct term. Yes, that&#39;s right, what butterflies do. I know there are different types of Pokemon and that only some of them are &#39;insect type&#39;, but if I had to fit them into an Earth phylogenetic system I would put them in the phylum Arthropoda. <br><br>Yes, I *know* some of them are mammal-like and rock-like and plant-like, but hear me out :)<br><br>See, the thing about arthropods (not just insects, but we&#39;ll get to the classification thing soon, I promise) is that they are incredible mimics. There are arthropods that are almost impossible to distinguish from bits of plant, from bits of stone, from snakes and so forth. And arthropods metamorphose, which is very important.<br><br>Animals and plants are grouped based on different charactersitics, and the idea of grouping them is to make sure that each group contains only organisms that are more closely related to each other than they are to everything outside the group. And modes of life are very important criteria for dividing up organisms - outward appearance is actually one of the least important criteria - it is so easily changed by selection pressure. So given that all Pokemon have this same basic mode of reproduction/metamorphosis, which can be catalysed by rocks, of all things (and I&#39;ll get onto THAT later as well), I&#39;m going to group them in their own class, part of the phylum Arthropoda and a sister-taxon to the classes Insecta, Chelicerata etc etc. This group is cladistically correct because it is monophyletic (nothing that belongs in the group has been left out - no other animals reproduce like Pokemon do)<br><br>As for the rock catalyst thing, it is possible (not probable, and not likely, but possible) that these magical rocks contain essential elements or compounds that catalyse the chemical processes that cause them to metamorphose, or that stress them into changing, somewhat like bad water conditions force axolotls (which are normally neotenous and happy about it) to undergo the last stage of development and become newts.<br>This is a poor and depauperate explanation but I&#39;m sort of scraping the bottom of the barrel here.<br><br>I would like to state that this is me mostly me waffling on about biology and probably mostly talking out my arse and that I claim no authority on Pokemon canon. That said ... if these ideas are any use, feel free to use them.<br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>Since it is aimed at children, the characters don&#39;t age so that they can continue to connect with their audience. Other anime that is set over a long period of time (many anime aren&#39;t) do have characters that age. One example is Dragonball. The main character started the series as 12, but by the end of GT he&#39;s in his 60s with grandchildren (even if he does age spectacularily well). <br><br>As for the other stuff... It&#39;s a children&#39;s show. It doesn&#39;t need logic. The manga might have more detail though, I think that was aimed at an older audience.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I was wondering about where the water would come from for the move surf. If they pull from the environment then does that mean that they can&#39;t use it if they are in a desert? I gave up analyzing it. You just have to be creative when you write and try to work around it.</p>

            <p>The image says it all.<br><br>I actually have a solution to this. Female Pokйmon, every so often, produce an Egg. The size, obviously, must vary from Pokйmon to Pokйmon. But anyway. The Egg, however, will do nothing if not subjected to the tender ministrations of a <i>compatible</i> male. (the shell&#39;s probably semi-permeable, so certain things can get through while everything that shouldn&#39;t can&#39;t.) The donation of genetic material occasionally provides egg moves, but more often than not simply does the whole sperm + ovum = zygote thing, and, however many days/weeks/months/steps later, tada, you have baby Pokйmon of the mother&#39;s species. (Unless it&#39;s a Nidoran. Those are just special.)<br><br>It works. Really.  ^^;<br>Do let me know if there&#39;s holes in my logic.</p>

            <p>Nothing says their fluffy cute electric sheep is biologically identical or even similar to our fluffy stinky decidedly non-electric sheep. Perhaps over in that reality it is perfectly normal for mammals to produce eggs. (Note I said produce. Not lay. Because.

            <p>Pokemon doesn&#39;t have many canon explanations for these, as a reuslt, some of them are often left to the fandom to decide. A lot of these are also assumptions and guesses on my part to apply logic to the world.<br><br>First paragraph: It&#39;s a show aimed at kids mostly, same as the games. Characters don&#39;t look 10, but rather cna fit into most early age brackets. And yes, Pokemon is anime.<br><br>There is no logical explanation behind Pokeballs, other than the diffusion of matter. In my stories, the Pokeball contains technology capable of transferring physical matter into a pure energy form, thus allowing the Pokemon to be stored within the Pokeball. As all amtter is simply different forms of energy, the conversion is easy enough to say in theory, but hard ot put into practice. Additionally, Pokeballs can expand or reduce in size due to the technology of the Pokeball moving around, thus allowing it to enter a more compact mode. It&#39;s unsure what the inside of a Pokeball is like, seeing as the being inside is theoretically pure energy, but it is often guessed, and supported by Nintendo, that the inside of the Pokeball varies to give the mind of the Pokemon, or the physical body if the energy process turns it to energy, then to matter again inside the Pokeball, a more sane level of existance. A water type may need water, thus the Pokeball compensates thruogh inbuilt technology. In this thread, of the inside of a Pokeball is chosen to suit the Pokemon, it also follows that the environment is suitable for the Pokemon to rest and heal. Given the choice, I suppose a Pokemon may even be able to listen to events occuring outside its Pokeball, giving the possibility that the Pokeball has psychic capabilities and responds to the thoughts of a Pokemon.<br> Within the anime and games, Pokemon do need additional medicine for particularly extreme wounds or conditions (Poisoned, as an example), but other than that, Pokemon have probably developed accelerated healing abilities as a result of their frequent practice of battling. Pokemon have aso been shown to be fed regularly outside of the Pokeball, showing that the Pokeball doesn&#39;t seem to provide nutrition. As a result, they can starve to death unless they are Ghost Types.<br><br>Pokemon do not evolve constantly, as each tends to have one, or at most, two forms to evolve into. Humans are constantly evolving in their childhood to their teenage, and then adult forms, it&#39;s just more gradual. In the case of Pokemon, these changes are more sudden. It&#39;s the training that allows a Pokemon to evolve, similar to how exercise and nutrition allows the human body to grow towards adulthood. It&#39;s quite similar to the human developement, just occurs at set stages that can spontaneously happen, whether upon an emotion trigger or the need to evolve to deal with their current situation (See when Ash&#39;s Charmeleon evolved to Charizard to save Ash from the Aerodactyl). The elemental stones are shown to contain concentrated doses of whatever element they represent, which leads to the suggestion of radioactivity, a natural element not found on earth or even divine blessing.<br>Eevee is capable of evolving because it is very adaptable. It has been specifically noted that Eevee&#39;s DNA is unstable, allowing it to potentially absorb part of the environment around it and evolve to best suit it. This would explain why Eevee evolves around the Ice Rock in Diamond and Pearl, or to Vaporean when exposed to a Water Stone.<br><br>Pokemon attacks can be a bit tricky, but again, I also dealt with this in my own Pokemon fanfic. The water used by certain water Pokemon (Squirtle, Totodile, Mudkip, etc) is developed in an internal water pouch which frequently fills with either excess saliva, stomach acid (Explaining why several Water Types are also poison types), or is capable of combining oxygen in the air with hydrogen produced naturally by the body.<br>Leaves and vines are harder to explain. However, there are cases where plants can be quite effective against regular metal. Theoretically, by binding together thousands of paper thin layers of membrane, you can create a substance equal in power to steal. This would be seal in a laquer naturally product by grass Pokemon. The vines may simply be the result of seeds carried by the Pokemon being forced to grow rapidly, or even the Grass Pokemon itself forcing its body to grow by concentrating sunlight, nutrients and water in its body to force the growth or attack (Solarbeam requires sunlight to fire, etc).<br><br>And that&#39;s all stuff I&#39;ve dealt with in my story. It&#39;s actually quite fun, applying logic, you just gotta ask &#39;How can this work&#39;, and then create the theories. I dealt with the paradox of &#39;Pokemon fire = Not Death&#39; vs &#39;Building on Fire = Death&#39; by saying that fire types excrete a natural chemical in their fire sacs which limits the heat their flames can reach.</p>

            <p>I, personally, gave up on logic in Pokemon a <i>long</i> time ago. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s meant to make sense, but just to entertain. It&#39;s a fantasy world with different rules etc.<br><br>Lights etc are just visual effects, for the viewers, in my opinion. Kids are attracted by shiny things.<br><br>Evolution could just be a case of &#39;I&#39;m too powerful/experienced for this form now, I need to be at the next one to continue getting stronger.&#39; There are exceptions, of course (i.e. Ash/Satoshi&#39;s Pikachu and its ability to defeat almost anything), but most things evolve once they&#39;re strong enough. I believe it was mentioned somewhere, perhaps in the Pokedex of one of the games, that Eevee has an unstable genetic code and therefore can evolve into whatever Pokemon is attuned to the stone you use on it (about seven or so now I think).<br><br>People do age in anime, most of the time, but Pokemon is just weird with its non-aging. The Digimon Adventures 01 characters were older by the time of 02, to use your other mon-anime example. Bleach, Gundam 00, Naruto, Code Geass and Ouran all show the characters aging, whether through time skips to the future or flashbacks to the past.<br><br>Good luck with figuring out Pokemon logic and science.</p>
