            <p>then cry, is the people who bash Shakespeare and Tolkien using terms or phrases from the actual authors.<br><br>I will not say that the serise are good or bad, that is and opinion that one has to make for themself.  What these books have done though is change the way of thinking in society.<br><br>Shakespeare:  New words, phrases, terms of general knowlege (who doesn:t know the <code>To be or not to be</code> line, even if they don:t know where in Hamlet it is from (I was convinced that it was in Act 5 for the longest time (I blame Bugs Bunney for that)) or that it is even from Hamlet.<br><br>While I agree that Shakespeare has been over analized to the point where the results really don:t make sense (I sometimes wonder what the poet himself would say at the conclusions made) it has shaped the way we think, and it will forever will.<br><br>Tolkien: What Tolkien wrote was pure escapism.  When he was planing and writing The Silmarrion (a book that reads like a history text, by the way) he was fighting in the Second World War on the front lines against an enemy that felt like it could not be beaten.  It was only through greater mistakes done by the <code>evil side</code> that alowed the <code>good side</code> to win.<br><br>Tolkien<code>s books took the</code>good side/bad side` plot line to a level that was not seen before in fiction.  The reason if became a standard of mesurement was because it covers almost all aspects of human (or race of choice) life, from daily chores to death in grusome battle.  It also didn:t glorify battle, it gave descriptions of how horrid it can be, what commanders and generals don:t want their soldiers to know.  What person would join an army if he knew that he was more likely to die a horible death then to come home with spoils of war?<br><br>These writers give readers things to think about, they don:t give you an answer, they let you make up your own mind.<br><br><br>Now I am finished rambling, and will go to bed.  Hope someone likes this, and sorry for no specific examples.  I am in an area without my books (ie Japan).  I tried to explain without a bias, but as a prof once told me, there is always a bias.

            <p>However, on the Tolkien point, a) it was WWI, not WWII, I believe and b) I&#39;m a equal fan of fantasies where good and evil are very distinct, but I also like stories where the lines are blurred to the point where you could show the story from the other side and still feel like you&#39;re supporting the good guys. I&#39;m attempting to write a fic like that, actually. My hero from the first story (where good and evil was, with a few exceptions (i.e. when he went a bit insane), fairly defined, will make a lot of decisions that seem off. The army of the good guys will be shown to have far more prejudices that I show in the first fic, where they&#39;re generally <i>better</i> than humans. I&#39;m considering having a spin-off from the point of the characters affected by my hero&#39;s actions.</p>

            <p>thanks for the correction in wars, should have looked it up.<br><br>I like the fic idea that you have.  Origional fic idea I have has a blured like between the good side and the bad side.  I am going to try and write something where you don:t actually know which side is which until the very end, using brothers.  The brothers, themselves, are peaceful to each other, but thier respective mentors are the one with the problems.  I don:t know when I am going to write it out (still in character development stage) and probably wont be written for some time.<br><br>L</p>

            <p>Your story sounds a lot like one of my others. I&#39;ve got a Command &amp; Conquer fic where the main character works for the Brotherhood of Nod as one of Kane&#39;s best soldiers, but her brother works for GDI, the opposite side. Essentially, Nod are the bad guys but no-one really knows what Kane is up to (even his own forces) and she is devoted in her belief of Kane. Therefore, I protray GDI as the bad guys (what pushed her to joining Nod in the first place).<br><br>Some Links:<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kane_(Command_%26_Conquer"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kane_(Command_%26_Conquer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kane_(Command_%26_Conquer</a></a>)<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Nod"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Nod">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Nod</a></a><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Defense_Initiative"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Defense_Initiative">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Defense_Initiative</a></a></p>

            <p>GDI is somewhat morally dubious aside from the whole &quot;Saving the human race from getting turned into crystal&quot; thing. Also, Kane spent the entire third game saving the human race from aliens and apparently got a tiberium remote control out of the Tacitus prior to the fourth game.</p>

            <p>GDI&#39;s always seemed morally excellent. Yes, General Solomon seemed sinister in Tiberian Sun&#39;s Nod campaign. Yes, Boyle was a MORON. But GDI itself? Nah.

            <p>Basically, GDI really doesn&#39;t help the people who live in the yellow zones despite being reasonably capable of doing more or at least evacuating a number of them to the blue zones. The reclaiming of yellow zones is nice, but they don&#39;t even provide, say, gas masks. That sort of thing is why the militants say &quot;<b>The oppressors must die!</b>&quot;<br><br>They also show some recklessness and disregard for human life in terms of the research they conduct in Kane&#39;s Wrath. Experiments in liquid tiberium killed numerous researchers and weren&#39;t stopped until after nod blew up the facility. Likely the only reason they didn&#39;t restart it after that was that the destruction of the facility turned Australia into a red zone. Also, they were risking the Tacitus entirely more than was really acceptable. Experiments that have a 10% chance of causing it to explode each experiment are rather unwise.<br><br><br>As for Kane saving Earth from the Scrin, the key point is that he lured them to Earth early. The Scrin plan was to wait until no effective resistance remained on the planet, which usually occurred when someone detonated a liquid tiberium bomb. The Scrin came to earth and were totally destroyed, instead of waiting a while and arriving to find no resistance. Of course, the inbound invasion fleet might be an issue, but apparently Kane turned the Tacitus into a tiberium remote control or something like that prior to the start of the upcoming fourth game. We&#39;ll see how that plays out.</p>

            <p>good point. Personally, though, I&#39;m still mildly unconvinced. I think that GDI were right to attempt to leave the Yellow Zones to their own devices while they poured all of their money into anti-Tiberium research. If ZOCOM&#39;s efforts worked in a Red Zone, then they would instantly have switched to the Yellows, knowing that their tech works.<br><br>Also, gas masks against Tiberium?

            <p>GDI probably had far more than enough to at least airlift people out, though. I got the impression that they had started reclaiming yellow zones, such as Germany, but it was going to take decades to complete. In the mean time, they should probably have evacuated people from the yellow zones, especially the Sahara and Amazon deserts and the areas near enough to red zones to have tiberium in the rainwater.

I love the Harry Potter series, and I do think it could become a timeless classic; perhaps not on the level of Shakespeare, but it will stick around for years to come.  I think the whole Twilight craze is overrate, as well, but then i&#39;ve only read two sentences of the book.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve read all four, and they all have their merits, some of which are long-lasting, some of which are very brief. I don&#39;t really like Shakespeare despite all the praise he gets - it&#39;s more that his stories are now culturally ingrained and you can&#39;t really avoid them. I don&#39;t dislike them, either, but I&#39;m not interested.<br><br>Harry Potter, I think, is the same - only in this case I like it ;)  That story has been so big over the last ten years that it&#39;s ingrained part of itself in daily life; you can mention Harry, or Shakespeare, in random conversation and be reasonably sure the other person will have at least some idea of what you&#39;re talking about.<br><br>Tolkien, it seems to me, was like that five years ago, but now it&#39;s fading along with the movie hype. I like Tolkien, and always will, but not with the obsessive nature that seems to be characteristic of...<br><br>Twilight. It&#39;s a fashion - a rather big fashion - and hey, I&#39;d rather see teenage girls squeal over books than whinging about whatever miseries are in their angsty lives. I don&#39;t dislike Twilight, either, and I read all four books, but it doesn&#39;t... it&#39;s not the same.<br><br>I&#39;ve rambled a lot, sorry, but that&#39;s my point: These stories are so different that they <i>can&#39;t</i> be compared. They&#39;re written at different times by different people for different audiences and in different ways. The <i>only</i> method of comparison is sheer popularity, and that&#39;s ever-changing.<br><br>Gives publishers something to talk about, though. *shrug*</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve read a lot of Shakespeare, in school and out, and all the Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and other Tolkien works, but I couldn&#39;t force myself past the first few pages of Twilight. I skimmed ahead a few chapters, but it looked pretty horrible all the way through, and given that pretty much everyone whose literary opinion I in any way trust told me it was horseshit, I didn&#39;t care to find out personally.<br><br>Shakespeare was a literary genius. Even if you don&#39;t like his material, you have to give credit where credit is due; he invented many, many words in the English language, his wordplay was witty, funny, and very beautiful. It&#39;s hard to read, because we don&#39;t speak that sort of language these days. (NOTE: It is NOT Old English which he wrote in. That is a separate language entirely, with, I believe, an entirely separate alphabet. My favorite English teacher taught us that in Freshman year, telling us that if she caught us referring to Shakespeare as &quot;Old English,&quot; she would make us write our essays in -real- Old English, and we would probably cry. Or something like that.) I got lucky in that my parents raised me on the Old King James, which is written in very similar language; I get the dirty jokes, and the metaphors, pretty easily, because the language isn&#39;t as much of a barrier. But, no matter whether you -like- his style or not, he was a literary genius. (Did you know that &quot;nothing&quot; referred to a woman&#39;s... yeah... back then? When I learned that, it gave a lot of his lines sudden new, hilarious meanings.)<br><br>As for the &quot;LotR craze,&quot; no, it isn&#39;t dying down. The movie craze is. But the books? Were written... circa 1954, 1955. That&#39;s about fifty-five to fifty-four <i>years</i> of popularity. When a student teacher saw me reading The Silmarillion in History, he remarked that they seem to come back with a bang every twenty, thirty years or so, since they&#39;d been fairly popular in the fifties (I think), huge in the eighties, died back down a bit, and then became huge a few years back, when the movies were made. Twenty-five years or so from now, people will suddenly rediscover them, I&#39;m sure <s>if the world hasn&#39;t ended by then</s>. It&#39;s not a passing craze. Tolkien was also a genius, in his own right. (As was Lewis, given that The Chronicles of Narnia also come rushing back fairly often.)<br><br>Harry Potter? Who knows? I think it&#39;ll be something along the same lines, though personally I prefer Lord of the Rings, Narnia, or, in fact, Shakespeare. HP is good, though, very good, and, as you pointed out, it&#39;s now a part of culture. Also not a passing craze.<br><br>Twilight? A passing craze. In twenty, thirty years, people who read Twilight and Eragon might remember them, might still enjoy them, but they won&#39;t be huge things like LotR and Shakespeare and possibly Harry Potter will.<br><br>The comparison thing isn&#39;t that ridiculous, as far as who stands the test of time. Honestly, it&#39;s not that ridiculous as far as quality is concerned either. Somewhat ridiculous, yes, because Shakespeare was a <i>playwright</i>, not an author, and because he wrote at a point when language was changin drastically (though, I suppose, given the sudden veer we&#39;ve taken towards babble like &quot;Obvy, FML,&quot; and oh my God I can&#39;t think of any right now but I meant the craze of abbreviating every single word, even in conversation, you could consider this language in a transition phase as well), but all told, I think he still wins on sheer awesome. His sonnets are awesome. But Stephanie Meyer? Oh good grief no. Her writing is purple prose, and at best, angsty melodrama. (Shakespeare, by the way, also gave us realistic acting. Back then, acting was nearly always incredibly melodramatic, the sort of thing you&#39;d see in a bad soap opera today. Shakespeare was the one who started the whole thing with acting like real people onstage.) JK Rowling wrote well<s>, if not as well as Tolkien</s>, and Tolkien wrote well, and invented NEW LANGUAGES AND AN ENTIRE WORLD COMPLETE WITH FULL GEOGRAPHY HISTORY AND MYTHOS AND BASICALLY INVENTED TODAY&#39;S FANTASY GENRE, but Stephanie Meyer? Wrote a story which ignored all previous vampire lore, a story in which the main character was a whiny brat and the other main character was an abusive jerk. And, because the characters were described in urple prose as the ultimate hot, tween fangirls ate it up. And some other people. But you know how you see those fanfics that are just horrible, horrible stuff, and somehow they have <i>thousands</i> of reviews of &quot;ZOMG I LUVV U THIS ROXORZ&quot; and, more mind-bogglingly, here and there, well-written reviews that actually point out good things? That&#39;s like Twilight, in my mind. Yeah, she got published, and she&#39;s got a thousand fangirls who fawn over her and are prepared to flame (and call a flamer) anyone who doesn&#39;t. But at the end of the day, give me Don&#39;t Panic, Okay NOW Panic, any day of the week. <s>And if you don&#39;t know what those fics are, and you have ever typed &quot;Where is all the goodfic?&quot; then slap yourself upside the head for me, and then go read them. Please.</s><br><br>(Rambling is a key trait. Nourish it well. :D)</p>

            <p>Roughly. As far as I know, it comes from &quot;between child and teenager&quot;, since ten-year-olds tend to think they&#39;re more mature than nine-year-olds.

I&#39;ve liked some of the film adaptations, and I&#39;m certainly not against giving him the credit he&#39;s due, but his stories just aren&#39;t ones that I personally can sit down and enjoy. <br><br>(And no, it wasn&#39;t Old English - it was closer to Middle English. I studied Old English a few years ago and believe me, it <i>is</i> hard. I hated it, to be honest, but it was fascinating to see how English evolved - Shakespeare&#39;s influences included.)<br><br>Also, it seems I confused you - sorry about that. I was referring to the fanfic part of the LotR &quot;craze&quot;, not the stories themselves. Reading back, I can see where I didn&#39;t make it clear. too bad these posts can&#39;t be edited.<br><br>And yes, I&#39;ve read &quot;Don&#39;t Panic&quot; et cetera. I liked them.</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t mean to come off as foaming-at-the-mouth enraged. I wasn&#39;t. Like hS said, I was more responding to the entire page/forum, the whole debate. It really, really, <i>really</i> irritates me when people take two-second fan-crazes and make them out like paragons of culture and talent. You&#39;d get much the same rant with someone trying to compare Linkin Park with U2, or Fallout Boy with The Beatles, or Eminem with Jimi Hendrix, or, for that matter, Bono with Johann Sebastian Bach, or, as you&#39;ve seen, Stephanie Meyer with William Shakespeare. And I tend to ramble on about subjects that irritate me-- because internet arguments so often turn into irrational flame wars and demonstrations of Godwin&#39;s Law, I prefer to try and make my point as clearly as possible. <s>Repeat after me, now: wordiness does not make things clear. Quite the opposite. You cannot reason with tweeny idiots. High blood pressure is a bad way to die.</s><br><br>(Man, that&#39;s incredible. It would be -awesome- to study Old English. I hope someday I can, as well.)<br><br>Honestly, I didn&#39;t mean to say that you weren&#39;t giving Shakespeare enough credit. It&#39;s acceptable to not like him, and hypocritical to assume or demand that everyone should. Eating my words? No, no, I never have to do that. That&#39;s for the foolishly proud, dontchaknow?<br><br>The rant wasn&#39;t aimed at starting a fight with you. Believe it or not, I don&#39;t like or enjoy flame-wars, or angry arguments. I was just peeved after reading the whole Graphjam page, and kind of found myself with uncontrollabe word-vomit. I stand by what I said, but it wasn&#39;t aimed at you, and I&#39;m sorry it... was aimed at you? By position, not intent.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve read, and liked, the Don&#39;t Panic series. It&#39;s on my top ten favorite fanfics list, and definitely the two of them meld together as my favorite LotR fanfic ever.</p>

            <p>... VM wasn&#39;t really replying to you so much as to the whole realm of Shakespeare-Tolkien-Rowling-Meyer comparisons. :P<br><br>Personally -- as a non-literary-critic -- I don&#39;t enjoy reading Shakespeare but like watching/acting his comedies, love Tolkien&#39;s worlds but don&#39;t tend to read his books much any more, didn&#39;t get past the first few chapters of Goblet of Fire but have watched all the films, and read the first three Twilight books (and watched the film) for pretty much the sole purpose of understanding all the mockery.<br><br>Shakespeare&#39;s works are probably immortal. Lord of the Rings will probably always have a cult/sporadic following. Harry Potter may end up the same, it&#39;s too soon to say. And Twilight probably isn&#39;t going to last.<br><br>But who knows? We may all be dead long.<br><br>(When it comes to Old English, I always loved the story of Tolkien&#39;s lectures on Anglo-Saxon poetry -- as I recall, he began the course by reciting the opening lines of Beowulf in the original, without telling the class what he was doing. ;))<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>What way do you recommend to De-Stu-ify an Agent? One of mine ate some dodgy punctuation, and has since been acting funny, the latest being that he &quot;Manefested&quot; a &quot;Kbifem&quot; with a &quot;Knickle guard&quot;.

            <p>As I said on the LJ, I&#39;ll download the songs as soon as I&#39;ve got a computer with sound, and maybe once I&#39;ve actually done some PPC missions. Should point out, though, that the links seem to be broken. I also forgot to suggest a couple, but ah well. Maybe next time someone tries one of these.</p>

            <p>But no, the PPC is not alone in the fight against Mary Sues. In fact, many of the authors in the Redwall section of the Pit (myself, Lycaenion, and sometimes Laburnum) have banded together on a few occasions to kick ass and kill Mary Sues.</p>

            <p>Hi! My name&#39;s Lucy, or any derivation you can get off of moonchild, or if you&#39;re feeling random, the color yes (which actually has the best story). I stumbled across this community &#39;cause... well, &#39;cause IndeMaat happened across one of my stories, reviewed it, and then I (sneakily, yes, I know) followed it to her profile and then was sucked into her Torchwood PPC files... Anyway, I&#39;ve been looking around, as I a while ago wanted to get into something like this, but I really like that other people have thought of it! Down with the Sues! Anyway, I just said anyway twice in a row, didn&#39;t I? Well, I&#39;d better stop that, I can think of synonyms for it, and I have access to multiple thesauruses, and... I should stop rambling, shouldn&#39;t I?<br><br>Okay, I&#39;ll tell you a bit more about me, how &#39;bout? I started out, fandom wise, in Harry Potter, then progressed to Pirates of the Caribbean, and only last summer progressed even further to Doctor Who/Torchwood, where I now reside (with my fanfiction, anyway). However, I&#39;d love to get back into Harry Potter/Pirates, but I&#39;m thinking my best way in at the moment is through PPC. On LotR -- as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll all ask -- I&#39;ve only seen the movies. (*cringes in fear of attack*) I do, however, have a hardback copy of the trilogy on my shelf and was trying to work my way through it before I got distracted by... probably school.  Umm... I have a cat, two geckos, and a fish. Also a little brother, some crazy friends, and tendency to spell things the British way even though I am 100% American. You could tell by my Philly accent, but accents don&#39;t exactly translate onto paper very well...<br><br>I believe that&#39;s it. That was a bit lengthy of an introduction, but I do have a tendency to ramble... Now, off to work on the characters I&#39;m planning... </p>

            <p>You sound interesting. I won&#39;t eat you... yet.<br><br>I come bearing links. *drags out Big Bag O&#39; Links and digs through it*<br><br>First off is the link to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">Wiki</a>, a veritable fount of information for a newbie to read through. Especially helpful for you if you want to write missions would be the page on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> (note the capital P).<br><br>I would advise against reading any <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>, unless you are of strong mind and stomach. Even the summaries have been known to give those of weaker constitution nightmares.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, not knowing what you have already managed to find, I have several links for you. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek) is a good place to start, as the PPC did many aeons ago. <s>What do you mean I&#39;m exaggerating?</s> <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">The Department of Geographical Aberrations</a> is another interesting place to visit, if you have the time and inclination. Also by hS is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/index.htm">Tangled Webs</a> site, which contains backstory for the PPC as an organisation. If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be. And last, but most definitely not least, <a href="http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/65922.html">Response Centre 45</a> is where Trojie and Pads&#39; missions are archived.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay here.

Pidgins (they look like Pigeons, except black, leathery, and covered in Silver Script, which is like Purple Prose, only it&#39;s the way that thirteen-year-old girls excuse bad spelling with &quot;But it&#39;s so pretty!&quot;) are good for sorting out when Suethors throw random non-english into a fic, while Kbifems (Basically like a bowie knife with a highly scripted M cut out of the meat of the blade) are very good for killing Suethor Spelling. Beware, though! if either falls into the wrong hands, GREAT EVIL can befall you... <br><br>Anyway, yes, welcome to the board! </p>

            <p>That&#39;s a good question. Are they allowed to be based in a TARDIS if they&#39;re not always going into Doctor Who/Torchwood? &#39;Cause I&#39;m highly tempted to stick around Harry Potter for a while, maybe just to get my bearings? I&#39;d love to return to the fandom, but it&#39;s a bit... well, I&#39;ve frankly run out of inspiration for writing anything there.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a page on the wiki. Essentially, the Leauge of Mary Sue factories arranged for two macrovirus infected sues and paul bunyon to wind up in headquarters at the same time. The viruses hit medical first, apparently overrunning the only areas in which a cure could be synthesised, and then things went about as poorly as might be expected. It would probably have been easy to resolve if the portals were working, but they had to be locked down due to the risk of the viruses escaping.</p>

            <p>This might actually be a case of Transcription Error. The Suethor might have written that part of the story by hand (in the back of mom&#39;s minivan while on a long trip, say?) and then given it to Big Sister to type up while she was, oh, let&#39;s say taking a shower to get ready for the first day of middleschool. And her handwriting was so abysmal that Big Sis honestly thought that &quot;Sirius&quot; was &quot;Sinus&quot;. <br><br>This is why I&#39;ve stopped letting anyone try to read my writing while it&#39;s still in handwritten form. My &quot;t&quot;s look rather more like &quot;d&quot;s... And I can honestly see how &quot;ri&quot; can look like &quot;n&quot;.... <br><br>Still, proofreading is inexcusable. </p>

I have actually BEEN suicidal before, but finding this comic and laughing at the idea actually helped with my recovery. Plus it has the same appeal as the Darwin Awards with the added bonus that you don&#39;t feel guilty for laughing at the deaths of actual people. And there&#39;s something very PPC-ish about the main characters; two snarky teenagers making a living out of killing people they feel are a blight on society in various creative ways?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m curious. How does one go about creating an OFU these days? Last I heard, Miss Cam had given up on PPC, OFUs and everything else. It&#39;s just I&#39;m giving serious thought to creating a Mass Effect/Knights of the Old Republic/everything else BioWare OFU and I&#39;m trying to coax a walking Elder Scrolls encyclopedia to create one for that fandom.<br><br>I presume reading OFUM is a must? I&#39;ve got that covered, one of the others who might help with Elder Scrolls has too, though I need to force the encyclopaedia to read it.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a master list of them about; the wiki doesn&#39;t seem to have one. But its page on That Series lists each part along with who sporked what; it could admittedly do with links adding to both agent profiles and to mission logs, but if you search through the wiki for those agent profiles, you should find their mission logs and be able to get what you&#39;re after. Good luck!</p>

            <p>Alright, I thought you guys would appreciate this. When I was new to FF, I stumbled across this brilliant story that started me out on the Anti-Sue crusade. I just remembered it falling asleep at about midnight last night.<br><br>The fic: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735190/1/%22">xXoCeaNRoMaNCeLoVeXx by xXWiLLTuRNeRSMiSTReSSXx</a>. It&#39;s within the Pirates of the Caribbean fandom, and is basically about the canon characters battling Sues, Suethors, horrible grammar and spelling, chatspeak, and, well, plenty of other things. I can&#39;t remember all of it, having read this probably two years ago now, but I do remember that it&#39;s bloody brilliant and worth a read for anyone who knows Pirates.</p>

            <p>Albeit it unintentionally -- I was simply looking into some normal, sane fanfiction for a break -- I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4935357/1/The_Doctor_Down_Under">this atrocious thing</a>. The summary alone made me need to find out how bad it truly was, so, unfortunately, I did. I got there and I couldn&#39;t bring myself to actually <i>read</i> the bloody thing. I skimmed it -- especially after the first words of the author&#39;s note:<br><br>Hello anyone bothering to read this<br>you should know 2 things<br>#1<br>I’m an awful writer and simply bored, hence I am writing this story<br>#2<br>spelling and grammar shall be deplorable in this story, get over it and go away if you can’t take the thousand or so mistakes<br><br>C&amp;P&#39;d perfectly, I promise. The spacing is crap. There&#39;s no differentiation between story and AN other than the fact that it is a new chapter. There&#39;s practically more AN than story -- in the first chapter.<br><br>Oh, and I haven&#39;t even gotten to the <i>worst</i> part yet.<br><br>It claims to have been beta&#39;d.<br><br>Who would -- who would <i>claim</i> -- who would <b><i>claim</i></b> to have beta&#39;d something of this caliber?<br><br>It only appears to get worse. In the second chapter, the disclaimer for all sorts of lovely things gets completely disproved by the author... directly after making the claim to said warning. And and and... *cries* <br><br>*looks back up at everything* That&#39;s quite a rant on the horrors of this fic. Can someone please go and fix the 13 chapters of horror??</p>

            <p>Just so you know, we have a bit of a thing about double posts here on the Board. There&#39;s a limited amount of threads can be on any one page, so a lot of new threads in a row pushes things off the first page and onto the next. This, as you can imagine, increases the chances of things getting missed, so we like to try and condense things into one post if we&#39;re starting a new thread. Or, if we&#39;ve started a thread and then have something else to say, we stick it in the thread that&#39;s already there (under a suitable title, of course, so people can easily spot it&#39;s something new).<br><br>(Don&#39;t worry too much though - most of us have done this at some point.)<br><br>Will follow the link when sober, but surely someone using &quot;hence&quot; accurately should be literate enough for spelling?
