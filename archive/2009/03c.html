            <p>Lawful Evil? Most of our agents are more Chaotic than Lawful. And not just those who go flamethrower-crazy. As for Evil, I&#39;m not sure either. Most of our violent acts are the product of our agents&#39; instability, not their moral stance.<br><br>We&#39;re just well-intented extremists, who have to leave everyday morality behind in the name of a greater good (namely, the preservation of the Plot Continuum).

            <p>Far as I can tell, there&#39;s no &quot;let the Sue live and continue to tear Canon apart at the seams&quot; option. We kill them because we have to. A lot of the other work, like Bad Slashing, can actually be seen as kind of beneficial.

            <p>Taking a break from <s>Fandom Wank</s> the &quot;Death Star&quot; debate...<br><br>I was searching the &#39;Net for references to our, er, highly esteemed organization, and came across <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119882748/main.html">this</a>. It&#39;s an article on Mary Sue that pretty much gets everything wrong. Oh, and we&#39;re mentioned. <br><br><i>Protectors of the Plot Continuum<br>Another form of community policing</i><br><br>*giggle*<br><br><br><i>in fan fiction is the more activist approach known as the Protectors of the Plot Continuum (PPC). The PPC establishes a voluntary virtual brigade of agents who &#39;correct&#39; perceived problems in fan fiction</i><br><br>Yes, the likes of &quot;Aragorn daughter of Arathorn&quot; are only a PERCEIVED problem. <br><br><i>The establishment of the enormously elaborate organisation of the Protectors of the Plot Continuum affords fan fiction community members opportunities to be playful and clever with fictional structures. Like fan fiction itself, the PPC also affords opportunities for self-indulgence, in a community-sanctioned environment. The authority and standards of a virtual community can thus be enforced within the guise of a free-wheeling enterprise.</i><br><br>Here that, guys? We have authority! And here I thought we were just fanfic vigilantes out for a little fun. I had no idea we were Ye Fandom Police.<br><br>Teach me more, O knowledgable one!<br><br><i>As in most authoritative structures, opportunities abound for highly opinionated and perhaps overly assertive people to bully meeker writers within virtual environments using such devices as &#39;Mary Sue&#39; litmus tests and PPC agents.</i><br><br>The hit the nail on the head. I mean, all of the Suethors we&#39;ve dealt with have been exceedingly meek, their avatar characters without any ego or pretension.  THEY&#39;RE MEEK I TELL YOU!<br><br><i>Chander and Sunder (2007) would make a stronger argument that such regulation attempts to shut down political spaces that may be opened up by fan fiction. In their analysis, a Mary Sue has the potential to challenge media agendas on many questions including gender, race and class.</i><br><br>It&#39;s not enough that we are bullies...we also aid and abet racism, sexism, and classism! We sure get up to a lot for an online fanfic community.<br><br>I guess they&#39;re right, Boarders. I apologize for not realizing all these years that Mary Sue was a feminist beacon for the ages. She defines, sorry, <b>defies</b> all the most awful stereotypes of women, from the aggressive Warrior Chick to the fainting flower to the Can&#39;t Seem to Stop Using My Feminine Wiles seductress.  <br><br>(And how many poor and/or minority Mary Sues have you seen, by the way? Yeah, me neither.)<br><br>According to an article they cite, <i>Mary Sue is often a pejorative expression, used to deride fan fiction perceived as narcissistic. We dissent from this view. In this essay, we rehabilitate Mary Sue as a figure of subaltern critique and, indeed, empowerment. … As exemplified by Lieutenant Mary Sue, this figure serves to contest popular media stereotypes of certain groups such as women, gays, and racial minorities. Where the popular media might show such groups as lacking agency or exhibiting other negative characteristics, Mary Sues are powerful, beautiful, and intrepid (599).</i><br><br>I&#39;m going to leave this paragraph open for comment. I know I&#39;m not the only snarker here. Have at it, Agents! Your honor is at stake!*<br><br><br><br><br>__________________<br><br><small>* = Unless, you know, you don&#39;t take Mary Sue assassinations 100% seriously and are here to have fun. But that, of course, is out of the question.</small> <br><br>~Araeph</p>

            <p>I especially like the dismissal of <i>the concept of standards in fan fiction</i> as &quot;authoritarian,&quot; and the presumption that all Mary Sues are parody characters.  (While the trope-naming Lieutenant Mary Sue herself was a parody, I highly doubt that Jenna Silverblade was.)<br><br>How much do you want to bet that &quot;authoritarian&quot; is a euphemistic Godwin here?</p>

            <p>Evil, Grammar Nazi oppressors, who silence all dissent with our badfic parodies! <br><br>I think I&#39;ll quote Silvormoon here:<br><br><i>There is an assumption that because this is informal writing, not only should it not be required to be good, but that we should like it and praise it anyway. It&#39;s as if, the moment we enter the realms of fanfiction, we&#39;ve stumbled into a world where bad writing is considered a virtue and should be defended, while good writing is stuffy and snobbish and difficult, and therefore should be considered suspect at the best of times and ridiculous at worst.<br><br>There is this vaguely formed but persistent idea that &quot;This story is good because I wrote it and posted it, and I should get recognition and praise for it.&quot; Somehow, the virtue of the story has been redefined while the rest of the rational world wasn&#39;t looking. The story is not good because it was technically superior, or because it has engaging characters or a clever plot or because it engages our emotions. No. All the story requires to be good is that this person bothered to sit in front of a computer for a few minutes and bang on a keyboard for a while, and we ought to praise them simply for letting the story - such as it is - exist. My theory is that this is symptomatic of this new idea that children&#39;s self-esteems should be bolstered regularly by telling them everything they do is wonderful just because they gave it a try. It allows people to come away with an idea that they should be praised for everything they do - indeed, that the rest of us have a </i>moral obligation <i>to do so. Just watch. Go find yourself a substandard fic, and review it telling them everything they did wrong and request that they make an effort to fix it. Four times out of five, you will get back a nasty response - by email, author&#39;s note, or carrier pigeon - telling you that YOU are a mean, cruel person for not liking their fic, and if you didn&#39;t like it then it&#39;s ALL YOUR FAULT for being so callous and stupid.<br><br>This, of course, is rather like telling the person in your glue-stick house that the roof came crashing down on their head because they weren&#39;t smart enough to bother to prop it up.</i> <br><br><br>*whispers* Better keep it down, guys. We don&#39;t want to rile the academics! <br><br><br><br></p>

            <p><i>Word</i> to what Silvor had to say.  That just about sums up the series of events that led to the mission I&#39;m currently writing.  Except add in some power trips and disproportionate vendettas...yeah.<br><br>I draw a distinction between being critical (that is, pointing out flaws in a story) and just flaming.  Even if a piece is utterly gawdawful, I&#39;m going to <i>explain why</i> it&#39;s gawdawful—<i>politely</i>—if I take the time to review it.  <br><br>None of my reviews, even the most scathing, are intended as personal attacks on the stories&#39; authors.  If I say &quot;gargoyles are not sexist, and Angela is as far as it gets from a spoiled brat,&quot; or &quot;giving Arthas Menethil a bastard love child conflicts with continuity&quot;...<i>it means no more and no less than that</i>.<br><br>But from the way some of these fanthings take it, you&#39;d think that it meant &quot;how dare you have fun?&quot;  Or even &quot;die in a fire and take your time with it, you miserable beast!&quot;  And quite frankly, that&#39;s really <i>their</i> major malfunction.  (If your self-esteem is really <i>that</i> fragile, maybe you shouldn&#39;t be putting your stories up on the intarwebz for all and sundry to read...)</p>

            <p>Fresh off of TV Tropes, I kind of held a similar view. However, it didn&#39;t last long at all after reading through TOS and some bits of the Wiki. If all we wanted to do was act as Canon Police, we would have no need to make our characters, well, characters. Make them suffer, twitch, writhe, and in some cases, die- or Get Put On A Retirement Bus. There&#39;d be no point in writing stories if all we wanted to do was act as enforcers of good storywriting.<br><br>But it&#39;s the stories that make it fun! And thinking any different, I have to say, simply shows a lack of research on the writer&#39;s part.</p>

            <p>I do not speak as a Permission Giver. I do not speak for anyone but myself.<br><br>Please read the previous sentences again.<br><br>Not as a PG; not for anyone else. Got it? Okay then.<br><br>As a member of this community for the last six years, I am extremely disappointed in what I&#39;ve read on this message board today. Debate is one thing, but these long and incredibly disrespectful threads are something else entirely. There are ways of disagreeing with people without being rude.<br><br>First, one does not use the word &quot;stupid&quot; about another person or their ideas in polite conversation with that person. In fact, one doesn&#39;t refer to the other person at all. One says &quot;<b>I</b> disagree with you&quot; or &quot;<b>I</b> wouldn&#39;t do it that way&quot; or anything else, as long as the only person one refers to is oneself. If one cannot do that, one does not speak.<br><br>Second, one does not make broad accusations about one&#39;s fellow Board-members. We don&#39;t all have to be best buddies, but we do have to treat each other with respect. If an individual has issues with another individual, the grievance should be expressed off the Board or not at all. If an individual does not like the way the community is as a whole, that individual should think seriously about leaving the community.<br><br>Third, one DOES make every effort to take posts in the spirit with which they were intended. If an individual repeatedly has trouble with that sort of thing, that individual should bear it in mind and ask the poster what they meant before responding. Do not assume anything.<br><br>On that note, I&#39;d like to talk about the spirit with which the PPC was intended. I&#39;ve noticed a disturbing trend among newer members toward levels of power and aggression, completely unmitigated by an appreciable sense of humor, that I have no doubt would make Jay and Acacia regret ever leaving the PPC for others to write about.<br><br>Get this into your heads: The PPC is NOT about who can be the coolest, most badass agent. It is NOT about who has the biggest, most explosive toys. It is NOT about who can handle the most disgusting smutfic. It is NOT about doing something that no one has done before. It is NOT, and I stress this in particular, about making sense.<br><br>The PPC, in a nutshell, is NOT a pissing contest.<br><br>The PPC is about humor, good writing, humor, good writing, and, yes, humor. If your goal is anything but both humor and good writing, then please go away. I&#39;m serious about this. I like seeing new people come in, I really do, but I&#39;m sick of people thinking they need to improve the PPC, be it with novelty, expansion, logic, or anything else.<br><br>One more thing. If I see anyone else alluding to Huinesoron being &quot;high and mighty,&quot; &quot;the new owner of the PPC,&quot; &quot;the ultimate authority,&quot; or anything else, I really will ask you to leave. Haven&#39;t any of you wondered why he doesn&#39;t post much these days? Aside from real life, my guess is that he doesn&#39;t want to give anyone an excuse to accuse him of these things, which he is not, in fact, a party to. I&#39;ve known hS as a Boarder for as long as he&#39;s been here, and I tell you those accusations are false, unsubstantiated, and uncalled-for. Stop thinking them. Stop saying them.<br><br>That said, if you do find yourself liking something simply because hS did it, you are guilty in part of putting him into the extremely uncomfortable position in which he finds himself these days. Think about your own attitude before you accuse hS or anyone else.<br><br>Enough of that.<br><br>The PPC has no logic. The PPC needs no logic. We got along just fine without it. All we need is friendly and respectful people, good writing, and above all, a sense of humor.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to argue about this. In fact, I don&#39;t even want to see replies to this post. My e-mail address is exswyzie14 (AT) yahoo (DOT) com. If you want to say something, e-mail me.<br><br>Again, please don&#39;t reply to this post. We&#39;ve had enough long debate threads. Other people need your attention, too.<br><br>If you read all that, I sincerely thank you.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I have to agree with the first opinion stated by Artic - &quot;I head out for a few days and there&#39;s a minor meltdown? I dunno whether to be upset or appalled...&quot; The PPC&#39;s about having fun, guys. Agreed, I enjoy being dramatic and serious at times, but the reason I originally loved the PPC was because it was funny.<br><br>As for my Agents&#39; most humorous incident, it&#39;s kind of difficult to beat...<br><br>&quot;As the last Sue fell, two Agents burst into the cafeteria, brandishing bows and screeching what was probably intended to be a war cry at the top of their lungs. They were accompanied by two bellowing mini-Balrogs, who were flailing their whips in every direction.<br><br>The noisy group would probably have kept on going, had not the shorter of the two Agents slipped in a patch of Sue-blood and crashed to the floor, tripping her partner and the minis. As the nearest Agents just stared, and more turned to see what was going on, both young women began to blush fiercely and disentangle themselves from each other.&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s Cassie and Nat, in the middle of the 2008 Mary Sue Invasion.<br><br>Another favourite of mine is from the PPC Christmas Party 2008, in which Cassie proceeded to get completely <i>wasted</i> and snog Zach Homewood, Marcus Langston and Kelvin Talathion under the mistletoe, in that order. And then got arrested.</p>

            <p>Well, Nume and Cameo&#39;s missions (read: Fill the Plothole stories) had a fairly high quotient of ridiculous. There was the time Nume left his Bleeprin in the fic and they had to go back and stop Legolas from taking any. (Sadly, I lost this one and never got around to re-writing it.)<br><br>Then there was the time they were disguised as Elves and Nume happened to have a bow and arrows. He, um, accidentally shot Legolas in the shoulder. Cameo boxed his ears for him.<br><br>These were before Nume started carrying a flask of Bleepka with him at all times, by the way. That&#39;s largely Cameo&#39;s fault.<br><br>In recent history, there&#39;s the incident of Ilraen trying to learn how to morph clothing. They&#39;d acquired a box of Speedos that had fallen off the back of a plothole, so Ilraen was using those to practice. He would morph human, pull on a pair, then try to get back to Andalite and take them along.<br><br>Each attempt failed spectacularly. If you will, please imagine the Speedo stretching out as hips become hindquarters. Then imagine the elastic finally snapping, sending the Speedo flying across the RC to land anywhere from the console to Nume&#39;s bed to Nume&#39;s head. Imagine this happening about twenty times before the Speedos are used up.<br><br>As Nume commented, the place looked like nothing so much as a boys&#39; college dorm afterward.<br><br>Oh, incidentally, Ilraen is indeed an Andalite, but he has done a mission in Young Wizards-verse and, even though he hasn&#39;t actually seen either species, I don&#39;t think he&#39;d be likely to take a Rirhait for a Taxxon. The gaping, ravenous, toothy mouths on the Taxxons are a dead give-away.<br><br>Fill the Plotholes: <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/plotholes.html"><a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/plotholes.html">http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/plotholes.html</a></a><br><br>Missions: <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999.html"><a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999.html">http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999.html</a></a><br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>No stories from me. BUT, a very nasty and amusing thought occurred to me just now while reading past missions, and with the grace of the associated authors I&#39;d like to expound on it.<br><br>We have at least one Andalite Agent, Iskillion (Animorphs). We also have a Rirhait Agent, Car&#39;rok (Young Wizards Universe). Now, as anyone familiar with the Animorphs canon is aware, the Andalites have been fighting the alien race known as the Taxxon for... well, quite a while (can&#39;t remember how long exactly, it has been a while since I read the books). The Taxxon are inherently nasty even without the presence of the Andalites&#39; sworn enemies, the Yeerks, running the show, so hostility is natural.<br><br>Both the Taxxon and the Rirhait, as I recall, have been described as resembling giant centipedes.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if Iskillion and Car&#39;rok have met yet, but...</p>

The second, the bone-warping pain that spread throughout her body and the third was her bra literally exploding.

Agent Lunac, member of the Department of Mary-Sues Video Gaming Division (General) stood there. There were reports he was frequently a few sandwiches short of a picnic, and by the time Liadan was through with him, he&#39;d be three body parts short of a man.

            <p>Well...as I have it so far, the Vindicator!Sam dies rather quickly.  Which is <i>partly</i> a function of the agent knowing how to use a crossbow (and hit a wide target at more-or-less point-blank range) but partly a function of the Sam not knowing how to play a paladin (so to speak).  <br><br>There&#39;s also the fact that they&#39;re disguised as blood elves (and thus temporarily have the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=28730#comments">arcane torrent</a> ability).  But that is, as stated, temporary; it goes with the disguise.<br><br>Yeah, Dr. Manhattan would be likely to set her off.  (Especially since he&#39;s <i>too cool for clothes, evar</i>.)<br><br>And I made the icons at the <a href="http://www.tektek.org/dream/">Tektek Gaia Dream Avatar Simulator</a>.  It has its limitations (the black agent&#39;s hair is supposed to be close-cropped, not braided; the white agent&#39;s hair is reddish-brown, not strawberry-red...you get the picture) but it&#39;s good enough.</p>

Hello. -Waves- I suppose I should say something profound.<br><br>... &#39;Something profound!&#39; 8D -Shot-<br><br>Okay, anyway, now that I&#39;ve gotten over my shy newbie syndrome, it&#39;s time to make proper introductions. I am commonly known as the Peppered Fox, PF for short, and I look forward to meeting your acquaintances. (Gosh, I sound so stuffy xD) I&#39;m more of a roleplayer than a writer, but I do my best. I occasionally draw too, but my art skills are made of epic fail. I&#39;ve been lurking on... -Counts on fingers- six board so far in my short 14-year old life, two of which I have become a regular at. I like several things. Canadian TV shows, Canadian cartoons... actually, a lot of Canadian stuff. I enjoy reading epic fantasy stories and the occasional good fanfiction. I have become a semi-grammar Nazi, though I am a bit lax. I have a tendency to overuse smilies too, so be warned!<br><br>... Insanity is welcomed, right? Righty-oh then, I should be able to bring my friend, Henry the Dancing Bear. Come out Henry! Say hi to the nice PPC people!<br><br>Henry: -3-; (She&#39;s nuts. Get her away from me...)</p>

            <p>Ooh, a Canadiaperson! Lots of good stuff comes from the Frozen White Icebox, though most of the best (Corner Gas, Pushing Daisies, Clone High) is distinctly lacking in fanfiction content.<br><br>At any rate, welcome to the new blood! I present you with an Exorcism Bat; a baseball bat which has been impressed with the signatures of J.K. Rowling and J.R.R.

I am brainstorming, stainborming, stormbraining, and bormstaining ideas and random sentences which I will then staple together into a comprehensive whole, this being my normal method of writing.

            <p>Thursday Next is a fantastic series--make sure you know your classics intimately, though, especially Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, Dickens, and Shakespeare.<br><br>The third book is even better than the PPC with metafictional humor; that and the first are usually the two favorites.

            <p>This is a posting board, not a chatroom - most of the people on here only check it a couple times a day.<br><br>That said, B&amp;b doesn&#39;t sound like an Agent Sue - you spent some time describing her, but that&#39;s hardly a sign of Suedom. She&#39;s certainly crazy enough to fit in with the rest of us.<br><br>There are a few things that sound a touch Sue-ish, so you may want to think about them a bit:<br><br>Schroedinger&#39;s High-Heels: Impractical footwear should be impractical all the time. If she&#39;s going to wear stiletto heels, she&#39;s going to sink into mud, trip a lot, and quite probably twist an ankle every other mission. If this doesn&#39;t happen (but she&#39;s still wearing them), that could be troublesome. I&#39;m sure you can appreciate the humor potential in an Agent in heels.<br><br>Personality: She sounds like a borderline sociopath. Once again, you&#39;re going to have to keep that consistent - being sociopathic when killing &#39;Sues and perfectly normal at other times isn&#39;t good.<br><br>Finally, gag reflex. Having a completely unsquickable agent is very unrealistic. Not being reduced to retching is interesting, but she&#39;s going to need to have some way of demonstrating being extremely disturbed.<br><br>So, yeah - it&#39;s all a question of your writing skill, ultimately. If you&#39;re a good writer, you&#39;ll be fine. If you&#39;re a Suethor, you could pick the most normal agent ever and still turn her into a &#39;Sue. My biggest concern is with the gag reflex thing, see above.</p>

            <p>I like the idea of her finally getting fed up with high heels at the PPC. Or being impossibly stubborn and continuing to wear them. Either way, good room for character development.<br><br>I&#39;m fairly sure I&#39;m not a Suethor, so I think I can scrape by with her.</p>

            <p>He&#39;s not a complete pinch of the canon character; rather, as the backstory elaborates, he&#39;s a canon replacement (who was, in the Sue-story, intended to die considerably earlier than he was supposed to according to the canon), and his personality does have some distinct differences from the real Karl Wolf.<br><br>I&#39;m just noting that in case it makes a difference.

            <p>What&#39;s the policy on dealing with anon fics from kinkmemes?<br><br>I ask because I&#39;ve recently been seeing some truly awful fics on one of the kinkmemes I participate in, and the OOCness cannot be excused by AU/inclusion of kinks. If they were posted under a username I would have no problems with listing them as badfic and acceptable targets for the DBS, but since they&#39;re anon I&#39;m not sure.</p>

            <p>Kinkmemes are basically communities (usually on LiveJournal) where people get together and post all their perverted story ideas for characters from the fandom. Just putting the ideas out in the open, and then if any of the ideas piques the interest of a passing writer, they have the option to jump in and whip something up.</p>

            <p>Except I will admit to squeeing insanely over furries, but I&#39;m mostly in that for the cute factor.

            <p>I am still a newbie and I have not yet read all of the Original Series (working on it), but I believe I know enough about the PPC to request permission to write my own missions.<br><br><br>I have created a Livejournal account, where you can have samples of my work up to now.<br><a href="http://agent-cal.livejournal.com/"><a href="http://agent-cal.livejournal.com/">http://agent-cal.livejournal.com/</a></a><br><br><br>And below are my agents.<br><br><br><br><br>Name: Cal<br>Age: 20<br>Species: Human <br>Home Continuum: Real World<br>Department: Department of Mary Sues<br>Division: <br>Response Center: 72<br>Partner: Ellen<br>Fandom(s): Fantasy and sci-fi novels and films <br>Lust Object(s): Trinity (The Matrix) and Ripley (Alien)<br>Favorite(s): <br>Weapon(s): Improvised<br><br><img src="http://public4.tektek.org/img/av/0903/d23/1838/2ae4179.png" alt="http://public4.tektek.org/img/av/0903/d23/1838/2ae4179.png"><br><br><b>Appearance:</b> Rather tall and lean, Cal wears a grey trench-coat much too large for him, an old fedora and an eyepatch, but has yet to realize that it makes him look more silly than badass. He prefers not to reveal his features too much, since it would rob him of the aura of mystery he likes to think he possesses.<br><b>Personality:</b> Due to a massive overdose of comic books, pulp novels and James Bond films in his childhood, Cal seeks to emulate his heroes in everyday life (without much success). His excessive enthusiasm and cheesy theatrics make him rather clumsy and inefficient, but he can be surprisingly resourceful when the situation requires it. He takes his job very seriously.<br><b>Background:</b> Little is known about Cal&#39;s life before the PPC, except that he joined the organization only to have the word Agent added to his name (&quot;It sounds totally cool!&quot;). Shortly after his arrival he found a broken android at the Department of Sufficiently Advanced Technology and took her as a partner after repairing her. All pulp heroes need a sidekick, after all.<br><br><b>Fun Facts:</b><br>Cal can be destroyed by throwing his fedora into the magma of Mount Doom.<br>The deep pockets of Cal&#39;s trench-coat are believed to lead to a transdimensional storage room.<br>Cal has not slept for years: he runs only on coffee. If he spends a few hours without a cup of coffee he becomes comatose, in which case he needs a caffeine transfusion.<br><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br>Name: Ellen<br>Age: ~2 (looks about 11 or 12)<br>Species: Android<br>Home Continuum: PPC Headquarters<br>Department: Department of Mary Sues<br>Division: <br>Response Center: 72<br>Partner: Agent Cal<br>Fandom(s): Fantasy and sci-fi novels and films <br>Lust Object(s): R2-D2<br>Favorite(s): <br>Weapon(s): Flail<br><br><img src="http://public4.tektek.org/img/av/0903/d21/2139/8314369.png" alt="http://public4.tektek.org/img/av/0903/d21/2139/8314369.png"><br><br><b>Appearance:</b> Ellen is an android with the appearance of a dark-haired, amber-eyed little girl. She is almost impossible to distinguish from a normal child, but her physical capabilities are impressive for her size. She is fitted with a variety of cool little gadgets.<br><b>Personality:</b> Most of the time Ellen acts more or less normally, but the many bugs in her AI occasionally cause her to do random or silly things like making a poem out of a burrito recipe or scientifically proving the correlation between the schedule of the Chicago bus system and the life expectancy of giant squids. She has the attention span of your average hummingbird, and her temper is wildly unpredictable — going from childish innocence to psychopathic violence in a heartbeat for no discernible reason.<br><b>Background:</b> Ellen is the end result of a project of the Department of Sufficiently Advanced Technology that was aborted due to budget constraints. She was about to be sold in their annual yard sale but was salvaged by Cal, who repaired her to the best of his abilities (it is not yet known how she was damaged in the first place). With no recollection of her early life, she named herself after Lieutenant Ellen Ripley from <i>Alien</i> — much to the dismay of Cal, who lusts for Ripley no matter how vehemently he will deny it. The android happily agreed to join the enthusiastic young agent on his missions.<br></p>

            <p>But not that way, obviously (shudder). I didn&#39;t just want to be a palaeontologist, though, I wanted to be an ologist. In short, I kind of wanted to study everything. When I was little I had the biggest crush on this famous palaeontologist, whose name I have sadly forgotten. And all this rambling was mostly just to agree about the dinosaurs. They really are awesome, aren&#39;t they!</p>

            <p>The reason that Velociraptor in JP are so big is because when Crichton was writing the novel, dromaeosaurid classification was being reworked and Deinonychus, which is about as tall as a man, was assigned to the genus. This has since been rescinded, and it&#39;s no excuse for calling the JP raptors V. mongoliensis, but it&#39;s a vague sort of explanation. As for the feathers, dude, don&#39;t you find it awesome that dinosaurs still live around us? BIRDS, dude, BIRDS ARE DINOSAURS! *has been excited about this since she was ten and will continue to be excited about it for the rest of her life*<br><br>Don&#39;t get me started on 10,000BC, either ...</p>

            <p>Ah, the problems you encounter when your Internet history and its associated menagerie of various screennames begins to catch up with you.<br><br>DirtyCommie is the oldest, with its origins dating back to when I still played Counter-Strike and my primary &#39;Net handle was BoSS|Communist. I signed up for the Bioshock Wikia in mid-2007 with it as the handle, not realizing that the same name transferred over to all the other Wikia sites.<br><br>Warrior_Joe came about while I was kicking around at Camp ... You Die (a Livejournal crossover RP of frightening proportions and sophistication), though I don&#39;t remember precisely where the name itself came from. That was back in late 2007, early 2008.<br><br>And as for NovaKrazny... When I first signed up for Gmail last April or so, I decided I&#39;d had enough with keeping track of myriad usernames and elected to begin using one Net handle across various sites. It&#39;s pretty much my automatic choice when I sign up for a new site by this point.</p>

            <p>What I always considered the defining trait of the Mary Sue is that they&#39;re always in the spotlight, and I just don&#39;t see that with PPC agents. When they&#39;re in HQ, it&#39;s essentially original fiction, and when they&#39;re in a fic, it&#39;s a Rosencranz and Guildenstern style &quot;the spotlight&#39;s somewhere else&quot; situation.</p>

            <p>Oh, that&#39;s a trend in the Redwall fandom. Authors will create their own Sues and send in Redwall versions of themselves to kill them. These Redwall alter egos are known as Sueslayers. Lycaenion has an in-progress Suebasher fic called &#39;Arawolf Beechclaw: Sueslayer Extraordinaire&#39;.<br><br>I&#39;ve noticed that, though, how our agents are often self inserts, but I think the difference is that self-insert sues are often overly new-and-improved versions of the author, or what the author imagines him/herself to be or wishes he/she could be. Also, the self-insert usually has the purpose to either seduce a canon character, bash a canon character, or place oneself in something that happened in the canon and have the self-insert influence it in some way (i.e. bashing/seducing canon characters).<br><br>Alter egos, fursonas, and suchlike that WE use, on the other hand, usually have no intention of doing any such thing, and are used for a comedic effect to get rid of Sues, bad slash, etc.<br><br>I actually don&#39;t understand what&#39;s wrong with the idea of an author inserting him/herself into a story, though. Kurt Vonnegut did it, and nobody complains about that. What exactly is it we hate so much about self-inserts, besides what I listed above?</p>

            <p>All our agents are self-inserts of some form. What we hate is the extreme, over-perfect version that is unfortunately so common that people start mistaking It for the definition of &quot;self-insert&quot;, which it is not.</p>

            <p>Well, I don&#39;t speak for myself here, but I think some people view it as juvenile or bad writing. Writing what is essentially yourself is &quot;too easy&quot;.<br><br>Ignoring, of course, such fine examples as Kurt Vonnegut, Hermione Granger, and Gonff the Mousethief.</p>

            <p>That Vonnegut&#39;s Author Avatar was meant to convey the story&#39;s message, that said Avatar didn&#39;t have everything go his way (and was nearly gutted by a deleted character), and that the other characters reacted realistically to him.

            <p>We&#39;re doing the best we can, thank you very much. We&#39;ve been struggling with funding for years, not to mention the random pay cuts and raises whenever Agents have tantrums and demand raises or get into trouble. Not to mention we have to work with a whole range of currencies. Do you have any idea what it&#39;s like trying to figure out the exchange rate between Star Wars Republic Credits and Potterverse Galleons? It&#39;s a headache, that&#39;s what it is.</p>

            <p>I was just wondering if anyone had a .rar of the series, or of any one of the books?

            <p>Well, the idea piqued my interest enough that I&#39;m considering trying to write a character from there- Race would be cool but I doubt I could pull it off. Probably someone from the Reich, or maybe from America.<br><br>Of course, since I haven&#39;t actually read any of the books, any attempt at this will be greatly inhibited.

            <p>I&#39;m not doubting that I could find a situation to get a guy from. My problem is I&#39;m not sure I could write the character well enough, what with the Race&#39;s mannerisms differing from humans&#39; as they do.

            <p>Anyone have a clue what it is?<br><br>The background: FF.N&#39;s been doing site upgrades, little things like upgrading the document manager and so forth, but on their list they also had the following: <br><br><i><u>The</u> most requested feature will finally make its debut. Stay tuned. Eta: Wednesday, March 25. </i><br><br>This has been amended thus - <br><br><i>The new feature unveiling is now rescheduled for Friday, March 27th.</i><br><br>- and I&#39;m trying to figure out what they could possibly be making such a big deal out of. What would be most requested on a website mostly popular with fourteen-year-olds?<br><br>This is random and pointless, I suppose, but I&#39;m curious and in typical fashion, unwilling to wait patiently to find out.

            <p>Hey, you can join the late club.  Bad Tirya_Moonflame!  No cookie! The giving out of winged kittens is my job.  Nocia, one of my agents, is a winged kitty magnet.  The winged kittens were inspired by a Warriors fanfic, thank StarClan it was taken down, where a magical cat from a comet created a clan that lived in a barn and gave every member wings.  Wow,I think I need the Bleeprin now.  *gets Bleeprin*  Sad to say, The Pit of Voles still has some winged cat fics and more Warriorsverse Sues than you can point The Canon Cannon at.</p>

            <p>Wikipedia lists not ten but 41 species of plover, most of which look pretty much the same. The Saint Helena Plover is listed as critically endangered, and adopting one might facilitate the preservation of the species. The <a href="http://images.google.ca/images?hl=en&amp;q=piping+plover&amp;gbv=2">Piping Plover</a> wins cuteness contests though.</p>

            <p>I found my unfinished NaNoWriMo fic.<br>Is it worth continuing?<br><br>&quot;Warning/Prologue:<br>  This is not a fairytale. <br>For one, fairytales have happy endings, and princes and moral values and defeating if the bad guy.  This will not happen here. If this bothers you, leave now. <br>There are still people here? Alright, let’s begin.<br>Chapter 1<br>    Sandshire was an ordinary kingdom. There were the farmers, the peasants, the knights and nobles. There was nothing out of place in this middle-aged landscape.<br>The ruler of this pleasant country was King Edmund Arthur Louis Francis the 10th of the house of Artemisia.  He prefers to be called Ed. Now King Ed thought it was strange that nothing weird had ever happen in his kingdom. There were no dragons running amok, no evil wizards with power and/or vengeance on their minds, and no long- lost heirs to the family throne. His wife, Queen Anemone, insisted that he stop prattling on about nothing and come back to bed. His advisors had begun to think him paranoid. And his mother claimed her son was simply having demented fantasies. <br>It’s only fitting, then, that the birth of King Ed’s and Queen Anemone’s first child would change everything.<br>     While I myself have never been around a pregnant woman for a long period of time, I hear it’s a dreadful experience. Oh, when the child is born there is nothing to be regretful of, but if one is a little over 9 months along, and the child is due any day, but won’t come…well, the stress is sure to be high.<br>“Eddddddd…..”<br>Particularly if one is the father of said unborn child. <br>“KING EDMUND ARTHUR LOUIS FRANCIS THE 10th OF THE HOUSE OF ARTEMISIA!!!”<br>Poor Ed. He only been asked to do something very simple—give his kingdom an heir—and he did as best has he could(while having a lot fun doing so, in his defense.)<br>“What is she yelling at you for this time, sire?”Asked Jacob, one of the many advisors to the king. “Did she hear about one of your ‘whaling jokes’?”<br>Ed clutched his brow in frustration. “No. And you I’ve stopped telling those after what happened last time.” Jacob winced at the reference. “I believe it has something to do with pickles.”<br>“…Pickles, your majesty?”<br>“Well, we were eating together in the great hall, and discussing the visit from the ambassador of Belle. So I mentioned that they often use pickles in Belleisn cooking, and, for reasons beyond me, she goes ‘Does this mean you don’t like the cooking here? Even though it’s done by your subjects, without whom you would have no power??’ Then she begins crying about how I’m a turncoat to my own nation, and why am I even king anyway, and then she begins to throw things at me!! For no reason at all!!” <br>“Would that have to do with why we are hiding in the stables, your majesty?” <br>Ed gave him a somewhat frightful glare. “We are not hiding, Jacob. We are simply having a private conversation.” He sighed. “I shall head to the local village, at least until Anemone no longer has the mindset of a murderous beast.” <br>“I shall use the usual excuse, your majesty.” Muttered Jacob, wondering how he could keep the Queen from killing him. Her Majesty Queen Anemone was not a Murderess by any means- ordinarily the thought would be laughable. Lately, due to the hormonal state of the Queen now possessed there were many doubts being place- mostly in the form of bets made by the castle servants. <br><br><br>   Outside the central city, the farmer’s carts that carried the yearly harvest had begun to arrive. The market was thriving, sellers were calling, and ridiculous prices were being fought over. It was the perfect place for one to disappear. <br>This was hardly how Kitty had planned to spend her harvest, but after the incident with the duck and the witch hunter, out of sight and out of mind was the best place to be. Yet still she was bored. A life of crops and cleaning was belittling to talent of witchcraft-particularly a student of the great Merrill Salazar himself- and oh, these people would be so easy to prank. <br>“Cross! Send another round of lagers to table 3!”<br>“And it would be so easy to turn her into a toad, and leave her in a pond somewhere.” Muttered Kitty as she raised the glasses, and took them to their separate owners. &quot;<br><br>Good? Bad? Deserves to be dumped in a vat of acid?</p>

            <p>Not bad, sounds like something out of Mercedes Lackey 100 Kingdoms verse (If you like this type of genre, I do suggest it.  Even though it is true fairy tails that I think that you want to avoid.  The other I would suggest are the Xanth books by Piers Anthoney.)<br><br>One comment that I would like to make.  A king would never be in this type of situation unless he truely loved his wife, something that you don:t state in the opening.  The Queen:s tantrums woudld not be tollerated after the first one.  She would fall to disfavour in the eyes of the king and be sent to a nearby estate to have the child, or at least into a separate appartment of rooms across the castle so that the king would not have to listen to the `insane, and infernal` woman.<br><br>Why is the king able to travel without any special retinue or preparation into a village?  This is not realistic in anysence.  Even in an increadibly peaceful kingdom, the royalty are never without body guards and other hager-ons. <br><br>Editing:  the end/or that you use in the second paragraph should just be `or`.  `And` is redundant and adds confusion to this statement.  There are some other editing problems, but that is the one the bugs me the most when I see it in a story.  It is fine in notes and other personal documents, not for a narrative.<br><br>Should you continue?  I say yes!  But I do like fantasy.  And the witch is sounding interesting, especially if you are going to have the story revolve around her.<br><br>But this is my opinion!  Take and leave what you will.  I do think that there is potential here.<br><br>Leto</p>

            <p>Like I said, mostly a lot of Marvel, but as far as specific titles I&#39;ve read and liked we&#39;re looking at:<br><br>The TPB Origin (Wolverine)<br>X-23 Target X and Innocence Lost<br>New X-Men<br>X-Force<br>Black Panther<br>Kabuki<br>The Amory Wars<br>Desolation Jones<br>Sin City<br>Fables<br>The Amazing Spiderman<br>World War Hulk<br>Watchmen<br>V for Vendetta<br>The Lost Girls<br>Wolverine Origins<br>Cable<br>Messiah Complex (Mutant crossover arc)<br>Johnny the Homicidal Maniac<br>Nightmares and Fairytales<br>and a lot of webcomics.<br><br>Now those would be ones where I still continuously read the series, or read the story arc to where I can remember fairly vividly. Keep in mind when I was working at a comic shop that I pretty much read a lot of other issues, but not the full series. That would get pretty insane to try and list all of those.</p>

            <p>Hi there! I also like comic books, so I&#39;m very disappointed when I start referencing all these comic book villains when people start talking about Batman, and everyone gives me this Look. Because they have no idea what I&#39;m talking about. And then I scold them for being uneducated...er, are you anywhere near as much of a geek as I am, or am I just blathering?<br><br>Oh yeah, middle school drama is disgusting, if you can remember that far back. Even more than high school drama. It actually breeds Mary Sues. Not quite sure why you want that.</p>

            <p>Well people should be in the loop what with the movies nowadays, or even if they paid attention to the animated series. I probably know at least the big players like Two-Face, Scarecrow, Joker, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, and Ras.<br><br>And I also know that Batman used to have a gun in his early incarnation, what happened to Batgirl/Oracle, and that Robin becomes Nightwing. Do I pass the test? </p>

So if he&#39;s still alive, he has obviously found a way to extend his life, which brings support to the theory that he now lives under the name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_grey">Aubrey de Grey</a> (known as the author of the book <i>Ending Aging</i>). Apparently he tested his anti-aging methods on himself, and it works! He also has a second identity as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Moore">Alan Moore</a>, comic book artist. But rival artist Mike Magnolia, creator of <i>Hellboy</i>, has discovered his secret identity and portrays Rasputin as a demon-summoning villain in an attempt to discredit him.</p>

            <p>1) That&#39;s a bit cramped for a bunch of (most likely psychotic) agents and a &quot;dysfunctional&quot; individual. I guess if it&#39;s a bit RC or one of those connecting-room RCs, it&#39;d be okay.<br><br>3) Make sure there&#39;s a reason for this &quot;Fred the Plover&quot;. It&#39;d kinda be... not good... if there was just this random thing that existed simply for the lulz.<br><br>4) We have a &quot;no torture&quot; rule? Since when?!

But I think Theseus&#39;d be biting off a bit more than he could chew, and unless Odysseus can find a way to make it drunk, he&#39;d be outta luck.<br><br>9) Because Chinese people are awesome, that&#39;s why.</p>

            <p>1) Only if you a) have Permission (:P) and b) don&#39;t think they&#39;ll actually kill each other at being so cramped. It&#39;s not generally done. I think there is precedent for interconnecting RCs though, so you could have them in a couple that have doors to each other.<br><br>2) Ask the author of the OFU you want them to have gone to.<br><br>3) Is there any plot significance to it? Or are you just playing for cheap laughs? Cheap laughs are all good, but it helps if they&#39;re there for a reason.<br><br>4) I would say it counted as torture.<br><br>5) Go check the List of RCs on the Wiki.<br><br>6) If you really feel the need.<br><br>7) For who? You&#39;d have to be very careful it didn&#39;t just turn into a gratuitious Cute Animal Friend.<br><br>8) You&#39;d get chargrilled Greek Hero. Unless it was Heracles or Achilles, in which case I&#39;d say that would have to go to the judges.<br><br>9) Because the kind of food Chinese restaurants serve is not traditionally considered breakfast food and because even the famously hard-working people who run Chinese restaurants deserve some time at home - given Chinese restaurants are typically open very late 7 days a week, can you blame them for wanting to be home in the mornings?</p>

            <h1>1: Why would a tech/psych person be in an RC? They work in their own departments. If they just come to the RC to sleep (*coughcough*), then sure, but I doubt they would be stationed there; they wouldn&#39;t have any work to do.<br><br>#2: I think many agents offhandedly mention having been in an OFU before reforming and becoming an agent. I don&#39;t think you actually need to as the OFU Co-ordinator, but politeness is good.<br><br>#3: You&#39;d have to explain it somehow; if it came from a badfic in which this actually happened and somehow was dragged into HQ, sure. If the gift-plover you recieved from Tawaki ran into a particularly malicious plot hole and was thrown into a never-ending time loop, it should be fine. However be aware that &#39;PPC&#39; does not equal &#39;just for laughs madness&#39;; there are some limits, and generally the funniest things are those that are created by mistake in a badfic, not thought up by an agent.<br><br>#4: Yeah, torture. Sorry. But once it&#39;s dead, go right ahead. Would make a nice little carpet.<br><br>#7: Similar to #3 - why? Or more precisely, where did it come from? If there&#39;s a canonverse that has winged cats and you can refer to your agents having been there on a mission, sure. If there was a badfic in which a cat was given wings (either intentionally or by some tech error), sure. But don&#39;t do things just because you can; the humour probably won&#39;t last very long.<br><br>#8: There would be many, many songs about him. <br><br><br>:)</h1>

            <p>The rest of the agents are such complete nutcases (this probably has to do with the fact that they are headvoices) that they need a 24/7 psych person on call.  The tech stuff is what he does to amuse himself when the others are elsewhere, and is very useful given the amount of jabbing things with sporks that goes on.  Basically, it&#39;s a perpetual disaster zone, and having a tech/psych person already there saves an immense amount of travel time.  </p>

            <p>... To be honest, it feels like you&#39;re pushing the limits, making your team of agents more absurd than the rest of us. I&#39;m not a Permission Giver, but if I were, I&#39;d ask you to tone it down. If a PPC agent is that far gone, they wouldn&#39;t be able to work anymore; the Flowers don&#39;t waste the talents of psych people on such a small group, because everyone&#39;s overworked. (Also, travel time is not an issue with plotholes, unless HQ decides to make you take the long route. Logic does not exist.)<br><br>Also - and don&#39;t take this the wrong way - I don&#39;t honestly understand how you plan to make headvoices into agents. If you want to personify them into people with near-caricature-ish personality traits, then fine, but actual headvoices? I really, really don&#39;t see it working. <br><br>Again, I&#39;m not a PG, but I really worry that you&#39;re starting too big. Can&#39;t you try a normal (so to speak) agent for a while, and then once you&#39;re in the swing of mission writing, change to your current favourites?</p>

            <p>Given that all of these people are my headvoices, have distinct personalities, and will basically be writing themselves, I&#39;m not too worried about character development.  About Fred the Plover... actually, you&#39;re partly responsible for his existence.  You said that plovers taste good with barbecue sauce, and I decided that my plover would be named Fred, but then couldn&#39;t decide whether or not to eat him.  This culminated in the decision to essentially do both, and have Fred the Plover as I described him.  I ask if I can include him because my head is a very strange place.  </p>

            <p>In remembering that only TWO of my characters in the past seven/eight years have ever dipped as low as 19 years old. Seriously, with one exception (a group RP that required the ages be set at high school levels), that&#39;s as low as I&#39;ve ever gone.<br><br>That counts my PPC characters so far, by the way, and totals to about ten or eleven different guys in total (but always guys.

            <p>I am sometimes worried by all those heavily sexualized Mary Sues (slim, big breasts, revealing clothes) who are self-inserts of 14-year-old Suethors with no first-hand romantic experience. For characters who are supposed to be perfect, Sues often lack a particular power: that of escaping the patriarchal mindset of our society. Sure, sexual emancipation of women is one of the things feminists have long fought for, and I fully support it. But some Sues are insults to the whole female gender, and it grieves me to know how young and influenceable the Suethors who created them usually are.</p>

            <p>The only way to bring it back in somehow in character would be to have him ditch her in an alley. And then go have a twenty minute conversation with a statue that represents virtue.<br><br>The mask being removed is Canon abomination, considering that in movie and graphic novel, the mask is concealing the man and therefore making it more of an idea. Which is why V shall never die, he is the epitome and or hope of anarchism/democracy. <br><br>Without getting too overzealous... if someone does take this as a mission, can one of my agents that I&#39;m working at for Permission be a guest member? </p>

<li>Gmail chat seems to be the most common method of PPCers IMing one another. Has the added benefit of google documents, which many of us find handy for betaing and what have you. Definitely recommended.<br><br>2. In theory yes, in practice no - I graduate in two months and have a lot of work to do before then.<br><br>3. Depends, as others have said, entirely on the context. Trojie&#39;s only telling half the story when she says she&#39;s sporked something under a thousand words - the shortest we&#39;ve taken on was a mere 216 words. We got a 3500 word mission out of it.

            <p>3) sprokableness depends not on the number of chapters or the word count. Though, the longer a fic the more charges you are likely to find. <br><br>Personally, I&#39;d like a fic to have a little bit of length at least 4-5 chapters or 5k words. But that&#39;s because I&#39;d like to find possibilities of good plot in fic and 800 word thingies rarely have enough meat to them to be able to say: bad execution, but there is a good idea behind this.</p>

            <p>A couple friends and I roleplay via Google Talk. We&#39;ve got a couple games going, depending on availability - one orginal one that&#39;s rather Final Fantasy-esque (the GM is a huge fan of FF, KH, Chrono Trigger, and so on), and another original one that I&#39;m GMing (which is all about psychics and the governments trying to kill them).</p>

            <p>Way back in the dawn of time, when Trojie and I first started writing together (not PPC missions), we used to email word documents to each other. It got confusing as all hell, and we&#39;d occasionally mislay bits. Then gmail brought out googledocs, and there was much rejoicing.<br><br>We&#39;ll usually find a mission first (Ansela is very good for this, as she is braver than me when it comes to trawling the Uber Pit). I have a dekko, assess the horror, and then send a link to Trojie. If she agrees to it, we copy and paste the entire thing into a googledoc and have a read through.<br><br>Then we go and beat our heads against a wall for a while. If there are a lot of charges that one of us will miss, for example if the fic&#39;s in a continuum only one of us knows, we&#39;ll go through highlighting charges so nothing&#39;s missed. This usually isn&#39;t necessary though; we pick up the charges as we go along.<br><br>When we&#39;re feeling brave, one of us will tag the other, and we get stuck in. We have an IM window open as well as the document, for throwing ideas about and reminding one another of important charges and what have you. One will write as much as they can, and then tag the other. And on we go, taking turns, until it&#39;s finished. Then it&#39;s proofreading and to the beta(s).</p>

            <p>Googledocs is a very convenient way, if you have Gmail. Almost every PPC mission I write is a cowrite between me and Pads, and we do it using Googledocs, which is basically a word document stored online, which multiple people can see and edit at once (although it spazzes if you are both trying to write at the same time, so it&#39;s better to take turns). Gdocs is also really convenient for beta-reading, because you can just share the document with your beta-reader and they can make direct edits. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve done it four ways: some of my joint missions were actually written by one author and then passed over for checking, some were written in real-time over IM programs (line by line, so like passing it back and forth), one was written line by line on a forum set up for the purpose (three authors, so we couldn&#39;t get on IM together much), and although not a mission, the early parts of the Reorganisation were split into sections and we each wrote our own parts. And there are other methods - some people seem to just do a commentary on the story together on IM and then write in the action later. So it really does depend. By far the /easiest/ is for one person to do all the writing and the other just to edit; possibly the most fun to write is real-time over IM. But, really, it comes down to choosing your own way.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a few agents active in Star Wars, Star Trek and SG Atlantis, but as far as I know none in Watchmen, House or Numb3rs. From what I&#39;ve heard, there&#39;s a lot of work in those fandoms. We don&#39;t chase Sues in original fiction, because technically those aren&#39;t Sues. </p>

            <p>But as some pointed out, we protect the plot continuum. Which means that if someone writes an Inheritance fanfic that is actually <i>better</i> than the canon (not too hard, I gather) but in doing so derails the characters (by making Eragon humble or Arya complex, for example), it would still be our duty to spork it. In theory, at any rate. In practice, I doubt any of us works in the Inheritance fandom. (I haven&#39;t even read it. My knowledge of it all comes from Anti-Shur&#39;tugal and the hilarious review of the film at the Agony Booth.)<br><br>If I were to spork something canon, I would attack <a href="http://badwebcomics.blogspot.com/2007/09/shredded-moose.html">this unspeakable abomination</a> (NSFW). Unfortunately I can&#39;t even do that.</p>

            <p>Have a granite pillow. :)<br><br>As for knowing how things work... If you haven&#39;t already read <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a>, do so, because that&#39;s the only unalterable canon. Also please take a look around <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">our Wiki</a>, particularly the article on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a>.<br><br>A few things: You can&#39;t PPC original fiction. By definition, the PPC can only patrol <i>fan</i>fiction of existing canonical stories - no matter how much we (well, many of us) hate <i>Eragon</i>, there&#39;s nothing we can do about it. Also, please pay a little more attention to your spelling and grammar. We can&#39;t correct mistakes if we make them ourselves. <br><br>Nice to meet you!<br><br>- Sedri</p>
