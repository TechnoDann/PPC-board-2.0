Especially since there&#39;s the question of how you&#39;re gonna spork it if the fic&#39;s gone. :P Seriously though, it&#39;d seem a bit pointless, and beyond the embarrassingly textbook nature of it there wasn&#39;t much to work with, with that Stu.</li>

            <p>Some of us have been discussing the article for <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Dusk_Daybreak">Dusk Daybreak</a> on the wiki, hoping to get some questions answered. The article was created by a Serenity Piper, whose only other major contribution to the wiki is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/File:AgentNyx.jpg">this image</a> of Nyx Nightingale. The three of us in the discussion aren&#39;t sure who Serenity Piper is, or if she&#39;s responsible for Dusk Daybreak and <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5191600/1/PPC_Dawn_and_Dusk">her missions</a>, or if she&#39;s just adding to the wiki. The missions are from the last couple of months, and I don&#39;t remember anybody posting about them on the Board. So, if anybody knows what&#39;s going on here, I at least would like to know.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>If nobody has any idea who the writer is, chances are she/he didn&#39;t bother getting Permission, which is sort of not okay. The point of Permission is to have a bit of quality control on what gets posted in the name of the PPC, and my personal feeling is that Dusk Daybreak&#39;s missions really needed someone to have raised an eyebrow and asked some questions about the Sueishness of the agents.<br><br>I&#39;d like for more of the Board to at least have a look at the article on the wiki and the attached discussion, if not read over the missions themselves, so there can be some more discussion about the matter. For one thing, I&#39;m not sure how to proceed with trying to bring the writer into a dialogue with us, because so far our comments on the wiki have gone unnoticed or ignored--not a good sign. I hesitate to comment on the missions themselves until I have a better idea of what you all think, so please speak your piece.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I ran across these on the Pit the other day, and left some vaguely encouraging comments (probably too encouraging, in retrospect) suggesting she check out the Board. I think I also mentioned the wiki. The idea was to gently lead into &#39;hey, you need Permission to do this, and I&#39;m pretty sure you don&#39;t have it&#39; without seeming to be nasty about it (especially if it turned out that she did have it after all), and also to introduce her to a place where she could get some advice/concrit on her writing (which, as you have said, did need it rather badly). <br><br>At my first reading, it looked like she&#39;d encountered The Original Series, but hadn&#39;t pursued things far enough to find out about the Board, wiki, Permission, etc., so I thought that it might be a good idea to introduce her to those things, since she was obviously keen. Primarily, though, I was just trying to find out if she was on the Board or not, so I could introduce her to the concept of Permission if necessary. I was expecting either to get a reply from the writer, or for her to introduce herself to the Board, rather than just posting stuff straight to the wiki.<br><br>In hindsight, though, I phrased things rather badly, which may have given her the wrong idea about the whole thing, and I probably should have linked her to the Permission page on the wiki as well. Apologies if I stuffed up. Anyway, if you want to start a dialogue, then she might respond to reviews on the story.<br><br>Btw, I also found these on the Pit: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3552696/1/PPC_An_Agents_Work_Is_Never_Done"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3552696/1/PPC_An_Agents_Work_Is_Never_Done">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3552696/1/PPC_An_Agents_Work_Is_Never_Done</a></a><br>Do they belong to anyone here?</p>

            <p>Mithril shouldn&#39;t exist in any fandom without a place called Moria. It translates to &#39;Moria silver&#39;. So why does <i>Oblivion</i> have mithril (which is nowhere near indestructable either)? Same goes for orcs. Weren&#39;t the orcs specific to LotR as well (not sure about this one)?</p>

            <p>I thought orc was a word from Middle-Earth&#39;s languages. Very well, I suppose others can use it. But mithril is unacceptable and I can&#39;t understand why the Tolkien estate hasn&#39;t sued. Mithril should at least be under trademark.</p>

            <p>how is the leveling system going to work?  Basically they are killing all the low level areas and making them high level (bloody awsome, but still high level).<br><br>Guess they want the origional cities to be used more again.

            <p>Some of the low level areas are still around.  Also, some of the high level areas are being reworked into low level areas.  Azshara is a good example of that.  I also recall seeing something called Path of the Titans that I believe had something to do with leveling.<br><br>They are going to be reworking all of the maps.  You will barely recognize the places that are still mostly unchanged by the geological upheaval.  They have start over from scratch to incorporate the flying into Kalimdor and The Eastern Kingdoms.</p>

            <p>Hello!<br>I&#39;m new around here but a long time PPC fan. Thought I&#39;d give a wave and hang around a bit and finally join up proper in the fight against canon desecration. So far I’ve been fighting the good fight through the art of sporking over at Deletrius and Scifi Sues (a much smaller sporking community where myself and a friend can poke fun at sues defiling our favoured canons.) My most highly loved canon is the new Battlestar Galactica closely followed by Mass Effect and Stargate.<br></p>

            <p>Cassie suggested we bring badfics for a reading, a la the legolas by laura one. I thought we should ask which ones people think would be good.<br><br>I&#39;m okay with pretty much anything as long as anything with strong bad language or sex scenes more detailed than the one in legolas by laura (&quot;and then he raped her and then laura said &#39;go away you bastard&#39;&quot;) won&#39;t end up on YouTube because my kid sister might see it, and then I would be in huge trouble. If everyone agrees not to put the squicky bits on YouTube, I&#39;ll bring the My Immortal drinking game from TVTropes. I think I&#39;ll also bring along the censored version of &quot;Artemis&#39; Lover&quot; and &quot;soulless shell&quot; - they&#39;re from less well-known fandoms than Harry Potter, but they bear so little resemblance to their supposed canons that everyone will find them funny anyway.</p>

            <p>I might see if I can find a suitable David Gonterman work. I&#39;ve heard bad things about his writing. Apparently in one memorable Sailor Moon fic, his self-insert character shoots the throne of the supervillain Lord Zedd with a normal sawn-off shotgun. Which is on the moon. While &quot;Davey&quot; is on the Earth. And totally destroys it. And somehow manages to not hit Lord Zedd himself, who was sitting in the throne at the time.</p>

            <p>How would one go about neuralyzing a character who, in this particular version of canon, may or may not actually have eyes? Said character will need urgent treatment for two bullet wounds to the spine acquired at point-blank range and possible infection brought on by some charlatan Sue&#39;s &quot;healing&quot; of such, so is it possible that Medical would be able to neuralyze him? Without taking his mask off? Perhaps intravenously?</p>

            <p>I’ve been replaying <i>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</i>, followed by rewatching <i>Ultimate Force</i> and now going straight into a short oneshot about neither fandom but still featuring the SAS. A couple of questions though.<br><br>First of all, there seems to be a bit of a discrepancy in one codeword. <i>CoD 4</i> uses ‘tango’ for the bad guys (i.e. Tango down, room One-Echo). However, <i>UF</i> and the NCOs back when I was in my school’s CCF use ‘X-ray’ (i.e. X-ray down, rear stairwell). Which is it? I’ve got a theory that Tango is an Americanism that <i>CoD 4</i> fell into, but I want to know for sure. I personally think X-ray sounds more awesome, but the SAS don’t care about being cool, just about getting in, getting the job down, getting out.<br><br>Secondly, does anyone know what OP or FAP means? I can’t think of a context for the former, but Dempsey from <i>UF</i> says “FAPs please, gentlemen,” just as they head off to go and shoot people.</p>

            <p>I think I know what they might be hinting at, in a way, by the words &quot;tango&quot;, &quot;echo&quot;, and &quot;x-ray&quot;. (As it is, I&#39;m not sure my insight will be all that helpful.)<br>This may sound really stupid, but I&#39;m positive that those code words are all taken from the military alphabet. Which, (partly because of the part the military plays in my relative&#39;s lives, partly because it&#39;s an interesting subject, and partly because memorizing the alphabet was fun), I decided to do a brief study on. <br>First, here&#39;s a handy link to the wikipedia page on it:<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alphabet"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alphabet">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alphabet</a></a><br>Anyway, the NATO alphabet is used in the military so that code words assigned to different letters of the alphabet don&#39;t get mixed up over telephone or radio communication. (e.g. &quot;B&quot; and &quot;D&quot; sort of sound alike.) I don&#39;t know what the code words are, but I&#39;m guessing they aren&#39;t the same for every mission. So, yeah. That&#39;s my thoughts on the subject.</p>

            <p>It probably wouldn&#39;t work. Even if you stopped them from being rescued, they are still sues. Sexually attractive out of character canons will probably keep coming out of the woodwork to save the day until the sue meets his/her true wuv.</p>

            <p>No Agent is well-enough liked or impossible enough to accomodate that the Flowers would create an entire <i>universe</i> for them. That brings me to my second point; the Flowers might have advanced technology, but that&#39;s something they just can&#39;t do. If they could, I get the feeling they would&#39;ve done it before, but for themselves, not Agents. My opinion/idea is that the Flowers would pick &#39;verses most able to accomodate the Agents, and if there are several there might be a choice involved (like Acacia deciding to retire to Rome). For example, if Tawaki&#39;s one of the ones you&#39;re retiring they&#39;d probably let him retire to Doctor Who. If they find <i>nothing</i>, which I doubt since we&#39;re talking an infinitely huge multiverse, they just wouldn&#39;t allow the Agents to retire yet.</p>

            <p>...KG, are you channelling me?<br><br>Retiring isn&#39;t something agents generally do. I can&#39;t see the Flowers or whoever setting up an entire world in which your agents can retire. I can see them okaying a world in which they can retire, but that&#39;s about it.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think the Flowers have discovered every &#39;verse there is. For example, Blue Photon, the Telyans, and Tango Dioxide (I might&#39;ve missed a couple) were all from the same original &#39;verse, and never did manage to actually find it. If they found one more sci-fi oriented for the Agents, they could put them there. An original universe without published works, but where the Agents&#39; presence wouldn&#39;t damage anything (maybe with some help from Disguise Generators). I think your best bet is that or Doctor Who.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m half-wondering if this is going to happen every August. The idea of switching to a more controllable forum now that Oddlots seems to be down for good, maybe with a post on the Board explaining where we went, could do nicely, I guess. The alternative is using <i>this</i> one as our main Board, since it never seems to get hit by spammers.</p>

            <p>I think the reason this Board doesn&#39;t get hit by spammers is because we don&#39;t use it that frequently. There&#39;s no point-- from a bot&#39;s perspective (I think...), or a troll&#39;s-- in spamming a forum where nobody&#39;s around. The activity on the &#39;Board is generally pretty high, so spamming is more likely. If we switched to this link, we&#39;d probably start getting hit here, too.<br><br><sub>Also, the link is harder to remember.</sub></p>

            <p>--And here I have to point out that I&#39;ve never seen the Star Trek episodes in question myself--but I believe the reason was that the PPC&#39;s Medical Department was simply too swamped with casualties, and with actually fighting off the viruses, to synthesize the cure.

            <p>Of course, I had a teensy sneak-peek, hahaha. I found the second part as a whole particularly interesting, especially the process of Derik going through the reality room.

It was a really interesting take on things, and it was nice to see kind of alternative war stories to the &#39;main&#39; events of each crisis.

            <p>Lovely, all of it! A great morning read. I like... well, all of it, especially the overall cohesion, as well as some littler things, my absurdness insists that I randomly mention a few: Luke going out to play hero, for instance - very typical.

How fitting :D<br><br>Also, I really like how you&#39;ve written the inclusion of the Duty Song, as well as the Reality Room, and how it affected E&#39;rik/Derik.

            <p>I have to second the love of the way the Reality Room was handled. You noticed, Neshomeh, I&#39;m sure, that I had very little beta-y comments to make in that section? &#39;s &#39;cause I couldn&#39;t find anything much to quibble over that managed to make itself heard over the general feeling of being masterfully pulled in to a really excellent and well thought out bit of narrative. In fact, anyone reading this who hasn&#39;t read the fic, consider this a plug - it&#39;s worth it for that bit if nothing else.<br><br>Sedri - I also considered what would happen if Iza was shoved in there. While the results would be interesting, I&#39;m not sure they&#39;d help Trojie and I to write her, so maybe we&#39;ll avoid it for now, but it was an interesting mental exercise nonetheless. Especially when I started considering the effects of the room on every other agent we write. And then Marsha.</p>

            <p>...<i>not</i> to test that theory. Most Agents should avoid that room, I think - not just the ones born in badfics, but also those who&#39;ve been through experiences that they otherwise wouldn&#39;t have survived. The results could get... messy.</p>

            <p>The room probably would&#39;ve just rationalised how they managed to survive it, working with what&#39;s known of the &#39;verse and events. So it might not be too messy, but it depends on the Agent and such.</p>

            <p>-ake. Whether the League did it or not, the character decided to blame the EPC. For some reason. And I pretty much have to agree with what&#39;s been said before, especially about the desperation angle; that was a refreshing change from a setting that oft sees attackers get utterly curbstomped. I&#39;ve thought of doing something like this before, but I wasn&#39;t sure if I could do it justice, and I thought that the community as a whole would be sick of this kind of thing and not want to hear more of it.</p>
