Fifteen is sitting out on the bathroom roof watching Tom jump for the fun of it, and the triples were for singles, and everything tasted of vodka.<br><br>Sixteen? You could be sixteen!

            <p>We here at <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/fanfic_land/">Fanfic Land</a> are starting to get a little worried. We haven&#39;t seen any of our great writers in the <b>PPC</b> section for quite a while... in fact, it&#39;s been a whole year!! Have you all forgotten about us?!<br><br>But since we don&#39;t hold grudges, we forgive you all. In fact, we&#39;d love to have you back -- or if you&#39;re a new writer since last year, we&#39;d just love to have you! So why not come by, show off your creative talents, at Fanfic Land -- The Fanfic You Can&#39;t Find Anywhere Else!<br><br>((Or, in other words, it&#39;s July again, which makes it time for the annual PPC Badfic Game. This is the game where we poke fun at:<br><br>1) Badfic authors.<br>2) Reviewers of badfic authors, be they squealing fangirls, bitter flamers, or whatever.<br>3) Ourselves and the entire PPC.<br><br>We do this, of course, by writing deliberately bad fanfiction of the PPC. The conceit is that an internet archive, Fanfic Land, accepts fanfic of the PPC -- so anything you&#39;d see in LotR, Potterverse, Redwall or whatever shows up in the PPC section.<br><br>Unfortunately my coding skills aren&#39;t massive, so what we (and &#39;we&#39; means anyone on the Board -- this game doesn&#39;t require Permission or anything else) actually do is post stories and reviews on the Board (in this thread, please, and preferably with reviews all attached to the right stories), and I upload them all onto FfL. And make things like author bios while I do so.<br><br>Now, this is all supposed to be fun -- and remember, if you get flamed, <i>it&#39;s not real</i>, it&#39;s just another aspect of the game -- so enjoy yourselves! It&#39;d help me if people can include a rating, genre and summary on their stories, and an author bio if you aren&#39;t a return customer, or want to update yours ;). Plus, remember to pick a badfic author name for yourself -- you can see the sort of things people use on the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/fanfic_land/Page1.htm">PPC Section</a> of FfL. Let&#39;s see if we can keep the thread entirely in-character.<br><br>Enjoy!<br><br>hS))<br><br>((Oh, and to anticipate a comment from Laburnum, you&#39;re probably best off not writing about Stormsong or Skyfire, for copyright reasons. The rest of the PPC, though -- <i>anyone</i> or <i>anything</i> in it -- is available for you to do <i>anything</i> to. Take a look over the past three years&#39; entries if you don&#39;t believe me! ~hS))</p>

            <p><b>Rating:</b> G<br><b>Genre:</b> General, Romance<br><b>Category:</b> Official Fanfiction Universities<br><b>Summary:</b> Prequel to Masquerade of OFUM. Lilith Wydenbrooke is selected to attend OFUM! A Frodo Fangirl, what happens to her when Legolas falls for her? R/R please!<br><br><b>Author’s Notes:</b> This is the prequel to “Masquerade of OFUM”! Hope you enjoy reading it and Read and Review! Please!<br><b>The Diary of Lilith Wydenbrooke</b><br>September 1st <br>OFUM<br>Dearest Elwing,<br>    My name is Lilith Wydenbrooke, and I will be your best friend throughout our years together here at OFUM, the Official Fanfiction University, Middle-earth. Somebody left you on my bed, and I find it very nice (and handy) to have a new friend and confidant. <br>   First off, I would like to tell you of all the exciting things that have happened so far in my life. On Earth I am an ordinary preteen girl who is trying to survive the sudden onslaught if hormones. In fact, I find Frodo absolutely adorable! So right then and there, after I had read the trilogy three times through (each book, mind you), the Hobbit two times through, and the Silmarillion’s “Of Beren and Luthien” section six times (I read the rest at least four times through), I decided to watch the movies, and Frodo was even cuter! So then, I wrote a batch of crossovers and a few drabbles, and then, I wrote a Tenth Walker Mary-Sue. Well, I wrote it purely out of curiosity, and, so, curiosity sent the cat to Middle-earth. <br>    I have a carbon of my acceptance letter and registration form. Here it is:<br><br>Official Fanfiction University, Middle-earth<br>Headmaster: [That’s for me and the staff to know, and you to find out. Signed, Miss Cam]<br>Assistant Headmaster: Gandalf Stormcrow<br>Course co-ordinator: Miss Camilla Sandman<br>Head of staff: Aragorn, son of Arathorn, King Elessar, Strider, Wingfoot, the Elfstone, etc.
<br>Dear Miss Lilith Wydenbrooke,<br>   We are not completely pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at OFUM, the Official Fanfiction University, Middle-earth. We have become aware of your most recent fanfiction piece entitled “A Mary Sue in Middle Earth”.<br> Below is a list of subjects you will be covering this year and your registration form. Please fill out the form. <br>   We hope to see you at OFUM tomorrow via Rohan Express carriage! <br>                                            Signed, Miss Cam<br><br>Official Fanfiction University, Middle-earth<br>Registration Form<br>NAME: _________________<strong><em><br>RACE:<br>Elf/Hobbit/Dwarf/Man (Homo Sapiens)/*Other (please specify) _</em></strong>_______<strong><em><br>*Note: if your race is one that can enchant males, the influence will not affect them here at OFUM.<br>GENDER: <br>Male   Female<br>LUST OBJECT:<br>Legolas/Frodo/Aragorn/Boromir/Pippin/Merry/Sam/Other (please specify) _</em></strong>________<br>FEAR OF SPIDERS:<br>Yes/No<br>FEAR OF HEIGHTS:<br>Yes/No<br>PERFERRED DARK LORD:<br>Sauron/Morgoth<br>CHOOSE A NUMBER:<br>Ten/Nine/Eleven<br><br> So that’s pretty much what the form looked like, really. So I filled it out, and went to sleep, as it was nighttime, you see. When I woke up, I was being tossed around in a carriage. That continued for some time before we pulled up to an imposing castle. There was a wide lake, and a forest of Ents, I believe. Looked quite like Hogwarts, if I do say so myself.<br>Now, Elwing, did you know that my Student Advisor is LEGOLAS THRANDUILLION, of all the Elves in Arda. I had wished for Elrond or Frodo. I’d choose Elrond since he would actually give advice, seeing as how Imladris is, according to canon, supposed to be a place where one gets advice and knowledge. And I wanted Frodo because of my hormones. What?<br>You know what else, Elwing? Legolas actually seemed enthusiastic about this whole ordeal, as he insisted on escorting me right into the auditorium. Why then, I ask you, did Eru give me legs? If he insists on propelling me around, I will never need to walk again. How nice. <br>But he is quite a polite elf, in some ways. He kissed my hand and now half the girls in the University are trying to fish the details out of me, including my own roommate, Nimloth. She is a Legolas Luster and an elf as well. As long as it isn’t Rosalie Berthilide Evangeline Eglantine Pottermalfoy Sparrowturner Hawkesbury I shall be fine, actually. Really, does the wretch need so many names? She is also a Chibi Elf Mary Sue. Trying to catch Legolas’s attention, obviously. As if. Didn’t she read the form?   <br>September 2nd<br>OFUM<br>Dearest Elwing,<br>   I think I have a “secret” admirer. I went to the library this morning and when I returned to the dorm to change for the party tonight I found a dress on my bed. There was a note attached to the green brooch on the matching cloak. Not idly do the leaves of Lothlorien fall, and yet the cloak was of Lothlorien make, yet made for dances. I think this person who is giving me these gifts must be one of the Fellowship members after Moria. <br>    Here is the note: <br><i>Dearest Lilith, <br>   I love your hair, like midnight in silky rivers. <br>   I love your eyes, like the grey twilight. <br>If I made it clear that I love you, would you set your hands in mine?<br>We have met before, and we shall meet again, melamin.<br>~ An Elvish Admirer</i><br><br>I think the “Elvish Admirer” just made it clear who he is. Better not tell anyone who lusts after him, which is, what? Half of OFUM?<br>Later: <br>  Dance was absolutely wonderful. Danced with Legolas a lot, before he noticed that a red-haired girl began hitting on Gimli. The girl fainted in his arms and Legolas carried her off to bed. Very nice of him, actually.    <br><br>~~<br><i>Miss Cam blinked as she looked at the diary. It was urple, with pages in wilver covered in blello ink. “What in Eru’s good name IS this?” she demanded of thin air.<br>The thin air was not sentient, so it did not reply.<br>The incensed Course Co-ordinator stood up, urple diary loosely clutched in her hand as if it might explode. “I need to alert the staff and the mini-Balrogs. This menance must be stopped. Immediately.”<br>With that, she strode from the empty classroom.</i><br></p>

            <p>Honest Critic&#39;s bio: <br><br>I am a naturally talented editor and proofreader with more than a year of experience with story-writing. I know how to avoid all pitfalls and cliches, so if anyone ever needs advice, you are welcome to email me. My stories aim to show how excellent an institution the PPC truly is, and perhaps improve the overall quality of writing on Fanfic Land (which, by the way, should always be spelled as two words, no matter what the site logo seems to imply). <br><br>A few tips for all writers: <br>- Check your spelling and grammar. There is NO EXCUSE for not doing this! If you are incapable, either don&#39;t write or ask for help. I am more than willing to provide assistance, free of charge.<br><br>- NEVER insert author&#39;s notes into your text. This is messy and distracting and always unecessary. If your story doesn&#39;t tell us what we need to know, it&#39;s a bad story.<br><br>- Respect all reviewers. If you are told you need to take the story down and completely re-write it, do so. They know what they&#39;re talking about.<br><br>~<br><br>Title: The Respectful Tale of Canon Correction<br>Rating: G (Because no story ever needs to include anything indecent.)<br>Genre: General (What is it with all this romance recently? Once upon a time, the PPC was about improving quality. <br>Summary: Two agents, Honesty Jones and Charity Whipple, discuss their recent experiences in the PPC Cafeteria, and launch a brilliant plan to restore the agency to its original, pure form.<br><br><br>Agent Honesty Jones, former Bad Slash agent, worked in the Department of Finance and was quite competant. Agent Charity Whipple was active, diligently working to ensure that only the best slash stories were presented to the world at large. The two were friends, and met regularly for tea and coffee in the Cafeteria. <br><br>One day, Honesty said, &quot;My friend, I regret to say that I believe the PPC is taking a turn for the worse.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I agree,&quot; replied Charity. &quot;No one seems to care about purity anymore.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we were the only two agents left in all the PPC who truly care about restoring goodness and truth to the Word Worlds.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Honesty, my friend,&quot; said Charity, getting an idea; &quot;I have an idea. We should do something about this terrible problem.&quot;<br><br>&quot;My dear Charity, it is not our place. We should never question Upstairs, no matter how foolish their choices may be.&quot;<br><br>&quot;My dear Honesty, that is precisely my point. They are making foolish choices, such as allowing agents with obvious mental issues to be partners. If they cannot see that, they do not deserve to BE &#39;Upstairs&#39;. We should. We should take over management of the PPC.&quot;<br><br>Honesty considered this. Charity was right, but then, Charity had a tendency to be over-enthusiastic at times when she had consmued just a little more sugar than her diet allowed (Honesty would never say so, of course, for Charity was nervous about her weight, and once had even consumed a glass of alcohol in her worry over it). However, being enthusiastic - or &quot;passionate&quot;, as was the more polite term - was not a bad thing, and Honesty decided that her dear friend was right.<br><br>&quot;Charity, you are right. The PPC needs a firm hand to ensure its future. We must be that hand. Come; we shall talk to the Department Heads one by one until they conceed to our request.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you, my friend. However, I suggest we save the Bad Slash Department for last; it is a fine line we Slash agents walk with regards to characterisation. All too often I have found myself forced to destroy many promising relationships that could be legally labelled &#39;AU&#39; and promoted more worldwide peace and harmony with regards to the issue of personal sexuality.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You must always be careful, Charity, not to let your good and noble intentions blind you to the issues of characterisation. It is a true shame that so few original story writers are brave enough to face criticism for including bi- and homosexuality in their stories, but it is not our place to allow poorly characterised stories to continue to exist simply because they &#39;even out&#39; the overall bias towards heterosexuality.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed, you are right Honesty; I simply grieve for those poor, unfortunate souls who will remain in True Angst forever. Perhaps we should also consult with the Department of Angst...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Charity,&quot; warned Honesty firmly, &quot;not yet. First we must ensure that the PPC itself functions properly. Then we shall see about changing policies.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You are right, of course,&quot; said Charity. &quot;Let us begin our journey. I suggest we see the Sunflower Official first...&quot;<br><br>~ End of Chapter One ~</p>

Several of them, not hinted at any of the exsisting mission reports, will also include details of the immense conspiracies that exsist only in the minds of Agents who drink too much bleepka. There will be lots of blood and gore, and scences filled with robotically nonarousing sex that will bore you to sleep.</b><br><br>Agent Lyta Holling walked the corridors of HQ, humming to herself. She had just become an Agent, and was eager to meet her new partner, Agent Tara-Something. She knew that like all other Agents, she was slightly insane. But hopefully, that won&#39;t pose an obstacle to her overtures of friendship. She slowed her pace in order not to bump into anyone, and in a quiet spot, she offered a libation to the Ironic Overpower in order to make sure that everything went smoothly.   <br><br>She then continued on her way, and reached Agent Tara&#39;s RC. Then, it hit her: She had been keping track of where she was going, something that in the PPC, was supposed to get her <i>lost</i>, not the opposite. Did her libation cause all that, or was it something more ominous? <br><br>Her question was answered when she found Agent Tara dead on the floor, surrounded by a pool of blood.<br><br>A <i>thing</i> stood over her body, bits of gore dripping from its jaws. Doing the ovious thing, Agent Lyta ran. She got out a potion that was made of Tv.Tropes pages mixed with Bleepka, and drank it. She was told that it brought her extra luck and increased her speed to high levels. Actually, it was only a placebo, although she had no way to tell at that point.<br><br>She ran and ran, knowing that her pursuer was close. She used her RA to portal to world after world, closing them as she went. That was how she finally arrived in nWOD&#39;s Arcadia. Knowing what would happen to her if she stayed, she fiddled with her RA, pouring another libation to the Ironic Overpower as she did so. Thankfully, that was enough to create another portal, which she hopped into without hesitation.<br><br>She found herself in a grey chamber. Thinking that she was back in HQ, she then sat down on the surprisingly soft floor. There was a TV and Popcorn, and a remote with only one button. Despite suspicions about all three objects (especially the remote) she began making herself comfortable. Then, another portal opened up, and a figure clothed in an inspector&#39;s longcoat emerged from it.<br><br>&quot;What are you doing Here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sorry! I tought it was HQ and-&quot;<br><br>Then Lyta remembered that the only ones who had that kind of portal technology other than the PPC were its enemies.<br><br>She got up and going into what approximated a fighting stance, she faced the stranger.<br><br>&quot;Do not worry. I am not the one that killed your partner, but rather his enemy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How do you know about that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let&#39;s just say that I know many things, and have ways to know more. I was part of your organization once, and I never formally left.&quot;<br><br>This guy was a part of the PPC? Agent Lyta&#39;s stance softened. <br><br>&quot;What do you mean, formally?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am still regarded as part of it by the Flowers, at least those of them that still remember me. I was sent here on a mission, and while I have disregarded it, I still plan to complete it someday, although I don&#39;t think I can get the chance now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Press the remote, and observe why.&quot;<br><br><i>Observe?</i> What a fine choice of words...<br><br>She decided to take a chance, and pressed it.   </p>

They conversed in hurried whispers, pondering on how to make full use of their victories.<br><br>Their leader, a balding man wearing corporate clothes, read one of the reports and said:<br><br>&quot;Ahh. So Jayacacia has managed to get her husband back.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes. They are now enjoying themselves in the My Immortal verse.&quot; Said one of the NMG excecutives seated just to the left of him. <br><br>&quot;Ahh...My Immortal. Ebony&#39;s usefulness is ending, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, it is. Maybe its time to restore the Harry Potter Canon to a more...faithful state.&quot;<br><br>&quot;True. Canon Defilement is profiting us less and less...&quot;<br><br>&quot;By the way, I&#39;m pleased to mention that our Code Geass sues have managed to get Lelouch vi Britannia to Geass himself into serving us. That way, we don&#39;t have to lower his intelligence by 90% in order to make him our lackey.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good. Have him Geass Light Yagami and David Xanatos as well. That way, we can stop turning their brains to putty on a regular basis.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now, are the modifications to the Necron Technology ready?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Yes. With these improved pylons, we can cut off universes from fanfic influence at will. We can also select specific fanfics to allow into the Word Worlds if nescessary, as long as they have a situation that profits us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good. Now, how about the Sunflower Emperor?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dead. We used our influence over Legal to alter narrative law so he doesn&#39;t come back.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Very Good. Now the EPC will destroy itself, and we will have other Multiverses as our oyster, once we have finished with this one. Now, how about the Hornbeam?&quot;    </p>

            <p>&quot;Now, how about the Hornbeam?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He has taken over a large percentage of the PPC HQ. He has also began to instrumentalize several universes, making quarantine measures harder to implement.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Send several Chaos Space Marines to those universes. We must nip this threat in the bud. What about the other threat, Inquisitor Tawaki?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He has finished torturing innocent OFUer&#39;s. <i>Not</i> infilitrating the Offical Fanfiction University of Alagesiд<br>was a masterstroke. Now, all of our possible opponents are worse than us, making us the lesser of three evils.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good. Now, send some World Devestators to Alagesiд itself, that way, we can get extra war material while pleasing the fans.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So we&#39;re going to publish our activities on the Real World, then?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes. We are. Once we undo the Digimon 02 ending, Nia&#39;s death in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, and the entire Legacy of the Force series, we&#39;ll recive their adulation, making us invincible.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good, Good. How goes the Haruhi Suzumiya capture plan?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We shoudn&#39;t reveal any more details about that, just in case.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Very well.&quot;<br><br>===<br><br>The Embodiment of all Flames gazed at the war going across the Multiverse, and laughed. Now that the PPC had been destroyed, and all the organizations that should be guarding fanfiction were squabbling over the spoils, he can feed the fires of Fan Dumb himself, gaining him more power.<br><br>Just a small suggestion to his pawns on the Pit of Voles, and all the PPC&#39;s reports in the Real World will be transferred to Fanfiction.net. The resulting flamewars that would result won&#39;t alert the Multiversal combatants, but they ought to give him enough strength to weaken the locks to his prison.<br><br>Then, he would start shipping threads everywhere, for all possible pairings in fiction, especially the hated ones. After that, he will create a fic so bad,<i>all</i> Fanfic would be banned, causing more flamewars and ending the Multiversal Organization&#39;s support networks.<br><br>Then, he would set himself free, and consume all creation in a blaze of unrelenting fury.<br><br>===<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s an embodiment of all the Internet&#39;s flames? If so, i&#39;d expect him to be more terrifiying.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And he isn&#39;t?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, he is; but not as much as i&#39;d expect. Compared to what i&#39;d read up on in the Warhammer 40k and World of Darkness-old and new-Wikis, he&#39;s just second-rate.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ahh.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Also, I think this apocalypse is losing steam. The NMG wish to preserve the Multiverse after taking it over, the Hornbeam&#39;s hive mind isn&#39;t spreading fast enough, and Inquisitor Tawaki is just insane. Also, the latter two don&#39;t really have any depth at all, along with the Embodiment of all Flames.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Isn&#39;t that for the best? I mean, the narrative law saying villains without any depth must die hasn&#39;t been altered yet, to my knowledge.&quot;<br><br>&quot;True, but still; if this is the Apocalypse-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Time of Judgement, actually.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fine, Time of Judgement, then. Now, as I was saying, if this is the Time of Judgement, it should at least be spectacular. I mean, if the Multiverse is going to die, it should at least be with a side of awesome.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Agreed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you, Makes-Things.&quot;<br><br><b>Author&#39;s Note: If you want to make the end of the PPC spectacular, how would you do it? Tell me, so that Agent Lyta doesn&#39;t cry! Do you want her to cry?</b><br></p>

Ebony is <i>my</i> friend, in more ways than one!&quot;<br><br>&quot;So you would defy the will of the NMG, which has stated that restoring the Harry Potter canon is the most beneficial move for it? You poor fool...&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not a fool! I&#39;m the SO&#39;s wife!&quot; Jayacacia then summoned her husband, who had replaced Dumbledore as the headmaster of Goffik!Hogwarts. He was wearing black robes made of leather and his petals were dyed red while his head had white foundation on it. His staff now had a pentagram (bcause D&amp;d is Stanic, u see, &amp; hi sstaff cum from d&amp;D) and-<br><br>Author&#39;s Note: There is not enough memory in my computer for the rest of the description.<br><br>&quot;Hahahahaha! <i>He&#39;s</i> your only support? Now see mine.&quot; With a wave of her hand, she summoned an army of Greater Daemons from the ruins of OFUM, and unleashed them upon the two. At the same time, great wings burst from her back, and she began flying over the two.<br><br>Jayacacia, who was wearing a bikini made of temperate and tropical leaves (to signify that she represented all of the world&#39;s forests, rather than a single continent&#39;s) drew her whip, Rosebud, and used it to banish a Great Unclean One back into the ruins of OFUM. At the same time, the Sunflower Official unleashed a Prismatic Spray upon a Bloodthirster, turning it to stone. They then took on an Lord of Change, and won. Then, a Keeper of Secrets slashed at Jayacacia with his pincer, wounding her. The SO, in a rage, used a powerful Lightning Bolt at it, to no avail. Just when it seemed that the Daemon will consume the two, however, reinforcements finally arrived.<br><br>&quot;U wil no tch Jayacacia or my nam isn&#39;t Ebony Dementia Dark&#39;ness Raven Way! Avda Kedabra!&quot; A beam of green light the struck the Keeper of Secrets in the chest, killing it.<br><br>A beautiful figure dressed in-<br><br>Author&#39;s Note: The computer doesn&#39;t have enough memory, again.<br><br>-rushed over to the wounded Jayacacia, and said:<br><br>&quot;NO!

She then-<br><br>-got herself split in two as Psycho!Thundera threw a giant shuriken at her.<br><br>&quot;Ebony! No!&quot;said Jayacacia at the death of her friend. She then healed herself and grew her own wings (eagle, in order to emphasize her connection to nature) and flew.<br><br>Psycho!Thundera waved her sword, but the pink wires that came out from it were easily evaded by Jayacacia, who stuck back using her whip. She then unleashed a storm of razor-sharp leaves upon her enemy, causing her pain.<br><br>&quot;You will pay for that, bitch!&quot;<br><br>Psycho!Thundera then sheathed herself in a column of light, which began to emit beams of searing energy. Jayacacia was struck by several of them, and screamed. <br><br>&quot;AHHHHH!&quot;<br><br>&quot;No! Jayacaciaaa!&quot; The SO then flew up and unleashed a Disintigrate. It hit the column of light, but was deflected to the ground. Psycho!Thundera then emerged from the column, stronger than ever. She then unleashed a storm of fire upon the Flower, which she then followed up with frost. Before the SO can regain the initiative, she then conjured up more giant shurikens and threw them at the Flower.<br><br>Just before they came into contact with his flesh, Jayacacia then recovered, and parried them all with her whip. She then closed in to engage Psycho!Thundera in melee.<br>The duel continued for several hours, with both combatants showing unusual skill. Finally, however, Psycho!Thundera cut apart Rosebud, and prepared a fatal strike. Jayacacia then turned her body into crystal, absorbing the sword into her body. She and Psycho!Thundera then began to show off their skill in unarmed combat, using every martial arts skill in the Multiverse in an attempt to gain an edge upon each other.<br><br>Finally, Jayacacia seemed to gain the advantage, as her crystalline body proved immune to the enemy&#39;s blows. But Psycho!Thundera just cheated, and conjured up a chainsaw immune to absorption by Jayacacia&#39;s body. She then rained blows down on her opponent, drinking her screams like the purest whiskey. The SO tried to interfere, but was set upon by several Daemonettes.<br><br>Draco and Harry then arrived at this point, but instantly reverted to their canon selves at the sight of Ebony&#39;s dead body. NMG Grey Knights then teleported in and carried them off before the Daemons caught sight of them. Finally, Jayacacia lost all hope, and tumbled into the whirling mass below. After several minutes, they were banished back to the ruins of OFUM, leaving only an indiscribable mass of shattered crystals.<br><br>Psycho!Thundera then laughed. Despite the fact that canon had to be preserved to accomplish it, the Harry Potter canon was now NMG territory. Forever.<br><br>===<br><br>&quot;Give me five cents, Makes-Things.

            <p><b>Chapter one: A School Falls.<br><br>Disclaimer: I don&#39;t own Warhammer 40k, I just looked at its wiki. I don&#39;t own D&amp;D either, I just read Order of the Stick</b><br><br>OFUM was doing nicely, Miss Cam tought as she walked its corridors smiling. The students were learning at a fast pace,if only to avoid the more painful exercises. That was copuled with good weather conditions, better and better food (the measures that were taken to keep Gandalf from the kitchen were geting more effective as time passed)and a general sense of well-being that prevaded the premises.<br><br>It was all due to the method of pouring libations to the Ironic Overpower that had been spreading lately. Normally, she would have rejected it as a dangerous superstition, albeit one that had spread through the Canon Protection Initiative like wildfire. Wildfire caused by political flames from the 08&#39; elections, no less. However, not only had it come from her friend, Miss Brin, but it also appeared to work. There was a large Vambiolaria outbreak at that time, but after a few days of offerings, large amounts of the cure were found and sucssesfully disturbed to the populace. <br><br>So several members of her staff tried it, and large numbers of the student body joined too. Eventually, she found herself doing the ritual several times a day. She threw her head back, letting her long hair flow out.<br><br>She looked at the Garden and saw the Canons and the students cooperating to pour more libations to appease the Ironic Overpower. They were singing in Queyna while doing so, the students having taken pleasure in learning the language. Many who have finished the ritual were laughing while they ate fruit from the orchards of southern Gondor and the Shire. They looked really happy, especially the ones pouring the libations. Miss Cam was debating on whether to join them, when the Canons and Students took off their clothes and began an orgy.<br><br>Man and Woman, Man and Man, Woman on Woman, Girl on Boy, Boy on Boy, Girl on Girl, and Man on Boy, Woman on Boy, Man on Girl and Woman on...oh, you get the drift! They were doing it like they were in My Immortal, as well. As Miss Cam decided to charge towards them in order to stop the depravity, Thundera Tiger appeared before her, her eyes filled with glitter and holding a sueish looking sword. Miss Cam put two and two together.<br><br>&quot;I see. It&#39;s ovious now. The Libations were just a gambit by what centralized authority the Sues have put together in order to undermine us. And it worked.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hahahahaha! The Sues? This plan encompasses more than them alone. This is a wide-ranging conspiracy that encompasses all badfic, as well as people who, though not Sues themselves-some of them are actually Goofic writers who just want power that only Canon Defilement can give-, have joined together to take down the CPI and replace it with a regime that will rule over the Multiverse with an Admantium fist.&quot;<br><br>Thundera Tiger then waved her sword and several pink wires sprang out of it and tied up Miss Cam.<br><br>&quot;Snap out of it! You&#39;re not a Sue, Thundera!&quot;<br><br>&quot;But I am now. And no, there is no way you can snap me out, not at this point in the story!&quot; <br><br>&quot;Now look at the garden, and see the fall of OFUM!&quot;<br><br>Miss Cam did as was told, and saw a slight shimmer in the air above the orgy. As she looked, the shimmer grew in size, becoming more ovious by the second. Then, a tear in space emerged at the center of the shimmer, which resembled deciptions of the Eye of Terror that Students versed in Warhammer 40k lore had shown her.<br><br>Then, Various Daemons (full-size, no less!) charged out of the rip and began tearing apart, infecting, mutating, and violating the orgy&#39;s participants. Not in that order, either. Miss Cam was almost driven insane at the sight. Then, the Daemons finshed with their prey and looked at her.<br><br>She tried to crawl away, but her traitorous former friend stepped on Miss Cam&#39;s neck, restraining her. She laughed. <br><br>&quot;Hahahahaha! Do you think i&#39;ll just let you escape!? No, you&#39;re going to suffer what your staff and students did, and more!&quot; As she spoke, a daemoinaclly possesed Gimli (who was wearing a coat made from Lina&#39;s skin) walked towards her and begin to feel her up.<br><br>&quot;Farewell, Miss Cam!&quot; Thundera teleported out just as waves of pleasure and pain coursed through Miss Cam&#39;s body.<br><br><b>Author&#39;s Note: First Chapter finished!

She was the first one that suggested that they protect themselves by gaining character levels in D&amp;D classes, perferably those able to cast spells.<br><br>Second was the Tiger Lily, now a Sorcerer/Archmage with seven Soul Splices (granted, the only powers capable of giving it to her can only do it once a century, but time travel can remedy that quite nicely). Granted, they were considerably less powerful than the ones given to the Canon Character Vaarsuvius, but the ones that weren&#39;t of specialized prestige classes were easy to learn about and use, and had several tricks that could prove useful in an apocalypse.<br><br>Third was Hornbeam, now a Druid. <br><br>Fourth was the Marquis de Sod, now a Bard. <br><br>Fifth was the good Captain Dandy, now a paladin of causes (Canon being the cause, if you can&#39;t tell). <br><br>These made up the Secret-Self-Defence-Circle,the secret conspiracy formed to prepare for the coming destruction.<br><br><b>Author&#39;s Note: I&#39;m not updating this story until I get 5 good reviews.</b> <br><br><br><br></p>

At the same time, armies of pink-clad fangirls portaled into DoDAEG and began to &quot;do it&quot; with the corpses stored there, cutting off the power all over HQ, and the food in the Cafeteria came to life and turned into a surging mass of horrible monstrosites, who ate everyone in their path.

            <p>The Secret-Self-Defence-Circle (SSDC) was watching all this from a hidden command center situated on the second floor in the Starbucks&#39; outside of HQ.<br><br><i>HQ is falling</i> said the Sub Rosa, who was sipping an Ice Mocha Latte.<br><br><i>There is still hope</i> said the SO. <i>Captain Dandy and the Tiger lily have been sent to Legal with all the Weeds we can spare, and several Agents have been safely evacuated to the New Caledonia haven.</i> <br><br><i>The Canon Nursery is safe as well. The NMG hasn&#39;t targeted children yet, and don&#39;t plan to even if they take over Legal. </i><br><br><i>Really? Thank you, Marquis. Hornbeam, what do you plan to do about the destruction of your department?</i><br><br><i>Avenge them. Techno-Daan and Tess were competent staff members, and without them, I don&#39;t think DoSAT will be a viable Department of the PPC. Do I have permission to ressurect them?<br><br>Yes. Here are two scrolls of True Ressurection Captain Dandy picked up in the OOTS universe.</i>said the SO.<br><br><i>Have one Architeuthis picked up, as well. You need to ressurect Makes-Things, you know</i> said the Sub Rosa.<br><br><i>Ah. But Makes-Things isn&#39;t really dead, you know.</i><br><br><i>What, he isn&#39;t?<br><br>No. He isn&#39;t. You see, I brainwashed him around the time of the Mary Sue invasion, so that he can work on fulfilling my true agenda since the destruction of Origin: </i>INSTRUMENTALITY!<i></i><br><br>Suddenly, the Hornbeam&#39;s old form exploded as a grotesque monstrosity of wood and metal burst out from it.<br><br>Acting quickly, the Sunflower official attempted a Time Stop, but the Hornbeam blasted him with a powerful Firestorm. Thankfully, the Flower had used an extra powerful buff to protect himself against fire.<br><br>The Marquis began to play a powerful Bardsong, but was stopped by several wires that burst from the deranged Hornbeam. The Sub Rosa tried to free him with a psionic strike against the wires, but was in turn entangled in them.<br><br><i>Why?</i> asked the SO.<br><br><i>Why, would you ask </i>why<i>? Ever since you became the leader of the Organization, you have only settled for stanching the wounds in Canon, the symptoms of the Multiverse&#39;s disease. What&#39;s more, you have not excised the natural features of Canon that attract such </i>filth<i>, but also insist on </i>protecting<i> them!<br><br>And what do you expect me to do? Be like the Mysterious Somebody?<br><br>At least he tried to create a soltution to the Multiverse&#39;s problems! He tried to bring unity!</i> UNITY! <i><br><br>You&#39;ve gone insane.<br><br>Insane, am I? Perhaps. Perhaps... But let&#39;s see as the inhabitants are brought into my utopia, through my...</i>HIVE MIND!<br><br>Suddenly, the wires that bound the Sub Rosa and the Marquis thrust into their brains, rendering their bodies limp.<br><br><i>Now, I have enough power to beat you even at your level... Prepare to-<br><br>Epic Teleport!</i><br><br>The SO disappeared.<br><br>=====<br><br>Psycho!Thundera had finally managed to kill the Tiger Lily, after a huge battle in which the reinforcements she was bringing, 600 Sues and 1,600 fangirls, were decimated by one-third. Now, she faced Captain Dandy, her sword glittering as the sap of the recently desceased Flower turned into Sue Blood.<br><br>&quot;You loved her, didn&#39;t you? You loved her and didn&#39;t know it until her unfortunate demise. Well, that only makes it more pleasurable!&quot;<br><br><i>You second Ontic... PREPARE TO DIE!</i> The Paladin lifted up his katana and said: <i>100% Smite Evil!</i><br><br>Psycho!Thundera laughed at him, and dodged. The katana cleft into the ground, opening a huge rift. The depraved Sue then smirked, and said: &quot;That is not how you do holy powers, Weed!&quot;<br><br>Angel wings then burst from her back, accentuating her leather jacket and pants nicely. She then lifted up her sword and a beam of holy light then came down from the sky and consumed the Captain whole. When it abated, the Flower was still alive, though horribly singed and clearly in pain.<br><br>He tried healing himself, but he was engulfed by a storm of Urple flames that Psycho!Thundera had summoned from her sword. Now almost dead, he got up one last time and said: <i>Die!</i> as he made one last thrust.<br><br>Psycho!Thundera dodged. &quot;Tsk...Tsk...Pathetic&quot;.<br><br>She then slit her wrist with her sword, and glittery blood dripped down to the Tiger Lily&#39;s corpse. As the Captain watched, the person he cherished most came back to life...as a Sue.<br><br><i>Hello, Captain. Why don&#39;t you and I &#39;pollinate&#39; to Avril Lavinge? Not that you have a choice...</i><br><br>Then the now-suefied Tiger Lily removed his sword, armour, and clothes.<br><br><i>No! Please-</i><br><br>What came later was...graphic.<br><br>Psycho!Thundera laughed loudly, and summoned her motorbike, Volxemort (not to be confused with Voldemort).<br><br>She then sped to where the remaining Weeds were evacuating Legal&#39;s remaining personnel.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re not getting away that easily, boys and girls...&quot;<br><br>The sounds of the slaughter and subjugation lasted for several hours. <br><br>=====<br><br><i>This cannot be happening... This cannot be happening...</i><br><br>The Sunflower Ofcicial kept saying that to himself as he ran through the halls of HQ, burning up several high-level spells in just the first thirty minutes. While he had killed most of HQ&#39;s assailants, any Agents he came into contact with were suddenly brainwashed by Hornbeam, who gave them a large enough percentage of his power to hold their own against him. He was also distraught, almost broken in fact, by the betrayal of his fellow Firstborn and close friend.<br><br><i>No...just...No. Please...let this all be a cruel trick...</i><br><br>He kept running and running, hoping that Luxury, who wasn&#39;t evil at heart, or Maeluwien, a Parody!Sue were still alive and would give him shelter, as he was that desperate. Unfortuanately, the NMG got to them first, killing them and stuffing them into fridges along with several males.<br><br>He then sat down on the hard floor of HQ, and began to cry.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t do that, husband...&quot;<br><br>The Sunflower shuddered. There was only one being who had ever dared to call him that: Jayacacia Thornbyrd.<br><br>She wore a bikini made out of Silk engraved with Tengwar on the top half, and Cirith on the bottom. They both read: X with me and some other stuff. She wore a crown made of Rubies, Orange Topaz, Yellow Tourmaline, Green Emeralds, Blue Sapphires, Indigo Tourmaline, and Violet Amethyst.<br><br>She looked like a blazing rainbow (there were diamonds in her crown as well) and she also had a Jade comb in her very long hair which-(AN: My computer does not have enough memory for the rest of my description. Sorry!)<br><br>The Sunflower Official, his brain tired out, said: <i>100% Disjunction!</i>, and a beam of light came out of his finger and destroyed Jayacacia&#39;s clothes, crown, and comb. Despite the fact that as a construct, Jayacacia should have been destroyed as well, her body stayed intact.<br><br>The Sunflower had no will left to resist her buxom charms, and ripped off his clothes and thrust his hardness, which had come out of nowhere, into her.<br><br>And so the end of the PPC drew even closer.<br><br><b>Author&#39;s Note: I didn&#39;t get the five good reviews I asked for, but I still want them!</b><br><br>[[OOC: *Drinks Bleeperin*]]<br></p>

Seconds later, an army of Ypurs commanded by the Hornbeam&#39;s hive mind came through a dozen portals. At the same time, advance elements of the NMG&#39;s armies began to arrive, setting up fortifications around one of the cliffs.<br><br>They had tried to form a defensive cordon for a while, but the enemy forces proved too strong, particularly when they were joined by several battalions of Tesla and Apocalypse tanks (from Red Alert 2). Now, the desperate Agent fought beside his wife, Takdeeta in order to save what he can of the CPI&#39;s hope. <br><br>A signal had already been sent out to the PPC TARDISes to return here instead of HQ. At the same time, OFUer&#39;s began to arrive in the town, telling lurid tales of what had happened to their schools. Those who were fit enough to fight and wanted to were sent to the front, being given what weapons were available at the time, including Molotov Cocktails.<br><br>However, even their desperate attacks proved futile, and Tawaki and Takdeeta kissed each other in preperation for the end.<br><br>Then, the last true hope arrived.<br><br>The Mirror Multiverse Black Cats portaled in from their secret base, bringing several Daleks.

We heard about the fall of your HQ from our buggers at the Sunflower Emperor-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your Sunflower Emperor knows about this?!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, he does. The NMG made contact with him several months ago, and they staged a surprise attack on our headquarters.<br>Then, they began watching for any attempt to cross the barrier between Multiverses. They only pulled out their sensor web when they began the assault on your HQ. Sorry.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Its not your fault. What&#39;s the status of HQ?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Large parts of it are controlled by your Hornbeam and his Hive Mind. He appears to be independent from the NMG or the EPC, and is in fact actively figthing them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We sort of guessed that when the Ypurs attacked the NMG troops instead of helping them.

I can belive that the libations to the Ironic Overpower were just a gambit to weaken us, that the SO and the other Flowers had the prescence of mind to get levels in D&amp;D classes, and that Psycho!Thundera looks badass! But <i>Agent Tawaki</i> becoming an Inquisitor who tortures people in ways that would give Medival Tortuers nightmares? That is where my Willing Suspension of Disbelief ends!&quot;<br><br>&quot;But it&#39;s live!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t care! We skip over the Tawaki torturing and killing people part, okay?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fine.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, and while you&#39;re at it, why don&#39;t you tell me who you are, so I could stop doubting.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Very Well.&quot; The Stranger then took off his hat and scarf, revealing the face of an Asian man in his prime.<br><br>It was the face of Makes-Things.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re alive! Wait a minute, aren&#39;t you supposed to be working on the Hornbeam&#39;s Instrumentality thing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, yes I was. I also had a secret mission from the Queen Anne&#39;s Lace, which I wasn&#39;t able to do anymore once he and the Gladiolus were retconned out of the conspiracy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I see. What was the mission, exactly?&quot; <br><br>&quot;To create an ark that would withstand the fractures in reality caused by the Time of Judgement. You see, back on Origin, there was a prophecy that predicted the End of the Multiverse as we know it.&quot; <br><br>&quot;And you think the Time of Judgement is this?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes. After all, HQ has fallen...&quot;<br><br>Agent Lyta bowed her head.<br><br>&quot;So, is this room part of the ark, then?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes. There&#39;s also a replicator, some toilets, and am ornamental garden. That was all I could accomplish before the Fall.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ahh. Is there any way to get out?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No. I&#39;d invent one, but only after the time of Judgement has passed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I see. Wait-does that mean that we&#39;re going to have to repopulate the Multiverse, then?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Do you want to?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course not!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then don&#39;t worry. There should be at least some sane people left after the end. If we can rescue them before they die, we may have enough of a starting population.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good. Now, has Inquisitor Tawaki finshed torturing innocent OFUer&#39;s?&quot;<br><br>&quot;By my calculations, yes.&quot;<br><br>They pressed the remote again.<br><br><b>Author&#39;s Note: Thank you JayBird!</b> </p>

Normally, she would have rejected it as a dangerous superstition, albeit one that had spread through the Canon Protection Initiative like wildfire. Wildfire caused by political flames from the 08&#39; elections, no less. However, not only had it come from her friend, Miss Brin, but it also appeared to work. There was a large Vambiolaria outbreak at that time, but after a few days of offerings, large amounts of the cure were found and sucssesfully disturbed to the populace. <br><br>So several members of her staff tried it, and large numbers of the student body joined too. Eventually, she found herself doing the ritual several times a day. She threw her head back, letting her long hair flow out.<br><br>She looked at the Garden and saw the Canons and the students cooperating to pour more libations to appease the Ironic Overpower. They were singing in Queyna while doing so, the students having taken pleasure in learning the language. Many who have finished the ritual were laughing while they ate fruit from the orchards of southern Gondor and the Shire. They looked really happy, especially the ones pouring the libations. Miss Cam was debating on whether to join them, when the Canons and Students took off their clothes and began an orgy.<br><br>Man and Woman, Man and Man, Woman on Woman, Girl on Boy, Boy on Boy, Girl on Girl, and Man on Boy, Woman on Boy, Man on Girl and Woman on...oh, you get the drift! They were doing it like they were in My Immortal, as well. As Miss Cam decided to charge towards them in order to stop the depravity, Thundera Tiger appeared before her, her eyes filled with glitter and holding a sueish looking sword. Miss Cam put two and two together.<br><br>&quot;I see. It&#39;s ovious now. The Libations were just a gambit by what centralized authority the Sues have put together in order to undermine us. And it worked.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hahahahaha! The Sues? This plan encompasses more than them alone. This is a wide-ranging conspiracy that encompasses all badfic, as well as people who, though not Sues themselves-some of them are actually Goofic writers who just want power that only Canon Defilement can give-, have joined together to take down the CPI and replace it with a regime that will rule over the Multiverse with an Admantium fist.&quot;<br><br>Thundera Tiger then waved her sword and several pink wires sprang out of it and tied up Miss Cam.<br><br>&quot;Snap out of it! You&#39;re not a Sue, Thundera!&quot;<br><br>&quot;But I am now. And no, there is no way you can snap me out, not at this point in the story!&quot; <br><br>&quot;Now look at the garden, and see the fall of OFUM!&quot;<br><br>Miss Cam did as was told, and saw a slight shimmer in the air above the orgy. As she looked, the shimmer grew in size, becoming more ovious by the second. Then, a tear in space emerged at the center of the shimmer, which resembled deciptions of the Eye of Terror that Students versed in Warhammer 40k lore had shown her.<br><br>Then, Various Daemons (full-size, no less!) charged out of the rip and began tearing apart, infecting, mutating, and violating the orgy&#39;s participants. Not in that order, either. Miss Cam was almost driven insane at the sight. Then, the Daemons finshed with their prey and looked at her.<br><br>She tried to crawl away, but her traitorous former friend stepped on Miss Cam&#39;s neck, restraining her. She laughed. <br><br>&quot;Hahahahaha! Do you think i&#39;ll just let you escape!? No, you&#39;re going to suffer what your staff and students did, and more!&quot; As she spoke, a daemoinaclly possesed Gimli (who was wearing a coat made from Lina&#39;s skin) walked towards her and begin to feel her up.<br><br>&quot;Farewell, Miss Cam!&quot; Thundera teleported out just as waves of pleasure and pain coursed through Miss Cam&#39;s body.<br><br><b>Author&#39;s Note: First Chapter finished!

But hopefully, that won&#39;t pose an obstacle to her overtures of friendship.

            <p>Genre: Romance, Rating: R, Summary: Lori Starrett vowed to never love another. But what happens when she meets Eledhwen Elerossiel? R&amp;R please. No flames.<br><br><b>Discovering Love</b><br><i>Chapter One: The Meeting</i><br>Lori Starrett sang a happy tune as she melodically drifted down the corridors of HQ in a long forest green dress. Her sparkling auburn hair drifted in the wind and her voice was like the trilling of a thousand nightingales. Her skin was as pale as porcelain and her eyes as green as the leafy halls of Mirkwood, home of her former lover, Legolas Thranduillion.<br>She sighed as she remembered her former love, who had left her to go to the Grey Havens. In her sadness, a single, pearly tear slipped down her porcelain cheek . “Oh Legolas,” she sighed wistfully. “I will never love another ever again.” <br>(Author’s Note: Just pretend she never met Bill Fallis.)<br>Lori had been recruited by the PPC for her skills as a healer but instead of working at Medical she preferred to spend her days in the everwhite labs of the Department of Mary Sue Experiments and Research. There she was an excellent scientist, discovering many things about Mary Sues and adding to the PPC’s knowledge about them. She would have been the new Lab Director or even Department Head, but she modestly turned down the offer. <br>But now as she walked the halls, she suddenly collided with someone.<br>“Ouch!” an equally melodius tone exclaimed.<br>“Who are you?” Lori queried.<br>“Eledhwen Elerossiel,” the elleth replied. She had dark hair as mysterious as midnight and grey eyes like those of Legolas. “Who are you?”<br>“Lori Starrett.”<br>Eledhwen smiled. “The best scientist in HQ?”<br>“I don’t know.”<br>“You are. That’s what everyone says. And I think I’ve had quite a crush on you ever since you were recruited.”<br>The tears welled up. “But I cannot love another! My heart has been given to Legolas of Mirkwood, and he hath forsaken me. I shall spend the rest of my life grieving for my lost love.”<br>Eledhwen looked at her sadly. “My lady, my heart doth grieve for you.” She reached out and took Lori’s hand. “But I have loved you, too. Try. Try to love someone else.”<br>Lori bowed her head, saying nothing but feeling much.<br>Author’s Note: Please read and review! I hope I have Lori and Eledhwen in character!<br></p>

You are the lady of my dreams, the fairest mortal I have ever seen…”<br>“Eledhwen!” came a screeching voice. It was Christianne Shieh, Eledhwen’s evil partner! “I thought you loved me!”<br>Eledhwen turned to face her partner. “I loved Lori more,” she replied simply.<br>“How dare you! You’ve broken my heart!” Christianne howled. “I’ll get back at you for this, I promise youuuuu!” And with that the spiteful Christianne stalked away.<br>Lori looked at Eledhwen with sparkling eyes. “You really do love me!” she cried joyously. “Oh, why have I lurked in sadness for so long? I love you too, Eledhwen!”<br>Eledhwen smiled and leaned in and kissed Lori on the lips.<br>To Be Continued…<br><b>Author’s Note:</b> Please read and review! I hope I have them in character!<br></p>

            <p>Hi it&#39;s me again and as you can see I learned a few thigns like putting better spelling into things and some of my friends got me into slash a little while back so I thought i&#39;d write something about a couple of hot Agents.<br><br>Summary: Kelvin is lonely because he wants to find his one True love but he has to hide his real preferrences but could one person from StarWars change all that?<br><br>Category: PPC<br><br>Rated: 15 maybe M for later chappies<br><br>Chapter one<br><br>One day in Hq there was this really hott Elf called Kelvin and he was really cute and everything because Elves always are with long black hair that was always soft and smooth and deep grey eyes with the light of the stars in them like elves have. He had lots of problems because he was so cute and all the girls in Hq wanted to get together with him andn be his one True love bcause elves are only supposed to marry once ever. But Kelvin could never find this true Love amongst the girls and this made him sad because he was so lonely but it wasn&#39;t his fault because he secretly liekd men but he couldn&#39;t ever say that because it would make the girls ssad and he was too nice to make them sad.<br><br>He was walkign down the corridor whent he nearly walked into somebody comeing the other way but he didn&#39;t of course because elves are too graceful to walk into somebody. “Oh I;m sorry,” he said, “I didn’t see you there”. “Are you all right”?<br><br>“Yes I;m fine thankyou”, said the other person and Kelvin looked at him for the first time properly. The person was not human because he had pink skin and purple hair and vivid purple eyes but he looked very handsome anyway.<br><br>“Hello who are you”? “I haven’t seen you around before” the Elf commented.<br><br>“My name is Cavan and I’m a Zeltron from Star Wars” was the reply. “Who are you”?<br><br>“My name is Kelvin Talathion and I used to be a minor Stu but I was saved by the PPc”.<br><br>Kelvin could feel an attraction to Cavan imediately because he was so handsome and he moved closer and looked around to make sure none fo the girls who followed him around were nearby because he didn’t want them to see how attracted he was to Cavn. And Cavan smiled at him and put one arm around his waist and said “Would you like to come back to my place”? becaus he was attracted to Kelvin as well. The Elf looked at him and he was a bit worried in case they were seen but Cavan just shrugged and said “Im a Zeltron and we make friends with everybody so dont’ worry about it”.<br><br>So Kelvin said “Okay” and he went back to Cavan’s rC with him and they went in and closed the door and began to kiss because they both felt so attracted to each other and kelvin knew he’d found his one true love but they were interrupted when the door crashed open.<br><br>Standing there in the doorway was Cavans partner Rilwen and she hated him because she knew he was really gay and she thought that was wrong because she didn&#39;t think men should be in love with each other but women were all right because it was prettier that way and she was in love with Kelvins partner Lyra.<br><br>“HOW DARE YOU DO THIS IN OUR RC”‼‼‼! She shouted at Cavan and drew her lightsaber to kill them both.<br><br>[[And ohgod this one&#39;s painful. I apologise to everyone who may get LxC flashbacks from my punctuation.

            <p>Hehehe I left you all on a cliffie last time!<br><br>Thanks for the nice reviews XxLuminescent-TearsxX and MystikalLuvrrRr because at least its nice to know that some people lke my work unlike some people like that honest critic person who doesn’t know what theyre talking about.<br><br>A/n; I decided that even though Kelvins from lOTr hed know about Star Wars because of working in the PpC so that’s why he knows about Sith and Jedi just in case anybody wonders why.<br><br>Rilwen lunged at Kelvin to kill him because she thought it was all his fault that Cavan was being gay and she didn;t care that he was Kelvins true Love. But Cavan was a Sith like Rilwen and he jumped in front of Kelvin to save him and drew his own lightsaber and he began fighting with Rilwen to make her stop trying to kill them and eventually he beat her and her lightsaber stopped working and Cavan was gong to kill her but he didn;t because Kelvin was there and Kelvins goodness made Cavan feel ashamed of being evil because that’s what Sith are so he put his lightsaber down and told Rilwen “Go away”. “I will let you live but you must never try to harm Kelvin again”. “He is a good person and I love him and you must accept that because you are homosexual yourself”.<br><br>And Rilwen didnt answer but she knew he was right and she ran away crying to find her lover and left them alone. Kelvin sighed in relief and turned to Cavan and gave him a pasionate embrace and whispered “Thank you for saving me”.<br><br>Cavan looked up at him sadly and replied “Your goodness is what made me do it because Im not a good person myself”. “Im a Sith and we are evil but youre so good that I cant be with you because youre too good to love somebody evil”.<br><br>Kelvin was heartbroken bcause he knew Cavan was his one True Love and he didnt want to lose him but he knew Cavan was right so he thought for a while and then he said “I dont want to lose you Cavan but if youre evil then we cant be together but thre is a way for us to be together”. “You can turn to the Light Side of the Force and be a Jedi like Luke Skywalker because he was able to love even though he was a Jedi”.<br><br>And Cavan smiled and said “Yes Ill do that for you and then we can always be together” and he stopped being Sith and came to the Light Side and was a Jedi and then Kelvin was happy because he could finally be together with his True love and they made love together and they were both happy.<br><br>And all the girls who wanted to be with kelvin were sad at first because they knew he could never get with them now but they were happy because he was happy and Kelvin and Cavan were so hot together. And in the end they went up to the Flowers and got transferred so that Kelvin and Cavan were partners and could be together and because they were good they made sure that Rilwen and Lyra were together as well so that they could love each other even though theyd been so mean to them.<br><br>The End‼!11!1‼!<br><br>Please R/r!</p>

            <p>A/N: So here she is again -- JAYCACIA THORNBYRD!!! She&#39;s back at last in an ALL NEW AVDENTURE!!! Hope you ENJOY and please READ AND REVIEW!!!<br><br>Chapter 1 -- Break<br><br>Jaycacia Thornbyrd stood in the Committee Room and breathed deeply. &quot;All right,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m ready.&quot;<br><br><i>Do you truly understand what is asked of you?</i> a mental voice said out of the darkness.<br><br>&quot;I do,&quot; Jaycacia replied. &quot;The survival of the entire PPC rests on my actions here and now - on my sacrifice.&quot;<br><br><i>There will be no going back,</i> another voice told her. <i>Once you do this, you will never be able to return to who you were.</i><br><br>&quot;I know,&quot; Jaycacia affirmed. &quot;But if I stop now, what life I have will be one of misery and suffering under a cruel master.&quot;<br><br><i>It will be incredibly painful,</i> a third voice said gently, <i>both during and after the transformation.</i><br><br>Jaycacia smiled grimly. &quot;Death is more painful,&quot; she said. &quot;Death is forever.&quot;<br><br><i>Then so be it,</i> a fourth voice said, one she knew very well. <i>Beloved, your sacrifice will be remembered.</i><br><br>&quot;I know, husband mine,&quot; Jaycacia told the Sunflower Official. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br><br><i>Let us begin,</i> a fifth voice said with grim finality. <i>Please enter the circle...</i><br><br>*-*   *-*   *-*   *-*   *-*   *-*   *-*   *-*   *-*   *-*   *-*   *-*   *-*   *-*   *-*   <br><br><b>One Day Earlier...</b><br><br>Jaycacia laughed as she hugged the SO around his stem. &quot;Oh, my husband,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;you are the <i>greatest!</i>&quot;<br><br><i>It&#39;s not much,</i> the SO replied demurely. <i>It&#39;s only your due as the greatest Assassin in the history of the PPC.</i><br><br>&quot;Oh, now there must be more to it than that,&quot; Jaycacia retorted. &quot;I&#39;ve been the greatest for years. Why now?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Haven&#39;t you checked the date?&quot; her mother, Jay, asked. Jaycacia frowned.<br><br>&quot;Well, it must be... oh!&quot; She blushed. &quot;It&#39;s the first of Jaycaciamonth!&quot; (A/N: I figured time is a mess in HQ, so they can&#39;t use normal months, right? So they named the months after their favourite people, like Jaycacia, Jay, the SO, Makes-Things, and I guess some others. Innit cool? *-*)<br><br><i>That it is,</i> the SO confirmed. <i>And as you know, Jaycaciamonth starts on the day you finally defeated the evil Acacia Byrd -</i> he paused to spit on the ground <i>- for good.</i><br><br>&quot;So we thought you deserved a reward,&quot; Jay told her, grinning.<br><br>Jaycacia smiled wider. &quot;My own statue...&quot; she breathed.<br><br><i>To be unveiled in one week,</i> the SO informed her. <i>And that&#39;s not all. You also get a holiday.</i><br><br>&quot;But I thought we <i>never</i> got holidays!&quot; Jaycacia exclaimed. Jay grinned.<br><br>&quot;Normal Agents don&#39;t. But we&#39;re assistants to the SO, my darling - he can make all the exceptions he wants.&quot;<br><br><i>And I think a week off will do us all good,</i> the SO said. <i>I&#39;ve already set up a portal to a little place I know.

            <p>That hacker ruined the whole chapter this time and we only got to see a tiny bit so maybe you should get in contact with the Fanficland mods and see whats going on because its really getting unfair.<br><br>But now Im getting worried about whats going to happen to Jyaycacia because you said someones going to die! I hope its not Jaycacia or the SO because theyre just too in love to be broken apart but even if it was Jay Id be sad because she deserves some happiness after living with Acacia.</p>

            <p>Except for your author&#39;s notes and chapter title. If you are capable of using proper spelling and punctuation throughout your story, you should be able to use it all the time.

            <p>I need to think of some accurate manner in which to describe my assessment of this work.<br><br>Mystika, if I may call you that, you have created some manner of literary abortion. And not the clean kind. Yours is a bloodied coathanger hanging from the twat of the very art form. I believe my eyes have been sullied.<br><br>I will disregard your flagrant disregard for the rules of spelling, grammar and consistency for the same reason many disregarded Hitler&#39;s parking tickets. They are innumerable and disinteresting in comparison to your other, more blatant flaws.<br><br>First is the main character of your fic. Mystik? A bland charicature of a character, who I can only assume you based on yourself. Kreep and his bear seem to exist only as foils for her disgusting tomfoolery. The villain or target, while they have yet to be properly introduced, is thus far a half-mentioned background figure who the characters react to with horror in a manner grossly disproportionate to the threat the enemy represents.<br>Also, Faddik is a stupid name.<br>So, in conclusion, please go kill yourself.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Kingflamer</p>

            <p>Let me put it this way, MystikaLuvrrRr (and what kind of name is that?), you should never have picked up the keyboard. Learn to use spell-check, see what passes for GOOD fiction, and then maybe you can publish your work. Until then I&#39;ll thank you not to inflict your imbecilic writing on us. </p>

            <p>A/N: Yes, I Know I have been long Away. Still, here is more of my Story. Again, no Flames!<br><br>/\/\/\/\/\/\/&lt;br&gt;<br>She had waited so Long. And then, she saw Him amid the blaekness of the Corridors.<br>he was so Handsome. This was her First thought, that his Radiance might better suit a god.<br>So tall and Pale with hair of the same Raven Hue as her own, and deep mysterios Eyes of Midnight black. Could he be like Her, she wondered?<br>&quot;my Lady,&quot; his Voice was so deep and smooth. &quot;I saw you there and saw the Sadness in your eyes and wonderd if I could lift it away from you. you are so Beautful, and the beautiful should never know such sorrow.&quot;<br>&quot;My Lyfe has been sorrow, kind stranger.&quot; She looked at him with hope arisng. &quot;But Maybe you could help me. What is your name.&quot;<br>&quot;Gezeraxion Frostheart, Lord of the Shadows. all the world to me is Blood upon snow until I saw you. You melt the Frost in my heart fair lady. Tell me your name, I beg you.&quot;<br>&quot;I am Ellerianniel Darkrose, Raven Lady of Sorrow. Or I was, but my Sorrow vanishes around you.&quot;<br>He kissed her, his arms aruond her, his Skin as smooth and Cold as her own. Yet they felt Heat, for it was only Mortals who Truly felt them as Cold, to each other they were perfect.<br>He swept her up and carried her to his RC, all painted in black with Blooodred bats painted within. And then they spent all Night together proving that they truly knew Love and that they need not fear Death at each other&#39;s Ivory Fangs. (A/N: Gezeraxion and Ellerianniel are too Noble to write Smut of this Scene. I aologise to any Readers who were expecting it.)<br>it took Days for any to seek them, before one who was Jealous that Gezeraxion had taken the Love of one so beautiful told the flowers, nd the Vampyres were told they must not see each other again in case they left the PPC to live in their Destiny elsewere.<br>Ellerianniel Wept, her Tears of Blood like Ruby crystals, and Gezeraxion plaeded that they not be parted, for they had gone so long without love. Then they said that if they were parted, they would walk into Sunlight, for Death was better than losing this Love.<br>The Flowers saw how true their love was and relented and they became partners, and for Eternity after, they were Great and famous Agents whose Love was a legend, and were never Lonely again.<br>And they did not Care that they never saw the Sun, because they were both so much Fairer than sunlight could ever be, so that alll admired them and the Pure strength of their everlatsing True Love.<br><br>The End.<br><br>/\/\/\/\/\/&lt;br&gt;A/N: And now it is Done and their story is told, and your Comments are Welcomed to greet the lovers in their story.</p>

            <p>That was the most convoluted piece of rubbish I have read YET on this terrible website. English is not a language which capitalises words other than proper nouns and those at the beginning of a sentence. Learn our language properly before you try to use it.</p>

I love writing fanfic, so please read and review!<br><br>((note to hS: I&#39;m going to mock the Suethor-In-Denial. Namely, the one that uses decent grammar but is still a badfic writer. And the fanfic before this is rated K, the genre is Romance, the category OFUs, and the summary is &quot;Lilith Wydenbrooke is the Cinderella of OFUM. This is her story, R&amp;R please. No flames.&quot; Sorry about neglecting to include the info; I was too excited about the Game being up.))</p>

            <p><b>Masquerade of OFUM</b><br>Lilith Wydenbrooke would not exactly be the pride of the students at OFUM, but she was for the teachers. She did her assignments accordingly, never tried to sneak into the staff section, yet could be just as evil as Elrond if provoked. <br>She was an elf, not for attracting Legolas, but because the thought of being wise and immortal appealed to her. <br>She had long hair as dark as midnight and eyes that were silver and mithril at the same time. <br>It was a pity that she rarely showed her face, for 99.999999999999% of her spare time she would be reading. Therefore, many of the students dubbed her ‘mini-Hermione’.<br>The Yuletide ball was approaching swiftly, and soon tongues began to wag about the ball, and most importantly, what they were going to wear. Lilith blissfully avoided the chatter and arguments over materials and accessories, and who was taking whom. Sadly for her, if the other girls weren’t busy devising plans to ask their lust objects out, or arguing and chatting, they were mercilessly teasing her. <br>“Poor Lilith,” sneered Rosalie Berthilide Evangeline Eglantine Pottermalfoy Sparrowturner Hawkesbury, who was the most Mary-Sueish girl in OFUM, “it’s such a shame that you read. You look as if you didn’t know there was a Yuletide ball.”<br>“Mini-Hermione’s only fit to go with a book!” crowed Rosalie’s friend Legatine Greenwood, wrinkling her dainty nose.<br>Lilith paid them no heed, though deep down she was miserable. <br>The staff seemed to decide that a three day trip to Minas Tirith would give the students enough time to get a dress and accessories, or to get one done by a seamstress. All the students thought it was a break from studies. They strolled around the city like one would do at a mall. <br>Legolas, the much fangirled and stampeded Prince of Mirkwood, chanced to also be shopping at the same time. Excited girls followed him everywhere, hoping for a date. Their eyes seemed to gleam with anticipation when they noticed him buying a diamond ring at a shop and they wondered who it was for. They also saw him buy a beautiful green dress with matching green dancing slippers and excitement grew to its height. Then he headed into a pub and sat down, weary. The barmaid bustled over, and countless giggling girls found themselves squeezing into nearby booths. <br>Lilith came in, with a book as usual, but she wasn’t reading it. She dropped into the seat facing Legolas and then started.<br>“Were you expecting someone?” she asked him, eyeing the bags of purchases. <br>“No, not at all,” replied Legolas, waving a dismissive hand. <br>Lilith nodded. She carried the signs that she had been crying.  <br>“Why do you weep?” asked Legolas after a while.<br>“Those other girls at the University. They tease me so,” Lilith didn’t know how it happened, but soon she found herself pouring out her heart to him. “They call me ‘mini-Hermione’, and I do know about the upcoming ball! Why do they think I do not? What is it of their concern why I read? Why can’t I be left alone? And then one of those empty-headed girls that lust you had to go and tell me that I ought to be dating a book.” She sniffled sadly.<br>Legolas was taken back. Lilith was always so calm, so collected, compared to this sad little creature, at least. Out of sympathy, he shyly patted her hand.<br>That night, Lilith went to bed with hope in her heart. <br>It was the night of the Yuletide Ball, and Nimloth, Lilith’s roommate, had gone to the room across from them to borrow a hairpiece. Lilith flopped down on her bed and stared up at the ceiling. She had decided the day before that she was not going to the Ball simply because she didn’t want to spend the evening in the company of giggling fangirls in pink. Also, she didn’t have a dress.<br>Nimloth came back in with the hairpiece and got herself dressed to the nines. Snickering something about “mini-Hermione would rather stay in and snog books, wouldn’t she”, the pesky fangirl left for the ball, evidently trying to catch Legolas’s eye. <br><br>Lilith sniggered at her roommate’s back. The staff had conveniently “forgotten” to tell the students that it was going to be a masquerade, so there wasn’t much of a chance to tell Legolas apart from the others.<br>“Lilith!” The girl’s head snapped around to see Legolas, dressed rather dashingly in blue, with his face concealed behind a mask. There was no mistaking his voice, though. “Are you not going to the ball?”<br>“No,” replied Lilith. “I don’t fancy spending my night surrounded by the likes of Rosalie Berthilide Evangeline Eglantine Pottermalfoy Sparrowturner Hawkesbury.”<br>Legolas grinned. “They wouldn’t recognize you if you have a mask on. We DID fail to tell them that it was to be a masked ball.”<br>Lilith sighed. “Maybe. But I don’t have anything to wear.”<br>“Done and done.” The Prince of Mirkwood disappeared, but not before some bags were sitting on the windowsill in his stead. <br>Lilith peeked into the bags and discovered the contents. Grinning to herself, she prepared to arrive at the Ball fashionably late.<br>“Nobody ever told us that the ball was MASKED!” screamed Rosalie Berthilide Evangeline Eglantine Pottermalfoy Sparrowturner Hawkesbury. <br>“Oh, how are we ever going to find Leggie in this mess?” gasped Legatine Greenwood. <br>Suddenly all heads turned and a sudden stillness fell over the room when Lilith made her entrance.<br>Her whole being gave off a pure, wholesome light. Behind the delicate apple-green mask with the embroidered flowers, mithril eyes sparkled with a previously unknown radiance.<br>Legolas saw her from the other side of the hall, and slowly walked towards her as if in a dream.<br>“May I have the pleasure of this dance?” he asked her quietly as he kissed her hand. Rosalie seethed. Lilith smiled.<br>“Certainly, dear masked Prince.”<br>The End!<br><b>Author&#39;s Notes:</b>Please review! It&#39;s my first story and no, Lilith is not a Mary Sue! :D</p>

            <p>You didn&#39;t get thirty reviews because you didn&#39;t deserve them. You didn&#39;t even deserve ONE. Your story was cliched, convoluted and OOC.

            <p>More accurately, I would like to make a note before people get really into it that I am <i>not</i> in the least bit comfortable with any of my Agents or character concepts being used in this. I know, it&#39;s arrogant to presume that anyone would want to, but I just wanted to make it clear just in case, sorry. Just so that people know I&#39;d really rather not only sit out of this, but not have my characters involved. Hope everyone else has fun, but I wanted to lay this down just to head off the chances of anything happening. Sorry.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m currently working on an original fantasy story, and I&#39;m kind of... I wouldn&#39;t say freaking out, but I&#39;m definitely worried about Mary Sues and stuff.<br><br>To give you the short version, my story takes place during a really rather vicious war between two factions of people, one side of which is conceited to the point of being genocidal. Most of my main protagonists are from the side that is fighting to not be massacred. This catastrophic war has been going on for about a decade.<br><br>I know that an angsty past like being orphaned, enslavement, imprisonment, yadda yadda yadda, is one of those little urple flags that go up when it comes to Sueishness. But if most of my protagonists are from a group of people who are seriously in danger of being wiped out, I&#39;d think readers would expect a little suckage in their pasts. What I mean is, does it really count against them, in terms of whether they&#39;re Mary Sues?</p>

            <p>...but I don&#39;t really mind characters with angsty backgrounds - depending on how they&#39;re handled. I think some of the main problems come from when the angsty past is being used to say either &#39;no-one has ever suffered like she has! Because she is just that Speshul!&#39;, or &#39;look at how much horrible stuff she&#39;s been through! You should all love her and feel sorry for her!&#39;. But I don&#39;t think that bad things in a character&#39;s past are automatically a sign of Sueishness.<br><br>If you&#39;re looking for some more detailed advice, you could try checking out limyaael&#39;s fantasy rants on Livejournal. She did a number of rants on angst (<a href="http://limyaael.livejournal.com/tag/rants+on+angst"><a href="http://limyaael.livejournal.com/tag/rants+on+angst">http://limyaael.livejournal.com/tag/rants+on+angst</a></a>), including one on how to handle abused characters.</p>

            <p>Back on the 3rd of April 2009 I meant to join the Board because of the fic Raider&#39;s Descent but real life intervened and I forgot to join and report it.

            <p>I panicked ... also &quot;subtly ordering people around&quot; ... okay looking at the definition of subtle on  <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/subtle"><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/subtle">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/subtle</a></a> I&#39;m never subtle. I either club things on the head or I leave it alone I would never subtly order anyone around as A) it be wrong and B) I&#39;m as subtle as a 6 mile asteroid if I say something it doesn&#39;t have hidden meaning ... But if I appear to be trying to order people around I apologise that&#39;s not my intention.<br>&quot;You&#39;re being bossy, rude, and quite unfriendly&quot;not my intention but then I can list the number of friends I Have on one hand.

Needless to say I either don&#39;t say anything or mess up royally when I do.<br>Footnotes.

I&#39;m trying to stop using them but sometimes it&#39;s too hard to not use them.<br>&quot;and not being especially apologetic for the huge spoiler you tossed onto the board for little reason.&quot;  I&#39;m sorry about that I truly am, when I originally apologised I was half asleep because my cat had decided that I should keep him company (I had to either let him in and have him walk on my face or lock him out and have him meow in his highly annoying whine which is impossible to sleep through). So my apology was probably not up to it so I truly am sorry about the spoilers it was an act of a complete stupidity. I will not do it again.<br>-Response to Comments on PPC goal(I would quote you but quite frankly I&#39;m too tired to as I type too slowly and have spent half an hour (possiply an hour) typing this so I&#39;m Sorry but I&#39;m not quoting)- Got it, I&#39;ll Kill my &quot;THIS NEEDS TO BE DEAD RIGHT NOW&quot; spirit right now ... thats ... sorry my accidental Oxymoron/Hypocritical statement hurt my brain.

            <p>Yes I know I&#39;m new but this is an emergency so I appoligise if I should introduce myself first. Theres this Stargate fic on <a href="http://www.tthfanfic.org/"><a href="http://www.tthfanfic.org/">http://www.tthfanfic.org/</a></a> called Extinction Event where a Commonwealth called the Akkadian Commonwealth has a fleet of 12,000 hat&#39;ak motherships but only has 27 planets and a population of 32 billion people to maintain this massive fleet ... which decides to wipe out all of the 6 billion people on earth due to the fact that The trust (Rogue organisation like section 31) killed three million one hundred and forty-six thousand people even though there is no way that this Commonwealth could know that it was the trust that attacked and that they from earth. Stargate command then instead of finding a way to defeat this fleet of ships that have no ancient technology yet can take on asgard ships so they decide to use diplomacy to stop this even though they have 4 months to come up with a solution. I have reviewed it (I&#39;m AbscondingCascade) and pointed out the problems but I fear as one negative reviewer against a authour swelled by 39 mostly positive reviews that even though I contacted one of the sites stargate experts (the Author hotpoint) that this horor will endure. I provide A link to show the horror that is the stargat fanfic Extinction Event <a href="http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-19533/Speakertocustomers+Extinction+Event.htm"><a href="http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-19533/Speakertocustomers+Extinction+Event.htm">http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-19533/Speakertocustomers+Extinction+Event.htm</a></a> .Please as Twisting the hellmouth is a buffy fanfiction site I fear that the majority of native site inhabitants who read it won&#39;t understand that the Akkadian comonwealth is a mary sue utopia of 32 billion mary sues with (at least) dozens of possesion sues inhabiting canon characters; Stargate canon cannot resist this foothold on the SGC. Please help.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know the Canon, but I&#39;m not sure if the story is really that bad. Not all of the 32 billion might be Mary Sues.

            <p>Okay, the fic isn&#39;t going to win any awards, but it doesn&#39;t suck, either. The premise of the conflict is well laid out, everyone seems to be in character, and I don&#39;t see what&#39;s wrong with using diplomacy to solve problems.<br><br>Furthermore, I looked over your review and the author&#39;s response. I didn&#39;t read them fully, because your use of footnotes (and footnotes within footnotes) is, frankly, annoying. However, based on what I did read, your concerns were well-answered, and the responses make enough sense for me.

            <p>sorry about the footnotes i&#39;ll try and cut back to one or two footnotes at most. <br><br>Secondly the problem is that a population of 32 billion or 82 billion (the author thinking of changing it) maintain a fleet of twelve thousand Hatak vessels when its commonwealth is spread across only 27 planets. Which is like 27 worlds in star wars maintaing 12000 star destroyers. it&#39;s impossible for dozens of reason especiallly consdering that the majoritiy of those people are going to be on a few of those planets which will be industrilised while the rest will be farm worlds for maintaing their common wealth.<br><br>I don&#39;t think in the entire history of the goa&#39;uld that there have been more than a 1000 ha&#39;taks due to the resource cost of building and maintaing one as the current standard ha&#39;tak is mothership is a 700 meter long, 650 meter wide, 315 meter deep vessel with 60 staff cannons  with a shield that can withstand an estimated at 1 gigaton of explosive force without it having any measurable decrease of the shield&#39;s power; The fact is, at least, that it consumes naquadah as fuel. We could expect the naquadah to be a refined version which may be as potent as weapon-grade naquadah and provide high power. Although much of this is open to speculation, it&#39;s more than likely that Goa&#39;uld reactors are fusion based.<br>To maintain such a fleet would be impossible for such a civilisation the only way to be able to do so would require a galactic spaning empire or for it to be a Mary sue Utopia.<br><br>And that with out considering that the goa&#39;uld are paranoid <br> about being found out as false gods aand are less stable than the average agent  they&#39;d destroy said civilisation in its infancy. Like how they treat Harcesis children and the Tok&#39;ra. the only way for this Ninmah to be able to stop the goa&#39;uld from stopping her would be mind control.<br><br>Also she has a change of heart about how she treats her subjects which only Egeria he founder of the tok&#39;ra movement (due to being a Goa&#39;uld Queen she literally spawned the movement) has ever done (the tok&#39;ra don&#39;t count due to the fact that goa&#39;uld genetic memories are controled by the queen who makes the Goa&#39;uld.<br><br>And there is the fact that Stargate command never give up hope they have been fighting against enemies far greater than them since they stepped through the stargate. Even when there is no hope and the light at the end of the tunnel is a flame thrower mounted on a train they always find a way to win and with 4 months prep time they&#39;d have found a way to stop this commonwealth. <br><br>And finaly they trust this commonwealth even after it was going to kill all life on earth. <br><br>I could go on but then I&#39;d get in trouble due to spending to much time on the net and quite frankly I&#39;ve babbled for long enough and I&#39;m probably getting self righteous and annoying (if I am I appoligise).<br><br>Note: info from <a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/"><a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/">http://stargate.wikia.com/</a></a>, also refrences to Tv tropes are made.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re comparing the productive capabilities of the Commonwealth with a society based on feudalism and slave labor. I&#39;m perfectly happy to believe that an advanced republic could churn out and maintain a lot more ships with a lot less effort than the Goa&#39;uld have to put into their 1000. Could the ancient Egyptians have built brick houses? Perhaps, but we do it better and in less time, and we have a whole hell of a lot more houses than the Egyptians ever did.<br><br>I still don&#39;t see how the SGC finding a diplomatic solution counts as giving up hope.<br><br>If one Goa&#39;uld Queen was able to have a change of heart, why not another? As the Tok&#39;ra point out, &quot;Not all Goa&#39;uld are the same.&quot;<br><br>As to how Ninmah&#39;s society was allowed to develop, if she was a strong enough System Lord to hold her own in battle, why not? I&#39;ll grant you that her being that powerful is a big stretch, but if you allow for that, the rest is feasible.<br><br>At the very most, you&#39;ve got some bad logic and one Mary-Sue. Faceless masses =/= Mary-Sues. It simply doesn&#39;t work that way. If there were to be a mission, all the agents would have to do is take out Ninmah, maybe taking advantage of their Host Day to catch her with her guard down, then neuralyze the SGC. After that, everything Ninmah-Sue created would either disappear or assimilate with the canon. Even if destroying a planet or two were in order, the job would be made much easier by simple assassination beforehand. Remove the Sue&#39;s grip on the Word World, and suddenly it starts to come apart at the seams, leaving the team open to blow stuff up at leisure without having to worry about the defenses, which will be in complete disarray. QED.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Note: I may exhibit paranoia and plan for the worst case scenario but I do so as to ensure that any potential agents that might be sent on a possible mission to this fic (if it is deemed necessary for a mission to happen) come back as safe as possible. As I like to say &quot;Curiosity killed the cat, Paranoia could have saved it&quot;.<br><br>&quot; Could the ancient Egyptians have built brick houses? Perhaps, but we do it better and in less time, and we have a whole hell of a lot more houses than the Egyptians ever did.&quot; Yes but we need bricks to do it and there aren&#39;t enough resources in 27 solar systems to build such a fleet. The only way I can see to build such a fleet would require the resources of hundreds maybe thousands of worlds. Using the Serrakin (<a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Serakin"><a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Serakin">http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Serakin</a></a>) as an example of an advanced industrialized democratic Stargate race with the capability to take on the Goa&#39;uld they never showed the capability to produce 444 ships (12,000 ships divided by 27 planets = 444.44) that were on the same level as a Ha&#39;tak class mother ship.<br><br>&quot;I still don&#39;t see how the SGC finding a diplomatic solution counts as giving up hope.&quot; Ah I seem to have phrased my previous post in an incoherent manner .... Well its that all their efforts seem to be in diplomacy not in trying to find a way to stop this super fleet; which is out of character for Stargate command.<br><br>&quot;If one Goa&#39;uld Queen was able to have a change of heart, why not another? As the Tok&#39;ra point out, &quot;Not all Goa&#39;uld are the same.&quot;&quot;<br>Egeria unfortunately appears to be the only exception to the rule that normal Goa&#39;uld (Tok&#39;ra don&#39;t count due to Egerias ability to manipulate their genetic memories) can realise that their megalomania is wrong. Even the mostly sane Goa&#39;uld Baal is an untrustworthy snake (pun/joke not intended).<br><br>&quot;As to how Ninmah&#39;s society was allowed to develop, if she was a strong enough System Lord to hold her own in battle, why not? I&#39;ll grant you that her being that powerful is a big stretch, but if you allow for that, the rest is feasible.&quot; the Goa&#39;uld are too paranoid to allow one of their own 800 years to build a civilisation capable of destabilizing their image as gods. They would have realistically found out due to minor goa&#39;uld(s) in Ninmah&#39;s ranks about her little experiment in its infancy.<br><br>&quot;At the very most, you&#39;ve got some bad logic and one Mary-Sue&quot; what we have here is an example of a Mary Sue Topia (<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySueTopia"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySueTopia">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySueTopia</a></a>) in my opinion. Which means at best we have to kill 32 billion brain dead bit characters and one Mary sue at worst we have to deal with 83 billion fanatically loyal Mary sues lead by a Mary sue Queen.<br><br>The Dakara superweapon is a quick way to ensure we don&#39;t have to go kill them all personally. Getting control of it may actually not be such a pain as we just have to portal in to the control room, trick the canon Jaffa into going some else for a bit (hologram of Baal or something), reprogram the local Stargate to dial all 27 planets in this commonwealth and then trigger the dakara superweapon then destroy the non canon system if canon doesn&#39;t remove them ... the plan is too easy ... we need a new plan that won&#39;t go horribly wrong half way through. <br><br>&quot;Then neuralyze the SGC&quot;. Ahhh ... it&#39;s not that simple. The Goa&#39;uld, the Tok&#39;ra, the Asgard, possibly the Jaffa, Vala and the social circles she moves in (The Lucian Alliance) <br>All know about Ninmah. <br><br>So ... how do we neuralyze basically the entire galaxy and the Asgard? How does a neuralyzer work? As if we can rig one into the Dakara superweapon then we&#39;d only have to worry about the Asgard and people not in a solar system with a stargate as if we used the Dakara superweapon but modified it to be a Nerualyzer we could neuralise most of the galaxy (hey we could neuralise the Canon jaffa in the Dakara system ordering them else where ... and thus the Dakara super weapon plan gets another nail in its coffin as with it the mission becomes too easy meaning that the plan will go wrong somewhere).</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know who coined the term Mary Sue Topia, but it wasn&#39;t us. We strive to take more of an Occam&#39;s Razor approach with a side of the KISS principle.

            <p>Just presenting a worst case scenario ... I admit that its highly unlikely that the 32 billion (it may be retconned to 83 billion) are going to be Mary Sues but I thought they qualified as bit characters but if they don&#39;t then it actually will be relatively simple to pull off this if it becomes a mission.<br>Though Baal, Lord Yu, Oshu the First Prime of Lord Yu, Camulus, Amaterasu and possibly Anubis knows about her so do we have to neuralise them? Or do we just have to Neuralise Stargate command as I&#39;m a fan of Lord Yu and with his senility is it safe to neuralise him? Oh ... is it possible to neuralise Anubis?<br><br>Also while I try and remember to apply Occam&#39;s razor I usually forget due to my imagination and paranoia. BTW thank you for telling me about the KISS principle which has now become one of my favourite acronyms (along with TARDIS and WRDD!(1))<br><br>P.S it seems my Tv Tropes obsession is having negative affects ...  <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySueTopia"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySueTopia">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySueTopia</a></a>. <br><br>P.P.S I&#39;ve heard that The PPC can recruit dead canon characters ... has Janet Fraiser(2) been recruited yet? As she is a brilliant doctor who would be a great addition to the medical team. <br><br>(1) We&#39;re doomed. DOOMED! (I don&#39;t remember where I heard it but I love It :) )<br><br>(2) WHY Did Speakertocustomers let her die! He&#39;s a fanfiction writer he could have not mentioned her or allowed her to live but no ... he puts this line in to the fic &quot;A short time later came the mission on which Dr Janet Fraiser was killed&quot;! Janet deserves more than ONE MEASLEY LINE if you going to kill her! She Deserves at least an entire Chapter if you going to KILL HER! … Sorry for shouting … I may have a small crush on the Fantastically Wonderful Doctor Janet Fraiser … *sighs*.<br><br>Note: Sorry about using footnotes but I couldn&#39;t find a way to work them into the text without making it awkward. </p>

            <p>To be a character, even a bit character, requires... well, characterization. They have to actually do something in the story. What&#39;s-his-name, the guy who shows SG-1 around when they first get to the Commonwealth, is a bit character (minor character at best) and could be assassinated or recruited. The guy who shows them how to use the TVs on the train is a bit character, and he does so little he&#39;d either disappear or assimilate with the canon as soon as the Sue&#39;s influence was removed.<br><br>The other System Lords don&#39;t actually play a role in the fic, either. They are never shown to interact with the Sue (unless I missed something). Therefore, when she&#39;s gone and the canon snaps back to normal, the worst that could happen is that they&#39;d be left with a nagging sense that they forgot something. Maybe her name. But, in the face of the realities of canon, they&#39;d soon forget all about it and be just fine without intervention from the PPC.<br><br>All this is based on traditional PPC conventions. In our canon, if you will, that&#39;s just the way things work.<br><br>Everything in fanfic and the PPC is strongly determined by the fact that we&#39;re dealing with a written work. No matter how much we treat the effects of badfic as real effects on a real world, at the heart of it, it&#39;s all just Words. If it doesn&#39;t occur in the Words, it isn&#39;t important.<br><br>As for recruiting dead canons, yes, it has happened, but only as something rare and unusual. The rule of thumb is, if you want to write about the canon characters, the thing to do is write a fanfic, not turn the PPC into one.<br><br>... I mean, okay, the PPC is sort of a cosmopolitan group fanfic. But the point is to protect the various canons and leave them undisturbed, not to drag their people in here just because one person feels like it. Generally speaking, if a canon character gets recruited, it&#39;s because they are NOT the real character, but an Alternate Universe version. They often take on new names so as to avoid confusion and are somewhat different from their canon counterparts.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who&#39;s going to stop now before she confuses herself.</p>

            <p>My navy Penguins have been cheered up no end as budget cuts due to my Penguin Air force accidently sinking their Carrier fleet due to a rather over entusiastic young Penguin who had only become sapient(1) 3 months before causing a rather large arial incidence meaning they&#39;ve only had 5 small lifeboats to operate from which annoyed them no end Now with The Cuauhtemoc they can deal with the sea monster problem ... by the way keep Apprentice Overkill away from planes as we revoked his flying privilages because ... of a ... incodent involving ... noodles ... and due to being 6 months old he doesn&#39;t really listen to authoritie figures so just keep him away from planes.<br><br>(1)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapience"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapience">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapience</a></a> (we give the Penguins Sapience 3 months after their birth we tried to give to them earlier but the test subjects became pascifist hippies which when running a supersoldier project is highly annoying</p>

            <p>Language:  English (change) <br><br>We might not be able to use Sun crushers due to the fact that there is a canon way to destroy stars(1) in the stargate universe meaning that we may have to get past a fleet of 12,000 (posibly 24,000) hat&#39;ak mother ships(2) one of their ha’taks is easily a match for two System Lord flagships while their squadron flagships(3)could take on an Asgard vessel on even terms. their foot-soldiers have weaponry far superior to staff weapons(4). Seeing how out matched we are in terms of tech I have come up with a plan A, a Plan B, a plan C and a plan D . <br><br>Plan A requires we capture the Temple at Dakara(5) so that we can use the Dakara superweapon(6) in conjunction with the stargate network(7), then we use the weapon in its basic mode to destroy all matter on the 27 planets and the surrounding space, then we&#39;ll hide away for a few months so as to not be killed for killing 32 billion Mary Sues(8), while we hide away(9) we&#39;ll steal Asgard Black hole tech(10) then when the hunt for us dies down a bit(11) we&#39;ll use said tech (while ensuring no canons are in those solar systems) to turn one or more of the stars in to a black hole (depending how close the systems are). there are flaws to the plan as Dakara is an important planet(5) controlled by Baal meaning we have to take the system with out killing the canons which will be hard and then we&#39;ll have to put them somewhere safe so that when we trigger the Dakara superweapon from the nicely shielded control room they won&#39;t all be erased from existence. <br><br>If that fails we will have to go to plan B) taking control of the Ascension machine(14)so that we can Ascend say 27 Agents and then have them destroy the solar systems, of course we don&#39;t know if the Ascended have been affected by the mary sues and may/may not try and stop us(15). <br><br>If that fails we go to Plan C) we tell the Ori(17) about the existence of the Akkadian Commonwealth and hope that they can destroy them. <br><br>If the Ori lose the war(18) then we will be forced to go to plan D) FULL SCALE WAFARE against the Akkadian Commonwealth as Canon will be so Warped that we&#39;ll have to use everything at our disposal. To do so we shall bring the Attero device(19) to the Milky way galaxy, if we can we&#39;ll turn off the stargate network (with the exception of the Akkadian Commonwealths stargates) and then turn the Attero device on (regardless of whether the stargate network can be turned off) with it set to destroy Goa&#39;uld Ha&#39;taks, we&#39;ll wake up the Wraith and give them intergalactic hyperdrives and tell them about the Akkadian Commonwealth while detonating ZPMs(20) next to Akkadian Commonwealth stars basically the gloves will come off and we&#39;ll do whatever is in are power to restore stargate canon. <br><br>Hopefully Either someone will come up with a better plan or we&#39;ll succeed at plan A As plan B, C and D are filled with too much risk (not to say that plan A isn&#39;t risky but it&#39;s less likely to go horribly wrong) <br><br>(1) <a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Vorash_sun"><a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Vorash_sun">http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Vorash_sun</a></a> <br><br>(2) there is no distinguishment between normal ha’taks, Ha&#39;taks enhanced with ancient weaponry and Anubis&#39; mothership which is very very bad as the vagueness means they can basically rip to pieces any ship we could &quot;borrow&quot; <br><br>(3) never mind the fact that no one has enough hat&#39;ak mother ships to have Squadrons! <br><br>(4) They appear to have guns but could be armed with other weapons <br><br>(5) <a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Dakara"><a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Dakara">http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Dakara</a></a> <br><br>(6) <a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Dakara_superweapon"><a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Dakara_superweapon">http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Dakara_superweapon</a></a> <br><br>(7)using a &#39;hack&#39; of the DHD&#39;s correlative update function we&#39;ll dial every Stargate in the Akkadian Commonwealth simultaneously <br><br>(8) Unfortunately due to the massive canon alteration on such a large scale I calculate a 99.7% chance that the canon characters and civilisations will still all adore the Akkadian Commonwealth meaning that they will see are attack as a crime against humanity. we won&#39;t be able to move freely until we destroy the Akkadian Commonwealth systems and thus reset canon. <br><br>(9) possibly at head quarters <br><br>(10) <a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Hala%27s_sun"><a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Hala%27s_sun">http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Hala%27s_sun</a></a> <br><br>(11) Due to Stargate Command decreased ability to plan, the mellowing of the Asgard(12) due to the  Akkadian Commonwealth <br><br>(12) they said they weren&#39;t ruthless enough which is insane as the Asgard destroyed their own home world to stop the replicators(13) <br><br>(13) <a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Othala_(planet"><a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Othala_(planet">http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Othala_(planet</a></a>) <br><br>(14) <a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Ascension_machine"><a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Ascension_machine">http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Ascension_machine</a></a> (due to the fact that Agents who can pull off Spiritual Ascension are going to be very rare) <br><br>(15) even if they haven&#39;t been affected they may still have us follow the rules(16) <br><br>(16) <a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Ascended#Rules"><a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Ascended#Rules">http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Ascended#Rules</a></a> <br><br>(17) <a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Ori"><a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Ori">http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Ori</a></a> <br><br>(18) (Warning contains swearing) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FUBAR"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FUBAR">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FUBAR</a></a> (Warning contains swearing) <br><br>(19) <a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Attero_device"><a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Attero_device">http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Attero_device</a></a> <br><br>(20) <a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/ZPM"><a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/ZPM">http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/ZPM</a></a></p>

            <p>but that would mean I would have to accept the Stargate:Atlantis finale as an actual episode which I just can&#39;t do.<br><br>I&#39;d have to accept that they wasted an entire episode in a paralel reality playing CSI, I&#39;d have to accept that was should have been an epic space battle like the end of season 7 but was instead a complete disapointmen, I&#39;d have to accept that the IOA got hit with an idiot ball and moved the chair to Area 51 instead of keeping it antartica, I&#39;d have to accept that Status Quo is as god when its clearly a Goa&#39;uld and that they could have killed ***** off and actually made it terrifying instead of going all comic book death on us.<br><br>No, I&#39;m going to wait for hotpoint to write his XSGCOM version of Atlantis on <a href="http://www.tthfanfic.org/"><a href="http://www.tthfanfic.org/">http://www.tthfanfic.org/</a></a> as it&#39;ll make me feel a hundred times better. But if you want to incorprate a Super hive in to the plan go for it just don&#39;t tell me where you found it.<br><br>BTW if we end up on Plan C we&#39;ll be risking damaging canon so lets hope we either get plan A or B to work or we come up with a better plan as Plan C is pure desperation incarnate and plan D is even worse.<br><br></p>

            <p>Sindarin isn&#39;t my forte, but &quot;Elros&quot; is translated variously as &quot;Elf of the Spray&quot; or &quot;Star-foam&quot; (<a href="http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/e/elros.html">Encyclopedia of Arda</a>). To me, it looks like the -ros suffix is &quot;foam&quot; or &quot;spray&quot; (probably the same word), rather than &quot;whisper&quot;.<br><br>Looking at the Quenya words (which is more my field), &quot;spray&quot; is rosse, while &quot;whisper&quot; is &quot;lussa&quot; or &quot;lusse&quot;. I can see that becoming &quot;rus&quot; in Sindarin, but I&#39;m not certain whether any vowel shifts occured...<br><br>hS, who still doesn&#39;t know Sindarin</p>

            <p>Can&#39;t really comment too much on the second one, not having read the book it&#39;s based on. It looks pretty bad, though, in terms of Sueishness (of <i>course</i> they have magical mind-reading powers...and mysterious visions...*bangs head against wall a few times*)  And it looks to have serious timeline issues with regards to their ages.

            <p>If anything, it was my own decision to write late at night that made that mission my first flop. I&#39;ll send the new one your way. Just look for typos, inconsistent characterization, places where it could be funnier, stuff like that.</p>

            <p>Hey peeps!<br>I&#39;m looking for a beta reader for my new Transformers fan-fic. It is a G1 universe piece featuring Megatron/Starscream. It is only one chapter long so it shouldn&#39;t be a long task (hopefully).<br><br>Has anyone got enough knowledge of this canon (and fanon) to beta for me?<br><br>I&#39;ve not been writing any fanfic  for almost three years for various reasons and I&#39;m really glad that my muse has returned with a vengance!</p>

            <p>at first, anyway. On closer thoughts, while it is written well, I can&#39;t see Ginny ever serving Voldemort, however reluctantly. She&#39;d help with the resistance.

            <p>I&#39;m betaing a fic for Cassie, and Elladan&#39;s name in the original fic has just appeared as <i>Eln, bn</i>. A mini perhaps, but it&#39;s a hell of a typo. In one of mine and Trojie&#39;s missions a while back (Ethul&#39;waew, or something) there were a lot of similar typos. The author of that badfic actually came across our missions, and commented that the crazily mis-spelled names, and other words too, were a result of aff.net spazzing out. I&#39;ll believe her, as I&#39;ve seen similar mangled words in many aff.net fics. <br><br>So, my question: would this mangling, as it&#39;s the fault of the website rather than the author, create minis? Only it doesn&#39;t seem quite in the spirit of things to my mind. Thoughts?</p>

            <p>...but I don&#39;t think they can be let off the hook entirely. FF.N has a system that will remove scene breaks if you don&#39;t go back through the uploaded document and check it, which doesn&#39;t take very long. I would consider not taking the time to check that as being along the same lines as not bothering to run a spell check, if not exactly the same. <br><br>If it&#39;s not something they can fix by taking a little extra time... probably not.

            <p>&quot;Brought to us courtesy of GreyLadyBast, Pink Stuff is a brightly colored alcohol that is almost lethally potent and leaves killer hangovers. Drunkenness ensues almost immediately after consumption, and the Stuff is available to almost anybody. Warning: Should you choose to drink Pink Stuff, you will be in severe pain for several hours until it wears off, unless you can manage to get a hold of:<br><br>Purple Stuff: The only thing in existence that will alleviate the hangover from Pink Stuff. Purple Stuff kicks in almost immediately, and it is generally recommended that you have your Purple Stuff on hand before you drink Pink Stuff. Unlike Pink Stuff, however, Purple Stuff is only available for PPC and OFUM (and other OFUs) staff members, or from GreyLadyBast personally. However, while Bast gives out Pink Stuff freely, she is a bit stingier with Purple Stuff. Especially if you’re a fangirl.&quot;<br><br>For a complete list of supposedly edible/drinkable substances: <a href="http://oddlots.digitalspace.net/PPC/PPC_menu.html"><a href="http://oddlots.digitalspace.net/PPC/PPC_menu.html">http://oddlots.digitalspace.net/PPC/PPC_menu.html</a></a><br><br>My problem is actually continuing where my partner left off. I keep being jarred by how my style is different from his so I can&#39;t make the transition between the chapters he covered and the chapters I will cover. Though I suppose that&#39;s just a matter of practice makes perfect.<br><br>--Mystia <br></p>

            <p>...I&#39;ve been wondering about the minis for a few fandoms.  Namely Rurouni Kenshin, Ghost in the Shell, and Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni <s>shut up I found a Hanyuu mini and I want it</s>.  For Ghost in the Shell, I was thinking mini-T08A2, as in the giant spider-tank-thing from the end of the first movie, but for the other two, I dunno.  All the &quot;monsters&quot; from Rurouni Kenshin are human, and Higurashi, well, really doesn&#39;t like to keep the threats visible.  And as much fun as mini-Bursts Of Insanity or mini-Hallucinations might be, they wouldn&#39;t be very practical.  Maybe mini-Fingernail Removers?</p>

            <p>I contacted Miss Cam just over a year ago, and she said she didn&#39;t do adoptions any more, but I was welcome to take over if I really wanted to.<br><br>Isengrad is, sadly, already adopted. However, Argaron isn&#39;t, and is in fact the first unadopted Aragorn mini I&#39;ve seen. You&#39;re welcome to take him, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be very happy. Make sure to feed him plenty of bacon and eggs. :)</p>

I&#39;m a male dragon with red scales from no fandom in particular with a tendency to incinerate things that displease me, although some of them have an annoying habit of getting up again afterwards. I think they&#39;ve built up an immunity. Anyway, I bumped into the PPC during random internet browsing about a year ago and have been dipping into it since, so I figured I&#39;d try and join in the fun. Although the idea of working for artificial lightning is a bit of a weird one, but never mind that.<br><br>I&#39;m quite happy to get involved in quite a few different fandoms, although I&#39;m not an obsessed-level fan of any one in particular. I *do* generally know more than most people if I&#39;m interested, but that&#39;s not really too hard, is it? Also, is it possible to do italics/bold/etc here?<br><br>Anyways. I&#39;ll stop rambling now. So - hi! And put down the sword, my scales are better armour than that.</p>

            <p>I comes bearing links. *drags out Big Bag O&#39; Links and digs through it*<br><br>First off is the link to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">Wiki</a>, a veritable fount of information for a newbie to read through. Especially helpful for you if you want to write missions would be the page on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> (note the capital P).<br><br>I would advise against reading any <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>, unless you are of strong mind and stomach. Even the summaries have been known to give those of weaker constitution nightmares.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, not knowing what you have already managed to find, I have several links for you. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek) is a good place to start, as the PPC did many aeons ago. <s>What do you mean I&#39;m exaggerating?</s> <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">The Department of Geographical Aberrations</a> is another interesting place to visit, if you have the time and inclination. Also by hS is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/index.htm">Tangled Webs</a> site, which contains backstory for the PPC as an organisation. If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be. And last, but most definitely not least, <a href="http://agenttrojie.livejournal.com/65922.html">Response Centre 45</a> is where Trojie and Pads&#39; missions are archived.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay here. Please deposit your sanity into the container offered to you by another Boarder; you won&#39;t be needing it here. <br><br>Italics, bold etc are possible here, if you know how to use HTML. Don&#39;t look to me for an explanation of how to do it though, since I&#39;ve found myself to be made of fail at such things.</p>

            <p>Greetings again all!<br><br>Those of you interested in my sojourns in the distant Land of Corn will doubtless read all about it on lj when I&#39;m alive enough to post, but I thought everyone would enjoy the road sign we passed about 6am this morning.

            <p>Old friends of Ianto, Gwen and Jack (!) keep popping up, knowing all about Torchwood. I thought these people were very good at keeping secrets (except for the part where they drive around in an SUV cleared marked TORCHWOOD). Ianto kept a cyberwoman in the basement, Jack never tells anyone anything about himself and Gwen didn&#39;t want to give Rhys retcon any more because she needed to be able tell someone about her day.<br><br>Or perhaps the Torchwood that is shown on the Eastern hemisphere is different than that on the Western?

            <p>Well, I remember all that stuff happening on the version I saw. So I&#39;m guessing &#39;no&#39; :P<br><br>Maybe the retcon doesn&#39;t work because all the Sues are half-Time Lord... Presumably their brain chemistry is different.<br><br>Now that I come to think of it, there was an actual episode where an old friend of Jack&#39;s popped up out of nowhere and knew all sorts of things about what was really going on.
