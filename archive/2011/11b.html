            <p>Actually, the connection to Harry Potter is uncertain to say the least, but it is technically a crossover.<br>Also, I feel I should mention, that this is an atypical mission for my agents. Normally their job is to watch the action, note the charges and slay the Sue/Stu/whatever, not to stop the action from unfolding, because they can&#39;t bear it. They are not meant to be action heroes and they will be returning to normal.<br><br>And it&#39;s relatively short!<br><br><a href="http://rc170.wordpress.com/2011/11/11/the-great-escape-aka-mission-one-point-five/"><a href="http://rc170.wordpress.com/2011/11/11/the-great-escape-aka-mission-one-point-five/">http://rc170.wordpress.com/2011/11/11/the-great-escape-aka-mission-one-point-five/</a></a><br><br>Souvernir: One Vortex Mnipulator.<br>No minis.</p>

            <p>Nice.  It&#39;s nice to read a bit of a &quot;sequel&quot; to an older mission, something we don&#39;t usually have the opportunity for.  I liked seeing the agents get emotional over Time Lord!Hermione&#39;s actions, considering how thoughtless and far-reaching they were, even for a Sue.</p>

            <p>I originally claimed this simply because it was a sequel, but I think it had enough for a mission in it&#39;s own right.<br>And yeah, I was pretty shocked, when I realised what was actually going on in the fic. It&#39;s one thing that this Sue doesn&#39;t know canon from a hole in the ground, but there&#39;s no excuse for knowing what a Meta Crisis is and not knowing what the consequences are.</p>

            <p>I like it!  I remember that Hermione-sue... ugh.  I&#39;m sorry you had to put up with that again.<br><br>And Steven... that was awful, what happened to him.  Powerful story, though, and well-written on your part.  Well done.  <br><br>And the ending was sweet.  <i>The Nightmare Before Christmas </i>is a wonderful angst-reducer.<br><br>All in all, a very cute mission :)</p>

            <p>Hi, guys.<br><br>I am... kind of the perpetual newbie who kept having life slap her in the face before really getting into the swing of things. I&#39;m back now, though, and am trying to make another go of it. (Really, I promise this time.)<br><br>Anyway, I had two Agents, Robin Thorn and Lucien, though only Robin will be making any return appearance and with a new partner. I&#39;m gonna hang out for a while, chat, etc., and I hear I can help current active Authors with their missions, so I might well do that for the sheer entertainment value.<br><br>PGs, I know I had permission before and did a mission or two, but it&#39;s been a long time and I&#39;m not really integrated into the community anymore. I&#39;ll just be re-asking for permission in a few months or something. :)<br><br>Nice to see you guys again, and here&#39;s to killing the Badfic dead!<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>~~ FractalDawn (aka Lee)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m kind of wondering... Because I used to hang around at ffr, myself; and then they started flaming me for absolutely nothing, calling me a homophobe when there was no good reason to do it. Some of you may remember that. I mentioned that I thought it was a bad idea to write a canonically straight character as gay without looking into how his life would be different; and how important I thought it was to keep character in slash fics in-character, instead of turning them into Generic Gay Guys(tm). And somehow they thought that made me a homophobe. No, I don&#39;t know why, either. But yeah, that&#39;s what made me finally decide to leave.<br><br>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re still hanging out there, with the way they insist you&#39;ve got to agree with whatever their party line is--that you&#39;ve got to reject only some kinds of bad writing, and not others. It&#39;s like some kind of high-school-girl in-group over there.</p>

            <p>First of all, I&#39;m male. Now then... it&#39;s a little worrying, having you PGs fight over me... haha...<br>Anyway, first I&#39;d like to answer your points to the best of my abilities.<br>1) That &#39;fic does not look so bad in first glance, but when you read it carefully (and believe me, I did) you find all sorts of stuff there. First of all, Artemis, the Doctor and Holly are driven so OOC that they won&#39;t be able to touch the canon with an eleven-foot pole. Second, the author has a serious malapropism problem, and interpreting these literally is quite funny. Third, she has so many weird grammar/spelling mistakes that good literal-jinny material. And third, I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s a possession!Sue (that, fittingly enough, possesses No.1 in the form of the non-canon &#39;midnight creature&#39;), and two villain!Sues that show later on. Fourth, the &#39;fic&#39;s plot makes as much sense as my bad third-grade (thankfully unpublished) Red Alert 2 fanfiction. There are more things, but they&#39;re less glaring.<br>2) &#39;A dark and stormy night&#39; is one of the oldest clichés.<br>I guess that &#39;queer&#39; can be interpreted as &#39;homosexual&#39;; that&#39;s a case of Have a Gay Old Time. I meant it to mean &#39;odd&#39;.<br>Same goes to the &#39;Lo&#39;. It could be seen as a Big No (which is a really, really big cliché) but in that case, I meant it to be &#39;lo&#39; as in &#39;lo and behold&#39;.<br>3) It seems to me that we understand &#39;instantly obeyed&#39; in two, very different, ways; however, I am unsure how to explain myself. That&#39;s the problem with half-baked philosophical ideas; if you don&#39;t really understand them yet, how can you explain them to other people?<br>4) I think that Huinesoron explained it well. Better than I can do in my current state of addled brains, anyway :P<br><br>OK, now that I&#39;ve got that out of the way: I am not hurt. Well, I was mildly depressed, but I get better easily. I&#39;m an incurable optimist (except when I&#39;m not. Haha). Anyway, I&#39;ll try and write another sample up. It&#39;ll take some time, though.<br><br>PS: That&#39;s the third nickname I got in my short stay here. It seems that it&#39;s either these, or a horde of Mini-boarders.<br>-desdendelle (AKA Dessie, dd, ddd, desden, etcetera)</p>

            <p>Thanks for taking this in stride, desdendelle, He-Who-Shall-Be-Henceforth-Known-As-Male. <br><br>1) Aw, man. That means <i>I</i> have to read the whole darn badfic to see if you&#39;re right. Oh, well. If you&#39;ll go through the trouble of writing another sample, I guess I can slog through some badfic. :)<br><br>2) Right, right, and right. Good to know you caught those! (Actually, the word &quot;queer&quot; wouldn&#39;t be so bad if the word &quot;mount&quot; didn&#39;t precede it. It&#39;s the double-double entendre that gets you. As for &quot;Lo,&quot; there are very few writers that can get away with using that word without it sounding pretentious. I&#39;ve never been able to use it convincingly myself, and here the problem is compounded by the fact that there is no accompanying gesture. As far as we know, your character yells the word in his dead brother&#39;s face (since he didn&#39;t move between cradling his brother&#39;s head and shouting &quot;Lo!&quot;). And we don&#39;t know who he is addressing (the cruel world? His gods? His people? The readers?), so it reads as somewhat random.)<br><br>3) That one sounds like it needs a bit more mulling over before you can slot it back into the excerpt.<br><br>4) Duly noted.<br><br>Glad that you&#39;re not too offended, and also that you&#39;re willing to come up with another writing sample.

            <p>Hello desdendelle,<br><br>I regret to say that, based on your post, your writing sample, and your chosen badfic, you currently do not have the skills necessary to be a good PPC mission writer.<br><br>Writing PPC missions requires:<br><br>• The ability to discriminate between the mediocre-to-subpar fics that populate a fandom, and the truly, hilariously bad fics that merit our attention. Your fic of choice is certainly not the greatest, but neither is it more than mildly bad. The crossover you chose is not particularly implausible, nor is the characterization blindingly awful. Thus, there is little to no humor to be mined from PPCing a fic like this, and your readers will quickly get bored.<br><br>• The ability to recognize unintentional hilarity in written work. This is a HUGE part of PPCing. Unfortunately, you do not seem to be able to find it in your own writing:<br><br>-  Your first paragraph begins, <i>It was a dark night,</i> and takes place during a storm.<br>-   Your fourth paragraph begins, <i>His mount was a queer beast.</i><br>-  Your antepenultimate paragraph ends, <i>“Lo!” was all he said, as he mourned for his dead brother.</i><br><br>If you do not know why people will find these sentences exceedingly funny, you still lack the requisite experience to mock badfic.<br><br>• A mature grasp of the English language and the elements of good storytelling. Your sample pegs you firmly as a beginning writer. Critiquing the stories of others, as we do in the PPC, requires an advanced command of the written word.<br><br>For instance, in PPCing the climax usually occurs when the agents rush out to attack and subdue an uncanon element. Unfortunately, your action scenes are slow and complicated. There is one paragraph I recall where the commander shouts “Battle formations!” and the soldiers obey instantly…and then the rest of the paragraph is just the <i>description</i> of that action painstakingly catching up to the action itself. You can&#39;t make the soldiers seem &quot;instantly&quot; obedient if it takes you five sentences to describe how they&#39;re obeying. I doubt that your agents could successfully subdue a Mary Sue in an exciting way.<br><br>Also, PPC missions require a lot of dialogue and movement, as the agents react in turn to the badfic’s purple prose and inane characterization. Your writing relies too heavily on description, passive voice, and redundancy. I count <i>three</i> uses of passive voice in your first paragraph alone. There are too many flowery descriptions of generic landscapes, and subjects “begin” to do verbs a total of nine times within a space of two pages. This should not discourage you from writing further, but it does mean that you need much more practice before your agents can take the field.<br><br>•  Originality. This may seem contradictory, as our missions are formulaic by nature. However, it is for this very reason that each new PPC writer must be able to do something unique, not only with the standard mission formula, but also with the constant cliché barrages of badfic. The entertainment value of your PPCing depends directly on a) how terrible the chosen badfic is, and b) how cleverly you can use the PPC framing device to dissect said badfic’s faults. Your writing sample demonstrates a thorough knowledge of one high fantasy trope after another, but there is more ingenuity in the helmet designs than in the new race of beings you created (which are eerily similar to the Na&#39;vi from <i>Avatar</i>). There is nothing wrong with your agent profiles (apart from the grammar), but there is not enough potential for your spin-off to contribute something new to the PPC universe.<br><br>If you would like to discuss this further, you can also drop me a note on the PPC wiki.<br><br>Sorry to disappoint!<br><br>Araeph<br></p>

            <p>On, um, pretty much all points.<br><br>-The badfic in question looks easily bad enough to make a fun mission out of; I certainly could (did you spot where Artemis claims no one knows about aliens because he was elsewhere whenever they showed up?). Remember, not every story PPC&#39;d has to be appallingly bad - I seem to remember ranting a bit about people always trying to top each other (and naming myself as the first offender over C<em>l</em>br__n). But more to the point - you just essentially claimed &#39;I can&#39;t see how you&#39;d do this, therefore you couldn&#39;t do it&#39;.<br><br>-I concur about the battle formations paragraph being awkward - if it&#39;s still wanted, I&#39;d probably have worked some of it in earlier (have them ride in such a way that they can fall into positions quickly, or something, then put the second half of the paragraph where it is). However, I&#39;ll cite this:<br><br><i>The bowmen fired; their arrows streaked toward the boughs, hitting them and setting them on fire. A shriek was heard from  above, and a flaming body fell down. A hail of arrows came in reply from above, slaying many, but the soldiers persisted, firing barrage after barrage of fire-arrows toward the trees, causing many of their assailants to fall down to the ground, dead and burning. However, the tree-toppers were far more numerous than the soldiers. In the end, they had won, although it was a pyrrhic victory. The soldiers had slain twice their numbers before the last one fell.</i><br><br>That&#39;s action. It could do with a break in the middle and the loss of that &#39;however&#39;*, but it&#39;s action, quickly and tersely described.<br><br>Again, more to the point: the latter half of your point seems to consist of &#39;It&#39;s not how I&#39;d do it, so it wouldn&#39;t work&#39;. I agree that when I write PPC missions, I tend to write a lot of dialogue, and that perhaps this wasn&#39;t the best writing sample for the genre in question. Shouldn&#39;t the response be to ask for an alternate sample?<br><br>-Originality: Um... ahahaha. Do you remember <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/aerilynzera/">Aerilyn and Zera</a>, Artemis&#39; attempt to write something more in line with the spirit of TOS than most spinoffs?

            <p><font color="blue">Hope the color blue doesn&#39;t offend.</font><br><br>On, um, pretty much all points.<br><br>-The badfic in question looks easily bad enough to make a fun mission out of; I certainly could (did you spot where Artemis claims no one knows about aliens because he was elsewhere whenever they showed up?). Remember, not every story PPC&#39;d has to be appallingly bad - I seem to remember ranting a bit about people always trying to top each other (and naming myself as the first offender over C<em>l</em>br__n). But more to the point - you just essentially claimed &#39;I can&#39;t see how you&#39;d do this, therefore you couldn&#39;t do it&#39;.<br><br><font color="blue">I am sure that you could make a fun mission out of this fic (and yes, I did miss that spot that you mentioned), but I am not sure at all that <i>this</i> writer could make a fun mission out of it, which is what was on the table. Also, while there are things to make fun of in that badfic, I don’t see it as being really destructive to the plot continuum. As fanfic goes, the canon rape is minimal, I don’t see any Sues or bad slash…there doesn’t seem to be anything that really goes against the <i>spirit</i> of Artemis Fowl or Doctor Who.</font><br><br>-I concur about the battle formations paragraph being awkward - if it&#39;s still wanted, I&#39;d probably have worked some of it in earlier (have them ride in such a way that they can fall into positions quickly, or something, then put the second half of the paragraph where it is). However, I&#39;ll cite this:<br><br>The bowmen fired; their arrows streaked toward the boughs, hitting them and setting them on fire. A shriek was heard from above, and a flaming body fell down. A hail of arrows came in reply from above, slaying many, but the soldiers persisted, firing barrage after barrage of fire-arrows toward the trees, causing many of their assailants to fall down to the ground, dead and burning. However, the tree-toppers were far more numerous than the soldiers. In the end, they had won, although it was a pyrrhic victory. The soldiers had slain twice their numbers before the last one fell.<br><br>That&#39;s action. It could do with a break in the middle and the loss of that &#39;however&#39;*, but it&#39;s action, quickly and tersely described. <br><br><font color="blue">I suppose it&#39;s a matter of opinion, but for me there is still too much retroactive description going on in that story for me to give a thumbs-up to the action. </font><br><br>Again, more to the point: the latter half of your point seems to consist of &#39;It&#39;s not how I&#39;d do it, so it wouldn&#39;t work&#39;. <font color="blue">Given enough time and prowess, a writer can make just about anything work. However, it is not just your missions that rely a lot on dialogue, and there’s a reason for that: it’s the format that tends to work best for our stories. <i>Could</i> a PPC mission conceivably be done with lots of slow decription and atmosphere-building? Of course. But the issue is whether this <i>particular</i> writer can pull it off, given the writing sample we got—and I’d still have to say no. </font>  I agree that when I write PPC missions, I tend to write a lot of dialogue, and that perhaps this wasn&#39;t the best writing sample for the genre in question. Shouldn&#39;t the response be to ask for an alternate sample?<br><br><font color="blue">That’s exactly what happened, in July’s post below mine. No response was forthcoming, even to say, “Not right now, could you wait until I have one?”, and I am sure that desdendelle saw that request, since s/he visited the Board in the time between July’s post and mine. </font><br><br>-Originality: Um... ahahaha. Do you remember Aerilyn and Zera, Artemis&#39; attempt to write something more in line with the spirit of TOS than most spinoffs? They were generic Real World humans (as far as I recall) with - gasp - not even a character profile to make them sound interesting. <font color="blue">And yet…they were interesting. The generic description of the sample’s world and characters (what little characterization exists), is not interesting at all. The fact that A&amp;Z’s missions were memorable suggests that there was something about the tone, characterization, etc. that made it more than just a clone of TOS. Also, I would argue that originality counts for more now than it did then, because there are <i>so many</i> spin-offs now that it’s hard for people to get excited about yet another one. (A perennial complaint being that people don’t read or review missions nearly as much as they should.) </font> And yet I love those missions. <font color="blue">Would you, honestly, <i>love</i> a mission written by this person? Do you think the PPC as a whole would love those missions? I&#39;ll put it another way. Without looking back at that excerpt, was there anything from that particular world that grabbed you, was emotionally compelling, made you want to go back to that world, or made you want to know more? If not, then why would the writer&#39;s rendition of the PPC be any different?</font><br><br>Overall, I understand what you&#39;re trying to do - and as a critique this was an excellent post - but I think you&#39;ve lost track of the point of Permission. We&#39;re not publishing a book here - we&#39;re letting people in at the ground level of a structure we&#39;re all building. &#39;Your sample pegs you firmly as a beginning writer&#39; should not be used as a pejorative. <font color="blue">It wasn’t. There’s nothing wrong with being a beginning writer. However, being a beginning writer in the PPC wouldn’t work, because it requires a thorough understanding of how a story functions—or doesn’t. </font><br><br>According to the Permission page, there are two reasons we use permission. Paraphrased from the first section:<br><br>1/ To make sure people are using the PPC name to describe the PPC, not something else entirely.<br>2/ To check for &#39;bad spelling, grammar and logic&#39; and Suvianness.<br><br><font color="blue">That is a very cogent paraphrase of my original words on permission. :D However, the second point—checking for bad spelling, grammar, and logic—was not a comprehensive list of what we may check for; it was a reference to the overarching concern  that PPC spin-offs be well-written. I would not call this sample well-written, even considering the lack of Sues and liberal use of the spell-check. (See my thoughts on word usage below.) </font><br><br>The only one of these you actually mentioned is grammar. (And no, humour isn&#39;t in there. From later in the same article &#39;as long as it reflects your ability to use spelling, punctuation, and grammar. <b>Humor is encouraged but not necessary.</b>&#39;) <font color="blue">It wasn&#39;t the fact that the excerpt lacked humor that bothered me. It was my doubt that this writer could recognize unintentional humor in the words of others. My doubts didn&#39;t come from the story&#39;s mood; they came from several parts of that excerpt that <i>were</i> humorous, yet managed to slip past the writer&#39;s radar. (Who goes up to his dead brother, cradles his head, and inexplicably belts out the word “LO!”?  That destroyed any sense of tragedy the writer had built up.)</font><br><br>From the post and the writing sample, desdendelle is capable of writing with spelling and grammar appropriate to the PPC. Word use, and specifically varying it, is something that could do with some work (egads! Passive voice! But I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know whether dd is male or female, so I was trying not to mention that - oops), but there is nothing here which should prevent him/her/it/starfish from writing a PPC spinoff.  <font color="blue">Word use is one of the most important things in language and in storytelling. The excerpt’s phrasing and sentences are generally too clunky, awkward, and lumbering to make good entertainment. Also, I want to have a humorous reaction from the badfic, not from the writing sample. And since this <i>is</i> a sample, I have to assume that it is this person’s best work—which isn’t terrible, by any means, but neither is it good PPC material. </font> I would grant that permission.<br><br><font color="blue">Then since we are at an impasse, we’ll probably need another sample of desdendelle’s work. I will add a comment to this thread requesting it. <br><br>If you want to resolve this through e-mail or chat, we can do that, too.<br><br>Araeph</font><br><br></p>

            <p>At least in regards to his writing. <br><br>There is grammar, yes, somewhere under the florid, florid prose, but if someone&#39;s writing reminds me of the Eye of Argon when I&#39;m reading it, that is not a good thing. <br><br>I&#39;d argue that while yes, his skills are likely at a level that meet qualifying for permission as far as writing goes, the dense writing style used here makes it difficult to say anything on the matter. The floridness of the description in his sample completely overtakes the ability to gauge if he normally tries to work on stuff- to steal easy framing- that&#39;s above his level, or if he used it in this case to try and showcase his writing. <br><br>Florid prose has a time and place, and I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s not necessarily appropriate for the PPC or trying to get permission for the PPC with it. <br><br>As a counter example, in terms of style counting against a person, MAXInsanity&#39;s original permission request had been shot down mainly because his sample was set at the PPC, was supremely grimdark, and showed little sign of humor or much in the way of optimism. His writing, however, was very competent, and given how much he writes, has no doubt improved since then (and if you are reading this, MAX, heeey, hint hint). <br><br><br><br>That said, Desdendelle, again, if you have an alternate writing sample to show that is not as florid, I would love to see it. </p>

            <p>I just read the mission, and well, Fix and the Carver came off as being supremely overpowered, and as a Stu and Sue. <br><br>This was their first mission as I understand, and I read their bit in the Halloween cowrite, but nothing more beyond that.<br><br>The thing that alarmed me about them possibly being overpowered characters was this portion:<br><br>&#39;Fix barely managed to dodge the centaur’s kick. In response, his senses heightened, his reflexes sharpened and most importantly, his nails became lethally sharp claws. Rather than running or dodging, Fix threw himself at Firenze, knocking him off balance. Man and centaur fell to the ground, fighting and struggling until finally, the centaur was dead. Fix managed to shove the body away and climbed to his feet. He fumbled for the miraculously unbroken RA and opened a portal.&#39;<br><br>This comes out of essentially nowhere; he becomes suddenly super bad ass and is able to kill a <i>centaur</i>, essentially unarmed, in close combat. A kick from an ordinary horse can cause serious internal injuries that can kill even a full grown man, and those cases aren&#39;t even from a horse that thinks its life is in serious trouble. Those are just &#39;Eek! You are invading my personal privacy!&#39; kicks. <br><br>But you have him managing to walk off, mostly in one piece and alive and in good enough health that he&#39;s still able to quip and explain what happened before he goes to Medical, where he&#39;s still in good enough condition that he walks through on his own power, as far as we can tell.<br><br>Reading his page on the wiki fills me with even less confidence that he&#39;s not a Stu. His personality section directly contradicts itself in that he&#39;s blunt, crude, and direct and cuts to the point in conversations, but he likes having conversations? <br><br>He&#39;s also described as having adrenal-reactive abilities, regarding the claws, his senses, agility, and balance, but you don&#39;t mention anything about strength or superhealing- the first which was implied by his choice of using force to dispatch with the centaur, and the second that you stated outright at the end of the mission. I see no real drawbacks explained on his page- beyond that he can&#39;t drink blood for whatever reason because that makes him sleep. This is something that is so incredibly unlikely to happen during a mission- there&#39;s no suggestion that he&#39;s fighting a bloodlust in the mission, or that he needs to drink on a regular basis- that it&#39;s a free power.<br><br>I can&#39;t comment much on the Carver&#39;s sueishness because I have little understanding of the Dresden Files- only read the first book- but this description here doesn&#39;t bode well for her:<br><br>&#39;The Carver now wore a tight black leather outfit that made her look like the heroine from a spy movie. Her hair was braided down her back, and she had a number of bulges in various places that suggested the secretion of various knives.&#39;<br><br>You have her dress in a catsuit- and directly state it makes her look like a spy movie heroine- and threaten to dismember Fix the moment he sees her. If she didn&#39;t like the outfit, or felt self conscious in it enough to make her threaten others over how she looks in it, why would she wear it? There&#39;s no point to an outfit like that in the PPC unless it&#39;s outright required for a disguise within a mission. How would she get she get those various knives out, out of curiosity? Given how tight the outfit is, what is the practicality in concealing weapons under it?<br><br>...Beyond that, there&#39;s also the disturbing issue of using &#39;secretion&#39;. Secretion is very rarely used to mean things were hidden away. The more common use and meaning of the word refers to discharge, excretion. I don&#39;t think you mean to suggest she&#39;s excreting knives out from her skin or other organs.<br><br>On that topic, you charged and mocked the writing for a few things that are common and acceptable phrases, like &quot;felt a blush creep up his neck&quot;. This is a valid use. <br><br>Beyond that, they came off as being viciously unfriendly towards each other, and the mission&#39;s tone was more overtly hostile than humorous. These agents seem incapable of an affectionate laugh either at their own foibles or at each other&#39;s- vicious comments, mocking, and threats don&#39;t count.<br><br>Your agents come off as being supremely overpowered, and have a great deal of attributes that cements them as Sues.<br><br>I&#39;ll be asking other PGs for their own thoughts on all this, because I don&#39;t feel comfortable saying anything more than asking you to take a break with writing more PPC works at the moment. </p>

            <p>I just hope that we can make sure that everybody knows that the point is to help each other write better--that we wouldn&#39;t be doing concrit if we didn&#39;t think there was a good deal of potential there.<br><br>I&#39;m mostly a grammar fiend--one of those people who instinctively reaches for a red pen at the slightest hint of apostrophe misuse.

That&#39;s kind of what attracted me to the PPC in the first place, actually; I liked the concept of going in there and fixing all the bad stories out there. When I was a fourteen-year-old into Animorphs, I used to save other people&#39;s fanfiction to a floppy disk at the library, and then go home and edit and re-write it so that it made sense and flowed better. I never told the authors because I was too shy... Ah, the memories!</p>

            <p>The important thing about poking fun at badfic is that fun sometimes pokes you back. And that&#39;s a <i>good</i> thing. Think about how much more likable your characters would be if they got off a good-natured jibe at themselves once in a while. (If they are constitutionally incapable of doing so, they are really unsuited for being in the PPC.)<br><br>There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with an agent being dangerous, but a &quot;You&#39;d better not mess with me <i>or else</i>!&quot; vibe is good for one thing only in the PPC: laughter.<br><br>Now, consider how much more interesting a character would be if the author (you) poked fun at the agents. Not to make them totally incapable, but to make them more human (so to speak). For instance: if you wanted to keep the characters essentially the same, you could have the Carver keep her tight leather costume, but have fellow agents in the cafeteria snicker at it, ending with her shouting, &quot;Hey, what&#39;s so funny?&quot;  Or, if you wanted to have knives strapped to all sorts of weird places on her body, you could have her try to pull one of them out to finish off a Sue, and realize that she would have to <i>take off the piece of clothing</i> that she&#39;s concealing the weapon under in order to reach it in a fight. (Oops.)  <br><br>If Fix has what seems to be werewolf-like powers, you could have him possess the realistic senses of a canine--to the point where his sense of smell means TMI about his partner&#39;s personal grooming/eating habits, and strong, sickly-sweet Sue scents make him nauseous. It&#39;s not just about having power or not having it, but how you treat that power in your missions.<br><br></p>

            <p>hmm...<br><br>Why did you have her wear leather? I mean, like, is it a style choice--she likes leather, for some reason? Part of a subculture?

I think a good rule of thumb is probably: If a trait doesn&#39;t add to or support your character&#39;s personality, if it&#39;s there just to look cool, then dump it. That&#39;s excess glitter. It has the effect of cluttering up the character, so you have to spend a lot of time maintaining all those extra little traits you didn&#39;t really need in the first place.<br><br>Once you get into outright &#39;Sue territory, you have glitter that&#39;s totally unexplained, never even used, flies in the face of logic, etc... I don&#39;t think you&#39;re in that range yet--just that it&#39;d probably be simpler to trim the extra stuff, so you could focus on your character&#39;s personality.</p>

            <p>Have you tried spinning that incident a different way?<br><br>You know how usually, Assassins are supposed to be efficient, quick, clean--just plain effective at killing Sues. They tend to be pretty pragmatic, quickly sneaking up on a Sue and incapacitating it; or else just killing it straight out because it hasn&#39;t got enough of a personality to resist.<br><br>So, in this case, your agent got into a fight with a character replacement. What if he accidentally alerted the replacement Firenze of his presence, and had to fight instead of doing a quick, stealthy assassination?<br><br>I don&#39;t see why you shouldn&#39;t have your agents fighting stuff; it can be interesting. Just remember to keep the general PPC vibe going--you know, barely competent, everyday people, stuck into a situation that&#39;s completely crazy, and making it out again more because they&#39;re creative and persistent than because they&#39;re badass. Down the path of badass lies the Stu. :P<br><br>Oh, and one more thing. However you re-write it, you absolutely have to keep that &quot;delicate hand&quot;. It&#39;s deliciously creepy!</p>

            <p>I think that agents could be cool and fight Sues/Stus/hazards/threats/etc. in interesting ways, but also there are some things to consider:<br><br>1)Is it a particularly meaningful situation for this to happen? Is the agent really hyped up, really angry, or acting in an &#39;emergency&#39; manner, or is this epic maneuver/feat ho-hum for them? To do something as callous as cite myself, the agent Aster in a deep, personal rage could handle three shambling skeletons, but without that drive she wasn&#39;t able to harm even one generic mook in a big battle. To make her, a baseline human with only moderate experience stabbing things, able to take on enemies as if it wasn&#39;t a big deal would tread dangerously close to Sue.<br><br>2) Does this agent have a &#39;power factor&#39; that could enable this? An agent with weaponized biology (Ilraen can pierce a Sue-thing with his tail blade, for instance) or some other special power? Is this Agent trained in combat/a former soldier? Are they experienced Agents? If not, they might not want to take on centaurs in single combat. I would trust ESAS or DAVD agents to be able to take on &#39;direct&#39; threats more often than DMS or Floaters... though I notice most teams have one &#39;tough&#39; agent that tends to handle nastier things and one agent that hangs back.<br><br>2.5) If they have special powers, they also are susceptible to anything those with such powers are susceptible to. Jedi have the weaknesses of Jedi, for example. Soldiers may not know what to do in situations they aren&#39;t trained for. Taking fighting prowess, like any trait, provides both benefits and drawbacks.  <br><br>3) Is it funny? Seeing people try to fight but failing in hilarious ways is often more entertaining than seeing somebody beat people up easily.<br><br>Just some thoughts. I sort of am thinking about writing agents that are more powerful than what I think is the norm, and sticking them in ESAS. We criticize a lot of bad portrayals of people with strength and power. Fighting us some Sues isn&#39;t a bad thing: It just has to be done well, with the same consideration the PPC gives to everything.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s nothing wrong (at least, the way I see it) with some rip-snorting agent fights. Written well, such scenes can be interesting and exciting. They can also provide a nice break from the typical &quot;stand there like an idiot as we lecture you before dumping you into a volcano&quot; mission wrap-up.<br><br>Aster has made a good list of points to consider. Here are a few additional things that I think should also be taken under review when writing about agents in combat:<br><br><b>BE SNEAKY</b><br>The PPC, for the most part, consists of fairly normal folks. Sues and Stus, however, are ultra-powerful abominations of literature. It&#39;s not exactly fair fight. So, you should be a little sneaky about this sort of stuff. Have one agent go read the charges while her partner hangs back with a sniper rifle. Set traps - mines or high explosives are always fun.<br><br><b>USE POWERS WELL</b><br>Aster kinda already touched on this, but I wanted to expand on it a little bit. Having special powers doesn&#39;t make someone a Sue or Stu. Using those powers in a stupid &quot;break the plot&quot; way does.<br><br>If you&#39;re going to create an agent with powers, set a final &quot;do not cross&quot; limit on them right away. Lets look at Gremlin, if I might use myself as an example. She&#39;s a DC universe metahuman with the ability to control electromagnetic forces. However, she can only MOVE electricity, not generate it herself. They only way she would be able to shopt off a bolt of lightning is if someone had fired it at her first. Of course, she&#39;d have to survive not being fried first.<br><br>Benefits and drawbacks, folks.<br><br><b>GET YOUR HAIR A LITTLE MUSSED</b><br>As I mentioned before, there is a big power imbalance between your typical agent and your typical Sue/Stu. Sometimes, for all their sneakiness and combat pragmatism, agents get injured. That&#39;s why we have a Medical Department.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying that we start crippling agents left and right. If they do end up in a knock-down fight, however, a few nasty cuts and a black eye (or whatever) would not be amiss.<br><br>More food for thought.</p>

            <p>... taken as a whole, the questions indirectly stated ‘nothing in the mission was actually ‘Sue or ‘Stuish because of these factors.’ They acknowledged the issues many of us had with the mission—the ‘like a heroine of a spy movie’ with the tight leather transformation, the completely nonsensical fight scene, etc.<br><br>However, the phrasing and manner of answering them pretty much said that despite the problems existing, there was no real reason to consider them flaws. Just about any situation can be justified in writing as a reason to take out those powers and abuse them, and asking those questions in the way they were asked implies that so long as you forcibly engineer a situation, you can do whatever you want.<br><br>That kind of writing is a huge part of what the PPC has been trying to deal with for years. Why the questions attempted to excuse this was baffling to me, especially given Astral&#39;s grace and maturity in the discussion and acceptance of concrit.</p>

            <p>My reading of Aster&#39;s questions says nothing of the sort - she hits a few of the points that make the difference between a Suvian &quot;Oh, I&#39;m so awesome&quot; fight scene and a real character. She doesn&#39;t bother to apply them directly to Astral&#39;s story, just leaves them as points to consider.<br><br>A Sue is not in what the Sue does, or can do, but in how she&#39;s written. Take, for example, character X. She&#39;s an elvish princess of considerable power. She flips off her uncle, one of the greatest leaders of elves and/or men ever. When he abandons her, she leads a host of her people across what is effectively Greenland - if Greenland was seismically active. She stands and fights -repeatedly!- against the greatest evil the world ever sees, rules her people wisely for thousands of years, and when she finally gets fed up with things, tears the fortress of the second greatest evil ever to walk the land apart with her own force of will.<br><br>Her name? Galadriel. She is not a Sue.<br><br>See also the Emo!Sue and the Anti!Sue, for examples of Sues who are not powerful, cannot do anything right, etc. Powers and Sueishness are not intrinsically linked. The only consideration is how well written they are; do they twist the story until it revolves around them, or no? Do they do things without explanation to make themselves look cool/powerful/wise/beautiful/pathetic/etc or no?<br><br>In general, Aster&#39;s point is that Agents don&#39;t have to be normal humans to avoid being Sues. You just have to think and write more carefully.</p>

            <p>The points were <em>phrased</em> as &#39;to consider in the future,&#39; but they were pretty much in response to issues under discussion. You said that yourself.

How many times have Sues and Stus had a scene be emotional for them merely for the sake of melodrama? Same for having a power or use of a power--it&#39;s easy to have a Two-Edged Power or Tragic Back Story Bestowing Strength. Those questions are usually answered by an author, and sometimes even technically within world rules.<br><br>In fact, Astral&#39;s did so, both in the mission and the Wiki.<br><br>But because that check isn&#39;t infallible in either direction (Sue or non-Sue) it made the post come off strongly as apologetic.<br><br>As a side note: if the thoughts were unrelated to the discussion, why post in this thread?</p>

            <p>If I&#39;m honest that &#39;unrelated&#39; list looked to me like a set of excuses and arguments that Astral could use to defend her fic against the concrit, too.<br><br>This whole tangent is crazy and should have been unrelated all along.

            <p>Okay, first off: I should apologize for being off-topic and self-agrandizing. This thread is for Astral, not for off-topic discussions. Astral: I&#39;m sorry. My bad. I&#39;ll try my best not be a huge spotlight-stealing doorknob in the future.<br><br>That being said...<br><br>I don&#39;t like being accused of being a Sue apologist. I don&#39;t like having words I didn&#39;t say put into my mouth. NOWHERE did I write that Sue/Stu agents are fine, regardless of considerations. My intention was to merely suggest that powers and scenes of drama/action by themselves do not a Sue or Stu make. Nothing more.</p>

            <p>My comment was on the original phrasing, and actually, PC, yours were quite different and addressed the issues concretely. I left me with a complete understanding of what you meant--and, in fact, ways to avoid what came up in Astral&#39;s mission.<br><br>The reason the original phrasing felt like an apology was <em>because</em> it showed, as ways to make a non-Sue, things that were done in Astral&#39;s mission that were leading into Sue territory. Because the comments were made with no knowledge of context? Taken <em>in</em> context it sounded like an excuse.<br><br>I would also like to point out that I said the check of dramatic scenes and powers was not infallible in <em>either</em> direction, whether to confirm either a Sue <strong>or</strong> a non-Sue.</p>

            <p>Wow, that&#39;s some pretty bad slash all right. Firenze... *shudder* I mean, crack pairings can be fun; but the way they wrote this one was just... euuugh. Pass the freaking brain bleach.<br><br>BTW, I disagree with you on Hermione&#39;s reaction to Firenze/Harry. She&#39;s Muggle-born and grew up without the usual Wizarding-world prejudices, and she&#39;s notoriously accepting of non-humans--the episode with the house-elves displays that nicely. So she probably wouldn&#39;t freak out at Firenze being a centaur. She&#39;d totally freak out at Harry going to the Forbidden Forest, though--initially because it&#39;s against the rules; thereafter because it&#39;s dangerous and there wasn&#39;t a good reason to go there. And she&#39;d freak if Harry were currently in a relationship and thus cheating on whoever it was. Ginny, at this age, I guess.<br><br>What annoyed me about the whole thing, ironically, was the total astronomy fail. Stars don&#39;t &quot;align&quot;. They&#39;re too far away for us to see them moving. And those are not the names of stars, either--those aren&#39;t constellation names, and the Roman numerals after the names would mean that in the case of the XXIV, that that&#39;s the twenty-fourth brightest star in that constellation. That&#39;s probably not even bright enough to see without a telescope. If we&#39;re referring to planets here (in the sense of &quot;wandering stars&quot; and &quot;the stars align&quot;), that&#39;s still a fail. Wizards use the same planet names that the Muggle world does.<br><br>I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m a bit of an astronomy buff, but really, the author could&#39;ve googled it. There are star charts there for the asking, and as easy to read as a map of your hometown, too.<br><br>That thing really needed to be killed.</p>

            <p>For me, this was a pairing that didn&#39;t make me go &#39;ugh&#39;, it made me go &#39;huh?&#39; Not just the question of how exactly a human and a centaur would... well, you know... but also how they&#39;d get together in the first place. Centaurs just Do Not Like humans, and the author tossing that rather relevant piece of information aside really annoyed me.<br><br>You&#39;re quite right about Hermione, I kind of forgot that- and I forgot about Ginny, too. Damn. *goes to fix it*<br><br>The astronomy fail annoyed me, too. I don&#39;t know much about it, but I know what and what isn&#39;t a constellation name. I&#39;m guessing the author was either too lazy to look up some constellations or wanted some Cool and Original names.<br><br>Thanks for reading. :)</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve seen that sort of thing done well. In the season one finale of <i>Dollhouse</i>, for instance, you find out exactly what&#39;s going to happen by the end of season two.

            <p>First off, OOH BACKSTORY! Seriously though, this mission does a very good job of fleshing out Orken&#39;s character. It gives him a greater sense of depth, which is something that is always good to shoot for. Kudos to you for that!<br><br>That being said, the mission as a whole feels a bit scattershot regarding the overall tone. Jeannine&#39;s descent into maddness initially seems like it&#39;s going to be played somewhat dramatically. However, this preconception is almost immediately discarded with a kinda goofy crossover and a very goofy breakdown. Then, at the very end of the mission, we return to the present day and back to everything geared towards drama.<br><br>Sometimes drastic tonal switches like the ones in this mission work very well. Dark comedy, dramedy, whatever you what to call it: it&#39;s a legitmate genre. However, I personally don&#39;t think that it worked in this case. Jeannine ranting about historical politicians and coffee rain made it very difficult for me to take the story seriously. Had her breakdown been a little more darker, I probably would have enjoyed this mission a great deal more than I did.<br><br>Still, you did some nice character-building here, and there seems to be some interesting strain building between your agents. I&#39;m looking forward to your next mission.</p>

            <p>Good points. I understand what you&#39;re talking about. If I ever write this kind of dramedy in the future, I&#39;ll try to keep it in mind. Consistency of tone is honestly an issue I have never had to deal with at this level before. <br><br>I think another issue that this points to is this mission being more about building Orken&#39;s character than telling Jeannine&#39;s story. I think I segregated the flashback and the &quot;present&quot; stuff in a way I really shouldn&#39;t have, at least in my mind. I dunno. This is making me think about things I didn&#39;t when I was writing this (or at least not this much about.) Thanks for provoking my thoughts.</p>

            <p>Yeah, that sure was different then usual. Don&#39;t see someone going mad (well, long-term anyway) very often. I can sorta sympathize with Orken, and agree with him. But, he probably should have found something better then Luxury for that, of course, Orken probably isn&#39;t used to those emotions (Well, genocide toilets aside) so, he still gets a hug.<br><br>*Hugs Orken* ^_^<br><br>Can;t wait to see more of this unfold!</p>

            <p>My original agent pair is in the DIC, so I can definitely relate.

            <p>I just found that entire chapter extremely amusing.

Anyone else think Vignar Grey-Mane is Tigger? I checked Jim Cummings&#39; Wiki page but it didn&#39;t say anything.<br><br>Second story. I&#39;m running around the mountains just north of Whiterun (I&#39;m not very far in the game, maybe level 8 at this point). I spot this little cabin up ahead and I decide to check it out. Out of no were I hear this screech and the ground shakes as a dragon lands between me and the cabin. I wanted to go to that cabin, and I did need a dragon soul, so charged it. After a short skirmish it jumped into the air and started to circle, that&#39;s when I noticed the other one... Crap! Time to load last save.<br><br>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have more soon, but for now, let&#39;s hear you&#39;re tales of honor and glory, or non-glory, whichever.</p>

            <p>And ye gods does that fit as a name. Through a no-doubt amusing series of misadventures I wound up trying to cross the enormous mountain towards the Eastern edge of the map. With great difficulty and enormous luck, I managed to scale all the way to the top of that ridge, overlooking the wastes on the other side, sure that I could finally get through the pass to my destination... only to be greeted by &quot;You cannot go this way.&quot; If I could curse in Dragon, I <i>would</i>.<br><br>I&#39;m playing a Khajiit-- I almost always do, even wrote a brief ficlet about it set in Oblivion/Shivering Isles. This time, I&#39;m even playing a woman Khajiit! Crazy, I know. Aside from various benefits (claws! night-eye! <i>fuzzy ears</i>!), I generally play these games with a narrative running in the back of my mind the whole time, and it occurred to me that the sort of Khajiit that journeys into <i>Skyrim</i> from the desert would be a very interesting character indeed!<br><br>I mean, you&#39;re going from a desert to a harsh, unforgiving wilderness-- a traveler without any permanent home, drawn by a destiny unknown. But not your typical Strong, Handsome, Muscular Hero, no. A slight, wiry Khajiit, leopard-spotted and grinning, dwarfed by the towering Nords whose homes she defends (or breaks into, depending). A shadowy, unnoteworthy furred shadow, slipping through the bleak rocks and peaks amidst howling winds and blinding snow, with the Northern Lights shining above. You can almost hear the note of surprise in the smith&#39;s voice as you agree to make the dangerous journey, and the grudging respect in various Jarls&#39; tones as you accept, and mount, their challenges. The sneering of the bandits (&quot;Your hide will make a fine rug, cat!&quot;), which dies on their lips as a flank and feint takes the ground out from under their feet. The unquestioning calm of the masters, so unexpected in such a hard place. The surprising beauty of the mountain streams, and wild joy of leaping up waterfalls like the ancestral sabre-cats that delight in ambush.<br><br>...I&#39;m probably having way too much fun with that inner narrative.</p>

            <p>To be honest, the most interesting part of the story would probably be afterwards-- the denouement of the action. How would a Khajiit react to returning to the desert and her people, after a story like that? I can&#39;t imagine walking taller, obviously, since Khajiit are not going to grow after maturation-- but she&#39;d be used to walking among Nords, tall and strong and, relatively speaking, giants. (And real giants, at that.)<br><br>Crossing the border, as the mountains slowly turn to grassland and you leave behind the mountains where you walked on the Throat of the World, where you learned to speak in words that mortal men fear to utter, where you made a name for yourself, far from home, beneath ice and snow and beasts of pure destruction in the night.<br><br>Crossing again, from grasslands to the far desert sands of Elsweyr-- how would such a hero be received? Word of the events of Skyrim may have reached far, but picture it-- a Khajiit warrior, standing in a fighter&#39;s stance, bearing weapons that have seen frost and ice and giant&#39;s clubs, returning to the moonlit lands of her birth... where few remember or recognize her. Shunned is probably too strong a word, but &#39;aloof,&#39; perhaps, works. A Khajiit who has learned songs of typical Northern Battle Glory and rage, who developed a taste for Nord mead, who has wrestled in the halls of Jorrvaskr and whose claws have wrested dragon&#39;s souls from their scales.<br><br>You&#39;d wake in the night when a howl sounded, blade half-raised to meet an oncoming wolf, and whoever might be there would look at you oddly. One eye would always be watching the sky, for the oncoming roar of the beasts you once feared and battled. Shunned, perhaps not-- but never quite the same.<br><br>(Okay, I&#39;m <i>definitely</i> having too much fun with this inner narrative.)</p>

            <p>I think that&#39;s the proper way to play this kind of game, cause if you don&#39;t roleplay you&#39;re character might end up being boring to play.<br><br>I picture my character as a Dragonborn from DnD4e. Proud and honorable, a threat against a friend is a threat against me. I charge strait into battle with my greatsword drawn. I feel seeking around to be dishonorable, that a true warrior should stand and face his enemies head on. I&#39;m not evil but I love to fight. I&#39;m the kind of guy that uses the monster manual as a &quot;to do&quot; list.<br><br>At the end of a long day I sit back with the Companions and we tell stories of battle until dawn.<br><br>That&#39;s way more fun than simply following quest hooks.</p>

            <p>This bill is a Very Bad Thing. Taking media law class, I&#39;ve learned that America is supposed to work on the assumption that there is a free market of ideas: anybody can come in and say whatever they want. The government isn&#39;t supposed to say who can come in, stop people at the door, or stand in front of certain sources of information.<br><br>In this bill&#39;s quest to hinder a portion of the internet, it threatens to stand in front of the whole internet and prevent access... and even mess up the way the internet itself works.<br><br>Not to mention it&#39;s horribly vague and just... ahaugh. The idea that streaming a video game can become a felony... So many things use streaming nowadays- even music labels!<br><br>Needless to say, I&#39;ve signed a zillion things, sent letters to all of my representatives, sent letters to the representatives of the state I&#39;m currently in, and have my eyes peeled.</p>

            <p>Fic: &quot;Aragon and the angeli&quot; (Author: 1945)<br><br>As the fic progresses through ALL THREE books of the L.O.T.R. trilogy, I have attempted to try and cover a lot of the material as possible (due to multiple charges spread out all over the place.)<br><br>I have retained a copy of the fic and am in the process of sporking it, but I just found out that the fic is no longer on FF.Net.<br><br>I think Agents Hammond and Roth have a Deletion on their hands.<br><br>This leads to a couple of questions:<br><br>1) When should the effects of a deletion ideally take place? ; and<br><br>2) Can Agent-created portals be utilised to &quot;jump&quot; in between sections of the fic to compress time and writing space?</p>

            <p>Not fun, Fun. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a specific way deletions are handled aside from the world ceasing to exist. You can have the world fall apart slowly. You can have a sudden cut-off... oh the possibilities.<br><br>It&#39;s really flexible. Check the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Deletion">wiki article</a>.<br><br>Second question: You can skip things, especially if nothing important happens or you don&#39;t get any new charges in that portion of the fic.</p>

            <p>Uh, so, well. I found myself guided through the weird corridors of the internet to this general direction and was so entranced by the delicious administrating of justice that I decided to continue procrastinating from writing and self-commiserating to stop on by and languish with you all!.. I can&#39;t promise that I&#39;ll be very active, given that I tend to get scared by friendliness and become shy, even on the internet, but! <br><br>Enough o&#39; that. This is awesome, you are awesome. You are all my heroes. Heroes, do you hear? So, so long as I&#39;m in the general area and you&#39;re in the general area I thought we could hang and discuss... Things. That would be swell. Ultraswell! That&#39;s pretty much it. Stay frosty, or if you end up a little *too* frosty in these dark and dreary days, then get toasty! All right, that&#39;s all. Time to go hibernate some more and wait for spring and light and the soil to sing - it can&#39;t come enough, if you ask me! At least the 22nd should be clear and pretty~</p>

            <p>Minus the shallow, callowness (and with a second helping of word cavalcades)! Thank you very much for both the welcome and this awesome hat!

I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s probably a way to password lock my name and I should be looking into that?

            <p>Someone reported here a couple of times several months ago that  a troll on ffnet was stealing the title of popular authors in a few fandoms, particularly Redwall, and posting this garbage with the established author&#39;s title.  I believe several folks from here reported this disgusting creature to the ffnet admins.<br><br>It looks like a troll dedicated enough to follow reporters around and harrass them would be dedicated enough to come up with new material every year or so.</p>

            <p>Usually we wouldn&#39;t be so quick to think that it was a purposeful post by whoever had their name stuck to it.  However, the spammers are usually not as coherent as this one was and this usually happens to someone we have had a chance to get to know more, so it is easier to distinguish between the Boarder and a spammer who is using their name.

            <p>Y&#39;all were just looking out for your own - I&#39;d have done the same thing if some stranger had posted some terrible crock. I&#39;ve never been one to like securing my name anyway; perhaps this was just a reminder that although my laid-back attitude can be easy and thickens my skin up, there are still things that can shake even the most hardened of internet dwellers. What really kills me is the first thing I did after waking up/preppin&#39; coffee/checkin&#39; e-mails was get a face full of that. What a way to start that day, right?</p>

            <p>Because I thought I heard you say fandoms!<br><br>It&#39;d be easier to list what aren&#39;t my fandoms, probably; but taking the easy road is boring and the internet is like an all-terrain vehicle! The things I like most, hmn... Mysteries of all sorts, from the golden age to here and now; Poirot and Marple and Father Brown; Miles Bredon and Lord Peter and Umineko. Metafiction (is that even really a genre) of all sorts; magical realism and things that inspect villains and their motives without falling into villain worship or idolization; surrealism, depressive stuff and The Death Of The Vazir Mukhtar which I just recently found out has a rather good tvtropes page. I realize the english copy is hard to find but it&#39;s one of the most amazing books ever and and and<br><br>Uh, cosmic horror and deconstructions of what that actually means; horror in general. Supernatural cosmic horror romance murder mysteries... That *weren&#39;t* all just a dream! Shin Megami Tensei - demons, spirits, mythology, NATURE! Ah, glorious Nature! Gogol, Kafka, Nabokov. The typical awesomepack of things; Trek, Rings, Disc, Douglas Adams. Satoshi Kon, everything he ever did. Cartoons! Avatar, Adventure Time and recently, MlP: FiM. Anything that empowers - regardless of who or how. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things as opposed to epically heroic people... usually! With exceptions, oh so many exceptions.<br><br>There&#39;s very little I don&#39;t like - even things that I don&#39;t necessarily enjoy myself - Warhammer, Sliders, Howard the Duck - I can usually find something interesting or funny or worth talking about. To me, words and creativity and worlds (wordworlds!) are just... Yeah, wonderful! I guess my only exception would be that as much as I&#39;m crazy and metafictional and very much into things that sometimes fans - or the worst of - can get to me. I really love Touhou, for example; but after trying to join into the fandom multiple times I just end up feeling kind of... Eh. I don&#39;t know.<br><br>And writing-wise I&#39;m a hack, and openly admit it - but nothing hurts me more when people write sues or so no regard for anything or just... Ugh. Hopefully I&#39;ve never/never will do anything like that, and this seems like the place to watch it get taken down - with handy afterbeatdown linear notes! <br><br>Hopefully that wasn&#39;t too much of a ramble, but I&#39;ll definitely be interested in hearing about spamfloods and things past and present and *discussions!* Thanks for the welcome and the reassurances and hopefully I&#39;ll be a somewhat interesting if on-again off-again visitor!

            <p>Brother Cadfael! Oh, wow. That was probably one of the first things that I saw growing up; despite already being torn between learning about the Slavosphere/elsewhere, I knew from then on that stories of Saxons and Normans and monks and mystery would be at the heart of my life. I actually haven&#39;t read the books yet - you&#39;ve reminded me to pick them up! Thank you! I&#39;d also recommend My Name is Red your way, in return.

            <p>Such as Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Vivaldi, etc. To be honest, I don&#39;t listen to music that much but when I do, it&#39;s usually classical (do I sound like the Dos Equis guy?). I also love the score to the opera &quot;Carmen&quot; even though I&#39;ve never actually seen it. </p>

            <p>...we need to work on getting you into some of the lesser known composers. Seriously, there are a TON of classical composers, and a lot of them escape the public eye for many reasons.<br><br>So I&#39;ll just run you through a primer of a couple of composers whose music you have to hear sometime.<br><br>So... let&#39;s get started:<br><br>Claudio Monteverdi (Italian Renaissance composer, mostly known as the guy who REALLY brought Opera into its own as its own genre):<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6tJWY2Vaz4"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6tJWY2Vaz4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6tJWY2Vaz4</a></a><br><br>Richard Wagner (German Romantic composer, perhaps best known for the concept of the &#39;leitmotif&#39;. He wrote &quot;Ride of the Valkries&quot;, which always pisses me off because it&#39;s far from the best thing Wagner ever wrote.):<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs_UxPMrekg"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs_UxPMrekg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs_UxPMrekg</a></a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG6p8bLdaQU"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG6p8bLdaQU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG6p8bLdaQU</a></a><br><br>Dmitri Shostakovich (Russian 20th Century composer. Yes, that means he was part of the Soviet Union, but trust me, he had rather frequent spats with his government because of his music.)<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC-pqRMasPQ"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC-pqRMasPQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC-pqRMasPQ</a></a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjK2pPqh3cQ"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjK2pPqh3cQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjK2pPqh3cQ</a></a><br><br>And that&#39;s a few I can think of off the top of my head that you&#39;d probably get really into. ;)</p>

Maybe we shall even discuss the ballet! I&#39;ll second HerrWozzeck in that Wagner has done so much that&#39;s not Ride of the Valkyries and unfortunately it doesn&#39;t get as much air time. <br><br>There is also a load of modern classical music that I am not as familiar with yet, despite my best attempts to become acquainted with it when I am back west. So many pieces, so little time...! Maybe we should start a music thread? Okay, vanishing back into the ether~</p>

Also, I could still use as many sources as you guys can throw at me. If you see a sentence without a source and you know where to find one, I want it!<br><br>Also, please let me know what you think about the content in general. Does it flow well? Does it make sense? Does it accurately express the views of this community? I had a few people tell me they liked it and a few suggestions the last time, which is good, but good is not good enough. I really need to know if the community by and large supports this version before I replace the content of the actual page, <i>especially</i> if you think it could be better in any way, shape, or form. Oldbie, newbie, or middlebie, love it or hate it, I want to hear from you about this. Feedback from only a few people, as awesome as they are, about something as fundamental as how we talk about Mary Sues makes me very nervous.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I suck at giving feedback, but I agree that, the more people voice their opinion about this, the better, so here I finally go.<br>All of the below is my subjective opinion. I do not claim to speak for anyone but myself or to be in anyway &quot;right&quot;.<br>Also, if any of the below comes of as snooty, arrogant, insulting or anything else, it was not my intent and I was not aware of it. It is only meant to be helpful suggestions. (Giving feedback makes me paranoid.)<br><br>This article draft is really good and I am very happy with the content. My favourite addition is the division between primary and secondary traits. It just cleared up a lot of things for me, that I had been dimly aware of, but unable to put into words.<br><br>Hopefully constructive criticism:<br>In terms of flow, I think it would be better if &#39;Related terms&#39; and &#39;Controversy&#39; got pushed back to after &#39;Mary Sue as a Character&#39;. I agree with Sedri (disclaimer: at least I think I agree with her; she might have meant something very different) that the article should not start out with what-Sues-are-not (the Controversy) and related-to-but-not-quite-Sue (Related terms).<br>Also, most pages on wikipedia that has one or both of these two categories has them after the main definition, so having them at the top, looks slightly odd to me.<br><br>I also agree with Sedri (see disclaimer) that the tone is on the defensive side. I think rearranging the content might do a lot to clear that up.<br><br>The only specific example of defensive wording I have is the opening. &quot;This article discusses the term Mary Sue as used by the PPC. Other people may use other definitions, but we&#39;ve worked hard on ours, so we think we&#39;ll keep it. We&#39;ll endeavor to explain what it is and why here.&quot;<br>I know that most of it is from the old page, but it still rubs me the wrong way.<br>&quot;discussing the term&quot; should IMO be saved for the talk-page and the board (like now); the wiki-article should be strictly for the current agreed-upon definition.<br><br>I would like the opening to be simpler and more assertive, along the lines of: &quot;This is the definition of the term Mary Sue, as it is understodd and used by the majority of the PPC&quot;, leaving out the bit about how other people might have different definitions, and also the bit about endeavoring to explaing, since I actually think the article does a really good job at explaining it.<br><br>So, like I said, I really think this is a good article-draft and those two suggestions are the only things I would like to see changed. Thumbs up!</p>

            <p>Yeah, I&#39;m definitely seeing that I&#39;ve got things out of order. I think you&#39;re right about the opening, too.

            <p>...a note about how Sue traits don&#39;t necessarily make a character automatically a Sue.<br><br>I was talking about this in the chat and mentioned Sherlock Holmes as an example: He&#39;s superintelligent and extremely perceptive, but also a flawed human being. If the exact same character with the exact same traits were written badly, he would be a Stu--the &quot;brooding, emotionally cold loner who nevertheless solves cases with almost psychic precision and wins the respect of all of London&quot;, and Watson would have been turned into a zombie whose entire purpose was to praise Holmes, rather than a fully real character.<br><br>But Holmes isn&#39;t a Stu, because he&#39;s well-written.<br><br>The Sue/Stu traits don&#39;t really make the Sue/Stu; it&#39;s how they&#39;re handled, how the writing is done. </p>

            <p>Under Secondary Traits: &quot;Some traits are commonly associated with Mary Sues without in and of themselves causing a character to be a Mary Sue.

            <p>I feel like the definition could be a little more direct. The &quot;fictional character&quot; part is necessary right up front, but I think we should move where Mary Sue is found to the end of the first paragraph. <br><br>Second, I think it&#39;s important to note the role that wish-fulfillment plays in creating the Mary Sue. I mean, that&#39;s the main reason that any Mary Sue exists. <br><br>Third, I also think we need to say that Mary Sue lacks significant character flaws while usually sporting out-of-proportion abilities. <br><br>I would write it this way:<br><br><font color="navy">A Mary Sue is a fictional character that achieves its goals in the story with minimal effort, out of proportion to what the audience would expect given the setting(s), culture(s), and other inhabitants of that universe. In order to accomplish this, a Mary Sue will have character traits heavily skewed in favor of outstanding abilities vs. significant flaws. The primary reason for Mary Sue&#39;s existence is wish-fulfillment for the Mary Sue author. This character type is mostly associated with fanfiction, though it can be found in original fiction as well.</font><br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m deliberately trying to get away from defining the character in terms of the author, so I don&#39;t want to say anything about wish-fulfillment. The purpose of the character&#39;s creation doesn&#39;t have anything to do with how it looks on paper one way or another—they were also created to be likeable and awesome, after all. A better place for that kind of observation might be in the page about Suethors.<br><br>On the other hand, I do take the point about emphasizing the lack of flaws (though not necessarily outstanding abilities; a Sue can be a Sue without powers), and I like the paragraph much better the way you&#39;ve got it.

            <p>Overall? Very good. You&#39;ve summed up all the major points  neatly and efficiently, leaving little or no room for error. Aster has several good points, though, and I&#39;ll add that you might want to make some references to Sues in non-fantasy worlds.<br><br>What strikes me most is how very legal it all sounds. Very defensive. The tone is markedly different from the rest of the wiki - which is understandable, but also makes it more obvious that you/we are trying to be very careful here. And it is obvious. The first thousand words are more about what a Sue is <i>not</i> than what a Sue <i>is</i>, and the original point of having this article is to define the term &quot;Mary Sue&quot;, not defend said definition. <br><br>I think you need to do a bit of rearranging; maybe try making a more thorough general definition first and then doing the &quot;but not THAT&quot; bits - so, the &quot;Mary Sue as a Character&quot; section should, I think, start it off. After a brief introduction, yes.<br><br>The &quot;Why Hate Mary Sue&quot; section is also <i>extremely</i> defensive. I understand why, certainly, but can&#39;t it be toned down? Can you start with the positives (i.e. the third paragraph) rather than the negatives and defensiveness?<br><br><br>Also, a few very technical things:<br><br>* I don&#39;t know if we have a standard style about such things, but as the following words are being singled out <i>as</i> words, I think they should be in quotation marks:<br><i>also referred to as <b>Sues</b> for short<br> eschewed the term <b>Mary Sue</b></i><br><br>* Technical tweak with this line: &quot;Other people admired it, and so, being generous, they invited the others&quot; - your referential function for &quot;they&quot; is ambiguous, and the first impression is that it IS the &quot;other people&quot; who did the inviting. Maybe &quot;and so, because this someone is so generous, they invited these others&quot; ?<br><br><br>Is that helpful?</p>

            <p>I agree that sounding overly defensive is a bad idea; I&#39;m not sure I can necessarily spot where I&#39;m doing it on my own, though.<br><br>I&#39;m not quite sure where it says &quot;but not THAT,&quot; except in the Controversy section. I think that bit is necessarily somewhat defensive, and I&#39;m not sure where else to put it. My idea was to lay out the groundwork for how and why we use the term and where it came from first, to make understanding the rest of the article easier for a newcomer. That said, a non-PPCer friend of mine told me he didn&#39;t really get it until the &quot;As a Character&quot; section anyway, because of the examples, so maybe that is the wrong approach. Hmm. What would you keep in an introductory section, and what not?<br><br>Where the tone is concerned, could you give me some more specific examples to work from? In the &quot;Why Hate Mary Sue&quot; bit, is it just the first paragraph that&#39;s the issue, or are there other spots? I added the first paragraph later than the rest of it, at the suggestion of the same non-PPCer friend who thought that it might be good to reinforce that we&#39;re not talking about authors there, but if there&#39;s a better way I&#39;m all for it.<br><br>As for references, I&#39;m kind of limited by what I can think of/find myself, so I&#39;d love some links to non-fantasy Sues if you&#39;ve got &#39;em.<br><br>Thanks for the technical catches, I can definitely fix those.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>the only thing I find left unmentioned is that Sues not only often warp the canon universe, but display a vital lack of understanding for the real world as well. It doesn&#39;t take any warping of Arda for a Mary Sue to make use of badly-misunderstood &#39;Stockholm Syndrome,&#39; nor does it take any canon disruption for a character to claim she can backflip off a giant ogre simply because she knows &#39;karate.&#39; Or to somehow gallop across Middle Earth in the space of two hours on an otherwise normal horse.<br><br>Another thing to add is that for whatever reason, many Sues tend to become (probably unintentionally) creepy and inhuman. So many of them become utterly obsessive or disturbing in their romance, or trivializing of violence to the point of being creepy walking bloodbaths that don&#39;t realize they&#39;re career mass murderers, or even unnervingly neglectful to the world outside themselves... such as being willing to doom everybody else just so they can get a day in the limelight.<br><br>Neither of these are primary Sue traits but they certainly are things I see a lot of PPCers criticize Sues for displaying. Your call on if they&#39;re important to add or not, though. Your writing is more than suitable as it is. Really, it&#39;s a vast improvement.<br><br>I was thinking, once this is out of the sandbox, taking a crack at beginning to re-do the &#39;FAQ: For Other People&#39; that was in dispute myself.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re right about that; I couldn&#39;t quite think how to work those kinds of things in initially, and it&#39;s still giving me some trouble. I&#39;m not quite sure how to classify things like that. The secondary traits I included are all deliberately assigned to the Sue; these aren&#39;t necessarily. Are they traits, do you think, or more like side effects? Tertiary traits, maybe? I considered a section like that early on, but couldn&#39;t figure out how to talk about them without getting more into bad writing than Sues. I&#39;ll give it more thought, though, and I welcome any more ideas you have.<br><br>I&#39;d leave the FAQ to Araeph, unless she says otherwise.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Hope you don&#39;t mind a newbie&#39;s opinion on this...<br>I think that this is a very good improvement over the old Mary-Sue page. The term is well explained and the &quot;controversy&quot; sub-section is a welcome addition. The &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary traits&quot; sub-sections give good examples to what constitutes a Sue. I also feel that it&#39;s important that we specify that we&#39;re not mocking the authors: we&#39;re not trying to offend anybody here.</p>

<li>One of the most comforting things I&#39;ve seen on a roasted fic was the roaster leave numerous criticisms and jokes - but then contact the author and mention that although they&#39;d enjoyed wading through their material, they meant no offense and hoped they&#39;d keep writing; everyone has things to work through, after all. The badfic!author wrote back, and not only found it funny but worked on some of the problems mentioned. All, as they say, was golden~! <br><br>It seems like a pretty good revision, though - I&#39;d trim down the &#39;Why Hate Mary Sue?&#39; section, although I found it&#39;s reasoning very (very) {very} solid. The audience can draw from the traits described that a character who falls into Suedom is more like a construct than a character, and hopefully will come to their own conclusions with the information provided.</li>

            <p>Welcome aBoard! Nice to meet you, I&#39;m Rosie! Here, have a Pidgin! *Hands you a leathery, black-and-gray bird* They work as rudimentary backup translators, messengers, and spawns of Satan. I brought a few back from a mission a while ago, and they&#39;ve taken up residence in my RC. In fact, here, have a few! *hands you a crate of Pidgins*<br><br>Anyway, don&#39;t forget to drop your sanity in the conveniently placed bin by the door (You won&#39;t need it here), read Da Rules, the Original Series, and a few Spinnoffs to get a feel for us! Also, pop into the chatroom every once in a while! We like Newbs in there! <br><br>So! Who is(are) your favourite Doctor(s) and Companion(s)?</p>

            <p>So yes, I have a few about the general workings of HQ and missions in general.<br><br>Firstly, I may create an Intelligence Agent sometime in the future. What format should a Intelligence mission follow? Should it mimic Architeuthis&#39; style or is it like Agent Aster&#39;s recent mission in Ferelden? I&#39;ve read the Rules of Gathering Intelligence but now I&#39;m unsure whether a DoI operative should return to HQ or go after the Sue. <br><br>Secondly, can animals talk? Alice the horse seems to be able to but is it due to some sort of universal translator thingy? DoSAT technology? Plot device?<br><br>Finally, do weapons for assassinations always have to be consistent with the cannon being cleansed? I remember somebody brought a Bren gun and rocket launchers to the sporking of Littlefoot X Cera, so how does that work out? <br><br>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Man, I hope this gets seen...<br><br>Another two questions for you folks:<br><br>Firstly, do Spies have SEP fields? When reading one of Architeuthis&#39; reports, it is implied that Assassins are completely invisible to canon characters so long as they don&#39;t do something dramatic (because of their SEP field, I presume) while Spies need to be a lot more careful with disguises. I&#39;d like to play with the idea of a Spy always having to fiddle with a DORKS to avoid detection due to a weak/nonexistent SEP field. Can I do that?<br><br>Secondly, what constitutes a badfic ripe for sporking? I can identify &#39;Sues, bad SPaG and OOCness from several kilometers away, but what separates a simply mediocre fic from something PPCable? Unintentional humour? Horrendous characterization? Something that is just so wrong it can&#39;t be ignored? I&#39;ve got my eyes on a potential Zelda badfic but I can&#39;t determine if it&#39;s something that deserves attention or not...<br><br></p>

            <p>1) Intelligence and how things should be done with reports/missions for that <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_Intelligence/Reports">can be found here.</a> Please note, that it is slightly different from the format found with Archy&#39;s spinoff, but if you want to do either way, you&#39;re welcome to do so once you have <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">permission</a>. Aster&#39;s mission is in no way representative of how Intelligence missions should done because you&#39;re not there to kill or do anything, just to observe, decide if badfic or not, and then report back. <br><br>Think of it basically as an analysis sort of thing.<br><br><br>2) Alice can talk because she started off talking. Normal animals from our world do not talk. Talking Animals are from those canons that have them, and do not represent the average animal. <br><br>3) Weapons for assassination should be consistent with the canon, and in cases where that is impossible or difficult, it should be ensured that nothing uncanonical is left behind. The case with Littlefoot X  Cera is that weapons are not canonical at all in that canon, and dinosaurs are quite large and difficult to kill with yon average pointy sharp metal stick. <br><br>Additionally, more to others as a reminder, if you have any questions to ask, ask them here instead of starting a new thread if this is still nearer the top. We&#39;ll see it still, promise.</p>

            <p>DON&#39;T COPY Agent Aster. Agent Aster set out to do intelligence, but she actually failed at it, which many people remarked on in the comments. This was actually kind of intentional, but I fudged the context a little and cut a bit too much, so it looks like it ended on a happy ending. My bad-- everybody&#39;s improving all the time. &gt;n&gt;<br><br>In her &#39;next&#39; mission (the next one I&#39;m writing actually happens BEFORE the Ferelden mission) she actually is still in trouble because she screwed up. <br><br>Really, I would suggest making up your own way of doing it so long as it doesn&#39;t step over what&#39;s already been established. The only hard and fast rules in PPC spin offs mostly have to do with &#39;don&#39;t make any facts that cause somebody else&#39;s spin-off to be wrong.&#39; Such as, you can&#39;t make up canon that makes other people&#39;s approaches suddenly be the &#39;wrong&#39; way to do it. Basically, just respect others and you should be fine.<br><br>Many creatures in HQ are weird or different from World One critters. I&#39;m not sure about Alice, but she was a badfic character, and her depiction seemed to be intelligent, I think. I think it might be a case of &#39;It works because it does.&#39; Really, there&#39;s no rules as long as it doesn&#39;t eclipse the story.<br><br>Weapons preferably SHOULD be along the lines of the canon an agent brings them into, because leaving them behind in case of emergency should be safe. It&#39;s also harder to blend in with non-canon weaponry. However, if non-canon weaponry is concealable or if other circumstances exist, I suppose you could sneak them in if nobody noticed. Once again, no hard or fast rules. Just common-sense ones. How weird would agents disguised as orcs carrying around lightsabers be?</p>

            <p>Okay, that clears up some things. One other question: should somebody (Sue or Agent) use a firearm in a continuum that doesn&#39;t have guns, do lost bullets and cartridges have to be cleaned up too? <br><br>Upon further thought that would make a great Flower punishment though... sadistic AND necessary.

            <p>If you, for whatever reason, bring a gun to a continuum without them, and you, for whatever reason, use it, you would indeed have to clean up all stray bullets and cartridges. That&#39;s why they aren&#39;t recommended. <br><br>As for the Sues, well, usually the small stuff they create disappears when they die. I&#39;d figure that covers non-canonical bullets they may or may not have fired.</p>
