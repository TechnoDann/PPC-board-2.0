            <p>and he knew it. With three ‘Sues against one agent, things were looking dire. It didn’t help that they were all wielding blasters and the lone agent on the field was armed with a butter knife.  With apprehension, the agent attacked one of the Sues, but was cut to shreds by a hail of laser fire. “Okay, you got me,” Gaspard said as he dumped his cards on the table. “Some game, eh?”<br><br>The intern he was playing against, a 15-year old blonde girl named Sylvia, scooped the remaining PPC game cards into the central pile. “Yeah,” she replied, shuffling the deck. “That was a lucky hand I got though. If you had played Agent Entropy and had a Noble dragon active while Jaycacia was out, you might have lasted longer.”    <br><br>“I’ll be sure to do that next time,” Gaspard said as he observed the rest of the party. “Jeez, how long does it take to go out and get some chocolates? It’s been ten minutes since we sent Philip and Ben on the snack run.” He took the closest edible looking thing and put it in his mouth. He promptly spat it out. “Ouache! Qu’est-ce que c’est que ça?” he exclaimed. A piece of chocolate-covered clam lay on the floor. “Someone has some really...odd tastes here.” <br><br>“You don’t say,” said Sylvia as she took a swig of hot chocolate. “Oh look, here they come and... what.”<br>Gaspard swivelled in his seat and watched as two other interns, Philip and Ben, struggled to haul a heaping plate of various chocolate-covered goods over to the table. The boys dropped the plate onto the table with a sharp CLACK!<br><br>“Feast on this,” said Ben as he seated himself and grabbed several chocolate-covered cheese balls. “Had a hard enough time trying to get this over here, people kept grabbing stuff off the plate. Must of thought we were waiters or something.” <br><br>“Are you sure this is good to eat? It looks... questionable,” muttered Gaspard as he inspected a chocolate-covered crab leg he found on a chocolate-covered tuna. “Is there a new seafood theme I’m not aware of?” <br><br>“Dunno but chocolate is chocolate is chocolate. I’m not complaining,” spat Philip through a mouthful of choco-snail. <br><br>“I’m not so hungry anymore,” said Gaspard as he pushed the plate away from him.<br></p>

            <p>Natasha nodded, &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t really like parties all that much either. Too much going on at once. The only reason I actually came was because Sylvia wanted to go and ,well, I um, I didn&#39;t want to be alone in the RC.&quot;<br><br>Sylvia, who was still wandering around and taking everything in, stopped at the brightly decorated Christmas tree. Smiling, she began to examine one of the ornaments, turning it around in her hands. Sylvia was very tempted to take the shiny sphere, but this being the PPC, she didn&#39;t know whether it would explode if she did. </p>

I wrote it when I was... ten? I then posted it much later, about last year. last year. Sadly, I had not learned how to write goodfic back then.

            <p>Yes, you can call badfics, even if you don&#39;t have permission. To claim a badfic, simply add it to this list on the Wiki:<br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Claimed_Badfic"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Claimed_Badfic">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Claimed_Badfic</a></a><br><br>Also, you&#39;ll need to find badfic that you plan on using for your first mission for when you ask for permission anyway, so it&#39;s always nice that you&#39;re thinking about that now.<br><br>As for sporking your fic... Well, we&#39;ll have to see. I don&#39;t know the Naruto fandom that much, but if someone else does, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be more than happy to spork it.</p>

            <p>Hei all! I&#39;m new here, though I&#39;ve been reading PPC stories for a couple of years now. I&#39;ve been considering joining for a while now, so, here I am!<br><br>I write a lot, mostly to keep track of the conversations I have with the voices in my head. For imaginary people they are pretty interesting XD. I&#39;m a lover of all things Mythological and Fantastic. I&#39;m also a history nerd, a troper, and I like to pretend to be an artist. I say &quot;pretend&quot; because I&#39;m not all the sure how great I really am at drawing. <br><br>Favorite Fandoms are: LoTR/Silmarillon, Doctor Who, Discworld, and Harry Potter.<br><br>I&#39;m also addicted to smilies and am actually pretty proud of myself that I made it through this entire post and only used one! <br><br>8D<br><br>...<br><br>Darn it! <br><br>So yeah, that&#39;s me.

            <p>For some reason, the Daleks don&#39;t like me asking for their tech secrets. In fact, I usually narrowly escape extermination when I do ask. So sad.<br>Oh well, I&#39;ll find one sooner or later. And considering what Nechtan seems to do with technology, I think I might be better off not getting one he&#39;s gotten at; you&#39;ve indicated that he messes with technology a lot and I&#39;d hate to be killed by a Dalek laser when the Daleks themselves failed. It&#39;d be a very sad end, like suffocating when someone duct-tapes your mouth when you have a nosebleed, or drowning in orange juice.</p>

            <p>If Bella were something resembling normal and viewed Edward&#39;s creepy stalker stuff as being creepy stalker stuff, then he&#39;d be showed up as the creepy stalker (sorry, I can&#39;t think of any alternative descriptions that wouldn&#39;t get me a warning) that he is. However, since she&#39;s subscribing to the whole &#39;stalking is twu wub and being a brainless sap that only exists for this one man is how one should be&#39; view, she&#39;s supporting Edward&#39;s actions, and thus reinforces the idea in the minds of a lot of the more young and impressionable fans that his actions are all right- after all, he&#39;s a protagonist and Bella didn&#39;t really object, did she?<br><br>Anyway, just wanted to say these last things- 1, if you took her love for Edward out of her character, Bella would have so little substance that she&#39;d dry up and float away, and 2, yeah, he&#39;s got uncontrollable bloodlust, but Rosalie and Emmett and Alice did, too, and they were a lot more normal than him. Edward&#39;s a self-pitying creep and Bella&#39;s an emotionally abusive git.<br><br>I honestly don&#39;t know where I was going with all of this. I think all the things I couldn&#39;t phrase properly earlier got together and decided to turn themselves into a Twilight rant.</p>

            <p>Is that because SMeyer thinks he&#39;s hot and has done her best to portray him as such, quite a few Twilight fans have followed her lead and now think that stalking and such is hot because it&#39;s &#39;true love&#39;.

So I get that you don&#39;t want anything &quot;big&quot; introduced, and I understand why.<br><br>Now, I had an idea for one of my Agents, and I was wondering if I would be able to use it or not. Either way it&#39;s fine and I could always change his history if I&#39;m not allowed to do what I had originally planned, but I figured I should ask.<br><br>So a couple of years ago I was reading through some of my older stories. I stumbled upon a really old one with an absolutely incredible sue for a Main Character. Having nothing better do, I sporked it PPC style.<br><br> Like I said in my introduction thread, I&#39;ve been reading PPC stories for a few years on and off and I liked the idea. Now, this being an original story, I made up my own organization for the spork: the Agency for the Elimination and Isolation of Mary-Sues, or AEIMS for short. They didn&#39;t kill Sues exactly, but instead sealed off Original Universes so that the Sue couldn&#39;t escape and spread her influence out through the rest of the Multiverse and do irreparable damage. Others could still enter and exit sealed off universes, just not the Sue.<br><br>I was thinking of using one of the Agents I&#39;d used in that spork and making him a PPC Agent. Like, his boss had a talk with the Flowers and transferred him over here. So would I be allowed to do this? If I am the only mention of his previous job in the stories would probably be in passing, not very big at all. Plus, I think it might add something when I send him off to do missions in Eragon fanfics (it is a guilty pleasure of mine) and he now has to defend something he once fought against.<br><br>Well, it was just an idea. I understand if you guys don&#39;t want me doing it, I just thought I didn&#39;t really have all that much to loose by asking.Like I said, it&#39;s okay if I&#39;m not. I&#39;ve featured the guy in a couple of other stories and if I can&#39;t use this idea I&#39;ll go with a history from one of those.</p>

            <p>So here they are, after a bit of revising. Obviously not looking for permission yet, but opinions would be nice :D<br><br><i><b><u>Agent Naiton:</u></b></i><br><b>Agent Name:</b> Naiton nepos Enfret<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Race:</b> Vampire<br><b>Original Continuum:</b> A One-shot MST I did of an old story of mine. <br><b>Object of Lust:</b> Thuringwethil (Well, that&#39;s what he&#39;s telling me...could be lying.) <br><br><b>Tell us about yourself:</b> Basically, The Director hates me.  Yep. That&#39;s how I ended up here. Oh...what&#39;s that? Haven&#39;t properly introduced myself yet? *tips hat* Agent Naiton nepos Enfret at your service. Former AEIMS agent, currently working for the PPC.<br><br>*sighs, rolls eyes* If you don&#39;t mind, would you please stop staring at the tattoos? Yes they cover my entire body. Long story short I&#39;m a Pict, so yes, that explains the accent as well. *flashes fangs* Nice, huh? Was a Glaisting what did me in. Not really something I talk &#39;bout though. Don&#39;t look at me like that! You wouldn&#39;t either if you got the reactions I did every-time you tell the story! Good Lord, you sleep with one blood-sucking goat-shapeshifter and suddenly you&#39;re marked for life! <br><br>Anyway how&#39;d I end up here? Used to work for another group, the Agency for the Elimination and Isolation of Mary-Sues.  We sealed off original fic universes so that Sueish influence doesn&#39;t cross over into other universes and break the Multiverse. <br><br>So yeah, the director of my former organization hated me. Don&#39;t ask me why, I&#39;m a perfectly personable  person once you get to know me! Sure I have my weaknesses: sadistic tendencies, a sarcastic attitude, a very, very, <i>very</i> low tolerance for stupidity. Maybe a bit of an ego... but don&#39;t we all have our flaws? Anyway,  don&#39;t listen to what the other agents&#39;ll tell you about the reason for my former boss hating me being evil robot armies. It&#39;s all lies. <br><br>There was also this thing with my partner, but again I don&#39;t talk about it. Seriously, what happened between me and Miss Mingan is my own business.<br><br>Anyway, the Director had a few talks with the guys over here. Apparently he decided this was a job I was “better suited for.” Apparently, he thought me too bloodthirsty for my own good. I&#39;d like to take this moment to point out, up to that point I had never killed a Sue in my life (though you have no idea how many times I came this close.), and his accusations are completely unfounded. So now I&#39;ve got a talking flower as my boss. *sigh* My life is really odd. Also I miss my Black Box. &#39;Least I&#39;ve still got my Tesla...<br><br>My New Partner, Miss Nolórë, is a bit of a thorn in my side. Haughty and proud as any Noldo could be expected to be. Also, she&#39;s just no fun. Won&#39;t let me near any of her cool toys and she complains about my music constantly! Not to mention how she just ignores my obvious flirting. Not that I like her or anything, I do that with most women. Mostly, I try to avoid her when I can. Either that or try to get on her nerves.<br><br>So yeah, anyway, If I&#39;m not on a mission you&#39;ll usually see me working on my computer or something. You know, making it better, I do that sort of thing. Techie stuff. Usually it&#39;s for the better, though there was that one incident with the killer toaster.... I don&#39;t really talk about it.<br><br>If I&#39;m not responding to you check my ears. Headphones are probably in and I can&#39;t hear you. Listen to a lot of different stuff, mostly metal, but not always. Favorite bands: Battlelore, Blind Guardian, Sonata Arctica, Hammerfall, Omnia.<br><br>Well, it&#39;s been a pleasure, now if you don&#39;t mind there&#39;s a robotized i-pod walking around somewhere with a laser and an urge to kill. Don&#39;t ask.<br><br><i><b><u>Agent Ataralassië:</u></b></i><br><b>Agent Name:</b>  Ataralassië Nolórë<br><b>Race:</b> Elf, Noldor.<br><b>Original Continuum:</b> LotR/the Silmarillion<br><b>Object of Lust:</b> She won&#39;t tell me!<br><br>*watches Naiton wander off. Shakes head.* He is more trouble than he is worth. Don <i>not</i> let him near anything you have a close attachment to.<br><br>So, you wish to know about me? What is there to say, really? I am a rather simple Nissi. I grew up in Tirion, of course. My family was in the service of the House of  Fëanor. I could tell you about my life up until the Rebellion of the Noldor and our return to Endórë, though I imagine you would get bored rather quickly, it is perfect in Aman after all and while perfection is a wonderful state to live in, it- unfortunately- makes for a very poor story.<br><br>But, I shall tell you a few things I suppose. I had two younger sisters who could not seem to go a day without causing some kind of trouble for me. Somehow though, I managed to put up with them. Ammë once said I had “unending patience.” Considering that I put up with Naiton on a day-to-day basis, I am rather inclined to agree. I spent my free time either exploring and wandering or buried up to by neck in old lore books. I have always been a seeker of knowledge.<br><br>The Kinslaying. *sigh* The acts committed there are deeds that still haunt me. They are the one thing I will not speak of.  I can still hear their cries sometimes, and at night, visions of that bloodshed still haunt me. Does it effect me when dealing with Sues? No more than dealing with an orc, perhaps even less. You cannot hesitate when dealing with such creatures. Though they wear the mask of a Child of Ilúvatar (usually), they are worse than the foulest demons of Morgoth.<br><br>So no, I do not let it effect me. I try not to at least. Naiton says I act cold sometimes. I respond by telling Naiton that he acts like an idiot sometimes. It all balances out in the end.<br><br>Shall we talk of something else now? Please?  What is that you say? You wish to know how I came to be here? Very well then. Though you must promise not to laugh, you might aggravate that pride we Noldor are known for and then who knows what might happen? *is only joking...mostly...*<br><br> Now, we all know of the plot-holes and such that began to appear in Arda after the release of the Lord of the Rings movies? The fictions made by some of those authors warped the fabric of Eä so much that it created plot-holes back as far as the First Age.<br><br>I fell into one. Quite literally! I was was walking along and I er...just fell into it. Admittedly, I have always been rather absentminded. I do not really pay as much attention as I should to my surroundings.  When I came out of the other side of the plot-hole I ended up here.<br><br>I wonder sometimes if it isn&#39;t the result of the Doom of the North. “On the House of Fëanor, The wrath of the Valar lieth from the West unto the uttermost East, <b>and upon all that will follow them it shall be laid also.</b>”  and let&#39;s not forget this line: “To evil end shall all things turn that they begin well.”<br><br>Making Naiton my partner is most certainly an “evil end.” I am also considered one of the unluckiest Agents in this place.  Shall we get into how many times I have nearly been shot, run over, hexed, Sued, and, in one instance, pushed into a Volcano? I do believe they are running bets over what turn my fate will take next.<br><br>*Shakes head.* Well, is that all? I- *hears a crash. Turns around. Face suddenly turns to a mask of rage.*<br><br>Enfret! What are you doing with my bow? *grabs sword and stalks off to the other room, where Naiton is.* <i>What did I say about touching my things?</i></p>

            <p>Except mine is a group of OCs and bit characters, called the EEC (Exterminators of the Enemies of Canon) that actually do go around killing Sues, but who accidentally mess up the canon even more in the process. I was planning on broaching the subject soon anyway... Based on the general reaction to yours, I think I&#39;m okay introducing it, but official word on the subject would still be appreciated.<br>Me personally, I like the idea of AEIMS (although I&#39;d imagine that they have a little less to do than the PPC; it&#39;s easier to Sue a canon universe than to make up an entirely new one to Sue). However, being new and not in any way official, you shouldn&#39;t take my word as PPC gospel.<br>Unless I&#39;m quoting the Wiki, anyway. XD</p>

            <p>Do you mean you&#39;d be bringing the whole group in, or just that your agents would be transferring from them? If the latter, what about the rest of them, who are still running around messing up canon in the meantime? That sounds like trouble—which could make an interesting story, dealing with it, but I don&#39;t think the PPC would be comfortable with the idea of just leaving them to it if they&#39;re damaging canon. They might qualify for removal, like any other badfic.<br><br>On the other hand, starting off with a group of agents isn&#39;t generally recommended, either. If that&#39;s the case, how many, and what would you do with them?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>My agents aren&#39;t actually going to be from the EEC; they&#39;ll actually be the first to encounter them. I didn&#39;t state that very clearly, so I apologize. <br>And yes, the PPC won&#39;t stand for that, but on the other hand, their skill levels, for the most part, hover around those of the average PPC Agent. So it won&#39;t be a piece of cake dealing with them; while it won&#39;t be a full-blown Emergency, it might require a couple of Agents (Agent crossover opportunity if anyone happens to be interested) from the Department of Implausible Crossovers to let my agents know who they&#39;re dealing with. In other words, more of an overarching plotline to help vary the Suefics after a while. <br>In all actuality, the EEC would be recently formed story-wise, and as such, the PPC would have a significant numerical advantage for a while. Along those same lines, not every Suefic would be interfered with; several chapters would remain as relatively normal Suefics (albeit a little tenser since they&#39;re keeping an eye out for more uncanon than usual).<br>So there lie the checks and balances I put into place to keep the EEC interesting, but not even close to a full-blown emergency. If you see a hole in them, by all means tell me.</p>

            <p>I like this idea. Seeing the PPC run after some inept well-wishers is a fantastic idea: think of all the comedy fuel that can come out of that... <br><br>One thing though: wouldn&#39;t talks between the PPC and the EEC solve the problem posed by the incompetent agents?

            <p>I mean, there are other organizations that are dedicated to sporking badfic out on the web, like the Anti-Cliché and Mary-Sue Extermination Society. The PPC is aware of the ACMSES&#39; existence (I think) but so far, there have been no crossovers between the two.

            <p>Just looked over your character profile and I have a few comments on him. I&#39;m not bashing him or anything, just offering my own, honest opinion. Feel free to take heed of it or ignore it as you see fit. <br><br>Several traits are dangerously close to being &quot;speshul&quot; for my liking: <br><br>1)  His Director reprimanded him for being arrogant and refusing to comply to orders. Nechtan brushes this off and asserts his intellectual superiority compared to his employers. Doing this to your boss in real life will have some serious consequences, and may indicate some sort of over-inflated ego. The general feeling I get from your agent&#39;s speech is that of nonchalance and disrespect: not good traits if you plan on getting hired anywhere.<br><br>2)  His cat-on-the-keyboard name. Dismiss this point if this is normal in his home &#39;verse. <br><br>3)  States that the Sues he faced are worse than what the PPC has encountered. In my opinion, a Sue is a Sue. They&#39;re all bad. Additionally, the role of the PPC is to protect canon &#39;verses from exterior Sues and to leave any Canon Sues alone. I&#39;d consider removing Sues from original fiction verses more of a revising job than a sporking.<br><br>4)  Flirts with a girl he doesn&#39;t even like and claims to be a Casanova. I&#39;d say to be very careful with this personality trait.<br><br>Of course, if your character has good characterization and receives plausible explanations for all of these traits, consider my points null and void.</p>

            <p>don&#39;t worry about me thinking your bashing him, criticism is good it makes for better writing in the long run.<br><br>In response to your comments: <br><br>1)I was kind of going for him having a bit of an over-inflated ego actually. If you think I should tone it down a bit though I can.<br><br>2)I&#39;m a history nerd and Nechtan is a Pict. He was born in 6th century Scotland and was named according to the naming conventions of his people (I went on an SCA naming website and everything to get a historically accurate name). His first name is Pictish, but I could move it up a few centuries and change it to &quot;Naiton&quot; if that makes it more easily pronounceable. His byname, &quot;nepos Enfret&quot; means &quot;nephew of Enfret.&quot; It is a uniquely Pictish naming pattern, as inheritance passed through the mother&#39;s side of the family in pictish culture but they were named for the males in their family. His mother was Anglish, so that explains the name &quot;Enfret&quot; which is Anglo-Saxon, not Pictish.<br><br>TL;DR: I&#39;m a nerd who put too much thought into making Nechtan&#39;s name is historically accurate. Another form of the name would be &quot;Naiton nepos Enfret,&quot; and if that is even marginally easier to figure out how to pronounce I&#39;m willing to change it.<br><br>3)He never &quot;removed&quot; any Sues. He did reconnaissance work to figure out if an area was in fact effected by a Sue, and if it was, that Universe was sealed off so the Sue couldn&#39;t wreak havoc in other universes. Also, don&#39;t believe everything he says. When he&#39;s saying Canon sues are worse that&#39;s pretty much his ego talking. Again, I&#39;m willing to tone it down if he&#39;s too much.<br><br>4)He <i>claims</i> not to like her. Also, he said he was a flirt, never said he was a successful flirt ;). I can see the problems that could arise if this trait is taken to far though, and will be careful with it.</p>

            <p>Step right up and give your favorite holiday song a new coat of PPC-themed paint! Or heck, even make your most hated holiday nemesis more bearable!<br><br>There are pretty much no rules to this. You don&#39;t need permission, you can use whatever song you like, even if it&#39;s already been done before, and I&#39;ll add the lot to the <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/songbook/">PPC Holiday Songbook</a> (unless you don&#39;t want me to for some reason).<br><br>I&#39;ll offer up the same challenge as last year, or possibly the year before... hm. Anyway: it&#39;s good fun to write carols about Sue-slaying, but there are lots of those. My challenge is to pick a different theme. If the filkbunnies have other ideas, though, that&#39;s cool. {= )<br><br>I have two offerings to get us started. The first is yet another version of &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas,&quot; inspired by certain activity on the Board before the Thanksgiving holiday:<br><br><b>&quot;The Twelve Days of Spamming&quot; by Neshomeh and Phobos</b><br>Sung to the tune of &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;<br><br>On the first day of spamming, the spammers gave to me:<br>Some pics of a Ypur stampede!<br><br>On the second day of spamming, the spammers gave to me:<br>Two shady links,<br>And some pics of a Ypur stampede!<br><br>On the third day of spamming, the spammers gave to me:<br>Three word-salads,<br>Two shady links,<br>And some pics of a Ypur stampede!<br><br>On the fourth day of spamming, the spammers gave to me:<br>Four stolen names,<br>Three word-salads,<br>Two shady links,<br>And some pics of a Ypur stampede!<br><br>On the fifth day of spamming, the spammers gave to me:<br>Five fake IPs!<br>Four stolen names,<br>Three word-salads,<br>Two shady links,<br>And some pics of a Ypur stampede!<br><br>On the sixth day of spamming, the spammers gave to me:<br>Six bogus data,<br>Five fake IPs!<br>Four stolen names,<br>Three word-salads,<br>Two shady links,<br>And some pics of a Ypur stampede!<br><br>On the seventh day of spamming, the spammers gave to me:<br>Seven Mickeys *censored*,<br>Six bogus data,<br>Five fake IPs!<br>Four stolen names,<br>Three word-salads,<br>Two shady links,<br>And some pics of a Ypur stampede!<br><br>On the eighth day of spamming, the spammers gave to me:<br>Eight ads for Cialis,<br>Seven Mickeys *censored*,<br>Six bogus data,<br>Five fake IPs!<br>Four stolen names,<br>Three word-salads,<br>Two shady links,<br>And some pics of a Ypur stampede!<br><br>On the ninth day of spamming, the spammers gave to me:<br>Nine accusations,<br>Eight ads for Cialis,<br>Seven Mickeys *censored*,<br>Six bogus data,<br>Five fake IPs!<br>Four stolen names,<br>Three word-salads,<br>Two shady links,<br>And some pics of a Ypur stampede!<br><br>On the tenth day of spamming, the spammers gave to me:<br>Ten banhammers swinging,<br>Nine accusations,<br>Eight ads for Cialis,<br>Seven Mickeys *censored*,<br>Six bogus data,<br>Five fake IPs!<br>Four stolen names,<br>Three word-salads,<br>Two shady links,<br>And some pics of a Ypur stampede!<br><br>On the eleventh day of spamming, the spammers gave to me:<br>An eleven-year-old schoolboy,<br>Ten banhammers swinging,<br>Nine accusations,<br>Eight ads for Cialis,<br>Seven Mickeys *censored*,<br>Six bogus data,<br>Five fake IPs!<br>Four stolen names,<br>Three word-salads,<br>Two shady links,<br>And some pics of a Ypur stampede!<br><br>On the twelfth day of spamming, the spammers gave to me:<br>Twelve spelling errors,<br>An eleven-year-old schoolboy,<br>Ten banhammers swinging,<br>Nine accusations,<br>Eight ads for Cialis,<br>Seven Mickeys *censored*,<br>Six bogus data,<br>Five fake IPs!<br>Four stolen names,<br>Three word-salads,<br>Two shady links,<br>And some pics of a Ypur stampede!<br><br>(If you remember all the individual events we&#39;re referring to, you&#39;ve probably been here a while.)<br><br>Second, to completely change it up, this next one is an homage to DoDAEG based on a Chanukah song called &quot;S&#39;vivon.&quot; If you aren&#39;t familiar with it, you can see the lyrics and translation <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_holiday-lyrics-sevivon-dreidel_1746545.bc">here</a> and listen to the arrangement I&#39;ve sung before <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcUKo8JrRnY&amp;feature=related">here</a>.

            <p>Yeah, it&#39;s not that good, I had to beat some of the rhymes into line with a wrench.

            <p>I didn&#39;t realize until after posting that the reason the first verse in the original didn&#39;t rhyme was because I was used to hearing a mispronunciation. The first verse should therefore be more like:<br><br>The Sue&#39;s head in hand bear thee<br>Still dripping blood, and glittery<br>And I pray you, o agents, be merry . . . <br>(etcetera, etcetera)<br><br>I hope you do record a cover, though!

            <p>Regarding exigo/termino, I picked exigo because I meant it in terms of &quot;this ceremony I now complete,&quot; as in &quot;this thing I&#39;ve done.&quot; Does that make sense? Termino works too, though; I bow to the Latin expert. :D<br><br>I&#39;m not sure about reddens/redens. I&#39;ve always seen it written as redens--it may be part of the medieval Latin form, I don&#39;t know, or it could be just a common typo. Once again I defer to your judgment.</p>

            <p>1) If a fic that was in the process of being sporked was deleted and the sporker had a copy of the text, would it be necessary to reproduce the entire fic in a seperate document so readers have an idea as to what is occuring?<br><br>2)A major issue I have encountered in my LOTR-based sporking is that the charges are spread out across all three books/films on which this fic is based on. <br><br>With that in mind, is it possible to use Agent-created portals in order to skip unneccesary or repetative moments? Or can the entire operation be carried out on foot?<br><br>3) If the spork in question is going to be split up into three parts, I&#39;m interested in aquiring the services of a beta reader who can check to ensure I am sticking to LOTR canon and that the spork remains true to the spirit of the PPC&#39;s humour. Any recommendations?<br><br>Thanks for your time.</p>

<li>No, don&#39;t post the entire fic elsewhere. If the writer took it down, then it should stay down. Complete the mission, but note that it&#39;s a deleted fic.<br><br>2. Yes, jumping unnecessary and repetetive moments via Remote Activator (aka the &quot;portal thingy&quot;) is very popular with Agents. Skip to the chargeable bits and save your Agents&#39; sanity.<br><br>3. If it&#39;s a LOTR canon-beta you&#39;re looking for, I could do it. That&#39;s one of my most favoured fandoms.

            <p>Thankfully, these are all questions I&#39;ve dealt with before. So here we go...<br><br>1) Generally, it&#39;s seen as being in bad taste to reproduce a fanfic on the internet if it&#39;s been deleted. Trust me, I did it once, and it didn&#39;t really go over that well.<br><br>2) Yes. One of the great things about portals is that you can skip the less brain-killing moments and get to the meat of the action, and I think you&#39;ll find that some of us do it a lot.<br><br>3) I don&#39;t know if I can help you with a beta reader, but I know that July, Data, Nesh, Aster, or VM would be willing to help in this situation. Just ask around, and you should receive at some point.</p>

            <p>Natasha wasn&#39;t a very touchy-feel sort of person, and being hugged by someone who doesn&#39;t have any skin made the experience much more uncomfortable than it normally was for her.

            <p>I get a 22. But that&#39;s only if I don&#39;t pick the answers that reflect the fact that the character I&#39;m testing is myself--you know, same name, same taste in books, same career, that kind of thing. I gained some points for childhood trauma and being really good at school, looking younger than I am and being good at understanding animals. I wonder if I gained points for owning cats, or if it had to be an unusual pet?<br><br>If I added all the stuff that involved the character&#39;s similarity to me, it&#39;d probably score Uber-Sue.<br><br>It does make me think though. A true self-insert--a real person, written into a story, rather than an idealized version of the author--would still score as a Sue, even though if they hadn&#39;t been based on the writer, they would be a pretty realistic character.<br><br>And then there&#39;s my own &quot;borderline Sue&quot; status, even though I&#39;m a pretty average everyday kind of person. I think, maybe, it just comes from the way a real person is quite detailed and complex--more so than a fictional character. When you write a fictional character, you don&#39;t add every single detail about them, just the ones that are relevant. So, if I were a fictional character, the fact that I look younger than I am or won the school spelling bee mightn&#39;t even be mentioned, because it wouldn&#39;t be relevant. But, since I&#39;m not, I know all those little details, and some of them are Suvian traits.<br><br>Maybe part of writing a Sue is just giving the character too many traits, period. You give her a beautiful face even though her beauty isn&#39;t driving the story; you give her powers she never really uses; you make people love her even though it wouldn&#39;t matter to the plot whether they did. The character gets cluttered with traits that she doesn&#39;t need to have and that don&#39;t need to be mentioned.<br><br>Everything you write about a character should drive the story. For the Sue, that&#39;s the other way around--the story is just there to show off the Sue.</p>

            <p><i>Maybe part of writing a Sue is just giving the character too many traits, period. You give her a beautiful face even though her beauty isn&#39;t driving the story; you give her powers she never really uses; you make people love her even though it wouldn&#39;t matter to the plot whether they did. The character gets cluttered with traits that she doesn&#39;t need to have and that don&#39;t need to be mentioned.<br><br>Everything you write about a character should drive the story. For the Sue, that&#39;s the other way around--the story is just there to show off the Sue.</i><br><br>That&#39;s pretty much the definition of a Sue/Stu, as far as I&#39;m concerned. I might save this thingie-- it also has the benefit of touching on Mark Twain&#39;s rules of writing.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s always the difference between designing your characters and putting them into a story. While in your story you&#39;ll only disclose the information needed for the plot, in design, your character can have much more details than needed.<br><br>I always assumed that the mere existence of these traits counted, and now if they were described in-story. Many things inherently influence a character&#39;s personality and thus the way he or she acts, even if they&#39;re considered Suevian traits.</p>

            <p>In the RP, I was excited to see that Frédéric was in FicPsych, and I&#39;m glad that there will be a new nurse in the department. ^<em>^ I&#39;m curious about when exactly the family joined up, since <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/ficpsych/casefile02.html">this</a>, set in 2008, pretty much only contains characters that had names at the time. Did your guys join after that?<br><br>Also, feel free to put up a little bio of Frédéric &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FicPsych">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FicPsych</a></em>Personnel&quot;&gt;here</a>.<br><br>I&#39;m thinking of adding another section for each nurse&#39;s style (e.g., Mirrad is more spiritual, Elms kinda works like a barman or that good buddy you tell things over beer, Jenni gets into people&#39;s heads and pokes buttons, etc.), so I&#39;m curious about how he works, and how he&#39;ll get along with everyone else.<br><br>... I&#39;m super excited. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh, who hasn&#39;t seen a new FicPsych agent with a name and everything that wasn&#39;t hers since Nurse Barker, and his writer hasn&#39;t been around for a while.</p>

            <p>...but I guess everyone deserves good characterization, right? I was thinking of portraying Frédéric as a highly mechanical character: very clinical, one case at the time. His sessions would go something along the lines of see problem, establish solution, execute, reformulate if failed, repeat until successful. I&#39;d say he&#39;s a friendly guy but very absorbed in his work.<br><br>As for when the family moved into HQ, I&#39;d say they joined fairly recently, say several months ago.<br><br>I gotta start reading the &quot;How-to-Edit&quot; page.

            <p>You can use the Sandbox page to mess around and get a feel for things, and otherwise you can&#39;t go wrong with cutting and pasting code that does what you want done (if you&#39;re using the source view, that is—there&#39;s also a visual mode that&#39;s supposed to be more user-friendly, and you can switch between the two). Anyway, even if you make a mistake, it can always be fixed. {= )<br><br>... Frédéric is going to have an interesting time. {X D The first story ever set in FicPsych set the tone around there as pretty hectic, so I&#39;ve made my nurses an eccentric lot with about a teaspoon and a half of formal psychology training between them. I figure they&#39;re largely isolated from the rest of HQ, so they&#39;re pretty close and not afraid to say embarrassing things about each other in front of other people (who aren&#39;t patients). They have to keep each other sane as well as the rest of HQ, so they have a need to know these things. *g* They might initially give Frédéric a bit more space because he&#39;s older, though. His quarters are probably bigger than most of &#39;em, too, what with the family all moving in. Nurse Jenni will be jealous.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Sure, Freddie might be older, but he&#39;s just moved in from a very sane job from World One. He&#39;s bound to know less about the treatment of badfic-induced mental diseases and convincing traumatized Agents to go back out in the field) so he might need a while to learn the ropes before joining in the madness. <br><br>I&#39;m not very familiar with FicPsych or Medical but you seem to have the best grasp of what goes on in there.

            <p>Sample was interesting (though your format was a bit wonk near the end). <br><br>Beyond that, your additions to the RP running on the other board impressed me (and Neshomeh as well, though hopefully she doesn&#39;t mind me saying that) because you were working allusions to other things that were going on in to your posts, and gave indication that you had read up on stuff that was relevant to the background information in regards to the lounge, as well as the positions of your characters.<br><br>So, I&#39;m definitely going to be keeping an eye on you and what you do, given you definitely have a lot of potential for improvement on top of things that are already engaging and decently written.</p>

            <p>Something I have noticed in the PPC is a tendency to refer to Eragon as a Gary Stu. After having thought for some time on the subject, I can&#39;t say I agree. Granted, this is taken from the first three books, as I have not yet read Inheritance. If something in Inheritance contradicts something in this post, please just say that Inheritance contradicts one of my points and leave it at that.<br>According to the PPC wiki pages, Stu-traits include:<br>Being a combat diety and killing everyone in &quot;awesome&quot; ways. I have yet to see this with Eragon; sure, he&#39;s a good fighter, but he worked hard to get that way and it&#39;s only the average soldiers that he kills effortlessly. Major threats, like Murtagh and Galbatorix, are people that he still can&#39;t counter. <br>Being superior and always talking about it...well, see above. He&#39;s not superior, and thinking one is superior when one is actually not is called &quot;arrogance&quot; and is a legitimate trait.<br>Made-up weapons. Paolini did not make up the sword, or the bow and arrow. Or magic. Or for that matter, dragons.<br>Canon distortions. Not applicable for obvious reasons.<br>I imagine that this has been discussed before, but I&#39;m trying to understand why Eragon has been (somewhat) labeled as a Stu. If anyone can explain, I&#39;m all ears.</p>

            <p>I think, if you don&#39;t take the author&#39;s advice, you should at least take mine.  I have read - and anaylzed - the entire series up to Inheritance. ALSO I have a huge f&#39;ing Gary Stu as a character. (Agent Alec Troven, to be exact. He&#39;s the physical embodiment of Chaos for the entire multiverse, can manipulate reality at a whim and is unkillable. You can&#39;t really more &#39;stuy than that)<br><br>Now Gary Stus as some have said, aren&#39;t bad things, it&#39;s all a matter of how they&#39;re handled. Mercedes Lackey has a tendency to write Gary and Mary Sues. Anne McCaffery&#39;s Lessa and Menolly are definitely in the Sue category, to knock off a few names. <br><br>However the problem with Eragon is that he he is a Gary Stu and not a very good one at that. In that his Stu&#39;ness, his lack of empathy for others, his idea that he&#39;s the Judge and Jury of everything. We are supposed to accept that his actions are Good and Right. Even when they&#39;re heinous. I point to Sloan for a good example of that. <br><br>But really you can look at my analysis that I&#39;ve done (I think it was linked to earlier) for my proofs.</p>

            <p>As I see it (and this is my basis for the new definition on the Mary Sue page), the main thing that makes a Sue or Stu is that other characters don&#39;t react to the Stu in ways that make sense, and neither does the Stu behave in ways that make sense. &quot;Sense&quot; is relative, but it takes into consideration the reasonable expectations of the reader and the rules of the world set up by the author.<br><br>To use the swordsmanship example, if the rules were that anyone in Inheritanceverse could pick up a stick and learn to be a master swordsman in a couple of weeks, then it wouldn&#39;t be Stuish; however, not anyone can do that. Only Eragon can, because he is speshul. It&#39;s not really the <i>what</i> that make a Stuish trait (becoming a master swordsman), but the <i>how</i> (doing it in a ridiculously short time when no one either in the real world or the fictional one can do the same).<br><br>If Eragon had to work for his success, he wouldn&#39;t be a Stu; however, these things are all handed to him on a silver platter of plot contrivance. It makes him boring, as doctorlit noted, and it makes him a Stu.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I only read the first book because I found it really boring.  The setting was boringly generic, and most of the characters felt like vaguely-described fanfic characters.  Eragon is the most boring of all, and gets the most screen time, which is probably why he feels so Suish.</p>

            <p>Personally I did and do enjoy the Eragon books for one main reason.  I am easy to entertain and they weren&#39;t badly written.  What I mean is the wording, grammar, use, descriptions, and the actual world itself is actually fairly entertaining.<br><br>Yes I have ready many books far superior to the series, but its still enjoyable even if he is a Gary Stu.  Admittedly there is some excuse for how much stronger he is over the norm by dint of being a &quot;dragon rider&quot; who are supposed to be powerful due to their very nature, but just by being the last dragon rider, that is also a Stu trait, or so I think.  I could be wrong on that last.</p>

            <p>One of the last, yes, but not quite the last.<br>And being the last, I don&#39;t think, is in and of itself a Stu trait; no one seems to consider Martian Manhunter a Stu (I&#39;ll grant that Superman is a huge Stu, but Martian Manhunter&#39;s almost as powerful and no one ever seems to call him a Stu). Being the last does seem to boost a character&#39;s &quot;Stu-score&quot;, though, so that needs to be used carefully.<br>Also, it&#39;s inevitable that whoever the protagonist is, he or she will be special in some way. It keeps things interesting and provides a reason why that person is the main character and not someone else. In this case, I&#39;ll grant that he&#39;s more special than several other protagonists, but not, I don&#39;t think, enough to be a Stu.<br>Your other point, however, that it&#39;s decently-written, is another telling point. Most Sues and Stus are badly-written. The fact that Eragon isn&#39;t helps.</p>

            <p>Okay, first? Martian Manhunter is arguably <i>more</i> powerful than Superman. He has laser eyes, the flight, and he&#39;s just as strong, and on top of that he can shapeshift, is psychic, and can turn intangible. Then again, his weakness is far more common. As Batman says in Justice League: First Flight, &quot;I&#39;ve got a million-dollar rock for the one in Metropolis. All I need for you is a penny for a book of matches.&quot;<br><br>Secondly, power levels or being the &quot;sole survivor&quot; aren&#39;t what make Superman and J&#39;onn Stus or not Stus. It&#39;s how believable they are <i>in their setting</i>. Since Martian Manhunter is a less popular character, he is frequently downplayed, and thus is more believable in within the DCU. Usually Superman is as well, however since he&#39;s far more popular, he gets more screen-time, which means more time for writers to play around with him, and pull stuff like the Superman Red/Blue, or having him die then come back to life, or the <i>many</i> times he&#39;s been compared to Jesus, or how his powers seem to be &quot;Whatever he needs at that moment in time.&quot; When Superman is a Stu, it&#39;s a result of bad writing, just like any other character, however since there are many writer who have worked with him, there are just as many occasions where he&#39;s a well-balanced, interesting character. All it takes is the right writer.<br><br>Saying Superman is a huge Stu, without exception, is a little like saying that Sherlock Holmes is always a huge Stu, just because that how some authors writers write him, regardless of how the original author, or other good authors, have written him.</p>

            <p>But I&#39;ve never heard the Manhunter being called a Stu at all, which was the gist of my point. Probably because of the whole fire thing, as you said.<br>And I also get what you&#39;re saying about the writers, and it makes sense. Things that are annnoyingly Stu-like with one writer may be tolerable or even interesting with another. And that actually sheds a lot of light on the Eragon thing: Paolini may not be a good enough writer to pull off a good Stu completely.</p>

            <p>I do think that Eragon is a Stu, but I&#39;m of the opinion that, if well written, Stu&#39;s and Sue&#39;s can actually enhaance a storyline. Depressingly, these are very rare, but I suppose Eragon falls into this category.<br><br>Irrelevently, I tried to write an intentional Stu for a JuNoWriMo once. It failed epicly.

            <p>That skill with fighting? He learned it in days, if not hours. It has been some time since I read the first book. And only that. He also gained the full ability to read and write within an even shorter period of time.<br><br>The fact that only major threats are threats at all is a problem.<br><br>He starts off the story with no real ties, let alone concerns about what happens to the others, or what might occur. This is self centered behavior, and a common trait of a Sue or Stu.<br><br>Arrogance and self considered superiority is still a Stu/Sue trait. <br><br>The story is focused- to unfair and ludicrous degrees- on Eragon and his accomplishments, which are completely out of balanced with what should and ought be considered possible by a single character in his home verse. His accomplishments cannot be- and are not- duplicated by anyone else beyond the characters who have been, quite randomly, chosen to be his villains and opposites.<br><br>Reconsider the behavior and actions of Galbatorix- who, if I remember rightly, is the ruler. He keeps the land in a state of stability, and moderates it. Law is provided. Things are done to keep unlawlessness and what results from it to a minimum. In many considerations, he has the area kept in a state where he is indicating that his rule is a successful one. <br><br>We don&#39;t see anything that tells us he is an evil ruler. We are only told it to ensure that Eragon, as the hero, has a villain to fight against.<br><br>These are off the top of my head. I haven&#39;t read them for about eight years now, and not interested in doing so. If you like, I can link Kippur&#39;s excellent sporkings of the whole series which tells you exactly how it is one of the most terribly written and hackneyed stories and poorly made worlds of fantasy in this last decade. </p>

            <p>...then how do you expect to remember these things? For example, I clearly remember his fighting skills being picked up in a matter of weeks; I&#39;ll grant that it was fast, but it wasn&#39;t days.<br>I can&#39;t dispute the reading/writing thing, though. I consider that a minor point, however.<br>Well, the fact that major threats are the only threats is canonically accurate. You might as well say that all Jedi are Sues and Stus, because short of a surprise attack (which Eragon is also susceptible to, you may recall), the average Joe isn&#39;t a problem. Granted, you get the occasional Boba Fett or Jango Fett that can challenge a Jedi, but one can also see this in the Shades or the Ra&#39;zac in Eragon.<br>Why is arrogance so Stu-y? Unless he doesn&#39;t get a richly-deserved comeuppance, which I remember he did (remember what happened to Elva).<br>...any book is focused on the main character. You may recall that many of his &quot;accomplishments&quot; were done with help; he escaped from prison with assistance from Saphira and Murtagh, he killed the Ra&#39;zac with help from Roran, he killed Durza with a timely distraction by Arya and Saphira (otherwise, he was outmatched).<br>Galbatorix keeps the land stable, yes. Stable in the fact that his pet monsters roam the land doing what they please to the common man (see Urgals). Besides, it is often the evil that does not look evil right away that is the most dangerous.<br>Personally, I take the fact that I can coherently counter most of your points evidence that, even if he is a Stu, that he&#39;s not a horrible one.</p>

            <p>...doesn&#39;t make him not a Stu.<br><br>The sheer unoriginalness and outright stolen ideas scream &quot;STU! STU!&quot;<br><br>The plot is the original trilogy of Star Wars, with some Tolkien ideas thrown straight in (undiluted by time), the dragonrider concept and how it works stolen from Anne McCaffery&#39;s Pern series (who actually made a go at trying to sue him for it), with the magic style of Earthsea and none of the sense that Ursula LeGuin gave it. Individual items within the series, be they concept, character idea, or creature, or what else have you, can generally be pinpointed down to exactly creator/original story in a mix going back to the 1940s as far as modern fantasy goes.<br><br>Oh. Let&#39;s not forget the B5 allusion, or the inclusion of the Doctor in ways that make no sense whatsoever.<br><br>The Babylon 5 allusion is one a friend of mine caught: &#39;Eragon at one point says some idiotic thing about &quot;I stand between the candle and the dark.&quot;  The standard greeting of a member of the Grey Council of the Minbari (totally the elves) of Babylon 5: &quot;I am Grey. I stand between the candle and the star. We are Grey. We stand between the darkness and the light.&quot;&#39;<br><br>As to Doctor Who, to quote wikipedia: &#39;Paolini admitted he is a Doctor Who fan, which inspired his reference to the &quot;lonely god&quot; (the epithet given to the Doctor by the Face of Boe in the episode &quot;New Earth&quot;), to &quot;rooms that are bigger on the inside than the outside&quot; (from &quot;Questions Unanswered&quot; in Inheritance), as well as to Raxacoricofallapatorius, the home of the Doctor Who Slitheen (&quot;Blood Price&quot; in Inheritance).&#39; <br><br>That? That is utterly bad writing. Not because they&#39;re allusions, but because they are not clever. They are unsuited to his story and the whole world he has created. They are in for the sake of the cool factor, regardless of any sense they make in the setting or as things for characters to say or name things as. <br><br>There is nothing good about any of this. This isn&#39;t &#39;inspired by&#39; or &#39;influenced by&#39;. This is &#39;stolen from&#39;. If people cannot separate the idea and see it as being true to the story it is currently in,  and instead only see- immediately, often enough- that it is from some different other series, some other story, some other  creator, there is something wrong with the writing. You can&#39;t claim it as your own if people cannot see your touch to it, if they still see the poorly scribbled out name of the previous user of the idea somewhere on a tag attached to it.<br><br>This is what Stus and their stories do. They are derivative for the sake of being cool without anything making much more than an ill made patchwork  of sense.<br><br>The Eragon books <i>reek</i> of trying to cram all the cool ideas he came up with or wanted to use into a single set of books, with one cast. <br><br>Eragon himself is painfully, shallowly, derivative. <br><br>And, no. A book is focused on its cast of characters. Even when they are not the main character, they still have agency and other things to do. They should not be relegated into either being &#39;good&#39; and thus helping or needing help from the main characters regardless, or &#39;evil&#39; and thus not helping the main characters or actively working to be annoyances if they are not out-and-out bad guys/<br><br><a href="http://eragon-sporkings.wikispaces.com/eragon_sporkings_page">Again, here&#39;s the sporking of the series, by one of our own.</a><br><br>You can like Eragon, sure. You&#39;re allowed to have a guilty pleasure. It doesn&#39;t mean you have to defend it, say it isn&#39;t bad, say Eragon isn&#39;t much of a Stu though. Doing that is completely, utterly unnecessary because he is a Stu, and a very big one. </p>

            <p>...even if I don&#39;t agree with it, and I put this up to understand the other side, so I think that this was time well spent on my part.<br>Personally, I think that either I&#39;m relatively tolerant as a reader, or the people who see all the &quot;stolen&quot; materials are relatively strict, because I don&#39;t really see the use of several of these things as a problem. Heck, I didn&#39;t notice that the plot was related to Star Wars until someone else pointed it out to me (although that probably argues that I&#39;m too tolerant...or just unobservant). I also have difficulty seeing any outright stolen ideas from Tolkien, although I can see his influence.<br>I can&#39;t speak for Babylon 5 or Pern, having never seen/read them, but the Doctor fits anywhere. Except maybe My Little Pony or Winnie the Pooh, and I&#39;m sure someone could figure out a way to write the Doctor in there if they really wanted.<br>Also, I&#39;m not seeing the clear-cut good/evil that you&#39;re seeing. I&#39;m seeing several complex individuals all trying to achieve their own ends, which oftentimes clash with Eragon&#39;s ends.<br>Still, I think I get where you guys are coming from, and so I thank you all for clear summaries of your position.</p>

            <p>He somehow became better than Brom in the course of weeks fighting with sticks. I would like you to somehow become better than an actual sword fighting master in a few weeks, using sticks that aren&#39;t even analogous to how one would use a sword at all and claim that makes you actually good. Nowhere did I see him ever do drills, learn footwork, study technique... This is like saying he improves by LARPing for a few weeks against somebody with greater skill. It doesn&#39;t work that way.<br><br> And then he switched to actual swords. He sparred against his mentor with the actual weapon he would use to kill people like it was no big deal. Sure, Brom shielded the edge with magic, but he was still flailing around a heavy metal bar that 1) he is totally untrained in the use of, sticks discounted, 2) he does not know the weight of, or his own strength. He by all rights could break bones and seriously hurt a person. And his instructor is a so-called swordfighting expert? What kind of teacher would have completely NO knowledge about basic safety, or even that maybe Eragon should learn how to not hurt himself before he pretends his LARPing skills can serve him in an actual fight with dangerous steel weapons, sharp or otherwise?<br><br>My family reads buzz-books on principle, and is a fan of fantasy in general. So we all picked up a copy of Eragon and passed it down the line. My father, a blackbelt in aikido and quite proficient with the sword, threw down the book in disgust, absolutely mad that this kid had the gall to think he was good at any kind of martial art, when he&#39;d practiced for only a few weeks, utterly disregarded safety, his mentor acted with total lack of knowledge, and somehow was superhuman enough to become good enough to BEST that skilled mentor with only a few weeks of effort that shouldn&#39;t have taught him anything in the first place.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry. Eragon is bad. The way he treats learning new skills, the total lack of research, the sheer disregard and disrespect of those who actually had to spend time and effort developing said skills... he&#39;s bad. He&#39;s a Gary Stu, through and through. He is like the manifestation of all dweeby people flailing around their sticks and LARP swords and wishing that they could be MASTER SWORDSMEN!!!11one! with just a few weeks of &#39;practice,&#39; and don&#39;t need discipline or applied study because they&#39;re special and amazing. <br><br>(No insult to LARPers. I am one, in fact, but the <i>dweebs</i> have seen... for every person who tries to study footwork and technique and improve, there is a guy who thinks flailing around like Star Wars Kid makes him a combat master)<br><br>I am sorry. I have read the books, but I&#39;m so sorry. Eragon is terrible. I can really only see it as maybe somebody&#39;s guilty pleasure. It&#39;s just so totally entitled, disrespectful, and uninformed.

            <p>You realize that every other Rider had one of those swords?

            <p>Okay. So she normally uses magic in the forging of her blades anyway. I just checked.<br><br>And yet the one sword she made on one night, not the sword she spent hours and days and months and years on, designing, forging and spelling a sword. Her masterpiece is something she does in one night. She didn&#39;t take any time - she didn&#39;t have any -to work out what would make this sword so great. She was rushed. AND DESPITE THIS ALL she has made the Best Sword Evah. And it&#39;s Eragon&#39;s sword. <br><br>Not only that but ERAGON is the one person who convinces her to violate her oath. NO ONE ELSE is special enough to do that. She made an unvioltable oath which she violates for ERAGON.<br><br>As for the sword bursting in flames, -I haven&#39;t read Inheritance yet- but he&#39;s only had it for a few days. I&#39;m sure the flames will come in handy. ALSO it doesn&#39;t matter if they don&#39;t do anything. IT STILL TURNS ON FIRE. No one else&#39;s sword does that. </p>

            <p>Short of going to recheck the book, I have no way to either prove or disprove your first point, and presumably you checked thoroughly, so I won&#39;t bother. I&#39;ll take your word on this.<br>Which pretty much derails my thought concerning the whole Sword of Sueness thing.<br>However, I&#39;m not sure it was Eragon that convinced her so much as the circumstances. Finally there was a Rider who could challenge Galbatorix...but he needs a sword. Thus her forging Brisingr.<br>Personally, I&#39;m of the opinion that it takes a useful trait for the sword to be Stuish. Being a pink and sparkly sword would be a charge for a Sue, but not a Stu. On the other hand, a useful trait like being able to fling lightning, say, would be more of a Stu trait, since Stus are more combat-oriented by definition. Of course, this last is probably just my personal paradigm of Sues and Stus (which may account for this whole thread to begin with: my personal Stu definition not matching the PPC&#39;s).</p>

            <p>Just with this one point-- I only read the first book once, and never touched the rest of the series. So I&#39;ve only got a clinical sort of point to throw in, here.<br><br>Having a cool feature that doesn&#39;t add anything the conflict/plot/etc... actually kind of makes it <i>more</i> Stuish, not less. One of the defining characteristics of a Sue/Stu, IMHO, is one that Calista pointed out earlier-- there&#39;s all kinds of &#39;cool&#39; and &#39;awesome&#39; features thrown in, not to advance the story, or add characterization, but because it makes the character look cooler. Which, quite frankly, is exactly what Brisingr looks like from here.</p>

            <p>My first introduction to modern fantasy was R. A. Salvatore&#39;s Drizzt Do&#39;Urden. Chaotic Good dark elf who flees his Chaotic Evil home in the Underdark and makes his way above the surface... and he was my absolute favorite thing to read for a very long time, and he is <i>such</i> a Stu. He&#39;s got lavender eyes (in both infrared and visible light), he angsts about his past in a journal* at the start of every chapter (and frequently throughout), he has two über-cool scimitars, which he wields frequently, he manages to befriend a Lawful Good dwarf and his human daughter...<br><br>I haven&#39;t read the series in years, but if you put it in front of me right now, I would probably drop everything and be late to work because I&#39;d start reading immediately. He&#39;s a total Stu, and I love the series anyway, and shrug when people tell me it sucks. Likewise with the new TV show, Terra Nova. I know it has issues, I know it has flaws, I know quite a few of the plot twists were predictable, and I just don&#39;t care. I like it. Why do I care whether it&#39;s clinically Good<sup>TM</sup> or not? Or, as my friend said about Flashpoint, &quot;It&#39;s not that the show has no flaws. It&#39;s just that <i>I don&#39;t care</i>.&quot;<br><br>Eragon being a totally overpowered Stu doesn&#39;t invalidate your enjoyment of him. It doesn&#39;t even have to be a &#39;guilty pleasure&#39;! You know he&#39;s not the most developed character in the world, but who cares? You like it; that&#39;s what matters.<br><br>*I will admit that two of those journal entries were excellent, and stuck with me-- the one on dragons, and the one on shadows. &quot;There are no shadows in the Underdark.&quot; And he goes into a whole explanation of how shadows can be seen as a metaphor for imagination, dreams, for the twilit world of &#39;maybe-there,&#39; but in the Underdark, none of those things matter, there is no time for maybes, for dreams. Then the one on dragons, where he muses that perhaps dragons represent everything unconquerable about the world, that we, as <s>humans</s> sapients, need something out there so mysterious, timeless, wise-- that it will be a tragedy when the last dragon is gone. Very poignant, those.</p>

            <p>If a sword can cut through a magic door, burn wood, and destroy metal reinforcements while on fire, I&#39;d say there is a good chance the sword would be Speshul. In my opinion, doesn&#39;t matter whether the flames that cover the sword are useful or not, the question to ask is: &quot;Do the other Riders&#39; swords have magical properties (other than the energy sink in the jewel), or is it just Eragon&#39;s?&quot; <br><br>I just realized Eragon&#39;s name is one letter away from spelling &quot;dragon&quot;.

            <p>...one<br><br>I&#39;ve read most of the Inheritence books (haven&#39;t managed to get my hands on the fourth one yet, but I&#39;m planing in it soon)  and I&#39;ll admit, they are a guilty pleasure.<br><br>The Elves in Inheritance are kind of sueish, truth be told. They are portrayed as 100 times better than us mere mortals could ever hope to be. They&#39;re faster, stronger and more beautiful. They have better magic, better senses, and are immortal. <br><br>Now, this wouldn&#39;t be so bad, if say, there was a good reason for all of this. It&#39;s very much like this with the Elves in LotR after all, they don&#39;t get sick, have elven speed, strength, grace, beauty and senses as well. But Tolkien&#39;s elves have a reason for this: their bodies and souls are more closely connected then those of men because they are bound to Middle-earth, while the Race of Man isn&#39;t and goes on beyond the circles of the world when they die.<br><br>The closest thing the Elves in Inheritance have to a reason for their uber-awesomeness is their pact with the dragons, which is relatively weak in comparison, considering that later on Men were allowed into this pact, and still aren&#39;t as good as the Elves.<br><br>Tolkien&#39;s Elves also had a history and culture built up around them, a complex one (you could fill up a whole book with it infact!) and a tragic one. The bad things done by Tolkien&#39;s Elves were portrayed as being <i>bad</i> and they had consequences.<br><br>In Inheritence, the picture we have of the Elves&#39;s history and culture is shallow and flat at best. They are portrayed as the authors ideal society, but nothing more beyond that. Beyond that it is clear that they are a rip-off of Tolkien&#39;s elves and the uncreativeity and unoriginality there are signs of suedom.<br><br>When Paolini&#39;s Elves do bad things (like attacking nearby human settlements with no real excuse or reason besides &quot;well, they are part of the Empire, so...why not?&quot; like in <i>Brisingr</i> it is portrayed as perfectly alright. That kind of protaginist centered morality is probably one of the most telling signs of of Sues and Stues. Now I haven&#39;t read the fourth book, so it could be that Paolini knocked his elves down a peg or two and I just don&#39;t know about it, but as it stands now, his elves are a race of Sues</p>

            <p>Personally, I think that a major part of Sueness is being the protagonist, which the elves aren&#39;t. I will grant that they might be there just to have someone for Eragon to become as good as, but I think they fall just short of Sueness due to not being protagonists.</p>

            <p>I presume this fic is well known among you, but just in case it isn&#39;t, I&#39;d like to point it out to all Boarders. If I could and if it hasn&#39;t been done, I&#39;d like to take this story as a Mission, but for the time being I still need to tame Ryu into being an agent, and after that I need to acquire permission, so for the time being I&#39;m unable. <br><br>Anyway, the fic is called Face the Strange, and is a crossover of Twilight, Yu Yu Hakusho, Sonic the Hedgehog, X-Men and Harry Potter, set in the Harry Potter universe. <br><br>It has been called comparable to My Immortal, and its protagonist is a girl called Dally, who is a clear example of a Godmode!Sue, who is a vampire, a witch, and a mutant. I have read only one and a half chapter so far, but this will be a bad one. <br><br>I hereby post the link to the fic, and please people, supply me with copious amounts of Bleeprin.<br><br><a href="http://xdallyx.webs.com/chapterone.htm"><a href="http://xdallyx.webs.com/chapterone.htm">http://xdallyx.webs.com/chapterone.htm</a></a></p>

            <p>Pokemon Plus Nobunaga&#39;s Ambition. I don&#39;t know how many of you have heard from it; I first learned of its existence about an hour ago. Apparently this game will be set in feudal Japan, and I understand that it&#39;s a crossover between Pokemon and another series (Nobunaga&#39;s Ambition?). <br><br>In any event, the idea seemed nice enough, until I saw one particular Pokemon in the trailer for it: Mewtwo. Mewtwo is a clone of Mew, made by human scientists. He wasn&#39;t around in feudal Japan, and while he sent the main characters back in time at the end of Mewtwo Strikes Back (or maybe he merely teleported them and changed the weather back to how it was before they left, and no time travel whatsoever was involved) he has never been known to travel through time.<br><br>Now, I don&#39;t know how much of this game is to be considered canon, since I believe Game Freak isn&#39;t really involved in it, but if we&#39;re to believe it has its place in the canon...well, then they&#39;ve destroyed Mewtwo in the process. Mewtwo&#39;s backstory is so ingrained into his character and accounts for everything that drives him; a change like this would totally destroy him. <br><br>Not to mention his origins: his name is Mewtwo because he was cloned from Mew, what other justification could there be for his name? He doesn&#39;t go around saying it constantly like other Pokemon do. All of this got me thinking, what is the PPC&#39;s policy on such events? Obviously this development could be a threat to the canon, but who are we to fight the very creators? I&#39;d like to know everyone&#39;s thoughts on it.</p>

            <p><i>Pokémon + Nobunaga&#39;s Ambition</i> will be a canon AU, like <i>Marvel Zombies</i> or the musical adaptation of <i>Wicked</i>.

            <p>There&#39;s one canon, and then adaptations that create separate continua.<br><br>Original books by L. Frank Baum--Dorothy&#39;s adventures in Oz; Oz is real and her family eventually move there. Oz is a whimsical country where very little is serious, suspension of disbelief is the norm, and even death is unusual.<br><br>Movie adaptation: Oz is a dream or hallucination Dorothy had while in a coma. Some changes made to canon, but this is the major one.<br><br>&quot;Wicked&quot;, bookverse: The Wicked Witch gets a name, Elphaba. Oz turns into a serious country with involved politics and religion. The Talking Animals get backstories. Dorothy is mostly off-screen and becomes an intruder rather than the center of action; in fact, she&#39;s a bit of an in-universe Mary Sue in that she acts to make major changes with little knowledge of the canon, treating it as her personal playground. (I do not believe the author means to accuse L. Frank Baum of writing Dorothy as a Sue, though; it&#39;s just a consequence of the much more serious interpretation of the actions of an innocent girl in an innocent world, transferred into a much more serious world.)<br><br>&quot;Wicked&quot;, musicalverse: The story is based on the book, but it&#39;s a lot more upbeat and hopeful. Elphaba has major magical powers that she doesn&#39;t have in the books, and her fate is different. Dorothy is once again offscreen, and is treated like an intruder who doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s doing.<br><br>A few more minor adaptations exist and can be considered anything from AUs of one of the other universes, good or bad parodies, or small continua in their own right.<br><br>When does a continuum split?--I would say: It splits into two continua when the new continuum is significantly different from the old continuum, and strong enough to stand on its own independent of the old.<br><br>In a way, fanfic that departs from canon too much tries to do this--the multiple canon breaks create a story that is unrecognizable from canon. But because the story is not strong enough to stand on its own, it leans on the original canon, threatening to damage it by pulling it out of shape.</p>

            <p>I wasn&#39;t really sure on what the PPC stance on it was, so thanks for clarifying! Anyway, while it&#39;s true that Pokemon has a lot of different canons, the main traits and origins of the Pokemon are to my knowledge at least fairly consistent with on another, and this would form a serious breach of that. <br><br>Then again, I hardly think a crossover like this would be thought out well, and is indeed purely written to cash in on Pokemon&#39;s fame. I suppose it might as well be canon though; the HP movies are canon too and I&#39;ll never stop bitching about those (and in particular Deathly Hallows Part Two) either. In that sense I&#39;m quite the hypocrite, since I&#39;m more than willing to accept the LotR movies as canon because I can&#39;t fight myself through the books.<br><br>As for Twilight, I must admit that I own all the books and I did enjoy them somewhat, despite the characters being cardboard cutouts of Mary-Sues. (I refuse to address Edward as a Stu, because for that manliness is needed)</p>

            <p>...would be for Mewtwo to be the spawn (in one way or another) of Mew.  That gives you a basis for the name.  Everything else can follow from there.<br><br>That said, I think that it is a very bad idea to judge a game/movie/story/whatever before you have played/watched/read/whatevered it.  Both Pokemon and Nobunaga&#39;s Ambition have large followings (especially in Japan), though Pokemon&#39;s following is far larger, and both are good games (I own Nobunaga&#39;s Ambition for the NES).  Game Freak (who is involved in development) and Tecmo Koei both have long histories in the industry and seem to know what they are doing.<br><br>Being that the trailer I have seen for this game was in Japanese, I think it is more likely that they are combining two series that are popular in Japan for Japanese fans of both games.  It may not even make it over to English-speaking markets, being that there is little interest in Nobunaga in those places.<br><br>Tl;dr: I would give it a shot before I accused people of making a poorly thought out game and trying to cash in on Pokemon&#39;s fame, especially when the other game involved has been around and active since 1983.<br></p>

            <p>Fun reads!  I especially liked the interlude.  We need more &quot;adventures in HQ&quot; stories.  The mission maybe could have been a bit longer, but I guess it had already been in progress, and the main problem with it was prominent anyway.  I didn&#39;t get the talk about Arume, since I don&#39;t watch anime; you maybe could have gone into more detail there for the unenlightened.</p>

            <p>For all the Lord of the Rings PPCers out there, ten years ago today, <i>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</i> came out in theaters. It changed not only the cinematic landscape, but the fanfiction landscape forever. Through the movies, the LOTR saga was popularized to a greater extent, especially for the younger crowd. It spawned <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/OFU">OFUM</a> and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Celebrian">Celebrian</a> [NSFW], <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_Goodfic">Don&#39;t Panic!</a> and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legolas_by_laura">legolas by laura</a>.

            <p>I think I finally understand what this place is about. Anyway, standard permission request stuff INCOMING!<br><br>Agent Profiles:<br><br>Yn&#39;hrai is Yithian from the Cthulhu Mythos. The use of his body-swapping and mind-wiping abilities have been forbidden by upstairs shortly after his arrival, in which he body-swapped with some poor agent sitting in his RC. Other agents quickly resolved the situation and recruited Yn&#39;hrai.<br><br>Yn&#39;hrai himself is very formal and serious, and spends a very large amount of time researching various canons. He is very orderly, and is very strict with rules, which he also spends large amounts of time researching. Given that Yn&#39;hrai intends to go into the Department of Floaters, Eclectic Subdivision of Advanced Species, he has to know the proper methods and procedures for every type of mission, and the weaknesses of every species. He is referred to as male only to avoid pronoun conflicts with his partner.<br><br>Kasaiko is a fairy from the Touhou verse associated with FIRE. She cannot remember how she got into HQ, but she somehow did, and caused a bit of a fright when she starting lighting things on FIRE. She was recruited because it was thought that she would make the perfect DOGA agent. For a reason which does not involve a meeting between her and the Bonsai Mallorn which did not happen, in which she did not attempt to light the Bonsai Mallorn on FIRE, she was instead placed in the Department of Floaters, ESAS.<br><br>Though Kasaiko is 36, she looks like a 6 year old girl, and acts like one as well. She is always looking for something fun, and is not really one for any kind of order or reason. Most notably, Kasaiko is an extreme pyro, and considers lighting things on FIRE to be fun, and she does not need any manner of tools to do this. The Flowers have forbidden her from lighting things on FIRE in such a manner, though she seldom pays this any heed. Kasaiko&#39;s eyes, hair, and anything she might be wearing looks like it is currently on FIRE, and most of the time, she does as well. This is because she often is on FIRE. She cannot pronounce &quot;Yn&#39;hrai&quot;.<br><br>Writing Sample: <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0ByqMSMpwseDnMjg2NmM0YmEtMzgwZS00YjM0LTg2NWQtMmFhNzFjMzEzYTk3"><a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0ByqMSMpwseDnMjg2NmM0YmEtMzgwZS00YjM0LTg2NWQtMmFhNzFjMzEzYTk3">https://docs.google.com/open?id=0ByqMSMpwseDnMjg2NmM0YmEtMzgwZS00YjM0LTg2NWQtMmFhNzFjMzEzYTk3</a></a><br><br>First fic to spork: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7264130/1/Oriental_Transience_of_Scarlet_Waning_Moon"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7264130/1/Oriental_Transience_of_Scarlet_Waning_Moon">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7264130/1/Oriental_Transience_of_Scarlet_Waning_Moon</a></a></p>

            <p>Okay, to begin with the agents themselves: You have an agent from a terrifyingly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Race_of_Yith">overpowered race, which Wikipedia tells me are super intelligent and are learn-all to know-all types</a>. This does not give me great confidence, and goes somewhat crosswise to the general idea of ordinary- or at least not super special- agents. Especially given Lovecraft. If anyone else reads this who is more familiar with Lovecraft&#39;s mythos and this particular species, I&#39;d like you to chime in here as to this agent and their viability because I, personally, am not sure of this one working well at all. <br><br>Your second agent appears to be all of six years old, sets all the things on fire, and given your character description, does not seem to be controllable in the least.<br><br>The age factor makes me- and probably most others- uneasy. The lowest age I&#39;ve seen for a field agent is twelve or thirteen. Youngest agent I&#39;ve seen at all was eleven or so, and she was not a field agent at all. This is, of course, going with apparent age/acted age. (Ilraen, for example, doesn&#39;t count.) Your badfic linked has sex in it. You&#39;re pairing that with the intent of having an apparent six year old as an agent to take part in killing it. The reasons why this is a bad idea and will make many, if not all people here uncomfortable should be clear. <br><br>Second  point: Setting all the things on fire is her thing? Okay. Is there anything else? Apparently not. &#39;Sets everything on fire&#39; is not a character trait. Well, pyromania is a character trait, but it doesn&#39;t make for a character.<br><br>Third point, and possibly the one that needs to be elaborated on the most: She cannot be controlled. This is not a good thing. This is not a &#39;oh, this is so funny!&#39;. This is the point where one wonders why she is still around. PPC agents might rail against the establishment, or they might dislike the Flowers, or they might hate their partner, but they are able to be check in check under normal situations. <br><br>I was reading the Christmas party RP, and I noticed your posts. Kasaiko, you made evident, has no sense of self control and cannot be controlled even under normal circumstances. (You also godmoded to ensure that, and make it clear.)<br><br>This character would make a terrible agent because she has no personality traits whatsoever, does not work with the PPC because of the issue with control, and would make people feel distinctly uncomfortable at best, and like utter scummy creeps at worst, and also have the potential for getting people in severe trouble due to the combination of what is in fics and her apparent age. <br><br><br>Now, to move on to the writing sample.<br><br>This is bad writing.<br><br>Your sentences have no structure at all; let&#39;s take this first paragraph you gave us.<br><br><i>Ekaes, a lady of the wind, and small so, again ﬂew from her home in the high peaks of Celara, because the earth rumbled about her, and so she thought that a fourth war had come. She possessed little, so she ﬂew away unencumbered. Ekaes was always ﬂying somewhere, moving as often as someone of the ﬂame, though she had not ﬁre’s courage. Indeed, moving without purpose was common for the people of the wind, but when the third war was beginning, she ﬂed from the old world, and so she survived.</i><br><br>This is purple prose. These sentences have little, if any, grammatical structure behind them. This whole paragraph has me utterly baffled as to how you are trying to say this that I&#39;m not even sure how to say it&#39;s wrong besides that it is wrong. <br><br>The rest of the sample fares even worse- there are outright contradictions and things that make no sense. &quot;Even though the people of the wind wore light clothing, because thicker clothes would merely weigh these small people down, Ekaes felt the heat.&quot; Thin clothing does not stop heat from reaching you. <br><br>I could- and probably should- continue, but it is past two AM and I have work.<br><br>Also, fire does not need to be in all capitals. <br><br>Permission not granted.</p>

YOU MUST BE 18+ AND WILLING TO LET GO OF THE COMMON KNOWLEDGE ABOUT MYTHICAL AND MAGICAL BEINGS AS WELL RELATIONSHIP AND LOGICAL BOUNDARIES BETWEEN HUMANS AND MONSTERS WHILE IN BROWSING SITE!<br><br><a href="http://www.monstergirlunlimited.com/forum/"><a href="http://www.monstergirlunlimited.com/forum/">http://www.monstergirlunlimited.com/forum/</a></a><br><br><br>You will need a lot of Bleeprin after going in there if you didn&#39;t like what you have seen and read. The good thing about the fandom is that the plot of the entire set-up is almost undetermined and the canon is more of a guide and less of a story, making fanfic writing about it easier (depends on the writer). Bad thing however is that it revolves on the Id personality.<br><br>Anyway, good luck and have fun browsing the site that I&#39;ve shared.<br><br></p>

            <p>But this is rather more nakedly hostile than is really comfortable, even for a troll. If all we can do is ignore them (or snark at them), it&#39;s a far better course than getting nasty.</p>

            <p>that because this is an old board it is just some clowns going from board to board on the hosting service to extract lulz. They don&#39;t know who we are or care.<br><br>It&#39;s a pretty poor attempt, anyway. The whole point of trolling is to get a rise out of others but all I can say in this post is that I seriously feel bad for them and hope their lived improve. This is all kind of pathetic and pitiful.</p>

            <p>It is indeed quite annoying. Fortunately, though, we do have some recourse in the form of the Nameless Admin, who will no doubt deal with it as soon as s/he has time. Meanwhile, I suggest we all go about our business as normally as possible. Don&#39;t Feed the Trolls, after all.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>
