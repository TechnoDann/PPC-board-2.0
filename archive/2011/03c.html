            <p>Hey, everybody.  I was wondering how many Boarders play RPGs.  I&#39;m trying to get an idea or two together, and would like to get an idea of which continuities people here could provide feedback for, so I&#39;d love it if you wonderful. . .  people. . .  could post here and say which games (if any) you play.  <br>p.s. - I&#39;d be asking for ideas about crossovers with various RPGs, just so you know what you&#39;re getting into. . . </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t own any game systems or tabletop RPGs at all, but I&#39;ve done a bunch of text based role plays with friends. They&#39;ve all died by now, sadly. Or maybe not so sadly, considering the improvement we&#39;ve all made since then.<br>I&#39;ve played a few of those Artix games that Aeidhryn mentioned, but I got bored pretty quickly. Same thing with that Wizard101 thing-- My brother introduced me, I liked it for a bit, then got bored.<br>...So yeah. That&#39;s about it.</p>

            <p>I play quite a lot of video game RPGs (enduring favorites are mostly the Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, Pokemon, and Golden Sun series). I&#39;m familiar with a couple of tabletop RPGs as well - the newer World of Darkness games (I&#39;m most familiar with Changeling, which is about people stolen by fairies, but I&#39;ve got a passing familiarity with Mage and Genius (a fan game about mad scientists) as well), and I&#39;m fairly familiar with Dungeons and Dragons though I don&#39;t actually play it much.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty much tabletop only, I don&#39;t even own a video game system.  And if I&#39;m buying computer games, I tend to go for HOG or IHOG.<br><br>I&#39;ve played D&amp;D up to 3.5.  I got rid of most of my Ravenloft supplements, but I should still have almost everything I bought for Spelljammer.  I never tried Dark Sun or what-was-it-called, the one where you&#39;re running around the outer planes.<br><br>I&#39;ve played Champions/Hero System since first edition.  I&#39;m actually one of the Hero Games demo GMs (Legion of Heroes); I don&#39;t have a lot of the 6th edition sourcebooks due to cost, but I should be able to get information on anything I don&#39;t own.<br><br>I&#39;m familiar with old World of Darkness, but never played the new version.  I&#39;m also familiar with the Paranoia XP rules, which I think only got a trademark removal to become the most recent edition.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;d be interested in any of the Artix Games I play- DragonFable, Aqworlds, etc. And Evony is like a guilty secret, because it is obviously a big hoax to get me to pay them stuff (which I am resisting heroically), but it&#39;s so fun (read: addictive) I keep coming back after three month breaks. If you found me an interesting one, maybe... but not runescape. No likey runescape.</p>

            <p>I play a wide variety of RPGs, both tabletop and electronic. Some of my preferred video game titles include Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Fallout, and Kingdom Hearts. As for tabletop, my favorites are Mutants and Masterminds (a superhero RPG), Deadlands, Paranoia, Serenity, and D&amp;D 4e with a focus on the Eberron setting.<br><br>If you have any further questions, I&#39;d be happy to help.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not much for playing video games, but I&#39;ve dipped my toe into WoW once or twice (read: got a couple of characters up to level 30), I got through the first disc of Final Fantasy VII, and I&#39;ve watched my gamer friends play enough other stuff to get gamer jokes most of the time.<br><br>However, I&#39;m very familiar with D&amp;D (mostly 3.5, though I started on AD&amp;D), and I&#39;ve played in a few games using the Shadowrun and World of Darkness systems.

            <p>Hey, everyone.  I was on PlayDiplomacy.com today and decided to make a new game.  I am wondering if there is enough interest on the Board to get an all PPC game going.  Let me know if you are interested in playing or if you have any questions.<br><br>For those who are not aware of Diplomacy, it is a game of strategy that is easy to learn, but difficult to master.  You are encouraged to talk to the other players in the game to form alliances to conquer the others.<br><br>PlayDiplomacy.com has tutorials if you want to learn more.  Beginner players would be welcome in this game.  <br><br>Potential time limits for moves are 2 days for all phases or 2 days for moves and one day for retreats and builds.</p>

The goatee&#39;s much thicker, the skin&#39;s much clearer, and the hair&#39;s much blonder now, thanks to a recovery from my (mostly psychological) flu! And my hairdresser coming around and doing my hair.<br><br>If you want more specifics... My hair&#39;s generally fairly short, and I wear it in a &#39;curtains&#39; style. There&#39;s relatively little flab under my chin, and I exercise regularly enough that I&#39;m moderately toned. My eyes are perpetually tired, so it constantly looks as if I haven&#39;t had much sleep or rest. I&#39;m about 5&#39;11, broad shouldered, constantly stand with my weight more on one leg. I constantly wear that evil-eye necklace for good luck.

            <p>I&#39;d like to have an image of Agents Sergio Turbo and Corolla.<br><br>Sergio Turbo is quite thin and six feet high. He has short brown hair (with no hairdo at all), a round face (not too much, however, since he&#39;s not chubby at all), a small nose and glasses<br><br>Corolla is actually a lot like Reinforce Zwei from Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha (<a href="http://images.wikia.com/nanoha/images/2/28/Reinforce_Zwei.jpg"><a href="http://images.wikia.com/nanoha/images/2/28/Reinforce_Zwei.jpg">http://images.wikia.com/nanoha/images/2/28/Reinforce_Zwei.jpg</a></a>), only with brown air and different clothes (the Subeta HQ image in her agent page has the right attire, but if it is too complicated a blue shirt and white skirt is fine). She is usually six inches tall, but in case of need can shift into a more human size (5 feet)<br><br>If my description is lame, feel free to do chibis!</p>

            <p>Ooh! Could you draw Agent Caleb and Kestrel standing together? So Caleb is a Twilight vampire, so he is both pale and physically attractive. He has wavy brown hair long enough to reach his lower jaw, and purple eyes. Kestrel is shorter than him, and is a tawny ferret with a brown mask over her eyes and brown paws. She also has blue eyes, is missing half of her left ear, and wears a green hoodie. Just draw him sparkling and looking at her in irritation while she points and laughs.</p>

            <p>Hmm. How about Lee standing over a Sue with her Frying Pan of Doom at the ready, with Ian in the background?<br><br>Lee is five-foot-four, currently has shoulder-length blonde hair pulled back into a pony tail, and has a heart-shaped face. She has green eyes, is right-handed, and can be wearing any costume of your choice, though something Victorian or Steampunk would be awesome.<br><br>Ian kind of resembles Jason Momoa/Ronon Dex from Stargate Atlantis, in that he is of Native Samoan stock, is tall, and wears his hair in dreadlocks that have beads decorating them. He normally keeps them tied back with a leather tie for missions when not in disguise. He has brown eyes and is around 6&#39;3&quot;. Again, any costume is welcome, though Steampunk or Victorian would be shiny.</p>

Think you could doodle Gall riding Snerri? My general impression from the movie is that the rider sits on the dragon&#39;s neck like people do on choppers, with the horns as handlebars. And they should both look like they&#39;re having more fun than is allowed. Gall is about 5&#39;4&quot; and stocky but thinks she&#39;s 6&#39;.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Gall has a helmet with curly horns on it, she&#39;s got leather armor decorated with bits of bones and things, and she&#39;s got a big spiky mace. She wears a fat, scruffy-looking braid that goes down just between her shoulderblades. If you want colors, the hair&#39;s dark red, the eyes are blue, and the skin is Nordic-pale. I guess she&#39;s probably a bit snub-nosed. &#39;M afraid that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got at the moment.<br><br>Snerri is this, only blue/purple instead of red/black:<br><br><img src="http://images.wikia.com/dragons/images/7/7e/Monstrous-nightmare-01.png" alt="http://images.wikia.com/dragons/images/7/7e/Monstrous-nightmare-01.png"></p>

You will get a lot of stuff about people completely misunderstanding what a Mary Sue is.<br><br>I got fed up with it and decided to fill out some Mary Sue artmemes demonstrating:<br><br>an otherwise &#39;normal&#39; or &#39;boring&#39; character can be a Mary Sue if the author crafts her selfishly.<br><br>an otherwise &#39;Sue-ish&#39; character can be fine if the author/artist crafts her well.<br><br><img src="http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/071/5/1/515d3031034558202b420dfef8199b89-d3bh0sc.png" alt="http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/071/5/1/515d3031034558202b420dfef8199b89-d3bh0sc.png"> (part 1)<img src="http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/089/6/2/oc_vs__mary_sue_meme__part_two_by_silverbellsabove-d3cte1y.png" alt="http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/089/6/2/oc_vs__mary_sue_meme__part_two_by_silverbellsabove-d3cte1y.png"> (part 2)<br><br>... So, discuss. How do people see Mary Sues, interpret the definition, and take action elsewhere? And does it bug you as much as it bugs me?</p>

            <p>A sue is a character you want to be, that is the way they start out as a fantasy. An OC is character created in an attempt to be interesting to others. Thats how I&#39;d put it.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d say that a sue is more of a Glorified Self-Insert, a mirror of the author with all of the flaws removed and all of the positive attributes amplified, to the point that even the story itself must love the character.<br><br>An OC, on the other hand, is a character with a balance of positive/negative attributes such that it feels like a real person.</p>

            <p>I want to be Batman, but that doesn&#39;t make him a Sue. You might be talking about a character that someone makes themselves, which would be more accurate. But that isn&#39;t a big factor, well, to me anyway. Wanting to be a character you make doesn&#39;t make them bad, it&#39;s when you start giving special things and treatment is when they become a Sue.</p>

            <p>I like your art, for starters. It&#39;s a good demonstrator of how Mary Sues and OCs can be alike, but different.<br><br>Mary Sues are, more or less, the ones the entire fic is about. If an author places so much emphasis on them, to the exclusion of canon and other characters, you have a Mary Sue on your hands. Spreading the action around, giving your OC faults and mistakes and a gradual change throughout the course of the story, helps prevent Mary Sue-ism from occurring.<br><br>It seems to me that it&#39;s not about what the character has, it&#39;s about how they got it. If an OC has had to work for hours to get merely proficient with a weapon, and they occasionally/frequently find someone better than them with it, they&#39;re realistic and well-portrayed. If a character simply picks up the weapon and is amazing at it, that&#39;s a Mary Sue.<br><br>I&#39;m still slightly unsure on some of the finer points of spotting Sues, but my general definition right now is along the lines of &quot;they&#39;re what it&#39;s all about.&quot; If someone doesn&#39;t like them, it&#39;s because that person isn&#39;t smart enough to see how amazing they are. If someone likes them romantically...well, of course they do! Weapons? They&#39;re a natural. Magic? Of course!</p>

            <p>Please let me know how useful this is. I want to do a better job critiquing/reviewing.<br><br>Overall, this was highly entertaining. Dann is very funny, Earwig is always entertaining, though in a bit different way. More like verbal jokes versus physical comedy (which you translate well in Earwig&#39;s interactions).  <br><br>I felt bad for Derik when Gall made that gaff about his dragon, but he actually seemed to handle it better than I thought he would.  Maybe he is coping? <br><br>Gall seems to be more typical of the attitudinal agents, but the addition of her total lack of technology understanding should be really interesting.  She should meet Unger sometime. He could set something on fire for her, and then be totally shown up by the Monstrous Nightmare. I think he&#39;d be in love...though with the fiery monster or it&#39;s master might be debatable. :)<br><br>The ending was sweet; even approaching genuinely poignant, which is not so easy to accomplish in a humor story.<br><br>Let&#39;s see how I do with the questions at the end.  &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; and Agent Decima.<br><br>Okay, specific sentences that I liked or that I thought could use a bit of tweaking.<br><br><b>Perhaps slightly more practically than most, Agent Dann reached for a fire extinguisher. </b>  I liked this sentence. It established Dann as practical and funny, which set me up to expect to laugh with him the rest of the story. Very nice scene setting with the dragon popping in the paragraph before this sentence, as well. <br><br><b>a tough-looking young woman in a Viking helmet and armor menaced anyone who looked at her the wrong way with a sizable mace.</b>  This read to me like people were using a sizable mace to look at her, as opposed to her menacing people with a sizable mace<br><br><b>&quot;The white emptiness of the hangar really had no clue how to handle a dragon.&quot; </b> I think from reading the entire paragraph that the hangar is semi-sentient like most PPC tech, but to me, it seemed that &quot;The white emptiness&quot; is the subject of the sentence and the sentience.<br><br><b>The drama of this was sharply diminished when Snerri smacked snout-first into the opposing wall, but he recovered quickly and bore his rider dizzily away into the complex of Headquarters.</b> I loved this one. Smack!<br><br><b>&quot;Having followed the trail of scattered agents, claw marks, and one very traumatized petunia&quot; </b> Is that a Flower or a flower? (Unrelated note, but petunias are my favorite flowers.)<br><br><b>&quot;It&#39;s like magic,&quot; Dann agreed, &quot;but with more swearing. And slightly higher risk of burning yourself.&quot;</b>  BEST LINE EVER!<br><br><b>&quot;...And the flashy-thingy? When do I get a flashy-thingy?&quot;</b>  <br><b>&quot;Now that&#39;s just dangerous,&quot; Dann said, picking up the Sharpie. &quot;Wonder who left that lying around?&quot;</b> <br>Very nice mission.  I look forward to your next one.<br><br></p>

            <p>Yep, got &#39;em both. {= )<br><br>I&#39;m glad you enjoyed the interlude, and I have enjoyed your response.

I feel like her unrestrained, freewheeling, <i>female</i> snark is something I&#39;ve personally been missing out on. I hope that she&#39;ll be as fun to read as she is for me to write, and I do intend to take advantage of the fact that, while her home continuum doesn&#39;t really trouble itself about anachronisms, she probably doesn&#39;t understand half the expressions she uses, not to mention technology. <sup>_<sup><br><br>Heaven</sup></sup> forbid Unger ever have access to a fire-breathing dragon. {X D That said, it would be fun. *eg*<br><br>Glad you like the ending.

            <p>Yes, Derik read fine. I was pretty surprised he took as well as he did, but it didn&#39;t come across as OOC. Thanks, mostly to the fact that the subject drifted a bit pretty quickly.

            <p>Hi.I&#39;m Yibbs. I&#39;ve been reading PPC stuff/the Board for a while and finally worked up the courage to post something. The various PPC things are incredibly fun to read. Eventually I want to be able to write my own spin-off. However, I already have a project I&#39;m working on so that probably won&#39;t happen soon. So....That&#39;s about it. :hides behind pile of books in embarrassment: (P.S. Please ignore any typos. My keyboard is messed up at the moment.)   </p>

            <p>Oh, my friends, this is a cautionary tale. This is the tale of what happens when an author does not learn how to deal with reviews. This is the tale of <a href="http://booksandpals.blogspot.com/2011/03/greek-seaman-jacqueline-howett.html">BigAl&#39;s review of &quot;The Greek Seaman&quot; by Jacqueline Howett</a>. Read the review. Then read the comments. Laugh. Weep. Learn.<br><br>That said, I&#39;ll also encourage you to scroll down the board a bit and take a look at Phobos&#39; post on his mission.

            <p>&quot;Dear heavens. It&#39;s like an immature fanfic author.&quot;<br><br>That is exactly what I was thinking.  <br><br>&quot;people on the Pit back up the AUTHOR when they rage.&quot;<br><br>I was talking about this on the IRC the other day. It really would not surprise me at all if this Howett person was a fanfic writer before deciding to become a novelist. It really is a different world.<br><br>I have wondered recently if the PPC has not started to fall into that trap a bit. Mission writers don&#39;t get reviews other than, &#39;I liked this.&#39; (I know that, at times, I have been guilty of this type of review myself, especially if I am in a hurry.) But we also are beginning to have an atmosphere where anything negative is seen as bullying. We don&#39;t want to foster flaming our PPC authors, but we have to balance that with allowing our reviewers freedom from fear of reprisals from the authors or other PPCers.<br><br>Personally, I am pledging to stop giving vapid reviews. I cannot guarantee that my reviews will be the best ever given, but I will be putting more effort into them in the future.<br></p>

            <p>Uh.... fez, I&#39;m not very good at introductions... Defaulting to standard.<br><br>Hi, I&#39;m Arjay. Before you ask that&#39;s not my real name, and also before you ask, I&#39;m a guy, at least as far as I know. As the name suggests, I play TF2 frequently (friends only, don&#39;t like to deal with the general TF2 community), in addition to Pokemon, Super Smash Bros. (avoid multiplayer on both of those), and Golden Sun.<br><br>If you&#39;re wondering about my writing history, I had a brief stint as a fanfic writer some years ago, but I sucked at it and I openly realized such before too long. (Don&#39;t bother asking for links, I took it all down ages ago). I don&#39;t really write much in terms of fanfic anymore (Still do some original fic stuff), but I still read a lot of fanfic.<br><br>Long-ish intro is long-ish. Suffice to say, I HOPE to remain a relatively frequent poster, but with my workload (school plus online school plus my job plus game time), well... we&#39;ll see.</p>

            <p>Hiya! I&#39;m interested in joining the PPC. Could I get some advice/suggestions/&quot;creepy comments that tell me I&#39;m in the right place&quot; to help start me out? I have an agent fairly developed already, but I really don&#39;t know how to do this. Anjilly Ka is giving me some tips, and she&#39;s my beta for the Official Fanfiction University of Avatar: The Last Airbender (OFUA:TLA) fic that I&#39;m writing. You can find me on fanfiction.net under this same penname if you so desire!</p>

            <p>I believe the place you want to be right now is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">our wiki</a>.

I have <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Supernumerary">an agent</a> who&#39;s bound and determined to push the envelope due to some special circumstances, but so far he&#39;s doing all right--unless you take not remembering his dreams anymore as a bad thing. He doesn&#39;t.<br><br>Of course, if you <i>think</i> there are going to be side effects, the chances greatly increase.

            <p>Hello, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.  As a newbie gift, I give you a box of assorted pixels and half-melted, plastic Army Men.<br><br>I am not sure as to the side-effects of Bleeprin, so I will let others who are more knowledgeable answer that one.<br><br>As for the posts... Anything.  We want to get a sense of who you are, so the more you post (though avoiding multiple new posts in a short amount of time is a good rule) and, more importantly, reply to others&#39; posts the better we can get to know you.  A good place to start is reading any stories that get plugged (like the one I plugged a few posts down, *nudge nudge*) on the Board and writing a review in reply to the post.  That will give us an idea of your sense of humor (very important in the PPC) and your writing skills.<br><br>Again, welcome.

            <p>It took me a while to get around to reading this, but I&#39;m very glad I did.  I usually don&#39;t enjoy Bad Slash missions as much as other types because I&#39;m squicked too easily.  However, I enjoyed this mission a lot because it was incredibly entertaining without focusing on the sex itself.  The jokes you framed around the situations kept me snickering almost the whole time, and prevented me from focusing on the slash aspects overly much.<br><br>My main complaint is with the handling of the clones of Hermione and Ginny, which Miah already mentioned a bit.  This was a bizarre manifestation even for a PPC mission, and I wish you had included some of the original wording that was causing them to pop into existence.  I&#39;m guessing they were part of sentences describing &quot;in-bed&quot; actions, which you were maybe wanting to avoid over-quoting, for which my sanity thanks you.  Still, it would have been nice to be able to read the original badfic author&#39;s words, so we could see the thought process that went into the clone joke.</p>

            <p>I found the bit at the beginning interesting with Phobos meeting himself. It did leave me wondering where the extra Phobos&#39; went. If the one in front of him left, and said that one had already left, and etc. Did they all cease to exist except the one in the story, or will the PPC be full of Phobos clones in the near future?  :D<br><br>I thought it was funny when the Flower pushed him through the portal unprepared. <br><br>I haven&#39;t read all that many Harry Potter missions, so I was wondering, is the absence of a ban on males in the girls dorms a PPC thing, or was it specific to this fic?<br><br>I&#39;ve never seen the thing with clones of the characters appearing. I really liked it, but I could have used just a bit more explanation for their appearance. I was also wondering if each ones personality traits were somehow related to the text, or if it was just random.<br><br>I didn&#39;t think it was very nice of Decima to make a pillow and blanket for herself and not for Phobos or Goth!Ginny.<br><br>I really loved that he started quoting Shakespeare for the exorcism. <br><br>Overall, I found it a lot of fun, but the mission section felt sort of rushed to me--not like you were rushing while writing, like it didn&#39;t slow me down enough as a reader.  The pacing, I guess. I know he didn&#39;t understand what was going on exactly, but I felt like there could have been more talk between the two of them.  He does seem like a very go with the flow kind of guy, but it surprised me that he didn&#39;t seem at least a bit curious.</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t worry.  The extra Phoboses (Phobosai? Phoboids? Sheep?) were all taken care of by quantum.  You see, they were all the same person, almost like ripples in a pond.  Once the ripples hit the edge, they cease to exist.  Once Phobos turned the corner the ripples were gone.<br><br>Specific to this mission, so far as I am aware.  I figured, they messed with stuff enough that the stairs would not function as they should.  It also allowed me to have Phobos there for the action.<br><br>I had a list of Ginny and Hermione types that are common in fanfiction.  When a clone appeared, I picked one off the list.  I usually just picked whichever one I thought would be the funniest.<br><br>And yeah, Decima can be inconsiderate at times.<br><br>Phobos is an actor, Shakespeare made sense.  Also, there were lines that were too perfect to pass up.<br><br>As for the pacing, you are probably right.  To be honest, I needed this mission to be done before I could move on to the next one, so I may have cut short some things.  It was also a very short fic, so that played a part in it as well.<br><br>Anyways, glad you enjoyed it.  Thank you for the detailed review.</p>

            <p>First of all, thank you to everyone who has read my mission.  It is appreciated, honestly.<br><br>However, I expected better reviews from the PPC.  I had hoped that the reviews would be more in-depth.  I know that you like the mission, but I don&#39;t know why.  What did I do right?  What can I improve upon to make the next mission better?  What did you like and why did you like it?  Also, I know that my writing is not perfect, so I refuse to believe that there is not one thing in this mission that someone out there took issue with/didn&#39;t understand/whatever.  I want to hear that stuff, too.<br><br>The reason why I am so disappointed is that I am trying to become a better writer, as most (if not all) of us are.  I can&#39;t do that if I don&#39;t get constructive criticism.<br><br>So give me your best and your worst.  I can take it.  I am not afraid of the truth.  I am afraid of the silence.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Harry Potter really isn&#39;t my bag, but I&#39;ve been in your shoes. The quality of the criticism here has been lacking of late, IMHO. So... *rolls up sleeves* let&#39;s get cracking!<br><br>*The following contains spoilers for anyone who hasn&#39;t read the mission yet.*<br><br>I think this a pretty strong introductory piece. Phobos (the character) has been given some good characterization quirks regarding his background and his relationship with the PPC, like the drama class stuff. I definitely would like to see those elements be developed over the course of his next few missions. You&#39;ve also got some good banter going, and there&#39;s nothing I love more in a mission than good banter.<br><br>The character of Decima was a little disappointing, however. There are already a lot of snippy, snarky PPC agents out there (including some of my own, I&#39;ll admit), but most of them have some other sort of distinguishing characteristics or features. Decima doesn&#39;t really stand out. I understand that this is Phobos&#39;s tale, but I think the story could have been even stronger with a more three-dimensional partner.<br><br>The biggest stumbling block I had was the ending. It felt somewhat unoriginal: rookie ends up saving more experienced partner from death/possession/fate worse than death/etc. The whole thing seemed like a setup to show off Phobos&#39;s hidden potential as an agent. I also ended up with a question I don&#39;t think you intended me to have: why was Decima unable to hold the spirit? It didn&#39;t seem that powerful. Maybe if it had screwed up the canon more, I might buy that it couldn&#39;t be controlled as easily. But there&#39;s nothing to suggest that this particular authorwraith is more powerful than any other Bad Slash spirit.<br><br>I hope that helped, and I look forward to your next missions.</p>

            <p>PoorCynic, I salute you!<br><br>First off, I am glad that you enjoyed the mission.<br><br>Second, you are right, I probably could have fleshed out Decima some more.  If it is any consolation, I intend to bring her back in future missions, so I can fix that more at a later date.  I will consider how best to set her apart from the rest of the snarky agents.<br><br>Third, it hadn&#39;t occurred to me that the ending might be a bit contrived.  I can see the point, now that you mention it.  It has been done before.  <br><br>I do have a reason why Decima&#39;s circle was unable to hold the wraith.  It seems to me that exorcisms require a lot of faith.  Most agents have faith that exorcisms work this way because they have seen it work a hundred times.  However, Decima is native to Potterverse, where spectacle and props are generally unnecessary to make magic work.  She therefore has a hard time believing that the exorcism methods of the PPC could possibly work better than a simple spell could.  Usually that isn&#39;t a problem.  This wraith was just a little stronger than average, resulting in the issues in the mission.<br><br>I was simply unable to find a place to put all of that information in the mission, being that the characters are unaware of the mechanics.  Perhaps Decima finding her faith could be something to explore.<br><br>Again, thank you so much.  This is the kind of critique that allows a writer to grow.</p>

            <p>Hey, guys. I suppose you were starting to think the earth had swallowed me up or something, but I have been buried in writing projects like you wouldn&#39;t <i>believe</i>. Been taking up all my free time. Not the least of which projects... is this one.<br><br>First up, grab a handkerchief, then click this link.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6589573/1/"><i>Fade to Black</i></a>, by Clear Dawnlight (Good Omens).<br><br>Read it. From beginning to end. Break down. Cry.<br><br>Now. For reasons you can probably guess, it was completely impossible for me to get that story out of my head. So, finally, I gathered my courage, and asked the author for permission to write a sequel, as a kind of personal therapy. That is to say, I never intended to post it anywhere, and told her so. This permission was readily granted, with the single condition that I send that sequel to her when it was done, because she was interested in reading it. As far as I was concerned, that was perfect.<br><br>Only a few days later, Clear Dawnlight informed me that she, too, had started work on a sequel to her story. Both stories, you can take my word for it, were completed without either one of us consulting or directing the other in any way. When we were both finished, we started mailing each other our stories, one chapter a day. In the course of this, she told me that she didn&#39;t want me to keep mine locked in a drawer for eternity, so to speak, and that she wanted me to put it online. Needless to say, I was overjoyed by this.<br><br>So now, after one month, all in all, of dedicated work for both of us, Clear Dawnlight and I proudly present you with the results of our efforts.<br><br>Here&#39;s her sequel, which will update every Saturday:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6848642/1/"><i>Resurgemus</i></a><br><br>And here&#39;s mine, which will update every Sunday:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6851091/1/Broken_Treasure"><i>Broken Treasure</i></a><br><br>Clear Dawnlight and I set out to do the very best we could, and we *puts on her sunglasses* have succeeded. Marvel at what two different minds will do when faced with the same challenge.<br><br>Enjoy, boys and girls. Consider this a reminder of what fanfiction can truly be.<br><br>Ciao...</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve got something up, since you&#39;ve been working on it so long.<br><br>I don&#39;t agree with July that it&#39;s first-draft-ish, but rather the opposite: I think it&#39;s a bit over-written for what it is. As I understand the sequence of things, none of the crew are going to survive to Chapter One, so I don&#39;t understand your choice to spend so much time emphasizing how fat Aldebourne is, for instance. It doesn&#39;t seem to come into play at all except to give Michael something to complain about, but that&#39;s something that could have been said once and left alone in favor of getting on with the plot. I&#39;m a patient reader, and I&#39;m all for establishing character and scene, but not when I&#39;m pretty sure it isn&#39;t going to matter once the actual story starts.<br><br>If I turn out to be mistaken and we see these guys again, I&#39;ll eat my words, but that&#39;s my feeling right now. The writing is technically very good, but heavy-handed.

I&#39;ve read a lot of books where the prologue consists entirely of characters who either die or are never seen again on-page. The actual chapters will be more focussed.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>PPC missions are a good example of stories in which the ending is pretty much a given, but the story can still be surprising.

            <p>KG. Let me start by saying that I liked this story.<br><br>Let me continue by saying that July is right that there are problems with it. Every one of her points is valid, to some extent- this story lacks real polish, the repetition is annoying, and it does not measure up to the works posted by hS. Oh, and early colonists were not restricted on bringing invasive plants or species to the New World. The House Sparrow, which has helped contribute to the decline of the Blue Bird population, was introduced from Europe to eat bugs that were eating crops.<br><br>Far more worrying than anything else, at least to me, is the complete and total lack of anything funny. The first section is downright bleak, talking about the vast emtiness of space and being overall depressing. While I certainly don&#39;t believe that everything about the PPC should be zany humor (I do, in fact, like mixing humor with serious situations) this story has nothing in the way of anything funny happening. That worries me.<br><br>Still, I did enjoy reading it. If this were an original piece of fiction, versus back-story for the PPC, my biggest single problem with it, the lack of humor, would be irrelevant. I would still agree, however, that a bit more polish would be prudent. July is quite right in that regard.</p>

            <p>What I mean is, your writing in that is okay. Nothing more. It&#39;s not all that great, it&#39;s not terrible, it&#39;s just mediocre; and sort of disappointing for that fact, especially since you said you were consulting with him and it was edited, and you spent a year before this generally discussing. <br><br>It doesn&#39;t read like you took a year to discuss it, and it doesn&#39;t even read like it&#39;s much more beyond a first draft with an initial editing, which is never the feel I got from Reorganisation or Crashing Down, and is something I&#39;d come to associate with this sort of background writing. That, y&#39;know, if it&#39;s going to be written, that it&#39;s going to be novel quality writing despite being a fannish work, and this just isn&#39;t.</p>

            <p>KGarrett has a different writing style, that is to be expected. If you have issues, take them up with hS.

            <p>No, I do not jump all over him for anything these days, and I have no interest in picking on him or others. If you want to talk to someone about picking on others, talk to KG in regards to Chliever, or any of the other newbies he tries to smack down whenever he feels courageous.<br><br>As to actual concrit, the only thing I can say good about the story is that it is free of technical errors. I can&#39;t say anyhtihing else in praise of it because it reads like a first draft. It needs fine tuning. I can&#39;t pinpoint every single sentence or phrase that makes it feel like a first draft because then I&#39;d be spending time on doing something I don&#39;t feel like doing. It feels like a first draft. It reads like a first draft. It needs to be refined and polished. This is not an outright dismissal. It reads poorly because it doesn&#39;t feel like he took the time to go over it a few more times to get it just right. This isn&#39;t a regular spin-off piece and it should have more time and effort devoted to making it just right.<br><br>Nowhere did I pick at his personal writing style, unless his personal writing style is to write something and then say &#39;That&#39;s it! I&#39;m done! It&#39;s finished forever, it just needs a quick edit! No second or third or fourth draft!&#39;. As I said, what I, and probably others, have come to expect from PPC backstories is work that&#39;s novel quality.<br><br>When it feels like a first draft it is not novel quality, and no professional writer will stop at a first draft.  Stoping at a first draft after an edit is okay for a mission, and that comprises most of my mission works. But I know others like Neshomeh who do not stop at a first draft, and they continue rewriting and fine tuning until it is exactly right, and is the quality they expect from a professional work.<br><br>As far as picking and choosing goes, I do not &#39;pick and choose&#39; who I reply to with honesty. As I recall, you&#39;ve even agreed that you trust me as far as what I say because I&#39;m not going to lie about what I think. If I reply, I&#39;m going to be honest regardless. I have no problem giving concrit, so don&#39;t try to frame me as a bully because KG&#39;s work was found wanting in some spots. <br></p>

            <p>People can and do still write missions for porn fics.  I&#39;ve done several in the last year (with probably varying levels of success in the humor department). I can think of at least a few others who have written missions to fics that if they weren&#39;t purely porn fics, then they were very high on the sex content, and often very NSFW.  I think this type of content tends to be more common in Bad Slash than DMS, but isn&#39;t exclusive.<br><br>Like Neshomeh said, it isn&#39;t that you can&#39;t do a mission to an NSFW fic, it&#39;s that you have to be able to make it humorous. <br><br>(Anyway, I hope I&#39;m not bandwagoning too much here.)</p>

            <p>A couple of factors are in play here. First, &quot;Celebrian&quot; has the benefit of being utterly, nonsensically ridiculous, so yeah, there was plenty of humor potential.<br><br>Second, a bit of PPC history. The mission to &quot;Celebrian&quot; inadvertently kicked off a bit of a &quot;who can PPC the worst squick?&quot; competitive mentality, which pretty quickly resulted in Do Not Want, so the active Boarders at the time put their collective foot down about that sort of thing: a) Like I said, squick, however squicky, does not necessarily make a good mission, and b) Your Kink Is Not My Kink, and if it&#39;s not your kink, you&#39;re not going to be objective about the subject matter, so you shouldn&#39;t PPC it. (Granted, we&#39;re all a little biased about what can and can&#39;t be done in our fandoms, but most of us still have the capacity to realize that most ideas <i>can</i> be done well--even Girl Falls Into Middle-earth.)<br><br>As everyone who&#39;s commented has agreed, it&#39;s incredibly unlikely that this fic is anyone&#39;s real kink, and if it were, I&#39;d suppose that abortion is such a touchy subject that it would be dangerous to admit it. Therefore, this one is best left alone.<br><br>In retrospect, I realize I may have come down too hard on this subject because of my previous experience with the poster, so I apologize for that, but I&#39;m not backing down about the logging in thing. Someone who consistently refuses to be identified, even by a made-up penname, makes me very nervous.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I understand. As far as I know, I&#39;m not related to the other anonymous poster that you are talking about. I&#39;m just a bit on the shy side and don&#39;t think that I can actually live up to PPC standards- I can&#39;t write a decent story, (PPC, fanfic, original, or otherwise) so I thought it might help if I acted as an informant of sorts. I see now that it would be a better idea to get a username and everything so I won&#39;t be mistaken for a troll or something. I will also try to remember that some stories do not deserve to be PPC&#39;d. Hopefully I&#39;ll meet you all later as a proper member and some targets that aren&#39;t like...this.</p>

            <p>I think that from now on,I&#39;ll take the username &quot;Watcher&quot;, since the best I can do is to watch for potential candidates for the PPC. So if you see me again, just give me a little guidance here; I did read a few of the spinoffs, but in retrospect I may have been missing the point of the PPC as a whole. Again, my apologies to anyone who has been appalled by the story that I have foolishly posted. </p>

            <p>You know, I&#39;ve never written a PPC spin-off. Neither have quite a few of our regulars. You&#39;re very much welcome to be a part of the community without having a spin-off; you&#39;re not in any way -less- a part of the community for not having a series of your own.

            <p>quoted from <br><br><a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/9XcyjE/terribleminds.com/ramble/2010/10/12/beware-of-writer/"><a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/9XcyjE/terribleminds.com/ramble/2010/10/12/beware-of-writer/">http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/9XcyjE/terribleminds.com/ramble/2010/10/12/beware-of-writer/</a></a><br><br>I‚Äôve seen a meme bouncing around that reveals reasons why you shouldn‚Äôt ever date a writer. It‚Äôs true, to a point. But I think it goes even deeper than that. Frankly, you should probably get the hell away from us. Anybody. Not just the people we date. But everybody. See us in line at the grocery store? Run, don‚Äôt walk. Escape. Avoid. Awooga, awooga. On a good day, we‚Äôre eccentric troublemakers. On a bad day, we‚Äôre malevolent sociopaths. And with writers, it‚Äôs usually a bad day.<br><br>So. Here‚Äôs a little post to clarify why you should stay at least 50 feet away from us at all times, lest we sink our vampire teeth into your body and drain you of all the things that made you pure and good. See, the things that make us good writers?<br><br>They make us awful people.<br><br>Imagine a sign around our necks:<br><br>BEWARE OF WRITER.<br><br>The Glass Is Not Half-Empty, But Rather, Full Of Badger Piss<br><br>We are all pessimists, cynics, hypochondriacs and conspiracy theorists. In our fiction, the world must be broken. We must think of the worst. It‚Äôs what fuels the fire. Nobody wants to read a story about happy ponies sipping from the molasses pond and then they all dance and have all the hay they want and rainbows and bags of gold and leprechauns and *poop noise* ‚Äî that‚Äôs just pap. Twee, waffling pap. Fiction demands that we go to the well and draw up the most stagnant water we can find, and so we look for the worst in the world around us. We get used to it. We accept it as the norm. We know the worst can happen. We know it because we write about it. Some dude will come up behind you on the park bench and saw your head off. Your plane? Gonna crash. That mole in your armpit? ARMPIT CANCER.<br><br>Please Ignore Our Forked Tongues<br><br>We are lying liars who lie. We have to be. Fiction is a lie. Non-fiction is, in its own way, a lie. When writing, deception is a skill. This, like so much of the thread that goes into our wretched quilt, trails into our real lives and ensures that the best writers make the most powerful liars. We can convince you of anything. We don‚Äôt mean to. It‚Äôs just ‚Äî well, it‚Äôs like John Cusack‚Äôs character says in Grosse Pointe Blank:<br><br>Martin: You do it because you are trained to do it, you have the strength to do it and the courage to do it‚Ä¶ and ultimately (pause) you get to like it. I know that sounds bad.<br><br>Debi: You‚Äôre a psychopath.<br><br>Martin: No, no, no. Psychopaths kill for no reason, I kill for money, it‚Äôs a job ‚Äî that didn‚Äôt sound right.<br><br>For the record, if you don‚Äôt like that movie, you‚Äôre dead to me.<br><br>I lie to my wife all the time, by the way. Not in bad ways. I‚Äôve learned to control my foul serpent‚Äôs tongue. Now I just see if I can convince her of truly egregious lies. Like, I once convinced her I was born with a tail? I know, horrible, right? But at least I‚Äôm not lying about, you know, real shit. That‚Äôs what I tell myself.<br><br>You Are Wrong About Everything, Even When You‚Äôre Not<br><br>We make shit up all day long, and then we must write about that made-up shit with utter authority. It is our job to write with abject confidence in the subject matter. You know in high school you‚Äôd write papers that were, as you might say, ‚Äúbullshit?‚Äù And you could convince the teacher of it? Yeah. This is like that. Except we start to believe that our confidence in information extends beyond the written page.<br><br>And so we frequently believe ourselves to be right.<br><br>Like, beyond the pale.<br><br>‚ÄúYes,‚Äù you say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure that the guy who played on the show, Frasier, is Lee Marvin‚Äôs son.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúNo, no, it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm sure of it.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs right‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWELL YOU‚ÄôRE STUPID AND YOUR HEAD IS STUPID. Remember how wrong you were about that thing seven weeks ago?‚Äù We like to do this. God forbid we‚Äôre actually ever right about something because dang will we hold onto that like a squirrel with a nut. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right. I‚Äôm a writer. It‚Äôs even in the word. It used to be spelled R-I-G-H-T-E-R. It‚Äôs my job to know things.‚Äù<br><br>No, it‚Äôs your job to make shit up and pretend it‚Äôs true. But the lines? They blur.<br><br>Conflict And Misery Make For A Much Better Story!<br><br>In life, we avoid conflict. In fiction, we strive for it. Except, remember how I said something about the lines blurring? Mmm. Yeah. We get to a state where escalation and drama feel normal. We work to achieve those things so diligently that it‚Äôs hard to snap out of that mode. In a fight, we‚Äôre likelier to escalate beyond the point of rationality because ‚Äî hey, whoever is up there in Never-Never-Land reading this Book Of Your Life is going to appreciate your attention to these details. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù your imaginary cosmic reader says, ‚Äúnow break that plate! Do it! Kick the car door and put a dent in it! Conflict! Escalation! Drama!‚Äù<br><br>Of course, no such cosmic reader exists.<br><br>Our lives are not big books.<br><br>But don‚Äôt tell us that, or we‚Äôll stab you in the thigh with a #2 pencil.<br><br>Ich Bin Ein Puppetmeister<br><br>We control our characters. Don‚Äôt believe the nonsense that we‚Äôre swept away the Muse and the characters control us. Pshhh. Naw. Nuh-uh. We‚Äôre the puppetmasters. And so in life, we get confused when we can‚Äôt control you and everyone else around us. Oh, I didn‚Äôt say we wouldn‚Äôt try, though.<br><br>The Writer Is A Creepy Loner<br><br>We do so well alone that we don‚Äôt always do so well with other people. If we were a dog, the warning on our kennel door would say, ‚ÄúNot Socialized.‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt Play Well With Others.‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúWill Stab You In The Thigh With A Pencil.‚Äù We don‚Äôt so much like being solitary. It‚Äôs just our natural state. So when you finally find us, we‚Äôre naked, covered in our own filth, picking bits of ham and apple pie crust out of our chest hairs. We are basically some genetic combination between ‚Äúearthworm‚Äù and ‚ÄúBigfoot.‚Äù<br><br>Bigworm. Or Earthfoot.<br><br>Snuggle Up With Mental Illness<br><br>When writing, a little dab of mental illness is a feature, not a bug. Our obsessions and neuroses drive us to the word count with the verve and tenacity of a crack-addled howler monkey. Our depressive tendencies, provided they allow us to get out of bed, show us a broken world, and as noted, a broken world is particularly good for our fiction. Our Narcissism and megalomania helps us get through the day by convincing us we‚Äôre actually really awesome at this, yeah, ... yeah, woooo, and then those depressive tendencies kick in again and bring us back to earth and drive us to improve, improve, improve our shit-ass-crap-twat writing. We‚Äôre like addicts, pinballing back and forth between uppers and downers, smart drugs and hallucinogens. Thing is, when not writing, a little dab of mental illness is a big ol‚Äô bug and not much of a feature (outside our ability to entertain others with our misery and melodrama).<br><br>Like A Photograph, We Will Steal Your Souls<br><br>Just as we are liars, we are also thieves. Your life is our fiction. Oh, no, we don‚Äôt steal it on purpose. As noted: we have compulsions. That whole write-what-you-know thing? It‚Äôs not advice. It‚Äôs a curse. Don‚Äôt worry. We won‚Äôt use your soul exactly as it has been taken. We‚Äôll ... with it first. Molest it with our greasy ham-hands. Of course, you‚Äôll be reading something and say, ‚ÄúIs that me?‚Äù<br><br>And the writer will say, ‚ÄúNo, no, of course not.‚Äù<br><br>Because the writer is a stinky poo-poo liar who ...ing lies.<br><br>Our Writing Is A Temple: Do Not Defile It Lest You Rouse The Anger Of The Gods<br><br>We elevate our writing to sacred cosmic necessity. If you befoul the temple with your distraction ‚Äî even if that distraction is, say, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm being eaten to death by mice over here, so if you could maybe kick a few of these guys off of me?‚Äù ‚Äî you will earn our wrath. ‚ÄúNo, I cannot help you with your bullshit flesh-eating mouse problem I TOLD YOU I WAS WRITING JESUS CHRIST YOU DON‚ÄôT RESPECT ME.‚Äù<br><br>Last But Not Least, We‚Äôll Try To Force You To Read Our Shit<br><br>‚ÄúHere,‚Äù we‚Äôll say, dropping a 50-lb. manuscript in your lap. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my masterpiece.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù you‚Äôll respond.<br><br>‚ÄúRead it.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs awfully big.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúYeah, but read it anyway.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOkay. I have some things to take care of first like, say, getting these mice to stop boring holes in my flesh.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúSweet.‚Äù<br><br>Two days later, we return: ‚ÄúDid you read it?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúOW THE MICE ARE IN MY BRAIN‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI guess that‚Äôs a no.‚Äù <br>‚ÄúCHEWING MY SYNAPSES‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúPshh. You don‚Äôt respect me and my work.‚Äù<br><br>Then we storm out.<br><br>(It‚Äôs Not All That Bad)<br><br>Okay, yeah, we‚Äôre sort of apeshit moonbat, but once we become aware of our, umm, danger signs, we can mitigate our worst behaviors. But still, let this serve as a warning. Writers sometimes seem brightly colored and fascinating, but really, those are just nature‚Äôs way of warning you off. We‚Äôre like tropical toads. Oh so pretty! Want to touch the toady! Except: poisonous skin that kills with one touch.<br><br>Beware of writer.</p>

            <p>But this excerpt by Ursula Le Guin says it pretty well:<br><br><i>The weather bureau will tell you what next Tuesday will be like, and the Rand Corporation will tell you what the twenty-first century will be like. I don&#39;t recommend that you turn to the writers of fiction for such information. It&#39;s none of their business. All they&#39;re trying to do is tell you what they&#39;re like, and what you&#39;re like - what&#39;s going on - what the weather is now, today, this moment, the rain, the sunlight, look! Open your eyes; listen, listen. That is what the novelists say. But they don&#39;t tell you what you will see and hear. All they can tell you is what they have seen and heard, in their time in this world, a third of it spent in sleep and dreaming, another third of it spent in telling lies.<br><br>&quot;The truth against the world!&quot; --Yes. Certainly. Fiction writers, at least in their braver moments, do desire the truth: to know it, speak it, serve it. But they go about it in a peculiar and devious way, which consists in inventing persons, places, and events which never did and never will exist or occur, and telling about these fictions in detail and at length and with a great deal of emotion, and then when they are done writing down this pack of lies, they say, There! That&#39;s the truth!<br><br>They may use all kinds of facts to support their tissue of lies. They may describe the Marshalsea Prison, which was a real place, or the battle of Borodino, which really was fought, or the process of cloning, which really takes place in laboratories, or the deterioration of a personality, which is described in real textbooks of psychology, and so on. This weight of verifiable place-event-phenomenon-behavior makes the reader forget that he is reading pure invention, a history that never took place anywhere but in that unlocalizable region, the author&#39;s mind. In fact, while we read a novel, we are insane - bonkers. We believe in the existence of people who aren&#39;t there, we hear their voices, we watch the battle of Borodino with them, we may even become Napoleon. Sanity returns (in most cases) when the book is closed.<br><br>Is it any wonder that no truly respectable society has ever trusted its artists?</i></p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s called FANfiction.net for a reason. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s confusion, either, all the other stuff on their profile is actual fanfiction. (Well, fanfic for Twilight, which reads like a badly written fanfiction itself, but that&#39;s not really the point.)<br>...I don&#39;t know, really. Probably laziness to check the rules properly, like you said.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d like to say things like this are caused by honest confusion, though that is a sign of being too lazy to read the content guidelines.<br>Mind you, we know that many writers on there don&#39;t read them, if only because the content guidelines <i>also</i> instruct writers to spellcheck and proofread their work, use proper formatting and respect their reviewers.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d also say confusion and laziness. Usually more of the latter than the former. And yes, unfortunately, many writers choose to completely ignore guidelines.<br><br>Just as an aside, is there a fairly prestigious site for original fiction?</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve never been on fictionPress, but from what I gather it&#39;s very much the sister site of ff.n<br><a href="http://www.elfwood.com/">Elfwood</a> has a section for writing. Not all the stuff on there is good, but it&#39;s quite heavily moderated, which I think cuts out the really awful stuff.</p>

            <p><i>Blacksad</i> is a European detective noir comic series, written by two Spanish writers but released in French first, about the cases of a detective named John Blacksad. The comic is drawn with anthropomorphic animal characters (Blacksad himself being a tuxedo cat, and his sidekick Weekly a weasel) but very much not for children - it has as much sex and violence as you&#39;d expect from something of the same genre done with humans. Despite the &quot;lol furries&quot; stigma it&#39;s beautifully done; thrilling, sad, and funny in equal measures, and featuring some excellent watercolour artwork.<br><br>I am required to love it because it has a weasel. D&#39;awww, weasels <sup>_^</sup> Sadly, it&#39;s almost impossible to find Anglophones who&#39;ve heard of it, and I don&#39;t speak enough French or Spanish to investigate any other languages&#39; fandom communities.</p>

            <p>Indeed, dear friends, I&#39;ve managed to scavenge up a copy of Celebrian by using the dark wizardry internet archiving. The only question left to ask is who wants to host it?

            <p>I suppose there will always someone who needs physical - or digital - evidence of just how bad some of this stuff is. meh.<br><br>Anyway, Google Docs has this notice: &quot;When uploading files, you agree to abide by the Google Docs Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

            <p>The original author has no copyright. He or she was writing fanfiction, which is mooching off published works that do have copyright.  When fanfic writers put up that disclaimer at the beginning of the fic, they are disclaiming any copyright.  <br><br>Plagiarism of fanfic is still a very very bad thing, please don&#39;t think that I&#39;m promoting that, but fanfic operates in the grey area of &#39;I&#39;m not messing with your copyright here&#39;, which becomes much less grey in the favor of the actual copyright holder (the canon author) when fanfic writers start talking about copyright.</p>

            <p>4chan is this massive, nigh-on totally unrestricted imageboard, full to the brim with trolls, hackers, internet vigilantes, and other disreputable types, all totally anonymous. One description I&#39;ve heard is &#39;the Mois Eisley of the Internet&#39;, and it&#39;s pretty damn accurate. Y&#39;know the Rules of the Internet? It&#39;s the list that Rules 34 and 35 come from. Replace every instance of &#39;the internet&#39; with &#39;4chan&#39;, and you&#39;ll get some idea. Well over half the memes on the web come from the depths of 4chan, including Lolcats, Rickrolling, and Chocolate Rain, and those are just the highlights. They&#39;re also notable for being banned in at least half a dozen countries, Rickrolling the Church of Scientology in real life, and spamming the servers in the Australian Parliment with porn until every Australian government site in existance crashed.<br><br>Nasty.<br><br>P.S. Incidentally, the first Rule of the Internet is &#39;You do not talk about (4chan).&#39; Second Rule of the Internet: &#39;You do <i>not</i> talk about (4chan).&#39; Keep in mind that you didn&#39;t hear <i>any</i> of this from me...</p>

So they do run rampant.<br><br>But not everywhere. And not every anon is a troll or hacker or disreputable. Anonymous is defined not as an identity, but as the content it puts forward.

            <p>Look for example at Shadow Crystal Mage&#39;s fanfictions. Card Captor Harry, while you can think it&#39;s completely wrong as a crossover, is one of the funniest thing I&#39;ve ever read. And his (or her? Didn&#39;t manage to find any indication about gender.) crackfics are the best. &quot;Takamachi Nanoha of 2814&quot; is EPIC.</p>

            <p>...and I cannot imagine liking any story that tried to cross it with the Halo universe.

            <p>The original light novels were actually slightly better than the anime, at least if the unofficial translations that I read were accurate. (I&#39;d provide a link, but they were removed after the novels were licensed for American distribution).<br><br>Anyway, there were also a couple of vignettes, entirely unrelated to the actual storyline, where Haruhi and company somehow ended up as characters in various settings: a Final-Fantasy-type adventure, a Star-Trek-like space opera, and I think a Wild West scenario. Combine this with the fact that almost my entire knowledge of Halo comes from watching Red Vs. Blue...<br><br>Yeah, it&#39;d probably involve multiplayer-mode, death-is-cheap hijinks, utter confusion on the part of the underlings, and the expected dose of Haruhi-related hilarity. If that makes any sense at all.</p>
