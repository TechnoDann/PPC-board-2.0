            <p>Most missions I have seen are on completed fics; however, I was wondering how to take care of an ongoing fic. (Even if the storyline isn&#39;t finished, it seems that most of the fics that are sporked have not updated in several months.)<br><br>The reason for my questioning is that a number of terrible fanfictions I have seen are both recent and ongoing. Does the PPC have a specific way to spork these?<br><br>Sorry if my question was stupid...<br><br>Also sorry if my usage of semicolons was wrong, I failed that lesson in my grammar course three times. <br><br>(Not really, I just have problems with commas.

            <p>I can attest to the fact that there&#39;s no difference between a fic being finished and it not being finished. If a new development comes up in a fic in progress that comes across as incredibly stupid, it can certainly affect the length of the mission, but otherwise there&#39;s no difference.<br><br>I&#39;ve had four missions total where I began them while the fic was still in progress, and nothing really changed all that much. </p>

            <p>Sometimes I take on a fic-in-progress if that fic has already done something to totally break the canon. What I do then is take a &#39;snapshot&#39; of sorts when I start a mission. If I begin a mission and chapters 1-4 are posted, I spork only chapters 1-4 regardless of what other chapters or edits are posted in the meantime. <br><br>This is because I usually have an idea of where the mission is going, and if I tack on more and more content, it ruins the run of the plot. Like any story, once I reach the climax, there&#39;s going to be falling action. I don&#39;t want to have to pick up, say &#39;just kidding, there is more&#39; and keep going.</p>

            <p>...that there pretty much is no difference. Granted, I&#39;m not official, but I&#39;ve read a lot of PPC fics and it doesn&#39;t seem to matter either way; the PPC still interrupts it after gathering enough charges and kills the Sue. After that, even if the fic continues, the Suefluence is gone (unless there&#39;s a sequel to it, in which case the Sue must be executed a second time).<br>So there&#39;s my thoughts on the subject.<br>Oh, and I don&#39;t know about anywhere else, but I think you used the semicolon just right in this post. If in doubt, however, I&#39;d just separate it into different sentences...or Google semicolon usage. Whatever floats your boat.</p>

            <p>More than two agents completely changes how you have to handle a mission, who does what, and a great deal of dynamics.

            <p>All I need is to flesh out my agents and request a permission to spork the living daylights out of this badfic.<br><br>My agents are as follows:<br><br>-a rogue Shadow Mirror soldier from the SRW universe who is also a mech pilot. He &#39;s a bit obsessed about his Gespenst and kills Mary Sues and Gary Stus as a &#39;healthy&#39; and &#39;fun&#39; alternative of spreading the words of Social Darwinism and eternal war. He carries around with him a wide variety of knives, pistols, and grenades.<br><br>-a Viera White Mage from the FF: Tactics Advance. She mastered White and Elemental Magic but encounters a lot of problems in using her magic outside her home continuum (half-baked powers occasionally). She may look calm and collected all of the time but she is much more insane than her partner since she uses a staff that is meant to save people as a killing weapon.</p>

            <p>FFTA characters who have mastered all the skills for a class are immensely powerful- and you&#39;re saying she has mastered two classes? You also tell us she is insane and has a bloodlust. While being immensely powerful (even though it doesn&#39;t work out of her home canon.)<br><br>Beyond that, you have a guy from an evil organization with a mecha, who is not reformed in the least, who is still engaging in things that he views as aiding the evil cause. <br><br>From what I&#39;ve seen on the board, I&#39;m not sure you&#39;d be able to handle having two agents like that right off the bat. One of your previous agent ideas was powerful <i>and</i> questionable; you even acknowledged it might offend people. <br><br>You&#39;ve also been rather eager with killing things and general violence (and torture), rather than focusing on the how and why a fic is bad. <br><br>Consider having normal people for your first set, if you get permission. Don&#39;t go for strong and powerful and unique. Go for normal people. Use yourself as an agent. <br><br>The best spinoffs I have read, my true favorites, they don&#39;t rely on their agent being the very best of something, or being able to go into some sort of overkill mode against anything. There is one main reason why I like them so much, and why others tend to like them so much.<br><br>The agents in those spinoffs have personalities. They are intelligent. They are creative. They are, essentially, <i>people</i>.  This is what makes them a cut above. They don&#39;t rely on power to withstand something or to sort a fic out. They rely on their wherewithal, their stubbornness, their intent to make things right. <br><br>Agent Fritz and Agent Nume? They don&#39;t need fancy stuff, power, or some sort of vaguely dangerous but &#39;cool&#39; attribute to back them up. <br><br>Relying on those things does not improve you as a writer, because they are crutches. <br><br>Think on it.<br></p>

            <p>Again, seriously, chill out with the posting. You are going overboard with this. We- well, me- have asked you to knock it off with spamming with badfic and threads. We have also corrected you with your initial post asking about your agents and a sample thing, and again once more when you made a new thread for such.  <br><br>It&#39;s obvious that you&#39;re excited about finding the PPC because badfic is terrible and the PPC is cool, shiny, neato, and other adjectives that imply positive connotations. We all know that badfic is terrible. It wouldn&#39;t be bad if it weren&#39;t. <br><br>However, you are making a lot of really obvious mistakes that would not happen if you took the time to calm down a bit and read instead of diving headfirst. It will save you from being corrected repeatedly if you actually take the time and effort to read things on there, as well as maybe lurk here on the board for a bit to see how people behave and act. <br><br> We have a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Unclaimed_Badfic">page</a> on the wiki just for putting badfics for people to peruse. We have a lot of stuff on the wiki that is there for you to read that will prevent you from making very basic mistakes. The wiki, for the most part, also can give you an idea of what the tone and general approach we have here. We do not scream for torture and swear all the naughty words we learned and a few we just made up until we turn blue in the face and topple over due to forgetting to breathe. <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/Constitution.htm">Read our rules (again, if you already have done so).</a><br><br>We like newbies. I like newbies (despite whatever scoffing some people might be making right now). We aren&#39;t quite sure what to do, however, with people who are so excited they run into everything headlong screaming their name and  engaging in the eating of chicken while ignoring everyone shouting &#39;Noooooo!&#39;. <br><br>If you have AIM, YIM, MSN, I have those on when I&#39;m not at work, and you&#39;re welcome to contact and add me at fairladypsyche for AIM and YIM. Add a @hotmail.com to that for MSN. My email should be clickable on my name for this if you want to ask any questions or anything. <br><br>Please don&#39;t feel hurt because of this big long post thing that just went and told you &#39;no, bad&#39;, for the most part. We like newbies, we really do, but this will just help everything run smoother in the long run.</p>

            <p>Though the author disrespected the Naruto fandom by putting a self-inserted Jerkass!Stu who rapes and tortures Sakura (who is, in the Stu&#39;s fantasy land, his girlfriend. One example: he ordered her to mutilate her own vagina.). A lot of characters died so many times and somehow resurrected for no apparent reason. Bent the laws of Biology so many times that it makes quack Biologists look smart. And the author also disrespected his reviewers by flaming all of them and tries to imply that all of his reviewers are idiots.<br><br>Oh and the author have some bias with the norms of the Real World like religion, sexuality, economics, etc... etc...<br><br>Sorry for cussing and swearing.

            <p>Okay, currently I have one idea for my agent.<br><br>The first one is a mercenary from Fallout. He is recruited from a badfic and always wear a gas mask (The fic doesn&#39;t explain this, but he admitted it because of facial problems). He is quite paranoid and always keep a gun handy. He wears balaclava inside the mask, probably so he can eat while keeping his face hidden.

            <p>...it seems okay (granted, I only looked at the first two chapters). I do have a couple of issues with it, mainly relating to the use of &quot;Danger&quot; as a name the OC answers to. Who answers to &quot;Danger&quot; in a normal life like the one she presumably had before the fic began? The prophecy thing could also be a problem if she misplays it. However, she seems to have thought this through rather well. Not my cup of cocoa, storyline-wise, but well-written.<br>Grammar and spelling are exemplary, though; I didn&#39;t see a single mistake in the first two chapters.<br>If you&#39;re wondering if she needs PPCing, probably not. It&#39;s a pretty well-written AU and the grammar and spelling issues are non-issues with this one.</p>

            <p>No, the PPC does not have a twitter account; that would involve someone making one for the PPC and taking charge of it, which would inevitably lead to- as PPCers are wont to do- them forgetting about it and nothing ever being done with it or it being used for bad and/or stupid things.<br><br>Doing twitter accounts on your own is no big thing.

            <p>I can tell you, at least on Heather, that I don&#39;t consider her that special. I&#39;ve read the mission in question (since I follow the exploits of Cadmar and company) and there really isn&#39;t that much special about Heather- she&#39;s a wraith, and long term possession has been known to cause nasty side effects. Granted, genderbending is unique, and yes, I was (slightly) on the fence on this one. However, her uniqueness seems to mostly deal with her importance to Cadmar, and the consensus us reviewers came to was that Sues whose only importance is to individual agents are not (usually) notable. I&#39;d like to know what others think about this. If the community really likes this page, well, I think we should keep it. <br><br>As for Emily... maybe. Others should weigh in on that too, but I&#39;m much less on the fence with her.</p>

            <p>Strictly my own opinions:<br><br>The thing with Heather is that she managed to posses Cadmar because of a faulty dummy. Which means that it had less to do with Heather and more to do with the dummy and the agents. It made for a superinteresting mission, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily translate to a superinteresting Sue.<br><br>About Emily: Wraits are well established, but I&#39;ll admit that I haven&#39;t seen other, who started out as OCs and then switched over to possessing a canon character. But it seem more like a variation on a theme, than something new.</p>

            <p>About what? As to who they are, or as to why they are being deleted/kept? If the former, I can provide links for all of them (although that&#39;s kind of time consuming, and they can all be found in the slain Sue category) but if the latter, well, I didn&#39;t even write down my reasons for deletions- it&#39;s a lot easier to say why a Sue should be kept than why it should be deleted, since keeping one involves something special you can point to, where as a deletions tend to be a <i>lack</i> of anything interesting to say about them.</p>

            <p>I am currently writing my introduction piece for my agent in DoI and I have (once again) a few questions to ask about background information. <br><br>Firstly, is Agent Bulldog is Architeuthis&#39; property? He is implied to be the one in charge of newbie training so he is scheduled to make an appearance in my spinoff. I don&#39;t want to fudge up the disclaimer...<br><br>Secondly, I am considering introducing a new gadget for Intel operatives: the Dead Ringer from the Team Fortress 2 universe (more info here: <a href="http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Dead_Ringer"><a href="http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Dead_Ringer">http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Dead_Ringer</a></a>). The function of this Spy watch is to drop a fake corpse and to cloak the user should he/she be harmed, allowing the Spy to make a quick getaway. This gadget would make it safer for spies disguised as an enemy to follow a Sue, as a Sue killing a canon enemy wouldn&#39;t arouse any suspicions. <br>For example, suppose a Spy in the Zeldaverse is disguised as a Moblin to follow a Sue. The Spy activates the Dead Ringer and then accidentally makes a loud noise. The Sue whips around and stabs the agent with a sword. The Spy is mostly shielded from the damage, rendered invisible for several seconds, and leaves a fake Moblin corpse impaled onto the Sue&#39;s sword. The Intel operative backs away to a safe location, uncloaks, and is able to continue his surveillance. May I introduce this to the PPC?<br><br>Lastly, I would also like to feature a variant on the Remote Activator. The current model is described as a metal stick having only three rings that can be rearranged to form up to 1000 combinations (10*10*10). I was thinking: how can 1000 combinations cover the entire multiverse and allow agents to portal to various locations inside the word world, let alone modify portal placement and size? My proposed variant would be almost identical in appearance to a graphing calculator, allowing agents to simply key in coordinates and modify portal properties with settings accessed by sub-menus. <br>I do feel rather apprehensive about this gadget though. After all, the RA is one of the PPC&#39;s signature technologies and I don&#39;t really want to impose too much of my own spinoff on other interpretations. Perhaps it can be part of a prototype test?   </p>

            <p>I&#39;m considering adding a Intelligence agent to my roster.  Have there ever been missions where an Intel agent goes in, checks out the first couple chapters of a fic, then hands it off to a team from one of the action departments?<br><br>Obviously this would only work for longer badfics.</p>

            <p>Handover in the fic sounds like someone got their messages crossed at HQ, but that <em>would</em> be believable.  Alternately, the Intel agent could find out the fic is worse than the summary made it sound, and decide to call for an action team right now instead of filing a report.<br><br>Post-investigation handover would be written as a two-part mission.  Part One, the Intel agent scouts the first few chapters of the fic; in Part Two the action team takes the Intel report (and any recommendations), goes through the later part of the fic to collect their own charges, and deals with the fic appropriately.<br><br>The reason I posted is because either I&#39;m clueless or there&#39;s no action missions following up on Architeuthis&#39; reports.  His report <em>is</em> the mission.  We can assume someone killed the Sues he reported on, but I was thinking about making the Intel-Action connection more obvious.</p>

            <p>Check out Architeuthis&#39;s missions on the wiki. The whole point of Intel is to check out the fics, then send them on to Action agents to actually deal with the Sue/slash/crossover/whatever if the fic is deemed bad enough to need it.</p>

            <p>... but it would be interesting to see an Intel operative call for a team during a mission and guide the assassins/disentanglers/bad slashers to their objectives. <br><br>It is to note that the Rules of Gathering Intelligence state that once a major abnormality is detected, the spy needs to come home immediately to send a report (Rule #4). My interpretation of the rules is that spies and agents go in at different times and are almost never together: a spy is there to judge, an agent team is there to correct.     </p>

            <p>One of my missions has an intel agent on a constant stakeout in a badfic, who assisted DMS agents in taking down a Sue.<br><br>This might be because the fic itself was unfinished and terminated in the middle of a chapter, so in my interpretation she stayed behind to keep &#39;going back to the beginning&#39; so the story didn&#39;t cut off, allowing the Sue to escape into the multiverse without a proper chapter end to bookend her inside her own badfic.<br><br>But that was just my take on it. It&#39;s no way the do all or end all of how we do things around here. So long as it doesn&#39;t contradict laid-down canon, I&#39;d say go for it.

            <p>Like Joe said, nothing is really standard around here, but I think the description you&#39;re referring to is less so than most. It&#39;s mentioned on the wiki article because it exists, I think, not so much because it represents the majority of the RA&#39;s representation. As the article says, &quot;However, as other descriptions involve setting portals to lock onto locations or specific people, either this describes a simple version of the RA (the one in question was sent to a recruit to allow him to reach HQ), or the dials are very, very versatile.&quot;<br><br>Personally, I&#39;ve always imagined it pretty much as you&#39;ve described it, a hand-held box with numbers and symbols on it, and a few other specific function buttons (&quot;Home in on Sue,&quot; for instance).<br><br>Where does the &quot;1000 combinations&quot; bit come from, though?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>For what it&#39;s worth, my internal view of the RA is pretty similar to Neshomeh&#39;s, some kind of cylinder (the core portal-making unit) with a screen attached to it for selecting a destination/function.<br><br>The 3-dials model could easily be viewed as a previous iteration, as opposed to a more simplistic variant... just a thought.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s generally asserted that there are few standard models for most of the PPC gadgets--in-universe there&#39;s a lot of explanations, but the out-of-universe explanation is that standardizing anything here would be counterproductive and lead to arguments over whose interpretation is right.<br><br>Naturally, I tried to bull through this with the C-CAD :P (Disclaimer: this is a joke; actual intention of making the C-CAD was quite different.)<br><br>So in short, there shouldn&#39;t be any problem with what you&#39;re talking about RE: the RA and I&#39;d actually be willing to help  with an idea of that sort in more detail. As my work attests, PPC tech is a fascination of mine.<br><br><br>Use of stuff like the Dead Ringer would be feasible but tricky. It wouldn&#39;t work so well in universes without hit points, after all--in Zelda this wouldn&#39;t be a concern but it might also simply be too high-tech for that canon. PPC tech usually gets around this caveat. There&#39;s also the fact that introducing too much new stuff means lots of it gets used once and never again.<br><br>What I&#39;m saying here, mind, is not &quot;no, don&#39;t do it&quot;. I don&#39;t actually have the authority to do that, for one (no one does)--you can do whatever you like in your spinoff. But I am saying you should consider carefully before you do--there may be another way to do what the Dead Ringer does, using the narrative instead of tech.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the answer! I&#39;ve already thought up of a few jokes concerning the prototype RA...<br><br>As for the use of the DR, I figured that the continuum can&#39;t provide the same amount of protection as the spy watch (it can only do so much to conceal agents) so that&#39;s why I was thinking of including it. Considering the level of tech around HQ like RAs, DORKS, and universal translation thingies, I kinda felt that the DR might not be that out of place... At least in my opinion. Though you do have a point about the use of the DR: I can&#39;t have Gaspard bump into a Sue every mission because it would kinda put his competence into question. </p>

            <p>See, I don&#39;t know that canon-- but when in doubt about how powerful you want your agent to be, just think carefully about <i>why</i>. Is being a White Mage a part of her character, her personality, her history? Is using Elemental Magic important to her storyline? Do you have confidence in your ability to write both the inherent strengths and weaknesses of this type of character well?<br><br>Ask yourself these questions, and be <i>honest</i>. A normal, average, non-powered human can be a bad fit for the PPC every bit as much as a Time Lord from a Harry Potter crossover. It&#39;s all in how they&#39;re written.<br><br>(Aaaand now I want to write an agent who&#39;s a Time Lord from the Potterverse. Gah, plotbunnies!)</p>

            <p>Hello, good people of the PPC posting board!<br><br>I discovered about the PPC existence a few weeks ago when I was surfing at Tvtropes. After that, I tried to discover more about the PPC, Mainly by looking at the wiki and reading mission logs. I am interested by the craziness and humor you guys have.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m a borderline hardcore gamer (Though it was cut off since my gaming laptop was broken), is an anime fan, likes both science fiction and fantasy, likes to follow popular memes, hates Mary Sues, and enjoys reading badfics (Especially ones riddled with bathos).<br><br>my fandoms consist of Fallout (Especially Fallout 2 and New Vegas), The Elder Scrolls (Oblivion only), Pokemon, Dwarf Fortress, Warhammer 40k (Never played the tabletop game, though), Marathon, Call of Duty (Modern Warfare sub-series only), Borderlands, Half Life, Team Fortress, Left 4 Dead, Mario,  Bleach, and Fairy Tail.<br><br>Alright, that probably summarize what kind of person I am. Please note that I&#39;m still learning the English language, so your feedback will be very important for me!<br><br>That&#39;s all for now, folks!<br></p>

            <p>I quite like your soon-to-be-agents.  They&#39;re funny together, and they each bring something to the table; I think they&#39;ll make a very entertaining trio of partners (assuming you&#39;ll be partnering them all together).<br><br>Now, there is something you&#39;re neglecting in this story: the semicolons.  Those poor, poor semicolons.  They want to help you connect sentences together, if only if you&#39;ll let them.  For example, one sentence you have:<br><br><i>&quot;The acolyte stirred and opened her eyes, the metal roof of the gymnasium was back, blocking off the sky.&quot;</i><br><br>should have a semicolon after &quot;eyes,&quot; and look like:<br><br><i>&quot;The acolyte stirred and opened her eyes; the metal roof of the gymnasium was back, blocking off the sky.&quot;</i><br><br>to separate the ideas &quot;The acolyte stirred and opened her eyes.&quot; and &quot;The metal roof of the gymnasium was back, blocking off the sky.&quot;  They could stand as sentences on their own, but when they combine into one sentence, they need a semicolon to separate them.  There are quite a few sentences here that need semicolons, as well as a few other grammatical errors here and there.  I would suggest reading through again and looking for them.  This community also happens to be an excellent source of beta readers, so don&#39;t be afraid to ask folks for help!</p>

            <p>Those semicolons really don&#39;t like me, neither do commas now that I think about it.  Those are my biggest problems, my spelling is fine and I&#39;d like to think I avoid run-on sentences, but commas and semi-colons get me every time.<br><br>I don&#39;t know what it is, but I have the darnedest time telling when and where I&#39;m supposed to put them.  I put a comma there because I thought that separated them, but as you clearly pointed out I was wrong.<br><br>I&#39;ll try to work on my semi-colons and commas, but please have some leniency when it comes to them as they are, as I&#39;ve said repeatedly, my greatest weakness.  I probably have those kinds of errors in this post and just can&#39;t see them.<br><br>On a more positive note;(I think I&#39;m supposed to put a semi-colon here but I&#39;m not sure) thank you for the praise.  I&#39;m very glad that you like my soon-to-be agents, took me forever to come up with them.  I was worried that Justin would be a problem what with having no universe but I guess that wasn&#39;t a problem after all.</p>

            <p>So, I found an entry in the wiki about the Department of Bad Parody, Troll Division, and I thought it would be a good idea to have my agents there.<br><br>However, there&#39;s only one spork listed under that Division, and it was written waaaay back in 2003.<br><br>So what I&#39;m asking is, would it be okay if I resurrected the Troll Division?</p>

            <p>I encourage this wholeheartedly. We have lots of DMS as it is. What criteria would a troll divison agent have to bear in mind? How would it be different from working with DMS?<br><br>I have been working on some ESAS concepts myself, and my original concept for my main agents was going to be Despatch, but I realized that bine of the stories I wanted to cover had SIs that could be safely relocated.<br><br>But yeah!

            <p>Hey there!<br><br>I&#39;m Mr. Eldritch- I found my way here from I can&#39;t remember where over a year ago, made a few posts, and promptly disappeared. Ninety percent of you probably don&#39;t remember me, and the remaining ten percent are likely mistaken and only think they do.<br><br>I&#39;ve since found my way back, and am once again hoping to become a bit more active in the community, maybe even write something. (This is particularly helped by a few encouraging messages I recieved in the IRC.)<br><br>My fandoms are Babylon 5, The Circle of Magic/The Circle Opens, Discworld, Homestuck, Portal, and a healthy host of others, although I know none of them obsessively and haven&#39;t quite read all of any of them(Well, except Homestuck.)I&#39;m also currently playing my way through Myst, Riven, and Exile, and I&#39;m working my way through the first Full Metal Alchemist anime (dubbed.)<br><br>Re-Hello to you all!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m currently trying to come up with character ideas for when I ask for permission, and I&#39;d like some opinions on them--they&#39;re not really fleshed out yet, but the basics are:<br><br>An ex-cursor from Codex Alera who specializes in firecrafting<br>and<br>An ex-Mary Sue from a Nanoha badfic with the &quot;Book of the Dawn  Sky&quot; a speshul version of the Tome of the Night Sky.

            <p>The Flowers are giant telepathic plants, no two ways about it. You&#39;re gonna want to brush up on the Original Series and the basics of the PPC in general before asking for permission, I think. Also, you can&#39;t actually claim that RC number until you have permission, so I&#39;m afraid creating a journal named for it was a bit premature.<br><br>I recommend re-reading Nate&#39;s bio. There&#39;s a fair bit of wonky grammar and word choices—just in the Appearance section I find &quot;complex&quot; where you need &quot;complexion&quot; and &quot;tied behind the his head,&quot; which has an extra word in it.

            <p>Era? You mean which First Lord she served? I imagined that she fought against the Vord, and she probably has limited skills in all crafts--enough watercraft to heal some minor wounds, enough woodcraft to hide, enough metalcraft to be able to tell when someone&#39;s carrying a weapon, that sort of thing (forgive me if any of those things are not, in fact, easy to learn; it&#39;s been a while since I read the books). She probably specializes in firecraft and windcrafting.</p>

            <p>Yes, I meant which First Lord. So, if she&#39;s an ex-Cursor, is that &#39;ex&#39; only because she joined up with the PPC, or did she retire in-world, and how? And if she fought the Vord, then she served towards the end of Sextus&#39; reign, I take it? Older or younger than Tavi?<br><br>It should be noted that skills--however limited--in <em>all</em> the crafting types are painfully rare except in the very highest Citizenry. My immediate suggestion would be that unless she is supposed to be related to--and, within-world, probably known to be related to--one of the major families, especially the High Lords&#39;? You&#39;re going to want to limit her crafting sharply to either two at decently to strongly formidable levels or three, with one noticeably stronger and one extant but barely functional.<br><br>For someone like her, I&#39;d point to Bernard and Fidelias as the proper templates for highly-powered in multiple crafting types. Bernard is noticeably and highly powered in wood and earth, but without anything noted in any of the others; Fidelias is similarly powerful (or possibly slightly less so, but with a different kind of finesse) and also has some low-level watercrafting. I think in her case you&#39;ll want to look at Fidelias in particular. Healing is actually decently difficult; as I recall, Fidelias cannot manage it at all, though he can change his appearance with many weeks of putting in a couple hours a day into it. Knowing when someone&#39;s armed with metallic weaponry is pretty much a natural side-effect of being a remotely noticeable metalcrafter and has a lot less power and skill associated with it.<br><br>Given what you seem to want to do, I&#39;d suggest limiting it to firecrafting and windcrafting with a possible side dose of minor metal or water--not both. In particular, if you want woodcraft for hiding, keep in mind that isn&#39;t actually necessary: windcrafters can do both auditory and visual veils (there&#39;s a whole part where Gaius Sextus teaches Amara how to veil while flying, and it&#39;s the windcrafters who do soundproofing). Far more to the point:  it is more interesting to have a Cursor who does <em>not</em> have &#39;Every Possible Base Trick In The Arsenal&#39; to work with. Cursors are chosen to be deadly and <em>creative</em> about it, and work around their difficulties. One of the most dangerous Cursors in Alera is little Ehren, and he doesn&#39;t need more than token crafting to murder a High Lord--and Tavi himself, pre-crafting, could have taken out two given the element of surprise. It&#39;s not about how much crafting, it&#39;s about how it&#39;s used, and with Cursors? The best of the best are smarter than they are magically powerful.<br><br>This is, of course, a good rule of thumb for creating Agents in general--being a not-dissimilar vocation--but in the case of Aleran Cursors this is implicit and frequently <em>explicit</em> in canon. Unless your agent being a child of the upper echelons of the Citizenry is crucial to her backstory, I&#39;d say limit it; if she really is that high-born, of course, you&#39;ve got a radically different ballgame with its own set of challenges.</p>

            <p>Well, I think ex- because she joined up with the PPC. I think she had finished her training a short time before the Vord War, so early twenties-ish?<br> Thanks for the information on crafting. She&#39;s not a member of the Citizenry, so I&#39;ll limit her to Fire- and wind-crafting.</p>

            <p>Then I think, in character building, I only have a couple more thoughts to suggest you keep in mind:<br><br>1) Early twenties is good, but <em>when</em> she became a Cursor is still relevant. Remember that we don&#39;t know who trained Cursors after Killian&#39;s death in Book 2, and Tavi is all of 24 in the last book, so &#39;early twenties&#39; doesn&#39;t hit up the key point. Is she older than Tavi? Did she finish her training before he did, or was her training approached differently than his thanks to the circumstances? If she finished <em>after</em> book two, the question of who trained her becomes relevant; his Cursor class is the last that we know of graduating, but it&#39;s unlikely Sextus would have just let it go merely because his primary teacher fell. Still, we don&#39;t actually know what happened, and we know the Cursors were getting decimated as the Vord War approached.<br><br>So, did your Agent graduate before Tavi did, or after? And if after, given she likely studied in Alera Imperia, who contributed to her training once Killian was dead?<br><br>2) You mention she&#39;s not a member of the Citizenry--so, I assume, not born so. If she&#39;s a strong enough crafter, she might have become a Citizen based on that crafting (the way some Knights become Citizens rather than just being freemen thanks to being incredibly strong crafters; it&#39;s mentioned Bernard could have been a Citizen prior to becoming Count Calderon if he&#39;d wanted to, he just hadn&#39;t bothered). Is she a Citizen now, born a freewoman or not, or has she not challenged for full Citizenship?<br><br>3) This is purely a question that came up for me when thinking about a Cursor-cum-Agent, and takes several sharp turns into serious and more detailed character development territory, but it&#39;s a question I thought I&#39;d share. The only two Cursors known to quit within-world are Fidelias and Amara, and they both did so... spectacularly--and in both cases it didn&#39;t last very long. If you think about the job of a Cursor, they first and foremost serve the Crown, approximately to protect the Realm (and that&#39;s where the idealism can lead to conflict of philosophy)--and the House of Gaius does not let go of talent easily. Cursors serve as the First Lord&#39;s eyes and ears, and frequently mouth and hands. Does your ex-Cursor still carry the coin that marks her as a Cursor? Does she have that life waiting for her should she leave the PPC, and if she does, is it because she simply never bothered to &#39;abandon Real Life,&#39; as it were?  Whether or not any of this is the case, how does her previous loyalty to Lord and Realm currently play into her view of her duties as an Agent?<br><br><br><br>In case you can&#39;t tell, the idea of an ex-Cursor for an Agent is hugely exciting. These are just the questions which arose in my mind immediately upon reading your premise.</p>

            <p>It is fantastic. <br><br>Is Jim Butcher&#39;s other series- the first book I think is a bit rocky, personally, if better in quality than the first Dresden Files book- but it is excellent. <br><br>Very enjoyable series overall, though  I am not quite the utter fanatic that FractalDawn is.</p>

            <p>I figured that DoSAT confiscated the book after she joined, so she could probably only handle basic-ish, not-powerful magic, or none at all. In fact, the reason that she wasn&#39;t killed is because, in the canon, the Book of Darkness would just reincarnate somewhere after being destroyed, and the agents didn&#39;t want to take that risk.</p>

            <p>I think she still has magic, after all Hayate got a hell of a Linker Core (=mana storage, in layman&#39;s terms) in canon despite the first Book got destroyed.<br><br>Surely your Agent without the Book of Dawn will lose a good chunk of power, but she&#39;ll keep enough mana to cast some combat-capable spells. My advice is to keep her no more than B or at most single A ranked, as MGLN power levels tend to go <i>really</i> high. Go google &quot;Nanoha blasts Quattro&quot; to get what a pissed off S+ ranked mage can do.<br><br>There&#39;s a reason why I think the only was to deal with an S-ranked Sue is &quot;close air support with jetfighters&quot;. And I&#39;m sure there are some SSS-ranked ones out there. (Sun Crusher required.)</p>

            <p>As I recall, Hayate had almost no magic before she fixed the book-it&#39;s why it was eating into her body. And while she can still cast spells, then she&#39;ll be really limited--I&#39;d guess that a severely depowered Bloody Dagger or Diabolic Emission--enough to fight with, yeah, but no city-destroying (I&#39;m fairly certain that Diabolic Emission was intended as an anti-warship weapon, even if Rein Eins and Hayate use it as an anti-personnel attack). Her equivalent would probably be enough to cover a large room-no where near the ToNS equivalent.  </p>

            <p>On the whole, I enjoyed Jackson&#39;s Lord of the Rings. THe only thing I didn&#39;t like about it was the way Gimli basically became comic relief for most of the film.

            <p>The thing is, the Hobbit has been traditionally sold and viewed as a children&#39;s book. Therefore, people are more readily willing to think of it as being more light-hearted than it is, or even to search for some element to point at and say &quot;See, look there! It&#39;s got stuff aimed at kids!&quot; and say that the dwarves are silly like in Snow White or something. And, though it didn&#39;t go down the road that most kids books do (ie insult the intelligence of the reader and pander to the idea that kids couldn&#39;t understand complex ideas) and therefore is still appealing to adults, it is a rather light-hearted story. Not to say that it&#39;s not <i>serious</i>, simply that it&#39;s not Heavy. What they&#39;re doing is not World Shattering (or at least, they don&#39;t know it is). It&#39;s got some pretty scary stuff going on, and there&#39;s a huge political environment going on around the events of the story, but it&#39;s not about the politics, or the saving the world, or the bad. It&#39;s about a guy who&#39;s never been outside his own county being swept off on an amazing adventure into a world in which he is very small, in all senses of the phrase. <br><br>And, the last time I read it, the dwarves <i>were</i> a comedic element of sorts, from time to time. Slightly black humour, and more situational, absurd humour than Witty Comebacks, and definitely not all the time, but humour nonetheless. <i>You</i> try hiring a wizard to talk your way into the home of a stranger, inviting him on a journey, throwing a party, eating all his food, breaking his things, and then sing a song about how you&#39;re doing all these things that this person hates. See if I&#39;m not laughing about all this. <br><br>Also, most of our main cast are dwarves. I doubt Jackson would be stupid enough to just blanket dwarves as comic relief, given that then <i>most of the cast</i> would be comic relief, and the film would be terrible (Because like it or not, the Hobbit is not a comedy)...<br><br>All that said, I stand with you on the desire for serious dwarves, and do hope that this film pulls through... </p>

            <p>Legolas doesn&#39;t have a speaking part in the book; he doesn&#39;t do anything in the book, in fact, because he didn&#39;t exist as such when Tolkien wrote it. Therefore, anything he does in the movie will be crammed into the story where it doesn&#39;t naturally fit, which is the definition of shoehorning. The deviation from the book is precisely the problem, since there&#39;s no reason for it in this case except to let all the fangirls and fanboys squee at teh hawt Leggikins.<br><br>&#39;Course, I might be forgiving if he&#39;s just getting drunk on Dorwinion with everyone else.

            <p>If Legolas helps the Dwarves escape, that&#39;d be a continuity break wouldn&#39;t it? Considering that he only learnt to respect Dwarves during his time with Gimli on the Quest. So I wouldn&#39;t be too surprised if he tries to /prevent/ them from leaving, but I think Peter Jackson won&#39;t be that incompetent as to break Legolas&#39;s character development in the LotR movies by having help the Dwarves.</p>

            <p>Since they&#39;re making two movies out of it, I think they&#39;re fleshing certain parts out for the sake of story. I mean, it makes sense in <i>The Hobbit</i> as a book, to skim over weeks of Bilbo sneaking invisibly around Thranduil&#39;s palace. But in a movie, how would you convey that? A montage or something would be just silly, as would a voice-over or subtitle, &quot;Several Weeks Later...&quot; But actually showing Bilbo watch things happen makes quite a bit of sense, in a movie.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t take issue with changes that have to do with switching media—showing a few scenes of Bilbo sneaking around, sure; maybe catching a glimpse of Legolas talking with people, sure—but I just don&#39;t trust PJ to stick at that. Also, given that Orlando Bloom probably costs a lot of money, I&#39;m not sure how likely it is that they&#39;d bother unless they were going to give him something important to do.<br><br>Anyway, this is just one small point, one thing I can point to that would make me upset out of a zillion possible things I haven&#39;t considered yet.

But then PJ went &quot;No, really, the next time will be cake again, I promise!&quot; and we went &quot;Well, okay,&quot; but we showed up for RotK and it was neurotoxin again. It&#39;s not paranoia if I&#39;m worried about more neurotoxin this time.<br><br>It hurts more because it always looks like cake to start with. {= (<br><br>~Neshomeh, metaphor-ing with portals.</p>

            <p>I only looked at the first one, and I&#39;m still baffled. It sounds like it was written by a twelve-year-old who just found Ruto to be the most annoying character ever.<br><br>Quote:<br>&quot;So he of course did his special move, Great Aethered. But it wasn&#39;t normal, like it normally is. It was super powerful and he kept doing it, over and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again.<br>The last time he did it, it was like X10 stronger, and she went flying across the lake and over the mountains.&quot;<br><br>Storytelling at its finest.</p>

            <p>It was featured there. That&#39;s why I read it. My brain is a natural source of brain bleach. I&#39;m too glad for that.<br>Still, while Artemis&#39; lover may be legendary in its badness, I&#39;m not sure if it would make for that much of a spectacular sporking.<br><font color="white">THE MACHINE DOES NOT OWN YOU</font></p>
