            <p>...well, to Agents, I&#39;m not sure TVT is aught more than a website.<br><br>The PPC as a whole does exist <i>within</i> the &#39;multiverse,&#39; but I&#39;m not sure TVTropes does. TVT seems more... outside. And, I&#39;m not sure about if TVT has a personal canon, but I have a feeling they wouldn&#39;t mesh well.<br><br>May I ask why you&#39;re asking?

            <p>TVTropes doesn&#39;t have any narrative continuity, so I don&#39;t think it could ever qualify as a true universe in and of itself. It lacks the crucial dimension of time. It could <i>exist</i> in any universe with the internet, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Trope-tan is one of the main NPCs as far as I know.<br><br>Plus, Trope-Tan is also the main character of a &quot;Show Whithin A Show&quot; in a fanfiction I read a while ago, Takamachi Nanoha of 2814.<br><br>So, I think Trope-Tan exists somewhere in the multiverse.

            <p>Techno-Dahn is probably right. But what I said before,maybe trope-tan moves through the multiverse? Tv tropes doesn&#39;t really have one, but they do in a way. <br><br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pantheon/TropePantheons"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pantheon/TropePantheons">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pantheon/TropePantheons</a></a><br><br>It&#39;s actually a pretty strange question.

            <p><i>A 17-year-old girl was standing in front of a pillar at a very busy train station. Her piercing green eyes searched the crowd quickly. Then she closed her eyes and walked straight into the pillar.&quot; Harry learns of a new relative.</i><br><br>======================================================<br><br>&quot;Are... are you okay?&quot;<br><br>Slinky blinked, trying to parse the words being spoken to her. The world was still blurred a bit, except for the sharp pain on her nose. She sat up from the station&#39;s concrete platform and put a hand to her face, which when she pulled back was covered in blood. Her nose was also extremely tender, and didn&#39;t feel particularly... solid. <br><br>&quot;You just kind of... ran into that pillar...&quot;<br><br>Slinky finally trained her sharp green eyes on the boy that was bothering her. At first she thought it was Harry Potter, but upon a second look he was just a plain old rubbish londoner. No lightning bolt at all. He was bending down to help her up, but she would have none of that!<br><br>&quot;I do as I please! I am a mighty and powerful wizard!&quot; She even had the bright purple rose tattoo on her cheek to prove it, a token from when Voldemort had attempted to kill her. Her brother Harry had only gotten a richochet of the Dark Lord&#39;s Avada Kedavra spell - she was the one truly deserving of all of his fame, and it was this year that she was going to prove it. If only Voldemort&#39;s spell hadn&#39;t <i>also</i> caused her to be transported to a parallel dimension that she was trapped in until she learned enough magic on her own in order to return to her true home to claim the fortune and glory that was rightly hers!<br><br>The muggle boy must have just taken her to be delirious because he ignored her odd pronouncement, choosing instead to help Slinky to her feet. Once standing again, she jerked her elbow away from him ingratiously. <br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t need help!&quot; she snorted, the motion setting her spring-like pair of silver ponytails bouncing. With vision still slightly blurred she looked again at the numbers above the platforms, making sure that she was at the right spot. The numbers clearly said &#39;8&#39; and &#39;9&#39;, and she had run directly at the pillar between them, as that handsome white-haired boy had told her. A pleasant one, that boy, and his two jolly fat friends who seemed to always be laughing. <br><br>&quot;Are you sure?&quot; The muggle boy asked, his continued persistence irritating Slinky to no end. She wouldn&#39;t be able to try entering the pillar again as long as this muggle stayed around! He was completely wasting her time! <br><br>&quot;Yes, fine! Go away!&quot; Her hand fell into her stylish jacket and pulled out her Urple Wand - crafted from Lovewood with a Nymph-hair core that was gifted to her by Father Time during her stay in the Dimension of Fairies - with the intention of charming the frustrating boy so he&#39;d forget all about her and go on his way. But when she jerked from his grip yet again, she perhaps overdid it. Overcome by another wave of vertigo, she stumbled backward and fell off the platform, just as the horn of an oncoming train sounded...<br><br>* * *<br><br>&quot;How are we supposed to get to Hoggwarts now?&quot; Harry asked frustratedly of his two friends. They sat on a bench a ways down from Platform 9 3/4ths, ambulances and other emergency officials buzzing about the closed station pending the cleanup and investigation of some accident that had occured nearby early that morning. Apparently some girl had gotten hit by a train. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not sure if something like this has happened before,&quot; replied Hermoine. &quot;I can only assume they&#39;ll delay the departure until tomorrow, or at least until this clears up.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bloody inconvenient if you ask me,&quot; Ron mumbled irritably. He idly slipped a few crumbs to his pet rat through a hole in the grubby cardboar box he was kept in, tied up with the rest of his luggage. Scabbers suddenly squealed and dove back further into the box, prompting the trio to notice the return of Hermoine&#39;s cat, Crookshanks. The orange feline had a strange stick in it&#39;s mouth as it arrived at Hermoine&#39;s feet and began to generously rub itself against her leg. <br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t pick up strange pieces of junk, Crookshanks,&quot; Hermoine chided as she pulled the corkscrew shaped wand from Crookshanks mouth. The young witch gave the odd corkscrew shaped wand an odd look. &quot;What do you suppose this is?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Looks like some tacky art thing,&quot; replied Harry. &quot;My aunt buys them all the time. The garage is full of boxes of the things.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well I hope no one payed much for this,&quot; Hermoine replied, tossing it into a nearby bin. <br><br></p>

            <p>&quot;They really are quite tame, aren&#39;t they, Sam?&quot;<br><br>Sam Gamgee did not really agree, but gave a miserable &quot;Yessir, Mr. Frodo,&quot; as he clung to the spike-finned back of the Fell Beast. The black flapping thing winged its way slowly above the clouds. The two hobbits on its back were a little green in the face, but unhurt. <br><br>&quot;It didn&#39;t protest much at its nest in that maze of rocks, did it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nosir, Mr. Frodo.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s very strange, but it makes a certain sense. It must be tame. How else would anyone control such a monster?&quot;<br><br>&quot;If that&#39;s what you think.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How much farther to Mount Doom do you think, Sam?&quot;<br><br>Sam gulped down his fear and peered uneasily over the side. &quot;Not far. It&#39;s like looking into a summer bonfire down there.&quot;<br><br>Frodo Baggins&#39; hands were white from hanging on to the spike in front of him. &quot;Go down,&quot; He asked the Fell Beast. It gave a spirited roar and they felt the descent in a wide, dizzying spiral. The stink of ash and gas worsened. <br><br>&quot;We&#39;ll have to ride this thing out again, won&#39;t we?&quot; Sam groaned. &quot;I don&#39;t know much for flapping beasts and creatures, but this just seems downright unnatural to me. If we were meant to fly in the sky, don&#39;t you think we&#39;d have had wings?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, you&#39;re right. But it is faster than continuing on foot-- could you imagine it, Sam?&quot;<br><br>Sam could. &quot;Would fill up a book or two with just, &#39;we walked to Mordor,&#39; Mr. Frodo. But- agh- this isn&#39;t any pony. Do you think it&#39;s wise to ride it without a saddle?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It doesn&#39;t seem to make much of a difference either way. It seems resolute to keep us from falling, in any case. Why?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because it seem to be getting mighty sore on the back, if you know what I mean, sir.&quot;<br><br>Frodo looked down. Indeed, where he was sitting was rubbed raw from their clinging legs and their packs. The black hide of the Fell Beast was rubbed slightly reddish, if leather could ever be tender. It had several pustules and warts from unclean conditions and they seemed to be irritated.<br><br>When Frodo brushed one cautiously, it burst in a shower of steaming-hot blood and lavalike pus. The hobbit screamed in disgust and surprise.<br><br>The Fell Beast didn&#39;t like that. It had been descending gradually in slow, careful spirals, but suddenly it spooked and plummeted through the heavy cloud and smoke cover. It flipped over. It looped-de-looped. It barrel rolled. Frodo tumbled from his spot on the creature&#39;s back, but when the world stopped spinning, he found that Sam --bless him, Sam!- had caught him by his elven cloak. The Fell Beast had caught Sam&#39;s pack gingerly in it&#39;s considerate jaws. The two hobbits dangled quite safely-- a stomach-turning drop separating them from the floor of the Black Land of Mordor.<br><br>Uneasily staring at the thin wisp of sickly clouds beneath him, Frodo felt a missing weight around his neck, and a stab of primal panic.<br><br>&quot;The Ring! I&#39;ve dropped the Ring!&quot;<br><br>--<br><br>The One Ring was quite happy. It was here, in Mordor. It was close to its master. Sauron&#39;s eye swiveled, saw it fall-- Yes! Perfect! Such good fortune!<br><br>Unfortunately, it was falling directly into the open mouth of the Orodruin itself.<br><br>Sauron ordered all of his Nazgul on their flying mounts to catch it. They were nowhere near close enough. Sauron focused his thought on it, cursing that his body was gone. But there was nothing that could be done.<br><br>The One Ring apologized for its bad timing.<br><br>Sauron assured it that no, it&#39;s OK, it&#39;s not it&#39;s fault, they were hobbits on a flapping hell beast and the One Ring couldn&#39;t have won anyway.<br><br>The Dark Lord of Mordor watched as the One Ring plopped into Mount Doom and was un-made. The Nazgul didn&#39;t survive long enough to get to the now-located Ring Bearer. The armies of Mordor collapsed into the blasted land they&#39;d come from. And Sauron rolled his Great Eye before being reduced to not much more than a powerless essence.<br><br>Frodo and Sam eventually made it back-- two hobbits on the back of a frightening, yet quite civil monster (Named later in historical records <i>Mananca the Gentle</i>)-- and a certain book and a half was reduced to a few sentences involving the riding and tame nature of Fell Beasts.<br><br>And that was the end of that.</p>

            <p>Alright, I&#39;ll take a crack at this.<br><br>Chaos by tangledribbons<br>In the summer after his third year, Harry Potter finds a CD and changes the fate of the wizarding world. Rated T for later content.<br>***<br><br>Chaos had struck the Quiddich World Cup. The Dark Mark had been fired into the sky, and even after the foreboding symbol had made itself known, and even after the chaotic harassment of the spectators had all but died down, tensions were high, and people were fleeing the site in droves.<br><br>But Harry Potter was not worried. For he had it all figured out.<br><br>&quot;How can you be so apathetic?&quot; Hermione spat at him, trying to break through his glazed stupor. &quot;Don&#39;t you realize what has just happened?&quot;<br><br>With a knowing grin, he turned to face his nervous friend. &quot;I know exactly what happened. We don&#39;t have to be high to look in the sky.&quot;<br><br>Hermione&#39;s face turned beet red. She exploded into a tirade about what could have happened, who it could have been, what spells they could have used, death eaters, Voldemort, cast the thingummywats into the plickensholber spell, yeah yeah.<br><br>&quot;Are you even listening!?&quot; She exclaimed.<br><br>&quot;Listen. If Magic is all you ever know, then it&#39;s easy to miss what&#39;s really going on.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot;<br><br>In a swift, clean motion, Harry Potter got to his feet, walked a few feet into the forest, grabbed a man in the bushes, dragged him out by the arm, stood him in front of Hermione, then knocked him out with crowbar he had been apparently holding the entire time.<br><br>It was Barty Crouch Jr. The escaped Azkaban convict.<br><br>Hermione looked at her friend, completely dumbfounded.<br>&quot;How could you have possibly known?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Have you ever stopped to look around?&quot; He asked in response. &quot;Like, really stopped and looked at the simple things?&quot;<br><br>Hermione remained silent.<br><br>Harry nodded sagely. &quot;For instance... Music is magic, pure and clean. You can feel it and hear it but it can&#39;t be seen. You can&#39;t even hold it, it&#39;s just in the air.&quot;<br><br>Right then, Hermione was struck with a revelation. He had been listening to a CD that someone had thrown out in the middle of the campsite. He had been enthralled with it ever since they left the stadium. What had been on there that had inspired such practicality and reasoning in her friend?<br><br>&quot;Pure motherf***ing magic, Right?&quot;<br>&quot;This sh*t will blow your motherf***ing mind.&quot;<br><br>Harry Potter&#39;s fourth year at Hogwarts would certainly be an interesting one. For he now was a master of magic. And a worker of miracles.</p>

            <p>Ok, here goes my shot. <br><br>Setting Severus Snape Up by Azuria Asiyarana Annabellah<br><i>Harry, Ron and Hermione have decided to place an advertisement in the Daily Prophet under the Singles&#39; Column. Their mission: To find a perfect lady companion for their Potions Teacher, the one and only Severus Snape. But things soon get out of control!</i><br><br>Harry, Ron and Hermione were sitting in the Great Hall. They were enjoying their breakfasts when the owl post came. A <i>Daily Prophet</i> landed in Ron&#39;s bowl, spreading porridge all over his face.<br>He sighed and took the newspaper, reading but the headlines. He was about to pass it to Harry or Hermione when an article called his attention.<br>Ron went pale and held the newspaper closer to his eyes, probably to make sure he had read right. Then the put the paper down and went paler to the point that the only things still coloured on his face were the freckles. Harry and Hermione watched him in silence.<br>“Ron, what&#39;s going on?” Harry asked. He looked concerned.<br>As an answer, Ron folded the paper and passed it to him, pointing at a certain article. Harry grabbed it and read:<br><br><i>Teacher that believes 1+1= LOVE<br>Potion teacher of Hogwarts, black hair and eyes, 5&#39;7”,  looks for a woman, <br>25-40 years, preferably brunette, who likes sundowns and pets.<br>Contact:</i><br><br>There was a small picture of Snape at one side of the advertisement, and it was signed H.R.H.<br>At that point, everybody in the Great Hall was laughing and pointing at the three Gryffindor. Malfoy was smiling devilishly, and the Weasley twins were rolling on the floor, literally.<br>Then Snape entered the room, with a <i>Daily Prophet</i> in his hand, and walked straight to them. When he reached, he leant over Ron and Hermione, between them both, and spoke softly:<br>“You three, to my office, now.” The last word seemed to be shouted, as much as you can shout while speaking in a soft voice. “And, mister Potter, I donґt like sundowns. Nor pets, mister Weasley.” <br>“But we didn&#39;t...” Harry tried to explain, but Snape was already walking away.<br>The kids stood up. They still couldn&#39;t believe the whole situation.<br>&quot;We.. we will be able to work it out, won&#39;t we?&quot; Hermione said.<br>Ron and Harry just looked at her and started their way.</p>

            <p>&quot;Storys are told around the campfire and Aragorn is probably going to be dead by tommorow&quot; <br><br>***<br><br>&quot;Here&#39;s my story&quot;, Gimli began, as the rest of the Fellowship huddled closer to the fire in the cold Middle-Earth night. A few of them were grilling some meat on little spokes of sharpened branches. In the distance, a wolf howled. <br><br>&quot;This was some time ago, when Aragorn was paying a visit to my father in Eberor, and we were in a tavern drinking. The topic of, erm, courtship cropped up. Aragorn suddenly got very serious, leaned towards me and asked, &#39;Tell me Gimli, I am seeing this lovely dwarven girl I met here a few weeks ago, and I am wondering if you had any tips because, um...&#39; He leaned in even closer and whispered something that I shall not repeat here since I am a gentledwarf.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, my response was, &#39;you do realize dwarven women don&#39;t have beards, lad&#39;?&quot;<br><br>While the rest of them were in fits of laughter, Aragorn snuck to the tent and grabbed a package of something. In the morning when Gimli woke up, well rested, he found out that he had been completely wrapped up in tin foil.<br><br>&quot;See you tomorrow once you&#39;ve caught up with us - Mount Doom won&#39;t wait, after all&quot;, Aragorn quipped and the Fellowship, sans Gimli, set out.<br><br>&quot;Oh, he&#39;s going to be so dead by tomorrow&quot;, Gimli grumbled as he struggled free of the foil.</p>

            <p>Here at the PPC, we like the English language. We like the English language a lot. In fact, some of us like other languages a lot, too.<br><br>However, recently, I got a very interesting point made to me by a cousin of mine who uses a lot of chat speak in her notes to me. You probably have heard of this remark before-- that languages are constantly changing and there is no way to say that already-established spelling and grammar are &#39;right.&#39; She called it &#39;evolution of english.&#39;<br><br>This got me thinking. Evolution.<br><br>I do not think it means what she thinks it means.<br><br>Organisms never really stop evolving. Organisms with traits that render them more effective in their environments end up suriving longer and reproducing more than ones that are less effective. <br><br>Key words being <i>effective in their environment</i>. An organism may be this by having an orca pattern under the sea, or being bigger, or faster, or being able to eat something nothing else can eat. But what makes a language effective in its environment?<br><br>Well, the people who use the language and the context they use it in is the language&#39;s environment. The effectiveness of a language has to do with how well it conveys intended meaning.<br><br>Why, just the other day I &#39;butchered English&#39; while texting my mother.<br><br>&quot;Bought small carrotbag.&quot;<br><br>But... the meaning was retained. I bought a small bag of carrots. If I had written &quot;Bought smallcarrot bag&quot; it probably would mean, I bought a bag of small carrots.<br><br>The CONTEXT here was a text message between mom and kid. It conveyed all meaning needed. Thus, this was an effective use of language and if enough people use this syntax it might become &#39;correct&#39; syntax.<br><br>So yeah, my cousin is right in a way. But language doesn&#39;t evolve because &#39;we just like to text this way: it&#39;s easy,&#39; it evolves because the parties involved don&#39;t see any change in meaning or loss of information. Even when there is. Which can sometimes be Bad.<br><br>Half of the PPC&#39;s funny in-mission shenanigans come from miscommunication in a fanfiction. I think (aside from wanting to preserve the grammar and spellings because they&#39;re what everybody already understands and should not be messed with without reason) what we as the PPC get angry at is people changing  language in a way that is NOT effective in its environment. <br><br>Agree? Disagree? Thoughts? Discussion?</p>

            <p>While it&#39;s true that spelling and grammar can change, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that they will. <br><br>We are well past the conception of the English language, the point where it stopped being a corrupted mishmash of a half-dozen intermixed languages and became a language in it&#39;s own right. Nor are we in the Shakespearean era, where a single man could sign his name in twelve different ways and still be recognized as the same person.<br><br>The English language today has hundreds of years of standardization, which I think has only been strengthened by the availability of relevant technology. What we have has been formed, tried, tested, and kept because it was effective. The language has been, for the most part, debugged, and major changes - in my opinion - are unlikely.<br><br>Roman monuments - the ones carved in stone - had no punctuation. Why? Because when it takes you a half an hour to carve any given punctuation mark, it&#39;s not really worth the effort.<br><br>Documents from the age of the printing press had both punctuation and lowercase letters because written communication was primarily done by hand. large numbers of identical documents could be produced, but all the originals were done by hand. What you didn&#39;t see a lot of were <i>italics</i>, because italics were expensive - you had to pay for an extra set of letters in order to have them in your document. Expense equals rarity, so italics were only added when something was really, <i>really</i> important.<br><br>These days, with word processors and laser printers, italics are commonplace; so common, in fact, that they have effectively replaced quotation marks for internal dialogue. Someone - I don&#39;t know who - got tired of pointing out that half the quoted dialogue in his book was internal and went <i>Hey, what if I use a different format to indicate internal dialogue?</i> Well, it worked. In fact, it worked so well that it&#39;s hard to find a novel that doesn&#39;t use italics to indicate internal dialogue.<br><br>Ease creates complexity, and complexity requires structure. <br><br>So then why isn&#39;t chatspeak more complex than the written word, since it&#39;s easier? Except that it&#39;s not, because chatspeak isn&#39;t the use of the written word to convey information, chatspeak is the art of using the written word as verbal conversation. It&#39;s an attempt to simulate the spontaneity of the spoken word in written form, and the interfaces used to do so are not really designed for it. <br><br>Chatspeak isn&#39;t really the next step in the evolution of the English language it&#39;s an entirely new facet of the language, built for a medium that the world has no precedent for. I suspect that as interfaces become more intuitive, the complexity of chatspeak will come closer to that of the written word, rather than vice-versa.<br><br>Or at least I hope it will.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to be even more difficult here and start drawing lines between evolution of <i>words</i> and evolution of <i>structure</i>.<br><br>As far as changes in the structure of language- grammar and syntax, or constructions like you mentioned with your text message as an example- yeah, I think you&#39;re right. We learn the structure of our language in a certain way, and changing it really does affect the meaning of what we read and/or hear. Sometimes the change can be effective- for example, in a text message it isn&#39;t really efficient to type out a full sentence with capitalization and articles and things- but I agree with you that it does depend on the context. &quot;Bought small carrotbag&quot; is appropriate and effective in a text message; it wouldn&#39;t be in a written report to your boss. <br><br>(Unrelated: &quot;carrotbag&quot; is my new favorite word ever.)<br><br>Which brings me to my other point- change and evolution of <i>individual words</i>, in my personal opinion, is <i>awesome</i>. I&#39;m going to hold up Shakespeare as an example here, because Shakespeare is my go-to example for everything. Shakespeare invented squillions of new words and phrases, stuck words together, back-constructed words, stuck on prefixes and suffixes and what-have-you, and he could do that because he was writing at a time when English was a) in a state of rapid change and expansion, due to a new medium (i.e. secular theatre, also the printing press), and b) not yet standardized by things like dictionaries.<br><br>I would argue that we&#39;re in a similar situation now. The advent of the internet and text-messaging and other such new technology has created a space for language to grow and change. The new language constructions that come out of it aren&#39;t standardized yet- yes, there are things like UrbanDictionary and so forth, but they&#39;re mostly descriptive rather than prescriptive, and I don&#39;t consider them particularly authoritative. I think, until our frame of thought catches up with our technology, the language of the internet changes too fast to standardize, so we&#39;re looking at considerable linguistic shift for some time yet. And in a lot of cases, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad thing at all.</p>

            <p>That fact that language changes is a form of evolution. Evolution means slow change/gradual development. It doesn&#39;t just apply to biological systems. <br><br>I can probably better tell you about my own experience with my own native tongue. In Dutch there are a few very common grammatical spelling errors (in translation: saying &#39;them&#39; rather than &#39;they&#39;; saying &#39;bigger as&#39; rather than &#39;bigger than&#39;; saying &#39;hele&#39; (adjective) instead of &#39;heel&#39; (adverb) (can&#39;t translate this, but suffice to say that in one particular case people use an adjective where they should use an adverb) ; adding spacing between the different parts of a compound noun (this is called English disease); and not adding spaces after &#39;te&#39; or &#39;ten&#39; when they are needed, thus using a different word than  meant.)<br><br>I once took part in a survey by a research institution about such errors. The questions were: do you come across this error? Do you find it acceptable Dutch? If not, do you think it will become acceptable Dutch? When?<br><br>In all these cases the reader or listener probably still knows what the other person is meaning to say. Only language purist grind their teeth.<br><br><i>But language doesn&#39;t evolve because &#39;we just like to text this way: it&#39;s easy,&#39; it evolves because the parties involved don&#39;t see any change in meaning or loss of information.</i><br><br>Actually, this is exactly why language evolves. It starts with something else being easier to say and because no meaning is lost, the difference becomes acceptable and perhaps at some time the new standard. If there was no reason to say things differently, language would not change/evolve.<br><br></p>

            <p>Is the reason no meaning is lost that most people understand what the incorrect rendering is supposed to be, and translate in their heads? In other words, if the reader didn&#39;t know that the correct thing to write is &quot;heel,&quot; would they be able to understand what the writer meant by the incorrect &quot;hele&quot;? If not, then I can&#39;t see the nonstandard version ever becoming standard, because it relies on the standard to make sense.<br><br>I do agree that language shift is evolution; just not that what Aster&#39;s cousin was talking about is it. Texting cannot become standard because without the standard to act as a reference point, it carries no meaning. Also, it isn&#39;t really innovative; it adds nothing in terms of the ability to express ideas, only makes it more expedient in its medium. For another example, take telegraphs. These use shorthand, too, for the same reasons, and yet the language patterns of telegraphs haven&#39;t caught on generally, because in the broader scope of the language, nothing is gained by them.<br><br>The way I see it, what is standard only evolves when an innovation happens--a new word or turn of phrase for a new concept, mainly. The word &quot;cool&quot; might be a good example. &quot;Coolness&quot; is a different thing from other forms of (usually social) acceptability, so a new word evolved for it. (Whether the word or the concept came first is a whole separate issue.) Initially it was not mainstream, but as the concept of coolness spread and became accepted, so did the word for it.<br><br>I&#39;ll pause here so as not to wander off topic or stop making sense. ^_^;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

I think most people think &quot;hele&quot; is the correct form. I think it stems from &quot;hele&quot; being easier to pronounce than &quot;heel&quot;. (The Dutch word &quot;melk&quot; is pronounced with two syllables for this same reason.) From spoken Dutch it started slipping into written Dutch and now it is rather prominent there. I even came across it twice in a course on correct spelling, and not in an example &#39;this is bad&#39; sentence.<br><br>Another example of change in Dutch. Dutch has a polite you &quot;u&quot;, like the French have &quot;vous&quot; and the Germans &quot;Sie&quot;. Grammatically, &quot;u&quot; should be treated like a third person singular. For most verbs there is no difference between the second and third person singular. For a few verbs there, however, is, and in this verbs you can see &quot;u&quot; changing to a second person singular. For &#39;to be&#39; this change has been completed, for &#39;to have&#39; both the third person and second person form exist.<br><br>Evolution is hard to see when you are in the middle of the time when the changes are taking place. You can only see the evolution if you can take a step back and look at language from a different vantage point.<br><br>I don&#39;t think standards only change when innovation happens. I think standards also change because something else is easier to say and still makes sense. <br><br>That the language pattern of telegraphs hasn&#39;t caught on may not just be because nothing was gained by it, but because not enough people were using it. It really were only the people operating the telegraphs. These days, nearly a whole generation sends text messages and uses chat rooms. That&#39;s a lot of people that write &quot;w8&quot; (which means the same in Dutch as in English).</p>

            <p>The discussion so far has been comparing texting to standard English, which is, to use a common idiom, comparing apples to oranges.<br><br>Aster mentions in the OP that evolution is environment dependent, but she neglected to mention that language use in in speaking, in writing, and in texting are all completely separate environments, and are therefore subject to different branching paths of evolution. There&#39;s also an ambiguous line between how modern language has changed due to &#39;evolution&#39; or merely through recent cultural slang. <br><br>Language is a function of culture, so many new terms and meanings are adopted overtime. We &#39;google&#39; things now, even if we&#39;re using other search engines, and we think that explosions are &#39;cool.&#39; Removing adjectives and articles are unlikely to catch on, however. <br><br>So to summarize (and to reiterate the point made by others already), chatspeak exists primarily for expediency in time-sensitive and assumed-context situations. Any conventions that are brought back into more standard English are there because of slang and counter-culture, and with time will be erased - <br><br>unless the lolcat armagedden happens and in 10 years we&#39;re all forced to speak in IMPACT font. </p>

            <p>Written English and spoken English are two different things. I would just like to state this before we talk about the topic proper. When you write &quot;bought small carrotbag,&quot; it might seem clear to your mom, but if you spoke that same exact statement without context, it would sound completely different. Writing and talking are two different things, and I think that text talk has very little effect on spoken English aside from reading those texts out loud and pronouncing the abbrevs.<br><br>That being said, I agree that evolution is not the right word for what your cousin described. New words are being created all the time. My word processor recognizes the word &quot;Pokemon,&quot; which probably wouldn&#39;t have happened fifteen years ago. But that&#39;s not evolution. It&#39;s just change. I wouldn&#39;t even go that far with text talk, because it is essentially just abbreviations. Like you said, Aster, it&#39;s all in the context. But languages don&#39;t evolve. They change and warp and make new dialects and such. You should watch My Fair Lady sometime. It&#39;s one of my favorite movies ever. </p>

            <p>By which I mean standard usage vs. nonstandard usage.<br><br>Something that we all can generally accept, I think, is that there IS a time and a place for informal, colloquial, slang language. We use shortcuts when talking to our friends because, as Aster points out, no meaning is lost in that context. Same goes for texting, much as it galls me.<br><br>However! There is also a time and a place for standard usage. Such times and places include schoolwork, talking to people who you&#39;d like to impress with your intelligence, and writing that you plan to show to strangers. In essence, any time you can&#39;t afford to be misunderstood.<br><br>Can what is considered standard change? Sure. But only in ways that improve the language&#39;s function. Maybe saying &quot;bought small carrotbag&quot; doesn&#39;t lose any meaning in that instance, but that became standard, if all grammar converted to such a simplistic, bare-bones functional style, what would we lose overall?

            <p>I won&#39;t go into too much detail in order to protect the family&#39;s privacy, but they seemed very flattered I came. I did indeed manage to get flowers - a bunch of white roses, as requested - and a card. I didn&#39;t put everyone&#39;s names in because I couldn&#39;t fit them all in and I don&#39;t want them Googling us, but I did put in a bit about how many people I know will also miss him. The service was nice, mostly attended by locals. Some interesting anecdotes, some good singing by the school choir and one of his friends, and a recording of him reading one of his poems. Being &quot;happy&quot; I went would probably be inappropriate since, y&#39;know, it was a memorial, but I&#39;m glad I was able to go.</p>

            <p>I was thinking of doing a spinoff of Protectors of the Plot Continuum, but I wanted to create a new department known as the Department of Fanciful Stories, wherein all agents fight to protect the dignity of the works of the authors J.R.R. Tolkien, Tamora Pierce, Erin Hunter, and J.K. Rowling - though the emphasis would be on Pierce and Hunter. In the cases of Tolkien and Rowling, the Department of Fanciful Stories would act as fill-ins for the other departments who work with those universes - that way all the other departments could be up to their ears in reports, and the DoFS could still take on the extras.<br><br>The Department of Fanciful Stories would tackle bad slashes, Mary Sues, bad crossovers and (of course) disturbing acts of violence within the fanfics for the universes it protects. And anyone who DARES to sully Pierce&#39;s works will be executed in a most delightfully brutal manner... heheheh...<br><br>Anyway, the DoFS agent&#39;s name would be Caroline, and she will be (for the moment) partnerless - although I do have a partner in mind that will probably introduced by the third chapter or so.<br><br>The badge for the Department of Fanciful Stories will be a coyote mint. And the Department Head would also be Coyote Mint.<br><br>If you&#39;d like a preview of the spin-off, I have already written the first chapter - it just hasn&#39;t been published yet, as I am waiting for approval.</p>

            <p>. . . you don&#39;t need permission, capitalised or otherwise.  The Permission Givers on this board only have jurisdiction over stories which actually use the PPC brandname.  Their approval would be decorative at best.<br><br>However, it doesn&#39;t sound to me like you want to create a spin-off of the PPC -- which is the whole organisation and encompasses many departments -- but of the Department of Mary Sues.

            <p>A lot of the stuff I write of late (ie, <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/">The Twisted Skein</a>, and specifically the barely-begun <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/TimeTitle.htm">Time Will Decide For Us</a>) is only marginally connected to the original PPC. It&#39;s mostly, in fact, connected to my old Agents. It&#39;s very tempting to try and break the connection entirely and make it its own piece. The reasons I haven&#39;t are that it&#39;d then just be a random semi-fanfic with nothing anyone would want to read. :P That probably doesn&#39;t apply in your case.<br><br>If you think you can make it something not PPC but still something people will want to read - and(/or?) you&#39;d enjoy it more - splitting away is fun. It means you don&#39;t have to stick in things you don&#39;t like, for one.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think it would almost have to be at least barely connected, because the charges would have to be about the same and I would need to give credit for the inspiration. Other than that, though, I think if I rearrange things like the main organization name and the department head and the technology a little, it could turn out to be an entirely new fanfiction (for the most part).<br><br>I just wouldn&#39;t feel right about claiming it was -entirely- my idea, you know? It would feel too much like plagiarism to me if I didn&#39;t put a disclaimer on the story that said something to the effect of, &quot;this was inspired by the original PPC series by Jay and Acacia.&quot;</p>

            <p>Does she want to write the PPC spin-off, Department of Fanciful Stories, or does she want to write her own set of stories that don&#39;t involve the PPC? If it&#39;s the first, which it does seem to be, I&#39;d agree with Phobos: she definitely needs permission to write something that takes place in the PPC.

            <p>You wouldn&#39;t happen to be the author of the agent <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Dusk_Daybreak">Dusk Daybreak</a>, would you?

If you specifically want your agents to focus on Pierce&#39;s (and Hunter&#39;s) work(s), you could have them be Freelance Department agents who specialise in those authors. That said, I also don&#39;t recognise you (though my presence has been spotty for a while now) - are you new or a long-abesnt oldbie?</p>

            <p>This seems to me to be pretty much just the Department of Floaters with a more focused... focus. To that end, we don&#39;t really need a new department right now, and in any case it&#39;s customary to wait around a month or two after introducing yourself before asking for permission to write a spin-off. <br><br>So introduce yourself, yes?

            <p>Did you know there were Freakazoid Sues? Because there are. Zarquon, guys, this one was really <i>bad</i>. About half the fic was constructed of pure condensed WTF (seriously, Freakazoid breaks up with Steph in favor of the Sue, then the Lobe tries to recruit her, then it snows in the middle of spring, then Steph burns down a movie theatre with Freakazoid and the Sue inside... I could go on and on) and the other half was just mind-numbingly <i>boring</i>. *curls up in a corner and whimpers*<br><br>But it&#39;s dead now! The mission&#39;s in two parts again- I guess badfic just brings out the eloquence- but this time they&#39;re both up at the same time. So!<br><br><a href="http://iambic5.livejournal.com/194813.html">Not Such A Freakalicious Time</a>, at my LJ, parts linked and all that good stuff. Go forth!</p>

            <p>Glad you enjoyed the mission! :D And seriously, thanks for reading even without knowing the original canon. (Although, if you like wackiness and fourth-wall-breaking and slightly-surreal humor, check it out sometime. It&#39;s pretty ridiculous.)<br><br>Yeah, I&#39;m pretty sure the stolen tech is going to come back to bite them somehow. In a couple ways, probably. *evil plotting grin*<br><br>I want a DRD. It could be friends with my cat and help me fix things and stuff! ...In the meantime, writing Deirdre is fun too. ^_^<br><br>...Oh heck, many things to do. I&#39;ll get on it.

            <p>Terrible fic! Awesome mission! The charge reading scene is quite hilarious. I also feel that &quot;Pissing off agents&quot; should possibly have been used a few more times. Or maybe, &quot;defiling the hearts and minds of agents, your audience and the rest of the free world.&quot; This fic deserved to die in as graphic a manner as possible, and that indeed came to pass.  </p>

            <p>Yeah, I sang some more. =D With the wonderful popularity of the 2010 PPC Carols I decided a few more songs are in order. Unfortunately, I am still not ready to tackle more PPC songs. However I had the time to do a very horrible rendition of Slaughter the World. Yeap.<br><br>And then I went on to do another song called It&#39;s Dangerous To Go Alone. Despite the title, it&#39;s not meant to be a funny song (even though there were some pretty awkward moments while singing it).<br><br>Enjoy!

            <p>Once again, it&#39;s great. However, I do have one minor complaint: The way these were edited makes it a bit hard to understand you at times. Slaughter the World seems to have been either recorded in Mono, or is really heavy on the left side and less so on the right, and while It&#39;s Dangerous To Go Alone is in Stereo (sort of), the music is on one side, and your voice is on the other, which is ultimately produces a similar effect to listening to two different Mono recordings at once.</p>

            <p>Audacity only records in mono for me, so it always comes out oddly at times and I&#39;m never sure how to fix it. :( I wish I had better software (or my old one, because it was awesome) and equipment, too, because I never had such terrible quality when I record, but sadly I only do what I can.</p>

            <p>As some of you may know, a while ago I requested that my Missions be made non-canon a while back after a member of the community voiced a concern that one of my Agents may be more of a risk to the Plot Continuum than a Protector. Now I&#39;m not sure I made the right decision, but I think the problem is a real one and should be dealt with if I want to come back.<br><br>Basically the problem is thus: one of my Agents was kindasorta a piece of an evil god a little. The issue was raised that should my Agent be hypothetically killed, said evil god would reabsorb him and thus know how to get to HQ, and invade the Word Worlds from there. I had actually never come across this detail in my research on this Agent&#39;s race. But if it is a real problem, modifications need to be made. Gizmo from DoSAT? Mind altered somehow by FicPsych? Or should I come back at all? I&#39;d like to hear your opinion on these issues, because I liked writing for you guys.</p>

            <p>The risk of any of the massively overpowered Canons (the Borg, the Replicators, Chaos, etc.) becoming aware of the PPC is a mite bit overemphasized, in my opinion. Why? It&#39;s quite simple. For such an invasion to be Canonical, it has to be published as Canon. Some author out there has to discover the PPC, decide they don&#39;t like us, write an entire invasion... and then convince editors, publishers, etc that it&#39;s actually a story worth printing. Not going to happen.<br><br>On the other hand, if someone writes it without publishing, it&#39;s fanfiction. We happen to be very good at beating down fanfiction.<br><br>For that matter, if an author writes something including us, regardless of if they get published or not, we are the ones who decide if it is Canonical or not. If we don&#39;t want it to be canon, it&#39;s... not. And it&#39;s as simple as that.</p>

            <p>I am going to assume that having a Great Unclean One as an Agent accomplishes something for your story-telling and narrative, i.e. there is a purpose for it being a Great Unclean One instead of, say, a talking aardvaark. If you could figure out what that purpose is, it would be easy to think of an Agent who fills that niche without being a piece of an evil god.</p>

            <p>Since what we have is a multiverse, could it be that Chliever The Corroder could be reabsorbed only if he is in his original continuum? After all, the evil god is supposed to be present only there. If Chliever isn&#39;t in his reach, taking him back would be quite hard.

            <p>I feel that you are being antagonistic and overly authoritative.  I wasn&#39;t comfortable with the fact that people had made Chliever feel so unwelcome as to ask for his agents to be made uncanon in the first place, as that is not the kind of behavior that I like to associate with this group.

            <p>&quot;I am sure that with all the multi-verses and mad science at the PPC&#39;s disposal that something could be arranged to allow this agent to exist with no more than a hand wave explanation required.&quot;<br><br>I don&#39;t know, it would have to be a very, very clever hand wave. Great Unclean Ones are basically like huge Hutts with horns and a very bad attitude. They are composed of nothing but disease and pestilence, and just being on the same planet as one is likely to give you several versions of the bubonic plague. Any sane sentient being would either run away or try to kill it without getting any of it on herself. Great Unclean Ones are, like helpfully already pointed out, physically a separated shard of the chaos god Nurgle himself, and Nurgle himself in turn is a part of Chaos like all the other Chaos gods. <br><br>In a more metafictional sense, the Warhammer 40k universe in general tends towards the ridiculously epic, galactic scale. You have tanks the size of small houses, space marines that are hulking towers of metal with a person inside, and entire planets incinerated at the merest hint of Chaos contamination. <br><br>In this verse mankind spans thousands of worlds and is ruled by the spirit of an immortal God-Emperor entombed in a massive magical-technological device called the Golden Throne. The aforementioned marines are all genetically his direct descendants, too. If the Imperium of Man found out that the PPC is harboring a Great Unclean One they would stop at nothing to destroy it and everything touched by it - never mind the issue with Chaos contamination...<br><br>This pretty much equal to having one of the first tier servants from the Cthulhu mythos as an agent, like a Shoggoth. All I&#39;m saying is that if you are familiar with the 40k &#39;verse, the concept of a GUO as an Agent is rather absurd. The things are barely a separate sentience from Nurgle, a GUO would probably go insane if severed from it.</p>

            <p>OK, to step back: I think that we&#39;re mistaking symptoms for the disease here. In a way, I agree with Artell in that having a plague bringing Great Unclean One strains suspension of belief -- how does HQ cause him to not kill other people by just walking past them? Like, giant hairnets?<br><br>But on the other hand, nearly ALL of our hive-of-scum bad jokes are caused by the execution of said material rather than the material itself. Face it. We&#39;re an inter-dimensional group of wacky squadrons that go into <i>bad fanfiction</i> of all things as if the products of 13 year old fangirls are a curse on all life as we know it. <br><br>Without Permission givers, quality checks, and high standards, how quickly would this devolve into a quality-less mess? Just a few crops of newbies that don&#39;t have to follow standards. Our CONCEPT is ridiculous, even <i>bad</i> in the hands of people who can&#39;t pull it off. <br><br>So if a Great Unclean One wants to exist in PPC HQ, I say fine. I say that he has to have explanation why he doesn&#39;t drop a whole room of interns when he farts or something. And it had better be a hilarious one. And a well-written and clever one: not just loopholes and convolutions that no one but a religious follower of Warhammer 40K canon would get.<br><br>Let&#39;s wait for an execution of this before we determine if this is a Bad Idea or not. If it really is Bad, we&#39;ll say so-- and then the writer is not allowed to get mad at us, but just do better.<br><br>Because we&#39;re pretty good at that.</p>

            <p>You are saying that the reason Chliever should not make his work canon again is that it has no respect for how well things are written and what&#39;s just too much?  I find it hard to believe that this is the case.  You see, I am familiar with the work of Chliever&#39;s major beta-reader.  I know that Neshomeh wouldn&#39;t put her name on anything that lacked respect for good writing and I am fairly certain she knows what is just too much.<br><br>So, either you are mistaken in your assertion or you are calling Neshomeh&#39;s judgment and writing skills into question just as much as Chliever&#39;s.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re misconstruing a general attitude problem as a personal attack. KG never said anything in regards to Neshomeh at all, and I&#39;m sure if he was even aware that Neshomeh was involved in the betaing and permission process, much less aware that his reply would have been taken as a personal affront against her, he&#39;d be far more polite and more selective in his word choice, I am sure.<br><br>Try and cool your jets there.<br><br></p>

            <p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, you&#39;re more than welcome to come back to the PPC - of course we love people here with good intentions, and I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re trying to fix this particular issue.<br><br>However, I don&#39;t think the Agent should come back, at least not as an actual piece of a god. You wouldn&#39;t be able to get rid of that hypothetical, I think; evil gods and their pieces can&#39;t have their inherent natures altered that drastically.<br><br>On the other hand, there&#39;s nothing stopping you making up new Agents - or, as suggested once when this issue was brought up a while ago, have the Agent be a cultist of some kind who just <i>believes</i> he&#39;s a god-piece. Or something along those lines.<br><br>*has run out of useful suggestions, so will leave it at that*</p>

            <p>I know this Isn&#39;t Done, and I&#39;m breaking all kind of laws and whatnot, here. But.<br><br><i>Basically the problem is thus: one of my Agents was kindasorta a piece of an evil god a little. The issue was raised that should my Agent be hypothetically killed, said evil god would reabsorb him and thus know how to get to HQ, and invade the Word Worlds from there. I had actually never come across this detail in my research on this Agent&#39;s race. <b>But if it is a real problem</b>, modifications need to be made.</i><br><br>We are a writing community. This problem is <i>exactly</i> as real as we make it. If you don&#39;t write the re-absorption, HQ, and take-over, it simply does not happen. Perhaps the evil god has more on his mind? Perhaps he is wise enough to know that the deities of those worlds would fight him tooth and nail, good and evil alike? Who knows? The point is, it&#39;s only a problem if you choose to make it one later, and that counts as an Emergency, for which you&#39;d need a consensus of approval, IIRC.<br><br>I&#39;m all for internal continuity, but it&#39;s also a good idea to keep in mind that accidentally leaving a little plothole that would, if this was real, destroy reality... will not actually destroy reality. If you want to keep writing, nobody&#39;s stopping you. If you&#39;d rather have your Agents make a visit to DoSAT and write in that fix first, go ahead. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big issue at all.</p>

            <p>Surely one of the biggest problems that you need to deal with is the plague that an agent of Nurgle will bring to HQ.  Being out of his home continuum would be explaination enough to prevent him being absorbed by Nurgle, but do you really want to bring a plague bearer into the corridors of HQ?</p>

            <p>I&#39;d say probably. Hey, we somehow got the Mysterious Somebody, I can see a character like yours slipping through the cracks - or, more likely, there is a DoSAT device, or a canonical reason, or <i>something</i> that guarantees that the worst will not come to past.

            <p>Hi guys! I&#39;m having trouble with a mission I am writing and I&#39;m wondering what you guys think of it, and if you&#39;re able to help.<br><br>So I am sporking a Fire Emblem fic. It takes place 1000 years in the future of the particular world canon (Tellius) and a lot of silly things have happened. Like races not living in their homelands (for useless convoluted reasons that would never happen or don&#39;t make sense) and fantastic races aging at rates that aren&#39;t normal for them. Granted, there are a lot of nonspecific charges too, like unrealistic combat and invoking hammerspace...<br><br>But I&#39;m having trouble writing this because a lot of the charges rely on knowing the canon. This would fly if it was a LotR fic. You can charge a LotR fic for having Elrond suddenly be Lord of Moria. But if I said I am charging for a Hawk Laguz being the king of Serenes Forest, nobody would know what I mean. When really it&#39;s the same thing and the same joke.<br><br>So I keep having to bog down the mission with explanation of canon. Which makes it not funny and tiresome and more like whining how it&#39;s messing up canon than pointing out the error and letting the absurdity speak for itself. Because people don&#39;t know it&#39;s absurd, and explaining why it&#39;s absurd murders the joke quite completely.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to say this is a bad fic to spork, because it has EXACTLY THE SAME dillemmas as any badfic. But I don&#39;t want to be limited to what&#39;s popular here. Because that defeats the point. <br><br>Is there any way I can introduce the canon information somehow or make it clear something is not right? Because it&#39;s not very funny so far and that&#39;s the worst.<br><br>TLDR; I feel trapped and unable to make jokes that people would get. But shunning the fic for this reason would mean shunning the canon just because less people know it, which is against the spirit of the PPC.<br><br>How can I get around this problem?</p>

            <p>Personally, I don&#39;t have a problem reading missions in continua I don&#39;t know. The reason is that I extract humor from how the agents are reacting more than anything else. If you&#39;re worried about the details of the canon going over our heads, focus the humor on the agents. Use more physical and visual types of humor—the spit-takes, the headdesking, the mad scramble for Bleeprin, etc., and especially any weird manifestations of the bad writing. The mental images will provide plenty of humor.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>To be fair, it can work well even if your reader doesn&#39;t know the canon at all.  I&#39;ve recently been reading through a lot of older PPC stories, including a few set in the Fire Emblem &#39;verse.  Despite having no former knowledge of Fire Emblem prior to reading the stories I still enjoyed them and got probably half the jokes involved.</p>

            <p>I think a lot of boarders here skip the missions set in fandoms they don&#39;t really know. Mainly, I guess, because they think they would not get the joke. Or they read them and accept that they won&#39;t get all the jokes. If something ends up as a charge, that ought to be enough information that something was stupid to do. Explaining the jokes is thus not needed, as the people who know canon don&#39;t need it and others don&#39;t expect it. <br><br>If you think explaining is needed, you could make one of your agents an absolute noob about the fandom they got kicked into. Then everything would have to be explained to them.<br><br>Not all boarders know LotR (blasphemy, I know).</p>

            <p>As you mentioned, it&#39;s hard to explain a joke without killing it. <br><br>The best way to do it when you don&#39;t know who&#39;ll know the canon?<br><br>Have it explained beforehand. Or have mental shortcuts in your explanation. Or give someone the role of not knowing the canon so you can explain it in character without talking to the fourth wall.<br><br>Make comparisons where it works and helps illustrate the point of ridiculous. &quot;Hawk Laguz being the king of Serenes Forest? That&#39;s like having Elrond suddenly be Lord of Moria!&quot;  Looksee, that gets the point across to us doubly. People familiar with both get a doubly absurd image to be amused at, and those familiar with only LotR get to boggle at the wrongness it&#39;d translate to in LotR-terms and imagine what it must mean for the canon being covered.<br><br>There are plenty of ways, just takes a bit of practice and retooling.</p>

            <p>Well, I did some research, but I can&#39;t find it either.<br><br>According to some of the links I&#39;ve found, the fic was written by the user UNpurethoughts on fanfiction.net and should be here: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3102895/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3102895/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3102895/</a></a><br><br>Except it isn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know if the fic was lost, removed, or deleted, but it isn&#39;t there anymore, and no one seems to have archived it anywhere else at this point.</p>

            <p>True, it&#39;s not there... This irks me. Still, the internet being what it is, I&#39;m sure that a copy must be floating around somewhere. The trouble is finding it.</p>
