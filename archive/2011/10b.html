            <p>For those of you who are underprivileged and deprived not to know, November is <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2011/nanowrimo.org">National Novel Writing Month</a>! Although the name is &#39;national,&#39; the event and site and challenge are all international, interplanetary, intergalactic-- wherever you are, you can and should join!<br><br>In brief, the point is this: Write a 50,000 word novel, in thirty days. This is, IIRC, the ninth year or so running, and it is great fun. Since we&#39;re (generally) all writers here, it&#39;s usually something a lot of Boarders do, and there is much commiseration and camaraderie and chocolate and doom and suchlike. This year, though, a new, apocalyptic plan was hatched-- an opening premise for anyone who wishes to join in; a PPC co-write for the month. (Yes, it&#39;s still 50,000 words a person. Otherwise we&#39;d be breaking the Sacred Rules of NaNo!)<br><br>The premise is fairly simple, and was put together in a brainstorm with a bunch of people on the IRC: Every day, at sunrise (local time), 3% of the world&#39;s population disappears. The only rules are thus:<br><br>1: Nobody finds out why it&#39;s happening. <br>2: we never see what happens on the other side. <br>3: No nuclear war or similar apocalypses.<br>4: People beyond the arctic circles vanish at the same rate, regardless of the position of the sun.<br><br>So if you&#39;re in, reply, respond, get a-planning! If you&#39;re one of the many who&#39;ve repeatedly stopped ten-thousand or so short, make <i>this</i> the year of opportunity!<br><br>Techno-Dann has come up with a plan of action for the long-term: write like mad all November, as expected. For December, we take deep, calming breaths, put the project away, and do other things. Then, come January, we pick up the editing and revising pens and get that bit started; February, we do the peer-swap thing and beta each-other&#39;s work.<br><br>He has also come up with a shiny, shiny lure, in case you&#39;re on the fence about joining. When we&#39;re all done, and we&#39;ve got the whole lot written and collected and tied with twine, his sister may be able to get us lovely hardcover copies! And if the lure of shiny apocalyptic hardcover Boarder-written works doesn&#39;t get you excited, quite frankly, I do not know what will-- and I&#39;ve got some mini-Balrogs here, who will be happy to help you make up your mind... <br><br>So! Who&#39;s in?</p>

            <p>From what I know of, it&#39;s more to explore what people&#39;s reactions to such a catastrophe might be, instead of focusing on the catastrophe itself.  In my experience, most stories in which the planet or human race is threatened focus on how to stop the threat rather than what everyone is actually doing from day to day.</p>

            <p>Warner Bros have bought the rights to &quot;The Lies of Locke Lamora&quot;, but sadly no further information has come out about the project. I thought that in the meantime, if there are any other fans around, we could suggest a cast.<br><br>It&#39;s probably bad that I want an actor who&#39;s attracted high levels of fangirl-spawned badfic (e.g. Orlando Bloom or Robert Pattinson) to play the evil mage, just so I can see the fangirls who haven&#39;t read the book flail in glee over the fact that he&#39;s in the movie and then scream after seeing what happens to him.</p>

            <p>I keep hearing you mention this book, but I can never find it, mainly because all the bookstores around me have folded and my university bookstore is sadly lacking in any popular fiction that isn&#39;t teen fantasy/romance (read: vampire novels). What&#39;s it about?<br><br>As for the second part, not really (even though I&#39;ve always had a soft spot for Orlando Bloom and I feel very, very sorry for Robert Pattinson). I always try to find ways to poke fun at fangirls and Mary Sues in a non-PPC context. In one of my current story ideas, one of the characters is a fairly standard Mary Sue Classi...il you find out she&#39;s a lying, ruthlessly manipulative bitch who manages to make things worse every time she walks into a scene. At the moment she eventually gets torn apart by a blind griffin, but that may change.</p>

            <p>&quot;They say that the Thorn of Camorr can beat anyone in a fight. They say he steals from the rich and gives to the poor. They say he&#39;s part man, part myth, and mostly street-corner rumor. And they are wrong on every count. Only averagely tall, slender, and god-awful with a sword, Locke Lamora is the fabled Thorn, and the greatest weapons at his disposal are his wit and cunning. He steals from the rich - they&#39;re the only ones worth stealing from - but the poor can go steal for themselves. What Locke cons, wheedles and tricks into his possession is strictly for him and his band of fellow con-artists and thieves: the Gentleman Bastards. Together their domain is the city of Camorr. Built of Elderglass by a race no-one remembers, it&#39;s a city of shifting revels, filthy canals, baroque palaces and crowded cemeteries. Home to Dons, merchants, soldiers, beggars, cripples, and feral children. And to Capa Barsavi, the criminal mastermind who runs the city. But there are whispers of a challenge to the Capa&#39;s power. A challenge from a man no one has ever seen, a man no blade can touch. The Grey King is coming. A man would be well advised not to be caught between Capa Barsavi and The Grey King. Even such a master of the sword as the Thorn of Camorr. As for Locke Lamora . . .&quot;<br><br>Riddled with profanity and violence, sprinkled with some surprisingly beautiful descriptions, and twisted around enough to keep you guessing. Awesome :)</p>

            <p>The excess of profanity and gruesome death scenes aren&#39;t for everyone, but if you&#39;re okay with those it&#39;s great.<br><br>Depressingly, though, I foresee, if it does gain a larger fan following when the movie comes out, Jean (the resident big guy) being hated on because he&#39;s fat, and Nazca (the mob boss&#39;s daughter) being hated on because she&#39;s a girl. I hope it doesn&#39;t get a large teenybopper following ... Though I do wish I could get my sister into it. Our book tastes overlap sadly very little.</p>

            <p>These agents definitely have a good sense of interplay. It really feels like these are a close group of friends, and I have to chalk that up to the quality of the writing. The dialogue is quite entertaining.<br><br>(SPOILERY)<br>I liked that Cali and Cadmar&#39;s first kiss was not this perfect romantic thing, what with the bumping of noses and the scraping of teeth and the accidentally causing the other person to gag. It felt very real to me.<br>(END OF SPOILERY)<br><br>That being said, I do feel that this story was a bit overly saccharine in places. Hey, I like romance as much as the next person. I have dabbled/am dabbling/will dabble with romantic entanglements in my own writing. But the romance here was just so... easy, I suppose. Even with the above spoiler, it felt simplified and fluffy.<br><br>Plus, I feel a bit like the Truth or Dare thing has been played out a bit. I don&#39;t know. Maybe you might mix it up with some &#39;Never Have I Ever&#39; or something in the future.<br><br>Anyway, it was a little loose in areas but was otherwise a good interlude. I look forward to the future.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the concrit. We&#39;re going to try to work on the saccharine level.  Neither of us ever did the teenage romance thing, so at times it feels like the blind leading the blind. I&#39;m glad you liked the make-out scene. That was hard to write.

            <p>I can honestly agree with the overly saccharine comment, writing romance is a lot harder then one would expect. It would be something to work on, seeing as I will be working with Herr and Miah so much. <br><br>Yeah, Truth or Dare has been played out enough too, by the end, we we&#39;re basically saying we had run out of ideas for interesting things to happen.

            <p>You don&#39;t <i>have</i> to ask for permission at the end of a month. It was never meant to be a formal probationary thing, just a ballpark suggestion for giving people time to get to know you. Feel free to ask for permission whenever you feel comfortable and confident. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yeah, writer&#39;s block sucks. The professionals will tell you to write anyway just to keep your hand in, even if it&#39;s bullshit that has nothing to do with anything, but it&#39;s hard. {= P<br><br>Maybe try something a little different to start with, like an exercise with your characters, to get to know them better.

            <p>Honestly, when I came to the PPC I was already a fanfiction writer with fanfics and original fiction under my belt. I always saw it as kind of like... your resume. You bring your resume to a job interview so the interviewer can review what you can do. I used past work I had created.<br><br>Though, I guess not all applicants are like me... it may even be changing now that many more people are drawn to the PPC through things like tvTropes, which isn&#39;t so much a part of fandom/fanfiction culture as it is a part of internet culture.<br><br>To get on with it, I&#39;d focus most of all on simply trying to do your best. It doesn&#39;t matter so much of what that best is: it&#39;s a resume, so you show us the very best work you can dream up... Just so long as you show us you&#39;re right for the job (In the same way you don&#39;t hire a plumber to do wiring, too much srs bsns in your sample probably won&#39;t coax PGs). <br><br>A great bit of original or fanfiction is way better than a forced bit of PPC fiction. I know with the comparison to resumes and stuff this may seem like a stressful post... but just relax. Permission isn&#39;t too hard to get. And it&#39;s easiest when you put your best work forward, rather than a forced work.</p>

            <p>Anything? Chuck Wendig posts a weekly flash fiction subject on his blog. They are different subjects, but a lot of them lends themselves well to genre-fiction. Just go to his blog and search for flash fiction. Link is NSFW. No, really. I love Chuck Wendig and he gives out great advice, but he swears like a dozen sailors and is creative about it. This linked should not be clicked, while in the presence of your boss, small siblings or elderly relatives with a heart condition? Ok?

            <p>Hello all.<br><br>Unfortunatly, real life concerns back here have made a bit of a muddle of things over the past couple of days. But that is not the main reason I am making this post. <br><br>After I reread the fic I initially planned to spork, it seemed as if the PPC &quot;moral&quot; lines were a little blurrier then I first thought. Granted there is a large amount of canon defilement present and the overall premise of this NSFW work is strange to, if not against, the spirit of Warhammer 40K and the Ciaphas Cain series(I mean, Cain and a CHAOS WITCH?! Gargh!), but even so, I think I may have bitten off a little more then I can chew for my first mission<br><br>With that in mind, I am currently placing the sporking of the fic on hold and am currently examining other, more clearly-definable options. I may return to &quot;Ciaphas Cain in deep&quot; at a later date or I may not. We&#39;ll see what happens.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Church (aka Chris)</p>

            <p>These may or may not be of any use. I like to think I do all right, but heck, everyone&#39;s method varies when it comes to writing.<br><br>Anyway:<br><br>1. Pick your stopping point ahead of time. There&#39;s no rule that says you have to get through the entire fic, just that the canon has to be definitively broken, usually an event that stands out from the badness level of the rest of the story, but not necessarily. Sometimes the agents have to wait for an opportune moment to strike, savvy?<br><br>2. Pick your talking points ahead of time. I like to keep a copy of the badfic in a document on my computer, so that way I can go through and highlight things that I definitely want to cover and also keep track of minis, any other recurring mistakes, particularly hilarious bits, etc. This way, you have kind of a road map to follow when writing. You probably won&#39;t cover everything you highlight, though. This is okay. You have to pick and choose to get a balance between emphasizing ongoing problems, avoiding repetition, and not dragging the mission out past being fun, and some things just aren&#39;t as important as others (even if they are still bad).<br><br>3. Re-read a lot. When I get stuck, I find that it&#39;s usually because I took a wrong turn earlier in the story, and I can&#39;t move on until I&#39;ve located it and fixed it. This often means re-writing large chunks of story, but it&#39;s worth it.<br><br>4. If it&#39;s not fun anymore, you&#39;re doing it wrong. Go do something else and come back in a fresher mood. This, too, may result in re-writing.<br><br>Aster&#39;s right, though—we probably all bite off more than we can chew at some point. The first mission I attempted was a co-write with another Boarder at the time, of a really long, canon-wrecking but otherwise well-written <i>Farscape</i> fic. It . . . totally bombed. The actual point of canon rupture was a LONG way in, and we never got past the first chapter. The fic was later deleted. Such is life.<br><br>But, it is important that the fic is bad enough to sustain humor, which in retrospect I don&#39;t think that one was. I only pick fics with really terrible &quot;so bad it&#39;s funny&quot; writing in them now. In addition to keeping with the rule of &quot;the author must show no sign of actually caring about their work,&quot; they&#39;re simply much better material for humor.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I often hit the &#39;this mission is too enormous&#39; problem, myself. I have two missions in the works at the moment, but one of them (although I have the plot plotted) is just... SO BAD that I am having trouble even writing it without falling into &#39;this is bad. This is also bad.

            <p>Even with lots of missions under one&#39;s belt one can occasionally still get the stage of &quot;what have I done?&quot; &quot;when is this going to end?&quot; It was a particularly bad Stu fic, where everyone was grossly out of character (including the general public) and had horrific spelling and grammar (I don&#39;t usually mission stories that are unreadable for that reason).<br><br>Anyway, I was hating the mission. Didn&#39;t think it was funny and put it on ice. When I came back a month or so later, I found there were some funny moments in it and I was able to take it from there.<br><br>But I don&#39;t do missions of fic anymore that I can&#39;t stand to read through before hand. Yep, it may be bad, and yep, it may need show casing its badness, but a mission is not always the best option. There are a few communities on LJ where you can write a short report on a badfic and show case the worst. Sometimes that&#39;s better than doing a whole mission.</p>

            <p>OK, so I finally finished my new interlude, which introduces my new agent pair. I really, really hope it&#39;s good, &#39;cause I&#39;ve been worried for ages that I screwed it up.

            <p>I really liked it. It had good pacing and the scenes flowed nicely from one to another.<br><br>I was confused when Fix mentions his instincts from the years he spent in gangs, since I thought he didn&#39;t remember them. Does he still have the instincts and then someone has told him where they are from, or how does that work?<br><br>I was impressed with the conversation between Fix and the Marquis.

I know one of my agents, Mittens, had exactly the same reaction.<br><br>I found Carver genuinely creepy, especially when she started throwing blood around, because then it seemed like she knew Fix&#39; weakness and was using it against him. I was relived when Fix called her on it and told her that it wasn&#39;t working and that he wasn&#39;t going anywhere. I imagine that they&#39;ll grow on each other.</p>

            <p>About the instincts thing- yeah, I phrased that badly. What I meant was that he still has the instincts, I just really phrased that badly. *goes to edit*.<br><br>Fix and the Carver probably will grow on each other eventually. It&#39;ll take time, but she&#39;ll lay off the creepy now that they&#39;re stuck together. She didn&#39;t actually know his weakness, she just assumed that he&#39;d either be disconcerted enough to want a transfer, or, if he was some kind of blood-consuming species, he&#39;d be responsible enough to get a transfer rather than risk potentially killing a partner.<br><br>Thanks for the feedback, I&#39;m really relieved to see that at least one person thinks I did it right. *smiles*</p>

He led a rather normal life before, his many weird quirks notwithstanding. His hobbies include reading, composing poetry, shooting pistols, and practicing fencing. He is a quiet person, with a dry sense of humour and a sarcastic and jaded view of the world. He is, of course, rather crazy, even if it does not show most of the time. He is short and thin, with a long, angular face. His small goatee and brown hair are usually kept short.

Of course, that made her all the more interested in poisons... Anyway, she is tall, lean and clumsy (except when she is dealing with her poisons, where clumsiness means an early death), with shoulder-length brown hair and a face that while not beautiful, is quite cute when she smiles (most of the time). She usually wears a green T-shirt, blue pants and snickers. Personality-wise, she is a typical Genki Girl – loud and hyperactive. Of course, she is crazy, but it doesn&#39;t show behind all of that Genkiness and goodwill.<br><br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5811848/1/Artemis_Fowl_and_the_Time_Lord">Badfic to Spork.</a><br><br>Here goes nothing...</p>

            <p>After much deliberation, the first Halloween Co-Write has been announced.<br><br>What it is:<br>After the lights go out at a PPC Halloween Party, there&#39;s nothing more fitting than telling ghost stories- so that&#39;s exactly what the agents do.<br><br>How it works:<br>If you want to participate, then comment on this post and state the agent you&#39;ll use. Because of the unknown number of people participating, each person can only use one agent, otherwise we&#39;d end up with a story the size of a building. The stories should not be sexual, should not contain improper language and should not contain intense descriptions of gore. If a story does, please include warnings so people can skip it if that&#39;s not to their taste. <br><br>Stories should also be understandable without knowing the fandom, if it&#39;s set in a specific place- readers shouldn&#39;t have to look everything up every five minutes. I will write the introduction and ending, and my agent (I&#39;ll be using Grace) will tell the first story. After that, the order will be set by the order people post stories in. People without Permission can play, too. Each story should be hosted on your own site.<br><br>Try to have the story done by October 31/November 1. On one of those days, I will post the link to the introduction here, and everyone else should post links to their stories. I&#39;ll also make a Wiki page for it, too.<br><br>Have fun!</p>

            <p>Hmm, my guys are slated to pick up a repaired CAD in the future, though I intend to make them suffer with bad-haiku!CAD for at least one mission first. Nume has the seniority to get a new model . . . though it&#39;s Ilraen they actually like around DoSAT. Hmm indeed.<br><br>I always thought the devices were black, personally. Wouldn&#39;t any bright colors show up too easily? Also, a spaghetti box seems an unusual shape—the ones I&#39;m familiar with, at least, are long and narrow, not very practical. I guess I figured they fit easily into one hand, like a remote control, only boxier. Or maybe like a tricorder, which has a similar function (scan and provide readout).<br><br>Also, caught a mistake, bolded here: &quot;&#39;This is Technician Second Class Narcolepsy, senior member of the Testing and Application Division of the Department of Sufficiently <b>Enhanced</b> Technology.&#39;&quot; Should be &quot;Advanced,&quot; of course.<br><br>I also read the first story, and I&#39;ll be interested to see how the field testing goes for that one. It can&#39;t go <i>well</i> immediately, that wouldn&#39;t be any fun. *g*<br><br>Snapshot seems to be adjusting well. I love that she has more formal education than the others. <sup>_<sup><br><br>The</sup></sup> level of detail in both stories is really excellent. You sound like you know what you&#39;re talking about, and I can &quot;see&quot; everything, even if I don&#39;t have the technical know-how as a point of reference (or necessarily agree with said descriptions). I may have missed reading other stories with Narcolepsy in them before, but I got a really good idea of how he&#39;s constructed in these, with his eyes adjusting, and &quot;brain&quot; winding up, and all that. Really cool. Good work!<br><br>~Neshomeh </p>

            <p>I spent a lot of time thinking about what the devices would look like, since--and rightly so--they&#39;ve never been truly and exhaustively described in the ten years they&#39;ve existed.<br><br>I picked the boxy shape partly to explain why the things kept burning out--poorly ventilated, crammed-solid design--and partly because it seemed like a good basic design option, modifiable if necessary (as the DOGA CAD shows).<br><br>There&#39;s no reason, of course, that the CADs would have to be made of contemporary computer tech even in 2001--as James hinted at, there were miniaturized tech examples even in those days to be cannibalized, such as the Fallout Pip-Boy. But it seemed like a good way to explain that kind of explosive failure beyond just &quot;The Laws of Comedy&quot;--trying to pack a lot of elaborate electronics into a poorly ventilated, undersized box and then put it into situations well beyond its capacity for handling.<br><br>As to the color, I thought it was funny to have them be these absolutely ghastly shades of plastic--slug-green and burnt orange--and color-coding would be a further way to distinguish between the models than just shape.<br><br>(Also, I get the feeling that Snapshot gets the same question a lot that I got when I was coming up with her--namely, &quot;How can a pony work in the PPC&quot;--and that she&#39;s developed a bit of a chip on her shoulder which is helping with the acclimatization. Round characters unite!)<br><br>(Also also: you&#39;re crazy there is no typo we have always been at war with Eastasia)</p>

            <p>Nothing stopping people from having their own mental image--or, for that matter, from having CADs be heavily modified by Agents to be less unwieldy and basic in the field. I just had to come up with an image since this <i>was</i> a tech review of sorts, so I defaulted to a nice basic handheld box.</p>

            <p>I like the second one a lot, especially since it gives a reason why CADs have been exploding more frequently in mission reports. It also gives an incentive (neat new tech) to not blow them up for Rule of Funny purposes.</p>
