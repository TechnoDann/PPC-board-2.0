            <p>Hi, I&#39;m Tira, and I&#39;m interested in joining the PPC.  I found this place from a link on TVTropes, and it looks very cool.  I&#39;m fond of a large variety of series - Avatar: the Last Airbender and Doctor Who are the most recent, among several.  I do have fanfic-writing experience, though it&#39;s rather limited and I have a bad habit of leaving things unfinished.<br><br>I do have a couple ideas for agents, but I&#39;m not quite sure how well they&#39;ll work.  I should probably litmus test them before I go into detail, but they&#39;re kind of characters I&#39;ve created without a story, and one of them is heavily influenced by Genius: the Transgression.  Would that be okay? Sorry if I&#39;m getting ahead, but I&#39;m really looking forward to the writing.<br><br>Thanks to everyone that bothered to read this, and sweet Arceus, let this actually work.</p>

So I&#39;ve heard of your orginization, cleaning up bad fanfics and saving various canons from utter ruin. I would like to apply for... well, an internship I guess? Whatever you want to do with me? I can do mostly lord of the rings, seeing as how I&#39;ve only really skimmed over what you guys have done, I don&#39;t know much about anything else honestly...

            <p>*A camera turns on, and an excited demon sits down among the various things he got from various friendly members of the PPC* Well, I&#39;d like to thank you for accepting me into your orginization. Despite everything though, I may just spend a month or so in weapons training with this beam sword, though I&#39;m really more of a knife person... As well, I figure I should probably tell you a bit about myself. I&#39;m a demon, but I&#39;m like any other human really, except I need to drink about one glass or so of blood a day to stay alive. Sue blood is fine, which is partly why I asked to join, because no one mourns a Sue. Take note that I&#39;m not neccesarily EVIL anymore... I decided being a force of destruction and death wasn&#39;t all it was cracked up to be.<br>And one last thing.

            <p>Welcome to the board Bluesunnyday and, by extension, Gretalis. I must mention, though, that Sue blood, pure and unrefined, is poisonous in that it could very well turn an agent into a Sue. Your best bet is Water, Sue blood with added caffine. It also has glitter and aura of smooth, though I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s added or is originally found in the blood. Your best bet is the General Store.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PPC Posting Board! I hope you remembered your sanity, that is, to leave it at home where it belongs. You&#39;ll find you&#39;ll have no use for it here. *offers a basket* Have a muffin. Don&#39;t worry, I made a few mistakes with the first batch, but I&#39;m pretty sure these ones won&#39;t threaten to stab you.<br><br>Internship schminternship. Just say hello and act natural, lurk on the board for a month, start thinking about your agents, and ask all the questions you need. We&#39;re a friendly bunch, unless you catch us coffee-less. Once your month of lurking is over, just put up your Agent profiles, a link to a sample of your writing skill, and a link to whatever fic you want to tackle first, and our lovely Permission Givers will give you the thumbs-up or thumbs-down.<br><br>And relax! You look nervous. Have a free lemming. His name is George and he eats walnuts. I&#39;ll leave the others to their pokes and plovers and such.<br><br>Have fun!</p>

            <p>So, for this mission I decided to try something new and fun that maybe has been done before, but I haven&#39;t seen. I wrote the entire mission from the point of view of one of the canon characters involved. In this case, Nick.<br><br>Be warned, it&#39;s kind of heavy on the swearing. I mean, it&#39;s Nick. The man&#39;s vocabulary is dirtier than a used Dutch oven.<br><br>I also made up the fic, because the fanfictional elements I needed for where I intended to take this were way to narrow for me to just troll the Pit looking for one. To my knowledge, there is no Left 4 Dead 2 fanfiction starring a Fiery Redhead named Angela Destiny Norton who horns in on Ellis. Any resemblance to an existing fic is purely coincidental, not to mention unfortunate.<br><br><a href="http://rc273.webs.com/mission3.htm"><a href="http://rc273.webs.com/mission3.htm">http://rc273.webs.com/mission3.htm</a></a></p>

            <p>Kinda reminds me of the Fill the Plotholes I did with Nume and Cameo back when I was just starting to wrap my head around the idea of writing missions--only this is much, much better constructed.

            <p>I know others have said this already, but the POV shift made this mission very entertaining.

            <p>This is the magical land of L4D in which the zombies only show up to make the Sue look good so she can dramatically save her love interest or be dramatically saved by her love interest which never makes any sense because if she was that ridiculously competent she wouldn&#39;t need to be saved so it&#39;s clear at this point that the author&#39;s trying to make her not-perfect and failing or this entire thing is just one huge wish fulfillment.<br><br>*gasp* *wheeze*</p>

            <p>I&#39;m bored and feel like procrastinating on writing a sample piece to join the PPC. The best way to do this- in my mind, anyway- is to make a visual novel. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve always wanted to do, anyway, and what better time than the present?<br><br>The thing is, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;ll be PPC themed (&#39;Cause I&#39;m currently obsessed with the PPC for no other reason than it&#39;s awesome). My question is if anyone cares if I use their characters. If I ever put it online, I&#39;ll credit with livejournals or deviantART accounts or whatever. I&#39;m 90% sure that most of you guys aren&#39;t going to mind much, but if you&#39;re dead set against your character being in it for whatever reason, just let me know and they won&#39;t be. Simple.<br><br>This isn&#39;t a guarantee that your character is going to show up in it, either. I&#39;m still contemplating on the plot line, let alone which characters will show up.<br>Heck, I&#39;m not even totally sure if it&#39;ll be PPC themed.<br>Anyway, just throwing this out there.<br><br>...Actually, would I need Permission to do something like this? &#39;Cause I have no idea, and I don&#39;t have Permission, so...I know that we can do spin-off without Permission, but would this even count as a spin-off?<br><br>Sorry for the wall of text. I hope it&#39;s not too illegible.</p>

            <p>... I&#39;m going to say the following:<br><br>A lot of people do PPC-themed writing samples, and (shockingly, I know) we don&#39;t tend to descend on them in fury. However, as I&#39;m sure you know, a writing sample is intended as a sample of your writing, not your drawing skills.<br><br><i>However</i>, as a sample of visual-novel-ing, a visual novel is ideal. Depending on what you mean by the term, it may also count as a writing sample (depends how it&#39;s done). So my opinion is this:<br><br>Go ahead and do it, with any cameos anyone offers (it&#39;s always best to ask rather than assume - people can be surprisingly touchy about who uses their agents. I&#39;d say you can use mine, but they&#39;re all several years out of date). For permission-giving purposes, we&#39;ll consider it a sample of your narrative skills. Depending on what it looks like, we might then ask you to render a scene in prose form (2-300 words or so) just to be sure - but not a full-length writing sample.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>After all, samples are needed to get an idea of the grammar and overall writing capability of the candidate, so a visual novel gives less informations.<br><br>But sure is a nice and original idea.

            <p>So, yeah...only skimmed the first chapter and I can already tell you that the canons are badly out of character.  They all speak and act like they are five years old (no offense intended to any five-year-olds who may be reading this).  This includes the idea that your first attempt to defend your city should be for your leaders to charge blindly into the opposing army (which also happens to be headed by almost every leader of the other faction, for some reason).  <br><br>Also, the spelling, punctuation, and grammar are frelled.<br><br>And as for ReginaTheNinja&#39;s question: You cannot be a different race than your biological siblings in any world that I am aware of.  It has more to do with the Sue wanting to be extra special than it does with Warcraft.</p>

            <p>Well... You of course have the times when they&#39;re your half-sibling and the parent of both siblings in question has... rather &quot;open&quot; views. It sounds so noble when you describe it as the &quot;love that transcends the boundaries of species&quot;, but when you actually THINK about what that means... eugh.<br><br>Also, you can&#39;t discount the possibilities of the post-birth race change (kind of like vampirism). Of course, either/both of these things, done badly, leads to more Sueness.<br><br>Which should logically lead to more violence.</p>

            <p>Well, since I seem to be falling through the cracks/rejected and I feel that I have improved a bit since the last time I tried, here it is, my newest permission request. (Tell me if it&#39;s redundant, if I already got a yes, it hasn&#39;t reached me.)<br><br>Anyways, here&#39;s my website:<br><a href="http://rmforum.rm.funpic.de/ppc/index.html"><a href="http://rmforum.rm.funpic.de/ppc/index.html">http://rmforum.rm.funpic.de/ppc/index.html</a></a><br>If you have problems reading white on black, scroll to the bottom and change it via dropdown menu. At the moment there are two main links there. One leads to the agent profiles and the other one leads to the (now improved) writing sample.<br><br>I didn&#39;t reveal everything about my first two agents because I already have a raw story line planned for them.<br>About the others: I&#39;m not sure whether or not I&#39;m going to write them and they don&#39;t matter at the moment.<br><br>Oh, and the fic I&#39;d like to take on is the one I linked on the board already: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6843337/1/Angel_of_darkness"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6843337/1/Angel_of_darkness">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6843337/1/Angel_of_darkness</a></a><br><br>~EF</p>

            <p>Your site seems to have some rather annoying pop-ups that are getting around Firefox somehow. Perhaps you can find someplace without them before getting too established where you are.<br><br>As for the sample and everything else, I don&#39;t see why you shouldn&#39;t have Permission, so it is granted. {= ) I will add that the concept of a &quot;srs bsns professional&quot; agent has been done (most recently by Agent Orken), so it may not be wise to push that angle too hard. The idea is only funny because it&#39;s not normal in the PPC, after all. If everybody starts doing it, it will lose its charm really fast. Anyway, how uptight can a guy with blue hair really be? {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Thanks, really.<br><br>I&#39;m aware of the pop-up issue, even though I forgot about them since I have an additional pop-up blocker.

            <p>Oh, Orken.

It&#39;s never quite what I expect, which is awesome.<br><br>Some SPaG issues persist--for one, when addressing someone with a title, as in Agent Thomas, the title always needs to be capitalized. Since you&#39;re writing for Orken, you have to keep an eye on that. I recommend making use of the Find feature when you finish writing; it&#39;s a good way to check that your usage of X is consistent with its context each time X appears.<br><br>My moment of zen: Orken unbending enough to clean up puke.

            <p><font>I just put the standard that <i>Tangodown!</i> will be using as a guideline for what defines Mary Sueism on the website. I tried to make it a bit different from the typical definition, but still encompass it. <br><br><a href="http://delta-mike-lima.webs.com/info/TGD-SPC-MS101.pdf"><a href="http://delta-mike-lima.webs.com/info/TGD-SPC-MS101.pdf">http://delta-mike-lima.webs.com/info/TGD-SPC-MS101.pdf</a></a><br><br>On the FAQs page , I have also written a brief explanation:<br><a href="http://delta-mike-lima.webs.com/apps/faq/"><a href="http://delta-mike-lima.webs.com/apps/faq/">http://delta-mike-lima.webs.com/apps/faq/</a></a><br><font size="2">[...]Thus, under the Tangodown! definition, Mary Sues can be of either gender, and can exhibit traits ranging from the exotic to the mundane; yes, it is just as possible to create a Mary Sue that&#39;s ugly, old, overweight, has nothing in common with her creator, is bumbling and can&#39;t do anything, and yet still qualifies as one just as much as it is possible to create a Mary Sue that&#39;s half goddess and half faerie queen, divinely beautiful, inhumanly proportioned, shares the author&#39;s taste in just about everything, and can solve every problem in the story with a flick of her finger. Sure, many people who write them choose to take the exotic, but by the Tangodown! definition, a Sue can be made to undermine the integrity of the story it&#39;s in regardless of the traits their author endows them with, can be written by either a fan-fiction writer or a canon author, and can appear in good and bad literature.<br><br>A deliberate loophole is left for the ability of the audience to enjoy the story on its own, or other merits. However, often times these are the very same factors that will directly affect the ability of the audience to enjoy the story. </font><br><br><br>Anyone have any questions or feedback? </font><br></p>

            <p>My first thought: Redundant, because the PPC Wiki has a very very involved Mary Sue definition already.<br><br>My second thought: This is pretty much exactly the same as PPC standard Sue definition, and condensed into a different format from the wiki entry-- simplified for brevity, as well.<br><br>My third thought: You have an on-site reference to what is essentially the PPC standard, which is more of immediate glossary reference than redundancy, sort of like an official document. I see lots of these sorts of appendices in official docs I sort, so that almost has an inside-the-fourth-wall implication that just as your spin-off has more of a military spin, so does the supplementary material.<br><br>In other words: Just as most branches of the PPC are shaped like themselves (Anime division has tons of anime-like antics, video game division makes lots of game references, lit divisions use literary in-jokes) so is <i>Tangodown!</i> in that respect<br><br>Conclusion: Don&#39;t see anything wrong with the definition or having it there. You may want to link to the long-format Mary Sue entry on the PPC wiki-though. This is a spin-off, and thus isn&#39;t exactly self-contained.<br><br>But still, I admire the completeness of the definition, without going into the variation between many individual Mary Sues-- which is what the Wiki is for, anyway and you&#39;d not want to post about in the first place. :)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m SolusLunes, and, like most people, found the PPC through a TVTropes wiki walk. It seems like it would be something I&#39;m interested in, considering I (for some reason) enjoy reading badfic (for certain values of enjoy) even though if you heard me reading it, I&#39;d be bitching the whole time.<br><br>I am also... disposed to anger on the butchering of languages, especially written by native speakers of the language.<br><br>I&#39;ve got quite a bit of experience writing/trolling fanfiction, as I&#39;m a regular on the Touhou-Project imageboard, due to one of my friends asking me to write there.<br><br>So I lurked. I read stories. I was shocked by the massive number of &quot;mai waifu&quot; stories. My path was clear. I would write. I would write a fanfiction on this site.<br><br>40,000 words and several dead touhous later, many will not read my story due to &quot;you killed my favorite touhou&quot;. Others like it because of that fact. Either way, I think the PPC will be a very nice melding of &quot;terrible fanfiction that I found but can&#39;t stop reading&quot; with &quot;sue brutalization.&quot;</p>

            <p>Hey, it&#39;s been over a month since I joined, and I&#39;d like to ask a few things about getting Permission. This is /not/ a Permission request: I just wanna get some advice on how to do it.<br><br>So: what kind of writing sample should I submit? How can I properly introduce my agents in it? What should I avoid putting in it?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m nearly up on my month of lurking/learning, so I was wondering on Permission as well. Mainly, is your writing sample a sporking of badfic, or is it something else entirely? Do you just propose the badfic that you intend to spork and wait for approval before proceeding, or do you spork it right off the bat and put that up for Permission givers to review?<br><br>(Sorry for tacking on to your questions, Karen!)</p>

            <p>Your writing sample is a sample of your writing, in one form or another, it doesn&#39;t have to be a sporking, and it doesn&#39;t have to be a PPC story or have your agents. <br><br>You are welcome to claim badfics ahead of time for missions or sporking if you like.<br><br>Permission piece, as DS said, cannot be a mission.</p>

            <p>From what I&#39;ve sponged up lurking about and poking my head into permission requests, a writing sample&#39;s only real purpose is to make sure that you have a good grasp of English, grammar, spelling, and proofreading/beta&#39;ing. <br><br>Some form of spork would be fine, but you should <i>not</i> use a PPC mission for your writing sample. </p>

            <p>Basically, they can be anything but an actual mission or other continuity-affecting story. An introductory piece with one&#39;s agents is pretty common, and it is useful to give us an idea of what they&#39;re like as characters. It could also be a completely unrelated original piece, or fanfic, or whatever else, though. We&#39;re really not picky; we just want to know that you can write decently, that your agents aren&#39;t Sues, and that you aren&#39;t going to try to overhaul/destroy/&quot;fix&quot; the organization. {= )<br><br>Tacking on questions is fine, by the way.

            <p>So, this was proposed by Adamantine via IRC, and I thought it would be a fun idea. Basic plan is this: One person puts up four or five riddles in the &quot;Invisible Idiot&quot; style, and everyone takes turns guessing. The person who gets the most correct posts up a new set and so on.<br><br>For those of you not familiar with the concept of an Invisible Idiot riddle, it&#39;s based on an old joke about a translator who rendered &quot;out of sight, out of mind&quot; as literally &quot;invisible idiot&quot;. As for the formula, words are separated by semicolons, and parts of words are separated by commas.<br><br>A good example of how an Invisible Idiot riddle works would be &quot;Guardian; Scheme; Carry on, a noise made when confused&quot;, which would give you &quot;Protector; Plot; Continue, um&quot;, or Protectors of the Plot Continuum. (Credit for that riddle goes entirely to Adamantine.)<br><br>One last thing. Don&#39;t forget to share the topic for your riddles.<br><br>Topic: PPC<br><br>Gaseous celestial body, flora; Functionary<br>Corvid; Lycium<br>Wattles; Fowl<br>Antiphon; Cynosure</p>

If someone stole yours, it wouldn&#39;t count, because everyone would be able to see you had them first. Also, by this logic you&#39;re the winner. In case you hadn&#39;t figured that out already.

            <p>You tend to use commas too much, when you should be using periods, or shouldn&#39;t use them at all. It&#39;s not that much of a problem, but too many commas lead to run-on sentences, which tend to detract from the flow of the narrative, which is a shame because otherwise it&#39;s quite good. <br><br>See what I mean?

            <p>Yeah, I can see how it would be disruptive. Thank you, I am glad I could make Luxury interesting.

            <p>I haven&#39;t actually posted it yet. :$ But, this is the first time I&#39;ve heard about the dummy thing, and since I already have 7 pages to the mission and am looking to get it edited and posted in about a week or so, I&#39;m not feeling eager to preform a major re-edit at this point.

            <p>I used it in only one mission, and my Agents even forgot to take it back.

            <p>I was wondering, because of the way Cadmar was having trouble triggering the spells.

            <p>Thanks for the compliments! I am glad I got Luxury&#39;s personality good, that was my biggest concern. And thanks for linking it to the Crash Dummy page, I never actually thought of that. The shark teeth thing just popped up with the &#39;shark like grin&#39;, and I just HAD to do it. <br><br>As for the wands, they were disguised as students, and wizards as well. The reason he was having problems was because he couldn&#39;t remember some of the spell names, I am hoping to make something more out of Cadmar having a bad memory. I actually have no idea what spells a Muggle-Use wand can do, it would be something to look into. </p>

            <p>Yeah, I took down the original request so I can radically rewrite it. I&#39;m gonna try portraying ??? differently...but I really do want to have his name be a point of some confusion on his partner&#39;s part. He&#39;s hopefully going to be portrayed differently. Until then, I thank you all for your opinions.</p>

            <p>Bit late to the party, but the idea just popped up; what if she calls him something different each time, since he won&#39;t deign to share?

            <p>Actually, I debated having him change his name with each mission, but that would just get too confusing, in my book. Maybe Karen tries to guess his name and gets the most ridiculous ideas about what it could be, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;d change his name constantly. </p>

            <p>Disclaimer: I&#39;m not a PG but i&#39;ll give you my 2 cents anyway.<br><br>I&#39;m seeing enough errors that I&#39;m going to go line by line:<br><br>First thing I notice is a weird transition at the end of the first paragraph. It implies that the agent is actively being lectured by the flowers, but that is not the case. <br><br><i>recently assigned to the Department of Mary Sues</i> <br><br>Of all the things to say for the very first descriptive text of Karem you use that? This is the introduction! This line should give you the foundation of this character&#39;s personality. It shouldn&#39;t tell you what department she&#39;s in. <br><br>I don&#39;t have the same problem with parenthesis that DML does: the insert about Triple seems to fit fine, although the exact words are a bit clumsy. <br><br>I also disagree with DML about the front-loading descriptions. They have their place, and the first introduction of the main characters can certainly stand to have two sentences each of description. It&#39;s to-the-point and not remotely purple. <br><br><i>After a moment’s consideration, Triple walked over to the right side of the room and placed his armchair near the bathroom door.</i><br><br>Did his armchair become pocket-sized since the last time it was mentioned? <br><br><i>Triple called over his shoulder, speaking in a cultured  accent.</i><br><br>A what?<br><br><i>Radiating about twenty feet from the door in all directions on the walls, ceiling, and floor were scorch marks that told the explosives expert a very large bomb had recently gone off in the RC.</i><br><br>I would think that his memories would tell him more than his bomb expert skills. The intro implies he was involved in causing it. <br><br>~~~<br><br>Okay, my first impression of Triple is that he&#39;s just unlikeable. My face is literally scrunching up reading him. He&#39;s got super strength and could easily do the job that multiple people are having trouble with, but he won&#39;t because he&#39;s a prick. <br><br><i>Triple’s lower left eyelid began to twitch sporadically.</i> <br><br>At this point I&#39;m surprised he has a human face. I was expecting some kind of ceramic mask instead. In fact, it makes it easier for me to swallow that he&#39;s an inhuman statue. I can&#39;t imagine an actual person like this. <br><br><i> “Cease at once, or I will not allow you any of the Bleeptea on the upcoming mission.”</i><br><br>Awesome. He&#39;s her boss too. <br><br><i>  “Celebrian.” Triple spoke without inflection. His partner immediately collapsed on the floor and began to twitch in a way that was altogether disturbing. </i><br><br>And he&#39;s abusive and manipulative. Seriously, this is just horrible. He&#39;s sociopathically torturing his partner. <br><br>There is literally no flaw you can give to this guy that will justify how much of a prick he is. Why do you hate Karen so much that you give her this as a partner?<br><br>Sorry, but Triple is unsalvageable as a character. I strongly suggest starting over with him. </p>

            <p>AFAIK it&#39;s discouraged to make your writing sample for a Permission request actually about the agents you write for. <br><br>1) Am I just misunderstanding, and it&#39;s actually perfectly fine, as long as it&#39;s not an actual mission?<br><br>2) Just about everyone writes their agents in the permission request anyway. Does the Permission Request page need to be fixed to make it more clear this is frowned upon?<br><br>3) Should that policy be changed?

            <p>In a question what a writing sample could be about, Neshomeh stated <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=210701;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a> that it could be about anything that wasn&#39;t an actual mission. She added that an introductory piece about one&#39;s agents was both common and useful.<br><br>So:<br>1) yes, you seem to be misunderstanding.<br>2) Writing agent introductions is not frowned upon; the wiki-page should reflect this.<br>3) The policy is already different so it doesn&#39;t need to be changed.</p>

            <p><font>Howdy there.<br><br>I&#39;m not a permission giver, but I can give you a bit of honest feedback. The beginning of the episode rubbed me the wrong way; it felt like an infodump. This tends to be something I seem to see quite a bit in badfics and as a result, describing all your character&#39;s clothes and minutae up front raises quite a number of red flags at the start of the story. <br><br>Another thing I tell everyone is to <i>avoid parenthesis in your narration.</i> Using them to inject sides into your narration is a big no-no, especially if they stand out from the rest of the narration itself or completely take it in a different direction. Doing so tends to be sloppy work. As a rule of thumb, <i>never</i> inject exposition in brackets into your narration, ever, as it tends to break up the narration itself and detract from the feeling of reading it. <br><br>If you can use indents, as well, use them <i>or</i> block paragraphing, but never both simultaneously. I prefer to try to use manuscript (indented) formats, because block paragraphing tends to cause the story to become too spaced-out and as a result of everything been to spaced out, linebreaks lose their presence, especially if you&#39;re viewing it on a large-format display like mine in plaintext or HTML; that&#39;s another reason I use PDFs for my work, because some HTML forms parse out spaces unless you word them using character codes which are a clumsy and awkward way of doing it. I suggest looking up a tutorial on how to do manuscript format; Google returns a lot of good hits and that&#39;d probably be a great place to start for formatting. Formatting&#39;s always a killer and I still find myself tripping up over it from time to time. <br><br>Thirdly - flaws are <i>not the be-all end-all</i> way to avert Stuism. Under the definition that I follow [Tangodown!, 2011], a Stu is a character that undermines: <i>a) The believability, consistency and/or integrity of its own portrayal, its setting, its author, or the ability of the audience to suspend disbelief.</i> Triple stands out as something that deliberately tries to be too cool, and as a result tends to cut it very close for me. Character flaws, either great nor small will affect this, but it is <i>perfectly</i> possible to have a Sue that displays character flaws and still manages to meet one of or all four of the <i>Tangodown!</i> criteria. While I know that not telling everything up front is a good thing, bear in mind that most readers <i>will</i> develop first impressions of both the character <i>and your ability</i> to write very quickly and in an environment like the PPC&#39;s, arguably where we&#39;re trying to <i>show up other people&#39;s Mary Sues</i>, there&#39;s not much room for error. If his calmness and perfection is a facade, take it, play it up, run with it. Just <i>never</i> figure that you&#39;re going to be able to take it and run with it later. Keep your audience in mind; net audiences are something of a mixed bag on the internet; often they <i>will not</i> take your word for it that &#39;it gets better later&#39; and just move onto the next thing. Because your series will not be a coherent work on paper sitting on someone&#39;s desk, it is likely they will see some parts of a story and not others. Saying &quot;it gets better later on&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m saving that for later on&quot; is an extremely easy trap to fall into, and it can be dangerous.<br><br>Lastly, treatment of &quot;newbies&quot; like that isn&#39;t something I personally would encourage or like to see. Jokingly referring to &quot;FNG Syndrome&quot; is one thing. Going out of your way to label, then marginalize or sideline a group is another. <br><br>Good luck and keep writing. <br><br><b>Further Reading</b><br>DML, (2011, May 4), <i>Tangodown!

            <p>In all honesty, I did not like the writing sample.  The spelling, punctuation and grammar were fine, from what I could tell, but there were a number of other problems.<br><br>1) ??? being what he put on the application is a good idea, but carrying it over into the story is not.  I think it would have been better to use whatever name his partner calls him, or something of that nature.  It is hard for someone like me, who hears the words in his head as he reads, to translate ???.<br><br>2) The Vampire Rant.  Just... No.  It completely took me out of the story.  It would have been fine if it had been from the character, rather than the narrator, and if there were some reason for the rant.  So far as I can tell, there is little about this character that would lead me to say &quot;that guy is a vampire.&quot;  So, to have a rant like that, with no provocation, just seems really off.  Also, if you are going to put something in a story, it is just stupid to tell the audience to disregard it.  If you don&#39;t want us to pay attention to it, then don&#39;t put it there in the first place.<br><br>3) ??? has superhuman strength, the ability to remember and recite the List Of Things I Am Not Allowed To Do In The PPC beyond 1176 rules, his furniture is unaffected by an explosion in a confined space, and he looks perfect ALL THE TIME.  His only flaw is that he hates being dirty.  And that seems not to be a flaw so much as a berserk button (even though he seems to have no emotion) that causes him to threaten a Maintenance worker and his family for something that would be out of said worker&#39;s control.<br><br>4) Karen is really paranoid that the Flowers are out to get her.  So, why is she still here?  Why did she join up in the first place?<br><br>5) Explosion in the RC and the bricks.  I&#39;m asking.  I see no reason for either thing, though you may have reasons in mind.  Also, how did she manage to harness people to the sledge?  That takes a fair bit of work and would not be easy if the person being harnessed was struggling.<br><br></p>

            <p>1) I&#39;ve been having trouble thinking up a name for him, actually...though I&#39;m debating just naming him &quot;Triple&quot; now, because of a prior name.<br><br>2) My friend is convinced he&#39;s a vampire...yeah, I was thinking about cutting it before I posted, but then I just decided to see what people thought.<br><br>3) He&#39;s actually got more flaws...he&#39;s from a story I wrote a looong time ago, and I&#39;m trying to revamp him for this. I like expanding on characters as time goes on, not telling people everything at once, so I&#39;m trying to only write what a first impression might give of him. There are plenty of other small quirks of his...and he gets very embarrassed by people finding out about them.<br><br>4) Karen&#39;s paranoia about the Flowers is only trumped by her hatred for badfic. Also, it&#39;s partially fueled by the fact that she used to stomp on plants as a child for fun. Now she&#39;s met talking Flowers...and she&#39;s worried they&#39;ll want revenge one day...<br><br>5) For starters, you&#39;d be surprised how a whack to the head can stop people from struggling enough to get them into a harness. The bricks are for the old fashioned oven she&#39;s going to build, and the last RC got blown up because she was attempting to bake with nitroglycerin. <br><br>I&#39;ll try to make some revisions based on what you&#39;ve told me.

            <p>A nickname like &#39;Triple&#39; feels like an anticlimax compared to something like &#39;???&#39;.

            <p><font><br>I have a particularly low opinion of what&#39;re often perceived as &#39;meaningful&#39; or &#39;deep&#39; or &#39;appropriate&#39; names. <br><br>As a general rule, I do not spend more than five minutes thinking about a name for a character. Instead, I leave it up to a random name generator (this is easy for me, as I don&#39;t bother with fantasy or otherworldly names) and if I don&#39;t like what it spits out, I hit it up again until I find one that I like or play mix and match with the ones that do, then I make sure it&#39;s appropriate to the character and appropriate to the place the character&#39;s set in. I don&#39;t think many of us get to choose our birth names; why should any other fictional character&#39;s? Our parents generally name us after things that sound good, or in the directions that they&#39;d like us to aspire to be, or even things they associate with things they like, but of course, a person belongs to nobody but him or herself.   <br><br>Trying to typecast your character&#39;s name is usually something of a waste of time. Of course, sometimes you&#39;ll find that names are oddly more appropriate than you originally expected, and if that works, then great, power to you, but otherwise, don&#39;t concern yourself with such things right off the start. Focus on what makes Bob or <i>Quel&#39;no-vanta&#39;bedda&#39;name</i> unique and memorable as a <i>character first</i> in terms of development and portrayal, personality and backstory --who they are, what made them that way, and <i>why</i>-- and the rest of the bells and whistles will sort themselves out of their own accord, and often you&#39;ll find that you&#39;ll get better results out of that approach than trying to be everywhere at once or deciding on what makes that character special up front. <br><br>Having a good, rock-solid, believable and consistently well-portrayed and justified background <i>alone</i> will make your character special all on its own. You don&#39;t need exotics, mystery, or special names to accomplish this feat.<br><br>In all honesty, I think what you should be focusing on is what made your guy what he is, what experiences he&#39;s been through, the lessons he&#39;s taken from them, and how that&#39;s shaped his outlook, worldview, and personality. Start there. <br></font></p>

Hmmz, sometimes.<br><br>There will be times when one WILL want to pick the  &#39;meaningful name&#39; route-- especially if their character is a symbol or some other literary thing. But it should never be obvious, if one wants to go that route. And other times, one will want a random name. <br><br><br>But sometimes, neither of those are good enough. It&#39;s just that far more than meaning goes into a name. One must consider the sound of the name, for one. Should a name sound hard or soft? What emotions should it invoke? What background should it give the character? Should it even sound different from what you&#39;d expect of the character for purposes of contrast?<br><br>Consider these names?<br><br>A warrior named Dash.<br>A warrior named Brutus.<br>A warrior named Sir Helmson.<br>A warrior named Dagzut Gutsmasher.<br>A warrior named Patience.<br>A warrior named Arcandeth.<br>A warrior named Bob.<br><br>Yeah, they were all two second names, but how do they make you feel when you hear or read them? They all invoke drastically different sounds, influences, backgrounds, and feels.<br><br>None of these were concocted in particular for a character I had in mind to write in the future.

            <p>I agree that the character&#39;s character and actions should be memorable, more than his name. But considering that most parents spend more than five minutes thinking up the right name for their kid, it is likely that a character&#39;s parents would do too. So when a writer starts to name a character, she has to take in consideration who the parents are and what they would name their kid. This process can take up much more time than five minutes.<br><br>In this case there is a character that has decided that he doesn&#39;t want to give his real name and filled in ??? on the form. That says something about the character. It also leaves his partner with something she can&#39;t pronounce. This could be a good scene for when the agents meet, or it could be a running gag throughout several missions where she tries out different things to call him (such as &quot;hey you&quot; and &quot;Uhm&quot;).</p>

            <p>That was actually gonna be a running gag for my first few missions. I thought it could be entertaining to have Karen constantly trying to figure out how to pronounce his name, or trying to think up a good nickname.<br><br>And...well, honestly, I do have another conflict with the 5-minute name thing. Over the course of my life, I have come to the philosophy that a name influences a person. Have you seen that phone commercial, where the guy&#39;s debating getting a phone for his mom, and decides to name his kid Brian because he thinks a Brian will &quot;make eye contact, answer e-mails,&quot; etc? People&#39;s names are a big part of what they grow up to be. A Selena is a totally different person than a Tabitha. Zachary is nothing like Earl. They&#39;d probably all laugh at an Agnes, whose name would influence her life quite a bit in that regard. Names are how we see ourselves: I could not see myself as anything other than what my real name is. I really do think that a name is a serious matter when thinking up a character.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll admit, there&#39;s some merit to your argument. It might be a perspective thing. There certainly seem to be multiple views, going by what I&#39;ve seen so far on this discussion. I just am of the personal opinion that a name will help define a person.

            <p>Names can effect you growing up.  I have a name that was different enough in the small minded town I grew up in set me apart. I can&#39;t say the all the bullying I got as a kid resulted from that, but in my experience once small kids pick a person to pick on that person tends to remain the one picked on, and it doesn&#39;t take something huge to set up the initial bullying volleys. Bullying does effect a person&#39;s personality.<br><br>That said, whether the person named Zachary is actually that much different than the person named Earl, I don&#39;t know. However, what other people <i>expect</i> from those names are different.  What people expect are formed from many sources.  As a personal example (and no offense to anyone out there with this name who is a nice person), I have never known a man who goes by the name Lee that is a decent human being.  Neither has my husband. Many other people that I know have said the same thing.  These were all different actual names, Lee, Leon, first name, middle name, whatever the person was widely known by the name Lee.  They were all terrible.  I would never name my kid Lee, if I thought people were going to use that name for his day to day interactions. <br><br>Now, I have known several people who had Lee somewhere in their name that went by a different name.  My husband for one has a middle name of Lee.  He goes by his first name or one of a couple of nicknames based on his first name. I&#39;m obviously of the opinion that he is a pretty great guy. This was actually an issue while I was pregnant with my third son, as people on both sides of the family swore they would never call him by the first name we had picked out, and we&#39;d planning on using Lee as a middle name.  We picked a middle name neither of us minded hearing. The families called him that name for about two months, and then decided he&#39;s just not a ______, he&#39;s a (name we all swore to hate). Go figure. <br><br>Like I said that is just a personal thing for me, but if a man introduced himself to me with &quot;Call me Lee.&quot;  My reactions to him would not be the same as if he had introduced himself as Zachary or Earl, so while the actual person&#39;s personality may not be effected--the reactions of other people might be.  I know I have read articles in a couple of magazines to this effect, but I cannot find them now.<br><br><br><br>One last thing. I spent considerable more than five minutes picking out the names of my kids. For characters it goes different ways.  Some characters I purely make something up, although this usually ends with me finding out later that what I thought was nonsense is in fact a real word or name. Others I go the random name generator route. Some I think about a lot.  For one of my agents I traded my kids something for the use of a name they had made up.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m gonna come down on the side of &quot;names are important&quot; and basically agree with Miah: the name itself may not shape who you are, but it absolutely affects how people form expectations about you and react to you, and the same goes for characters. The way I was taught, if the name you choose for your character doesn&#39;t tell you something about them, you&#39;re doing it wrong. That doesn&#39;t mean it has to spell it out in bold-face neon, like Suethors do it--far from it. At the very least, though, it has to suit them (as well as being appropriate for the setting). For me, it always boils down to &quot;it feels/sounds right,&quot; but there&#39;s a lot that goes into that. Some names sound happy or sad, thoughtful or careless, strong or weak, etc., and that&#39;s because of a) the sounds that make them up, b) associations with other bearers past and present, and to a greater or lesser extent, c) the etymology. I&#39;ll often spend quite a long time searching for the right fit if the character is meant to hold a prominent role, taking all the above into consideration.<br><br>Careless naming can come back to bite you. For instance, why on Earth or off it would a self-respecting guy choose to call himself &quot;Supernumerary&quot;? I have some idea why <i>now</i>, but when Nume started turning into a real character instead of a silly joke name for use in games of Fill the Plothole, it was an issue for me. I&#39;m really grateful that &quot;Evarel&quot; turns out to be a variation on a real name, or I&#39;d have faced a serious dilemma when writing the former RP character into my original fiction, which is on the more realistic side of the fantasy spectrum. (The idiot still insists on bynaming himself Starshade, but that&#39;s just the kind of ridiculous showboating thing he would do, so it works.)<br><br>As for myself, I took ages to choose Neshomeh as my Internet name, and I picked it because it means something relevant to me and, more importantly, it sounds like me. I didn&#39;t choose any of the other words with the same meaning because they didn&#39;t fit. Neshomeh does. This is terribly important online, because let&#39;s face it, if I was still calling myself SoulFinder, you guys wouldn&#39;t look at me the same way: the first thing you&#39;d see of me would be two words smushed together by a silly high school girl who hadn&#39;t thought better of it yet.<br><br>Names are important.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I also considered changing my username as well. It slowly became non-indicative about myself as I change over time.

            <p>Actually, I just found a list of names from a particular region (Cornish, in this case) and looked through it until I found a name that I thought sounded cool. His real name isn&#39;t actually Lanyon...he just named himself that so people would have something to call him that they could pronounce. His real name is hoooorrible....and will be revealed during a mission at some point.... Anyways, in this case he actually did pick out his own name, and he&#39;s such a freak about order and neatness that it had to be something he thought fit him. I&#39;m not trying to make it deep or meaningful--I&#39;m just trying to make it a name he would have decided to let people call himself. His past&#39;s still slightly blurry, but I have a fair idea of what it entails, and how it made him who he is. That&#39;s influenced part of why I think he would choose that name for himself.</p>

            <p>Maybe you could pick something that really *is* ridiculous, but he thinks is deep and profound--possibly have it mean something odd in another language, maybe Spanish or German (something common enough that people will get the joke). There&#39;s quite a bit of humor value in that. This guy sounds like he&#39;s got way too much dignity for the laws of narrative comedy not to be knocking him down a peg or two.</p>

            <p>It can be a difficult thing to make me laugh out loud at stories sometimes. You, however, managed to do it twice during the conclusion of this mission.

            <p>So yeah, I finally thought up a partner for Whin! Just wanted to run this by people for some feedback and whatnot.<br><br><br>Agent Name: Anya<br>Full Name: Anya &quot;No Relation to Isaac&quot; Asimov<br>Age: 23<br>Height: 5&#39;10<br>Species: Human<br>Home Continuum: Generic Action Movieverse #373<br>Bio: Born and raised in Siberia, Anya is the daughter of an &quot;Evil Scientist&quot; character who, when he&#39;s not busy building deadly weapons for the glory of Mother Russia, enjoys spending time with his beloved wife (a former secret agent and femme fatale) and children.<br><br>Anya is the third of five children, and the only girl. As such, she grew into quite a tomboy competing with her brothers for attention and toys. Anya&#39;s mother trained all the children in hand-to-hand combat to prepare them for all the danger a Generic Action Movieverse entails, but as Russia slowly became less popular for movie villains, the family settled into a rather quiet life.<br><br>When she was 14, Anya&#39;s father brought home a business card belonging to a PPC agent who had recently passed through the area. Anya was immediately interested and signed up for training.<br><br>Anya graduated near the top of her class, majoring in literature and minoring in Sues, and was shuffled around a bit before being partnered with agent Whin Crane-Petty. A stoic foil to Whin&#39;s chaotic hyperactivity, Anya fit the role nicely, corralling the younger agent when needed and allowing herself to open up a bit more.<br><br>Anya&#39;s social skills aren&#39;t the greatest (you don&#39;t meet many people in rural Siberia), and she prefers to stand back and take orders rather than lead a charge. She comes off as cold sometimes, but her silence stems for from shyness than arrogance. She has a bit of a complex about her height, and becomes rather depressed when it&#39;s brought up.<br><br>While trained in melee combat, Anya prefers using guns or other long-ranged weapons. She has a soft spot for old firearms, especially Tommy Guns.</p>

            <p>Hello, everyone! Behold my permission request, for it wants nothing more than to be read.<br><br>Agents: Kara and Regina. Both agents are in the Department of Mary Sues, and specialize in Yu-Gi-Oh fanfiction.<br><br>Kara Lewis:<br>Kara has blonde hair, usually worn in two braids, and brown eyes. She tends to be hyperactive, excitable, and impulsive, although she usually gets (a bit) calmer when she&#39;s actually on a mission. She often thinks of rules more as guidelines at times, which gets her in trouble with the Flowers. She also appears to REALLY dislike her former partner, who was kicked out of the Department of Mary Sues for setting one fire too many.<br><br>Regina Carter:<br>Regina has short brown hair, blue eyes, and quite a few freckles. She was a real person who was inserted as a bit character in a badfic against her will, and was recruited by Kara. She has confidence issues and is a bit paranoid about getting into trouble for breaking rules. Most of the time, she can be a bit of a doormat, but sometimes (usually if someone is messing with her lust object) she gets very vocal and very violent. <br><br>I have longer character summaries on my website. I also have my writing sample there (under &quot;Missions&quot;). The website can be found here: <a href="http://agents-kara-and-regina.webs.com/"><a href="http://agents-kara-and-regina.webs.com/">http://agents-kara-and-regina.webs.com/</a></a>. The writing sample can be found by itself here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1w9fG8sWcpEbEksDAuRRzo3Z6nlA0uwkEtTKjkPWiyqM"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1w9fG8sWcpEbEksDAuRRzo3Z6nlA0uwkEtTKjkPWiyqM">https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1w9fG8sWcpEbEksDAuRRzo3Z6nlA0uwkEtTKjkPWiyqM</a></a>.<br><br>The fanfiction I plan to use for my first mission is here: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4561499/1/Beyond_the_Void"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4561499/1/Beyond_the_Void">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4561499/1/Beyond_the_Void</a></a>. This is also the fanfiction that Regina comes from.<br><br>If I forgot something, please let me know and I&#39;ll add it.</p>

            <p>I agree with DS that the tense shifts and sudden appearances of &quot;I&quot; in the narrative are a little disjointing, but not enough to make reading unfun, so whatever; it&#39;s your spin-off, your narrative style is up to you.

            <p>Disclaimer: I am not a permission giver. I will now proceed to give you my 2 cents anyway. <br><br>The biggest problem with the writing sample is an inconsistent narrator. It waffles between being a neutral omniscient observer (with a snarky personality) and being from Kara&#39;s perspective. It should be one or the other. Another thing about an omniscient narrator - they know what&#39;s going to happen, so it obviously wouldn&#39;t have said &#39;fortunately Kara was only aiming for Regina&#39; since it already knows everything will go horribly horribly wrong.<br><br>Another big violation is that it uses &quot;I said.&quot; There should never, ever be a first person pronoun used by a narrator in a third person perspective fic. <br><br>I also note:<br><br>1)Tense inconsistencies. Her skills shouldn&#39;t be described in current tense if the story is described in past tense. <br><br>2)Logic fail. Someone getting hit by a water balloon is not a quiet, easily missed event. People tend to scream in surprise, water splashes everywhere. Most likely the whole cafeteria will be aware of what happened after the first one, if not the second one. <br><br>3)Logic fail 2: Even if not everyone in the cafeteria noticed right away, how the heck did Regina miss it? While silliness is embraced in the PPC, unless Regina hails from the Looney Toons world this is still a stretch. You didn&#39;t even mention anything that might distract her enough to not look around. <br><br>4)This is obviously the start of a mission. You shouldn&#39;t be writing any part of the mission at all until you have permission. </p>

            <p>So the review was harsher than I intended. I like Kara&#39;s energy, and I like the kooky enthusiastic narrator, it just needs to be more consistent. <br><br>Also the fact that it&#39;s a mission intro probably isn&#39;t an actual problem, since you never actually entered the fic. <br><br>I will look forward to reading your missions if/when you get permission!</p>

            <p>So as to avoid double posting.<br><br>Well, first of all, many thanks to PoorCynic and DML who betaed the sample piece.<br><br>I&#39;m applying two agents for DMS, Freelance division, namely:<br><br>Joan Ford, about 40 years old, a Tolkien-elf raised in Earth, probably a Noldor since she has black hair and grey eyes. She was adopted in a Led Zeppelin show, and has two bad habits: a nervous tic, which makes her cover her ears with her hair, and the necessity of talking about her relatives --who have always done something similar to what she&#39;s witnessing/talking about, etc.-- Apart from that she&#39;s balanced, usually not showing the normal amount of insanity of an average agent&#39;s until she gets to kill the Sue. She also has an issue with shiny things. <br>Bob Nothing, 15 Yshkatk-ian years, more or less 22 Earth years. In fact, Bob has an unreadable/unpronounceable name, which made people call him something easier, and no surname. He&#39;s still in his freshman year, in the PPC as well as dealing with the many new races he&#39;s meeting everyday, so he usually sticks his foot in his mouth or is close to it; he also finds everything funny and is constantly amused. He thinks <i>even</i> the Laws of Narrative Comedy and the Ironic Overpower are funny and is constantly tempting them; of course, they don&#39;t fall for it that easy, but eventually they&#39;ll teach him not to tempt them.<br><br>This is the sample:<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nptwmo6nuv4fn0qkcRn4Yk4ZWZStkox9bKd67V09Q6c/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CMeU4J8J"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nptwmo6nuv4fn0qkcRn4Yk4ZWZStkox9bKd67V09Q6c/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CMeU4J8J">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nptwmo6nuv4fn0qkcRn4Yk4ZWZStkox9bKd67V09Q6c/edit?hl=en&amp;amp;authkey=CMeU4J8J</a></a>#<br><br>And this is the fic I intend to spork:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5343123/1/Beyond_Love"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5343123/1/Beyond_Love">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5343123/1/Beyond_Love</a></a><br></p>

            <p>Very nice assassination method there :) .<br><br>Am I mis-remembering, or did the Suethor plagiarize the opening of &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; at the start of her fic?  The first two quoted paragraphs remind me of Watson talking about Irene Adler, but I&#39;m posting from work and my books are at home.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been most of a year since I was writing very much on the Board!  Real Life and Original Fiction have conspired to keep me away, for the most part, since August or September.  The Real Life was awful, but at least I made significant progress on my original fiction (hooray!).  Scanning the recent posts, it actually seems like a lot of us are reappearing right now.<br><br>Anyway, my next task is to get down to writing a mission.  Hopefully, I remember everything about the PPC - I&#39;ve been rereading a bit of the original series and trying to figure exactly out how Improbable AU will work for the kind of stories I&#39;m doing.  Should be fun!</p>

            <p>Your sample piece was quite good-- I didn&#39;t spot any grammatical errors. Granted, I do have a bit of an issue with the formatting, which needs a bit of work-- either stick to one line between each paragraph, or indentation every single new line. Or both, preferably. That, and I&#39;ll expect language warnings on your pieces if you&#39;re going to be swearing-- we do have a pg-13 code, so language warnings are a Good Thing.<br><br>But those are both very easy fixes; your characters are interesting, your grammar and spelling are excellent, and your writing style is nifty. Permission granted! I look forward to your missions in general.</p>
