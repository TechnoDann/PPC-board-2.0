            <p>Well, after a couple of weeks on-off reading through the above named fic, I would like to present my findings in preparation for my first potential sporking or in case anyone would wish to spork it before I apply for Permission.<br><br>When I was examing the Unclaimed Badfic for a potential fic to spork, I was naturally interested in this work due to my understanding of Warhammer 40,000 and due to my recent completion of reading three books of the Cain series (“Death or Glory”, “Duty Calls” and “Cain&#39;s Last Stand”). <br><br>The Ciaphas Cain novel series was a series of novels set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe by author Sandy Mitchell. The series covered the exploits of the humane, yet self survival orientated Commissar Ciaphas Cain, from the years 931 to circa. 997 within the 41st millenium (40K&#39;s setting). These events are portrayed through the context of a number of accounts compiled by a member of the in-universe Inquisition. Accompanying him on his journeys with an Imperial Guard regiment is his loyal, psychic-nullifying and foul-smelling batman and aide, Jurgen, and the Commissar is in frequent contact (and often, employ) with the editor of these “reports”, Inquisitor Amberley Vail of the Ordo Herecticus of the Inquisition.<br><br>Generally at first, I would say that the fic itself wasn&#39;t too bad due to poor SpaG (despite the fact the fic did seem to have an annoying tendancy to utilise very short join on sentences where a simple comma would have been sufficient). However, the true problems with the fic are in regards to the canon warping that is within – the author seemed to have tried to write an PWP (Pron Without Plot) fic in the context of the Cain series...<br><br>Am I the only one gaping in utter shock here?<br><br>Now at the time of writing, only two chapters have been completed, but even then, this did not stop me from trying to tear it apart.<br><br>The first chapter opens in a fashion similar to the core material – Inquisitor Vail provides a general overview of the situation. Here, it seems as if the author is trying to establish the continuity that is being based on, which is OK. However, it does get somewhat redundant by the third paragraph, with some noted hyperbole involved within the passages – a trait which, in my own reading of the Cain series, Inquisitor Vail never showed in her notes.<br><br>At last, the fic begins proper and already, we have a problem. It is observed within the canon material that Cain never outright states in his records when many of the documented incidents take place. However, in this fic&#39;s case, this is the only indication of setting we read:<br><br>“The city was like any other in the Imperium. Office buildings, habitats, parks, and roads. What was different about this one was the Ork warband invading it...”<br><br>There is no indication of what planet this chapter is set on and a very generalised description of what one can assume is an Imperial hive-city is presented. With regards to the “difference” cited, the Orks have been firmly established in canon as a warmongering species plaguing many of the worlds in the Imperium. Thus, the probability of an in-progress Ork invasion setting a hive-city apart from most within the Imperium is practically next to nil.<br><br>What follows is three to four paragraphs of combat material which, at its core, serve as conveying Cain and Jurgen from Point A  (the streets of a financial district) to Point B (the interior of “an ordained bordilo”, according to some badly placed Vail side-notes.). The remainder of the fic, however, is where things take a strange and horrifying turn.<br>As Cain and Jugen enter, they find a gathering of young women who, to Cain&#39;s shock (and my disbelief), killed themselves in what appears to be some kind of summoning ritual for a daemon of Chaos.<br><br>Now, wait a minute! We have gone from an Ork invasion to the discovery of a Chaos cult – and there has been NO explanation whatsoever regarding the cult itself, why they did what they did and, most importantly, what they had to do with the Ork invasion practically at their doorstep. But the Orks, as with most logic here, is thrown out of the window as all bar one of the cultists is killed. BTW, Cain&#39;s shock doesn&#39;t come from genuine human concern, but from “ … seeing the dark haired girl’s perfect skin being ruined. A quick secession of blood splattered her from the other women.” <br><br>What?<br><br>So, the surviving cultist in question somehow gets possessed by a daemon of Slannesh and immediately goes to work on Cain. I&#39;ll spare the details, but by the end, the daemon is somehow banished or offed by Cain and Jugen and somehow the original victim of the possession survives and Cain suddenly has a more erm, … basic instinct in mind for the girl.<br><br>Three paragraphs of graphic content later, the Commissar hits on the bright idea of shipping their “prisoner” off to the Inquisition as a sex slave. The chapter abruptly ends there, with Vail noting the usefulness of her newly acquired slave.<br><br>What. The. Heck?!<br><br>First, the whole incident is clearly forced and contrived, with absolutely NO explanation regarding the presence of the Chaos cult, their relevance to Cain&#39;s role in the campaign or how their involvement really related to the Ork invasion. Second, it baffles the mind as to why would these events even be relevant to the overall plot. The latter half of the chapter is not related to the overall chapter storyline and does not progress the overall narrative in any way.<br><br>Lastly, and probably the biggest violation of them all, is this – why was Cain not shooting the cultists? The fact that he clearly fraternised with the enemy, a witch possessed by a daemon of Chaos, throws every single tenant of the Imperial Creed back at the Departo Munitorum&#39;s face. According to the “Imperial Infantryman&#39;s Uplifting Primer” , which all enlisted ranks and Commissars should possess and know BY ROTE,:<br><br>“Harbouring Psykers and/or Witches:<br><br>Any soldier found harbouring or withholding information regarding one he knows as touched by the Warp (unsancioned psykers, witches and warp freaks) will be whipped, have his eyes put out and then hung until dead...”<br><br>“Heresy:<br><br>Any soldier who … incites heretical action or thoughts … and generally behaves in a manner disrespectful for all that is holy and good will have his extremities removed and be left to bleed to death for the Emperor&#39;s pleasure. The body will then be burned to ensure that no taint remains.”<br><br>So, as you can see, because of their actions, Cain and Jugen would already be liable for two death sentences  – the portrayal of these characters towards the core of the chapter is clearly unprofessional in their capactiy as part of the Imperial Guard and borderline heretical in the eyes of the Imperium&#39;s authorities - a vast gulf of a difference to the normally law-abiding Cain and Jugen of the canon material.<br><br>I shudder to think what the next chapter will bring …<br><br>+Hail to the Emperor+</p>

            <p>So after last chapter&#39;s efforts, it is clear that I am NOT looking forward to this. But still, “Knowledge is Power&quot;, so on we go!<br><br>Now, I have to give the writer credit – this chapter does try to present a lengthier narrative. But, the old problems still remain … and in some cases might be worse; I defer judgement on that matter.<br><br>Anyway, as is the norm, we have the opening spiel from Vail and AGAIN, we have no indication of what planet Cain and co are on, so it just adds to the confusion. Additionally, once again, we have the author&#39;s jarring punctuation and sentence structure.<br><br>Now call me pedantic, but I find this excerpt from the introduction rubbing me the wrong way:<br><br>“… While there he had a chance encounter with a Sisters of battle unit. As you know, the Sisters is military force composed of only women. Though they don’t have the super human abilities as Space marines. They try to model themselves as such.”<br><br>I can already see this is going to go down the poop chute, but I&#39;ll go into the Sister issue later.<br><br>Alright, so basically, ANOTHER hive city has fallen under attack, only this time the attackers are the Chaos Space Marines, one of several canon baddies. Problem is, Chaos Marines are normally broken down into Traitor Legions and rogue elements – throughout the ENTIRE fic, we have no idea as to what faction within the CSMs this warband belongs to.<br><br>Worse, it looks like the author&#39;s perversion of Cain seems set to continue. Here&#39;s an excerpt:<br><br>“...Thinking about all the wonderful things he’ll do once back at the base. Maybe the female soldier who likes to rack up infractions will be there waiting for him. Speaking of racks, ‘she sure has a nice one‘, thought Cain. He, and she would figure out interesting punishments together. Sometimes Cain would take her punishments for her.”   <br><br>Emperor protect us!<br><br>Eventually, the convoy Cain is returning with falls under attack by … possessed Thunderhawks (?!) and in the resulting confusion, Cain is separated from the others and is forced to make his way back to an Imperial Guard encampment on foot. However, on his way back, he stumbles over a 15-(wo)man squad of Sisters of Battle – again, the author gives us a basic description of them, but does not specify if they belonged to a specific unit or not. In other canon where there aren&#39;t any major sub-factions, this would be fine, but in a wargame like Warhammer 40,000 – where all major factions are broken down into individual regiments, Chapters, warbands etc- this can be downright confusing.<br><br>The apparent leader of the group, Sister Mary (yes, that is her name!) assigns a squad-member, Sister Cindy (*sighs in annoyance*) to check Cain for weapons. Whilst doing so, Cain has perverted thoughts (like THAT is any surprise here!) and the Sister stumbles across....<br><br>No. No, I dare not say! If you want to know the gory details, read the fic yourselves. I dare not put the exact details to print. Sufficed to say, I quote:<br><br>“ “Wow”, said Cain with a dumb look on his face [...] “ I thought you Sisters couldn’t have sex.” “We can, but don’t tell a lot of people about it. Otherwise, they’d want sexual favors all the time. Even if people talked, nobody would believe them. We pick men we like to help us out from time to time. Especially when it comes to the initiates. We use men to smarten them up, and besides, every girl want’s her first time to be with a handsome man,” said Sister Mary. ”<br><br>Are. You. Kidding. Me?!<br><br>After that little escapade, Cain and the Sisters continue en route back to Imperial lines when a roving Chaos band jump them … as well as some kind of creature the author fails to describe that manages to freeze up the Sisters who weren&#39;t killed. Cain, at this point, gets the hell out of dodge then, after a 30 minute pause, heads back to the ambush site. He observes the aftermath of the skirmish and is SOMEHOW able to pick up a conspicuous trail the Chaos squad left behind them- without the author telling us what that might have been comprised of. After following the Chaos Marines, Cain manages to locate the craft the Marines evidently have come down planet-side in as the crew and some of the Marines&#39; minions emerge to take the spoils of war inside the vessel... barring Sister Cindy, who the previously undescribed, mutated Chaos Space Marine promptly separates from the others in the ship&#39;s cargo bay and begins to have its way with on the spot. Cindy&#39;s Sisters fare no better with the crew.<br><br>Cain manages to find a loading crane nearby and having figured out the controls (failing to explain where and when), he attacks the mutated Marine and drags him away from the helpless Cindy. He then, bolt pistol blazing, attacks several crew members as he drags the stark-naked Cindy out of the Chaos warband&#39;s clutches as they mount a war-bike and make their escape.<br><br>What follows is, to me, probably one of the most poorly justified sexual encounters within this work. And that&#39;s saying a lot. Having evaded the mutated leader of the band, Cain speculates that because the creature screamed out “Virgin!” in anger (or something like that, the author doesn&#39;t say), he believes that &#39;doing the deed&#39; with the Sister of Battle then and there would throw it off their trail. I quote:<br><br>“There was a crashing sound through the woods. A loud hideous bellow of “Virgin!” was coming from where Cain, and Cindy left their break area. Cain knew they could not outrun the monster. They would need food, and rest while the creature wouldn’t. There was only one thing that could be done to get it off their trail, and hopefully lose interest. When Cain thought they were far enough. He turned to Sister Cindy. “Do you trust me enough to keep this monster from following us?” asked Cain. “Yes,” said Cindy looking him in the eyes. Cain walked up to her sliding his arms around her...”<br><br>What?! How the heck- WHAT?!! That&#39;s pushing it, even within the madness of the 41st millenium!<br><br>So, four paragraphs later (in which, I kid you not, the pair have been described as LOVERS (HERESY!)), the little moment is rudely interrupted as (surprise, surprise!) a mushroom cloud appears on the horizon and alerting them to the presence of the mutated leader who had been stalking them.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry – What? Stalking them … in a wooded area …. in THREE INCH THICK POWER ARMOUR?! You know why there was a reason the Imperium Space Marines have Scout squads (apart from recruit training)? Even if you are careful, POWER ARMOUR IS NOT SILENT!<br><br>So, with the Chaos Marine hot on the pair&#39;s heels, Cain and Cindy bolt, heading towards an open field. Unfortunately, once they reach the clearing, Cindy trips and falls, with the Chaos Space Marine closing the distance rapidly. Cain is rammed into and sent spinning to the ground and, just when it looked like he was about to be crushed, a series of bolt rounds slam into the traitor, blowing him clean in half.<br><br>It is revealed in the last paragraph that a Space Marine (loyalist) Thunderhawk had taken notice of them and had opened fire. Landing, the transport disgorges a Space Marine squad, as well as their leader, a Captain of no particular Chapter or name. When Cain questions the Captain as to how he was able to locate them, the Captain replies that they had been tracking them every since the Chaos frigate - which I am assuming was in orbit, as those things are normally about three kilometres long-  had been destroyed (which was never mentioned earlier in the fic). <br>It was also revealed that the groundside vessel had been destroyed by Sister Mary, who now stood proudly with the others, battered and sans armour, weapons and clothes, but alive.<br><br>The final passage ends with the following exchange. I&#39;ll let it speak for itself:<br><br> “ … “Maybe you can brief me about it,” said Sister Mary with a smile. “Sure, a long hard briefing with the three of us sounds good.” said Cain. “Captain is there a place on the thunder hawk that me, and the Sisters of battle can debrief in private?” asked Cain. “Yes, we have a guest lounge that you can use,” said the Captain who misunderstood the humans’ real reason for the room. Since Space Marines weren’t made that way. ”<br><br>So, that brings us to the end of this chapter and the current fic&#39;s progress. Is this chapter an improvement? I&#39;d say yes … barely. To the writer&#39;s credit, it looks like the narrative had been given a bit of thought and the action is drawn out a bit more. Unfortunately, the majority of the old problems within the first chapter are still there – Cain is still horribly OOC, the narrative is contrived and lacking depth, social norms and law of the Imperium are left in the gutter and the sheer implausibility behind the scenario is almost laughable.<br><br>I especially reserve criticism for the portrayal of the female protagonists of this chapter – the Sisters of Battle. According to established material, the Adepta Sororitas are an all-female warrior order dedicated to the protection of the Ecclesiarchy (the Imperial Church) and its personnel and assets, as well as acting as the Chamber Militant for the witch-hunters of the Ordo Hereticus (one of three major sub-divisions within the Inquisition). These women are constantly involved in their duties – when they are not involved, they spend their time in training or in prayer. They are indoctrinated in the teachings of the Imperium and are fanatical, practical and down-to-earth.<br><br>Because of this and their appeal, it is also presumed that, similar to nuns of the Roman Catholic church, that this order would be celibate. This question ran back and forth amidst the fan community and remained as speculation until “Cain&#39;s Last Stand”, where Sandy Mitchell provides her own input on the topic by having Cain observe a strange occurrence – a Sister of Battle discreetly leaving a representative&#39;s quarters late at night, concealing herself with a robe over her clothing. Inquisitor Vail&#39;s foot-notes read:<br><br>“... Contrary to popular belief, the Adepta Sororitas doesn&#39;t require its members to remain celibate, though few find the time to take advantage of the fact.”<br><br>So, it could be said that the Sisters of Battle are NOT required to be virgin in order to serve, but even so, I found the portrayal of the Sisters in this chapter very jarring. Instead of acting like the zealous and faithful warrior women within Warhammer 40,000 background, they initially act more like sexually-repressed women who haven&#39;t “gotten involved” for decades. It is an offence against their tenants, their faith and their creed and this interpretation destroys any believability about Sister Mary and the others and their impending plight.<br><br>So, what&#39;s my conclusions on the work thus far?<br><br>Overall, S.P&amp;G for this story wasn&#39;t bad – just a few minor errors and multiple sentences that could be joined together to make sense. <br><br>However, here&#39;s, in my opinion, why this fic just doesn&#39;t work:   <br><br>- Any fan derivative work of a canonical source needs to adhere to established social and cultural norms within that universe, with leeway provided for unusual situations or any facts that are open to interpretation. This work does none of that. Any form of established Imperial law is more or less out the window in favour of providing pointless, plotless graphic material. I&#39;d be a little more convinced if it was, for example, an incident between a Guardsman and, say, another Guardswoman or civilian (at least THEN, we&#39;d be given benefit of the doubt), but a Commissar, an enforcer of Imperial Guard doctrine within the rank and file, openly cavorting with a Chaos cultist and a member of the Adeptus Sororitas WITHOUT repercussions? Rogal Dorn is rolling in his grave!<br><br>- A PWP is a very risky form of fiction to construct because the writer has to justify the situation that (inevitably) takes place and establish this through strong narrative material. This fic is badly constructed and offers little to no reasonable justification for the situations that occur. For example, in the case of the incident between Cindy and Cain: if it was established they may have known each other through the Scholea Progenium and may have possessed feelings that had been suppressed in their respective organisations, then I might be convinced. But as it stands, lack of justification for the incidents, as well as the implausibility behind them, only serve to degrade this work.<br><br>- Worst of all, this fic fails to connect between the canon characters of the original canonical material and the cut-outs we are presented in this. The entire writing is dry and humourless, providing none of the wit and characterisation that author Sandy Mitchell has crafted over eight years and all canonical characters are clearly OOC. I could easily replace Cain with a rogue Imperial/traitor Guardsman and it would have no impact on the fic&#39;s direction whatsoever.<br><br>But, as I mentioned earlier, this is till a work in progress. Whether the author will improve or not, I can only speculate. For now, I watch, pray and hope...<br><br>+The Emperor Protects+</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not much of an expert on Warhammer, but I have read the first Commissar Cain omnibus, and I would say that it sounds like you have a solid case.<br><br>But you say that it is only two chapters so far. Is the author still in the process of writing? Because in that case you might want to consider something else for your first sporking and leaving this for now. It would be a shame if you gave it a really good spank... um, I mean sporking and then a new chapter was added with even more potential for comedy.</p>

            <p>Hmm, I understand your skeptisism - it is a bit too early to tell, given it&#39;s age (almost a month and a half since the last update). I&#39;m not sure whether the author in question intends to update this in future, but I&#39;ll keep my eyes peeled.<br><br>As for other fics, well, I might do a bit of research through FF.net and see if I can bring anything up. My only regret is that my only mainstream part of literature that I would know in any considerable depth would be Lord of the Rings.<br><br>I had originally considered the CoD fic, &quot;The Beta Threat&quot; (something that was in the Unclaimed Badfic area), but I must urge reconsiderment - it looks like the &quot;badness&quot; in it may be a deliberate trolling effort, vis a vie a genuine, erm, accident (?)<br><br>In the meantime, I&#39;ll keep my eyes open.</p>

            <p>If a story looks like an author is still active with it, there&#39;s always the chance that in the next chapter things would get even more out of control. (Am currently looking at such a story myself. There&#39;s a nice break off point at the end of chapter 10, but then in chapter 11 there&#39;s a mini I&#39;ve never seen before, and in chapter 12 a canonically mild mannered character goes on some kind of revenge rampage, and the only reason to include that in the mission is to slap the OC with a charge of piling plot contrivance upon plot contrivance. The other reason to mention it is that the author has more or less challenged me to find fault in her story.)<br><br>Anyway, what I wanted to say: you can sometimes wait a long time to mission a story if you are going to wait for the author to stop adding stupidity to their story. If you can get a nice mission out of two chapters, there&#39;s no real reason to wait for the third chapter. There may be more comedy value, but it may also be more of the same.</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m currently examining the second chapter now.

            <p>So, I am writing an interlude (still WIP) for my Agents, and I need a little help.<br><br>- Characterization check on Techno-Dann and the NPCs. I don&#39;t want to get them wrong.<br>- Beta, as usual.<br>- Maybe a little cooperation with Astral Void for the part in which my Agents and hers are going to met.

            <p>My idea was that they &quot;crashed into hello&quot; when Sergio and Corolla exit from DoSAT. Maybe Grace was trying to sneak into DoSAT to er... borrow some pieces for something she was building, maybe something else, your call here. Grace notices the planes Sergio has in the box that inevitably fell and opened itself, and they start talking about that.<br><br>Since I noticed that you write on the Board in &quot;decent&quot; hours, I thought we could cooperate through Googledocs. It has the support for multiple people writing and a built-in chat, so we can decide when (using GMT as reference.

            <p>There was no need to explain that, obviously I want to have an explicit approval for the chase scene, as I think very few Agents would be able to get away with this &quot;evil&quot; act (even if it&#39;s a sincere mistake).

            <p>He too owns a Beretta 92FS, but he actually won&#39;t change it for anything else, as he thinks more stopping power isn&#39;t useful if you have much less bullets in the magazine. He actually uses magazines from the Max Payne continuum - 18 round per clip. As usually .45 pistols don&#39;t get past 12-13, he thinks he has an advantage.</p>

            <p>Well... since we&#39;ve had a lot of badfic stuffs going down as of late, I thought I&#39;d change it up with something that angers me to no end:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7357739/1/Assassin_Effects"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7357739/1/Assassin_Effects">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7357739/1/Assassin_Effects</a></a><br><br>See that fanfic? It&#39;s an Assassin&#39;s Creed/Mass Effect crossover. For all intents and purposes, it&#39;s not bad. The Shepard is a bit of a Sue, but the writing is mostly all there, there isn&#39;t a grammatical error in sight, and it&#39;s interesting.<br><br>Until you read THIS:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5719759/1/Creed_of_the_Shepard"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5719759/1/Creed_of_the_Shepard">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5719759/1/Creed_of_the_Shepard</a></a><br><br>Now, I want you to notice something about the two, and then get back to me.<br><br>I&#39;ll wait.<br><br>[waits]<br><br>Figured it out yet?<br><br>Yes. Upright Man plagiarized from The Inner Hollow&#39;s story, almost word for word in some sentences. The structure is exactly the same, the backstory is exactly the same... the only thing that changes is the utterly idiotic way the Shepard expy holds on to the &quot;Auditore&quot; subtitle.<br><br>I defer to the subject for everything else.</p>

            <p>...but knowing how the FF.net admins work, they&#39;re probably going to wait about a month before they do anything about this.

            <p>At least, if you are trying to create a fanfiction, you are drawing inspiration from canonical sources and adding your own twist on the fandom - whether through original stories set in the universe, original characters becoming involved or other such ideas.<br><br>But this, this blatent disregard for an author&#39;s original fanfiction work ...

            <p>Just to vertify, I did a quick comparison between the two fics mentioned. Sadly, the evidence speaks for itself and has resulted in my most strongly-worded review I had given on FF.Net to date. <br><br>Bear in mind, I was utterly dusgusted:<br><br><br>&quot;I admittedly took a quick gander through this fic out of mild interest and it seemed fine...<br><br>That is, until I saw the only review and decided to conduct a quick comparison. I know it may seem pointless getting worked up like this, but let me be frank:<br><br>I was outraged.<br><br>What the HECK possessed you to plagiarise another person&#39;s work - a crossover which had been written over a year BEFORE this? Before YOU became a member? The overall structure, the narrative flow; Heck, about 80% of the WORDING was EXACTLY THE SAME!<br><br>I&#39;d pray that the author you ripped off doesn&#39;t find out, because there will be trouble - if either the author or administration catch on, you&#39;d be out of here faster then you can say, &quot;Whoops.&quot;<br><br>You plagiarist!

            <p>Ella Darcy from Department of Author Correspondence joined at ten in 1999; she&#39;s possibly the youngest agent ever. But she wasn&#39;t a field agent until the LotR fic explosion of 2001-2003, at which time she was anywhere from twelve to fourteen years old, barring the wobbliness of HQ time. She&#39;s from World One, too.<br><br>Fourteen seems to be the youngest age that a World One human is allowed to start going on missions. Obviously, non-human species have different ages. <br><br>There&#39;s the case of Mikaela Hamilton, who was hired as an agent at fourteen but persuaded not to go into the field until she was older... So there is precedent for unusually young agents joining the PPC and working in non-action jobs or as interns under experienced agents until they&#39;re old enough.<br><br>It&#39;s not necessarily a matter of popping her into the Nursery; her age is already pretty odd, and if she was preparing breakfast (with a stove no less) while being described as a &quot;toddler&quot;... well! Age might be more-or-less irrelevant for her.<br><br>She&#39;ll still be small until she gets older, though; and you probably do need to be strong enough to assassinate a Sue or restrain a possessed canon.<br><br>It would be interesting, actually, to have a child Agent from a world where children aren&#39;t particularly coddled, as they are in World One. I know Ender&#39;s Game is quarantined... We already have one from Hunger Games. Maybe the Giver trilogy? Not from one of the Communities, obviously; but from the more &quot;primitive&quot;, wilder areas where children often have to grow up quickly; and you&#39;d get the bonus of a possible minor power to play with, too.</p>

            <p>I usually avoid Marriage Contract stories on the basis of finding cross-generational pairing generally squicky but I found a rare one... that I liked.  I ran into this interesting example in my trevails through the Pit of Voles.  Yes, the contract turned out to be fake but...<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7306781/1/The_Contract"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7306781/1/The_Contract">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7306781/1/The_Contract</a></a><br><br>Perhaps it&#39;s my shipping inclinations or my funnybone, but in light of the despairing turns the Authors current project is taking (thus alientating many of the current reviewers) I found it quite nice.  And that&#39;s despite the possible OOCness (being a fanoneer now, My scale is rather imprecise) and general ridiculousness of the scenario.</p>

            <p>There is a question on some Mary Sue Litmus tests that asks: is she trying to escape an arranged marriage?<br><br>I&#39;m not into HP and haven&#39;t clicked the link, but by &quot;Marriage Law&quot; I imagine you mean: the law says that so and so have to get married. And not some law that says: two people voluntarily sign a contract that they will take care of each other and the law offers them certain tax benefits.<br><br>So the idea of forced marriage is a trope across fandoms. It&#39;s just that there&#39;s more room to imagine there will be laws that force marriage among wizards because they have a different culture.<br><br>Arranged marriages may seem romantic to those that never have to deal with them.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not big into HP fanfic myself.  But from the link, apparently the pureblood families are severely inbred (which <em>does</em> seem to match canon), so a law was passed requiring marriages between purebloods and Muggleborn/halfbloods.  It&#39;s more a eugenics measure than a true arranged marriage, but there may be some elements of &quot;arranged marriage is romantic&quot; in the fics.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve seen ones that go way beyond a eugenics program to keep the in-breeding down. I&#39;ve seen a couple (and I don&#39;t read that much HP) that involve forced marriages as part of the punishment scheme for death eaters. It isn&#39;t pleasant.</p>

            <p>The punishments often involve bearing a certain number of children.  <br><br>One of them that I read was that all those even sympathetic to the Death Eaters were arrested and given a potion to make them get pregnant (male and female) and were then only given in &#39;marriage&#39; to the first person to impregnate them by force (in the Ministry offices, no less). The potion also bound their magic and the magic of their babies, and gave them some kind of disease that made them slowly starve to death over a year or two. Oh yeah and wizard babies can&#39;t be bottle fed, so the babies whose &#39;mothers&#39; died then starved to death. The first chapter starts with Harry severing all ties with everyone he ever liked in the books and raping Snape. It was a long fic, and somehow managed to be one of those that is like a train wreck or some other disaster that you just can&#39;t look away from.<br><br></p>

            <p>((Hi, guys! Just a couple of ground rules to keep things running smoothly:<br><br>1. When you join in, just add your response to the end of whatever the most recent post is, to keep just one string of sequential posts. That way it should be easier to keep track of what&#39;s going on and we can all respond to each other easier. When the string gets too long, we&#39;ll come back to the top and start a new one.<br><br>2. Don&#39;t worry about your characters being &quot;late&quot; if you can&#39;t get here straight away. This is the PPC and people live in their own time warps. :P Turn up whenever, we&#39;re in no rush.<br><br>3. Keep posts in the past tense. It&#39;s easier to read, and it&#39;ll make it much easier for me to put together if I think it&#39;ll make a good interlude.<br><br>4. No controlling other people&#39;s characters (unless you have explicit permission). (I did get kgarrett&#39;s permission to use Miriam in this post, by the way. :P )<br><br>5. And of course, OOC stuff gets marked somehow, but you all know that. <sup>_^</sup> Here we go, then!))<br><br><br>Three people surveyed the Really Very Tiny Auditorium. It was covered with a rather odd mix of Potterverse- and Lord of the Rings-themed decorations, but then again, &quot;odd&quot; was a matter of perspective here. The birthday girl had picked them, after all, and it made perfect sense to a five-year-old to put the Great Hall of Hogwarts next to the Shire. The party snacks, which had been... er... obtained from outside sources, were set out on a number of trestle tables along one wall. There was a stereo set up for music in a corner out of the reach of grabbing little fingers, and a playpen in another corner for any particularly small children who might arrive.<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; Cara said, shaking back the cape of her Dunedain Ranger outfit, &quot;I think it&#39;s looking like a success.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I still think having William do the decorating was cheating,&quot; her partner pointed out. Miriam had elected to come dressed as Frodo, though she had decided not to wear any fake feet. The last thing she wanted was to have small children standing on them all day.<br><br>William, who had refused to wear a costume on the grounds that being a Potterverse native was enough (and had then been bullied by Cara into at least ironing his normally creased robes), just laughed. &quot;If it means not having to watch you teeter around on ladders putting up the banners, it&#39;s worth it.&quot;<br><br>This was met by a sheepish smile. &quot;Yeah, I guess so. Safer, at least.&quot; Miriam fiddled with the One Ring replica she was wearing, and then looked around again. &quot;When is everyone arriving again?&quot;<br><br>Cara shrugged. &quot;I just said for people to turn up as and when they could make it. The important thing&#39;s having fun - isn&#39;t it, Steph?&quot; She paused, and then looked round. &quot;Steph?&quot;<br><br>The little girl, wearing a bright red robe with the Gryffindor crest, was sitting on one of the Auditorium seats nearby, her head in a book. It had been Miriam&#39;s idea, to keep her distracted enough she wouldn&#39;t be getting in the way of the decorating or trying to steal bits of the food.<br><br>&quot;Steph-anie,&quot; Cara half-sang, amused by the look of concentration on her daughter&#39;s face.<br><br>When this got no response, William took a more direct approach and headed over to pick the little girl up. &quot;Hey, mischief, your mum&#39;s talking to you.&quot;<br><br>Stephanie squirmed a bit, but quickly dropped her book in favour of cuddles from her uncle as he carried her back to the others. &quot;What&#39;s it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I just wondered if you think we&#39;re ready, because people are going to start arriving soon.&quot; Cara gestured around at the Auditorium. &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br><br>There was a prolonged silence as both the question and the room were considered. &quot;Yep!&quot; Stephanie wriggled to get down, and William obliged with a chuckle. &quot;Can I have a sausage roll now?&quot;<br><br>Cara rolled her eyes. &quot;Just one until everyone else gets here.&quot;<br><br>As the little girl dashed off to get her treat, William murmured, &quot;It shouldn&#39;t be long, at least.&quot; He looked towards the door almost hopefully.</p>

            <p>Cara couldn&#39;t help but chuckle a bit at the impressions Jake and Boston were trying. &quot;You&#39;re not in the costume to be trying that,&quot; she pointed out to Jake, patting his shoulder. &quot;I&#39;ll leave you two to chat, anyway.&quot; With that she kissed Jake&#39;s cheek again and slipped away.<br><br>The door opened again, letting in a rather mixed group. The tallest was a solid, red-headed man in his thirties, who was practically being dragged by a boy of about five who could be none other than his son. On seeing the other children, Owen whooped, let go of his dad&#39;s hand and charged into the crowd, leaving Luke Celinus looking very relieved.<br><br>&quot;For a minute I thought he was going to drag me into the middle of it,&quot; he commented to the blonde woman beside him. Vicky Hayles, an Intelligence Agent and Owen&#39;s mother, smiled faintly.<br><br>&quot;Might do you some good,&quot; she replied before heading over to say hello to Cara and William and leave Stephanie&#39;s present on the designated chair, leaving Luke alone and very nervous-looking.<br><br>The last person to arrive was a petite, dark-haired woman just into her twenties. Freya Rowlands had taken full advantage of the come-in-costume suggestion, and was wearing a rather lovely Elven gown. Sidestepping small children, she made her way towards Terry, though she wasn&#39;t averse to chatting to anyone else on the way. DoSAT wasn&#39;t always the best place to socialise.<br><br>((OOC: Feel free to have anyone you like swarm, talk to or otherwise distract this bunch. :P ))</p>

            <p>At the least, he had the ranger-ish clothing, and he&#39;d got himself looking about as much the part as he could without breaking out a disguise generator. It wasn&#39;t perfect, of course, but a) it was still a decent attempt and b) this was a party for a five-year-old girl. Super details probably weren&#39;t needed, especially not enough to risk the hassle with the DIA. Outside of provably desperate in-mission circumstances, Upstairs really didn&#39;t like people disguising themselves as major canon characters.<br><br>All thoughts of avoiding impersonation charges fled his mind as he spotted Freya, though. Indeed, for a moment it looked like all thoughts <i>full-stop</i> had fled, as his jaw dropped slightly and his eyes glazed over. Then he endeavoured to free himself from the throng of children, gently removing one small boy from his shoulders, before striding over to meet Freya and pulling her into a firm embrace, grinning broadly. His body language was of someone who killed humanoid abominations that warped reality on a whim every day, and thus didn&#39;t care who saw him hug his girlfriend.<br><br>&quot;I was wondering when you&#39;d show up,&quot; he said, letting his eyes roam over the gown appreciatively. &quot;Looking to surprise us, huh?&quot;<br><br>Miri was at the snack table during all this, looking amused at the various partygoers&#39; antics but also slightly unsure whether to join in, and where. She seemed to have instinctively slipped into the background, ready to slip back out if needed.</p>

            <p>(( As good a time to come in as any. {= ) ))<br><br>The latest arrivals had opted for a Potterverse look: green-eyed Jenni Robinson had on a Hogwarts robe with the particular comfortable look of having been used regularly in the past, and the two-year-old in her arms wore miniature versions of the trousers, shirt, and jumper from the movies. The jumper was edged in green and silver, but the little tie was red and gold. Henry liked red and green.<br><br>&quot;Remember when we were here for your birthday?&quot; Jenni was saying as they entered. She had made one concession to the movieverse with a blue and bronze tie visible at her neck, but the robe was plain bookverse black. &quot;We had your friends here, and presents, and cake, and—&quot;<br><br>&quot;Cake?&quot; Henry said, taking his thumb out of his mouth and looking up with interest. In his other arm, he clutched his favorite brown fire-lizard toy.<br><br>Jenni laughed. &quot;Yes, someone has his priorities straight. But not yet. Look, there&#39;s your friend Artie! Let&#39;s go say hi.&quot;<br><br>Cara looked busy, and the birthday girl herself was occupied with a piggyback ride, so Jenni figured greetings beyond simple nodding and waving could wait while she got her kid settled in. Artemis&#39;s antics might have been the source of a few raised eyebrows, but Henry was a young wizard, after all, and wizard children tended to show an uncanny resilience to unwelcome changes to their personal space. Jenni didn&#39;t worry for him.</p>

            <p>Nataan felt himself beginning to be a little overwhelmed by the exponential growth the party seemed to be experiencing. He saw a few people he knew here and there in the irregular, constantly shifting groups; once he caught a glimpse of Imira in the midst of a mob of other children gleefully swarming the adults, getting rides on their shoulders and participation in whatever games sprang into their minds. Zevak had somehow got swept up in the tide, and was currently in hot pursuit of his hat, which had been snatched off his head and absconded with. <br><br>Spotting William, he wove his way carefully across and called a greeting, hoping he&#39;d be able to get the wizard&#39;s attention without screaming, or jumping up and down and waving his arms.

Not that your two seem to mind.&quot;<br><br>Meanwhile, over at the playpen a rather tall, thin young woman had just settled her twin toddlers in.

            <p>Nat gave Henry a little smile. &quot;They&#39;re still our kids, an&#39; we love &#39;em.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Damn right,&quot; another similarly lanky Agent added, sneaking up behind her and wrapping hs arms round her waist. He smiled a bit sheepishly at Jenni. &quot;Uh, hi.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This&#39;s Zach,&quot; Nat said, leaning against him with a blissful smile that proclaimed their relationship louder than words. &quot;&#39;E&#39;s in Floaters.&quot;<br><br>Down in the playpen, Emily let out a decidedly vocal protest as her new toy was taken away, and she toddled after Henry in a bid to reclaim the plushie.

            <p>Jenni grinned at Zach, but didn&#39;t offer a hand, unwilling to disrupt the couple. No doubt their time for personal relationships was as limited as her own. &quot;You&#39;re a lucky soul.&quot; She glanced down at Emily&#39;s shrill complaint, but since no one was actually crying she let it go for the moment and returned her attention to the adults. &quot;Both of you are. Not too many of us hold onto a &#39;traditional&#39; family <i>and</i> stay in the job, at least as far as I&#39;m aware,&quot; she observed. &quot;And in different departments, too. What&#39;s your secret?&quot;<br><br>In the pen, Henry smiled and waved at Anthony, but he&#39;d set his sights on a set of rainbow-colored nesting cups that could probably be taken apart and put back together, or stacked up, or any number of other things. He plunked himself down and started in on them, overturning the set and shaking out the inside cups. Gotta love that clatter! This of course required both hands, so the fire-lizard rested beside him.</p>

            <p>The door to the Really Very Tiny Auditorium opened, and the first guests arrived.<br><br>Kieran had not really bothered to put on a costume for LOTR or Potterverse, either on himself or on Artemis, reasoning that his Redwall attire was close enough to the former just as Artie&#39;s World One clothes were to the latter.

            <p>The door to the Really Very Tiny Auditorium swung open again. A young Asian woman wearing a rumpled Slytherin uniform and a snaggle-toothed grin poked her head around the edge of the door.<br><br>&quot;Sweet, we got here before all the nibbles got snatched up!&quot; she said. &quot;They&#39;ve got mini-hot dogs and everything!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am not very comfortable with this, Gremlin,&quot; came a muffled reply from the corridor behind her. &quot;Aiden is far too young for such an event. He may become distressed.&quot;<br><br>Gremlin rolled her eyes as she pushed the door open all the way. &quot;Honestly, you&#39;re a bigger baby than he is sometimes. He&#39;ll be fine. This is a good thing, Xerry! You&#39;re spending more time with Aiden and you&#39;ll be meeting with other parents! It&#39;s win-win, sweetheartless!&quot;<br><br>After a few moments of hesitation, Xericka stepped into the auditorium. She had not changed out of her typical Organization coat, although she had wrapped a yellow and black Hufflepuff scarf around her neck as a nod to one-half of the themes. Aiden, dressed in a similarly-colored onesie, gurgled in her arms.<br><br>&quot;Please try to enjoy yourself,&quot; Gremlin said. She put her hand on Xericka&#39;s shoulder and gave it a quick squeeze.<br><br>Xericka sighed. &quot;I shall endeavor to do my best.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good!&quot; Gremlin turned back to the rest of the room and waved in greetings. &quot;Hey, everyone!&quot;</p>

Oh - and I did set up a playpen for any really little ones, if you were worried,&quot; she added to Xericka.<br><br>As Stephanie made a beeline for Kieran and Artie, William followed hurriedly to ensure there weren&#39;t any collisions. &quot;Careful there,&quot; the wizard cautioned as Stephanie nearly skidded to a halt in front of the fox.<br><br>&quot;Hey Kieran, guess what? It&#39;s my birthday!&quot; She held her arms out for a hug; to Stephanie, hugs were the best way to greet her friends, but she&#39;d at least learned by now not to do it without making sure the other person wouldn&#39;t object.<br><br>William hovered nearby just to keep an eye on things, smiling faintly.</p>

Zach Marshall grinned suddenly, seriousness dissolving as he looked at William.<br><br>Tad Marshall stood nearby, and Michelle &quot;Mishi&quot; Sellers, who waved impishly at William. The young blonde witch had been as happy as the boys to be suddenly adopted by William in the course of his taking them under his wing, but had kept her own choice of surname on the grounds that she&#39;d only just escaped the alliterative name she&#39;d had in her native fic, and wasn&#39;t going to be Mishi Marshall now.<br><br>All three wore their old Hogwarts robes (Gryffindor for Tad and Mishi, and Ravenclaw for Zach) as a concession to the occasion.</p>

All had come attired for the occasion, and it was only at second glance that one would notice a few peculiarities.

            <p>&quot;Looks like I&#39;d better go and be a good hostess,&quot; she said to Gremin and Xericka. &quot;In any case, there&#39;s games, toys, snacks, the music - I made sure it&#39;s all decent for the kids - so just enjoy yourselves.&quot; She tickled Aiden under the chin with a soft smile and headed towards the Nataan family.<br><br>&quot;Hi there,&quot; she offered once she was close enough, sidestepping the small Bajoran girl charging past her. &quot;Good to see you again.

            <p>Before the door could open fully, a string of three children, two girls and a boy, tumbled into the room. The eldest, dressed as a very small, slightly darker version of Faramir, picked herself up, dusted herself off, and pulled the other two to their feet. &quot;Come on!&quot; she said, nearly picking up the youngest (who, aside from the thumb permanently wedged into his mouth, was dressed as a near-perfect replica of the Movieverse Legolas), and pulling her siblings toward the knot of children already in the room. &quot;Fara, wait up!&quot; cried Kinsey, the younger girl, picking up her elven skirt and running after her big sister and little brother. <br><br>A moment later, two adults and a teenager sidled in, obviously unsure whether they were going to be bowled down upon entry. <br><br>The teenager was the first to relax, running a hand over her expertly coiffed, platinum blonde hair, and straightening the collar on her suit jacket. &quot;Well, this looks like it&#39;s going to be fun,&quot; Piper said, grinning back at the two adults before going to scout out the snack table, and go mingle with the other teenagers in the room. <br><br>Azrael carefully snicked the door closed behind her, and took her sleeping infant back from her partner, propping the baby on her shoulder with one arm, and making sure that her sword -- regulation on her Haradrim &#39;costume&#39; -- was securely fastened into the scabbard. It wouldn&#39;t do to have some child or other getting ahold of it... <br><br>&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go be social.&quot; <br><br>&quot;You&#39;re sure this costume is appropriate?&quot; asked Boston, fiddling with the high collar of his long black robes. &quot;It still feels a little presumptuous.&quot; </p>

            <p>Artemis made a beeline for the plate full of sliced apples, much to Kieran&#39;s amusement. The young fox had noticed the sausage rolls and delighted in satisfying his inner carnivore. A recent visit to the OFUR had left him with a longing for something non-vegetarian. He watched Artemis carefully as the half-demon hovered by the fruit plate, and so he noticed when Artemis&#39;s eyes took on a devious gleam. A bowl of sweet and sour sauce sat by a platter of potstickers, not too far from the pitcher of fruit punch. They were remarkably the same color...<br><br>&quot;Artie, don&#39;t,&quot; Kieran admonished him. &quot;Come on. It&#39;s Stephanie&#39;s birthday.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Stink eye&quot; is generally a common phenomenon among young children. Considering Artie&#39;s parentage, Kieran shouldn&#39;t have been surprised that his almost-brother had such a natural death glare.</p>

            <p>After nodding to Cara as she left to greet the latest arrivals, Xericka made her way over to the area set aside for the youngest party attendees. She examined the small arrangement of toys with a careful eye as Aiden contentedly gummed the edge of her scarf.<br><br>&quot;Perhaps the stuffed pastel blue ursine would be suitable,&quot; she muttered.

            <p>Among the newest wave of arrivals, which included Kyran the Hammer and Terry Collins from the DMS Mossflower Division, was a large, white haired man, being half-dragged into the Auditorium by Jacob Sullivan of the DIA. He hadn&#39;t dressed up (&quot;I&#39;m <i>not</i> making an idiot of myself by dressing in some silly costume!&quot;), but at least he&#39;d decided to come along, and that&#39;s what mattered to Jacob. If you asked him, his older brother didn&#39;t spend nearly enough time out of the RC these days.<br><br>&quot;To see you swamped by little kids?&quot; Jacob offered a cheerful little grin as he stepped round one of the children who&#39;d arrived by now. &quot;Five&#39;s sake, you&#39;ve been way too grumpy lately, Roger. It&#39;s not good for anybody, and I miss my big brother actually smiling now and then.&quot;<br><br>Roger rolled his eyes, but at least he looked a little amused. That was a start. The older Sullivan had joined the PPC three years before Jacob, and with everything the two of them had been through since he probably had the right to occasional grumpiness, but he couldn&#39;t help being concerned now and then. Roger soon went off to mingle, though, leaving Jacob to smooth down his uniform - he&#39;d come right off shift  without time to change, so he planned on saying he&#39;d dressed up as a Muggle or wizard in disguise - and look round, heading over to Cara with a broad grin when he spotted her by the playpen.<br><br>&quot;Cara, hey!&quot; He weaved round kids and adults alike, waving to the Assassin once he had her attention. &quot;Looks like you&#39;ve got things to a good start; sorry I couldn&#39;t be here earlier, TL had me on guard duty up at the Lichen&#39;s office.

            <p>Az nodded to Jacob, held out her infant by way of explanation, and headed in the direction of the playpen, pulling the hood on Helena’s <a href="http://www.trendyhalloween.com/Assets/ProductImages/LilElephantInfantCostume.jpg">Adorable Elephant Onesie</a> and tying it securely before putting her into the playpen. Helena proceeded to crawl away, and try to chew on the tail of the cat who had appeared in the playpen. “Sue babies,” remarked Az, shaking her head, and flashing a rueful grin at the young man standing near her. She had only been surprised for a moment when the Nursery had messaged her to tell her that the premature SueSpawn she had brought in had crawled out of the incubator and begun trying to get at the other babies. <br><br>Boston, meanwhile, bowed, and extended a hand to Jake. “How very… Nice… to meet you,” he said, in a not-too-bad imitation of Alan Rickman’s portrayal of Severus Snape.

            <p>I like your mission. I&#39;m not up on Pern, but I know enough to recognize badfic when I see it! I like the idea of the Canon Bomb too--you should do a Wiki page on it when the wiki stops being stupid. Of course, it&#39;s experimental technology, so there&#39;s no telling how it&#39;ll go oh-so-hilariously wrong... Link it to the DoGA page; I think they&#39;d be the ones to use it, mostly.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s good to have another Pern mission done. <sup>_^</sup> Your writing is good, but I&#39;d like to see more of it in the actual mission. The beginning and end bits are engaging, with fun agent interaction and silly things happening, but the mission body seems basically like chunks of a charge list stuck between chunks of story. There&#39;s a lot of humor potential lost there.<br><br>I have a few specific quibbles I want to point out:<br><br>1. &quot;&#39;And [charge] for misspelling ‘filling’&#39;, Grace concluded.&quot; —Actually, I think he misspelled &quot;flying.&quot; The phrase in the fic is &quot;bronzes, browns, blues and greens <b>fling in</b> the sky.&quot;<br><br>2. &quot;It should be ‘H’tl’.&quot; —It was before, but in my review I advised the author that that is unpronounceable, and he changed it.<br><br>3. Not a exactly writing critique, but I disagree that the Brekke/F&#39;nor story has &quot;Rape Is Love&quot; in it, and it gave me such a start that I had to go re-read that first encounter between them. When I read the scene in question, I see Brekke worried that they&#39;ll wake up Wirenth and trigger her mating flight, not specifically telling F&#39;nor she doesn&#39;t want him. She definitely doesn&#39;t seem to think she was raped afterward, even with her Crafter morals.<br><br>4. I thought the same thing about the number of fire-lizard eggs being inconsistent at first, but then I looked over the hatching scene again, and there are just four: only Stannor, Mack, Zoey, and Emily Impress (blue, green, green, and brown, respectively). Despite the mention of Lisa/Lesa, she is not actually present and does not get a fire-lizard. (The fact that the event occurs at all remains as ridiculous as ever, though.)<br><br>5. I&#39;m positive they have hammocks on Pern, especially in the Southern Continent. Why wouldn&#39;t they? They&#39;re just made of rope with some wood and metal bits. They do have sheep (ovines), too.<br><br>The good things, as I said, were all contained in the portions that took place in the RC. I like Grace poking around with machines that do silly things, and the agents have some good dialogue between them. Try to carry that into the missions, and have some fun with re-writing the fic as the agents actually perceive it rather than just quoting the whole thing and pointing out charges. We get the charge list at the end, so we don&#39;t need the whole thing in the mission body anyway. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

I should have read that sentence a bit more closely.<br><br>2. Ah, I see.<br><br>3. You might be right, but the fact that Brekke panics and fights him really doesn&#39;t scream &#39;this is consensual&#39; at me.<br><br>4. ...oops. *resolves to read more closely next time*<br><br>5.

            <p>The big chunks of badfic are something that may be replaceable by descriptions of the effects of the badfic on the continuum. So, there are bad-grammar effects that the sentence structure and spelling can have (like your &quot;boy hair&quot;, which made me chuckle and wish I knew how to draw), that you can use without having to put lots of the badfic in as examples.</p>

            <p>Loved the random stuff that Grace builds, and the prototypoe Canon Bomb.

            <p>That&#39;s why I decided (or rather, my agents did) to steal a couple of F-22s from an Ace Combat badfic. Sometimes you just have to blow the entire place up, and DOGA is not always there.<br><br>And if the place is a big moving object (just like the mission I was co-writing with Lo&#39;Homme Arbre, before his disappearance. There was a modern cruise ship in Redwall. &#39;Nuff said.) nothing is better than fighter jets. Still have to use them sparingly, though - that&#39;s a lot of firepower for PPC Agents. Luckily, maintenance justifies that.<br><br>Since I am writing an interlude right now, what about my Agents (Sergio Turbo and Corolla, of the Department of Floaters, though I think they&#39;ll get transferred to the Special Operation Division now that they have special equipment) meeting yours and &quot;hiring&quot; Grace as their mechanic? After all, Sergio already said that he doesn&#39;t want DoSAT working on his plane, but they still need somebody who fixes them. The alternative would be pulling out an OFU for Ace Combat and bringing them there, but creating an OFU and not writing for it sounds wrong.</p>

            <p>I hereby propose a writing game. It&#39;s something we used to do in my creative writing class, using photography magazines. Basically, File The Plothole, Photo Edition. It goes like this: One person posts several interesting photos, or links to them, numbered 1 through however many. Either give a brief, fitting description, or not. <br><br>And then we write short stories about the how and why of these photos, and post some photos of our own. <br><br>For this game, photos like this: <br>1: <a></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manikol/6104144693/"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manikol/6104144693/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/manikol/6104144693/</a></a><br>2: <a></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canon-eos/6096090759/"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/canon-eos/6096090759/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/canon-eos/6096090759/</a></a><br>3: <a></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/williams253/6098501356/"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/williams253/6098501356/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/williams253/6098501356/</a></a><br>4: <a></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wildzone51/6106802095/"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wildzone51/6106802095/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/wildzone51/6106802095/</a></a><br><br>are better than photos like this: <br>5: <a></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/22881422@N02/6095233939/"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/22881422@N02/6095233939/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/22881422@N02/6095233939/</a></a><br>6: <a></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_coffee/6093480855/"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_coffee/6093480855/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_coffee/6093480855/</a></a><br>7: <a></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dmitry_savin/6107368348/"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dmitry_savin/6107368348/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/dmitry_savin/6107368348/</a></a><br><br>because there&#39;s more to speculate on and make up. <br><br>They can be photos you found, photos you took, photos you went on flickr and accudentally ran into, whathaveyou. The only rule for photos is that they should be interesting. <br><br>You can write about your favourite canon, your own little world, your neighbour, whatever. Post your writing here, or somewhere else and link it here, with a link to the photo you wrote about, and a few photos of your own, if you feel like it. <br><br>PS: If it&#39;s still there, I&#39;ll post a photo later of the thing I found in town yesterday that made me remember this game. </p>

            <p>And gets my creativity going a bit more than the others, but yes, it would be more of a serious story than a silly story, which the first four pics definitely have a mood for. Even so, here&#39;s a little story inspired by that pic:<br><br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_coffee/6093480855/"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_coffee/6093480855/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_coffee/6093480855/</a></a><br><br>The Stairwell<br><br>Ten... eleven... twelve...<br><br>Rufus&#39; gaze lifted from the step before him, falling over rows textured gray bricks, worn two by fours and tattered metal railing, his vision finally obscured by the brilliant light that flooded the top floors of the building. <br><br>Twelve is good. Today felt like a &#39;twelve&#39; day. He reverently retreated back down the stairway, his footfalls cautious so as to not cause the wood to groan. It had taken a week of passing by that abandoned stairwell before he built up the courage to take the first step. At this point, a month later, it wasn&#39;t fear or anxiety that kept him from sprinting up the rest of the way. It wasn&#39;t about finding out what was at the top of the stairs, it was about pushing himself forward.<br><br>Some days he&#39;d go a bit farther than other days - when he got a bicycle for his birthday he made it up the first flight. When Colette waved at him he made it up two. When news that his father wasn&#39;t coming back from overseas arrived, he stood on the very first step for hours.<br><br>He idly wondered if he&#39;d ever see that top of that abandoned stairwell; not out of curiosity for what existed at the top, but for what life had in store for him to propel him that high. </p>

            <p>First, are agents allowed to have noncanon weapons in canon &#39;verses? I was thinking of having a historically correct repeating crossbow in the LOTR continuum. If I do use it, I will promise to have seven out of the ten bolts fired in one magazine miss. I will emphasize on all its weaknesses. Two out of the three will only nick the Sue, not doing much damage. So, can I have slightly noncanon weapons inside a canon universe, as long as I don&#39;t leave any noncanon things behind? </p>

            <p>Why would you want to use a weapon to kill a Sue that only has that effect in one out of every ten shots?<br><br>I know Acacia used curare to kill Sues on occasion, but I&#39;m not familiar enough with LotR canon to be able to tell you whether that plant was canon to LotR. (I doubt it actually.) So, using a noncanon weapon might have been established as possible by TOS.<br><br>The important thing, though, is: would that weapon work in the fandom. For instance, in Harry Potter canon it has been explicitly said that electrical appliances can&#39;t be used at Hogwarts. Trying to kill a Sue at Hogwarts by throwing a toaster in her tub is not going to work, because canon says so. <br><br>When I first started writing missions in A-Team fandom I picked a handgun that would have been available in the time period the canon is set, but was not actually ever mentioned in canon. It&#39;s thus a noncanon weapon, but as a handgun, it could work in that canon.<br><br>As for making the death of a Sue an ironic echo, that&#39;s for agents with too much time on their hand. There&#39;s no rule that says you have to. If you want to kill the Sue quickly (with a neath shot through the head or simply breaking her neck) or slowly with time to run for cover (one in ten shots hitting the target?!) go for it.<br><br>By the way, you do not need permission to write missions to ask questions. Even if those questions are about things you would like to do in a mission. </p>

            <p>But since canon reports that some characters have been killed, off-camera. It is possible to kill a character in A-Team fandom, as long as the canon characters don&#39;t see you do it. Which is the way of the PPC anyway.<br><br>It is, however, impossible to kill someone by throwing them down a high building. Death by crashing is way out too.</p>

            <p>First, have you permission yet?<br><br>On to the actual answer now...<br><br>I actually once brought a pulse rifle from a sci-fi continuum (Mass Effect) to kill two Stus (out of a trio of Stus and a Sue) in a Dark Fantasy continuum (Dragon Age), so it&#39;s possible to bring in a wildly noncanon weapon into a &#39;verse and get away with it. But I think it depends on what you&#39;re trying to do with the Stu in question. I killed the two Stus with the pulse rifle to give them a death not related to their canon of origin (Kingdom Hearts), mostly because it&#39;s an ironic echo of the fact that they both killed darkspawn in ways that would be more fitting in the Mortal Kombat continuum than they would even for the Dragon Age continuum.<br><br>Usually, we try to make the deaths some kind of riff/ironic echo played on the Sue/Stu the agents are killing. So keep that in mind when you do stuff.</p>

<li>While I don&#39;t know the canon that well, it sounds to me like you&#39;re dealing with geographical aberrations - geography that doesn&#39;t exist in canon. If you were to ask for the advice of the Department of Geographical Aberrations, they would generally say to burn or explode the Weyrs. (There is a reason they&#39;re also known as the Pyros. :P) They are very large, Weyrs, aren&#39;t they? Like mountains?<br><br>If you&#39;d rather take a more peaceful approach, the Weyrs should disappear once the world-warping Sue/Stu is out of the picture. Though if the Weyrs are defined enough by the words, instead of being just vague &quot;these are Weyrs, now let&#39;s get to the action!&quot;, they may not melt away so easily and you might have to resort to the first approach mentioned above. It&#39;s up to you how hard these things are to eliminate and how you go about it, but the two main choices are what I mentioned.<br><br>2. Again, this one is your choice. Either nothing can happen, or you can get a mini-OC, or you can get what looks like a mini of the canon except it&#39;s pink and sparkly. Or you can invent your own description.<br><br><br>Really, writing for the PPC is about choice; there&#39;s no &quot;correct&quot; way to deal with things, just approaches that have been tried before, found effective and used again. People are always coming up with new ideas. Given the Agents have such a heavy workload and equipment that&#39;s very prone to malfunctioning, things are often made up on the fly out of necessity.</li>

            <p>Hello, the newb resident pain-in-the-rear again! (Joking, joking)<br><br>I&#39;ve been mulling a bit regarding assignments and I had a couple of questions regarding Agents:<br><br>1) Is it possible for one agent to recieve the temporary oversight from another agent in a mission as part of their induction? After which, that agent returns to whatever he/she was up to before?<br><br>2) I&#39;ve read a bit about bit characters - is it possible to recruit a bot character as an agent, on the provision that they are submitted to FieldPsych for the necessary &quot;adjustments&quot;?</p>

            <p>1) You mean like as a sort of &#39;observing the newbie in the field to make sure they don&#39;t freak out&#39; or something like that? I don&#39;t see any problem with it, so long as you work it out with whomever it was that created the observing agent (unless it&#39;s an NPC like Lux or something.)<br><br>2) &#39;Bot character&#39; ...I&#39;m guessing you misspelled &#39;bit&#39; there. But yes, bit characters can be recruited as agents. Technically, one of my agents was a bit character herself. If you actually did mean &#39;bot characters&#39; as in &#39;characters who are robots,&#39; then that isn&#39;t a problem either. We have several AI agents already. Oh, and it&#39;s FicPsych, not FieldPsych.<br><br>Hope this helps!</p>

Watership Down is one of my all-time favorite books, and one of the most appealing aspects of it is the very obvious non-human nature of the protagonists. Rather than being anthropomorphized animals, they&#39;re quite simply animals. Sure, some liberty is taken with giving them a language and more culture than they have in reality, but they are definitely not humans, and that is the charm of the book--it lets you read about people who are very different from anything you are likely to encounter, without confusing you with their alien nature. To read a story where someone turned them into furry humans would justifiably enrage anyone!<br><br>Good first kill, interesting agents, etc., etc.</p>

            <p>I felt it took a bit to get really into it, but once you got into the jist of things it was hilarious. Grace and Ally play off each other very well, and with them I especially liked how Ally would get so clueless at some of Grace&#39;s pop culture references.<br><br>So the mission itself is good. =D<br><br>Now, for posting the mission, it&#39;s customary to put a list of the minis and the loot you&#39;ve collected when you post the mission on the board. Nothing wrong with making a new post to cover that now, but just keep it in mind for future reference.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been looking for good Mary Sue badfic in the <i>Sherlock</i> fandom, because it&#39;s a fandom I love and I&#39;d like to eventually do missions in it. I found one that might just fit the bill, because it stars John Watson&#39;s niece, Miku Miyazaki Watson. Perfect... except it&#39;s in French, so I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in it, or if it&#39;s even actually a badfic.</p>

            <p>Well, I read the fic, and while there are serious indicators that this is a Suefic (first chapter is essentially a description of Miku and her backstory, she&#39;s a relative of a canon character, she &quot;looks like a rebel&quot; but is actually &quot;sweet, nice, sometimes shy&quot;), she&#39;s barely in the second chapter, so we don&#39;t know how the canon characters react to her. It&#39;s probaby a Suefic, but too early to spork.</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t really help with the French, my knowledge of it is patchy at best, but... the name Miku Miyazaki is eerily similar to that of a character from a webcomic called the Order of the Stick - Miko Miyazaki. If you find someone who can help translate, letus know more? I know it&#39;s shaky evidence, but that just screams crossover.</p>

            <p>Maybe it&#39;s because a friend of mine is a Vocaloid fan, but I think the author was &quot;inspired&quot; by Miku Hatsune.  Then, Miyazaki is probably the most famous Japanese director, so this feels like a random Instant Cool Copypaste Japanese Name (because the Gratuitous Japanese trope just wasn&#39;t enough)<br><br>So now we have TWO surnames, and I don&#39;t think it fits even if she&#39;s half japanese. I do not know English use, but I think it&#39;s similar to American, and so she shouldn&#39;t have two surnames if she&#39;s not married yet (Which I don&#39;t think, since then it would be Miku Watson Husbandsurname), and in Japanese there is always only one surname.<br><br>Sorry, but I can&#39;t help with French language - did study it, but I don&#39;t remember it a lot.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been around on the PPC chatroom for about a month now, but I would like to get into the proper introductions...<br><br>I like playing video games and tabletop role-playing games including Dungeons &amp; Dragons, writing stuff, including fanfiction (I&#39;m a bit new at this kind of stuff), reading, and being on the computer, doing stuff. My fandoms are mainly Mass Effect, Fallout, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, including the setting Eberron, Dragon Age, Doctor Who, etc. I hope I would have the opportunity to enjoy my time here at the PPC with you guys.</p>
