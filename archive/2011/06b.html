            <p>This has been bothering me for a while, and I&#39;ve finally found time to post.<br>So; Does anyone know how time works in the PPC compared to the real world?<br>Like...If an agent comes from the real world and goes to HQ, does the amount of time passed in HQ match the real world, or does it go at different paces? Is there time at all at the PPC?<br>Also, if/when the agent decided to retire back to the real world, would any time have passed?</p>

            <p>It&#39;s like how navigating HQ works on a literalism: &quot;It&#39;s kind of a maze, unless you hadn&#39;t noticed.&quot; If you really pay attention to the time—especially if you want it to go faster—it will probably slow down just to spite you. Otherwise, it can go really quickly or really slowly or really normally, depending on factors such as the dimensional location of the bit of HQ you&#39;re in, how much fun you&#39;re having (time flies when you&#39;re having fun, you know), and the like. Thus, for some agents it&#39;s almost exactly like Real World time, and for some it works like time in Narnia, and for some it changes daily.<br><br>The time spent in missions messes with things, too. You can spend a week&#39;s time in a fic but come back minutes after you left your RC thanks to portals. Similarly, how time passes in HQ is irrelevant to when you decide to pop back to the Real World. Though if you&#39;ve aged five years, it&#39;s probably unwise to return the moment after you left.<br><br>Really, it all comes down to how you want to write your spin-off. Some folks like to write their missions as though they happen back-to-back, and some write them as though they&#39;re spaced out, assuming that the time between is filled with more routine missions and other stuff. In my case, Agent Derik&#39;s missions occur more or less back to back, and that&#39;s because he&#39;s distracted a lot. Lots of time passes between them for others, but not for him because he doesn&#39;t notice it; his aging is less obvious for the same reason. Nume and Ilraen, on the other hand, have a perfect memory and a perfect biological clock between them, so time for them is pretty much normal because they can&#39;t help but have a passing awareness of it. I have to keep track of how old they are.<br><br>Make sense? ... More or less?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I forgot to add this. Basically, HST is a relative timeline—it marks when PPC events happen relative to World One time. It has little to do with how the agents perceive it. Again using Agent Derik as an example, it&#39;s been over three years since he was recruited relative to the Real World, but as far as he&#39;s concerned it&#39;s only been one year at most. HST is far more for our benefit than the agents&#39;.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... Agent Vemi spending a few years in the PPC while in World One, only a single summer holiday passed. So while HST is roughly equal to our time, people can jump around in it quite a bit.<br><br>The other thing HST does is partially synchronise different &#39;verses. If I have one agent from the year M41.241, and another from AC 379, which one is older? I&#39;d take their ages when they joined the PPC and project backwards to give them HST birthdates. Of course, this means that any other Roman Empire agents will have different synchronisations of HST to AC (since the AC year they arrived will be their own baseline, rather than matching my agent&#39;s), but at least we know how old they are.<br><br>Or, in other words: HST exists for the sole purpose of letting us, as authors, keep it all straight in our heads.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Time passes, but not at the same pace as the Real World.  This is why we have HST, Headquarters Standard Time.  Whether this is faster or slower, I don&#39;t know.  I guess it&#39;s probably alternately either one.</p>

            <p>My main fandoms are the Stargate &#39;verse , Avatar: The Last Airbender,and Harry Potter. I can also write for most of the popular shonen manga, like Naruto and Bleach, although I haven&#39;t watched them for awhile. I also love Doctor Who and Lord of the Rings, but I don&#39;t feel that I know enough of their canon to write for them. </p>

            <p>Hello! I came across the PPC because of my epicly epic sister, who actually read part of the original series out loud to me. While browsing FF.net, I&#39;ve found a disturbing amount of badfics, most with Mary-sues, and I hate them with a passion. After hearing about this place, I figured it couldn&#39;t hurt to give it a shot. I have experence with many canons, including Harry Potter, Bionicle, and Avatar the Last Airbender. Thanks!</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t draw a person to save my life.  All I have are the avatar-creator images like the ones posted on the wiki.<br><br>So that&#39;s what a darning needle is.  I was so confused over it.  I actually though Suicide was supposed to be more of a pretty guy than that, since he&#39;s considered &quot;bishonen&quot;.  And can you PLEASE explain why he has gray hair?  I&#39;ve never understood that, either.  Dio was about how I imagined her.  The death certificate was... interesting.</p>

            <p>He started out much more good-looking, but since his appearance was Default Bishonen out of necessity rather than anything established by canon, he had a semi-unstable morphogenic field; it&#39;s since resettled itself somewhat in accordance with his personality. It also doesn&#39;t help that a guy like him doesn&#39;t stay pretty long--at the rate he finds trouble, he gets bashed up an awful lot, hence a scar, broken nose, cauliflower ear, etc. <br><br>(Also, I kinda fail at drawing, so he may not live up to his mission hype.)<br><br>Gray hair . . . well, he&#39;s old. Not ancient, but a lot older than your average PPCer; he claimed to be thirty-seven once, back in 2006, and even that was likely pushing it a bit. Right now he&#39;s likely in his forties somewhere.</p>

            <p>Not that my opinion is terribly weighty just yet, but I always approve of art threads, personally. Unfortunately for me, deviantArt is terribly non-cooperative (read: my network blocks it for inexplicable reasons), so I am sadly deprived. ;_;<br><br>But hey. Good idea.

Not much has changed. Her coat has many pockets and is made of &#39;Notice-Me-Not&#39; fabric from the Harry Potter continuum. She&#39;s pretty sure it&#39;s Sue fabric of some kind, but it works when the S.E.P. field stops working due to magical interference or something.<br><br><a href="http://galassiel.deviantart.com/gallery/?q=ppc#/dj2w4l"><a href="http://galassiel.deviantart.com/gallery/?q=ppc#/dj2w4l">http://galassiel.deviantart.com/gallery/?q=ppc#/dj2w4l</a></a> Agent Shinra&#39;s late husband circa 2006. He&#39;s a ninja accountant who throws exploding roses. And he put up with Shinra. I am seriously in love with his design. Love how he came out~! <br>I need to draw more. I do have more, of Shinra, at least, but they&#39;re pics from a Fanfic That Never Was full of many Noodle Incidents. XD<br><br></p>

            <p>Yep, I&#39;m big on gritty realistic fiction myself, too, and I would like to see what&#39;s coming out of this place that isn&#39;t directly related to the PPC. It&#39;s a nice break from the norm.</p>

            <p>One of my friends (also a contact) writes young adult realism, and she&#39;s currently working on a proper adult novel. <br><br>Besides, to be honest, some aspects of the process are the same. You will probably have a harder time trying to sell a non-genre fiction novel, especially in the current market (thanks to the paranormal explosion in romance and mystery, courtesy of *gah* <i>Twilight</i>) but it&#39;s not impossible. If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me, okay? My address is right up there. :)</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t see any email address.  I see what might be an IP address, but - wait, why would the Board be publishing our IP addresses?!<br><br>Actually, it looks like a lot of literary agents are going out of their minds with all the vampire and werewolf novels that are coming their way, and a lot of them are begging for something different.  I&#39;m guessing the next big thing will be non-vampire/werewolf urban fantasy, but non-genre *might* be coming back.  Of course, that means I have to hurry up and start the process, and I&#39;ve been dragging my feet a bit more than I should.  It&#39;s really scary to go out and DO it.</p>

            <p>Hello. I have been lurking on the Wiki for a while now, so I thought I probably should introduce myself. I am the Purple Cabbage (there is no such thing as a red cabbage; they are blatantly purple), safely anonymous. I got here from TV Tropes, and read on one of the FAQs that you need to hang around the Board for a month before obtaining Permission, so I might as well start early. And . . . I don&#39;t really have anything else interesting to say. </p>

            <p>Thank you! I may not be Albus Dumbledore, but socks are always useful. <br>Weapon improvisation is done by the addition of a half-brick, right? I think it was is Sourcery, but I haven&#39;t read that in a while. Also, I wonder if a sock could be used as a miniature teacosy? Perhaps to keep one mug warm rather than an entire pot?</p>

            <p>That is so cool.

            <p>Thanks for the chocolate! I like Discworld (of course), Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings (haven&#39;t read the Silm, though), Star Wars, the Old Kingdom series (I&#39;ve read some of Nix&#39;s other stuff, but it&#39;s mostly not as good), the Bartimaeus Trilogy, His Dark Materials, Narnia (I&#39;ve read all the books and seen the first movie) and quite a few other literary fandoms (and I really need to finish 1984). I also play Mario (which I&#39;m awful at), Legend of Zelda and Pokemon, and have just started to play Kingdom Hearts.<br><br>[/infodump]<br>Can anybody think of a synonym for &quot;although&quot;?</p>

            <p>Sigh this might be one of the best examples of why stus can hurt so much. Different to sues just enough so I&#39;m not as desensitised. On the plus side this lead to the mini-Gibbs dope slap which is possibly the greatest event to occur in a mission.</p>

            <p>Still not sure if I&#39;ll manage to find the time to actually write any missions, but I&#39;ve actually been specifically asked to go and apply for permission and I guess now felt about the right time. <br><br>Agent Bios:<br><br>Name: Gray<br>Age: 25<br>Species: ?Human?<br>Home Continuum: None<br>Department: Department of Technical Errors<br>Division: n/a<br>Partner: Kerrigan<br>Fandom(s): Full Metal Alchemist, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, any Miyazaki work, Paranoia Agent, Serial Experiments Lain, Fire Emblem, Legend of Zelda, Kingdom Hearts, Girl Genius, Homestruck, Lackadaisy, Scott Pilgrim, Watchmen, Malazan Book of the Fallen, Song of Ice and Fire, When They Cry, Elfen Lied<br>Lust-object(s): Rose, Arya (platonic lust?)<br>Favorite(s): Climbing, Spelunking, Exploration, the Outdoors, philosophy, Morality, Being Right, arguing<br>Weapon(s): None<br>Gray is a monochromatic entity who was created for a philosophical webcomic. He was created with the ability to infuse keys with the power to turn ordinary portals into plotholes to traverse universes. This ability allowed him to freely travel between canons, although he more often then not merely observed and stayed hidden, minimizing any affect he had in any fandom he visited. Over the course of his journeys he on many occasions spotted PPC agents righting errors within various canons, and found himself attracted to the job. <br>He was hesitant to approach them, unsure of his own status by PPC rules, but he jumped into action to aid a pair of agents who were being overwhelmed by canon characters acting to defend a Sue. After an extended conference with the Personnel Department, Gray was contracted into the PPC.<br>Gray is a Pacifist and will not use weapons. He does not attempt to press such preferences on others, although he will (with little expectation of success) attempt to temper his partner&#39;s love of violence. He&#39;s not above reactive violence and will defend himself (preferably with non-lethal force) if attacked. <br>Gray looks like an athletic human male with large-framed mirrored sunglasses and a chinstrap beard and mustache - except that he&#39;s entirely monochromatic. He can change his clothes, but anything he wears permanently turns white, black or a shade of gray. If he <i>can</i> remove his glasses, he&#39;s never done so to observers. <br><br>Name: Shani &quot;Kerrigan&quot; Hanif<br>Age: 19<br>Species: Human<br>Home Continuum: abandoned webcomic<br>Department: Department of Technical Errors<br>Division: n/a<br>Partner: Gray<br>Fandom(s): Starcraft, Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, Evangelion, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, Gunslinger Girl, Gurren Lagann, Serial Experiments Lain, Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt, Samurai Champloo, Trigun, Bioshock, Metroid, God of War, Pokemon, Total Annihilation, Advance Wars, <br>Lust-object(s): Batou, Jet, Kamina, Wolfwood, Kratos, Arm Commander, Hawke<br>Favorite(s): Robots, explosions, breaking things, echi, puzzles, Being Right, arguing, practical jokes<br>Weapon(s): Anything that shoots, stabs or bludgeons <br>Kerrigan is a character from a discontinued webcomic. She was written as a hyper-capable hacker, so when the canon started to decay she became aware of herself as a fictional character and put her skills to work to escape the doomed continuum. She succeeded and made a short-lived disruptive rampage through a host of continuums, fueled by her love of causing trouble. She was captured by PPC agents who found that she was no more insane or violent than most PPC agents, so they put her to work fixing canons instead of wrecking them. <br>Her &#39;real name&#39; back in her home continuum was Shani Hanif - a citizen of a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">Twenty Minutes into the Future</a> Egypt who took the name &#39;Kerrigan&#39; from her favorite fandom to use as her internet handle. She has very little if any training with any kind of weapon besides what she&#39;s used in VR games, but it doesn&#39;t stop her from collecting and using as wide an assortment of deadly implements as she can. <br>Kerrigan is about five feet tall with an average build, olive skin and shoulder length straight black hair. She also has a mischievous grin permanently affixed to her face. <br><br>I don&#39;t have a fic in mind to start off on, although I&#39;ll probably start looking into My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic to see if I can find anything sporkeable. In the meantime you can have my Advance Wars fanfic as my writing sample:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6035726/1/Enhanced_Vision"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6035726/1/Enhanced_Vision">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6035726/1/Enhanced_Vision</a></a></p>

            <p>This is just AWFUL! I had to comment again, simply because of the second chapter. It&#39;s like they&#39;re trying to shoehorn in each and every one of the 12 trolls! Once again though, we don&#39;t seem to have a sue yet. Unless there&#39;s a department that handles just plain terrible fics, we might not have a case yet. And by case, I mean a good enough reason to hang her from a tree and burn the letter PPC into their front lawn.</p>

            <p>...isn&#39;t even with the technical errors, it&#39;s with the fairly flagrant disregard for canon by making a coherent, sentient, speaking Lusus, and also with her just plain uncreative use of yet another eye power (one that is ridiculously trite and super speshul). <br><br>I think she also is missing an opportunity to try to flesh out a new story with her OC instead of just shoving her into the original 12. The destiny love story is especially contrived - they act like the 12 canon trolls and the 2 OC&#39;s are the only trolls that exist. <br><br>**reads more**<br><br>Sharky looks like an <i>actual</i> shark? He was more interesting back when he was just an aquatic troll that had shark-like features. A troll looking like an actual shark is just ridiculous. <br><br>All that said, the banter between Sharky and Zohra actually manages to be believable and amusing. It only starts to break down when they start shoe-horning the canon characters into the conversation. </p>

            <p>I saw the song title and was very happy. (Is it /that/ obvious that I&#39;m a Hetalia fan? ;]) You do sound a little squeaky, but that&#39;s perfectly fine. The song lyrics are quite good too. (And happy belated birthday!)</p>

            <p>Really? I&#39;d honestly love to make things more... informal. And easier, and less elitist-feeling, too.

            <p>Way back when dinosaurs roamed the Board, the very first Permission Givers <i>were</i> very informal.  If someone requested Permission, the PGs would do a quick check for serious systematic grammatical problems, maybe ask for a quick description of the proposed agents to be sure they weren&#39;t horrific &#39;Sues, and then they&#39;d usually give Permission.  I can only think of a few occasions where they turned someone down, and it was for enormous, glaring problems.  And people weren&#39;t required to clock a certain number of hours before they were permitted to perform the sacred rite of Requesting Permission.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t an audition, it wasn&#39;t an initiation, it wasn&#39;t a huge deal.  If you take a look at the <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/rules.html">guidelines</a> Jay and Acy set up, they&#39;re light, concise, and completely non-threatening.  Permission has now morphed far beyond that, in the hands of people who don&#39;t even own the universe.<br><br>But, I don&#39;t know that it does bother most new PPCers, since that&#39;s the dynamic they signed up for.  I think it&#39;s probably here to stay, and so I watch from the sidelines, and try to keep my grumbling to a minimum.</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t help but think that you&#39;re forgetting that the community has changed in scope and size.<br><br>The PPC now, in 2011, is far, far larger than it was in 2004, 2005, and so on. Even when I first joined up. <br><br>The PPC has become far more solid and evident; we&#39;re a larger group in more ways than just community size; we&#39;re not some tiny hole in the wall people can peek into while browsing in the Lord of the Rings fandom anymore. I know full well that most of the newer PPCers have nothing to do with that fandom; some of them don&#39;t even <i>like</i> the books (despite what the constitution says!) Goodness knows I can&#39;t remember the last mission that was written in LotR.<br><br>When a group gets larger, there are two choices to make; further structuralize and organize, or stay unregimented and risk the chance there are people who you don&#39;t know well enough- or at all- playing in the same playground as you who don&#39;t agree or respect that you and others are playing in it as well.<br><br>The charm of the PPC, when I first joined, was getting to know everyone and basically being able to go &#39;oh, hey, X is awesome, don&#39;t you think, Y?&#39; and there wouldn&#39;t be any groping and flailing on Y&#39;s part to remember who X is or why they&#39;re awesome. In this last week, we&#39;ve had five new people introduce themselves to the board, the last couple weeks have  been absolutely innundated with permissoin requests, and then various questions, and a couple mission plugs.<br><br>I can&#39;t see the community for all the different people! The wild and varied conversations we used to have about all sorts of random things or fandom items are for the most part a thing of the past, and I miss those sort of conversations. The amount of people joining or asking small things has made it all but impossible to have extended conversations where we can learn more about each other. <br><br>As I understand it, the &#39;hey hang around for a month before you ask for permission&#39; was an attempt for us to remain a community and stay a community, so we would know each other. But it&#39;s become increasingly hard to do that- even with regulation and the authority I know you don&#39;t want here- when the community outgrows itself. <br><br>To try and put it into a matter of simply &#39;back when I first joined&#39; ignores all the factors that have changed, and that this isn&#39;t the same community as it used to be when I joined, which wasn&#39;t the same as the community that Vixenmage joined, and the community that she joined wasn&#39;t the same you joined.</p>

            <p>As many of you know, I am actively involved in the Theatre.  I am a member of a company that is just over 5 years old.  In the beginning the entire operation was run by the couple that founded the company.  As time went on they got other people involved and the company grew.  It grew very fast.  But it only grew fast in one dimension.<br><br>As far as the art went, the company was doing very well.  However, if you looked at the finances and the company structure then we were falling far behind.  Our artistic endeavors were out-pacing our ability to pay for it or organize ourselves to do it effectively.  Things had to change.<br><br>So, we started to build the company structure up to a level where we could be useful.  We added a Company Manager (me, in fact) whose job it is to keep track of everyone and make sure we are all working to make the company work.  If people are not doing anything then it is my job to either get them to do it or come up with a punishment (either loss of privileges or asking them to leave the company).  In this way, I make sure that everyone is working at a level that works for them and that we don&#39;t have dead weight.  And that is allowing the company to grow further.<br><br>Now we have a problem.  People who have been in the company from the beginning are starting to not like the changes that have happened.  They long for the days when each person was allowed to work as much or as little as they pleased and trusted to contribute to the company.  Some of these people have not been to a monthly meeting in the year and a half that I have been in the company.  I still haven&#39;t met a few people.  But they want things to go back to the way they were.<br><br>Problem: the way things were, we would have had to dissolve the company in the next six months or so due to lack of accountability and finances (which also suffered somewhat from the lack of accountability).  The company was collapsing under its own weight.<br><br>All of this is just a long way of saying that as an entity grows, it needs more structure so that it can continue to grow and not implode.</p>

            <p>I just cannot see the intersection between a financial entity, where people&#39;s real-life assets are at stake, and an internet community based on somebody else&#39;s writing.  I simply cannot.  The PPC is not that serious; it&#39;s a fandom.  I know we like to say that quality in fanfic is enormously, unutterably important.  But there was a time that we understood it actually isn&#39;t.  It&#39;s just words on the internet.  If somebody writes a slightly subpar PPC story, it <i>doesn&#39;t actually hurt anyone</i>.<br><br>Jay and Acy made a few rules, and it&#39;s good to keep those rules out of respect for them.  But we&#39;ve gone way beyond enforcing their requests, as the parents of the fandom, to enforcing our own concept of who the PPC should admit to its holy ranks.<br><br>And, while I don&#39;t think it was the original cause, I think the new style of PGing does directly contribute to keeping the Board as basically a log of newbies and Permission requests.  The Board has become a vehicle for Permission, for approaching the shadowy cabal behind the PPC, and the community doesn&#39;t really exist anymore.<br><br>And I think the community <i>is</i> important.  If not for the PPC community, I would live in a different country, wouldn&#39;t be married, and my son wouldn&#39;t exist.  Communities can change people&#39;s lives, and it&#39;s a shame the PPC has decided to come down on the side of purifying the ranks of internet writers for the sake of High Art, rather than the side of promoting a community.<br><br>But as I said, I believe most PPCers nowadays are happy with the state of affairs, so I&#39;m honestly not trying to affect change.  I&#39;m just a crotchety old woman waving her cane and grumbling about kids these days.</p>

            <p>Thanks for that, I was worried. {= ) *hugs*<br><br>As far as carrying on with what works, the horse seems to have left the barn, so I think I&#39;ll carry on trying to improve.

            <p>Obviously there are differences between a theatre company and an online community.  However, I think my point still stands.  Both entities require structure in order to grow in any useful way.<br><br>Also, as far as the Board being a log or newbies and Permission requests, how do you mean that PGing style directly contributes to it?  The PGs aren&#39;t causing people to join the Board in large numbers, nor are they causing Permission requests to be posted.  That is all on the people posting and I don&#39;t think there is any way to stop that.  The Permission Givers are doing the best they can in the situation.<br><br>The community.  Yeah, it doesn&#39;t really exist on the Board anymore.  I completely agree.  However, there is a link at the top of the Board to the IRC channel.  I don&#39;t know if you have been in there or not, but it is now filling the community role that the Board used to.  I would check it out, if you haven&#39;t already.<br><br>One last point: Where is everyone getting this language from?  &quot;Holy ranks&quot;  &quot;purifying the ranks of internet writers for the sake of High Art&quot;  I don&#39;t get any of this from the PPC.

            <p><i>Both entities require structure in order to grow in any useful way.</i><br><br>Well, I do disagree.  Fandoms have been moving themselves along for decades.  The PPC is only different because the creators were actively involved, and some of us knew them personally.  So there is a greater sense of obligation towards them . . . but at the end of the day, it&#39;s just a fandom like any other.  It doesn&#39;t need to be tightly controlled and centralised to survive.<br><br>Obviously my last post was a bit hyperbolic.  I don&#39;t really think of the PPC as a cult, and I also don&#39;t actually use a cane.  ;)  However, the movement from the original requests -- use our gadgets, use our naming structure, run a spell check -- to a month-long personal audition is a leap.  If someone can communicate clearly, their Agents pass the sniff test, and they&#39;ve read a few good missions, they deserve Permission.  Even if they don&#39;t want to participate in the community at all, and you&#39;ll remember I&#39;m a big fan of the community.<br><br>I should clarify that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the fault of the PGs themselves*, they&#39;re all fabulous (Neshomeh particularly, please don&#39;t feel I was picking on you because you were the PG involved in this thread.  I wasn&#39;t -- I only posted here because one of the proposed agents caught my eye.  You know I think you&#39;re great.  ♥)  I&#39;m only criticising the process.<br><br>The IRC isn&#39;t a great fit for me.  I have to grab brief moments of internet in between running around after an eleven-month-old, so a forum is the only option.  Sadness.<br><br>Anyway, I didn&#39;t mean to spark a huge thread (sorry Bluesunnyday).  I don&#39;t have a horse in this race, I&#39;ve had Permission for nearly a decade, and obviously it&#39;s been ages since I was active in the community I so loudly champion.  My opinion really isn&#39;t relevant, so honestly, carry on doing what works for the PPC of today.<br><br><i>*Except that hS guy.  I don&#39;t trust him.

            <p>But regardless of how many or few rules there are for permission, you still agree that there should be a permission process? It would still eat up board space, and as Neshomeh says, the rules are stringent mostly in name only, since she almost never rejects requests. </p>

            <p>Your opinion is important, whether anyone agrees with it or not.  You have been around longer than most of us today and that is something to respect.<br><br>A few points before I go back to work:<br><br>1)Fandoms do grow on their own without structure.  That is true.  That is also where we get Sues, though, and I believe we are against Sues in our fandom, yes?  So in order to have a fandom where Sues and other forms of bad writing are discouraged we need standards.  In order to enforce those standards we need a group with some manner of control.  The standards are what make us different from other fandoms.<br><br>2) Hyperbole is fine, but it seemed to have taken on a life of its own.  You were not the only person I saw talking like this is a cult and the PGs are the shadowy figures pulling the strings.  Hyperbole can be taken too far.<br><br>3) The rule about being around for a month is more like a guideline.  That is how I have always heard it used.  &quot;Hang around so we can get to know you.  That usually takes about a month.&quot;<br><br>4) The IRC doesn&#39;t work for everyone.  I include myself in that number.  I am an infrequent user, at best.  But this has at least sparked some discussion about Boarders and Chatters and how to bridge the gap (read Nesh&#39;s post down the thread).<br><br>5) I have never seen someone with as many hats as hS.  How does he do it?<br><br>Again, your opinion is important and without this discussion we would not be talking about possible ways to change things.  It is when you keep quiet about the things that you feel are not right that we have problems.  We had at least one respected member of the community that kept quiet until it was too late to change anything quickly enough and they ended up leaving.  I don&#39;t want to see that to happen again.<br><br>We can&#39;t change things unless we know they need changing.  And we don&#39;t know that they need changing until we talk about them.</p>

            <p>I certainly agree the PPC should have standards.  But if it were up to me, I would probably empahsise the need for thoughtful, high-quality concrit after publication, rather than emphasising the preventative measures beforehand.  The PPC could meet newbies where they are, help them improve, and it would feel more inclusive.  But then I know how hard it is to dredge up concrit sometimes.

            <p>On the one hand, I would really want that to come back. I hate the idea of the PPC becoming formal and bureaucratic and red-tape-draped and &quot;Fill out this form, then wait the requisite X amount of time,&quot; and so on. I even hate all the back-and-forth sniping that often seems to go on about the canon and the wiki and the constant &quot;So, in this specific situation, how do I handle this as a writer?&quot; questions, because it seems like everyone&#39;s terrified to step on the toes of the Almighty Precedent. And I know I&#39;ve contributed to that, and I wish it wasn&#39;t so.<br><br>But on the other hand, back in the day, the PPC was a little tiny corner under a little tiny trapdoor in a corner of the LotR fandom, and a handful of others. Now, we&#39;ve got our own bloody TvTropes page<s>, all attempts at cleaning of which get filed under &quot;censorship&quot; or &quot;whitewashing,&quot; so yay them</s>. I worry that if we tried to be more informal, we&#39;d wind up inundated with badfic ourselves, as well as even more This Is Srs Bsns types. Maybe I&#39;m just paranoid, though. <br><br>I dunno. What does everyone/anyone else think? I doubt there&#39;s only two people in the community with an opinion, here.</p>

            <p>I personally like the current Permission system. I mean, I was rejected the first time I asked, which forced me to get a beta, hang around here more, read more spinoffs and generally get familiar with what people do in the PPC. that way, I was much more serious and put a lot more effort into my stuff once I had permission. I guess what I&#39;m saying is I like the fact it requires potential writers to think of the ability to write in this setting as a privilege, and encourages them to put serious effort into their missions. Also, I found my way here from TVTropes.<br><br>The only real flaw I see with permission is the limited number of ACTIVE permission givers. Of the top of my head, I can think of four who are active in the IRC and one who is only active on the board, out of a list that is much longer than that. This means that there can be a &quot;long&quot; (several day) wait between requesting and being granted permission. This may just be my generally impatient nature speaking though, and not an actual flaw.</p>

            <p>is all exciting and shiny like a Permission request.<br><br>I don&#39;t know that it is always so absolutely strict and serious.  I signed up last February, posted several things on the Board and chatted on the IRC. Basically, I participated in the group. When I put together a Permission request (two weeks later), yes, I did get the caveat that I need to be sure to use a grammar beta (which I always do), but Permission was granted.<br><br>I think the waiting period has much more to do with joining the community and participating than with a set amount of time. One month seems to have been settled on hoping that it will encourage people to join in.<br><br>Listening to various PGs talk, usually the single biggest complaint they have with Permission Requests is having no idea who the person is. It really doesn&#39;t matter if you introduced yourself in November of 2010, if here in June of 2011 that was the only time anyone has heard from you then we have no more idea who you are than we do the person who introduced themselves yesterday.<br><br>Maybe we could find a way of re-wording it to put more emphasis on participation and less on a specific amount of time.<br></p>

            <p>Perhaps also make it clear that the IRC does count as part of the community. I had at least one person tell me that my lack of participation on the board might make it hard to get permission, despite the fact that pretty much anyone who frequents the IRC knows who I am.<br><br>Obviously this isn&#39;t to say that one should never partcipate on the board, but it is certainly easier to get to know someone via the IRC, because it allows for instant conversations and the like, while this board, or any forum really, moves much slower.</p>

            <p>To be honest, I have some concern that the IRC is a separate clique from the Board, which is not good—the Board is our home, as it were, as the stubborn refusal to leave it can attest. But as Phobos pointed out, the IRC really is filling in the role of the social community, so maybe it&#39;s time to build a bridge. Especially since, as Guvnor said, most of the PGs are more active there than here.<br><br>And, thinking back on it, the old chat was much the same. I know I used to feel like I was missing out because I couldn&#39;t be in there all the time, and everybody who was were all good buddies, so maybe that&#39;s where my concern is really coming from. So, how can we be more inclusive of IRCers on the Board while also being more inclusive of Boarders in the IRC?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Honestly? I like the IRC better. The only reason I even visit the board is because there are people here who aren&#39;t there, and as such stuff happens here that doesn&#39;t happen there. I am not particularly fond of the board&#39;s format and whatnot, and would totally be in favor of a move to an actual forum, but that&#39;s an old tired road that I&#39;ve argued my way down many times before, and it always leads nowhere.<br><br>Anyway, my point is that your concern is not entirely unjustified, because I know there are others like me who prefer the IRC to the board because it&#39;s quicker, easier, and over-all a better way to have a conversation that doesn&#39;t take days.</p>

            <p>Of course, as Kaitlyn demonstrated, the reverse is true for other folks. Personally, I much prefer a slower format because it gives me time to look over my words and make sure I&#39;m saying what I mean without worrying about the conversation sweeping off without me in the meantime, and I like that everything is out in the open and sticks around for a while. But as you come here, I go to the IRC because there are people there who don&#39;t come here much, and good conversation to be had (if it&#39;s not too busy).<br><br>So, there&#39;s definitely a role for both. Discussing what those roles are and how people with one preference treat people with another looks like it&#39;s on the menu for the survey, which I think is a good idea.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t like the chat room, largely because I have trouble connecting to it and when I do manage, no one&#39;s around, simply because of the time zone I live in. I certainly agree that newbies who are active on the chat shouldn&#39;t be denied Permission just because they aren&#39;t so active on the Board, but would like to make the point that <i>I</i> will never be able to grand them Permission because I will never recognise them.<br><br>Perhaps we should ask that, when people make their request, they say whether they&#39;ve been more active on the chat than the Board, if relevant?

            <p>And I&#39;m leaving all my hats off to do it:<br><br>What about a poll? We&#39;re all sitting here deciding how we would like the PPC to be, but most PPCers aren&#39;t involved in it (not because of shadowy-cabal-ness, but because they just aren&#39;t). Wouldn&#39;t it be a good idea to have a poll to find out what the PPC-at-large think the PPC should be like? I&#39;m thinking questions like the following:<br><br>-Why are you in the PPC (could be multiple-choice)?<br>-What do you think the PPC Board should be for?<br>-What do you think the IRC should be for?<br>-What do you think the PPC Wiki should be for?<br>(And so on for anything else anyone can think of)<br>-How do you think permission to write PPC stories should be given (using the full phrase rather than the Capitalised Title so&#39;s to not restrict people&#39;s options)?<br>-What changes would you make to the PPC as a whole?<br>... and so on and so forth. Possibly that first one should be &quot;What do you think are the purposes of the PPC?&quot;. I&#39;m thinking this wouldn&#39;t be about how long you&#39;ve been here, writing, reading, fandoms or anything (which were all covered very well by July&#39;s excellent survey), but simply about what we want the community to be.<br><br>If an agreement on a list of questions can be reached, I&#39;d be happy to collate the results and make what sense I can of them.

            <p>I second what VM said about the growth of the PPC contributing to a correlating growth of the amount of &quot;system&quot; in place. Anarchy is great in small numbers, but it doesn&#39;t work anymore once you get to the point where not everyone knows everyone else, which is where we&#39;re at here. There does have to be some method of making sure everyone is on the same page, or we won&#39;t be. And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a bad thing.<br><br>I also remember when Permission was less of a big deal, and I would appreciate it if people would stop treating it as some huge rite of passage. It&#39;s not like having permission to write PPC stories makes you any better than anyone else or more welcome to hang out, after all (at least, those of us who have been here longest keep saying so). However, it does mean that you can string two sentences together with a minimum of SPaG errors, and it does mean that you&#39;re not going to write a Sue or Stu agent, and it does mean that you&#39;re not going to go completely against the spirit of the Original Series (and have, in fact, probably actually read the Original Series). And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a bad thing, either.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who can probably count on one hand the number of times she&#39;s withheld Permission since 2008, just for the record.</p>

            <p>I know on the IRC, a bunch of people recommended posting an Introduction thread before you did anything further-- what we meant, though, was not to introduce your characters, but yourself, as a writer and a person-in-general. What&#39;s your favorite color? What are your favorite canons? Why do you want to join the PPC? How&#39;d you find us? What&#39;s your favorite spin-off? Do you like chocolate more, or... uh, something else? (Yeah, I can&#39;t think of anything that&#39;s comparable to chocolate. Except possibly garlic.)<br><br>In short, <i>who are you</i>?<br><br>(As an aside: <b>after</b> you&#39;ve been here for at <i>least</i> a month, you should post not only your characters&#39; profiles, but a sample of your writing. It&#39;s also customary to link to a badfic you intend to spork/kill/otherwise attack. Just character profiles will get you nowhere, because they tell us nothing about your actual writing skill; the reason we do the Permission thing is to make sure people writing for the PPC are, in fact, good writers.)</p>

            <p>How do agents on missions see scenes that are supposed to be private? Like, if one character were talking to another alone in an enclosed space.

            <p>As IndeMaat said, it really does depend—on how enclosed the space is, who&#39;s involved, etc. The means for getting around it also depend. You mentioned a canon invisibility cloak, Antigone mentioned the See-Through Device, reading the Words is always an option. Additionally, Rez and Flip once hacked the security system of the spaceship they were on to keep tabs on the Sue in the next room; or the agents could be disguised as something that generally goes unnoticed, like house-elves; or they could simply be close enough to overhear without being in the same room; or if it&#39;s an Earth-like canon, they could potentially bug the room; etc. The possibilities are as limitless as the situations themselves.<br><br>To a degree, the SEP Field <i>does</i> protect the agents from being noticed by Sues and other non-canons as long as they aren&#39;t being loud or otherwise drawing attention to themselves, so it is possible to just rely on that in the right circumstances, too. But honestly, that&#39;s less fun. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>If the Sue is in the private scene the agents can&#39;t join, because they would be spotted immediately. If the private scene is between canon characters the agents can easily be in the same scene: their SEP field protects them.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s mention on the wiki of a &quot;See-Through Device&quot; that would let agents view a scene without entering it.  However, following along with the Words seems to be more frequently used.</p>

            <p>Hi.<br>I found some REALLY nauseating badfic (mostly Kingdom Hearts) and I was wondering- what do I do with it?

I don&#39;t know if the nature of being a Darklord was changed in the novels, and it&#39;s been long enough that I&#39;m not getting my hands on them without dumb luck or too much money.<br><br>There&#39;s also the practical consideration that sending Agents into the Ravenloft demiplane could be effective suicide.  The Dark Powers that rule Ravenloft are greedy, and they don&#39;t let their &quot;toys&quot; leave.  In the game supplements, it&#39;s pretty much established that once PCs enter Ravenloft, they&#39;re stuck there.  The agents could portal in easily enough, but they may not be able to portal out.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m working on my first mission, and I&#39;m not quite sure what to do about one of the chapters in the badfic. Basically, it&#39;s a couple paragraphs in which one of the Sues randomly decides to turn evil. She insults all the good guys and walks off. Then the author&#39;s note informs us that this &quot;never will and won&#39;t actually happen,&quot; and the next chapter just picks up where the story left off and never mentions this chapter again. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen this kind of chapter before, and I&#39;m wondering what to do about it.</p>

            <p>by some odd coinsidence I&#39;m thinking of Back to the Future II, but that&#39;s just me... though it was a good movie..<br><br>Anyway, it really does sound like a very strange thing. I&#39;ve read alternative endings to the same story, but outright alternative chapters is a new one. What could happen to your agents, is that they just took the wrong turn, and now they need to back-track, and follow the right words. <br><br>If you imagine the words suddenly splitting up into the odd chapter, and the rest of the story, much like a road splitting up into a road to a dead-end swamp and a road to a glorious field, you could say, your agents just took a wrong turn in reading the words.<br><br>This is just a thought I have... but having a loop like Meta suggested could be fun aswell, and yes, see if you can&#39;t kill of the Alt!Sue before the story goes on. The more killing the better... I&#39;m sorry, did I say that out loud?</p>

            <p>I&#39;d go with the action happening, and then have a sudden wierd temporal/causal loop suddenly flinging the agents back into the main bulk of the fic.  You could even have fun with having to kill the Alt!Sue as well if you had the time.</p>

            <p>This seems like a massive Big Lipped Alligator moment to me. Maybe the scene happens and then the fanfic just goes on like it would&#39;ve without that scene in there, thus leaving two very confused agents?</p>

            <p>You were able to essentially spork the same fic twice without making the two stories redundant, and both are enjoyable.  I love, <i>love, LOVE</i> Agent Arthur to death, and I had never even heard of the Junkions before this mission!

            <p>As someone who has been dabbling with Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse elements for the purposes of world flavor, I am interested in where you picked up what you know. I&#39;m not a linguist myself, more of an armchair etymologist, but still. {= )<br><br>I am wondering who went so far as to reprimand you for writing PPC stuff without Permission. Usually we settle for more of a &quot;Hey, did you know?&quot; and an invitation to this place. Especially since you say it was written four years ago.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t call it a closed world, either, seeing as what we want most is for the people who want to write PPC stuff to join up and get to know us. We want folks in, not out. {= )<br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_The_Board">This</a> may or may not help with using the Board. One thing it doesn&#39;t mention, for instance, is that you can use regular HTML in your posts like I just did. <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">The wiki</a> in general is full of useful information, though if there&#39;s something you can&#39;t find, just shout out.

            <p>What I know of Anglo-Saxon is pretty limited. I took a class on the history and structure of English, which involved memorizing a passage from the Old Testament in Anglo-Saxon and Middle English. I know basic syntax and that clauses are mostly inflection/agreement clauses. I can manage things with basic grammar if given enough time, and I can sound out words like a pro, but that&#39;s about it.<br><br>It was a light reprimand. Your description sounds accurate.<br><br>Thank you for the links! And thank you for letting me know I can use HTML! I won&#39;t abuse it, promise!<br><br>Glad to be here!<br><br>ILE</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not well versed in the online sources, but there are plenty of books written on it. I use my notes from my structure and history of English class.<br><br>After a quick look-about, <a href="http://babaev.tripod.com/archive/grammar41.html">this</a> looks like a pretty good basic guide. If you want to go in-depth into it, I&#39;m pretty sure the only way is to take a dictionary, pick up some Old English texts, and translate until you&#39;re comfortable with the language.<br><br>When choosing a dictionary, make certain it has grammatical markings with every word, the gender (if it&#39;s a noun) if it&#39;s weak or strong (for verbs). If it doesn&#39;t have such markings, then it will be very difficult to translate properly, and you&#39;ll know that the material was probably put together by an amateur who doesn&#39;t know much about Old-English.<br><br>Good luck! </p>

            <p>Coming from someone who complained about the lack of banter in my first mission, that means a lot. Like I said above, this mission was a lot of fun to write. I really was trying to flesh out Thomas&#39; personality more, and make him less of a goofball. (Although he&#39;s still goofy.) I think that helped him be more than someone for Orken just to groan at. But hey, that&#39;s just what I think, and I had a lot of fun with that early stuff when I wrote it. <br><br>Also, the chance to stick a Goa&#39;uld in Orken&#39;s head was too good to pass up. Just saying. :p</p>

            <p>This was a very good mission. Having four agents didn&#39;t seem to slow things down at all, and there were several moments that had me laughing out loud.<br><br>- “I doubt very much anyone Upstairs has a personal vendetta against you, Agent Thomas.” Secretly, he thought his partner might have a point. Thomas was a very annoying young man.<br><br>- “He likes it if you call him ‘Agent Orken,’ so please don’t.”<br><br>- “Oh, for the love of- Why is she tied to the criminal underworld?”<br><br>- There was a moment of silence, and then Lee said, “Ian, as much as I like you, please get your elbow out of my stomach. And whoever’s hand that is, you’d better move it. Otherwise, you’re in danger of losing it.”<br><br>- “Why don’t I have any tape? Even Scotch tape would do!”<br><br>- Face full of furry.<br><br>- He <b>looked at </b>Orken<b> with confusion, but before </b>Orken<b> could explain </b>he<b> was roughly grabbed by </b>his<b> hair.</b> Orken, with his short hair cut, was making this difficult.<br><br>Etc.<br><br>The final resolution (and the following interlude) are brilliantly ironic, and I love them.

            <p>Actually,yes! I did some research on it&#39;s wiki page. ^_^<br><br>The PPC (Protectors of the Plot Continuum) is headed by Jay and Acacia (...right? I know those two are important...). It is composed of &quot;Agents&quot; who go into badfics and correct all the,well,badness. There are several departments in which these Agents work in. To name a few,there&#39;s the Department of Mary Sues (called Assasins),Department of Implausible Crossovers (called Untanglers or Disentanglers), and the Department of Bad Slash (called Bad Slashers or Excorsists)<br><br>...That&#39;s all I remember for now.

            <p>When I read the Harry/Snape line, I just substituted Tai/Matt (from Digimon) because there&#39;s a lot of stupid slashfic about those two. There&#39;s so many pairings in fandoms, I wonder what happened to friendship. Also, the &quot;Tenth Walker&quot; line was hilarious!</p>

            <p>I had the Taylor Swift version since singing her version should be somewhat easier for me as a female singer. I&#39;ve always liked Last Christmas since I was little so I really enjoyed singing this filk,so thank you for writing it. If you ever re-write the lyrics I&#39;d be more than happy to sing it as well. :) Also never be shy to ask me to sing something. I love to sing. </p>

            <p>I thought I may as well ask, seeing as I&#39;ve had the idea for these two rattling around in my head for the past week and feel that they could make for some very interesting missions.<br><br><br>Writing sample (essentially the story of how the two agents got started at the PPC): <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QAm3pNC5X7n6Wk06a-DjEhKeNbXfpkhLhC2gyqou5uo/edit?hl=en_US&amp;authkey=CNX718YO"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QAm3pNC5X7n6Wk06a-DjEhKeNbXfpkhLhC2gyqou5uo/edit?hl=en_US&amp;authkey=CNX718YO">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QAm3pNC5X7n6Wk06a-DjEhKeNbXfpkhLhC2gyqou5uo/edit?hl=en_US&amp;amp;authkey=CNX718YO</a></a><br><br>Name: The Fisherman<br>Age: 209, visually late 20s<br>Home Continuum: Doctor Who<br>Species: Time Lord<br>Department: Floaters<br>Division: Special Operations<br>Fandoms: Star Trek, Haruhi Suzumiya, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Death Note, My Little Pony: FIM, Half-Life, Portal, Silent Hill, Resident Evil<br>Weapons: Prefers to improvise weapons as and when they&#39;re needed<br><br>The Fisherman first encountered the PPC after his TARDIS was thrown out of the time vortex by an unknown entity and crash landed in a DoSAT equipment testing area. He was subsequently shot by a rogue humanoid entity and regenerated. It was soon established that returning him to his home continuum would prove difficult due to the Time War, and as such he was given the chance to join the PPC, a chance which he gladly took.<br><br>Following basic training, his TARDIS was upgraded to function as a Response Centre, and he was partnered with Agent Evie (see below), who just happened to be the rogue humanoid who shot him when he first crash landed. Despite the Fisherman&#39;s protests, the Marquis de Sod insisted that partnering the two was a good idea.<br><br>The Fisherman is relatively young for a Time Lord, and therefore does not have nearly as much knowledge or experience of the universe as some of the more famous members of his species. However, he likes to believe that he does, which can often lead to some rather embarrassing and/or dangerous situations. He does not share the aversion most Time Lords have to using weapons, but prefers to improvise his tools as the situation develops.<br><br><br>Name: Evie<br>Age: 24<br>Home Continuum: Portal<br>Species: Cybernetically augmented human<br>Department: Floaters<br>Division: Special Operations<br>Fandoms: Metroid, Dead Rising, Dead Space, Halo, Discworld, Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy, House MD, CSI, NCIS<br>Weapons: Integrated Portal &#39;turret gun&#39; in left arm, also fond of close-combat weapons in continua where using a gun would be inappropriate<br><br>Evie is an anthropomorphic representation of GLaDOS rescued from a Portal fic. She was first taken to FicPsych and underwent extensive counselling and re-conditioning in an attempt to restrain and redirect her homicidal impulses. Doctor Freedenberg subsequently released her into the care of Agent Chase of the Department of Sufficiently Advanced Technology in order that her cybernetic systems could be taken care of.<br><br>Chase managed to reprogram much of Evie&#39;s bodily technology to ensure that she would have complete control over it, and that it would be more likely than not to interact peacefully with PPC technology.<br><br>Evie retains much of her non-humanoid counterpart&#39;s personality, and therefore has a sharp wit, is prone to making cutting sarcastic remarks and is extremely pragmatic. However, she has been trained to direct her more violent impulses toward enemies of canon, and has a particular hatred for relationship!Sues.<br><br><br>Just something I thought I&#39;d add, I realise that having a Time Lord (or any similar such &#39;god&#39;-like character) as an agent is recommended against, however, I believe that I&#39;ve done enough to prevent him from becoming overpowered or able to solve problems trivially. Furthermore, the &#39;upgrades&#39; to his TARDIS have ensured that it will not easily be used a Deus ex Machina (given that it&#39;s a miracle it works at all with the extras attached!).<br>If you have any further recommendations, please do tell me.<br><br>The fic I&#39;m looking at sporking is this &#39;Haruhi Suzumiya&#39; citrus-flavoured monster: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5862786/1/Odd_Experiences"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5862786/1/Odd_Experiences">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5862786/1/Odd_Experiences</a></a></p>

            <p>First of all, welcome! It&#39;s always great to see new people around here. To answer the first of your questions, there are many ways to make and/or become a PPC agent. First off, you&#39;ll need Permission if you want to write missions. Now, you don&#39;t need Permission to hang out on the Board and chat with us; that&#39;d be kind of silly. <br><br>Your agents, when it comes to the time to make them, can literally be from anywhere. For example, my main pair of agents, Ian and Lee, are from two totally different universes. Ian&#39;s from our Earth and universe, while Lee is from an alternate Earth that is magic-based.<br><br>As for how one PPCs a badfic, well, each writer has their own unique style, but there are several very helpful articles on the Wiki that go into greater depth than I can at the moment. The links are on the front page of the Wiki, and the link to the Wiki is at the top of the Board. <br><br></p>

            <p>They get official when you write your first mission, or at least when you&#39;re given permission. I, for one, am waiting to finish the mission in order to write their pages on the Wiki, because not long ago these guys and girls of the Board took a lot of time to erase agents who were never used. </p>

            <p>Basically, just Wait around a while, make sure people know you pretty well, think up a couple agents, find a fic, post up your agents and a sample of your writing, and ask for permission! <br><br>If you&#39;re not sure that your agents are up to snuff/your writing is the right sound/what to do with this Sue, ask away! Anyone on the board would be glad to help!  <br><br>The most important thing is to get to be known here, so that we as a group know how you write and whether or not you get the flavour of the PPC. Participate in conversations and games, pop into the IRC every once in a while if you feel like it, start a few posts, that sort of thing. <br><br>By the way: Hi there! I&#39;m Rosie!

            <p>Hi there Rosie! Awesome to meet-er,meep ya too! :)<br><br>Well,okay,if I should wait awhile,I&#39;ll do that. I already made up two agents so far. One I know I&#39;m sure I&#39;m going to use,but the second one... not too sure. I&#39;ll keep working on it.<br><br>Hmm,so that means I should probably work on my writing... after all,it&#39;s improved a lot since I first joined FF.net but it&#39;s still not exactly perfect... but aside,since I recognize some people here (from FF.net) maybe I&#39;ll go say hi to them. :)</p>

            <p>Ah, the old &quot;Imperfect writing&quot; problem... Truth? We&#39;re all imperfect! But what separates us from the badficcers is that we go out of your way to get advice and correction from people who know something. <br><br>Spelling is not my strong suit. Punctuation, however, is. Therefore, I may hand my work off for someone to look over, spelling-wise, and they will ask me to check their punctuation.

            <p><font>Howdy, thanks! <br><br>One thing that inspired me to write Modern!Vampire was the way I write metafiction itself - the characters treat their roles in fiction as day jobs, but their jobs are to act out their own roles inside their story, almost like a Reality TV documentary show. So the question is, what happens when a character reads the end result? I figured it might be something like an actor watching his own movie, and of course if the role was really bad, they might not like it. So that&#39;s where I got the ideas for those two clowns. <br><br>Since Modern!Vampire and FanFiction!Vampire are applied across a very, very wide spectrum of fiction, I left their descriptions intentionally vague, as well as left out the other characters&#39; names to preserve the generic feeling of the characters and make it easier for the audience to insert or attach their own meanings to them. Definitely a stab at <i>Twilight</i> though! <br><br>Glad you liked it. </font></p>

            <p>And you know the worst thing? There&#39;s actually a small minority of unscrupulous publishers that WILL publish fanfic (for a large cost paid up front, of course). It says a lot about their standards when you consider the fact that they will willingly publish a book called (I&#39;m not kidding) &quot;The Vagina Ass of Lucifer Niggerbastard&quot;, which appears to be a random mixture of expletives strung together with no logic at all.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and assume the author was a 13-year old boy who assumed saying a bunch of bad words in a written work would make him seem edgy and mature. Clearly, it did not work.<br><br> Technically, Lulu actually took it down; he just put it back up in the cookbook section, knowing that they wouldn&#39;t bother checking it. Also by him (I don&#39;t remember his name and I don&#39;t care to remember it) include such fine works of literature as &quot;Robo... and the Rug Niggers of Afrofaggotstan&quot;, &quot;Dairy Stain and the ... of Cthulhu&quot;, and &quot;...

            <p>I see that you&#39;re correct. However, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to be the only one who skips over the introductory section. If it&#39;s short, I do it pretty much by default: usually my feeling is that if it&#39;s only a few sentences, it&#39;s not telling me anything I don&#39;t already know. Basically, redundancy never hurts, especially, I would think, in this case.

            <p><br>&#39;When you are writing about your agents and HQ, you are borrowing the world that was created by Jay and Acacia. They specifically requested that spin-off authors use their gadgets and follow their naming system for new stuff. This has since been interpreted to mean generally keeping to the spirit of the Original Series. Permission ensures that people who want to write a spin-off actually want to write a PPC spin-off and not make up something completely different. (Making up something completely different is cool, but calling it &quot;PPC&quot; is not.)&#39;<br><br>&#39;We take pride in the fact that our stories are well-written. If someone asks for permission to PPC, and that person&#39;s post is riddled with bad spelling, grammar, and logic, permission will not be granted. What right do we have to mock people&#39;s stories if our own writings are just as bad? Additionally, it would be super-hypocritical if the PPC ended up full of Sue and Stu agents who are not reformed.&#39;<br><br><br>Q. What can I use for my writing sample?<br>A. Basically anything except a PPC story or a co-written work, as long as it reflects your ability to use spelling, punctuation, and grammar. Humor is encouraged but not necessary. Fanfiction, original fiction, and agent backstories/introductions have all been used and are all fine. </p>

            <p>I have a few little comments, but nothing major: <br><br>* I&#39;d get rid of the brackets here:<br><i>We take pride in the fact that our stories are well-written. (What right do we have to mock people&#39;s stories if our own writings are just as bad?)</i><br>- And I&#39;d not put the &quot;Additionally, it would be super-hypocritical...&quot; bullet point a level in from the last; best to put it in the last paragraph, or soft-return it so it doesn&#39;t have a new point. Or, give it a new point that&#39;s level with the other two.<br><br>* I love the &quot;and for Eru&#39;s sake, cheer up!&quot; bit :)<br><br>* In the answer to &quot;Q. When should I ask for permission?&quot;, I think you should make it a little more clear that the standard is one month minimum, or else a lot of people will see that &quot;as quickly as two weeks&quot; bit and consider <i>that</i> the minimum.

            <p>Part of the purpose of the re-write is to de-emphasize &quot;one month&quot; and place more emphasis on interaction/participation.

            <p>A. Absolutely not. Just being around, reading the stories, and basically hanging out with us makes you a PPCer. Plenty of respected PPCers have never written a single mission. One of them is a Permission Giver herself!<br><br>^^^<br>The &#39;absolutely not&#39; as an immediate answer sounds a little harsh and can be misinterpreted until you read the rest of the paragraph.

            <p>Following some discussion further down the page, it was decided that the best way to figure out what people think about the PPC is, well, asking them. So here you go. This is an <b>anonymous</b> survey (all I get is the answers you give, plus a timestamp) about what you think the PPC should be for, and various related topics (including the giving of Permission). If you know anyone who doesn&#39;t visit the Board too often, but would fill out this survey (which <i>isn&#39;t</i> just about the Board), let them know!<br><br>The survey has thirteen questions, and they&#39;re all completely open-ended (essay questions rule!). You don&#39;t have to answer all of them, so even if you have only one thing to say - say it! If you only have a few minutes at a time, you can go through multiple times, so just say whatever you can think of.<br><br>There&#39;s no need to reply to this thread and tell us you&#39;ve done it - but there&#39;s no reason not to, either. If you can think of any changes that should be made to the survey, please <i>do</i> reply here - I can add them in then.<br><br><a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&amp;formkey=dGFxQ0tpUzZyWXZxTC1BRmlxX3ZRWHc6MQ#gid=0">Go fill it out!</a><br><br>(Please note: This survey is designed to give everyone a better idea of what their fellow PPCers are thinking. It&#39;s not a binding, rule-altering anything)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I know I don’t post to the board nearly often enough, but I feel this is something important enough to get up off my ass and make known.<br><br>I give up. I can&#39;t deal with this shit any more. Among other things: The passive aggressive sniping, the angry overreactions, have gone too ...ing far, and too ...ing long. Yes, I am aware we are all stressed. Yes, I know we’re all angry and so on. But that is no reason to act like utter jerks to each other, and have the bystanders take the fallout. I can&#39;t take this shit anymore. I&#39;m not participating until we as a whole put on our big girl panties and chill the ... out and deal with this like we’re the ...ing adults we are. We&#39;re all stressed and we&#39;re <b>all</b> annoyed, but big ...ing deal. This is a <i>community</i> about glorified goddamn fanfiction, not Jerry Springer. I refuse to take any more of this shit. ... that noise.<br><br>When we’re so focused on fighting, that we’re willing to go into the same tired old argument because ‘whoopsie! someone let out their religious or political beliefs!’ and that we get so cross that when people try to tone it down, or take it elsewhere or side track, that bystanders get hit in the crossfire and dragged in? That’s not cool. Not in the least. I am tired of having to pussyfoot around folks because I don’t know if there has been the daily fight yet today, or who was involved and now in a pissy mood. I’m tired of having to play devil’s advocate for both sides. I miss the quote unquote ‘Good Ol’ Days’ (tm) because then it was still silly and goofy and fun. We could go into a detailed look into badfic and not get yelled at. We could have a silly RP with horrible massive crossovers and mischaracterization and it didn’t matter because it was fun and people enjoyed it. <br><br>We all need to take a giant goddamn chill pill, and relax. Stop taking ourselves so seriously, and realize that not every comment that doesn&#39;t perfectly agree with your personal views is a personal attack.<br><br>Now onto the latest fight: #PPC2, and the implications.<br><br>#PPC2 was spawned as a one time room where people could go in the midst of a fight, and still hold a conversation without being hit with the crossfire. That was it’s original and innocent intent as far as I know. It was meant to be a room where people could retreat to, and leave when the fight was over. A pop-up room, essentially. Now, I do realize that while it was well intentioned, it was executed poorly. Only a handful of folks knew, because those were the ones around during the fight, they only invited folks in via PM, or folks (like myself) found it by chance when I saw it on a few people’s /whois. I understand that it was handled poorly when some of the people in the main room found it, and the wrong people went and tried to explain. <br><br>#PPC2 is in no way a personal attack on anyone. It is not an attempt to break the PPC into factions. The irony of the non-fight room being the cause of a fight, is, while amusing, not lost. As said previously, I understand we’re all stressed and annoyed because life sucks and ‘zomg it’s sooo totes unfiar’. However, this should not, and should never be an excuse for vicious and drawn out fights where both parties walk away mad. There are debates, and then there are goddamn catfights from hell.<br><br>I know for a fact, that I’m not the only one who is tired of this constant tension and stress, and I’m sorry it came to this.<br><br>Thanks for reading. *steps down from her soapbox and takes cover*</p>

            <p>I know from experience moderating over on LJ&#39;s trans_9 game, having someone (or a group of someones) able to keep a level head and just tell people to knock it off is absolutely crucial when you get groups of people with large personalities together.<br><br>And what is the PPC if not a group of large personalities, always? <br><br>I came back to the PPC largely because I remembered the camaraderie that I used to experience in the old chat.

            <p>Seconding the nominations of Miah, yourself, and VM as arbitrators. And, not to put myself forward, but I have said before that I&#39;m available to listen to any sort of complaints or concerns about anything PPC-related, confidentiality guaranteed if desired, active mediation also an option. I don&#39;t really think I&#39;m in the chat enough for any sort of official responsibility there, but I&#39;d love it if people vented to me rather than letting their frustrations build up into a big explosions like this.<br><br>I noticed you&#39;re formulating some actual written rules and a system of enforcing them, too, which I heartily approve since they&#39;re so clearly needed. I think a lot of the trouble has stemmed from feelings of uncertainty and inconsistency on this score. Of course, some of the things I&#39;ve heard of, not necessarily related to the second room, also sound like blatant disregard for others. That is much harder to solve, but making it clear that there are expectations of how to behave in a public channel ought to help. I wish it wasn&#39;t needed, but unfortunately the honor system seems to have been ignored on multiple occasions.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Concerning the DAs, the point is that they&#39;re people we can rely on to be rational, and tell us when we&#39;re not being rational. So, yes. They have the authority to stop a conversation, but it&#39;s consensual - because we, as chatters, accept that they have the perspective to tell us that we&#39;ve lost ours. I do not think that the DA who calls &#39;halt&#39; should be the person who backs it up with op powers.<br><br>And for Miah, she has said that it was an honest mistake, and apologized. It&#39;s up to you if you can accept that or not. I can.</p>

            <p>The IRC has been really tense lately. I always feel like I&#39;m gonna accidentally piss someone off with almost anything I say, even if I&#39;m just asking questions or discussing random stuff.

            <p>that just anybody saying drop it doesn&#39;t work is that when people are not being rational, it seems that the &#39;drop it&#39; person always gets grouped by BOTH arguing parties as &#39;enemy.&#39;<br><br>It&#39;s because it&#39;s situational. Most of the arguments START because somebody expresses their opinion, somebody says &#39;no,&#39; and then the first person fights back. Somebody saying &#39;no, cut it out&#39; to a single argument doesn&#39;t get us anywhere because it causes both parties to either ignore that person, or even fight back against that naysayer with things like &#39;you don&#39;t understand!&#39; or &#39;but this is important/insulting/srs bns!&#39; and the like.<br><br>Having an omnisituational arbiter that can say &#39;cut it out&#39; removes the personal factor in stopping an argument. There&#39;s no more &#39;no, YOU need to stop I am telling YOU AND YOUR OPINIONS TO STOP,&#39; but a &#39;this is an argument and drama needs to stop, no matter what it is.&#39;<br><br> When an arbiter says &#39;no, stop&#39; to people, it&#39;s not a personal attack or a negative response to the argument&#39;s subject matter and expressed opinions. It&#39;s simply what that person does for ALL arguments, and not a cause for drama against that person.<br><br>So yeah...</p>

            <p>Is because speaking up has always been an option, and only very few people have ever seen fit to exercise it.

            <p>This link was my first encounter with Sary, and by golly it is it a bad one.

            <p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really &#39;legendary&#39; material, as far as badfic goes, mainly because it&#39;s completely and utterly crack.

            <p>I love me some good AU. Here are some great what-if stories that love and revere canon and cherish it and reap the fruits of their care in writing.<br><br>Final Fantasy VII<br>   The Fifth Act, by Sinnatious<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5951824/1/The_Fifth_Act"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5951824/1/The_Fifth_Act">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5951824/1/The_Fifth_Act</a></a><br>    -Perhaps the best &#39;time travel&#39; fic I have ever seen. You know, the sort that has the main protagonist travel back in time in an attempt to fix the problems of the canon before they begin? It does have a happy ending, but manages to be so intelligent in regards in the canon and be so masterfully crafted with plenty of literary devices and twists that it makes a disturbing amount of sense... and is dramatic enough while doing it I actually got scared in the middle for the characters. It&#39;s a great AU, one of those &#39;this is how it really would have gone, I can&#39;t imagine it would go differently after reading this&#39; stories. The characterization is spot on, even when the fates of certain characters are changed drastically...<br><br>The Legend of Zelda<br>   Cry For Hyrule, by Seldavia<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3993350/1/Cry_for_Hyrule"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3993350/1/Cry_for_Hyrule">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3993350/1/Cry_for_Hyrule</a></a><br>   - Yet another AU, this one exploring a possibility that the King of Red Lions&#39; intentions have not always been pure. This AU fic is so rooted in the game&#39;s canon it is disturbingly convincing to some people, and even the parts that are made up fit in with other games in the series and make sense of the Zelda Timeline. This is a fic I found so powerful as a growing fanwriter that made it into my own personal fanon for The Legend of Zelda (Daphnes was actually using Link for his own ends, being the fanon)and coaxed me into a lasting friendship with Seldavia herself. This fanfic is on the tvTropes fanfic rec page for the Legend of Zelda... one among THREE fics there written by Seldavia, all recommended by DIFFERENT PEOPLE. <br><br>   The Fourth Piece, by Davin Sunrider<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3616333/1/The_Legend_of_Zelda_The_Fourth_Piece"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3616333/1/The_Legend_of_Zelda_The_Fourth_Piece">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3616333/1/The_Legend_of_Zelda_The_Fourth_Piece</a></a><br>   - This fic takes a lot of hated tropes in The Legend of Zelda and remakes them as goodfic, with a lot of thought and skill put into the story. If you like long war sagas, this is for you. It isn&#39;t as perfectly based in canon as the others are on this list, but enjoyable nonetheless. And not only that, it starts out quite good but as you read it you can see it get better and better as the author takes advice from others.<br><br>Metroid<br>   I, Pirate, by Seldavia*<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5451766/1/I_Pirate"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5451766/1/I_Pirate">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5451766/1/I_Pirate</a></a><br>   -This fanfiction follows the Metroid Prime games, but not from the perspective of Samus. It follows the perspective of a Space Pirate of the science division that becomes self-aware due to Phazon radiation. The fic sheds so much light on the possible organization of Space Pirates, but it really earns gold stars for portraying this OC&#39;s growing and learning so well that the tired &#39;OC tags along with Samus&#39; plot becomes so involved and believable that Samus&#39; characterization actually becomes richer to the reader for it. In my personal opinion, this fanfic feels MORE LIKE CANON than the literal adherence to Metroid canon itself at times...<br><br><br><br>*Actually, can we just get Seldavia up here as a Legendary Goodfic author? This is not because she is my friend, but that I BECAME FRIENDS WITH HER because she wrote goodfic, and was the first goodfic writer I ever encountered... and she has not STOPPED writing goodfic, ever.</p>

The story hugs canon pretty closely to start except in terms of inner monologue until chapter 4, and then it&#39;s unrecognizable. Elspeth, the narrator of &quot;Radiance&quot;, is a semi-original character with her own approach to the theme. The Flashes will be mostly in third person and cover a wide variety of characters.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;ve never read the HP one, but I hear it&#39;s good too. (not a nomination)</p>

It&#39;s a fantastic deconstruction of the various tropes and concepts behind badfic set in the Kingdom Hearts universe. Yeah, it&#39;s a bit trollish and heavy-handed with messages at times, but the humor more than makes up for it.<br><br>The story also has its own TV Tropes page, if anyone is curious. <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThoseLackingSpines"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThoseLackingSpines">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThoseLackingSpines</a></a></p>

            <p>...If you don&#39;t know the fandom and are voting for it based on the fact that people who are in the fandom think it&#39;s good. Everyone&#39;s idea of what makes a fic good or not varies, and some have far more stringent standards. You can&#39;t really say it&#39;s Legendary Good or not unless you are in the fandom yourself <i>and</i> have read it yourself, because otherwise it turns into a popularity and hearsay competition.<br><br>While the PPC is one of the last places you&#39;ll find a questionable fic rec, your average idea of a good story here is not going to be the same as that shared between a group of your average thirteen year old fic writers. Not to mention for that matter that not all tastes are the same, and that should be taken into account. There are some awesome stories I&#39;ve read on fanfiction.net I wouldn&#39;t rec here because they twist canon to the point of being  unrecognizable between the changes to the setting, characters, tone, and anything you could imagine. It wouldn&#39;t fit most people&#39;s tastes and really only meets a very broad definition of &#39;fanfiction&#39;.<br><br> There are some very excellent stories I have read on fanfiction.net that I wouldn&#39;t rec as a general sharefic or suggest to nominate for a Legendary Goodfic because they aren&#39;t actually very good fanfiction in the sense that even the basic setting is barely recognizable, a few chapters in, because it&#39;s been that changed from the actual canon, let alone anything else most peoople like reading within the context of fandom. <br><br>If you look at the Legendary Goodfic page, it is a very, very short page that consists of very few entries. Those current entries are, for the most part, overwhelmingly known about and agreed upon as being excellent fic.<br><br>For example, practically everyone in the PPC knows about OFUM. Everyone who was active in the LotR fandom right when it was getting its huge rush of Mary Sue fics knows about the Don&#39;t Panic fics. If you read slash in the Harry Potter fandom you probably had the Shoebox Project recommended to you or you&#39;ve recommended it to someone else. </p>

            <p>Oooh! I second this one! Seriously, it&#39;s delightful sendup of fanfiction makes it an enjoyable read.<br><br>As for my own nomination, I nominate &quot;Crowns of the Kingdom (<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3159333/1/Crowns_of_the_Kingdom"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3159333/1/Crowns_of_the_Kingdom">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3159333/1/Crowns_of_the_Kingdom</a></a>)&quot; by Karalora. Don&#39;t be put off by the rather purply prose, it&#39;s a really good story that delves into the history of the Disney Universe with plenty of action and adventure.<br><br>(Also, are we only allowed to recommend one goodfic title each? &#39;Cause I think I can dig up a few more over at the  TVTropes fanfic rec page...)</p>

It&#39;s a lengthy oneshot with a GO fandom rarity: a depiction of Aziraphale and Crowley as the heterosexual besties the authors intended! Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with shipping; don&#39;t get me wrong, I love A/C shipfic. But A/C non-shipfic is every bit as good, if not better, being closer to the canon and all.</p>

I can tell you name and my address and my e-mail and not fear that someone will come to kill me. Because for a year and a half, I was a Controller. Complete!<br><br>My Comments: I&#39;ve heard of the fic before, but only really read it on a recommendation from Guvnor of Space. After finishing it, I can only say that his view of it is merited, and much more. The OCs are well-characterized, with personalities that look and feel like real people. While the Canon Characters make few appearances (the Animorphs themselves show up two times in the later chapters), their influence can be felt all throughout the story, affecting the protagonist in both positive and negative ways.      </p>

            <p>I am nominating this fic for Sharfic or Legendary Goodfic status.<br><br>This is a Sherlock Holmes fic, by an author who has many great stories, but this one is the best of the best.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5466355/1/The_Particular_Problem_of_Postern_Prison"> The Particular Problem of Postern Prison </a><br><br>Summary: Pride takes a fall when young Mr Holmes accepts a challenge from the Yard in another of his early cases. With his career in the balance, can he right old wrongs, renew past alliances and stay alive in the notorious Postern Prison? Seq to Chiro. COMPLETE!<br><br>My comments: This is the fourth story in a series of stories about a young Sherlock Holmes who is just beginning his career as a consulting detective. You do not have to read the others in the series first. There are a few mentions of events in the others, but this story carries its own weight.  I recommend this story so highly that if it ever became possible for this author to sell this story (and the other three in the series) in physical book form--I&#39;d pay actual money to own a copy. </p>

Several of the Five, most notably Tigress, think he is out of his mind, while Po has faith in his enemy. Can a father undo his past mistakes?<br><br>My comments: Brace yourselves, people: this is a really LONG read. The chapters are all extremely long, but it is absolutely worth every moment invested in the story for how deep it is, particularly given the source material. It&#39;s publishable in quality and has some incredibly deep characterization for everyone involved, even the original character.</p>

            <p>Wow, life really got in the way. I joined way back in April. I wasn&#39;t on the IRC much (just once, and from what I&#39;ve skimmed just now on the Board, it&#39;s not a pleasant place to be right now), and before I could really become integrated on the Board, real life dragged me away to the point where I couldn&#39;t even check the site anymore. T.T Anyway, it&#39;s summer vacation now, so I&#39;m hoping to be a little more active. I&#39;m fairly certain no one remembers me, so I thought I&#39;d make a little &quot;welcome back, here I am&quot; post. ^_^&#39;<br><br>Just one question: What&#39;s going on with the IRC? Fights? Just on the Board, I usually got a feeling of unity and carefree joviality (with the occasional dispute). So what&#39;s happened? :(</p>

            <p>If I recall correctly, Eris was the Greco-Roman spirit chaos who accompanied Mars/Aries whenever he went out into battle.  She had a golden apple of discord. If she threw it between friends, the friendship ended there and then.  If she threw it between enemies, war broke out.  <br><br>I don&#39;t know why in the world someone would choose that name for a goofy teen-age girl.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s been some discussion about the permission process here on the Board lately (started <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=212199;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>, followed up on <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=212456;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>). I suggest reading up on it, for a start. Keeping track of the Board in general is also recommended, as is trying the wiki for information about lots of stuff. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Now I&#39;m kind of confused. Is there no permission giving for a while until the permission process is revised, or what? </p>

            <p>Well, not really. I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be weeks/months/A Long Time before we have some sort of answer to what, exactly, we want to change, and how. In the meantime, unless I missed something big, permission is still entirely grant-able. If anything, we&#39;d go in the other direction, not <i>stop</i> granting permission - I believe the main points of contention were that the process was too formal.<br><br>Overall, I think what Neshomeh meant was that the process is going through change, and therefore there&#39;s nothing like a Set In Stone sort of rules Ru should be aware of, not that no one can have permission until this is fully decided.<br><br>(Of course, this post is just as much of a shot in the dark as yours.)</p>

            <p>Okay then... I suppose there&#39;s not any rush. I do have to get used to this whole system for at least a month before I get Permission on anything,right? <br><br>So I guess I&#39;ll just do what Bluesunnyday did and post here and there and get to know everybody and everything until I&#39;m not too &quot;shiny new&quot; anymore. :) Thank you!</p>
