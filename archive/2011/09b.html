            <p>I know we&#39;ve got quite a few full-length playlists out there, but let&#39;s have a chat about songs you think epitomise the entire PPC - and why. I have two to start with.<br><br><u>Brother, Stand Beside Me</u> - Heather Dale<br><br>Okay, so <a href="http://heatherdale.com/">Heather Dale</a> is pretty much my favourite singer ever (the chapter titles of Crashing Down are taken from her song of the same name), and while this isn&#39;t my favourite song, it does sum up what I think of the PPC as a whole.<br><br><i>Brother, stand beside me<br>Brother, lend your arm<br><br>The land below lies stricken<br>And this fight is nearly come<br>Let them sing, let them sing our praises<br>When we&#39;ve gone<br><br>See the weakness in the world<br>And choose to be strong<br>Let them sing(etc)<br><br>All it takes is one to say<br>We&#39;ll take back that ground<br>Let them sing (etc)<br><br>Let a world too tired to sing<br>Relearn its song<br>Let them sing (etc)</i><br><br>It has it all - the community spirit, the small beginnings, the fact that we believe the world of fanfic, though it has been taken over by badfic, doesn&#39;t have to be this way - and that we can do something about it.<br><br>My other song is taken from the original Playlist...<br><br><u>We Are</u> - Ana Johnsson, apparently<br><br><i>What about the world today<br>What about the place that we call home<br>Weâ€™ve never been so many<br>And we&#39;ve never been so alone<br><br>You keep watching from your picket fence<br>You keep talking but it makes no sense<br>You say we&#39;re not responsible<br>But we are, we are<br>You wash your hands and come out clean<br>Fail to recognise the enemies within<br>You say we&#39;re not responsible<br>But we are, we are, we are, we are</i><br><br>I know nothing whatsoever about this song or the artist, but since I first heard it it has become the epitome of the PPC spirit, for much the same reason as Heather&#39;s. Although I&#39;m sure someone will tell me it&#39;s a song in praise of genocide in Bosnia or somesuch, to me it will always be a PPC song.<br><br>So who else has got one? Songs for the entire PPC, community or fictional (?) organisation. And can we make an album from them?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Kinda weird, but I think Chameleon Circuit&#39;s &quot;Exterminate, Regenerate,&quot; though quite clearly a Doctor Who song, shows much the same idea between the PPC and Sues as between the Doctor and the Daleks.

            <p>I discovered them through Rilwen around the beginning of last year, and became an utter fangirl - they do songs inspired by lots of fantasy books, literature, mythology. They&#39;re basically geeks who write and play awesome music. :P<br><br>I have seven of their albums now and saw them live last September in London - it was one of the more mindblowing experiences of my life, and I can&#39;t wait till they visit England again.<br><br>I can send you some of the songs I have stored on my laptop, if you&#39;d like. I&#39;ve the full concept album based on the <i>Silmarillion</i> (which is what first got me into them), plus numerous assorted songs from their other works.</p>

            <p>Well, there&#39;s a couple I associate with characters, but one I&#39;ve always felt would go really well for some kind of PPC music video was &quot;Face Down&quot; by the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. The song itself is about spousal abuse (and the implied consequences that follow against the abuser), but it&#39;s not that big of a leap of imagination for it to be about canon abuse (...and, the implied consequences).</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s a few that never fail to put me in mind of the PPC.<br><br><u>My Life Would Suck Without You</u> - Kelly Clarkson<br><br>Hold off on the knee-jerk &#39;modern pop music sucks&#39; reaction, at least for a moment. I personally think that the lyrics are very telling of a typical PPC partner relationship.<br><br><i>I know that I&#39;ve got issues<br>But you&#39;re pretty messed up too<br>Either way I found out<br>I&#39;m nothing without you<br><br>&#39;Cause we belong together now, yeah<br>Forever united here somehow, yeah<br>You&#39;ve got a piece of me<br>And honestly<br>My life would suck without you</i><br><br><u>Still Alive</u> - Lisa Miskovsky<br><br>No, NOT the GLADoS one! This is a completely different song (although it did come from a video game.) It&#39;s hard to describe what makes this feel like the PPC to me. I just always picture that brief moment of calm every agent has in between missions when I listen to it.<br><br><i>You have changed <br>I have changed <br>Just like you <br>Just like you <br><br>For how long <br>For how long <br>Must I wait <br>I know there&#39;s something wrong[...]<br><br>No shadows <br>Just red lights <br>Now I&#39;m here to rescue you <br><br>Oh I&#39;m still alive <br>I&#39;m still alive and <br>I can&#39;t apologise, no</i><br><br><u>Raise Your Glass</u> - P!nk<br><br>Whatever reputation I had here, I must be torpedoing it right now with all these fairly mainstream pop songs. Still, I can&#39;t let this opportunity go by without mentioning Raise Your Glass.<br><br>The PPC is never going to truly &#39;win.&#39; As long as there are fantastic fictional worlds, there will be badfic. Agents are typically outnumbered, outgunned, and in danger of completely losing their minds. They are the eternal longshots, and this song is perfect for that.<br><br><i>Slam, slam, oh hot d*mn<br>What part of party don&#39;t you understand<br>Wish you&#39;d just freak out<br>(Freak out already)<br><br>Can&#39;t stop, coming in hot<br>I should be locked up right on the spot<br>It&#39;s so on right now<br>(It&#39;s so f*cking on right now)[...]<br><br>So raise your glass if you are wrong<br>In all the right ways<br>All my underdogs<br>We will never be, never be<br>Anything but loud and nitty gritty<br>Dirty little freaks<br>Won&#39;t you come on and come on and<br>Raise your glass<br>Just come on and come on and<br>Raise your glass</i><br><br><u>Sam and Max: The Office</u> - scored by Jared Emerson-Johnson<br><br>My final song is an instrumental piece from the Sam and Max series by Telltale Games. It&#39;s a noir-ish jazz piece that puts in mind of a pair of beleaguered agents returning back to their RC after a long stretch of missions. You can listen to it at this link: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOLjrZCGPrg"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOLjrZCGPrg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOLjrZCGPrg</a></a></p>

            <p>The title pretty much says it all, doesn&#39;t it? The lyrics are not linear at all, but the bits I can make sense of struck a chord with me the first time I heard it, and it became the centerpiece of my Nume and Ilraen soundtrack:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_l7EUHmYPk">Mission</a> - Dispatch<br><br><i>Let it be known, to all your misbelievin&#39;<br>What you&#39;ve been seein&#39;<br>That we will not stand<br>Will not be mistaken<br>We will go there leave this weakness<br>Can&#39;t take this from me<br>We will go there leave this weakness<br>I have been waiting<br><br>Lo we are not so we&#39;re on a mission<br>Lo we are not so we&#39;re on a mission<br>Lo we are not so we&#39;re on a mission<br>Lo we are not so we&#39;re on a mission<br>To be so well<br>Oh well<br>The way I see<br><br>Said he goes<br>He goes down missin&#39;<br>Down, down<br>There&#39;ll be no talk of turnin&#39; back yeah<br>Damn this, damn that<br>There&#39;ll be no talk<br>That we will fly sometimes<br>We will find our own way<br>We will fly sometimes<br>We will find our own<br><br>chorus<br><br>We are not so<br>We are not given<br>We are not sold on what we have seen<br>We are not so<br>We are not given<br>We are not sold on what we have seen<br><br>We&#39;re gone we&#39;re gone<br>Good-bye we ain&#39;t never comin&#39; back now<br>We&#39;re gone we&#39;re gone<br>The list is long we are many strong<br>The ceilings are coming down<br><br>Lo we are not so we&#39;re on a mission<br>Lo we are not so we&#39;re on a mission<br>Lo we are not so we&#39;re on a mission<br>Lo we are not so we&#39;re on a mission</i><br><br>What does it mean? It means we&#39;re not impressed with the BS out there, we&#39;re not alone, we&#39;ve got a job to do, and so help us, we&#39;ll do it together. At least, that&#39;s what I think.<br><br>Dispatch rocks, by the way. You&#39;ve probably heard of another of their songs, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3JjlkfX5Gk">The General</a>. That one doesn&#39;t work for the PPC, but it&#39;s a great message for the real world.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So!<br><br>For you all who have not been around for all that long and also have not read every single item on the wiki (For shame! You should start that right now! We have a list of every article on the wiki. It is most helpful for the task that is set before you. I suggest getting started on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Special:AllPages">this immediately, what with there being 2319 pages and counting.</a> There will be a quiz held in a secret location in HQ at a secret time and you will have to determine where and when you will need to arrive through decoding hidden messages I will be placing throughout the board in the next week. You will also need a time machine, a rubber duck, and octarine paint.) you are probably not aware of the existence of the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Agent_of_the_Week">Agent of the Week feature</a> that used  to be a staple of the wiki for roughly half a year and then very sporadically afterwards.<br><br>So, the nurses at FicPsych have been Agent of the Week for.... *checks calender* roughly 80 weeks and counting now. <br><br>I think it might be time for a new Agent of the Week.<br><br>So, nominations will be accepted here, and whichever agent ends up with the most nominations will be made Agent of the Week.<br><br>When making nominations, keep the following in mind: &quot;the Agent of the Week award honors Agents for their contributions to the PPC or generally memorable missions, personality, or general insanity.&quot;<br><br>Please have a prepared short blurb as to why the agent in question should be Agent of the Week.<br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Featured_Agents">Agents may not receive this twice, so here&#39;s a list of who has had it before.</a><br><br>Agents who win are presented with a shiny award, bragging rights, and negative one month&#39;s vacation in acknowledgement of their contribution to the PPC.<br><br>Please do not nominate your own agents. Unless you really want to, but good luck there.</p>

            <p>Yep, I was one of the people who was talking about it. And I think it&#39;d be a cool idea. I like the idea of being able to go to another channel when one was overstuffed or people were talking about something heavy when you had just had a hard day and wanted to relax.</p>

            <p>This author has been writing some weird stuff, mainly using Kingdom hearts characters and some OCs and putting them into disney stories.

            <p>Swan Princess falls squarely under that category of Disney Renaissance copycats that tries to emulate that whole aesthetic as best they can. Well... that, and by the time Disney had started cranking out direct to video sequels for all their classic movies from the Disney Animated Canon, Swan Princess already had like <i>three</i> of them, so... yeah.<br><br>As far as I&#39;m concerned, the source material is still <i>so</i> much better than Swan Princess anyway.<br><br>I mean, for one thing, the source material is a freaking Tchaikovsky ballet!

            <p>All right, everyone. We have a problem.<br><br>There have been a whole bunch of issues of late in the IRC. I don&#39;t go there, for a great many reasons, but I have several reliable sources on this one. I&#39;m <i>not</i> going to name any names, but I <i>am</i> going to list what&#39;s been happening. So to the PPC IRC in general: here&#39;s your charge list.<br><br>-Ignoring the rules of the PPC Constitution. Rule 1, people, it&#39;s the <i>first one on there</i><br>-Bullying<br>-Making fun of people for things they have said or done<br>-Ignoring repeated requests to stop doing things which offend<br>-Ignoring clear statements and indications that people&#39;s feelings are being hurt<br>-Lying. Lying about what&#39;s happened on the chat, lying about why things have happened<br><br><i>Any one of these points</i> is an utter disgrace. I don&#39;t care who you are - I don&#39;t know most of you - but <i>stop</i>. <b>Now</b>. The PPC community was set up by Jay and Acacia to <i>entertain</i> and to <i>unite</i> fans of their work, not to belittle and divide. And you know what? If insults are your thing - if you have to make fun of people to feel good about yourself* - if your normal mode of conversation involves putting other people down to raise yourself up - if, in short, you think that <b>any</b> division into Us and Them belongs in the PPC community - then <i>this is not your playground</i>. There&#39;s an entire internet out there for you to insult and attack each other on - keep it <b>out</b> of the PPC.<br><br>And if you&#39;re going &quot;But he doesn&#39;t mean <i>me</i>!&quot; right now - <b>how sure are you</b>? Because if you are on the chat, you <i>need</i> to take a good, long, hard look at yourself. If you&#39;re not sure about something you&#39;re going to say, <i>don&#39;t say it</i>. I hate to break the immersion, people, but this is not real talking. You <i>can</i> and <i>should</i> edit yourself. There are no excuses.<br><br>In fact, you know what? <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/Constitution.htm">This is the PPC Constitution</a>. Every single one of you, go and read it - right now. Done that? Now be honest with yourself - do your actions in the PPC conform to both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution?<br><br>If you want to know what hat I&#39;m wearing right now, it&#39;s the one with a giant sign that says &quot;I&#39;ve been here longer than virtually anyone else who isn&#39;t my wife and I will <b>not</b> see the PPC go down now&quot;. I don&#39;t wear it very often.<br><br>But now, taking that hat <i>off</i> for a moment, I have a question for the PPC: <b>What are you going to do about this?</b> The IRC <b>isn&#39;t working</b>. People are using it to hurt each other, and that <i>is not right</i>. So I&#39;m asking you - all of you - everyone - to come up with a plan. I don&#39;t use the IRC, I don&#39;t really know how it works, but those of you who do, please, for the sake of the PPC, for the sake of everything we&#39;ve created here - find a solution. Make it work. <i>Please</i>.<br><br>hS<br><br>*And no, that is <i>not</i> what the PPC is about. We make fun of <i>fictional characters</i>, not their authors. If you can&#39;t see the difference, look again. Look long and hard. ~hS</p>

            <p>Flaming is also covered under rule 0 - it&#39;s explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, and hasn&#39;t been that big of a problem compared to other things, so I didn&#39;t think to include it again.<br><br>And yes - I&#39;m not entirely sure how best to deal with situations like that, but overreacting and bringing power to bear without cause is definitely against the spirit of the rules.</p>

            <p>Short answer, no.  Now obviously, on to the very long answer.<br><br><br>From July&#39;s post.  <i>Miah, for whatever reason, actively lied about what happened. This wasn&#39;t colored or biased perspective. This was an outright lie. She wasn&#39;t even saying anything when it actually happened. She wasn&#39;t involved. VM was. Artell was asleep. Maslab was going at it just as much as I was.<br><br>Miah was also involved with the second chatroom incident- she&#39;s the one who, along with Data, created it. To me, this brings up the question of, if she lied here, where else has she lied? This is the sort of person who was just nominated to become a Permission Giver, and I have a huge problem with it.</i><br><br>As anyone who has chatted with me for very long knows, I am very scatterbrained. I have three kids. At the point of this chat, I had an additional five to six neighbor kids that were in my house all the time. I know I was talking to Maslab in another window, attempting to work out with him if there was a way he&#39;d apologize. I don&#39;t remember specifically, but I was probably in the main room, secondary room, and other private chats at the same time.<br><br><br>When I was talking about the not leaving off, this is what I was talking about.  <a href="http://pastebin.com/nKZHwxUi"> Short version </a> and if you want more info, <a href="http://pastebin.com/kF50rjLh"> Long version </a>.  This happened two days prior to the quitting. <br><br>As soon as I saw the log that Joe presented here (after it had been posted on the Board), I knew I had been talking about two separate incidents.  I also saw (after calming down enough to read the log sensibly) that I was exactly as clear as mud as to that point in that chat.  For the not being clear, you have my excuses, and I am sorry that I made that mistake.<br><br>However, this part of my involvement could have been resolved long before this was posted on the Board, by showing me this log and asking me about it. <br><br>I find that incredibly disappointing.<br><br>I thought this community was better than that.<br></p>

            <p>&quot;I thought this community was better than that.&quot;<br><br>Yes, I have been thinking this a lot over the past weeks.<br><br>Anyway, the issue was that in a chat with Joe you claimed that I&#39;d tried to keep going a discussion regarding a story about Maslab&#39;s grandparents. I have never taken part in such a discussion or any afterdiscussion. You linked a log about a conversation over Hot Topic, which I felt went pretty civilly all things considered. Heck:<br><br>[2011-07-27 12:39:13] * Aster looks at July very hard. &quot;Artell was the good part.&quot;<br><br>My part in the convo took a whopping 30 minutes, and it kept dancing from subject to subject. This is what an organic discussion usually looks like. After people started complaining about the subject, I dropped it. Of course, your log ends there, so the log doesn&#39;t include whatever chat happened afterwards that didn&#39;t have anything to do with the topic. <br><br>Bottom line, this statement to Joe:<br><br>[18:26]  Everyone else in the room, including Maslab, immediately dropped it. July and Artell tried five or six times to continue it, but everyone ignored them. I thought it was a pretty good use of the let&#39;s drop the subject thing.<br><br>Just doesn&#39;t hold water when it comes to my involvement.<br><br>If I must apologize for talking about politics, then I can, but like July pointed out, I am a political scientist, and I could prepare a long essay on why I think it&#39;s essential to talk about politics. And like in what you posted, I will drop the matter if no one cares.<br></p>

            <p>You&#39;re right. I re-read the whole thing when I looked up the logs, and you were having a conversation. I&#39;m sorry that in this, I have overlooked how you were probably feeling about it. I&#39;ve always thought of you as a pretty cool, though sometimes very academic guy.

            <p>Firstly, I&#39;d like to say why I love the IRC.<br><br>To explain this, I have to share one of my most painful formative experiences. When I was about fifteen, I read somewhere that if you were in a group of people, and you started a story, then the natural flow of conversation went away from your story and no one asked you to continue then you were talking too much--butting in on group dynamics.  Basically that your contribution at the time was not a valued and wanted thing. You should stop right there and try again later.<br><br>I started paying attention. I stopped going on when no one asked me to continue. No one asked me to continue. For the rest of high school, not even my parents, sister, and other family members.  I went to college and got the same thing.  On into work life. More of the same. Nothing I have to say has ever been important enough to matter enough to anyone for them to make a point of going back in the conversation and ask me to continue.<br><br>I love the IRC, because people actually ask me to go on. They say they like my stories. People like the PPC stories I write. Before this debacle, there were more than a dozen people that thought highly enough of me to nominate me as being in what passes as authority in the PPC. When I said I was surprised and flattered, that was absolutely genuine. I am not used to being anything other than a barely tolerated hanger-on.<br><br><br><br>From July&#39;s post:  <i>This clique includes- but is not limited to- Maslab, Miah, HerrWozzeck, Aster, and Data.<br><br>Miah and Data set up the private secondary chatroom. Maslab regularly flouts the spirit of the PPCâ€™s rules and will, when itâ€™s brought up, ask what rules he has broken and continue being a berk with the insistence that he has done nothing wrong.<br><br>Miah set up the chatroom, and did that lying thing. She isnâ€™t actively engaged in starting drama, but she has helped it by encouraging the cliquish behavior thatâ€™s made it turn into a â€˜Boo Julyâ€™ fest with a lot of people. </i><br><br>Read this. Really read it. Read the logs from #PPC2. Not just the relevant bits. All of them. Make your own decision about my having turned anything into a &#39;Boo July&#39; fest.<br><br><br><br>I have people within the PPC that I am more friendly with than others. My best friend in the PPC is Caddy-shack (who isn&#39;t even on the clique list). EllipsisFlood, Flareshard, Data, Maslab, Tray-Gnome, Doctorlit, Pretzel,  DML, VM, Dann, and HerrWozzeck are all pretty high on the list.  Aster, PoorCynic, DigitalSocrates, Pieguy, Gaijinguy, Hawkelf, Blayze, RosieAzRael, MaxInsanity, WikiMaster, NordRonnoc, Phobos, Neshomeh, Makari, and anyone else who comes to chat, but I haven&#39;t had quite as much interaction with are a bit lower on the list, but still higher than people I&#39;ve never directly talked to. <br><br>This place means a lot to me. Probably a lot more than an Internet group should mean. Yes, I am friends with some people to the point that I consider them more than just a fellow sporker.  I think it is great when people make connections with others.<br><br>Do we really want to start calling anyone who is friendly within the PPC a clique?<br><br></p>

            <p>To my knowledge, I never said in #PPC2 that the purpose was to exclude July, because I didn&#39;t like her. I have read through all of the logs presented here nothing I said in these contradicts my reasons for starting #PPC2. I repeatedly stated that it was to escape drama.

            <p>There is an apology that I need to make. But first, a confession. I have a side of me that I normally keep under strict wraps. Lately, I haven&#39;t been doing that. I got too comfortable and forgot that not everyone (or anyone, really) likes to hear these things.<br><br>I am a snide comment-maker. It&#39;s not something I am particularly proud of. I do it in RL, too. For instance, if I saw <a href="http://media.peopleofwalmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/1425.jpg"> this</a>, then I&#39;d definitely be thinking something rude (did style go right over his head?).  If someone was with me, then as soon as I was out of earshot, I&#39;d be saying it.  In certain settings, this kind of behavior is acceptable. For instance, in mocking badfic. <br><br>What is not acceptable is that I have been taking my bad days and thinking (and sometimes saying) snide things about people that I think of as friends.  I will be doing my best to not give voice to these things again, but if anyone does see me doing it anywhere--main room, second room, private chat--give me a smack and remind me that that is not okay.<br><br>So to anyone that I have made listen to me make snide comments, and to anyone that I have said anything about, I am sorry.  At this point all I can do is humbly beg your forgiveness and make every effort to not let it happen again.</p>

            <p>We feel like a couple of points haven&#39;t been addressed. A lot of us are guilty of not stepping up and asking people to stop making snarky or otherwise impolite remarks, both of us included. We&#39;ve read the logs, specifically <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?attid=0.1&amp;pid=gmail&amp;thid=13282dce59a5bd41&amp;url=https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui%3D2%26ik%3D2531cf65a1%26view%3Datt%26th%3D13282dce59a5bd41%26attid%3D0.1%26disp%3Dsafe%26realattid%3Df_gsrr8bzd0%26zw&amp;docid=7afe65f89e68b6a9a9027ed6b0a1fbfa%7Cea6a0d23fd7d37a41a722ac6991772d1&amp;chan=EAAAAGX%2BroTJ1r7dY0ad23sh8WkiRBAXReo/1/aClWvsTHtX&amp;a=v&amp;rel=zip;z2;2011-06-10.195657-0400EDT.html">this one</a>, and while we certainly don&#39;t see you making any, we also don&#39;t see you stopping them, despite all the assertions that #PPC2 wasn&#39;t for bashing or excluding people. For example, in response to some negative remarks about VM&#39;s and Artell&#39;s use of vocabulary:<br><br>(9:01:56 PM) Caddy-shack: Eh, it makes me wants to drop them in a blender.<br>(9:02:28 PM) Tray-Gnome: ...<br>(9:02:38 PM) Tray-Gnome: Caddy.<br>(9:02:39 PM) Miah: Caddy, I&#39;d laugh, but I know you&#39;re serious.<br><br>And the conversation moves on. It&#39;s not much of a censure for a pretty violent remark, and one acknowledged to be serious. Also, where was the censure for the conversation about how &quot;using those high end words&quot; is &quot;snobbish&quot;? Those remarks were bashing other PPCers for their vocabulary, of all things. We are very confused about why that was okay in #PPC2.<br><br>Also, one of the most serious principles we have here is that we Do Not Bash Authors. And yet, in <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?attid=0.1&amp;pid=gmail&amp;thid=13282dce59a5bd41&amp;url=https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui%3D2%26ik%3D2531cf65a1%26view%3Datt%26th%3D13282dce59a5bd41%26attid%3D0.1%26disp%3Dsafe%26realattid%3Df_gsrr8bzd0%26zw&amp;docid=7afe65f89e68b6a9a9027ed6b0a1fbfa%7Cea6a0d23fd7d37a41a722ac6991772d1&amp;chan=EAAAAGX%2BroTJ1r7dY0ad23sh8WkiRBAXReo/1/aClWvsTHtX&amp;a=v&amp;rel=zip;z3;2011-06-12.170540-0400EDT.html">this log</a>, we have this:<br><br>(8:35:20 PM) ***HerrWozzeck rages about someone using the term &quot;retarded&quot; in a story to describe a mentally disabled person.<br>(8:35:40 PM) HerrWozzeck: Seriously, what the ..., badfic author?<br>(8:36:03 PM) HerrWozzeck: Why?<br>(8:36:10 PM) HerrWozzeck: I just... Graaaah!<br>(8:36:14 PM) HerrWozzeck: That bitch is going down.<br>(8:36:18 PM) ***Caddy-shack checks room, notes everyone is of sufficient age, allows Herr to rage as Herr wants to.<br>[cut for space]<br>(8:37:16 PM) HerrWozzeck: I just...<br>(8:37:20 PM) HerrWozzeck: I wanna punch that bitch.<br>(8:37:22 PM) HerrWozzeck: And then I wanna kick her.<br>(8:37:32 PM) HerrWozzeck: And then I want to strangle her with some god-damn wire hangers.<br><br>Nobody told him that he was over the line. We did see the part where Herr has a disabled sibling, but we don&#39;t think that excuses this level of hostility toward another human being. It was an issue of outright violating the constitution.<br><br>We are concerned more over the things you did not say than the things you said, and we would dearly love to hear some reassurance that you realize this, since you created the room that allowed it to happen. Not speaking out against bashing is equal to condoning it. We would like to hear that you&#39;re now going to commit with the rest of us to preventing the bashing of other people, and to correcting others if they do engage in it.<br><br>Another issue we&#39;d like to discuss further is that of cliques. We think that a clique is an insular group, meaning it doesn&#39;t easily include new members and may outright reject certain people. In the first chat log linked above, we find this:<br><br>(9:34:40 PM) Caddy-shack: Well, I was going to say that I am curious about VM, July, , and Artell doing this. It started off way to quickly with fancy words to not be semi-planned. <i>But also, the reason some of us are here is July and VM doing stuf.</i><br><br>Emphasis ours. We believe this is in reference to the discussion in the main chat about swearing rules, and we want to emphasize that no one corrected him. &quot;No, Caddy, we&#39;re not here to avoid specific people, just the drama,&quot; does not appear in the chat log. Since the whole of the PPC was not invited and some members were, in fact, deliberately avoided in #PPC2, we think that does make it a clique, and we do have a problem with that. We would like you to acknowledge that cliques as defined above are not nice, and that they do make people feel excluded, and that an attitude of exclusion isn&#39;t one we will foster in the PPC.<br><br>~Phobos and Neshomeh</p>

I tried to express myself thoroughly, and yet again failed. <br><br>I&#39;m sorry that you don&#39;t have the log where we later decided on rules for PPC2 and said that the thing with Herr was too much. I&#39;m sorry that I take things to PM instead of berating people publicly. I&#39;m sorry that I use drily sarcastic humor to defuse tensions. I&#39;m sorry that I am non-confrontational to the point of only having yelled at someone in anger once and still regret that. I&#39;m sorry for missing the point.  I&#39;m sorry that I deluded myself into believing that I was anything other than a hanger-on to this group. I&#39;m sorry that I couldn&#39;t even apologize to Artell without further insulting him. I&#39;m sorry that I let this place mean so much to me.  I&#39;m sorry that I am afraid to even be present in the IRC anymore. I&#39;m sorry that no matter what I do in life that I will always be the one that is wrong. I&#39;m sorry that I am afraid to talk to the people who aren&#39;t basing their entire judgment of my character on this incident for fear of that being seen as a clique. I&#39;m sorry for saying anything at all.  I&#39;m sorry that I can&#39;t be absolutely certain at all times that anything that I do or say or don&#39;t do or say won&#39;t be looked at months later and taken the wrong way. I&#39;m sorry that I&#39;ve probably said something in this post that offends someone. I&#39;m sorry that I try to be a nice person, and still say and do stupid things.  I&#39;m sorry that I am socially awkward and have great difficulty reading subtleties in situations.  I&#39;m sorry that emotions grab me with great intensity and then leave me just as quickly.  I&#39;m sorry that until someone explains to me how something makes them feel, that I am not able to figure it out on my own.  I&#39;m sorry I was afraid of some people&#39;s power several months ago, and I&#39;m sorry that I am even more afraid of it now. I&#39;m sorry that I&#39;m feeling this way.  I&#39;m sorry for making a public scene with this. I&#39;m at shutdown. There is too much conflict that I am apparently the root cause of, and I can&#39;t see the end of it. This will be brought up again and again. No matter how often I apoplogize, how sincerely, I just can&#39;t see it ever ending.  I&#39;m sorry that I am a coward, and I&#39;m sorry that I just can&#39;t do this anymore.  I can&#39;t. I&#39;m sorry.</p>

            <p>So, two things. Part the Beginning, as long as we&#39;re all coming clean here, I&#39;ve apologies to make as well.<br><br>To <i>everyone</i> who&#39;s ever been in the IRC quietly going &quot;...is she done yet?&quot; while I rant on, and on, and on, about Fair Trade, or sexism, or politics, or international issues, or religious strife, or whatever else I happen to be going on about. I know I come off really strong sometimes, and I know there&#39;s little that&#39;s more obnoxious than listening to someone soapbox on and on about an issue when you came somewhere to relax. I really will try to work on that; you guys shouldn&#39;t have to invent another channel just to get away from Srs Bsns Rants.<br><br>Aaaand to everyone who&#39;s feelings I hurt, toes I stepped on, explanations I didn&#39;t listen to, arguments I shouted down, issues I shrugged off, questions I ignored, and llamas I shaved. The PPC should never be an absolutist place, it should never have a hierarchy, and no one should ever have to keep their mouth shut because they&#39;re afraid of getting kicked for voicing an opinion. We&#39;re supposed to be a gleeful anarchy, and that only works if we all respect each other&#39;s voices. Saying that LotR sucks may get you an argument, but it should never get you a kick - that&#39;s in the Constitution too, I believe. Saying that you disagree with the level of swearing permitted in the room should also not be a reason to fear; everyone has a right to voice concerns, as long as they&#39;re voiced civilly and respectfully. That&#39;s what we&#39;re about here, and I do sincerely apologize for the part I played in harming that spirit and environment.<br><br>So. I&#39;m very sorry for the issues I&#39;ve caused and been a part of, and I will try to work on that in the future. That said-- if I slip back into old habits, if I step on your toes or hurt your feelings or shave your llama, please, <i>please</i> tell me. If I&#39;m not listening, kick me or something. Or pm me with a reminder of this post, or anything like that. I&#39;d so much rather know what I&#39;m doing wrong than go on being a jerk, really.<br><br>Part the Second!<br><br>It seems like everyone here&#39;s sort of in agreement that more self-moderation and respect and thoughtfulness and humor is a good thing. So... with that agreed on, with all of us responsible people and friendlyish as well, can we agree to bury the hatchet over this, and go on about our daily business of writing silly things and poking at the stupid in the world, both serious and silly, and leave the drama all behind us?<br><br>I&#39;ll shake hands if you will.</p>

            <p>And by &#39;Some people&#39; I mean everybody. I&#39;ve been constantly saying that nothing is wrong, that July was the root of all of our problems in the IRC, etc. because I didn&#39;t know any better. Yeah, I&#39;m probably in the IRC more often than anyone else (or was before I got a job), but I&#39;m rarely actually paying attention, and due to my sleep schedule I have periods where I sleep for an entire day. Usually that&#39;s when the Bad Things happen, meaning I&#39;m rarely there and only hear about it second or third hand.<br><br>What I&#39;m getting at here is that, until July posted her report and the logs, I had no idea just how bad certain things were. So, I would really like to apologize, because I feel terrible about potentially misleading people, or even seeming like I was trying to mislead people, through my own ignorance.<br><br>I would also like to apologize to July for all the times I was an ass to her. Especially that time I called her a bitch (even though no one, including her, seemed to disapprove of that, it was out of proportion for what she&#39;d done). I have, for a while, been working under the assumption that she was intentionally starting the arguments I saw, an idea that was only furthered by the fact that the only times I ever saw arguments when she wasn&#39;t around, they were about her. Even so, I never meant to offend or exclude anybody with the back-up channel. Though I never said it explicitly until after things had blown up, the reason I hadn&#39;t mentioned #PPC2 at the time was that I was waiting until me and Miah had set up some actual rules. I&#39;m not sure if any of the others actually wanted to make the channel public, but I&#39;m going to avoid making any assumptions about the motives of others if I can now.<br><br>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more that I need to say, but I figure that can be saved for the IRC. I&#39;m probably not going to show my face around the board for a while until it stops resembling a beet.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m making a speech, so, uh, yeah. Prepare to be inspired! And stuff! *gets up on soapbox*<br><br>I&#39;m glad this got ripped open again.<br><br>&quot;But Neshomeh!&quot; I hear some of you thinking; &quot;It&#39;s so awful! All the drama! Where&#39;s the PPC spirit?&quot;<br><br>Well, it&#39;s still here. I know it&#39;s here, because as much as this sucks right now, I see us starting to pull together to fix it and make sure it never happens again. Now that everything is out in the open, an amazing thing has happened: we&#39;re TALKING about it. People are realizing their mistakes and apologizing, and being forgiven, and committing to not making the same mistakes again. This is so important. We <i>must</i> be able to talk about unpleasantries, because otherwise they would be allowed to continue unchecked, and the resentment would grow deeper, and no one could reconcile. That <i>would</i> eventually mean the end of us.<br><br>Thank goodness July and hS had the cojones to bust this thing open. There was an infection of disrespect and unhappiness, and it needed to be lanced and drained. It&#39;s ugly and it smells bad when it comes out, but it&#39;s the only way to heal. It&#39;s no good to let things fester. Now we can clean it up, stitch it closed, and get on with things.<br><br>That&#39;s the PPC spirit showing. I see a lot of people working to keep this community together, and that&#39;s encouraging. Are all the problems going to go away overnight? No, of course not. We&#39;ll all have to work hard to keep our promises and not slip back into old habits. I think we can do it, though. I think everyone here loves the PPC enough that they don&#39;t want to leave, and I think that means we&#39;ll do the work, and help each other when we slip, and it will all get better. And, what&#39;s more, this will never be allowed to happen again. We know what to watch out for now.<br><br>I was thinking last night that maybe this is the backlog of drama that we never had finally catching up with us. Maybe it&#39;s impossible to avoid it entirely. If that&#39;s true, though, the good news is that we&#39;re in for another long spell of good times, and if it does seem we&#39;re heading this way again, we&#39;ll have the wisdom to nip it in the bud before it gets so huge. <i>That&#39;s</i> the PPC spirit: being able to learn from our mistakes and put forth the effort to improve.<br><br>So, that&#39;s why I&#39;m glad this happened. I admit I was annoyed when I first saw this thread, but then I thought about it. The issues were never really resolved before, and I&#39;m ashamed that I was content to let it all slip under the rug. I&#39;m personally making a commitment not to do that again.<br><br>I&#39;m enthusiastically taking up the cause Phobos suggested, what we&#39;re calling the &quot;Don&#39;t Be a Dick&quot; Campaign, which is inspired by Rule #1 of the PPC Board Constitution. More on this later (there might be t-shirts involvedâ€”maybe hats; we like hats around here), but this basically means that I promise to not be a dick myself, and I equally promise to speak up when I see others being dicks, especially if they&#39;re my friends. Friends don&#39;t let friends be dicks. Everybody&#39;s welcome to join us.<br><br>*steps off the soapbox*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I have to admit. When this got posted, I had already apologized for (or at least felt like a bag of butts about) most of the stupid things I said when I didn&#39;t know the context or impact of my words. And this not only brought it all up again, but exposed Past Me&#39;s idiocy to the whole PPC, I seriously considered leaving and not coming back until at least half of the IRC crowd had moved on from the PPC. <br><br>My honor will never recover. I do not want to be known as &#39;that scumbag who told July that her feelings don&#39;t matter.&#39;<br><br>But what am I going to do? Commit Internet!Seppuku?<br><br>Above all, my philosophy involves overcoming problems. Other aspects of it lead (or led) me to clash a lot with July as her own issues were in full, hideous bloom. Most of the time when somebody gets angry, my answer is that it&#39;s the internet and people fight viciously to defend trivial things because it&#39;s a dominance competition. This gross mis-evaluation does not at all cover July&#39;s situation, and I&#39;m paying for it now with the weight on my shoulders of being <i>forever</i> known here as an instigator of trouble.<br><br>And for all people who are like &#39;geez Aster, drama queen much, this will go away eventually, things turn over fast on the net,&#39; I reply that every keystroke here is permanent, archived, and ready to be flung in faces at any moment. Even ones that a stupider, less informed me made months ago.<br><br>And as for that overcoming problems thing... I suppose that my blame falls on that. I just remember being angry, frustrated, and scared that no matter what I said, I would get yelled at and then made to apologize when I felt others were in the wrong for flipping out. Suddenly everything turned into being able to defend myself and I got fed up and jaded... and NOTHING I could do seemed to be able to overcome the problem. Not even apologizing, at the urging of others. I soon began to feel that the apology was useless: merely an appeasement tool sort of like giving a dragon a maiden to make it stop burnininating the countryside.<br><br> I only escaped into #PPC2 once or twice, and both times were at the height of my frustration. I regret being so angry now...<br><br>and then I remember...how can I regret having an emotional reaction of despair and anger? Way to be angry at yourself for not being a robot. It&#39;s impossible not to feel bad when things get this way, or feel afraid. And as Yoda said in a terrible movie, &quot;Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, and hate leads to  <i>suffering</i>&quot;<br><br>The fact that The Phantom Menace was awful doesn&#39;t stop Yoda from being right. The IRC should not be a place where anybody should be afraid, because I think that fear led people to side against others (I sure did, and I regret it now) and siding against others made them angry, which caused more drama, which caused the afraid people to get more afraid... a serpent eating its tail until nothing&#39;s left but jaws. <br><br>And to end off... this is why I am now sure proper self moderation is the key. NONE of us should let this be a place to be afraid of or angry at. Time to work past all of this noise and try and MAKE the PPC IRC a better place... and it already is. It really already is. But it&#39;s up to us to keep it that way in the future. <br><br>*waves her Don&#39;t Be A Jerk flags she got/stole from Neshomeh*</p>

            <p>Honor is a wonderful thing, you see.  It can be lost, true, but it can also be gained.  Admitting when you are wrong is a major step down that road.<br><br>We have all done things that we regret, at one point or another.  The important thing to do in a case like that is to actively work for reconciliation.  Let people see that you have changed for the better and your reputation and honor can be rebuilt.  It will take time, but it will be worth it.  There is nothing quite so fulfilling as turning a tarnished reputation into an example.  &quot;I used to be an instigator of trouble, but I realized the error of my ways and now help to resolve conflicts in the community.&quot;<br><br>Also, you are not alone in this.  There are many of us who are now trying to rebuild our honor.  Some of us did not even realize we had lost it until very recently.  So, by working to make yourself a better person (as I believe every one of us should be doing at all times) you can inspire the rest of us to reclaim our honor, and be inspired by us in return.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>When did things get so complicated around here? When did it become a high school? When - and this one&#39;s not a rhetorical question - did the PPC community become more about people&#39;s grudges against each other and less about the fun of the PPC?<br><br>Frankly, I don&#39;t care about the details - I just want it to stop. Now. Looking at the main page, there is a disgraceful amount of hurt, angry, frustrated or whiny posts. <i>Where, exactly, is the spirit of the PPC?</i> <br><br>This is a mess. There are far too many bits and pieces to mediate and judge and otherwise deal with. Fair or not, I highly doubt that everyone&#39;s going to get the apologies, changes, or other results they feel they deserve, and trying to force it will only make things worse. We can&#39;t mend a thousand shards of shattered pottery. I say: Don&#39;t bother. Give it up, <i>let it go</i>, and start over. <br><br>Yes, I know that&#39;s hard. No, I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s the perfect moral or ethical solution. I just think it&#39;s practical. Wipe the slate clean, start some new discussions, make an effort to be friendly, and <i>don&#39;t bring up old problems next time there&#39;s a fight</i>. <br><br><br>That said, I agree with Calista that July can be very sensitive - July and I have talked about it before (and it was very civil, in case anyone was wondering) - and I&#39;ve seen that sensitivity escalate scuffles which would otherwise have been forgotten into fights in which feelings on both sides are genuinely hurt. This is not meant to lay all the blame on July - I think I&#39;m blaming everybody here, including her, to various degrees - but rather to say that I think people in general (in the whole world, frankly, not just our microcosm) just need to be more aware that not everyone&#39;s emotional sensitivity is the same and more careful overall.<br><br>I don&#39;t know most of the major players in this drama well enough to judge who was actually being mean and who just came off looking bad, but to the entire former category I say this: Stop it or get gone. I&#39;ve been in the PPC for years and I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before. If you&#39;re the cause, just go. Or change your ways.

You do take offense at the slightest provocation. We have to walk on eggs around you. That&#39;s sad, because honestly, we like you, and we like hanging around you; but even despite that, I&#39;m often afraid I&#39;ll say the wrong thing and you&#39;ll be hurt. When somebody really genuinely gets angry at you, it&#39;s even worse, because you seem to interpret it as not a normal spat between friends but some sort of vindictive attempt to destroy you.<br><br>That kind of thing can really be the catalyst to some pretty big explosions; and I think maybe you should figure out why you are reading insults into things where they don&#39;t exist, because that&#39;s what seems to be happening.<br><br>There; I&#39;ve probably offended some people with that. But I figured I had better tell the truth about what I perceive and what I see happening. Once again, like I said, we do like you--it&#39;s just this walking-on-eggs thing that needs to change.</p>

            <p>1) Yes, you are right, I do get easily offended at times. For that, I owe pretty much everyone an apology and I will be trying to tone and down and catch what I say before it comes out of my mouth in order to be less cantankerous and hot tempered.<br><br>2) There are certain items in here I do not agree with how they were put, but we&#39;ve already discussed it in private mostly and I&#39;m sure others will be able to notice those items and why they don&#39;t apply to what occurred to cause this thread.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know if I can phrase this so that it comes across the way I want it to, but I&#39;m going to try.<br><br>This post really blindsided me. Not just me, a lot of people from the chat. I was afraid to log in and find out what had happened now.<br><br><br>The chat has been peaceful lately. The few times I have heard someone say &#39;this is offending me&#39; and someone tried to continue it, the group leaned on the person and they quit. To me, this is the consequence system outlined earlier in the year working the way it should work. This is a large group. People naturally get touchy at times over topics that they are particularly sensitive to. The IRC moves very, very fast. This entire conversation wouldn&#39;t amount to maybe twenty minutes of IRC posts. When things move that fast it is very easy to get misunderstandings, say things that others take the wrong way, etc. It is easy to be typing up a response, hit enter to send and then realize that seven other posts have been made and now your&#39;s is out of context or is late and continuing something. I am not trying to justify meanness, but I really haven&#39;t seen any intentional meanness lately. I have seen the leaning system stop things before they blow up.<br><br>I haven&#39;t been on IRC quite as much the last few weeks since school started, but I did check with the regulars, and they confirmed that nothing major has happened. I&#39;m just not sure what bringing this up so forcefully, if it is indeed based mostly on what was happening a few months ago, really means. I suspect most, if not all, of the people involved in (or present for )making the IRC a drama filled pit of torture feel badly about it. The IRC has only recently begun to have the same kind of feel of comraderie that it had this time last year. Everyone has been tiptoeing around everyone else to the point that people have been afraid to have any discussions that don&#39;t somehow involve kittens for a long time.<br><br>Somehow, rightly or not, I seem to have become a person that people often ask to help resolve conflicts. I really do love the PPC--the fun, goof-off, impromptu role-play, Arrgggh! this fic annoys me!, lookit at what I wrote!, Please, tell me about your day--I actually want to know, grammar guru, story guiding, accepting or differences, fun (again for emphasis) place that it typically is. <br><br>If there is a major problem still brewing under the surface, I&#39;d really like to know. Before I can intelligently address this issue, whether on the Board or in my own mind, then I need more information. Generalizing is good for avoiding naming names, but I am confused on identifying the causes from the symptoms with this list.</p>

            <p>... is observer bias. People like kgarrett and myself don&#39;t visit the IRC - I personally have an active dislike of chatrooms, starting with the old Lounge - so what we know about it is what shows up on the Board. And as someone pointed out, that&#39;s the drama. It&#39;s a bit like if we looked at the fanfic that gets PPCed and said we should ban all fanfiction - after all, it&#39;s all rubbish, right?<br><br>Well, no. But we don&#39;t talk about the good stuff much in our missions. And we don&#39;t talk about the good stuff from the IRC on the Board.<br><br>I know someone&#39;s suggested letting the Board know when something particularly good&#39;s going on in the IRC - I happen to approve. The one time I /did/ spend a long time in the Lounge was <a href="http://alswaiter.net/LOTR/Things/">The LotR Roleplay</a> - which was awesome.<br><br>So what&#39;s awesome about the IRC nowadays, guys? We Boarders really need to hear it.<br><br>hS<br><br>(And since I have no way to get in touch with kg right now, I&#39;ll just say this - there are no serious proposals to close the IRC, and it isn&#39;t a suggestion by the PPC as a whole. I&#39;m sorry you were offended, I really am, but please don&#39;t peg the blame on the whole Board. ~hS)</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think the IRC is an integral part of the PPC right now. Right now, I think it&#39;s divisive. We&#39;ve got Boarders and IRCers, and only a few move regularly between both worlds. A lot of people in each group feel left out or just not part of the other, from what I recall of the last couple of conversations we&#39;ve had about it.<br><br>Now, the PPC got on just fine during the times we didn&#39;t have an IRC, so I hardly think not having one again would kill the group. The fun stuff that VM mentioned used to happen on the Board. I miss that. I&#39;d love that to come back here.<br><br>In the end, getting rid of the chat isn&#39;t the result I want, but the way I see it, if we can&#39;t lance the infection of disrespect in there, it&#39;s got to be cut out.<br><br>~Neshomeh, waving a &quot;Don&#39;t Be a Dick&quot; campaign banner.</p>

            <p>If no other way to resolve these problem can be found, it&#39;d be good to - at the very least - turn the IRC off for, say, a month or so, and get everyone in this community back in one place again. The Board has become quite empty lately and if all the fun has gone to the IRC... well, I&#39;d be missing out even if I wasn&#39;t absent half the time, and I imagine I&#39;m not the only one. It wouldn&#39;t necessarily have to be permanent, but I think a good few months of No IRC time would be good for us. <br><br>That said, I hope these problems can be ironed out without having to do such a thing.</p>

            <p>... if this were to happen, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to be around here anymore.<br><br>I know horrible things have happened in the IRC in the past, but I have seen the IRC as a place that finally made me feel welcome after so many years of being hurt. Without the IRC and any way to just talk to people like that, I would have probably never been able to gather enough courage to even post my Permission request, let alone written /anything/ without being horribly ashamed of myself.<br><br>It&#39;s because of the witty banter and the happy memories we all had on the IRC that people actually considered me a good enough person to think I could be a PG. If the IRC were gone, I&#39;d probably still be curled up somewhere in my shell and pitying myself.<br><br>So it&#39;s obvious that I would get offended and very hurt if the IRC was turned off, even for a month. This place means too much to me. And I have never even felt this kind of divide you people are talking about. We are all members of this initiative, for chrissake. I joined here with the feeling that we are more or less a huge family.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to end up leaving this place because all of this essentially pointless bickering rips open old wounds again. I have seen enough communities crumble. I don&#39;t want to see it happen to this place.<br><br>But I&#39;m just a newbie. I don&#39;t know if my rambling even means anything in this discussion.</p>

            <p>Without getting into my personal feelings on the &quot;drama,&quot; I don&#39;t see closing the IRC channel as being a good thing.

            <p>I sort of came late to the party, it seems. Despite being possibly the only person that spends approximately 99% of his time online in the IRC, since July left I&#39;ve only noticed maybe two spots of drama about two or three weeks after that, both related to the circumstances of her departure from the PPC, but after that? Nothing. Pretty much everyone gets along, and those that don&#39;t are at least civil, as far as I&#39;ve seen. For me, at least, the IRC has a sense of camaraderie that the Board doesn&#39;t.<br><br>I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that I&#39;m not entirely certain where this is coming from, unless it&#39;s referring to July leaving, which happened a while back, so if that&#39;s it I&#39;m sort of confused as to why it&#39;s coming up now.</p>

I was a massive A@@ Hole. <br><br>I no longer hold any resentment towards anyone in the PPC, all of the issues that I had have long since closed and gone. I can understand others, some in specific taking offense to things I said, and I can understand completely.  <br><br></p>

            <p>... I just read the logs from the second chatroom. I honestly did not remember saying anything quite that bad. I am really sorry for that. I don&#39;t have any lasting feelings of anger or resentment towards anyone in the PPC- what I said was incredibly stupid, poorly thought out, and downright cruel. It was the result of anger and frustration, not a legitimate grudge against anyone.<br><br>To those against whom I made disparaging remarks- I do not believe any of the crap I said back then anymore. Feeling persecuted (no matter how stupid those feelings may be) makes me angry. Really, really, angry. Angry enough to feel justified in whatever insults I level against such &quot;evil&quot; people. Obviously, I was not in the right. I will not try to argue that I was. </p>

            <p>It&#39;s mostly why I was a bit alarmed. And I do frequent the PPC, and I do think that yeah, a lot of drama there can stand to be cleaned up. But I think it&#39;s also a lot more complicated than &#39;there are people being cruel on the IRC.&#39;<br><br>As somebody who was there, I feel that it&#39;s sort of a great trainwreck of &#39;people not leaving certain things at the door of the IRC.&#39; Myself included, before I wised up somewhat. But overall, I think it would be easier to say &#39;Everybody, please leave stuff at the door&#39; than &#39;please do not say anything that could ever possibly offend anybody, ever.&#39; Because I feel that&#39;s a bit of a step backward and getting LESS tolerant and comfortable rather than more.<br><br>That&#39;s really what I think what&#39;s going on- that some people feel as if they aren&#39;t safe to talk about what they want on the IRC, or feel disrespected/otherwise afraid or unappreciated and that kind of environment bleeds through into all sorts of other things. Like hair-trigger argument thresh-holds and general looming clouds of unease...<br><br>... those are my two cents, anyway. I know that various dramas have happened, there, but I think that the best way for everybody to approach the problem is with more toleration of each other overall... not <i>less</i>. It doesn&#39;t mean laying down and letting someone curse you out... because that&#39;s not just what&#39;s happening over there. Just a general environment that facilitates a climate of general unease and chaos.<br><br>TL;DR-- everybody feels horrible when somebody disagrees with them, but the climate over there may be turning disagreements into arguments, arguments into feuds, and feuds into lingering animosity which comes with lies and nasty stuff like hS pretty much has said already... so simply not getting upset when someone doesn&#39;t share opinions I think is the only remedy... nipping it in the bud, as it were.</p>

            <p>Like, the IRC is where I come to get AWAY from most of my problems. Most arguments I have found happen (not really just here, but most places on the internet) is because somebody has a bad day and instead of relaxing, is easily aggro&#39;d by the first thing somebody says that they have mixed feelings about and it devolves into a kind of venting of frustrations into the internet. that hurts everybody.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t really happen so much anymore, but it could easily happen again if we make the IRC a place to be angry in instead of a place to let go of problems in.<br><br>The PPC&#39;s about having fun and stuff, and nobody I know on the IRC actually takes pleasure in being nasty.

            <p>It takes two to tango. Horrible flame wars and dramas require somebody to say something and somebody else to respond... so the best thing to me would just to be promote levity, tolerance, and open-ness on the IRC. You can&#39;t stop people from saying something potentially offensive (everything is offensive, to somebody...) but you CAN promote an environment where people get less offended by stuff.<br><br>And that first seed of conflict has, in the past, bred situations where people have felt the IRC was against them, bred drama, bred all sorts of bad things. So perhaps the best thing is to not foster that stuff getting so far in the first place.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s what this post is about. Fixing the problem. hS did not go &quot;Everyone apologize to everyone, then we&#39;ll be fine,&quot; that would be stupid. I think the point of his post was &quot;If you look at the Constitution, the rules mostly seem to point to being respectful of each other and everyone&#39;s opinions, whether having Serious Discussions, silly banter, or discussing the best way to go after a badfic.&quot;<br><br>I think the problem - people being bullied and people being disrespectful and one person actually leaving over this - can best be solved by more respect and consideration of each other, as humans and fellow PPCers. And I think that going into this with the overwhelming cloud of &quot;But what if someone says something mean that they didn&#39;t intend? Then things start up <i>all over again</i>!&quot; is a bad idea. Because, first off, we&#39;re trying to start off on a new foot, and you&#39;re assuming that it&#39;s going to go wrong.<br><br>And second, as hS said above, an apology doesn&#39;t actually harm you, so what&#39;s the problem? It&#39;s not like anyone&#39;s asking chatters to go around bowing and begging pardon every time they say something controversial. The way I see it, this might on a bad day look like this:<br><br><i>&quot;I have this controversial opinion, because of reasons X, Y, and Z.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Really? I disagree, strongly, because of reasons A, B, and C, and furthermore I think that opinion is overall harmful and missing the point.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That was kind of mean of you. Can you explain reason B more, not put me down for my opinions?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah, sorry. You&#39;re right, I didn&#39;t mean to get snappy.

Can you explain reason B more, not put me down for my opinions?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What? I wasn&#39;t being mean. I was just stating a fact.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, but what you said offended me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But it was just a statement! I wasn&#39;t being offensive!&quot;</i><br><br>Things escalate, people get angrier, other chatters take sides, and it eventually either explodes, or continues until someone defuses the situation with kittens. This is problematic. Not everything can be solved with kittens, we need to be more respectful of each other if we are going to make this thing work. Basically? <i>Intent Is Not Magic</i>. It doesn&#39;t matter if you didn&#39;t think your statement or argument or joke was going to offend someone - if it did, you should apologize to them. Think about it in IRL terms. You&#39;re sitting around in an empty classroom after school, or between lunch waves, or whatever, talking about science or politics, and someone says &quot;God, I mean, seriously! Whoever is still opposed to nuclear power is off their rocker.&quot; And then someone else speaks up &quot;Actually, I believe nuclear power is unnatural and the risks far outweigh the benefits. Do you think I&#39;m off my rocker?&quot;<br><br>The correct answer is no, and you&#39;re sorry for putting it like that, followed by a more civil and logical argument for nuclear power. And, in return, the person does not get to go &quot;That idiot actually thinks we need <i>less</i> green power, what has she been smoking?&quot;<br><br>Respect is a good thing. When you have stepped on someone&#39;s toes, you apologize for it, they accept your apology, and that does not mean the debate or discussion or argument comes to a full stop, it just continues more civilly. I don&#39;t see a problem with this.</p>

            <p>Part of that is realizing when you&#39;re wrong and apologizing for it, though. It&#39;s kind of the opposite of sacrificing your voice.

There&#39;s cannibalism, killing of minor, supporting, AND unnamed background characters for no good reason, the complete and UTTER replacement of Pinkie Pie, and on top of all that there&#39;s an uncensored version I CAN&#39;T find which, according to reliable hearsay, had sexual torture in it as well. AND, it uses &quot;anybody&quot;. The in-canon term is &quot;anypony&quot;.<br><br>It reminds me, honestly, of Agony in Pink. And when that&#39;s the FIRST story that springs to mind as a comparison...<br><br><br>Anyway. I&#39;d like to nominate this thing for Legendary Badfic status. It is utterly notorious in the MLP:FiM community, at least, and beyond that has spawned a long sequence of copycat and imitator fics which have continued to be bad and gruesome for gruesome&#39;s sake. Failing that, would at least like to reserve it for a teamup mission with a partner yet-to-be-announced. I could probably handle it on my own but Lord knows I don&#39;t wanna.</p>

            <p>Comparing a new Legendary Badfic to arguably the worst Legendary Badfic of them all (or at least tied for the worst) is probably too high a standard. What about comparing it to legolas by laura or My Immortal? By that standard, it fits into the Legendary category very easily.</p>

            <p>Yes, but you released them yourself and credited them for the editing. These are the editors releasing it themselves and crediting the original author, which implies (and I would be willing to bet money on it) that the original author was not involved in the editing.</p>

            <p>How can you be sure that really is the case? That might be the most likely assumption, but there could be a chance that the original author did indeed authorize those editors through emails or whatever.<br><br>Even discounting that, we should be focusing on the version that has been read the most. If we pick a version that the majority of the community is unfamiliar with, we might get called on the carpet by them if a Cupcakes-centered mission gets published. They might perceive our picking a lousier but less read version as something of a d*ck move.</p>

            <p>Also one impossible to determine. As of RIGHT NOW, the older Gdoc has 50 viewers, the newer one 46. That could change at any time, of course. I can&#39;t read views on either one, as I don&#39;t own either one.<br><br>Additionally, as the story has so many variant endings--the edited version lops off the ending in the older document, and the source I obtained the older one contains fifteen variant endings besides--I&#39;m inclined to default to the older one when the most familiar one cannot be ascertained. I remain fairly confident the story will be the same in the majority, aside from those endings which make it out to be &quot;all a dream&quot; or such.</p>

            <p>Well, Cupcakes is pretty bad, but it never seemed like it was really legendarily bad.

            <p>For my part, I&#39;ve never seen it portrayed positively until I came back here and asked around about running it for a mission.

            <p>See, a recent Fanficrants entry was about someone&#39;s horrifically bad attempt at writing a character with autism. I claimed I could do better, and now I have the urge to actually try to do better. I don&#39;t want to make an OC for this, but I don&#39;t really know of any characters who could be convincingly written as being on the spectrum. I considered Captain Carrot, what with his photographic memory and literal-minded behaviour, but he&#39;s too ... &quot;socially competent&quot; is the only phrase which comes to mind, and nobody&#39;s sure if the literal-mindedness is a put-on with him anyway.

            <p>Zach and Dr. Brennan from &quot;Bones&quot; are both Aspies, though only Zach actually has the diagnosis. There&#39;s been lots of talk (by the actors) about Dr. Brennan and how she would be diagnosed if the producers let her be--only they don&#39;t want to write a show that&#39;s about autism. (Somehow, if the main character has that diagnosis, then it&#39;s automatically a show about autism. Color me puzzled.) I&#39;ve heard that Sheldon from &quot;Big Bang Theory&quot; is autistic, but I haven&#39;t seen that show.<br><br>There are a few books that specifically have an autistic character. &quot;The Speed of Dark&quot; is a near-future sci-fi book with an autistic main character; &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; has a main character who&#39;s got Asperger&#39;s (but a pretty stereotypical case). Neither one is half-bad (though &quot;The Speed of Dark&quot; will really depress you). <br><br>Dean Koontz&#39;s &quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot; has an autistic character in it; like the other two main characters, the guy ends up with superpowers. The author handles it in a generally indifferent way, though Koontz has a bad habit of turning his disabled characters &quot;inspirational&quot; through the assumption that disability=bad.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the bad stuff. &quot;The Secret of Susan&quot;, from Baby-Sitters Club, has an autistic savant character who is pretty badly miswritten until she goes to an institution because that&#39;s somehow better for her. And Diane Duane&#39;s &quot;A Wizard Alone&quot; has a supposedly autistic Darryl McAllister, but the actual disorder is really more of a dissociative disorder, having little in common with autism; and the magic cure doesn&#39;t help. Makes me sad, because she usually does her research really well.</p>

            <p>...that Parker from the tv series <i>Leverage</i> has at least a mild form of autism, and I know that there&#39;s at least one possibly autistic person on the show <i>Alphas</i>.

            <p>Can I have a link, please? What fandom was it in? Might be interesting.<br><br>Anyway, I don&#39;t really know. I know there are some canons that have definite mental disability.<br><br>If you need something to work with, I suggest you start with a Bioware continuum, because they both do a great job of writing disabled characters. I mean, there&#39;s Sandal from Dragon Age, who is really charming in his own way while being massively disabled, and then there&#39;s also David Archer from Mass Effect 2&#39;s Overlord DLC, a savant who... let&#39;s just say that the end of the DLC is really sad because he&#39;s involved in something. Oh, and the ME continuum also has Gillian Grayson, though she only appears in the novels for some reason.</p>

            <p>Hi there. I&#39;ve been lurking for a few months and posting once in a while, and I am now requesting permission to begin sporking things.<br><br>My two agents are Ray Chell and Connor. I wish to place them in the Department of Mary Sues.<br><br>Ray Chell is a human female and escaped author avatar of about twenty years of age. She has some experience observing Sues from a safe distance but has never engaged a Sue before, preferring to quietly pass her reports along to other agents instead.<br><br>Connor is an impulsive human male who might be anywhere from eighteen to twenty-two, give or take a year; his foster family wasn&#39;t sure of his age, and he doesn&#39;t know it either. He displays wolfish mannerisms, but has learned to repress many of them and behave like a normal human when he can help it. Unfortunately, his desire to take down his enemy on sight often gets the better of him.<br><br>I have a sample of writing to show.<br><br><a href="http://sapphire-warg.deviantart.com/art/The-Worst-Passenger-164441408">The Worst Passenger</a>: A short Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks AU in which Link finds Ganondorf washed up on a beach and, with no idea who the man is, decides to take him as a passenger in his train. The story is told through letters he sends to Zelda.<br><br>The badfic I wish to kill is here: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6858954/1/Bloody_Tears"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6858954/1/Bloody_Tears">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6858954/1/Bloody_Tears</a></a><br><br>This particular badfic involves a girl who gets summoned from her college to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Link, who is normally capable of protecting himself and breaking out of jail quickly, gets captured easily and locked in a fortress so that the Goddesses have a reason to summon the young woman for help. It is then established that the girl is &quot;a reaper...a God of Death&quot; who even appears in Hyrulean mythology. And she can summon a scythe called Bloody Tears, which is a weapon and an extension of her soul, which means it is also her. After Link is rescued, he drops his mission to defeat Ganondorf in favor of escorting the girl around Hyrule.</p>

            <p>I like the idea of telling a story in letter format. Have been toying with that idea myself.<br><br>I&#39;m not familiar with the fandom and I guess familiarity would help me to place the letters in context. Now it seems all rather disconnected. The main thing that bothers me is that there&#39;s no introduction. No &quot;hey Zelda, how&#39;ve you been? Well, they week I&#39;ve had...&quot; One letter even starts with &quot;He made a huge sword&quot; and my first question was &quot;he who?&quot; Would Zelda have been reading these letters with such close attention that she would immediately know which he was meant? Would Link assume Zelda would read his letters with such close attention?<br><br>Other than that, I think this writing sample looks good (though an ellipses is never followed by a full stop), so good luck on getting permission.</p>

            <p>Thanks for reviewing. :)<br><br>This was a short writing exercise I gave myself last year. What I particularly liked about it was trying to get into the head of the character, who in this case is a twelve-year-old kid. I&#39;ve been thinking about trying something like this with other characters in the near future.<br><br>A lack of familiarity can be a barrier, but that can be hard to avoid when writing fanfic.<br><br>This might be a disadvantage of using a letter format to tell a story; Link is honest, but his lack of knowledge combined with the story format make him a bit of an unreliable narrator to anyone who hasn&#39;t played <i>The Wind Waker</i> or <i>Spirit Tracks</i>.<br><br>That said, now that you mention it, Link&#39;s fifth letter does seem a bit unclear in the beginning. I should probably go back and edit that soon. :o</p>

            <p>I have been thinking, and I know others are with me on this, that we need a few more PGs.  The ones we have at the moment have either disappeared or have been consumed by Real Life.

            <p>Everything I have to say on the matter has probably already been said, but here goes.<br><br>I was surprised to see FlareShard nominated so quickly - she only got permission two days ago - but, thinking about it, I think she&#39;d be great for the job.  She&#39;s clearly a good writer and able to tell good writing from bad, and she&#39;s quite active in the community, and always keeps in the spirit of the PPC.  She&#39;d have my vote.</p>

            <p>Firstly, second for Tranum and Flareshard. They are both steady in chat and good writers. They both also get the spirit of the PPC.<br><br>I&#39;d also like to nominate Callista. She has done a lot of work on the wiki in the past. While she has had reservations about getting started writing missions, I believe she does get the spirit of the PPC and she has excellent grammar and writing skills.<br><br>For Maslab, he has had a tendency to have bad timing on occasion, that much is true. He does have long experience with moderating a rather fractious video game group, though. He knows the IRC commands inside and out and has been very steady in enforcing the few consequences that our group has in IRC. He is also a daily fixture in IRC, and has been for a very long time, which says that he should continue to be a fixture if he is made a PG. For the I&#39;d be able to vote for him.<br><br>For Joe, I am not sure I could second him. He has not been around much, and that is part of why we are wanting to nominate new PGs, so at the basic level it doesn&#39;t make much sense to vote in someone who already is not around much.<br><br>I am really surprised and flattered by the number of people willing to nominate me. I&#39;m not sure I have as much confidence in me as everyone else seems to have, but I will accept the nomination and will do my best by the community. I really love the PPC, and want it to continue on.</p>

I appreciate it and it makes me happy.<br><br>However, you&#39;re right when you say that I haven&#39;t started writing missions yet; and I think to be a good PG, I would have to have a few under my belt, because in order to know what makes a good agent I&#39;d need to have some experience using agents with various traits in missions.<br><br>When I do have some missions done, go ahead and re-nominate me the next time the question comes up; but for now--I&#39;m just not experienced enough.

            <p>First things first. I second Tranum&#39;s nomination. He&#39;s done some good work and he&#39;s got a good grip on how the community works.<br><br>Now for the big rant. For some reason I can&#39;t really put my finger on, this whole PG selection process has got my dander up. I don&#39;t want the PPC to become a source of frustration for me, so I&#39;m gonna vent a little bit. Sorry. <br><br>The following is what I&#39;m looking for in a Permission Giver:<br><br><b>Demonstrated Presence on Both the Board and IRC</b><br>A Permission Giver that only shows up in the IRC is useless. The opposite - a Boarder who never sets foot in the IRC - is also true. Good PGs should not only be able to fuction in both settings, they should be a regular presence.<br><br><b>Substantive Constructive Criticism</b><br>Permission Givers must be harsh but fair judges of writing. There are too many one-line &#39;That was hilarious!&#39; reviews in the PPC. I know, I&#39;ve fallen into that trap before. One of the goals of Permission Givers, as the top dogs of our little internet kennel, should be to guide, promote, and improve the works of their peers. They probably should be beta readers, too.<br><br><b>Community Experience</b><br>The PPC is its own universe, with its own rules and quirks. I want a Permission Giver who knows those quirks first hand, who has a few missions under her or his belt already. I want to see that they know how to write a good mission.<br><br>I hope that didn&#39;t come off as too much. Just felt like I needed to get that out there for some outside consideration.</p>

            <p>Honestly, I tried being part of the IRC way back when, but but my time zone means that it&#39;s very hard for me to be there at times that most of you are. In the end, it just wouldn&#39;t be possible even if Real Life wasn&#39;t eating me alive, and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s true for a lot of other PGs. That said, I avoid making the final call on a Permission request from someone who has been active almost only on the IRC. I think that&#39;s fair. </p>

            <p>I think you are right about the need for community experience, PC.  However, I think you are coming at it from the wrong end.  I believe it is far more important for them to have read and have a knowledge of the PPC canon and spin-offs than to have written any of it.</p>

            <p>I see it as the difference between studying a video game on its associated wikia site or TV Tropes page verses actually playing it for yourself. You can get a great grasp of the material that way, no doubt about that, but it isn&#39;t the same experience as if you sat down and played it. Or wrote it, going back to the PPC as an example.</p>

            <p>I think it is the difference between playing a video game and creating a video game, actually.  Since one is experiencing what another has created, versus creating something yourself.  I have never created a video game, but I know a good one from a bad one, when I play them.<br><br>A Permission Giver needs to be able to distinguish good writing from bad, but you don&#39;t have to be a writer to do that.  The Permission Giving process has little to do with their abilities as writers, but everything to do with them reading.</p>

I am simply too new here, and I have still a lot to learn - especially considering the emotional baggage mentioned in my previous post. It&#39;s just that I don&#39;t feel worthy of this position yet, and I wish to prove to people that I can be a good PG... in the future. <br><br>Right now, I&#39;m just too much of a new kid, and although I feel very honored that not only one, but two established PGs trust me enough to actually consider me good enough to be a PG, I do have to consider the opinions of the other Boarders, and those have more importance right now. I want to be a PG the people deserve, not a PG because of some popularity nominations - and by that, I don&#39;t want to be rude to the people who nominated me, but I feel the same as the people who think that simple enthusiasm and zeal do not make up for a lack of experience.<br><br>I want to express my gratitude for everyone who believed in me, and I hope that by the time the next PG elections come around, I will be ready - and worthy - to be the Permission Giver this community deserves.<br><br>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I assume that WarriorJoe is the same person as Joe in the Chat.  That would make sense but, if that is not the case, then someone should correct me and I will correct my mistake immediately.<br><br>My concern comes from a conversation that I witnessed in the chat recently.  It was a discussion of fanfiction in the MLP:FiM continuum, and specifically fics like &quot;Cupcakes&quot; that go against the established mood of the canon.  Joe said that he does not like anything that goes against the mood of a canon and that anything that did was badfic.  Other people in the chat at the time explained their points of view about how a story can run counter to the established mood and still be good fic.  However, Joe&#39;s mind seemed to be made up, and that was that.<br><br>The concern that I have is this: What happens if someone asks permission and their request contains material that Joe doesn&#39;t like?  Will it be an automatic &#39;no&#39; because anything that he doesn&#39;t like is bad?  It all comes down to <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/YKINMK">Your Kink Is Not My Kink</a>, which is a very important concept in the PPC.  Not liking something doesn&#39;t make it bad.<br><br>So, that is my concern.  And I feel like a complete jerk for doing this on a second nomination.  I honestly have nothing against Maslab or Joe as people, and I apologize if they were offended by anything I said, though I still think it needed to be said.</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t feel like a jerk for voicing concerns. The last thing we want is to vote in someone who&#39;s not right for the community. I would second the concerns about Maslab, he does have a tendency to start and be involved in drama. My concern for Joe is more on the basis that, for one, he&#39;s not very active on the &#39;Board, and two, he feels we as a community need more infrastructure/rules/ways to punish or deal with people who break rules. And I&#39;m not really comfortable nominating him without first knowing that the community on the whole also feels that way.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I&#39;m the same person.<br><br><br>With regard to that--I have a number of gripes with Cupcakes that extend beyond it just being dark. For instance, it stretches the character of Pinkie Pie much, much too far for belief (and there was consensus on that, unless I remember incorrectly), and doesn&#39;t really do any favors to Rainbow Dash either. Furthermore, it uses &quot;insanity = violence&quot;, which is a TERRIBLE (if terribly common) thing to do.<br><br>Contentwise, it actually reminds me of Agony in Pink. And if that&#39;s the first fic that I make an association with, then there is something VERY wrong.<br><br>Those are my COLLECTED arguments with regard to that particular story, and I&#39;d like to apologize for the others. When I&#39;m in IRC or any other kind of instant-communications chat my mouth sometimes moves faster than my brain can put the arguments together for it.<br><br><br>As for the infrastructure thing, I&#39;m not going to deny it. I do believe that lack of infrastructure has gotten us into trouble in the past and has the potential to get us into trouble in the future. But I&#39;m not going to try to FORCE a structure onto the PPC, because that would solve no problems and only create new ones.<br><br>As for the Board activity, all I can say is &quot;I&#39;ve been busy.&quot; I&#39;m honestly surprised anyone remembers who I am let alone is willing to nominate me (though I&#39;m certainly honored). But I&#39;m not as busy now as I was, and I can always find the time.</p>

            <p>My reasoning, since Flare just got Permission herself and is newer than PGs typically are: Well, that. A lot of PGs have faded away, and I&#39;m hoping some fresher blood will last longer. ... God, that sounded creepy. But, yeah. We need some life in the ranks, and Flare is REALLY excited about being part of the community and having Permission. I think she gets what the community is about, and will keep it up for members present and future.<br><br>I like Miah for PG because she&#39;s active both on the Board and the IRC, she&#39;s been around a while, and she&#39;s a mom, which gives her a great skill set.<br><br>NOTE: Nominees have to accept their nomination before they can be voted in, so everyone knows.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So, I have been reading other PPC character profiles and it got me thinking a bit.<br><br>For my first agent, I will be intending to use a doppelanger of myself just to get the feel of the PPC and in order to allow me to relate to my character better (WITHOUT resorting to the dreaded Mary-Sue virus).<br><br>However, for a possible second character, my concern is relating to the underpinning law within PPC conduct: the Law of Narrative Comedy. Granted, a lot of outside events could make up for this, but, as a generally serious essay/fiction writer, I find it extremely difficult to incoperate comedy within characterisation without it being inneffective.<br><br>Coumpounding the matter is my general fandoms of interest run something on the lines of:<br><br>- Mass Effect Trilogy (any Mary Sue who gets within 5 meters of Liara T&#39;Soni is in trouble!)<br><br>- Lord of the Rings<br>- Warhammer 40,000<br>- Deus Ex (recent)<br>- Killzone series<br>- Dragon Age series<br>- Star Wars universe (general knowledge)<br>- Tom Clancy fiction and spin-offs (general knowledge)<br><br>Yeah, you get the idea - I&#39;m kinda a sucker for combat. It could work if the character in question was involved in the DMS, but -<br><br>Getting to the point: how can I include a &quot;serious universe&quot; character and sucessfully incorperate him/her within the PPC continum without disrupting the Law of Narrative Comedy?<br><br>&quot;Someone? Anyone! Please, respond!&quot; - GSGT Pete Stacker, Halo 3</p>

            <p>I have an agent who can shapeshift into anything and probably is a demigod from original fiction... I know your problem.<br><br>The big thing to me is that powerful people are people too. And people make mistakes. Or are tripped up by outside forces. There&#39;s no such thing as a serious character, really. Circumstance can make anything funny.<br><br>Lore is a somewhat serious character, but one of his greatest flaws is that he prefers to stay in a more bestial, animal form... without thumbs. Whenever anything needs thumbs, hilarity ensues.<br><br>Eventually, I hope to get an ESAS team going consisting of a DBZ Sayian, a Dragon age Mage, and a My Little Pony (g4) unicorn. YES they all have various powers, and two of them are from somewhat serious setting (OK, DBZ isn&#39;t serious ALL the time...) but that&#39;s the beauty of it. It&#39;s more about putting a typically boy-targeted character and a grimdark-setting-character next to a character with a light and soft series... The potential for funny arguments is boundless.<br><br>Personally, I find &#39;serious-type character faced with absolutely ridiculous stuff&#39; to be one of the funniest things the PPC has to offer.</p>

            <p>Basically, I think it boils down to not being afraid to let your characters look silly sometimes. It sort of goes along with not being Sues. They can be serious, talented, badass, whateverâ€”but the Narrative Laws are there to make them fall on their butts once in a while, and so they should, because they&#39;re not perfect. There are some situations that demand <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/sudiolond/mission04.html">a pie in the face</a>, for instance, even if the recipient is a member of the proud and ancient race of the Noldor.<br><br>I struggle with this myself, but my strategy has basically been &quot;straight man and fall guy&quot; partnerships. With Nume and Ilraen, we&#39;ve got Nume as the straight-laced veteran agent and Ilraen the bumbling newbieâ€”and yet, the joke is very often on Nume, since his seriousness sets him up to go down <i>hard</i> when he does take a fall, and Ilraen gets more savvy every mission, enough to be the <i>cause</i> of humor rather than the <i>victim</i> of it every once in a while. That&#39;s the idea, anyway. I don&#39;t know how well I pull any of it off.<br><br>Derik&#39;s partner has been a kender. Enough said on that score. In his case, though, I&#39;m trying more to play up his mood swings and general unpredictability for laughs.<br><br>A lot of the humor of a PPC mission comes from the badfic, though. The thing is, bad writing is funny. Typos and the effects of clumsy wording and bad logicâ€”the real effects, the ones the writers miss by not checking their workâ€”can be hilarious. One of my favorites right now is Gandalf&#39;s &quot;Very relieved am I to know you are very much undead mellon-nin,&quot; from &quot;<a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999/05rc.html">Ring Child</a>.&quot; That mission was full of stuff like that. Made our job . . . not easier, really, but definitely worthwhile. *g*<br><br>I still struggle with spending too much time in my characters&#39; heads, though. What I like about writing is getting in there and working out what makes them tick, which isn&#39;t necessarily interesting to anyone else. *shrug*<br><br>Anyway, I don&#39;t know how helpful that is, but at the very least you&#39;re not alone in tending to a serious writing voice. One good thing to keep in mind is a piece of advice Phobos and I got at our wedding: &quot;Nothing is ever as serious as you think it is.&quot;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The Law of Narrative Comedy is not meant as a &quot;real&quot; law - it&#39;s more like a guideline in the sense of &quot;don&#39;t take this stuff too seriously, write your missions and have fun doing so,&quot; and there&#39;s nothing worse than forced comedy for the sake of comedy, mind you.<br><br>So if you&#39;re feeling uncomfortable with making a serious character funny, just write them as serious. The fun will pretty much automatically come from putting this serious character into absurd situations they are not used to (i.e. missions), and playing out how this character would react to this nonsense.<br><br>And maybe you would like to do co-writes with other Boarders - most of the time, even the most serious character will be funny when partnered up with a total klutz.<br><br>And keep reciting the MST3k mantra: it&#39;s just a show, you should really just relax!</p>

            <p>People have been known to complain about our emphasis on spelling and grammar. While Muphry&#39;s Law is in effect, and we&#39;re definitely not perfect ourselves, proofreading and proper spellchecking are important for a reason . . . namely, to prevent stuff like this:<br><br><a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/09/15/typo-in-romantic-novel-causes-bowel-movement-during-love-scene.html?dlvrit=36761">Typo in romantic novel causes bowel movement during love scene.</a><br><blockquote>

<br>Yes, ladies and gentlemen of the PPC, the errors are out there and they&#39;re real. The next time someone complains about nitpicking things like typos, point them to the ebook version of Susan Andersen&#39;s <i>Baby, I&#39;m Yours</i> and watch the light dawn.<br><br>How about you guys?

            <p>Small words are just as easily to misspell as larger words. Easier even, I would say, because with the longer words you&#39;re probably paying more attention to what your fingers are typing.<br><br>But long words cause trouble to. Yesterday I was checking out some vacancies posted in the window of a temping agency. One of the headlines asked for people who had graduated to a bachelor degree. But rather than say graduated, the headline said something that meant &quot;kicked off&quot;. I think who ever messed that up was aided by spell check, as in Dutch, the two words are rather different, but close enough the same that spell check would guess the one if you were trying to go for the other.</p>

            <p>Well, not typos to that magnitude, but I did once read a novel where a large chunk of time was jumped a few times, and the author must have missassessed how much. The narrator of the story was referring to his wife, son and baby of unknown gender, but the wife had gotten pregnant about 12 months earlier. Most parents know the gender of the baby by then.<br><br>In another novel there was a power cut and the character managed to reach her power company and scream at them about how much money&#39;s worth of meat she had in the freezer. The telephone operator replied to her she should check the company&#39;s website for compensation.<br><br>This is wrong for two reasons: 1) customer service of power companies aren&#39;t open at all hours. She could not have reached one at the time she was calling. 2) in the Netherlands there is a standard compensation for consumers in case of a power cut. Customer service would have told her about the standard compensation and that it is automatically deducted from her next bill.<br><br>And there are typos, of course, there are always typos.<br><br>So, yes, I do believe we should be hired for editing work (or at least I should be).<br><br>I have started marking out the errors I come across in novels and books. Not sure yet what to do with them. I don&#39;t know how well publishers will take it if you sent them a query mentioning a few of the spots one of their current editors has missed.</p>

            <p>There are more than typos in those. Halo: the Flood is the dubious origin of a magical double sex change over the course of a paragraph and Marines managing to shoot Jackals in the head after the Master Chief knocked them to the bottom of a cliff in the previous sentence. On the other hand, it had Yayap.</p>

            <p>My grandmother was legally blind for the final few years of her life.  In bright light, she could usually make out the color red.

            <p>I think you&#39;re dealing with somebody who doesn&#39;t like you, personally. This &quot;Brihana&quot;, whoever s/he is, seems to think you have a track record of hating women, or trolling, or something. Who knows?<br><br>Your being annoyed at that fic is a legit complaint. Why in the world would a sex change affect your mental functioning? I guess maybe you could get side effects from the hormone treatments before your body could get used to them, but that&#39;s drug side effects, not a gender thing.<br><br>Re. male and female intelligence: You are right in that the average values are the same. However, males and females have very slightly different specialties (on the order of a percentage point or less)--which means very little for any particular man or woman, because the difference between genders totally vanishes compared to the difference between individuals.<br><br>Also, males tend to have a slightly larger standard deviation in their distribution--that is, they have more scores at the high and low extremes of the range. I think that&#39;s because men (usually) have XY chromosomes, which means that anything on their single X will express fully because there&#39;s not another X to provide another gene that can partly/fully cancel it. As a result, we end up with slightly more gifted and more cognitively disabled males than females--though not by much. But anyone who&#39;s XY will get that effect, whether they&#39;re male or female.<br><br>I betcha the person who&#39;s harassing you knows you write for the PPC. That&#39;s what happened to me a while ago on ffr, when I used my PPC LJ account to complain about OOC characters in bad slash and everybody apparently figured that made me a homophobe... somehow.</p>

            <p>... which make sense to me but horribly offend others. Specifically, several months back I invoked a flamewar by saying I didn&#39;t see how writing a male OC was inherently offensive to women, and more recently got into an argument in which I said hitting women isn&#39;t inherently that much worse than hitting men and didn&#39;t appropriately phrase the part in which I was trying to say &quot;because hitting ANYONE AT ALL is wrong&quot;.<br><br>Not to mention she&#39;s now screaming that I missed the much more offensive stuff later in the fic. Wow, sorry that I do not, unless I&#39;m specifically trying to spork it, pick out every little bit to be offended by in a fic. Particularly one with formatting which made it hard to tell what was going on at all. And the character in question displays some stereotypically girly behaviour when he&#39;s a guy, so I&#39;d have to read carefully to see which was just him being him/herself and which was meant to be due to the change.</p>

            <p>I can sort of see the point, but there&#39;s a pretty thick line between standing up for womens&#39; rights and being an ass, and IMO part of getting womens&#39; rights to be taken seriously involves <i>not</i> being an ass.</p>

            <p>That... was really terrible. Sporking was definitely warranted.<br><br>The good news is, it was funny, and I&#39;d definitely read more of these if you write them. The bad news is that I think you&#39;re going overboard on the author-bashing. You can say the <i>writing</i> is idiotic all you want, and by all means call out the narrative voice, but if we insult the author, a human being, it makes us look like bullying jackasses, and we&#39;re not. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh, who is still tempted occasionally, but finds that substituting &quot;narrator&quot; or &quot;narrative&quot; for &quot;author&quot; works like a charm and is, in fact, more to the pointâ€”writing talent does not necessarily correlate with overall intelligence.</p>

(And one part in particular is... well... laughable at best.)<br><br>My favorite part though is when one of the Book People introduces himself as &quot;The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury&quot;, a nice nod to the original author.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t have Permission yet, but I have a few questions about how some things get sporked.<br><br>1. I&#39;ve been looking around The Pit, and I&#39;ve seen several stories that say in the Author&#39;s Notes or even the summary, &quot;Yes, this is a Mary-Sue.&quot;  Some seemed concerned about this; most don&#39;t.  What do you do about those?<br><br>2. And then there are a few fics like this Doctor Who one - <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7353177/1/Doctor_who_girls"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7353177/1/Doctor_who_girls">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7353177/1/Doctor_who_girls</a></a> - that don&#39;t have any Mary-Sues (unless you count the Silurians with the stupid names), no Bad Slash, no Implausible Crossovers, nothing specific the PPC covers, really, but has <i>excruciating</i> SPaG, eye-searing format, OOCness all over the place, and is just pure unadulterated idiocy.  How do you spork those kind of things?<br><br>3. And then there&#39;s Hans von Hozel <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1730364/Hans_von_Hozel"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1730364/Hans_von_Hozel">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1730364/Hans_von_Hozel</a></a>.  He&#39;s... internet-famous enough to have his own TVtropes page, if that means anything.  But he&#39;s special in the badfic community in that he has a fic for just about every fandom you can think of, whether he actually knows what he&#39;s talking about or not (one summary, I quote: &quot;Someone make email and say &#39;I have request for Warhammer story&#39;, only I no know what Warhammer is! Oh no! Anyway here is story&quot;.  The thing is, each one is about 200 words long - far too short to spork - but there are so <i>many</i> of them, all in the same style (and then there are his RPFs about ABBA and The Beatles)...  I was wondering what, if anything, the PPC does in this situation.</p>

            <p>Because if this guy were really German, he would fail in his native language as well. <br><br>And seeing as he uses the word &quot;danube&quot; as a verb so much it essentially has become a catchphrase in his fics, I think he is aware of how horribly his stuff is written, and his incompetence seems more like a parody of badly written fanfiction than anything else, like Squirrelking.</p>

            <p>1) If they seem concerned that their story contains a Mary Sue, then perhaps they are open to some con-crit.  Leave a review of the story where you tell them what they are doing right, and what needs work.<br><br>2) The Department of Technical Errors is an overlooked group, but they exist for fics like the one you describe.  Check out the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_Technical_Errors">Wiki page</a> to learn more.<br><br>3) Does the author show any improvement in their English?

            <p>First of all, he says that he&#39;s writing to improve his English. Didn&#39;t quite work, as the language in the profile is so butchered that can only get worse by disabling spellcheck. (And I didn&#39;t even understand if he had a dream in which everything in Berlin was written in English or he seriously thinks that someday that could really happen).<br>To improve English there&#39;s only one realiable way: keep studying it, and then exercize writing. Writing alone won&#39;t do you any good.<br><br>But, as already said, how could you seriously think of writing a fanfiction for a fandom you DON&#39;T know? Heck, I write missions only for fandoms I know really well, and they require a somewhat lesser degree of canon &quot;manipulation&quot; that writing a good fanfic!<br><br>Another idea for sporking could be MSTs, as the lenght of the fic is not an important factor as in missions.</p>

<li>For this one, I direct you to Spidey3000, a Super Smash Brothers Stu who was slain by the PPC. However, it turns out that his author had come around, and even makes an appearance in-mission. I suggest you ask Neshomeh about this first, but if they seem concerned about their character being a Mary Sue, it may be best to see what their thoughts on the story are then. I dunno how you&#39;d go about asking that of course, but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a way.<br><br>2. Well, it still has bad SPaG, formatting, characterization, and stupidity. That, my dear, is what the Department of Floaters is for. Also, if a character is super OOC, then chances are it&#39;s a special kind of Mary Sue called a &quot;Character Replacement&quot;. So essentially, you go about the mission watching as word mishaps occur while gathering charges against the replacements and other things like that. Basically, you just make fun of the SPaG and the format while going through the rounds and killing off character replacements.<br><br>3. My God, you /know/ it&#39;s bad when the freaking list of fandoms you&#39;re writing for is a wall of text! Miah actually recently did something where she sporked six short fanfictions in the span of a single mission, so you can probably do something like that.<br><br>I&#39;m sure someone else has better answers, but... that&#39;s my input on it.</li>

            <p>He was a fairly unique case, but I don&#39;t see why he couldn&#39;t set a precedent. The story is this:<br><br>I was directly notified about the story through my website, which has a form for submitting badfic to meâ€”it&#39;s anonymous, so I don&#39;t know who reported it. I looked it over, said to myself &quot;Okay, yeah, this is pretty terrible&quot; and decided to go ahead and spork it, relying on Phobos to fill in the gaps in my knowledge of Super Smash Bros.<br><br>Only later did I read the author&#39;s summary, on his main page.<br><br>Turns out Spidey3000-the-author actually knew about the PPC, and specifically said &quot;Okay, yeah, this is pretty terrible; don&#39;t read it unless you&#39;re the PPC looking for work.&quot; I was pretty confident getting in touch with him, since he had already abandoned the story and seemed to fully condone it being PPC&#39;d.<br><br>I&#39;d be surprised if many authors are quite that supportive up-front, but approaching them with the question of whether they&#39;d mind their story being used as the subject of a parody couldn&#39;t hurtâ€”the worst that can happen is they&#39;d say no (give or take calling you a nasty-wasty meen person), and you&#39;d really have to leave it alone at that point.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Generally, the ones I&#39;m seeing don&#39;t seem to quite understand the concept of a Mary Sue, and have just been told that their characters are Sues and therefore put that in the notes so people stop flaming them.

It may be the work of a troll.<br><br>There&#39;s also an very obvious sue named &quot;Marilyn[e?] Satangod&quot;. In a world based on Japanese legend. She is also the strongest person in the universe and has &quot;the most powerful fire magic ever and it can pburn everything[sic]&quot;. There are a huge amount of character derailment, with just about every character suddenly loving every other character they meet, and every character has somehow developed &quot;big boobies&quot; despite many of them being flat chested in canon. There are several inconsistencies, sometimes even in the same sentence, such as how &quot;sakutya[sic, sakuya]&quot; is wearing &quot;a blood red dress that was died with real blood and she was nsaked except for a bloody apron and she also had on socks that had black and red stripes and she lookined like she was from hot topic[sic]&quot;. The author also attempts to use &quot;kawaii&quot; as a verb. <br><br>Normally, I would just laugh at a poorly written fanfic from this continuum because of odd circumstances involving the continuum, but this one is just too awful to be funny.</p>

            <p>You guys probably know me from the chat room. I got Permission about a year ago and I&#39;ve been hanging out at the PPC. I have a couple of agents (Jane Doe and Jason Harris), but I haven&#39;t written anything with them other than an intro piece.<br><br>I keep encountering stuff I want to kill, but I have writer&#39;s block. So... I was hoping somebody would be willing to do a co-write with me--get my agents some training and get me out of the writer&#39;s block. My agents are in Floaters, so I could pretty much do anything--Sues, slash/het, crossovers, whatever. I&#39;m (a decade) over 18 if it matters.<br><br>Any takers?

            <p>As everyone else has said so far, knowing your fandoms would be great. I&#39;m pretty versatile in that regard, so long as it&#39;s not tremendously obscure. My DMS agents only handle stories based on video game continuums, but my DBS agents are freelance, so they have a bit more leeway in that regard. I also have a Implausible AU agent and an upcoming pair of agents in the Department of Bad Parody (they&#39;re a little bit down the road time-wise, however.)<br><br>I&#39;m usually available any time after 7 or 9 PM MDT (Mountain Daylight Time,) which would be 9 or 10 Eastern Daylight Time.

            <p>Like IndeMaat, I&#39;d like to know your fandoms first. As you&#39;ve seen, my DMS agents work mainl in sci-fi/fantasy fandoms, with the occasional foray into crime dramas. My DBSers are Freelance, so they&#39;re good for most fandoms. I must say, though, that I&#39;m not that big on anime/foreign genres, so I wouldn&#39;t be much help there.<br><br>As for my time zones, I&#39;m usually available before 2 PM PST or after 9 PM PST (midnight EST), so I hope that&#39;s all right with you.</p>

            <p>Just out of curiosity and because I think it could be a little bit relevant.<br><br>Do you want to take your training mission in any of the stuff you have lined up?

            <p>...is that is can be both entertaining and enthralling to people who are unfamiliar with the canon involved. You&#39;ve nailed that here. I know next to nothing about both Avatar and NausicaÐ´, but I still thoroughly enjoyed this mission. Your character interaction in particular was very good. Florestan and Eusabius have an excellent rapport, and throwing Zerenze into the mix was a nice choice.<br><br>My one issue is regarding how large the quotes from the original badfic can get. There are points, particularly closer to the end, where the sheer length of the excerpts was dragging down the pacing of the mission. Really long excerpts always smack a bit of &#39;telling&#39; rather than &#39;showing.&#39; I would suggest that you try to describe what is happening in the badfic rather than just resorting straight to direct quotes.<br><br>Looking forward to your next mission!</p>

            <p>Nice Mission! Though I have no idea about NausicaÐ´ of the Valley of Wind (Ha-ha copy.paste!) I am glad I know one of the settings. <br><br>One minor gripe (Read; inconsequential.) The Maquis de Sod saying/typing &#39;guys&#39; just seems off to me. Dunno why, wasn&#39;t a deal breaker for me anyway.

And it just reeked of plot convenience, too. &quot;Hey, let&#39;s get Nausicaa on Pandora! Wait, she needs to be in the Avatar program! No she doesn&#39;t, I have an ohmu that can secrete a magical serum that can let her breathe the air of Pandora without dying! Now I don&#39;t need to bother explaining anything else!

            <p>...though in terms of Studio Ghibli environmental aesop movies, absolutely <i>nothing</i> will beat out &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; for me. <i>Nothing</i>.

            <p>I have too many interests to list here. My current top three are Touhou, partially because of my interest in similar, less popular games, partially because of how bad fanfic for it normally is, Etrian Odyysey and Gargoyles.

            <p>There are a few things in stories that just throw me out of the story and react in a scale between not continuing to read the story and slapping the badfic label on it depending on the severity of the offense.<br><br><br>What are things that will take otherwise goodfic, and just completely ruin it for you?<br><br><br>For me, I can think of two fairly related phenomena that do this to me.<br><br>1. Bad Medicine. A story is going along just fine and then someone gets hurt, and instead of taking the person to the ER (when they are perfectly capable of doing so) they call their doctor friend over to treat serious and life threatening injuries at home. Drives me to distraction, and this kind of thing usually doesn&#39;t come up until several chapters in, so I am particularly disgusted that I have invested several chapters worth of reading only to have this ruin it.<br><br>2. Bad Psychology. Let me give an example of this. I was reading, as it was being published, a story in Psych. It wasn&#39;t awe inspiring, but it was much better than average, sometimes even hitting good. I am a fan of Whumpfic, and this fic was in that category. So, Shawn is in a bad situation, not doing well at all, the fic had done a decent job of getting him there. Then he snapped. Total psychotic break. Catatonia. My eyebrows are raised, because the fic hadn&#39;t really set that kind of reaction up well enough. Then there was not one, but two, suicide attempts. And then the fic completely blew it. The character has been trying to kill himself and having breaks from reality. What is the responsible and legal medical response? In patient psychiatric placement. What is the fic&#39;s response? Send him home with his dad, before the massive cuts from him smashing through a window have even started to heal.  So yeah, I&#39;m going ARRGGGHHH at the fic, because I had read 15,000 words of it over several weeks and then it totally blows it.<br><br><br>So, join in! What drives you crazy in a fic?</p>

            <p>Well, for one thing, I never really like OC/canon romances.  OC/OC or canon/canon, yes, but there&#39;s just something about OC/canon that just feels sort of <i>wrong</i>.  Still, that in and of itself isn&#39;t <i>really</i> bad - what I especially can&#39;t stand is when the OC is nothing but a jerk to the canon but they fall in love with her anyway.  Especially if the canon changes character completely when doing so.  <i>Especially</i> if said canon changes from a cool, collected, competent character to a lovestruck fool.<br><br>Actually, any severe OOC-ness will get me riled up.  The characters are almost always my favorite part of a story - when someone takes these characters and changes their very personality, I get almost morally outraged.  Even one really bad OOC moment can make me give up on an otherwise-good fic.  (This is why I never got into The Methods of Rationality, despite the intriguing idea; Rationalist!Harry came off as a stuck-up, condescending, pretentious prick).</p>

            <p>For me, it&#39;s blatant Character Ruptures/Character Replacements - or, to use more general terms, when characters don&#39;t act like themselves.<br><br>For instance, I was enjoying the Sonic story &quot;<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3730563/1/">Welcome Home, Welcome Doom</a>&quot; until Amy gave up being with Sonic so that the main OC could have him.  Wait, <i>what?!?</i>  Amy is madly in love with Sonic to the point of obsession - she&#39;s been known to get <i>very</i> violent with other girls who show much as a glimmer of romantic attraction towards him.  So having her voluntarily stop chasing Sonic for the sake of someone else is an egregious violation of her character, and it completely turned me off from the story.  Shame, because the villain was pulling some intense psychological warfare.</p>

            <p>I forgot to mention that bad grammar irks me.  Even one mistake sets me a little on edge, but it wouldn&#39;t really turn me off.  On the other hand, if the author&#39;s writing suggests that they&#39;d have gotten a C or lower in English class, I&#39;m outta there.  I can be a bit more patient if it appears that the author&#39;s first language isn&#39;t English (as opposed to the author just not giving a **** about proper grammar), but the fic has to be <i>really</i> good for me to avoid losing interest when the author doesn&#39;t have good grammar.</p>

            <p>...breaking or simply ignoring the laws of physics will still make me want to shoot the screen, as will egregious continuity errors.<br><br>I mean sure, not knowing the finer points of orbital mechanics, fine, not too much of an issue.

            <p>I had to think about it because, well, when I read fanfic I often go in knowing or at least expecting badfic. And when I already expect the worst, nothing can really rile me. A shrug is what most of the stuff on this list gets from me: it&#39;s badfic, what was I expecting?<br><br>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever read a story that started good and then took a turn for the worst. The either start bad and stay bad, or start good and stay good. I guess I&#39;m lucky that way.<br><br>But the thing that is currently annoying me most is lack of consequences. I&#39;m sassing out a fic for a mission where an OC returns after having been missing for three years. Everyone though she was dead -- apparently they&#39;ve seen the body -- but hurray, she&#39;s still alive. And everyone&#39;s happy. <br><br>My problem is that no one is in the least bit upset that the character didn&#39;t contact them in three years. I&#39;d be upset if my loved one/best friend disappeared for three years and then came back. Happy, in part, but also upset and a little bit betrailed. I don&#39;t think we&#39;d go back to the way things were immediately. And even if she gave a rational explanation of why she couldn&#39;t get in touch, I&#39;d still be upset for a little while longer. I&#39;d expect some of the canons to feel the same. <br><br>No such consequence in that story. The canons are only having the feelings the OC wants them to have. Love, and an unhealthy amount of forgiveness. (She stole the kid of one of the canons and he doesn&#39;t even mention it!)<br><br>That&#39;s making me go aargh. Every time I think about it. Should start that mission soon.</p>

            <p>Medicine fail, definitely. Science fail in general, to an extent.

Mistakes here and there tend to be more funny than annoying to meâ€”I look for funny mistakes as part of determining if a fic is mission-worthyâ€”but I still cringe every time I see a construction that reminds me of &quot;The Girl and Her Dragon.&quot; I can&#39;t use the word &quot;as&quot; anymore without being reminded. &gt;.<br>And occasionally, things that are done for absolutely no good reason. I expect badfic to be nonsensical, but when someone&#39;s character is defamed through sheer incompetence, or just for the heck of it, or just to &quot;prove a point,&quot; or what have you... ARGH. I&#39;m primarily thinking of my favorite characters here, but it doesn&#39;t have to be one of them.

            <p>One of the major problems that I&#39;ve seen long-running goodfics run into from time to time is arc padding. A story will go on and on with more and more obstacles thrown into the path of the main characters until the audience essentially quits from exhaustion. One of my favorite stories (a monster of a fic, with 30+ chapters) lost me when the author killed off one of the two major villains only to introduce another, even worse villain! As the TV Tropes page on Darkness Induced Audience Apathy says, &quot;MEANINGFUL conflict is the soul of drama.&quot;<br><br>Free-floating punctuation is also a major sticking point for me. It really chafes my cheeks every time I see characters talking like guards from a Metal Gear Solid game. &quot;!&quot; and &quot;?&quot; are not acceptable sentences. They are lazy substitutes for writing actual descriptions.<br><br>Worst of all in my mind is the free-floating ellipsis. Having someone say &quot;...&quot; might be the standard in comic books or manga or Japanese role-playing games, but it has no place in conventional writing. <i>Describe</i> the character&#39;s speechlessness: does her jaw waggle soundlessly? Do her eyes boggle out as she stares at the thing which has befuddled her? Is her head tilted to one side?<br><br>I&#39;ve seen the free-floating ellipsis pop up in a few PPC missions. Tut tut, guys and gals. You disappoint Uncle PC.</p>

            <p>Well, a lot of things annoy me, but I can soldier through a lot, but something that really makes me ARRRGGHH is...<br><br>Characters who get away with things free of consequences, moral of other wise. Especially violence in comedy Shows.<br><br>This really makes it hard to read a story, or watch a show. I know it is something that happens a lot in comedy shows, and I can tolerate it usually, because it is For Laughs. But sometimes it just gets way too far. a character pushing someone out of a treehouse, and then jumping on them, to a laugh track playing made me quit watching a show.<br><br>I have this 170K LotR fic, and the OCs in it and horrible. They don&#39;t have powers, or change races, or even wildly coloured hair or eyes. They do, however, do things so wildly stupid and on impulse. For example, jumping on Frodo repeatedly, kicking Boromir and Aragorn in the nuts to &#39;prove their worth&#39;. They are NEVER called on ANYTHING.<br><br>So, to summarize, I hate it when people can do what ever they want with no consequences. Once it reaches &#39;Blatantly hurting someone and being allowed&#39; I will mostly dump the fic. </p>

            <p>I actually enjoy a good guro scene (though I&#39;m fairly picky about them), but characters surviving things which would logically kill them with no magical or technological explanation makes me stabby in the bad way, hence why the infamous spear incident got me so riled. Not to mention the one where Guy 1 kicks Guy 2 in the back which somehow causes Guy 2 to fall on top of Guy 1.<br><br>Also, randomly gained superpowers. If there&#39;s some setup that&#39;s one thing, but when the guy literally gains a new power with every fight scene ... ack.</p>

            <p>not being portrayed in the right way. Even some of the slightest traumas you see in H/C fics are not just going to go away after the injured party is rescued. Sometimes, even minor incidents can mentally impact someone for life. The Hurt doesn&#39;t end right after the people are healed from their physical injuries.<br>Especially Rape. I just can&#39;t stand it when a character in a fic only takes about 2 days to recover from rape. NO!<br>I know people who have been raped, and it&#39;s taken them years to recover. It has affected their whole lives, and changed, fundamentally, who they are. You  can&#39;t just trivialize or shake off something like that, even in fic.<br>So I suppose, to summarize, my pet peeve for fic would be not showing the mental effects of physical trauma. </p>

            <p>You see this most often in Self Insert sues. In fact, it&#39;s the reason why I mostly want to tackle those, with only a few exceptions. The exchange of identity is the rawest, most overt, form a Sue can take. Or so I feel.<br><br>But what do I mean by this?<br><br>It is easy to see that society sets standards for people that are nearly impossible to reach. For example: for women, it&#39;s often an image of physical beauty... a beauty that&#39;s unattainable by most of the population. Many people, absorbing this in culture, associate themselves with the negative. &quot;Society sets THIS message forward... but I am not that. I am worse than it. I am bad. I need to change.&quot;<br><br>None of this is conscious, or it usually isn&#39;t. But the evidence can be seen so clearly in Mary Sues: Often they are idealized in beauty... THEY reached that unattainable standard. It&#39;s not real beauty. I just see the tears and frustration of the writer in stuff like that... that they don&#39;t realize they are promoting and desiring to be the very image that&#39;s hurting them. <br><br>What does this have to do with Self Inserts?<br><br>The Sue Transformation.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t happen in every bad/Mary Sue Self Insert story. But it&#39;s so common, it hurts. It&#39;s so common, it should have a wiki article. <br><br>The person enters the world with their normal appearance, or close to it. But as soon as they get involved in the fantasy world, they change their appearance, ability level... even species and personality. They throw away who they were, simply because they wish they were better. Because they think this thing that isn&#39;t them is better.<br><br>Whenever I see a poor girl that is transformed like that in a Suefic... I just see it as that girl burning out, dying... and a horrid vampire of ego and desire taking hold of the empty husk and puppeting it around. It horrifies me.<br><br>It&#39;s natural to want to be better than you are.<br><br>But to throw your whole self away for it, your entire identity, losing <i>who</i> you are at your very core...<br><br>It makes me sick.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sick and tired of people just absolutely sucking at portraying disability and disabled characters.<br><br>Okay, first of all: Disabled characters come in as many variations as non-disabled ones. The fictional world is already clogged up with &quot;plucky, inspirational Tiny Tim&quot; and &quot;depressed, self-pitying wreck&quot;. We do not need them. We don&#39;t like them. They suck. Write real people, not stereotypes.<br><br>Second: Magical healing? Not cool. Okay, I get that occasionally you will want to have somebody recover from an injury that should be permanent--maybe to show off a character&#39;s healing ability or a doctor&#39;s skill. But if you&#39;re going to write it as &quot;Oh, noes, this guy is going to be disabled! The horror!&quot; Like that&#39;s the worst possible fate for a person, worse than death.<br><br>And on that note, can we please stop automatically killing off the guy who just got an injury that will cause disability? If you&#39;ve got a character who&#39;s just gone blind or deaf or lost a limb or broke his spine, that does NOT make it somehow okay to kill him off because &quot;Oh, he wouldn&#39;t have had much of a life anyway; it&#39;s better this way.&quot; Again, it can be legitimate--the guy who&#39;s hurt and can&#39;t walk may stay behind to pull a You Shall Not Pass on the approaching enemy--but killing off a character because you&#39;re too much of a wimp to address the issue of a permanent disability is not cool.<br><br>And then there&#39;s the mental stuff--the people with the weird brains that work in weird ways. I&#39;m especially sensitive to autism!fail, for the obvious reason that I&#39;m autistic yourself (No, your Mary Sue is NOT going to pull Poor Little Autistic Kid out of his &quot;shell&quot; and turn him into a typical kid just through her magical caring!). But it&#39;s more than just that. Being mentally disabled in some way doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re a little kid. It doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re immature. Say you&#39;re 25 years old and have an IQ of 40. Guess what? You&#39;re an adult. An adult with a low IQ who is just barely able to learn to read and count--but an adult, not an overgrown kid. There&#39;s a difference.<br><br>Let&#39;s not even get into the psychology. You wanna read about my views on that, go to the &quot;Bad Psychology&quot; page on the wiki--I wrote most of it.<br><br>Yeah, so... disability stuff, mostly. But there&#39;s other stuff. You can get me pretty riled up if one character &quot;cures&quot; another characters asexuality through magical healing cock.</p>

            <p>In my case, I tend to respond really negatively to how the author reacts. I hate it when:<br><br>1. The author talks about their thing like it&#39;s the greatest thing in the world.

This is self-explanatory, and it&#39;ll turn me off to anything.<br><br>But yeah. As for things in stories themselves...<br><br>1. M-preg. I absolutely <i>cannot stand</i> M-preg. If it shows up in the story, I never read it again.<br><br>2. Things being rushed through. Especially dialogue. This is a little more personal, because having well-paced action is something I&#39;m constantly grappling with as a fanfiction author. So if other people can&#39;t care about that thing, I don&#39;t care about what they do with the rest of it unless the plot is super, super intriguing.</p>

            <p>There are a huge number of things that annoy me, but I think they all boil down to four:<br><br>1) Equating the actors with the characters.<br>2) Painfullly obvious vapid wish fulfillment.<br>3) Anachronism.<br>4) Stupid AU and original fic masquerading as AU.<br><br>1) You might think two actors look hot/good together. This does NOT translate to the characters. Go write RPF/S somewhere else, don&#39;t slap character names on the actors and write hot sex.<br><br>2) When the female OC obviously exists for the sole reason of falling in love with the author&#39;s lust object.<br><br>3) This includes prom dresses in medieval fandoms, modern swear words, modern characters revealing the future, modern language, modern viewpoints, etc. Peter Pevensie is not going to say &quot;S**t, babe, you look hot.&quot;<br><br>4) When the author blatantly ignores any good reasons for things happening, or when it&#39;s a cookie cutter fic written for the purpose of getting two characters together. E.g. &quot;Hermione is a water nymph who loves Prince Draco.&quot;<br><br>OOC is also extremely irritating.</p>

<li>Bad dialogue. I hate it, hate it, haaaaate it. So I&#39;m reading a Sherlock fanfic, right? Would&#39;ve been an okay read, but the dialogue was baaad. It reduced both main characters to whining dramatically about the situation, using phrases like &quot;hook your talons into my friend,&quot; and actually crying in front of Moriarty. It made me physically cringe. I especially hate really long-winded dialogue in a situation that normally wouldn&#39;t allow for long-winded dialogue. Like when two characters hold an emotional, heartfelt, psyche-probing conversation while apparently ignoring the villain who is standing right in front of them and holding them at gunpoint. Drives me up the wall.<br><br>2. Bad attitude in the Author&#39;s notes, or author&#39;s notes in the middle of the story. Need I say more?</li>

            <p>Bad dialogue seems to be the bane of so many good plot bunnies.  Certain characters have a... way of speaking.  You break that too badly, you break my suspension of disbelief.<br><br>On the larger topic, I&#39;d add a fandom-specific ARRGGGHH trigger: Weasley bashing.  Well, over-the-top Weasley bashing.  I just... I don&#39;t get it.  Unless you&#39;re doing some seriously-AU fic, it requires you to make them so far OOC that... ARRGGGHH!!!</p>

            <p>In no particular order:<br><br>1) Trivialisation. Enough said. <br><br>2) Bad SP&amp;G. Now, I can understand if there are the occasional spelling errors that may have been overlooked in writing or if English is not a first language - but when someone either leaves countless errors in their work without rectifying them or (judging from their writing) seem to fail to grasp basic spelling and grammer, I am almost tempted to reach through the computer and shake the author by the shoulders violently.<br><br>You have to be thirteen or over to post on a site such as FF.Net - you SHOULD know the basics, for crying out loud!<br><br>3) Sues, male or female. Enough has been written on the topic that I don&#39;t need to go into depth here. <br><br>But, basically, my view is this - if an OC is unable to reasonably justify their abilities within the context of the universe and/or shows some development beyond &quot;hooking up with the author&#39;s lust object&quot; (not that I object but at least write it well), then I cannot identify with them and they&#39;ll mean nothing to me.<br><br>4) Canon warping and crossover bias. A side efect from my fascination with crossovers (as well as my only fic to date being one), I enjoy reading crossovers that are well thought out as well as giving everyone involved a fair game.<br><br>However, I tend to cringe a bit when some works radically warp canon beyond recognition (to the point where the original canons are unrecognisable) or continue to favor one faction over another without ample justification.<br><br>But, that&#39;s just me - I otherwise love crossovers!<br><br>5)PWP. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I love a good romance story - from the frst meeting, the growing relationship, all up to the consumation and &quot;the question&quot; ... or not, if in a time of war. PWP ... well, it&#39;s pointless. I&#39;ve yet to see an example that is well written (maybe I could broaden my horizons to fandoms I haven&#39;t examined yet), but a few I have seen so far are nothing but cringe-worthy laundry lists of innuendo and acts.<br><br><br>Well, that&#39;s just my opinions though. No need to spread them around.</p>

            <p>Hi! I found this site when I was lurking around in a forum.

            <p>Having just given the potential agents a look-over (no time to go over the writing sample), I have a couple of notes for you:<br><br>1) The Department of Floaters does not have a Mary-Sue Division.  I think you are talking about the Department of Mary-Sues, Freelance Division.  Not a big deal.  Easy to fix.<br><br>2) This one is just my two cents, but I have a few questions about the characters.  Why does the one turn into a rooster?  Why is the other so off that he needs dried frog pills, licorice, <i>and</i> Bleeprin to put him right?

            <p>Okay, fixed and edited.<br><br>To answer your question-I originally introduced Gurgan during an RP that involved him becoming a giant chicken. I want to keep it as a sort of nod to that-it was a lot of fun. Anyway, I&#39;m not really going to use it as a character trait, more like a plot device: one more obstacle for the two to overcome periodically. As for Derwin&#39;s unstablitily, I want to gradually REVEAL why he went so completely nutso. Thanks again for the input and the advice, Phobos!</p>

            <p>Having met Derwin in the &quot;My Inner Life&quot; MST, I have to say that he works pretty well as a character in practice. He&#39;s rather funny. </p>
