            <p>Remember Jacqueline Howett, the author that had a hissy fit when she got a less-than-glowing review?<br>Well, I found this and thought it would be relevant.<br><a href="http://pottersues.livejournal.com/711755.html?thread=68587851#t68587851"><a href="http://pottersues.livejournal.com/711755.html?thread=68587851#t68587851">http://pottersues.livejournal.com/711755.html?thread=68587851#t68587851</a></a><br>I linked directly to the comment, so you just have to scroll down below the entry. Look at the girl&#39;s response to being featured there and how she handles the criticism from other people. <br>Am I the only one who finds it amusing that a 12 year old can handle a bad review with more maturity than a grown woman?</p>

            <p>I liked the super plothole in this mission; it makes sense that such a major change to the canon&#39;s past, and the major ripple effect it would have on the game&#39;s outcome, would manifest as a major, violent plothole.  It was a cool idea to have Lore actually dive into it in order to correct the Sue&#39;s changes.<br><br>One thing I was left wondering: you implied that Ray&#39;s small dog form was a disguise for the fic.  Is Ray&#39;s normal form something other than human?  I&#39;m just curious, since Lore and Ray both became dogs.</p>

Her author avatar is a dog-eared person. She picks dog disguise a lot. Because there is some form of dog pretty much in every canon. <br><br>Lore isn&#39;t a canine, but looks like one and so he picks the closest possible thing a lot. Because shifting your biology is not very comfortable.<br><br>Fun fact-- Lore is pretty big and although he can change his shape, either can&#39;t change his mass, or he refuses to. Which is why always he seems to be huge in various ways. Either absurdly heavy, absurdly muscled, or just plain large. He also can&#39;t change his color, so he&#39;s always black.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad you gave this atrocity a good sporking. I love Ōkami, it&#39;s beautiful world, diverse characters and emotions... And Waka is my favorite character. He&#39;s sparkly, but in a good way. Unlike this tripe you have so wonderfully skewered.<br><br>You described the canon well at the start. Nice and simple.<br>I laughed at Waka&#39;s google-translated french, and I enjoyed watching Lore remove the &quot;curse&quot; on the Oina tribe. That was creative.<br><br>If I do get permission, I would like to spork an Okami fic of this caliber. You&#39;ve inspired me. This cannot stand.</p>

            <p>I have recently located a bad fic courtesy of the Star Fox series.

Gratuitous OOCness, a flimsy plot and content disturbing enough to make one scream in agony are the mainstays of this &quot;fan fiction&quot;.

            <p>I&#39;m now on chapter 4, and the most notable thing so far is not the dramatic oocness of the supporting cast, or the fetish factor (which is actually far to subtle - vague descriptions and implied scenes rather than graphic descriptions), but how <i>boring</i> it is.

            <p>The invasion story arch is complete. I can&#39;t imagine the reason that the author hated Peppy so much that they had him killed in such a horrible, painful, humiliating way, topped off by the fact that they trapped his soul into a crystal so he&#39;d be in a dark place for eternity.<br><br>They also hated Slippy and Leon, but not enough that they spent more than a sentence mentioning it. <br><br>There&#39;s also 20 more chapters to go and there&#39;s no more threat that&#39;s been foreshadowed so far - all the prophesies and cutaways were all resolved with that extremely anticlimactic &#39;battle&#39; between Fox and Falco.

            <p>In my anger over the story, I had forgotten to post a summary. This is what I can gather from the story (Readers be warned):<br><br>Two months after the endings of Star Fox Command, Fox is alone and living in his aging Arwing. He attempts suicide by crashing his ship on a nearby planet, but he survives. Krystal, a priestess from a forest village and her bodyguard Caruso rescue Fox and heal his wounds.<br><br>Fox is then idolized as a deity by the entire village and used as a sex toy by Krystal. Later in the story, Falco and his teammates, including Wolf and Leon, try to “rescue” Fox so they could use him to their advantages. However, the villagers successfully defense themselves and capture Falco, Katt, Wolf and Peppy. Slippy and Leon die in the attack and Bill escapes with his life. All of the captives are made slaves, with the exception of Peppy being buried alive and sealed in a crystal for eternity.<br><br>Over the course of the story, Fox ends up being meeting Neil Zap, who is ordered to find information about Krystal’s village and see if it’s useful for Bill and someone named Sprinkles. Fara Phoenix appears and joins the village, while Falco is transformed into a woman by Katt’s wishes (because she is a lesbian). Fox becomes a polygamist when Krystal marries him to a village guard. Lucy Hare then attacks the village to find and kill Fox, but she’s captured, skinned alive, enslaved and turned into a twisted sex being. Also, Krystal becomes so enamored with the male reproductive system, she carries out a plan to grow her own while turning Fox into a woman to impregnate him.</p>

            <p>After having skimmed like 10 more chapters. The one truly amazing thing about this fic is how they make all these bizarre crazy things <i>boring</i> with over-explanations and redundancies and overly passive characters. <br><br>Half of one of the longest chapters is Katt explaining to Crystal and Fara what a lesbian is. It&#39;s also 90% dialogue in large cumbersome chunks mixed with righteous indignation about the holiness of man-seed. <br><br>Reading it is like pulling teeth. </p>

            <p>Yeah, it&#39;s badfic. But I wouldn&#39;t spork it. GET READY FOR A LONG DISCUSSION-PROMPTING RANT. PUT ON YOUR RANT HELMETS.<br><br>I&#39;d like to delicately point out that the &#39;grossness&#39; of a fanfic does not necessarily indicate it&#39;s worthiness to be sporked. Just because it grosses you out doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s the reason why it should be sporked. <br><br>I recognize a lot of these nasty things as <i>fetish</i> material, publicly displayed or not. After reading a bit of the fic, I see that the writer was VERY aware of what he/she was writing and none of it was a mistake or an ignorance of biology-- more like a kink for twisted or different biology.<br><br>The best &#39;gross&#39; bad slash for missions is fun to make fun of. Say, a story describes somebody not knowing people have intestines, or is made from an utter ignorance of how the act is done at all. This makes hilarious images of Ikea Erotica or silly physically-impossible stunts. <br><br>TL;DR-- don&#39;t look for &#39;gross.&#39; Look for &#39;bad&#39; -- the ones that say that an Arwing looks like a croissant, or ones that describe Fox&#39;s eyes as &#39;thunderclouding orbs.&#39;<br><br>A normal, or even beige and lame sex scene with a guy who shoots lightning from cue-balls where his eyeballs should be is way funnier to write about than a canon character growing the other set of funtools.</p>

            <p>Since my agents are going to deliver the F-22s they found in the last mission to DoSAT, may I make them interact with Tecno-Dann and (if it was in 2010/2011 HST) put some references about the dragon-disaster? My idea is to have my agents portal in the Hangar while still on the plane, nearly running on somebody and causing some of the tecnicians mutter things like &quot;yesterday dragons, today fighter jets, what&#39;s going to break in tomorrow?&quot;. Also, there are only Sun Crushers or other machinery too there?<br><br>And I&#39;ll need also a couple Agents prone to chase anything vaguely similar to a Sue, in order to add a little misunderstanding in my third Agent&#39;s recruitment (mistaken for a Sue, weapons drawn, tension, those sort of things). However, since it&#39;s not a godd light on them, I could use generics. It&#39;s only an offer. For the ones who want the details, the agent-to-be is supposed a keyblade-welding badfic clone of Sakura Kinomoto (Card Captor Sakura). She was from a whole mess of a fic which I am not going to kill (sort of borderline between good and bad) that has as the best part King Mickey Mouse breaking the Fourt Wall. In a fic that was supposed to be very serious with a Haloverse Spartan as the main character. <br><br>Also, in a few days&#39; time I&#39;ll need some beta readers for the mission (Ace Combat/Harry Potter crossover). Since it&#39;s quite of an experimental thing I&#39;d like if some of the oldbyes could have a look at it and say if it works or if it&#39;s a mess.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t recall where DoGA stores their Sun Crushers, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not in the hangar. The only permanent fixtures (as of now) are the aforementioned Darkspear, a large collection of tools for working on ship-sized vehicles, and a very heavily modified gundam. (Agent Dann&#39;s pet project - it&#39;s constantly suffering massive system integration issues, thanks to having scavenged technology from a half-dozen continuums.)<br><br>Portalling straight into the hangar could be problematic, as it&#39;s not a normal portal ID code - there&#39;s extra parameters for area and volume requirements. Making a space big enough to land a fighter in shouldn&#39;t be hard.<br><br>(Watch out, though, they might get retrofit with antigravity gear, to make flying them around easier. Stuff left in DoSAT tends to get tinkered with.)</p>

            <p>However, as for what&#39;s in the hangar, there might also be the &quot;ground ship&quot; Phobos and I found on <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999/04tds.html">this mission</a>, dubbed the <i>C.P.S. Darkspear</i> by Agent Barid. (We figured C.P.S. for Continuum Protective Service, or something like that.) She&#39;s basically a sailing ship with the inexplicable ability to sail over solid ground. As far as I know, she&#39;s still flying Barid&#39;s tabard with the rubber Swiss army-knife design as her flag.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Hello Everyone!<br><br>I&#39;m Ne Chin a.k.a Nechinia. I&#39;ve been snooping about for a while now, and finally decided to join up. Make my presence known, I guess? I enjoy any fic that catches my eye, but mostly video games, books, and the occasional film fic or two. I tend to get easily angry about Resident Evil fiction though. Honestly, they&#39;re running/fighting for their lives. When are they going have time for a quick shag? Erhm...Yes, so hello everyone.</p>

            <p>Hmm... I still wonder how exactly would the characters be neutralised or something, since I think that there is a chance that the Hetalia characters are Anthropomorphic Personifications.

Even after reading about what happens in the fic, I&#39;m getting a bad feeling this &quot;Amelia&quot; is indeed a sue. <br><br>I mean really, is there a good reason why she is able to see fairies and other similar creatures? Also, who falls for her and details about her &quot;tragic past&quot;?</p>

            <p>It is entirely possible that the Nations cannot be neuralyzed. As Anthropomorphic Personifications, they undoubtedly are different from normal humans. But it occurs to me that Death was merely a skeleton, and had no biology to manipulate, where the Nations are entirely human in form and may, in fact, be susceptible to neuralyzing&#39;s affect on the brain.<br><br>Let&#39;s open this question up to the general public.

            <p>Final Hetalia-related question: Can General Winter forget, if he ever appears in a Hetalia badfic? I ask this because he represents a certain winter.

            <p>General Winter probably can&#39;t forget, but he also probably doesn&#39;t need to forget, either. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s really able to be hurt. Because he&#39;s Russia&#39;s winter. If anything hurts him, it&#39;s a character replacement. The Real Russia&#39;s Winter is probably nigh inconsiderable. <br><br>Hatred is made up by humans, but also really isn&#39;t something made up on purpose. It is one of those visceral things that is probably innate for humans, and is a part of reality. That said, Hatred could swing either way: if you interpret it to be a part of reality, or part of perception. <br><br>Actually, that&#39;s probably a good guideline.<br><br>Things that simply are, that are part of reality itself: external concepts, and probably can&#39;t be treated as entirely human. They kind of become deity-like in the manner of Death. You may be able to make &#39;sleep&#39; generally sleepy, but you can&#39;t characterize it. It&#39;s beyond human ability to fully make them human. Hence the generations upon generations of trying to describe the &#39;ocean&#39; as a woman... but making her more like a god.<br><br>Things that are perceived, that are interpreted or invented by an organism are impermanent like a human and probably can be treated as such. This is what gives stuff like Hetalia life-- because people can characterize these things, they can be made humanish.<br><br>If somebody in fanfic treats &#39;Spring&#39; or &#39;Cold&#39; like a real human being rather than a representation like Death, that instance is probably a character replacement and a Mary Sue only calling themselves that... You can&#39;t &#39;be&#39; Death. Death is Death.<br><br>This is why the antics concerning Death from Discworld are so /funny/. They put an eternal, external concept that is part of reality and try and make it fit in with things that are humanish, but to no avail. Even his daughter ends up a little... off.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think General Winter can forget. As the personification of a thing, he most likely has memories and powers beyond Nations. Since he is made of temperature, wind, water, geography (to my understanding of the concept of winter), he shouldn&#39;t be able to be neuralyzed.<br><br>Nations, however, are entirely the institutes of men. Only humans have created nations, only humans are parts of nations, thus the nations themselves are fully human in concept, appearance, and likely biology.<br><br>These are my thoughts on that subject.<br><br>As for which concepts on your list are external, Spring, Cold, and Ocean probably are. Hatred and Sleep are human and animal conditions, so thus might not qualify as external concepts. I&#39;m no expert, so what do other people think?</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know about that applying Death, because the wiki notes that his status as an Anthropomorphic Personification is his reason why he is immune to neutralization (unless it&#39;s wrong or something). If biology was the reason, then why is Anthropomorphic Personification used as the reason for Death&#39;s immunity instead?</p>

            <p>So, I was browsing on a site where you can only see the mature-rated fics if you have an account there. It&#39;s not a personal site, it&#39;s a fic/art archive which is set up for that purpose and the rule applies to everyone&#39;s work there. It&#39;s been suggested to me that it&#39;s better not to do missions of fics from that site, as it&#39;s iffy whether it comes under the heading of &quot;public&quot;. However, deviantArt works on similar principles and I think people have sporked/MSTed mature-rated fics from there before. Also, does MSTing have different rules on that topic than PPCing?</p>

            <p>If you can actually only see the fics through registering, it&#39;s much more private than dA where every man and his dog can see just about everything there without making an account. Therefore, it&#39;s best not to use fics from that site, whereas fics on dA are completely open to the public eye.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d agree that it&#39;s better to not do missions from there, especially if the M-rated stuff is what&#39;s being charged. I think it&#39;s said below here, it falls under Your Kink Is Not My Kink, and so on. But I think MSTs, unless they&#39;re specifically PPC MSTs, are more just using your best judgment. I still wouldn&#39;t advise it, just because it is, so to speak, behind a locked door. But a lot of places do sporkings - I think it&#39;s your call.</p>

            <p>No major canon breaches, I don&#39;t think. There&#39;s bad dialogue, anachronistic euphemisms, and a brief mention of what I think is a case of TVTropes would refer to as &quot;It&#39;s Not Rape If You Enjoy It&quot;. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s mission-worthy, but the actual writing is so silly that I really want to MST it.</p>

            <p>I mean, you can MST with PPC characters it if you want, but I personally wouldn&#39;t MST something that didn&#39;t touch canon at all.

            <p>But the actual writing offers so many opportunities for riffs I think it&#39;d make for a good MSTing. MSTing kind of works differently from the missions, I think - with the missions, the focus is on the canonical mistakes, but with a MSTing, all that&#39;s required is that it offers opportunities for jokes. Original fiction isn&#39;t PPCable, but plenty of it gets MSTed - see The Eye of Argon - so I think the same principle could apply.</p>

            <p>To quote from the poster&#39;s journal: &quot;The story: A friend of mine recently moved into a new house, and I was helping her scope out the basement. We happened to look in a cabinet underneath the sink. There we found a box containing five three-ring binders, each of them containing something like a ream of neatly typed porn. If you can call it that -- this is some of the strangest, most hilarious stuff you will ever read.&quot;<br>They can be found here: <a href="http://jupirock.livejournal.com/1312.html"><a href="http://jupirock.livejournal.com/1312.html">http://jupirock.livejournal.com/1312.html</a></a><br><br>Some of the less NSFW lines which I&#39;ll quote here to give you a rough flavour include a description of a man&#39;s skin &quot;glistening like a grandmother&quot;, supposedly French characters named things like Mitchell Kurzmann and Heinrich Southers, and a woman greeting a total stranger with &quot;Excuse me, but I need to lose my virginity.&quot;</p>

Great enough to create a cross-dimensional portal? Apparently it is. And so we follow the travels of two teenage girls, thrown into a world of magic, shadows, and children&#39;s card games...<br><br>So basically Kelsey throws a plate of spaghetti at the wall and it turns into a portal that takes her and Kitty into the Yu-Gi-Oh world. They then proceed to run around and probably scar the characters for life. Kelsey has some kind of unexplained connection to the Millennium Items. This is mostly an excuse for her to follow &quot;Bunni&quot; (Yami Bakura) around and put him in embarrassing situations. She spends the rest of the time insulting Yugi. She then injects herself into &quot;Bunni&quot; and Marik&#39;s alliance because she thinks that Marik is &quot;smoking hot.&quot; Meanwhile, Kitty follows Yugi and company around and annoys Kaiba at every opportunity.<br><br>The worst part, though? Kelsey (the author, not her self-insert) injected ME into the story too (against my will) and referred to me using an embarrassing nickname that nobody has actually called me for years. (I&#39;m Kitty&#39;s sister. I answered the phone in the first chapter and was never seen again.)</p>

Unless by interesting you mean completely bending the original plotline to your will as you see fit.<br><br>Mystic: Shut it. So anyways, sorry about the late and kind of short chapter.<br><br>So she&#39;s not just writing a bad story without realizing it. She knows exactly what she&#39;s doing, realizes that it&#39;s a bad thing, and doesn&#39;t care.</p>

            <p>Howdy! <br><br>Naw, the PPC covers whatever its writers wish it to cover - and that&#39;s a pretty wide range. I think one of the reasons we&#39;ve seen a particularly high number of Lord of The Rings sporkings is because of the disproportionately large number of badfics of the unintentionally hilarious variety that&#39;ve been attached to that particular franchise. </p>

            <p>Answer 1: No, the PPC isn&#39;t for Lord of the Rings only. For example, my Agents in the DMS, Ian and Lee, are in the Freelance Division, which means they can go to any and all fandoms on their missions. Now, some people specialize in a specific fandom- my Bad Slashers Orion and Agents Mal specialize in the Stargate Atlantis fandom -but that&#39;s not the case for everyone.<br><br>As for your second question, of course you may have a bumper sticker!<br><br>*Hands over a small stack of assorted bumper stickers of various colors.

            <p>Thanks for the bumper stickers! Yay assorted colors (and flavors, such as vanilla, fresh mint and cinnamon... now I want gum..)!<br><br>I was wondering about the variety of fictions protected because I found something I believe to be a Sue in her primordial state. The fiction &quot;Hunters and Brains&quot; (which hasn&#39;t -so far as I can tell- the slightest thing to do with zombies) on FF.net under &quot;Inception&quot; is quite... different from the canon, and is showing a few early warning signs. <br><br>There is an original character, Everbloom Dance, who is friends with Moth Song. She is a &quot;kick but&quot; Hunter, handles her sword well enough that people applaud, and wears guns on her thighs. She carries at least five other weapons at the same time. She is apparently going to be written as Arthur&#39;s bodyguard. <br><br>The fic is only one chapter as of yet, perhaps it is too soon to judge it. I simply wanted to provide an early warning about it.</p>

            <p>I have to say, the idea of sending agents into an Inception badfic makes my brain hurt. But then, I have a lot to learn here.<br><br>And since my plan of lurking doesn&#39;t seem to be panning out, welcome! Have a Bugs Bunny PEZ dispenser, and some PEZ to fill it with.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I know, I&#39;ve done another one. What can I say, it&#39;s fun!<br><br>This one is all about my DIC team, Nume and Ilraen. If you want to play my game, listen closely and see if you can tell if the song is talking about one or the other, or both, and what it&#39;s saying. It shouldn&#39;t be hard. The first two tracks ought to be pretty telling, even if you don&#39;t know my spin-off too well.<br><br>The mix is available <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/vafdmaj5i7">here at Box.net</a>, and you can find the other ones I&#39;ve done there, too, if you&#39;re interested.

            <ol>
<li> I Am a Rock—Supernumerary, as: “I have no need of friendship…I have my books and my poetry.”  Also, I so need to write a filk of this about <i>Lost</i>.  ♪My name is Locke, I love this i-i-island♪<br><br>2.  With a Little Help From My Friends—Ilraen relied on the PPC’s friendlier types to get through his “personality-deficient” stage after recruitment.<br><br>3.    Arco Arena—Um, no lyrics?  Um…I’m being struck with a feeling of confidence, so I’m going to guess Supernumerary.<br><br>4. White Rabbit—The Alice in Wonderland imagery can apply to both, since they both exited their home worlds suddenly and unexpectedly.  The lines about the Red Queen and men on the chessboard could refer to taking orders from the Flowers that Be.<br><br>5. Whirlwind—“A whirlwind came into my life and tried to rescue me” sounds like Ilraen being removed from his fic of origin.  The rest is his mental struggles with having no personality or memories, and developing these things while learning to be a PPC agent.<br><br>6.   Who Knows Where the Time Goes—I don’t feel too good about this guess, but I think this is a Supernumerary song.  It seems to have a “leaving behind” theme, which applies more to Nume, who had an entire life’s worth of plans (and some friends, surely) before he joined the PPC.<br><br>7.    Stranger in a Strange Land—I’m going to go with both again; this song seems to be about the general nature of time and space in HQ.<br><br>8.   NY Rush—I guessed Nume for the last instrumental, so I’ll say this one is Ilraen’s—it’s got kind of a positive, upbeat feel.<br><br>9.    The God Game—Uh…this one’s got me pretty stumped.  It’s a rather negative song, so I don’t see it being about an agent.  Is this one aimed at Mary Sues, maybe?<br><br>10.    Fool—I’m having trouble with this one, too.  It seems to be about escaping/hiding from the world, so based on that, I’m guessing it’s a Nume song.  Then again, the line, “I can choose to be what I want to be if I choose to be,” is more of an Andalite thing…<br><br>11.  Heretic, Hero—I’d like to think Nume and Ilraen are both heroes, and neither heretics...both, I guess? &gt;.&gt;<br><br>12. Love is Just a Four-Letter Word—Avoiding contact with other people?  Reducing the concept of love to a mere combination of letters?  This is either aimed at me or Supernumerary.<br><br>13.  Love You—The polar opposite of the previous song, which must therefore go to Ilraen.<br><br>14.   The Hundred Song—Counting is fun!  Supernumerary likes to count things.<br><br>15.    Shadow Stabbing—Hmm…I almost want to call this a <i>Neshomeh</i> song, what with all the writing imagery.  But the “mind inside the cell” and “heart can’t forget this self defense” are probably meant to represent Nume.<br><br>16. I’m Home Again—Yay, piano!  *aherm* Anyway, I think this is Ilraen, based on the title and general calm vibe of the music.  His fic of origin, despite being where he’s “from,” was not a real home for him.  In the PPC, while not necessarily “belonging” there (if anyone does), he at least has a stable (compared to a badfic) place to live and a purpose to do good in the multiverse.  Hence, home again.<br><br>17.    Feelin’ Alright—The song’s narration is wondering about, “the way it could have been.”  I think is a Nume song, as he, unlike Ilraen, is missing out on an entire other, possible life by working for the PPC.<br><br>18. You Can’t Always Get What You Want—This one feels like it’s about both agents, but specifically their partnership.  If I remember correctly, neither was terribly happy with getting the other as a partner, but they’ve turned into an effective pair nonetheless.<br><br>19.  Mission—Both, but this was kind of a given, considering the title and the fact that it provided the fanmix with its title.  Specifically, it feels like a declaration by Nume and Ilraen that they’ll continue to work together for the good of the worlds, even they don’t always get along or see eye to eye.  “We may appear belligerent, but lo!  We are not so!  We’re partners, and we’re damn good at working together!”<br><br>Hm...I&#39;ve guessed eight songs for Nume and only five for Ilraen.  Clearly, I have messed up somewhere.<br>—doctorlit, hoping he hasn&#39;t grossly misinterpreted Neshomeh&#39;s agents or fanmix</li>

            <p>Hah, I&#39;d given up on any response here--prematurely, clearly. At this point, though, this is gonna get knocked off the front page with the next post, so I don&#39;t mind telling you:<br><br>I&#39;ve actually used a pattern here. Most of the tracks are in pairs, 1 Nume, 1 Ilraen, for 7 pairs, each with a common theme or topic (more or less); but there are also four instrumental tracks that are just for mood, basically, and that also have distinct &quot;point and counterpoint&quot; sounds that seem to work for the pair; they could also stand for missions, I guess. And then there&#39;s the last track, which is the conclusion.<br><br>1 &amp; 2. You got it. I meant this first pair to introduce them, so these songs are the ones that most strongly say &quot;this is Nume/Ilraen, this is what best describes him.&quot;<br><br>3. First instrumental track. This one to me basically says &quot;we&#39;re here and we kick ass, so stand back,&quot; but it also sounds like an argument. It sets the stage for the rest of the mix and hints at the eventual conclusion.<br><br>4. This song can mean pretty much anything you want it to, but I meant it for Nume. Down the rabbit-hole describes his &quot;recruitment&quot; experience.<br><br>5. Absolutely. {= )<br><br>6. This isn&#39;t the strongest track, but to me this is basically about accepting things the way they are, because what the heck, all good things come to an end anyway. Time, of course, is always screwy in HQ.<br><br>7. Again, not the strongest, but meant more for Ilraen. The fact that it shares a title with the classic sci-fi novel about an alien visitor tipped the scales.<br><br>8. Second instrumental track. There&#39;s chaos, crazy things are happening, but it all pulls together somehow.<br><br>9. Close! Specifically, Nume&#39;s view of badficcers. You know the ones--&quot;it&#39;s my fanfic, so I can do what I want!&quot; They&#39;re playing the God game.<br><br>10. This is Ilraen. Like the narrator, he has a struggle with identifying with his distant origins or his present circumstances, and trying to find a balance between the two.<br><br>11. Third instrumental track. They change roles, though Ilraen is definitely more of a hero than Nume.<br><br>12 &amp; 13. Bingo!<br><br>14. Nume is the guy with the temper. Most of the time, anyway.<br><br>15 &amp; 16. These two changed places at the last minute, so what you&#39;ve said actually aligns with what I had originally. ^<em>^; That didn&#39;t fit the pattern as far as how I used instrumental tracks, though, so I decided &quot;Shadow Stabbing&quot; could do for Ilraen&#39;s pair with &quot;The Hundred Song.&quot; It sort of works if you take them each to be the one&#39;s general reaction to the other... &gt;.&gt;<br><br>As for &quot;Home Again,&quot; it provides breathing space and a transition to the general acceptance of the next three tracks.<br><br>17 &amp; 18. These two changed places a couple of times, so there are a couple of equally valid interpretations. I eventually settled on &quot;Feelin&#39; Alright&quot; in Nume&#39;s spot because of the repeated insistence that everything&#39;s fine in spite of not being fine, &#39;cause that&#39;s kinda how he gets by.<br><br>&quot;You Can&#39;t Always Get What You Want&quot; is overall more optimistic, with the message that although things may not always go the way you might expect or want, they&#39;ll come out all right in the end. That&#39;s very Ilraen.<br><br>19. As the first two tracks introduce the two as individuals, this is the track that most strongly presents them as a team. And that&#39;s that. {= )<br><br>You did great for someone who hasn&#39;t been obsessing over it and fine-tuning for months. {= D Thanks for playing! ^</em>^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>...considering I can&#39;t know your characters as well as you do.  I like the point-counterpoint way you set the songs up.  I&#39;ll have to leave a notecard in the CD case so I can keep track of which goes with whom. :) I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t see the connection between Ilraen and the title of track seven...<br><br>I think I enjoy some of these songs a lot more now that I better see how they apply to part of the PPC.

            <p>I do not know if this holds true for the manga, but in the anime <i>everyone</i> plays the game and has a signature monster.  It may be harder to pick one out for the sidekicks/designated cheering section, but they all have one.  The only character that we never see dueling is Mokuba Kaiba, but the video games (which may be non-canon) show him using animal monster cards, so one of the best in there would be a good choice.</p>

            <p>Okay, I have a friend that writes fanfiction, but I seriously think she may be writing Mary Sues. Her characters always have a tragic past, amazing powers that allow them to defeat some of the most powerful canon characters, and wierd colorings. Her latest creation, a Sailor Moon character (okay, she has a whole TEAM, but the main character is the one I&#39;m focusing on), is a Princess with rainbow-colored hair whose Sailor Scout form is Sailor Whirlpool. There&#39;s also a Sailor Nightmare, a Sailor Dream, a Sailor Black Hole, and a Sailor Mirror as well. Sailor Whirlpool, the leader, is able to fight with rainbows. If that&#39;s not Mary Sue-ish, what is?<br><br>Now, I love my friend dearly, but her Mary Sues are really ruining her stories. She has some pretty good story ideas, but her characters all seem to be shallow and uninteresting. I really want to talk to her about it, but I don&#39;t want to offend her, and she&#39;s the type that gets defensive and calls anybody who doesn&#39;t like her stories an idiot. Can anybody advise me on how to speak to her about this situation?</p>

            <p>Okay. Your advice has been taken to heart. I&#39;m very grateful for it, because I&#39;m worried about what might happen if my friend tries to put her work out in the public and gets flamed. You are all wonderful, amazing people.</p>

            <p>Then it&#39;s not your fault; if she rages, it won&#39;t be directed at you, and if she rants about it to you, you can listen and nod sympathetically - because it&#39;s certainly true that flames are unfair - and maybe find a way to carefully suggest that maybe her fic could use some improvements. And if she&#39;s not open to listen then, you can still drop it. So, good luck either way.</p>

            <p>I have a friend like that, too, only she writes Mary-Sues in original fiction. Her ideas definitely have merit, but the characters- both boys and girls, actually- are shallow and over-powerful. What I&#39;ve done is tentatively offer up some advice, and when she starts to get cold about it, I just let it drop.</p>

            <p>Sometimes the people who write these sorts of cliches can be very open to comments and quite willing to work to improve their stories, in which case I would suggest some combination of tactful doubt and politely pointing out flaws. In this case, however, since you say she gets defensive and lashes out at critics, I think you would be best off leaving it be. She&#39;s your friend, and it&#39;s even harder to give constructive criticism in that context; strangers are easier in that, if they fly into a rage about it, you can walk away and never talk to them again, but you can&#39;t do that here. <br><br>I realise that&#39;s not what you were after, but it seems to me like you feel it&#39;s your responsibility to make sure your friend&#39;s stories are as good as they can be; it&#39;s not. If she&#39;s asked you to beta her work, that&#39;s another issue - she&#39;d have to accept the honesty she asked for - but just approaching her and saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but your stories have problems&quot;? That&#39;s your initiative, and my advice would be not to do it. Let her write whatever she wants for now; everyone grows out of that phase eventually. <br><br>If you&#39;re going mad and desperate to do <i>something</i>, them naybe you could find some good fanfics for that fandom and suggest that she might enjoy reading them - and if she does, chat about those stories and all their good points, and let her see for herself how her own work doesn&#39;t measure up. I find this works better with touchy people, since they feel like they can fix the problems without other people knowing about them, which is often the most sore point with defensive writers.<br><br>Of course, you&#39;ll get other responses disagreeing with me, and there might indeed be a good way to talk to her about this, but I, personally, wouldn&#39;t. </p>

            <p>And I do.  Sedri is correct in this.  If your friend is that defensive, it may be best to leave it alone for the sake of the friendship.<br><br>However, if you still intend to talk to your friend about it, then here is what I would suggest.<br><br>1)Wait for them to ask you.  Very important.  They need to initiate the conversation.  They may ask, &quot;So, what did you think?&quot; or some other question about how you feel about the work.  If they don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t bring it up.<br><br>2)Be sure to emphasize that you think they have good story ideas.  Tell them that you really enjoy their stories, then dip you toe in the con-crit end of the pool.  The worst thing you can do is start with the negative.  It automatically puts people on the defensive, which you want to avoid.<br><br>3)If they seem receptive to change, offer to help.  That&#39;s what friends are for, after all.<br><br>4)If they are not receptive to change, <b>let it go</b>.  And who knows, she may come around eventually anyway.<br><br>-Phobos the advice guru</p>

            <p>Haha, judging from what the PPC concerns itself with, those stress-relief balls might be good to have.<br><br>To answer your questions:<br><br>I)Im generally involved with the Mass Effect and Warhammer fandoms on FF.net, though I have been an avid reader of LOTR (the books and some of the good fanworks), StarCraft, some of the works by real-life author Tom Clancy and I am currently reading a work by Mark Twain: &quot;A Recollection of the Life and Times of St Joan of Arc&quot; (or someting like that).<br><br>II) I have.

            <p>Hello, there. Um, I actually found the PPC Wiki completely by accident. I started looking through it (haven&#39;t read it all, but that&#39;s to be expected at this point). I also began reading the original series. I have to say, it&#39;s such a relief to see Mary Sues and badfics getting what they deserve (I&#39;ve seen some bad stuff; there are some stories that shouldn&#39;t be thought up, much less written down or posted on the internet for all to see). I decided it would be easier to just post and get it over with, since I&#39;ll probably be lurking for a while otherwise.<br><br>Anyway! My name is...not important. You can call me Raven. I am a girl. I am 18. The only world I dabble in is Anne McCaffrey&#39;s Dragonriders of Pern, but I mostly write original fiction. I love dragons, reading, and writing with a passion. And...that&#39;s pretty much it at this point.<br><br>So. Am I allowed to join? *hopeful*</p>

Any person who has proved their ability to write well and knows enough of the PPC rules and technicalities can write up a pair of agents after gaining Permission.

If you make mistakes now, think of them as learning experiences. :D <br><br></p>

I found the site from the section on Pern and sort of glommed on.) I&#39;ve almost completely lost hope for Pern fics, actually. I saw one a year or so ago on FF.net that I reviewed. It was awful. Bad writing, blatant Mary Sue (I don&#39;t even know if she was from another series or was an original; it was never explained), every canon character was OOC. But I was nice gave a long review of suggestions and helpful critique.

            <p>I don&#39;t mind my spin-offs being stalked. ^_^<br><br>Oh yes, all the new colors. To be honest, I did run a Weyr guild on Neopets for a while, and we did have extra colors and other AU stuff in order to actually get people to show up, but ours had normal names and at least an attempt at a scientific explanation (widespread retrovirus that affected the genes for pigmentation, and also mosaicism to allow for mottled colors). In comparison with the ones who had emerald, midnight, pink, sunset, etc., I still don&#39;t feel too bad about anything we had. &gt;.&gt; I wouldn&#39;t do it in a fic, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yeah, there&#39;s a distinct line between what you can do in an RP and what you can do in a fic. At least with a fic you don&#39;t have to worry about people not showing up to contribute (I&#39;ve had some experience with that; it was unpleasant). I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever go back to a roleplay Weyr. It just doesn&#39;t work. :(</p>

            <p>Oh dear! o.o I hadn&#39;t been back to my old Weyr in forever. It was on Gaiaonline. I just looked back at it; I think I was around 15, but that doesn&#39;t really excuse it. I&#39;m...slightly ashamed and quite embarrassed. I gave it up a while before it fell apart. It looks like no one&#39;s posted there in a year, though, so that&#39;s a blessing. I hope my sense of plot and logic has gotten better since then. &gt;.&gt; <a href="http://www.gaiaonline.com/guilds-home/dragonfire-dragonriders-of-pern-rp/g.7775/"><a href="http://www.gaiaonline.com/guilds-home/dragonfire-dragonriders-of-pern-rp/g.7775/">http://www.gaiaonline.com/guilds-home/dragonfire-dragonriders-of-pern-rp/g.7775/</a></a><br><br>Wow! You had a ton of people in there! I&#39;m impressed. (Haha! Impressed. XD) I could never get more than a dozen or so people, and it felt so empty. I ended up making more and more characters to play. Not a good idea... &gt;.&gt; And yet I still miss it. I guess it reminds me of a simpler time, when I actually had time to roleplay.</p>

            <p>Really it&#39;s just the characters with links who had players, and a lot of &#39;em were me and a few of the really good people I mentioned. The rest was me making up names to go with hatchlings who weren&#39;t Impressed by PCs.
