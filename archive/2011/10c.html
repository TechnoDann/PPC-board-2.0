            <p><b>WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS KINDA-SPOILERS</b><br><br>First things first. There&#39;s a lot about this story that is very good. Wait, check that. There&#39;s a lot about this story that is hilariously awesome. Two moments in particular stand out in my mind: when Aster&#39;s rant about the fade is overheard by a nameless wizard, and the &quot;Aster approves (+9)&quot; bit. I actually laughed out loud at that second one. Certainly not the most accessible bits for a general audience, but sometimes you&#39;ve got to do those fandom-specific shout-outs.<br><br>I also liked the interactions between Aster and Bendick. I&#39;m not just talking about the shipping bits, either. What really struck me personally was Aster having to explain what the PPC was to Bendick. The dialogue was great and the characterization was golden. This little exchange near the end of the second day was perhaps my favorite part of the whole mission:<br><br><i>&quot;And I think I now know what your PPC values in its agents.”<br><br>“Yeah?”<br><br>“Valor. Levity.” he paused. “Perhaps a bit of madness.”</i><br><br>That being said, there are two things that keep this mission from being really spectacular in my mind. First off is the post-ending sequence. You had this great dramatic battle with the Mary Sue at the end of the third day. A very gut-wrenching semi-bittersweet moment... and then the post-ending sequence wraps up the whole story with a big happy ribbon. Everything turned pretty much fine, which kinda bothered me. Not to a huge extent - I understand that killing off characters is to do, and goodness knows I&#39;ve used plot armor on my own characters before - but having a neat little conclusion to a big awesome mission doesn&#39;t quite gel together in tone.<br><br>The BIG thing that bothered me about this story is that it feels like a pretty typical Mary Sue mission even though it was said early on that Aster was on an Intelligence mission. Apart from a couple of stand-out bits - the special snarky CAD and the restriction on portals in particular - there wasn&#39;t really any practical difference between the way this mission was handled and most other DMS stories. The formula remained pretty much the same: agents follow the Sue, they rescue bit characters, they collect charges, they complain, and then they terminate the Sue.<br><br>As soon as I read that Aster was on an Intelligence detail, I was really looking forward to some spy-type stuff. But as the story went on, I became increasingly disappointed. I think you could have done some really cool stuff with Intelligence work. Instead, you wrote a DMS story - a great story, sure enough, but it still felt like a bit of a letdown.<br><br>Hope I didn&#39;t come off as too harsh. It&#39;s a great read and I&#39;m looking forward to what you tackle next.</p>

            <p>I see your crit and totally agree. What happened was that this mission floated away from what I originally thought it might be as I wrote it. Let me explain:<br><br>I wrote a pretty large portion of this as fully an Intelligence detail. It turned out very boring, and MST-like. I wanted to keep the sneaking around and observing idea in, so I kept it an &#39;Intelligence&#39; detail... but it became an assassination, because after stepping back, it was simply more entertaining to read.<br><br>Of course, Aster pretty much flubbed her punishment detail. She is not earning any points with the DIA, I promise. I found that idea to be a better seed for fun in later works  than just doing the punishment as ordered would be.<br><br>One thing I didn&#39;t have the time to actually include in this mission was that Lore was actually going to have a point where he persuades Aster to give up the intelligence detail and just kill it. Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t find an area where it fit in in the fic. I tried many scenes out, in different places, but none of them could manage much without breaking the pacing. Call it a &#39;I will try again next time&#39; moment: something that I wanted to include, but perhaps my skill did not permit... and I cut it out, because an awkward misplaced scene and ruined pacing would have hurt it more than the very slight inconsistency.<br><br>Also, Bendrick actually <i>was</i> going to die at Ostagar. Then as I realized he wasn&#39;t the problem, he was going to be air lifted out of there at the first possible convenience, to be part of an ESAS team.  Except, when I began to write him, I started to realize the justice of including him... and exactly the perfect end to the Sue. Unfortunately, it involved a potentially fatal situation for him, so to prelude his spin-off I needed to show him alive. So people don&#39;t ask me about using necromancy on Grey Wardens.<br><br>So yeah. Constructive crit all the way- I am very grateful. Part of getting better is seeing the flaws in my work... and these flaws won&#39;t happen next time. Eventually I will write a mission so perfect no one will ever have to write another mission ever again. 8Y</p>

            <p>I like Dragon Age missions. There&#39;s something about Dragon Age badfic that makes me go &quot;You have all these options and you still chose to mess with canon?! Rargh! Die!&quot; so I&#39;m happy to see missions taking care of them.<br><br>I found it interesting how Bendrick&#39;s reactions (shock, horror, loss) contrasted nicely with the Sue&#39;s complete lack of same.<br><br>And I am also aboard the Bendrick/Aster ship. <sup>^</sup></p>

            <p>Dragon Age as a continuum has some very strong themes and motifs: Death, sacrifice, and hard choices. As soon as Bendrick is broken from the Sue&#39;s control... he&#39;s a part of that canon. He brings it with him like a turtle with a shell. Not to say he can&#39;t be funny, or be part of PPC humor... but if the Sue spurns all of those options, Bendrick embodies them.<br><br>And it&#39;s kind of sad. You see what the Sue really does... in her disregard for everything, she also disregards things she claims to love.</p>

            <p>Missions to me are a chance to make goodfic out of badfic. Or at least make less!bad fic out of badfic. Part of that is showing people around the canon even if they don&#39;t know it.

            <p>First an interlude, that takes place immediately before the mission. If you have any ideas as to the identity of the two agents, I will be happy to edit them in.

I have tried to edit it down, but the original fic is around 140,000 words long and I wanted to preserve at least some of the feeling I had while reading it. So if you read the mission and feel like my agents are wading through thousands of words worth of horrible grammar and plotholes, then that is at least somewhat intentional. I am not aiming for boring, but I am trying to convey the feeling that this is dreary and really horrible. Or in other words: I had to suffer through this, now it&#39;s your turn. <sup><sup><br>Anyway,</sup></sup> I promise that my next mission will not be this long.<br><br><a href="http://rc170.wordpress.com/2011/10/30/the-making-of-a-queen-aka-the-raison-detre/"><a href="http://rc170.wordpress.com/2011/10/30/the-making-of-a-queen-aka-the-raison-detre/">http://rc170.wordpress.com/2011/10/30/the-making-of-a-queen-aka-the-raison-detre/</a></a><br><br>Loot:<br><br>Insta-popcorn.

            <p>That was definitely a long, long, long, long, long, long mission.  I started reading around 1 P.M. and just finished it after getting home from work, at 1:30 A.M.!  That said, I think you managed to prevent it from growing boring.  You kept the pacing moving forward, introducing each new section of problems in turn and letting your agents react, then moving on.  Kudos on slogging through the whole thing!<br><br>One nitpick that I, as a volunteer zookeeper, must make:  A couple of times, you refer to snake poison.  Technically, when poison comes from an animal, it should be called venom.  (Poison is more for man-made chemicals or stuff that comes out of plants, fungi, etc.)</p>

            <p>Thanks!<br><br>I think Mittens is keeping the wand as a souvenir. As for the weapons, there are still two longswords, a falchion and a rapier and dagger set up for the taking.

            <p>What exactly is Sue-length hair? Is it a particular length? A length that might be implausible in the circumstances, like a chemotherapy patient having waist-length hair a year later?

A length that&#39;s just there for the pretty factor, a la &quot;her sunshine-golden curls swayed past her hips&quot;?<br><br>Being that I and a few of my OCs have hip- or thigh-length hair, I had to ask.</p>

            <p>It’s not meant to be an accurate measurement. It this specific case, the charge was not because she had hair almost down to her hips, but because it was much longer than Sarah’s in the movie. You could say that she only had hair that long, due to being a Sue, not because there was any basis for it in the canon.</p>

            <p>See, the major issue at play here is this: comics are commonly considered a visual medium, while fanfiction is a written medium. Trying to spork the one in the context of the other just doesn&#39;t work as well as you&#39;d think it might unless you&#39;re really good at stuff. It&#39;s the same reason why printing music lyrics in a comic doesn&#39;t work: if you&#39;re in one medium, it&#39;s jarring for us when you suddenly switch out of that medium. So I think comics in general are something you should try to stay away from with a PPC mission.<br><br>Now, NSFW fanfics? To my understanding, <i>that</i> is fair game.</p>

            <p>The problem is, how would you go about sporking something like that without posting pornographic pictures in your mission?  I think it would be best to avoid that sort of thing.  So, my vote is for not sporking something like that.<br><br>Also, people have tried to spork comics in the past, but it never really goes very well, from what I remember.</p>

            <p>Your agents have a good dynamic about them. They have a few good bits of back and forth, which is something I always like with agents. I also enjoyed how you gave Nathan a distinctive voice. Too often I&#39;ve had to reread bits of mission because the characters sound so alike I can&#39;t discern who&#39;s talking.<br><br>The one major thing that concerned me was the ending. I didn&#39;t really understand what happened. The whole thing seemed very jumpy, very rushed. Jumpiness is okay with heavy action scenes, but if you push it too far the entire thing becomes nigh unreadable.<br><br>Also, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me, but the text for you story turns completely grey part way through. It&#39;s probably just an html error or something, but it does make it a little hard to read (particularly on a white background.)<br><br>I look forward to your next mission.</p>

            <p>A few months ago, VM posted a thread in which she cried out against the misuse of the term &#39;Mary Sue&#39;, and put forth her own defenition of one. This resulted in a constructive discussion (which I added little to, I&#39;m afraid) in which Boarders put forth their own defenitions of what a &#39;Sueish&#39; character is.<br><br>So now, if you don&#39;t mind, I would like to do the inverse: What defines a Good OC? I mostly agree with VM&#39;s defenition (though I failed to realize it for some time), that the crucial quality is <i>depth</i>, that its okay for characters to be powerful and beautiful as long as they have personality and character (is this redundant?)<br><br>Giving others a place is also a plus point. In VM&#39;s thread, people have mentioned that even though Drizzt Do&#39; Urden from <i>Forgotten Realms</i> is a Canon Stu, he&#39;s a mild one or even well-written (though <i>not</i> because he is a Stu). While I only read <i>Exile</i> and <i>Siege of Darkness</i>, I think that Drizzt is bearable because of the proximity of characters like Belwar, Cattie-Brie, and Buenor, who are each allowed their own intresting personalities and stories. </p>

            <p>My idea of a good OC is sort of a combination of what Tungsten_Monk and Phobos said.  An OC should fill a gap in the world - a role that conceivably exists within the canon&#39;s guidelines, that hasn&#39;t been filled by a canon character.  A continuum like <i>Doctor Who</i>, say, is very conducive to OC protagonists, because the Doctor is always hopping around the universe meeting new people; a continuum like, I don&#39;t know, <i>Homestuck</i> is very <i>non</i>-conducive to OCs, because there are a very specific number of people who are even capable of being alive during the story and we have been very well introduced to all of them.  (Admittedly, I am a canon purist; if it contradicts canon at all, I&#39;m generally predisposed to dislike it.  I always prefer the &quot;plausible deniability&quot;-type stories - it could have happened in canon, we just didn&#39;t hear about it.)<br><br>On the other hand, even if the OC blends seamlessly in with the world, if s/he is flat, unconvincing, and canon-warping as a person, s/he&#39;s still not a good OC.  Being a plausible, well-rounded, three-dimensional character, with actual depth, with a history, with hopes and fears and strengths and weaknesses and goals and her/his own and legitimate reason for existing, is the most important consideration when writing a character, whether in fanfiction or original fiction.  Being beautiful and powerful can be part of that description, but there must be a believable reason for it.<br><br>TL;DR - Agreeing that the most important thing for a character of any stripe is depth.  Fanfiction just has the extra challenge of having to fit in with an already-established world.</p>

            <p>I was about to say this myself. A good OC, or a good character for that matter, does not exist for the furthering of a plot or some sort of self-indulgence. They exist to make a point that is separate from themselves.<br><br>Good exploration of a canon universe comes when the author has love for it. The author has to have some sort of ability to see the world around the character, and not just the characters themselves. Therefore, more context to base an OC on. Sues steal the spotlight and belittle their surroundings for the sake of wish-fulfillment. That is not exploration. That is just yick.</p>

            <p>I pretty much agree with everyone so far. All of these things are necessary in fanfic: sharing the spotlight with the canon characters, adding something, being a good character in general.<br><br>To me, it adds up to plausibility and impact. I have to believe that character could be there as they are and do what they do, and get away with it in a canonical context. If the people around the OC don&#39;t react in a way that makes sense for them, then I can&#39;t believe in the OC.<br><br>There&#39;s obviously some leeway here, since no one who isn&#39;t the author of a canon can write those characters in exactly the same way, and the presence of an OC in and of itself may give them cause to react differently (in an AU, say), but it all still has to make sense generally, if not in the specifics of word choice or writing style. The OC shouldn&#39;t by its presence alone contradict known canon—or if it does, the change(s) need to bloody well be explained, preferably as part of the story. &quot;Snape has a daughter in this story, k?&quot; is not an explanation, but &quot;What would happen if Snape slept with someone after Lily died and had a child?&quot; could make for an interesting story. It would probably have to be about Snape in order to work... once it&#39;s about the OC, the potential for problems increases. Not that it couldn&#39;t be from the OC&#39;s point of view, though. The POV character isn&#39;t necessarily the one the story is about.<br><br>... I am now rambling. Guess that&#39;s enough of that. TL;DR, anything can be done well, but an OC&#39;s existence has to be plausible and have an impact that makes sense.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Your post brought to mind a question that I have often wondered about.  Why is it that few people write stories using a canon world, but not canon characters?  You could easily write a story in which a group of characters stop a plot which would have ended with the Fellowship of the Ring being caught in a trap and dead.  It takes nothing away from the Fellowship, they wouldn&#39;t even be aware that this had happened.<br><br>Why don&#39;t more people do this?</p>

I would like to see more &#39;good OCs in a canon world&#39; stories, but I&#39;m not holding out much hope for that.)<br><br>...because there is a stigma against original characters in fanfiction. The fear of making/being labeled as a Sue or Stu is part of that bias, but is not the only thing.<br><br>One of the larger problems OC characters face is that of unfamiliarity. People generally like subjects with which they already have some experience. New characters or ideas contain an element of risk; if I, the reader, go through the story and find that I don&#39;t like this new character wandering around this otherwise familiar world, then I have basically wasted my time. It is far easier to look up stories about a character I already know that I like. To put it simply, I&#39;ve put in the time with the canonical characters. They&#39;ve earned my liking them, whereas OCs are immediately faced with an uphill battle for the audience&#39;s approval.<br><br>Closely related to unfamiliarity is the idea of ease. Creating a well-developed original character is a difficult and potentially time-consuming task, whereas borrowing a canonical is quite simple. Most fanfiction writers aren&#39;t out to make the next grandiose epic tale of whatever. Writing is a hobby moreso than a calling to the vast majority of folks.<br><br>The SparkNotes version: good OC stories in a canonical world are hard to write. People like easy stuff.</p>

            <p>I think that the key to making a good OC is to make a good character.  For a good character, you need to answer four questions (bonus points if you know where I stole these questions from.)  They are:<br><br><b>Who are you?</b> (Everything from name and age to sexual orientation, religion, and general outlook on life)<br><br><b>What do you want?</b> (Do you want to avenge your father?  Make some money?  Live in peace?  This should be easy.  What do you want <i>right now</i>)<br><br><b>Why are you here?</b> (How did you get where you are emotionally, physically, intellectually, spiritually, et ceterally?)<br><br><b>Where are you going?</b>  (Long term goals and dreams.  As long term as the character is likely to think.)<br><br>These four questions do not guarantee a good character, but they do help you along the way.  It is not a bad idea to answer these questions with every character you have.  Specific detail isn&#39;t important; I don&#39;t need to know when you character lost their first tooth, unless it is important to the story.  Also, everything you come up with for answers doesn&#39;t need to make it into the story, but it will fuel the story through your characters&#39; choices.<br><br>Please note that the answers to these questions can and should change through the course of a story.  What you want can change very quickly, the others take more time, usually.<br><br>I have have a post that I moved to my new blog that talks about the concept of the <a href="http://phoboslair.wordpress.com/2011/10/29/repost-the-protagonist/">protagonist</a>, which doesn&#39;t talk about this concept, but talks about things that are necessary, above and beyond the questions, to make a good lead character.<br><br>-Phobos, who is testing a lesson plan on the Board</p>

            <p>To me, the ultimate consideration when writing an OC (in a fanfic, anyway) has been whether or not this character specifically adds--in a positive way--to the universe, rather than changing or removing something that has already been established about it. <br><br>That&#39;s a little obtuse, so let me give you an example. I&#39;m currently writing GI Joe fanfiction (I know, I know--mock away), and one of my stories does indeed center on an original character. I wanted to use her to get a unique perspective on the rest of the Joe team. I <i>could</i> create a new special branch of GI Joe, headed by my character . . . Or I could fit her into a role that the canon universe implies but never defines, that of quartermaster and base cook. A role that already exists, but was never filled. No canon characters or circumstances need to be specifically altered for her to exist, she adds the perspective of the cook and perpetual onlooker, and everything works.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PPC! Always good to see another brony.<br><br>As for the grim MLP tumblr accounts, that&#39;s really a matter of opinion.<br><br>In my opinion, no. We go after badfic. More to the point, we go after badfic written by authors who clearly either didn&#39;t care or didn&#39;t do research or use logic or bother to check if they spelled &quot;Hogwarts&quot; correctly. Grimdark does not necessarily equal badfic, even for a show like My Little Pony. I&#39;ve seen those tumblr accounts, and while they are extremely grimdark, they are not badfic. The art is very well done, and it&#39;s pretty clear to me that the authors/artists put time and effort into their creations.<br><br>(I&#39;m one of the few who disputed the necessity of sporking Cupcakes; while the sporking was incredibly funny and entertaining and got us our first pony agent, I personally didn&#39;t consider its grimdark nature grounds for declaring it a badfic.)<br><br>Like I said, this is all a matter of opinion; this is mine, and everyone is free to dispute it or agree with it to their heart&#39;s content.</p>

            <p>Whew, finally managed to stumble across a fic from the Unclaimed Badfic which I think I might have a better chance of sporking then my previous failure of an attempt.<br><br>Link: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6868352/5/Aragorn_and_the_angeli"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6868352/5/Aragorn_and_the_angeli">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6868352/5/Aragorn_and_the_angeli</a></a><br><br>As the summery in the Unclaimed Badfiction page outlines, there are multiple wrongs here, including the dreaded (BUM BUM BUUUUUM) Mary Sue! Unlike the prior example, the errors made are a bit more clear cut and recognisable. <br><br>Heck, the author even goes off the rails at the readers after several people pointed out that the main lead was a Sue; this will not have any bearing in the mission apart from slight turbulance and it seems like the author may/may not have recognised the faults in her writing (I can only conjecture).<br><br>Comments?

            <p>As for the last one, if it&#39;s on the list of unclaimed badfics (now on the claimed list because you moved it there) it should not have already been sporked. Or if it has been, then that mission is seriously lost for good.<br><br>From what I can tell, the badfic is truly and honestly horrible and the author has shown no interest in listening to constructive criticism, so there&#39;s really no reason not to spork it.<br><br>So go for it! Try it out, see what works. Get stuck and get yourself unstuck. Get yourself muddy, is what I want to say. Good luck.</p>

            <p>Well, to be honest, all of my knee-jerk responses would be horrible, seeing as fatality rates are high, and having a Xenomorph after me isn&#39;t something I want. (Yes, even if they gave me the cool armor and the gun with the awesome sound effect).<br><br>Probably... My Little Pony. It has to be the most safe place I can think of, that still has enough to do and doesn&#39;t seem like I would go crazy from it. The biggest plus, to me, is that is genuinely looks like an amazing place to live. Well, that and you get to go to one of Pinkie Pie&#39;s parties. <br><br>And, Discworld would be a second, for uh... other reasons. Needless to say, it would be fun there, but probably a lot more lethal. And no matter how fun it may be to visit Anhk-Morpork, it is STILL Ankh-Morpork, and thus bad things could easily happen. </p>

            <p>There are several fantasy fandoms I&#39;d like to visit, but I&#39;m not sure retiring to any of them is a good idea.  I&#39;m very nearsighted with a family history of other eye problems ranging from glaucoma to spontaneous retinal detachment.  I need a good eye doctor available.<br><br>This unfortunately knocks Pern out of the running as well.  Unless AIVAS trained a few Healers in eye surgery before he shut down -- I haven&#39;t kept up with her son&#39;s novels.<br><br>Star Trek would be a good option.  There&#39;s no question about medical science being able to keep me seeing.  The Federation is portrayed as having gone beyond money; most likely I could spend my remaining years doing historical research or something else fun instead of worrying about finances.<br><br>There&#39;s several planets in Doctor Who that would probably work out as well.  I&#39;d just have to see if they&#39;re scheduled for Dalek, Cyberman, or other nasty visitors.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to have to say My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.<br><br>Think about it. Stable economy and government, benevolent physical deities in charge who are completely willing to acknowledge and listen to the needs of the common people, environmentally sound technology and energy, minimal racism that is halted by reasoning and common sense, and magic. Despite this, it&#39;s still exciting, what with the dragons and manticores and infrequent attacks by power-hungry entities, conflicts that are all resolved by the power of friendship. Or one of the aforementioned benevolent physical deities. Plus it would be so awesome to be a talking pony.<br><br>I guess the one drawback would be the mandatory vegetarianism, but I&#39;d say that&#39;s a fair trade of economic and political stability, world peace, and such.</p>

            <p>Specifically, after the finale.  While we don&#39;t get a particularly clear view of what happens after the show ends, it seems there&#39;s still some number of surviving Others on the Island, and people don&#39;t seem to be dying left and right anymore.  It would be a nice, quiet place with few neighbors to retire to, and there&#39;s always a chance of immortality down the line.  I just have to avoid that one polar bear.</p>

            <p>Hello, assassins, sporkers, and sundry. I have returned from the self-imposed exile of employment and not having a reliable internet connection (specifically the &quot;not having an internet connection&quot; bit.) While the events of my life aren&#39;t particularly interesting, I figure a few bullet points might be in order just so everyone knows what I&#39;ve been up to. In the last two-ish months, I have:<br><br>- Gotten a job.<br>- Moved to North Dakota.<br>- Been homeless for about a month.<br>- Got an apartment.<br>- Got another job.<br>- Moved into that apartment.<br>- Gotten an internet connection.<br>- Made this post.<br><br>I pretty much have no time for anything during the work week, so no NaNo for me this year, but I&#39;m going to be trying to get back into PPC type stuff over the weekends. Yes, Wozz, if you&#39;re reading this, I haven&#39;t forgotten, I have an update planned this weekend, sorry about the excessive delay.</p>

            <p>I have a problem: I love to read, but don&#39;t have a whole lot of time. I also walk to and from school, which totals anywhere from half an hour to one-and-a-half hours a day; and I hate walking without anything to think about. So, I listen to audiobooks on my cheap little mp3 player. And then sometimes I get caught up in the story, and listen to them some more while I clean the house or finish yet another afghan...<br><br>Since audiobooks cost a lot of money, my library is the only real source of books I have, which is cool because I&#39;ve made my way through just about all the &quot;classics&quot; (except for the ones that are about nothing but romance), and a lot of best-sellers.<br><br>But now I&#39;m running out of library! My library&#39;s collection of mp3 audiobooks is getting more and more sparse... and I still want more!<br><br>I&#39;m hoping you guys might know about some resource--online, library preferably, either a low fee or free--where I could get more audiobooks. I&#39;m not running out of paper books, thankfully; but I&#39;m also not going to be silly enough to try dodging traffic with my nose in a book. :)<br><br>I&#39;m looking for online libraries, mostly--book-lending services, generally; or public libraries with online audiobook databases like mine, that let you buy a library card even if you&#39;re not a resident.<br><br>Help?</p>

            <p>Have you heard of <a href="http://librivox.org/">Librivox</a>? They have several thousand books, and are adding around 100 more per month. All the books are in the public domain.  Some readers are better than others, and books that have a single reader are generally preferable (by me) compared to ones that have multiple readers.<br><br>Readers I have rather enjoyed are Kara Shallenberb and especially John Greenman, who reads Mark Twain works. My husband has been listening to his readings for about 15 hours per week for almost two years and has only recently ran out of recordings.<br><br>I had a couple of other links for audiobooks, but it looks like I lost them when my laptop died. I think I got them from people in the PPC, so maybe we&#39;ll both get some more good ones.</p>

            <p>I see short story collections! I&#39;ve listened to Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn about five times each but the last time I remember reading any of his short stories I was in high school... there was this really ridiculous satirical one about a bunch of people who got stranded and voted on who to eat, or something; and one about insect scientists who didn&#39;t realize humans were sentient, and one about a guy who went to heaven by flying through space and found out it was like a huge version of the living world...<br><br>*pokes around, bookmarks site*</p>

            <p>You know, you&#39;re right; big-city public libraries do all have web sites, and I could just go through the major ones until I found somebody that sells library cards to non-residents. I found the Chicago public library charges $100/year, which is not unreasonable but still more than I&#39;d like to pay in one go; maybe I&#39;ll find a better bargain. On the other hand, less than $10/month really is a good deal; so I could save up for something like that if they all want that much.</p>

            <p>I actually do know the canon, although it&#39;s been a while since I read the books. Used to have Silk as a lust object, beacuse he was cool and funny.

            <p>My only problem with finding a LO in that setting is Eddings&#39; habit of pairing up every character he can.  I have problems with going after someone who&#39;s &quot;taken&quot;.  I would, however, <em>love</em> to get Belgarath into storyteller mode with a digital recorder running :) .<br><br>The pillows and lantern are yours.<br><br>Right now, the only weapon Lynn has is that machete.

            <p>Ah, yes. But Silk wasn&#39;t paired up until the Malloreon, I think. I&#39;ll admit I was slightly miffed, when Velvet came in and just swept him off his feet.<br><br>Oh, is Lynn in luck! The mission I&#39;m working on right now has a whole chamber filled with a non-canonical collection of every kind of sword and spear and whatever. I&#39;ll write in a looting scene.</p>

            <p>I had a lot of fun reading this mission! I didn&#39;t know the canon, but it was explained well enough where I didn&#39;t feel confused at all.

            <p>This was a <i>lot</i> of fun to read.  I had never even heard of this canon, but your descriptions were detailed enough that I never felt confused by what was going on.  You really got your love of the canon across to the reader.  Excellent use of the Filing Lantern mid-mission, and I love the pole&#39;s arctic climate swooping in to erase wannabe!Arabia at the end (although I wish we could have seen more of that).<br><br>I noticed one typo, during the charge list:<br>&quot;&#39;You are charged with turning a servant Super-Deformed in a non-anime continua.&quot;<br>Continua should be continuum, since you&#39;re just talking about one here.</p>

            <p>Hi! Welcome to the PPC. <br><br>Here are a few handy links that will answer most of your questions, if you have any: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_The_Board">an FAQ about the Board</a>, a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies">general Newbie FAQ</a>, and finally, a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_to_the_PPC"> Guide to the PPC.</a> If you have any that aren&#39;t addressed, my email&#39;s visible with clicking my name. <sup>_<sup><br><br>Don&#39;t</sup></sup> forget to read TOS, and the spinoffs, too. <br><br>Also, while everyone here are fans of something or other, obsessive 24/7 fanboying and fangirling does get annoying. Please keep that down to a minimum, because it&#39;s not respectful when it&#39;s constantly done or when not everyone shares the same interests.</p>

Expect no less from this tough chick, she will give Peter a run for his money, and she has a particular dislike of Susan, no idea why she just seems snotty to her.&quot;<br><br>Brand new, one chapter so far. And we&#39;ve already got rape, abuse, angst, complete implausibility (see below), a bizarre bracelet that has magical/sci-fi properties in World One, imp jobs (a part-time weight trainer at sixteen? I find that hard to believe), slave labor, bad stereotypes, and excessive swearing and f-bombs.<br><br>Conversation between Lysa and Silver (her bracelet):<br><br><i>[You really need to report this to authorities; Foster mothers are not supposed to engage in activity harmful to the youths being fostered.]<br><br>{Right, I know, but I am only sixteen, therefore legally not an adult, and only the money somehow left to my name, with no relatives having need of me. What else can I do? She will get hers when the time is right}</i><br><br>Pardon me, but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s NOT the way the system works.<br><br>But the worst part in my mind? The next-to-last paragraph.<br><br>&quot;My last thoughts: What in the hell is this? This only happens in stories that are read online… next thing I&#39;ll probably know is that I&#39;ve been dropped into Twilight or Narnia or Harry Potter.&quot;<br><br>I have no words. I&#39;m not alone in thinking this is bad, right?</p>
