            <p>Agent Alison has no respect for authority, has a short temper, she is homicidal and amoral and, as such, has no problem killing and maiming, and lives by the motto &quot;life is short, so why the **** not.&quot;  So, my question is this: what is stopping her from maiming/killing anyone in the PPC?  Especially the Flowers, who are disliked by many of the Agents.<br><br>And so, I am concerned that, perhaps, she is a bomb waiting to go off...and I don&#39;t think we will be waiting long.</p>

            <p>What you&#39;ve said is true.  None of these things, with the possible exception of amoral, are bad traits for a PPC agent to have.  The issue I had was not with any one thing.  It was with all of them together.</p>

            <p>She won&#39;t maim or kill anyone in the PPC because they pulled her out of her personal hell- i.e., Panem- and she&#39;s forever grateful to everyone in the PPC for that. I probably should have mentioned that to her, the PPC is a massive improvement on what she&#39;s used to. <br><br>But if you feel it&#39;s needed, I&#39;ll alter her personality to be less dangerous.</p>

            <p>I did rather agree with Phobos, there, so I&#39;m glad you took his critique to heart. I&#39;ll take a look at your request when I get the chance. And thank you-- it&#39;s always cool when people can look at their own stuff with a crit-ish eye. Makes me feel like you&#39;re a lot less likely to write a Sue, and that you&#39;ll be able to take responses with grace if someone does have a sticking point.</p>

            <p>Hi PPC! I just joined and the guidline thing said that I should introduce myself. So again, hi. Last night, I stayed up untill 3 or so in the morning reading kingdom hearts missions. Stories. Things.<br><br> Right so anyways, today I was reading the wiki, and came across the Gargoyles Mary Sue test thing. I only got to the first section when I became distressed.<br><br> See, for as far back as I could remember, I&#39;ve sort of had an imaginary alias, named Mimkana. She, well, was always sort of a Mary Sue I realize now. She was who I wanted to be, brave, good, a hero. As I got older, I started to refine the character a bit, she got guilty about things that weren&#39;t her fault, stopped having super magical powers that could do anything and started using swords instead.<br><br>But what I do, present tense mind you, is I take characters from stories, and go on adventures with them. Mimkana is usually with them and is usually kicking ass. Now I KNOW she is a Mary Sue, so I suppose I feel guilty for making her that way. But I wont let go of a character that has been in my head since kindergarten, maybe earlier.<br><br>I want to know if it&#39;s okay that I unknowingly made a Mary Sue and that if its okay that even though I know now what she is, that I will still keep her MarySueish.</p>

            <p>I too made a Stu (Who didn&#39;t in his past?), yet I managet to create a good character out of it with some work. It&#39;s Agent Sergio Turbo, if you want to check him out.<br><br>The old Sergio (character) was a detective and amazingly good rally car driver at freaking TEN years old, had nearly perfect aim, could use ant weapon and drive any vehicle, et cetera.<br><br>The current Agent is, well, a PPC Agent of an actually reasonable age (18 at the beginning of the spinoff), has a reasdonable aim (still on the good side, but nothing spectacular), and the only exception to &quot;normal&quot; skills is the &quot;fighter pilot&quot; thing, a little bit needed as one of my &quot;patrol&quot; continua is Ace Combat.<br><br>So, with a little work, Mimkana can reform and even become an Agent. You already did the most difficul thing, recognizing her as a Sue. The rest will be a piece of cake.</p>

            <p>First off: Welcome to the PPC, have a seat and enjoy the insanity.<br><br>Second on: I have, in the privacy of my head, created a few Mary Sue type characters. I would be surprised to discover a person with an active imagination who has never imagined a more perfect and popular version of themself.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with characters who Kick Ass, even ones who do so in multiple continuums. These characters, while they likely have at least a few traits in common with Mary Sues, are not neccesarily Mary Sues.

            <p>I&#39;ve written/imagined at least half a dozen poorly characterized OCs and two author inserts, even after joining the PPC and constantly being told, &quot;MARY SUE = BAD&quot; twice a week. <br><br>I just don&#39;t publish them.

            <p>We love having new people!<br><br>As for the whole Mary Sue-ish aspect... there&#39;s actually quite a divide in the PPC about what constitutes a well-written Sue. Some of us here do in fact believe that it is entirely possible to write a Mary Sue character who is actually pretty interesting to read about to other people (though some would argue that she stops really being a Sue once you get there). I know one person who once wrote a character with a ton of God-mod Sue powers that she acquired over the course of a fic, but the powers allowed for a very nuanced characterization, and that was for the better.<br><br>I guess the optimist in me says that you could probably keep some of the powers, but make her characterization/reaction to said powers interesting. And when all else fails, hey, Sues stop being Sues when their flaws are explored a little further.<br><br>Anyhow... Here, have some Shostakovich for the road:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2W8kGdCwmA&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL30ADF3BB551A1AF3"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2W8kGdCwmA&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL30ADF3BB551A1AF3">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2W8kGdCwmA&amp;amp;playnext=1&amp;amp;list=PL30ADF3BB551A1AF3</a></a></p>

            <p>And yeah, I think most of us have been there. There&#39;s no reason to be ashamed about it. {= ) There&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with a kickass female character who goes on adventures, even with canon characters, provided she doesn&#39;t break said characters or the world while she&#39;s doing it. As galenfea says, how people react to the character and how easily she attains her goals is a big part of what makes a Sue, far more than what abilities she has.<br><br>As for me, I put <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Jennifer_Robinson">my old avatar</a> through character boot camp by putting her in the PPC—specifically FicPsych, where she&#39;s part of a team and has bosses, and is not allowed to be the center of attention and get her way all the time, and even the good things aren&#39;t perfect. Plus, she can only &quot;fix&quot; the canon characters to be as they are in canon; no redeeming the antiheroes on the side. It&#39;s done a world of good, I think. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>What exactly is that? I think I could put my character there for a short while. It wouldn&#39;t disrupt the universe I made, It would be interesting, and frankly after I stopped reading at 3 am I started having fantasies where a version of Mimkana actually became aware of PPC&#39;s existence.</p>

            <p>FicPsych is the abbreviation used for the Department of Fictional Psychology, which is responsible for getting canon characters back to themselves after particularly horrible badfic, when neuralyzation just wouldn&#39;t quite cut it. For instance, in my last mission (co-written with Tungsten Monk), Aragorn and Gandalf had all their strength and wits sapped out of them by a particularly evil Stu-wraith, and just erasing their memories wouldn&#39;t fix that.<br><br>FicPsych also looks after agents and new recruits if circumstances warrant, but it&#39;s not their primary function. I should clarify that my character Jenni was never a patient; she works there, and that&#39;s been pretty therapeutic for her as a character by itself. If you want to have Mimkana run into her or any of the other nurses I write sometime, just drop me a line. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think FicPsych goes about wiping people&#39;s memories under false pretenses, which is what you seem to be suggesting. I can see them neuralyzing an agent if the agent were desperate enough to sign a lot of paperwork beforehand, but generally I think the use of neuralyzers or memory-wiping spells and such is restricted to canon characters, and then only to remove the memories of things that didn&#39;t actually happen as far as the canon is concerned. One reason, I think, is that it would be cheating the agent of a chance at character development to just excise something causing that much trouble. The Narrative Laws would not approve.<br><br>If you&#39;re looking for a random accident with a neuralyzer, though, there are plenty of ways to contrive one, not necessarily involving FicPsych at all. That could be fun.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>First of all, welcome!<br><br>Secondly, I feel your pain. I also created a character who was a much awesomer version of myself when I was younger, and she went on adventures with all my favourite fictional characters. She was the daughter of a fighter pilot (Biggles, if anyone&#39;s familiar with the series) and he often took her along on his missions, where she made herself useful as a radio/radar operator, navigator and occasional medic. She was eleven (my age at the time). In years since then of actively hunting out Sues, I have never seen a worse example.<br><br>I still write that character. She&#39;s still named after me, still speaks numerous languages fluently, still kicks ass and is still a trained pilot and the daughter of a WW2 fighter pilot, so she&#39;s still Suish (she regularly scores as a bad Sue in litmus tests). However, I feel that she&#39;s made less of a Sue within her context because of the way others react to her. For example, I recently wrote her in a story where she screwed up and miscalculated several situations, got in trouble for her mistakes and attitude and just didn&#39;t have everything go her way. Others may disagree, but I think that makes her less of a Sue.<br><br>So I&#39;d say that it&#39;s certainly fine that you once created a Sue (I&#39;m pretty confident that most people here can say the same) and it&#39;s also OK that you won&#39;t drop her (I absolutely understand emotional connection to an old character) and that she may not be as Suish as she seems on paper depending on how you write her :)</p>

            <p>You had me worried, popping in on the wiki with nary an introduction.<br><br>Well, nice to meet you. As others have probably said, it&#39;s not the authors that we find objectionable but their work... many of us too wrote badfic when we were younger, and grew out of it.<br><br>The Badness is merely a passing state: a transient phenomenon of immediate ego, inexperience, or laziness. Or all three. Often the ulterior motives badfic authors have are not ill will, but merely obliviousness to their own unfortunate subtexts and trampling of canon.<br><br>Of course, if a badfic writer goes on to prove themselves to be a thoroughly unpleasant person, like anybody we&#39;ll all probably groan with disdain and move on with our lives.<br><br>But nice to meet you!<br><br>Have a hat. It is knit of the finest of pelts harvested from Cute Animal Friends. It is guaranteed to keep your ears nice and insulated in the darkest, most soul-shatteringly cold of badfic.</p>

            <p>Greetings, new friend.  I&#39;m glad our community is interesting to you, and I hope you&#39;ll be sticking around for a while.<br><br>One thing I would like to bring up about our Wiki: it would be best if the number of links to TV Tropes was limited to very few.  There isn&#39;t anything wrong with TVT, but we are not that site.  We would prefer that our Wiki stand on its own merits as much as possible.<br><br>Also, I see you&#39;ve made another post just above this one.  New posts push old ones off the Board into oblivion, so it would have been better to add it onto this thread instead.  In the future, just keep in mind that we want to avoid double-posting, please.</p>

            <p>(Worth: about $.02 Canadian)<br><br>I, generally being the quiet sort who sits in a corner with a laptop or notebook, get to hear a lot of people talked about behind their backs. There&#39;s nothing quite so worry-inducing as leaving the room. <br><br>Personally, I would much rather be told that my writing skills need work, up-front, rather than have people go to lengths to coddle my feelings and then laugh behind my back. (She thinks she can ~*write*~!)

For reference, the first one is <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The_Moment_It_Began">The Moment It Began</a>, the one I found on my own; decent, but not Awesome, capital A. The one July linked me to was <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6306296/1/The_Apprentice">The Apprentice</a>, which is Awesome, capital A-- but also incomplete, at the moment. I suppose I could go search for an LJ comm, or a forum on the Pit, but as that&#39;s usually more miss than hit, I was hoping you guys might have a closer idea.</p>

            <p>Honestly?  I&#39;m also looking forward to finding out more.  I&#39;ve really only thought up to this point with regards to character development, and I&#39;m not entirely sure what direction I&#39;m going to go with Drew at this point.  Well, I <i>do</i> have a few things planned, such as a slow degredation into insanity, but others, like a potential cure, I haven&#39;t thought about in the slightest.<br><br>Quite frankly, I like this position.

How should I go about this?<br><br>2. How do I know what parts of the fanfic to put in my story? In the missions that ive read a few lines of the fic are put down in bold, so how do I figure out which ones?<br><br>3. Would someone be willing to help me out with the story? Please? I&#39;m sure i&#39;ve missed stuff in it, I started to loose focus by the time I got to the fourth and final chapter.<br><br>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Your questions are actually a good example of why there is a waiting period between joining the board and asking for permission to write missions. During that time you can read missions others have written. Be sure to also check out some of the badfic the appears in these missions (PPCers that post on LJ often provide links to the badfic). Then you can see what bits of fic are quoted in the missions, which are paraphrased and which bits are left out to make everyone&#39;s lives a lot simpler.<br><br>The real answer to quetion no 2 is: if you don&#39;t know which bits of the badfic to quote, you are not ready yet to write missions.</p>

Maybe next time. :D<br><br>Heh, I think I&#39;ll stick with calling Cadmar by the physical gender for now. It make it easier, for me at least, to remember that Cadmar is currently female.

            <p>...after all that, Florestan will have to make an appearance in your next interlude. You know, provide some holding material for Maria... Unfortunately I won&#39;t be available to do a dual writing session until the 21st. Aside from the fact I&#39;m still traipsing around Siena at the moment (and let&#39;s not also forget that the Palio is happening in two days, which is when things will get absolutely insane there), the hotel&#39;s internet is really not very good, so we can&#39;t co-work on a googledoc with any reliability. So unfortunately, we&#39;ll have to wait a bit. Though, I could potentially e-mail you a couple lines to get us started with that. That shouldn&#39;t be too tough, I think.<br><br>Extremely entertaining mission. Especially the whole trip around Europe part that rounded out the mission.<br><br>And wow, some of the things that Sue did... Just wow. I can see why you were all so pissed off about that. Yeah, crazy times are had.<br><br>Hm... In the recruitable OC&#39;s bit... I&#39;ve been formulating starting another response center with another group of peeps to cover some of the stuff F&amp;E can&#39;t cover but that I really want to cover really badly. So yeah... I think I&#39;ll take Cindy if she&#39;s not taken by anyone else.<br><br>Extremely intertaining mission. :D</p>

            <p>I started reading this mission at 12:30, and I just finished it at 5:30.  But it was worth it!  This is the best mission I&#39;ve read in a long while.  I love the way you made use of Kreacher, that you showed the surviving Dragons to be just as victimized by the bad writing as Cadmar and the canons, and that you put the agents in a nasty situation and made them deal with it.  The vacation section was awesome; I love it when agents get to experience the world a bit, even if the parts they explored this time weren&#39;t Potterverse-specific.<br><br>I have to admit, I got pretty mad at the Sunflower Official while he was chewing everyone out at the end.  I know he was justified in doing so, and he definitely made some good points about equipment upkeep and leaving Kreacher un-neuralyzed (not that that was intentional), but I still couldn&#39;t help but feel bad for Cadmar, especially knowing he&#39;s going to be missing a part of his identity for an unknown length of time.  I think Miah was right to call him out a bit at the end.<br><br>I&#39;m rambling...Anyway, I just wanted to say that this was a great, funny mission, and I&#39;m glad I read it, even if it swallowed up my whole afternoon!</p>

            <p>Wow, I am glad we were able to make it that good!<br><br>The whole Crash Dummy thing was an idea for the original draft of the mission, when it was solo. When Miah joined, it needed some tweaks so it would still make sense that they couldn&#39;t just fix everything with tech.  It was fun too!<br><br>I am really glad the vacation scene was a success, I always wanted t do a travel montage! The idea was suggested to me by DML, instead of using an RA for traveling. So, props to him, and he is right. Not using RAs CAN be fun for everyone.<br><br>It was originally going to have the agents travel from Grimmauld Place to Siberia, lugging a sedated Heather in a suit case or something, until they dropped her off. Then they would be back at HQ because that is how travel montages work. But, when Miah discovered a door, I though this was a LOT better. Writing the agents goofing off in fun.<br><br>Miah actually plotted a route out using GoogleMaps, and pointed out some neat thing we could have the agents visit, props to her for research!<br><br>And finally, the SO. Pretzel, who I am belatedly thanking for betaing (Sorry!) said his original punishment was too much, and a second person (My RL friend) agreed, so me and Miah added some to the end of it. Having Fem!Cadmar around for a few missions will be fun to play with.<br><br></p>

            <p>I loved the mission. Long, but totally worth reading. Your agents&#39; vacation had me laughing out loud. Warning to future readers: Swallow your Mountain Dew before you read. You&#39;ll thank me.<br><br>So I&#39;m thinking about another grammar issue, specifically Cadmar&#39;s gender-bending and how you switched pronouns for him/her afterward. I&#39;m not sure about the proper pronouns for situations like that. Do you go by physical gender, mental gender, or what? Do you just use those awkward third-gender pronouns? You can&#39;t use &quot;it&quot;; that just sounds like they&#39;re not a person anymore. Sure, gender-bending isn&#39;t real-life, but there have to be grammatical conventions for this somewhere.</p>

            <p>... in written fiction that involves magic or scifi genderbending instead of realistic-style transitioning or similar, using the mental-gender pronoun makes it kind of hard to keep track of when they&#39;re swapping back and forth. If it was me, I might use the physical-sex pronouns in quotation marks when the person is transformed into the opposite gender. (I don&#39;t do this for Laburnum and Hemlock, because when she&#39;s being him, she does think of herself as a he.)</p>

            <p>Alright, so there is this fic called <a href="http://www.kinsfire.net/viewstory.php?sid=3">Family Matters</a> . It. . .<br>Well, it may not be the worst fic evar, but it certainly makes me wish for bleeprin. It starts off sane and then only gets more and more ridiculous.<br><br>The Dursleys are horrible and abusive as they always are in bad fanfic, so Harry runs away to go live with the Grangers, who practice nudism and have no problem with Harry having sex with their teenage daughter under their own roof. Hermione&#39;s mom is constantly stated to look like she could be her daughter&#39;s older sister and we&#39;re told that the Granger&#39;s nudism is not about sex. . . and then Harry has sex with Mrs. Granger. But it&#39;s alright and Mr. Granger forgives him  because it too dark for Harry to see WHO HE WAS HAVING SEX WITH!!!<br><br>Sorry, descended into capslock of rage there for a minute. I&#39;m back now. To continue. . . <br><br>Then she gets pregnant, but Mr. Granger&#39;s okay with it — &quot;it was an honest mistake&quot;, and they&#39;ve always wanted another child. Oh, and it&#39;s twins. Hermione gets pregnant thanks to magical coma sex. Both female Grangers give birth on the same day and <b>oh god make it stop!</b><br><br>Deep breaths, deep breaths. . . <br><br>So in the end everyone who&#39;s good gets a happy ending with lots of orgies and babies and everyone who&#39;s bad gets what&#39;s coming to them. <br><br>Also Harry becomes Minister of Magic at 16.<br><br>Now I think I&#39;m going to go whimper in a corner for a bit.</p>

            <p>How can you tell if a fan fiction is bad? If there&#39;s an OC in it is that OC automaticaly a mary sue? And if its shipping two cannon characters that actually COULD be a couple (Terra/Aqua in Kingdom Hearts, Ivaniva/Talia from Babylon 5, stuff like that) even if they&#39;re not an official couple, is it a badfic?</p>

            <p>One good way to tell if the OC&#39;s a Mary Sue is to ask what would happen if you took her (or him) out of the story, and if there&#39;s a place for her (or him) in the world. Some OCs are like NPCs in a video game: they&#39;re the barrista at the coffee shop, and you could replace them with pretty much anyone without it making a difference. Others have to be who they are, but they still fit into the world-- like the murder victim&#39;s beloved sister who&#39;s secretly the culprit. Tony DiNozzo flirting with the barrista for half a scene doesn&#39;t make her a Sue; DiNozzo falling in love with the sister during the case, forgetting all about his other friends, and neglecting his job for her because they&#39;re Just That Perfect for each other probably does. (Actually, even that could make for good fic, if you made it about her psychological manipulation of him and made it clear that this was NOT a healthy relationship. But I digress.)<br><br>Personally, I think a lot of the fun of shipping canon characters is watching the author try to justify why these two, of all people, are together. Some use their interactions in canon to help that along, others don&#39;t.</p>

            <p>1) Extremely Out Of Character characters<br>-this adresses your &#39;non-canon couple&#39; question: if they can still act in character and get together, yeah.

A Mary Sue is a Mary Sue for several reasons.<br><br>#1: how other characters react to her.

If she outdoes everyone in their own areas of expertise, always get the right side in an argument, etc. that&#39;s a Mary Sue.<br><br>#3: Is she perfect in every way? Does she have no flaws? Is she Superman without Kryptonite? She&#39;s a Sue.<br><br>#4: Is her general story well-written? If an author has no plot and tends to ramble on about what color the trim of her clothes is, you guessed it- it&#39;s a Sue.<br><br></p>

            <p>Look for ways that a fic differs from canon. For instance, if a fic has Legolas as a weepy wimp who can barely raise a bow, let alone actually kill an orc with it, then that&#39;s a definite clue that it&#39;s a badfic.<br><br>If characters are being bashed or random canon events are taken out of context and used to justify the author&#39;s view of the character as evil/bad/a slut/etc., then that&#39;s another clue.<br><br>Shipping two characters who could be a couple doesn&#39;t make it a badfic, but there should be reasons for it. If an author has a couple who hate each other in canon and in the fic they&#39;re completely devoted to each other with no explanation as to how they resolved their differences, then it&#39;s probably a badfic.<br><br>The plot needs to make sense and it shouldn&#39;t be implausible at any stage. If a character is warped OOC so the plot can proceed, then yes, it&#39;s most probably a badfic. Another example is that there&#39;s a few fics in the Redwall fandom where a self-insert is dropped into Mossflower to help save Redwall from some imminent crisis, but given that Redwall is a sound, very strong building full of beasts who are trained, skilled warriors, there usually isn&#39;t a good reason as to why they&#39;d need an unskilled kid from another world.<br><br>Also, if skills are being pulled out of a hat so that the plot can proceed or the characters can be even more awesome, then it&#39;s most likely a badfic. Any mention of a character &#39;just knowing&#39; how to do something makes the fic implausible.<br><br>Hope that helps.</p>

            <p>One telltale symptom of a bad story in general is if it makes excuses for events happening rather than having events in logical order or displayed as following cause/effect.<br><br>Most badfic has a superficial goal, like shipping a pairing or showing a character is AWESOME. They&#39;ll make excuses to get to this goal, or ignore basic facts and logic to attain it...<br><br>Excuse: &quot;She murdered all of the people who DARED touch her man! It was OK and she didn&#39;t get arrested because those girls were evil.&quot;<br><br>Excuse: &quot;Aragorn only acts the way he does around her because she&#39;s SO PRETTY!&quot;<br><br>Excuse: &quot;She&#39;s faster than Sonic the Hedgehog because she&#39;s half hedgehog, half cheetah.&quot;<br><br>etc. All of these things are excuses that commonly happen in bad fanfic... <br><br>A shipping pairing COULD be bad, if it makes shallow excuses for why they&#39;re together,(&quot;Sora and Riku are a couple because eating a paoupu fruit makes you GAY! And because I say so!&quot;) but another story with the same couple can be plausible and well-done if the two characters have real reasons to be together (&quot;Sora and Riku have been through so much together, and after everything is over they discover their bond is deeper than they thought, etc.&quot;) that make sense and further them as characters.<br><br>Rather than excuses for mush, fluff, or fan-wank.</p>

            <p>For the record, just because the pairing isn&#39;t plausible doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bad. See crackfic. Part of the appeal there is that it&#39;s intentionally so insane you can&#39;t help but laugh.</p>

            <p>Well, first off, there are many definitions of &quot;bad&quot; fanfic. When choosing a fanfic to do a mission on, I ask myself some of the following questions: Is the plot believable? Do the characters act like they do in the source material? Are there any moments that make me go &quot;Wait, <i>what</i>?&quot;? These, among others, help me in determining whether or not it&#39;s mission-worthy.<br><br>As for an OC, no, just because there&#39;s an OC in the story does not make that character a Mary Sue. It&#39;s how the writer <i>handles</i> that character that defines whether or not it&#39;s a Sue/Stu. Again, some questions to ask: Does this character make sense within the universe of the story? If it&#39;s a setting where there are any kind of powers and/or abilities available, and that character has power/abilities, do those powers make sense for that character to have? Do they overshadow powers possessed by canon characters? Do they upstage canon characters constantly?<br><br>And pairings, well, I suppose that&#39;s a little more subjective. For example, if the canon source material plays with the fact that a certain pair could be romantically linked-- like say, Catherine and Warrick from CSI --then it&#39;s plausible that the pairing could take place. It doesn&#39;t make it a badfic.<br><br>So, I guess what I&#39;m saying here is this: if it&#39;s plausible within the realm and rules of the canon material&#39;s universe, and doesn&#39;t throw anyone out of character, then no, it isn&#39;t a badfic. If if <i>does</i>, however, then you&#39;ve got some problems. Does that help?</p>

            <p>Also, for missions you should look for the potential for making jokes. This is supposed to be fun.<br><br><br>Some examples of OCs and ships that I consider goodfic:<br><br>Personally, I tend to be pretty harsh toward OCs, but for a long time, the only things on my favorite&#39;s list on ffnet were a couple of stories that were told entirely from OCs&#39; POVs, so obviously, I don&#39;t think they are all Sues just because they exist. In those stories, the story was about the OCs, but it was about how contact with the canon characters affected the OCs&#39; lives. The canons were all behaving very much like they could be expected to behave in an episode. (Also, getting to see an in-character Rodney McKay interact with a self-centered, whiny teenage protagonist was priceless.)<br><br>Even pairings that aren&#39;t all that likely can be written well. Back when Season four, I think, was going for NCIS, I read a story that first convinced me that slash could a good thing (long before I found the PPC). It had Gibbs and DiNozzo paired together. The thing that made it goodfic was that it didn&#39;t try to convince me that one day the elevator jerked, they bumped into each other and that was enough catalyst for them to start making like bunnies(real plot, I read once, I swear). In the goodfic it took about fifty thousand words to get to the first kiss. It took that many to convince me that they could behave in-character and still be interested in each other.</p>

            <p>Usually, a really good way to find if a fic is bad is to check the SPaG, particularly in the summaries. If you have a misspelling in the title and a host of grammatical errors in the summaries, it&#39;s almost always a dead giveaway to a fic&#39;s quality. It&#39;s one of those things that lets sane people know that My Immortal is badfic: it&#39;s badly spelled and has a ton of grammar errors.<br><br>Note that it doesn&#39;t always apply: some people can have a decent writing style, but it&#39;s still badfic.<br><br>All of Pretzel&#39;s suggestions also apply.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s been a lot of conversation floating around on, and about, the Wiki lately. I&#39;d like to take the opportunity to clear up a few points. Obviously, we can&#39;t fault newcomers for not understanding everything about editing the Wiki before they talk to us, but it would be nice if everyone who was editing could agree to some basic rules of consideration. If you&#39;ve a comment, or something to add, or something to argue, please discuss. I&#39;d like to have an open-ended talk about this; we&#39;re an informal community without a lot of Serious Rules, we should at least have discussions when we need to.<br><br>Firstly: Please, <i>please</i> don&#39;t edit someone else&#39;s specific page without their consent. For example, editing the page on Makes-Things to fix a minor spelling or grammar error is fine-- Makes-Things is, more or less, a character available to all the PPC. Editing the page on Agent Laburnum, or the page on Agent Dann, on the other hand, is most definitely not okay; those characters are owned by their respective authors, and no edits should be done to the main body of the text, even link-making or grammar-fixing, without their consent.<br><br>Secondly: Redlinking. Don&#39;t do it. If you notice that Lord of the Rings doesn&#39;t link to The Silmarillion, by all means link it. If you decide that there should be a link on the Fellowship article to the Anduin... first check that there is, in fact, a non-stub article for the Anduin. If there is no article for the Anduin, <i>please</i> don&#39;t try to link to it.<br><br>Thirdly: Everything does not have to be linked to everything. We are not TV Tropes, and we are not <a href="http://xkcd.com/478/">existentialists with staple guns</a>. People are perfectly capable of typing &quot;Sunflower Official&quot; into the search bar; they do not need every single instance of his name to be blue and underlined.<br><br>I&#39;m sure these aren&#39;t the only issues that have come up, so please, discuss away! I&#39;d like to get as many opinions going here as we can.</p>

            <p>The way I see it, the Wiki we have is not so much a encyclopedic wiki as our hub and record for what&#39;s been in PPC canon, and what has not... and most of the various canons the PPC has been to, and the various fanfic trends that have been noticed in each. It&#39;s supposed to be a resource and a collection of all things PPC.<br><br>And following the PPC spirit, if something isn&#39;t FUNNY or USEFUL/MEANINGFUL/PRACTICAL (Caps lock for emphasis, not shouting), it probably shouldn&#39;t appear in too high a dose there. <br><br>When I link things on a page, I link things that I think are meaningful to that page, or things that may have a second meaning that DOES have a page on the wiki. Some of these links might be for fun, but they all are links that a person can use to find out more information about a PPC concept... or can follow to see the punchline of a PPC-spirited joke.<br><br>As for editing specific agent pages, the last time I did that, Nesh and I were on an official Wiki-cleanup and archival run, one to put all PPC characters in an index and link their appearances for easy access to more minor characters... or to find out which characters had been made preemptively and never got appearances at all. And even then, the content of the pages was not heavily edited. The way I see it, fixing an obvious spelling error (no ypurs on our wiki, for example) is fine, but linking all of these things the writers of the article didn&#39;t intend... what purpose does it serve? Is it funny or useful? As in, substantially more useful Not... really.<br><br>Our wiki is not wikipedia or TvTropes. It is an archive of the PPC, and like all PPC materials should follow the spirit of the PPC: one of practicality and light-heartedness. Edits that don&#39;t really serve either purpose may just be excessive.<br><br>The best solution to an error on an agent page, I think, is to alert the writer of it and chat about it... but that&#39;s not really going to work very well because less people add and work on the wiki than have pages there. Too bad. I kind of secretly wish more people would write for the wiki and make cool articles that would add to the good thoughts there.</p>

            <p>I think that is a pretty good explanation of the way our wiki works. It is more of a collection of everything PPC than a collection of everything in general.<br><br>Personally, I&#39;ve always been fine with someone fixing format problem with a infobox, or a typo, comma, or some other small mistake on one of my pages. I&#39;m not perfect, and I&#39;m not always around to chat with about it. (Okay, so I am <i>almost</i> always on the chat for a few hours per day...) There have been several times when I&#39;ve made a major edit that someone else has come through and picked up a couple of small errors like this. The point is that I quite welcome content nuetral edits.<br><br>On the other hand, if someone was suddenly mucking about with the actual content of my agent pages, I&#39;d be annoyed. (You know, things like why does she have those missions numbered that way? Three and five are missing! I should fix that for her! or something that happened to Guvnor back in May where someone decided that the mini-Unas O&#39;Neil hated his agent Thomas Greenwall, and changed his agent profile to reflect that.)</p>

            <p>1/ What about users who don&#39;t edit the Wiki, or aren&#39;t even with the PPC any more? How are people to know that they&#39;re allowed to edit the page for, say, Ella Darcy, but not for Laburnum? I don&#39;t update any of my agents any more (because I&#39;m lazy), so why shouldn&#39;t someone else do it if they want to? Not to mention the fear that&#39;s creeping into people over this sort of rule - I had someone say that I needed to link Lofty Skies from the Wiki. Really? <i>Why</i> do I need to? It&#39;s a wiki - the whole point is that anyone can edit it.<br><br>2/ &#39;check that there is, in fact, a non-stub article for the Anduin&#39;. Stubs won&#39;t get expanded if no-one links to them. And sometimes a redlink is important - it says &#39;I know this needs a page, but I don&#39;t know enough to do it myself. Someone please fill in the gap!&#39;. Again, it&#39;s a <i>wiki</i> - it&#39;s about everyone editing and expanding it.<br><br>3/ Did I see someone below claiming that a user was blocked from editing for this? Because that&#39;s ridiculous. No, every instance of Sunflower Official doesn&#39;t need to be linked - but it doesn&#39;t actually do any harm. We don&#39;t have a budget for blue links (do we?).<br><br>In conclusion, I think this is one heck of an overreaction, and I have no idea why people think it&#39;s necessary.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I agree. The whole point of the wiki is that <i>anyone</i> can edit and expand it. Now, adding random stuff to agent pages that was never mentioned anywhere else is a Bad Thing. However, everyone should fix SPaG issues, no matter who &quot;owns&quot; the page content, since we (the PPC) are here to mock bad writing, and if our wiki is filled with wild ypurs and missing commas, then we&#39;re leaving ourselves open for the hypocrite card.<br></p>

            <p>1) You&#39;re right, but I think the solution is to have a more clear set of... something, on the Wiki, not to have anything at all. The issue is with people who aren&#39;t with the PPC at all, haven&#39;t introduced themselves, or have been around for two or three days going on edit-binges, including editing pages for other people&#39;s characters.<br><br>(No, you don&#39;t <i>need</i> to link anything from the Wiki. That&#39;s kind of ridiculous. I don&#39;t edit the thing either, I was just responding to various concerns.)<br><br>2) You&#39;re right. I very nearly said &#39;if the article is a stub, help expand it,&#39; but maybe I just don&#39;t know how Wikis work. I do know that we had a massive Blow-Up Thingie about redlinking a while back, and Neshomeh and Aster made a whole bunch of excellent points about the thing, which I don&#39;t remember at all, because I actually don&#39;t pay all that much attention to the Wiki.<br><br>3) Someone was given a temporary block (one day, IIRC), because for a few days running now, he has been going on hour-long editing binges, the first of which occurred before he actually introduced himself on the Board-- several people were getting upset at seeing their pages edited without consent, and though most of the edits were links, some edited content. Also, it seemed to be the only way to get through to him, since repeated requests to his talk page are ignored, and reverting his edits with a summary to the point of &quot;Can we talk about this?&quot; either get misunderstood or ignored.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t do harm to link to the Sunflower Official, but it&#39;s annoying as a very annoying thing to be going through a page and half the text is in blue. It was pointed out on the chat that the assumption is that people using the wiki have at least a passing familiarity with the PPC, and don&#39;t need every step of the way mapped out in blue.<br><br>You&#39;re right. It probably is an overreaction. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s over by much, we probably needed to talk about the Wiki anyway, and quite frankly, I think it&#39;s important that we discuss stuff like this before it turns into a cold war of edits and reverts. With things going on as they were, I just had the feeling we were going in that direction. Like I said, I&#39;m not trying to be rule-happy. The whole point is that we don&#39;t have a lot of hard-and-fast rules, as a community, so when things do go wrong, it&#39;s important to be able to talk about them.<br><br><sub>...I swear, that post wasn&#39;t meant to sound like it was coming from atop a soapbox.

            <p>(You don&#39;t sound like you&#39;re on a soapboax. At least, not to me.)<br><br>I&#39;m joining the bandwagon in that I absolutely <i>do not</i> want anyone editing my or my agents&#39; pages - I routinely look at the the history log just to check that - but hS has a fair point about newbies not knowing what pages are unofficially &#39;off limits&#39;. Perhaps we could make a (short) page somwhere that can act as a notification of sorts, or maybe a see-only-when-trying-to-edit notice saying &quot;the content of this page is not to be edited except by [insert name here]&quot; - or something like that. My suggestion&#39;s also a bit heavy-handed, but there must be a way to post a list in an easy-to-find place that will tell people what should be left alone. <br><br>I also think that it&#39;s quite fair to block a user from editing for a short time if they&#39;re not paying attention to (or, in fairness, just haven&#39;t noticed) messages from others asking them to stop, particularly if said person is very new to the community and <i>especially</i> if said person hasn&#39;t even introduced themselves yet. This is a community and communication is essential. That said, it seems to have been an innocent misunderstanding, and in the end, no harm done. </p>

            <p>Well, perhaps we could put something on the Wiki&#39;s main page that says, &#39;Before editing a page, please read this guideline to page editing&#39;, and the guideline can explain that some users don&#39;t want others editing their pages, with a conveniently placed list of people who will let others edit their pages and a list of people who don&#39;t want others editing their pages, and the links to the pages too.</p>

            <p>Well, the story bug has bitten me again, threatening to slow down my other fanfic projects (and my mission) even further.  It will probably need a Beta-reader, a first for me, as will my mission when it gets off the ground.<br><br>This one comes from a couple of character ideas I had when I was going to put a Star Destroyer into drydock and flood HQ with crewers.  It&#39;s basically a Cthulhu Mythos story, centering around the East Asian people known as the &quot;Tcho-Tcho&quot;.<br><br>However, I&#39;m giving it a sort of new spin.  Mostly because traditional horror creeps me the smeg out... I&#39;m better with suspense ending with a very plain &quot;oh crap&quot; moment.  I may also one day run an RPG with this scenario.<br><br>First, the &quot;Tcho-Tcho&quot; themselves (in my version) are an amalgam of groups across Southeast Asia with a few similarities having to do with cannibalism, human sacrifice and the adoption of Dreamland sorcery.  However, they are rather different<br><br>The first group encountered inhabit the Annamite mountain range, being either the descendants of Lac Viet agriculturalists driven west and south by Chinese expansion in the second and third centuries BCE.  Animist and largely Bronze-age, these &quot;Leng Viet&quot; worship manifestations of the power of the Outer Gods in the forms of animals alongside the more traditional ancestor cults.  Human sacrifice provides protection for their villages and rice from narrow hill terraces.. but alot of the sacrifices now are the very old and ill volunteering themselves or a meaningful death or of game and livestock, with unlucky travellers, soldiers and arrogant missionaries coming fewer and farther apart these days.  They are the group that the protagonist first meets and, despite their early abuse of the sorceries taught them, they are possibly the least evil of the three subgroups (in the biased view of said protagonist).<br><br>The second group are the traditonal Great-Old-One worshiping Neolithic pygmies, surviving in the lowland jungles of Cambodia and Eastern Thailand despite the governments leasing out massive resource concessions to foreign companies.  Whereas one group of the Goat-legged Men of Leng (long story) had come to the Viet refugee groups led by a spectral Black Buffalo Cow, a second group of fleeing Leng-ese (or &quot;Shugoran&quot;, in my mutation) had come to these people at the same time, living out their lives as Sorcerer-Kings and worshiped as Gods (similar to Yag-Kosha in Hoard&#39;s Tower of the Elephant).  Eventually the people came to worship Lloigor and Zhar, two interconnected masses of tentacled insanity from the star Arcturus that seem more intent on trying to destroy each other in their subterranean caves than actually help their cultists.  I have these guys pegged as &quot;Chaotic Neutral bordering on evil&quot;.<br><br>The third group is in Burma, being your classical evil and cruel cult that secretly kidnaps innocents to sacrifice to the Outer Demon Chaugner Faughn, the &quot;Yara&quot; of this story. His original servants were the Miri Nigri, frog men created in the young days of the world, who helped him entrap and enslave a great portion of the original Shugoran refugees from Tibet.  This group is reviled by the other two, mostly for enslaving their spiritual teachers instead of worshiping or sheltering them.  The Leng Viet in particular would like nothign better than to slay Chaugner Faughn and retrieve the Shugoran holy index, the &quot;Book of Cracked Jade&quot;.<br><br>However, all groups have been put under one label, the &quot;Tcho-Tcho&quot;, derived from the Hmong &quot;Tchaw-Tchaw&quot;, or Eaters.  There&#39;s a history there, what with the Communists using the Vietic and Tai-speaking Leng-ists as territorial choke-points during the war with western backed groups (including the Hmong).  However, the popular legend has combined the ferocity of the Leng Viet warriors and hunters (who seem to be regressing to barbarianism versus their people&#39;s attachment to settled agriculture), the primitive life of the Jungle pygmies and the cruelty and power-lust of the Burmese cults into one image.<br><br>Next time... What I&#39;m doing with Delta Green and the other conspiracies.  But first, please feel free to criticize, poke holes, tell me how mixing Howard, Lovecraft and Derleth is a crime against Canon (and I agree, which is why this is very specifically non-canon) or just discuss.<br><br>Beige-not sure how long it&#39;s been since I posted somethign this long.<br><br></p>

            <p>This hasn&#39;t gotten any feedback, so I&#39;ll repeat my request for a mission Beta (in advance) and just fill out the rest of my story idea, specifically the investigators.<br><br>The Investigators in this story take... three forms, roughly.  The first are the old, 1920-1960 breed that went in, shot cultists, took names and stopped the destruction of the world.  <br><br>The second are the modern breed with Federal connections.  With Delta Green itself (in my iteration, fic and possible RPG-wise), there are the official &quot;Vowel Cells&quot;, who have plenty of backup to deal with Mythos activity.  A and E cells are for kill-ops, where quick, decisive use of assets is important to safeguard humanity. I and O cells are for more delicate ops where the entities and cults are relatively benign or low powered, and the aim is to contain Mythos activity to a controllable area while leaving most of the human initiares alive and free to worship benignly. U and Y cells are the most delicate, where the aim is to actively seek Mythos assistance against much worse abominations (This group has a turnover rate typical of dealing with beings that create a psionic undercurrent as a matter of course).  And then there&#39;s Majestic-12, which is pretty much like the Men in Black... only creepier, with a Brain-in-a-jar ambassadorial program, Shoggoth defense systems and Yithian outreach and library system.<br><br>And then there are the more typical cells in Delta Green, including civilian friendlies.  Ten are connected to the Vowels, who use them as assets with plausible deniability.  The others, however, do not follow official procedure or have sanction.  These are the Lost 10; Some of them are merely considered fools and cowboys, who use just a little too much gunplay and assassination of witnesses in their mission to protect but are otherwise effective.  Others, though... the Vowels think that some of these cells are one psychotic break from declaring Exterminatus on the entire planet, killing us all so the mythos doesn&#39;t get us first.  Mostly the result of Battle fatigue and excessive SAN loss, there have been battles against some of these cells and the feds... sometimes with high body-counts.  Executive opinion is that they are bordering on cultdom themselves and are extremely dangerous.  One of these cells will be the antagonists in the first part of the story.<br><br>Basically, the mythos is inscrutable in it&#39;s motives... but sometimes, inscrutable can just as easily mean &quot;Why is it helping us?&quot; as &quot;Why is it hurting us?&quot;.<br><br>Well, I&#39;ve rambled again, and I seem to be the king of the empty thread.  So here it ends with another quest for feedback and critcism on this little chunk of Mythos fanfic. What does everybody think   <br></p>

            <p>Full disclosure: I don&#39;t know the Mythos, Delta Green, etc. etc. beyond the usual Hello Cthulhu and Ry&#39;leh fhtaghn cheezburger jokes that you find on the internet.<br><br>I honestly don&#39;t get where you&#39;re going with this.

            <p>The two primary characters are ones that I introduced during my first permission request.  The first, one Joesph Clayton, is the son of insurance brokers in the northern Massechusetts town of Glaston, in the hills east of historic Dunwich.  The second is one Marie Trinh, daughter of the proprietors of a pseudo-Vietnamese restaurant in the town and, until some months before the story begins, the only East or Southeast Asian family in town.  <br><br>As the story begins, Joeseph and Marie, both high school sophomores, have been in a relationship for about six months but friends since childhood.  Just as her parents restaurant is beginning to suffer vandalism from an unknown person or persons, Joseph informs her that 1) there is a &quot;Heritage Day&quot; variety show coming up soon and 2) there are people in this town that realize that the Trinhs are not mainstream Vietnamese, though only Joseph comprehends that the usual explanation of being Hmong or some other known minority.  For the event, despite the worries of her parents, Marie performs the &quot;stork dance&quot;, a traditional ritual of marking departure on and return from long journeys, in an archaic Four-paneled dress, white cloak and mask resembling the head of a black spoonbill.  It is after this that Joseph, having performed something from Normandy, overhears that the vandal has been arrested, being the teenage son of another Vietnamese family that has set up a jewellry shop.<br><br>Years later, Joseph is in Miskatonic U as an Anthropology freshman while Marie, after high school, had disappeared back to Vietnam for a year.  During an ethnographical trip to the highlands south of the city of Vinh in the selfsame nation (which turns out to be a government exclusion zone), Joseph, his elderly professor and several of his classmates are captured by fearsome tattooed warriors with shaved heads and sharpened teeth, wearing white kilts and wielding bronze weapons.  Brought back to a valley village full of people, wearing kilts, short-sleeved jackets and Yem undergarments for the women, all sporting tattoos similar to Marie&#39;s parents, the party is intended to be tomorrow mornings sacrifice and tomorrow evenings barbecue.<br><br>However, a frantic (and now similarly tattooed) Marie manages to spare Joseph  on account of his parents service to her parents (insurance brokers) while the divinations of the villages chief sorcerer-priest (and the fickle designs of Nyarlathotep) spares the others.  Eventually allowed to participate in anthropological fieldwork among the villagers, Joseph discovers the full history of his girlfriends people, finds out about Delta Green cells both sanctioned and rogue from his professor (who pioneered negotiating with the more relatable cults and abominations) and also participates in a battle to protect the village from one of these rogue cells and their local military assets since one of his party turns out to be a traitor.<br><br>  Aided by the darker sorceries of the warriors, men with bows and bronze swords and tattoos glowing with eldritch fire are able to deflect bullets and blades while Joseph helps the levied farmers, armed with old french rifles and a Hotchkiss machine gun from an earlier battle, fight off a flanking attack on the village.  Eventually aided by a stampede of spectral Guar bulls and tigers, Joseph fights for a short while in the melee with his steel machete, the eldritch fire lending him some protection as it dances across his skin and leaves scars similar to the warriors tattoos.  Upon returning to the village temple, the young man&#39;s jubilation fades as he finds that, after sacrificing the traitor, his professor sacrificed himself to finish the battle<br><br>Both Marie and Joseph develop a bit of a &quot;laugh to keep from screaming&quot; thing after dealing with battles and the occasional non-voluntary sacrifice of a gangster.<br><br>The future arc involves Joseph working with both the sanctioned DG cells and the Leng Viet to venture across southeast Asia, from northern Laos to Cambodia to the Burmese uplands and Rangoons underbelly in order to destroy Chaughner Faughn and his cult and recover the Book of Cracked Jade.  Characters accompanying the primary character will include a Leng Viet archer who Joseph terms &quot;spider eye&quot; (need to think up proper names), a swordsman, a junior sorcerer from the village and a Delta green minder.<br><br>I hope that doesn&#39;t get too much more confusing.</p>

            <p>Well, I think for something like that, it could really be quite subjective and differ from fic to fic. If the goodfic doesn&#39;t differ too far from original canon, then you could easily use the real book as the official canon. If the goodfic is sufficiently different from the original (such as having OCs, following the life of a minor character, or being AU itself), then it might be better to use a combination of the goodfic and the original work as canon. It seems like it would be up to the person sporking the fic. I know that some people would say to only use the original work as canon, but I think if a story has earned the title of &quot;goodfic,&quot; then the work that was put into it deserves to be protected, especially if another fan decides to muck about with it and completely destroy it. Again, though, it should really be up to the person&#39;s discretion.<br><br>Has anyone ever sporked a fic like that anyway?</p>

            <p>The PPC seems to define a canon as an original published work. I think that a badfic of a goodfic would still be tied to the original canon, although I suppose it would be an alternate version of that canon, like a bookverse versus a movieverse. </p>

            <p>I just read the sporking of &quot;<a href="http://chelonianmobile.livejournal.com/40384.html">Among the Roses</a>&quot;, and I&#39;m kind of intrigued by the manner in which the Sue got dispatched.  Namely...<br><br>&quot;Foxglove shoved the Sue out into the clearing.

They drooled or leered or licked their lips, and brandished weapons or ugly rat-head-shaped lanterns.<br><br>One or two started up a low, sinister chant.

They knew every route through these woods, they knew their prey couldn’t escape, and they weren’t going to tire themselves out too much to enjoy the fun at the end. Meanwhile, the agents portalled out.&quot;<br><br>Who the heck is Hobb?!?  And where can I find out more about this guy?</p>

            <p>Hobb is from a series of books called The Deptford Mice; it&#39;s about anthropomorphic rodents, sort of like a very dark Redwall. Hobbers are a group of creatures that worship three evil rat gods, the Raith Sidhe, and Hobb is the worst one. I&#39;ve never actually read the series myself, so I&#39;m not sure if they show up in The Deptford Mice or the prequel series, the Deptford Histories, or both, but there you are. So, Burnsey and Fox gave the Sue to a bloodthirsty and fuzzy cult.</p>

            <p>The song is from &quot;The Oaken Throne&quot;, in the second book of the Deptford Histories, in which Hobb actually makes a personal appearance. Hobb, according to the book, is an enormous red-furred rat with goat&#39;s horns and hooves, the size of a large tree. Freaky bugger. The other two members of the Raith Sidhe (pronounced &quot;rayth shee&quot;) are Mabb and Bauchan. Mabb is a rat goddess with a third eye on her forehead who visits her followers in dreams, and Bauchan is the trickster god who can shapeshift into whatever he wants but is generally portrayed in the rats&#39; icons as a headless rat (because he can wear whatever head he likes). Their sacrificial victims are skinned alive and eaten.<br><br>I&#39;m quite keen to sacrifice another Sue to Suruth Scarophion at some point. Scarophion is a snake god, capable of destroying the whole world if he ever gets free from the imprisonment the heroes&#39; ancestors put him in, and his followers kill their victims with a particularly horrible poison which slowly melts them into puddles of black goo.<br><br>Yes, these books are supposed to be for kids.</p>

            <p>For one thing, its title is the incredibly imaginative <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943226/1/If_Seto_Kaiba_Had_A_Sister">&quot;If Seto Kaiba Had A Sister&quot;</a>. Okay, so what? Every other story in the YGO fandom&#39;s a &#39;Sue. What makes this one so special? Well, for another thing, it&#39;s thirty-six chapters and incomplete. And I think this speaks for itself:<br><br>-------------<br><br>HEYYYYY :D I am SOOOO EXCITED! Finally uploading my first story :D :D :D I&#39;ve been working on this story for months, and I have HEAPS more chapters to upload :D :D :D Now, I&#39;m not going to be mean and say... &quot;if i don&#39;t get any reviews I&#39;m not uploading anymoreeee&quot; BUT I will say, &quot;the more reviews I get the faster I&#39;ll upload&quot; At a max, it&#39;ll take a week...Hopefully... Anyway... I hope you enjoy this A LOT! I know one of my besties and I do :D Just as a little pre-warning, quite a few scenes here have been copied from the English Dubbed Yugioh series, and If this annoyes you, GET OVER IT! The whole point of this story, is to explain what would have happened if Seto Kaiba had a sister, NOT TO CHANGE THE WHOLE PLOT! Now I&#39;ll bet ya anything your sick and tired of me prattling on, so lets just finish with, I DO NOT OWN YUGIOH!<br><br>INTRODUCTION-CHAPTER 1<br><br>I looked around at the deserted streets, the flickering street lamps and eerie atmosphere not frightening me even a little. Although I wasn&#39;t scared, doubt weighed me down, and for the thousandth time this evening, I hoped that this decision would bring me a better life.<br><br>When I was just 6 years old, my parents died. I was so traumatised by this, without even thinking, I left my older and younger brother and ran away. This was where my life turned into a horror movie. I don&#39;t remember much about my child hood, I remembered my brother&#39;s names, but not my last name (well, I found out a few hours ago). Back then, I just went by Amy. Anyway, a couple of days after I ran away, I came to my senses and tried to find my brothers, but I had no idea where to start looking. So basically, I stole the bare necessities from shops and homes, feeling guilty every time, and more so when I took more than I needed in order to survive. Every afternoon, I went into the shopping mall, and hid in the darkest corner I could find, and when it came time to close, I stayed for I needed shelter. I was never found. From a young age, I needed to be strong, brave, and independent.<br><i>(Snip wherein the tae kwon do place&#39;s owner offers to teach her for free. BECAUSE OF COURSE, THAT&#39;S WHY.)</i><br><br>A few lessons in, Mr Nakamura asked if he could come home to meet my parents, however, I refused, but after some encouragement, I told him my life story. By the end, the sorrow in his eyes was evident, and he asked if I wanted to live with him until I discovered the identity of my siblings. I agreed instantly; anything to escape my current situation. Not only did he give me a home, but he was also able to pay for gymnastics lessons, as he said it would help greatly with tae kwon do if I was going to be serious about it; which I was. He also paid for me to go to school. I learned a lot there, and became the top student of every class! However, I was never truly happy with Mr Nakamura. It never felt right, and he wasn&#39;t able to give me anything other than food, clothes, and somewhere to stay, for his income wasn&#39;t very high. Although we became quite good friends, I was just a burden for him, and the constant guilt was slowly eating away at me over the years I stayed with him.<br><br>Now I am 12 years old, and a few hours ago, an advertisement came on TV announcing the new president of KaibaCorp, and their change into the gaming business. As the new president&#39;s picture flashed up on screen, I recognised the face immediately, and the name fitted. It was my brother; Seto Kaiba. I instantly told Mr Nakamura, and after some good-bye&#39;s and thank-you&#39;s I left. KaibaCorp was only a 1 kilometre walk away, but if I walked fast, it might feel shorter.<br><br>I missed my brothers terribly, even though I couldn&#39;t remember them much, but I could remember that although I loved Mokuba dearly, I found him annoying at a young age. Hopefully he isn&#39;t that annoying now. As for Seto, I was always close to him. We were best friends, and did so many things together. I hope he hasn&#39;t changed too much. I wonder if they would remember me; little Amy Kaiba.<br><br>I broke out of my memories, and saw that I was directly in front of KaibaCorp, the tall building looming over me. I took a deep breath, and located what would be the main office (Seto&#39;s office) to the side of the building. I stepped to the side and into the shadows, as well as moving right under the window, which was about 10-20 storeys up, I couldn&#39;t really tell.<br><br>That night, a young, skinny girl scaled the KaibaCorp building, grabbing everything her hands could find to support her. The figure was dressed in denim shorts, a slightly torn and frayed red singlet, and old, white sneakers, her long, straight brown hair flowing down her back, with her fringe pretty much exactly like her older brothers. This girl was me.<br><br>Scaling the western wall of KaibaCorp was more difficult than I had ever imagined, however, years of tae kwon do and gymnastics proved to be useful. In just a few minutes, I was looking through the open window, and saw my brother, working at a desk with his back to me. I quietly crept up onto the window sill, and - using my extremely strong legs – made a flying leap over my brother&#39;s head and the desk, twisted in the air, and landed in a crouch head down in the facing my brother.<br><br>&quot;What are you doing here little girl, this is a company, not a child care centre. Now I suggest you get out before I call security,&quot; my brother said standing up and moving in front of his desk. I smiled to myself, other than getting a little deeper, his voice sounded so similar to how I remembered it to be. &quot;You mean you don&#39;t recognise me? Isn&#39;t the resemblance clear enough?&quot; I replied, with my head still looking down. Surely he would be able to tell it was me, I mean, our faces were the same general shape, and our hair was the same colour and shape. Well, mine was longer but yeah. Then, in a lightning quick action, I jumped up, and ran over to Seto, embracing him in a tight hug. I felt his body stiffen, and knew this couldn&#39;t be good. I felt his arm move between his and my body and push at me with more force than I would ever thought possible. I literally flew backwards, landing on the floor with a thud. Tears unwillingly came to my eyes. They weren&#39;t tears of physical pain, but emotional pain of rejection. Seto obviously didn&#39;t want me around, well, either that or he hadn&#39;t recognised me yet. I looked up with tear streaked eyes and said, &quot;Seto! How could you do this to your own sister!&quot; I saw his emotion change to one of suspicion. &quot;Amy?&quot; I nodded, and Seto believed me. I could tell that he did since he instantly came up and hugged me close. I was admittedly surprised, since even when we were younger, Seto never was a huggy person. I guess it was the years of separation that bought this hug on, and would probably be the only one for a long time. I&#39;m going to enjoy this while it lasts.<br><br>Heyyy :D So how&#39;d yall like that? You liked it... you KNOW u liked it :D :D Well... I guess it is sorta boring, being a LONG intro and all, but what can I say, a bit of explanations had to be done... and a few more next chapter... but after that it gets interesting :D<br><br>---------<br>Thirty. Six. Chapters. And. Still. Incomplete. Anyone with Permission wanna spork it or kill her?</p>

            <p>So this is a bit of a new idea, coming somewhat out of The Survey and somewhat out of My Own Deranged Mind. Let&#39;s see how it goes.<br><br>Here at the PPC we&#39;re very big on writing. We write missions, we rant about the bad writing in badfics, we even play games like Fill The Plothole, which consist of, yep, writing. But at no point do we all sit down and try to improve our writing together.<br><br>So. The objective of the Monthly PPC Writing Challenge is to write a short story to a set theme, and then give useful, constructive criticism to other participants. The Rules:<br><br>-You do <b>not</b> have to have Permission to take part.<br>-However, nothing written for the Challenge is considered part of the PPC Canon unless you <b>do</b> have Permission, and explicitly claim it as canon.<br>-Because of this, entries do not have to be consistent with PPC Canon or with each other.<br>-All responses should be kept to this thread.<br>-No flaming!<br>-The objective is to write a good story, and receive feedback from the rest of the community. If you want to rewrite based on that feedback, go ahead, but it&#39;s not required.<br>-Equally, if you write a story, try to give feedback to at least one other player.<br>-Stick to the theme, and keep it pretty short.<br>-You can use a beta, but it&#39;s not required.<br><br>I think that&#39;s the main points. So, the Challenge for August is:<br><br><i>It is a thousand years in the future. The PPC is unrecognisable to those who knew it in its early days, spread across worlds and universes - but it still retains some memory of its origins. Write one of the legends held among the PPC&#39;s descendants of the earliest years of the PPC - the days up until 2011.</i> (Inspired by <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/MythTitle.htm">this</a>)<br><br>Remember - consistency with the inspiration, each other, or the actual history of the PPC is not a requirement.<br><br>Also, for this month only: if you have any suggestions for future Challenges, please give them to me. If I have to think them up every month, this won&#39;t be a very long ongoing thing.<br><br>Oh, and most importantly - have fun!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;You&#39;re joking.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, I&#39;m not. I don&#39;t joke, Tarin, you know that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, yeah, but-- Really, Mer?&quot; Tarin looked skeptically at her friend, who sighed, and then motioned at the stasis chambers before him. <br><br>&quot;Okay, so, in 2012, everyone was going nutso about the supposed apocalypse, right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Right.&quot; Tarin remembered that from her history lessons, and had always thought that was stupid. Besides, everyone knew the apocalypse was going to happen in the year 5000. Duh.<br><br>&quot;So, a couple agents volunteered to go into stasis in case anything actually happened and they had to rebuild society. Among them was my umpteen-times great grandma. Dad used to take me down here and tell me the story about how she volunteered, and how her partner raised her son after that,&quot; Mer said, relishing his captive audience. <br><br>&quot;So why didn&#39;t they unfreeze her after the apocalypse didn&#39;t happen?&quot; Tarin asked, frowning a bit.<br><br>&quot;Because the tech was so experimental, all they could do was keep an eye on the agents&#39; vitals and hope for the best,&quot; Mer replied, shrugging. &quot;That&#39;s why it&#39;s a part of Medical now.&quot;<br><br>Tarin regarded the young woman in the chamber before her with an appraising eye. She didn&#39;t look over twenty-five, and was dressed in all brown. &quot;So,&quot; she asked, &quot;what was her name?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mal. Her name was Mal.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Cool. Hey, do you think she can hear us?&quot; Tarin tapped on the glass door, jumping back when a holographic overlay popped up under her fingers.<br><br><i>Mitochondrial genetic access key accepted. Now opening stasis chamber seven,</i> droned a robotic voice. Tarin and Mer exchanged panicked looks and then turned back to the stasis chamber, where the glass door was sliding open. A flash of bright light and a high pitched whine signaled the deactivation of the stasis field, and the chamber&#39;s occupant stumbled out, her first breath turning into a sudden cough as she breathed for the first time in a thousand years.<br><br>Mer caught Mal as she stumbled over herself, and then gently lowered her to the floor so she could catch her breath. Mal looked up at Mer and Tarin with a bleary-eyed gaze, and then spoke, her voice shaky.<br><br>&quot;D-did it work?&quot; she stuttered, raising one shaky hand to her head. &quot;Is ev-everyone okay?&quot;<br><br>Tarin and Mer looked at one another. They were <i>so</i> going to get in trouble for this.</p>

            <p>The piece is very well put together. At first, I didn&#39;t buy Agents Mal (knowing what I do about her character) as the sort of individual who would give up her family so easily. But then I figured that, in a way, she may have seen this as being a mother figure to the entire PPC in a way. Her protective nature would have been ideal in rebuilding society.<br><br>There are two things about this story that keep sticking in my craw. First off: why would the PPC be concerned about 2012? I could see a few of the crazier agents getting all worked up about an old prophecy, but the entire organization? Not sure I buy that.<br><br>Secondly, they couldn&#39;t unfreeze Mal because the tech was too experimental? I definitely don&#39;t buy that. The PPC theoretically has access to every piece of technology from every work of fiction ever created. Something as basic as cryogenics should not make DoSAT throw up their hands and say &#39;Let the future sort it out!&#39; The scenario would make more sense with a less technologically-developed group. I could see this scenario working with Star Trek or Fallout or even an original story. Not so much with the PPC.<br><br>Wow, I kinda went off on a tear there. Anyway, good technical piece, but I really couldn&#39;t accept some of the basic concepts you were laying down.</p>

            <p>Newly-made Agent Rachel Baryn was overjoyed as she made her way down the corridors of PPC HQ to the Portal Room, where she would be teleported to her new partner. &quot;Ooh, this is so *exciting*!&quot; she squealed. &quot;I&#39;m an *Agent* now and I&#39;m going to fight *badfic* and everything&#39;s going to be so *fun*...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Newbies,&quot; an older man said in disgust as he emerged from his RC.<br><br>Rachel was filled with righteous indignation as she drew herself up to her full height. &quot;Everyone has to start somewhere! Besides, who are you to condemn me for enthusiasm?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Someone who&#39;s seen everything, kid,&quot; the older Agent said, his voice sounding very tired. &quot;Once you&#39;ve sporked your first badfic and nearly got killed, all that enthusiasm will be gone.&quot;<br><br>Rachel folded her arms, mentally writing him off as a disillusioned pessimist. &quot;This *will* be fun. Besides, the PPC&#39;s safe as houses now.&quot;<br><br>The older Agent laughed sardonically. &quot;Safe? Are you joking?&quot;<br><br>Rachel was confused. &quot;But it is! With everything Makes-Things has built, there&#39;s no danger at all!&quot;<br><br>The older Agent shook his head. &quot;That&#39;s what they want you to think. Newbies like you get the worst of it- half the newbies get killed or maimed in their first mission. They walk in, fresh out of Basic Training and full of enthusiasm, and then they do everything by the handbook and get killed because it doesn&#39;t tell them to duck. Kid, if you want to survive in this place, wise up. You need to keep calm, make sure you know what&#39;s happening and always, always know where the Sue is.&quot;<br><br>Rachel was shaken. &quot;Half the newbies?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I might be exaggerating a little,&quot; he replied. &quot;This place used to be so much better, before we expanded.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Really?&quot; Rachel asked, intrigued despite what he&#39;d just told her.<br><br>&quot;More dangerous, but,&quot; he said. &quot;But they took better care of the newbies. Still, it wasn&#39;t like people didn&#39;t get hurt, or killed- and it wasn&#39;t just the newbies. You heard the stories about Agent Dafydd?&quot;<br><br>Rachel nodded instantly. Along with Jay, Acacia, Makes-Things, Laburnum, Foxglove, Trojanhorse, Paddlebrains, Tasmin, Allison, Tawaki, Suicide and a handful of others, the elven Agent had become legendary.<br><br>&quot;He got killed when he went into Celebrian.&quot;<br><br>Rachel let out a squeak at the name of one of the Legendary Badfics.<br><br>&quot;They sent four agent pairs into Subjugation. Nobody knows what happened to Cameo, Gunny and Wayne vanished, Rez and Flip went into hiding, Suicide and Diocletian did the same and Supernumerary was the only one to make it out. The PPC isn&#39;t safe. Don&#39;t make the mistake of thinking it is, or you&#39;ll get killed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But didn&#39;t Dafydd kill himself just to kill the fic?&quot; Rachel asked.<br><br>The older man nodded. &quot;And then he got brought back to life. That&#39;s why he&#39;s legendary. Nobody sporked badfic like him.&quot;<br><br>Rachel opened her mouth to reply when her watch chimed. She looked down and the message scrolling across its screen informed her that if she didn&#39;t get a move on, she&#39;d be late. &quot;Oh! I have to go!&quot;<br><br>The older man nodded. &quot;Good luck, kid. Just remember, keep your eyes open. It&#39;ll keep you alive.&quot;<br><br>Rachel nodded and took off at a run, ready to begin her new life.</p>

            <p>“You know how it started, don’t you?”<br><br>Arvin paused awkwardly, his hand fidgeting with the sonic screwdriver it held.  He had been about to sit back down to his desk covered in malfunctioning CADs when the older man had spoken.  As much as Arvin would have liked to get back to work, he supposed he owed it to Voctor Kamras to at least stop and hear what he had to say.  After all, most of what Arvin knew he owed to Voctor’s careful training, back when a plothole had plucked the young Argivian out of his proper time and place and stranded him in the PPC’s original headquarters.  Arvin placed his screwdriver down and leaned against the desk, watching the other technician.<br><br>Voctor relaxed as well, straightening his arms a bit before continuing.  “You remember when you first arrived in part of the PPC?”<br><br>Arvin nodded.  “In the museum.”<br><br>“Yes, the museum.  Back then, that was the <i>whole</i> PPC.  And that was where it first happened.  The Mysterious Somebody.”  Voctor started to smooth his hair away from his forehead, but seemed to think better of it and let his arm drop.  “Three agents—very idiotic, susceptible to mind tricks—brought him back from my home continuum. A <i>Sith Lord</i>, lad, can you imagine?”<br><br>Saying nothing, Arvin continued to stare over Voctor’s shoulder.<br><br>“And all because agents were foolish enough to recruit characters from out of badfics back then!  The Mysterious Somebody was the worst thing—the greatest disaster—to ever threaten the PPC.  Certainly, there were others, though none as bad as the MS.  And they were ALL badfic recruits.  It’s amazing how long it took the Flowers to instate our current policy of only recruiting background canons from outside the influence of badfics.  The chance is always present that we’ll wind up with Somebody Else just as bad.”  Voctor looked up at the ceiling, a bit longingly.<br><br>“That is, after all, why we’ve installed all the departments on different worlds now.  As you know, we at DoSAT are currently in the former headquarters of the Men in Black, which was disbanded after the existence of aliens became common knowledge to the population of this world.  The DMS is, appropriately enough, in a formerly unsettled area of Middle-earth.  Crossovers is stationed in Twilight Town in the Kingdom Hearts universe, and Bad Slash is in the old St. Mungo’s, before it was combined with that Muggle hospital.  We can accept applicants directly, and simply kill all the characters encountered in any badfic.  It’s much safer all around.”<br><br>Arvin hung his head.  “I know all this already.”  After a pause, he added, “Sir.”<br><br>“Oh.  Yes.  Of course, lad!”  Voctor chuckled in embarrassment. “I only meant—well, I wanted you to know that I’m <i>proud</i> of you for doing this.  You must always be watchful for that next Somebody Else.  And you mustn’t trust anyone…not even me.”  Voctor gave a small smile, but Arvin didn’t see it.<br><br>He couldn’t bring himself to raise his head, to look his long-time tutor in the eye as the Weeds who had been restraining Voctor pulled him to the door and led him away.</p>

            <p>Nice presentation. I like the fact that you didn&#39;t spell out the entire background story - sometimes the best stories are merely implied. It did get a bit info-dump-y in the middle - as a rule, any paragraph starting &quot;As you know&quot; is a warning sign. It feels like that information could have been worked in more gently - but then, part of the point here is that the story takes place in a very short space of time. I like the coining of Somebody Else - very evocative! - and you portray Arvin&#39;s emotions very well, particularly in the last two paragraphs. It&#39;s a shame you left that &#39;awkwardly&#39; in the opening paragraph, actually - you did such a good job of eliminating adverbs elsewhere and showing us through body language what Arvin was feeling. I like it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Thank you!  The info-dumpy paragraph seemed necessary to show how this alternate history fit in with the &quot;spread across worlds and universes&quot; part of the prompt.  I still think it adds to the things-have-changed feeling of this particular alternate future.  It also allowed me to contrast the PPC with some of the worlds it was once connected to—negatively.  The Men in Black are no longer needed to keep aliens secret; the Muggle and Wizarding worlds are coexisting on some level of harmony, or at least cooperation.  But the PPC has gone the other direction, becoming more xenophobic and physically divided within itself.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ve made a few tweaks based on you suggestions.

            <p>In the Great Years, before the death of Bast and the onset of the Urple Tide, a man arose among the PPC named Jared, called the Slayer. And it is told that, tempted by the goddess Luxury, Lady of Lust, he fell upon the maiden Traf and, in madness and love, devoured her. Now when the Gods heard this they were filled with wrath, but the Sub Rosa, who sees all, beseeches them that they send not forth Jay and Acacia to crush his skull and rend his flesh, but that they should prepare three labours for this man, that thereby he might redeem himself. And the Gods thought this good. &quot;For lo,&quot; said Constance, Mother of All, &quot;I would not see my child torn to shreds unnecessarily, and besides, it is traditional.&quot;<br><br>Then it was that the Blossoming One himself appeared to Jared the Slayer. And the first task the Sunflower Official laid before him was this: to retrieve the Three Holy Weapons from the Sues of the Mysterious Somebody – the Canon Cannon, the Book of Fandom, and the Most Holy Hat.<br><br>Long and hard Jared sought the Canon Cannon, in the wild places of deep time, until at the last he reached the lair of the foul Piratate. And fierce was their battle and many were the blows, but once only did the Piratate&#39;s Glance strike Jared, that he was filled with a lust for all women, and in return he smote her seven times, so that she died. And thus the Slayer returned the Canon Cannon to the PPC.<br><br>Now the power of the Canon Cannon is this: that by it men might travel the multiverse at will. And thus it is called the Portal, the Ready Advance. And by its power did Jared search long and hard for the Book of Fandom, in the wild places of deep improbability, until at last he reached the lair of the Slashing Demon. And fierce was their battle and many were the blows, but once only did the Demon&#39;s Gaze strike Jared, that he loved rather men than women, and in return he smote it seven times, so that it died. And thus the Slayer returned the Book of Fandom to the PPC.<br><br>Now the power of the Book of Fandom is this: that by it men may see the thoughts of their enemies even at a distance. And thus it is called the Words, the Cunning Attentive Device. And by its power did Jared search long and hard for the Most Holy Hat, in the wild places of deep unconsciousness, until at last he reached the lair of the Lego. And fierce was their battle and many were the blows, but only once did the Lego&#39;s Lovers strike Jared, that he loved no longer men nor women but became a Misogynistic Pig, and in return he smote him seven times, so that he died. And thus the Slayer returned the Most Holy Hat to the PPC.<br><br>Now the power of the Most Holy Hat is this: that by it men may change their form and move in secret. And thus it is called the Disguise Generator, the Disquieting Oracle of Randomly Kinked Sight. And now the Blossoming One appeared again to Jared and said, &quot;You have done well. Hear now your second labour.&quot;<br><br>And Jared said, &quot;No.&quot;<br><br>And the Sunflower Official said, &quot;What?&quot;<br><br>And Jared said, &quot;That was three weapons, so it was three labours. Do the maths.&quot;<br><br>And the Sunflower Official said, &quot;Hang on a minute-&quot;<br><br>But Jared the Slayer donned the Most Holy Hat and became disguised, and he fired the Canon Cannon and left that place, and he read the Book of Fandom and knew the thoughts of Jay and Acacia, and the Gods could not catch him. And it is said that, if he has not died, he lives still.</p>

            <p>I like it! You do a brilliant job of shaping a world in very few words, and the twist at the end is pure PPC. Some of the language is a bit tangled for my head - &#39;solidifying his personality into a quantum-adaptive shell that the Department of Extreme Measures could use&#39; lost me the first three times, I&#39;m afraid (ie, until this very moment I was about to ask what exactly Quantifying was), and there&#39;s a bit of a name-flood regarding the Overlay - but I like it a lot. They&#39;re believable as agents, and it&#39;s a reasonably believable future. It actually (and this is neither good nor bad) feels a bit like a classic mission in places - the action in the corridor takes a bit of a back seat to the agents&#39; dialogue. Or maybe that&#39;s just because of how late it is here...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>One of the problems with your first draft was audience accessibility. You dropped so much technobabble and odd references that an attempts at a casual read-through are defeated very quickly. While you should not, of course, try to appeal to everyone equally, you need to ensure that your writing appeals to a larger audience than just the hardcores.<br><br>This second version does an excellent job of countering all of the confusion of the first, which I applaud you for. There are still a few references that most people are definitely not going to get (I had to look up things like Lumengrid and Phyrexia) but a few of those shout-outs scattered here and there are okay.<br><br>All in all, this showed a great deal of progress.

            <p>Yeah. The quantum-adaptive shell is an idea I&#39;ve toyed around with in a few contexts- basically, the idea is that alters the surface reality of an agent based on the perception of those around them, making them invisible to canons and non-canons alike; they don&#39;t expect to see an Agent, so the shell permits them to not see one. The next logical step, then, would be taking this substance and building a being out of it. I used it here because &quot;PPC a thousand years in the future&quot; is the only setting I&#39;ve ever used conceivably advanced enough to have it.<br><br>Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t paying attention and was too interested in my idea to realize how much explaining it required; it might work in a full-length story, but it&#39;s too in-depth to put in a short. Likewise, everything I used in there was derived from MTG- again, a bit too far from the mainstream to not require large amounts of exposition that (frankly) I haven&#39;t the word count for.<br><br>Ah well, I&#39;ll do better next time.</p>

            <p>To be absolutely honest, I was impressed with most of the movie, except for the bit at the end when the Spaniards just show up and destroy the fountain. Some explanation beyond &quot;it&#39;s heathen&#39; would have been nice.<br><br>A possible explantion could be that the Spanish were acting on a deal put forth by the mermaids, as relayed through that old guy the fishermen pulled up.  Since the fountain is 1) human sacrific-y and 2) has caused mer-kind so much grief in the quest for their tears, they could have offered that, in exchange for the destruction of the fountain, they would convert to Christianity (though to the young missionarys advantage, never specifying which branch of the religion).<br><br>So, what to you all think and does anyone else have plotholes to fill? <br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>After watching the various characters and factions fighting over it throughout the movie, I took it for granted that the Spanish fleet wanted to find the Fountain for the same reasons.  So when they announced they wanted to DESTROY it, it felt like a whole new facet had been added to the conflict (not that it lasted long).</p>

            <p>We all knew from the get-go that the Fountain would be destroyed. Everyone going after it wanted something from it and 1) characters simply getting what they want is dull and 2) since Status Quo is God, the fountain couldn&#39;t be found, or if found, must be lost or destroyed.<br><br>Also, the religious conflict was handled with more tact than you&#39;d expect from your average Hollywood blockbuster. One of the main conflicts is the Catholic Spanish vs the Protestant British- the British get involved because they hear the Spanish are going after it, and they don&#39;t want their hated Papist rivals to gain the secret of eternal life.<br><br>The Spanish, meanwhile, are still a waxing colonial power, and are working hard to Catholicize the heathen natives of the areas they&#39;ve annexed. Abstract religious reasons aside, they have very valid political reasons for wanting the Fountain buried and forgotten. If nothing else, it&#39;s existence lends credence to beliefs they&#39;re in the process of suppressing. (And, let&#39;s be honest, the part where it&#39;s all human-sacrifice-y would give a lot of people moral qualms.)<br><br>As far as the merfolk are concerned, I don&#39;t think the Spanish would be inclined to deal with them, or vice-versa. Whether or not they had souls to be saved would be a valid question that the value of conversion would depend upon, and I have serious doubts that the merfolk would take humans at their words on a small matter, let alone a mass religious conversion. Besides, only that one particular mermaid had an interest in the (presumably Protestant) missionary, so on cutting a deal with the Spaniards with the intention of honoring it, it would be Papacy all the way, baby.<br><br>Honestly, the only part I was unsatisfied with was the fate of the missionary. But even that I didn&#39;t feel cheated by; it&#39;s not his story, and leaving that plot thread dangling does preserve some of the sense of mystery that surrounds the merfolk.<br><br>...sorry. Nattering. That&#39;s just what I think.</p>

            <p>I just wish that the Spanish hadn&#39;t been quite so seemingly dismissive of the Fountain&#39;s power before they destroyed it, especially considering the survival of one of De&#39;Leons crew.  Branding it as a manifestation of New World heathen devilry (what with it&#39;s sacrificial angle) and labeling it the work of Sat an as a reason for destroying it may have worked better.<br><br>On the other hand, the mermaids may have still led the Spanish to the Fountain out of their hate for it, knowing that they would probably destroy it from the tales of the old man, no conversion deal necessary.</p>

            <p>Yay, permission request!<br>Alright, down to business.<br>Character Bios:<br><br>Name:Flynn Lamare<br>Sex: Female<br>Age: 16<br>Home: Earth<br>Department: Department of Floaters<br>Appearance: She is a skinny, underdeveloped teenager with short, dirty blonde hair and blue eyes. She normally wears a black sweatshirt with the floater patch, a skort of varying color, and multicolored knee-high socks.<br>History: Flynn was an ordinary, if very geeky, teen. While riding her bike to school one day, she fell into a plot hole which led to HQ and ended up running into a wall so hard she knocked herself unconscious. A wandering agent found her and, after a quick trip to medical, recruited her.<br>Personality: She is bubbly and cheerful most of the time, only really getting mad when confronted with a paticularly bad mary sue or something else in a fic that really offends her. However, she is very absentminded and flighty. She also has a horrible weakness for cute things, though the cute things in question normally end up biting her. Often, she doesn&#39;t take missions very seriously and has on numerous occasions risked discovery going after a particularly nice bit of loot.<br>Weapon of Choice: A nice big crowbar. Or umbrella.<br>Fandoms: Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Naruto, Bleach, Doctor Who, Glee, Pokemon, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Stargate Atlantis, Star Trek 2009<br>Lust Objects: Elrond, Aang, Rodney McKay<br>Partner: Teknishun<br><br>Name: Teknishun (Tek)<br>Sex: Male<br>Age: 28<br>Home: Stargate &#39;Verse<br>Department: Department of Floaters<br>Appearance: He is a very ordinary looking young man, with mousy brown hair and brown eyes. He prefers to wear military issue BDU&#39;s and combat boots from his home continuum with all the patches replaced with PPC ones.<br>History: Tek was born in a bad Stargate SG-1 fanfic. He attempted to attack the Goa&#39;uld sue that had broken into Stargate Command and was promptly killed, both to show off her evulness and to give the human sue inside something to wangst about later on in the fic. Before he died, the agents sent to the fic brought him back to HQ and recruited him. His name comes from the author&#39;s misspelling of his former job as a &#39;gate technician.<br>He was first put into DoSAT (probably due to his name) but quickly learned that he is absolutely hopeless at operating any kind of technology that runs on nonsenseoleum. So he was transferred into the department of floaters and paired up with Flynn.<br>Personality: Tek is dry, sarcastic, and fond of pointing out the obvious. He is very military in his attitude, sticking by procedure as much as possible. He is unfortunately a bit of a prude, which causes him to suffer more than most when sent on bad slash or bad het missions. He also has a huge chocolate addiction, choosing to ingest his bleeprin mostly through NMs&amp;NMs. He always carries some type of chocolate around with him and eats it whenever he can.<br>Weapon of Choice: P-90 or any other long ranged weapon<br>Fandoms:Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Stargate &#39;Verse, Doctor Who, Firefly, Halo, Star Trek, Star Wars, Batman (movies)<br>Lust Objects:Samantha Carter, Kaylee Frye, Jennifer Keller<br>Partner: Flynn<br><br>My writing sample is here:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6866200/1/bEscaping_b_the_bLine_b">In Which I Attempt to Make Bella Swan a Likeable Character by Having Jigsaw Play a Game With Her</a><br>And the fic I plan to do first is <a href="http://www.kinsfire.net/viewstory.php?sid=3">here</a>.

            <p>For one, people doing lots of video games is actually relatively new. A lot of the oldbies worked in fandoms such as Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter, and other fandoms that have had definite badfic explosions. Mario has sort of... always remained a burbling set level of hazy terrible, and the video game division (while not new) didn&#39;t actually see so much action until somewhat recently (past 3 years I guess?

            <p><br><br>The original character has 4 chapters to himself, borrows a lot from Super Mario RPG when he wasn&#39;t a part of it. Not to mention he has a fingergun, which is Geno&#39;s and Geno <i>opens up his finger to use it</i> because he is a doll, that seems pretty much impossible.<br><br>There is an uncanonical Legend of Sarasaland that I think would be a pretty big deal that we have never heard before.<br><br>He does most everything expertly without explanation, even if he gets hurt and falls into holes from time to time. We don&#39;t know his background or how he got to be able to use these weapons. He&#39;d have no reason to be known save for an uncanonical event. This has made him uncanonically famous, somewhat. He also has pokemon in the Super Mario universe, a &#39;dragonlite&#39; (that may be a nickname, I am not sure from the writing, or a mis-spelling of Dragonite), and is I think said somewhere to be the only hope of the Mushroom Kingdom and Sarasaland (before getting Luigi).<br><br>There is a Yoshi that seems to know a healing spell, unless that was the use of an item and I can&#39;t tell if it is or not because from the description it seems magic to me.<br><br>Bowser wants to kill somebody, and although he has it out for Mario killing people is just not usually his style. Nor is talking in weird intermittent formality (&quot;Where Princess Daisy&#39;s life shall be lost&quot; ? Seriously Bowser??)<br>He also seems to shoot a bow at people. I have never seen him do any sort of archery, nor can I think that his rotund claw-fingered form would be any good at it. <br><br>Mario is slightly bashed (even if you didn&#39;t know you are doing it) in order to enable Luigi to do more heroic things. It&#39;s not a matter of you not liking Mario, it&#39;s just that you (obviously from your username) like Luigi more.<br><br>There is an uncanonical fox lady. This is not a bad thing, as she doesn&#39;t do anything to canon-wrecking, but I did find a somewhat disconcerting custom Magic the Gathering card about her that gives her super powers. Not relevant in fic, but something to think about.<br><br>Your dialogue is all bunched up into big paragraphs when it belongs one-speaker-to-each-line. <br><br>... and on and on.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>It is able to be sporked.<br><br>Sorry. <br><br></p>

            <p>Let me just say that the fingergun is completely unrelated to <u>Super Mario RPG</u>.  It&#39;s really more of a tiny gun mounted on Luigifan&#39;s finger.  (As for how it&#39;s loaded or stores its ammunition... erm... hammerspace.)  I guess I should have made clear that Luigifan&#39;s being the &quot;only hope&quot; refers mainly to his informing Mario and Luigi as to what&#39;s going on, as otherwise they might not have known that Daisy was in danger until it was too late.  Luigi&#39;s the <i>real</i> Chosen One; Luigifan is simply the messenger.  And yes, Dragonlite is a nickname for my Dragonite (I have a bit of a fondness for horribly lame puns.)  Furthermore, Luigifan&#39;s <i>not</i> an expert in everything; sure, he can be eloquent, but he&#39;s just as likely to make a complete and utter fool of himself in a social situation (a reflection of my own poor social skills.)  He&#39;s also not very athletic (again, the same is true of myself), so he has a hard time dodging attacks, running long distances (or moving quickly), etc.  Luigifan&#39;s background is my background, so it&#39;s self-evident to me, I guess - though, really, explaining everything about it would take a long time.  As for why I&#39;m famous... it&#39;s for rescuing Jumpy (the Yoshi) from Bowser, who had captured him in an effort to use him for ingredients in a birthday cake.  Yes, Bowser wanted to bake a Yoshi into a cake.  I&#39;m serious.  (Granted, I came up with <i>that</i> plot when I was <i>seven</i>.  So I can acknowledge it as ridiculous.  But, really, with teeth like that, is it unreasonable to assume that Bowser&#39;s a carnivore?!?)  And as for why the Mario Bros. didn&#39;t do it... hmm... it was 1997 when I was seven, so... *looks up what Mario games were released at the time* ...um, <a href="http://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_64">they were horribly injured in a go-karting accident</a>?  (I always did suck at <u>Mario Kart 64</u>.)<br><br>And the weapons...  I got those from the Chaos Emeralds as a result of needing to defend myself from a nationalism-berserk Kanebei (don&#39;t ask...  Let&#39;s just say that Kanebei&#39;s <i>not</i> the sort to take people dropping into his country lightly.  If Drake hadn&#39;t shown up, he probably would have killed me.)  Both that incident and <u>Super Mario Sunshine</u> precede the events of <u>Super Luigi Bros.</u>, yet Eatery (the aforementioned Bowser-attempting-to-bake-a-Yoshi-into-a-cake incident) took place about 3 years before the incident with Kanebei.  Well, three real-world years, at any rate.  Yet Bowser says that Eatery was only <i>one</i> year ago, when it really should have been about 4.  Maybe time passes a little differently in the Mushroom Kingdom...?  Nah, that&#39;s not a good justification, I just messed up my timeline.<br><br>Jumpy (the Yoshi) does indeed have healing powers (not magic; it&#39;s actually more along the lines of divine power), up to and including resurrection, but it&#39;s counterbalanced by the standard healer/magician weakness of being horribly fragile.  Plus, he has to use up his own energy to heal people, and reviving the dead takes a <i>huge</i> amount of energy, which increases the longer they&#39;ve been dead; reviving someone who&#39;s been dead for two or more weeks is outright impossible.  Jumpy also has the power to manipulate plants; his most devastating technique is a punch that makes grass materialize in the target&#39;s throat, choking them.  (Again, trying to apply logic to this will only result in headaches.)<br><br>Cassandra Belnades is actually a recent addition to the story - a retcon to put in more backstory for a character who more prominently features in my later (and currently unpublished) work.  Her ability is to copy the abilities of others (think the power that Kirby gets from TAC in <u>Kirby Super Star</u>, and you get the general idea.)  She doesn&#39;t <i>really</i> become important until my tie-in to <u>Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga</u>, where she informs Prince Peasley of Cackletta&#39;s plot so that he can inform Princess Peach (Cassandra&#39;s in the Beanbean Kingdom in the first place because her job is basically to serve as an ambassador to the Mushroom Kingdom.)  Also, all of Cassandra&#39;s siblings are in fact alive, but none of the characters know that at the time of <u>Super Luigi Bros.</u><br><br>As for Bowser killing Daisy... that&#39;s only a means to an end, namely, to get the mystical sphere so that he can use it to eliminate the Mario Bros.  (Plus, I think it&#39;s in character for him to want to make Luigi cry.)  I&#39;ll give you the whole stupid archery thing, though.  Seriously, he could have shredded her with his claws while still in the Koopa Klown Car.  There was no need to set her on a pillar and shoot arrows at her; if he was gonna do that, he should have tied her to a pole.  He <i>really</i> needs to read the Evil Overlord List.  Then again, Bowser <i>is</i> rather stupid, so... yeah.  As for the intermittent formality... he&#39;s paraphrasing the ancient text, I guess.  That, or he was up all night with Kammy Koopa rehearsing menacing speeches.<br><br>Finally... if you think the plot of Super Luigi Bros. is stupid, the sequel is basically &quot;Kamek transforms the Mario Bros. into fruit snacks and teleports them into a random kitchen.  Hilarity ensues.&quot;  See why I haven&#39;t bothered to publish it?  I only figured out the precise details of the plot when I designed it as a level pack for <u>Super Mario 63</u> (a Newgrounds flash game).<br><br>Anyways... just what the heck do you have planned?</p>

            <p>Fortunately, I can&#39;t charge for it. Because it&#39;s not in the fic. And we evaluate things based on the text of what we find.<br><br>(Though I will say that all of this is... really uncanon. Like, I sort of feel explaining it almost made it MORE sporkable than if you hadn&#39;t.)<br><br>It&#39;s rare that we get a bad fic (and it is bad, though that really only means that you have a chance to write more fics that are better, knowing what you did here) from somebody who is in the PPC itself... usually if that happens it&#39;s old shames and other stuff. If anybody was to find my old badfic (and I have no idea how they would!) I would ask somebody to spork it in an instant.<br><br>As for what I have planned? You&#39;ll just have to wait and see, if you are giving me the go ahead to do it. Just remember... it&#39;s against our credo to make fun of the author of the fic. Just the characters that bend canon into odd shapes. The funny thing is, though, because this Stu is a self insert of you (though not REALLY you, I mean, I doubt you REALLY are a pokemon trainer in real life...) and you happen to be involved with PPC materials... interesting things might happen. <br><br>And by interesting, I mean meta. And probably exciting.<br><br>And hey, if you want to use the sporked!Stu identity as a jump point for being present in the PPC, that&#39;s fine. Tons of agents are rehab&#39;d Sues or Stus... on meds and therapy to reduce their glitter and take out silly uncanon backstories.</p>

            <p>I started Chapter 7 a long time ago, but haven&#39;t done much work on it because I can&#39;t figure out how the characters are going to get past a <b>massive pillar of magma</b> that Kammy Koopa summons.  The only things I can think of are an Ice Flower (which would be introducing it <i>far</i> earlier chronologically than it&#39;s supposed to show up in the Mario series, namely <u>Super Mario Galaxy</u> and <u>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</u>) and F.L.U.D.D. (and I <i>cannot</i> justify how it could hold enough water to cool off a column of magma to the point where it solidifies and is bypassable, especially since the characters are <i>in Dry Dry Desert</i> and therefore would have an extreme interest in conserving their water.)<br><br>So, yep, big &#39;ol writer&#39;s block.

            <p>A lot of uncanon stuff. Like, think about everything I wrote about it in an earlier post. That&#39;s pretty much a full charge list.<br><br>Actually, I find 4-6 chapters the optimal sporking length. Any longer, and it gets too long to cover ALL of the story... I end up skipping over narrative so the context is lost a little, and spending valuable time in a story to explain just why X and Y is bad is a bit taxing on the flow and pacing of it.<br><br>I actually might not even wait until chapter 6 to kill it. <br><br>... writer&#39;s block? Well, I&#39;m not going to say DON&#39;T write this story more, but we both know it&#39;s not really doing any special favors for the Mario section on ff.net. Actually, in reading this over to spork, I do see some good potential in your writing, if the un-canon-ness and the multiple-speakers-per-paragraph were squared out. The main character, Gary Stu background aside, is actually not that bad in ATTITUDE and would make a decent humor self-insert character.<br><br>(Half of being a Mary Sue/Gary Stu in my opinion is unrealistic treatment of setting and characters, which he&#39;s got in spades. The other half is the attitude of entitlement/nullifying all character traits save the ones that get the Sue/Stu what she/he wants. This particular selfinsert Stu doesn&#39;t have as much of the second one. Take away all of the Stu&#39;s &#39;stuff&#39; and his glitter level is greatly reduced.)<br><br>Most of the time when go around reading marginal stories and looking for sporking material, something I see even more than the &#39;why this story breaks the canon&#39; is &#39;how this story and writer can improve,&#39; Sometimes it&#39;s very depressing because I&#39;m not going to be able to speak to the writer of the badfic in question, and leaving a review is ignored a lot of the time. Sporking this fic is actually a change of pace for me because while it&#39;s bad, it has that one redeeming quality (the lead if reimagined and brought down to normal could be funny!) that indicates that with practice, the writer could write something palatable pretty easily. Usually I try and aim for the worst of the worst for fic that has no redeeming qualities because it&#39;s distracting to think about how a fic might be better when I&#39;m supposed to be discussing why a fic is the worst.</p>

            <p>The Luigifan character is definitely an avatar of myself.  He&#39;s <i>slightly</i> more physically capable than I am, but still <i>very</i> far from the pinnacle of human capacity.  No, I don&#39;t own Pokemon in real life (well, okay, I <i>do</i> have several of the games, but not the critters, for obvious reasons), nor do I have a Fingergun or Chaos Sword or yada yada.<br><br>Also, about the Chain Link... basically, it works like Link&#39;s Hookshot from Ocarina of Time.  In other words, it&#39;s a grappling hook.  It has a very long reach, but it can be broken by a sharp object (like, say, a blade) fairly easily, forcing Luigifan to retrieve a replacement from Hammerspace (which tends to take a while) before using it again.<br><br>And I&#39;d really love to use the sporked Luigifan identity to get into the PPC.  (Maybe Cassandra could join too...)<br><br>And if you didn&#39;t guess from the surname, Cassandra Belnades is supposed to be a descendant of Sypha Belnades from the <u>Castlevania</u> series.  I haven&#39;t really worked out the details of how that&#39;s possible, and quite frankly, I don&#39;t have much interest in it...</p>

            <p>So are Suethors. Being fond of your characters does not excuse elevating them above canon, making them more Special than canon characters, giving them uncanonical powers.

            <p>It&#39;s rare for me to actually find a time when I WANT to write, and don&#39;t get writer&#39;s block when I do so.<br><br>Just be glad I haven&#39;t uploaded my very first fanfic, a Pokemon story titled &quot;Ho-oh&#39;s Wrath&quot;.  I can&#39;t find it and don&#39;t remember the details - I think I got the characterization pretty good, but the plot was totally bland (Team Rocket wants Ho-Oh, so Ash has to stop them with a generic Pokemon battle!&quot;</p>
