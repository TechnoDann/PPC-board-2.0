            <p>So I was reading the list of Things I Am Not Allowed To Do At The PPC on the wiki, and I noted that number 330 states, and I quote, &quot;I will swap Grand Admiral Thrawn with Major General Stanley.&quot; I would think that switching around canon characters would be something that is forbidden. Perhaps someone with the power to do so may wish to add in a &#39;not&#39;? It&#39;s in Part V.</p>

            <p>That could be debated. In my book, if you hang around the Board, you&#39;re a Boarder. When you get Permission, you&#39;re a PPCer. We do other things on the Board besides PPC-related stuff, so I don&#39;t think the two need to be mutually inclusive per se. <br><br>That&#39;s just my opinion, of course. Since it&#39;s a Boarder survey as well as a PPC survey, Ms. Muse here is fine either way. Really, it&#39;s just a question of semantics, but I feel the need to give my two cents...</p>

            <p>While I can&#39;t say it&#39;s the same for everyone, since it is certainly not, I spent roughly a year in the LGBT activist group on campus before I left school entirely, and at no point did we ever use heterosexual or homosexual strictly; we used gay, straight, etc. <br><br>There&#39;s nothing I consider derogatory about the word &#39;straight&#39;, and suggesting it is is rather confusing, when the vast majority of LGBTQIetc people will use more casual and friendly words, including gay, to refer to themselves. <br><br>I&#39;ll admit that as far as my way of experience goes, I don&#39;t have very much, but the thought that I should have &#39;heterosexual&#39; and &#39;homosexual&#39; up there instead, on what is supposed to be a casual survey, and on a question that isn&#39;t even required to be answered, no less, sends a slight chill up my spin because those terms are, for the most part, reserved and used in medical/psychological contexts, or by American conservatives for homophobic purposes. <br><br>The homosexual menace, can&#39;t let homosexuals near the children, etc. <br><br>The differentiation between Europe and the UK is purely one due to the fact that the UK is generally entirely English speaking, as compared to most of Europe, where, as I understand, if people know English and they&#39;re native Europeans, it&#39;s usually as a second- or third- language. <br><br>This constructs a language barrier, and historically, the PPC Board has had a large contingent of people from the British Isles. <br><br>Artell however did point out to me that the use of UK as compared to &#39;British Isles&#39; does produce a quandary for the suddenly extinct Irish people, so I&#39;ve  changed it in case we have any Irish people or elsewise lurking up in Ireland.</p>

            <p>Through numerous posts on how to write people with a different sexual orientation than heterosexual respectfully I&#39;ve become more aware of how certain words can be interpreted.

            <p>The less common ones don&#39;t really have easily recognizable nicknames. I don&#39;t think too many people would understand what I&#39;m saying if I call myself &quot;ace&quot;--they&#39;d assume I was talking about flying in WWII. But if I said I was bi or gay, they&#39;d know exactly what I meant (I&#39;m actually platonic biromantic asexual feminine-genderqueer, but that&#39;s a frigging mouthful and I never use it except when I talk about how ridiculous these terms can get). So I have to say &quot;asexual&quot;, however much it sounds like an amoeba. It&#39;s an annoyance, but I&#39;m not going to get ranty about it.

            <p>Once again It seems that I have put my foot forward only to find out that it was the wrong foot. It was not my intention to come across as denigrating toward people on the basis of their sexual orientation. I would like to clarify my thinking, and hopefully convince you that I am not the total jerk that I seem to have come across as.<br><br>The definition of Political Correctness that I was working from is this: &#39;replacing a given word with a more socially acceptable term.&#39; This is not, in and of itself a bad thing.<br><br>For example, in the 1960s during the Civil Rights movement, the common appellations for people of color - Black, Negro, etc - were pejorative, which is to say, they were intrinsically linked with negative stereotypes. There was no effective way to redeem the old appellations and so a new appellation was needed. Thus we end up with African American.<br><br>[I am now entering anecdote mode.  The following is an entirely subjective account. If you don’t feel  like reading my long-winded, biased perceptions, you may skip ahead to the next set of brackets. Otherwise, please keep your hands and feet inside the ride at all times, and enjoy the ride.]<br>On the other hand, when I was in high school, someone put forth the idea that the typical masculine default of essay writing was demeaning to women.  That someone made a loud enough demand that for a while my teacher would make it a point that we should not use &#39;mankind&#39; to refer to humanity, or &#39;he&#39; to refer to generic individuals. The first is rather simple to work around, but how do you replace a pronoun if the gender neutral, &#39;it&#39;, carries the connotations of object status? The solution: instead of using a single pronoun you had to use both; instead of &quot;when a man looks inside himself, this is what he sees,&quot; you had to write &quot;when a person looks inside him or her self, this is what he/she sees.&quot; We had to write like that every. single. sentence. The replacement was not only longer, but didn&#39;t flow as well; There was no elegance in that solution.<br><br>Now here I was, and the default that I had been trained in, the format I was comfortable with, had just been thrown out the window because someone assumed that just because I was using the masculine form that I was automatically insulting women. This irritated me. It felt like some total stranger had walked up to me out of the blue and said &quot;you think you&#39;re better than me, don&#39;t you? well you know what? I&#39;m going to penalize you for it: from now on you have to....&quot; Someone somewhere decided that the masculine default was so oppressive that it should be removed entirely, and worse, instead of simply switching to a feminine default they made us write in a ridiculous dual format, And they did this because masculinity itself was, apparently, an insult to women.<br><br>I would like to take a moment to make it clear that I have a great deal of respect for women; some of them are smarter than me, most of them multitask better than I&#39;ll ever be able to, and every single one of them is a darn sight prettier than I am. On the other hand, I am male, and I am perfectly comfortable being one, so when I project my thoughts out into the world they carry a masculine bias. I don&#39;t intend any insult to any party with that bias, it&#39;s just there. Then someone comes along and tells me &quot;you can&#39;t think from a male perspective because men aren&#39;t better than women.&quot;<br><br>Wait, What? Why don’t you just introduce a feminine default?  If you don’t want everyone making the assumption that readers are male then give the writer latitude to assume they’re all female.  Why do you restrict my choices in the name of equality instead of simply giving others more freedom to act?<br>[Now leaving anecdote mode. We hope that you had fun, and that we’ll see you again in the future.]<br><br>Now, since rant mode has dragged me rather farther afield, I’d like to summarize My perception of the topic.<br>Political Correctness = I want a new word<br><br>In the current context there are two reasons for a new word<br><br>a) Your word for me is offensive<br>b) Your word makes you sound better than me<br><br>If you are offended by the appellation I use to refer to you or your group, and ask me to use a different term in the future, I will make an effort to do so. In fact, if you do so politely, I will respect you as an individual for your levelheadedness in regards to my ignorance. If, however, you come to me and tell me that some group over there should be called a different name because the one they have makes them sound better than your group , I will make two comments: a) that the connotative definition of a word is the product of society, and b) I will ask why you aren’t confident enough in your own group to prove that your group is just as good as the other group without my help.<br><br>Society has its own perceptions, and you can’t change them by demanding that they change. If you replace a positive appellation from something that society considers truly positive, then whatever replacement you chose will eventually take on the same positive connotations. If society thinks something is better or more useful or more ‘normal’ or more common, then that same thought will carry over, no matter what you call it. Words sometimes can change perception, but perception more often changes words.<br><br>Finally, and this is the real point of my whole discussion, I don’t believe in top-down equality. Tearing down a skyscraper doesn’t add any extra stories to your house, and cutting off a taller man’s head doesn’t make the short man any less short. Progress is what you get when you pull yourself to a higher level; pulling someone down to yours only gives you the illusion of progress.<br><br>Thank you for your time. If you have any comments or criticism I welcome them, and will try to give them the same consideration that you have given me.<br></p>

When a man writes something in the masculine generic, it completely ignores and invalidates the existence of women, who are already pushing against centuries of being regarded as less than human.  You won&#39;t see the harm, since you&#39;re not a woman, but the harm exists.  I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t think that you see women as &#39;less than&#39;, but neither did all of the men who stopped them voting, divorcing, owning property . . . of course the masculine generic is a lesser evil.  But anything which implies that the only significant portions of humanity are male is the <i>same</i> evil, just a bit paler. <br><br>Words do shape thoughts.  We&#39;re writers here, we know they have power.  And asking people not to use harmful words isn&#39;t being &#39;politically correct&#39;; it&#39;s just not being a jerk.</p>

            <p>for at least giving me the chance to get off of the toes that I&#39;ve stepped on. I tend to be blunt on subjects that I feel strongly about, so I appreciate your equally blunt criticism.<br><br>a) &quot;...marginalizing is more accurate.&quot;<br><br>I don&#39;t really have a counterargument for this. It seemed a lot clearer back then when all I could see was me, as a man, being punished for writing in the masculine rather than the obvious (to me) solution of giving women the option of writing in the feminine. I have never had a problem with following a neutral (someone, person) with a feminine pronoun. It feels a bit odd to read at first, but I understand that it was written with the whole of humanity in mind.<br><br>&quot;...a movement for gender-neutral pronouns...&quot;<br><br>And if they ever make it into formal writing I will give a solemn cheer. Followed by silent cursing for using awkward-to-reach letters. I actually think that &#39;they&#39; and &#39;them will formally make the transition to  singular before the new pronouns are in, thought. And there will be much rejoicing.<br><br>b) &quot;...introduce a feminine default?&quot;<br><br>Yes, this has been done, probably with varying levels of success. The example that comes to mind is White Wolf publishing, which has used a feminine default in several of their WoD source books. The fan game Genius is also in the feminine. <br><br>c) &quot;... change them by demanding that they change&quot;<br>&quot;...working to change them&quot;<br><br>I didn&#39;t mean that society&#39;s perceptions couldn&#39;t change, although I think my point would have been clearer had I included a &#39;simply&#39; in my statement. There is a difference between demanding something and working for something, although in certain contexts demanding may be a portion of working. but you cannot simply demand something and reasonably expect it to happen. <br><br>It falls back to the concept of &quot;show, don&#39;t tell.&quot; To change society you have to make them want to change, you have to give them something that resonates in their soul so much that they have no choice but to help the change occur. Saying the same thing in the same way with different words  isn&#39;t the way to go about it. <br><br>In the end, it is every person&#39;s moral obligation to do everything they can to fix what they perceive as wrong in their society. The problem is that everyone these days seems to draw the line between right and wrong in a different place. The issue you see as the greatest detriment to progress is the same issue that another person is convinced will lead to the destruction of society. There are argumentative lines drawn with Ethos, lines with Logos, and lines with Pathos, and every line is absolutely convinced that it is the only one that matters. You only have to convince people to redraw their lines so that they&#39;re standing on your side of the field.</p>

            <p><i>...but you cannot simply demand something and reasonably expect it to happen. </i><br><br>The &#39;working&#39; part of causing change is getting enough people to also demand that society changes. When enough of society agrees with the change, society changes. <br><br>Demand <i>does</i> equal change. <br><br>I can sympathize with your his/her plight, but that&#39;s more of an argument for bad change.

            <p>What would be a neutral word? I don&#39;t think that&#39;s achievable here. Just so we&#39;re not using non-neutral as a pejorative. Being aware of bias and acting against it is much more important than sanitizing vocabulary (which is certainly important too).</p>

            <p>Overall I liked your mission. There were a few places I had some trouble following along with the canon, because I know nothing at all about Warcraft.

I prefer reading online materials that have a space between each paragraph for ease on my eyes.  That&#39;s not really a nitpick, though, more a personal preference. </p>

            <p>Sorry about the wait. Consider yourself Permissioned, official, and etcetera, quod erat demonstrandum.<br><br>One quick note, though. The PPC really isn&#39;t allowed to operate against authors - they have Rights which their characters don&#39;t, and out-of-verse, there&#39;s miles and miles of difference between killing someone&#39;s fictional character and threatening them in person. So, yeah. It&#39;d be easy enough to justify (They were OFU students who should have known better, and the visit was a &quot;please don&#39;t&quot; rather than anything more formal, perhaps), but please don&#39;t make a habit of going after authors instead of Sues. (It just causes problems.)</p>

            <p>Disclaimer: I&#39;m not a PG but here&#39;s my two cents anyway.<br><br>Start off with the bad first (there&#39;s not much of it):<br><br>1) Gillies&#39; entrance into the PPC is unlikely. The PPC&#39;s jurisdiction doesn&#39;t stretch into World One, nor would they be likely to interrupt a DnD game. The PPC is more concerned with published works. <br><br>2) The intro is informative, concise and well written, but it&#39;s not <i>funny</i>. Not even situationally funny. <br><br>If you amend Gillie&#39;s character/backstory to have a bit more likely and maybe make some other tweaks so that humor creeps in more, this would be perfect. </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t fully understand crash dummies yet, but I&#39;ve gotten the idea that when a canon character is narrating in first person, the dummy merges with the character.  The question then is: how do we get the dummy back?  It&#39;s not like I get to kill this character.<br><br>Also, when the first-person point of view switches between two characters, do I need two crash dummies, or does one automatically switch characters?</p>

            <p>...that the first-person narrative is a spirit that possesses the dummy and causes it to take the place and appearance and whatnot of the character who is narrating. As such, it&#39;s not really the canon character narrating. I think a recent mission had the agent slitting the dummy!character&#39;s throat to make it turn back into a dummy.<br><br>My guess on the second question (and it *is* only a guess) is that yes, you would need two dummies. Either that or the dummy would switch and the real canon characters would pop in and out of existence. I could be wrong, though.</p>

            <p>That won&#39;t hurt the character?  And will I be able to deal with the character directly if it&#39;s during a first-person section?

            <p>Agreed. <br><br>The case I was referring to was a fic where almost all of it was one first person narrator. It had a very brief appearance of a second first person narrator, then switched back to the original narrator.<br><br>In the case where there are more than one first or second person narrators or one of each, in the scenes for most of the time, you&#39;d need more than one dummy.</p>

            <p>So here it is, after returning to the drawing board and coming up with a completely new idea for a spin-off, the introductory permission piece is ready.<br><br>The concept:<br>Training Center 2147 will feature long time PPC Agent Monty Biggins training up the next generation of recruits.  To start with the recruits will feature a combination of characters that have either grown up in the PPC nursery and now wish to train as agents, or brand new recruits who have only just entered the world of the PPC and need to know what they are getting into.  If I’m writing the series for long enough then I may eventually have the junior agents graduate and run missions themselves, but for the time being they will be ‘in training’.  <br>In this introduction we meet the first four recruits, Steve Fontwell, Sasha Lipson, Shawn Cooper Wright and Wallis.<br><br>I hope you enjoy the piece and if you have any questions about the concept or characters feel free to ask.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o5Rq7RmU3gCRkCxTk1h-MCfrEoCHTzCt_yrEE7Wuvfo/edit?hl=en"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o5Rq7RmU3gCRkCxTk1h-MCfrEoCHTzCt_yrEE7Wuvfo/edit?hl=en">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o5Rq7RmU3gCRkCxTk1h-MCfrEoCHTzCt_yrEE7Wuvfo/edit?hl=en</a></a></p>

            <p>...I wouldn&#39;t necessarily call this a badfic. Yeah, it&#39;s in script format, but it&#39;s honestly not terrible enough to be a badfic, in my opinion.<br><br>Gilbert and Sullivan operettas are silly and utterly ridiculous by their very nature as lampooning British society in the late 19th Century. Thus, they rely on all sorts of ridiculous plot devices; think up of any contrivance in fiction, and G&amp;S probably used it for laughs in at least one of their operettas, if not more than that. Really, things adhering to some sense of logic is a big no-no in a G&amp;S operetta, as Anna Russel hilariously shows off in her parody videos on how to write a G&amp;S operetta:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yif-5xBbxd4"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yif-5xBbxd4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yif-5xBbxd4</a></a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x59vFkATXR4&amp;feature=related"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x59vFkATXR4&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x59vFkATXR4&amp;amp;feature=related</a></a><br><br>The crossover itself being utterly ridiculous comes with the territory, really.<br><br>And really, when we take into account the G&amp;S aesthetic, this guy mostly gets it right. Some of the rhythm can get a little awkward at times and the stresses in some of the lines of the patter song tend to fall on the wrong beats, but the rhymes are extremely inventive and the content of the libretto falls perfectly into that over the top W.S. Gilbert manner that they need to.<br><br>So honestly, it&#39;s not that bad, and I probably wouldn&#39;t spork it.</p>

            <p>From this mission there is a Tae-Quon-Doe, which is a Korean Water Deer (they have fangs) wearing a do-bok with a bleen belt.

            <p>Only that it was rather hyperactive, and extremely friendly. I suspect that the hyper might be remedied with proper walking/exercising, though. The Sue never walked it or did anything with it other than occasionally petting it.  It was locked in her bedroom all the time.</p>

            <p>This is something that I like to do. It is especially nice for smaller or newer fandoms that don&#39;t have an OFU or official adoption site.  Many of the various mini types now have pages on the wiki that describe them--what they look like, personality, what they eat, etc.  Then it lists all the names of minis that have been located and who adopted them. <br><br>Here are some of examples. <br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini/Sanctuary"> This is the new one for Sanctuary that I just finished </a><br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini%2FStargate_SG-1"> Stargate SG-1 </a><br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini%2FA-Team"> A-Team has a little different format </a><br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini%2FLeft_4_Dead"> Left 4 Dead demonstrates another possible format </a><br><br>Anyway, this is an easy way to keep track of who owns various minis, whether they&#39;ve been discovered or not, etc.</p>

            <p>It tends to vary.  A lot of mini&#39;s are kept by the agents who found them as pets [Just take a look at Cali and Miah&#39;s Response Center for extreme mini care.] while others are put up for adoption for other agents to adopt for thier own stories.</p>

            <p>Even though it was horrifying, and it kind of ruined red velvet cupcakes for me forever. Some of the fan-made alternate endings are awesome, though. My favorite one is the one where it turns out the whole thing takes place on the set of a movie directed by a ponified version of Alfred Hitchcock. <br><br>This fic is famous enough to have a TV Tropes page, too: <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Cupcakes"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Cupcakes">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Cupcakes</a></a><br><br>What I find cool about this fic is that Pinkie Pie... doesn&#39;t really break character, really. You know, aside from the whole mutilating Rainbow Dash to death thing. She keeps that upbeat, bubbly personality the whole time, treats it like a party, and refers to Rainbow Dash as her friend. And that&#39;s what makes it scary. It basically does to Pinkie Pie what The Sacred and the Profane did to Aziraphale.<br><br>I hear that in certain civilizations this fanfic is worshipped by bronies as a vengeful pagan deity, and every full moon they sacrifice cupcakes made of ponyflesh to it.</p>

            <p>While I&#39;ve only skimmed the fic itself (it&#39;s not something I like) and read the TV Tropes page, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that the fic is more like an exploration of what would happen if Pinkie Pie just... completely lost touch with reality. I mean, in Party of One, she definitely lost it, and honestly, were it not a kids&#39; show and she went even more overboard, it&#39;s not hard to see this happening.<br><br>It&#39;s indubitably very dark, and not everyone&#39;s cup of tea, but it&#39;s not a badfic. Just incredibly, and I mean INCREDIBLY, dark.  Also, the fan alternate endings are great.</p>

            <p>Well, it&#39;s like this.<br><br>I have a pair of Floaters working a &#39;Sue in the Redwall continuum. It&#39;s this real crackfic; it was originally written in Russian, then sent through some cheap-as-free translation software into English. <br><br>So, due to circumstances that are ENTIRELY their own faults and NOTHING to do with my desire to torture my characters at every possible opportunity, they have to sink a cruise ship roughly the size of the Titanic with a sword, a bow, and a dozen arrows. Oh, yes, and said cruise ship is occupied by upwards of three dozen canonical rats that they are allowed to kill under no circumstances. Oh, and one of them is possesed by the Author-Wraith of the fic, merged with Cluny the Scourge, horribly mutated (beyond being merged with Cluny), and therefore only sporadically helpful, if at all, so this all has to be accomplished by only one Agent. Oh, and said Agent has a completely unmedicatd case of ADHD, an leather armchair he&#39;s lugging around and totally unwilling to give up, and a mini-Deepgloomer (named George) currently living in a Nalgene bottle.<br><br>...<br><br>I appear to be up a tree without a creek, paddled into a hole, dug into a corner, painted to a point where I can&#39;t do something else humorous, et cetera, et alii, ad nauseam. <br><br>Ahem. And so, dear friends, I beseech you. Please, help a brother out, so he does not have to rewrite ten damn pages and can post this freakin&#39; mission already. Thank you. God bless.<br><br>L&#39;Homme Arbre<br><br>P.S. Oh, and before someone suggests it, just letting this slide under &#39;Acceptable margin of error&#39; isn&#39;t going to happen. Namely because the &#39;Sue they&#39;re trying to kill has already died in the fic. Twice. And is still walking around. Well, crawling around, since her legs have detached from her body and are moving independantly. Oh, and despite her legless condition, she&#39;s desperately trying to make out with the mutated Cluny/Agent thing in a way that will make it look like she&#39;s being raped. <br><br>Yeah. Any acceptable margin of error that ever existed has been exceeded (with <i>style</i>) a long, long time ago. </p>

            <p>Hey, folks. So I&#39;ve been poking around the wiki, particularly the DCPS-related sections, and because I was involved when it first got off the ground, Nesh has asked me to help expand the information there. <br><br>Well, the DCPS that I remember is quite different from the DCPS featured in surviving missions. That&#39;s fine and all, but I was hoping to pursue something more similar to the original idea. That is, agents/workers working more closely with characters pulled so OOC that they need one-on-one but not severe enough to go to CharPsych. The difference, if you will, between a counselor and a psychologist. The department was formatted to a large room full of semi-spacious, heavily customized cubicles (there was only an LotR-focused presence at the time, presumably large fandoms would have their own rooms full of cubicles and tiny fandoms would share space and potentially workers). <br><br>In the end, I have three(ish) questions:<br>- Is anyone still active who has/is work(ed/ing) with DCPS, and if so what can you tell me about its current form, and about its Flower?<br>- Would it be considered Officially Cool by the PTB for me to go ahead and redevelop the old school DCPS and write missions for that format of a department? <br>- If the answer to that is yes, then my instinct is to develop it as a separate division within the department. Are we Cool with that too?</p>

            <p>...Nor am I very familiar with the DCPS. However, I can tell you that making new divisions is generally frowned upon, especially when an older division would only require the slightest of tweaks to serve just as well. That may explain why your memories of the DCPS are different from what&#39;s currently the case; someone tweaks it a little, someone else tweaks that a little, suddenly everything&#39;s changed. It happens. <br><br>That said, there&#39;s really not much preventing you from tweaking back in the other direction, towards what you remember. That would probably be easier (and more PTB-friendly, from what I can gather) than making a whole new division. </p>

            <p>...and I would quite happily do it that way. It certainly makes it easier for me. The only reason that I am inclined to make a distinction of divisions is that the two concepts are almost wholly different from each other. The original DCPS had practically nothing to do with a traditional mission format, whereas the stories still in existence are very much set up that way. </p>

            <p>Where is your source that separation of church and state was meant to keep State out of Church. BESIDES opinion pieces on the matter on conservative websites. Give me historical basis. The politics of the 1770s hardly suggest that protecting ANYTHING from the church in America was any sort of concern of the time. And if you don&#39;t believe me, I have textual proof. Check out the Treaty of Tripoli, 1796: <br><br>&quot;As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity, of Musselmen; and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.&quot;<br><br>If you don&#39;t believe this, have a link to <a href="http://www.dirtandseeds.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/treaty-of-tripoli.jpg">an image of the document</a><br><br>And the British American colonies were primarily protestants fleeing Catholic-controlled Britain. You know? the ones who REJECT the Pope? This country was not founded by &#39;Christians&#39; as you claim. Most of the founding fathers were Freemasons and followers of deism. <br><br>I&#39;m not trying to change your opinion, make you question your faith, or attack you. I just want to... make you aware that some of what you are saying is <i>factually</i> wrong. That&#39;s not subjective, faith-based, or a matter of opinion. That&#39;s very dangerous. You are not preserving the true history of the United States of America. You are being as uncanon as a slash-fic writer who thinks that men can become pregnant and deliver a baby to term in two weeks time is.<br><br>It&#39;s ok to like slash, a pairing, or some other fandom subset. Nobody should stone you to death for what you believe.<br><br>Just please. Do NOT mess up US historical canon.<br><br>DO NOT DO IT. You look as bad as somebody who thinks that Superman and Lex Luthor are canonical butt buddies when you do it. You are being fundamentally incorrect.<br><br>So don&#39;t get mad when other people jump down your throat. Here at the PPC we get mad at people who think fundamentally wrong things about canons. <br><br>Why shouldn&#39;t other people be allowed get mad at those who believe wrong things about other canons... specifically the canon of the real world?<br><br>Your religious beliefs and opinions aren&#39;t wrong or worthy of attack. But the facts you put up to back them up are. In the same way somebody who claims the moon landing never happened, they&#39;re just... wrong. :|</p>

            <p>Thomas Jefferson spoke of a &quot;wall of separation&quot; between church and state. There is no such thing as a one-way wall. (Well, okay, in HQ there might be, but I&#39;m talking Euclidean geometry here. ;P)  Religion&#39;s chocolate is meant to stay out of the state&#39;s peanut butter and the state must in turn keep its peanut butter out of religion&#39;s chocolate.<br><br>Also, the Founding Fathers were mainly deists.<br><br>The United States has absolutely no language in its founding documents that explicitly states that it is a Christian nation. Ergo, any faith-based argument for laws in the United States is inherently unconstitutional, as stated in the First Amendment: &quot;<b>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof</b>; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot; [Emphasis mine.]<br><br>The words &quot;an establishment of religion&quot; do not just mean &quot;am institution of faith&quot;, they mean &quot;establishing a state religion&quot;. To quote Barry Goldwater (four words I thought I would never type, by the by), &quot;You can&#39;t legislate morality.&quot;<br><br>While I am not QUILTBAG myself, I&#39;m certainly QUILTBAG-friendly, and I feel that I must defend the honor of Messrs. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams et al. wherever possible.<br><br>Speaking of whom, a little food for thought:<br><br>&quot;Christianity neither is, nor ever was a part of the common law.&quot; -Thomas Jefferson, letter to Dr. Thomas Cooper, February 10, 1814<br><br>&quot;In every country and every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty.  He is always in alliance with the despot ... they have perverted the purest religion ever preached to man into mystery and jargon, unintelligible to all mankind, and therefore the safer engine for their purpose.&quot; - Thomas Jefferson, letter to Horatio Spafford, March 17, 1814 <br><br>&quot;Lighthouses are more helpful than churches.&quot; - Benjamin Franklin<br><br>&quot;The purpose of separation of church and state is to keep forever from these shores the ceaseless strife that has soaked the soil of Europe in blood for centuries.&quot; - James Madison, 1803 letter objecting use of gov&#39;t. land for churches<br><br>Oh, oh, and my personal favorite:<br><br>&quot;But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no God. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.&quot; -Thomas Jefferson, Notes on Virginia, 1782<br><br>The same thing could apply to QUILTBAG rights. Unless you are in the affected group, the existence or lack thereof of marriage rights for people who aren&#39;t &quot;insert-tab-A-into-slot-B&quot; neither picks your pocket nor breaks your leg.<br><br>One more thing as well - the Treaty of Tripoli, submitted to the Senate by John Adams and ratified in 1797, contains this interesting clause:<br><br>&quot;As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion, — as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen, — and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.&quot;<br><br><b>&quot;As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion&quot;</b> - right there in writing.<br><br>As Voltaire said, &quot;I may disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.&quot; But if you are going to construct an argument on why you believe that your beliefs should be injected into the political discourse of the United States, kindly refrain from building your arguments on a foundation of false data.<br><br>Also, genuinely curious - what passages are you using to justify homosexuality being wrong in the eyes of God, and why do you believe religion ought to affect the laws? Would you feel the same way if the Founders were, say, Druids?</p>

            <p>Speaking as someone who was bullied into silence by people who used the same reasoning as you, because I admitted feelings to my best friend (who happened to be female like myself), I have to honestly say it hurts.<br><br>It hurts to know that it wasn&#39;t just some group of overzealous teenagers, telling me I wasn&#39;t right in the head or not human or any number of names that I won&#39;t list here, but to know it&#39;s someone within a community I frequent and have ties to?<br><br>Why should marriage between two happy people who wish to be together be exclusive? Why should it be okay for people like say, Newt Gingrich or Britney Spears be allowed to have shotgun marriages and divorces, but Joe and Steve who have been faithful to each other for 20+ years, and have been living together can&#39;t. As such, they are denied rights married couples have, such as hospital visitation, and so on.<br><br>Call me a socialist, but to deny equal rights to everyone just because some of the population happens to love someone with the same junk in their pants (or to just not care if the junk is similar or not, or so on), seems messed up to me.<br><br>And, if you try and argue that homosexuality doesn&#39;t happen in other species, I ask you to please google &#39;Whiptail Lizards&#39;- They&#39;re a species of lizard which only has female lizards, as they are asexual. Even though the female lizards have the ability to self fertilize their eggs, they must still have &#39;intercourse&#39; to do so. Heck, I suggest you look up damn near any species, and lo and behold, you&#39;ll find homosexuality.</p>

            <p>Usually, speaking <i>only for myself</i> and from personal experience, attraction to the opposite sex is dealt with the same way you&#39;d deal with a constant urge to kill someone. By burying it, trying to ignore or stamp it out, and refusing to give in to the feelings because you believe they&#39;re sinful. It&#39;s incredibly painful.<br><br>And it comes down to another sin/sinner thing. You didn&#39;t choose to have the feelings, but you would be choosing to fulfill them, so you &quot;choose&quot; to remain &quot;innocent.&quot; Or sinless. Or whatever synonym you can think of. My issue with that is that it results in unhappiness, and pain, and trauma. Why would a loving God give people feelings of romantic love only to deal punishment for acting on them? It&#39;s the act of a sadist, not the act of any God I believe in. And so, the choices come down to this for me: did God create QUILTBAG people only to force them into either lives of unhappiness and shame or Hell? Or have we just been mistaken about the nature of God for a long time?<br><br>As a Christian, I believe it&#39;s far more likely that humanity has erred than that God has.</p>

            <p>&quot;Also, don&#39;t kill me, please.&quot;<br><br>Don&#39;t try to play the victim card. As odious as your stance is, you have the right to hold it. And many, many people in the US are actively exercising this right, and doing their part in regressing the country back to the dark ages. <br><br>Take, for instance, the Texas school board&#39;s decision to excise Thomas Jefferson from the curriculum, instead adding Thomas Aquinas. Jefferson was merely the author of the Declaration of Independence, the third President of the United States, and one of its foremost statesmen. Of course, he also authored the Jefferson Bible - a Bible keeping the messages of benevolence and mercy intact, but removing the supernatural elements of the Logos, in an effort to salvage the heart of Christian compassion from the justified critiques of reason.<br><br>My friend, an educated theologian with a Master&#39;s in Divinity, put it best: besides all other commandments and rules, the most important one is the Golden Rule. But a disturbing number of Christians, especially in the US, are doing their best ignoring it. I&#39;m an atheist, but I appreciate the teachings of Jesus, and it pains me to see them ignored so flagrantly: attacking instead of defending the disadvantaged, the poor, the ostracized; hoarding wealth, when in the New Testament, the one offence that would get you struck right down into Hell was not helping your fellow man.</p>

            <p>&quot;Are you saying the point of the Bible is not showing compassion and love to your fellow man, but parlour tricks with wine, fish and bread?&quot;<br><br>Actually, and not speaking for Jacer, yes, compassion and love to our fellow men is secondary.  The entirety of the Holy Word lead up to one event, and that was the redemption of man through Christ&#39;s death and resurrection.  He didn&#39;t come to bring peace, harmony, and zen to your inner chakra or those around you; he came to save you from yourself.  That&#39;s it.  If, through your salvation, you are a better person for it, great!  As it should be.  But it&#39;s not a giant Holy Book of daily etiquitte.

            <p>I&#39;m not going to pander to someone who gets hung up on a tiny little detail from Deuteronomy and uses a small handful of verses to justify legislating hatred against something he can&#39;t understand because he doesn&#39;t want to understand it while also missing the larger message of &#39;love&#39; by trying to force a way of living onto them with the consideration of a brute.<br><br>No. YOU will do the following:<br><br>-Show me the passages in the Bible where Jesus got sinners to repent their sins by saying they were beyond forgiveness and deserved to be punished by the law of the land for their sins.<br><br>-Show me the passages in the Bible where Jesus actively tried to punish those who sinned against him with words of hatred and anger.<br><br>Oh wait.<br><br>As closing, I will give you this passage from the Bible about hypocrisy, which is the sin you are guilty of in this case for clearly ignoring the love part of the bible:<br><br>&quot;Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother&#39;s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, `Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,&#39; when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye?

            <p>I&#39;m a Christian, but I disagree with the way Jacer&#39;s handled this. <br>I personally do not support the proposed Texas bill (pertaining as it does to marriage as a civil institution rather than a religious institution. There&#39;s a whole lot of heterosexual couples who don&#39;t meet the definition of a &quot;Christian&quot; marriage with their divorcin&#39; and sleeping around. Hence there&#39;s a distinction between the &quot;civil&quot; definition marriage and the &quot;Christian&quot; definition, and I see no problem with the &quot;civil&quot; definition being open for gay, trans, whoever being married. As VM has said, America is an officially secular country, not a theocracy. I only wish they didn&#39;t share the same word, to avoid confusion, but that&#39;s a whole different discussion.<br><br>That said, just putting it out there: the New Testament also speaks on the subject of homosexuality (amidst a myriad of other sins), so it&#39;s not just an Old Testament thing. As a non-exhaustive list:<br><br>Romans 1:27<br>1 Corinthians 6:9<br>1 Timothy 1:10<br><br>But... Christianity and the Bible teach that everyone is sinful and has fallen short of God&#39;s standard. Gay, straight, trans, you, me, the Pope; you name it. So it&#39;s not a matter of singling out any particular group or person or sin from hatred. I think the church gets hung up on issues of sexuality perhaps a bit much, seeing as Jesus preached on love of money and selfishness more than He preached on sexual sin. But neither does He condone it when he comes across it - John 8:7-11 is a good example of &quot;love the sinner, hate the sin&quot;:<br><br><i>&quot;“Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” 8 Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. <br><br>   9 At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. 10 Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?” <br><br>   11 “No one, sir,” she said. <br><br>   “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.”</i><br><br>Jesus does not condemn her, he acts out of love, but He <i>does</i> call for her to leave her life of sin.<br><br>I guess my point is that loving someone doesn&#39;t have to mean approving or condoning their actions, but equally that you don&#39;t have to abandon your sense of right and wrong to be loving as Jesus commanded, and nor should you.<br><br>Elcalion<br></p>

            <p>About halfway through a heavy-duty analysis of those three passages last night. I&#39;ll post it when I&#39;ve got it done, but it basically boiled down to &quot;context, context, context.&quot; Romans was talking about the consequences of being an idolator or false prophet - in which your life will basically fall apart in a hurry. Corinthians was Corinthians - written to the Vegas of the ancient world, it was a &quot;Hey! You&#39;re supposed to be <i>living differently!</i>&quot;, and the original text was condemning things to the tune of mass orgies, frequenting child prostitues, and so on. Timothy was similarly advice to a young man, basically a reminder that he couldn&#39;t let anything distract him from his mission.<br><br>It&#39;s all about the context. Seriously. Never, in the New Testament, that I&#39;ve been able to find, does it straight-up say that homosexuality, actualized or hypothetical, is a sin.</p>

            <p>&quot;Separation of Church and State was meant to keep the State out of the Church, not the other way around.&quot;<br><br>Speaking as an atheist, I take issue with this.  This country is a secular nation, regardless of who &quot;founded&quot; it.  Many of the founding fathers were actually deists, having no religious affiliation whatsoever.  Only three were Roman Catholic.<br><br>Religious affiliations aside, I would like to draw your attention to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tripoli#Article_11">Article 11 of the Treaty of Tripoli.</a>:<br><br>&quot;Art. 11. As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion,—as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen,—and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.&quot;<br><br>This article was signed into action by John Adams and ratified unanimously by the US Senate.  Pay particular attention to the very first sentence.<br><br>This is not a Christian nation.  It is not a Muslim nation.  It is not an atheist nation.  It is a secular nation.  The State <i>must</i> take a neutral stance on all matters of religion.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m going to follow the Catechism and Pope on what they teach about homosexuality etc.&quot;<br><br>Then you may by all means do that.  If you don&#39;t want a gay marriage, then don&#39;t have one.  However, that does not allow you to dictate the rights of those around you.<br><br>&quot;Marriage is not a right. It never has been. And it is between one man and one woman.&quot;<br><br>Then why is there a legal definition of it?<br><br>&quot;Also, don&#39;t kill me, please.&quot;<br><br>Don&#39;t worry.  I only eat babies.</p>

            <p>Christians are the ones that get bashed? I suppose you&#39;ve had death threats due to your religion or sexual orientation, then? Or maybe as a child you had friends whose parents told you that you couldn&#39;t play with their children because your religion was wrong? Oh, or maybe you&#39;ve been beat up repeatedly because you worshiped a different god from the other kids, while the teacher just watched? No? Then it&#39;s pretty hard for me to have any kind of sympathy for you, when this shit has happened to me just because I happen to like people of any gender, and because I&#39;m not Christian. Apparently following the goddess of luck and fate is enough reason for some people to hate you.</p>

            <p>Well, July stole everything I was going to say, and said it better than I would&#39;ve. (Also she&#39;s actually Catholic, which makes it better.)<br><br>I would, however, like to add that there&#39;s a difference between stating your opinion and stating your opinion in such a manner that makes this forum an unsafe/uncomfortable place for our QUILTBAG* members, and I don&#39;t appreciate that. Being cisgendered myself, it can be easy to forget how our words effect someone who is discriminated against and marginalized every day-- I&#39;d appreciate choosing your words with a little more care. Telling someone their operation is disgusting, their identity is a disorder-- not cool. To say the least.<br><br>Also-- your points on religion don&#39;t address the fact that <i>this is not a theocracy</i>. The United States is entirely unaffiliated with Catholicism, Lutheranism, Baptism, Satanism, Paganism, Islam, Episcopalianism, and/or any other religions you care to name. The laws that say who can and cannot get married, have operations, or whatever else-- they don&#39;t have anything to do with your religious beliefs, or mine. They have only to do with the rights of their citizens. &quot;Not being offended&quot; is not on the same level, as a human right, as &quot;Being allowed to get married.&quot;<br><br>*term picked up from various folks on Slacktivist, a liberal evangelical blog: Queer, Undecided, Intersex, Lesbian, Transgender, Bisexual, Asexual, Gay.</p>

            <p>As an American, you&#39;re supposed to be free to believe what pleases you and live your life according to your beliefs. This bill is attempting to strip that right from the people of Texas. Whether you personally believe that being transgender is okay or not, if you value your own right to live the life that&#39;s right for you regardless of whether other people agree, then opposing this bill is the right thing to do. That&#39;s really all there is to it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m Catholic too. And I don&#39;t agree in the least.<br><br>Let&#39;s begin with what you&#39;ve listed here.<br><br>&quot;I firmly believe that male is male and female is female, and what we are born is what we&#39;re meant to be.&quot;<br><br>Gender and sex  are different items; gender refers to one&#39;s mental state, and sex refers to one&#39;s physical and genetic standpoint. It&#39;s been proven scientifically that gender is entirely an item of the brain, and that in people who are transgendered, their brains match that of their claimed gender. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m also a staunch supporter of traditional marriage.&quot;<br><br>I am too. A traditional marriage is comprised of two people who are in love with each other and, according to our religion, undertaking a covenant under God to be together and that they love each other and that this is important enough to them that they want to spend their lives together and be bonded together as one.<br><br>What makes a marriage strong, healthy, and long lasting? Love, or the fact that it&#39;s a man and a woman? What is more pleasing to God? Two people who love each other deeply, forever, or Britney Spears&#39;s 55-hour marriage?<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t believe gender identity or homosexuality is something we&#39;re born with, I believe they&#39;re disorders.&quot;<br><br>Funny. Left handedness is actually linked to many disorders, but we don&#39;t call them sinful or unnatural.<br><br>Oh wait, we did.<br><br>Left handed people used to be beaten or hurt and generally victimized if they showed themselves to favor their left hand. Godless, sinful, unnatural, and all that.  <br><br>&quot;And I find sex change operations disgusting.&quot;<br><br>That is completely a personal matter of opinion and has nothing to do with your statement as it involves religion or people&#39;s rights. I too find operations and surgery disgusting in general, but they&#39;re a part of life, and that is important for many people and ensure they are able to have the quality of life they deserve as fellow human beings.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m well aware that people on here probably won&#39;t consider my religious beliefs as a valid argument, and might even say it&#39;s offensive to state them. But you did ask.&quot;<br><br>No, you did not use your religious beliefs as a valid argument or as a good reason at all; all your reasons had NOTHING to do with being Roman Catholic or any sort of Christian at all. An atheist or agnostic could have easily stated the same reasons as you.<br><br>If you&#39;re going to claim the religion card, particularly Catholicism or any branch of Christianity, remember first and foremost that we&#39;re part of a religion where we chose to follow someone who STATED to us, who TOLD us that we should give to the needy, feed the poor, tend to the ill, and that we should treat everyone well, no matter what, and that everyone is loved, no matter what. <br><br>Look at the tale of the Good Samaritan. Or failing that, go read your Bible again. New Testament, to be precise. Failing that, go talk to your priest and ask him the importance of loving everyone no matter what and being good to others. <br><br>Because? We&#39;re all sinners, regardless of what we do or who we are, and we&#39;re all equal in the eyes of God, theologically. He who has not sinned should toss the first stone, and all that. Trying to tell someone that they&#39;re unnatural and doomed to go to hell because they&#39;re trying to be who they are falls against that, and is denying our basic nature.<br><br>Closemindedness is not following our faith, and is actively turning away from the guiding principles that are the basis of our faith.<br><br>&quot;Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.&quot; -Matthew 7.1-3</p>

            <p>First off, for the record, the Bible has nothing to say about transgender people. (Er. I&#39;m 98% sure.) So any bigotry and &quot;It&#39;s against God!&quot; crying here is entirely the thoughts of mankind.<br><br>Second off, the problem lies not with the religion itself (in my opinion) - and even if it did, bigots are entitled to their opinions, and churches who will not sanction transgender marriages are entitled to that right. The problem comes when people try to force their religion into law - this is not a theocracy. The cry generally goes &quot;Secularism!&quot; in about the same tone as you&#39;d shout &quot;Baby-eating!&quot; But honestly, if this is not a secular country, the only other option is a country of one particular religion, because I doubt that the answer to keeping the &quot;Secularism!&quot;-criers happy is to adopt Wicca as the national religion, or Islam. And I mean, Heaven <i>forbid</i> we actually have FREEDOM of religion...<br><br>*cough*<br><br>Anyway, my point is that the entire religion isn&#39;t to blame, just those voices who appear to think that the Founders put the &#39;freedom of religion&#39; thing into the Bill of Rights because they <s>were complete idiots who</s> thought that the entire world and all immigrants would always believe exactly as they did <s>which actually isn&#39;t even the same sect as most of Christianity - even the Constitutional &#39;literalists&#39; - for the record</s>. I prefer to think that our Founders were not stupid, and put the &#39;freedom of religion&#39; thing in because... they believed in freedom of, and necessarily therefore, freedom from religion.<br><br>...*climbs off the soapbox*<br><br>Anyway!

            <p>The long and short of it is, people are using the Bible to say things they want it to say, when it doesn&#39;t actually say anything of the sort. I can only assume they do this because they think that claiming the Bible says something makes their argument immune to logic or something...<br><br>I have a history with Christian fundamentalism myself, and I saw the way they treated anybody who didn&#39;t act the way they wanted them to. I nearly lost my faith over that. But they made one mistake... they forced me to read the Bible. All the way through, and multiple times. And I realized something: They weren&#39;t actually preaching the Bible at all. They were preaching their own subculture. They were making claims that had little to do with the Bible at all.<br><br>So yeah. When you see this stuff--it&#39;s not representative of Christianity, any more than suicide bombers are representative of Islam or the Soviet prison camps were representative of atheism. People will take an ideology and pervert it, take little bits out of context, then claim that it says whatever they want it to say. Don&#39;t believe them--check it out for yourself.</p>

            <p>Maybe others don&#39;t mind, but the random paragraphing makes it really hard for me to read (I only got through the introduction). It&#39;s distracting to the eye, and it makes it hard to tell who&#39;s speaking unless you specifically identify them. I recommend doing away with the indents (unless you can figure out how to standardize them) and using a double line-break after each paragraph.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t know whether Tranum&#39;s gone back and made edits, but to me the paragraphs look very weird. First I thought the indentation of paragraphs was random. Then I noticed that only paragraphs that start with dialogue are indented and paragraphs that start with description aren&#39;t. All paragraphs should be treated the same when it comes to indenting, and all indentations should the same size. (or just go for no indentations, but a blank line between paragraphs, like on FFnet.)<br><br>The mission didn&#39;t really pull me in, but that could just be me.

            <p>First, does Star have an advertising contract, either with the provider of this board or the admins thereof? I doubt it: legitimate ads are posted here are in image form and in the space allotted. The only ad deleted recently was a nigh-incomprehensible spam ad for Viagra, which can hardly be considered effective or targeted advertising. If one of your people posted that, I suggest you fire them immediately.<br><br>If your firm does not have a contract with the provider or the admins, then your advertising is considered unsolicited. The principle behind selling ad space is simple: money is exchanged in order to provide further access to a potential customer base. Space and access are valuable and worth being paid for. If someone attempts to use a dedicated forum for advertising purposes without properly paying for the privilege (thus anticipating possible compensation from advertising revenues) they are attempting to hijack something and not pay for it. That would be theft.<br><br>In addition, any incomprehensible word-salad ad for Viagra that a board full of trained writers and linguists couldn&#39;t figure out is likely not Legal Advertising. Pfizer Inc., which makes the drug in question, has millions of dollars to spend on real targeted ads--and they are the ultimate authority when it comes to selling Viagra. That would mean your company is either selling a drug without having the right to do so (since someone selling it legally would put at least two seconds of thought into their ad), or selling a knockoff and calling it the real thing. Both are not allowed.<br><br>Furthermore, where have you been? Censorship is rampant on the Internet. It does not, however, constitute censorship to remove an incomprehensible, annoying, unpaid-for and questionably legal ad from a public space where it wasn&#39;t supposed to be in the first place.

            <p>I get the feeling this is an automated (poor) attempt at a &#39;scare&#39; message. I&#39;ve seen this kind of thing before, a spammer has several auto-post bots (the likes of which posted the word salad), and then a monitor that will wait until the spam is deleted and then post this. <br><br>In most cases the &#39;advertising agency&#39; doesn&#39;t even exist. The poster&#39;s handle gives a clue to this, it seems like another computer-generated username, using a slightly different algorithm.<br><br>(PS. I feel I should mention that about three other spammy messages were posted and subsequently nuked earlier today)</p>
