            <p>There&#39;s  something that I and others have been noticing increasingly with newer spinoffs, which is that they rather lack something that earlier spinoffs and even the original series had: Intertextuality. Beyond sharing a common setting (the PPC) and a very small subset of characters (Makes-Things, Luxury, the Flowers, Docs Fitzgerald and Freedenberg), there is, quite literally, nothing connecting most spinoffs these days to each other. While cowrites might occur, they remain as brief, ephemeral things, that are rarely mentioned afterwards or have little bearing on connecting the spinoffs involved. <br><br>In short, spinoffs have become fairly insular.<br><br>So this challenge is to encourage everyone to break that habit!<br><br>By which, I mean the core of this challenge is to work references into your PPC works to other spinoffs, agents, and events that take place at HQ or in the missions of others. <br>to you<br><br>To make it extra fun, everyone can organize into teams (of four individuals at the most) to compete for a prize; a trophy for the group, and invididual prizes: art, intense beta/thinktank, or a story with a prompt as decided by you.<br><br>To qualify for the challenge, a story has to take place in your spinoff. Each reference in a piece- regardless of if it is a mission or otherwise- earns one point, with a maximum of five points per piece. <br><br><b>How this works:</b> <br><br>Bringing up a character that does not belong to you (but is not a communally used character) counts. <br><br>-Characters that do not count for this are the Flowers, Luxury, Dr. Fitzgerald, Dr. Freedenberg, Makes-Things, and any character that has not been in a story after 2008.<br><br>-Techno-Dann counts only for half a point due to being a recently prominent character. <br><br><i><b>Example:</b> Orken (written by Guvnor) mentioning Ilraen (written by Neshomeh) counts for one point.</i> <br><br><i><b>Example:</b> Fritz (written by Joe) bringing up Narcolepsy (also written by Joe) does not count.</i><br><br><i><b>Example:</b> Pam (written by DML) mentioning Dann (owned by Techno-Dann) counts for half a point.</i><br><br><i><b>Example:</b> Lucius (written by Tray-Gnome) mentioning the Marquis (a Flower) does not count.</i><br><br>Bringing up fic that your character could have heard about being assigned to another group counts if the fic has been covered in another mission.<br><br>-Fics featured in missions from before 2009 do not count for this.<br><br><i><b>Example:</b> Bringing up Cupcakes as a mission counts for one point.</i><br><br><i><b>Example:</b> Bringing up C*l*br**n as a mission does not count.</i><br><br>Bringing up events count for a point as long as they occured in 2009 or later.<br><br><i><b>Example:</b> Mentioning the events that occured in the thread- or rather, the existence of the mp3 and the forwarded messages- with the ICEP messages would count. </i><br><br><i><b>Example:</b> Bringing up the Macrovirus Emergency and subsequent Sue Invasion of 2008 does not count.</i><br><br><i><b>Example:</b> Bringing up Makes-Things&#39; death does not count.</i><br><br><i><b>Example:</b> Bringing up Makes-Things&#39; </i>return<i> would count.</i><br><br><i><b>Example:</b> Bringing up Cadmar (written by Caddy-Shack) and his shark teeth and current genderbent status would count.</i><br><br><b>Bonus Points:</b><br><br>There are two methods to gain bonus points for this challenge.<br><br>The first is to have this interplay directly affect the mission and whatever is happening in there by impacting the storyline in a way that the characters are placed under pressure in it and must face an obstacle to overcome. This gains a piece an additional 3 points beyond the 5 point limit, but requires there to have been a previous event earlier in the spinoff to allow it to happen.<br><br><i><b>Example:</b> Dann and Pam steal ammunition from a Call of Duty badfic, but by Operation Sue Hunt, Pam has depleted the ammunition because she doesn&#39;t shoot well, leaving them only with a handful of flashbang grenades, and nothing else. Because Pam used up all their ammunition, their original plan to go gun down the sue can&#39;t be done, forcing them to improvise and come up with a plan that doesn&#39;t involve using their guns. </i><br><br>The second is to have back and forth references between two or more spinoffs. Once all involved spinoffs have completed a cycle of three or more pieces each with this back and forth, each writer earns an additional five points. This is usually easiest to complete through a cowritten mission or interlude and suggesting that events or discussion that had begun in the cowritten piece is continuing off the page and between what is shown in the text.<br><br><i><b>Example:</b> Two agents (written by two different people) end up in Medical at the same time, and begin talking in a cowritten piece. The first agent brings up the discussion in their spinoff with additional information that suggestions the dialogue has continued and the agents are still meeting each other to talk. The second agent also brings up the discussion with further information, or mentions meeting the first agent to talk more. The cycle repeats until it reaches a point where it is finished. References that apply to the previous examples still gain points. </i><br><br>If you don&#39;t want your agents mentioned by others, please bring this up.<br><br><b>Considerations:</b><br><br>A few things to consider, one in-universe and the others while writing:<br><br>Agents are probably interested in their environment- the PPC- and their colleagues as a general rule- HQ is their main location for socializing with people who are not their partner, and very few people would be willing to spend all of their free time with someone they work with. <br><br>If you like a spinoff -especially if it is one that gets less attention!- mention it in yours. <br><br>Avoid stuffing references in randomly just to gain points! Organic conversations about what&#39;s going on can happen if your agents are having a boring moment in a fic while waiting for something to happen, but just throwing it in at a random in will throw others off. Reference with relevance.<br><br><i><b>Example:</b> In one as of yet unpublished mission dating back to 2008 that I still need to finish, I bring up Trojie and her previous partner due to a fire extinguisher Library is using on JF because the latter has an issue with combusting. Trojie&#39;s partner had a similar problem.</i><br><br>This challenge begins October 2nd 2011 (with this post), and will end January 2nd 2012.<br><br>Once you have a team sorted out, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Extended_Challenge:_Intertextuality">post them here.</a><br><br>Start writing!<br><br>Or, rather, join/start a team and then start writing.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got a couple of items on my docket right now that are fairly close to being finished. The mission is a bit too close for me to start putting in references, but I might be able to work something into a collection of short interludes that I&#39;ve been working on.

            <p>I figure there are only a few options here. The simplest may just be to make darn sure you do this again when it isn&#39;t November, and those of us who are doing NaNo can officially participate then. In the meantime, like Aster, I&#39;m happy to work on this premise anyway.<br><br>Otherwise, it would have to be some sort of compensatory points system (maybe per words of novel written?), which may or may not sit well with people who are actually writing PPC stuff in November.

            <p>Assume that I write a story with Barid and Brightbeard, where they mention the MP3 of JulyFlame and also reference the conversation that Barid had with Nume.  Would that be two points or would it just be one, because it is technically referencing the same event?</p>

            <p>Hmmm.<br><br>If the two items are brought up together at the same time- in conjunction- they&#39;d count as one point.  <br><br>But if they&#39;re treated separately- say, the mp3 comes up at a later point, but Brightbeard and Barid talk about Barid&#39;s trolling of Nume at the beginning of the story (or the other way around) they&#39;d count for two points. <br><br>Spirit of the rules is more important than technicalities.</p>

            <p>Since I am already writing an interlude in which some Agents not of mine appear as cameos (instead of just references as in the challenge), I&#39;d like to know if this still qualifies. A big part of it is a co-write, too, and it will probably qualify as a team writing as Astral Void says she cannot post her next MST until I get around to post this interlude (and one of the already posted ones has a slight reference to it)</p>

            <p>... at least, when compared to what we usually spork, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s mission-worthy, but the cheesy (aheh, mice, cheese, geddit? Oh, nevermind) dialogue and clumsy description left so many obvious joke openings that I couldn&#39;t pass up riffing it. Plus I love any opportunity to have vermin characters be snarky.

It&#39;s understandable that you might not know these things! If you ever have questions or concerns or whatever, I&#39;d be happy to help.

            <p>I love The Fisherman and Evie - he&#39;s a Time Lord!  She&#39;s an anthropomorphic GLaDOS!  THEY FIGHT CRIME! - and this was excellent!  I loved the reality melting, and I really loved:<br><br><i>“Well here we are again… it’s always such a pleasure,” Evie sung softly.<br><br>“Remember when you tried to kill me twice,” the Fisherman continued with a pointed glance at Evie.<br><br>“Hey, I only tried to kill you once. So far.”</i><br><br><br>However, I wonder a little bit about Evie - is she supposed to retain most of GLaDOS&#39;s personality, or has she been in HQ long enough to develop her own?  Her dialogue didn&#39;t sound quite like GLADOS&#39;s - when GLaDOS speaks, it&#39;s always calm, cold, and slightly stilted, and Evie&#39;s lines sounded much more human and natural.<br><br>She&#39;s still quite the deadpan snarker, though.<br><br>Loved it!<br><br></p>

            <p>She was recruited from a fic (one that really exists, unfortunately) in which GLaDOS had become human (through random phlebotinum) and started a new life with Chell in post-Combine-invasion Earth, and so by the time she entered the PPC she had already lost some of her cold edge. That and treatment at FicPsych caused her to develop a distinctive personality and speech pattern.<br><br>I fully intend to tell the whole story at some point when I A - find the fic in question again and B - when I can fit it in somewhere.<br><br>I&#39;m pleased you liked the mission!

            <p>So, for those of you who don&#39;t know me, I apologise.  What I&#39;m about to say is not going to make any sense at all.  It&#39;s not going to make much more sense to those of you who <i>do</i> know me, but that&#39;s not the point.<br><br>I am taking a hiatus.  It&#39;s going to be at least a week, but it will be a lot longer than that.<br><br>Initially, I was not planning on saying much more than that, aside from &quot;Yeah, personal problems, not anybody&#39;s fault, just need some time to work things out by myself.&quot;<br><br>However, I feel that I owe everyone an explanation.<br><br>It should be noted that what follows is <br>a) highly personal<br>b) very serious and <br>c) quite probably disturbing.<br><br>I apologise.  However, I don&#39;t feel I can just leave without any hard feelings if I don&#39;t explain myself.<br><br>First, I need to make one thing <i>very</i> clear.  THIS IS NOBODY&#39;S FAULT.  NOBODY IS TO BLAME FOR MY LEAVING.  When I say I have personal issues, I mean it.

I mentioned some personal problems there, but I didn&#39;t elaborate.<br><br>Now, if we go back even further, we have this: <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=197072;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=1325"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=197072;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=1325">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=197072;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=1325</a></a>  My initial introduction thread.  I never posted anything outside of there until October.<br><br>That is because, almost exactly a week after that, I attempted suicide.<br><br>This was not my first attempt.  It was, however, the closest I came to success.<br><br>Admittedly, this was not the initial reason for my hiatus.  The primary reason was, at the time, something completely unrelated that I won&#39;t go into details of because it&#39;s mostly been resolved.<br><br>However, the reason why I bring the suicide attempt up is because the question of how long it takes for threads to drop off the Board arose.  I thought &quot;Huh.  I wonder if my introduction post is still there?&quot;  I found it.<br><br>I had somehow... blocked off the fact that I almost successfully killed myself.  I don&#39;t know how I did this, but I did.  Seeing that initial post that I wrote a week before it happened unblocked that.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to share the details of how it happened.  It&#39;s not exactly relevant.  I&#39;m sorry if I alienated anybody by writing this post, but I feel it needed to be done.<br><br>Because, to me, the PPC is almost like family.  It&#39;s my favourite place, both online and off, and I don&#39;t feel I could leave it like this without an explanation.<br><br>I know this post is convoluted, and I apologise.<br><br>In case anybody is worried, I will be back.<br><br>Hopefully, it will be soon.<br><br>With all that said, good-bye.<br><br>I&#39;m going to miss all of you.<br><br>-Tray-Gnome</p>

            <p>And I hope you are back fairly soon and able to tell us that things are better for you.<br><br>Having someone try to kill you is traumatic, especially when that person is yourself. I know, I&#39;ve been there. The mind likes to block out traumatic events, makes it easier to keep going.

            <p>I would&#39;ve responded sooner, but I wanted to make a proper review of it, since it&#39;s such a long piece. I&#39;m addressing it to a singular &quot;you,&quot; but please interpret as necessary according to who did what bits.<br><br>First, that fic was <i>definitely</i> mission-worthy, so good choice of target. I really like <i>House</i>, at least the earlier seasons. I also like bizarre medical mysteries, and I like to think I know a bit more about that sort of thing than the average person, but I STILL wouldn&#39;t try writing a <i>House</i> fic. (I have considered a crossover that gets House in the same room with Robin Cook&#39;s medical examiner characters, though, because it would be fun to watch House and Jack Stapleton butt heads, but I digress.) And then, canon subject material aside, to not even really include the canon characters at all? Argh. I almost wish I could have sporked it myself. Nume would&#39;ve had a field day. {= P<br><br>Second, the concrit. There are a few specific mechanical things I noticed that could use work:<br><br>1. Sentence structure. Not so much later on, but the very first sentence in particular is a bit long and hard to follow, and it uses the &quot;as&quot; convention, which is a pet peeve of mine ever since &quot;The Girl and Her Dragon.&quot; *shudders* In that particular case, I&#39;d say drop the &quot;as&quot; and just make the next bit a new sentence: &quot;[Noir] was sitting on the floor playing Solitaire,&quot; etc. <br><br>2. Dialogue tags. It isn&#39;t possible to &quot;gesture&quot; a sentence unless the character is using sign language, and I never got that impression of any of the three. {= ) Similarly, shrugging, nodding, or smiling speech is physically impossible. You can still use them, but as actions after a terminal period in the dialogue. So, for example:<br><br>WRONG: &quot;Sure, go nuts. …Not literally, of course,&quot; Noir shrugged as he . . .<br><br>RIGHT: &quot;Sure, go nuts. …Not literally, of course.&quot; Noir shrugged as he . . .<br><br>Also, it is okay to use &quot;he said.&quot; It&#39;s one of those things readers tend to be blind to, so repeating it isn&#39;t really an issue, and I got the impression you were trying to use anything but. The trouble is, words like &quot;uttered&quot; are unusual and attract attention, especially if they come up more than once (I counted five). They should generally be reserved only for times you really mean it; in the case of &quot;uttered,&quot; when a character is having to make a physical effort to speak for some reason. &quot;Uttered in surprise&quot; is good; not so much when &quot;he uttered&quot; a comment about the charge list.<br><br>3. &quot;Plopped.&quot; You keep using that word. I do not think  it means what you think it means. (I suspect you were going for &quot;popped,&quot; as in &quot;popped into existence.&quot;)<br><br>4. Just another quick correction—people can just discuss things. They don&#39;t need to discuss about them. They can talk about them, though.<br><br>Okay, so much for mechanical stuff. Now, content. I was a bit confused about some of your choices. For instance, the randomly-appearing girl. She only turned up twice, didn&#39;t really do anything, and was never explained. I think July mentioned that she worked with you on taking out a fourth agent, so did those couple of spots get missed in the clean-up, perhaps?<br><br>I&#39;m also not sure about the whole thing with the RA. For one, I feel like not having a way to get out of the fic and back to HQ should have caused a lot more concern than it did. I saw some of that from Noir toward the end, which was great, but I would have liked a lot more from all of them, maybe some scrambling to think of an alternative, or a way to at least contact HQ, or something.<br><br>The fact that they ended up having it all along kinda makes me wonder if having it &quot;missing&quot; just added unnecessarily to the length the mission. The parts with the flashbacks and disclaimers in particular felt slow to me, especially since the agents themselves commented about how pointless they were. I imagine they could have been skipped.<br><br>And that&#39;s that! Now, the good stuff, because there definitely was good stuff. Like I said, I really enjoyed the end, where everyone was split up and Noir was faced with his demons. It might have happened sooner than you wanted, but it has definitely gotten me interested in his character. The hints about what kind of world he came from were good, too. It&#39;s like a puzzle where all the pieces are hidden, and you have to find them before you can put them together. ^<em>^<br><br>I&#39;m also keen to see how Ardo handles the role of CAD, though I tend to agree it&#39;s probably healthiest for everyone to rely on the devices when possible. Still, given that how Sues describe themselves and how they really behave is often so different, I can see his empathy opening an interesting window into that discrepancy. Too bad he can&#39;t use Bleeprin, though, for his sake. I guess Suebuprofen wouldn&#39;t be any better, either, since it has the same effect.<br><br>Iris is awesome. You got the creepiness across nicely, and I don&#39;t envy Noir having to put up with it. &gt;.<br>The <i>Junior</i> reference was good imagery, too, at least for me. Not pleasant, of course, but well done.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry if I don&#39;t say much about Nathan, but he was really just along for the ride, and he did fulfill his role as guide appropriately. (I do note that Nathan &quot;said&quot; things, though, so that&#39;s good. ^</em>~ )<br><br>Oh, and the Technus bit! That was really well done. It was a nice obstacle, and a nice action sequence, and the resolution was brilliant. Chekhov&#39;s ipod, that&#39;s a new one. I liked the dialogue between Nathan and Noir afterward, too. Seriously, Noir, I know not everyone can think of witty one-liners, but ouch. I hope he never gets better, either. ^_^<br><br>Anything more is just gonna be nattering, so I think we&#39;re done here. Congrats on the first mission, Flare! {= D<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Still, if you didn&#39;t have room to get into it, it probably would have been better just to introduce her another time, especially if she&#39;s not going to be a feature in Flare&#39;s spin-off, since this was Flare&#39;s pilot episode.

Rule #1 of editing is &quot;omit needless words,&quot; after all—or, as Stephen King puts it, &quot;kill your darlings.&quot; Even the best sentence/paragraph/character/whatever that you&#39;ve ever written needs to be cut if it doesn&#39;t serve the story. The good news is you can always find a place for it later if you keep writing. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I enjoyed this mission.  The fic was so brain-numbingly bad that I had to stop in a number of places to let my mind reboot.  <br><br>I liked the knowledge of the canon that you brought to the table, as well.  Having played the Halo games, I know some things about the continuum, such as the fact that the Covenant races have names for themselves that the humans don&#39;t use.  I couldn&#39;t have told you what they were, though.  The way you injected that information into the mission made sense and didn&#39;t interrupt the flow, so good work there.<br><br>And now the concrit.  This felt closer to an MST than a mission, for me.  I never had much of an idea of where the agents were or what they were doing, aside from writing down charges.  I think that this could be fixed by doing more of the description yourself.  Describe what the effect on the world is.  Describe where the characters are standing and how they are avoiding notice.  As it stands, there was a bit of fic, followed by a snarky comment, followed by fic, followed by a snarky comment, rinse and repeat.  <br><br>Not to say that there weren&#39;t some very good descriptions on occasion.  You did have a few moments where you explored the effect of the badfic.  A good example was with the setting in the scene with the Prophets, which was right after the charge for &quot;passing off the description of the locale to canon.&quot;<br><br>All in all, I think it was well done and enjoyable.  The grammar in the fic was terrible, and the Sue was ridiculous.  I look forward to seeing what your agents get up to in the future.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>This was an awesome mission!  The badfic was hilariously bad and stupid, and it made for a great contrast with the end of the mission, when everything turned horribly dangerous for the agents.  Excellent character development at the end, as well.  I hope we still see Mordecai around in Postal a bit!</p>

I have to admit, the Jacob!Stu/Kestrel fight did actually scare me a little, because the lack of description and off-hand reference to her in Medical made me think she was dead or irreparably maimed or something.

            <p>I think it&#39;s nice to get a Sue recruited to the PPC every once in a while, because this Sue wasn&#39;t really that terrible.<br><br>Though, the one thing I found annoying for her was something I found to be <i>really</i> annoying. I&#39;m personally not a fan of musical-prodigy!Sues, what with being a musician myself. It wouldn&#39;t be so bad, except that she&#39;s an overachiver!Sue to a really egregious extent. I&#39;m not sure her author realizes just how difficult it is to find time to practice so many instruments, and how it&#39;s pretty much impossible to master them all if you&#39;re playing that many. Yeah, we have some precedents who <i>tried</i> to do it (*coughPaulHindemithcough*), but he never really mastered any of the extra instruments.<br><br>At least she&#39;s college age, though, so that whole &#39;being good enough to get into Harvard&#39; thing is at least somewhat plausible for at least one of her instruments. I would&#39;ve had a conniption if she was 12 years old, for the same reason that I absolutely cannot stand <i>August Rush</i>.<br><br>Overall, fun mission!</p>

            <p>I think that everyone here on PPC (AND when logged in I am one of your fellow assassins, thanks, not a burnt-up author) should seriously stop and think about what you are doing. <br><br>      Once upon a time, fan fiction was born. A cool way of achieving your best writing skills by practicing getting into a character&#39;s head. That&#39;s great so far!<br><br>     But then, some underaged kid decided to get better and join in on all the fun too. Unfortunately, they were not spellchecking, or even re-reading the chapters they posted! A few people helped him/her by saying things like, &quot;I think that Alicia Von Monroe 111 should be rethought, she&#39;s a little... overdone.&quot; <br><br>  This was all fine. But more people began to slack off with their writing. Instead of helping, the writers/readers on fan-fiction turned against the poor fangirls, even though some of them themselves were not at all learned and merely readers. <br><br>    They. FLamed. A. CHild. That&#39;s sick. <br>     Thinking that it was &#39;cool&#39;, they thought up a name for the rather dumb characters they made fun of- Mary-Sues. And I&#39;m ok with that. <br><br><br><br>     But, flames. Really? Beyond &#39;this sucks&#39;, flames are actually cyber-bullying, things like, &#39;wooow, loser, get a life&#39;, or even, &#39;go f*ck/kill yourself.&#39;. These &#39;flamers&#39; could get ARRESTED if someone tried. <br><br>   Lucky you aren&#39;t one, huh? Think about that. And I&#39;m not saying PPC is bad, I&#39;m  just suggesting that perhaps some of us are a bit too enthusiastic in criticizing little kids. It&#39;s a bit pathetic, don&#39;t you think? Flame me, delete this post, but you know its true. Some of us don&#39;t like ourselves enough, so they make fun of a child&#39;s attempt at getting better at something. Trying to LEARN. <br><br>        Just Saying. Oh, and if you DO flame this, you&#39;re probably just as bad as the rest of them. <br><br><br>    -Anonymous, &#39;cause  I don&#39;t want my Assassin license evoked :|<br><br></p>

            <p>We&#39;ve heard pretty much all of these protest before, you know. That&#39;s why we wrote <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:For_Other_People">an entire article</a> explaining exactly what we do and what we <i>don&#39;t</i> do. Most of your accusations fall into the latter category. <br><br>I agree that flaming is horrible - that&#39;s pretty much its definition, in my mind - but any personal attack on an adult is just as shameful. Bringing up a &quot;woe! the children, think of the <i>children</i>!&quot; argument isn&#39;t going to change that. Flaming of anyone is bad, and that&#39;s why we have a rule (an <i>enfored</i> rule, as far as that is possible) against it.<br><br>Also, if a child decides they&#39;re grown-up enough to post their work on the internet, not in a children-only zone, then they will be treated like everyone else. To demand otherwise would be like putting a two-year-old&#39;s finger painting in the Louvre and then shout at anyone who dares suggest it might need work. We, as readers and reviewers, are not obliged to check an author&#39;s (claimed) age before we&#39;re allowed to think, &quot;That wasn&#39;t very good.&quot; I refer you back to the article linked above.</p>

            <p>Other people have already responded to your post and done it so eloquently that I don&#39;t have anything to add, except this:<br><br>I looked up the authors of the fics I already have sporked and the one I&#39;m currently working on. Their ages are 20, not stated, and 18. Two out of the three are definitely not children. They are grown women.<br>The fact that many badfic writers write like 12-yearolds do not mean that they actually are under-age. In fact, I&#39;ll bet you dollars to donuts, that the PPC could make a collective promise to not take on fics by writers known to be under age and it would do nothing for the frequency or content of our missions.<br><br>You don&#39;t like what we do, or consider it flaming? Fine, you are free to have your opinion and to voice it here, as long as you are civil about it, which you are.<br>But trying to paint us as cyberbullies who target children? You are only making yourself sound like one of those people who shout &#39;Think of the children!&#39; because they have no facts or rational arguments to back up their opinion.<br>If you want to have a debate about whether or not what we do is flaming or bashing, that is acceptable, even encouraged, but for your own sake, leave the &#39;little kids&#39; out of this.</p>

            <p>Do I think it impossible for a member of the PPC to cross the line? No, we&#39;re human, and humans are imperfect. We all have bad days and sometimes people post without thinking.<br><br>BUT, and this is the important part, it is not considered acceptable behavior. Poking fun at badly written stories? That&#39;s fine, in fact I&#39;ve poked fun at stuff I&#39;ve written that was bad. And believe me, I&#39;ve written some bad stuff. I just haven&#39;t shared any of it.<br><br>I agree with you that bullying is wrong, I&#39;ve been a victim of it myself. I&#39;ve attended schools with bullying epidemics. Some of my mental health issues are related to that bullying. I know the difference between criticism and bullying.

            <p>I was bullyed too. Bad thing. And sure the PPC is not behaving that way.<br><br>About the main concern, the author-bashing, I too don&#39;t like it. The maximum I do is to &quot;poke&quot; him a bit using some comments &quot;escaped&quot; from my Agent&#39;s mouths.<br><br>For example, in my last mission, one of my Agents, copying nearly word-by-word a sentence used by a character of that continuum, wonders if the author is &quot;nuts&quot; after discovering that nearly all the fighter jets involved in a training exercise would get inevitably destroyed due to how the exercize itself was going to be done. It may sound harsh, but when you think that a F-22 is worth 150 million dollars and the author destroyed several of these without a valid reason... However, that&#39;s it, after that line they go on with the mission.<br><br>(If you consider this being author-bashing, however, I&#39;ll go and change it. While I think how the Agent reacted had sense in the context, I may have still done an error)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not going to really spend a whole lot of time talking about the actual post from our anonymous friend.  I think most of you have covered that fairly well.  I do want to bring to your attention something that I have noticed in recent times.<br><br>Self-censoring, or rather, the lack thereof.<br><br>I think it is great that everyone is standing up and saying that we don&#39;t flame and we don&#39;t bash authors.  This should be the case.  However, it isn&#39;t entirely true, is it?<br><br>I am, by nature, a lurker.  I sit in the corner and watch what is going on.  What I have seen disturbs me sometimes.  I&#39;ve voiced these concerns to the people involved, in the form of a warning as part of my position as DA in the chat or here on the Board.  I think it is time I bring these issues to the forefront.<br><br>First: This is the one we are working on. I have seen a number of occasions of author bashing in the chat.  We are working on this one, so I am not as worried about it.  When it comes up, I remind everyone that it is Not Cool.  They apologize and stop.  This is what we want to happen.  What we don&#39;t want is for it to start back up the next time a badfic is mentioned.<br><br>Some of you will tell me that it is in the heat of the moment and you can&#39;t control it.  I will tell you this only once; I Don&#39;t Care.  If you can&#39;t control what you are saying then keep your mouth shut until you can.  This goes for swearing, as well, though I will not get into that here.<br><br>Second:  I can think of at least one mission recently that had author bashing in it.  This one is the really worrying one.  This is <b>completely unacceptable.</b>  There is no reason that author bashing should make it through the editing process.<br><br>Betas, take note, if author bashing makes it into a finished mission, you are just as responsible as the person that wrote it.  It is the job of a beta to weed that sort of thing out.  That said, I don&#39;t blame the betas for this example.  The bashing was in an author&#39;s note, and I know that those usually get added in right before posting.<br><br>Confession time:  I have looked back at that mission and the thread it was posted in.  I am ashamed to say that I didn&#39;t say anything at the time.  In fact, no one said anything about it.  One person said something about the levels of animosity that the agents had, but nothing about the bashing in the note.<br><br>So, as much as I would like to be with you guys in saying that we don&#39;t do these things; we do.  In most cases, we are working to keep it from happening, which is good.  In at least one case, it happened without comment, which I think outweighs the good of working on it.<br><br>You will notice that I didn&#39;t use any names.  I would appreciate it if anyone that comments would do the same.  I will be talking to the author of that mission to get the bashing removed, as soon as possible.</p>

            <p>Said it better than I could myself.<br><br>I, too, know that in the past we&#39;ve not been 100% on &quot;spork the fic, not the author&quot;, so we can&#39;t claim that we&#39;ve never done it as a community.<br><br>What is important to remember is that we decided as a community (IIRC sometime around that whole Boosette incident, but I could be wrong) to stop any such actions, and make sure they don&#39;t recur.<br><br>As Neshomeh and others have said, the fact that most of anonymous&#39; comments are incorrect does not mean we should not act on any real issues that come to our attention (whether from an anonymous poster or not).<br><br>Elcalion</p>

            <p>OK, I&#39;m possibly over-analysing the statement too much, but allow me to play devil&#39;s advocate to our anomynous friend here and provide a few counter-points.<br><br>To the best of my knowledge, I have seen no PPCer&#39;s work here directly flame the author for their work. And has already been pointed out, both within the PPC Constitution and the Wiki, there are deliberate boundaries established. The author is never, NEVER to be &quot;flamed&quot;, as you have postulated - the PPC is concerned with the story, not the author.<br><br>Have you seen some of the reviews on FF.net for some of the &quot;questionable&quot; works? You&#39;re more likely to find &quot;Throw yourself off a cliff&quot; remarks within the reviews section then in a PPC mission.<br><br>Yes, some Agents tend to focus primarily on the faults of the work in question, but I have seen assignments where Agents complimented the author IN-TEXT where the author does well in a particular aspect and/or do their best. For example, in the fic I am sporking, the author seems to make a genuine effort of his/her work and it truely shows. OK, so there are some canon deraiment and some questionable actions depicted, but the author is clearly trying to do the best possible.<br><br>Third, bear in mind most fanfiction sites&#39; TOS. The Pit of Voles and some of it&#39;s more adult cousins clearly dictate that all writers have to be of an appropriate age and, more often then not, have a fair understanding and implementation of the language they write in. I understand if it is someone trying to learn a different language, but when someone who is of an old eough age, writing in their native language and throwing most of what they know out the window, well, wouldn&#39;t it be surprising if they are critisised for that blunder? And don&#39;t get me started on writing in textspeak when not quoting an SMS.<br><br>Finally, as far as I know, we do not discriminate against younger writers. It&#39;s an unfortunate fact, however, that they make up part of our sporkable demograph, and even then, we are trying to take their learning experiances in mind when we spork.<br><br>Many of the issues the PPC tackle are not new - I direct you to this article - written by Mark Twain, who calls into question some of the writing issues of a professional writer&#39;s work: <br><br><a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/railton/projects/rissetto/offense.html"><a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/railton/projects/rissetto/offense.html">http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/railton/projects/rissetto/offense.html</a></a><br><br>So, if it is bad that we are parodying bad writing behind an author&#39;s back, how bad do you think these authors might react if confronted directly? Or, worse, if they go into the professional writing scene<br><br>In conclusion, are we delibratly trying to be an elitist group of writers who flame bad writers? NO.<br><br>Do we believe writers have the capability to improve? YES.</p>

            <p>Not to get off topic, but I&#39;m clearly in difficult territory here, so I&#39;ll try to explain my stance on the fic. My points include:<br><br>- SPaG is fine, though some of the punctuation is jarring.<br><br>- The naratives of both chapters seem to initially deal with Imperial responses to two unrelated invasions, but are quickly sidetracked and not heard about again once the &quot;main action&quot; kicks in. We don&#39;t even know what planets are being invaded, nor are the two chapters connected. <br><br>- Warping of social norms (or lack thereof) are the most noticable problem here. The main characters are OOC and there are multiple questionable acions on the part of the Imperial chars (eg: Commissar raping a Chaos witch AFTER banishing a daemon from the same person (a big no-no as far as Imperial doctrine is concerned))<br><br>Truth be told, I am undecided as to whether to proceed or leave it well alone. You can find the link within my Permission request (WARNING: LINK IS NSFW) and see what you think. I&#39;ll not proceed for now and consider alternatives.</p>

            <p>I believe you&#39;re using the phrase <i>devil&#39;s advocate</i> incorrectly. The phrase refers to someone who takes a position in an argument that they do not necessarily agree with.

However, you are actually just responding to the charges he/she laid against the PPC in a very straight-forward manner. In this case, the term is unnecessary.<br><br>Sorry for the nitpicking, but misuse of phrases like that kinda bugs me.

            <p>I&#39;m fairly certain that the purpose of the PPC is to write amusing stories poking fun at badly written fanfiction while simultaneously giving some pointers here and there to help the authors improve. There&#39;s no &#39;flaming&#39; going on that I can see.<br><br>Also keep in mind that the Agents in the missions are fictional characters, and their authors are mature enough to avoid using them as mouthpieces to bash the badfic writers. Many Agents are at least a little insane, several homicidally so, and so if one says the author of a badfic should be *nasty and probably painful thing here*, that does not necessarily mean the person who writes them feels that way.<br><br>If you feel a PPCer has personally attacked you or a friend of yours, then I would suggest explaining why you feel offended in as clear and polite a manner as possible.

She was mortified, Acacia was rather annoyed at her. It&#39;s not a thing we should do even with our Agents, and I don&#39;t believe I have ever written a flame, in character or out of it (and given I had to double-kill one &#39;Sue to get her to stay dead, I&#39;ve certainly had motivation if I was prone to).

            <p>I am sorry, I know I am either feeding a troll or offending a boarder, but this post made me mad enough that I took a walk, ate dinner, and screamed at a tree before I could muster a coherent reply.<br><br>So basically your post is anti-criticism. We shouldn&#39;t criticize bad fanfiction because a child could have written it and then we are somehow criticizing a child who so innocent and simply trying to learn.<br><br>I am sorry. I have enormous problems with this like you wouldn&#39;t believe. And no, I don&#39;t care if you use &#39;you know it to be true.&#39; Because you know what? I think you are very wrong.<br><br>&quot;We shouldn&#39;t criticize children!&quot;<br><br>This is incredibly offensive to children. It&#39;s so horribly condescending I have to go stick my head out a window before I can type more. ... OK, I&#39;m done.<br><br>So by this logic, we should be less critical of <i>Eragon</i> because Paloni wrote it when he was 15 or so. Should we should put it in the same category as say... The Original Series, which was also written by what we would consider &#39;young&#39; writers?<br><br>No. Just no. You are insulting good, young writers out there by deciding to bring THEM down to the same level as a terrible fanfiction. Yes, young people should be treated equally and with respect, but there&#39;s that term: EQUALLY. By placing them in another category that is automatically less capable than some default category you brand ALL OF THEM, not just the bad ones, as inferior.<br><br>Don&#39;t believe me? What your post says boils down to is  &quot;It&#39;s OK if they&#39;re bad at writing because they&#39;re just children.&quot;<br><br><i>Just children</i><br><br>Congratulations, you have just condescended to ALL young people. Yes, flaming is sick and bad. But that&#39;s not our mission.<br><br>And those little children &#39;just trying to LEARN!&#39;... A lot of them aren&#39;t. One of our qualifications for going after bad fanfic in the first place is that the writer simply doesn&#39;t try, or has utter disregard for aspects of the canon they&#39;re trying to write. It is not in the spirit of the PPC to go after stories that care about trying to be good stories. It is in the spirit of the PPC to go after stories that clearly disregard effort for cheap self-satisfaction: written by a young OR and older author. Older authors can be horrible, too! A friend of mine was horrified to discover the longtime badfic she&#39;s been following was in fact written by somebody who has graduated college... yet the fic displays a total lack of comprehension about going to school at all, public OR private OR homeschool!<br><br>Disclaimer after disclaimer proclaims &#39;this was written on sugar high its not supposed to be good SO DONT FLAME ME I AM NOT EVEN TRYING&#39; Does THAT sound like people trying to learn how to write to you? The ones that ARE trying to learn do things like take constructive criticism (which we give freely if asked!), truly TRY to make interesting characters, and put real EFFORT into their work... or at least put the effort to use spellcheck into it! <br><br>Being uncritical of things is never the answer. The PPC is basically literary criticism of fanfiction.  Raising no-effort products brings those who really do try down to their level, and it is just downright INSULTING... not just to really good young writers, but to my past self, who was not so good.<br><br>Because I wouldn&#39;t have gotten here if somebody didn&#39;t call my work bad or stupid once or twice. I wouldn&#39;t be in college learning to be a journalist, and I wouldn&#39;t have tried so hard to improve myself.<br><br>Flames are bad, yes. But nothing will stop me from comparing the bad to the good, figuring out why, and then doing something about it.<br><br>Critics do good.<br><br>Peace, Aster out.<br><br>(PS:<br>If we shadows have offended,<br>Think but this, and all is mended,<br>That you have but slumber&#39;d here<br>While these visions did appear.<br>And this weak and idle theme,<br>No more yielding but a dream,<br>Gentles, do not reprehend:<br>if you pardon, we will mend:<br>And, as I am an honest Puck,<br>If we have unearned luck<br>Now to &#39;scape the serpent&#39;s tongue,<br>We will make amends ere long;<br>Else the Puck a liar call;<br>So, good night unto you all.<br>Give me your hands, if we be friends,<br>And Robin shall restore amends)</p>

            <p>So quite a few months ago, I received permission to write for the PPC. I promptly dropped off the face of the earth to do real life stuff. Unfortunately, I look back on my agents and realize that, while there are some bits I do like, I have changed a lot with both of them in my head without even realizing it. <br><br>Would I have to re-apply with their revised apps, or am I good to go?<br><br>(Also hello again, gosh I&#39;ve missed the board, haha...)</p>

            <p>That rather depends on why it is a bad idea to have a dragon around with the mini.<br>For example, my agents have a bunch of mini-Darkspawn, several of which can breath fire. One of my agents is made out of plant material and has a kitten made out of tulips as a pet, so they have to be treated with flame repellent twice a week. That&#39;s how I work around it.<br><br>But again, it depends on what the problem is.</p>

            <p>I with Neshomeh on this one. &#39;Pets&#39; do not necessarily include minis, since most minis can fend for themselves.<br>However, if you are reluctant to just put them together and see if they get along or try to fight it out, you could give them a long period of getting used to each other. In the beginning you could try having them in separate rooms with the door slightly ajar, things like that. You can look up how to get two cats used to each other, for ideas.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been wondering this for a bit. Continuum vs. universe vs. canon.<br><br>Say we have Continuum A and Continuum B. Continuum A does not reference Continuum B. Continuum B makes a few references in-canon to Continuum A, of the kind that one would make to something real. Taken on their own by someone who only knows Continuum B, the references are pretty much throwaway, but for someone who knows both A and B, they may connect the continua. B also has extra-canon material and/or Word of God that connects the two in some way.<br><br>So, are A and B in the same universe? The same continuum? What is canon and what is not?<br><br>In other words, if I write about Portal in any capacity, do I have to treat it as connected to Half Life in any way?<br><br>My brain says &quot;So Aperture has a rival company named Black Mesa that supposedly stole their technology. Nothing else explicit is stated in-canon. Nice coincidence with Half Life, but no absolute connection.&quot;<br><br>I am doubting my brain in the technicality of this.</p>

            <p>Cracked made a list with universes that overlap, so while it isn&#39;t excactly common, it is something that comes up once in a while. <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19323_6-movie-tv-universes-that-overlap-in-mind-blowing-ways.html"><a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19323_6-movie-tv-universes-that-overlap-in-mind-blowing-ways.html">http://www.cracked.com/article_19323_6-movie-tv-universes-that-overlap-in-mind-blowing-ways.html</a></a><br><br>I&#39;ve also been wondering about the opposite, which seems to be more common. For example in a episode of Supernatural, Dean calls a couple of FBI-agents &#39;Mulder and Scully&#39; indicating that X-files is a television-show in the Supernatural-universe. Does that mean that a crossover between the two, would be considered inherently<br>more implausible than crossovers with other continua? And what does it mean when William B. Davis (the actor playing the Cigarette-Smoking Man from X-files) has a small role in Supernatural, without Dean commenting on his apparance?</p>

            <p>Guvnor and I had an instance of this sort of thing in the mission we just published. While we didn&#39;t get into it in the mission itself, we did note that the <i>Harry Potter</i> books do exist in the <i>Alex Rider</i> universe, which makes the crossover a bit weirder than it otherwise would be. However, it&#39;s not any more implausible than the &quot;girl falls into Middle-earth&quot; thing. In both cases, you&#39;d just expect that the author would discuss the weirdness of discovering that a supposedly fictional world actually exists, and that the protagonists wouldn&#39;t simply accept it without question.<br><br>So, I guess my answer is no, it&#39;s not necessarily more implausible than other types of crossovers. It just has to be justified or explained appropriately, like any other premise does.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Because I knew I was forgetting to ask something!<br><br>Right, so, in this book series I read- a fairly obscure one- there are two characters that are mentioned; Twins, Delwin and Sand, if that&#39;s relevant. Anyway, these twins are mentioned as probably being dead because they ran off a while before the books even started to do their own thing.<br><br>However, faking death is kind of a theme in their family; Even the main character was thought to be dead and it was a huge surprise to everyone when he showed up.<br><br>They&#39;re mentioned all of two or three times throughout the whole ten-book series and in the prequels and short stories subsequent to it. We don&#39;t get descriptions, characterization, personalities...Nothing but their names and parentage. They never show up and none of the other characters care because they&#39;re not legitimate children of the king, and therefore not a threat to getting the throne.<br><br>Basically, what I&#39;m asking is if it would be allowed to use the two of them as agents, with proper credit to the author, of course.<br><br>In all probability, I&#39;m not going to be allowed because copyrighted characters, but hey, might as well ask, right?</p>

            <p>Welcome! You&#39;ve caught us in a bit of an adjustment period, so please allow me to help you settle in with some useful information. First, if you haven&#39;t already done so, please go read <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/Constitution.htm">our Constitution</a>. This is the thing we all agree to in order to keep it fun here, in the IRC, etc.<br><br>Second, <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">the Original PPC Series</a> by Jay and Acacia. Pretty much what it says on the tin—this is our canon, if you will, so it&#39;s a good idea to read it in order to get an idea of what we&#39;re all doing here.<br><br>Third, we have <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">a wiki</a>! For tons more information, much of which is specifically aimed at newcomers, I heartily recommend reading the front page and going from there.<br><br>... If you haven&#39;t noticed, this is a reading-intensive hobby. I hope you&#39;re into that. *g*<br><br>Also, please ask any questions you may have—preferably in this thread while it&#39;s still near the top, since each new thread pushes an older one off the front page.<br><br>Anyway, welcome to the Board! Have a complimentary bumper sticker. *sticks on a sticker reading &quot;Got SPaG?&quot;*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Is it OK to take down a mission or MST and rewrite it if the writer feels they did something wrong? See, in my first MST, I bashed the author quite a bit, but now I&#39;m rather ashamed and I was hoping I could rewrite it so I don&#39;t cringe every time I read it. I looked on the Wiki, but I either didn&#39;t find the answer or I didn&#39;t look hard enough, so I thought I&#39;d ask here.</p>

            <p>I want to run through a couple of concerns that I have with your request.<br><br>1) There are some inconsistencies with your potential agents.  I see a number of traits that seem to have been tacked on without any reasoning.  Lophy&#39;s archaic dialect is a good example of this.  She was born to American-born parents who, as proof of still being American in their language and thinking, named her Rachel instead of something more common to the region that they live in now.  If they speak English, why does she have an archaic dialect?<br><br>Another example would be with your third potential agent.  I know that she isn&#39;t as fully formed as the others, but there are some problems in her basic description.  She has black hair, red eyes, and totally white skin.  That I can live with.  But why does everyone think she is a Twilight Vampire?  Does she sparkle in the sun?  I don&#39;t see much in her description that would make me think Twipire.<br><br>Giving a character traits to help them stand apart from every other agent out there is a good thing.  However, there has to be a reason for it.<br><br>2) I hate to say this, honestly, but I believe the OC in both of your writing samples is a Mary Sue.  She appears for no discernible reason, in the first one, bringing with her all the knowledge needed to solve this riddle.  In the second one, she is the narrator and claims to have been left out of the common stories, while also claiming to have been there the whole time and even taking partial credit for the realizations that the Pevensie&#39;s made in their journeys.<br><br>For these reasons I am going to have to say Permission Denied, for now.  Your writing skills are excellent, I didn&#39;t notice any problems there.  So, work on your agents and maybe write them a short introduction piece for when you re-apply.<br><br>-Phobos, available for questions if needed.</p>

            <p>1) Lophy&#39;s speech pattern was just about the very first thing I came up for the character. It manifests something like &quot;I believe it is now time for us to depart&quot; instead of &quot;I think it&#39;s time to go.&quot; Literally everything else came later. I don&#39;t think I can ditch that trait, so I shall work on a better history for her.<br><br>Regarding Kat: it was before the movies came out, so the sparkling was a bit harder to picture than it is now. But anyone who&#39;d read the books could easily process that Twilight vampires had white skin and either red or gold eyes. So they went, &quot;Hey, you have white skin and red eyes like a Twilight vampire!&quot;<br><br>2) At the risk of sounding overly defensive, I submit that the &quot;aided realizations&quot; reference in the one sample refers almost exclusively to the other sample. Also that she doesn&#39;t so much take credit as give a small nudge. In the case of Lucy, the nudge is going to be something like &quot;Every bridge has to have *some* kind of support, or it&#39;ll just break. That&#39;s why your picture looks slightly wrong.&quot; (I blame my physics bridge-building project years ago entirely for the plot bunny.)<br><br>There&#39;s a whole universe behind Ailena that I&#39;m continually trying to improve, but most of it&#39;s still in my head and hasn&#39;t been typed out. I try to have reasons for everything. For example, there&#39;s a specific reason she was left out of the well-known version of the books, and it&#39;s not the normal &quot;look I&#39;m writing a fic that shows the &#39;real story&#39; of Narnia&quot; that I see so often on the Pit. She&#39;s also more of an observer than anything else in the long run. I have a tendency to forget that the readers don&#39;t know everything that&#39;s in my head when I write.<br><br>That said, I do my best to play down her basic Sueness in my writing. I&#39;m obviously not succeeding well enough. I shall work on it.</p>

            <p>Hence the &quot;sometime in 2012.&quot; I have details, but no backstory as of yet.<br><br>Kathryn Saunders has black hair, red eyes, and white (not Caucasian) skin. She&#39;s 19 when she turns up. She doesn&#39;t talk much, especially about the accident that changed her eye and skin coloring. All that&#39;s been gleaned from her is that it&#39;s the result of a chemistry accident in high school that involved bleach and radium. She refuses to say any more than that. She is fiercely protective of the characters of Ramandu and Aslan from Narnia, but she doesn&#39;t exactly *lust* after them.<br><br>She harbors an enormous grudge toward Stephenie Meyer due to the tendency of so many people to compare her to a sparklepire. She agreed to join the PPC as much to not be taunted as to get rid of badfic. She takes her grudge out on TwiSues with a flamethrower and a demonic grin. Kat is a very closed-mouth and introverted person, not saying much and changing little in expression. She rarely says anything about her life before the PPC.<br><br>I was planning for her to pretty much randomly appear one day in Lophy and Anta&#39;s RC. Cue the &quot;who are you&quot; and &quot;how did you get here&quot; and whatnot. I still have to work out exactly *why* she appears. She might end up partnered with them, or she might not. She would work mostly in Twilight, once I get up to speed on it. That&#39;s another reason she wouldn&#39;t be showing up for a while.</p>
