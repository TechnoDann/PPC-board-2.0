            <p>To those Agents who participated in the defence of IAHF during the <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6746784/71/The_International_Academy_of_Hetalia_Fanfiction">last</a> <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6746784/72/The_International_Academy_of_Hetalia_Fanfiction">three</a> <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6746784/73/The_International_Academy_of_Hetalia_Fanfiction">chapters</a> or so, the Academy has appointed them to the newly-created Order of the Mochi, which comes with a shiny badge and the chance to tack something cool to the end of their names. All of the Agents have been knighted to Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Mochi, and can therefore add the postnominal KCMG to their names. <br>(Yes, it is almost a direct ripoff of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. At least now your Agents can strut around and say that &#39;KCMG&#39; stands for &#39;Kindly Call Me God&#39;.)</p>

Fortunately for him, the plothole lead to the RC of the man who would soon become his partner Agent. Ecks is still rather new to the PPC, and has to adjust to not only charging people before killing them, but also the massive amounts of squick that a PPC agent encounters.

Zee spent most of his early career as part of the DBS, and as a result he has grown highly resistant to squick, which only serves to irritate Ecks even further when they are dealing with squick. Where Ecks is mildly hyper, and definitely the comic relief of the pair, Zee is more business-like and usually acts as the straight man.<br><br>They will be occupying RC #231, or @#! as it says on the door, due to a typo that has yet to be corrected.</p>

            <p>I like the writing sample quite a bit, and I&#39;d be interested to read about the team&#39;s exploits. Let me know when you update. {= )<br><br>One word of advice, though: use double–line breaks between paragraphs. Without indents, it can be hard to track where one ends and another begins without them. I also stumbled a bit over the description of &quot;Frost&quot; as an unlikely name, because plenty of people have Frost as a surname, but then I realized you meant it as his only name.<br><br>Anywho, welcome to PPC writing.

            <p>Hello, PPC board. This is my first time here, propably also my last because I don&#39;t like to write fanfiction. I do, however, like to read fanfiction, therefore I have decided to share a very special bad fanfiction with you:<br><br>The fanfiction in question is called &quot;Edward Cullen vs Russian Mafia&quot;. It starts of with Bella Swans death by the hands of a ninja. For some reason, Edward Cullen then decides to take revenge on the Russian mafia. And then... stuff happens. Edward Cullen kills the same person twice, he and Jacob get turned into cyborgs, Bella ends up as a brain in a jar, and Edward fights against Dolph Lundgren.<br><br>Aside from the terrible grammar and spelling, the story is also full of character defilement. The author can&#39;t decide whether Edward should be badass or not, or whether Bella is cruel or not. Seriously, the characters constantly switch between different personalities! The author can&#39;t even recall which characters he has killed off so far.<br><br>Here&#39;s the link for the fanfiction. Be warned, it&#39;s not safe for work.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6448545/1/Edward_Cullen_vs_Russian_Mafia"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6448545/1/Edward_Cullen_vs_Russian_Mafia">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6448545/1/Edward_Cullen_vs_Russian_Mafia</a></a></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been reading loads of missions lately and started wondering: Is there a particular correct spelling for the flashy memory thing? Either an i or a y in the first blank, either an s or a z in the second blank. I&#39;ve seen every combination thereof, though they tend to focus around yz and is.<br><br>Is there a &quot;right&quot; spelling? Does it depend on which country you live in? Thoughts?</p>

            <p>Just so you know, your writing sample went off-line for some reason last night.

            <p>Disclaimer: Not a PG but here&#39;s my two cents anyway.<br><br>You should definitely have your stuff Beta-read. I&#39;m finding several spelling mistakes/word substitutions that should have been caught with a run of proofreading. <br><br>Even with how little characterization you show in the writing sample, it&#39;s still odd. A strange woman shows up in a boy&#39;s bedroom (a boy that isn&#39;t described at all, and introduced with quite the disconcerting transition) and he not only accepts everything she says at face value but he feels comfortable enough not only to let her stay with a half-explanation, but to take his eyes off of her to read his script? And he seriously doesn&#39;t have a problem with a completely stranger sleeping in the same room as his little sister?<br><br>It might make more sense if we are given some indication that he is being impulsive and thoughtless, but the narrative does not imply this. Or even if it was a normal circumstance that people came and slept down here, but that&#39;s not indicated either. </p>

            <p>The fic was rather appalling, but it was nice to see it get taken down. Kudos!<br><br>One note--your author&#39;s note comes off as a bit hostile to the original badfic author. Mostly (this may have changed since my days, granted) PPCers try to avoid mentioning/criticizing the author personally in the fic; the focus is, after all, the bad writing itself. I didn&#39;t think it was particularly worrisome, but I wanted to put that out there for future reference. :)</p>

            <p>You&#39;ve definitely got some good banter going, and it was nice to see some real tough inter-agent stress. My one gripe concerns the prevalence of one-sentence paragraphs that are not dialogue. One-sentence paragraphs should be used sparingly, and only with intense &#39;dun dun DUN&#39; moments. Overusing them makes the piece feel a bit choppy.<br><br>Overall, I enjoyed this mission.

            <p>That was a fun mission--different kind of badfic than you usually see anywhere, and that makes for a very unique mission.  I did want to mention, though, that Elena reasoning that since RL Earth is close to getting a cure for cancer, Star Wars-verse must already have it doesn&#39;t quite work.  However, recall that Star Wars takes place &quot;A long time ago...&quot; so nothing happening on modern Earth can be applied to Star Wars, really.</p>

            <p>I was looking at the list of RC numbers and noticed that the Antigravity Apple&#39;s office is the only room on the list with a negative number, probably because it defies the normal direction of things.  My agents will be the first to have an established RC in the Department of Improbable AUs, and it occurred to me that maybe all rooms in DIAU have negative numbers because of the Antigravity Apple&#39;s influence.  I was wondering if anyone has any objection to me saying this.  It doesn&#39;t mean that other departments in HQ can&#39;t have negative numbers, just that all DIAU rooms do.<br><br>Of course, this may never matter, because I don&#39;t know if there will ever be another DIAU agent. *sigh*</p>

            <p>I finally got to read it.  And finish it, since that was the longest mission I&#39;ve ever read.  I mean, that&#39;s almost novella-length!  That fic was AWFUL.

The theory I&#39;d heard was that he created the dead body so he could go on a long vacation away from PPC agents.  Then, he&#39;d know why we think he&#39;s dead.  Or maybe he told someone to hide where he&#39;s going, and that person did it by claiming they&#39;d seen his body.  I don&#39;t know the details of his supposed death, but we need some good explanation of why someone said he was dead and why he doesn&#39;t know that someone said he was dead.

            <p>You should&#39;ve met Ilraen <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/ficpsych/casefile01.html">before he had a personality at all</a>.<br><br>For Tom Bombadil, I hadn&#39;t heard that particular theory, but I&#39;d ask which Vala he&#39;s supposed to be, if that&#39;s the case. I&#39;m not sure he fits any one of them. The theory I&#39;d heard draws on his Elvish name (Iarwain Ben-adar, oldest and fatherless) to support the idea that he might be Eru incarnate, among other evidence (such as the Ring not affecting him). As for evidence for the Ring&#39;s ability to corrupt Valar, we do know that they can be corrupt (Melkor), and it certainly can corrupt Maiar, or Gandalf wouldn&#39;t have been concerned about handling it. It seems logical that anything less perfect than Eru would be at least a little susceptible.<br><br>As for Makes-Things&#39; death, I&#39;m not the one you need to ask (see <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Macrovirus_Epidemic">this article</a> for information and links), and I don&#39;t plan on offering any &quot;official&quot; explanation for his return. I&#39;d rather see what kinds of theories the agents come up with, because I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be way more entertaining that way. So, what do <i>you</i> think happened? {= D<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I did read that, yes.  So I know he&#39;s improving.  And him going temporarily nuts was definitely interesting.<br><br>There&#39;s a long, good article on that... somewhere.  I&#39;m not sure I could find him again.  Anyway, we don&#39;t know for sure what the Valar thought of the Ring because they didn&#39;t want to get involved.  As far as I remember, they thought that since the Ring was created by Middle-Earth, Middle-Earth had to deal with it, not them.  This also indicates that they aren&#39;t very interested in the Ring as it applies to themselves - because it won&#39;t affect them.  Plus, since it was created from Sauron&#39;s power and he&#39;s a Maiar, it shouldn&#39;t be powerful enough to overcome a Vala&#39;s power.  A Maia&#39;s, yes, though I thought a lot of Gandalf&#39;s hesitancy was that the Istar were forbidden to gain power in Middle-Earth  Of course Melkor was corrupt, but he CREATED corruption.<br><br>I&#39;m going with: he said, &quot;This is too much.  I&#39;m getting out of here.  Someone cover for me,&quot; and someone made up the idea of him having died.</p>

            <p>This mission was purely awesome.  It seemed like every little thing that could possibly be a problem for the agents was, and it serves as a great example of not making things too easy for them.<br><br>The Harry <i>thing</i> was just severely creepy for me.  I like how you guys characterized him as sucking energy from powerful canons to explain the constant cuddling.

            <p>Several, in fact. ;) We thought a lot before choosing to keep them.

            <p>You/your agent would not be the first to succumb to Suicide&#39;s charms. Back in the day there was a pretty even split between Dafydd fangirls and Suicide fangirls, both in and out of HQ.

            <p>You dropped a bridge on him! And I get to be the first one to say so!<br><br>This was so great! Seriously. I loved what you did with the opening. The agent interaction was interesting. <br><br>I get the feeling that perhaps we are going to learn something about Nume&#39;s past soon. It was really interesting how frantic he suddenly became when they arrived at FicPsych. And Ilraen! He&#39;s getting so responsible and mature and his own character now!

It&#39;s a wonderful combination.<br><br>I liked watching him and Nume play off each other, and I hope they go on more missions together, just to see what happens.<br><br>The only thing that I thought was a bit odd was how laid back Nume and Suicide took it when Ilraen went off his rockers. I thought they&#39;d have a bit more urgency in making sure the two of them didn&#39;t fall off the edge. I did love how Suicide was being all instructive about it. He really seems to have a teaching side to him on occasion.<br><br><br><br>I saved some lines that I really liked. <br><br><br>After considering them for a moment, he discreetly laid a couple of pieces of bacon on top of them.<br><br> (was that just a hint of a triumphant, I-just-made-someone-I-don&#39;t-like-really-uncomfortable swagger in his walk?

            <p>The bridge may have fallen, but there was no body under there.

That said... yeah, maybe we are.<br><br>I know, Ilraen&#39;s all growing up and stuff. *sniff* He still has those moments of innocence, but I think the next time we see him he&#39;ll no longer be following along and struggling to get a word in.

            <p>I realize I haven&#39;t been by in ages (since I got permission, basically &gt;.&gt;), but I was rereading the HFA and was inspired to actually finish my mission; of course, now that I&#39;m almost done with it, it occurred to me that I should probably check and make sure I&#39;m not overreacting, because on the whole the problem with the fic in question isn&#39;t so much that it&#39;s <i>bad</i> as that it&#39;s <i>nothing</i>.

            <p>Is there anyone who knows enough about <i>The Dark is Rising</i> and would be up for reading through the mission to see if it&#39;s terrible? It requires knowledge of at least <i>The Dark is Rising</i> and <i> Greenwitch</i>. It&#39;s on the long side, I think (5627 words), and I&#39;m not sure how <i>funny</i> it is, as such — my agents have literally just met when the mission starts, and they&#39;re still getting used to both each other and the PPC (and, in Surhat&#39;s case, to being barred permanently, as far as he knows, from his home canon). Still, I think it has its moments.<br><br>If not, I think it&#39;ll probably be fine — I&#39;ll have another look at it tomorrow myself.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Lleu</p>

            <p>It&#39;s okay if your first mission isn&#39;t full of danger and derring-do. Use it for introducing your Agents, and have them bitch and complain aout the insipid boringness in your stead.</p>

            <p>Hi, :D<br><br>Hm... Mostly what you&#39;re annoyed with is bad characterization, an incredibly egregious case of Excuse Plot, and other mostly-plot related things?<br><br>Sounds similar to what MY first mission is going to look like. My fic doesn&#39;t have that many grammar mistakes, and it has almost no spelling mistakes (there are no minis that show up, and thank god for that because I&#39;ve already got way more than enough to cover), so I think it&#39;s all right that you start with the fanfic you&#39;re starting with.<br><br>Bad plotting makes many things just bad, so... yeah.<br><br>Though in your case, you have spelling errors in addition to all the stuff I&#39;ve got wrong with mine. Can I just say that I think bad pacing is a sin of bad fanfiction and we can call it a day from there?</p>

            <p>Each RC is completely different from the others. Since sometimes they reflect the personality (and the difference between) the Agents that work, or even live, in them, why don&#39;t actually show them? After all, words aren&#39;t always the perfect medium.<br><br>Hand-drawn sketches, cardboard dioramas, full 3D renderings, everything accepted!<br><br>Here&#39;s Sergio and Corolla&#39;s one (made in FPS Creator X10, a program that allows to make homebrew First Person Shooters. However, I have troubles making it work)<br><br><img src="http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/315/rc2y.jpg" alt="http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/315/rc2y.jpg"><br>Let&#39;s start with the most important thing of every RC: the console. On it, some gadgetry, a first-aid kit and Bleeprin.<br>Somehow I managed to build one that looks a lot like the official description.<br><br><img src="http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/5550/rc3r.jpg" alt="http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/5550/rc3r.jpg"><br>A small kitchen with fridge, kitchen sink, counter and a kitchen unit. Yes, the sink looks like a barrel with a lamp on it. That&#39;s because the barrel-and-lamp combination was the closest thing to a kitchen sink I had.<br>Notice Bleepka, shaker and mugs on the counter.<br><br><img src="http://img37.imageshack.us/img37/4918/rc5ty.jpg" alt="http://img37.imageshack.us/img37/4918/rc5ty.jpg"><br>Not very much to be seen here, the table, some cabinets full of random things and the bathroom door.<br><br><img src="http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/2914/rc4h.jpg" alt="http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/2914/rc4h.jpg"><br>Beds and wardrobe. Notice the lack of a coherent style on all the furniture used. That&#39;s what happens when you have to use whatever you find in the multiverse-hub that is HQ.<br><br><img src="http://img821.imageshack.us/img821/7042/rc1bs.jpg" alt="http://img821.imageshack.us/img821/7042/rc1bs.jpg"><br>Weapons rack (well, shelves) and a table for cleaning and maintenance with Sergios&#39; Beretta 92FS on it. The katana (previously owned by a Sue) is only there for show as a trophy.<br>On the shelves, from top to bottom:<br>-Barrett XM107. When a Sue claims to be bullet-proof, .50 armor piercing rounds are the best way to answer. Not very comfortable to use, though. (Heavy and with a lot of recoil. You have to fire it prone and with bipod unfolded)<br>-Colt M16A3 assault rifle. Only weapon that Sergio managed to bring along when he left his home continuum.<br>-Benelli M4 Super90 and Beretta 93R. The first is a very good shotgun, the latter the full-automatic version of the Beretta 92 pistol.<br>- Spare ammo for the XM107 and grenades.</p>

            <p>I know, I know. These guys haven&#39;t shown up yet, but they will soon! And this is fun.  These are more of a after they have lived there for a while kind of shots, than first moved in shots.  I think when they first moved in they would have had only the beds, Console chairs, mostly empty bookshelf, and wardrobe. I&#39;ve requested RC 27 for them.<br><br><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r7/Miah_Freeman/MaeandCarrysRC.jpg"><br><br>Please pretend that the brooms and rakes are actually things like swords and spears. Carry tinkers a bit with the weapons and does a bit of woodworking in his workshop corner. Maethrowen likes to paint, and keeps various useful plants wherever she can find room to stash them. <br><br><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r7/Miah_Freeman/MaeandCarrysRC2.jpg"><br><br>Carry and Nicodemus use the bunk bed, and Maethrowen uses the loft bed. Nicodemus has toys and play space under the loft bed.  <br><br><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r7/Miah_Freeman/MaeandCarrysRC3.jpg"><br><br>They keep mats and pillows that they bring out when they want to sit around and relax, eat, or share company. I shamelessly stole Neshomeh&#39;s rendition of the Console, because that does work really well, much better than my TV/computer combo that I had tried with the others.  Thank you for the idea!<br><br><br><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r7/Miah_Freeman/MaeandCarrysRC4.jpg"></p>

            <p>Miah and Cali just opened the NCIS mini adoption center, so that opens off of their regular RC.  I couldn&#39;t get their weapons in with this program, but those go on the shelf with the books. The tiny grey blobs are the minis, and the large ones are the agents...  I&#39;ll eventually find a program that makes better pictures. The walls are only shown on half height to make the objects more visible.

            <p>I don&#39;t know the number of words it may take. Anyway, my first Beta, PoorCynic has left the project, while my second Beta, Vilstrup, hasn&#39;t contacted me since April. Guvnor got a glance at my fics, but recommended that I go seek another Beta on the Board. So, here I am.<br><br>Anyway, the fic is set in an elaborate original setting where magic and technology both intersect. There are several anime influences, but nothing that&#39;s too glaring. The protagonists are all 13-14 years of age, and the plot currently revolves around a tournament for a fictional game. There is a bit of cossover potential (there is a Multiverse aspect), but it won&#39;t be explored within the fic itself. Expect some cliches, though.   </p>

            <p>It&#39;s pretty good for a first mission. It introduces your two agents nicely, which is good. It&#39;s hard to do a fic with no plot like this, but you seem to have done pretty well. I didn&#39;t catch any typos or things like that, which is good. I&#39;m not familiar with the canon but I enjoyed it anyway.<br><br>I&#39;m sure your missions will only get better with time.

            <p>Glad you liked it! My next target is a much worse (still <i>The Dark is Rising</i>) fic, so it should give Roger more of a chance to show off his snark. Unfortunately, since it takes place immediately after this, Surhat still won&#39;t know the canon. Oh, well! I&#39;ll give them a break after that so Surhat can get some reading done.<br><br>Lleu</p>

            <p>that is, if its metabolism is functioning.<br><br>A zoo may have more experience dealing with bears that have been treated badly. For instance, in Eastern Europe dancing bears were a circus attraction. Bears were abused to get them to dance.<br><br>In zoo that has such bears may also know how to deal with a drugged up Kodiak bear.

            <p>A zoo that has Kodiak bears <em>should</em> have a vet on staff that can handle their health issues.  Treating the sedative overdose shouldn&#39;t be a problem, they&#39;ve got to be prepped for a goof with the trank guns.  The hallucinogens are what&#39;s worrying me.  For that, you pretty much need the best bear vet around, and I have no idea where you&#39;d find him/her.</p>

            <p>Ever heard of ComicsNix? Apparently, he&#39;s a fanfic troll- one of the best there is. At first, the appalling grammar and bizarrely deviant content make him look like any other smutfic writer, but it&#39;s highly unlikely that any ordinary badfic writer would be able to spell the word &quot;phimosis&quot;, let alone use it correctly in a sentence. (If you&#39;re curious about what it means, don&#39;t be. Look it up if you wish, but you will most likely regret it.)<br><br>His FF.net account is right here. I suggest the story with Optimus Prime becoming Jabba the Hutt&#39;s sex gladiator along with Princess Leia Organa and R2-D2.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2194474/ComicsNix"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2194474/ComicsNix">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2194474/ComicsNix</a></a></p>

            <p>I&#39;m currently planning my next PPCing, which is a short but utterly horrific, possibly-plagiarized fic from the GI Joe fandom. I don&#39;t know of any agents who are currently active in the Joe world, so I went ahead and just used my best pair--Suicide and Diocletian. I know the canon, but they don&#39;t, and I thought that them being as much at sea as most of the readers hereabouts would prove a good way to explain said canon to both agents and readers at the same time. (Since Suicide is a former soldier, and this is a soldier-centric world in addition to a Mary Sue, it could be justifiably sent to him.)<br><br>My question is: do we have established protocols for when agents don&#39;t know the canon? Is there any kind of special CAD, a Pocket Fictionary or something, that could help them do their jobs? A Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Continuum? I&#39;ve searched the wiki but haven&#39;t been able to find anything. Is this an unprecedented situation? <br><br>I normally wouldn&#39;t send agents into an unfamiliar canon, but trust me when I say this thing needs to go.</p>

            <p>Off Topic:  I completely forgot to mention in my reply on your last mission that I released a Tae-Quon-Doe to live with Alice. It is a Korean Water Deer, which is a small-ish species with medium brown coat and spots. They have small fangs. This one is wearing a do-bok tied with a bleen belt (which is enough to kick the butt of the average agent apparently), and has a very aggressive attitude.<br><br>I was thinking about this, because of the release of the horses, and Suicide putting his name on one of them.

            <p>What does an agent do if he/she doesn&#39;t know a detail about canon that&#39;s important to the fic?  She can&#39;t get onto the internet (unless the continuum is in modern-day Earth, if then, since you still have to get a computer).  She probably wouldn&#39;t be carrying any extra information about canon, since she knows the continuum.  Can she call someone at HQ to check a detail for her?  I wanted Elena to do this last mission, but I didn&#39;t know if it was possible to call from a fic to HQ, and there&#39;s every indication that Elena has no friends in the PPC, so I didn&#39;t know who to have her call.<br><br>A Pocket Fictionary or Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide for the specific continuum would be a fantastic idea, except that no other agents so far have used one, so I think we&#39;d have to explain where it came from.  Also, don&#39;t forget that the Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy was not exactly the most reliable or unbiased book.  Earth was described in two words because the authors had spent too much space on subjects they liked better.<br><br>A device that keeps updated to the latest changes to the relevant wiki as of the time the agents leave for the mission would be really convenient.  It would be very complicated to make, but DoSAT is surely about to become more productive with Makes-Things back.  It might make life too easy for the agents, but considering wiki-editor mistakes and vandalism, incomplete wikis for less popular continua, and the tendency of PPC technology to mess up, you could keep it from being too useful.</p>

            <p>Admittedly, it was for <i>Star Trek</i>, so it was very easy for them to carry around a PADD with the entire Memory Alpha database on it, but I don&#39;t see why agents couldn&#39;t all have something similiar anyway (a Pocket Fictionary sounds like a <i>marvellous</i> idea) - it&#39;s not as though it&#39;d be much different from PPC technology such as neuralysers or Portal Generators. <br><br>Also, why be stopped by the fact that no agents so far (except mine, I guess) have used one? There&#39;s no reason not to invent gadgets as we go - that&#39;s part of what makes it fun. Trojie and I invented the Capillary Towel during one mission simply because we needed a way to clean up. No one I know of has made a fuss over the fact that we didn&#39;t give much explanation as to where it came from, nor would it be all that hard to make. We work in plot holes, remember?<br><br>Certainly, though, I agree with you that we don&#39;t want it making life too easy for the agents - and I can easily imagine some agents screaming at them in frustration when the batteries die or there&#39;s a glitch that shuts it off just as they&#39;re finding the information they need.<br><br><br>So shall I just go out on a limb and suggest that we just go ahead and add Pocket Fictionary to the standard tools agents use in the field?<br><br>It could be a small, handheld computer, like my agents used, that has a wiki (or wiki-like) compilation of information written and organised with agents and missions in mind, and it can have a nasty habit of breaking down or becoming sentient, like other PPC tech. Might I also suggest that it have a very basic camouflage function, or, if they are made to hold information one canon only, that they be disguised as some object common to the &#39;verse so that agents can consult it without ruining their cover? It could also be amusing if some were disguised as, say, rocks (for fairly primitive-era &#39;verses) and were given the additional authenticity of weighing the same, just to be annoying.<br><br>So, what do you all think? Does anyone have anything against the Pocket Fictionary? Any suggestions?<br><br><br>Sedri <br><br>(Also: Hi everyone! I know I haven&#39;t been around in a LONG time.

            <p>I was just pointing out that we&#39;d have to say it&#39;s a new tool that&#39;s just been developed.<br><br>I think it should be wiki-like, as you said, because it won&#39;t give enough information as a dictionary.  But I think it would make sense to have it be a book in universes where computers aren&#39;t used -- which would probably mean that there&#39;s no search function and the agents have to use the index.  It could easily have a camouflage function like DORKS.

            <p>it shouldn&#39;t always talk down to agents, since there are details of canon that even the best agent doesn&#39;t know.  The thing I wanted to look up last mission was pretty obscure (one of them had literally a one- or two-sentence wookieepedia article).  But I think that if you use it a couple of times in a row, or you&#39;re looking up really general or obvious things, it should catch onto that.  Maybe it has a trigger so that if you search something REALLY obvious, it assumes you know nothing about the continuum.  This would also be funny, because then the agents would notice how it was starting to think that they&#39;re clueless.<br><br>I guess it could talk down to the agents and make the experienced ones feel really frustrated with it.

            <p>If you like, sure, though I see no dire reason why we can&#39;t pretend it&#39;s been around for a long time and not everyone has known about it - it&#39;s not as though the PPC is great at memos to keep everyone informed about things. Probably the best way to go, I think, would be to have your agents recieve one for the first time and be deliberately vague about how many other agents know about or have one (because, really, I&#39;d love it if my agents had one of these before and I just didn&#39;t name it).<br><br>The DORKS camouflage function, yes - that&#39;s what I was trying to remember.

            <p>I&#39;m at work, and stuck listening to music I despise. This gets me thinking &quot;Oh geez, Mary Sue&quot; repeatedly. Specifically, Misery Business by Paramore.

            <p>I&#39;m working on my first mission.  It&#39;s a <i>Hogan&#39;s Heroes</i> fic, and all the characters are consistently referring to Hogan <u>in speech</u> as &quot;Col. Hogan&quot;.

            <p>Is that not common practice for military titles? If I were writing a story with military characters, I would definitely use them, with the possible exceptions of &quot;Capt.&quot; and &quot;Cmdr.&quot;. I&#39;d say it&#39;s equivalent to using &quot;Mr.&quot; instead of &quot;Mister/Master&quot; or &quot;Mssrs.&quot; for &quot;Messieurs&quot; à la the Marauders.<br><br>But maybe I&#39;m wrong and standard practice is to write out the full title, in which case I don&#39;t really know.<br><br>My instinct is to say that if it&#39;s that consistent it represents a conscious choice rather than an error. In my opinion, even if it deviates from standard practice, it&#39;s not &quot;wrong&quot;, per se. I guess I would ask if they do it for other military titles, if any appear. If so, then I think it&#39;s fine as long as the fic is internally consistent. If not, then maybe you&#39;ve got something for inconsistency, but...<br><br>Regards,<br>Lleu</p>

This is their work, their ideas, their opinions, and their worlds/universes. And they have given you fair warning that its an MPreg fic. Avoid it. How about you show us what YOU have and we can judge you? Would you like that?

            <p>However, they&#39;re all Teen rating. Badly written, but still no major squick.

            <p>By reading white on black blackground, with the very compact font that is used, you are <i>severely</i> straining your eyes.

            <p>Hogod. I&#39;m new to this. Recently discovered this wonderful thing here. (I mean, I&#39;m writing a spin-off of OFUM for Kingdom Hearts on FFN, and when perusing other OFUs found out about you guys. Anyway.) <br><br>I have found this utterly disgusting Sue. Can beat SEPHIROTH at the tender age of what, ten? Specializes in strength, defense and magic. Super-cedes canon character. Grammar abuse. Can open Kingdom Hearts at will. No plot whatsoever; it simply traverses the plot of canon. Axel and Lea/OC. NYAGH. I am BLINDED. <br><br>Anyone willing to kill this Sue in a preferably agonizing way? </p>

            <p>Oh yum. Mind if I give some to my tiger? Hopefully these are made of fangirls...<br><br>I actually went on the Suethor&#39;s deviantART account and found out that the Sue&#39;s outfit is basically Aqua&#39;s in pink. <br><br>Basically all of them. I forgot to add the S. *grimace* Sorry.<br><br>Oh yeah.<br><br>Everyone&#39;s also pretty out of character. There are a lot of things that don&#39;t make sense, like in the first chapter she says that she didn&#39;t cry at her mother&#39;s death (yeah, um, where&#39;s her father? He didn&#39;t get mentioned at all.) but then when her mother dies she cries her eyes out and Lea and Isa try their best to cheer her up. Then after that it just goes through the canon plot. Classic KH Sue: meets up with Sora, Donald and Goofy, becomes best friends and dominates everyone and steals lines. At least she doesn&#39;t have a Keyblade. </p>

            <p>Strength, defense and magic, eh?  That&#39;s not specializing, that&#39;s being greedy.  What did they do, get a Moogle to meld the sword, shield and staff from the beginning into one freakish super-weapon?  When will people learn that characters that can do everything are dull?</p>

            <p>Yeah. Did I mention that she can summon a katana called Hope&#39;s Sky, despite the fact that she isn&#39;t a Nobody and the katana isn&#39;t a mysterious and magical weapon like the Keyblade. No...it&#39;s a generic katana. She trained with Sephiroth who was a general in Ansem&#39;s castle yet somehow he still plays the same role as embodied darkness of Cloud&#39;s heart. ...?<br><br>I&#39;m honestly not sure.

            <p>First off, welcome to the Board, it now owns your soul (or Heart, but I think youèd want to keep that).<br><br>That does sound disgustingly sparkly, however here are a few tips for reporting...<br><br>One, when reporting a Mary-Sue make sure to have a link to the fic the Sue is from so we can make a proper appraisal of said Sue and its awfulness ourselves.<br><br>Two, failing to link us, at least have a passage of the terible Suefic along with the title and its author.<br><br>And one more thing, never expect anyone to take a mission right off the bat - it&#39;s like expecting Harper to be thrown out of office. It&#39;ll happen, but not any time soon. XD Agents tend to be terribly busy, y&#39;know. Plus writers for their own spin-off series tend to be busy and have a back-log of missions already lined up.<br><br>So, yeah...just wanted to state that. Sorry if I sound like an awful, awful, admonishing mean person. I just want things to be clear.<br><br>I thought Kingdom Hearts already had an OFUM, but I guess it&#39;s been a while since it was updated. Hope it works out for you. And remember, an official OFUM has to be approved by Miss Sandman~! If not you&#39;re an unofficial one. XD Yeah~! Regulations, regulations, regulations~! Would still love to read what you have for your OFUM though!<br><br>Also, that Sue does need to die.</p>

            <p>These are the profiles for my two agents, Gretalis and Sammy.<br><br>Name: Gretalis<br>Age: 26<br>Species: Gluttony-Demon<br>Appearence: Like any other human. Oh, except he has fangs. And white hair. Actually rather thin, despite his origins. Also has hazel eyes, and is cacausian.<br>Favorite Series&#39;: Kingdom Hearts, Homestuck, The Simpsons<br>Weapon of Choice: Knives. Lots of them.<br>Place of Birth: The gluttony circle of hell.<br>Bio: Used to work for the forces of hell as a corruption-grunt. Yknow, convincing that one lady at the buffet to take that extra chicken wing, getting that kid to buy an extra candy bar... But he got bored, and locked himself in his room, reading fan fiction. He found some pretty good ones, but he was tired of the constant sues. Then he discovered the PPC, and applied. He now works there. He has a habit of combining sue blood with wine, then drinking the mix and &quot;reviewing&quot; the flavor and texture. His partner, Sammy, thinks it&#39;s overly dramatic and stupid.<br><br>Name: Sammy<br>Age: 26<br>Appearence: A brown haired man that&#39;s constantly seen in a sharp looking suit, has brown eyes, and he&#39;s rather bony. Also cacausian.<br>Favorite Series&#39;: House, Harry Potter, South Park<br>Weapon of choice: Rifle.<br>Place of Birth: Somewhere in Nevada. To be specific, an area known for it&#39;s frequent sheriff assassination attempts, as well as a well known fight involving Jesus over a single boombox.<br>Bio: A buisiness man, who decided to quit his lucrative job as a CEO for the manufacturers of Bleeprin products and decided to work with the people most likely to use the products. He&#39;s now picked up a nasty bleepka habit. He&#39;s usually calm and collected, and thinks his partners habit of combining sue-blood with wine and giving a pseudo review of the taste and texture is unneccesarily dramatic.<br><br>Well, what do you think? Anything too sue-ish about them? If so, please let me know.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s a question: did you read the Board Constitution before you posted this? Just curious, is all.<br><br>I ask because the Board Constitution specifically mentions that you should lurk here for at least a month before you go posting for Permission or anything equating that (like this). And by that, they don&#39;t mean hide-lurk: they mean post every so often, head to the IRC chat every so often, and that way stuff like this doesn&#39;t come totally out of the blue. This situation here is sort of like being the only guy to show up at a protest for an issue of some sort: you show up with banners and everything and you&#39;ve got good intent, but you end up getting funny looks at the end of the day since it kind of came out of nowhere.<br><br>Really, everyone else put it better than I did.<br><br>If you&#39;re new here, welcome. =D</p>

            <p>First of all: Who are you? You appear to be new here. Going back two months of the Board, I can&#39;t find hide nor hair of you. So before you eagerly jump into Company Business, who are you please? <br><br>Second: What Nesh said. There are in-universe rules for all whole host of little details. When it&#39;s something that alters the Canon in any way, you need permission to do it. This is what separates us from the badficcers. <br><br>Third: On the characters: I agree with Sammy on Gretalis&#39; actions. To me, they&#39;re over-the-top, unnecessary, and dangerous. I would also like to see an explanation as to how and why he is so skinny despite his origins, since you brought it up. Also: Even disregarding the Bleeproducts thing, If Sammy is the CEO of some major corporation, and making beauxcoup bucks, why did he quit his job to join the PPC? To quote one of my Agents, on the matter of money: &quot;Paid? You get <i>paid?</i> Why don&#39;t we get paid?&quot;<br><br>... So yeah. That&#39;s it for now. </p>

            <p>Is this meant to be a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> request? The lack of answer to this is slightly troubling to me, particularly coupled with the fact that your explanation about misunderstanding the &quot;lurking&quot; part makes no sense, since there&#39;s nothing about lurking in the description of the Permission process—or the <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/Constitution.htm">Board Constitution</a>, for that matter, except to say that lurking will likely get you badly confused and thus joining in is encouraged—and tells me you have not read either, which is a bad thing if you intend to have PPC agents. Please read both through before answering to ensure we&#39;re all on the same page here. Thanks.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to assume this is a permission request, as these are agent profiles, so you should go read this:<br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission</a></a><br><br>It&#39;s a list of the things you should do before applying for permission to create your own spinoff/write missions and how to go about doing it.<br><br>As a general rule if no one knows who you are, you need to wait longer before trying to ask for permission.

            <p>So, I&#39;ve looked around but couldn&#39;t find the answer to this: What if a character is possessed by another character from another fandom in a crossover? I found and have been reading a pretty bad crossover between HP and Hetalia (<a href="http://m.fanfiction.net/s/6245168/1/"><a href="http://m.fanfiction.net/s/6245168/1/">http://m.fanfiction.net/s/6245168/1/</a></a>) which has Harry possessed by Austria, Hermione by Hungary, Draco by Prussia, Luna by Belarus, etc. If someone did a mission on this or a similar fic, how would they handle the possessions? Do they do a normal exorcism and send the other characters&#39; souls to their continuum (or something like that) or is it not truly a crossover and the Author-wraith is controlling the characters and making them OOC/delirious (in which case it would be a normal exorcism most likely) or is it something else entirely?</p>

            <p>But if they were OCs that would still mean that the OCs were being possessed by canon characters of Hetalia (yes, Austria, Hungary, etc. are all names of canons, as weird as that sounds). Or are you saying that it&#39;s not an actual crossover and only consists of HP OCs thinking they&#39;re Hetalia canons? So much to think about! </p>

            <p>They might simply be OCs thinking they are HP characters being possessed by Hetalia characters, yes.

            <p>In which Florestan and Eusabius untangle one of the dumbest excuse plots ever conceived by man.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t6TLXtAgj_iCLJUxGQEXUnYMrc6cknxU_KSwk4B2Lr0/edit?hl=en_US&amp;authkey=CJSjnvgI"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t6TLXtAgj_iCLJUxGQEXUnYMrc6cknxU_KSwk4B2Lr0/edit?hl=en_US&amp;authkey=CJSjnvgI">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t6TLXtAgj_iCLJUxGQEXUnYMrc6cknxU_KSwk4B2Lr0/edit?hl=en_US&amp;amp;authkey=CJSjnvgI</a></a>#<br><br>Seriously. It&#39;s a really stupid excuse plot.<br><br>Anyway... extra stuff from the missions:<br><br>I have the following recruits from the mission:<br><br>Jessie<br>Stan Jones<br>Zerenze<br><br>I&#39;m leaving Jessie and Stan to whoever wants to take them. Zerenze... I&#39;m not so sure about yet. I&#39;ll let you know what I hope to do with him later. You can make up whatever bios you want, as the story only defines Jessie, Stan, and Zerenze as being from the Halo continuum, with Jessie and Stan being humans and Zerenze being a sangheili.<br><br>So yeah. I hope you enjoyed the mission!</p>

            <p>I just finished that, and wow. Just wow.<br><br>Good writing on your part, though; really enjoyed the characters. Well worth the read.<br><br>SMG just felt tacked on. I can&#39;t help but wonder if this was a trollfic, or a trollauthor. Maybe I&#39;m just naive and hopeful that this isn&#39;t the kind of... normal thing... I don&#39;t even know.</p>

            <p>And he has 11 other stories that are exactly the same way. Well... twelve as of yesterday, actually. They all more or less fall into the same pitfalls, but again, perhaps the most egregious one is his rewrite of the original Star Wars trilogy. I might spork that one some day, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s got way too much stupid for Florestan and Eusabius to be able to handle alone.<br><br>Thanks! I&#39;m glad you liked it! =D</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve tossed around the thought of doing it as a collab mission, actually. It&#39;s his longest story so far, and it&#39;s every bit the train wreck the other stories are.<br><br>But I want to get in a few missions between this one and that one, so I won&#39;t act on it for a while, I&#39;m afraid.
