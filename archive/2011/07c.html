            <p>The bot thing happens every so often, though we get rather suspicious of the timing. It happened about this time last year, and the year before, which is a tad troubling, but generally we have a few days of trouble before the admins can work out how to block the bot and then we have fun playing with the debris (take a look at the wiki article on the Ypur invasion for an example). <br><br>You can feed Sues to LotR dragons if the fic they come from is Tolkienverse or at least crossed over with it - as said below, you can&#39;t just take them from one continumn to another at whim to feed your favourite monster. Fat monsters no good ;)<br><br>The horror that is cafeteria food is a mystery no one has yet been brave enough to investigate. That is, I&#39;ve no idea. If no one else knows either, decide for yourself.<br><br>My agents wouldn&#39;t eat cafeteria food if their lives depended on it. Which they have. But other agents seem to survive the experience and even enjoy it, so it&#39;s probably the Laws of Narrative Comedy (or their ilk) having a laugh.<br><br>Go ahead and ask more as they occur to you. The request to keep things in one post is to avoid having the same person start four or five new threads in a row - if you think of something in a week, don&#39;t come and ask on this thread, because no one will see it. :)</p>

            <p>I have a running joke in my Kelok and Unger stories that they eat in the cafeteria and prefer the meatloaf and pudding. The meatloaf tries to crawl off the plate and the pudding is blue flavored. What exactly blue tastes like I am not sure. The cafeteria food was the first food Kelok ever ate, so for a long time he actually thought the cafeteria food was how things were supposed to be.</p>

            <p>No, seriously. Down here we have a kind of juice called &quot;drink&quot; (or &quot;drank, if you want the phonetic spelling) that is maybe 5% juice. It comes in a great many flavors, none of which taste like what they&#39;re supposed to. Well, except Orange Drink, which tastes orange. No, not the fruit, the color.<br><br>The point of all of this is that I know what blue tastes like. It tastes like Blue Raspberry Drink. Which, in retrospect, tastes blue. I guess the only way to find out for yourself would be to find it and try it. Drink is usually found in the cruddy grocery stores. Food Depot, Piggly Wiggly, Five and Dime, places like that.<br><br>(For the curious, the other flavors are &quot;Grape&quot;, which tastes purple, &quot;Green Apple&quot; which tastes green, &quot;Tropical Punch&quot;, which tastes red, and &quot;Lemonaid&quot;, which depending on the brand might actually taste similar to lemonaid, but usually tastes yellow.)</p>

            <p>I think it&#39;s OK to feed sues to LotR dragons (IIRC, one got fed to Glaurung in TOS) but it&#39;s not OK to move Sues in between canons.<br><br>As for the spambot, we appear to have been the unfortunate victim of a test run hence the insane messages earlier.

            <p>As far I know, even though you have the option of logging in, you don&#39;t <em>need</em> to, even to post a new topic. I&#39;ve only logged in once, when I first joined, but that&#39;s it; I&#39;ve been able to post new topics without being logged in as well. Apparently, a lot of people have trouble with it, and it was decided that logging in wasn&#39;t such a vital action as long as everyone knows who&#39;s posting. Someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong.</p>

            <p>This was fun to read, but generally, an MST should focus less on pointing out each punctuation error, and more on making jokes about what&#39;s happening in the story.  Obviously, sometimes the grammar can fuel such jokes, when they cause funny or unusual imagery, but just pointing out every missing period and misspelled word gets repetitive for the reader.  For example, I found your running gag about the capitalized Father referring to God hilarious, as the MSTers got more and more flustered by it.  So in future MSTs, try to make more of the stupid behavior in the fic, rather than the writing errors of the fic&#39;s author (except those that make for funny jokes).</p>

            <p>Hi. I&#39;m working on my first mission, and I have a few questions about the fic I&#39;ve chosen for it. Here&#39;s the link:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5763760/1/Kiayas_Journey"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5763760/1/Kiayas_Journey">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5763760/1/Kiayas_Journey</a></a><br><br>First off, it was suggested to me that this might be a trollfic. I&#39;m not entirely sure how you spot a trollfic, so could I get a second opinion from someone else? Part of me is convinced that this is so bad it has to be that way on purpose, but some of the author&#39;s notes have me pretty convinced this is an English girl of roughly 16 writing one of the most blatant &#39;Sues it has ever been my misfortune to find.<br><br>Secondly, the level of bad here is making it hard to find a good point to just kill her off at. She destroys the canon from chapter one, has terrible spelling, grammar, and characterization....and it&#39;s consistent. Near the end she starts dropping blatant hints that she&#39;s turning into/is the &quot;Spirit of Fire,&quot; but will that work? Or should I just wait until the end, and kill her?<br><br>Speaking of the end....is there a limit on how long a mission can be? Could I split this into several parts, like three or four? It&#39;s a twenty-nine chapter fic with mostly long chapters (though there are those chapters purely for paragraph-long a/ns). I really want to spork this particular fic for my first one, but is it too much for a first-timer like me?</p>

            <p>I do not play the Call of Cthulhu RPG nor it&#39;s Delta Green supplement, Actually, table-top RPG&#39;s are pretty much alien to me.<br><br>But the basic structure, that of the investigators battling squamous evils and holding back the maddening death of mankind (no matter who they have to kill to keep themselves and the horrors hidden); as well as the plan I have for a mythos-based fic I have in the works, leads me to a question.<br><br>What if Delta Green (or the Miskatonic University Kickassery and Polo Club) went into a situation expecting to face another evil... and found something less icky, but perhaps odder.  With lots of Wrong-Genre Saavy.<br><br>Picture it: Essex County Mass, 1961.  A young Miskatonic Sophmore is recruited by a group of investigators to provide the brains for a mission: children have been going missing and another uptick in cult sacrifices is expected for the annual Samhein.  After exhaustive tracking work, they pursue a shaggy looking young man who is fleeing with a young runaway.  Armed with pistols, shotguns, old Tommy Guns and a good amount of dynamite, they enter a section of forest upstream from Arkham...<br><br>And suddenly late spring replaces the fall weather they had been dressed for.  They have entered a Lilac Wood and, in a grove within that wood, find an entire community of feral children, the oldest of which have already began pairing off and having children of their own.  Seemingly possessed of an inhuman ability for stealth, they ambush the investigators, killing several of them wile some get killed themselves.  <br><br>However, something begins coming forward out of the forest toward those tho lay injured but not dying.  The investigators, seemingly hardened men who have faced unearthly horrors with only minimal SAN loss, watch in frozen incomprehension as the tip of an opaline horn touches each of the injured, feral youth and outsider alike, and brings them back to health.  The feral youth form a screen around the creature as it and them disappear back into the woods.<br><br>In short, opinions within the party differ between those who think this creature might be benign or even a potential ally  against other creatures (the academics) and those who don&#39;t want to take the chance of a Mythos infection spreading (likely DG Feds).  A seige of the grove develops and the situation escalates as research is done and heavy artillery is continually threatened.  <br><br>In the end, it&#39;s the young Miskatonic student that helps diffuse the situation, convincing the creature (more multi-dimensional energy being than flesh and blood unicorn, but still) to have the youths leave, despite its rather blue-and-orange morality (that it keeps runaways and orphans safe and healthy while at the same time turning them into something more like forest elves than humans). <br><br>He helps bring these children (and young adults) back into society and stops the firebomb option while securing a potential ally chain against the scarier Abominations that eventually pans out.  Hooray for him.  However, for that experience, the student makes permenant enemies of certain militant cells within Delta Green and pretty much loses much of his remaining SAN.<br><br>Not to mention... even to this day, you can&#39;t see yourself when you look into his eyes.  Just a dim reflection of that same lilac wood.  That did not help in the romance department at all, and may have played a role in his development as the mentor-academic.<br><br>The whole scenario is meant to introduce the idea that, even in Delta Green (withit&#39;s nihilism, scorched earth policies and other hooha), not everything should have an immediate kill order on it, that SAN loss takes different forms... and how the primitive Sue-glamour exuded by Beagle Unicorns might work while applied to the Mythos.<br><br>Actually, it&#39;s more of the Profs back-story for my Mythos fic.  <br><br>Anyway, what do you think?  I know it&#39;s a bit Derlethian, but I was just curious.<br></p>

            <p>Just point-form since my other post never made it.<br><br>-Never Played COC nor DG (sounds too dang depressing)<br><br>-Unicorn morphs a little section of Lovecraft Country into a Lilac Wood of perpetual Spring, with it&#39;s own little colony of feral children (some having grown into feral young adults who are having feral babies), who eventually begin acting more like forest beasts than humans.<br><br>This colony acts as the &quot;cult&quot; for the Unicorn, acting to bring runaways and street kids under the protection and tranquility of their world (up to and including kidnapping kids out of shelters of questionable safety).  Although it operates on Blue-and-Orange morality, a basic sense of sympathy and protectiveness can be identified when communicating with the Unicorn.<br><br>-Investigators investigate, bringing tommy guns, pistols, shotguns and dynamite.  Turns out they&#39;re being wrong-genre-savvy.  They lay siege to the place after witnessing the healing power of the beast after a fight with a few of it&#39;s &quot;attendants&quot;.<br><br>-Miskatonic student eventually brokers a deal with this thing... potential ally with Investigators/Delta Green/Whatever and it lets (or makes) the kids go back to the human world.  Gives a &quot;keep your trees green and yourself safe&quot; speech upon leaving negotiations. However, he&#39;s made enemies of the more militant, scorched-earth elements of the organization after avoiding a full-on napalm attack.  They think he&#39;s gone borderline cultist on them.<br><br>-also... he&#39;s been changed. Functional, but steady at about 3 Sanity points with the conviction that his fellows are entirely too gun-happy and intolerant of the more benign eldrich whazits.  The Glamour of this thing never truly wore off, nor did some of its &quot;magic&quot;. It doesn&#39;t help that if you stare into his eyes, you can&#39;t see your reflection, but merely that of that same forest from so long ago.<br><br>Now, have I mutilated the genre or what?</p>

            <p>Tentative greeting: Hullo y&#39;all. <br>I somehow stumbled across the PPC wiki after reading the Fanfic MSTs on Topless Robot (well, re-stumbled since I had vaguely heard of you guys around TvTropes, but god knows I don&#39;t remember what happens there too clearly). Anyway, the culture immediately struck me as that great blend of wacky, encouraging, and full of caustic, cutting sarcasm that I so crave, so I decided I&#39;d poke my head in. I&#39;m currently in the middle of reading the original series (If only I could stop getting distracted).<br>...anyway, m i doin it rite?</p>

            <p>Nom! Choc-o-late! Thank you!<br>As for fandoms, I hop around, I&#39;ve never been very prolific in any fandoms, though. I&#39;ve pretty much been everywhere, huge fan of all things geek. I&#39;m very familiar with DCverse and Marvelverse, and i&#39;m currently bouncing around the MLP, A Song of Ice and Fire, and Katawa Shoujo forums. I&#39;m also always on TvTropes, don&#39;t know if that counts.</p>

            <p>This mission almost felt like a tour of Sanctuary fanfiction, highlighting different parts that show up frequently.  I also like that it had a bit of an adventurous quality, with Miah and Cali exploring new, unknown fics as they wander the fandom.  Also, I can&#39;t believe this is the first time the Titanic has ever shown up in a mission (to my knowledge).  It&#39;s such a well-known, popular thing, you would think it would show up in different fandoms more often.</p>

Add to that the fact that she could barely hold a projectile weapon without blowing her own rear end off and Intelligence was the only place she could fit in at the moment when what she really wanted to do was to blast, slice, impale and generally murder some Mary Sues.<br><br>But now she was a wizard.  With a pointy hat.  And a beard you could hide a chicken in.  And a staff.<br><br>Perhaps this was the wrath of Rowling upon her: she&#39;d only skimmed the plot of the last two Potter books loosely, she subscribed to fringe conspiracy literature (that purported that Epilogue!Harry had 5 kids by 2 different women)and fanfic was her pretty much her last remaining link to that world.<br><br>Then again, perhaps this was the fault of someone within the PPC, in which case she would pry the truth out eventually, preferably slowly and with great pain.<br><br>Perhaps... perhaps she should venture out and see what was happening.  It couldn&#39;t be any worse than in here.<br><br>And if anyone laughed... well, maybe the big stick would come in handy.<br><br>(My first RP participation in the whole of ever.  Exhilarating)</p>

            <p>He had no idea what time it was, but he felt well-rested, and the Console wasn’t beeping, and that meant it was time to read.  There were only a few chapters left in <i>The Cavalier in White</i>, and Doc was itching to find out who had stolen the titular painting.  As he fished around inside his pillowcase for the book, Doc had the weird impression that the walls looked different somehow.  The generic surface was a bit…never mind.  He opened the book, stuck the bookmark behind his ear and—<br><br>Couldn’t read.  The pages were all blurry.  Doc rubbed his eyes, trying to wake them up.  It didn’t help; the letters were still a greyish smear on the page.  Confused, Doc squinted, looking around the room.<br><br>He saw the lines on the refrigerator door.  He read the titles of his books on the shelf.  He made out individual buttons on the Console.  And for one <i>very</i> brief moment, Doc grinned in excitement.  He didn’t need glasses anymore!  He could see every—<br><br>His grin melted away as he looked back at the novel.  He held it away from his face.  He retrieved his glasses from their case, hanging from the bed board above his head, and put them on.  Nothing he tried changed anything.  His glasses were supposed to fix his near-sightedness.  And overnight, Doc had turned far-sighted.<br><br>Agent Vania was awakened by a shriek from the bunk above her.  Having stayed up late the previous night playing video games, she was in no mood to wake up early, especially if it wasn’t for a mission.  She got up and peeked over the top bunk.<br><br>Doc was swaddled in blankets, huddled against the back of the bed, staring forlornly at a book in the center of his mattress.<br><br>[<u>What’s the matter?</u>] Vania asked, immediately aware that something was wrong with her voice.<br><br>“The Precious…”  A tear slid out of Doc’s eye.  “We can’t—wait.”  Doc’s Gollum-speak immediately ceased.  “What’s with your voice?”<br><br>[<u>I’m not…sure.</u>]  Whenever Vania spoke, although her mouth hadn’t moved, and she had produced no sound, both she and Doc observed a grey rectangle appear, floating in midair in their respective ranges of vision.  The boxes contained her words in white letters.  Once she finished her thought, the rectangle would disappear.<br><br>[<u>I seem to be speaking in—text box,</u>] Vania decided.<br><br>“And my vision is all screwed up,” Doc whined.  “I can’t <i>read.</i>  What is going on?”<br><br>Vania swung her legs out of the bed and stretched.

            <p>The former Fallout Ghoul sighed. &quot;I am now a talking chicken.&quot; He said to no one in particular. Gurgan looked around the empty RaE lab where he had been napping-er, studying dilligently to become a full-fledged member of the PPC, yessirree, no napping here-and took a deep breath. &quot;I did not enter this room as a chicken.

            <p>Pending either her assignment to an Agent pair or her approval to become a full Agent, Intern Ally Malet spent her time in an empty Response Center, reading guidebooks to the PPC, memorising possible charge lists and repeating the Sunflower Official&#39;s list of reasons as to why she was never going to be allowed back in her home continuum with pride. Considering her former life as a citizen of District Eight in the Hunger Games-verse, this was a much better life, even if she had nearly nothing to do. <br><br>Ally strongly reconsidered this view the moment she looked in the mirror, that morning.<br>Her eyes were purple. Her skin, normally tanned from years of working out of doors, was soft and white. Her plain features had become beautiful, her strong, muscular arms now resembled that of an eight-year-old&#39;s, and her hair, usually very short and carrot-red, had become long and a rather vivid shade of green. In short, she now resembled the two things she despised the most- citizens of the Capitol, and Mary Sues.<br><br>Her eyes narrowed. For a moment, she considered her new appearance, before speaking in a low, flat tone. <br>&quot;Someone is going to die for this.&quot;<br>Unfortunately for her homicidal plans, Ally found that not only could she no longer lift her prized axe, just trying to grasp it made her hands hurt. Cursing, she found her long knife, and after slipping her urple arm band on, she walked into the corridors of PPC HQ, looking for answers.<br><br>----<br>Grace Leon, an intern of DoSAT, was awakened from her light doze at her workstation by a rather loud explosion. Shrugging it off as just another day in DoSAT, she reached for her glasses and knocked them aside, frowning at her apparent clumsiness. After a few tries, she managed to pick her glasses up and put them on. The moment her hand came into view, she froze. Her hands were now huge, her fingers thick and stubby. Her eyes widened in horror and she let out a small shriek, frantically looking around for any spilt potions or malfunctioning machinery that could have caused it. Finding none, she got up and made her way to the exit, holding her hands out in front of her. On the way, she caught a look at herself in a shiny, reflective piece of metal, and let out another scream before running straight out of DoSAT.<br><br>----<br>Fingering the hilt of her knife, Ally was walking down the corridor for what seemed like the fifth time, until a screaming figure ran right into her, knocking her down.<br>&quot;OW!&quot; she exclaimed crossly, shoving the other figure off her and climbing to her feet. She looked around for her knife and saw it a few metres away. Once she&#39;d grabbed it, she turned back to the person who&#39;d run into her.<br><br>&quot;My hair! My hands! My hair! Oh God, *my hair*!&quot; the other woman gabbled.<br>Ally didn&#39;t see what was wrong. The woman, whose urple armband marked her as a fellow intern, had short white hair, nothing out of the ordinary. Her hands did seem grossly oversized, though.<br>Ally grimaced and tried to be comforting. &quot;Er... calm down?&quot;<br>&quot;MY HANDS! MY HAIR!&quot;<br>&quot;What&#39;s so bad about your hair?&quot; Ally asked, trying to make sense of it.<br>&quot;It&#39;s just like hers...&quot; the woman gasped.<br>Ally looked at her quizzically before deciding not to ask. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br>&quot;Grace. Grace Leon.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, Grace, let&#39;s go see if we can find someone who can help. Maybe Doctor Fitz?&quot;<br>&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Grace nodded, managing to calm down. After a few seconds of walking, she said awkwardly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I knocked you over.&quot;<br>&quot;Eh, don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Ally shrugged. <br>They kept walking, determined to find answers.<br></p>

            <p>Ally tried not to laugh at the language the other intern was using. One of the many reasons she loved the PPC was that her home continuum had little to no instances of swearing, and since joining the PPC, her vocabulary had considerably widened.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m Ally. She&#39;s Grace,&quot; she said, jerking a finger at Grace, who now looked nervous, but not hysterical. &quot;And no, we were just looking for someone who could tell us what was going on. But I do have a cigarette here...&quot; She pulled a couple out of a pocket and offered them to the other interns. Grace shook her head.</p>

But the newcomer had called her... well, the time for petty bickering definitely wasn&#39;t now. Sighing, she took out her knife and handed it to the (long term) Intelligence intern. &quot;I expect it back, though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, you&#39;re getting it back.  In fact, How about I join up with you guys: solve this thing, get back to normal, crack some skulls?&quot;  Portia took the knife by the handle, tugged the end of the beard so that the hair was taut and began to slice though a rough handful of strands at a time.  </p>

            <p>The Fisherman only realised that something was wrong when he woke up lying on the floor of his TARDIS. He went to speak, but found that his vocal cords didn’t want to work, or at least not in the way he expected.<br><br>“Whhhaat,” he managed to say in a gurgling voice after a few seconds. “Don’t tell me we crashed again.” As his head cleared and he stood up, he realised that something was very wrong. His skin felt very dry, as if he’d been walking in the desert for days, and Evie was nowhere to be seen. He activated the monitor, which showed that the TARDIS was parked in the Cafeteria at HQ.<br><br>“Hello?” a synthesized voice said. “Fish-face!”<br><br>The Fisherman looked down to see a round white ball with two handles and a pink eye looking up at him from the floor. He instantly recognised it as a Personality Core from the Portal continuum. Had Evie been… regressed somehow?<br><br>“What happened to you?” he asked. “How did you become a core?”<br><br>“You think my problems are bad,” Evie replied. “You’re a fish.”<br><br>“What.”<br><br>“Seriously. Take a look at yourself.”<br><br>The Fisherman flicked a switch on the monitor and gaped at what he saw. While he was still humanoid, his head was now distinctly fishy, with large eyes, blue scales, gills and a thin mouth and chin. He looked down at his hands. Still human-ish, but now scaly and webbed.<br><br>“What in the Worlds has happened to us?” he shouted.<br><br>“Maybe we should go outside, see if we can find any information?” Evie offered.<br><br>“Yeah, good point. Hang on though.” The Fisherman rushed off deeper into the TARDIS.<br><br>“That’s OK. Just leave me here!” Evie said once he was out of sight. “I’m fine with sitting on the floor. It’s sooo much fun.”<br><br>“That’s better,” the Fisherman declared when he returned a few minutes later. He had some sort of glass helmet on; it was open at the top and filled with water.<br><br>“Very fetching,” Evie said. “A fishbowl for fish-face.”<br><br>“Come on,” her partner replied, picking her up and heading out of the TARDIS.<br></p>

She figured it out just as the Fisherman and Evie emerged from the Cafeteria.<br><br>&quot;No, Lee, don&#39;t--!&quot; Ian tried to say, but before he could stop Lee, she jumped at the Fisherman with a gleeful cry of <i>FISH!</i> and latched onto his leg, trying to get at the tasty fish.</p>

I can&#39;t remember the name.&quot; Kirill turned to face Emm, then stepped as hard as he could on the man&#39;s foot. &quot;Listen to me. Whoever turned me into this-&quot; he pointed at his brand new ears and mammaries- &quot;didn&#39;t do at random. A transformation into an elf- degrading. Into a woman- intriguing. Into a Slesnaya? Disgusting. I can almost feel my brain rotting with their sweet, sickly, nauseating twoo wub of life- if the transformation starts going deeper, it will be horrible. I&#39;d drown in- what do you call it, emotion that says you oughtn&#39;t- guilt. I might feel guilt.&quot;<br><br>With a visible effort, Kirill caught his temper. He wanted to rage, but it wasn&#39;t going to advance his goal, and would alienate the people he could use to get at the culprit. &quot;We need to find whoever did this, and show him how exactly unentertained we are. Do we have any ideas on how to do that?&quot;</p>

            <p>Intern Kirill thought sourly as he looked down at his hand. The melted plastic and glass was fused to the bones in his right hand, and the remaining strings of charred flesh were starting to crack under the weight. He sighed, rolled his eyes, and stepped back through the SEP field in Gnat Alley and through the portal into PPC headquarters.<br><br>*POP*<br>Kirill quite suddenly felt different. One second he was a demon-worshipping sadomasochist with a coffee pot fused to the remains of his hand, and the next- he took stock. Still a demon-worshipping sadomasochist, he was sure, but the important part, the coffee pot part, had changed. His hand was suddenly whole again, with much lighter skin and fingers that were, in a word, more delicate than before. Ridiculously delicate. His entire body had a strange light feeling, as if he&#39;d lost a lot of weight or become much strong stronger. The only exception was an odd strain in his lower back, and the strange sensation of his hair touching his ears (unusual in itself) far higher than his ears normally went.<br><br>The intern ran to the nearest bathroom and was worried when he found it quite quickly. If the Narrative Laws of Comedy were still in force, then finding the bathroom was inherently funnier than not finding the bathroom. This worried him. He stepped through the door, took a deep breath, and looked in the mirror.<br><br>He was an elf. Skin tone had gone from olive to milk-white, hair had turned blonde and added about eleven inches and- oh. He glanced down, realizing that the change was to more than race and species.<br><br>For a second, Kirill froze. His species, his mana alignment, his race, even his sex had been suddenly stolen by some catastrophic event, seemingly calculated to tear away at every facet of his physical identity. He was saved from total catatonia only by a single light of comfort: he now had breasts. This was going to require some examination.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll be in my bunk,&quot; he said. No one was listening, but it seemed appropriate.</p>

            <p>&quot;I am <i>not</i> going out there.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What, worried that somebody will see you with no clothes on?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; Kay growled. &quot;I&#39;m worried that somebody will see me with no <i>skin</i> on and you know it.&quot; She folded her arm bones over her ribcage and did her best to glare at Emm, which was difficult without eyebrows or facial muscles.<br><br>&quot;Personally I think it suits you,&quot; Emm said cheerfully.

            <p>Kirill was still examining himself in the mirror when he realized that his clothes had changed as well. He&#39;d been so distracted by the physiological shifts that he&#39;d just noted the faint gleam of urple still coming from his armband, so he hadn&#39;t realized that his normal vest-and-pants had been replaced by a disgustingly elfy green and white tunic, cloak, and leggings. He leaned closer, then caught sight of the brooch that held his cloak on and recoiled.<br><br>It was the the sun-and-tree signet of the Slesnaya. Kirill gagged as a he fumbled with it, trying to tear it off his body without actually touching it. After a moment&#39;s panic, he managed to knock it away, sending the wooden brooch clattering into one of the sinks. It took several washes for his hand to feel clean.<br><br>This, Kirill decided, was the last straw. Turning him into an elf was degrading. Turning him into a woman actually offered a number of intriguing possibilities. But turning him into a Slesnaya? A hidebound, syrupy, tree-and-bug-hugging elf-girl? That was the last straw. Whoever did this was going to pay.<br><br>Still feeling wretched from the touch of the brooch, Kirill charged out of the bathroom and crashed headlong into the man with the flaming hair who was coming down the corridor.</p>

            <p>/Dammit,/ Kirill thought, /I meant to get him in the throat. My muscle memory&#39;s completely off./ He rolled to his feet, or tried to, but his different proportions and shifted center of mass led to him managing to get his head hooked on the inside of his knee. After several awkward seconds, he was finally able to stagger to his feet with very un-elfy grace.<br><br>&quot;Didn&#39;t mean to do that,&quot; he said to the man he&#39;d crashed into, &quot;I&#39;m not normally this tall.

Can you manage the finding if I make with the squealing?&quot; Kirill grinned broadly at the thought- the PPC HQ didn&#39;t have the kind of infrastructure or help that Rix Maadi did, but DoSAT was an endless source of entertainment. &quot;I&#39;ll need a spool of fishing wire, a ballpeen hammer, and a cordless drill.&quot;</p>

            <p>Lee woke up feeling oddly claustrophobic. She fought free of the blankets tangled around her-- of which there seemed to be more of then usual --and tumbled to the ground. She lay there for a moment, trying to figure out why she was so winded. Her perspective didn&#39;t seem quite right; everything was about a foot higher than it usually was. Her ears flattened against her head as she looked up to see the console looming over her.<br><br>Something was wrong. Very wrong.<br><br>Lee padded over to the full-length mirror that hung between two of the bookcases and stopped dead when she caught sight of herself. She swore sharply, passing through several languages before she got a  hold of herself. Right. Something had obviously happened while she and Ian were asleep, and-<br><br><i>Ian.</i> Lee&#39;s eyes grew wide. What if whatever had happened had affected her partner as well? Lee turned away from the mirror, her own troubles forgotten in the face of the possible harm inflicted on her partner. The ladder up to Ian&#39;s bunk gave her a bit of trouble, but eventually Lee made it up. After a little bit of panting to catch her breath, Lee made her way carefully along the length of Ian&#39;s body, using her enhanced senses to search out any possible problems. She didn&#39;t find any until she reached his head; more specifically, his hair. One small, spotted paw darted out to touch it, and the changed texture confirmed her suspicions. It was time for Ian to wake up.<br><br>---<br><br><i>Ian. Ian, wake up, Glod-damn it. This is important.</i><br><br>Ian grunted softly and tried to roll over. A sharp <i>Stop!</i> and the feel of claws digging into the skin on his chest made him pause in his motions. He felt a slight weight pressing down on his chest, which made him open his eyes. His bleary gaze focused on a pair of bright green eyes.<br><br>“&#39;Posa, get off,” he muttered, gently pushing at the cat sitting on his chest. She didn&#39;t budge.<br><br><i>I&#39;m not Mariposa, Ian,</i> the cat said, and Ian&#39;s sleep-fogged brain finally caught on to a few things that had been subconsciously bothering him. One, that the cat was speaking to him telepathically; Two, that the voice was Lee&#39;s; and three, that Lee now seemed to have regressed into the form of a mountain lion cub.<br><br>“What the hell happened to you?” <br><br><i>I have no idea,</i> Lee replied, carefully getting off of Ian and sitting next to him on the bed. <i>I woke up like this. I&#39;m not the only one who&#39;s changed, either. Take a look at your hair.</i><br><br>Feeling rather apprehensive, Ian followed Lee&#39;s advice and looked closely at his dreadlocks in the mirror after getting out of bed. Lee followed after him, taking a more circuitous route to the floor, but getting there safely all the same.<br><br>“I have yarn for hair?!” Ian spluttered, running his hands over his altered hair. “I look like I&#39;m wearing a Glodawful wig!”<br><br><i>I&#39;m a <b>kitten</b>,</i> Lee said in her best GlaDOS impression. With an agile leap, Lee hopped up onto a shelf and then onto the nearest of Ian&#39;s shoulders. <i>Much better,</i> she said, carefully balancing herself in a sitting position, her claws gently latching into the fabric of his shirt.<i> At least this way I&#39;m not liable to be stepped on. </i><br><br>“Comfortable?” Ian asked dryly.<br><br><i>Yes,</i> Lee replied, purring a bit. <i>Let&#39;s go and see if anyone else has been affected, or, at the very least, know what&#39;s going on.</i><br><br>“Good plan.”<br><br>With that, the two DMS agents left their RC and headed out into the labyrinthine halls of HQ.<br><br>((I got a little wordy with my reply. Sorry about that. Also, <a href="http://education.boisestate.edu/compass/kidscompass/Imagesanimals/Cougar/kitten_1-159028_corel_copy.jpg">this</a> is what Lee currently looks like. *grin*))</p>

Get out here right now!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mum, are you sure it was &#39;er?&quot; asked Molly, who was leaning on Agent Skyfire as if about to fall over.

            <p>A high pitched yell soon attracted teh four&#39;s attention. It sounded like a very small person was yelling to someone.<br>&quot;Drake... left left... you silly fox.&quot;<br>A cross sounding yip answered the voice.<br>&quot;Don&#39;t give me that . Now Right!&quot;<br>A CAF fox came into view, heading for them. On top of the fox, wrapped in a small sheet of blanket was Naomi. She was only 5 inches high, having been shrunk considerably.<br>&quot;WHOA STOP!!&quot; she screamed as she spotted them, and pulled on the CAF&#39;s ears hard from her place on its head. <br>The fox slammed hard into Stormsong&#39;s ankle, sending naomi into Stormsong&#39;s ankle. She slowly slid down onto the floor.<br>&quot;Sorry about that Stormsong. Drake&#39;s brakes need adjusting. Also, could someone pick me up please!&quot; she yelled out, not wanting to get stepped on.<br>&quot;Anyone know what the ERU is going on? I have an idea, but I doubt that&#39;s it.&quot;<br>she admitted, thinking back to the incident earlier. After all those flowers had gotten shredded then burned in that &#39;furnace&#39;.<br>she looked at Sky then had to stifle a laugh.<br>&quot;Oh.. I see it happened to you too.&quot;</p>

            <p>Heartrending wails echoed through the halls, setting Kestrel&#39;s already short temper dangerously close to the edge. The ferret glared down at her chest, the offending breasts on which were still there and giving no sign of disappearing anytime soon. &quot;Can&#39;t yew shurrim up, Caleb? &#39;Tis gettin&#39; on me bloody nerves.&quot; Artie clung to her back, muttering miserably in Parseltongue.<br><br>Caleb glared at her murderously, seeming to sparkly even brighter as he did so. &quot;Kestrel, Jack now has claws that are longer than most rulers. You shut him up.&quot;<br><br>The Hunter-turned-Witch in question simply blubbered unintelligibly as she trailed behind Caleb.<br><br>&quot;I know, Jack,&quot; Caleb muttered. &quot;I think Artie got the sweeter deal. Parseltongue&#39;s better than sparkling. Or boobs where there shouldn&#39;t be.&quot;<br><br>At that moment, Kestrel spotted the figures up ahead. &quot;Oi, is that Agent Stormsong an&#39; Skyfire an&#39; their kids? An&#39;... an&#39; a fox an&#39; a liddle person. Who is that?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Technically I do look like a Yiffstar character, just a very specific type,&quot; said Foxglove sulkily. She opened the door, revealing that she was wearing Laburnum&#39;s dressing gown. Laburnum was a big girl and tended to wear clothes made for someone even bigger, which was fortunate; the dressing gown just about fit Foxglove now, as her personal transformation had caused her to roughly double in bulk.<br><br>&quot;Looks like I gained in pounds what my partner lost in IQ points ...&quot; she grumbled, then looked up and blinked at Skyfire, Kestrel, Caleb, and Jack(ie). &quot;Wow. Okay, yeah, yours are much worse.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you so much,&quot; said Skyfire. &quot;So am I to assume you didn&#39;t actually have anything to do with this?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hell no!&quot; Foxglove snapped. &quot;If I had, I wouldn&#39;t have done this to myself! And frankly Laburnum&#39;s dangerous enough when she&#39;s not hyperactive, so I wouldn&#39;t have done that either.&quot; She peered out into the corridor, where Stormsong had just about managed to get the two little boys under control. &quot;How&#39;d you get away with it, Stormy? Nothing seems to have happened to you.&quot;<br><br>Stormsong mouthed something.<br><br>&quot;What?&quot;<br><br>Stormsong&#39;s face contorted as if he was yelling. All that happened was a thin wheezing noise emitted from his throat.<br><br>&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Okay.. this seems familiar, but nah, can&#39;t be that. &quot;<br>She bapped drake on the nose and climbed up onto him, then guided him into the room.<br>&quot;THis is weird of course.

But it seems to vary.&quot;<br>She closed her eyes at Caleb.<br>&quot;Say... sparkly boy..&quot; she said iritably, &quot;Can you turn down the bling?&quot; she snapped out. She was being annoyed. Being onyl 5 inches high was really getting to her.

Say, Laburnum, reminds me of someone familiar.&quot;<br>Suddenyl drake yipped and started prancing around. Naomi fell off, but then snapped her fingers.<br>&quot;Oh.. right.

            <p>Foxglove pointed back into the RC. &quot;Marile seems to have escaped. She&#39;s been in her tank all day, whatever this is must be spread by touch, or maybe airborne.

            <p>I&#39;ve never played either the Call of Cthulhu RPG nor the Delta Green addendum (actually, tabletop RPG&#39;s are a foreign country for me entirely) but, having been introduced to the concept by the Ow My Sanity webcomic... I was thinking about how to take the typical &quot;Last Unicorn&quot; type aformenioned immortal creature and have it included as a part of the sanity-sucking Mythos universe while not changing much of it&#39;s existing nature.<br><br>Not that I want to introduce incorruptible pure-pureness into the Mythos, but that I wonder how experiencing such a creature could shave off some SAN points.<br><br>I was thinking... typical Unicorn (or similarly shaped energy-based eldritch wossname) with Blue-and-Orange Morality, mildly emphatic and telepathic... but it just doesn&#39;t like when people near it are afraid or sad or angry. These feelings manifest as something like... well, analagous to the feeling of a sunflower seed shell stuck between the teeth.  So, it takes in runaways and orphans and includes them in it&#39;s wild forest.  <br><br>They become feral children living in a spring-time paradise, with the older ones pairing off and having feral babies, free of strife or tears or sorrow while providing an entertaining spectatre sport to their keeper was they do and experience all the other things a unicorn can&#39;t do (liek savage. <br><br>But then, some of the fosterlings become ambitious and begin kidnapping runaways or battered children to include in their woods.  Now, investigators investigate and have to decide whether to treat this in a scorched earth, quarantine-type way... or whether they can negotiate with this thing into remaining benign and releasing it&#39;s current fosterlings.  <br><br>What if the negotiator ends up under the effects of the creatures glamour in more ways than one... wondering if there are more non-human allies out there, becomes slightly sympathetic to some of the less blood-curdling horrors and the less murderous cults they encounter... and then there&#39;s the Eye Thing.<br><br>When you look into his eyes, you no longer see yourself, but the only image of a lilac wood in the spring. <br><br>It&#39;s rough and half-coherent, but I hope to get some ideas (even if they are only flames).</p>

            <p>Yeah. I take it from the last bit you&#39;re looking for suggestions, so I&#39;ll just work with that.<br><br>-The idea of the corrupting influence of the unicorn&#39;s power is good. I was going to say &quot;no, this can never work&quot; but saying that it&#39;s beauty and so on and suchlike a really a form of insidious mind control is very appropriate to the universe. It&#39;s less overt than almost everything else, but cosmic horror is under no obligation to be subtle.<br><br>-Sanity would take a hit from encountering it for two reasons. First, the contrast with reality: the incorruptible pure pureness that the unicorn embodies is as alien to normal human existence as any (other) eldritch abomination. Second, this thing wrecks your will. Given the nature of the CoC universe, once it sinks it&#39;s claws into you, that&#39;s a chunk of your self-determination you ain&#39;t getting back. Breaking away from it would probably induce profound feelings of loss and despair- if you&#39;ve ever seen Angel, think what happened when people got severed from Jasmine, only make it permanent.<br><br>-The community you&#39;ve outlined would have a growth rate that&#39;s far too high to be practical. Living in an edenic paradise with no birth control and minimal inhibitions would have the birth rate sky-high even without abductions. Also, frankly, there aren&#39;t enough downsides; considering what an absolute sea of frack living in the CoC universe is, people giving up their wills to this *thing* in exchange for corporeal paradise seems pretty reasonable. I&#39;d expand the centrality of the unicorn in the whole thing. If exposure to it damages your mind, then if any of it&#39;s wild children become mentally separated from it, they should die.<br><br>-You could also make it a honey pot. According to folklore, unicorns only have an affinity for virgins. This could make the unicorn into something fairly nightmarish: it draws in children who are abused, hurt, and so on, raises them in eternal spring, slowly devouring their minds with it&#39;s own. Then, when they lose their virginity (which they have no reason not to do) it withdraws, leaving them lobotomized or dead.<br><br>Sorry, that rambled a bit. Just a few thoughts.</p>

            <p>And with fewer spelling mistakes.<br><br>I kind of agree... though I should have said that this is actually background story for a character in a Mythos fic I&#39;m doing (based on two characters I had mapped out for that Star Destroyer thing).  It&#39;s mythos(ish), there are weird cults and horrible monsters, there are investigators... but there&#39;s also backstabbing, paranoia and a suspicion that there may be more layers of grey than we feel comfortable with.  Some &quot;Lovecraft Lite&quot;, some &quot;Did you Have Tea with Cthulhu&quot;, some &quot;Knight Templar&quot;... and probably some Nyarlahotep in there as well, the jerk.<br><br>Yes, A troper I am.<br><br>I like the idea of the Unicorn abandoning these kids once they try to breed or, more likely, become hormornal and violent and generally a practical and empathic pain for the Unicorn.  Abandoning these hormone factories to their deaths (&#39;oh, they were so cute and innocent when you got them, but look at them NOW!&#39;) would appear to the aformentioned affected investigator to be more like abandoning a dog by the side of the road.  Death through neglect...<br><br>So breeding would be out and I could understand how kidnappings could come about. The mind absorbtion could even be a twisted way of the Unicorn training it&#39;s &#39;pets&#39; so to avoid the pain of them fighting with each other. <br><br>But not too much control, for the joy in watching spontaneous cuteness could be dimmed... I think.<br><br>In fact, seeing it as nothing but a gracile horse could be a sort of defense mechanism either on the part of mankind or the Unicorn itself.<br><br>The tip off could even come through the capture of a local (for Essex County Mass) practitioner of the black arts, accused of killing children for body parts to use in their magic.  He or She denies the charge of murder, but reveals that they merely scavenge the leftovers from when this thing tires of it&#39;s pets.  The twist is that this thing hates the more traditional cults and their masters... a turf war or merely a way a dog owner hates coyotes.<br><br>Then the question is... is this thing worth driving off or destroying, can you destroy it, can you negotiate with it?<br><br>Or do you merely have to find a way to live with it?<br><br>As for the negotiatior (who acted as a friendly), the doubt is actually a combination of the effects of the glamour and the fear of getting the (9mm) Parabellum Pension Plan because the cowboy portion of the federal investigators thought he was corrupted.  The eyes were just the effects of the background magic.<br><br>50 years later, he&#39;s an Anthropology Prof who spends half his time teaching and the other half preparing back-up plans for if they come to finally kill him.<br><br>Now THAT&#39;S rambling!</p>

            <p>I found formatting manually a little bit time consuming, so I made a quick template to help save a little time. I saved it as a .dotx template, it should work with Word 2007. I haven&#39;t figured out how (or even if it&#39;s possible) to get the styles to carry over to OpenOffice. Once I get the other computer with OpenOffice back up and running I&#39;ll see about making another version in OpenOffice.<br><br>Here&#39;s a download link to it. Lemme know if it looks O.K on your computer, and if not, I&#39;ll see if I can fix it up or use an earlier version of the styles. <br><br><a href="http://delta-mike-lima.webs.com/info/PPC_Format.dotx"><a href="http://delta-mike-lima.webs.com/info/PPC_Format.dotx">http://delta-mike-lima.webs.com/info/PPC_Format.dotx</a></a></p>

            <p>I never found formatting missions time consuming. But then, I only use plain text and press ctrl+i before I paste in a clip from the badfic and press it again after.<br><br>I&#39;m curious what a mission using your template would look like.

            <p>You seem to have constructed this template with only one specific presentation framework in mind. That is, you fail to take into account that some people might not be posting their missions to a site that would allow for such formatting. I know quite a few people (myself included) use Facebook to post their missions. That usually involves some messing around with html codes in order to indicate things like italics or bolding or what have you. The template does not account for things like that.<br><br>I should also point out that I am not a fan of applying templates to something like missions. That&#39;s fine for the wiki, but missions are rather more personal than wiki pages. I do not like the idea of having to adjust my style to fit the template. I know, I know! There&#39;s nothing that says this would be mandatory. The idea still makes me uncomfortable. I don&#39;t want to see every mission with the same exact format! I want to see the individual quirks that each writer possesses!</p>

            <p>One thing that this template addresses is how to format passages of badfic in missions for readability.

            <p>Seriously, though, a template is a useful tool, not a prerequisite. I don&#39;t think anybody ever in the world thought that it would actually be required. An author&#39;s format is quite individual and a style choice just like anything else. Sure, there are standard formats, and of course it has to be readable and pleasing to the eye; but within those guidelines there&#39;s still plenty of room for creativity. Times New Roman looks different from Courier or Arial. There&#39;s indenting versus leaving space between paragraphs versus both. Different styles of English use different punctuation conventions. It really just has to be readable, consistent, and grammatical. (Though even the rules of grammar can be occasionally broken for the sake of style.)</p>

            <p>I know someone who is in bad need of editing for a novel she wants to get published, and I&#39;m not up for it right now, so I thought possibly one of you would be.  English is her second language, and she has some trouble with it.  I expect the problems to be about grammar, punctuation, and typos she doesn&#39;t catch, so it sounds perfect for a PPCer.  The novel is a memoir-ish story about a woman trying to make a family and fit into American suburban life after coming to the US as a teenager.  If my memory serves, it&#39;s 90,000 words, which is long, so I don&#39;t blame you if it&#39;s too much.  She seems like a nice person, and it&#39;s really important to her to improve her book, so I think she&#39;d be easy to work with.</p>

            <p>I take it that the author herself also came to the US as a teen, so this book would be a &quot;How I tried to live the American dream&quot; sort of thing?<br><br>I don&#39;t know whether there is a market for that in the US (I don&#39;t have any idea what the market for non-fiction is like in the US, i.e. what kind of books sell.), but if she wants to publish in any other way than self-publish, she has to think about who wants to buy such a book. Many publishers / agents request that you also say something about the possible market in the cover letter. By the way: want to buy is not the same group of people as &quot;need to read&quot;. I&#39;ve seen several application letters that pointed out who needed to read the book. (Usually everyone with a certain prejudice. Funny enough, those are the people least likely to actually buy the book.)<br><br>Her market could be people who want to know how immigrants become successful (or not). That may just be other immigrants and the odd sociologist studying the subject and looking for narrative experience. <br><br>90,000 isn&#39;t long for a novel. It would come out at about 260-280 pages. I&#39;m sure she would be able to find a good editor if she was willing to pay for one. (She should look for one that also knows her native language, so the editor isn&#39;t too puzzled by some of the mistakes made.)</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m not going to judge what is and isn&#39;t going to sell.  But she&#39;s marketing it as fiction.

            <p>Here are as many as I can think of, at the moment:<br><br>1. Is &quot;not having a disclaimer&quot; a charge, just bad form, or something not to worry about?<br><br>2. There&#39;s a large, uncanonical location that needs destroying in the fic I&#39;m sporking (a town). What&#39;s the procedure for bringing DOGA in? Should my agents just try to deal with it themselves?<br><br>3. How serious a space-time distortion/reality disruption is creating/replacing a canon town with an uncanon one? In this case, do my agents need to worry about the fic collapsing (it takes place over multiple days)?<br><br>For reference, the replacement town in question is &quot;Kohana&quot; (a misspelling of &quot;Konoha&quot; from the Naruto continuum) and it bears almost no resemblance to the original. Konoha looks like a traditional Japanese village. Kohana has a large mall. Enough said.</p>

            <p>Sorry, but I think it&#39;s very important to have a disclaimer - both from a legal point of view (and believe me, you DON&#39;T want to fall afoul of that) and just out of respect for the original author. But not having one isn&#39;t a charge as far as I know.<br><br>Anyway, to the other questions: <br><br>2. It all depends on the fic and the way you and your agents handle it - which is to say, you can pretty much decide for yourself. If you want to bring DoGA in and go pyro with flamethrowers, in this case you can - a town is certainly big enough (you couldn&#39;t do so for little things). But if you don&#39;t want to, then you can decide that killing the Sue or exorcising the canons (or whatever) is enough to loosen the author&#39;s grip on the world and let it fade back into normal on its own.<br><br>3. Like the above, you can pretty much decide this one for yourself - if you want such a thing to happen, and can justify it, go ahead, but you don&#39;t have to. Just make sure not to turn it into an Emergency-like drama. The fic probably won&#39;t collapse, though - like Elemarth says, similar things have happened. The only time I recall a fic actually collapsing was in TOS when the author deleted it.<br><br>Hope that helps!</p>

            <p>There seem to be two camps on the disclaimer front: those who think it&#39;s absolutely necessary, and those who think it is rubbish. I&#39;m closer to the latter camp. I seriously doubt a disclaimer is going to give you any kind of legal protection. When the rights owners want to sue, they sue, regardless of whether you have put up a disclaimer stating you don&#39;t own the stuff. They&#39;re very real (and legally sound) argument will be: well, if you don&#39;t own it, why are you putting it up on the Internet?<br><br>Acknowledging the original author can be done in the author&#39;s note. It doesn&#39;t need to have the rather meaningless word &quot;disclaimer&quot; tacked to it.<br><br>----<br><br>As for the misspelt town. Wouldn&#39;t that be just another mini (or other beasty) rather than an uncanonical town? <br><br>I&#39;ve missioned two fics where the author consistently misspelt one of the characters&#39; names and wrote them OOC to boot. But in neither case did I treat this character as an OC or character replacement.<br><br>On the other hand, burning down a town is probably more fun. Just, charging with creating an uncanonical town implies that the canonical town is still around somewhere.</p>

            <p>My method depends on where it&#39;s published. If the story is published on a site such as fanfiction.net, it&#39;s pretty understood by all that it&#39;s fanfiction and the writer doesn&#39;t own the world or characters described in the work. The same goes with items in the &#39;fanfiction&#39; section of Deviantart.<br><br>If the writer posts it on Livejournal or some other place, it is good form to at least include a note that it is fanfiction and the writer doesn&#39;t claim to own the characters or world depicted... if not for a lawyer&#39;s convenience, but for readers who may go to the journal for other things, not expecting fanfiction.<br><br>(Of course, if it is a fanfiction journal, you can get away with probably one &#39;disclaimer&#39; for the whole journal, to remove confusion.)<br><br>Usually if I include a disclaimer, it is for multiple chapter stories (not one-shots) and is only on the first chapter of the work. And even then it&#39;s short, more like a thank-you to the creators of the original work than a &#39;ME NO OWN U NO SUE&#39;<br><br>I do include disclaimers citing fair use for PPC missions, though, because I am borrowing multiple things (The PPC, the original work, the badfic, all at once), for use in parody... and if somebody finds the missions they have a real chance of being mad about them.<br><br>I mean, what ordinary reader would ever get mad enough at a fanfic in order to sue... and what creator would try and take down EVERY BIT OF FANFICTION of their stuff with a lawsuit?<br><br>Even more ludicrous are the numerous high school AU stories that have nothing to do with the plot OR real characters, yet are tagged with &#39;I DON&#39;T OWN X I JUST USE IT!!!&#39;<br><br>If they stripped and replaced the names, I am not sure anybody would notice or care that that kind of story was fanfiction at all.

            <p>A disclaimer should say that you don&#39;t own the world, not that you don&#39;t own the story. And if done correctly, you can use your disclaimer to help with a Fair Use defense should you be sued.

            <p>At first, I thought it should be a mini. However, the town that the fic takes place ends up bearing little to no resemblance to the canon location it purports to be. The places that exist in canon are incredibly distorted (a small apartment turns into a mansion with a swimming pool) and lots of other buildings are added in that don&#39;t make any sense (the aforementioned mall). I haven&#39;t figured out where the canonical town would be, but there are some truly massive plotholes...<br><br>Plus, as you say, burning down a town is more fun.</p>

            <p>But on the other hand, I&#39;ve always considered the disclaimer to be more about respect than legality. Yes, it&#39;s something of a security blanket concerning rights to the canon, but it&#39;s more a gesture of homage, I think. That might sound stupid if the story is, for example, a Redwall or something; everyone knows you don&#39;t own Martin and his Abbey. But consider, for example, an LotR &#39;fic where the author goes into detail about Glorfindel&#39;s memories of his greatest deeds, over the campfire to Legolas and Gimli. You can easily see a fan of the movies who doesn&#39;t know the books going &quot;Oh man, Glorfindel is the coolest character!&quot; <s>And they&#39;d be right</s>! The problem is, he&#39;s Tolkien&#39;s character, not the author&#39;s. It also comes in handy for crossovers, or stories that borrow ideas. For example, borrowing Death from Discworld in another story. Mentioning that he belongs to Terry Pratchett is helpful-- and who knows? Maybe Discworld has just gained a new fan!<br><br>But overall, I think it&#39;s correct that we can&#39;t really charge for or against it. Unless the author&#39;s note is actually claiming they <i>do</i> own canon characters<s>, or needlessly whiny about how they don&#39;t</s>, it&#39;s not an issue either way.</p>

            <p>While some disclaimers are annoying and whiny (or simply go on and on forever), I usually view them as being more about respect for the author than anything else. You&#39;re giving credit where credit is due rather than dispelling any misguided notion that you own and/or profit from the fic. As for charging, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. It seems like the only grounds for a disclaimer-related charge would be if there were sufficient other charges to warrant killing the fic and if the disclaimer annoyed the hell out of the agents (&quot;annoying PPC agents&quot;).</p>

            <p>The disclaimer, to me, is a way of giving credit to the author who invented the world you are using for your story. Not to give credit for a major thing like that is just as bad as--probably worse than--not giving credit to people like beta readers or people who helped with format or html code.

            <p>I know you all have gotten scarred by badfic at some point in life. By scarred I mean when you feel as if even something like Bleeprin may not work to get the mental image given by a certain badfic out of your head. (Fics like C*l*br**n, ChibiUsa&#39;s Seventh Birthday, and other legendary or just really bad badfics all tend to do this.) After reading several badfics, most of them involving bad slash, I actually felt the need to scream.<br><br>So, as to not drag this post needlessly on and on, I have a question for you all- what is/are the thing(s) you do to help clear and/or heal your mind after reading such atrocious pieces of fanfiction? Do you dance? Sing? Watch movies? Write poetry? Write missions? (Well, of course people do the last one, but I hope you&#39;re catching my drift.) <br><br>My tactic- listening to music after reading, especially songs that are upbeat, happy, pretty innocent and are ones that I love a whole ton. My favorite at the moment is the non-stop version of Maru Kaite Chikyuu (from the Hetalia series). By the time Chibitalia&#39;s part is playing I&#39;m pretty distracted from morbid thoughts. (Singing to said song also helps a lot.)</p>

            <p>It really depends on the badfic. Sometimes I like to read/watch the canon it was based on after I&#39;m done reading it, but other times that makes the horror worse. In that case, I usually turn to other canons. Listening to Heart of Courage helps.<br><br>If I&#39;m trying to get through a really terrible badfic, it sometimes helps to make an orderly, bullet-pointed charge list, organized by chapter if necessary. The illusion that I can do something about whatever travesties are being perpetrated by the fic helps out.<br><br>The first line of defense, of course, is my normal reaction to extreme pain: hysterical laughter.</p>

            <p>My solution is to keep reading, but to read something else if the badfic is that bad. Badfics that aren&#39;t as scarring can provide a lot to laugh at. And sometimes I just retreat to good fanfics or read a real book.</p>

            <p>By which I mean, finding something in the bad fic to laugh at. Mentally riffing it as you go helps prevent harm from a lot of horrors, if you can summon the presence of mind (doesn&#39;t work on all fics, though, but it&#39;s worth a try).</p>

            <p>Not taking the fic seriously helps, too. The Fic That Has Been Devowelled didn&#39;t bother me terribly much, because I was not able to take it seriously as a story. <br><br>One of the stories that I did a mission on with Kelok and Unger was probably the worst for me. It was like it kept getting worse the more I had to focus on it to get the charges.  At the surface level the fic was written mechanically well. It is much harder to not take those seriously as a story. I finally realized it was a laugh or cry situation, and found something that the agents could do to relieve some tension. It was great for me, slightly more painful for the agents.</p>

            <p>Seriously, that was just ow. But most badfics are really just either funny or downright baffling to me, much as my agents scream about them. &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; wasn&#39;t funny because the author seems to actually believe the creepy things he writes, but most things can be made funny with a little thought.</p>

            <p>Read good fanfiction. Like, legendary-status fanfiction. I actually read C*l*br**n the whole way through (seemed like a good idea at the time) and to cheer myself up I dove into an archive of awesome Good Omens fanfiction. Recently I broke my brain over Forbiden Fruit: The tempation of Edward Cullen, and revived after reading most of the contents on the Sherlock Fanfic Recommendations page on TV Tropes.<br><br>Or immerse myself in canon! I read Tamora Pierce or Redwall, or I watch Sherlock and NCIS and Firefly and it makes me happy.</p>

            <p>That was fun!  I like your agents&#39; personalities.  One thing you might want to keep in mind for future missions: it&#39;s usually easier to read when the parts quoted from the badfic look different from the parts you wrote--italicized, underlined, whatever.</p>

            <p>OK, so I wrote the first chapter of a fanfic, my first fanfic I think might be worth putting online, and I&#39;m not sure whether to upload it to anywhere or not. I could upload it to my LiveJournal, but nobody reads it, so it&#39;d be pointless. I&#39;ve been considering uploading it to the Pit, but it&#39;s a crack!fic that I think might get some  negative feedback. I just want to know, what do you guys think?</p>

Still, you&#39;ll never get there if you don&#39;t try. Might I suggest something? Find yourself a nice, honest beta whose opinion you trust, and when they say it&#39;s good enough to post, post it.

            <p>Hey everybody, so this is a nice bundle of three missions and two interludes. One mission and Interlude co-written with Miah, and another mission and co-write with HerrWozzeck. And A mission I wrote by myself. By far, I prefer co-writing, but some things have to be done yourself.<br><br>So, a tonne of thanks go out to both Herr and Miah for being awesome and letting me write with them. I plan on doing more stuff with Miah in the future for sure, and Herr if he feels up to it.<br><br>Taking place first, in chronological order of these fics, is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vZ9cHvX6Q-lNk1OGfbNxw_l8u3Z08JebExGCeb3rtho/edit?hl=en_US"> Training Mission 1: Crossover Training </a>. This one takes place as the first mission with Cadmar. For Miah it takes place after the glitterfic where they adopted the kids, and before the deletion crossover.<br><br>Taking place shortly after Eva, is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15af7DMejPsGlnfm6jYh1EdJVEcVsyT7FOsYySjirjAA/edit?hl=en_US"> Mission </a> I wrote myself. It’s short, but for a fic that made me angry.<br><br>Next up is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aQ2u08Ks2nwD-Sdfe2t02Mna10F_7u6dLaIJzlnzG8s/edit?hl=en_US"> Dirty Rotten Cowards </a>, a co-write with HerrWozzeck. It takes place a bit after Eva does.<br><br>After that is  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yJmkDB1z1DetzSFK-A_1MXrEJFd9gmaI6Ufv7KBiKgQ/edit?hl=en_US&amp;pli=1"> Relationship Upgrade </a>, an interlude taking place right after the mission with Herr.<br><br>The last is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PA1OekrxGvRgYnshbo_7ySfspFijgoYcB4icNNnz3qs/edit?hl=en_US"> Truth or Dare </a>, which is a co-write with Miah.  It takes place some time after the interlude with Herr. Yes, I am not giving dates, I like my timeline being a bit loose for creative room.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s certainly &quot;Legendary&quot;, but I don&#39;t think it qualifies as a badfic. It&#39;s decently written, and has very few plot-holes, and Pinkie acts surprisingly in-character (Which makes it oh so much worse). </p>

            <p>... and it certainly accomplished the objective of being creepy and upsetting a lot of people. The quality of the actual story is debateable. For the record, I do actually like the grimdark stuff, but random violence is only my thing when I think the character suffering the random violence has it coming, so while Cupcakes didn&#39;t bother me, I thought it was kind of meh.<br><br>(If you want less violent and more plotty grimdark, the Pony Psychology Series is good.)</p>

            <p>I think Cupcakes is a gore-version of the TYPE of legendary badfic as C*l*br**n. Both of them take a swan dive off of a canonical event (Cupcakes has the end of Party of One, C*l*br**n has the fact that Celebrian was attacked by orcs once) and into unimaginable disgusting depths.<br><br>I am almost 100 percent positive that Cupcakes is trollfic as C*l*br**n is.<br><br>Is it Legendary? I think so. At least in the MLP:FiM community. It&#39;s perhaps the most talked about fanfic there... similar to how My Immortal is frequently discussed. It has the fandom awareness to mark it Legendary.</p>

            <p>Depends. Generally, the defining trait of a Legendary Badfic is that a huge number of people know about it - hence &#39;legendary&#39;.
