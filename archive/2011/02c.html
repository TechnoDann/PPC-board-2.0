            <p>Is recruiting characters that are canonically dead allowed, or do they have to be carbon copies like Team Phoenix. Just wondering, because I have an idea and I would rather preemptively stomp it to death than go through with it and then be shot down.</p>

            <p>To kind of perpetuate discussion about this topic (I think it&#39;s interesting) I kind of have to say that I think it&#39;s about importance.<br><br>PPC Agents go into badfic looking to fix a huge disruption of canon. Which includes who is alive and who is dead. So is it really right to then go double-standard and recruit somebody who ought to be dead by their canon?<br><br>Though, canon to me has partially to do with importance. Because of canon events, and because they&#39;re <i>important</i> the plot of that canon happens. So this is why Agents are allowed to be would-be background characters or extras snatched from various continua. You can snatch Doomed Orc Number 7 and give him a name and personality (if he&#39;s cooperative, and willing to join the PPC) but you can&#39;t snatch Boromir. Anymore. As was said before, collaborative efforts will have blips.<br><br>It&#39;s important to the canon that Boromir dies. But Random Doomed Orc Number 7 is not important-- thus that can be an Agent Origin. </p>

            <p>There may be exceptions, but I think that&#39;s the basic rule of thumb you&#39;re talking about. If a character has a name, they have an important role to fill, even if it&#39;s relatively minor compared to the main characters. A name means their author took the time to give it to them, which is a signal to the audience to pay attention. Kinda like if your teacher bothers to write something on the blackboard. It means that no one else would have done the same, and it would have changed the story--for instance, if Sam loved &quot;Primrose Bracegirdle&quot; instead of Rosie Cotton, would the Scouring of the Shire have gone so well, without Rosie&#39;s brothers helping out? And would she be kind and understanding about Frodo? Chances are, not so much.<br><br>On the other hand, any well-developed world has lots and lots of people in it. They don&#39;t all have names (not that we find out, anyway). Heck, the vast majority don&#39;t even appear as a faceless extra, because they&#39;re off doing whatever it is that regular folks do in their world. Those types are absolutely fair game.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who is a big proponent of the importance of names, in writing and the real world.</p>

            <p>I think that badfic clones of canons are the ones to be recruited, dead canonicals can do confusion.<br><br>For example, in Ace Combat 5 fics isn&#39;t a good idea to recruit a saved-by-Sue Chopper, since he should canonically die in the mission Journey Home. However, recruiting a Kei Nagase (Edge) in a fic not set in a specific game should be fine - there&#39;s at least THREE of them in AC canon, so it can easily be a clone and not a misplaced canonical Nagase.<br><br>Confused? Well, it&#39;s an inside shout out made by Namco. You have a Kei Nagase as your wingman in AC 2 (set in 1998) and 5 (2010), a plane you have to escort in 4 (2005) is piloted by a flight attendant named Nagase, and there is another Kei Nagase that joins Ouroboros in 3 (2045). And a character in Ridge Racer is called Reiko Nagase and is AC2 Nagase&#39;s sister. So, we have at least three Kei Nagase or Edge is a time lord.</p>

            <p>Also, there&#39;s the possibility of an in-Canon afterlife - in Lord of the Rings, at least, there&#39;s very definitely stuff that happens after death, and you&#39;d be yanking the canons out of that.</p>

            <p>I think that recruiting dead canon characters is something that should not be allowed.  It has always seemed to me that recruiting such a character is akin to something a Suethor would do.  They don&#39;t like that the character is dead so they resurrect them to be in their stories.  It breaks that character&#39;s personal canon.<br><br>I am not saying that you could not pull it off and write it well; you very probably could.

            <p>... the canons are still needed for their story. Even the dead ones. I like the idea as it was proposed in the Thursday Next novels, that canon characters continuously act out the story. If you take a canon away from that, the story will have a hole in it &#39;cause they can&#39;t play their part anymore. (Also it means canons aren&#39;t really dead; every reread already resurrects them.)<br><br>Anyway, that&#39;s the idea I have for a Thursday Next fanfic where I accidentally set Mr Rochester free in modern day London.</p>

            <p>I think the ideas you had were quite good, but the mission itself felt rushed to me, especially since the intro is about a third of the story (and felt like more to me, since the first badfic quote is halfway in). I think you could have safely spent more time on the fic and developed how things fell apart more fully, and maybe included some of the dumb stuff you ended up leaving out, too.<br><br>Seconding the Henry VIII joke needing to come sooner, too. I was surprised to see no comment on that ridiculous name when it first appeared.<br><br>Like I said, though, what is there is good. Getting caught in the rain was a nice touch--it&#39;s often too easy to avoid that sort of thing, what with the Words to give warning if a writer bothers to include adverse weather in the story.<br><br>I am glad you rescued Nasalos. Hopefully he&#39;ll be happy. Maybe he can hook up with Ithalond and Mithiriel for support at some point. Also, Dayn is fun. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;d have had her myself had I not been trying to keep off the Sues. Eeeugh... I mean, was this supposed to be some sort of crossover, or just utter fail?

            <p>I kinda dropped the ball there, yeah. I wanted to do the joke, realised I&#39;d forgotten to mention that elf before, so I just kinda shoved him into the spotlight a few paragraphs before. And yeah, the cause of the damage was mainly the Suethor knowing the canon but making no attempt to stick to it; she might as well have written something original.</p>

It would be in HQ&#39;s best interests to bring them back, but after &quot;Subjugation&quot; drove them into hiding, they&#39;re... less than willing to return. (This is probably a pretty minor conflict in relation to the PPC as a whole, considering all the crazy stuff that goes on around here.

            <p>If you intend to have them brought back to HQ eventually, then it is a good idea.  If you intend to have them run around evading HQ and the DIA forever, then it makes no sense to have it in the PPC.<br><br>I will note that there are other agents that went rogue after taking on &quot;Subjugation&quot;.  Two of them were guilt-tripped back to HQ at the end of <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999/04tds.html">this mission.</a><br><br>Maybe you could write a new agent pair that is tasked with bringing them in?

            <p>I&#39;m personally of the opinion anything <i>can</i> be done well, though you might have to be a bit careful. I seem to be alone in feeling that way, but it could be interesting in my opinion. All depends on how you write it. I know I&#39;ve been looking into writing stuff with the DIA, who would probably be looking into bringing them back; might or might not tie into things, but if there&#39;s something there I thought it could be left in the open as a possibility.</p>

            <p>In my mind, the PPC is more effective than vigilante justice not because they are somehow &#39;better&#39; at killing Sues, but because they are more organized and have more rules as to what to leave alone. <br><br>Like, the agent Aster Corbett was a rampaging vigilante before an Intelligence agent found her. She not only eliminated Mary Sues (In incredibly unfair, canon-disturbing ways) but every Original Character and Self Insert in her path because she was flamethrower-crazy and hated them because she was one.<br><br>Not only that, but killing Mary Sues and solving other problems in ways that aren&#39;t controlled to protect canon may be bad for canon over-all-- leaving behind a huge mess that a vigilante doesn&#39;t have the manpower or equipment to clean up. Not to mention the concept of &quot;He who fights monsters...&quot; and that vigilantes are in constant danger of being contaminated by glitter and becoming Mary Sues themselves.<br><br>It may be counter-intuitive, but having HQ to back agents up may  make them <i>saner.</i> Badfic is great and vast and hopelessly out of control. Sure, being beeped at by a console and called to duty is annoying, but at least Agents aren&#39;t literally submerged in badfic day in and day out.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t have an Encyclopedic knowledge of too many fandoms, but I have a pretty good memory for detail (and I do have the internet at my fingertips!) along with fingers in alot of fandoms. <br><br>On a whim, my friend asked me to look up some ridiculous Crosswovers, upon which I stumbled upon which I found this crossover between Trigun and House M.D.:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/Trigun_and_House_M_D_Crossovers/616/1968/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/Trigun_and_House_M_D_Crossovers/616/1968/">http://www.fanfiction.net/Trigun_and_House_M_D_Crossovers/616/1968/</a></a><br>The Trigun gang inexplicably finds themselves in modern New Jersey, on the hunt for a doctor. <br><br>Another fic that I found while I perusing the Advance Wars fandom (which I actually have a story I&#39;m writing in) was The Rise of Red Lightning (<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5836772/1/The_Rise_of_Red_Lightning"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5836772/1/The_Rise_of_Red_Lightning">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5836772/1/The_Rise_of_Red_Lightning</a></a>) which is an OC /nation/ that the fic writer added that comes from /outer space/ to fight Wars world. It wouldn&#39;t be so bad if any one of the characters from Red Lightning didn&#39;t get more characterization than the rest of the canon characters combined. </p>

            <p>So, out of curiosity, I got a Furaffinity account. Furaffinity is an archive for furry art and fic (both fan and original) of various ratings, but you can&#39;t see the mature-rated stuff without an account. I got the account partly because some of the art there is actually very good and partly in order to find potential badfic. On this site, I found a Redwall fic which isn&#39;t even close to the level of horror in my previous furry-type sporkings, but has its moments. For one thing, it&#39;s a smutfic between Bragoon and Saro, set just after they left the Abbey. Trouble with this is that canonically they left when they were Dibbuns, so during this time period, they should be about six. It appears to be an honest mistake rather than intentional squick, but it jarred. Also, it has Saro wearing a bra, even though it&#39;s a medieval time period and she&#39;s a squirrel so I don&#39;t think she&#39;s supposed to have breasts.<br><br>Anyone think this is sporkworthy, or is that in itself not bad enough to spork? I&#39;m not going to even touch any Redwall fics until after I&#39;ve finished the OFUR tribute, but I just want to know for future reference.</p>

            <p>I hate to rain on your parade, but f this is on FurAffinity, I would have to say it most likely was written as fetish material, or simply as a way to vent a want for anthro writing through something that already has anthros in it. Part of the &#39;bad&#39; for sporkable badfic (at least in my eyes) is that it has to come from a place where it&#39;s <i>visible</i> as a publicly published fanfic, intended as fanfic, and not for the entertainment of a fetish group.<br><br>This may also not be fetish material. And it may also be bad. FurAffinity has both good and bad stuff on it. But either way, I would not make dredging up stuff from FA to spork a habit. The point of getting things off Livejournal, FF.Net, and AdultFanfic.net is because that stuff is terrible, unmarked, and often posted without a full knowledge of what they&#39;re posting in the first place.<br><br>I only bring my point up because if this thing is NOT visible by general internet browsers, the community likely values its privacy and communities that value that privacy probably don&#39;t appreciate a sporking, and are friendlier to very personal(even if squicky) material.<br><br>I don&#39;t really care how squicky it is to you, or others, Laburnum-- just make sure that what you&#39;re planning to spork is primarily intended as fanfic, not fetish material. And also, for the love of all things shiny, please don&#39;t let the disgustingness of it be a deciding factor on sporkability. Especially if it&#39;s from FurAffinity...</p>

            <p>If a fic is posted someplace you need special permission to view, such as being on a friends list on LJ, or needing to make an account in order to read on other sites, then it&#39;s off-limits, because we aren&#39;t interested in invading anyone&#39;s privacy. Also, if the fic was written by special request, or to fulfill specific parameters (kinkmemes are often cited), we generally consider those off-limits, too, to avoid possible conflicts where <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/YKINMK">Your Kink Is Not My Kink</a>.<br><br>In my personal opinion, request/kink fics can still be fair game if they&#39;re posted publicly and the badness is more to do with the writing than the subject matter, but others may advise you to avoid them altogether to be on the safe side. If you&#39;re ever uncertain, I&#39;d also say to err on the side of caution and pick something else.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Not to do with the content-- On principle, let&#39;s not go into Fur Affinity to find material. I was under the impression it was agreed on that we limit our sporkable material to openly offered material (as in, you don&#39;t need an account to read): The Pit, the Uber Pit, and open LJ. This is cited on the Slash-Sporking guide on the wiki.<br><br>So regardless of what it is, I don&#39;t think we should touch it. If somebody&#39;s posting it on FA, then they&#39;re posting it for the community and even the illusion of a small audience and semiprivacy, rather than plastering it everywhere and asking &quot;what do you think?&quot; This is cited in an essay justifying the PPC in the first place.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to get up in your grill, but if you have to make an account for Fur Affinity to find the stuff you want to spork...<br><br></p>

            <p>I particularly like the attention you give to the effects of the badfic on the agents—feeling sick, getting torn apart by spatial distortions, that sort of thing. It makes the mission feel more difficult and more real. Also, the numerals appearing is something I hadn&#39;t seen before, but it makes sense that they would manifest that way.<br><br>One issue: when you break a line of dialogue, you don&#39;t need to capitalize the text in the narrative bit or when you resume the dialogue, and how you break it depends on where the break comes. For instance:<br><br>     “Yeah, right. This…” She hefted <i>Medieval Warfare</i> “Weighs a ton. Let’s get on with it.&quot;<br><br>should read:<br><br>     “Yeah, right. This<font color="red">&quot; —s</font>he hefted <i>Medieval Warfare</i><font color="red">—</font> “weighs a ton. Let’s get on with it.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m guessing that Jackson&#39;s speech didn&#39;t actually trail off long enough for an ellipsis just to lift a book (even a heavy one), so I&#39;ve used m-dashes instead. You can also break dialogue with commas, or any other punctuation, if the break comes in a place where that punctuation would be appropriate anyway. So, this one:<br><br>     “He has not been identified,” said Felaben, looking into the distance, “But I have my suspicions.”<br><br>should be written this way:<br><br>     “He has not been identified,” said Felaben, looking into the distance, “<font color="red">b</font>ut I have my suspicions.”<br><br>because you could also write the dialogue in a continuous line with the comma in the same place:<br><br>     &quot;He has not been identified, but I have my suspicions.&quot;<br><br>In the first example, the m-dashes go outside the quotation marks because the pause isn&#39;t actually part of her speech. Make sense? {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Here are some that don&#39;t seem to flow well:<br><br>&quot;a screen lit up on his office wall, showing a string of complicated letters and numbers, which showed him the injuries of the casualty he was about to deal with.&quot;<br><br>&quot;As soon as he arrived in the assessment room, Arthur could tell the young man was in a bad way.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...the sheer amount of blood that was splattered on his face, and also leaking from under his light shirt, dripping off the stretcher trolley onto the clean floor. … The ambulance crew had cut off his trousers and footwear,&quot;<br><br>&quot;Arthur could see his right leg was mangled, twisted to a horrific degree and with what looked a nub of bone poking through the flesh of his calf. His right foot was also bleeding, with a deep cut on the heel. Moving up to his face, Arthur recognised the two black eyes he had been told about. In addition to these the man was sporting a deep gash on his cheek and several more across his neck, one of which was dangerously close to his pulse point.&quot;<br><br>&quot;As the assistant doctors began to cut away Merlin&#39;s thin shirt (they could not peel it off for fear of disturbing him),&quot;<br><br>&quot;Merlin was wheeled off to the operating theatre once more, to remove a sliver of metal which had become lodged deep in his stomach lining, and to re-align four broken ribs.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...even fetched some grapes and a glass of water in case the dark haired man came round while he was away.&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;Nah, sorry love&#39; she replied, in her coarse accent. &#39;Officer says he&#39;s bin out like a light all through. Dunno when he&#39;ll wake up, but i &#39;ope it&#39;s not too soon. Don&#39;t need another mouth t&#39; feed round &#39;ere, do we?&#39;&quot;<br><br>&quot;The other piece of paper in the folder was of course the reference sheet of injuries. It was so long and contained such horrific descriptions that Arthur shuddered involuntarily and replaced it quickly.&quot;<br><br>...And that&#39;s about it. There may or may not be some I overlooked, but here are some paragraphs from the sporked fic itself.</p>
