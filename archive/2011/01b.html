            <p>I&#39;ve seen a story that was plagiarised, it was in the iCarly section of FF.net, I didn&#39;t know it was an entirely copy pasted story, with only the characters names changed. Though the person slipped up and got sloppy and forgot to change some. They tried to explain that they were writing a Twilight fic and sometimes got mixed up. I go to check one day, and another reviewer of it PM&#39;s me saying that it&#39;s been taken down. They even emailed me the original.<br><br>Though your&#39;s might not be copy pasted, I might check it out for some writing that looks like it was from another fic.

            <p>There&#39;s no way to make any sort of reasonable stand on the topic without knowing what you&#39;re talking about first. There&#39;s nothing wrong with liking a story that&#39;s plagerised - if nothing else, it means you&#39;d like the original, and clearly it was good enough to copy, even if it&#39;s amoral. So go and look into it, read the stories they&#39;ve supposedly plagerised from, and decide for yourself it the accusations are true. What you do next is up to you.</p>

            <p>As I mentioned, the accuser didn&#39;t cite any evidence, not even the stories of his he believed were ripped off. The only thing I could think of doing would be to pick over every story of both of then wrote for copied lines, and I&#39;m not sure I have the time or the willpower to do that.<br><br>The most interesting thing I noticed, though, was that the accuser was someone described in an author&#39;s note of an earlier story by the accused as the accused&#39;s &quot;partner in crime,&quot; so I think they must&#39;ve been friends at one point and had a falling-out.

            <p>It&#39;d certainly be a lot wiser for any accuser to show evidence right away, but I suppose they could&#39;ve just forgotten. L&#39;homme_Arbre has an interesting point, though - it might be worth looking into.<br><br>I can&#39;t blame you for not wanting to check all the fics for copied lines. You might have an easier time of it if you take some of the more distinctive lines and Google them, restricting the search to FF.N - you&#39;ll get a lot of rubbish links, but you should find out if there are any direct copies quite quickly.</p>

            <p>You might want to try messaging the accuser and get some more details about it. If they talk to you, you&#39;ll get the information you need, and if they avoid you or start being vauge, that&#39;s generally a sign that the attack is baseless and they&#39;re being bitter.<br><br>However, I have my own theory about the matter. It&#39;s a (sort of) old story. Two friends start writing a story togeher, using one of their pre-established accounts. They have a falling out, maybe over the story, but one of them keeps writing it, using material they both devised. One accuses the other of plagiarism, they bicker, and generally, the story gets dropped out of petulance. It would&#39;t be the first time, and it seems fairly likely.<br><br>That&#39;s just what it sounds like to me. However, you should still keep checking things out. Plagiarism is one of the most serious accusations you can make on a site like FF, and if the author you like is lying about their work, you really should keep looking into it. </p>

            <p>So, I was browsing FF.net one day a long time ago, and found this gem.

            <p>After a long time of hesitation, I&#39;ve finally made up my mind and decided to ask for permission. But I&#39;m still scared.<br>As I&#39;ve said when I came here, English isn&#39;t my first language and I&#39;m not pretty sure if I&#39;m good enough for PPC standards, but I&#39;m giving a shoot anyway.<br><br>I&#39;m applying my agents for DMS, freelance division.<br><br>I&#39;m also giving my writing example without betareading, just spell checking, so as you can see my real writing style.<br><br><i>Agent Joan Ford:</i> she&#39;s a Tolkien elf who grew up in World One, so she has a complex with her pointed ears. She also has a high level of glitter in her blood, for what she sometimes speaks in a sort of suvian dialect. Joan could be described as a nice psychopath; she keeps all her violence inside until the time to kill a Sue comes, when she gets really insane and bloodthirsty.<br><i>Agent Bob, no surname:</i> Bob&#39;s a biped Komodo dragon with no tail, who comes from never-released original fiction. He&#39;s still trying to adapt himself to the Laws and Powers That Be in the PPC, even though he&#39;s an experienced agent. He&#39;s hard-working and curious, and speaks with a tough accent in the T&#39;s and K&#39;s. He&#39;s the calmest of the two of them and takes things lightly, which prevents him from going insane, although when he&#39;s lacking his UV ray dose he tends to bite anything close to him.<br><br>Writing example:<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cyEXGNvqSDuj8yl4N_PQ6z3hLc9NxQv1sE_QaXxX2Nc/edit?authkey=CIrtw_kM&amp;hl=en"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cyEXGNvqSDuj8yl4N_PQ6z3hLc9NxQv1sE_QaXxX2Nc/edit?authkey=CIrtw_kM&amp;amp;hl=en">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cyEXGNvqSDuj8yl4N_PQ6z3hLc9NxQv1sE_QaXxX2Nc/edit?authkey=CIrtw_kM&amp;amp;hl=en</a></a>  </p>

            <p>Not being a native speaker of English doesn&#39;t disqualify you from the PPC. Granted, most PPC&#39;ers are native speakers, but some aren&#39;t. And you could always decide to write missions about fic in your native tongue.<br><br>You do have a problem with punctuation, though. That much is clear from the short sample.

            <p>And dear Sergio is why I do not give badfic a &#39;break&#39; if it&#39;s written by somebody who is a non-native English speaker.<br><br>It&#39;s possible to write at least comprehensible (though I can understand slightly different scanning, flow of the writing, or minor grammar errors) English even if you&#39;re not native. <br><br>I can write french, but my grammar is awful and even as practice I wouldn&#39;t try to write any fic in french.

            <p>Even working hard, for me it&#39;s impossible to write a fic always grammatically correct in English. But beta-readers are here for this reason - point out errors you didn&#39;t see.

The grammar deteriorates as you go along, Arthur (England) is so OOC it makes me cry, and THE ASSBABY. PLEASE, NOT THE ASSBABY. <br>For those who don&#39;t know Hetalia, it&#39;s a manga/anime about personified Nations. There is a lot of slash in this fandom (so I&#39;ve developed a taste for it, but that&#39;s a different story), and one of the most popular pairings is America/England. This particular fic is America/England done so badly that I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s a troll.<br>And as for that Allen fellow? He&#39;s a minor character who appear in one of the anime episodes looking like a cross between America and England - so <i>of course</i> the rest of the fandom latches onto that and... I&#39;m not going to continue ranting.<br>So please, if you write for the DBS and you know Hetalia, please take this fic (and link me once you&#39;re done debugging Arthur).</p>

            <p>Yeah, I prefer to stay away from the smut. A lot of the historical ones are good... it&#39;s just the smut, written by the newbie fangirls, that drive me mad. And USUK&#39;s overdone.<br><br>Hmm, we&#39;ve asked that question in the fandom a lot. So far, all we&#39;ve got for Nation-Nation babies are... perhaps provinces and islands that both nations in question have claim to. So if this kid is born, it might be the Virgin Islands or something. I don&#39;t think it stretches the continua unless the child in question is some made-up country.</p>

            <p>The MSPA fora have had a significant thread in the art sub-forum collecting fanfic for some time.

            <p>Considering there is already a MSPA-chan image board (413chan) on which there is a copious amount of slash, porn and pornfic, no. <br><br>Not long at all.<br><br>I would say that if the badfic goes beyond 3 7-pages (standard MS word 12 point font, single-spaced) then your agents-- or at least my agents, if they were in yours&#39; shoes-- could consider a) summarizing the more boring parts by a timeskip and then recap, b) not traverse the whole fic and instead slay the Sue halfway through.<br><br>Going through the WHOLE thing and cutting it up is nice and all, but I can only wonder if anybody has the stamina to go through that much badfic. I&#39;m sorting through an 8-chapter Spyro the Dragon badfic and I can&#39;t even do it all without including the line &#39;and this went on for several pages and was excruciatingly boring/painful.&#39;-- and my first mission in Legend of Zelda was the same. In fact, I gave one of my agents the &#39;power&#39; to speed-read really fast to compensate because I simply did not have the stamina to stretch it out.<br><br>But if you have that kind of stick-to-it-ive-ness... great! I would write no more than 7-10 single spaced 12 point font MS word pages per mission part.<br><br>(Reasonable margins, of course. What do you think this is, high school?)</p>

            <p>As long as you get far enough to cover the major breaches of canon, you can really just have the exorcism/execution then and there. Most missions only cover about a chapter of any given fic before it ends, the theory being that if a fic hasn&#39;t proven itself awful enough to warrent destruction by the end of the first chapter, it&#39;s unlikely to do so by the end. <br><br>Of course, this isn&#39;t a hard-and-fast rule. For example, if the chapters are very, very short, or there&#39;s some truly horrible canon-rape in the sixth chapter and you&#39;d like to charge them for that, by all means make it as long as you want. Just don&#39;t kill yourself, is maybe what I&#39;m trying to get at here.<br><br>Well, that was pretty damn ramble-y.

            <p>French, since you ask. I was born in America, and my father was American, but my mother spoke only French, so that&#39;s what we spoke around the house. Now though, we speak English, and actually my French is pretty rusty. But, I still have the accent, and if I talk too fast I still have grammar errors, so I generally go over anything I write compulsively in case I start to sound &#39;foreign&#39; (which, in less enlightened parts of the Internet, is simply a fancy way of saying &#39;stupid&#39;.)<br><br>So...my life in a nutshell...Yeah...I&#39;m going to stop talking now.</p>

            <p>Well, first off has to be Pratchett, but I&#39;ll read whatever fantasy or sci-fi I can get my hands on. I also like graphic novels, Alan Moore or Neil Gaiman for preference. I love watching MST3K and a whole slew of cop shows too numerous to mention. I&#39;ve dabbled in anime (Code Geass for preference) and in gaming (I liked Diablo, but since then I haven&#39;t bought or played anything much). <br><br>Umm...I think that about covers it, really.

            <p>I have to say I liked the book a bit better, although I lent out my copy to someone and never got it back. (DX) However, that&#39;s just because it was, in my opinion, a truly awesome book (Oh my [insert deity,] I almost wrote &quot;fic&quot;) and it was still a brilliant movie.<br><br>I made a Bird!Howl costume for Halloween a long time ago..

            <p>No, I&#39;m not all that surprised. Admittedly, I&#39;ve only seen the movie version, but there are some things in a book that really don&#39;t translate well onto the big screen, and others that just may not fly well with the screenwriters... and then there&#39;s the fact that, you know, it&#39;s *Hayao Miyazaki*.

            <p>I was looking through the PPC wiki the other day, and I noticed that the freewebs page which once contained the unsporked text of The Pornfic That Shall Not Be Named no longer functions. Now, this may strike some of you as a good thing. However, for those of us whose morbid curiosity demands reading it, and for those of us who are sadistic enough and have friends unsuspecting enough to force it upon others, or simply for the thousands who have not read this heinous story and will be thus deprived of one more beautifully terrible fanfic to be kismeses with, the loss of this Bad Thing is in and of itself a Worse Thing.<br><br>Does anybody posess the text of this story, so that it may be reuploaded?<br><br>Geez, I&#39;ve been gone from here a while.</p>

            <p>Well, actually, <i>two</i> questions about minis. I was only going to ask the one pertinent to my next mission, but then I saw PoorCynic&#39;s post about a mini-Abraham Lincoln, and had to ask: How in the world does <i>that</i> happen?<br><br><br>Second question (that actually pertains to my interests): I&#39;m in the middle of writing up a mission that a good ninety-seven percent of takes place in one particular fandom. However, there are characters from the fandom that it spawned off from mentioned within said fanfic, and they&#39;re misspelled. Would the minis be the ones belonging to the fandom the characters are from, or the one the mission takes place in?</p>

            <p>In regards to your query about mini-Lincoln, that&#39;s what happens when a Real Person&#39;s name is misspelled in a badfic. A mini is created of that specific person, so you could have mini-Lincolns, mini-Elijah Woods, mini-Gagas, and what have you. <br><br>I think. There was a debate about this a while ago on the boards. I don&#39;t remember exactly what conclusion was reached.<br><br>As for your second question, the question wasn&#39;t exactly clear but I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re talking about spin-offs and things like that (like Torchwood from Doctor Who). I think the characters from the original material who are not regulars in the spin-off material would get the original minis.</p>

            <p>Hello all,<br><br>As the topic says, I&#39;m moving. Actually, I&#39;ve already moved, it&#39;s just most of my stuff that hasn&#39;t.<br><br>I did however end my subscription with my ISP and since that also provided my with the server space to host a website, that website will probably go off-line from February first (or sometime after). This website hosts all my PPC missions. Which means that sometime in the near future, all the links to these  missions on the PPC wiki will become dead links.<br><br>Now, most missions have also been posted on <a href="http://indemaat.livejournal.com">livejournal</a> and/or on ffnet. I don&#39;t have the time -- at the moment -- to go through the wiki and change the links, but if anyone else feels there should be no dead links and accepts the (epic) task, I would appreciate that.</p>

            <p>They&#39;d possibly count as... a sub-canon, if you will? Not part of the main canon, but within their own story that draws from the main one, they are canonical.<br><br>Like if you had a series called something like &#39;Angels of Starlight&#39; or something (I&#39;m just making up names on the spot to be general without having to be as vague) and it had a videogame where the Starlight protagonist has a twin sister called... Nova...<br><br>The videogame is declared noncanon.<br>Nova is not part of &#39;Angels of Starlight&#39; canon, but still sort of related to it.<br>She is however part of the canon for the &#39;Starlight War&#39; videogame that featured her.<br><br>So in an &#39;Angels of Starlight&#39; fic featuring her, she is quite possibly to be considered a crossover character.</p>

            <p>Canon Discontinuity means the creators themselves have said the thing isn&#39;t canon. The thing has been written out of canon entirely, and no longer affects it, so if the character themself is Canon Discontinuity or only appears in a work that is, I&#39;d think they themselves aren&#39;t canon.</p>

I&#39;ve done some MSTs using a couple of my OCs, who can probably be dusted off and used as Agents if and when I get around to it.

            <p>The only real problem would be making certain that the names are actually being misspelled every time. Great Clooloo&#39;s name, for example, can be written as: Tulu, Clulu, Cthulu, Cthullu, C&#39;thulhu, Cighulu, Cathulu, C&#39;thlu, Kathulu, Kutulu, Kthulhu, Q’thulu, K&#39;tulu, Kthulhut, Kulhu, Kutunluu, Ktulu, Cuitiliъ, Thu Thu, or Cthulu.

            <p>I came with the intent of plugging the Nostalgia Critic at <a href="http://thatguywiththeglasses.com"><a href="http://thatguywiththeglasses.com">http://thatguywiththeglasses.com</a></a>, because I&#39;ve been spending almost all of my free time on the site this week. If you were a kid in the &#39;80s and &#39;90s, like me, it&#39;s a mind-blowingly awesome trip down memory lane, with a tour guide who happily goes insane at all the stupid crap we were subjected to (and actually enjoyed; the horror!). <sup>_^</sup> I find the Critic hilarious, even when he&#39;s critiquing stuff I&#39;m still fond of. I think I&#39;m in love. ... Y&#39;know, in a totally intellectual, platonic, non-pervy way. &#39;Cause I&#39;m happily engaged. He&#39;s just so darn funny! <font size="2">(And kinda looks a bit like Hugh Laurie.)</font><br><br>For all the girls out there, who watched stuff aimed at girls, the Nostalgia Chick is pretty good, too, and she doesn&#39;t restrict herself to fluffy pink stuff, either--she reviewed the original Dune movie, for instance.<br><br>There&#39;s a bunch of other stuff on the site, too, but I haven&#39;t really investigated it yet.<br><br>So, if you&#39;re looking for a good laugh and don&#39;t mind potentially not having a life for a while, check out the Nostalgia Critic--he remembers it so you don&#39;t have to! <sup>_~<br><br>~Neshomeh</sup></p>

            <p>Greetings. It has been approximately a month since I joined this here board thingy. (I almost wrote “bored thingy.” Foolish Homophones, always trying to trip me up.) On the wiki’s list of unclaimed badfic, I noticed a particularly annoying example set in the Stargate verse. (It’s a Stu, of the Mirticular variety.) As such, I have decided to see if it is allowable for my agents to embark on such a quest.<br><br>Here is a sample of my writing. I don’t promise I’m thhe greatest writer to ever live, but I am pretty good, if I do say so myself.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6537353/1/Pride_and_Cowardice"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6537353/1/Pride_and_Cowardice">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6537353/1/Pride_and_Cowardice</a></a><br><br>The agents who will undertake the mission are:<br><br>Agent Thomas Greenwall<br>Age: 18<br>Sex: Male<br>Home Continuum: World One<br><br>Bio: Most people first describe Agent Greenwall as “enthusiastic.” He is known for his constant pacing, loud talking, and always being excited about everything, even venturing into badfic. (“I get to help the canon, which is AWESOME!”) He has only been on the job for a month, and only recently been assigned to the department of Mary Sues. A pool is currently going as to how long he will think his job is (deep breath) AWESOME! No one has a time frame of longer than three pieces of badfic.<br><br>Weapon of Choice: AK-47 (“It’s not subtle, but I’ve always wanted to use one of these!”) Also carries a wicked K-Bar, which he has never used on a mission.<br><br>Agent Orken 7861<br>Age: ~24<br>Sex: Male<br>Home Continuum: Animorphs<br><br>Bio:  Cynical and easily annoyed, Agent Seveneightsixone believes he was given Agent Greenwall as his partner due to the laws of narrative comedy. He also believes that it has something to do with an attempt by Upstairs to tone down Greenwall’s behavior. Time will tell if it’s successful.<br><br>Orken is a Yeerk nothlit from the post war Animorph’s continuity, recruited while his native fic was on the verge of deletion. Simply due to his lack of Sue tendencies, while being an original character, an Agent recruited him. (She claims it had NOTHING to do with an attempt at receiving a vacation.) He has been on the job for two years, and has gone through two partners in that time. His last one went insane after a particularly rough job involving Edward Cullen, three eggs, and a talking toilet. (The toilet was the Sue.) He has taken enough Bleeprin to forget the specifics, but his partner went insane before any help could be given to her. <br><br>Weapon of Choice: Dracon Beam. (“Sometimes, being able to just disintegrate a Sue can have it’s advantages.”) He picks up as many as possible whenever in the Animorphs continuity, and keeps them in a cabinet in his response center. He also carries an impossibly sharp katana. He mostly uses it to cut fruit, which looks really cool when done with a Katana. <br><br><br>The mission will be run in the following Badfic. It’s on the list of unclaimed badfic for a reason.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5820378/1/Stargate_Discovery"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5820378/1/Stargate_Discovery">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5820378/1/Stargate_Discovery</a></a><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>Well, for the most part. We&#39;ve discussed this on the channel <s>at great length</s>, so I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware your writing is potentially quite good. It&#39;s just the grammar issues-- we can hardly mock poor grammar while not maintaining our own. The beta is of great importance-- someone efficient, and someone you can learn from.<br><br>This is by no means a permanent No. I&#39;d like for you to post again after you&#39;ve worked with a better beta for a while; if the grammar issues are fixed, you should be all set.</p>

It gives an error, but does give link to your main journal entries, and I got to the mission through the Master List.

            <p>Hello! I was last here during the summer. I&#39;ve since started university (woo!) and been quite busy, but before I trailed off I did get Permission and start writing a mission sporking <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1111233/1/To_live_serve_a_purpose_and_die_alone">this story</a>. Now I&#39;m in the mood to finish the mission, but I&#39;ve been struck by the fact that the fic is quite long, and much though I like Roger and Surhat, there&#39;s only so much of them sitting around and talking that I (or, I think, my potential audience) can handle. So I have a question. Actually, on consideration, two.<br><br>1. Do I have to let the entire fic play out before they can spork it? I&#39;m pretty sure the answer is &quot;no&quot;, provided they can get the Mary-Sue alone (should be easy at at least one point), but I wasn&#39;t positive.<br>2. On an unrelated point, do we think the sand-creature created by this sentence would be sentient or not: &quot;Suddenly, before she knew what was happened, was lifted up of the sand by strong, yet gentle arms.&quot;? If sentient, I&#39;d like to have them bring Suddenly back to HQ — who knows how useful a sand-girl could be. The same question goes for the floating arms, too, I guess.<br><br>Thanks and regards,<br>Lleu Llaw Gyffes</p>

<li>No. I think it&#39;s practice for MSTs to spork every line of a fic. In missions you can use narative to summarise and skip over things. So it depends on whether you are writing a mission or an MST. I don&#39;t count MSTs as missions.<br><br>2. Not everything that is given a name is necessarily sentient. In this sentence it depends on who the &#39;she&#39; refers to. Does it refer to Suddenly or to someone mentioned in a previous sentence?</li>

            <p>It&#39;s intended to be a mission. I think they&#39;re going to skip around a bit more, because I don&#39;t think Roger can bear it and because I think it will be more interesting to see what happens when Grace says &quot;Gummery&quot; and they make reference to the &quot;Book of Gamarye&quot;.<br><br>In this sentence, &quot;she&quot; very definitely must refer to &quot;Suddenly&quot; — &quot;Suddenly, before she realized what was happened, was lifted out of the sand by strong, yet gentle arms&quot; = &quot;Suddenly was lifted out of the sand by strong, yet gentle arms before she realized what was [happening]&quot;. The problem with the arms is that conceivably they could be attached to Merriman; I just think it&#39;s funnier if they&#39;re not, because most of the pronouns in this section are pretty vague.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Lleu Llaw Gyffes</p>
