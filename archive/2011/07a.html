            <p>Yeah...when you see Sues that pointlessly overpowered, the author wasn&#39;t even trying.  Glad to see these ones bite the dust.  I wish I could spork some of this Suethor&#39;s other stuff, but they all contain canons I don&#39;t know.  So uh...uuuuuhhhhh...*Is distracted by Kirox killing Slenderman.  Freaking <i>Slenderman</i>.*<br><br>Anyway, a couple of mistakes in your mission:<br><br>Just before Lunavier&#39;s weapon turns into a staff (or whatever is supposed to be happening there) you spell her name Lunaveir.  Best see about that mini-Sue before it wreaks any havoc.<br><br>&quot;Florestan frowned as this message boomed in and out of the landscape as the group of canons.&quot;  I think the end of that sentence is missing something.</p>

            <p>...but Slenderman WAS mentioned in the fic I sporked. I got the canon back in order before I could get to that point, though. (Slenderman appears around chapter 9 of the fic: I stopped the sporking at chapter 5.)<br><br>Trust me, it&#39;s for the best. If I hadn&#39;t stopped earlier, I&#39;d have had to deal with a Freddy Kreuger mini spawning from yet another mid-chapter author&#39;s note and I would&#39;ve had to get a DeLorean from the Stu before sending that and the gummi ship to DoSAT.</p>

This was a lie.

            <p>((Cont&#39;d from below to prevent comment trees)<br><br>Suicide had, out of long habit, stolen most of the blankets. When Jenni put her leg over his, he belatedly realized that she didn&#39;t have anything on or over her. After taking a moment to admire the picture she made, he untangled one of the blankets (it had gotten quite knotted before being kicked aside) and reluctantly pulled it up just far enough to hide the leg. <br><br>He raised his head just enough to grin down at her. &quot;Yep. Bad influence, me. Let&#39;s see . . . I&#39;ve influenced Nume into punching me in the face, and influenced you into lowering your standards enough to sleep with a Scythian helot. Not a bad start.&quot; He shifted his free hand under the blanket to Jenni&#39;s raised leg, running a rough palm over it and stroking along the lines of muscle that stood out beneath the smooth skin. Ye gods, that felt good. &quot;So far I&#39;m two for two on corruption. What d&#39;you think I should do next? Besides keep you here as long as possible.&quot; </p>

            <p>Jenni grinned back. &quot;Sorry to disappoint, but I didn&#39;t have to lower my standards to sleep with you. I just plain like you. Dock yourself a point.&quot; She shifted herself upward enough to plant a kiss on his mouth for emphasis on the most important of the things she&#39;d said there.<br><br>Feeling fully awake now, she added, &quot;And I think you should tell me what you want to happen while you&#39;ve got me here. Apart from Henry, my routine usually involves tea, breakfast, and some days a shower, all of which I&#39;m happy to share with you, but you don&#39;t seem ready for that much activity yet.&quot; That . . . well, sadly it made sense. She couldn&#39;t be distracted from healer mode too long. He did seem to be moving as little as possible, barring what was involved in petting her (which was very nice). She would see what he said, but she promised herself to show him what she could really do with her hands sooner than later.</p>

            <p>Was she questioning his manhood? Eh, probably not, but she had definitely twigged to some part of what was going on with him. Living as long as Suicide technically had (barring a death or two) came with mixed blessings: women impressed by scars usually weren&#39;t quite as impressed with posttraumatic arthritis. (Ah, the words he&#39;d learned when Medical was putting in his new limbs.)<br><br>Two possibilities occurred to him. One, he could execute a quick roll onto her (no hard task for anyone who&#39;d spent time as a wrestling partner for pissy warrior types) and make good on demonstrating just how much activity he was ready for. Two, he could own up to the usual morning aches and see how she reacted. The former would be more fun in the short term, but it ran the risk of Jenni seeing it for the avoidance tactic it partially was. The latter, on the other hand, might get him something more than a hand massage--but possibly damaging his (so he believed) reputation as an unstoppable killing machine in the process. Decisions, decisions: waking up in bed with a woman like Jenni should not have given rise to that many questions.<br><br>There was always the middle path. Turning onto his side, he hooked one leg around hers and pulled her a little closer, echoing her earlier brief kiss with more intent and meaning. &quot;I already told you,&quot; he said with a lazy smile, running a hand through her loose hair. &quot;You wore the crazy right out of me. I feel perfectly gods-damned justified in taking my time waking up. <br><br>&quot;And I&#39;ll be keeping that point, thanks. Nume expended some real effort in telling me how duplicitous and . . . clutches-y you were. A prize manipulator should know better than to sleep with someone they actually like.&quot; A gender-neutral pronoun with a double edge, he thought. Though he counted himself less a manipulator and more a maimer, really . . . </p>

            <p>Ooh, touchy. She <i>was</i> onto something, and between the nabbing, the kissing, and what sounded almost like a challenge, he was trying to throw her off. He was putting forth a respectable effort, too. Her leg had ended up somewhere very interesting, and his kisses did wreak havoc on her concentration.<br><br>On the other hand, he&#39;d made a crucial error by giving her access to his back. She debated the wisdom of taking advantage, but in the end she couldn&#39;t resist the opportunity to let him know she wasn&#39;t fooled and to fulfill her promise to herself. Some quick seeking with her fingers found a little-remembered spot just below the spine of the scapula, and she put her thumb knuckle into the muscle. This shoulder had undergone some reconstruction, if she remembered right, so she went cautiously to begin with. It would be awful to screw up and do something that caused true pain instead of the &quot;hurts-so-good&quot; of a well-done backrub. If he decided his pride could tolerate it, she would continue wherever she could reach.<br><br>&quot;Sorry, still no point,&quot; she said. &quot;Nume was just being an ass to protect some secret he thinks I might learn from you, and I&#39;m not with you for that. My lustful motives remain pure.&quot; She grinned. Getting into a man&#39;s pants for its own sake wasn&#39;t usually considered pure, but usual was way less fun. &quot;And you don&#39;t have to justify anything, by the way. I wasn&#39;t criticizing you.&quot;</p>

            <p>Oh, she had his attention, all right. Suicide tensed as she pressed her thumb into the hard knot of muscle: a momentary stab of pain shot through it, but as she gently twisted her fingers, the muscle began to relax and the pain became less sharp. An involuntary sound, a mixture of a sigh and a groan, escaped from his lips.<br><br>Both his shoulders had been shot in the first of the battles at the Gates, and that was only the beginning of the injury laundry list. Things had been fixed quite well--hell, he was alive, wasn&#39;t he?--but the residual aches remained, a consequence of simply being his age and still living despite the hell he&#39;d put himself through. Now, tangled together with the pliable softness of Jenni, feeling the leaden pain of an old injury fade and shift like pack ice breaking up . . . He murmured something, an old Scythian curse, and almost unconsciously tightened his grip on her.<br><br>&quot;Pure, huh,&quot; he managed to say. The mixture of pleasure and good pain--enough said. His constant paranoia whispered in his ear, telling him that it just meant she had access to his medical records and knew where to hit him, but Suicide could honestly acknowledge that right then, he didn&#39;t give a damn. Today was a good day to not die. </p>

            <p>That sound was music to her ears, and it brought a beatific smile to her face. She&#39;d got it right. It was a relief, and she found herself relaxing. She hadn&#39;t realized how much she&#39;d tensed up, unconsciously worrying that things might take a bad turn. Much encouraged, she tucked her head under his chin, wriggling as close as she could get to allow her arm as much freedom as possible. This was not the ideal way to go about this, but she wasn&#39;t quite sure he&#39;d let go of her now, and she wasn&#39;t quite sure she wanted him to. It would do for a start.<br><br>&quot;Okay, you got me,&quot; she said to his collarbone. &quot;It&#39;s not all lust. I have a deep and abiding drive to care for others that sometimes gets me into trouble. I can&#39;t help it, so you&#39;d better get used to it.&quot; She wasn&#39;t being facetious, despite how silly the claim could have sounded. It was the simple truth that defined her existence, pronounced in a moment of communion.</p>

            <p>The words sounded strange in Suicide&#39;s ears; awkward, maybe, like he wasn&#39;t quite sure the world fit into place around them. It didn&#39;t surprise him, somehow. She seemed to have momentarily dropped any defenses she had, and unguarded, spontaneous moments of heartfelt expression rarely sound like they do in the epics. He could understand someone having such a moment, and wasn&#39;t about to make fun of it. Campfires, winter hares and merchants&#39; wagons, talk of the glue that held a phalanx together . . .  <br><br>(It was that factor that kept Suicide&#39;s brain from screaming &quot;HEALING SEX! Head for the hills!&quot;)<br><br>&quot;&#39;Mother to a nation,&#39;&quot; he said, his voice guttural as Jenni worked her magic on the knotted muscles. It was a quote, but likely one Jenni didn&#39;t recognize; he didn&#39;t think that myth had even been translated into Greek, let alone English. &quot;Can&#39;t change who you are; shouldn&#39;t try.&quot; Well, quid pro quo and all that . . . He shifted a little, making them both more comfortable.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m a patricide and deserve to be dead.&quot; A small, wry grin appeared, evident in his tone as he echoed her earlier words. &quot;I&#39;m going to keep trying, too, so you&#39;d better get used to it.&quot; <br><br>Another straightforward pronouncement, devoid of the angst that usually accompanied phrases like &#39;I deserve to be dead.&#39; He wasn&#39;t speaking out of emotion, but out of sheer metaphysical certainty. A father-killer was an unnatural thing; for the world to be right again, the murderer had to be murdered. E = mc2, where E equals death, m = paterfamilias, and c2 = the square of the velocity of the murdering son&#39;s knife arm in centimeters per second. </p>

            <p>It wasn&#39;t as though she hadn&#39;t known to a degree; it wasn&#39;t a big secret with his name and history being what they were, so the sting of hearing him say it wasn&#39;t as much as it could have been—a static shock rather than touching a power line—but it was enough to make her pause while her worldview settled back into place around the admission. There were mitigating factors. The way he said it, it was clear it wasn&#39;t a matter of self-hatred, which she could not have stood, but simply a certainty that death was coming and it was just, so he might as well meet it halfway. Also, perspective was key: she was not mortal, and she would lose all her friends here eventually, whether she left first or something happened to them, whether they wanted it or not.<br><br>She gave Suicide a quick one-armed squeeze, then went back to work on him with gusto. &quot;I know,&quot; she said. She did now. &quot;I sure can pick &#39;em, huh?&quot;</p>

            <p>Suicide considered responding to that--maybe by pointing out that she&#39;d picked a brain-damaged, 11% artificial man who had just mentioned his plan to follow up the pleasantry of the last twelve hours with a spot of trying to get himself killed--but something told him sarcasm, however lighthearted, wouldn&#39;t be appreciated at that moment. Furthermore, something very peculiar seemed to be happening to his verbal facilities: attempts to form words were being stifled halfway and turned into something approaching a moan.<br><br>Anybody who&#39;s suffered the pain and indignity of a major injury knows that, healed or not, that injury will be with you for the rest of your life. Break an ankle at ten, and it will still be aching sixty-five years later.  This goes some way towards explaining why Suicide, who hadn&#39;t gotten eight hours in his-or-any-other-gods-only-knew-when and couldn&#39;t count all his collected injuries on both hands and feet, was having trouble expressing himself. He knew about working out muscle knots--a squire had to--but modern medicine had added some tricks even the Bacchan whores hadn&#39;t had.<br><br>Somehow he wound up lying on his stomach, Jenni leaning over him. He could feel the warmth of her breath on the back of his neck as she worked, smoothing out the aches and dodging neatly around the green-and-purple bruising still leftover from the gods-damned Archir incident. <br><br>&quot;You know,&quot; he managed to say after a long pause, his voice hoarse, &quot;this isn&#39;t going to guarantee you getting to work any faster.&quot; She hit a particularly sensitive spot, and he hissed between his teeth. &quot;Perfect. Perfect. Gods, tell me you need something killed . . .  I&#39;ll have its head on your desk by noon.&quot;<br><br>((Charming as ever. *eyeroll* Incidentally, Jenni&#39;s last line made me think of this famous scene-- <a href="http://youtu.be/kawnOGZb48o"><a href="http://youtu.be/kawnOGZb48o">http://youtu.be/kawnOGZb48o</a></a> .

            <p>Good grief. From her kneeling crouch over his hips, Jenni shook her head, glad that he couldn&#39;t see the part amused, part disgusted expression on her face. Typical fighting man. She did appreciate the sentiment behind the tasteless offer, but . . . &quot;No, my friend, I couldn&#39;t hold you to anything promised under duress. Actually, take a breather. And stop strangling my pillow.&quot;<br><br>She switched from directed pressure to broad, shallow sweeps up and down with her palms, giving him a chance to unclench and get his breath back. Once she got into the sort of work she&#39;d been doing, she didn&#39;t mess around. Her hands told her what was necessary, and she did it, whatever the spasms and vocalizations. (As the latter went, &quot;Perfect&quot; was pretty damn good to hear.)<br><br>Meanwhile, she glanced at the time and grimaced. &quot;Shards. We do have to wrap this up. I&#39;m not late, but I have things to do before work, the chief among which is making sure Henry knows I didn&#39;t forget him. The Nursery&#39;s good, but they don&#39;t quite have the creche mentality down—too busy. Maybe Ilraen . . . never mind. Before that, I aim to have a quick wash and some breakfast. You can stay here as long as you want, or tag along. What do you say? And, anything in particular I should hit quick before I let you up?&quot; Well, that might be overstating his ability to move just a bit, but the effect was temporary.<br><br>(( He works with what he&#39;s got. *g* And no, I&#39;d never seen that before.

            <p>Yep, he&#39;d said something wrong. In a way, though, he&#39;d almost expected it; there was a mental gap there, citizen to helot in its manner (there was no other way he could think of it, when a few years as a character were nothing compared to almost forty back home), and he couldn&#39;t be surprised that he&#39;d made a misstep. Still, it didn&#39;t seem to have hurt Jenni . . . <br><br>Trying to curb his behavior in order to not offend someone was a relative novelty in his life. But Jenni was a citizen-woman and as good as a battlefield medic, a firm hand and a smile with a challenge in it. She was a friend. <br><br>And she had worked miracles. As she spoke, Suicide pulled his arms in and braced his palms against the mattress. The muscles still pulled oddly in his shoulders and biceps, but there was a wonderful freedom of movement. He moved slowly, not intending to give anything away to Jenni right away, while she told him she had to get up. That&#39;s right, she had work, and she needed to see her son. Well . . . <br><br>&quot;I should let you go,&quot; he said. Then, in one smooth motion, he pushed off from the mattress and executed a quick roll. Jenni had still been crouched over him, and with his leg hooked around her, he landed her neatly on her back. Another twist put him on top, leaning over her. His ends of his long gray hair draped down onto Jenni&#39;s messy brown, creating an odd tiger-stripe on the pillow. He kissed her hard again, showing his appreciation for her particular talents. Reluctantly--very reluctantly--he let her up after a long moment.<br><br>&quot;But it&#39;s damned hard,&quot; he added, leaving one last nip at her neck. Wait, was that a double-entendre? Somehow, it wasn&#39;t as big a concern as it had been the night before. &quot;I&#39;ve probably got another mission waiting, too.&quot; The unspoken <i>Gods damn it</i> was clear.<br><br>((Ahhh, Oliver.

            <p>Jenni yelped as she went over and reflexively put up her arms in defense, but of course that meant nothing to a big warrior like Suicide. His weight pushed her hands right down, and by that time she&#39;d cottoned on to what had happened and wasn&#39;t worried about it anyway. She <i>was</i> impressed that he&#39;d pulled it off, and that was about as far as she was able to think until he relented. The pass at her neck left her sighing in disappointment when he then moved off. <i>Brat. Tease.</i> If she didn&#39;t have things to do . . . but she did, and since he sounded every bit as frustrated as she felt, she forgave him for toying with her. This time.<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; she agreed breathlessly to everything, said and unsaid. Abruptly, she pushed herself upright and got off the end of the bed, and started assessing what had become of yesterday&#39;s clothes. &quot;Well, if it hurts, do it fast and get it over with, as they say.&quot; Did people say that, or was it just the band-aid thing? Eh, whatever. &quot;Come on. I know you can shift yourself now.&quot; She smirked at him. She&#39;d almost extended a helping hand, but after the stunt he&#39;d just pulled she immediately thought better of it. She&#39;d be more of a challenge in the future, so help her.</p>

            <p>&quot;That&#39;s not what I always heard,&quot; Suicide said, because honestly, if there was ever a phrase that cried out for an innuendo and an eyebrow raise that was it. And frankly, he remembered a few times where something that hurt had been . . . dammit, no point thinking about it now, not when they both had places to be and things to do. They&#39;d probably baited the Universal Laws by having as much time as they had.<br><br>Still, Suicide took a moment to admire the picture Jenni made standing beside the bed--wearing a smirk and nothing else, a combination he definitely approved of--before reluctantly sitting up himself. Instead of standing up himself, though, he leaned over the edge of the bed and reached around Jenni to retrieve part of his uniform, taking the opportunity to trail a quick kiss across the smooth skin of her hip while he was in the neighborhood. Okay, okay, they really had to get up and that was technically not helping, but with Jenni still right in front of him he considered it extenuating circumstances.<br><br>Eventually, he managed to find all of his clothes (how the hell had his belt wound up all the way over <i>there</i>?) and began reassembling himself. Jenni had changed into fresh clothes and was brushing out her long hair, a hair tie already looped around a couple of fingers in preparation for making a quick braid. <br><br>A thought occurred. Suicide silently promised himself that, yes, they did have to go and all that, but . . . dammit . . . he literally <i>was</i> an old-fashioned guy. Ancient-fashioned, even.<br><br>&quot;C&#39;mere,&quot; he said, pulling Jenni down to sit on the bed next to him. She seemed surprised, but she complied. <br><br>Plucking the hair tie from her hands, Suicide ran his hands through the long dark-brown hair. It was clean--a change from what he&#39;d usually worked with, back in the day--but there was also more of it, which he approved of. It took him a moment to remember how he used to begin (only one of his current hands had done this, and the years were hard on the body memory) but as he ran one strand through his fingers, it began to come back. Jenni habitually wore her hair in a braid, didn&#39;t she? Divide into three plaits, twist and weave, don&#39;t yank or the master you&#39;re doing this for will have you beaten with an olive branch. Out of habit, he used the more complicated braid that began at the crown: any loose hair in a fight could be damned dangerous.<br><br>In a way, it was a more intimate act than any of the (admittedly excellent) things they had gotten up to the night before. It was something he&#39;d done only for the great men he&#39;d served, usually when they&#39;d broken an arm and couldn&#39;t dress their hair themselves. He was oddly unsure why he was doing it now . . . Something about the whole situation, sharing stories about last stands the way they had, had gotten a modicum of trust from him. </p>

            <p>&quot;What . . . ?&quot; she started as he sat her down. She kept finding herself playing catch-up with this man. This was the quickest realization so far—once he took the elastic tie from her it was quite plain what he intended—but also the most surprising, even more than being tackled minutes before. That fit with everything she expected from him. This was different.<br><br>He was so quiet. She wasn&#39;t sure what she thought he should say, but that was only part of it, an intent stillness that she felt from him. Why was he doing this? How did he know how to do this? The only times she could remember anyone braiding her hair for her had been times when she was small, and it was a mother- or sister-figure doing it. This didn&#39;t feel like those times. He wasn&#39;t patronizing her in the slightest, he was just . . . helping.<br><br>And he was good at it. It was a little uneven thanks to the angle created by sitting beside each other, but it was a good weave nonetheless: secure, but not so tight as to pull the scalp and be uncomfortable. This was another example of what she&#39;d observed of his handiwork with a bandage before, such unusual dexterity and gentleness from someone so rough around the edges. Forget sarcasm; she really could pick &#39;em.<br><br>When he&#39;d finished, she turned to face him and took his hands in hers, brushing the knuckles of each with a kiss. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br><br>(( Post title should really be &quot;This means something . . . but what?&quot; but then it wouldn&#39;t be a quote from <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i>. ))</p>

            <p>Suicide shrugged a little, unsure of how to respond. He knew only that it had seemed like the right thing to do at the time: it was a sign of partial trust, at any rate, and a good thing to do for someone who was going to be spending the day with psychotic patients and their possible hair-pulling tendencies. (He was speaking from personal experience. When he&#39;d first awakened, inexplicably alive and incapable of understanding what anyone was saying, he&#39;d grabbed his &#39;captors&#39; by anything he could get his hands on.) That wasn&#39;t something that warranted thanks in his opinion; it was a given, a part of being in war with another living being. <br><br>&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; he said after a moment. His mental list of modern behaviors reminded him that it was the appropriate thing to do, but Jenni could likely tell that that response--unlike the shrug, and the silence before--was rote. He felt like he&#39;d said and done everything that really meant anything on that score already, and adding more words to it would make the whole thing moot. He&#39;d said his best piece by already doing it.<br><br>&quot;I told you last night,&quot; Suicide added, straightening up a little. &quot;Quid pro quo, right?&quot; He took the opportunity of Jenni being so close to steal another kiss, but the clock was relentlessly advancing and even his underdeveloped sense of duty was beginning to prod at him. Reluctantly, he stood up and checked his sheathed knife. &quot;So much for getting dressed in a timely manner, I suppose. I hope you know that you&#39;re <i>incredibly</i> distracting.&quot;</p>

            <p>Jenni got up after him, smiling a little uncertainly. She felt like she&#39;d put a foot wrong, but somehow landed the right way up anyway, and without being able to explain any of it. He seemed almost as confused as she was, which was no help. Maddening. Well, no time to figure it out now. She would have to hope for another chance.<br><br>She shrugged at his last remark, and her smile took a firmer hold. &quot;What can I say, I was made this way. You&#39;re not so bad yourself.&quot; She winked, and then reached out to touch his arm above the elbow in a forestalling gesture. &quot;Listen, speaking of time . . . I know scheduling anything is impossible, but would you keep me posted when you&#39;re around? And feel free to just drop in. If I&#39;m in the department, my door is usually open.&quot;<br><br>She refrained from spelling out just how much she was interested in seeing him again. When rule number one was &quot;no promises,&quot; it seemed like that would be overstepping a boundary on her part. An open line of communication and standing invitation would have to do.</p>

            <p>Now that was something he was on better terms with. Suicide paused when she touched his arm, running a hand through his shaggy gray hair (doing absolutely nothing for it; the man seemed to generate an internal scruffiness field). <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s too late,&quot; he said cheerfully. &quot;You&#39;ve gone and fed me after midnight, and now you&#39;re stuck with me.&quot; The gremlin analogy seemed appropriate, especially considering that he&#39;d left several bite marks. &quot;The Universal Laws have probably lined up another mission for me, but--&quot; He momentarily contemplated the virtues of <i>when I get back</i> versus <i>if I get back</i>, and decided to slither out of the issue by doing a quick rephrase &quot;--but I&#39;ll be coming by again as soon as I can. I&#39;d say feel free to drop by the RC, but--Mithiriel.&quot; The name spoke volumes: Lemon-Pledge-scented, Glare-of-Doom-wielding volumes.<br><br>He moved towards the door, but stopped himself halfway through the motion. Jenni still seemed a bit on edge, and it seemed to him that a couple of things hadn&#39;t been covered yet.<br><br>&quot;Thanks,&quot; he said to her. The word came out oddly, a little blunt, but with feeling. &quot;You&#39;re a good woman.&quot; <i>Ouch</i>, rhetoric was definitely not his bag--yet that was the only way to put it as far as he was concerned. He couldn&#39;t picture her telling someone to come back with their shield or on it, but citizen women were worthy for more than just their stoicism. There was something horribly ironic about him holding up standards for what made a &#39;good&#39; person, especially considering that he routinely got rid of self-proclaimed good people, but he could only go by what he remembered and knew for himself. Like his own impending death, it was a certainty. &quot;Friends?&quot;</p>

            <p>It might not have been great rhetoric, or even good English, but it got the job done. With each word, Jenni felt her lingering uncertainty fade and optimism take its place. Not explicitly, but tacitly, with bluff sincerity, he&#39;d given her permission to look forward. That had been the hangup, and with that dealt with, she answered with a smile of unrestrained gladness.<br><br>&quot;Perfect.&quot; There was no way she was <i>not</i> hugging him at this point. How did anyone not hug someone who&#39;d just said you were good and wanted to see you again, and looked so damned adorably scruffy while doing it? Some things had to be spoken, but for two tactile creatures such as themselves, this was more eloquent than any words could ever be. The door could wait half a minute. Or a whole one. Or—<br><br>&quot;Okay, no, really.&quot; She was laughing, but she brought up both hands on Suicide&#39;s chest and pushed herself firmly back a step. Even with the height difference making it less easy than it could have been, turning a hug into a kiss was as inevitable as the hug, and it took a real effort of will to stop there with the feeling of the newly-cemented connection vibrant between them. Yet, by the same token it was easier, too. She wasn&#39;t worried about losing it now, making it possible to reach over and quickly unlock and push open the door.<br><br>Jenni started to say something about going and doing his job (shield optional), but her eye caught a low shape in the hallway. Her mouth dropped open momentarily, but pressed shut again in a vexed expression before she spoke. &quot;Fern. What brings you here?&quot; Her tone suggested she already knew the answer.<br><br><i>Oh, bearing messages, as usual,</i> the potted fern replied casually. <i>The nurses have a little betting pool on your appearance and asked me to mark the time for them as a neutral observer. Elms will be quite pleased, but I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve disappointed poor Mirrad. He expected you sooner.</i><br><br>Jenni hadn&#39;t blushed right away, but she did now. Mirrad&#39;s opinion meant something to her.<br><br>She stared a moment, looking puzzled. &quot;We didn&#39;t see anyone. How did—?&quot; The lightbulb went on, and she snapped her fingers, rolling her eyes at how oblivious she&#39;d been. &quot;Frank.&quot;<br><br>The fern ruffled its fronds in amusement. <i>You didn&#39;t think you could escape notice, did you? In this department? They&#39;re putting up the banner in the break room, you know.</i><br><br>That was unexpected. &quot;You mean the &#39;You Got Laid!&#39; banner?&quot; It did. &quot;I thought we got rid of it after Suzine threatened us all with No-Drool Videos the last time!&quot; She shook her head, fighting hard not to laugh, and turned to Suicide. &quot;This is . . . I was in on inventing the thing. It didn&#39;t seem fair that only the guest should have to take the Walk of Shame, you know? Of course, I have no shame.&quot; She grinned. &quot;You don&#39;t strike me as the type, either. Am I right?&quot;</p>

            <p>Jenni seemed to have figured out what he meant, and expressed her good mood in a manner that Suicide decided he could definitely become accustomed to. He was still wearing a grin when the door slid open and the Fern interrupted. His hand automatically went halfway to his knife--inevitable when something surprised him--but as it explained, its psychic &#39;voice&#39; carrying just the tiniest hint of amusement, he understood what was going on.<br><br>Oh, he knew that one. The addition of the banner was a nice touch, he had to admit, but it was still a routine that was old even in his day. Didn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t funny, though. <br><br>&quot;Someone once accused me of being shameful,&quot; Suicide observed, glancing around and taking his bearings. &quot;He&#39;s dead now. Hey, Jenni, which way is the lounge?&quot;<br><br>When she pointed it out, he nodded and took stock of himself and his resources. The Fern wouldn&#39;t be much help, but then plants never were. (Suicide was not racist or speciesist. Kingdomist, absolutely.) He himself was already a rumpled mess, and his hair . . . ahhh, the hair. Like Dienekes always said: nothing like long hair to make a handsome man more comely or an ugly man more terrifying. He ruffled his hair a little more, giving it the extra volume it needed to be really Wolverine-shaggy and manelike, and made sure the sleeves of his uniform shirt were pulled up for that &#39;no time, things to do&#39; touch. The knife, in its curious white leather sheath, he shifted to his hip: <i>&quot;Very</i> Byron Sully,&quot; as Dio had once said.<br><br>Taken all together, he was appeared the antithesis of someone who would even be caught in the same zipcode as the concept of shame. <br><br>&quot;C&#39;mon, Jenni,&quot; he said. &quot;Let&#39;s go say hello.&quot; With a small grunt (no comments, please, it was still early for him) he picked Jenni up entirely. There was another of those wonderful surprised squeaks from her, but it didn&#39;t seem to bother her too much: it was obvious she&#39;d sussed out what he was thinking, and probably shared it. Suicide arranged her as artistically as he could, finally settling on a hold that left Jenni halfway between bridal-style and a &#39;50s damsel being kidnapped by the monster of the week. He strode off down the corridor, balancing her fairly easily and feeling decidedly cheerful. Rubbing his excellent night in the faces of everyone in the lounge sounded like a good start to the day.</p>

            <p>Jenni was happy to go along with the general order of &quot;Let&#39;s go counter-harass your co-workers!&quot; She wasn&#39;t sure she could pull off the damsel in distress thing he seemed to intend, though. She was far too put-together for it—and nobody was touching this braid—so she did her best to look like the arrangement was her idea, relaxed but poised and a little bit smug. Why yes, she <i>had</i> tamed the wild man with the power of love (well, <i>eros</i>, anyway); how perspicacious of you to notice. It was close enough to her old schtick to be worrisome to those who knew her well, but removed sufficiently to be safe. Yes, it would do.<br><br>The nurses&#39; lounge wanted to be found. It was exactly where Jenni remembered it being yesterday, and the door was just slightly ajar—perfect for an adventurer-style surprise entrance. There weren&#39;t any Beholders on the other side, but there were several nurses who all jumped at the bang. Mirrad the former Ranger slipped seamlessly into a fighting stance, of course, but Parwill, Elms, and young Alex all looked like they&#39;d had their tails stepped on, and Immac actually said &quot;eek!&quot; Alex was nominated by the Narrative Laws as the Obligatory Spit-taker, and since Parwill was sitting across from him at the room&#39;s single table, they shared in the honorary coffee-stain.<br><br>&quot;Hi, guys!&quot; Jenni said. &quot;We heard you were throwing us a party. Love the decorations.&quot; She nodded at the banner, taped up on the wall above the coffee pots. It was pastel yellow with &quot;You Got Laid!&quot; in magenta letters, possibly one of the most offensive combinations short of Sue-colors, and dotted with excessively happy smiley-faces. &quot;So true. Mm, so true.&quot; She grinned. <br><br>Elms, the curly-haired blonde standing under the banner with a roll of tape still in hand, was the least embarrassed of the lot—coming from a life as a barmaid would do that for you—but she still had the courtesy to be completely put out once she&#39;d stopped being startled. &quot;Jenni! Dammit, it&#39;s no fun if you&#39;re just going to advertise, woman! And what&#39;s with this guy? <i>Someone</i> assigned Charisma as a dump stat this morning.&quot; She leveled a skeptical look at Suicide over her blue glasses, no doubt speculating unfavorably on the rest of his character sheet.</p>

            <p>Nobody could ever accuse Suicide of being charismatic, but in the true sense of the stat, he was actually quite good at making a lasting impression on people. If anything he had, to use the Discworld term, charisn&#39;tma: people had occasionally been known to stick around him just to see what destruction he would cause next. And he was more than enough of a jerk to enjoy the surprise and irritation of the nurses, who reacted just as badly to having the tables turned as the young Thebans and Astakians had when their pranks were foiled.<br><br>He set Jenni down easily, but kept his left arm around her shoulders. There was a mischievous spark in her eye as she surveyed the room, which Suicide definitely approved of. So she <i>was</i> capable of cruelty--or messing with people, anyway, which was at least something to build on. <br><br>&quot;Morning to you too,&quot; he said cheerfully to Elms, and acknowledged the massed FicPsych personnel with a nod of the head. &quot;And you have my sympathy. If this kind of thing&#39;s so rare around that you have to make a fuss about it, we probably should&#39;ve gone elsewhere and rubbed it in anyone&#39;s face.&quot; A thought seemed to strike him, and he frowned for a moment before holding out his free hand to Elms. &quot;Hell, where&#39;re my manners? Sorry about that. Nice to meet you all; I&#39;m Agent Suicide.&quot;</p>

            <p><i>That</i> got a reaction. The hand was met with a flat stare—nobody in that room was going to take such an abrupt reversal at face-value, and Elms was no exception—but any comment she might have made was cut off by a squeak from Immac, who was sitting at the table next to Parwill.<br><br>&quot;Oh! I&#39;ve heard of you!&quot; she said, bouncing slightly in her chair. &quot;<i>You&#39;re</i> the one whose partner came down with Bursar Disease, and you put that poor elf in here with a Dibbler pie. Nathonea told me all about it!&quot; She was caught somewhere between excitement at making the connection and worry that Suicide was going to pull some sort of questionable pastry out of a pocket right then and there.<br><br>&quot;Immie&#39;s from the Disc,&quot; Jenni said for Suicide&#39;s benefit, leaning contentedly against his side. This was going to be interesting. &quot;&#39;Course everyone&#39;s heard of Ithalond. I missed the Bursar Disease thing, though. Diocletian seemed sane enough when I saw her, allowing for circumstances.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Agent Astreth vanished before completing her course of treatment, I believe,&quot; Mirrad intoned. The Minbari had relaxed once it became apparent that no attack was forthcoming, and stood with his hands folded serenely across the front of his cream-colored robe. At just under five and a half feet tall, he wasn&#39;t someone most people would expect to hold his own in the middle of a fight with someone like Suicide, but then again, he did have the &#39;bald man with a Denn&#39;Bok&#39; thing working for him. The others regarded him with clear respect when he spoke. &quot;But no matter. Since our humorous prank seems to have rebounded on us, let us remember our own manners. Agent Suicide, please allow me to introduce Nurses Elms, Immac, and Parwill, and Intern Bjшrnsen. I am Mirrad.&quot; He raised his hands, one laid over the other with the palms inward, thumbs raised and touching to form a triangle. &quot;Congratulations on a successful . . . courtship. It seems I underestimated just how successful. Elms was very astute, however.&quot; His dark eyes definitely had a bit of a sparkle to them, for all his polite demeanor.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m still not sure this is appropriate,&quot; Alex murmured into the remainder of his coffee. The edge of his keenness appeared dulled by the stains on his jacket cuffs and an impressive blush that spread all the way up to his hairline.<br><br>Elms overheard and rewarded him with a comradely slap on the back that almost spilled his cup. &quot;Loosen up, kid. If you can&#39;t be nice and comfy with the things folk get up to at night of their own free will, you&#39;ll never hack it in this department. Jenni gets it, even if her taste is gods-awful. The Dibbler pie guy? Really? And since we&#39;re on the subject of the Disc, I gotta point out the whole Cohen the Barbarian thing.&quot; She shook her head sadly, though the effect was spoiled by the persistence of a shit-eating grin. Being reminded that she&#39;d just won a tidy little betting pool did wonders for her mood. &quot;I&#39;ve lost respect for you, Jen, I really have.&quot;<br><br>(( I&#39;m sorry, this lot could talk forever. &gt;.&gt;; If I let Jenni respond they will, so I&#39;ll stop here and give Su a chance to defend himself and/or her. Or just directly snark back at Elms, I suppose. *g* Also, everything I know about Parwill is on the FicPsych Personnel wiki page, so feel free to write him/her/whatever if inspiration strikes. Immac, too; she&#39;s your basic bubbly excitable type, not tricky to write. I figure she comes in handy for cases of wangst and emo-ness. ))</p>

            <p>The handshake was rebuffed, to Suicide&#39;s complete lack of surprise, so he shrugged one shoulder and tucked the hand into a trouser pocket instead. He was hardly insulted or disappointed, not when everything was shaping up so nicely. The results of their entrance had been nicely chaotic, a couple of the nurses were clearly disappointed that their would-be moment of embarrassing had been defused, and at least one of them looked vaguely ill at the memory of Ithalond--which, to be fair, was entirely expected given what the Elf gone through. (Not long after the incident, Suicide had taken it upon himself to taste a Dibbler pie and had temporarily <i>gained</i> the will to live. It had been so unnerving that he&#39;d privately promised himself that he&#39;d be less hard on Ithalond.)<br><br>&quot;Dio&#39;s fine,&quot; he said to Jenni. His arm was still draped around her, partially because it felt good and partially because he rather felt that the &#39;my territory&#39; message hadn&#39;t quite been conveyed to the skeptical Nurse Elms enough yet. &quot;She used to have her moments, though. Spending time on the Island Where Dreams Come True might not&#39;ve been the brightest idea.&quot;<br><br>He gave a genial, no-loaded-pies nod to Immac, and was about to reply to Nurse Mirrad (in the years since he&#39;d come to the PPC, several painful experiences had taught him not to underestimate short bald men with uncannily serene dispositions), but Elms&#39; use of the shit-eating grin was deemed a matter for more urgent attention. That was <i>his</i> favorite expression, thankyouverymuch.<br><br>“If you think this is bad,” he added to her, his tone congenial, “you should&#39;ve seen me <i>before</i> I died the first time. I wouldn&#39;t question her taste, though: my masters always told me that when you find a woman who knows what she wants, the only thing you can do is give it to her as much as possible.” The sad thing was, that actually counted as a masterfully subtle innuendo where Suicide was concerned. <br><br>((I&#39;m sorry, I couldn&#39;t think of anything to do with them. *fails* Su would have to be maintaining about three different conversations at once for me to utilize them properly, I think.))</p>

            <p>It got a laugh from both Jenni and Elms. The others variously smiled quietly, giggled, or pretended not to have heard. Elms nodded in approval—it seemed Suicide had earned himself some points.<br><br>&quot;Wise man,&quot; Jenni remarked, giving him an affectionate scratch between the shoulder blades. &quot;Elms, you&#39;re nineteen, aren&#39;t you?&quot; she asked with a grin, remembering stories from the previous night. &quot;The multiverse looks awfully different at nineteen. You just don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing—but alas, I don&#39;t have time to enlighten you right now. Not that you lot don&#39;t deserve every filthy little detail, but I&#39;ve got more important things to do.&quot;<br><br>Alex breathed an audible sigh of short-lived relief before Jenni added to Suicide, far too earnestly, &quot;Of course, you could stay if you&#39;re feeling civic-minded. I&#39;m sure the Flowers would understand. Educating the youth is very important.&quot; She couldn&#39;t resist, really. She could practically hear the wheels turning in the nurses&#39; heads, calculating how likely was imminent trauma, how much Bleeprin it would take to erase it, and how quickly they would have to move to escape out the door.</p>

            <p>Elms was nineteen, eh? Suicide mentally resorted her into the &quot;kid&quot; category, but like Nume, she was a kid who had shown some excellent backbone. Still--ai Na&#39;an, he was being condescended to by someone less than half his age. He really was getting old. When he was nineteen, he hadn&#39;t even expected to live to twenty, let alone to forty-something (how old was he, anyway?), and now he was the crazy old man people couldn&#39;t believe someone would sleep with. How times change, eh?<br><br>On the other hand, there were serious benefits to being the crazy old man . . . <br><br>&quot;Tempting,&quot; he said, planting a quick kiss on the top of Jenni&#39;s head. &quot;But we might give the callow youth PTSD if we tried to enlighten them.&quot; There was a moment of relaxation as the nurses breathed again. &quot;But it looks like there&#39;s still plenty to do around here. And I know it&#39;s not the Medical department, but you do have plenty of drugs and supplies here, don&#39;t you? I <i>did</i> tell you I wanted to practice my field medicine. I thought I saw Legolas looking rather beat-up in the hallway, too.&quot; He gave Jenni his best charming grin, which wasn&#39;t very charming at all but got the message across. &quot;I need to learn to use anesthesia some time, right?&quot;</p>

            <p>The moment of relaxation was followed by one of nervous anticipation. Even Parwill looked up from his—her—<i>Parwill&#39;s</i> breakfast to watch Jenni for an indication of how seriously they should take this development. It wasn&#39;t a question of whether they were being messed with or not, since Suicide&#39;s expression left no doubt, but rather how far it would go.<br><br>Jenni herself seemed to be in some doubt on that score, looking up at him with a fixed expression, but as it turned out that was only because she was trying not to laugh. She gave up after a moment.<br><br>&quot;You know, if you want me to strap you down again, all you have to do is say so,&quot; she said with elaborate sweetness, eliciting a few groans and a facepalm from the nurses. (Mirrad notably did not react, but seemed to have designated himself the responsible adult in the room and merely kept an eye on things as he went about his own routine.) &quot;But either way, I&#39;m off.&quot; She turned to the room and gave them a wave. &quot;Thank you all, you&#39;ve been a wonderful audience. Elms, hide the banner before Suzine confiscates it, and better luck next time. Alex, let&#39;s talk when I get back, okay? Be somewhere findable.&quot;<br><br>The young intern nodded, cooperative in spite of looking pinched with apprehension. Yeah, he definitely needed some reassurance about all this. Later.<br><br>&quot;As for you,&quot; she said to Suicide, &quot;we did this dance already, but at least walk me out. I&#39;m pretty sure you don&#39;t really want to stay here that badly. Trying to anesthetize random canons would be a good way to earn a one-way booking, though.&quot; She shook her head with a wry smile. &quot;Mental images for the day. Thanks for that.&quot;</p>

            <p>Jenni was indeed the mother of a two-year-old, so she was likely familiar with some version of the expression that briefly flitted across Suicide&#39;s face. It was similar to the one any small boy got when a parent would tell him to stop poking a helpless squishy animal with a stick. Fortunately, Suicide was not the type to pout (although there was definitely an aura of &#39;taking away my toys&#39; about him), and he offered Jenni his arm with the kind of perfect, studied gentlemanliness that suggested he hadn&#39;t in fact been threatening people with gleefully non-advanced field surgery only moments before.<br><br>&quot;Nice to meet you all,&quot; he said, giving them his best &quot;I&#39;m not crazy, really&quot; smile, which was about as close as he got to being normal in polite company. Once they were out of the room, though, he dropped it for something slightly more genuine, albeit definitely of the shit-eating variety. <br><br>&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; he continued contemplatively as he walked down the hall with Jenni. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to stay here forever. Being surrounded by psych professionals means they might wind up curing me of my unsociable impulses, and then where would I be? Talk about curing yourself right out of a job. I can&#39;t see me going in for late-in-life retraining, getting one of those degree things.&quot; <br><br>That was a little loquacious for him, but hell, the world could sue him. He was in a good mood: he&#39;d spent the night with a fascinating and quite flexible woman, he&#39;d helped said woman scare her coworkers, and best of all, there was a good chance of a repeat. He liked her: she <i>was</i> a good woman, though there wasn&#39;t a way he could properly articulate that to her. The braid was a mute testimony to what had happened there.<br><br>It was getting on for what passed for morning in the PPC, and FicPsych was beginning to stir. Reluctantly, Suicide crossed the threshold. After a moment&#39;s hesitation, though, he turned and flicked the end of Jenni&#39;s braid lightly. &quot;I&#39;ll be around,&quot; he said, risking that notorious moment of sincerity again. &quot;Say hi to Henry and Ilraen for me, okay? And tell Ilraen that if he&#39;s gonna make a habit of psychotic breakdowns on missions, he and Nume need to work out some kind of buddy system. When he went to pieces on &#39;Ring Child,&#39; it was a complete mess. No form at all.&quot; If Jenni squinted, she could possibly guess at how this was Suicide&#39;s form of trying to be friendly towards the other agents. <br><br>&quot;Thanks,&quot; he added finally. A good night was at an end, but he had the sense that something even better might be getting started.<br><br>((If you want to cap this off, you can, but otherwise we can end it there. Michigan is beautiful, BTW!))</p>

            <p>Amused at the stream of talk, Jenni raised an eyebrow at the words &quot;professionals&quot; and &quot;degree,&quot; but she suspected the fact that FicPsych was just like the rest of the organization in that the majority of the nurses had no formal training was not something she should advertise. They did the best they could with what they had, and it so happened that their best was pretty good most of the time. She was proud to be one of them.<br><br>She exited the department with Suicide, and in a gesture that might have been a sign of shyness in anyone else, tucked her chin and raised a hand to the angle of her jaw in response to the touch to her hair. She didn&#39;t fully understand what had prompted him to braid it, so there wasn&#39;t anything she could say to acknowledge it that would make sense. Still, he seemed to get the idea.<br><br>She did recognize the gruff practical advice for the sign of goodwill that it was—Nume, Mr. Cold Fish himself, was an accomplished practitioner of the art—and she nodded. &quot;Will do. While we&#39;re at it, thank Diocletian for letting me borrow you.&quot;<br><br>And that was that, really. &quot;Thank <i>you</i>,&quot; she said back to him. &quot;And hey, you know where to find me. I&#39;ll be seeing you.&quot; No overly dramatic last-minute gestures, just a smile, a wave, and a parting phrase with at least two distinct but related interpretations. Yes, she reflected as she started for the Nursery, this was definitely the start of something good.<br><br><br>(( Yay, conclusion! I just wanted to get the actual moment of walking away in there.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you made the trip in one piece. Michigan IS pretty. If you ever have a yen to go camping, there are some great spots, especially in the north of the &quot;mitten&quot; and the Upper Peninsula. {= D ))</p>

            <p>&quot;War&#39;s war,&quot; Suicide said, &quot;and it&#39;s rare it doesn&#39;t get to you.&quot; His own expression conveyed, equally clearly, that he didn&#39;t believe she hadn&#39;t been affected and furthermore, that the curative properties of a good Sobranie were highly underrated by the medical community. (It was a very eloquent expression, involving the deployment of both eyebrows.) <br><br>&quot;And nothing wrong with getting ahead.&quot; A grin edged its way back onto his face. &quot;My RC&#39;s console had a terribly regrettable accident, so I don&#39;t have anywhere to be for a while.&quot; He gave her hand the slightest squeeze, but his expression was tending mischievous. &quot;Still, if it&#39;s going to be problematic, try a different tack. We&#39;ve broken through the hard part with the sadness and flashbacks. Now it&#39;s time for you to indulge in the other great pastime of people who&#39;ve lived through a lot of shit--bitching about it and one-upping anyone who says they&#39;ve lived through worse. That&#39;s therapeutic, right?&quot;</p>

            <p>(( I&#39;m back! This runs long, and I hope it&#39;s okay that I pushed through to the end of the tale without allowing chances for Su to respond. I figured he&#39;d go along with just letting her get it over with. ))<br><br>&quot;It probably is,&quot; she agreed cautiously, and started to say that she really hadn&#39;t done that much and didn&#39;t have anything to complain about, but her own thoughts gave her the lie. And he seemed to know it. She wondered when she had become so transparent. It wasn&#39;t the first time someone had suggested unburdening herself, but it usually took longer, and never before had anyone been quite so direct with an invitation to bitch and moan. She wasn&#39;t quite sure what to do with it.<br><br>She had to say something, though, so she picked a thought out of the tumult. It came with a return smile. &quot;It&#39;s sweet of you to try to make things easier on me. I want to finish the story for you, though, and I think I&#39;ll satisfy both of us this way.&quot;<br><br>She took a deep breath to begin with. &quot;So, the quarantine was lifted. We were able to get most of the canons home at last, and we got Immac and Parwill to Medical. I thought I would finally be able to take care of Derik beyond just keeping him from dying, but no. See, here&#39;s what I have to bitch about,&quot; she interjected with a lopsided grimace for Suicide&#39;s benefit. &quot;Suzine didn&#39;t even give me five minutes to look in on him before I left, and then when I checked in a bit later I found out they&#39;d <i>lost</i> him. A man who&#39;d been in a catatonic state for a month suddenly decided to get up and take a walk—later I found out he&#39;d been provoked by Leroux!Erik, and honestly I&#39;m grateful that he was able to achieve what we couldn&#39;t for Derik—and they were too overwhelmed to deal with it. I could have killed Mirrad and Suzine when they told me, but there wasn&#39;t time. They needed anyone with any experience in Medical. And this, when we were just starting to pick up the pieces and we were all exhausted already, <i>this</i> is when the Sues invaded.<br><br>&quot;For my part, like I said, I really didn&#39;t do more than anyone else. Dr. Fitzgerald declared that the doors would stay open so people could come to us in Medical, but his staff were too busy to take it further. I got the agents who could manage it to organize a defense, which Sedri led—I stayed with them because you can&#39;t get a possessed agent past a psychic—but fortunately we didn&#39;t need it. The Sues that did come our way were annihilated by Omicron. I don&#39;t know if he was one of Honesah&#39;s Daleks or something else, but anyway, he got the job done, and we were able to get back to the business of fixing people.<br><br>&quot;I checked in on FicPsych, and found to my great relief that Derik had turned up again, minus Sue-induced good looks but plus a purpose in life after stumbling into a Reality Room. He fought his way back to the department and, of course, collapsed from the strain. Later he got up again after I&#39;d dosed him with enough fellis juice to put down a gold dragon and helped defend the department.&quot; She shook her head at the man&#39;s insane tenacity, then looked at Suicide again, considering. &quot;You&#39;d like him, I think. He&#39;s a lot like you in some ways, and he could use a proper male friend. Remind me.&quot;<br><br>This was more a note to herself than to him, though, and she pressed on to avoid getting side-tracked.<br><br>&quot;I had to go back to Medical, since more agents were coming in hurt from fighting the Sues. There were battles all over, but the big ones were in the cafeteria and the final stand at the Tomb of the Unknown PPC Agent. The only plan the agents had was to lure as many Sues as possible into the cafeteria and let Honesah&#39;s Daleks blast the hell out of them, and it worked as far as it went. I heard about it from Ilraen, after I found him and Nume standing around in the ward, looking forsaken.&quot;<br><br>At this point, her ability to cover her feelings ended. She cared about everyone she worked with, and she was personally invested in Derik, but those two were her friends, and she&#39;d found them alive after a month of not knowing. Tearing up at the memory was inevitable. She wiped her eyes and kept talking through it, though.<br><br>&quot;They&#39;d seen fighting,&quot; she continued. &quot;After being locked up for a month, they would have faced the Balrog Sue and been happy about it.&quot; She actually laughed. &quot;If you can imagine the two of them charging down the corridors through a sea of Sues to get to the cafeteria, like some kind of screwed up knight and warhorse . . . well, that&#39;s not how Ilraen described it, but he can&#39;t hide anything from me. It can&#39;t have been anything but awkward, and I&#39;m sure he never wants to do anything of the sort again. Nume was a damn mess. He&#39;d got himself thrown from Ilraen&#39;s back and concussed, and he&#39;d been off Bleepka for ten days by Ilraen&#39;s count. Poor guys.&quot; She shook her head, but she had a smile for relief that they were alive and relatively well after the ordeal.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t really know anyone who was involved in the Battle of the Tomb, except Lux, and she&#39;s too flighty to give a good account. That broke the Sues, though. They&#39;d painted it urple and wilver, I heard&quot;—her lip curled at the insult—&quot;and that incited everyone to a huge effort. The rest was just mopping up, and it was finally over.&quot; A puzzled frown crossed her face. &quot;Lux did tell me the agents can-canned to &#39;Man of La Mancha&#39; afterward. Trust Lux to be in the middle of something like that.&quot;<br><br>Shaking her head, she took a deep breath and let it out slowly, then looked up at Suicide again with her eyes still slightly wet. All the same, she looked satisfied at coming to the end. &quot;Any questions?&quot;</p>

            <p>She held it together remarkably well, considering the yarn she was telling. Sure, a story of a victory ought to be good for the one telling it, but even victory could get bloody damned quickly. As she spoke, Suicide felt an old familiar chill touch the back of his neck: the idea of the Sues graffitting a tomb made him wish he <i>had</i> been there, if only to try doing something that Upstairs seriously frowned upon and was technically illegal everywhere except Mississippi. <br><br>He listened &#39;til the end, though. He always had time for stories about battles. Nume pulled through, did he? Good for him; maybe the kid actually had some stones on &#39;im, though Suicide wouldn&#39;t have guessed it by the way he threw a punch. Ilraen . . . the fuzzy centaur was still an unknown quantity, though Suicide made a mental note to not get on the wrong side of him. Derik he&#39;d never met, but he got the impression that it wasn&#39;t a big issue at the moment.<br><br>Jenni&#39;s eyes were still watering. He silently handed her one of the bar napkins.<br><br>&quot;Not really,&quot; he said, once she&#39;d taken a moment to mop her eyes and calm down a little. &quot;Those ghosts sound like they could do with being put to rest. Once a battle&#39;s over and done with, the best thing to do is to honor your dead, burn the corpses of anyone who dared to try and ... with you, and send a few heads back to their leaders to make sure they never try anything like it again.&quot; It occurred to him only after the fact that talking about severed heads might not be the best thing for Jenni to be hearing right then, but another part of him said &#39;... it, catharsis is catharsis.&#39;<br><br>&quot;It sounds like it went as well as it possibly could have,&quot; he continued in a slightly quieter voice. &quot;Unlike the other side, there&#39;s only so many PPC agents to go around.&quot; Three hundred versus ten thousand immortals? Quit thinking like that, Suicide, you can&#39;t blame <i>every</i> way you think on Thermopylae . . . </p>

            <p>Jenni wasn&#39;t the bragging sort, and even if she had been, as a healer her perspective on war was exclusively grim, whether her side won or not. Not that it wasn&#39;t necessary, not that she wasn&#39;t grateful they won, but her work didn&#39;t end when the battle was over. For that reason, even a victorious fight wasn&#39;t something she could truly be happy about. <br><br>With a minimum of fuss, she accepted the napkin and composed herself. Crying was a hell of a way to behave on a date, and the less said about it the better. On the heels of that thought, it struck her Suicide wasn&#39;t shying away or telling her to buck up or anything even the slightest bit marginalizing. That was heartening, and helped her get it together again without feeling humiliated.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; she replied, nodding. &quot;But we lost far more to the macroviruses than we did to the Sues. If not for that I doubt if we would have so much as batted an eye at them before taking them down—it&#39;s not like it&#39;s the first time Sues have tried to come at us directly, after all, and it&#39;s a bad strategy to put us in a position where we have nowhere to go but through them. Not that I know much about strategy,&quot; she added, half-smiling. &quot;That&#39;s just a law of nature.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; Suicide said, his lips quirking a little at the corner. &quot;But the nowhere-to-go-but-through-us strategy loses its appeal when it&#39;s not something you chose to do.&quot; Three hundred Peers, all fathers of sons. <i>Molon labe.</i> &quot;And it&#39;s a lot more fun when you&#39;re on the other side of the line.&quot; Watching the Argives&#39; phalanx crumple while the little bastards shat themselves in terror--that sure <i>had</i> been fun. <br><br>Jenni had left the now-dampened napkin on the bar top, and he swept it up into a pile with the mess he&#39;d made of the coaster. The things someone said and did after a fight weren&#39;t accountable to them later: he&#39;d seen Leonidas himself tremble at the knees, after all. A few tears were nothing, even after some time had passed. <br><br>&quot;Medical must&#39;ve been full, though,&quot; he said, whisking the unpleasant topic of last stands out of sight along with the torn and tear-stained paper. Talking in circles around something that could anger someone (and possibly get you whipped or threatened with pensioning by a pissed-off Peer) was a valuable skill for any veteran squire. &quot;Not that I&#39;d know. I keep meaning to spend more time there--damn hard to keep the field medic skills sharp when nobody will let you practice on them--but every time I try, someone locks the door and tells all the patients to be extra-quiet until I go away.&quot;</p>

            <p>Okay, so running her mouth about tight situations with ridiculous odds had been a stupid error. She should have known better; she knew enough about him to know better. Not something she would allow to happen again unless she decided she <i>wanted</i> to go opening old wounds—which, with her, was always a possibility if she decided the thing hadn&#39;t healed properly and needed purging. But definitely not right now.<br><br>Listening to him and watching his face change, she slipped her hand out from under his and put it on top, curling her fingers around his in a light grip.

The times she could have saved somebody if she&#39;d only had penicillin, or decent needles, or help that didn&#39;t swear by the panacean properties of extensive bloodletting . . . what a nightmare. Still, patients dying was just part of the job. She didn&#39;t like it, but she was able to view it objectively.<br><br>&quot;Still,&quot; she went on contemplatively, &quot;if what I saw of your work with a bandage is any indication, I&#39;d say we could have used you then. Shards, the number of times I personally could have used a big, tough field surgeon stagger the mind. I&#39;ve never been good with massive trauma. The odd broken bone, sure, but there comes a level of severity that takes more than just one woman with a bag.&quot;<br><br>She was rambling on again. How did this keep happening? She reached for her drink, which she&#39;d forgotten temporarily, and drained about half of what was left.</p>

            <p>She was trying to . . . comfort him? A strange idea, not so much wrong or irritating as just plain weird. Suicide couldn&#39;t think of the years he spent as a squire without some emotion, but he&#39;d never gotten so far as to quantify or understand it. Still, the gesture was kindly meant, and Suicide appreciated it. <br><br>This was an odd business all around. So much minutiae; gestures here were small, voices were lower, the tone and inflection of everything was much more important than volume or force. Some of his old skills--like the talking-in-circles bit--were useful, but Suicide felt vaguely like he was out of his depth. It was less like chopping down a tree and more like the delicate work of flaying a man&#39;s arm for a quiver. The smallest nick or misused word could ruin the work before it was half finished, and it made him uneasy in some ways.<br><br>On the other hand, the woman whose company he enjoyed had just called him big and tough. <i>That</i> he could definitely live with. <br><br>&quot;Battle&#39;s a good place to learn medicine,&quot; he responded. Had he been in lots of battles? Why, yes, and he wasn&#39;t above peacocking for her just a bit on that score. Or wait, was a nurse less likely to be impressed by all the injuries he&#39;d inflcited? Shit. Mental Dio, help! &quot;At least, that&#39;s what my masters always said,&quot; he added, while his mental Diocletian told him to leave her alone and sort out his own messes for once. &quot;We didn&#39;t have any of the . . . technically, they&#39;re modern, aren&#39;t they? Present-day?&quot; He grimaced a little at the idea. Not only was he in a different dimension, but Earth was more than two thousand years past his time. &quot;The modern advances everyone here has. We&#39;d douse a man in sour wine to ward off the affluent evils and sacrifice a black dog to Hecate if someone thought his wound was cursed. But you have anesthetic now. We didn&#39;t even have a <i>word</i> for anesthetic.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;Actually, we did. It meant &#39;wineskin and a big rock.&#39;&quot; <br><br>He wondered if that would make her laugh again. Some strange part of him--the one that remembered his mother&#39;s wagon and appreciated Jenni&#39;s hand on his--wanted to make her laugh. It felt odd.</p>

            <p>It did get a laugh, because she&#39;d been there (metaphorically speaking; she&#39;d never actually been to ancient Greece) and knew it for fact. &quot;Yeah, you make due with what you&#39;ve got and hope for the best. That doesn&#39;t change in any time period. The only difference is what you have to work with. Which . . . &quot; Inspired, she took his right hand palm-up and pressed her thumbs into the muscles. &quot; . . . is often just these.&quot; A hand massage could technically be considered the use of wiles, she supposed, but what the hell, it was an enjoyable thing to do and almost universally pleasant for the receiving party.<br><br>&quot;We take them for granted, but without them we&#39;d be entirely other than what we are. Most people don&#39;t even think about the little muscles and tendons in here.&quot; She dug into the narrow spaces between the metacarpals, just to emphasize the point, being sensitive to any irregularities caused by previous injuries. Details and minutiae were something she was quite good at. &quot;Then again, there&#39;s an awful lot of mysticism about the hands. Palm-reading, reflexology and such. Some of it isn&#39;t even total nonsense.&quot;</p>

            <p>Suicide&#39;s pupils dilated as Jenni pressed into a knot below the ball of his thumb, working through the pain and smoothing the muscle into place. His whole arm tensed for a moment, reacting automatically to foreign pressure, but as Jenni worked her magic the hand relaxed and the fingers spread. The Greeks might&#39;ve created Western civilization, but between the hands and the laugh, Suicide&#39;s urges were rapidly tending very uncivilized. <br><br>Nume <i>had</i> said wiles. Suicide mentally marked the kid down for another point. Then he subtracted that point, because Nume had made those wiles sound like a <i>bad</i> thing.<br><br>Jenni was closer than ever, the two of them sitting facing each other while she worked her magic on his one remaining original hand. The left hand, regrown skin over a steel and carbon-fiber skeleton, dropped onto his knee--no, onto her knee, and slid upwards almost independent of thought. The denim fabric of her jeans felt rough: the new skin hadn&#39;t quite gained the protective coating of scars and calluses that the old layer had had. <br><br>The hand stopped at midthigh--barely. It took him about that time to remember that, hello, that wasn&#39;t the way people did things any more. Or was it? He couldn&#39;t remember, not with her turning his muscles to jelly with the skill of a Bacchan whore. Jenni&#39;s smile seemed mischievous. <br><br>&quot;The only thing that separates us from animals,&quot; he said. His grin had an edge to it. &quot;That&#39;s what the scholars say, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

            <p>If her smile tended mischievous, it might have been because she was enjoying watching him melt in front of her like this. No, scratch that. It definitely did, and she definitely was. These were not precisely the clutches Nume had been referring to—he never would have sat still for this much touching to know them—but they definitely fell under the heading. And this was just what she could do with one of Suicide&#39;s hands.<br><br>She was focused on what she was doing with his right, so it took a second or two for the mental proximity alert to go off on his roving left. Her breath hitched slightly when she noticed. Oh ho, so she was really on her game tonight. And he wasn&#39;t lagging behind. Her smile went from mischievous to devious.<br><br>&quot;I think that&#39;s the brain, actually, but who&#39;s counting?&quot; She leaned in just a hair and lowered her voice. &quot;Are you going to let me get on with this, or do we need to go somewhere else?&quot; Unhurriedly, never slacking on kneading the knots away, she glanced down at her thigh and back up again. This was simply to say &quot;I see you hesitating there and I dare you to make up your mind.&quot; As far as she was concerned, civility was overrated, but drawing out the time before plunging into the wilderness had its charms, too.</p>

            <p>Jenni was in trouble in one respect: unless no clothes were involved at all, Suicide was not a believer in delayed gratification. He was right-handed, and Medical or not, the limb had been battered all to hell with the rest of him; what Jenni was doing felt damned good, and he aimed to reciprocate.<br><br>Yes, that expression was definitely mischievous. Ms. Robinson, it seemed, was trying to seduce him. Was he likely to get knifed if he-? Well, only one way to find out.<br><br>He leaned forward (just a little. Not much space between them by that point) and kissed her. He&#39;d spent so much time in Suefics that some part of his mind half expected to taste strawberries, but the only taste that lingered on his tongue was the merest trace of the lime soda she had been drinking. The other senses, on the other hand? The hint of roughness where she&#39;d absentmindedly bitten her own lip, the faint herby smell (tea, perhaps, or something from the infirmary), the sound of her heartbeat . . . was that his hand, creeping up the back of her shirt? Yes, it was.<br><br>As a first kiss, it was definitely not perfect, but it made the point very effective. It might have gotten even better, too--if Dorf the bartender hadn&#39;t broken the spell by rapping hard on the bar and giving them both a stern look. &quot;Not in here, you&#39;re not,&quot; he said flatly. &quot;I just polished the bartop.&quot;<br><br>Suicide stifled an irritated groan. He had automatically tensed when he let Jenni go, his brain remembering similar situations where he&#39;d nearly gotten killed before, but she didn&#39;t seem to be rethinking the knife option. &quot;So what do you think?&quot; he said. He was a little breathless, but there was a glint in his eye. &quot;Your continuum or mine?&quot;</p>

            <p>Well, so much for plan A, then. That was all right. Plan B had been a possibility in her mind from the start, despite her decision not to actively nudge things in any particular direction—which had lasted up until a couple of minutes ago, to her credit. Oh well. Anyone would allow that it was difficult to keep one&#39;s resolve in the face of someone plainly volunteering to be nudged.<br><br>She leaned into the kiss, lifting her hands up to brush the sides of his jaw and neck on the way to cupping the base of his skull with her right hand and stabilizing herself on his shoulder with the other. It was awkward, what with being on the edge of how far the bar stools could support, but worrying about that was secondary to soaking up the sensations of warm, firm muscle under his uniform shirt, his hand on her back, and the musky, masculine scent of him overlaid with the brew he&#39;d swallowed, still on his breath, and an indistinct hint of soap.<br><br>Until Dorf banged on the counter. Startled, she almost lost her balance as they both let go, and she didn&#39;t quite succeed at holding back her own annoyed grumble.<br><br>To Suicide, however, she responded with a grin and a glint of her own. &quot;Hon, I&#39;ll show you around the whole multiverse if you want. For now, though, I did take the precaution of letting the Nursery know they might have Henry overnight, if you don&#39;t mind walking through FicPsych to get to my room.&quot;<br><br>She stood up in preparation for leaving.</p>

            <p>Some asshole with a snarky sense of humor had put &quot;A Whole New World&quot; on the bar&#39;s jukebox. What kind of jukebox even <i>had</i> &quot;A Whole New World&quot; on there, anyway? Suicide did his best to tune it out, which in the end, wasn&#39;t that hard. Jenni had casually passed a comment about why yes, she <i>wasn&#39;t</i> going to have a child possibly interfering with interesting nighttime activities (a good thing, Suicide supposed, since while not a merciful man he had no intention of accidentally turning Henry Robinson into Rorschach Jr.) and stood, one hand disentangling from his. The one simple motion, a smooth rise from the hips through the long line of the spine, had done wonderful things for his admittedly one-track imagination.<br><br>It also triggered some nasty thoughts. There were plenty of things Suicide disliked about his PPC duties, but only one he actively loathed--the way it made him question the reality of something. For a moment, paranoia clutched at his guts: between the universal laws and his myriad experiences with beautiful woman-shaped creatures who were not what they appeared, his survival instinct (yes, he had one, mangled as it was) gave a momentary shriek of panic. He squashed it, silently cursing the reaction, but he knew his body had tensed momentarily at the thought. Hopefully Jenni hadn&#39;t noticed. <br><br>Some great Scythian he was, doubting things simply because he had almost been killed numerous times by selfish would-be gods and goddesses who wanted to control the . . . best not to finish that thought. Simultaneously angry with himself and amused by the whole thing, he slid an arm around Jenni&#39;s waist, pulling her a little closer to him as they stepped out of the bar. She felt real: solid, well-shaped but not unearthly in the way that the fictional worlds often favored. That was good enough for him. No knife, either: that had to count for something. <br><br>“Hang on a second,” he said, stopping Jenni as they reached the first intersection in the halls. “I just want to check something.”<br><br>Suicide was eight inches taller than Jenni, and with both of them standing, he had to bend to kiss her again. Not that it was much of a hardship: she was just the same, the smell and the feel and the lips all too real, leaving him with the exhilarated feeling of being slightly drunk. A passing secretary whistled at them, but though Suicide&#39;s scruples had been satisfied, he didn&#39;t let Jenni go right away. This was a piece of narrative realism he could definitely spend some time lingering over. <br><br>“Sorry about that,” he said finally when they both came up for air. Not that he was actually unhappy with what he&#39;d just done, but Jenni might have objections to being seen doing that kind of thing in the halls. Granted, she didn&#39;t look too unhappy right then. “Definitely,” he added, “all in order.”<br><br>Someone had triumphed <i>akoniti</i>, but he&#39;d be damned if he knew who. </p>

            <p>Mostly, Jenni was just confused, though not at all displeased at being kissed again, whistler or no whistler.

True, her brain was flooded with happy chemicals at the moment, but that didn&#39;t usually stop her from putting two and two together. She had, in fact, noticed when he&#39;d looked just for a moment like he was considering heading for the hills. He wasn&#39;t—what, nervous? That didn&#39;t seem to fit at all.  . . . Shit. Maybe that head trauma <i>was</i> playing up, with the stress—good stress, surely, but still stress—she was putting on his system. Increased heart rate and blood pressure, hormone levels rising, brain sparking away . . . dammit, that would just figure.<br><br>Her expression turned doubtful, and she took a reluctant step back for a better view (though she left her hands where they&#39;d automatically gone around his waist). &quot;Look, uh . . . backpedaling is the last thing I want here, but it&#39;s all fun and games until somebody gets hurt, right? So, actually, that&#39;s the last thing I want. Please tell me if something&#39;s wrong, or if you have doubts, or anything.&quot; This was definitely odd, coming from her to a giant warrior who had just soundly kissed her and seemed happy about it, but then, men could be odd about covering up what was really going on in their heads, physically or psychologically. She smiled and added, &quot;You won&#39;t lose man points or anything. That would be pretty much impossible.&quot; She winked at him.</p>

            <p>Suicide mentally cursed again as Jenni&#39;s words cut through his newfound good mood. For a moment, he contemplated distracting her from the question; he figured he had a 55% chance of managing it, with a remaining 45% chance of it going horribly wrong and pissing her off. With someone he actually liked as much as he did Jenni, those weren&#39;t odds he liked. <br><br>Damn the woman; between her role as a psych nurse and just being who she was, she was infernally hard to contemplate lying to.

He&#39;d lost his taste for any form of drama a long time ago . . . Shit, and he&#39;d gone and left his lampshade back in the RC, too. Damn thing was never there when he needed. &quot;This business of getting close to someone--&quot; He ran one hand up the long smooth curve of her back, admiring the sweep of it &quot;--is a lot simpler when there&#39;s no thinking about universal laws and suchlike.&quot; <br><br>He offered her a wry grin. &quot;Too much time reading the Words, I guess.&quot; <br></p>

            <p>Jenni nodded in sympathy. She personally had a terrible history of complications when it came to getting close, and—she blinked, checking herself. Son of a bitch, she&#39;d just about let it get the better of her, too. Well, nice try, universe, but not this time.

            <p>So much for doubts. Suicide got the idea, and while most of his thoughts that followed were generally incoherent, part of him definitely decided that the height difference was going to be a pain in the neck. His arms were already around Jenni; it was pretty simple to brace his back against the wall of the corridor and, shifting his hands on her hips, lift her up and rest her weight against one cocked leg. Now they were eye-to-eye.<br><br>&quot;<i>Much</i> better,&quot; he murmured against her lips. &quot;Problem solved.&quot; <br><br>Though he didn&#39;t say it, he meant both problems. The gray Generic Surface felt cold against his back, and most of Jenni&#39;s weight rested against his right leg, sending a few phantom pains flickering through the cybernetic limb. There was still the edge of awkwardness between them--the certain caution of two people who didn&#39;t quite know each other yet. But it was <i>real,</i> and there was one hell of a spark there, and Jenni . . . Jenni definitely knew what she was doing. In the middle of word worlds and fiction harpies and author wraiths and gods-damned Archir the Emerald, Suicide finally had his hands on something quantifiably, achingly real. <br><br>Hades&#39; teeth, and there were religions that <i>forbade</i> this kind of business?<br><br>&quot;Apology accepted,&quot; he added after a long moment. Ye gods, he did like green eyes. </p>

            <p>Jenni experienced a little thrill at how easily he plucked her up, like the effort was nothing. The voice of caution pointed out that he could probably do anything he wanted to her without breaking a sweat, and her only recourse would be a use of power, but she had no trouble shushing it. She felt supported and secure in his arms, and she was running the show for the moment. With him doing most of the work of keeping her in place, one hand was free to rake through the hair over his ear, combing it back from his face and adding a little flourish to this kiss.<br><br>The Narrative Laws supplied a passing agent shouting at them to &quot;get a room!&quot; This was summarily ignored.<br><br>And he forgave her balking and almost messing everything up, and took the trouble to say as much. How great was that? &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; she responded with warm smile to match her tone.<br><br>This close, she had to lean her head back to actually focus on his face. The awkwardness of this arrangement was becoming more apparent by the second. She shifted herself and slid back to the floor, then took him by the hand. &quot;Come on. You can&#39;t be comfortable like that. We can do better.&quot;<br><br>She led the way—whatever thoughts she&#39;d entertained about Headquarters, spending the rest of the night (such as it was) in the corridors was not on her agenda—and for a wonder it wasn&#39;t all that long before the double-doored entrance to Section 31 appeared. For an even greater wonder, whoever was supposed to be at the nurses&#39; station had apparently nipped out for the moment, so they were able to slip into room C-14 without any embarrassing run-ins. No doubt the Ironic Overpower was storing up an extra helping of hilarious mishaps for later, but at the moment it wasn&#39;t worth worrying. Not this time, universe, not this time.<br><br>&quot;Well, here we are,&quot; Jenni said once her door was safely closed and locked behind them.<br><br>The room was not large, but she&#39;d arranged the furnishings such that it was effectively divided into a sleeping space at the far end and a working space they&#39;d entered into. Each side had a rug, and she&#39;d found spaces for a few useful plants (the non-sentient sort), which softened the harsh Generic Surface construction. The whole room held the complex herbaceous scent Suicide had noticed on her earlier, emanating in particular from a cupboard above her desk, but there was also a hint of the sweet smell that seemed ubiquitous in the presence of small children. The desk, sitting against the left wall, straddled the midline of the room, with a computer on the office side and a much-used hotplate and tea paraphernalia on the other. Also against the left-hand wall, nearest to them, there was a bookshelf that faced a two-seater couch on the right-hand wall—because what shrink&#39;s office would be complete without a couch?<br><br>The far end of the room showed signs of her hasty departure earlier. In the back right corner, a smallish wardrobe hung open, showing its slightly disheveled contents. Her white jacket hung over one of the doors. A child&#39;s bed sat in front of it against the right wall, with toys haphazardly dropped on top. Jenni&#39;s own bed against the back wall was festooned with a few discarded shirt options and a particularly bedraggled, brown, dragon-shaped plush toy.<br><br>She grinned apologetically. &quot;Uh, sorry about the mess. Give me two ticks to pick up.&quot; She started with the fire-lizard plush, tossing him gently to Henry&#39;s bed.<br><br>(( <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/File:C-14.png">Visual aid!</a> ))</p>

            <p>So this was it: the lair of the beast, the place that would&#39;ve given Nume an aneurysm if he&#39;d known Suicide was in it. It even had a dragon . . . albeit a plush brown one, which somehow didn&#39;t quite carry the level of menace Nume had predicted. <br><br>Jenni seemed a little embarrassed by the little bit of disorder-- a couple of discarded shirts and all that. Yes, she should <i>never</i> be allowed to come back to RC #2771a. Though Mithiriel was constantly on the lookout for disorder, both Suicide and Diocletian were used to living rough, and the socks under the console had recently discovered crop rotation and the three-field system. On the other hand, Jenni&#39;s room looked--well, civilized, for lack of a better word. These were the quarters of a woman who had traveled widely, found herself settling down (perhaps unexpectedly?), and done her best to make do in a limited space. The room fascinated him: so . . . normal. It said that if she&#39;d been from his time, she would have been a respected citizen-woman who wouldn&#39;t have been caught dead with a foreign squire.<br><br>Nah, that wasn&#39;t right. Nobody who ended up with the PPC could qualify as respectable in any time, and he knew already that there were more unusual facets to Jenni than she was owning up to. So why was she fussing about a few pieces of clothing lying around? Who gave a damn about that? <br><br>He crossed the room quickly and wrapped his arms around Jenni again, trailing a kiss down the side of her neck. The sound she made was <i>definitely</i> not respectable, and was infinitely appreciated. <br><br>&quot;Never mind the mess,&quot; he said. A few strands of hair had fallen down over her face, and he flicked them out of the way with his thumb. &quot;I think we&#39;ll manage somehow. But if you&#39;re that worried about it, there&#39;s always--&quot; his hands slid lower, enjoying the sensation of the fabric and smooth skin &quot;--the floor.&quot;<br><br>[TM: . . . smooth, Su. *facepalm* I&#39;m thinking a discretion cut soon?]</p>

            <p>Jenni wasn&#39;t that worried about it. True, she was a woman who liked a certain level of order, and she generally maintained it for the purpose of letting her visitors know that she had everything under control and it was safe to relax. It was a habit she&#39;d acted on without thinking. But of course, that was silly of her.<br><br>If he&#39;d deliberately considered the best place for that kiss, he couldn&#39;t have done better, as her involuntary response proved.

In most cases she woke at first light, but in a place with no sun that didn&#39;t work, so artificial methods had to suffice. Was she a morning person? Well, as a woman who routinely had things to do and places to be, taking advantage of the day just made sense, but she was not offensively chipper about it by any means, especially when it was dragging her from a very good night. The noise wasn&#39;t as loud or annoying as a console&#39;s beep, but in her head she cursed it just as thoroughly as any agent would have done a console. She&#39;d ended up on the inside of the bed somehow—not her usual—so she had to stretch across Suicide to slap the damn thing silent. The brush of warm skin on skin just about made up for it.<br><br>(( Smooth enough, as it happens. *g* ))</p>

            <p>As usual, Suicide&#39;s awakening was accompanied by pain. He vaguely registered the shrilling of an alarm, but that took a distant second to the litany of other standard complaints--mainly joints that didn&#39;t want to move and prior injuries taking the opportunity to remind him of them. The phantom pain of old arrow wounds spread a dull ache across his shoulders.<br><br>On the other hand, Jenni was reaching across him, one arm extended and her chest brushing his as she reached to slap at the alarm. Now that was a good way to wake up. <br><br>Now other aches were making themselves known--aches of the much more preferable kind, the result of a willing and enthusiastic woman who had let him make good on every promise he&#39;d been mentally making since that day in FicPsych. Was he too old for this kind of fooling around? Probably. Did he still feel like Herakles on earth? Definitely. Was he all right with the night being over? Not even a bit.<br><br>&quot;Piss and blood,&quot; he muttered, raising his head from the rumpled pillow and shooting the alarm clock a death glare. Jenni had tried to retreat back to her side of the bed, but he rather preferred her where she was, and made his opinion known by running a hand down her back and grinning up at her. &quot;You don&#39;t have to get up, do you? The patients aren&#39;t gettin&#39; any crazier.&quot;<br><br>((*sigh* Smooth indeed. Sometimes I feel guilty for perpetrating this sleazy mofo. Then I remember how much fun this is and stop it.

            <p>While she was at it, Jenni flicked on the bedside lamp before—retreating? No no. Making some tactical readjustments. Lying half across a chest the size of the former squire&#39;s wouldn&#39;t stay comfortable for long. She settled down on her right side instead, head pillowed on his bicep while her left arm rested across his middle. She couldn&#39;t see very much from this angle, but given the choice between looking and cuddling, she took cuddling. Enthusiastic was a good word for the night&#39;s activities. Now, the path of least resistance had a special appeal.<br><br>&quot;Mm, not as such,&quot; she replied, her voice hazy from sleep. &quot;I mean, I can&#39;t stay here <i>all</i> day . . . as tempting as that is.&quot; Speaking of which, there was no chance that her hands, or at least the free one, would stay still for long, not with so much bare skin available for slow, casual exploration. She didn&#39;t understand how people could be as uptight as most of them were about touching in everyday life. The tactile sense was her favorite, bar none. She couldn&#39;t get enough.<br><br>&quot;G&#39;morning, by the way,&quot; she added, feeling a proper salutation was in order. &quot;Sleep all right? I know I was worn out.&quot; She grinned—even if he couldn&#39;t see her face properly, he could probably feel it against his arm and hear it in her voice. As with the start of the evening, there had been trial and error, and there was room for improvement, but all Powers, learning was fun. </p>

            <p>Mmmmm. The aches were still there, but with Jenni&#39;s soft curves molded against him, they were hardly worth dwelling on. She&#39;d pinioned his left arm quite neatly, especially since the feeling of her lips on the worn skin there was as strong an incentive as possible for not moving. If someone came barging through the door intent on mayhem, Suicide would have to throw her off before he could reach for the knife buried under his discarded clothes. At the moment, though, he was hard-pressed to give a damn.<br><br>(That same knife had provoked a Look from Jenni when she found it hidden in the small of his back last night . . . good times indeed.) <br><br>&quot;Morning to you too,&quot; he said, shifting his weight a little to get comfortable on the rumpled sheets. He gave a slight hiss between his teeth as Jenni&#39;s wandering hand found one of the old disembowelment scars (<i>not</i> a good time) but didn&#39;t tense. That itself was a sign of how relaxed he felt.<br><br>&quot;Slept like the dead,&quot; he added after a long moment. His voice was hoarse and rough; his body simply wasn&#39;t used to getting eight hours any more, especially not after having been so thoroughly worn out beforehand. He pulled Jenni a little closer and ran his right hand over the curve of her hip. &quot;Better than I have in a while, in fact.&quot; A thought struck him, and he couldn&#39;t help grinning a bit himself as he stroked a thumb over Jenni&#39;s hipbone. &quot;In fact, I think I might actually be sane this morning. So technically, you can say you&#39;ve been on the clock this whole time . . . which means you&#39;re about due to come off shift and have some downtime yourself.&quot;</p>

            <p>At the hiss she paused her wandering and propped herself up on her right elbow to scope out what she&#39;d touched. She hadn&#39;t been thinking about wounds and charts, but when she saw the extensive scar below his left ribs, and the others visible across his body, she matched them to the descriptions she&#39;d read. A twinge of empathy momentarily intruded on her calm, but perhaps deliberately, Suicide didn&#39;t allow her time to dwell on it.<br><br>She was happy to snuggle closer. With all the moving around she&#39;d done, despite her best intentions to be lazy, she&#39;d almost completely lost her covering of blankets. She drew up her raised leg and crossed his thigh with it. Her hand went back to gently stroking his chest and abdomen, scars and all, with the occasional detour into light kneading where she sensed it would be appreciated.<br><br>His suggestion about having been on the clock got an all-too-ironic laugh. &quot;Well, I&#39;m glad, but . . . no . . . I don&#39;t think my bosses would approve at all. Shards, <i>I</i> wouldn&#39;t approve. Confusing business with pleasure is one sin I managed to avoid, and here you are encouraging me.

            <p>You&#39;re supposed to wait a month before asking Permission to get to know everyone, read the Original Series, some of the spinoffs, and some of the wiki.<br><br>After at least a month, you can come up with Agents (make a profile of them, while also giving the board a writing sample so they know you can write decently) and bring up a crappy fanfic that need to die.

            <p>There was a discussion recently on making the guidelines on Permission somewhat clearer, and one thing that went was the hard-and-fast one month waiting period.<br><br>See here: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission#Q._When_should_I_ask_for_permission.3F"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission#Q._When_should_I_ask_for_permission.3F">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission#Q._When_should_I_ask_for_permission.3F</a></a><br><br>The basic idea (as far as I understand it) is that it&#39;s about interaction, not time.

            <p>So, the Survey has dropped off the front page, I&#39;ve compiled all the data, and now it&#39;s time to see what&#39;s what. Your response, my fellow PPCers, was overwhelming - 50 people replied, which is incredible. Whatever happens, at least we know the PPC spoke together.<br><br>Since this is a summary, not all the details you wrote will find their way in. I think that&#39;s a real shame - some of your responses were truly heartfelt - but that&#39;s the way it is. This was an anonymous survey, and I&#39;m afraid someone who&#39;s around more often than I am could probably identify a lot of you from what you wrote.<br><br>I&#39;m not going to be using graphs, I&#39;m afraid - multiple-choice questions don&#39;t lend themselves to that end very well. I&#39;ll give a brief summary of each table at the end of its section.<br><br><b><u>1. Roles of the PPC</u></b><br><br><i>What role do you think a) the whole PPC, b) the PPC Board, c) the PPC IRC, d) the PPC Wiki should fulfil?</i><br><br><b>Whole PPC</b>: Killing &amp; mocking badfic (26), social interaction/fun (12), concrit for us (9), concrit for badfic authors (8), community feeling (6), sharing fanfic (5), none (1).<br><br>I&#39;ve compressed a heck of a lot into &#39;social interaction&#39; up there, but hopefully it gets the point across.<br><br><b>PPC Board</b>: Social interaction/fun (27), bulletin board (23), answering questions (6), the &#39;Home&#39; of the PPC (6), community feeling (5), organised changes to the PPC (5), sharing fanfic (3), games (3), concrit for us (2), collective knowledge (1), making things official (1).<br><br>&#39;bulletin board&#39; refers to mission updates, introductions, and giving permission, and anything else of that ilk.<br><br><b>IRC</b>: Social interaction/fun (32), rapid responses (11), I don&#39;t use it (10), games (4), community feeling (2), mocking badfic (1).<br><br>The IRC just wins out over the Board as a host for social interaction. On the other hand, one in five people went out of their way to say they don&#39;t use it.<br><br><b>Wiki</b>: Collective knowledge (47), answering questions (3), making things official (2).<br><br> ... so we know what a Wiki is, then? :P<br><br>A lot of people had fairly strong opinions here, specifically about how the Board should only be used for bulletins while all the real social stuff goes on in the IRC. That clearly isn&#39;t the case, since more than half of the group think the Board is also a social hub. Perhaps we need to work on that, though, since a fair number of us don&#39;t seem to see that. ... oh, and no, I did <i>not</i> spell &#39;fulfil&#39; wrong, thank you very much. One L is English, two is a foolish colonial corruption.<br><br><b><u>2. What would you change?</u></b><br><br><i>What changes, if any, would you make to a) the whole PPC, b) the Board, c) the IRC, d) the Wiki?</i><br><br>(&#39;None&#39;, by the way, is only people who specifically said &#39;none&#39;. Not replying doesn&#39;t count)<br><br><b>Whole PPC</b>: None (13), more fun (6), more respect (4), changes to Permission (3), emphasis on teaching (3), less bound by precedent (2), more collaborations (2), more missions by oldbies (1), more initial information (1), no flaming writers (1), less possessiveness (1), less drama (1), avoid mega-crossovers (1), more whole-group decisions (1).<br><br>Someone specifically wanted more collab missions, because how likely is it that our agents never bump into each other? Which is a good point. Filed under &#39;teaching&#39; is my favourite suggestion of the entire survey: a writing workshop. I have no idea how it would be done, but I think it&#39;s a fantastic idea.<br><br><b>The Board</b>: Change the layout (28), none (13), more fun (2), no serious issues discussed (1).<br><br>Yeah, this was always going to be the difficult one. Turns out two thirds of the PPC want to leave the old Board in one way or another. I&#39;ll emphasise that this covers everything from sticky threads to subforums to logging in (which you already can - not that it does anything), to no adverts. Several of them even said &quot;I don&#39;t want to leave this one, except for...&quot;. But yeah. I see an old debate coming up again...<br><br><b>IRC</b>: None (15), less drama (11), more controlled (5), less controlled (3), more respect (3), more fun (2), more initial information (1), no serious issues (1).<br><br>So how can you make the IRC both more and less controlled by authorities? Beats me. The &#39;initial information&#39; here, by the way, is referring essentially to the stuff given to new arrivals - the rules of the IRC, and the Links people are given on-Board. I also think it&#39;s worrying that both here and under &#39;whole PPC&#39;, people said they didn&#39;t feel they were being respected as equals. That is wrong, ladies and gentlefish, just wrong.<br><br><b>Wiki</b>: None (20), more comprehensive (11), more fun (2), less bound by precedent (2), less complicated to update (2), easier to browse (1), no ads (1).<br><br>A couple of people mentioned the precedent thing; one person referred to it as &#39;the altar of our history&#39;. Their point was that the PPC is supposed to be a fun, creative exercise - you shouldn&#39;t end up checking every decision you make in a mission against the Wiki. I happen to agree.<br><br>The three main issues to come out of this section were: 1) the format of the Board, 2) the IRC drama, and 3) the lack of organisation and complete information on the Wiki. That last is, I suspect, part of the nature of a Wiki.<br><br><b><u>3. Permission</u></b><br><br><i>How do you think Permission should be given?</i><br><br>My table for this question has mysteriously vanished, due I suspect to tiny hands and a shiny &#39;Off&#39; button. However, from memory, most people said Permission was fine the way it is. A fair number wanted a shorter wait, or at least flexibility (someone mentioned that people can be told no-one knows who they are, when in fact they&#39;ve been massively active in the IRC). Additionally, a few people mentioned that more emphasis should be placed on the writing sample.<br><br><i>How should Permission Givers be chosen?</i><br><br>General election (18), based on writing quality (11), based on time with the PPC (10), everyone who passed a certain point (6), based on community knowledge (5), current PGs select (4), more needed (2).<br><br>A few points here. The general election is how we currently do it, and we do take their writing quality and time with the PPC (and their community participation) into account. Six people said everyone who has reached a certain stage (years in the PPC, number of missions, whatever) should be a PG automatically. The number saying we need more is low, but several people mentioned it in the hats question, so it&#39;s probably worth looking into.<br><br>One thing that came up in all three Permission questions (we&#39;ll get to the hats later) was getting more than one response. One person suggested massive numbers of new PGs, but there was another response which caught my eye. The suggestion was that anyone can comment on whether a request should be granted Permission. Then, if four non-PGs say it should, it has Permission - <b>unless</b> a PG gives a reason otherwise. Since we manage to get four responses to most requests, this would make it easier to get Permission if the PGs are busy - but we can still pop in and check if we feel the need. Again, it was just an idea someone had.<br><br><b><u>4. Personal Responses</u></b><br><br><i>What do you hope to get out of the PPC?</i><br><br>Community (30), fun (20), write missions (15), reading material (14), improve writing (12), concrit (9)<br><br>... Protectors, you bring warm fuzzy feelings to my heart. You seriously do. This is why I joined the PPC to begin with - to read the missions, to write, and most of all for the community feeling. It&#39;s fun, it&#39;s friendly - the PPC is a community I&#39;m proud to be a part of, and a canon I&#39;m proud to be able to contribute to.<br><br><i>How do you think you can get the most out of the PPC?</i><br><br>Participate (21), write missions (20), read missions (12), concrit (7), the IRC (6), have fun (3), cooperative writing (1).<br><br>This is where the old guard need to pay attention: for some people, the IRC is how they interact with the PPC. Just like how we&#39;re all (still!) stuck thinking &#39;PPC Mission&#39; means &#39;Killing &#39;Sues&#39;, we sometimes get to thinking &#39;PPC&#39; means &#39;PPC Board&#39;. It doesn&#39;t. The IRC is part of the community too - not one we all visit, nor have to (I don&#39;t), but it&#39;s there, and it&#39;s why the Board isn&#39;t as social as it used to be.<br><br>I think this has been a truly informative survey. It may or may not lead to action, but it&#39;s certainly taught <i>me</i> a heck of a lot. Thank you all very much for participating. Let&#39;s do it again in another eight years.<br><br>h[BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!]<br><br>What do you mean, there&#39;s still a question left?<br><br><b><u>5.

            <p>I&#39;m a bit rushed right now, as I&#39;m going to be going to a July 4th party, but let me scribble out some initial thoughts: <br><br>I&#39;m glad you posted this now, as I was getting impatient to discuss what was going on with the IRC. A bit ago Neshomeh closed down the IRC channel for a week, which upset me because It wasn&#39;t obvious who decided it, what it&#39;s intended goal was, and whether this could happen again, arbitrarily, by people that aren&#39;t even regular participants in the IRC.<br><br>We definitely need more PGs. There were a few times where I had given some concrit for some Permission Requests and wound up trying to pm permission givers to take a look at them because they were close to being dropped off the front page with no comment from any PGs.<br><br>On the subject of precedent: precedent is probably the major reason I haven&#39;t done any missions yet, as I still haven&#39;t completed reading the Original Series. I haven&#39;t read it because I don&#39;t particularly like it. I&#39;m not a big fan of killing sues, I&#39;m not big on LotR, nor am I particularly invested in Jay or Acacia&#39;s characters. Obviously I still like the PPC - I read and enjoy many missions, just not the ones that are embodied by the OC.

            <p>I asked Neshomeh to close down the IRC.<br><br>Why? Because from where I was sitting, things were rapidly devolving into terminal levels of stupidity.

            <p>&quot;maybe even permanent damage to the community.&quot;<br><br>^ That&#39;s kind of what the crux of my problem with shutting down the IRC. The IRC isn&#39;t considered part of the community, in spite of what we found in the survey which says that the IRC is now a <i>major hub</i> of the community. Shutting it down, even temporarily, should be no more an option then shutting the board down - especially not by a handful of members in private. <br><br>Neshomeh maintained that it was a &#39;voluntary&#39; shut down, enforced by her pressing on anyone who didn&#39;t leave how disappointed she was in them, personally, for not going along with this decision that they weren&#39;t involved in. <br><br>* * *<br><br>I was hesitant to weigh in on the proposed IRC rules on the wiki because I was not witness to most of the drama that Dann mentions - or perhaps I have been witness to the drama so long that I&#39;ve become desensitized to it. But just going off of what he summarizes [[The amounts of talking behind peoples backs, quoting of chat logs, willful ignorance, and general Drama]], the proposed rules changes (which were in general already in place) would not fix any of those. <br><br>If I wasn&#39;t clear in the last paragraph let me restate: I am by no means completely aware of all that went on leading up to the shutdown of the chat, but from what I <i>did</i> see, a lot of the drama was coming from the implementation of a new set of rules that VM and July were trying to implement to reduce the amount of chatspeak (specifically &#39;lol&#39;) used in the chat. This is probably what the &#39;fewer rules&#39; comments on the survey amounted to. &#39;More rules&#39; probably refers to what Dann is talking about in terms of enforcing civility. <br><br>What also needs clarity is who is supposed to enforce the rules - is everyone supposed to have op? Is there a democracy everytime an issue comes up? If we have appointed ops, who will they be, and who resolves a dispute between ops? A recurring problem in the IRC is, in my experience, is one of authority and final say in such disputes. <br><br>* * *<br><br>I also want to conclude this post by saying that if I&#39;m the only one interested in speaking up on this issue then this is the last I&#39;ll say about it. The lack of activity in this thread seems to indicate that to be the case. </p>

            <p>The crux of the issue which ended with the #PPC shutdown was the existence of IRC channel #PPC2, and the manner by which the people on it were informing people of its existence - specifically, there were a lot of people who, through accident or malice, were not told. Be it through coincidence or intention, a lot of the people who would be against the existence of something that could be perceived as a secret chatroom (myself, VM, Makari, Neshomeh, etc) were not informed of its existence either.<br><br>The way in which its existence generally came to light was also Dramatic in the utmost - lots of he-said, she-said, I-have-logs-that-say, etc.<br><br>&quot;lol&quot; was a tiny thing that got blown hugely out of proportion, one in an entire list of tiny things that have gotten blown hugely out of proportion on the IRC. What that boiled down to, IIRC, was July said &quot;Hey, would you knock it off with the chatspeak&quot; to someone who had said &quot;lol&quot; repeatedly in a few minutes, and then a large number of people interpreted it in the Worst Possible Way.<br><br>That was why I stepped in. Because every tiny little inconsequential thing was getting blown wildly out of proportion, more and more frequently, and more and more violently.<br><br>And no, the rule changes are not about straight-up blocking off drama, because that won&#39;t work. Rules cannot address the root cause of drama. The rules that I proposed are intended to act as control rods - to put the dampers on hot-button issues like defining where the boundaries are, and how they should be enforced (both of which have been prominent in the molehills-to-mountains processes that I&#39;ve seen). Drama is not going to disappear, the whole point is to get the IRC into a situation where drama tends to evaporate rather than building up and exploding.<br><br>And yes, I definitely need to go through and define the responsibilities of Designated Arbiters, and on whom the pressure of enforcing things ends up falling.<br><br>We&#39;ve done quite well as an organization for a very long time with a basically nonexistent authority system. Unfortunately, &quot;be nice to each other&quot; seems to have not worked on the IRC, so we may have to write some things down.</p>

            <p>While it&#39;s not my place to respond to much of this, seeing as it concerns people who are fully capable of speaking for themselves, there are a few things that rankled here. First of all, Bronwyn put a post up about the IRC... what, a week ago? Longer, even. If you were that impatient, you could&#39;ve responded to that thread, or any number of the threads coming off of it about how to fix things. Or, for that matter, the post that spawned this survey, wherein people tried to discuss what could be done about the IRC/Board rift. <br><br>I also take issue with your &quot;trying to pm permission givers to take a look at them.&quot; I <i>read</i> every request on this page as soon as it comes up. (Well. As soon as it comes up and I have ten or fifteen minutes to spare.) And if I don&#39;t know the continuum, and/or the writing sample doesn&#39;t move me strongly, I wait a few days to see if someone else has an opinion. Every now and then, someone pokes me on the IRC to go &quot;Hey, there&#39;s like three requests, go do something about it.&quot; Usually it&#39;s JulyFlame, sometimes it&#39;s you, sometimes Makari and I have a mutual flailing session because she&#39;s not used to this yet either.<br><br>As I said, much of this I don&#39;t feel comfortable addressing, but it bothers me to have you basically say that you haven&#39;t read the full series we&#39;re based on, you&#39;re not interested in researching our continuum before you add to it, but somehow we&#39;re not doing a good enough job with permission requests.</p>

            <p>First off, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t get a chance to do this until now. Lack of anything approaching regular internet at camp will do that. Second, I agree with DS and Phobos on the need for more PGs. One thing I wrote in the survey expressed a desire for faster response times on Permission requests. Secondly, I agree with DS on the original series to a point. It is very narrow in the interest range it covers, it is not the best written work in the PPC, and if you aren&#39;t a big LoTR fan, it can be hard to get through. (I couldn&#39;t give you specific numbers, but some of the original missions were hard for me to get through. And I&#39;m at least a moderate fan.) <br><br>However...<br><br>They are not badly written, at all, and they set the tone that most persons who write try to use.<br><br>So... I&#39;m having trouble drawing a conclusion here. On the one hand, I understand where DS is coming from. On the other hand, well, I understand why it&#39;s a good idea to read the Original Series, even if you don&#39;t like parts of it. I guess what I&#39;m saying is... uh, I don&#39;t know, but I hope both of you better understand where the other person is coming from. </p>

            <p>You&#39;re objection to my comment about PG&#39;s only affirms my point: that we need more PG&#39;s that have more experience with various fandoms so that you personally don&#39;t /have/ to be there all the time to review every permission request (particularly with often they are coming). <br><br>As for the old threads - I could have added nothing to the conversation /then/ that had not already been said better by others. I was more concerned that nothing had been said /since/ then, and the closing and reopening of the IRC had occured without comment on the board. The comment was primarily to say that I&#39;m glad this thread came up so I could voice my concerns. I apologize if it came off more coarse and irritated then I intended.<br><br>As for the Original Series - it&#39;s just that, the series that the PPC is currently <i>based</i> on. I like the PPC for many of the elements that have evolved <i>since</i> the original series. Would you fault someone for liking the Expanded Universe of star wars that didn&#39;t quite like the original trilogy? The Original Series has a very narrow, laser thin demographic - Mary Sues in Lord of the Rings fics. The PPC now has a large number of departments and covers a large number of fandoms - the OC may have come first but it&#39;s hardly the best writing of the PPC and it simply doesn&#39;t appeal to my tastes. </p>

            <p>Let&#39;s make sure this can&#39;t possibly get nasty, okay? And that&#39;s not directed at you or anyone in particular, just the situation. <br><br>To continue your <i>Star Wars</i> metaphor, I certainly wouldn&#39;t fault anyone for not liking the original trilogy, but I would raise an eyebrow if they claimed to be a big fan of the Expanded Universe and had never even <i>seen</i> the movies. No matter how diverse spin-offs become, the original core story is still the anchor that holds them all together and which began it all, and I&#39;m completely with VM in that I don&#39;t feel comfortable with you - or anybody, it&#39;s not personal - making these sorts of statements without having read it all yourself. I admit, I don&#39;t quite see <i>how</i> it can feel like homework, but organising PG appointments and answering Permission requests isn&#39;t always fun, either - part of being a PG is that we do these things for the community even when we&#39;d really rather (or simply have to) be doing something else. <br><br>Also, I&#39;m going to apologise in advance if I come off sounding snappish or irritated myself - I know I have a tendency to do so. It&#39;s not intentional. </p>

            <p>I think that Permission is mostly fine the way it is. However, the &quot;one-month rule&quot; should be adjusted into a &quot;one-month guideline&quot;, in order to make permission more flexible (which is what many people want to do). That is, instead of saying &quot;Hang around for at least a month.&quot;, say something like, &quot;Hang around long enough for people to get to know you. That <i>usually</i> takes at least a month.&quot; This change would make &quot;one month&quot; less of a time limit, since looking at the result summary shows that many Boarders think fixed time limits aren&#39;t a great idea.<br><br>As for &quot;less bound by precedent&quot;, I agree. Precedent is useful, but you shouldn&#39;t <b>HAVE</b> to follow it. The PPC is supposed to be fun (and not SRS BSNS), and becoming too tied up in what was done before gets in the way of that. So, I think that the new PPC policy on precedent should be, &quot;It&#39;s good to follow precedent, but if you think of something better/funnier, feel free to use that instead.&quot; Of course, TOS is the closest thing we have to a canon around here, so breaking with that should be discussed (a bit) before going ahead.<br><br>Thanks for slogging through my (rambly) two cents.</p>

            <p>Cheers, hS, for organising this. It&#39;s immensely helpful. On most points I don&#39;t have much to say, save that it&#39;s interesting to see the different viewpoints, however...<br><br>Reagrding PG selection, I agree with Phobos on pretty much all points. The idea that Permission can be granted automatically if four non-PGs say it should... I&#39;m not comfortable with it, not because I don&#39;t trust the majority of people around here to make good judgements, but because off the top of my head I can think of at least four who have been on this board in the past few years who would, it seems, support just about anyone, and that undermines the entire point. Also, if there aren&#39;t enough active PGs around, then someone might find themselves getting Permission by default only to have PG turn up later and say (or just think), &quot;Actually... this really isn&#39;t up to standards.&quot; And it would hurt more feelings to be told to stop afterwards than beforem, which is the last thing we want.<br><br>As for the hats - well, hS, you did ask for it. ;)<br><br><br><small>(For the record, I <i>am</i> sorry for not being here and looking at Permission requests more often. I try. I fail, but I do try. This entire post has put me on a massive guilt trip, and I feel awful, but even that can&#39;t slow time down, and I&#39;m just too busy. So... to everyone whose Permission requests could have been answered by me if I&#39;d been around, and to every PG who&#39;s had to do twice as much work because of it, I am sorry!)</small></p>

            <p>Thank you, hS, for all the work you did on this.  It is much appreciated.<br><br>Responses to the responses:<br><br>The Wiki: the only way to make it more comprehensive is if people step in to help.  So it looks like we have 11 volunteers.  I will say, however, that not everything needs a page of its own.  A minor character that had one line in one mission and who had little characterization in that time, for instance, does not need a page.  The same goes for gadgets, characters, and continua that have not made an appearance yet in the PPC.<br><br>The IRC:  I feel there is a minimum of control in there already.  However, if you feel I am not correct in this, or you have ideas on how to make it less controlled, I am willing to discuss it.  I personally think more control is needed, along the lines that were being discussed down the board.<br><br>Permission:  That someone can be active in the IRC and still get the &quot;we don&#39;t know who you are&quot; reason is a little laughable.  I know that Dann, VM, and (to a lesser extent) Nesh are all in the IRC.  The problem is, Nesh is really the only PG that answers permission requests.  VM answered one of the 5 that came up this week, so I will let her off the hook a little.  We need permission givers that will actually give permission.  I don&#39;t remember the last time some of them replied to a permission request.  This is a major problem that I think bears discussing.<br><br>However, I think that giving everyone the ability to give permission is a bad way to go.  The point of a PG is that the community picks people that they respect to make good decisions.  If we give everyone the ability to grant permission, then it would likely result in a full vote being taken for every permission request, to make sure that we all agree.  Representative Democracy (PGs) vs Democracy (Everyone can give permission).<br><br>Giving everyone PG status after a certain point also seems like a bad plan to me.  If we base it on how long they are here, then we could potentially have some people introduce themselves to us and disappear for a while then grant permission when they show back up after a year of being gone.  If we base it on mission count, then we have to take away VM&#39;s PG status, as I don&#39;t believe she has written any missions.<br><br><br><br><br>On a not-related-at-all note: hS, are you in charge of Fanficland?  I have a fever, and the only prescription is the Badfic Game.  It should be about that time, I think.  I just hope it happens before the end of July, because once August hits I have no time.</p>

            <p>to answer the answers.<br>A few points I found:<br>Role of the whole PPC: IMO, I&#39;ve always seen &#39;kill &amp; mock&#39; and &#39;have fun&#39; to go hand in hand (I hope I can make myself clear in this!). By that I mean that if you don&#39;t have fun while mocking a badfic, and take it as a completely serious business, I guess (again, IMO) you&#39;re missing the point. PPC is just as serious as SRS BSNS.<br>Changes (in general): I find this concept of &#39;less bound by precedent&#39; strange, because it&#39;s not so difficult to add a new concept to the PPC. I for one wanted to add a new disease, Author Note Shock or ANS, for those times when A/N are really stupid. I looked up on the Wiki and found that nothing of the sort existed, so I dropped to the IRC and asked if it was ok; some people agreed, the other didn&#39;t say they were against it, so I&#39;ll use the ANS in my mission. But it also depends on what you want to add or delete.<br>I&#39;m also totally amazed by the &#39;more &amp; less controlled&#39; IRC. I don&#39;t get it either.<br>The layout of the Board: I like this one; I usually get lost in the &#39;subforum&#39; type.<br>And last, the &#39;respect-drama&#39; issue. I guess this thing has to do with people, because I can&#39;t imagine all PPCers against a single person, so nothing can be done unless we start to expell people; and that wouldn&#39;t be a solution either.<br>Hats: cover them in sprakling glitter and eat them is unhealthy, unless the glitter&#39;s properly treated to make it edible</p>

            <p>The bound by precedent thing is my attempt to sum up a complex concept. Basically, what they&#39;re saying is that we used to run into a problem in a mission and think our way through it (with appropriate attention to the Rule of Funny). Nowadays, the response is more likely to check the Wiki or ask someone, to find out if there&#39;s already an answer. That&#39;s pretty much what you did - why? Once you&#39;re given Permission, you have exactly the same writing power as anyone else. It&#39;s only a recent thing that people would even think of asking (case in point - when Tawaki killed off Makes-Things, he just did it, and caused no end of debate).<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: As a general comment to anyone replying to my original post - I&#39;m just summarising what the reviews said. If you object strenuously to something in it, it wasn&#39;t <i>me</i> who said it. (Not meaning you, Sonne, just making sure it&#39;s written down somewhere) ~hS</p>

            <p>Meh, it&#39;s not <i>too</i> bad to bash Twilight, but when said basher is the child of two (specified to be) <i>human</i> male Hetalia characters and somehow still has greater strength and the like than the sparkle vampires it&#39;s not that good. It was also twisting the Twilight canons OOC, as far as I could tell. That was my main problem with it, I guess. (Since it&#39;s meant to be a parody, perhaps it would be something the DBP would handle.) In other words, sometimes bashing, when minor, can be humorous, but you put in too much along with other badfic elements and it&#39;s just bad period. <br><br>And for the other Twilight x APH crossover, you really don&#39;t need much knowledge of the Twilight continuum. The only thing I saw in there that was Twilight related was someone with the name of Esme (who is certainly <i>not</i> the Esme from Twilight). </p>

The point is that after the neuralyzing he should only remember Hermione and the rest as characters in a series of books.

            <p>Fun times are had with that mission! I LOL&#39;d at the angel part.<br><br>Just as a bit of advice: whenever someone puts up a mission, they usually update the Wiki with the mission, then the pages for the continua, then the pages for the agents themselves, and... you get the point.<br><br>I had one small gripe, though: I felt like a lot of it was just skimming through with RMC telling Mittens what to write down. I think it&#39;s better if both agents chime in with charges, getting some more banter going about the nature of the charge they&#39;re talking about. You got the stuff about what the fic does to the canon down really well, though, so... Yeah.<br><br>Good first mission! I can&#39;t wait to see more (and especially that Dragon Age fanfic you said you were gonna spork).</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve actually been busy updating the wiki with the mission and profiles and stuff. There is actually a ton to update, at least the first time. o_O<br><br>I know that Mittens is leaning heavily on the RMC in the mission. As he learns about the different continua he will be able to participate more equally, but for now, he is a bit lost.</p>

Since he&#39;s a mini robot villain based on an &#39;80s series, any owner will need to promise to feed him a diet of pure evil, and not expose him to too much complex characterization. </p>

            <p>(I just want you to know that I almost signed my name as my badfic alter ego.

He doesn&#39;t strike me as a cinnamon kind of guy.”<br><br><br><br><br>“What&#39;s a ninja?”<br><br><br>“Basically? You, less drunk.”<br><br><br><br><br>“Cheer up, Dio. It&#39;s short.”<br><br><br>Diocletian was not cheered.<br><br><br>“It&#39;s a continuum full of often-shirtless soldiers.”<br><br><br>Diocletian was partially cheered.<br><br><br><br>The walls began to ooze with sar-plasm,<br><br><br><br><br>“It&#39;s a bad guy,” Suicide explained, patting the mini on the head. “A bad guy from a cartoon universe, no less. Well done, Sargeant Commander! Keep up the goo--bad work, and I&#39;ll get you a baby seal to skin.”<br><br><br><br><br>Also, I really liked that the Sue&#39;s blood was olive green glitter.  Perfect touch for a military Sue.  Man that type of ignore all military protocol Sue is annoying! I run across them sometimes in Stargate.  <br><br>Anyway, thanks for the entertaining mission!</p>

            <p>My theory is that half of DoSAT&#39;s tech is recycled out of the other half of DoSAT&#39;s tech, so the I imagined the Fictionary being a cobbled-together product of that. Plus, you just know they would have originally found a way to make Gameboys explode anyway. :D</p>

            <p>I&#39;m certain there&#39;s more Pocket Fictionaries; they&#39;re probably rare, since DoSAT seems to be still experimenting with them, but I&#39;m sure agents could wrangle a couple if it really warranted it.

            <p>Today I received an emaill* from an old friend of many people on this Board - the Admin at <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/">Fanfic Land</a>. He** said this:<br><br><i>Greetings, loyal fans!<br><br>As you may have noticed last year, we had a certain amount of difficulty at Fanfic Land. Specifically, none of your marvellous pieces of PPC fanfiction were uploaded correctly... or, in fact, at all! There is a reason for this, and it&#39;s a good one.<br><br>Last year, you see, we suffered from a hostile takeover. I mean really hostile - soldiers from the Principality of Liechtenstein stormed our offices and took our staff hostage, mere minutes after I invited you all to come back to our site. They shot Roderick the tea-boy, and I think Arnold who ran our servers was sold into slavery in Monaco.<br><br>It has been a year, but I have finally managed to gain access to the internet again - aren&#39;t iphones wonderful? Most of our captors speak very little English (several only know the phrase &quot;Ve haf vays ov makink you talk!&quot;), but I have managed to ascertain that they believe our website to be a foolish frivolity which no-one would ever go to. They&#39;ve even said that if we were popular, they wouldn&#39;t have done this (that, or they were discussing pizza).<br><br>And so I turn to you, loyal friends, my last and only hope. If the minions of Prince so-called Hans-Adam II see that the fandoms we serve are truly popular, perhaps - perhaps! - they will release us. And so I call upon you, fans of the PPC, to write like you have never writed before. I know you love this fandom - now prove it! Fanfiction is the greatest form of art in the world! Prove it!<br><br>~FfL Admin</i><br><br>... or in other words, it&#39;s time for the <b>PPC Badfic Game 2011</b>.<br><br>It&#39;s a simple game - we spend our time fighting against badfic, but the PPC too is a fandom, and fandoms have badfic. Since for some reason we don&#39;t have a section on FF.net, it&#39;s up to us to write our own.<br><br>Everyone on the Board is invited to take part - this game does not affect PPC canon, and therefore does not require Permission. The rules are simple - write badfic of the PPC. Use any agents or Flowers you like (with the usual exception of Stormsong and Skyfire - don&#39;t use them), and don&#39;t worry about keeping them in-character - this is <i>badfic</i> we&#39;re talking about. Make it a Mary-Sue, Bad Slash, Implausible Crossover - anything you want. Then post it in this thread under a suitably badfic-author-y name. (Note that this is for characters in the PPC, not Boarders - that&#39;s a <i>different</i> game).<br><br>You can (indeed, you&#39;re encouraged to) leave reviews of other people&#39;s stories - in character with your new name, naturally. Don&#39;t be afraid to flame - we&#39;re all badfic authors for this thread. Equally, don&#39;t be upset by someone flaming you - it&#39;s all part of the game (and go ahead and write a review or author&#39;s note in reply!). Remember <b>this is not real</b> - nothing said in-character reflects people&#39;s normal opinions of you.<br><br>For some examples of previous years&#39; badfics, visit the <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/Page1.htm">PPC section</a> of Fanfic Land. As the Admin said, there isn&#39;t anything from 2010 up - Liechtenstein rather got in the way - and there won&#39;t be anything from this year, either. Sorry, guys - but enjoy the game!<br><br>(If it&#39;s still going strong when it drops off the front page, we can start a new thread no problem)<br><br>hS<br><br>*Like an email, except for not really existing<br><br>** <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_pronoun#Summary">/She/It/They/One/Ne/E/Ey/Hu/Hy/Ot/Yt/Thon/Ve/Xe/Ze/Zhe/En/Co/Phe/Per</a></p>

            <p>[[The first chapter is not very NSFW, but later chapters will be.]]<br><br>&quot;Just relax and sink deeper into sleep,&quot; said a soothing female voice.  &quot;We are going to that part of your self where you hide your reserves of strength.  It is deep down inside of you, but it is there.&quot;<br><br>The sleeping Elf&#39;s subconscious mind ventured into the deep places of itself, away from the light of the world.<br><br>&quot;Deep down,&quot; continued the female voice.  &quot;When you find that pool of emotional strength you need to open the gates that keep it locked away and let some of it come out.&quot;<br><br>The Elf saw the pool of strength through his mind&#39;s eye.  It looked like a lake of seething fire.  He saw the gate, as well.  It was massive.  How could he ever achieve such a monumental task as opening that gate?<br><br>&quot;I know this is difficult for you,&quot; said the voice, even more soothing than before, &quot;but you can do this.  Reach inside and free yourself.&quot;<br><br>The Elf&#39;s hands twitched and clicked as he lay on the leather couch.  In his mind he had positioned himself in front of the gate and was pulling on the huge structure.  It was impossible that this could work.  Impossible...until the gate gave a lurch and swung open with a force that took the Elf by surprise.  He was caught up in a river of molten fury.<br><br>&quot;Ithalond?&quot; called the woman&#39;s voice.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong?  Wake up!  Come back to me, Ithalond!&quot;<br><br>Ithalond felt himself drowning in the river of his own repressed strength.  He was was being swept away in the current.  While his body thrashed on the couch, his mind fought for the surface.  The raging torrent was too much for him.  He was going to succumb to the river&#39;s rage when it thrust him into the waking world.<br><br>Ithalond&#39;s eyes opened to the sight of a worry-stricken Jenni Robinson.  Tears were running down her cheeks, but she seemed to be relieved at his awakening.  &quot;Thank goodness,&quot; she said while wiping a tear from the corner of her eye.  &quot;You had me worried for a... Ithalond, are you all right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;How could you?&quot; spat the Elf.  There was a rough edge to his voice that Jenni had never heard before.  He pulled himself into a sitting position, his cybernetic hands clutching the edge of the couch, puncturing the leather.  &quot;You allowed them to keep me <i>ALIVE</i>!  After what I&#39;d been through?!&quot;  He stood up cunvulsively and found that his hands were at the beautiful doctor&#39;s throat.  A manic smile crept onto his face as he squeezed.<br><br>Jenni thrashed in his grip, attempting to free herself from the crazed Elf.  Try as she might, she could not force his cybernetic hands to open.  She was beginning to lose consciousness.  She could hear Ithalond talking.  &quot;Let&#39;s see if we can find <i>your</i> reserves of strength,&quot; he said with a sneer.  Jenni distantly felt a pain in her abdoman and then she felt no more.<br><br><br>[[This was in response to a challenge from Tungsten Monk.  She wanted me to branch out and do something different.  Challenge accepted and this is the result. -Phobos]]</p>

            <p><b>Earth (<i>DC Comics</i>)</b><br><br>The planet had certainly seen better days. Oh, it wasn&#39;t perfect, but it had a vast array of heroes and heroines to fend off the worst of the threats. Then the Dark King of the Multiverse decided to make an example of it in an attempt to overawe his prospective vassals. Sues, Stus, and Author - Wraiths were sent to distract the world&#39;s defenders with romantic attatchments, while diabolical emmisaries gathered the most implacable enemies of humanity. <br><br>At the same time, the Plague division of the nascent Legion of the Multiverse Lords began putting together a concoction made of equal parts Magic and Science. A composite sickness made of several dozen viruses, it was not made to kill, but rather to incapacitate. It affected the populace gradually, causing them to grow more lax and unwary. To the Metahumans, it also made them more careless with their powers, leading to several &quot;incidents&quot;.<br><br>But that wasn&#39;t the end of it. Knowing the DC Universe&#39;s vulnerability to reality warping, the Dark King of the Multiverse sponsored several attempts by fanfic authors to change what aspects of the Canon they did not like, especially for Shipping purposes. This caused additional Chaos, not helped by the sudden &quot;Ukefication&quot; of heroes like Superman and Batman.<br><br>Finally, the invasion was launched. The armies sent against Earth were well-armed, well-trained, and well-supplied, with the Dark King himself leading them. Darksied, the Anti-Monitor, Nekron, Krona, and the Manhunters all converged on the planet, making quick work of the remaining heroes and heroines, as well as villains that did not side with them.<br><br>Humanity was reduced to almost a shadow of its former glory, kept alive only to serve as an object lesson for those who would defy the Multiverse Lords. However, the Dark King&#39;s decision to leave would prove to be a boon for the planet, as it allowed agents of the New Multiverse Freedom League to infilitrate the populace, bringing hope and making new recruits.<br><br>Now, King Durran Illian made his forward base on the Justice League&#39;s Watchtower, now rebuilt and staffed with a new generation of heroes. The Guardians of the Universe accompanied him, along with recruits from what enemies of the Dark King remained.<br><br>And not just that, but on the training grounds of New Sirion, a new elite force had been amassed, one that could prove to be the NMFL&#39;s trump card: The Paladins. These men and women were the top students of the OFUs, able to write both goodfic and badfic. They were also well trained in the arts of war, able to mix them with the powers of plot-manipulation. The King spared no expense in outfitting them  the best weapons and armour, hoping that they would one day prove themselves.<br><br>&quot;The Apokolips Armada is made up of three classes of ships: The hoplessly corrupted, which have to be destroyed right away, the advanced, but untouched by malefic AI or Magic, and the ones in between, which can be cleansed at comaparatively little cost.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you, Agent Isaiah,&quot; said the King. &quot;This information can make or break the chances of us profiting from this victory.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I would have to warn against pressing our avantages too much,&quot; spoke General Mara. &quot;Our forces are a ragtag bunch of desperate factions, except for the Elite Core. At present, our strategy lies on hitting fast, hitting hard, and using our smaller ships to outmaneuver their bulky hulks.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And stealing what vessels and war materials won&#39;t corrupt us,&quot; said the King. &quot;However, I have one last card to play, something more important than the Paladins.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What would that be?&quot; said the General curiously.<br><br>Suddenly, a portal opened. From there, a blue-skinned man  with red eyes calmly walked out, before giving a short bow to the King and her. He then said: &quot;My name is Mitth&#39;raw&#39;nuruodo, better known to your associates as Grand Admiral Thrawn. As part of the double game the Emperor is playing, I have been asked to command this fleet on its assault on Apokolips.&quot;</p>

            <p><b>Corcusant</b><br><br>&quot;Is it done?&quot; Emperor Palpatine spoke to his new apprentice, Luke Skywalker.<br><br>&quot;Yes, my lord. Grand Admiral Thrawn has offered his services to King Durran of the New Multiverse Freedom League. Although I may ask, hasn&#39;t the Dark King of the Multiverse given us enough? Victory over the Rebel Alliance and the Yuuzahn Vong, my services as your new apprentice...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Have you learned nothing, boy? Treachery is the way of the Sith. When the Dark King allowed us to fuse Yuuzahn Vong biotechnology with ours, his usefulness ended. Remember, no matter how powerful he gets, no matter what arts he has learned from other worlds, he is merely a clone of a Jedi Master I once decived.&quot; The old Sith Lord probed Luke&#39;s mind with the Force, searching for influence from out of his Universe. <br><br>&quot;Even so, master,&quot; Luke spoke. &quot;Is an alliance with the NMFL worth it? Remember the books the Dark King of the Multiverse gave you. They&#39;ve read them too, and may be preparing for when you inevietably backstab them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not while they&#39;re figthing with the Multiverse Lords. By offering Thrawn&#39;s services, I&#39;ve made myself and my troops indespensable. Remember, the New Multiverse Freedom League and the League of Mary Sue Factories are still horribly outnumbered, so they&#39;ll need any help they can get.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And even with our help, there&#39;s a chance they&#39;ll still be horribly gutted, perhaps enough for us to crush them both?&quot; Luke asked.<br><br>&quot;You are learning, my apprentice. Perhaps faster even than your father had.&quot; The Emperor then lay back on his throne, silently contemplating the opportunities ahead.<br><br><b>Apokolips</b><br><br>The attack came as a surprise. While the armada that was being amassed just outside the planet was vast, it was not yet fully organized for an assault. Especially when one-fourth of its numbers joined the attackers, firing at strategic positions throughout the fleet.<br><br>However, the Multiverse Lords did not have a lack of skilled (or at least semi-competent) naval commanders, and the counterattack was immediate. The massive guns of the Star Dreadnaughts unleashed withering salvos of fire, which took down some of the speeding ships.<br><br>But not nearly enough. Some of the enemy vessels were unarmed, and controlled only by nonsentient robots. These served as rammers that took down ships by crashing into them, causing them to explode and careen onto other spacecraft, or even the planet.<br><br>King Durran Illian, True Claimant to the Rulership of the Multiverse, watched the figthing from his new capital ship, the <i>Mkellin</i>. His Ultramarine-Grey Knight bodyguards stood with him, as well as his Paladins. Grand Admiral Thrawn and the Guardians of the Universe were conducting the battle like maestros, giving out orders to board the less corrupted ships.<br><br>&quot;Should we take over that Star Dreadnaught on our left, or that Battlestar just below us?&quot; said one of his bodyguards.<br><br>&quot;Neither,&quot; said the King. &quot;Once the Green Lanterns reach the shields protecting Apokolips&#39; Palace from teleportation, we shall storm it along with our new Paladins. Our goal will be to kill Darksied in a surgical strike that will leave the Multiverse Lords here defenseless, strengthening our position even more.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I look forward to it, your majesty.&quot; said the Bodyguard.<br><br>King Durran readied his weapon. The moment might come at any time, and he needed to be prepared. This engagement might prove to be the pivotal turning point of the war... <br><br>------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Darksied fumed. That Palpatine had betrayed the Dark King of the Multiverse before he could! Now his Star Destroyers (hybridized with Vong technology, of course) were cutting holes in the armada the Multiverse Lords were gathering to destroy New Sirion. And of course, that Thrawn was commanding them. How else to account for the perfectly coordinated strategies of his enemies?<br><br>But he wasn&#39;t without cunning himself. He knew that the &quot;King&quot; of the NMFL was there, and that he certainly planned to teleport down to the palace and take him out. However, he had already prepared a careful ambush for the monarch and his troops, one that will see him take down the would-be Multiversal Ruler.<br><br>As the Green Lanterns made their blasts on his shields, Darksied gave the order to shut them down. Now was the time for him to play his hand.<br><br>However, the first people to teleport in his palace weren&#39;t King Durran and his troops. Rather, it was his son Orion, who belonged to the forces of good and was prophezised to destroy him one day. He was accompanied by Squirrel Girl, from Marvel Comics.<br><br>&quot;So, Thrawn was right,&quot; said Orion. &quot;You really didn&#39;t expect us.&quot;<br><br>Then the battle began.</p>

            <p><b>Apokolips</b><br><br>King Durran and his elite forces stormed the palace of Darksied, taking down his Parademons and Female Furies, who fought fircely for each corridor. It was clear that they had been expected. But the Paladins were all coated in Plot Armour and were armed with blades that were as sharp as the story needed them to be, and they hewed through the opposing forces with ease.<br><br>Thrawn had warned them of Darksied&#39;s possible ambushes, and had told the King that he had sent Orion and Squirrel Girl to spring the traps before the main assault began. King Durran thanked him silently as forces continued to surge through the halls, overcoming the automated guns and blast doors that stood in their way. Finally, they busted into Darksied&#39;s throne room.<br><br>There, they found the Ruler of Apokolips already dead, with Orion and Squirrel Girl figthing Kalibak, Darksied&#39;s other son who belonged to the forces of evil, and Granny Goodness, head of the Female Furies. Acting quickly, King Durran ordered his Paladins to form a circle around the figthers, and to ready their powers.<br><br>&quot;One...two...three - Flame Salvo!&quot; Jets of fire emanated from the Paladins&#39; blades and engulfed Kalibak and Granny Goodness, thus ending the fight. Orion and Squirrel Girl said hurried thanks.<br><br>&quot;Now,&quot; said Orion. &quot;I can take my rightful place as Ruler of Apokolips, and transform it into a fairer, better world. Thank you, King Durran.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That was a great fight!&quot; said Squirrel Girl. &quot;Didn&#39;t expect this sort of victory, didn&#39;t you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, not really.&quot; said King Durran. &quot;Thank you. Even though your sector of the Multiverse is also suffering from the Multiverse Lords, you still chose to aid us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; said Squirrel Girl. &quot;Anyway, I brought something for you.&quot; She then got out a Cosmic Cube.<br><br>&quot;But, won&#39;t that only work in your Universe?&quot; said King Durran.<br><br>&quot;I know,&quot; said Squirrel Girl. &quot;But I&#39;m sure that Makes-Things and your other Inventors can devise a way to make it work in this dimesnion as well.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s a good idea,&quot; said King Durran. &quot;Very smart. I&#39;ll send it to them right away.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thanks!&quot; said Squirrel Girl.<br><br><b>The Dark King&#39;s Labyrinth</b><br><br>The Dark King of the Multiverse raged and howled for the better part of the day. Why did he not complete the extermination of Earth (<i>DC</i>)? Or better yet, why did he not leave a force to keep them enslaved and keep out enemy operatives?<br><br>On a whim, he transported himself to the ruins of Legal. The Flowers that had staffed it were among the first to vanish during his Invasion of HQ, and the Dark King had feared that they would launch a counterstroke against him one day. It seemed that day had come and gone without him knowing. <br><br>He howled again, raging and fuming. Returning to the Dark Observatory (what was once the Intelligence department), he began to inspect his dominions.<br><br>On the <i>Warhammer 40000</i> universe, the Mary Suetopia of Ultramar had launched a Sapphire Crusade against Chaos Emperor Abbadon, who now reigned upon Terra thanks to his aid. <br><br>At the same time, the Darklords of <i>Ravenloft</i> were being overthrown by League of Mary Sue Factories-backed operatives. The Dark Powers that backed them were also being sent holwing, especially when Suevian artifacts such as the Tenth Millenium Item were deployed.<br><br>In <i>Dark Sun</i>, a way to acess Arcane Magic without deatroying the plant life had been found, thanks to the influence of more Suevian artifacts.<br><br>And of course, the world of <i>Shadowrun</i> was turned over its head as the Mega-Corps were dismantled and a new, democratic government was installed.<br><br>The Dark King&#39;s first impulse was to rage further, but then an idea came to him. Of course! The New Multiverse Freedom League was only one-half of his problems. He had been focusing on it because of its leader&#39;s claim to his throne, but that only distracted him from the damage done by the Yarrow and the LMSF. Now he knew where to hurl his forces.<br><br>He then portaled in another set of champions, and began barking orders at them. This war wasn&#39;t over yet, not by a long shot...  </p>

            <p>((OOC: Okay, time to end this monstrosity. It&#39;s become too long and people may start to complain.))<br><br>AN: I&#39;m going to the Liechtenstein embassy to protest against the illegal and inhumane detention of the staff of Fanfic Land. I don&#39;t know how many will join me, but I fear that I may not return from this endeavour. So in order not to leave my readers hanging, I&#39;m going to give you a summary of what would have happened had I continued writing.<br><br><b>Synopsis</b><br><br>The Dark King of the Multiverse sends another series of champions against the League of Mary Sue Factories, who counter with their own champions. These consist of Marneus Calgar, Drizzt Do&#39; Urden, Mystra, and Elminster (as I can&#39;t think of a Sue or Stu for <i>Shadowrun</i> as I can&#39;t afford the gamebooks). After another series of battles, they win, but the DMK manages to salvage something from his defeat: The location of Legal.<br><br>It is in Generic Fantasy, a land ruled by the Multiverse Lords, but with many holdouts against his rule. The Flowers of Legal were hiding in the Generic Hidden Valley, a Gondolin ripoff. Emboldened by this, the DMK marches out personally with a vast army and besieges the enemy stronghold. <br><br>Legal uses many tricks, but finally, the Dark King of the Multiverse wins his first victory, and decides to press his advantage.<br><br>He repulses an NMFL-LMSF offensive at Earth (<i>The Matrix</i>, before reclaiming several of the Keyblade Worlds. He also decimates Kalm, Junon, and Costa del Sol (from <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>) with a Meteor Swarm. This spurs the NMFL-LMSF alliance to move into the <i>Naruto</i> and <i>Haruhi Suzumiya</i> worlds to collect the Ten-Tailed Beast and the SOS Brigade.<br><br>This spurs a final offensive into the Dark King&#39;s Labyrinth, in which Makes-Things deploys his Mobile Reality Rooms to destroy many of the troops and defenses. King Durran and Emperor Yarrow confront the Dark King of the Multiverse himself, wielding Agelos and Narsil (both taken by LMFS operatives).<br><br>Emperor Yarrow is killed, but King Durran absorbs his Suefluence, making him strong enough to impale the DMK with Agelos, ending his rule. There is an epic explosion, but the King survives. The Multiverse Lords are defeated.<br><br>HQ is cleansed and becomes the headquarters of the new Multiversal Parliament. King Durran also leads the LMSF as well as the NMFL (now reorganized into the Multiversal Federation). The decision is made to keep the Pentacle Seers of the Technocratic Traditions under Suefluence until a new generation of Mages rises. Then, normal psychological manipulation will be used.<br><br>Marneus Calgar, Canon Stu, is promoted to Emperor of Mankind. Plans are made to raise up Non-Suevian claimants to his throne later.<br><br>King Durran and Princess Tia marry, and there is a lot of description of their riches.<br><br>Makes-Things is given an even bigger Mansion than he has now.<br><br>And everyone lives happily ever after.<br>PS: Don&#39;t forget to read my Fanfic Challenges! </p>

            <p>I thought that Makes things is such an awesome inventure that he has to be a spark! So I decided to write his origin story.<br><br>PLease revu, but be nice. This is my first fanfic that I&#39;ve shared.<br><br>Diusclaimer: I do not own the PPC or Girl Genius.<br><br>The boy sat on the ground with his toys, but they weren&#39;t any fun. He was a small kid who was beat up by buyllies all the time! They didn&#39;t understand him, they were jelous because he liked to tinker with stuff. but he would show them! one day he would make a device that would show them! That&#39;s right he would show them all that he wasn&#39;t just some weakling kid they could pick on because he was small!<br><br>So there he was, minding his own business when a bunch of people with nice hats came buy and told him he was being taken into The Barons protection. He was going to say no, but they grabbed hima nd took him in a big airship to an even bigger airship! It was so huge it made the other smaller big airships look tiny.<br><br>&quot;Welcome to Castle Wolfenbach&quot;</p>

            <p>Makes things, as he had come to be known due to being the best at making things of all the spark kids on Castle Wolfenbach, was amazed at how his life had changed. Sure the other sparks were good at making stuff, but he was better at it than all of them put together. Even Baron Wolfenbach himself said so!<br><br>ONe day while he was working in his lab on a traveling device something went wrong. The Castle gave a sudden unexpected lurch and makes things was thrown against the on switch for his device. <br><br>A great swirly thing apeared in the air and makes things was pulled through it. He found himself in a dull grey corridor, and there was an open door in front of him so he went through it.<br><br>There was a strange cacaphmey of voices that weren&#39;t really voices and a bunch of plants were arguing about where they were, how they got here, and what they were going to do next.<br><br>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; said makes things timidly. For even though he had been treated like a Prince on castle wolfenbach (there were rumors that the baron was going to adopt him and make him his heir) he was still timid due to being small and beaten up by the kids who didn&#39;t understand his love of making things.<br><br><i>And who might you be?,</i> asked a voice directly in makes thing&#39;s head.<br><br>&quot;Everyone calls me makes things, because I, uh, make things. Did I hear right that you don&#39;t know how you got here either?&quot;<br><br><i>That&#39;s right</i> said the odd voice in makes things&#39;s head. <i> Do you think you could make something to send us home?</i><br><br>&quot;I can try. Do you have a lab I can use?&quot;<br><br><i> we can make you one. Wherever this place is it listens to us and reshapes itself however we desire. but we still can&#39;t find a way home.</i><br><br>----<br>Hah! I bet you didn&#39;t know Makes things was one of the first members of the PPC, did you?</p>

            <p>While Makes Thigns was having his lab prepared and getting used to the odd place, which we all know will one day be PPC headquerters, Things were happening on Castle Wolfenbach.<br><br>Othar TRygvassen, Gentleman Adventurer (Imagine it said in a deep, overdramatic and sexy voice) was in the process of escaping, yet again, from the clutches of the Evil Baron Wolfenbach. After defeating over a hundred battleclanks and a few dozen Yagermonsters he found himself in Makes things&#39;s old lab. Nobody had been able to turn the Device off so there was till this odd portal in the middle of the room.<br><br>While in the process of fighting off a swarm of yagermonsters Othar Trygvassen, Gentleman adventurer, found himself forced through the strange portal and into what would one day become PPC HQ.<br><br>However it wasn&#39;t PPC HQ just yet, it was just a lot of corridors and a few rooms. Other Trgyvassen wandered about for a while. For those of you who haven&#39;t read the totally awesome Girl Genius comics you should go do so right now! Because if you had you&#39;d know that Othar Trygvasses, Gentleman Adventurer, has sword to kill all sparks, finishing off with himself. And that sparks are natural born Mad Scientists who can make all sorts of things. Which is how I know Makes Things must be one.<br><br>Anyway when Othat Trygvassen, Gentleman Adventurer, found himself in the lab of Makes things he knew at once that the man working there must be a spark.<br><br>Wasting no time at all Othar Trygvassen, Gentleman Adventurer, attacked only to be surprised when instead of hitting Makes Things with a powerful punch he was laid out on the floor.<br><br>You see Makes things had invented for himself a very thin exosuit that would allow him to fight better than the best fighters in the world. And that means fighting better than even the Magnificent Other Trygvassen, Gentleman Adventurer.<br><br>Makes Things then grabbed the Porrtal Gun he had just finished - it was the very first one ever - and used it to send Othar Trygvassen, Gentleman Adventurur, back to the world he had come from.</p>

The punishment is death.”  Agent John shot the Mary Sue.<br>Enjolras and the other students started to attack Agent John, but he put on sunglasses and neuralyzed them all.  “You never met me or Margarita.

            <p>Its tough out there for new and expecting parents inthe PPC. Who could possibly understand their pain?<br><br>The following contains femslash. Flames will be used to fry strips of bacom for minis, so bring em on haters!!!<br><br>Title: Secret Meetings<br>Genre: Hurt/Comfort/Romance<br>Rating: PG-13-ish<br>Characters: Xericka/Kaliel/Maeryn<br><br>Xericka sighed as she rounded a corner of one of HQ&#39;s many corridors. Normally, she would have gove over the various plot points in the last season of Castle or something in order to distract her from where she was going. She didn&#39;t need to do that this, time, however. The argument kept playing over and over again in her mind, like a bad playlist on a lioop.<br><br>It had been Gremlin again, ranting at her about all the time she was spending at the Nursery. She just didn&#39;t understand the work, the time that went into raising a child. Xericka had tried to explain but the metahuman just wouldn&#39;t listen. Everything had to be about her, all the time.<br><br>They&#39;d been having these fights ever since she had abopted Aiden. Usually they were just verbal brawls with lots of searing and cursing. This time hd been different, hwoever. Gremlin had heard a rumor that Xericka was having secret rondevous with someone during her trips to the Nursery. You would have thought that Xericka had committed a warcrime based onthe way Gremlin was screaming. And then...<br><br>She reached up and touched the bruise on her face.<br><br>This had been a long time coming. It wasn&#39;t just about Aiden. So many things between her and Gremlin, between her and most of the PPC, felt wrong. She had to move on.<br><br>The funny thing was that the rumor was true. Xericka was indeed seeing someone on her trips to the Nursery. Another agent, one who was expecting a child of her (well, their) own. Gremlin didn;t know who, but it probably wouldn&#39;t take long before she figured it out. Not too many agents had or were about to have children of their own.<br><br>Xericka walked into the Nursery foyer. &quot;I am just heading back to see Aiden,&quot; she said to the worker at the front desk. &quot;I can see myself through.&quot; The worker nodded and waved Xericka back towards the private rooms.<br><br>Xericka&#39;s gaze stopped on one door in particular. There was a purple &#39;quiet please&#39; sign hanging from the knob. That was their signal. Hardly super spy stuff, but it did the job. Up tuntill recently, anyway.<br><br>She walked over to the door and knocked gently, three times. After a few seconds, it opened up just barely enough for the Nobody to squeeze inside.<br><br>A lithe pair of arms wrapped arond her as the door swung shut behind her. Someone&#39;s warm lips met her own, but only for brief instant. Xericka could not help but smile as she was opulled into a warm embrace, which she quickly returned.<br><br>&quot;I apologize for my lateness, Maeryn,&quot; Xericka said. &quot;I was delayed.&quot;<br><br>Maeryn pulled away from the Nobody and smiled. &quot;It is all rght, my love. I understand. What with all the work we&#39;ve been getting, I would be more surprised if one of us wasn&#39;t late.&quot; Her smiled faded as she noticed the purple mottling on Xericka&#39;s cheek. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Gremlin heard a rumor about my trysts at the Nursery. Trust me, I gave as good as I got.&quot; That was not exactly true, but it certailny sounded good.<br><br>Maeryn lowered her head for a moment, allowing Kaliel to tkae control. &quot;<i>She will not sruvive this day,</i>&quot; she growled. &quot;<i>I will make sure of that personally.</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;Do not bother yourself with her. She just does not understand what I am going through.&quot; Xericka closed her eyes and pressed her cheek against Kaliel&#39;s. &quot;Not like you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>You can&#39;t stay with her.</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was not planning on doing so.&quot; A remote activator appeared in her hand with a flash of darnkess. &quot;Many agents go missing, even whilke walking around HQ. That is what shall happen to Aiden and I.&quot;<br><br>Confusion and nerviousness passed over Kaliel&#39;s face. After a moment, Maeryn resurfaced. &quot;I cannot go with you. You know that. I cannot leave my own unborn son behind. I have to wait.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know. I was aware of that before I came down here.&quot; Xericka stepped away from Maeryn and looked down at the ground. &quot;I merely felt you should know.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Where will you go?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am not sure. I had thought about going to the Real World. I have never been there before.&quot;<br><br>There was an extended pause. Finally, Maeryn stepped in close to Xericka and wrapped her arms around the Nobody again. &quot;I will never forget you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nor I you, my dear. Nor I you.&quot;<br>* * * * * * * * * * *<br>TWO YEARS LATER<br><br>The clerk looked up at the sound os someone clearing their trhoat. A young woman dressed all in brown was standing in front of his desk. There was a stroller with an infant it sitting next to her.<br><br>&quot;I am looking for Miss Karcie Nil, please?&quot; the woman asked. &quot;I understand she lives here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t give that information,&quot; the clerk replied. &quot;Now if you&#39;ll exuse me--&quot;<br><br>The woman&#39;s eyes glowed. &quot;<i>Karcie Nil. Now.</i>&quot;<br><br>All of the clolor in the clerks&#39; face vanished. &quot;Yees ma&#39;am.&quot;<br><br>One elevator ride later, the young woman was standing in front of a door that looked like any other. She took a deep breath and knocked.<br><br>After a few seconds, a Goth-lloking young lady with blue streaks in her hair opened the door. &quot;How may I -- Maeryn?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hello, Xericka.&quot; Maeryn smiled. &quot;I finsihed waiting.&quot;<br>______________________________________________<br>Read and review plz!!!!<br><br>(OOC: To Pretzel: I am so, so, SO sorry.

            <p>AN: Sorry for not including Suicide in this chapter, frenchPPCfan. But don&#39;t worry, future chapters will include him being awesome. <br><br><b>New Sirion, Capital City Illiana</b><br><br>King Durran Illian, True Claimant to the Rulership of the Multiverse, looked out through the viewscreens and saw the tides of battle as the war for the Multiverse raged. His generals watched with him as they formed new plans to continue the offensive. The situation was only slightly in their favour, with the Multiverse Lords having contributed only a small part of their strength.<br><br>The Doctor and his TARDIS had entered the war on the New Multiverse Freedom League&#39;s favour, but he was being swarmed by the Daleks, who now had Chaos Daemons bound into them to make them more powerful. Also, Sues, Author - Wraiths, and Character Replacements were trying to distract him with &#39;romantic attachments&#39;, and only the knowledge of Canon Matters granted him by the PPC prevented the Time Lord from being seduced.<br><br>Makes - Things, rescued from the fall of HQ, was busy building new weapons and armour to combat the Multiverse Lords. He was being helped by Techno - Dann and Tess, along with the Venomous Tentacula, sent by the Leauge of Mary Sue Factories as proof of their intention to cooperate. Now, they were working on a Mobile Reality Room that would take care of the beings from Warhammer 40K and the World of Darkness (Old and New), ending the threat they represented.<br><br>&quot;Maybe it&#39;s time for you to finally move,&quot; said General Mara. Parliament can keep government going while you lead the final offensive.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said the King. &quot;But I have seen the tides of fate, and they tell me that now is not the time for me to confront the Dark King of the Multiverse yet.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then when will it be?&quot; said Mara. &quot;What if without your help, the Legion of the Multiverse Lords prevails over our brave soldiers?&quot;<br><br>&quot;There is a time and place for everything,&quot; said Agent Isaiah. &quot;Be patient, for soon, the persistence and determination of our forces will see them succeed over the raw power of our enemies.&quot;<br><br>Suddenly, the alarm bells rang, causing an uproar in the surrounding corridors. King Durran stifled his surprise, and calmly spoke: &quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot;<br><br>Agent Monty ran inside the War Room, saying: &quot;The Death Eaters have teleported into the Palace somehow! Your Majesty, we need your help!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Very well then, let me change into my Armor and Weapons.&quot; </p>

            <p><b>Generic Mythology</b><br><br>While King Durran Illian fought for his life in the Jasmine Palace, Commander Suicide had secured the halls of Valhalla, and had claimed Gugnir and Mjolnir from the fallen Odin and Thor. Now, he was allowing a brief time for his troops to rest and recuperate before continuing his offensive.<br><br>Suddenly, a messenger came in, panting from exhaustion.<br><br>&quot;Commander Suicide! The Red Hulk has appeared on Mount Olympus, taking away Zeus&#39; Thunderbolt and the Spear of Ares!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then my battalions will be there to meet them!&quot; The Crimson - clad General spoke. His mercenaries, composed of Mongols who fought similarly to his original people, let out a loud hurrah. The surviving Norse gods and their servants joined them, having allied with Suicide in the first place in order to eject the Multiverse Lords from their realm.<br><br>As the NMFL Commander marched to the enemy stronghold with his troops, thoughts of anger rose up to his mind as he remembered the deaths of Nume, Illaren, and Dio during the evacuation of HQ. He raged as he remembered the Pila (javelins thrown by the Roman Legions) pirceing their flesh as they tried to give him time to escape to safer places. His fingers twitched around Mjolnir&#39;s handle, anticipating the time that he would have his fill of blood.<br><br>When his army arrived at the Gates of Olympus, the Red Hulk had already sent out TIE Fighters and Bombers to stop them. The Graeco - Sycthian showed his contempt for them by commanding a battalion of Tengri (Mongol Sky Spirits) to tear them apart. He then had his troops use Gunpowder (which the Mongold <i>did</i> have historically) to blow up the Gates.<br><br>&quot;Take no prisoners!&quot; he roared as swift Mongol horsemen began peppering the mountain with arrows. While Red Hulk&#39;s Legion had blasters and grenades, the magical expertise of Suicide&#39;s Mongols proved more powerful. As the battle drew on, the sky became red with blood, an omen of favour for both combatants.<br><br>Suicide slew and slew and slew and slew. His hands were thourougly red with blood. He howled challenges at Red Hulk, calling him a coward for failing to face him personally. Finally, he recieved an answer as he reached the highest palace.<br><br>&quot;I will come for you, Greek Scum! Your head will ornament my master&#39;s halls, and I will be his favourite general! Not Vect or Skynet!&quot; Red Hulk came out of the palace doors, Zeus&#39; Thubderbolt and the Spear of Ares in hand.<br><br><b>New Sirion, Jasmine Palace</b><br><br>Makes - Things&#39; talents had greatly blossomed during the time after the PPC&#39;s destruction. No longer bound by the limiting rules imposed by the SO, he was free to create powerful inventions that would have been classified as &#39;game breaking&#39; or &#39;munchkiny&#39;. Not merely that, but he had now been given the wealth and power he deserved, as Durran Illian gave him generous amounts of gold for even the slightest technological improvement.<br><br>He was finally happy, content in the fact that his contribution to the NMFL&#39;s war effort was indespensable. The days of being looked down upon by Agents who mistreated his CADs and cursed his alarm systems were finally over. Now, he was given the honors accorded to the greatest generals, with a fine mansion and vineyards being given to him in the suburbs of the Capital.<br><br>Techno - Dann, now a cyborg after grave injuries sustained during the HQ evacuation, said: &quot;We&#39;re 90% complete, sir. Soon, we&#39;ll have another new weapon to show his majesty, and more accolades to add to the ones we already have!&quot;<br><br>Tess then said: &quot;But we have a room filled with them already, and the King is finding it hard to find materials more precious than the Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Orichalcum to make trophies with.&quot;<br><br>The Venomous Tentacula then said: &quot;What about Unobtainum? It&#39;s radioactive, but our leader certianly has a suit that can give him immunity to such things.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; said Makes - Things. &quot;Maybe the king should -&quot;<br><br>Suddenly, the doors to the Halls of Invention exploded, and two Death Eaters clearly possessed by Tzeentechian Daemons came in, wands drawn.<br><br>&quot;Surrender before the might of the Dark King of the Multiverse!&quot; they holwed. Makes - Things replied by smiling psychotically.<br><br>&quot;Make Me,&quot; he said before pulling out a Fusion Blaster (those guns used by the Tau in 40K) and blasting a Death Eater into charred pieces.<br><br>&quot;Avada Kedavra!&quot; shouted the remaining Enemy Operative. But the Royal Inventor had a Personal Shield ready and activated, and it blocked the Killing Curse and bounced it onto the Death Eater. Makes - Things laughed.<br><br>He then took out a Gauss Flayer (super guns used by Necrons, also from 40K) and said to Dann, Tess, and the Venomous Tentacula: &quot;Hold the fort until I get back. I have some pests to exterminate.&quot;</p>

            <p><b>Generic Mythology</b><br><br>Suicide roared in rage, and met Red Hulk halfway down the steps. Mjolnir clashed with Zeus&#39; Thunderbolt as the two warriors battled for control of Mount Olympus and the Generic Mythology lands. The remnants of Red Hulk&#39;s Stormtroopers stopped figthing to cheer for their general, and Suicide&#39;s Mongols did the same thing.<br><br>The Graeco - Sycthian fought manfully, but his opponent scored the first blood, the Spear of Ares cutting a gash across his right arm. This only spurred him to greater rage, however, and his return blow broke three of Red Hulk&#39;s ribs. The Mutant staggered back, but used Zeus&#39; Thunderbolt as a sword to parry Suicide&#39;s further blows.<br><br>&quot;Spirits of Blood and Thunder! Come to my aid!&quot; called Suicide as he thrust his spear into Red Hulk&#39;s left arm, drawing forth a stream of blood that the Graeco - Scythian greedily drank. He felt himself grow stronger as a result, empowered by the sudden sustenance.<br><br>&quot;I can do better!&quot; roared Red Hulk. &quot;Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentech and Slaanesh! Empower me with your Marks of Chaos!&quot; Red Hulk grew larger and stronger as his skin darkened with the powers of the Warp. His wounds healed at an accelerated rate, and the power of his weapons increased threefold. Suicide still fought on, however, memories of Dio, Nume, and Illaren&#39;s deaths adding to his determination.<br><br>Finally, Gugnir batted the Spear of Ares aside, and then thrust up to pirce Red Hulk&#39;s heart. Then Suicide bashed the mutant&#39;s head with Mjolnir again and again and again until the hammer&#39;s head was coated in brain matter. At that point, the powers of Chaos flew out of Red Hulk&#39;s body, banished back to their dark realm.<br><br>But it wasn&#39;t over yet. Suicide instructed Hades to give him Red Hulk&#39;s soul, so that he can give it a thousand tortures while his Mongols looted Mount Olympus for all that it&#39;s worth. It was going to be a fun day...<br><br><b>New Sirion, Jasmine Palace</b><br><br>Makes - Things watched as his Gauss Flayer slowly deconstructed Bellatrix Lestrange to her component atoms. Possessed by Slaanesh (The Chaos God/ess of Pleasure and Pain), the Death Eater had tried to seduce him to the side of the Multiverse Lords, not knowing that the inventor had purged himself of bodily lusts a long time ago. Except for <i>blood</i>lust, of course, one can always use the rush of killing someone to spur one&#39;s creative juices.<br><br>&quot;Crucio!&quot; Rookwood cried as he tried to mount an ambush from behind a column. But the spell just bounced off Makes - Things&#39; Personal Shield and hit him. The Death Eater&#39;s life was then ended by a headshot from Makes - Things&#39; Fusion Blaster. The Royal Inventor laughed at the audacity of the insect.<br><br>As he went on, the Death Eaters began using slightly smarter tactics, trying to bring down the ceiling on top oh him. But Makes - Things just blasted the falling masonry with his Gauss Flayer and fired at his opponents with his Fusion Blaster, frying them instantly. He laughed.<br><br>Then he decided to holster his guns and go into melee combat instead, taking out a special steroid which not only had no negative effects on his body, but increased his strength and reflexes to that of ten men. The Royal Inventor then strode across the halls, surprising the enemy&#39;s minions and tearing them apart with his bare hands. <br><br>Suddenly, he heard the sounds of gunfire coming from the gardens. Knowing that the King was in danger, he set off like a rocket to where the skirmish was occuring. When he got there, he tore off the heads of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy and threw them at Draco, who barely had time to scream before Makes - Things shot him with his Gauss Flayer.<br><br>The rest of the Death Eaters tried to flee, but the Royal Inventor&#39;s unerring aim made sure that none suceeded in doing so. Once the skirmish was over, King Durran Illian, True Claimant to the Rulership of the Multiverse, turned to him and said:<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know how to reward you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What about a throphy made of Unobtainum?&quot; said Makes - Things. &quot;I know it&#39;s radioactive, but I have a suit that pprotects me from such things.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s a great idea,&quot; said King Durran. &quot;But I have one better.&quot; He then instructed his servants to bring him his Scepter of Office. He then took out the Mini - Silmaril that served as its head and gave it to Makes - Things. &quot;This is one of the most precious things I can give to you. Please, do with it as you will.&quot;<br><br>Makes - Things smiled. &quot;As it so happens, I am developing a suit of Power Armour similar to Iron Man&#39;s, but better. This Silmaril will do as a power source.&quot; He then went off to the Halls of Invention, ready to make more instruments of war.</p>

            <p><b>The Forgottern Realms, Menzoberranzan</b><br><br>Princess Tia, destined bride of King Durran Illian, fought Matron Banere across the streets of the city, her Sabers meeting the Drow Matriarch&#39;s dark magic. The battle had been going on for several hours now, with no end in sight. This was because Matron Banere had been restored to full physical fitness, meaning that she was now able to keep up with the Princess&#39; swordplay.<br><br>&quot;Darn you!&quot; said Princess Tia as she parried Matron Banere&#39;s whip of snakes. She then continued the offensive with Durandal, only for Matron Banere to open up a Plot Hole and backflip through it. She then reappeared just behind the Princess, only to meet a spinning kick that knocked her back to a dumpster.<br><br>&quot;Lloth will eat your soul!&quot; the Drow howled. She had never been this angry since Buenor Battlehammer had killed her the first time. The Dark King of the Multiverse had given her back her life, but insisted that she and Lloth serve him.<br><br>And serve him they did. Oh, they raged and plotted against him, but they willingly recived his gifts of Gary Stus and Plot Spoilers. With them, they were finally able to punish Drizzt and his merry band of friends, along with millions of their ripoffs (except for Zz&#39;tdri from <i>Order of the Stick</i>, as s/he was still evil). Now they were all suffering in Lloth&#39;s private dimension, and that at least was good. <br><br>But now, she was meeting her greatest test in the form of the New Multiverse Freedom League&#39;s champion. During the years of hiding, Princess Tia had become quite the skilled guerilla figther, recovering relics for the battle against the Dark King of the Multiverse. After having reforged Durandal and Exaclibur into Sabers, she was now able to keep up against the immortal Matron Mother.<br><br>&quot;Elistraee! Help me!&quot; Princess Tia cried out. One of the conditions for the truce between the NMFL and the Leauge of Mary Sue Factories had been to prevent the Good Godesss&#39; death so that she can serve as the Princess&#39; patron. Now, that move gained her the upper hand in the battle, as a silver aura shone out from her and protected her from her enemy&#39;s blows.<br><br>&quot;Lloth! Punish this worm and purge her from this world!&quot; Matron Banere cried. Spider legs burst out from her back, each end dripping with poison. Princess Tia had to exert all her strength and speed to parry, but found herself hard-pressed. However, a lucky blow from Excalibur saved her life, forcing back her opponent.<br><br>&quot;This is the end!&quot; said Princess Tia, as she grew four more arms. Now she was like the Godess Kali except with ligther skin, and her wrath was stronger than Matron Banere&#39;s. Several cuts from her Sabers later, the Drow was incapacitated on the ground, bleeding to death from several wounds.<br><br>&quot;Go on...kill me,&quot; said Matron Banere. &quot;End my life like you know you desire to.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not yet,&quot; said Princess Tia, placing one of her hands on the Drow&#39;s head. Then, she took out a scroll from her pocket using her other hands. It read: <i>Familicide</i>.<br><br>&quot;You woudn&#39;t!&quot; screamed the Matriarch.<br><br>But she did. And so the rule of House Banere over the Drow came to an end. </p>

            <p>((OOC: My younger sister just got Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions, so here&#39;s a chapter in celebration!))<br><br><b>Ivalice</b><br><br>After defeating the Weaver (and his Dalek, Borg, and Decepticon* minions) on Terminus, Highlord Brightbeard led the combined forces of the Alliance and Horde to join Barid&#39;s GDI/NOD/Scrin coalition, who had just finished destroying the Damnation of Draka. Now, they had set up forticfications in Ivalice, where the Lich King and Skynet had invaded in force in anticipation of the New Multiverse Freedom League&#39;s offensive.<br><br>Ramza Belouve, now the Highlord&#39;s squire after the story flow had been disrupted by the Multiverse Lords&#39; invasion, spoke: &quot;The enemy is fast approaching. Should we begin the sortie?&quot;<br><br>The Dwarf Paladin smiled indulgently. He had taken the boy and his party under his wing after hearing about the sad fate accorded to him in Canon. He replied: &quot;Aye. It&#39;s time to show those basterds what our League is all about. Will you ride with me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Always,&quot; replied Ramza. &quot;My sword is at your command.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then let&#39;s do it! Open the gates!&quot; The Highlord then rode out on his Chocobo (he had chosen a local steed for this battle). Ramza and the rest of the party accompanied him, true to their word. At that same moment, Field Marshal Barid charged out on his raptor, accompanied by GDI APCs. Gunfire resounded out of the fortress, cutting holes in the opposing ranks.<br><br>Frost Wryms and Hunter - Killers clashed with Orcas and Firehawks (GDI Aircraft) as the Lich King and Skynet begain their countercharge, their massed ranks clashing with the NMFL&#39;s forces. The figthing was furious, with both forces struggling with great ferocity. But the Highlord and the Field Marshal had long practiced for this day, and showed no fear as they slew hundreds of the enemy with their powerful weapons.<br><br>However, the Dark King of the Multiverse had ordered that the battle be ended as quickly as possible, and the Lich King and Skynet in his Terminator avatar had no choice to follow. They slew past the elite guards that surrounded the Highlord and the Field Marshal and rushed the commanders, bellowing challenges.<br><br>&quot;You dinnae need te ask, Arthas!&quot; shouted Brightbeard as he dismounted from his Chocobo. Ashbringer and Frostmourne clashed once again, causing cheers from Ramza and his party. During that same moment, Skynet was trying to parry Gae Bolg, which Barid was now endeavoring to impale him with.<br><br>The Lich King cast powerful spells of frost, which were countered by his opponent&#39;s powers over light. The Highlord&#39;s powers had grown since his time as an Agent, especially when Tirion Fording had been killed by one of the Dark King&#39;s Mary Sues. Now, the Dwarf Paladin&#39;s rage against him and the Multiverse Lords&#39; rule brought out his hidden potential, and he was able to give the Lich King the fight of his (un)life.<br><br>Barid, meanwhile, was using all of his cunning and magic at Skynet&#39;s Terminator avatar. The troll let out a blast at it with the Spear of Lugh, before following up with hexes meant to corrode metal. However, the AI was not to be so easily defeated, and attacked with a silver whip that crackled with electricity. The Field Marshal danced away, before attacking again with Gae Bolg.<br><br>During that time, Highlord Brightbeard managed to smite the Lich King with the powers of the Light. Then he continued on, pulling out his hammer and hitting him with on the legs. His enemy tried to cast Fury of Frostmourne, but the Highlord let out a cry of &quot;For Multiversal Freedom!&quot; and leapt up, breaking Frostmourne with Ashbringer in a way reminiscent of Canon.<br><br>A second later, Field Marshal Barid stabbed Skynet&#39;s Terminator avatar with both Gae Bolg and the Spear of Lugh, overcoming the AI&#39;s regenerative powers and causing him to overload with sheer energy. This also shut down all of his forces, turning the tide in the NMFL&#39;s favor.<br><br>In the lull in the figthing, Highlord Brightbeard picked up the Lich King&#39;s fallen helmet, and said to Ramza: &quot;If I show signs of turning to the Multiverse Lords, kill me.&quot; Ramza nodded regretfully. Then the Dwarf took out a bottle of Esscence of OOCness and began pouring it onto the helmet. After emptying the bottle, he put the helmet on gingerly.<br><br>At first, nothing happened. Then, the eyes of the helm glew gold, Barid&#39;s color. The Dwarf then said: &quot;Amazing! Full control of the Scourge and no sign of the Dark King&#39;s influence. This Essence is good stuff.&quot; <br><br>Then he began giving orders to his troops, telling them that the battle was over and that the Scourge was a part of their forces now. It was going to be a long war, especially once the King ordered the offensive to <i>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization Series</i>...       <br><br>*I put in Necrons until I remembered that the Weaver (from oWOD) is a mystical creature, and Necrons don&#39;t traffic with those except for the Dark King of the Multiverse himself. </p>

            <p><b>Earth (<i>Artemis Fowl</i>)</b><br><br>Camilla Sandman had just finished restoring Canon back to its original shape when Kazuya Mishima&#39;s forces attacked. He and his branch of the Legion of the Multiverse Lords were clearly prepared for the battle, as they were armed with specialized Anti - Mini weapons that were effective against the bulk of her forces. This forced the armed students and faculty to take the brunt of the assault, barely holding the enemy tide back.<br><br>Meir Brin, second-in-command of the Consolidated OFU of the Multiverse, pulled out her wand and launched an <i>Avada Kedavra</i> at Kazuya, but missed and hit one of his minions instead. In response, the enemy commander charged towards Miss Cam, tossing aside everyone in his way.<br><br>However, the former head of OFUM had learned some new tricks, and pulled out Cheat Codes and a Gameshark. She used this in order to fight on the same level as Kazuya, keeping him from slaugthering more of her forces. This allowed Thundera Tiger to rally her forces and counterattack.<br><br>&quot;I did not expect such dirty tactics from you, Miss Cam,&quot; Kazuya said as he hurled a series of punches and kicks that rattled her shields. &quot;However, you&#39;re going up against a <i>master</i>!&quot; He then barreled past her and tackled Meir Brin, taking hold of her neck.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t move! Or I strangle her,&quot; Kazuya said as Miss Cam prepared for an attack. &quot;She&#39;s very important to you, isn&#39;t she?&quot; he gloated as the OFU head fumed. <br><br>Suddenly, a portal opened above his head and three people fell out. Kazuya had to let go of Meir Brin to dodge. He then gasped. The people who came from the portal were Lili, Askuka Kazama, and Zafina (fellow characters from <i>Tekken</i>). This caused him to ready a figthing stance, as they were his enemies.<br><br>The battle that followed was the stuff of legends. Even outnumbered three to one, Kazuya Mishima was still able to put up a fight. However, a kick to his face from Lili disoriented him enough for the other two fighters to strike him on the stomach and ribs, knocking him out.<br><br>Then, they turned upon the Multiverse Lords that were giving Miss Cam&#39;s armies a hard time, causing a huge amount of carnage. Finally, the victory was the New Multiverse Freedom League&#39;s.<br><br><b>The Dark King&#39;s Labyrinth</b><br><br>The Dark King of the Multiverse, once the Mysterious Somebody, howled in rage. Not only had Kazuya Mishima been beaten, but reports had come in that Adrasubael Vect and his forces had been annahilated by the Yarrow offscreen. Worse, his attempt at assasinating the usurper Durran Illian had dismally failed, thanks to Makes - Things&#39; surprising display of figthing prowess.<br><br>&quot;I will not be frustrated by these pests! Even with these losses, only a fraction of my power has been reduced! Naga!Riku, send a message to my forces at <i>Star Wars</i>, <i>Homeworld</i> and <i>Mass Effect</i>. We will muster a fleet at Apokolips! (from <i>DC Comics</i>).&quot;<br><br><b>New Sirion<br><br>King Durran Illian, True Claimant to the Rulership of the Multiverse, listened to the reports from the Guardians of the Universe. Apparently, Darksied was recieving a vast armada of ships to add to the ones he already had or were currently constructing. It was obvious that the DKM was preparing another counterattack, and a flashy one at that.<br><br>&quot;My lord, there is also news that Nekron and his Black Lantern Corps will join them as well, and that they have found the location of New Sirion,&quot; said Ganthet, one of the most senior Guardians. &quot;If we allow the Multiverse Lords to complete this armada, then our cause is doomed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Do not worry,&quot; said King Durran. &quot;It might not look that way, but I&#39;ve been preparing for this attack even before I started the New Multiverse Freedom League&#39;s march.&quot; He then rose up from his throne and turned to Mara and Isaiah, who were waiting for him to give their next orders.&quot;The tides of fate have turned. Now, it is time for me to move.&quot; </b></p>

            <p>Also why you tell people who write fics about suicide to kill themselves ? That is not very nice. I think you are jalous of Agent Suicide because he is more sexy and viril than YOU. Also Agent Suicide is not from STAR WARS, which you have named « star trek » (what is this, « trek » ?), but from ANCIENT GREECE. You are not very intelligent.</p>

            <p>I think it is wonderful that more writers in this fandom are begining to realize how important real characterisation is! Well done. I can only say that you have made Suicide a little too nice. He in&#39;t very sweet and hates everybody; I bet he would try to hurt himself. (He&#39;s angry he&#39;s still alive and that makes him angry and darksouled.) But good job! Your English is very good. <br><br>[Congratulations--this, more than any other entry, made me wince.

In non-badfic mode, I think &quot;frenchPPCfan&quot; has actually hit on an interesting premise (particularly &quot;Agent Suicide is amourous of someone&quot; —&gt; &quot;...amourous of himself&quot;), but it is executed too poorly.

            <p>Rating: R<br>Summary: The enchanting waif Supernumerary might protest, but Suicide knew what he really desired.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Author&#39;s note: I decided to write this after reading the other fics in this section. None of the other authors seem to really understand how Suicide and Nume think of each other, and it&#39;s been so disappointing! I hope my humble effort will inspire some more accurate interpretations. :)<br><br>Supernumerary only allowed his true friends to call him &quot;Nume&quot; but one person, one <i>enemy</i>, was violating that room. He shrank inwardly at the thought as he walked down the corridors of headquarters: agent Suicide, so angry and strong, who called him Nume without ever asking permission and who made Supernumerary shiver at the sound of his voice. Yet somehow Supernumerary couldn&#39;t stop him doing it. Something about the way the term fell from his scarred lips shook Supernumerary to his core and it was terrifying him at the thought.<br><br>He was on his way to the cafeteria, to get more grass for Ilraen and caught up in his own thoughts, when he bumped hard into something unyielding. Letting out a cry, Supernumerary stumbled, falling hard towards the unforgiving generic surface. Something hot--unbearably hot but soft, like steel covered with burning velveteen leather--seized him around the waist, and his silky black locks only brushed the cold and hard surface of the floor. <br><br>He gasped, his dewey rain-misted orbs opening wide to meet the cruel chocolate-colored gaze staring back at him. Suicide held him tight and unyielding, his strong hands clenched firmly around Supernumerary&#39;s slender hips, the rough-hewn fingers digging into the pale skin there revealed by the rise of Supernumerary&#39;s thin shirt. Supernumerary shivered, his whole body shaking in terror, as Suicide loomed over him with a smile decorating his cruel lips. <br><br>&quot;You should be careful where you go.&quot; Suicide said, his hands still not leaving Supernumerary&#39;s hips. One idle finger carressed the skin there, drawing another shiver and a gasp from Supernumerary and leaving a white-hot burning trail of heat that shot through him like one of Suicide&#39;s thick solid spears. &quot;You could get yourself hurt falling over like that, Nume.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t you dare call me that!&quot; Nume gasped, trying to twist out of Suicide&#39;s grasp. The ruthless hands held him tight, and tears began to bead in the corner of his wide silvery eyes. &quot;Let me go! I need to go to the cafeteria.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You want something to eat?&quot; One of the strong dark hands slid upwards, leaving a white-hot burning trail of heat in its wake, and the scarred thumb traced across Supernumerary&#39;s delicate chin. &quot;I thought so. Such a pretty thing like you needs a firm hand, though.&quot;<br><br>Supernumerary gasped. &quot;What are you doing! Let me go!&quot; The tears squeezed free of his terrified eyes, sliding down one pale marble cheek and clinging like drops of dew to his rain-mist eyes. &quot;P-please!&quot;<br><br>The other hand cupped Supernumerary&#39;s slim rear, the strong fingers slipping under his belt, and Supernumerary&#39;s eyes widened despite himself. &quot;W-what&#39;s happening to me?&quot; he gasped. &quot;What are you--ohhh!&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; Suicide whispered hoarsely. With one sweep, he dragged the terrified gasping Supernumerary off his feet. Supernumerary pounded weakly at his assailant&#39;s broad chest, but his blows were weak and he was helpless against his overwhelming attacker. &quot;Come to me, you pretty young thing.&quot;<br><br>Author&#39;s note: I want to continue this, but I need to know that people in this section are accepting of canon first. Reviews, please!<br><br>[Tungsten_Monk&#39;s note: I&#39;m going to hell for this, I&#39;m sure of it.]</p>

            <p>Author&#39;s note: This chapter is dedicated to ApOcAlIpspOnY who is clearly such a sad person that he has to flame everyone who writes better than him. :) Maybe hell stop being so immature now. So go thank him for inspiring more Nume/Suicide! I guess now we know who really sucks, huh?<br><br>Suicide dragged the gasping Supernumerary into the darkness. It took a moment for the terrified Supernumerary to realize that he was in a responce center--the dark responce center 2771, where Suicide and his minons--no such thing as friends no, he never had friends--lived. Supernumerary gasped as he was thrusted through the dark doors into the deep shadowiness beyond. <br><br>He stumbled hard and fell, violet bruises blooming on his illuminescent pale skin as he fell. He blinked away the diamond tears clinging to his delicate lashes, trying to stand up, but his hands were trembling and he had trouble rising up. With a growl Suicide kicked the door closed, his broad muscular shoulders blocking the light even before the responce center was closed to the light of day outside. Now there was only darkness and Supernumerary let out a gasp of terror. <br><br>He felt so strange ..... there was a hot warmth in his hands where they shivered and the soft flesh of his slender hips burned where Suicice had dug his strong fingers into it. The warmth burned him and made him shiver.<br><br>Suicide snapped his fingers and a brilliant lance of fame shoot from them, catching fire of torches set in iron brackets around the responce center and bathing the scene in flickering orange and red light. It burnt Suicide&#39;s deep brown skin almost black and his eyes lit up flame-colored, making him a dark and fearsome spirit that loomed over the trembling Supernumerary as if he were an otherworldly demon that planned something sensualy nonconsensual for Supernumerary. It flickered over Supernumerarys skin, turning him into an otherworldly fae of flame light.<br><br>&quot;H-how did you do that?&quot; Supernumerary gasped.<br><br>&quot;The ancient world held more strength and magic then you could imagine,&quot; Suicide said his low voice thrumming through Supernumerary like rough deep music. &quot;How do you think I could survive so much battle and darkness? Like the ancient oracles from who I learned my craft, my power is unstoppable.&quot; Supernumerary gasped and Suicide let out a low dark laugh. &quot;But like every oracle I need sacrifices to maintain my power. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here, my young nymph.&quot; The cruel hand caressed Supernumerary&#39;s slender throat. &quot;Do you think I&#39;d spend my renewed life in this place if it wasnt for the hunting it gave me? And you are the prettiest piece of pray I have ever seen, Nume.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t call me that!&quot; Supernumerary gasped, trembling. &quot;I won&#39;t let you kill me!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh my dear Nume . . .&quot; The dark man smirked and a wave of heat rolled through Supernumerary making his knees tremble. &quot;Who ever said anything about killing you?&quot;<br><br>Author&#39;s note: what a twist! What can I say I was inspired. :) It&#39;s totally obvious to anyone whos actually studied history (like I have. I spend so much time researching! What can I say, I&#39;m a perfectionist) that Greeks were really into magic stuff and it totally makes sense for Suicide to be magical. They had a whole goddess of witchcfrafgt and stuff. Now remember, reviews are love!<br><br>[Tungsten&#39;s note: Yep. Goin&#39; to hell.]</p>

            <p>(Dislclamer/Author&#39;s Note I don&#39;t own the PPC **that&#39;s the Protectors of the Plot Continuum if you aren&#39;t hip like me** Star Trek or Avatar [the good one not the kids one lol] so plz don&#39;t sue me loljk. But seriously tho)<br><br>(Edit: also I kno that Makes-things isn&#39;t like this in the PPC normally ok I just thought it would be cool if he took voer the ppc, k? It&#39;s my story I can do anything i want with it so all the haters can just shove off, k? Also thanks everyone who likes the story u guys are aweome.)<br><br>Chapter 1: Awakening<br><br>Makes-Things suddenly waks up from his super advanced bed in his workshop. His bed had alot of cool things that did stuff like give him massages and make him drinks and things but he didn&#39;t need it right now. He was suddenly in the inventing mood. <br><br>&quot;Loan Denied,&quot; the Sunflower Official told Makes-=Things. &quot;But I need it so I can build my next project he exclaimed.&quot; &quot;We don&#39;t have the money&#39; said the sunflwoer official cuz there&#39;s been too many badfics lately and we&#39;re overbudget. &quot;Fine then,&quot; said Makes Things ran off to a plot hole and landed on Pandora next to the sacred tree. He had disguised himself as a Navi so all the local Na&#39;vi couldn&#39;t see him while he took his shove l and started to dig in the ground so he could get some unobtainium. <br><br>&quot;What the hell are you doing?&quot; said Jake who could see him for some reason.<br><br>&quot;HOw can you see me&quot; says Makes Things. <br><br>&quot;Since becomeing a Na&#39;vi I&#39;ve gained the power of mind-reading and I could sense your ill intent.&quot; jake replied. He pointed an arrow at Makes things and told him to stop trying to dig. &quot;Ha you think you can stop me with such a puny weapon? he said, pulling out his shield device. Jake fired, and the arrow hit the sheidl and ricocheted back at Jake and stabbed him in the heart. Neytiri started crying as Jake fell to the ground bleeding to death. With that trouble finished, makes things took out his digging machine and fired it at the ground and took a ton of unobtainium. The he teleported to the humans on earth and sold it for all the money he needed for his experiment. <br><br>Finally back at the PPC Makes things finished his new experiment. It was a man-sized person in a green suit with white silver skin. <br><br>&quot;What the hell is that&#39; the Sunflower official said. &#39;where did you get the money to make that?&quot; <br><br>&quot;F you flower, I can get m;y own money! Data prune this weed!&quot; and the robot that he&#39;d made that looked like Data from startrek had his arms turn into hedge clippers and he cut the sunflower official down. &quot;Noooooooooooooo!&quot; he said ((go to <a href="http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/"><a href="http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/">http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/</a></a> so you can hear what he sounded llike)) as Data chopped him up and served him to Makes-Things as a salad. <br><br>&quot;This is just the first step Data. Now, we head to the DBS** <br><br>To be Continued<br><br>** Department of Bad Slash</p>

            <p>Rating: T<br><br>Summary: I said that my next fic was going to be titled PPC: Rebirth, but my visions have suddenly changed from being from the future to being from Alternate Universes.<br><br>In this universe, the Mysterious Somebody had won.<br><br>His army was not just composed of Factory!Sues, but also C***br**n, Tortura, Rose Potter, Naga!Riku, Laura (not the Agent), those characters from For Your Eyes Only and Of Warlords and Pleasure, Ebony Dark&#39;ness Dementia Raven Way, Marissa Picard, and Jenna Silverblade.<br><br>The Black Cats were unprepared for his assault, falling quickly before his assault of Squick. Their PPC counterparts were too surprised at C***br**n and Laura&#39;s sudden Ressurections to act.<br><br>Not merely that, but he was accompanied by a vast army from the <i>Civilization</i> and <i>Total War</i> countinua, and since those minions were less sueish than his Factory Minions, he managed to destroy even the most zealous of Assasins and Floaters.<br><br>There were points of resistance, sure. Captain Dandy and the Sub Rosa fought till the last, taking down dozens of Sues and minions as they died besides each other. Steve Diamond and Tango Dioxide managed to take down several DIS Members, while Agent Blue killed Twp&#39;awt and Ontic. Nyx and Dassie managed to gain the trust of the SO, defending him from the MS until the last.<br><br>And finally, Mortic and Elanor managed to evacuate a meager remnant of Agents and Flowers from HQ before being cut down in a hail of gunfire. Those remnants linked up with the remainder of Tinco Division, having no choice but to join forces against the greater threat.<br><br>But this was only a small spark of hope admist a black backgound of wasted potential and crushed dreams. For the Multiverse was now in the grim hands of a dark ruler whose legions bestrode worlds. Gone were the days in which Canon was actively defended, never to rise again.<br><br>For the Mysterious Somebody, after having renamed himself the Dark King of the Multiverse, had gathered the most corrupt beings in the Multiverse to his side. From Warhammer 40K, the World of Darkness, Exalted, Ravenloft, Dark Sun, Shadowrun, Cthulthu Mythos, Berserk, Evangelion, Claymore, Bokurano, etc. etc. came a vast army of abberations, which mixed with the Sues and Stus to form a force of defilement that had few matches.<br><br>Soon, screams flared across the Word Worlds, as the Legion of the Multiverse Lords plundered and pillaged its wealth to enrich their tyrannical paymaster. In what was once the quarters of the Intelligence department, the DKM laughed as the points of light that denoted the universes grew dark at his will.<br><br>But, his will was not to go uncontested.<br><br>There were rumors of controlled passages between worlds being made, where those who were willing to stand up to the despot&#39;s rule were free to plot. Where heroic figures would rather vanish instead of succumbing to the control of the Uber!Sues and Uber!Stus. Where relics and treasures were being stockpiled for a counterattack by the forces of Multiversal Idealism.<br><br>Whispers spoke of different names for the nascent movement. Avengers of Canon, Strikers in Mist, The Consolidated OFU of the Multiverse, Mkellin Division, Blazing Torch of the Illians, the list went on. But there was one fact that was clear: The Struggle had just begun. </p>

            <p><b>New Sirion</b><br><br>The New Multiverse Freedom League (for that was the true name of the rebels), had convened for its largest gathering yet. On the planet&#39;s cities of Lastrefuge, Magitek Keep, Nature&#39;s Reach, and Capital City Illiana, representatives from each section of cells thronged to decide the policy of the Anti-Multiverse Lord conflict. <br><br>In the golden streets leading to the Jasmine Palace (the NMFL had a monarch as its figurehead as a take that to the DKM, but true power lied with the Parliament), telescreens showed messages of pure idealism that brought hope to each delegate&#39;s demeanour as they began musing on their speeches for the meeting.<br><br>On a turquoise throne, the true claimant to the Rulership of the Multiverse, one Durran Illian, sat while his Ultramarine - Grey Knights Bodyguards scanned the council chambers for any treachery. He held the Scepter of Office in his hand, the Mini - Silmaril embedded within it a sign that he was uncorrupted enough to watch over the proceedings.<br><br>&quot;Friends, Siblings, Fellow Fighters for Freedom, I stand here today as a living symbol of the Unity which will see us win against the Dark King of the Multiverse. I thank ye all for showing faith in me, and the ideals which unite us all. By the Azure throne that I sit on, by the Cerulean Robes of Office that I wear now, by the Sapphire Signet Rings, that are upon my fingers, I vow this, today is a new day!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah!&quot; shouted the members of the council. <br><br>&quot;Now,&#39; said the King, &quot;I ask for reports of the situation in the Word Worlds, where so many weep because of the degrading deeds of the Multiverse Lords.&quot;<br><br>A Night Elven delegate spoke: &quot;Highlord Brightbeard has united the forces of the Alliance and the Horde into a combined figthing force!&quot;<br><br>Another delegate, this time human, said: &quot;GDI marches with us! And due to our truce with the League of Mary Sue Factories, Nod and the Scrin allies with them, with Kane metaphorically neutered by a Mary Sue Harem!&quot;<br><br>A third delegate, another human dressed in Medieval Wear, said: &quot;The nations of <i>Age of Empires</i> stand with thee, even to the last villager!&quot;<br><br>And finally, a fourth delegate spoke: &quot;Due to the Yarrow&#39;s Sues and Stus, the World of Darkness has become a World of Light, ruled over by the Pentacle Seers of the Technocratic Traditions.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good! Good!&quot; said the King. &quot;And what of our champions?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Highlord Brightbeard has reclaimed the Ashbringer, and wields it in battle!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Field Marshal Barid has acquired Gae Bolg, and the Spear of Lugh!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Princess Tia has the sword Durandal, and is reforging it and Excalibur into Sabers!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bright tidings!&quot; said King Durran. &quot;Especially the tidings of Princess Tia. Now, can anyone doubt our victory today?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nay!&quot; cried the assembly.<br><br>&quot;Then I can say this with certainity! The War has moved on into its next phase, the time to move openly has come! Let us all gather armies to contest the Multiverse Lords&#39; rule! This is a new day! <i>Aure Enteliuva!</i><br><br>&quot;Yeah!&quot; the delegates cried. They were joined soon after by the guards, and later, the populations of the cities. </p>

            <p>The flames of war broke out later that day.<br><br>On Terminus, former capital of the Foundation, Highlord Brightbeard fought the minions of the Weaver, who had combined with the Borg and the Daleks and the Necrons to put out Hari Seldon&#39;s light forever.<br><br>At the same time, Field Marshal Barid attacked the Dammnation of Draka (name change deliberate), aided by the GDI/NOD/Scrin coalition. Gae Bolg killed any notable invididuals, while the Spear of Lugh cut swathes through enemy troops.<br><br>Princess Tia, however, did not accompany the armies from <i>Age of Empires</i>. Rather, she conducted raids on Occupied Menzoberranzan by herself alone, her new weapons killing even the strongest of Drow Matriarchs.<br><br>Miss Cam, Chief Headmistress of the Consolidated OFU of the Multiverse, marched with an army of Minis, reinforced with combat - ready students and faculty. The <i>Artemis Fowl</i> world, now split between the True Fae and the Great Old Ones, quailed before the march of Canon.<br><br>Battle raged in Valhalla, as Commander Suicide sought to avenge the deaths of Diolcetian, Supernumeary, and Illaren by slaying as many Jotun/Killik/Abyssal Entity hybrids as he can.<br><br>And on the Keyblade worlds, the Emperor Yarrow accompanied the Pentacle Seers of the Technocratic Traditions as they reclaimed Kingdom Hearts from the Black Spiral Dancer Heartless that were trying to corrupt it.<br><br>In the confines of HQ (now called the Dark King&#39;s Labyrinth), the Dark King of the Multiverse roared in surprise and fury. He had expected some sort of resistance, but not a claim on his throne, even from a Constitutional Monarch.<br><br>&quot;Legions! You have let this usurper contest my rule!&quot; he howled. &quot;For what did I gather you for, if not to make my dominion strong enough to squash such threats? Deal with this problem now, or I will take you to the most incoherent fanfic, to suffer for a million years!&quot;<br><br>Adrasubael Vect, leader of the Torture staff, replied: &quot;Send me against the traitor Yarrow, he who calls himself Emperor.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Done,&quot; said the DMK.<br><br>Red Hulk, leader of the Fifty - First Legion, said: &quot;Send me agaisnt Suicide! I will show him that he should have died the first time!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Done.&quot;<br><br>The Lich King spoke in an icy voice: &quot;Send me against this Highlord Brightbeard, and Frostmourne will prevail against Ashbringer again!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am pleased by that statement. Done&quot;<br><br>Kazuya Mishima then stood up. &quot;Camilla Sandman will die by my hand! Send my armies against hers, and I will have victory!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Done.&quot;<br><br>Matron Baenre, brought back to life by bad writing, said: &quot;Princess Tia has transgressed against Lloth! Her heart is forfiet!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Done. Now, who will take down Barid?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>I</i> shall do it,&quot; said Skynet, who was using a Terminator body as his Avatar.<br><br>And so the enemies started their counterstroke.</p>

            <p>Jay and Accacia was in trouble.  They had walked into the wrong badfic and suddenly found that their cloaking things {AN - I can&#39;t remember wheat they were called at the moment} weren&#39;t working, and now they were being chased by a load of Orc&#39;s.<br>&quot;I think this is going to be the end Jay.&quot;  Acacia said, wrapping her arms around her partner.<br>&quot;Say it aint so Acacia!&quot;  Jay cried, tears falling down her cheeks as the pair of them ran into a cave to try and hide from the Orcs.<br>&quot;My bow is not working.&quot;  Acacia said.  &quot;Ive been doing this longer than you have Jay and I know that this is what feels like its going to be the end of our PPC career.&quot;<br>&quot;Then there is something I need to tell yu.&quot;  Jay told her partner, locking her arms arouns her hips and pulling her close.  &quot;I have always loved you Acacia, I am glad that we will die together.&quot;<br>Acacia looked shocked for a moment but then didnt because somehow she had always knopwn about her partners secret love and she realise that she felt the same way as well, enjoying feeling her arms around her as they were.<br>&quot;I know.&quot;  She replied stoikly.  &quot;And I am in love with you as wel.&quot;<br>The two girls leaned in towards each othern for a passionate kiss and began to tear at their uniforms [AN - I don&#39;t want to be too graphic, I don&#39;t want people reading this 1 handed.]<br>Suddenly they head stuff behind them and suddenly a man was stood there with a really big gun in 1 hand and a really big sword in another.  &quot;Dont worry sis, I will save you from these dreadtful orcses.&quot;<br>The new man stood framed in the light of the cave entrance, light shining off his long brown hair and his gleaming brown eyes.  His uniform clung tight to hi muscular body and showed all of his curves off well.  He looked like Aragon from lord of the rings, because he was.  He and Acacia had both been rescued from a badfic as the children of Arrowthorn.<br>&quot;Arogan, what are you doing here?&quot;  Acacia asked, still holding her parnter close to her.<br>&quot;I am here to rescue you!&quot;  Aragon yelled, jumpig out of the cave and mowing down all of the Orcs that where waiting outside and the MarySue that was eading them. <br>It only took him 90 seconds to kill them all and he returned to the cave to find his sister and his partner waiting in the cave, their uniforms still hanging off.<br>&quot;Oh Aragon what can we do to repay you?&quot;  She asked, dashing over to him and wrapping her arms around him.<br>Aragon leant forward to oput a kiss on her lips.  &quot;I can think of a way.....&quot;<br><br>[AN - It&#39;s getting late now and I want to make sure that I write the next chapter rellly well so as not to make it look just like porn.  Theres going to bhe reall stuff between the three agents, but it is like essential to the plot and it will all be done in a tasty way./]<br><br><br>((Argh, this is Meta and I need to run away and take a shower now after that.

            <p>a/n: i was talking to chalk and she suggested i do some quadrant shipping &quot;to get in touch with [my] troll side.&quot; i havent actually done quadrant shipping before so id like some constructive criticism as to what ships are useable or not. for instance are jack and caleb moirails or just in cahoots?<br><br>black romance by accompliceLightning.<br>rated t for violence.<br>summary: suicide  suicide and c3<br>everyone knew agents suicide and nume were in hate with each other. their feelings were blacker than the depths of the ocean and flared hotter than the core of the sun itself. the only one who could keep them from killing each other was diocletian who for some reason was pulling double duty as moirail and auspistice to agent suicide. humans are weird like that.<br><br>one the two of them were fighting particularly hard over a mission they and their respective partners had both been assigned to. suicide had been snappish and had killed the sue early and nume was angry about it because it meant he had more paperwork to do. unfortunately diocletian wasnt there and they killed each other. this proved the need for auspistices in a strong kismesis relationship.<br><br>((Firebird766 here! Norion you are an awful agent. Chalk just wanted you to ship, not write fic!))</p>

            <p>Yay PPC fanfiction! There isnt enough of this stuff. Which is a shame, cause the PPC is AWESOME SAUCE.<br><br>Ever wonder what Danny and Cornelius might have done while Laura was away during their time in DIAU? Now you don&#39;t need to wonder! The following contains slash. Dont like, dont read.<br><br>Title: An Inquiry<br>Rating: PG-13/R<br>Genre: Romance<br>Characters: Cornelius/Danny<br><br>Danny didn&#39;t look up from his book at the sound of the beeping from behind him. It was probably just Cornelisu. The AI was always coming and going, claiming to be off consulting with the Anitgravity Apple. Who knew if that was really the case?<br><br>&quot;Agent Richardson?&quot; Cornelius said from behind Danny&#39;s back. &quot;Where&#39;s Agent Dukes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Off stocking up on energy drinks, I think,&quot; Danny repled.<br><br>&quot;I see.&quot;<br><br>Something moved in front of Danny. He looked up from his book to see Cornelius in his corporeal, hard-light form. &quot;Something up?&quot; the assassin asked. &quot;Did you get another mission?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No. Rather, I had something to ask you. Something about Agent Dukes and yourself.&quot;<br><br>Danny couldn&#39;t read Cornelius&#39;s face. The AI could be downright inscruitable when he wasnted to be. &quot;Go ahead.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You are not in a relationship with Agent Dukes, correct?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;<br><br>Cornelius paused. Now there was some emotion - confusion? nervousness? it was hard to tell - showing around his eyes. His form flickered, but only for a moment. &quot;Are you... attracted to men, Agent Richardson?&quot;<br><br>Danny peered at Cornelius before carefully setting down his book. He then stood up, so that he and the AI were faceing each other. &quot;Why do you ask, Cornelous? Is this part of you wanting to understand humans better?&quot;<br><br>There was an expectant pause. Finally, Cornelius reached out and strocked his hand along Danny&#39;s jawline. &quot;I believe you know why,&quot; he said softly. &quot;I believe that you have suspected for quite a while.&quot;<br><br>Danny caught Cornelius&#39;s hand in his own before it could leave his skin. The hologram felt surprisigly lifelike: warm and soft, just like a real person&#39;s body would. He bent his head down enough to kiss the first knuckle of Cornelius&#39;s hand. Then the second.<br><br>Cornelius hummed as Danny&#39;s lips graced each of his knuckles in turn. &quot;Is that your answer, Agent Richardson?&quot; he asked.<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; Danny replied. &quot;This is.&quot; He siuddenly pulled the AI in close and kissed him on the mouth. <br><br>They stood their, lips locked, until Danny pushed Corenelius up against the nearest wall. Their kissing began to grow more passionate; their tongues intertwined, parted, then intertwined again. <br><br>One of Cornelius&#39;s hands found its way underneath Danny&#39;s jumper and began tugging at the lower buttons of the assassin&#39;s dress shirt. Danny yanked off his tie, threw it aside, and began working on the buttons near his neck.<br><br>Cornelius broke away for a second. &quot;Hang on...&quot; he waved his hand at the RC dorr. The locks clicked together. &quot;Just in case Agent Dukes were to come back early.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good call,&quot; Danny replied. He tugged off his jumper and resumed working on the buttons. &quot;She&#39;d probably have a thing or two to say about all this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Something off-color, no doubt.&quot; Cornelis nibbled at Danny&#39;s neck while similtanously grinding into his thigh.<br><br>Danny paused. &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to get undressed?&quot;<br><br>Cornelius grinned and blinked three times rapidly. His clothesimmediately flickered and vanished. &quot;Does that settle your inquiry?&quot; he said as he undid the last button on Danny&#39;s shirt.<br><br>The assassin looked at the AI and licked his lips in anticipation. &quot;It does, Corneliys. It does at that.&quot;<br>---------------------------------------------------<br>REviews get cupcakes!</p>

I dont see the point of leaving bad reviews, what are you trying to prove, i mean if you dont like the story just dont read it its not like i care what you think.<br><br>Agent Nikolaos knocked gently on the door to the SO’s office, his knuckles tapping softly against the solid wooden portal. Soon after the familiar angelic voice filled his ears, “Come in”. Nikoloas opened the door, eagerly anticipating the meeting with the flower after what felt like so long. Again the angelic voice surrounded him, calling him towards the flower as if it were speaking to his very soul. Nikolaos my love I have missed you so, please tell me the Sues didn’t hurt you.<br><br>Nikolaos had crossed the room before the sunglower was finished speaking and kissed his head lovingly, tongue reaching out to taste his pollen as he ran his hands down the flower’s thick stem caressing every leaf as he passed.<br><br>“No one will hurt me while I have you looking after me, I promise” he said as he gazed lovingly at the upper petals of the flower.<br><br>“I love you” the flower said, his head seeming to move to meet his lover’s gaze.<br><br>&quot;I know you do&quot; said Nikolaos, his hands reaching down to the cluster of roots making up his lovers penis, his lover uprooting slightly to give him access as he started to stroke slowly at first but getting faster and faster, kissing the flower again as the flower shot his chlorophyll-tinged seed over his lovers hands.</p>

            <p>AN:: Well hi everyone! Im back with another chappie of my story that i strarted l;ast year. i kno I got some mean FLAMERS but I want to keeep writing my story because its so meaningful and shows why the Marqis de SOd is like he is.<br><br>Cahpter Three<br><br>Agent Elli Lloysin threw herself in front of her lover the Marqis as the Sues shot arrows and bullets at him. Lots of tehm hit her but she stood strogn and brave even though she was in asgony. The SUes ;all looked at eacjh other and gasped that she was so strog adn brave. Then she shot them with her arrows that were poisomed (AN: Like Acaica!) and they dyed very fast.<br><br>But Elli was hurt very bad and she fell to the floor bleding. &quot;Marqis love&quot; she gasped. &quot;im sorry I dont thkin i can hold on much longer&quot;.....<br><br>He fellto the floornbeside her and held ger close. He was crynig &quot;No elli you cant die ehre&quot;! &quot;I love you&quot;!<br><br>Then lots of Agnets ran up to help becase they heard the Marqis and they knew he woudl only cry for his Elli and thye liftd her up very gerntly and carried her to medical. He stat outside in the lobbie and waited while all the bet people in medical woked to try to stop her dieing.<br><br>Then Doc Fit came out and looked bery sad. &quot;Im sorry Marqis sir but&quot;....<br><br>&quot;but what&quot; asked the Marqis all worie.d &quot;is Elli okay&quot;?<br><br>&quot;im afriad the sues shot her too much&quot;. &quot;We cant save her sir&quot;. &quot;Im sorry becaue we all knw how much you love her but I&quot;-<br><br>&quot;NO&quot; the marqis yelled. &quot;YOURE ALL STUPID OF YOU CANT SAVE HER WHAT DO WE PAY YOU FOR&quot;! and he ran in to see Elli and she was lying on the bed with all the hopsital mahines and stuff around her beeping and they shpowed she was dieing.<br><br>he sat by her bed and cryed for a long time because his lover was fading away. and then she died and the heart monitor stopped and he sat there heartbroken for a long time as well. Then he stood up and stared down at her beautiful face and turned away. &quot;i promise I will never love anyone elses&quot; he said very quietly and then he went out of medical and back to his office where he could be alone.<br><br>And he could never bring himse;f to be happy agaion becauase he alwyas remebmered  the agent he loved and he knew if it wasnt for the ppC she would hae lived but she was always rpoud to serve the PpC so he couldnt abadnon them. So he was always cross with everyone because it helped to hide how much he urt inside and because the Agetns reminded him ofn Elli his lover who had died.<br><br>But he wasn br ave and carried on this work like she would have wanted thim to and he never let anyone see him cry.<br><br>And that is the stroy of the Marqis de sOd and Elli Lloysin.<br><br>THE EDN.<br><br>AN: REVIEW PLEASE I LOVE RevEIWS! BUT NOt flames becaue I will cook my dinner on them hah! nWhat did ppl think of it????/?<br><br>[[Sorry, all. &#39;s Cassie here, I just had to finish this fic. DX]]</p>

            <p>So her face bears her name, does it? Is it tattooed onto her forehead? Writers like you are what give fanfiction a bad name. Get a beta.

            <p>(OOC author&#39;s note: Tungsten_Monk here. Well, the gauntlet was thrown down in the very first post down there, so I decided to expand my repertoire a bit and play with an agent I rather enjoyed working with before.)<br><br>Title: Smooth Skin<br>Category: Romance<br>Rating: M+<br>Pairing: Brightbeard/???<br><br>Authors note: I am SO SICK and TIRED of being discrimenated aganst for writing what I want. What ever happend to YKINMK? If I get ANY nasty reviews for daring to write what MAKES ME HAPPY I will have the mods BAN YOU FROM THE SITE. <br><br>Anyway, heres the story!<br><br>Agent Brightbeard closed the door of the responce center behind him and leant aganst it, breathing heavily. He was alone, good. His stupid partner had gone to the cafeterea to go bother people again, which meaned he could do it again. It had been so long and he was so filthy.<br><br>His hands trembled as he opened the secret compartmant under the console and began to feel around. His hand touched cool steel and a shiver ran through him at the thought of its carress. Slowly he pulled out the object and its friends: the can the towel, the scissors. He groaned a little almost dropping all of them in anticipaton. It had been too long since hed done this and his thrusting manhood was aching in anticipation but though he had to be quick he would take his time. This was special. This was ........ sacred.<br><br>Slowly, oh so slowly, he picked up the scissors and moved their blades to the rich red beard under his chin. As the blades closed a burning feeling erupted in his meaty lance, unable to resist the visseral joy as the first curls began to fall. Each time the scissors blades closed he felt another spurt of pure joy until he felt as if he was covered in warm creamy happiness. Snip snip snip, and the first heavy hank of beard fell into his lap, the burning sensation in his joystick was almost to much to bare. Cold warm sweat soaked him as he reached for the can of shaving cream.<br><br>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; he moaned as he lathered the warm slick soapy foam onto his face, the bristly remants of beaard teasting and tittilating his rough manly fingers. &quot;Yes yes yes.......its been so long.......&quot; One hand took the strong, thrusting sheel shaft of the razor and began to draw it down his face. The razor burned as it stripped away the unclean beard, leaving behind only smooth pure skin, Brightbeards own steely shaft erupting in more creamy soapy joy as everything that made him angry and unhappy and dishonerable was shorn away and he was left new, as new as a dwarf should be, reborn in the carnal joy of the death of the unclean, bathed in sweat and creamy visseral glee.<br><br>&quot;BRIGHTBEARD!!&quot; a voice called and Brightbeard jumped. A piece of skin tore under the harsh yet tesingly firm blade of the razor and Brightbeard cursed. Barid was standing in the doorway gowking at Brightbeards private holy moment. Brightbeard felt a surge of disgust as he saw the stooped hairy troll a picture of everything unclean in the world. &quot;What ye be doin mon??&quot; the troll continued unaware of how unwelcome he was. &quot;Brightbeard ye be losin yer beard!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Begone filth,&quot; Brightbeard said and threw the razor at Barid. It sank deep into his neck and he died spurting blood and clean on the floor. Brightbeard smiled and picked up the razor again. <br><br>(Further note from TM: I&#39;m very, very sorry.)</p>

And no, before you ask, I am not degrading women by using the term &#39;whore&#39;; men are equally capable of shaming themselves in such a way. I am certainly not implying that women should &#39;go back to the kitchen&#39;. I do imagine, however, that your mother is there at the moment, calling you to dinner.

            <p>Category: PPC<br>Title: Endless Question<br>Summary: There are two teams and no one can decide which team is hotter.  There is only one way to settle this questitn! DI/S Rated R for lemons. Romance. One-shot.<br><br>The question qas what everyone was talking about all te time.  Who Was hotter?  Agernt Suicide (does anyone know what his first name is?  I don&#39;t think I ever read it?) or Agent Dafydil Ian?  AGent suicide was a muscley greek fguy from 300 who had died and came back even hortter.  Agent Dafydil was a Night Elf who had purple skin and green hair and everyone thought he was super hot and exotic.  Noone could decide between the wto of them because they were both so hot, so there was only one way to decide it.  They were gonna have too hacve sex!  So they went to the autotorium and statred to ddo sex to each other and all the girls in the ppc were there and they were playing with theirselves.  There were even some guys who were playing with theirselves because it was so hot.  The guys on stage were doing all sorts of stuffg to eachother and they were getting all sweaty and they kept changing positins.  &quot;This is so totes hot&quot; said Agent JUly Flame (she would know cause she is a fire elemental or something) whose hand was on fire as she was plauing with herself.  Her whol body burst into fire when she organismed.  On the stage Agwnt Dafydil was doing things to the spartan and they were both having a good time.  Agent Diocletine was watching her partner and Agent Adfydil on the stage and shw was thinking of her partner in a new way.  She was so turned on that she started playing with the girl sitting next to her who was using a crayon on herself and was happy to have some help.  On the stage the two guys were still doing things.  They both finished at the same time and everyone started clapping except the ones that where still busy doing things to theirselves.  Still noone can decide who is the hotter agent but they all agree that they are hotter together then they are by theirselves.<br><br>A/N  I hope you all like this!  Please REVIEW!!!!  If I get good reviews I will right another story with different Agents!<br><br>[[I regret nothing.]]</p>

            <p>These are the voyages of the ISD Plot Device.  It&#39;s Mission: to provide an audience to fanfics while also providing the impetus for the unlikely plot twists and situations that take place in those fics.  Whether Canon or Fanopn, its officers are dedicated to the desires of the Visiting Admiral, whether an author of the Fic itself or a big-cheese canonical author.<br><br>And then there are the cadets.<br><br>Some of them as young as 16, you will never find a brighter, more resourceful and, most importantly, more volotile tinderbox of shippers, fanboys/girls and general squee&#39;ers from a thousand fandoms.  Half of them have &quot;Luke (heart) Mara 4ever&quot; posters over their bunks, while the other half have &quot;Soontir + Wynnsa&quot; inside a large heart in a similar fashion.  That is only scratching the surface of the division.<br><br>On a good day, doing exercises in a fanfic or a canon that has universally loved pairings and is well written, everything goes as clockwork with pressed uniforms, smart salutes and the odd fistbump.  On a bad day, where badfic has been encountered or there is an existing shipping war inside the fanon, a malaise of passive-aggressive sourness pervades the corridors, sometimes culminating in demands for satisfaction and food fights in the mess halls.  Usually, the officers keep control... but there have been a few close calls over the years, especially related to the Whedon and Rowling universes.<br><br>Now, one year after the Treaty of Caamas with the NJO non-existant, the ISD plot device steams toward the PPC headquarters, ready to fulfill a new mission.. for a while at least.<br><br>Vader help us all.<br><br>(Notice:  Considering the young age of some of the cadets and the occasional bouts of citrus the ship encounters in its missions, the &quot;Plot Device&quot; comes equipped with a fully equipped holographic entertainment theater, featuring &quot;The Beatles&quot; circa their first North American Tour, Early Elvis, The Muppet Show and Bob Hope circa the Truman Administration, among many other acts)<br></p>

            <p>What I meant with the description I gave was to offer the concept to the PPC in hopes of adoption.  The Bridge would function somewhat like the Theatre on MST3K, with the captain under the command of an admiral-like Author, who would give or hold back on commands depending on how they wanted the story to go.  Recon teams to provide convenient maps and to clear the way of guard for the heroes, orbital bombardment to simulate the wrath of gods, and Intelligence personnel to stir up the correct disturbances the ISD Plot Device is the right hand of the Author within the Canon universe.<br><br>That is not to say that everything always goes well.  On a ship crewed almost exclusively by fans, how can it?  The Whedon riots, after the Willow/Tara thing and Buffy&#39;s various boyfriends, their mothers death and the rest, consisted mostly of mess-hall disturbances and mild grafitti.  The event that will forever be known as &quot;The Rowling Incident&quot;, on the other hand, was so shocking as to be almost perverse.  One of our Bridge Comm officers, an Ensign Soyoto, in the presence of the aforementioned author, abandoned her station, sprang out of the crew pit, drew a weapon (in this case, a Kwaiken tanto carried out of reverence for her ancestral clan, the Harmoni) and, screaming what was apparently a battle cry from her native fandom, charged the author with intent to maim or worse.  The ensign was almost immediately cut down by blaster fire... but it was disturbing nonetheless.  <br><br>Further investigation uncovered that the Ensign had just received word that her father and brothers, along with the majority of her clan&#39;s fighting men, had been killed in the final battle of the HP-verse Shipping war, mowed down by bolt-action rifles and gatling guns of the newly reformed and modernized Authorial Army.  To avoid a security nightmare of possible mutiny, crackdown, rinse, repeat and spincycle, we had to get out of that continuity very fast.<br><br>In the four years since, we&#39;ve hired ourselves out a lot.  We did a few good missions with Sir Pterry, a few movies both good and bad and an awful lot of fanfics of varying quality.  But now, we hunger to return to good duty in pursuit of good ideals.  We come to your service, Protectors of the Plot Continuum, with shrinkage technology down to the width of a human hair (for a 1.6 km long ship), instant teleportation to the effected canon and more than a little of what is called &quot;real food&quot;.<br><br>I just hope you can find billets for 49000 people when we pull in to get the interior of the ship hosed out: 6 year runs can generate quite the funk.<br><br>Best wishes and all alegience, Capt. Malrun Krolek (not my real name)</p>

            <p>So this is basically a vehicle for MSTs with overarching storylines and personal drama? If that&#39;s the case, I really don&#39;t see the point of the whole thing. I know if I want overarching storylines and personal drama, I&#39;m just going to put that stuff in my PPC missions. MSTs are good for one-off humorous bits about stories it would be hard to do missions in. You don&#39;t really need plotlines for stuff like that.<br><br>Everything you discuss is pretty much already covered in some way. Bunch of fanboys and girls in their favorite (or not so favorite) continuums? That&#39;s an OFU! They go on missions? That&#39;s the entire PPC! Orbital bombardment? That&#39;s the Department of Geographical Abberations!<br><br>I&#39;m sorry, but this sounds tremendously redundant considering what the PPC does. Maybe I just don&#39;t get it. If my interpretation is completely wrong, please tell me.</p>

            <p>The way I once described it (loads of fans and shippers aboard with their own private dramas) is how it USED to be. Now, alot of them are growing weary... one crewer is trying to blackmail me into letting him go home by trying to uncover my Old Shames (this is related to my pursuit of that Escaflowne sue-fic). <br><br>Another two joined as NCO&#39;s in order to escape their Mythos-verse Earth for a while as well as to raise enough money to... well, get married.  But now Joseph Clayton and his Tcho-Tcho girlfriend, Lucy Trinh (coming from an extremely humanized, semi-animist, bronze-age but still sacrifice-happy version of the Vietnamese Tcho-Tcho) want back out.  They want to finish University (Miskatonic, in fact) as well.  She&#39;s the first of her people to attend a western university, and he&#39;s the first White man to receive the tooth-filing and tattoos of her people (that story is a hoot in the break-rooms, but that&#39;ll come later).<br><br>If the wedding happens before the PD is decommissioned, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to requisition a water buffalo and a few dozen chickens... you know, religious stuff.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the Soyoto Martyrs Society, which is a whole other headache all to themselves. First we had to shanghai a Shinto priest to perform the funeral rites and now they visit the grave every morning.  Half of them are fellow Harmoni (including Ms. McSweeney and Mr. Winesop) while the rest were her friends.  20 individual pains in the butt who never actually do anything wrong... except the yearly parading of the clan banner (allegedly rescued from the battlefield itself, mud and bloodstains included) and the marching of the Society, all dressed in ashigaru armor, metal conical hats and weapons (teppo, naginata, yari, etc).<br>They won&#39;t want to leave the grave if they can help it, but we might have to move the grave back to Kabocha province on the HP Fandom Homeworld, since the family said that it will be allowed back (argument over honor vs. dishonor to the family has been resolved in favor of the former).<br><br>I just want one chance to go after that monstrosity with my crew and then I&#39;m retiring. I&#39;ll shed my uniform, I&#39;ll eat in the cafeteria, I&#39;ll sacrifice my rank, the whole bit.  However, i reserve the right to pick my roommate, if any.<br><br>However, if you want some fire support for a particuarly bad fic, take what you like.  Better the ship be picked apart for salvage than go to waste in some asteroid belt or get smashed in a hopeless battle.</p>

            <p>I just wanted to introduce a new plot point, let some newbies adopt agents out of the crew (feel free to make up names and preferences), go after one or two badfic find as Ahab did the white whale (&quot;When Escaflowne Rescued Trilladen&quot;... this one is MINE!) and... well, decommission the old girl if it comes down to it.  She&#39;s been far too abused over the years, both by me and by the authors of the fics I&#39;ve read (and some I haven&#39;t).  Plus, I wanted to character of the Captain to be mine (G the B or Malrun Krolek... I can&#39;t remember which one is the fake name).  The rest of the crew will probably scatter back to their original ports of call.<br><br>Although, if the DOGA needs a few turbolasers, just ask.<br><br>Plus, eldritch chicken soup will probably feature at some point, but exactly how is one of the things I&#39;m keeping to myself.</p>

            <p>Haven&#39;t read the first fic yet (and I&#39;ve mainly watched only a couple of the Batman movies) but the second one- ugh. Her &#39;bio&#39; says that she&#39;s 18 and yet she didn&#39;t get sent to prison for <i>two homicides</i> because she was a <i>juvenile</i>? There&#39;s some sort of failed logic in there, if there was any logic at all. And frankly hair that&#39;s not even to one&#39;s hips is a pain to manage; how the heck would you be able to deal with hair to one&#39;s <i>knees</i>? (And is the whole Harley thing canon?) I&#39;m... just going to stop commenting on that one. Ugh. </p>

            <p>My inclination is to say that it&#39;s to do with the fact that she&#39;s such a big Joker fan - she claims to have committed serious crimes because she feels that makes her more like him, and then she needs a reason she got away with it. Plus, doesn&#39;t it make her extra evil that she committed homicide when she was (legally) a child?<br>That&#39;s my read on it, anyway...</p>

            <p>And never mind that courts always have the option of prosecuting someone under 18 as an adult -- a recent homicide around here was, the police say, committed by a 15 year old, and she&#39;s being charged as an adult for it.<br><br>(At least, that&#39;s an option in the US.

            <p>We&#39;re always glad to have new members. :3<br><br>If you&#39;re wanting to be less confused, it&#39;s a good idea to go over the PPC Wiki (all the most popular pages and such of course, but just browse until you start getting the gist of things), read the original PPC series, read missions, and get active on the Board and the IRC channel (which I seem to be studiously avoiding due to my fear of actually talking to people in real time). Once you plunge into it all, you get a lot more comfortable.</p>

            <p>It&#39;ll be worse than you think, my friend. If it gets any kind of fandom, Bad Slash will be overrun. Tintin is after all young, boyish, athletic, etc while Captain Haddock is loud, angry, and more traditionally masculine. I can see the seme/uke thing coming from a mile away. <br><br>I do like the idea of stealing the tins of crab meat, though.

            <p>... almost. If someone writes a good fic, say about how Tintin went from being a big game hunter to someone who respects animals and nature, and the author really shows a good grasp at the character, I think it would be unfair to slap it with an &#39;non-canon&#39; charge.<br>On the other hand, if an author just writes a racist!Tintin and uses the old version as an excuse, it should be slapped down, fast and hard.<br>I don&#39;t think someone writing in a revised canon is a &#39;10th walker&#39; kind of thing, where you can say that it is always and definitely WRONG.<br><br>2) What IndeMaat said.<br><br>3) Also what IndeMaat said. Although if you write a Tintin OFU, you can also get the honour of naming them. :)</p>

            <p>not much of a fan myself, though I&#39;ve seen all the cartoons.<br><br>1. The author corrected canon. Therefore, the old version is not part of canon anymore.<br><br>2. Hergй didn&#39;t want anyone to continue with Tintin after his death. The Rodier version therefore cannot be considered canon. Only the unfinished version of Alph-Art might be canon.<br><br>3. The prerogative of naming minis goes to the first person to encounter them on a mission.</p>

            <p>Mom used to read Tintin and Asterix to me. I&#39;ll be able to help if there&#39;s a badfic overflow.<br><br>1. My vote is for the new to supersede the old. If Herge disliked the original version, and wrote the new one to fix it, I&#39;d say that makes it a Word-of-God retcon and the original effectively never happened.<br><br>2. Haven&#39;t read it, so I can&#39;t say for sure. My vote is to treat it like the Star Wars expanded-universe novels--a possibility, but a lot of people write based on the original material only.<br><br>3. As for minis, I always pictured Tintin minis as incarnated versions of Captain Haddock&#39;s swearing. In the English versions he says things like &quot;Blistering barnacles!&quot;, &quot;Thundering typhoons!&quot;, &quot;Bashi-bazouks!&quot; and all the rest, not to mention calling people jellyfish, seaweed, Neanderthals, etcetera. It could be like the incarnated swearwords in Pterri&#39;s <i>Reaper Man.</i> If that would be too complex, though, I vote for mini-Snowies. (Misspelled Milous? XD) </p>

            <p>Heh. I joke about &quot;My childhood!&quot; when things like LotR are involved, but Asterix and Tintin really are the things I remember best from when I was really little. Tintin fanfic I could PPC, since I liked but not loved it, but Asterix fan stuff is something I&#39;d stay far, far away from. Finding the really bad stuff would be just too weird.<br><br>Plus, at least one fic is labeled &quot;Angst/Suspense&quot; and I can&#39;t for the life of me imagine an angsty Asterix.<br><br>These Romans are crazy, indeed.

            <p>As the &gt;3,000 fics on Transformers indicates something doesn&#39;t have to be good to be popular (at last I assume a good deal of that is from the recent movies rather than the shows they are based on). </p>

            <p>Great idea! I know I&#39;ve come across quite a few ypus in my internet meanderings. They make me imagine people typing so fast they don&#39;t actually read what they&#39;ve written, so they don&#39;t see their misspellings. Except, of course, many people don&#39;t care either way.

            <p>I read somewhere that there would be major changes including the introduction of a new Elven character. This could spell trouble for the film. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong but isn&#39;t Peter Jackson directing The Hobbit? If he is then I hope he doesn&#39;t do it in the same tone as Lord of the Rings. Another issue would be a rise in badfics. On the whole I&#39;m apprehensive about the coming movie.</p>

            <p>Of course, as soon as I hit &quot;Post Message,&quot; I read something very possibly more important than Dori, Nori, and Ori! (Shocking, I know.) <br><br>I know some of you on the IRC are familiar with the Machine of Death book that came out... last fall? <a href="http://machineofdeath.net/">Page here</a>. The concept is simple enough-- there is a machine, and it pricks your finger and out comes a slip of paper telling you how you will die. Everything else - the cultures surrounding it, the people who use it, the style of the messages, the uses legitimate and otherwise, how it effects the psyche of users - is up to the writer of the story. Volume One was edited by Ryan North (of Dinosaur Comics/Qwantz), David Malki! (of Wondermark), and Matthew Bernardo, whose work I am as yet unfamiliar with. They&#39;re taking submissions currently for Volume Two. <br><br>The catch? <s>Due to not having found out about this until today,</s> There&#39;s one week to go. Which... is kind of a crazy small amount of time to write a Good Short Story, but hey! There&#39;s plenty of NaNoWriMo participants here, and the rest of us are, for the most part, all too familiar with doing crazy amounts of writing in impossible amounts of time. So! If you&#39;re interested, hit the caffeine and the tea and <a href="http://writeordie.com">Write Or Die</a>, and let&#39;s see if any of us can make it!</p>

            <p>Now that is exciting. :D I hadn&#39;t heard of this before, so I kind of want to try it. I managed to win NaNoWriMo last November by cramming in 20K in just five days, so I can try to emulate that type of speed (but with better quality, hopefully).

            <p>There are just some continua that strike me, for whatever reason, as being extraordinarily unlikely to ever have badfic (or any fic) written about them. For example:<br><br>* The Eye of Argon, because it&#39;s bad enough as it is.<br>* The poems of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, because most potential badfic writers would never have read or perhaps heard of them.<br>* Stickman and Cube, because it&#39;s about a stickman and a cube.<br>* The Adventures of Lano and Woodley, because it stars an obscure pair of Australian comedians.<br><br>What other canons do you think are extraordinarily unlikely to ever have badfic?

            <p>I trawl regularly for any fic--bad or otherwise--for GoF, but I honestly think I&#39;m the only person who&#39;s written fan stuff for that book. I won&#39;t say it&#39;s an obscure book, but it doesn&#39;t seem to attract any of the demographics that typically write fanfic, and it doesn&#39;t get taught in schools. (All those guts and terror-piss would probably put some folks off, anyway.)<br><br>Steven Pressfield&#39;s mentioned that a movie project may be in the works, though, and I&#39;m frankly terrified of what&#39;ll happen if/when that comes to theatres.</p>

            <p>As most people are pointing out, badfic tends to occur more often in commonly-read continua, which includes some things you wouldn&#39;t necessarily think of (using the ones Emmtheory suggested as examples):<br><br><i>Iliad</i> trollfic (NSFW): &quot;<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5403689/1/Forbidden_Love_The_bIliad_b">Forbidden Love:: The Iliad</a>&quot;<br>Iliad/ENRON crossover (except not really? that&#39;s what it claims to be, but I don&#39;t think the author knows what the <i>Iliad</i> is): &quot;<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1614391/1/The_Legend_Of_Enronia">The Legend of Enronia</a>&quot;<br><br><i>Epic of Gilgamesh</i>/<i>BioShock</i> crossover trollfic: &quot;<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6410750/1/bGilgamesh_b_Challenge_of_the_Soul">Gilgamesh: Challenge of the Soul</a>&quot; (by &quot;Sue Mary&quot;)<br>Epic of Gilgamesh I-don&#39;t-really-know-what-to-make-of-this: &quot;<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6365901/1/The_Scibe_Of_bGilgamesh_b">The Scribe of Gilgamesh</a>&quot;<br><br>a modern retelling of <i>Oedipus the King</i>: &quot;<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6676004/1/The_Bosss_Little_Problem">The Boss&#39;s Little Problem</a>&quot;<br>Oedipus with mpreg: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6745187/1/Oedipus_The_MPREG_Edition">Oedipus: The MPREG Edition</a>&quot;<br><br>I didn&#39;t find any &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; fic, good or bad, in the Pit. As others are saying, in terms of books, if it&#39;s widely read; widely taught in schools, as Homer, Sophocles, and <i>Gilgamesh</i> are; or otherwise has cultural currency; there&#39;s more likely to be badfic. If it&#39;s denser, more difficult to imitate, less open to shipping, or more difficult to understand, it&#39;s less likely to get badfic — see Lovecraft, Borges, <i>House of Leaves</i>, et al.</p>

            <p>Since Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry played Wooster and Jeeves (respectively) on TV, there&#39;s a regular thriving fandom with them. It&#39;s mostly slash. I have fond memories of a badfic writer who decided that since Bertie had so many problems with women, his ideal mate would naturally be a crossdressing male nightclub singer . . . <br><br>Piccadilly Jim, on the other hand, seems to be safe. For how long, I can&#39;t guess.</p>

            <p>There was a time when I&#39;d be surprised to find a Lovecraft badfic, but now Cthulhu is moving into popular culture (I&#39;m looking at YOU South Park) meaning that, while I haven&#39;t looked, I&#39;m sure that it&#39;s out there now with people ignoring the rest of the Pantheon of Elder Gods and sanity-shattering aspects and just seeing the tentacles.<br><br>Also Wheel of Time seems likely as I doubt many people get beyond The Dragon Reborn (Book 3). This leaves a lot of questions unanswered in the mind of the reader, and a lot of things unclear, so if a WoT badfic exists, I imagine it&#39;d truly be terrible.</p>

            <p>Hmm. I thought of a couple and then looked them up on FF.net. Results?<br><br>-Pellinor series -- sadly does have some badfic. And I&#39;m the only person I know who has read those! <br>-One Flew Over The Cuckoo&#39;s Nest -- ... At least two badfics or bordering on badfics. Out of /seven/ total. I barely read some of <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5898003/1/Randles_Angel">this</a> one before I felt like gagging. <br>-Atlas Shrugged -- Huge book size should discourage it, right? Apparently so, but then again I don&#39;t see any fics for it. I&#39;m not surprised about that one. <br>-I expect that more obscure plays that people only read in English class would be pretty clear also. <i>The Piano Lesson</i>, anyone? ;]<br>-I&#39;m also going to state the obvious with poetry. Seriously, how can you even write fanfiction (or bad poetry) based off of even a poet, nevertheless one poem? (I do hope the Ironic Overpower doesn&#39;t prove me wrong there.)</p>

            <p>Poetry&#39;s something of a gray area. Sure, you&#39;re never getting a plot out of &quot;A Rock, A River, A Tree,&quot; but Beowulf is technically a poem (with a hilariously bad CGI movie attached, which is probably where any fanbrats would&#39;ve encountered it. Say it with me: &quot;We are GEETS!&quot;)<br><br>In the vein of Beowulf, pre-20th-century stuff from less mainstream authors (or even lesser known works from mainstream authors) should be relatively safe. I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s ever been Cantebury Tales badfic, for example. Or, for that matter, The Winter&#39;s Tale badfic, despite being by Shakespeare (the only reason people know that play exists is because it contains the most/only famous stage direction in history.)<br><br>Though I&#39;m surprised that Atlas Shrugged didn&#39;t have anything. Yes, Ayn Rand books are generally vehicles for Ayn Rand&#39;s philosophy, but that attracts some *strange* people, who I&#39;d have expected to want to expand on the glories of Objectivism through the medium of fanfiction.</p>

            <p>Almost anything that doesn&#39;t see popular traffic will get less badfic than anything that does see traffic. Anything that requires effort will get less, too.<br><br>This is because anything that doesn&#39;t get traffic also gets less fic in general, and because 90 percent of anything falls short of superb quality, that 90 percent of mediocrity (and perhaps within that, the 5 percent of truly horrid badfic) is going to be smaller.<br><br>Goodfic expends effort, so may happen more often to obscure canons, I think. Goodfic authors may jump to another fandom suddenly and write good fic there because they have the patience and the will to expend effort to do so???<br><br>Maybe???</p>

            <p>All funniness aside, there are certain lines we do not cross. Rape is one of them. It&#39;s the main reason Drip Rat and the Redneck Trees from Something Positive are off limits. No punishments involving rape are allowed, because they fall firmly under Not Funny. Also, it&#39;s a bad idea to trivialize horrific Real World events and crimes when making up assassination methods. So I wouldn&#39;t suggest putting a condemned Sue in the World Trade Centers, or a Nazi death camp, or a room full of KKK members.</p>

            <p>In my mind, it&#39;s not so much &quot;Oh, that wasn&#39;t funny,&quot; as <i>why</i> something isn&#39;t funny. As July pointed out, you can make anything &#39;funny&#39; with deft writing, or boring with bad writing. But the point we&#39;re trying to avoid here is things that aren&#39;t funny because they trivialize Real World events-- which is, I think, what we&#39;ve been talking about with something being too sadistic or horrible. Writing a story in which agents perform horrific torture on Sues is messed up because we&#39;re taking something very, very serious, something that&#39;s an ongoing fight in America right now, and using it for a satirical fanfic. Which is... bad.<br><br>It goes back to the issue with Tv Tropes; as a general rule, we&#39;re just here to have fun. I don&#39;t think anyone here wants this community to be the internet touchstone for graphic, gory depictions of gruesome murder/torture scenes... with a punchline.</p>

            <p>I agree with Aster Corbett that a fitting death is usually in order. My favorite missions end with something suitably ironic based on what type of damage the Sue inflicted on the setting or characters, if only for the sake of making me feel better. :3<br><br>Torture is perhaps a step too far. That said, C*l*br**n. No need to make the Sue&#39;s last minutes <i>that</i> painful.</p>

            <p>Anything too extreme... Torture&#39;s been mentioned earlier.

            <p>You can make terrible and harsh things that are way out of line funny. Sadistic things can be put in a humorous light, but that doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t. We don&#39;t do torture, we don&#39;t do &#39;punishments&#39; that are harsh by any definition.<br><br>Even if you might not consider a Sue to be a person, they&#39;re still people shaped, not some amorphous red evil glowing see-through blob with multiple tentacles and way too many  stingers and is drooling acid from a fanged mouth.<br><br>Like I said in my reply to this thread, I think we should only be doing clean kills, not stuff that&#39;s terribly drawn out.<br><br>Torture is bad, right? But with the right spin, you can make it funny. Even humorous.<br><br>Here&#39;s an example I used in the chatroom when we got on the subject. <br><br>Feeding a Sue to the Watcher in the Water is one thing. That&#39;s a clean kill, you&#39;re not doing anything extra to the Sue. You don&#39;t need to, and shouldn&#39;t go into massive detail.<br><br>Now, on the other hand, Agent A gets out a &#39;Kiss the cook&#39; apron and a funny hat and pretends to do a cooking show for her special guest at the best table in the restaurant, one Watcher in the water. Sue Skewer. Chop chop, don&#39;t forget to tenderize the meat, dear, you don&#39;t want the glitter to clump together while you cook, see, look, I have this handy morningstar we can use, and don&#39;t forget to keep her alive, it makes the meal so much tastier, her terror adds to the flavor, you see, we&#39;ll be dicing the fingers up and putting them into all the orifices after we get her filled up with some lovely gravy we&#39;ll be making from her feet, Sue toe lint gives it something extra....<br><br><br>The second can be funny. But it&#39;s torture, sadistic, and just way out there. But with what you&#39;re saying, from what I understand, it passes because it&#39;s funny, even though it&#39;s on the sadistic and horrible side.</p>

            <p>is less of a literal take on &#39;if it&#39;s funny, it&#39;s OK&#39; and more of &#39;if it&#39;s in the spirit of the PPC&#39;s humor, it&#39;s OK.&#39;<br><br>The PPC&#39;s spirit is to not step on it&#39;s own toes, and to practice what it preaches: no trivializing things, as an example.

It&#39;s unsettling to me to read torture-as-humor, not funny. Makes me wonder what else the person who wrote such a thing considers funny, or even just.<br><br>TL;DR-- It&#39;s in the spirit of the PPC to be Mad, not be a real psychopath, and things that are &#39;too much for PPC missions&#39; probably should fall under a we-practice-what-we-preach header. If we wouldn&#39;t like to see horrible torture trivialized, we probably shouldn&#39;t include it in our own missions... no matter how superficially funny the wording is. The same way that we consider trivialized rape is bad, we don&#39;t (or should not!) offer rape-as-humor, we probably should not offer torture-as-humor in our published material...<br><br>It&#39;s just not &#39;funny&#39; by the PPC standards of practicing what we preach.<br><br>Whoops, that was a long TL;DR.

            <p>I find any punishment that keeps the Sue alive indefinitely, rather than killing her, to be too harsh, but also problematic, because she might escape.<br><br>Of course, in my very first mission my agents handed the Sue over to Aragog, with the expressed purpose of letting it kill all her incarnations one by one, which just goes to show that I don&#39;t mind a reasonable amount of cruelty and prolonged suffering.</p>

            <p>I think the SO covers that when Jay and Acacia hand a Sue over to the Discworld Elves. Never leave a Sue alive, especially in a foreign canon.</p>

            <p>. . . I consulted with my brothers (both ex-USMC) about likely fates for the Sue, who was an overpowered bully in a military setting and disregarded rank, chain of command, or anything else in her quest to be Big Woman on Base. They gave me several ideas, which I unfortunately couldn&#39;t use because they might have technically run afoul of the torture clause. The two I remember are:<br><br>1) The ironing board treatment. Take the offender outside, place a common ironing board on top of them, and start piling the board with the heaviest things you can find. Has been known to happen to servicemen that screw others over (the way the Sue was doing), but it smacked too much of the old crush-a-witch-slowly thing.<br><br>2) Suicide watch. This one&#39;s psychological torture. If you hate someone, and the whole unit is focused on making that person&#39;s life miserable, one of the worst things you can do is have that person put on suicide watch. Now, in addition to being loathed by everyone around them, the hated person is never allowed to be alone and gets woken up once an hour every night. Ostensibly it&#39;s to make sure they don&#39;t kill themselves, but it&#39;s really just to drive them insane <i>and</i> make them suffer sleep deprivation. Again, it was too close to torture, and I had to shelve that one.<br><br>Moral of the story: don&#39;t consult with vengeful military guys when trying to dispose of a military Sue. Anything they propose is likely going to cross the line.</p>

            <p>Torture is out. Full stop. <br><br>If it qualifies as torture, even if you squint, you probably shouldn&#39;t use it in a mission. That is to say, so long as it&#39;s a clean kill, it&#39;s not overkill in my opinion, at least. <br><br>For example, let&#39;s put it this way. Say you decide to kill a Sue with fire. There&#39;re two ways you can go about this.<br><br>1) Setting her on fire, or;<br><br>2) Carefully burning her bit by bit and keeping her alive and awake through it until she&#39;s entirely burnt up.<br><br>It boils down to the same thing, (Sue Flambй, anyone?) but the execution is entirely different. With the second, you&#39;re willingly and consciously prolonging the pain and misery caused, and forcing the Sue to be conscious and aware of what&#39;s going on. <br><br>The first is a painful death too, yeah, but you aren&#39;t making the conscious choice to make it more painful or terrible than it is by default.<br><br>That said, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with scaring the crap out of the Sue before you actually get to the causing of bodily harm portion. (Like, say, waking the Sue up in the dreaded Room 101 and telling her.)</p>
