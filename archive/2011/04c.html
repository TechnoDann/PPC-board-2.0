            <p>So, on my latest search through the Vole Pit for something interesting, I run across this little number.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6184475/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_bspell_b_bbook_b_of_desires"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6184475/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_bspell_b_bbook_b_of_desires">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6184475/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_bspell_b_bbook_b_of_desires</a></a><br><br>On a cursory Glance, it breaks the laws of Canon, the Church, and good taste.  At the most basic level, it&#39;s a huge orgy of every het ship you could think of... but for what it does to Fred And George, it deserves to burn.<br><br>PS. but Bleepka goggles on beforehand.</p>

            <p>Are you having fun? Because I can&#39;t tell. I know you&#39;ve been around a while, but I can&#39;t recall seeing you in many threads, and the writing sample seems pretty ho-hum to me. I didn&#39;t really notice anything that sets your characters apart from the general milieu--though I suppose it doesn&#39;t help that the &quot;badfic&quot; was pre-made for the purpose, which strikes me as bit silly. You even posted your mood as &quot;blah&quot; on the sample. Overall, I&#39;m just looking for any sign that you&#39;re really into doing this, and I&#39;m not seeing it. (This is to say nothing of a variety of little errors I did see, like a Tolkien elf saying &quot;Oh my Eru&quot; or putting commas outside the quotes after dialogue lines that already have other end-punctuation.) So, uh, what&#39;s up?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Orken was directly under Kevin when he dumped his bucket. Spluttering and soaked, he searched the room for his partner. He had been hoping for a bit of a break, but instead he had been splashed with water, something he viewed as highly unprofessional. &quot;Agent Thomas! Were are you?&quot;<br><br>Thomas, who had been hit with one of the water guns, grabbed one of the balloons that had rolled in to the crowd. &quot;Right here, dude!&quot; He tossed the balloon back at Cali, laughing all the while. &quot;Take that, dude!&quot;<br><br>Orken, who had spotted the toss, rolled his eyes. There was too much of a crowd blocking the door, so he looked for spot where he could avoid being hit by the water guns. He spotted an easy chair that looked like it would suit his purposes.

            <p>Guvnor of Space and I are pleased to share an interlude we&#39;ve titled <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999/04i2dl.html">Dirty Laundry</a>, starring Agents Ilraen and Orken. For those keeping track, this takes place shortly after Nume and Ilraen&#39;s last mission, which happened late summer of 2010, so before any of Orken&#39;s appearances so far.<br><br>Speaking just for myself, some of you may notice (probably with relief) that I&#39;ve finally given up on Comic Sans MS.

            <p>This is just great!  I love how it starts with two characters who feel they should be antagonistic, but as they talk, they realize that they have no real reason to hate each other.  It&#39;s kind of a beautiful thing.  I&#39;d love to see Ilraen and Orken do a mission together sometime.  Maybe to <i>Animorphs</i>, so Orken can observe Ilraen acquiring and morphing a Yeerk?</p>

I worry that between Orken&#39;s determination to be professional and Ilraen&#39;s general avoidance of conflict it might actually go too well, so we may have to wait for something particularly aggravating--messing with canon relationships would do it for Ilraen; I&#39;m not sure about Orken, though.

            <p>In that book, the characters <i>did</i> start out as antagonists, and the Yeerk came to accept a changed viewpoint.  Here, we have characters who only hate each other because they think they&#39;re supposed to, but discover that, thanks to the harms they suffered at the hands of bad writing, they actually have a lot in common, and realize there was no reason to treat each other cruelly in the first place.</p>

            <p>...you overuse certain phrases like &#39;of course,&#39; &#39;in fact,&#39; &#39;apparently,&#39; etc. They add unnecessary words to the story diluting the story and slowing things down with pauses. If you go back and read sentences that include such phrases in most cases you&#39;ll find it reads just as well, if not better, without them. (Upon reading the rest of it, I find that this only applies to the introductory paragraphs and mostly disappears later on, but then the introduction is very important).  <br><br>The rest of my comments reflect what you already acknowledge yourself in the actors note at the bottom. It&#39;s a very serious exposition heavy work that probably dragged on a bit too much. <br><br>If you want a good introduction to the two agents and backstory behind the Animorphs continuum, this is certainly a gem though. :P</p>

Keep in mind that it would probably be rather different and end far less well between any other Yeerk and Andalite. There are some fairly special circumstances in play here. Still, I&#39;d like to think it COULD happen in canon, maybe with sufficient time between the war and the story. Like old war vets getting together 30 years later or so. After enough time, the fact that you were in the war means you have more in common with your former enemy than you do with most others.

            <p>I really like this interlude. You&#39;ve got a good balance of both humorous moments and more dramatic fare. The dialogue between Ilraen and Orken was interesting and well-constructed.

It just goes to show the complications inherent in the PPC&#39;s ragtag-misfit-type organization.<br><br>There were admittedly times when I felt like you were force-feeding me canonical information, but those moments were relatively inoffensive and over very quickly.

            <p>Actually, since you mention it, how would you like to beta my next mission? I was going to e-mail you at some point, but this seems as good a moment as any. In this case, it&#39;s a co-write with Tungsten Monk, set in Middle-earth with a main character that&#39;s supposedly Harry Potter. I warn you, it&#39;s long. We&#39;re currently working on cleaning it up and trimming it as much as we can stand, but it&#39;s still likely to be upwards of 25,000 words (we may release it in two parts). Would you be up for it? We&#39;ll probably be ready for beta next week or so, but I think I remember seeing that you&#39;re doing another beta, so whenever you&#39;re done with that would be fine.<br><br>As for this, thanks again.

            <p>I know nothing about the Animorphs continuum beyond what I&#39;ve learned reading your pieces, Neshomeh, but even so you&#39;ve explained it all well enough that I understood the issue in this interlude. And I very much enjoyed seeing the Agents work things out between themselves. The PPC&#39;s awesome for letting people who would normally be mortal enemies on principle actually get to know each other. :)<br><br>Great job, guys!</p>

            <p>Pretty much what Nesh said. Orken is, at the very least, afflicted by human desires. Half human is probably about right, even though he would likely never admit it.<br><br>Also, I&#39;m glad it makes sense. That&#39;s always a plus. </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know if this could <i>only</i> happen in the PPC, but it would sure be a lot harder anywhere else. Being orphans of badfic actually gives these two some common ground that they&#39;d never have in canon, and of course Ilraen wasn&#39;t really indoctrinated with the rest of his species&#39; prejudices. For practical purposes, he&#39;s at least half-human mentally, even as Orken is about half-human due to living as one physically. Topics for future conversations, perhaps.<br><br>I&#39;m glad it all makes sense.

            <p>I have, somewhat uncharacteristically, found myself in dire lack of reading materials. As soon as I found this was the case, something told me this might be the right place to ask for book suggestions.

            <p>I know I prefer sci-fi and fantasy as well, and these two series are the ones I always love coming back to:<br><br>&quot;Raven&#39;s Shadow&quot; and the sequel &quot;Raven&#39;s Strike&quot; by Patricia Briggs. Very good. I didn&#39;t even know there was a sequel for a long time, but I just kept reading the first one over and over again.<br><br>&quot;First Truth&quot;, &quot;Hidden Truth&quot;, &quot;Forgotten Truth&quot;, and &quot;Lost Truth&quot; by Dawn Cook. I read the last one first, and while it was wonderful, I needed to read the other three to explain stuff. It&#39;s still one of my favorite series ever. It&#39;s not really heavy, but it&#39;s interesting and touching. Same with Briggs&#39; two.<br><br>These both have tons of magic in them. Definitely good fantasy works. You should really look them up. =) Hope I helped.<br><br>~*P Raven</p>

            <p>Probably one of my all-time favorites is a book by Barry Hughart, called Bridge of Birds. It&#39;s a novel &quot;of an ancient China that never was&quot;, and feels like a fairy tale and a myth and a mystery all rolled into one neat, clever package. The plot is beautifully woven together; I can&#39;t think of a single throwaway mention off the top of my head. Further, no matter how many times I read it, it&#39;s one of the books that never fails to make me emote. Be emotional. Something.<br><br>Might be hard to find, though. I think it was published in the 80s and every bookstore I go to has no copies. :/ Only drawback.<br><br>Hmm. Read Kris Longknife books at all? By Mike Shepherd. Basically, daughter of a politician announces &#39;well, this is fun and all, but I&#39;m joining the space Navy, seeya Dad.&#39; Intrigue and action ensues. Remarkable because I usually dislike the books have a military focus, because I&#39;ve experienced that they tend to go gunsgunsguns military is awesome guns solve all problems check out how amazing our guns are aren&#39;t they fab, but somehow either these books just straight up don&#39;t go for the technobabble and guns route or I missed it somewhere in the characters and plot. First book&#39;s called Mutineer.</p>

            <p>The Song of Ice and Fire series by George RR Martin of course a great series if you haven&#39;t already dabbled in it. Magic is very subtle and rare, and mostly lends itself to political intrigue and world building. Four books so far with the fifth promised to come out soon. It&#39;s recently been recreated as an HBO series which just started airing. <br><br>I&#39;ve been reading Steven Erickson&#39;s Malazan Book of the Fallen series. It&#39;s a high magic setting with tons of characters, and every single one of those characters is a fantastic badass in one way or another. Plots get layered thicker and thicker and Xanatos Gambits abound. Each book is huge and there&#39;s like ten of them so it&#39;d keep you busy for awhile. </p>

            <p>SRS BSNS is a no go? There goes my blanket recommendation of 1984.<br><br>What else? Hm, if you have time, Stephen King&#39;s /The Dark Tower/ series is an interesting Sci-fi/fantasy combo. It&#39;s really long, but if you have time, it is pretty good, especially the earlier books.<br><br>On top of that, I can recommend pretty much anything he has written as at least okay ish. His non-horror is better than his horror in my opinion. Specifically, I&#39;d recommend /The Green Mile/ and /Four Seasons./ The second one is a collection of four novellas, including my favorite thing he has ever written, &quot;Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;d also recommend /Lord of the Rings/ but I&#39;m assuming you have already done that.<br><br>Oh, and how does one do italics on this board?</p>

            <p>The Orphan&#39;s Tales duology by Catherynne M Valente. The prose is kinda heavy, but it&#39;s really good. It&#39;s about this girl with stories tattooed on her eyes telling a boy who might be the heir to the Sultanate stories in the garden. The stories are really complicated, because a character in a story will start telling a story about a character who tells a story and so on and so forth, but it&#39;s basically about *deep breath* sea-faring saints, dead stars, firebirds, tree-girls, dead cities of artists, dead cities of detritus populated by ghosts who kidnap children to mint bones into coins, seventh-seventh sons, huldras, manticores, a glaistig eunuch, a girl made of tea, and a lot more.   (Also, if you don&#39;t mind a certain amount, of, um, sex scenes, try her stand-alone Palimpsest, which is about a sexually transmitted city.)<br>And if you like sci-fi, Cyteen is really good too. And the Morgaine series, although it&#39;s a little bit of both there. </p>

            <p>I personally like the Leviathan series, but it&#39;s less sci-fi and more steampunk/alternate history. It takes place in World War I, and the first book actually starts shortly after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The story follows his (made-up) son Aleksander Ferdinand, and a member of the British Royal Air Force, Dylan Sharp. The thing about Dylan, and don&#39;t worry this isn&#39;t a spoiler to anyone at all, is that his real name is Deryn Sharp, and he is a she. It also has some real world parallels, explained at the back of both books, and the unique thing about the story is that instead of Allies Vs. Central Powers, it&#39;s Darwinists Vs. Clankers. Darwinists are those who use genetically engineered animals for warfare and everyday things, like a flying whale or dogs that can sniff out hydrogen leaks, while Clankers are countries that use machines for warfare and everyday things, like Walkers for transportation or a giant mechanical spider with cannons on top of it. The Unites States use a combination of the two, in case you were wondering.</p>

            <p>Here are a few sci-fi/fantasy stories that not very many people seem to have stumbled across and which I think are pretty good.  Not particularly deep reading, but fun.<br>Tanith Lee&#39;s Silver Metal Lover and Metallic Love are sci-fi romances involving an alternate earth, future technology, and humanoid robots.<br>Eric Flint and David Freer&#39;s duology (?) of Pyramid Scheme and Pyramid Power are fun, if not particularly accurate, romps through Greek, Egyptian, and Norse mythology.  If you want, the first one can be read free online <a href="http://www.webscription.net/10.1125/Baen/067131839X/067131839X.htm?blurb"> here. </a><br>Also, if you don&#39;t mind wandering over to the young adult section, the Enchanted Forest Chronicles by Patricia C.

            <p>...then try &quot;The Chronicles of Amber&quot; by Roger Zelazny. It&#39;s kind of an old series, but it&#39;s pretty good. Basically, the one true world is Amber and all the other worlds in in the multiverse are just &#39;shadows&#39; of it, except for Chaos, but that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother can of worms. Anyway, the first book starts with the main character waking up in a hospital with amnesia. (Yeah, it&#39;s a used beginning, but it works quite well.)<br>It can get kind of- well, quite a bit- squicky at times, though. If you don&#39;t mind a spoiler, I could tell you the squickiest part and then you could decide if you want to read it or not.</p>

            <p><i>The Wheel of Time Series</i> by Robert Jordan - Not for everyone.  I like it but some don&#39;t.  It slows down after the first three books, which turns a lot of people off.<br><br><i>The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever</i> by Stephen R. Donaldson - This one has a lot of SRS BSNS and really gets pretty dark at times, especially in the First Chronicles.  It is still an excellent series and I highly recommend it.<br><br><i>The Deathgate Cycle</i> by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman - Quite good.  The ending is a little flat, but the rest is very enjoyable.</p>

            <p>Hi. A new newbie has appeared! ;] I&#39;ve actually read the original PPC fics a while back but only just now decided to stalk this board and introduce myself. On FanFiction.net my (current) pen name is Kitty&#39;s Muse, but on many sites I&#39;m KittyKat1001001 (as no one EVER claims that username except myself, heh). I&#39;m an (almost) adult who used to be obsessed with Twilight more than a year ago (and wrote some horrible fanfiction that I refuse to think about to this day) and I&#39;m currently obsessed with Hetalia. Thanks to you guys and your stories I found out what a Mary Sue was all those long (and dark) months ago and so figured out that I was writing quite horribly at the time. (In fact, I might use one of my Twilight OCs as an agent later on...) I&#39;m also Kitty in IAHF, for anyone who knows about that. (I saw Karen Elaine DuLay around on here, hence why I mentioned that. ;]) Also, I tend to be a bit of a Grammar Nazi at times. I... don&#39;t think I have any questions at this time. So hi? :]</p>

            <p>You all are being so awesome! (I didn&#39;t know which one to reply to so I just replied to the main post.) Thank you for all of the various gifts (cyber ones are just as awesome as those in real life! ;]). And I&#39;m glad to see that there are some other Hetalia fans on here. (I&#39;ve read lots of other things too but I&#39;m just a LITTLE obsessed right now...) I could just tell Karen easily &#39;cause her name was also the same. Glad to see other IAHFers/people/what-have-you!<br><br>As to the Twilight OC that I might use as an agent... Well... Heh. She&#39;s actually an elf (not even of LoTR origin!) in the fic that bears her name. Luckily I gave her a revamp (no pun intended) and so she&#39;d be mostly a sort of joke. I might also use my self-insert (I&#39;m guessing those are okay, right? Let me know if I&#39;m wrong!) but only after she&#39;s &#39;graduated&#39; from IAHF. This is mainly because I find her warped nature highly amusing and might make references to that &#39;time period&#39; of her life. I still have lots of time though, right? ;]</p>

            <p>&#39;Sup, guys? My name is Herr Wozzeck, and I sort of just stumbled across this place. Good thing I did, too.<br><br>I&#39;m a fanfic author myself, perhaps best known in fanfiction circles for my fairly long Mass Effect SI &quot;Mass Vexations&quot; and its sequel. IRL, I&#39;m a student who is studying music composition at the moment and hoping through a whole series of delusions of grandeur to eventually write for one of the world&#39;s major orchestras. My interests lie in gaming (chiefly with stuff like Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Dead Space, and other things), zombie fiction, movies, and other stuff, and I run a film criticism blog on Blogspot called, appropriately enough, Herr Wozzeck Reviews.<br><br>And I&#39;m also a nut for 20th Century concert music by the likes of Varèse, Schoenberg, Berg, Webern, Stockhausen, Boulez, and Ligeti. If you recognized at least one of those names without having to go to Google, you deserve a massive cookie. And if you don&#39;t know... go check &#39;em out. Give them a chance, because atonal music needs more love in this world.<br><br>So yeah... That&#39;s all for me. I hope to have a good time here. =D</p>

            <p>Hi! Have some fudge!<br><br>I normally listen to local classical station KVNO (<a href="http://www.kvno.org">www.kvno.org</a>).  Their playlist tends to be earlier periods, but I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;ve run some Schoenberg and Webern.  But most of my listening time is at work, and of course customers tend to show up when they&#39;re announcing what&#39;s playing next ;) .</p>

            <p>Thanks! :D<br><br>Yeah. I checked out one of their playlists just now, and if they have run some Schoenberg or Webern I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. They&#39;ve got quite few new music people on there (Michael Torke was mentioned at one point) as well as some of the bigger names of 20th Century music (I caught a mention of Bartok in there), so that sort of lends itself to that direction.<br><br>You seem to be blessed with a really good classical station. =D</p>

            <p>Okay. I&#39;m here for less than a day, and already I have a badfic to share with you guys. But I&#39;ve been acquainted with this for a while, even going so far as to have a [currently] two-part rant journal on DeviantArt to go on about how much I absolutely despise this fic, so...<br><br>This fic is really, really bad. Yeah, okay, the spelling isn&#39;t actually as horrible as you&#39;d think, but it does have a Black Hole Sue, poorly paced action scenes, major character derailment, and absolutely no grasp of narrative structure.<br><br>The thing that REALLY makes it a badfic, though? It&#39;s essentially a fanfic full of politically-based author filibuster, and in that regard it&#39;s absolutely SHAMELESS. I can&#39;t adequately describe how badly it manages to mess up the Mass Effect canon as a result, so I&#39;ll just let you see that for yourself: <br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6765057/1/The_Patriots"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6765057/1/The_Patriots">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6765057/1/The_Patriots</a></a><br><br>And the craziest part?

            <p>I sincerely doubt he&#39;s actually interested in becoming a better writer: a lot of things about his second story reek of trying to kiss the ass of near-on everyone in fanfiction.net&#39;s ME fandom if you have a clear idea of what he was like and why he took down the original story in the first place. While his first story was still up, he consistently ignored concrit, to the point that he didn&#39;t even reply to some people. The only things he responded to were snark/political statements in a review, and he almost always attacked the views of the other person he was talking to, even when they were on the same side of the spectrum. He repeatedly denied the conservative subtext his first story had, so it probably means he&#39;s blind to the myriad problems in his writing. And as of this posting, many of the problems that were independent of the conservative subtext (such as poor pacing, no sense of narrative structure, bad/stereotyped characterizations, and implausible things happening according to the canon he&#39;s working in) are still present in this new story of his, and they don&#39;t show any signs of going away.<br><br>Also, the biggest reason he took down his first fic was because he couldn&#39;t take the hatedom that had started accumulating around it. Trust me, he told several people (including myself) that it was the biggest reason why he took it down in a series of PM&#39;s. He actually worded it more like he wanted to quit, so I was amazed that he even posted the second story to begin with.<br><br>What he&#39;s referring to is nothing in any actual reviews I wrote: it was general hostilities that occurred between the two of us. And he started the fire, I didn&#39;t: I left a review saying that &#39;hey, there are too many political overtones and it&#39;s to this thing&#39;s detriment&#39;. It was pretty calm, collected, and fairly constructive.<br><br>Of course, when I cited the Tea Party and the Vietnam War as two examples of reasons why America wasn&#39;t the greatest nation in the world as his pro-America undertones were saying, he went to town tearing me apart for &quot;liberal&quot; views that I never actually said I had. (He literally opened that reply with &quot;How dare you accuse the Tea Party as a bad thing&quot;.) That led to a mildly snarky reply where, honestly, I said a thing or two that I probably shouldn&#39;t have said. In the reply to that, though, he had the nerve to say that he respected my opinion, when it was clear that he really didn&#39;t. That was where I stopped giving thought to being polite and got outright hostile with him, so what followed after that was what he&#39;s referring to. I think stating that I had an overreaction is putting it mildly, now that I think about it. But for me, there&#39;s a special place in hell for people who attack your views and then say they respect them. That pretty much fueled the hostilities, as well as the fact that I refuse to be respectful to anyone who can&#39;t be bothered enough to treat people&#39;s opinions with any form of respect (especially when they deny their disrespect).<br><br>I think a large part of why I saved the documents after he took it down was actually kind of personal, as was reuploading it to the internet. Thinking about why I was so pissed off about it, I realize I have no need to constantly re-upload stuff. So... I took it down from Googledocs.<br><br>But if you think I&#39;m the only one who took things out of hand, that&#39;s not actually true: he overblew some things about the whole fiasco too. He claimed that I had called him a facist, a bigot, and a racist despite the fact that I never used any of those terms to his face or otherwise-- and he knew it, too. <br><br>If we do meet on neutral ground... he might strangle me anyway. Mostly because I&#39;ll start the conversation by scolding him rather harshly for the naming habits of his characters. But know that I won&#39;t scold him because they&#39;re inherently awful: it&#39;s more because said habits are extremely dangerous to him and to other people he knows IRL.</p>

            <p>This is why you don&#39;t sell only half a story.<br><br>The fact that he&#39;s starting a second story despite the first one is more suggestive than you think it might be; it&#39;s saying he&#39;s still interested in giving it a shot.

            <p>I see your point on the starting the second story. For now, though, I&#39;m not holding my breath that he actually will improve in writing style. The fact that his second story greatly tones it down on the pro-conservative subtext is honestly a step forward, but it&#39;s not a big enough improvement to cover all the other errors I mentioned before. Trust me, I do think the writing was genuinely bad, even before the hostilities began. So until he gets to those errors as well...<br><br>As for everything else...

            <p>To an extent. I for one tend to think that an extremely Renegade interpretation of Shepard gets pushed a little far-- actually, make that way too far-- when he kicks all of the crew of the Normandy off, and then goes on threatening to rape one of his former crew members for absolutely no reason whatsoever in the middle of a firefight.<br><br>Also, there is absolutely NO reason that can make any amount of sense for Shepard to become a punch-clock villain for anyone who isn&#39;t Cerberus.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d also recommend bringing some brain bleach or some of that Bleeprin stuff I&#39;ve seen mentioned around here: some of the developments are so startlingly idiotic I&#39;m shocked that I&#39;ve still been updating my rant journals as consistently as he&#39;s been updating this badfic. And it&#39;s not exclusive to the stuff that violates ME canon, either; it&#39;s also a lot of the other things that show up. (The naturalization part? *shudders*)</p>

            <p>I&#39;d personally suggest you stop. Getting too hung up about bad fanfic is a recipe for disaster, because there&#39;ll always be more of it somewhere. The author has obviously refused to listen to concrit, so you&#39;re really just wasting time if you continue to go on about it. This is just my opinion, I&#39;ll admit, but I am speaking from experience here.</p>

            <p>Yuck. That&#39;s bad. And it has what I feel is the Super Badfic Indicator in it-- shallow author wank, without appealing to the feelings and interests of others.<br><br>I think it might even be worse in a canon like Mass Effect, which is Bioware and has so many choices to make... you can do what you want... and you choose THIS? :<br> </p>

            <p>There was a lot I liked about this mission.  It is probably the best mission I have read in a long time. Hats off to you for slogging through that horrible grammar and canon warping.<br><br><br><b>Likes:</b>  The cold mite.  Maybe. That was great. <br><br>That Thomas kept repeating his name and RC number. I had never really thought about what to do in that kind of situation, but that seemed to fit perfectly.<br><br>The quotes were well balanced by action, and thoroughly contributed to the mission.<br><br>The way you give point of view to the minis. I am especially liking O&#39;Neil.  I wonder what evil plots he has in store for Thomas now that he has confirmed that Thomas is humoring him, and not actually understanding his speech.<br><br>The agents&#39; personalities are really coming together. Either of them separately I don&#39;t think would be very entertaining, but the two of them together balance very well.<br><br>I hate it when fanficcers engage in Rodney bashing, so I was glad to see how angry Thomas got about that.<br><br>I&#39;m glad that you saved the Science Lad with the Simgen--that was really bad.<br><br>I was with Thomas on being ready to pulverize the Sue, but in the end, I agree with Orken. It was a thoroughly satisfying ending.<br><br><br><br><b>Improvements: </b>There were a couple of places where the bolding of the quotes seemed to drop for a word or two.<br><br>I know they collected the minis at the end of the mission, but I was wondering all throughout where the minis were. Did they just leave them where they found them and go back? That would be fine with me, but I wasn&#39;t very sure.<br><br><br><br><b>Thought:</b>  What would happen if two minis fell in love and started a family according to whatever means was normal for their species, would they have little mini children?  I&#39;ve got Hauk&#39;Tauri, and I&#39;ve been wondering what would happen if he and Col. Crater <i>liked</i> each other.  :D<br><br></p>

            <p>But, since it&#39;s a mega of a mini, then it would just be a normal-sized whatever it is. See, you can&#39;t have a mini-mini-Wraith. The two minis cancel each other out, see? <br><br>Admittedly, that explanation isn&#39;t correct logically or grammatically, but it would probably be more amusing.

            <p>Okay--so I&#39;m one of those long-time readers, first-time posters.  It&#39;s, um, lovely to ... meet you all, I guess?<br><br>Anyway.  One day, a classmate of mine showed me something a former friend of hers wrote a few years ago:  <a href="http://www.mediaminer.org/fanfic/view_ch.php?cid=558608&amp;submit=View+Chapter&amp;id=159340"><a href="http://www.mediaminer.org/fanfic/view_ch.php?cid=558608&amp;submit=View+Chapter&amp;id=159340">http://www.mediaminer.org/fanfic/view_ch.php?cid=558608&amp;amp;submit=View+Chapter&amp;amp;id=159340</a></a><br><br>I&#39;ll admit, it&#39;s not the worst fic I&#39;ve ever read.  It&#39;s not terribly long, and I&#39;m actually pretty happy with spelling and grammar for the most part.  BUT.  What the author managed to pull off with Optimus Prime, Megatron, Starscream, and UNICRON (yes, you read that right) is just, just ... eurgh, as Lavender Brown would say.<br><br>*shudders*<br><br>Goggles are highly recommended.</p>

            <p>Hello fellow new poster! (Though it sounds like you were around here for much longer than I was.) And you already found a possible badfic. Not bad! (And since I know next to nothing about Transformers I probably won&#39;t read it...) Here, have an extra pair of socks- you never know when you&#39;ll need socks. They can be even used as (improbable) weapons if you feel a need to improvise!</p>

            <p>You might want to be careful about this one. There&#39;s a lot of stuff on the internet that are intensely squicky but not badly written per se; the spelling and grammar is good, the characters still retain most of their personality, etcetera. You may find what&#39;s being described distasteful, but unless it&#39;s being described badly, we can&#39;t really spork it. A fic can be NSFW, but still SFB, if you understand me. <br><br>I don&#39;t really know much about Transformers canon, so I can&#39;t give a judgement on how in- or out-of-character everyone is. My advice is just, as I said before, proceed with caution. This &#39;ere might be a tricky one.<br><br>P.S. Newbie, eh? And a former lurker, for that matter? Well, welcome to the club, and have a fuzzy scarf for your sins. </p>

            <p>Neshomeh was right, it&#39;s the Playscriptes. Specifically the second one, and even more specifically, scene 3:<br><br>~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Daisy: Let&#39;s see. You know about the three so-called &#39;physical&#39; dimensions, yes?<br>Alex: Up and down, side to side, and back and forth, yes. And the fourth one is time. But what about the other two?<br>Daisy: Very good. The other two, then, are probability and consciousness.<br>Alex: But that can&#39;t be right. You can&#39;t move in consciousness, or probability for that matter. [Pause] Can you?<br>Daisy: Agent Orange, you move in probability every time you go into an alternate fic-verse. And, to a lesser extent, every time you use a portal. It&#39;s the difference between the probability of you being at one end over the other, and the ability to change those probabilities, that make them work.<br>Alex: Portals change probabilities? But they can&#39;t do that without changing the laws of physics. If they try, they make a-<br>Daisy: Plothole, yes. Not many people know this, but portals were originally made from plotholes. In fact, as I&#39;ve just explained, they still are.<br>Alex: [Nods slowly] All right. Probability, yes. But what about consciousness?<br>Daisy: Alex, you already know about this one. How do you get between places in HQ as fast as possible?<br>Alex: You don&#39;t pay attention to the route. Everyone knows... oh. Oh<br>Daisy: Exactly. A move &#39;backwards&#39; in consciousness, that is, a move towards the unconscious, tends to make the route shorter. I say tends to, as there are some places, such as where you first met me, where it is still necessary to be on the right floor.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>So, 1 (left-right), 2 (up-down), 3 (in-out), 4 (time), 5 (probability), 6 (consciousness). They proceed to use carefully tuned alcohol to get around quickly.<br><br>Of course, it&#39;s possible HQ has more dimensions - but 6 is all the Flowers can see. (And no, I don&#39;t /think/ they can see time directly - but time&#39;s always the odd one out).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Headquarters exists in six dimensions. The world that humans can see and move around in is in three directions. You know, 3d.<br><br>HEY YOU GUYS. SLIGHT SPECULATION TIME. LET ME KNOW IF THIS SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT:<br><br>It&#39;s very hard to imagine, but think of it this way: Somebody tells you to move in a direction that is not forward, back, sideways, up, or down. You can&#39;t actually do that-- that&#39;s the three dimensional world we live in. But the Flowers can move in those other directions at will, and see in them too. Headquarters is also built in those other directions that most people can&#39;t see or comprehend. <br><br>Really, part of the reason why Headquarters is hard to navigate is because humans (and others) in HQ may be moving in those other directions in any given time and not know it. So when you think you&#39;re turning left, you may actually be turning something you <i>think </i>is left, but is really not left, right, up, down, sideways, forwards or back. The not-left direction may look and seem left to you, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s a totally different way.<br><br>Hence the wrong turns and how paying attention while walking gets you nowhere. If you can&#39;t even comprehend the direction you&#39;re supposed to go, sometimes just not caring where you go can allow you to take that path that you don&#39;t even know is there...</p>

            <p>What&#39;s your internet browser?<br><br>I use Internet Explorer, and apparently there&#39;s supposed to be an image that shows you something to write down. The problem was that the image was blocked by my browser&#39;s security settings, and I think the message that scrolled at the top of the screen said something about the image not matching up to some kind of security certificate or something.<br><br>Either way, it&#39;s probably your browser&#39;s security settings.<br><br>If you use IE, it should flash you a message at the top of the page saying they had to block some content, and usually they&#39;ll tell you to click something to disregard that particular security setting.

I have a full Character Design Reference poster for Pam as well, which is available <i>on request over IRC only</i> due to the large size of the file and the limited amount of bandwidth on my webs account. Both characters have a list of supporting characters that they were designed to be used in conjunction with (but are capable of functioning without), as well as <i>very</i> brief summary of each one. <br><br>The last character I have considered writing is a character named &quot;Pants McGee&quot; who will be a &quot;completely faceless, nameless generic protagonist meant as a stand-in for the audience to insert themselves into&quot; that becomes self-aware of his own lack of characterization and develops his own unique personality, traits and identity as a character over the course of his adventures, also based partially on the fact that he starts with little or nothing and must figure it out himself. Due to the genericized nature of &quot;Pants&quot; however, I cannot do any designing of the character at this moment. <br><br>Since I like writing the missions collaboratively --I just find it more fun that way-- I left them unattached to any particular department. I&#39;m going to cast them as contract workers that just go wherever they&#39;re needed, so it would be easier for me to justify bringing them to different departments to work with other people&#39;s agents more easily. <br><br>For first missions, I already have two done up; Both of these were done as collaborations with other people that had Official Permission. I wrote the bulk of the narration, and we both wrote our respective characters&#39; parts, dialogue and actions. Only one is available online at the moment, and it is the second in the series, which will be titled <i>Tangodown!</i> and hosted on its own webs account. <br><br>        <b><u>Call of Duty: Mushy Warfare Too</u></b><br>This one was done as a collaboration with <b>Techno-Dann</b>, featuring his characters Dann and Sarge, and my character Pam Ritchie. It takes place in the <i>Call of Duty</i> continuum, more specifically <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</i>, and I&#39;m not exactly sure where the story&#39;s set because there&#39;s really no continuity or reference to the original canon material at all. Credits and acknowledgements are given at the beginning, and citations are at the end, along with a short four-paragraph essay by me <i>&quot;Post-Carnage Report with DML&quot;</i> on romance and characterization and a <i>Technical Q&amp;A</i> section. I intend to include similar sections on any and all missions I write.<br>           Approximately 13.4k words. <br><a href="http://delta-mike-lima.webs.com/apps/blog/show/6880047-call-of-duty-mushy-warfare-too">Link to <i>Tangodown!</i></a><br><i>Citations are given in the pdfs. Let me know if I missed anything and I&#39;ll add it in. </i><br></font></p>

            <p>Note: I am not a Permission Giver, nor do I reflect the opinions of Permission Givers.<br><br>You&#39;re definitely off to a good start. Pam is an interesting character who has a great deal of potential in terms of both humor and drama. I look forward to seeing her future adventures. It should also be noted that your attention to detail and willingness to go the extra mile are admirable qualities.<br><br>That being said, I had some pressing concerns run through my mind while reading this. People have already mentioned the formatting stuff, so I won&#39;t say anything about that. What I will say is that the text felt very dry and clinical, especially when you were unloading all the various military weapons specs. It&#39;s great that you&#39;re specific and everything, but there is such a thing as going too far with non-plot related information. The audience doesn&#39;t really need or want to know what kind of carbine stock Pam has on her rifle or what company made her grenade launcher. It messes up the pacing of the story and, frankly, it&#39;s a little dull. You&#39;ve got to learn to trim away some of those extra details.<br><br>Anyway, not too shabby overall. I look forward to seeing what you do in the future.</p>

            <p><font>Thanks. The character itself has been through numerous iterations because I wasn&#39;t sure how to write it at the time of its creation; the choice to write a character completely different from me, with completely different issues, completely different expectations and with a completely different worldview was a challenge I wanted to take on, and I&#39;m glad it seems to be turning out well so far. I&#39;m also glad the extra parts I put into the episode did not go unnoticed, as well. <br><br>I&#39;ll see what I can do in future episodes about all the weapon talk; part of the thing behind <i>Call of Duty</i> is that they occasionally do spend a bit too much time focusing on the weapons and equipment to try to make things seem more &#39;authentic&#39; and it&#39;s embarrassing when they get things wrong or when things look out of place, or have been inserted for rule-of-cool. I could and probably will tone that back for other or future episodes that aren&#39;t so modern or military-oriented; you&#39;re not the only person that&#39;s told me that my attention to the weapons and equipment specifics goes slightly too far.<br><br>I&#39;m not exactly sure what you mean by &#39;dry and clinical&#39; at the moment; occasionally I try to go for a somewhat sarcastic tone of voice when writing (a good example of this would be describing the way the law of lost plot critical items could have obfuscated something), but I felt that in this application it was best to keep the narration laid back, somewhat objective and down to earth, even if I did load it up with a lot of superfluous detail. </font></p>

            <p>You have a title page. You have a table of contents. You have authors notes. You have multiple chapters. A short essay on characterization afterwards. Technical questions. A link to us. And finally, a bibliography. A goddamn bibliography.<br><br>Tell me, DML, does overacheiving come naturally to you, or are you intentionally trying to make me look and/or feel bad? <br><br>Jesus. <br><br>(Oh, and the mission was good too. My only comments have to do with formatting, rather than actual content. You seem to be indenting rather sporadically, which tends to be slightly distracting (for me, anyway). Same with the little section break things. Three asterisks or summat would make it much more clear that it&#39;s a new section of ths story. It&#39;s not really something to be too concerned about, it&#39;s just something you might want to watch out for in the future.)<br><br>Hope I helped,<br>L&#39;Homme Arbre</p>

            <p><font>Howdy! Thank you very much, the feedback is appreciated. <br><br>I&#39;ll try to fix up the indenting. I suppose I could put soft linebreaks after each one, as well if that&#39;ll help clear things up, and I&#39;ll replace the horizontal rules with the asterisks next update, which should be soon.

            <p>I would suggest that you have a beta give it a going-over next time--there were a couple of mistakes like &quot;baring&quot; for &quot;bearing&quot;--but overall, I enjoyed it very much. It&#39;s a treat to see someone else who knows Cadfael . . . though the existence of Cadfael Sues continues to baffle me.<br><br>You also took an interesting tack with the mission which I enjoyed: the obvious respect for the canon brother, to the point of possibly disobeying the Duty in order to keep a promise to him and to a deity, really underlines the purpose and commitment of the PPC. In the end, it&#39;s all about respect for the original stories. Kudos!<br><br>And I&#39;d love to adopt Chiara, but I already have more characters than I know what to do with. XD Besides, I don&#39;t think she&#39;d get along with the ancient Greek.</p>

            <p>Yeah, that always happens . . . I&#39;m still finding mistakes in stories I published <i>years</i> ago. *facepalm*<br><br>I&#39;d love to have a mini if you find one, though I can&#39;t promise to put him in with the rest of my agents. :D Nevertheless, I daresay I can find something for a twelfth-century monk to do . . . </p>

            <p>...it just doesn&#39;t work. :( Could you possibly change the type color to white or some other not-dark color please? I don&#39;t think my eyes can handle it, so I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to wait a bit to read the fic.</p>

            <p>Awesome job! I love how you had to keep the Sue alive instead of killing her. Did you intend to do that from the start, or did it just happen?<br><br>~* Raven</p>

            <p>I went over it a couple of times, and realized that the Sue was just sort of annoying, not really bad. It was just sort of.... Meh. And then the main character was so out of it that he saw my Agents, and then one thing led to another. *shrugs*<br><br>It was fun, though!</p>

            <p>Highlighting everything on screen makes it readable, but one more vote for a type color change, please?<br><br>Interesting mission, I&#39;ve been fond of the Cadfael novels for years.  I have no idea where the Suethor got the idea that anorexic would be seen as beautiful in the 12th century,  Someone built like that would never survive childbirth, her relatives should have shoved her into a convent and used a normally-proportioned sister or cousin for the marriage alliance.</p>
