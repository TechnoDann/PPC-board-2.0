            <p>It&#39;s been awhile since we had one of these, so here it is! The PPC Boarder Shipfic Fest, 2011. <br><br>For those of you poor souls that are confused as to what this means, it means writing ship fic (or snippets) for us here on the board!<br><br>There are generally two rules:<br><br>1) Don&#39;t ship anyone who doesn&#39;t want to participate. So if you&#39;re game? Awesome! Shout about it in here, let everyone know. If you don&#39;t want to be shipped, also shout loudly and let everyone know. <br>2) Keep it PG-13ish or lower so that no one is unintentionally heavily traumatised.<br><br>The third rule is, if you&#39;re going to be involved as being shipped, do some shipping yourself! Write! Comment! Giggle! Reply! Make terrible innuendo filled jokes that clog the gutter.<br><br>You are heavily encouraged to write reply fic involving the person who wrote you in one.<br><br><br>On your mark, get ready, SHIIIIIIIIP!<br><br>(You can take this thread as my being amendable to being shipped.)<br></p>

            <p>Guvnor looked over his shoulder- He had managed to escape molestation, for the most part. He heard a soft hummed rendition of ‘white and nerdy’ coming from the restroom. He fought the urge to look, and continued on. <br><br>“Why do they always do that... I love that sone.” He said sadly before he realized the error of his ways “I MEANT SONG! SONG!” but it was too late. He heard a soft giggle from behind him. There was a sharp prick on his arm and suddenly things started looking a little hazy and... sexy? <br><br>The last thing he remembered seeing was being tackled by a questionably dressed Sonne.</p>

            <p>Pretzel, having felt rather lonely the past few hours, wandered around the Board, deftly dodging those of her fellow Boarders who had found their own form of entertainment as she walked. She had discarded the hula dancer outfit a while ago, and now was clad only in a few very wide silk ribbons that were strategically placed on her body. A spare one was tied rather jauntily around her head, serving no real purpose but to flutter prettily on occasion as Pretzel walked.<br><br>It took her some time, but eventually Pretzel found someone entirely unoccupied with anyone else; he was also fully dressed and still surrounded by his newbie gifts. Pretzel nodded in satisfaction. He would do wonderfully. <br><br>Untying the ribbon from around her head, Pretzel snuck up behind the unsuspecting newbie and quickly looped the ribbon over his head, using it as an impromptu blindfold. This took some skill, as Pretzel was about three inches shorter than Teddy, and barefoot to boot.<br><br>&#39;Hey there,&#39; Pretzel said with a grin, even though Teddy couldn&#39;t see her do so. &#39;You look like you&#39;re a bit lost. Need someone to show you around?&#39;<br><br>Teddy, having found that Pretzel had neglected to restrain his hands in any manner, merely pushed the blindfold off his head and then turned around. His eyebrows rose at the sight of Pretzel&#39;s unconventional attire- the ribbons were a dark coppery color rather than the more traditional red one might expect, with three gear-shaped pins holding the entire ensemble together in key places -but then he shrugged. For all he knew, it was traditional to send a ribbon-clad woman as a guide for newbies, though he wasn&#39;t entirely sure about <i>that</i>.<br><br>&#39;Sure,&#39; Teddy replied. &#39;Although, I&#39;ve got to ask, is this-&#39; He gestured at the chaos going on in the Board at the moment, &#39;normal, or is there something going on?&#39;<br><br>Pretzel blinked, and then looked around her. &#39;Oh, this?&#39; She waved a hand in a dismissive gesture. &#39;Nah, this is a special occasion. As a matter of fact, why don&#39;t you follow me, and I can tell you just <i>how</i> special it really is.&#39;<br><br>There was a dark chuckle from behind Pretzel, which made the petite Boarder turn around, the ends of her ribbons flaring out a bit as she did so. Behind her was a carbon copy of Teddy, though this one was sans goatee and was dressed in a stylish black suit. Teddy groaned.<br><br>&#39;I thought I got rid of you a while ago,&#39; he said in annoyance. His twin merely smirked.<br><br>&#39;I&#39;m your evil twin, Teddy,&#39; evil!Teddy said. &#39;You can&#39;t get rid of me that easily.&#39; He turned to Pretzel, who was looking mildly apprehensive. &#39;Now, about that tour?&#39;<br><br>Pretzel looked from one Teddy to the other and then back again, shrugged, and then nodded. &#39;Sure, why not? The more the merrier,&#39; she said, a few tantalizing thoughts running through her head that involved finding out just how many uses ribbons actually had. She picked up the one she had used as the temporary blindfold and then beckoned to the two Teddys. &#39;Follow me...&#39;</p>

            <p>OOC: Yes, dearheart, those ideas did pan out! In fact, it&#39;s given me several ideas for when I start writing, so cheers for that! Also, that slash is very funny indeed :) Right, I&#39;d better get cracking...<br><br><br>&quot;I had no idea ribbons had so many uses...&quot; Teddy said wistfully as he walked out of the side-room, to which he had been led. Teddy&#39;s evil twin had stayed behind, to do lord-only-knows. Actually, Teddy knew exactly what he had stayed behind for. Some people were never satisfied... He wandered off, naked save for a piece of ribbon which he&#39;d stolen from Pretzel. He wore it like a fig leaf. As he rounded a corner, he began to sing &#39;I&#39;m in The Mood For Dancing&#39;.<br><br>&quot;Ah, I thought he&#39;d never leave,&quot; Evil!Teddy said softly. &quot;Now for the second course! Seconds!&quot; He giggled maniacally, sauntered to his discarded suit, and started rummaging through the pockets. Pretzel pulled a face halfway between excitement and worry. He WAS evil, after all - there was no telling what he was looking for. She began to fiddle with a length of ribbon, discarded earlier, which was laying close-by.<br><br>&quot;Aha!&quot; Evil!Teddy shouted, seemingly at the top of his lungs. Pretzel jumped, fixed her eyes on Evil!Teddy, and involuntarily turned her expression to one of horror when he turned and revealed what he was holding.<br><br>&quot;Jaffa cakes and... And a jar of mayonnaise?&quot; She quickly regained her composure. &quot;What are those for?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Use your imagination,&quot; Evil!Teddy cooed. Pretzel stared for a second, then grinned as Evil!Teddy started to walk towards her, condiment and snack food in hand.<br><br>&quot;Oh, I see...&quot;</p>

            <p>(It&#39;s not considered bad form to write about oneself in these, is it?)<br><br>PitViper darted through the hallway, throwing nervous glances over her shoulder. There was no sign of her pursuer, at least not yet, so now was a good time to find a hiding place. A door loomed up in front of her; she could hear voices and high-pitched giggling coming through. With a shrug, she turned the knob and opened it.<br><br>The Boarder halted in her tracks, her eyes wide. &quot;...Oh. I&#39;m... I&#39;m terribly sorry, I... I... I seem to have... oh.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hello, Pit,&quot; Cassie greeted cheerfully, acting for all the world like she wasn&#39;t standing around in her lingerie.<br><br>&quot;Hi,&quot; Phobos put in. He was also half-naked, and bound upright and spread-eagled to what appeared to be a large mounted wheel. It was still spinning slowly, finally halting when the Boarder was upside down. There were various other odds and ends in the room, and in... certain places.<br><br>&quot;Buh,&quot; was all PitViper could manage at first. She examined the scene before her more closely. &quot;O... Kay... Is that a tea cozy?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yep,&quot; Phobos replied, his face flushed from being upside-down.<br><br>PitViper&#39;s head tilted to the side.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ll never guess how many spoons it took,&quot; Cassie told her proudly.<br><br>PitViper decided to hazard an educated guess. &quot;Um. Three?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No. Just one.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh. Okay.&quot; PitViper gestured vaguely over her shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m going to, uh... you know. Go. I have to go... iron. My... shoes. New shoes. Goodbye.&quot;<br><br>Turning, she left the room and closed the door behind her. She could hear Cassie&#39;s voice inside saying, &quot;Now, where were we?&quot; right before PoorCynic appeared right the hell out of nowhere and tackled her enthusiastically to the ground.</p>

            <p>((OOC: *hysterical giggling* PVOD, I salute you. XD)<br><br>Some time later, PitViper had managed to escape PoorCynic; it had taken four rounds of enthusiastic activity before he  passed out, leaving her free to tiptoe away and then run like the wind once she was out of earshot.<br><br>As she leaned against a wall to catch her breath, she heard footsteps approaching, and looked around hurriedly for a place to hide. A nearby door presented itself as the ideal solution, and she dived through and locked it at once.<br><br>She froze, however, as an arm encircled her waist from behind. &quot;Hello there,&quot; a familiar, female voice murmured. &quot;We thought you wouldn&#39;t be coming back...&quot;<br><br>&quot;I... uh...&quot; <i>...wasn&#39;t planning to,</i> PitViper thought, but the words died on her lips as she was drawn away from the door and across the room. She noticed the large mounted wheel was now empty and pushed to one side to make way for - &quot;Is that a giant beanbag in the shape of a bed?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yep,&quot; said Phobos proudly, from his prone position on it.<br><br>&quot;How&#39;d you even get it in here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re asking silly questions,&quot; Cassie muttered, tugging PitViper down onto it. Phobos reached over to pull both girls closer, and very soon all thoughts of questions, silly or otherwise, were the last thing on PitViper&#39;s mind.</p>

            <p>When PitViperOfDoom woke up she had trouble remembering how she had come to be lying naked in this unfamiliar bed.  The last thing she recalled clearly was PoorCynic appearing right the hell out of nowhere and tackling her.  Where was he, anyway?  She turned her head and found that he was sitting in a chair nearby, just watching her as he peeled a hard-boiled egg.<br><br>&quot;Ah, good,&quot; he said.  &quot;I was wondering when you would wake up.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um, yeah,&quot; said PitViper, &quot;thanks for making sure I was all right, but I have to be going.

            <p>Cassie was trying to find an empty place. She was feeling alone and wanted to join someone.<br>After opening a few doors, and already disappointed because she was shouted to leave in every place, she decided to give a last shot and was about to pull open the door at the end of the corridor, when L&#39;Homme opened it and looked directly at her.<br>&quot;I heard you coming. Sorry but we&#39;re busy.&quot; He said.<br>&quot;Is there something interesting there? Can I join?&quot; she asked, her eyes big and bright, like Bambi&#39;s.<br>&quot;I&#39;m afraid no. We&#39;re just practising our... er... linguistics skills.&quot;<br>&quot;Vaffan...! You&#39;re standing on me!&quot; Someone shouted inside the room, suspictiously sounding like Sergio.<br>&quot;Sorry, the room&#39;s too small.&quot; Someone else answered, this time sounding like Meta.<br>L&#39;Homme turned to look into the room and said:<br>&quot;Mon Dieu! Can you stop shouting?&quot;<br>Cassie took the opportunity to look into the room too, and saw Meta in a blue dress, tangled up with Sergio, both lying on the floor. In that moment Meta looked up and caught Cassie&#39;s eyes.<br>&quot;What?&quot; He asked. &quot;Their linguistics skills improved a lot. They talked me out.&quot;<br><br><i>(Sorry Sergio for making you curse. Hope you don&#39;t mind too much)</i></p>

            <p>Sonne tiptoed through the Board. Her encounter with the 9th Blue Mage had gone...interestingly, but she still wasn&#39;t eager to have another one. <br><br>Meanwhile, L&#39;Homme Arbre strode along, muttering to himself. He was regretting shooing Cassie away - while he was convincing her to seek entertainment elsewhere, Sergio and Meta had sort of gotten intimate without him, and things became awkward quickly. So now, he was roaming, looking for another likely target.<br><br>Sonne felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned to see who it was, and was suddenly spun around by someone she couldn&#39;t see. She felt herself fall over, but was caught just as suddenly, coming face-to-face with L&#39;Homme Arbre. Just then, she realized that she was in some sort of tango position, practically bending over backwards in his arms. <br><br>Violin music filled the air, spontaneously generated by the inherent drama of the moment rather than any material musician. Before she could protest, or even think, he spun her around again, and they begun to dance a dramatic French tango, L&#39;Homme leading the way. <br><br>They danced almost directly to one of the many doors along the corridor, and with a deft flick of the knob incorporated seamlessly into the dance, it was open. The partners twirled there way in, and with another deft flick, the door was closed. The violin music ended with a flourish. <br><br>There was a soft thump, and a loud moan. &quot;Ma cherie...&quot; Then, there was naught but pregnant silence.<br><br><i> AN: Consider this payback for my own OOC-ness. For your information, I&#39;ve never said &#39;Mon Dieu&#39; in my life. Therefore, my sudden urge to is all your fault.</i></p>

            <p>Miah had finally finished laughing maniacally and was calmly walking through the Board, heading back toward her Secret and Unfindable Cushion Fort. <br><br>“Heeeeeeey Miah!” said a very familiar voice behind her.<br><br>“Hi Data,” Miah said turning to face him. She felt a pair of arms snake around her waist, and Bronwyn’s face appeared on her shoulder. “Miah! So good to see you!”<br><br>“H-hi  Bryn!”<br><br>Miah then felt a tug on her left arm, and saw VixenMage. “Miah! I’ve been looking everywhere for you!”<br><br>“You –you have?” Miah was finding it difficult to concentrate when Bronwyn rubbing circles on her stomach.  <br><br>“Miah! what a coincidence! I was just thinking of you!” Aster said, appearing suddenly, wrapped around Miah’s right arm.<br><br>“Oh! R-really?”<br><br>“C’mon Miah, we have a little surprise for you!” VM said, lightly stroking her left arm.<br><br>“Yeah Miah, we just wanted to thank you for all the great things you been doing.”  Data said, now tickling under her chin.<br><br>VM, Aster, Data, and Bryn led Miah into an unoccupied room. Several wandering boarders would claim to hear sheep, and a strong smell of cinnamon coming from the room.<br></p>

Hello?&quot; he called as he walked a few steps onto the Board.  &quot;Is there anyone here?  I&#39;m Arrow.  I&#39;m new here and I wanted to introduce myself.&quot;<br><br>The sounds of several people giggling from the shadows made him rethink his plan.  He turned to the door only to find that a very naked woman was closing the it.<br><br>&quot;Welcome to the Board,&quot; she said with a smile.  &quot;You picked a great time to join us.  I&#39;m JulyFlame.&quot;  She walked over to Arrow and began working on the buttons of his shirt.<br><br>&quot;Hey, hold on,&quot; he stammered, backing away.  &quot;This is not what I expected.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m just giving you your newbie gift,&quot; July answered, moving closer to the startled newbie.  &quot;I&#39;m sure others will be giving you gifts as well.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You bet!&quot; cried someone from the shadows.  When Arrow turned around to look for the source of the voice Neshomeh, Data Junkie, Sergio Turbo, and PitViperOfDoom walked into the light.  They were all naked except for PitViper who was wearing a black kilt as a shirt, which seemed a little useless due to her lack of any other clothing.<br><br>&quot;Good to have you a-Board,&quot; said Neshomeh as they descended upon the hapless newbie.</p>

A form that would allow anyone who possessed it to spend one night in any continuum they wished, with anyONE that they wished. &quot;So, you can do this for me and get one night, twelve full hours, with your Favorite...&quot; his voice trailed off, leaving Sonne to fill in the rest for herself.<br><br>&quot;Alright, but if I don&#39;t get it I WILL find a new use for those Flames I found.&quot; Sonne slipped off her dress and stepped off the Generic Surface. <br><br>&quot;You made the right choice,&quot; replied Phobos as he dropped his coat.<br><br>END TERRIBLE SHIPPING<br><br>I feel so dirty.</p>

            <p>Deep in the PPC Archives, Agent Neshomeh suddenly jumped as her computer beeped at her. Recovering from the alarm, she read over the report filling the screen.<br><br>&quot;Boarders... shipfic... One True Pairing... paperwork? Oh, that&#39;s not right,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Things are about to get real meta.&quot;<br><br>She got up and, in a shockingly boring &quot;getting ready&quot; montage to the tune of &quot;Here We Go&quot; by Dispatch, she made herself a travel cup of Earl Grey, pulled her hair back, stuck her oversized HFA-issue knitting needles in a holster, adjusted her glasses, and patted her mini-Budong, Chrichton, on the mandible on her way through the portal to the Board.<br><br>Of course, portaling to the exact location she wanted would have been too easy. Naturally, she was forced to look in several different rooms wherein activities of questionable decency were taking place, and to wade through several clots of bodies in the passages between. She did her best not to get any on her. Finally, she discovered the person she was looking for.<br><br>&quot;Mr. Arrow? Yes? Good. Please come with me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll come with you all night long,&quot; the shippy newbie crooned.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s... er... nice. Let&#39;s go.&quot; She led the way, and Arrow followed like an intoxicated puppy.<br><br>Thanks to the Law of Dramatic Timing, they made it to a particular room in time to throw the door open just as Phobos&#39; black trenchcoat hit the floor.<br><br>&quot;Stop right there, please!&quot; Agent Neshomeh shouted, causing Phobos and Sonne to turn their heads.<br><br>&quot;Well hello there,&quot; said Phobos. &quot;Fancy meeting you here. Who&#39;s your friend?&quot; He winked flirtatiously at Arrow.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, um, about that,&quot; Agent Neshomeh said. &quot;Here&#39;s the thing: I&#39;m not Boarder!Neshomeh; I&#39;m not sure what she&#39;s up to, but I am sure I don&#39;t want to know. I&#39;m from the Archives, and down there we get notices of anything that gets put in writing, including this lunacy. Normally it&#39;s kept inside a Creativity Shield, so nothing actually comes of it, but stuff happens. So, this guy here&quot; —she cocked a thumb at Arrow&amp;mdash &quot;was writing you and Sonne as a One True Pairing, which is really not canon, and apparently provided you with some illicit and possibly fabricated paperwork. There&#39;s been a slight bleed into actual PPC continuity, so I&#39;m here to close it. I&#39;ll need those papers.&quot;<br><br>She stepped nonchalantly toward the totally nude Phobos and extended a hand. Behind him, she could see that Sonne and Arrow had totally lost track of what was going on and were happily having it off on the trampoline. She shook her head; she&#39;d meant to speak to Arrow about the whole OTP thing, but there was little chance of that now.<br><br>&quot;So, wait,&quot; Boarder!Phobos said. &quot;Let me make sure I understand what is going on.  You are saying... that there are two of you right now?  Awesome.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, technically, yes—but that&#39;s not the point! I need that paperwork. And then I need to leave before... before...&quot; She trailed off as Phobos stepped toward her.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll give you what you want,&quot; Phobos said seductively. &quot;But successful relationships need give and take.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This is true,&quot; Agent Neshomeh conceded, feeling uncomfortably hot under the collar. &quot;What did you have in mind?&quot;<br><br>Phobos grinned.<br><br>A short walk and about half an hour later, Agent Neshomeh returned to the Archives with the paperwork she had come to retrieve, and what were probably her clothes. They had gotten all mixed up with Boarder!Neshomeh&#39;s, not that it mattered all that much. At least it was all canon. Sort of. In any case, the Earl Grey was put to good use, the continuity bleed was stitched up, the papers went into Chrichton&#39;s maw, and the record was truly set straight, with Arrow&#39;s misguided OTP trumped by one very meta OT3.<br><br>(( FYI, Phobos and I are engaged in real life. We&#39;re cool with shipfics, since it&#39;s pure silliness, but calling OTP just made my brain shout &quot;canon breach.&quot; It&#39;s okay, you didn&#39;t know. ^_~ ))</p>

            <p>Agent Joan was lazily flipping through a maganize when she heard a buzzing sound. She lifted her head in time to see agent Neshomeh walking through a portal.

            <p>Miah finally made it back to her Secret and Unfindable Cushion Fort.  How had that Lustin managed to spread through the nearly the entire Board?  Not that she was complaining about the performance of the Powerful Plover Collaborative.  She’d especially liked Phobos’ kilt.<br><br>She’d been unable to find Bryn again, and though she’d heard of various sightings of her actual target, Caddy-shack, she’d not seen him either.  <br><br>After several minutes of no one passing by the Fort, Miah was beginning to get bored. Then, finally, she spotted him.  Caddy-shack.  He was already naked and covered with sucker marks.  Hmm.  Maybe Bryn had already found him?   <br><br>Caddy was moving slowly down the hall, carefully checking each window before walking past, while still staring at it.  Miah waited until he was in the optimal spot for her to shoot him with her tranquilizer darts.  This spot just happened to be directly in front of a window.  Miah flicked a switch.<br><br>Caddy screamed--in a totally not a girly shriek sort of way--and then yelled, “Slender-Miah-n!! Nooo--”<br><br>His words were cut off by his collapse in an unconscious heap.  Miah chuckled only slightly maniacally as she grabbed Caddy’s feet and dragged him through a secret door into a room.  <br><br>After adding giant sucker marks across Caddy’s chest with a special vacuum cleaner attachment, Miah used a spoon to launch vanilla pudding at him.  Then she stuck tufts of fur to him, and left the RA she’d stolen from her agents next to him.  The last two addresses programmed into it were the Giant Squid fic and somewhere in a Redwall badfic (not That Series).<br><br>By this time, Caddy was starting to wake up.  Miah took the neuralizer that she had also stolen from her agents and with her eyes closed tightly said, “Caddy!” <b>flash</b>  She opened her eyes and saw that Caddy was in the post-neuralized suggestible state.  <br><br>“Wow! You really have a thing for cephalopods, Caddy-shack! I can’t believe you wanted the Giant Squid after all those little ones!  And where’d you pick up the fur?”<br><br>Caddy looked like he was about to deny it when he saw the giant sucker marks.  “Uh-no?”<br><br>Miah was trying, somewhat less than successfully, to stifle fully maniacal laughter.<br><br>“I-I don’t remember?”<br><br>“Well, I’m just going to be going now,” Miah said as she went out the door.  <br><br>The door closed and Caddy heard veritable howls of laughter from the hall.<br><br>“Why do I smell vanilla pudding?” he said to no one in particular.</p>

            <p>A careful hand drew a cloth lightly over the length of gleaming black metal, drawing a faint, quavering hum from the blade. “Missed a spot,” a sleepy voice murmured.<br><br>Adamantine paused for a moment. “Where?” He asked in a hushed tone.<br><br>“Up and to the left,” the sleepy voice replied. “Almost… no, back…wait, no, up….” There was another pleasant chime from the steel. “Right there.”<br><br>At this point, a book came flying out nowhere which Adamantine didn’t manage to duck. He looked back at the girl who threw it.<br><br>“Stop polishing your sword in here, Adamantine, you’re going to attract the shippers.” She took a breath and continued, “And stop muttering to yourself, it’s creepy.”<br><br>Adamantine sighed and rose from his chair, leaning the flat of the blade against his shoulder.  “Fine,” He huffed, “I’ll go somewhere else then.”<br><br>“Yeah, sure,” the now not-so-sleepy voice added, “throw us to the wolves, why don’t you?”<br><br>Adamantine just shook his head and left the room. “You’re not helping, you know,” he told the voice.<br><br>“Well what’s the point of being able to talk if you have to shut up all the time?” the sword demanded. “It’s not like you’re smarter than me. You are me, remember? Or I’m you… or something.?<br><br>“How did an AU Version of me end up as a sword, anyway?”<br>[because July started it]<br><br>There was a sound suspiciously like a sigh. “It’s a long story. I was just… oh, crap.”<br><br>“What? … Oh.”  While he was distracted, Adamantine had turned a corner only to find himself staring at a tangled pile of shippers, and they were staring right back. He waved nervously and sidled back around the corner, then turned on his heel. “Run,” he said, and then proceeded to do so.<br><br>“Run? You’re the one with legs.”<br><br>[Just to be clear, for personal reasons I intend to remain a non-shipper and unshipped. I will, however, run like mad from any shipping antics pointed in my direction, if it amuses you to give chase.]</p>

            <p>Plat sat in the lobby, bearing only his trusty sombrero, and the kilt he found outside of a closet. Although his suspicions were unconfirmed, he did seem to recognize it from somewhere...<br><br>Regardless! He looked around. It seemed quiet... perhaps too quiet... he slowly looked behind when suddenly he felt himself tackled to the ground “the hell...” he managed to say before he saw the faces of 9th Blue Mage, Firebird, Aster, and Silikat <br><br>“You gotta help us! Something went wrong with the lustin!” Aster yelled, as she climbed off of Plat and boarded up the doors. <br><br>“How do you mean ‘went wrong’?” Plat asked, curious and yet slightly disappointed that he’d been tackled for (to him) the wrong reasons<br><br>“Well, you know how Bryn and Miah have been sniping people with tranquilizing darts? Something went wrong and now most of the board is...” 9th Blue Mage swallowed nervously “Sexlexic.” She said, looking most concerned.<br><br>“Sex-whats-it? Huh?” Plat said, trying to straighten himself and not upset his fellow hyperventilating boarders<br><br>“Sexlexia, it’s a terrible disease. Simply debilitating. There... There’s only one cure, I’m afraid...”<br><br>Plat nodded with purpose, and strode out of the room- leaving the black kilt behind. He wouldn’t need it where he was going- for he was the man with no shame.</p>

            <p>&quot;Alright, are you all excited about what we&#39;re doing today?&quot; Bronwyn asked her trio of contracted employees/fodder. <br><br>&quot;But we don&#39;t know what we&#39;re doing today,&quot; Caddy responded.<br><br>&quot;Or why you made us come without clothes,&quot; DigitalSocrates added, adding emphasis that they were all quite naked. It wasn&#39;t that cold in the Sue Labratory, but the large metal trapdoor she had them standing on was very cold, and they were all speckled in goosebumbs. <br><br>&quot;Or weapons,&quot; Data conluded, to the agreement of his peers. It wasn&#39;t exactly an ideal arrangement for warding off the Sues they faced on a regular basis, which was difficult enough in full riot gear. <br><br>&quot;Well, <i>I&#39;m</i> excited!&quot; Bronwyn squeeled, pulling out a black riding crop. It&#39;s black weave matched the color of her corset and garter belt, the only bits of apparel she had opted to bring. &quot;You see, I just got in a whole truckload of My Little Squiddlies from a Homestruck Suefic, so you all can have a break from Sue Experiements while you test them out to make sure they work!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Work at...?&quot; Caddy asked uncertainly.<br><br>&quot;Use your imagination!&quot; Bronwyn laughed evilly, and slammed the crop down on the panel, opening up the trapdoors and dropping the three into a non-Euclidian ocean of primary colored pseudopods. <br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t worry!&quot; she shouted after them. &quot;They <i>probably</i> can&#39;t kill you!&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Attention ladies of the posting board,&quot; said a voice over the speaker in the Lounge.  &quot;You are all invited to the auditorium for a special exhibition.&quot;<br><br>There were some puzzled looks from the female population, but they shuffled to the auditorium anyways, for lack of anything better to do.  All the men had disappeared a while back and the lack of their constant shenanigans was beginning to get boring.<br><br>The ladies entered the auditorium and milled about for a couple of minutes, wondering what this exhibition was supposed to be.<br><br>&quot;Doesn&#39;t this all seem sort of familiar?&quot; asked Neshomeh.<br><br>&quot;It does,&quot; said July, her eyes narrowing as she sensed something was not right.<br><br>&quot;Doesn&#39;t seem familiar to me,&quot; said The 9th Blue Mage.<br><br>The conversation didn&#39;t have time to continue because, at that moment, someone cut the lights.  There were startled cries and muttered curses from the girls present.  These sounds of dismay faded away as the sound of an amp was heard from the direction of the stage.<br><br>&quot;We are the Powerful Plover Collaborative!&quot; yelled someone who seemed to have a microphone.  &quot;We&#39;re here to make you swoon and take off your clothes and stuff!&quot;<br><br>A spotlight came up on Rosie Azrael at a microphone.  The light continued to grow more intense and soon the whole stage was lit.  The ladies in the audience had time to notice that there were others on the stage when the sound of drumsticks clicking filled the space.<br><br>Platinumyo finished counting and began to beat on the drums in front of him.  He was soon joined by Artell, who was playing a purple, axe-shaped guitar.  Phobos, who was wearing a black kilt, was playing bass guitar near Caddy-shack.  Caddy was standing behind a rack holding two keyboards, which he played with one hand on each.  Opposite Caddy on the stage was a DJ set-up which was manned by Data Junkie, who had on sunglasses and a pair of headphones.<br><br>Rosie adjusted his leather jacket and started singing.  &quot;Girl, I&#39;m the one for you; But you&#39;re so far away; I tell you what I&#39;m gonna do; I&#39;ll be with you today.&quot;<br><br>When Rosie got to the chorus he was joined by Sergio Turbo and Tranum who were singing the harmonies.  &quot;I&#39;m gonna portal to your heart; It has to be; Gotta do my part; You are my destiny; This is how it starts; I&#39;m gonna portal to your heart.&quot;<br><br>The bridge began and the ladies in the audience started screaming in glee as Dann appeared on a platform twenty feet above the stage and played an epic solo on an electric cello.<br><br>The next verse started with panties, bras, and the occasional t-shirt flying at the stage.  These were followed by Pretzel and Makari storming the stage and carrying Sergio off for some quality time.<br><br>The song came to a conclusion, minus one back-up singer, with Artell crowd-surfing.  He disappeared somewhere in the middle of the audience and never made it back to the stage.  While Rosie&#39;s final note of &quot;Portal To Your Heart&quot; echoed in the air, the women of the board stormed the stage and showed how much they loved the song and the men of the Powerful Plover Collaborative.</p>

            <p>Phobos was wandering around half naked, looking for his clothes, when he met Miah.<br><br>&quot;Phobos, tell me that you are not under Lustin influence!&quot;<br>&quot;At this very moment not. But, now that I think about it, I probably was for quite a while. You have nothing to do with it, right?&quot;<br>&quot;Er... no.&quot;<br>&quot;Alright, I have to find my clothes.&quot;<br><br>Phobos turned around, only to be glomped by Miah.<br><br>&quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br>&quot;Don&#39;t know, I felt the need to glomp someone.&quot;<br><br>When they separated Miah was very embarrassed, and Phobos was going to tell her that everything was OK when he felt a sting on his back. Suddenly, being glomped wasn&#39;t that bad.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re beautiful when you&#39;re embarrassed, you know?<br><br>He embraced her, and they went in the nearest empty room. After  all, for a while he wasn&#39;t going to need his clothes.<br><br>Few meters away Sergio carefully inspected one of the darts he previously had loaded in his sniper rifle.<br><br>&quot;Are these things really this powerful? Well, it explains why I was singing on that stage. And why not one, but two girls thought that I was sexy. After all, I can&#39;t sing at all.&quot;<br><br>Sergio shook his head and went away. Two targets down, a lot more to go...</p>

            <p>Miah finished changing all her darts out for ones that did <i>not</i> include Lustin when she spied Pretzel and Rosie.  She was about to target them, when she caught what they were saying.<br><br>“You’re wearing what, strapped where, Rosie?”<br><br>Doctorlit suddenly appeared from around the corner, naked.  “Yes. What? Where?”<br><br>Pretzel and Rosie looked at each other and then giggled.  <br><br>Rosie put an arm around Doc’s shoulder and turned him toward a room, “How about we show you.”<br><br>Pretzel’s voice was muffled by her shirt, “Yeah it’ll be--” she threw the shirt on the floor.  “<i>fun</i>!”<br><br>Miah checked her old supply of darts.  Had the Lustin in them escaped somehow?</p>

            <p>Some time later, Miah was wandering the halls when she heard a voice call out to her.<br><br>&quot;Miah, wait up!&quot;<br><br>Miah turned to see Pretzel dressed in a hula skirt, a lei, and nothing else. Pretzel grinned, twirling a bit to show off her new outfit.<br><br>&quot;Hey, could you look something over for me? It&#39;ll only take a few minutes,&quot; Pretzel said, and Miah, as she often betaed for said Boarder, followed Pretzel into a nearby room. Ten minutes later, Miah emerged from the room looking far more disheveled than one ought to after a beta session, and then continued on her way.<br><br>Maybe the Lustin from her darts had gotten into the water somehow? That would explain a <i>lot</i>.</p>

What are you guys <i>doing</i>?”<br><br>Data looked around and realized that he was draped over Khroma, and that neither of them were overly clothed.  “Uh...”<br><br>Khroma looked shocked for a few seconds.

Vixenmage was standing over JulyFlame wearing nothing but a smile and the Permission Giver Hat.<br><br>&quot;Come on, let&#39;s do this already,&quot; begged July, who was already flushed with anticipation.  She reached up to pull VM down to her.<br><br>Vixenmage playfully slapped July&#39;s hand.  &quot;Tsk tsk tsk,&quot; said VM, her smile widening.  She chuckled slightly, &quot;So hasty.  We&#39;ll have some fun.&quot;  She knelt down and ran a hand down July&#39;s cheek.  &quot;But not before I give you Permission.&quot;  </p>

            <p>Surely the whole point of tempting fate is you get to whine about it afterwards?  No need to appologise, no offense taken, and not even a defense.  As for the red dresses, there&#39;s a chance I got confused and miss read it somewhere, there&#39;s a fair bit of lustin going around and clouding judgement after all.</p>

            <p>Well that&#39;s probably where I got confused then.  You can&#39;t have two different colours in one sentance without confusing me.

            <p>So back before I got permission, I claimed a Young Wizards badfic named Spark, which had the Lone Power fall in love with Nita Callahan. But it got taken down and rehauled and actually seems a lot better now. The thing I want to know is, is the Lone Power falling in love with a split of Nita&#39;s consciousness enough to qualify it as badfic or is it just  headtiltingly weird?<br>New version here: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6735200/1/Spark"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6735200/1/Spark">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6735200/1/Spark</a></a></p>

            <p>That was really the only part of the plot that bugged me, and it was just because, well, headtiltingly weird crack pairing. But everybody&#39;s pretty much in-character, and it isn&#39;t even boring, so I&#39;ll just go move it off the claimed badfic list.</p>

            <p>By that I mean: it actually sounds like an interesting plot. Like falling in love with a ghost.<br><br>If you&#39;re only gripe is that you wouldn&#39;t have come up with a story like that, it&#39;s probably not badfic.</p>

            <p>It has been awhile since I&#39;ve been on, so hello to you all again. I have never really told any of you about myself so I thought that I would properly introduce myself. Hello, I&#39;m Kailani and I absolutely love the work that PPC does. I also love reading. I&#39;ve read many books, most of which are fantasy. My favorites are the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Warriors, many books by Tamora Pierce, The Sight (by David Celement-Davies), and many more. I&#39;m a Browncoat, and a Star Wars Fan (I&#39;ve read many of the novels as well as watched the movies multiple times). I also enjoy Star Trek, although I don&#39;t know as much about it as I do Firefly and Star Wars. My favorite manga is Fullmetal Alchemist, although I have just discovered Ikigami, which is really very good. I have also played a lot of pokemon, some Final Fantasy, and of course Tales of Symphonia and Tales of the Abyss. I also really like The Legend of Zelda games. Well, now you know a bit about me and I&#39;ve got to say that it is great to be back!</p>

Having people smooching when they should be worried if they are going to get squished flat by a large sauropod is very much in the ballpark of canon-defilement. <br><br>So counter-intuitive as it is, stuff like JP gets very bad badfic. In that the badficcers WILL write for it, and what badficcers often want to write is SO FAR away from the spirit of the work it&#39;s painful.</p>

            <p>Seems like all JP badfic is disgusting liaisons between humans and dinosaurs.  It&#39;s a setting filled with <i>giant man-eating reptiles</i>.  Can&#39;t badfic authors come up with a more interesting plot than sex?<br><br>♪Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.  The dinosaurs are running wild...♪</p>

            <p>Allow me to say that I liked Orken a lot too. He was written with a great sense of alien distance and businesslike attitude, but what really cemented the character for me was the &quot;space toilet&quot; comment, and the reaction that ensued.<br><br>Now that&#39;s development through banter. Cadmar was able to bring out a new dimension in Orken with the comment. I could feel the offense hit him like a brick to the face. I liked going into the fic with a good idea of both of these characters. Good work, you two. Though it felt a tad long before getting into the meat of the mission, I liked what I saw.<br><br>As for the mission proper, the idea of having to save a replaced dinosaur from ridiculous self-inserts is something I would have never thought of. You pulled it off really well, and even though. You chose some great little snippets to make fun of, and it portrayed the fic&#39;s atmosphere pretty well. Woman Hood was such a silly image. It made a ridiculous, potentially painful scene absurd in such an awesome way.</p>

            <p>Hi everyone,<br><br>I am a relic, used to be active in the PPC - Tolkien-verse specifically - back in my college days some seven-eight years ago, stopped posting regularly some five years ago. <br><br>I am thinking of writing about vampires being written in a rather illogical fashion by most writers as part of my &quot;logic in fantasy and sci-fi&quot; series of posts.<br><br>I am not at all familiar with Twilight, and having attempted the book, I don&#39;t think it is something I would like to read.  However, seeing how popular it has become, I do not want to leave it off the map.<br><br>I would appreciate any assistance with the description of the vampires in the Twilight saga.  Specifically, what makes them different from a human, any comparisons with a human, descriptions of physical appearance, habits, anatomy and physiology.  <br><br>Either pointers to the relevant chapters (and which part of the chapter, if you could) or even better, quotes or descriptions (I trust PPC-ers to know their canon so I will save myself double-checking) posted here.<br><br>Thanks a lot!</p>

            <p>I forgot about that one. I got most of them, though, and I didn&#39;t need Google-- Which I find sad, considering that I read it two years ago and I still can&#39;t erase it from my memory. Usually, my brain just recycles the space. Apparently, this is too bad to recycle. Sigh.</p>

            <p>Despite having sporked two Twifics, I know little about the series. The TVTropes page on it has a wealth of important and trivial information: <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twilight"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twilight">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twilight</a></a><br><br>Don&#39;t click any links though, or you may well get lost on the site.<br><br>All I know is that the freaks sparkle in sunlight (not turning to ash or burning, like vampires are SUPPOSED TO) and that the Cullens are &#39;neighborhood friendly vampires&#39; and drink only animal blood. The series riles me because of these factors, as well as many others.<br><br>Despite most vampires in the series not drinking human blood, they are incredibly strong and fast. In one scene, Edward jumps in front of a van and stops it from crushing Bella. With his hand. That&#39;s by my memory anyway.</p>

            <p>I like that book actually, it&#39;s very intriguing and well-written. I&#39;m a big fan of older vampire novels. Dracula would be the most obvious.<br><br>It irks me when a vampire novel or series tries to make vampires seem &#39;more human&#39; by stripping away a few monstrous features.</p>

            <p>Well, I was forced at gun point to read the books, so would be happy to share what I know of them with you.  Couldn&#39;t quote specific chapter and verse however.<br><br>The main attributes of Twilight Vampires appear to be:<br>The sparkle in direct sunlight.<br>Enhanced speed and strenght.<br>Blood drinking [for the most part]<br>You need to tear them apart to kill them.<br>They have a genetic dislike of Werewolves.<br>They do not sleep.<br><br>That&#39;s most of the main points I think, although I may have missed a few.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t help much with Twilight, since I haven&#39;t read them either, but there are some who have around.<br><br>It&#39;s just cool when people who were around when I first joined turn up. {= ) And, can I ask you something? When Geocities went down, we saved a bunch of stuff, including the SIELU site, which is now <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/SIELU/">here</a>, but some bits appear to be incomplete. I&#39;m thinking particularly of the bit on Bleepadryl, but I think there are some links to missing things in the essay on Elven languages, too. I&#39;m hoping you might still have copies lying around, and that I might be able to fill in those things.<br><br>Anyway, welcome back! It&#39;s very nice to see you. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Cool. I&#39;m just wondering because I make (bad, but still passable) comics. Here&#39;s an abandoned comic as an example: <br><a href="http://enwi.thecomicseries.com/comics/first/"><a href="http://enwi.thecomicseries.com/comics/first/">http://enwi.thecomicseries.com/comics/first/</a></a><br>(I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know how to integrate hyperlinks)<br>Now, if I had a writer who actually knew something about making PPC stories, and I illustrated, I think that would be lots of fun.</p>

            <p>Hello again! It has been two months since I last applied for permission. In that time, I have learned the ways of the beta. I feel my writing has improved quite a bit, and it is time for me to reapply for permission.<br><br><br>I had three people Beta this, so if it&#39;s still not good enough spelling and grammar wise, I may need professional help.<br><br>Writing Sample: (PPC Interlude)<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gCqhCgvQMs0DKnDC4JoVbHIzSt1AIuH9KWDA8-wL5uY/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CIzW0sIP"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gCqhCgvQMs0DKnDC4JoVbHIzSt1AIuH9KWDA8-wL5uY/edit?hl=en&amp;amp;authkey=CIzW0sIP">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gCqhCgvQMs0DKnDC4JoVbHIzSt1AIuH9KWDA8-wL5uY/edit?hl=en&amp;amp;authkey=CIzW0sIP</a></a>#<br><br>The agents who will undertake the mission are:<br><br>Agent Thomas Greenwall<br>Age: 18<br>Sex: Male<br>Home Continuum: World One<br>Department: Mary Sues<br><br>Bio: Most people first describe Agent Greenwall as “enthusiastic.” He is known for his constant pacing, loud talking, and always being excited about everything, even venturing into badfic. (“I get to help the canon, which is AWESOME!”) He has only been on the job for a month, and only recently been assigned to the department of Mary Sues. A pool is currently going as to how long he will think his job is (deep breath) AWESOME! He refers to everyone as “dude.” His side of the response center is an utter mess, a collection of weapons and flags that he has traded for.<br><br>Weapon of Choice: AK-47 (“It’s not subtle, but I’ve always wanted to use one of these!”) Also carries a wicked K-Bar, which he has never used on a mission. Both weapons happen to be native to the Stargate SG-1 continuum, which is also his favorite. <br><br>Agent Orken 7861<br>Age: ~24<br>Sex: Male<br>Home Continuum: Animorphs<br>Department: Mary Sues<br><br>Bio:  Cynical and easily annoyed, Agent Seveneightsixone would be described by most as up-tight. He insists that everyone refers to him as “Agent Orken.” Very few ever do. He believes that they assigned him the partner they did in an attempt by Upstairs to tone down Greenwall’s behavior. Time will tell if it’s successful. <br><br>Orken is a Yeerk nothlit from the post war Animorph’s continuity, recruited while his native fic was on the verge of deletion. Due to his lack of Sue tendencies, while still being an original character, an Agent recruited him. (She claims it had NOTHING to do with an attempt at receiving a vacation.) He has been on the job a while now, and has gone through two partners in that time. His last one went insane after a particularly rough job. He has taken enough Bleeprin to forget the specifics.<br><br>Weapon of Choice: Dracon Beam. (“Sometimes, being able to just disintegrate a Sue can have it’s advantages.”) He picks up as many as possible whenever he is in the Animorphs continuity, and keeps them in a cabinet in his response center. In any other continuity, he will use whatever weapon he deems the most efficient.<br><br><br>The mission will be run in the Stargate SG-1 Badfic known as &quot;Stargate: Discovery&quot; . It’s on the list of unclaimed badfic for a reason.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5820378/1/Stargate_Discovery"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5820378/1/Stargate_Discovery">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5820378/1/Stargate_Discovery</a></a><br></p>

            <p>The writing sample that is. A bit too much sitting around, a bit too much travel that doesn&#39;t add anything to the development of the plot (there&#39;s a reason that most stories neglect spelling out when their characters go to the bathroom). <br><br>You also make too many references to the plutonium incident. If a single event is such a central point of the relationship between all these characters you should come up with more facets to it than just &#39;Greenwall left some plutonium out.&#39;<br><br>Also i got lost about halfway through before realizing I had completely missed the transition to Flashback. When the entire story is written in past tense, steps have to be taken to differentiate between &#39;currently&#39; happening things and flashbacks.<br><br>Just to reiterate: brevity is important. If excitement and enthusiasm are Greenwall&#39;s traits, how are those illustrated in him moping about in his RC while his partner goes off on missions alone? The Law of Narrative comedy could have easily led him directly to getting a fleeting glance of the escaping mini instead of leading him back to his RC to think of searching for it on his own.<br><br>Note that this is all personal opinion rather than technical problems, and the themes are very entertaining (I particularly like the Mini Shenanigans), could all just stand to be a bit better executed.<br>Also note that I am not a permission giver :P</p>

            <p>I am not a permission giver, but I&#39;d say no. In fact, you should probably give a sample that&#39;s NOT PPC.<br><br>The purpose of the sample, I think, is to gauge the quality and flavor of your writing to see that you&#39;re competent enough to practice what you&#39;re going to preach once you have permission. Also with the &#39;flavor&#39; thing-- to see what kind of flavor you&#39;d bring to the PPC with your stuff because once you have permission there&#39;s no taking it back.<br><br>So if you write FOR THE PURPOSE of the PPC, you&#39;re putting on a show for permission givers. Which might defeats the purpose if you try too hard to please them because they want to see what kind of song and dance you do on your own.<br><br>I gave more than one sample: some fanfic and some original fiction. But I&#39;d pick what&#39;s most reflective of your normal writing: containing your ability to string together good pithy plot, and (perhaps even more importantly!) demonstrating your sense of humor!<br><br>So yeah. :)</p>

He follows the rules and is happy to keep himself quiet and in the background, knowing that drawing attention to himself could be what gets him killed.

            <p>Okay. I liked your characters - Meta seems like he would be fun to read, and the interaction of the serious nature of Biggins with his devil-may-care attitude looks interesting.<br><br>But honestly, I don&#39;t feel comfortable giving you permission at the moment; the syntax was off, and the story seemed to lack polish.<br><br>Don&#39;t take this as a once-and-for-all no, you&#39;re quite welcome to try again when you feel you&#39;ve got a better handle on your spelling and grammar.

            <p>Thanks for that.  For some reason when I copied it into Google Docs about 90% of the Marquis&#39; dialogue got duplicated like that.  I&#39;m guessing some random glitch with the italics.  Glad you enjoyed it though.</p>

            <p>First, the announcement: We&#39;re finally getting married! The date is set for Saturday, August 6th.<br><br>Second, we&#39;re planning on honeymooning with a cruise around the British Isles. We&#39;re scheduled to arrive at Heathrow in the afternoon of August 13, and we&#39;re feeling out possibilities for low-priced accommodations until the cruise departs on the 16th. We&#39;ll also need something for the night of the 28th, preferably in easy distance of Heathrow, since our return flight leaves at around nine in the morning on the 29th. So, if you know of anything decent in the area, or if you ARE in the area and feel like being really awesome, please let us know.<br><br>As for the cruise itself, it departs August 16 from Southampton and stops in Guernsey (St. Peter Port), England, Cobh, Ireland, Dublin, Ireland, Liverpool, England, Belfast, N. Ireland, Glasgow (Greenock), Scotland (overnight), Inverness/Loch Ness (Invergordon), Scotland, Edinburgh (South Queensferry), Scotland,  Paris/Normandy (Le Havre), France, and returns to Southampton on the 28th. (All the locations are copied directly from the cruise website, so if any of the parenthetical notes are weird, it&#39;s not our fault.) If you&#39;ll be in any of those places in that time and want to meet up, we might be able to arrange that, too. Just drop us a line. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh and Phobos</p>

            <p>Congratulations, and thrice congratulations!<br><br>Yeah, those parenthetical notes are a tad strange. I live in the north of England, but I&#39;ve been to London a few times. It depends on how near you want to be to Heathrow, as there&#39;s quite a few places to stay in the area. When I stayed to be within easy access of the airport (I needed to catch an early flight to Greece), I stayed at the Renaissance Hotel, which you can find here: <br><br><a href="http://www.marriott.co.uk/hotels/travel/lhrbr-renaissance-london-heathrow-hotel/"><a href="http://www.marriott.co.uk/hotels/travel/lhrbr-renaissance-london-heathrow-hotel/">http://www.marriott.co.uk/hotels/travel/lhrbr-renaissance-london-heathrow-hotel/</a></a><br><br>It&#39;s got pretty good access to everything remotely interesting, as well as Heathrow, and it&#39;s also pretty cheap even though it&#39;s got four stars. I&#39;ve also heard good things about the Sheraton Skyline, but I&#39;ve not stayed there:<br><br><a href="http://www.sheratonskyline.com/"><a href="http://www.sheratonskyline.com/">http://www.sheratonskyline.com/</a></a><br><br>I hope this helps!</p>

You can access Heathrow from the Picadilly line on the London tube system, so chances are you would be able to find a cheapish hotel in the South East of London, say Hammersmith or Ealing somewhere in that area and then just tube straight to the airport.  Hotels in that area are far enough away from the center that they shouldn&#39;t be too horribly priced.</p>

            <p>Hey there,<br><br>I found this site through TVTropes, been reading up on some of the things you do and the things you write, and hanging out on the IRC Channel as DML (Delta Mike Lima). Some of the stuff here is hilarious, I&#39;ve seen and read lots of MST&#39;s but haven&#39;t seen many people do them in a story form with recurring characters before.<br><br>Penname&#39;s DML, I&#39;m an old hat when it comes to fan fiction writing, although somewhat out of practice. Nowadays I focus most of my efforts on original fiction and writing homebrewed tabletop games and game systems. I like both crazy and realistic stories, although as of late I tend to realism more often. <br><br>This sounds like a fun, crazy place, I&#39;ll be interested in sticking around. Catch you on IRC. <br></p>

            <p>Howdy, it&#39;s a pleasure!<br><br>I&#39;m from Ontario, Canada.<br><br>What I know about the military as an entity, modes of operation, from a historical standpoint, or an organizational structure is pretty limited. I spent some time in Air Cadets when I was a kid and I also did a bit of reading. But not much worth talking about, aside from a few small facts and little tidbits of information. <br><br>On the technology that the military uses, with respect to  in terms of how small arms function, and small arms in general, I&#39;m pretty well-versed with that, and at the moment been working on a couple independent projects relating to creating my own rifles.<br><br>As for what fandoms I&#39;m interested in, mainly I stick to what I&#39;m familiar with, which isn&#39;t very much; I could be described as something of a drifter, because while I&#39;ll like certain franchises, such as Starcraft, Star Wars or Warhammer 40,000, I try to make a point of never getting married to any fandom, and so I spend just as much time bashing the stuff I like as enjoying it! I used to be big on Urban/Modern fantasy and &quot;standard&quot; fantasy, at least until a couple years back. </p>

            <p>Just that I recognised the F.N.G term and couldn&#39;t help but squee. I&#39;m sorta lame like that - I get excited far too easily. Also, one of my characters is a military man and proud of it, and he&#39;s one of my favourites. :P<br><br>And cool re: fandoms. I tend to stick to what I know too, most of the time, though I&#39;ve learned more about certain fandoms in... wow, nearly three years of PPCing than I did in the decade or so before that. And yeah, I&#39;m happy to bash the fail-y bits of even my most beloved fandoms; Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Narnia etc.</p>

            <p>I think I may have caused a continuity error. I wanted to bring back, in my missions, a lot of old stuff that had been unused for a while, including the All-Purpose Department, which was even absent from the official Department lists. Problem is, I read over the original stories, and now I&#39;m not sure if my interpretation of the Department is consistent with the original one. For instance, I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s one APD or many, or if the Foxglove heads the whole thing or if he&#39;s just responsible for Fire Emblem<br><br>Sorry.

            <p>I think this has gone on long enough. Let&#39;s all agree that stuff happened involving you that was dumb, and that it&#39;s over now, and that we&#39;re moving on. Therefore, you don&#39;t have to continue with this sort of self-flagellation, and we can all get along without the temptation for further drama. If you have questions, that&#39;s fine. But ask them like a normal person and don&#39;t double-post when you already have a question thread. Capiche? No further comment on this topic should be necessary.<br><br>As for the actual questions, I don&#39;t know when Echo and Kat were written, but if what they did is different from what we&#39;re doing now, that&#39;s fine. It wouldn&#39;t make sense to have multiple APDs, so we&#39;ve standardized it. It&#39;s hardly the only time something like that&#39;s been done, so it&#39;s really not a cause for concern--especially since other people have got on board and written missions in the APD as it is now.<br><br>To paraphrase something Dann said, we decide what the continuity is around here. If we don&#39;t think there&#39;s a problem with the continuity, there isn&#39;t. QED.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>As everyone who reads the OFUs knows, the head of each respective OFU is the original writer of the books in question. This also applies to authors who&#39;ve passed away - Tolkien runs the OFUM (the fact was spelled out in clouds to the protagonist, if I remember correctly). I was unsure how to handle this in the OFUR tribute to Mr Jacques&#39; passing, as obviously he&#39;s still running the place, and I didn&#39;t want to trivialise it in real life or overdramatise it within the story. However, would I be correct in assuming that OFU heads are simply fictionalised versions of the authors in question? After all, even living authors have better things to do than deal with the chaos inherent in running an OFU. Does this make sense?</p>

THANK you.<br><br>I didn&#39;t even see the patterened background until I zoomed out; I rather like it. It could indeed make text hard to read though, if the white backing box were to vanish. It&#39;s not really a problem for me but I wonder - if it&#39;s a problem for others, could you adjust it so that instead of being a whitewashed, watered-down version of images on a black(ish) background, it&#39;s got all those pictures on a paler background (white, preferably)?

            <p>Here&#39;s what I think it&#39;s an interesting question: what is exactly the influence of a crossover on the Multiverse, canonical or not?<br><br>Let&#39;s leave uncanonical ones apart, since it&#39;s DIC&#39;s role to deal with them, and let&#39;s talk about canonical ones. <br>While crssovers that have only an occasiona crossover via dimension travelling or similar stuff goes well with the PPC Multiverse (basically, the characters stumbled upon something very similar to our portals), what happens when the main characters of two or more shows, thought to be completely independent, are later revealed to be in the same dimension, planet or even town?<br><br>That would mean that what were thought to be two different continua are in fact one. I do not know if it already happened during the PPC life, but if does how would it be explained? Retconned into a single continua with a new CIC, or some other explanation, like the two universes somehow merging in a literal way?<br><br>Another question I have is about goodfic crossovers. Again, when the explanation for the &quot;contact&quot; is a dimensional travel or similar we can assume a portal has been somehow generated, but when the main characters of both continua are stated to live in the same universe/world/town what&#39;s the explanation?<br><br>Example: Card Captor Sakura and Magical Girl Lirycal Nanoha are two different continua, from different authors. Nearly any crossover I found (five or six, all good or at least decent, truly a miracle. Or maybe Nanoha&#39;s blasting away all badfic authors, who knows.) states that Sakura and Nanoha both lived on Earth. True, canonically are both from Earth, but it shouldn&#39;t be the same Earth, since they&#39;re from two different continua. It can have an explanation, or we have to hand wave and ignore this problem?</p>

            <p>I joined less than a year ago, so I do not know what was the conclusion back then.<br><br>One interesting canon crossover I saw (and that I will use as example) is &quot;Lupin The Third VS Detective Conan&quot;, and the question I raised is: how are related the two continua now? They were never supposed to be in the same continuum at all (different shows, authors and even TV channel in Japan), but if we take it as canon, how we should think about it?<br><br>1) Lupinverse and Conanverse are one and the same, and the error was in the PPC database. However, since there are no missions (only one DC MST I did) in those two continua and no CIC, this shouldn&#39;t be a problem.<br>2) The two universes merged, and now exist as the Lupinconanverse.<br>3) The two universes came in contact, but then separed (Not very likely, since it was stated that DC and Lupin characters actually knew about each other, but never met).<br>4) The crossover is not part of the main canon, and so it has his own continuum. Best solution, but cannot be confirmed.<br><br>Or maybe I&#39;m nitpicking and we can ignore all those troubles until we stumble in a crossover badfic involving those two continua.</p>

            <p>Yeah, it was pretty good.  But it did raise the question of how do the two universes combine together.  We spent ages trying to make sure that it all fitted correctly.</p>

            <p>I myself have written several crossovers wherein the fandoms themselves share actors or don&#39;t go together at first. An example would be my <a href="http://scarlet-gryphon.livejournal.com/37053.html">NaNoWriMo</a> for 2009 that had Stargate Atlantis, Stargate SG-1, and Sanctuary crossover with one another. All three share common actors- Amanda Tapping, for one (this isn&#39;t too bad with SG-1/Atlantis crossovers, since it&#39;s the same character) -but there I never had the characters both played by Amanda Tapping (Samantha Carter and Helen Magnus) meet in the story. <br><br>As for totally odd crossovers- like, say, Sanctuary and Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentice (2010) -I usually focus on a common element within the two &#39;verses. Oh, so, magic is basically energy/electricity in the SA &#39;verse? Well, cool, then it&#39;s totally plausible that they could crossover, &#39;cause Nikola Tesla in the Sanctuary &#39;Verse has those kinds of abilities. Hey, maybe Tesla could be a sorcerer!<br><br>That kind of thinking led to <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6793599/1/Unexpected_Meetings">this</a> fic of mine, which is rather silly, but if you&#39;re at least vaguely familiar with both fandoms- science=magic, Tesla is a vampire who controls electricity -then it works.</p>

            <p>Okay, that&#39;s not a serious explanation, but it&#39;s close.<br><br>Basically, any time you&#39;re combining two worlds previously believed to be separate, you have to explain why nobody from the one &#39;verse ever noticed anybody/any events from the other one before, or retcon it so that they did, or hand-wave/lampshade it and ignore it so you can get on with the story. The chances of getting away with one method or another vary depending on how compatible the two verses are and how serious your story is.<br><br><i>Lord of the Rings</i> crossovers, for instance, are hard to pull off because it&#39;s a very serious, very well-defined world. However, it is possible if you take advantage of the part where it&#39;s supposed to be a mythos of ancient Earth &quot;before the world changed.&quot; Therefore, any other continuum set on Earth could conceivably be the same Earth, just in a different time. For instance, these are reincarnation fics, not actually crossovers, but author Scribe shows us how to pull off this concept in <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/977316/1/The_Patient">The Patient</a> and its sequel, <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1170256/1/Triumvirate">Triumvirate</a>.<br><br>Sci-fi verses, of course, have all sorts of opportunities to be crossed. Here are a couple of one-shots that I enjoyed a good deal:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4322552/1/My_Brain_Slug">My Brain Slug</a> by Insane Troll Logic (<i>Scrubs</i> x <i>Animorphs</i>)<br><i>So Turk just extracted a brain slug from a patient, JD’s being stalked by a red-tailed hawk and Cox has been acting a little different. Not exactly your average day at Sacred Heart.</i><br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2777247/1/Ride_the_Lightning">Ride the Lightning</a> by SabaceanBabe (<i>Battlestar Galactica</i> 2003 x <i>Farscape</i>)<br><i>For a moment, a split second in time, Kara couldn’t breathe. xxx Crais had pronounced his final words to Scorpius – indeed to every soul aboard the command carrier that had once been his.</i><br><br>I don&#39;t know how well you know any of those continua, but both stories take advantage of the qualities inherent in the &#39;verses involved to pull off believable, well-written crossovers. And that&#39;s how you do it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>
