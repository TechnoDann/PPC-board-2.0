            <p>On the (hopefully) constructive criticism front: On the first page you use the word &#39;rather&#39; four times in a very short time. I think at least half of those could be skipped.<br>My opinion (not claiming this as any kind of objective truth) is that words like &#39;rather&#39;, &#39;slightly&#39;, &#39;kind of&#39; and so on, should be used very sparingly. Often, they don&#39;t add anything to the text other than a sense of fuzziness.<br><br>I read PoorCynics post and especially the part about the copy-pasting and would also like to say, that while I totally agree with what he says about wanting to see agents being funny and snarky and awesome rather than reading the fic, I didn&#39;t think that there was too much copy-paste in this mission, so maybe it is also a question of personal taste. I like large text-excerpts as long as they are relevant and as a reader they help me get involved in the mission and understand what the agents are dealing with. I also use them myself in my missions. So please don&#39;t cut back too much on the text excerpts.<br><br>I like your new agents and how they interact with each other. They make an interesting team with plenty of room for growth and I&#39;m looking forward to seeing more of them. An interlude, perhaps? *makes puppy-eyes*</p>

            <p>These three new agents you&#39;ve created definitely have some good interplay here. I was especially tickled when Xanthus makes the obvious &#39;1-2-3-4-5&#39; joke and the girls just look at him as if he were an idiot. Xanthus in general, actually. He&#39;s got a good voice and an interesting personality.<br><br>I also liked the way you finished the mission. I won&#39;t go into spoiler territory, but seeing a clever reversal always makes me feel good. Kudos for that!<br><br>That being said, this mission needs more work. There are a few awkward lines here and there, including a particularly odd paragraph on page five where vague pronouns turn Xanthus into a &#39;she.&#39; There are a few cases of unassigned pronouns throughout the mission that make it a little difficult to determine who&#39;s talking.<br><br>Another issue is with how underdeveloped Agent Anneli seems when compared with her two partners. Cindy and Xanthus both feel far more concrete as individuals. I know about their backgrounds and characterizations in fairly good detail. All I know about Anneli is that she&#39;s from contemporary Miami, she&#39;s kinda peppy, and she has a vague dudebro-type accent. She doesn&#39;t really do much and doesn&#39;t really add anything.<br><br>The big problem with this big mission is in regard to your use of direct quotes from the badfic. Huge blocks of copy-pasted text do not an interesting read make. Honestly, this felt like I was just reading the badfic rather than an actual mission. I don&#39;t want that. I want to read agents being funny and snarky and awesome. The audience does not need to see every line from the fic being sporked. They don&#39;t even need to see most of the lines. They just need enough to realize where the fic is going wrong.<br><br>Sorry if that seemed a harsh. My intention is not to be a jerk, but to offer constructive criticism. I think you&#39;ve definitely got some potential with this group of agents, but they need some definite polishing for the future.</p>

            <p>I was surprised at how well this worked.  When I was reading the explanation of the format in your author note, I was like, &quot;Huh?  Confused already.&quot;  But in the story itself, the three portions flowed together very well.  This is impressive, considering it&#39;s the kind of scene you would normally see in a visual medium, rather than written.  So kudos on that!</p>

            <p>Well, to quote Glinda, &quot;We&#39;ve been through some troubling times recently&quot;. So I&#39;m tweaking the rules of the Challenge slightly.<br><br>Rules:<br>-Write a reasonably short story in response to the theme (given below). Remember this is for PPC writing - writing about the PPC (organisation, not community)<br>-Post it here<br>-You do NOT have to have Permission, and nothing that&#39;s written here is PPC Canon unless you claim it as such (which does require permission<br>-For this month only, no concrit. Instead, choose another participant who you either don&#39;t know or have had differences with and tell them what&#39;s <i>good</i> about their story.<br><br>Theme:<br><br><u>Reconciliation</u><br><br><i>At times, even agents of the PPC disagree with each other - startling though that may seem. But the work goes on. Write about the aftermath of an argument - write about how those involved patched their relationship up (whatever that relationship might be).</i><br><br>Yes, that can be partners, a Flower and an agent, two Flowers, romantically involved Agents, anything.<br><br>(Since I&#39;m not able to access it right now, can someone let the IRC know this has started? I don&#39;t want people to miss out because they didn&#39;t know)<br><br>hS, already thinking up ideas</p>

            <p>(Since I don&#39;t strictly have any agents to write about, I figured writing the Flowers would be an interesting challenge...)<br><br>Everyone in HQ knew that the Marquis de Sod and the Kudzu didn’t like each other.  That was fine  - it was the <i>PPC</i>.  If everyone got along, it would set warning bells ringing throughout the building (literally; Makes-Things had installed them himself on request from the SO).  The occasional snide remark or petty bickering was barely remarked upon anymore.<br><br>But this... this was new.<br><br>No one was sure how it started; the most believable rumor held that it began as a disagreement over an agent recuperating in FicPsych.  The Marquis de Sod had wanted her back in the field immediately, while the Kudzu insisted she needed more time to recover.  Naturally the argument moved away from the well-being of the agent quickly, and became a gigantic blowout with each Flower accusing the other of infringing on their jurisdiction, undermining their authority, ignoring important demands, and having no respect for their work.  The psychic bellowing could be heard throughout HQ, and stunned anyone within fifty paces.  There were four people in FicPsych now with mental damage from being too close - which only added fuel to the escalating fire.<br><br>Now the two Flowers weren’t talking to each other, which was fairly normal, but when not sulking were directly and intentionally interfering the other’s work, which was not.  The Marquis was refusing to send anyone to FicPsych, no matter how clearly and badly they needed it; the Kudzu was refusing to release anyone from FicPsych, as a direct response.<br><br>Everyone in HQ could feel the effects.  An underlying current of malice pervaded the place.  The other Flowers were making themselves scarce, and personnel found excuses for extended absences.  The infrastructure departments were having an increasingly hard time holding everything together.<br><br>After about a week and a half, with hostilities not having faded in the least, the Sunflower Official resigned himself to having to do something.<br><br>He didn’t want to get involved in the least.  If at all possible, he would have left it to the Marquis and Kudzu to work out between themselves.  But agents going stir-crazy in their wards and flamethrower-crazy in the halls was detrimental to everyone, and besides, their pigheadedness was interfering with his job, as well.<br><br>He managed to wrangle them both into a meeting in an unused boardroom.  The Marquis and Kudzu sat opposite each other at the table, deliberately and pointedly ignoring each other.<br><br>The SO glared at them both.  <i>Listen,</i> he snapped.  <i>This idiocy must stop</i> now. <i> I don’t care what grievances you have against each other - this has gone on long enough.</i><br><br>If the Kudzu had eyes, she would have rolled them. <i>This wouldn’t have happened at all if the daisy over there didn’t need such a drastic attitude adjustment.</i><br><br>The Marquis stiffened indignantly.  Excuse <i>me?  I hardly think -<br><br>Will you </i>stop<i> it?</i>  The SO had lost his patience by now.  <i>You both are acting like seedlings - no, worse, like</i> Agents.<br><br>That gave them both pause.<br><br><i>I don’t care whose fault it is, who has a bad attitude, or anything else you have to say to me,</i> the SO continued.  <i>But you are disrupting my life and my work and I have had </i>enough.<i>  You are not leaving this room until you have worked this out between yourselves.  Whether you reconcile or kill each other, I don’t care.  But this needs to be resolved right now.</i><br><br>With that, the SO turned and left, leaving the Kudzu and the Marquis alone in the room.<br><br>For the longest time, they just sat there, glaring sullenly at each other.  After a time, the silence faded from hostile to uncomfortable, and then  to just awkward.<br><br>It was the Marquis who gave in first.  <i>So... how is Agent... er...</i>  He couldn’t even remember the name of the agent that the whole thing had begun over.<br><br>The Kudzu knew who he meant.  She flicked a tendril irritably.  <i>She says she’s ready to go back to work.</i><br><br>They met each other’s looks, both wanting to say <i>I told you so.</i><br><br><i>Five or six other agents are also ready to be discharged, </i>the Kudzu finally added.<br><br>The Marquis nodded.  <i>And I believe I have a few who need therapy and recuperation.</i><br><br><i>Ah.  The Fountain of Bleepka explosion?</i><br><br><i>The ones involved who aren’t in Medical will certainly need the help, yes.  As well as a few others.</i><br><br>Eventually, after a few hours of violence failing to break out, the SO deemed them ready to leave.  The two disgruntled Flowers left with only one parting potshot (<i>And also, your hat is stupid</i>), leaving the Marquis and Kudzu back on the familiar grounds of tolerable if active dislike.<br><br>The agents who had been taking bets over which one would kill the other went away disappointed.<br><br>But peace was back in HQ - or, rather, the benign craziness that in the PPC passed for peace - and that was all anyone could ask for.<br><br></p>

It wasn’t my fault he trapped me in that maze!” Grace screamed back.<br>“It wasn’t a pleasant experience, you know! I had him standing over me the entire time, gloating about how doomed I was!”<br>“Yeah, well, I had him telling me how I’d never defeat him even if I had everything the PPC could offer! I tried, Ally, I tried!”<br>“Yeah, and you screwed up again,” Ally retorted. “Can’t you get anything right? How incompetent are you?”<br>Grace drew back as though she’d been slapped, the colour draining out of her face. She turned away from her partner and walked through the bedroom door without speaking.<br>Ally sank onto the couch and rested her head in her hands. “Damn.”<br>“Well, wasn’t that a marvellous, scintillating conversation that enriched you both with friendship and mutual trust,” Gaius remarked.<br>“Shut up, Gaius.”<br><br><br>A couple of hours later, Grace was sitting at her computer when Ally emerged from the bedroom. “Um. Hi.”<br>Silence.<br>“Look, I’m really sorry about what I said.”<br>Silence.<br>“And I know it was hard for you to get past him to rescue me.”<br>Silence.<br>“And I was really ungrateful when you did, and I’m sorry for that too.”<br>Silence.<br>“And… forgive me? Please?”<br>There was a pause. Then Grace turned around, her face a mask of anguish. “That really hurt.”<br>“I know, and I’m really sorry,” Ally said honestly.<br>“She is, too,” Gaius put in. <br>After a second, Grace got up and embraced her partner. “I can’t stay mad at you.”<br>After a moment’s hesitation, Ally hugged her back. “Thanks.”<br>Grace pulled away abruptly. “Just don’t do it again.”<br>“I won’t,” Ally reassured her.<br>Grace hugged her even more tightly.<br>And once again, peace reigned in the RC without a number.<br></p>

            <p>It&#39;s always nice to see some of these underutilized PPC divisions focused upon or otherwise made reference to. Not only does it allow for new and unconventional stories, it serves to further build the PPC universe.<br><br>Much of what I wanted to address concrit-wise has already been addressed by Phobos and Vixenmage. There are a couple of unaddressed points that I feel should be touched upon, though. There are points in the dialogue where it isn&#39;t really made clear who is talking at any one point. I had to reread several sections just because I did not know who was saying what.<br><br>There is also the matter of the story&#39;s frequent use of one sentence paragraphs. I would not mind it so much were the sentences in question important ideas that really needed to be emphasized in their own stand alone section, but this does not seem to be the case. &#39;Gerry huffed.&#39; probably does not need to be in its own paragraph.<br><br>Finally, I really liked the way you explained what an Enderman was in the text. It was succinct and contained all the information someone who does not play Minecraft needs to know about this creature. Well done in that regard.<br><br>I apologize if any part of my criticism seemed overly harsh or accusatory. This is a nice little story with interesting characters and I look forward to seeing them again. Kudos!</p>

            <p>First off, I enjoyed the story very much.  Building Maintenance is a very important part of the PPC that no one ever sees, so it is good that they are getting some love.  I especially enjoyed the end bit with Denny getting in one last joke at their expense.<br><br>Sometimes people who are fighting need an outside person to tell them that they are both being unreasonable.  Denny served that purpose very well.  He seems like the kind of person I would want in charge of such a dangerous working environment.<br><br>So, on to the concrit.  I agree with VM on the issues that she raised.  <br><br>I would have liked to see some description of the area they were in, since I think it would be fairly unique in the PPC.  Along those same lines, we got descriptions of the two that were fighting, but I have no real reference for what anyone else looks like.<br><br>There are conflicting reports on why Gerry was transfered.  In &quot;Cubes&quot;, it was due to a Glitter allergy.  On the Wiki, it says it was because of side-effects from the Aura of Smooth.  One or the other should be changed to make them line up.<br><br>Again, quite enjoyable.  I&#39;d be interested to see more from these guys.</p>

            <p>Regarding the descriptions, that is.

            <p>Amusing! I snerked muchly - ah, the problems inherent with an Enderman wandering HQ. Building Maintenance may be cursing his name for a long time.<br><br>Since you did ask, a bit of concrit. You have <i>Colt was a half elf, from Faerun, and decidedly shorter than Gerry, and a contrast to her, with sandy blond hair and green eyes.</i> That&#39;s sort of a bit awkward, with the conjunctions. Also, <i>&quot;WILL YOU TWO KNOCK IT OFF?&quot; Denny inhaled.</i> Although I get that he&#39;s shouting and then inhaling, it could also be read with him inhaling as a shout, there.<br><br>Other&#39;n that, looks good!

            <p>I liked it. Using a previous story was a really good idea. <br><br>“Ibis here,” and a different, feminine voice came in over the speaker. “Endermen are from Minecraft. Tall black guys, they wander around stealing stuff, and you look at them they’ll attack you the moment you look away.”<br><br>Denny groaned. “Tell me you’re making that up. That just sounds racist.” <br>As for concrit, I can&#39;t really find anything, really. It was a short and funny thing to read quickly. </p>

            <p>There was an uncomfortable silence in the Response Center, broken only by the quiet hum of the console. <br><br>Slumped in the room&#39;s battered red leather armchair, Dobbs was scowling at the Generic Surface floor as though it had told him that it thought Mary Sues weren&#39;t that bad. His dark mustache twitched in rhythm with his breathing.<br><br>Across the room, Miles stood in the doorway, fists balled at his sides as he stared at the older Agent. He was standing completely still, except for the odd twitch every minute or so.<br><br>The console kept humming to itself as the silence stretched on, relatively content in its electronic existence.<br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t believe it.&quot; Miles said eventually, more to break the silence than anything else. His tone was oddly flat. &quot;What were you thinking?&quot;<br><br>Dobbs grunted, still not looking up. He quickly flipped through the pages of the book in his hands, looking elsewhere as he did so.<br><br>&quot;Well?&quot; Miles demanded, voice rising. &quot;What&#39;d you go and do that for?&quot;<br><br>Dobbs muttered something vague that might have been a reply.<br><br>&quot;Mei tou nao de sha gua!&quot; Miles swore in accented Mandarin, kicking the closest thing in reach. This happened to be Dobb&#39;s golf bag. There was a muffled clunk, and the younger Agent started to hop around, holding his injured foot. &quot;Gah!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, kid!&quot; Dobbs called, a note of concern in his voice as he suddenly leaned forwards. &quot;Don&#39;t hurt yourself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not a kid,&quot; Miles insisted through gritted teeth, still holding onto his foot as he wobbled in place. &quot;And you weren&#39;t so worried about the Hyacinth!&quot; The end of the Department Head&#39;s name came out as more of a hiss than anything else.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a Flower.&quot; Dobbs snapped.<br><br>&quot;She&#39;s our boss, and you attacked her!&quot; Miles retorted, dropping his foot and gesturing wildly with both hands.<br><br>&quot;I had to be sure!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of what?&quot;<br><br>Dobbs abruptly looked back down.<br><br>&quot;We get called Upstairs, and what do you do, Agent?&quot; Miles ranted. &quot;Oh, only pull a gun on our boss, right after pointing a CAD at it!&quot; The younger Agent was tugging at his own hair by this point, now only a few feet away from the chair. &quot;Are you competely fung le or just stupid?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Neither, so drop it.&quot; Dobbs replied, glaring at his partner. The book dropped to the floor, forgotten.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m surprised we&#39;re not both doped up and in Medical!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Drop. It.&quot; Dobbs snarled, suddenly on the edge of his seat<br><br>Miles automatically took a step back, surprised by the sheer vehemence in his partner&#39;s tone.<br><br>&quot;Fine.&quot; he muttered.<br><br>There was a long period of silence. Dobbs slumped back, and Miles seemed to become very interested in the blank console screen.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br>&quot;Sorry.&quot;<br><br>Both Agents looked at each other in surprise. Dobbs was the first to speak.<br><br>&quot;Hmph. Guess I could&#39;ve done it better.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Better,&quot; Miles echoed disbelievingly, then shook his head. &quot;Right.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Kid...Miles. I had a reason. I really did.&quot; Dobbs said earnestly. &quot;I had to check it was really the Flower.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Right.&quot; Miles repeated, staring at his partner before dropping onto the console&#39;s swivel chair. Behind him, the screen flickered to life.<br><br>&quot;Just trust me on that. Alright?&quot;<br><br>Miles scowled. He opened his mouth to speak, about to say something that&#39;d send the room straight back into an awkward silence.<br><br>[BEEEP!]<br><br>Of course, if anything could break up an argument between Agents, it would be a object of mutual loathing. A Suefic would do nicely.<br><br>&quot;What&#39;ve we got?&quot; Dobbs called, springing out of his chair, argument completely forgotten. There was a muffled clank as he picked up his golf bag from the doorway.<br><br>At the console, Miles was typing frantically, fingers scrambling over the keyboard. A faint grin was spreading across his face, and there was a tell-tale look in his eyes.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ve got a mission. Let me bring it up...&quot;<br><br>Milo scanned the report, then froze, his grin fading away. There was a moment of stunned silence at the keyboard. <br><br>&quot;They did what?&quot; Milo cried. &quot;Zao gao. Really, really, Zao go. Agent Dobbs, you&#39;ll want to look at this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Move over.&quot; Dobbs told him, toting his golf bag as he stepped up to the console. His eyes darted from line to line, widening as he read. There was a clunk as he dropped the golf bag next to his feet, but he didn&#39;t seem to notice.<br><br>&quot;This thing has to go.&quot; he finally growled. Milo didn&#39;t reply, simply nodding in agreement.<br><br>As the two Agents prepared, they talked, but only about their plan for the fic, what equipment they could take, and what to do to the luckless Sue who&#39;d caused this mess. The argument was forgotten, and things were back to normal in the RC, at least for the moment.<br><br>Translations<br>Mei tou nao de sha gua- Mindless idiot<br>fung le- insane, mad<br>Zao gao- terrible, disastrous</p>

            <p>First off, my apologies for not responding sooner.  I read this a couple of days ago and forgot to write a review.<br><br>I like the contrast between Miles&#39;s boiling anger and Dobbs&#39;s calm.  I can see how that could serve to increase the vehemence of an argument, especially from the angry party.<br><br>I also thought the silence before the apologies was a good idea.  Sometimes you need to stop the mouth before the brain can start working.<br><br>I do think that the apologies were a good start, but I don&#39;t think anything was really resolved before the console Beeped.

            <pre><code>“Look, that&#39;s not the way it works!” Diocletian shouted. Over on his hibachi, Thiranduil whimpered and covered his ears. They&#39;d been going on like this for almost half an hour, and even a mini-Balrog has his limits. Diocletian, however, ignored the mini&#39;s obvious distress in favor of jabbing a finger into her partner&#39;s chest.“If you&#39;d listen for five seconds, you&#39;d know that!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “It&#39;s a damn stupid way to do things,” Suicide retorted. “Telling all your problems to some useless old graybeard who makes his living telling other people why they&#39;re mad? That&#39;s not healthy, that&#39;s the kind of thing Athenians got off on!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    “It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; healthy, believe it or not. And if you hate psychology so much, why do you ask me for advice all the time?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   “That&#39;s different. I actually respect you occasionally!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    “Occasionally! Truer words never spoken. I still can&#39;t believe you&#39;re being so stubborn!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   “Maybe you&#39;re the one who&#39;s being stubborn. Why the hell should I talk to one of these headshrinkers, anyway? They can&#39;t even really shrink heads!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Because that&#39;s why! You have this . . . “ Diocletian gripped the air as if trying to throttle her partner&#39;s less admirable traits. “This . . . &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt; about how violence is the only way to get stuff done! Like riding a horse is somehow better than reading a book!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  “I&#39;m in the PPC!” Suicide pointed out, throwing his arms wide. “Why the hell d&#39;you think they recruited me?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    “That doesn&#39;t change the fact that you&#39;re treating the DSM-IV like a to-do list. There are limits!” Thiranduil burrowed deeper into the hibachi, knowing that, like plagues and &#39;80s fashion, the original topic of the fight was about to return yet again. “Limits that &lt;i&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/i&gt; involve you trying to murder Agent Snafu just because I went to dinner with him!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    “I told you, he&#39;s no good for you. He&#39;s practically a stick. A stick who wouldn&#39;t know how to be a man if you injected liquid John McClane into his veins!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Diocletian facepalmed. “You&#39;d probably try it, too. But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that you nearly frightened him to death, and for no good reason!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Suicide huffed. “I said I was sorry!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   “You didn&#39;t mean it, and you know it.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  “What the hell does that mean?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Exactly what it means.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    “Stop being such a girl, Dio, and just spit it out!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Diocletian scowled, planting her hands on her hips as she aimed a venomous glare at her partner. “Stop being such a girl? Oh, smooth, very smooth! I feel so bad for Jenni Robinson, having you following her around like a horny charmless wolfman.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   “All right, you caught me. I&#39;m not sorry.” Suicide flexed his hands, with audible cracking noises from the oversized knuckles. “I&#39;m not sorry that I did the sensible thing by trying to scare off a useless squish of a human being who shouldn&#39;t even be looking in your direction. I&#39;m not sorry that your idea of a good time is trying to knacker me by hitting me over the head with how modern people handle their differences! How modern people behave, how &#39;civilized&#39; people spend their time—-if I hear the words &#39;peaceable conflict resolution&#39; again, I&#39;m going to go out there and kick a puppy just for the hell of it! Dammit, Dio, I&#39;m a Scythian, not a sociologist!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Diocletian&#39;s scowl wavered. She fought valiantly to keep it in place, but the urge was too strong. With a snort, she burst out laughing, covering her mouth with both hands but unable to suppress the mad giggles. Suicide stared, not quite sure what had come over his partner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  “A Scythian . . . not a . . .” She broke down again, choking. “Oh Eru, oh my Eru, you are, aren&#39;t you . . . ahahaha . . .”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Suicide glanced at the door as Diocletian gasped for air. “I take it back. Maybe you do need one of those headshrinker things.” That sent Dio into another fit of laughter, and Suicide grinned uneasily, not sure what he&#39;d said. As a rule, his partner was supposed to be the levelheaded one; barring the occasional spot of Bursar Disease, Diocletian was the one who acted calm(ish) and sane (in a manner of speaking). Maybe the pressure had finally gotten to her? Tentatively, he prodded one shaking shoulder with a fingertip, only making her laugh again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   “No,” she managed. “You&#39;re not. You&#39;re really, really not.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Are you trying to start the argument again? Because I can do this all day.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    “No, I&#39;m not,” she said, taking a deep breath and trying (and failing) to wipe the smile off her face. “Look . . . Su . . . you&#39;re right.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  He raised an eyebrow, surprised. This was a first. “I am?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  “You are. Sort of. Maybe I&#39;ve been too hard on you.” Suicide&#39;s other eyebrow joined the first, giving him an expression of either extreme surprise or recent Botox use, and Diocletian held up a qualifying finger. “&lt;i&gt;Maybe,&lt;/i&gt; I said. I&#39;m still mad at you. But I have been badgering you a lot lately.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   “Honey-badgering, practically.” Diocletian&#39;s giggles started again, and Suicide could help grinning too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   “You suck, Su.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “I&#39;m rubber, you&#39;re glue. You actually mean it?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    “Yeah, yeah. I think I do.” She took another breath. “Look, Su. You wouldn&#39;t be half as much fun if you were . . . well . . . modern. Normal. But there&#39;s a time and a place, you know? Breaking into Snafu&#39;s RC and attacking him while he&#39;s asleep isn&#39;t one of them.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    “I was trying to see how well he reacted to a dangerous situation. A man needs to be able to protect himself and his loved ones.” It&#39;s a testament to Suicide&#39;s acting ability that he said that perfectly straight-faced. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Protecting himself and his loved ones, says the man who&#39;s named . . . look. I don&#39;t need protecting, okay?” Diocletian shook her head, even as Suicide opened his mouth to object. “Okay, there was the Shelob incident. But most of the time, when I want to have dinner with another agent, I don&#39;t need you biting his head off. Okay?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Okay,” Suicide said. Reluctantly. Biting peoples&#39; heads off was practically a spectator sport in the PPC, after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   “And I&#39;m sorry I called you a charmless horny wolfman.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Horny charmless wolfman, actually. And that one was actually accurate.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    “You&#39;re a wolfman?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Ask Jenni.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    “Oh, Su—-&lt;i&gt;ew!&lt;/i&gt;”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  And once again, in RC #2771a, all was well. Because attempted murder is one thing, and badgering about what defines civilized tendencies is another, but a bond of humor shared by inadvertent science fiction references is in a class of its own.

            <p>Oh, very nice! I love the idea of Suicide breaking into someone&#39;s RC to attack them in their sleep... to protect Diocletian. It&#39;s so very him! And the resolution, very cool - the only good way to end a fight is by breaking down into paroxysms of laughter. (And apologies, of course, but laughter is more fun.)<br><br>Well said/done, WM!</p>

            <p>Four years, eight months and sixteen days later, Terri Ryan awoke with a start. &quot;But that didn&#39;t happen!&quot; she exclaimed.<br><br>&quot;It sort of did,&quot; a voice replied, and she looked around the dimly-lit room, startled. There was a woman standing by the door – a woman with strawberry-blonde hair.<br><br>&quot;... I thought you didn&#39;t exist,&quot; she said accusingly. The other woman shrugged.<br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t. Then I did. Hello, Terri.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Louise,&quot; Terri said with a slight nod. &quot;So. Come to gloat?&quot;<br><br>Lou shook her head. &quot;I came to give you a present,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s... well, you know.&quot;<br><br>Terri frowned. &quot;But that didn&#39;t happen,&quot; she said firmly. &quot;I remember what happened the morning...&quot; She stopped and took a deep breath. &quot;The morning Narto vanished,&quot; she managed. &quot;It... was terrifying. And it didn&#39;t involve-&quot; She stopped. Lou went on, in a quiet tone.<br><br>&quot;It didn&#39;t involve me coming by and explaining everything,&quot; she said. &quot;It certainly didn&#39;t involve you offering to &#39;share&#39;. But now, it did.&quot; She shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s hard to explain without breaking the fourth wall.&quot;<br><br>Terri looked around. &quot;But my bedroom only has three walls,&quot; she pointed out. Lou smiled slightly.<br><br>&quot;Exactly. But... okay, basically I have an... an understanding with-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Louise,&quot; Terri cut her off, &quot;I work for the PPC. I understand superpowers – you don&#39;t need to explain. Why are you here?&quot;<br><br>Lou took a deep breath of her own. &quot;To apologise,&quot; she said. Terri stared at her.<br><br>&quot;This is your idea of an apology?&quot; she finally said. &quot;You can&#39;t just show up in my room and-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know, I know.&quot; Lou frowned and rubbed the bridge of her nose. &quot;I&#39;m not very good at this. Do you mind if I sit down?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sure,&quot; Terri said, sitting up in bed and holding the sheets close around her. &quot;Pull up a stack of papers.&quot; Lou did so, and looked at Terri thoughtfully.<br><br>&quot;Okay,&quot; she said, &quot;here goes. I&#39;m... <i>sorry</i> I took your boyfriend. I know it upset you, and I do wish it hadn&#39;t.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I still miss him, you know,&quot; Terri said quietly. &quot;Even after all these years.&quot;<br><br>Lou winced. &quot;I think he misses you, sometimes, too,&quot; she said. &quot;That&#39;s... kind of why I&#39;m here. I don&#39;t want to feel like a thief.&quot; She touched one hand to her stomach. &quot;Especially not now.&quot;<br><br>Terri raised an eyebrow. &quot;So you&#39;re apologising to make yourself feel better?&quot; she asked. &quot;Because that&#39;s really not helping your case.&quot;<br><br>Lou grimaced. &quot;Someday I&#39;ll be good at this,&quot; she muttered, casting a glance at the ceiling. &quot;Look, I... I <i>am</i> sorry. I know how much he meant to you-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I loved him,&quot; Terri said bluntly. &quot;Sometimes I think I still do.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know,&quot; Lou whispered. &quot;And... I love him too. That&#39;s why I did it.&quot;<br><br>Terri shook her head slowly. &quot;I... okay, archives mode.&quot; She tugged her sheets up with one hand and reached for her glasses with the other. Putting them on, she straightened up slightly. &quot;Okay. In an alternate universe, you were Narto&#39;s partner, apparently in order to train him up. When that was accomplished, you merged him with the Narto of my world, giving him two sets of memories and far more skills than he previously had. Is that broadly accurate?&quot; Lou nodded slightly. &quot;Approximately six months later, my Narto – my boyfriend Narto – disappeared overnight, leaving behind a note saying he was leaving with you – who we had all assumed was fictional.&quot; Lou nodded again, one hand over her eyes. Terri sighed and lowered her head. &quot;In the final analysis,&quot; she said a moment later, &quot;I think I&#39;ve recovered from... what happened. I haven&#39;t gotten another boyfriend-&quot;<br><br>Lou cringed. &quot;I&#39;m-&quot;<br><br>&quot;-but I have had several girlfriends,&quot; Terri went on without pause. &quot;So... was that your doing?&quot;<br><br>Lou looked startled. &quot;No,&quot; she said emphatically. &quot;Definitely not. I couldn&#39;t... well, I probably could, actually, but I <i>wouldn&#39;t</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good.&quot; Terri thought for a moment, and then said, &quot;Well, you knew him longer anyway. One question, then: while you were partners, did you sleep with him?&quot;<br><br>Lou spluttered. &quot;You said what now?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a simple question,&quot; Terri said calmly. &quot;While working together in the PPC, did you and he-&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; Lou said firmly, &quot;no we didn&#39;t.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not even in deleted scenes?&quot; Terri asked pointedly. Lou shook her head emphatically. &quot;Good. Then I still got that first. Okay... then for what it&#39;s worth, I forgive you.&quot;<br><br>Lou nodded her head slowly. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&#39;t... I really <i>am</i> sorry, you know.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know,&quot; Terri said quietly. &quot;I would be too. So... Louise?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The offer to share is still open, you know.&quot;<br><br>Lou laughed startledly. &quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;d be a good idea,&quot; she said. &quot;For my good as well as yours – and his.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s what I thought,&quot; Terri said. &quot;Okay. Say hi from me?&quot;<br><br>Lou nodded. &quot;I will.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And tell him I was thinking of him while I was naked in my bedroom with his wife.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, we&#39;re not-&quot; Lou stopped. &quot;You&#39;re naked?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m in bed, Louise,&quot; Terri replied flatly. &quot;Of course I am.&quot;<br><br>Lou rolled her eyes and looked up. &quot;You&#39;re just malicious,&quot; she said accusingly. Terri blinked. &quot;Not you,&quot; Lou added. &quot;Okay... I&#39;m going to go now before I embarrass myself any further.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sure,&quot; Terri said. &quot;And... Louise?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>The Archives Mode infodump is because I just realised none of this is actually explained yet...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I have to admit I think the prequel outdoes the actual challenge &#39;fic on every level - but mostly that&#39;s because an Enderman in the PPC is just <i>perfect</i>. I love the concept, I&#39;m just mad I didn&#39;t think of it first. :P<br><br>In the main &#39;fic, you get the feeling of a misunderstanding down very well - <i>we</i> misunderstand right along with the agents, so we have to do the same as them - check back and see why we got it wrong. I like that.

            <p>Okay, first things first. Writing prompts are always great to muck around with, and simultaneously reaffirming the bonds of the community after that recent rough patch is a very worthy goal. We need a good bit of healing. That being said: <br><br><i>For this month only, no concrit. Instead, choose another participant who you either don&#39;t know or have had differences with and tell them what&#39;s good about their story.</i><br><br>Part of the reason why I joined the PPC was because I felt confident that the community would not hold back when it came to constructive criticism. My reasoning was these were people who were passionate about encouraging <u>good writing</u>. These would be folks that would call me out when I wrote an overpowered character or strayed into the realm of cliche. In return, I would do my best to help them improve their writing in turn.<br><br>Saying only what you like about someone&#39;s story might be a nice ego booster, but it&#39;s not very useful in terms of improving one&#39;s writing. Personally, I try to do a mix of both in my peer reviews: starting out with the stuff I thought was great before moving on to the elements that need improvement.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong. The prompt is great and the PPC community could use a bit of healing. But I don&#39;t like the idea of ignoring any negatives or downsides we might happen to run across just to make other people feel better. That&#39;s not why I joined.</p>

            <p>... that&#39;s a specific rule for this specific thread, this one time only. I very much approve of concrit in general - but I&#39;m trying to use this particular Challenge to heal some rifts, and I worry that criticism - however constructive - might detract from that. (Also, last month only about two people bothered to do the concrit part anyway, so...)<br><br>I do understand your point, however, so I&#39;ll rephrase: If you want to post constructive criticism, please be very clear about what you&#39;re criticising - and post some positives as well. As I learnt it, the general rule of concrit is to flank each negative with positives on either side.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Given that Kensi is definitely one of my favorite characters in this fandom, I can see why there was so much rage against the twisting of her personality. Good job with this, though at times it felt a little rushed. I was confused a bit at the reference to the character from the fandom with the genetic meddling, though, as I&#39;m not sure I caught which fandom it was.</p>

            <p>The balance of fic to mission was much better this time. I definitely found myself sympathizing with the agents and disliking the Sue, and I don&#39;t even follow this show. (The original <i>NCIS</i>, yes, but the LA one didn&#39;t manage to hook me the same way.) Given that one of my agents has her condition (though I&#39;ve never referred to it by name), she really made me twitch on his behalf. There are <i>downsides</i> to remembering every little thing, dangnabbit. It&#39;s not just a free pass to awesomeness. Nume only gets to be semi-normal because of chemically impossible brain bleach on which he&#39;s become psychologically dependent. {= P<br><br>I might have handled Kensi differently. The way you describe it, I suspect she might have some OOC resistance. A regular character in the Sue&#39;s position might not actually be able to usurp her position, but a <i>Sue</i> definitely can and will, so I&#39;d say her suspicion was quite perceptive and entirely justified if she did indeed have an inkling of what was really going on. If that&#39;s the case, she could be a useful ally sometimes, like Gimli and Eowyn. Not knowing the character, though, I can&#39;t make the case any better than that. On the other hand, I was hoping you&#39;d use the <i>Conflictus creatrix</i> after you mentioned it. What mission did that come from, or is it your own idea?<br><br>Sort of related to this, do mind the level of animosity. It&#39;s good that it was commented on and disapproved of, but to paraphrase Acacia, be careful not to let these things turn your agent or yourself into a common flamer. If it gets too personal, it&#39;s a good idea to step back and calm down before continuing, because frankly it&#39;s hard to be funny when you&#39;re that angry. If you ever find it&#39;s not about the writing anymore, pass the fic to someone else to spork.<br><br>Gaius is awesome. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with the <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> reboot, but with the British accent, I can&#39;t help but hear him in the voice of Gaius Baltar. And, if you&#39;ve seen the special features, there&#39;s one where the actor is talking about his character and sitting at a keyboard, and he breaks into a song. It starts out sweet: &quot;Gaius Baltar...&quot; and then it breaks into something like thrasher metal: &quot;HE&#39;S THE MOTHAF***IN&#39; S**T, HE&#39;S THE MOTHAF***IN&#39; S**T!&quot; So, yes. Gaius Smart Board. He&#39;s the mothaf***in&#39; s**t. *grin*<br><br>I spotted a couple of continuity mistakes:<br><br>1. &quot;Grace returned half an hour later, accompanied by two minis. &#39;Hey, guys. I found a mini.&#39;&quot; —Just one mini, right?<br><br>2. They talk about what to do with Gaius twice. The first time, Gaius requests to be taken with the agents when they leave and suggests that he could be an adviser. The second time is at the end: Gaius asks what he might be able to do in the PPC, and Grace suggests that he could be an adviser, like it hadn&#39;t come up before.<br><br>So, keep working at it, use a beta if you can, and I&#39;ll look forward to the next one. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The reason I didn&#39;t use the Conflictus Creatrix was that even though I wanted to, the CC makes characters turn against each other. The agents were all unprofessional, but they weren&#39;t actually trying to kill each other. Suefluence looked more like the cause than the CC did.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the advice. You&#39;re right, Kensi might well have had OOC resistance, and if I do another NCIS LA mission, I might write her as such. You&#39;re right about the level of animosity, too- I&#39;ll try not to write future missions while tired and angry. I&#39;m not familiar with Battlestar Galactica, I&#39;m just a lover of Ancient Rome.<br><br>As for the errors:<br><br>1. When I first skimmed through the fic, I thought I saw another misspelling, but when I went back to look, I couldn&#39;t find it. I must have forgotten to change that line.<br><br>2. You&#39;re right, I should have rephrased that bit. <br><br>Thanks for commenting!</p>

The mission dragged a bit in the middle because, like you said, it was keeping to canon (and no I don&#39;t have any suggestions for preventing this because I couldn&#39;t have solved the problem myself); but by the end it was obvious just how much of a badfic this is.</p>

            <p>When was the LP posted? The fanfic was started in... July of last year, I think.

But... he can&#39;t get the name of said brother straight. In the A/N in the fic, he says his brother&#39;s name is Louie.

            <p>This was a long mission, and it took me a while to get into it.  Until I got towards the end, and sheer madness took over the universe.  For what it&#39;s worth, I do think this author is a troll; the majority of the fic may just be a failure to understand the game&#39;s plot; but that ending chapter with the reveal is just utter, utter insanity.  There&#39;s no way that was the result of thinking out the clues; I think the whole fic was setup for the nonsensical, pointless ending (hence why it omitted so much dialogue and condensed scenes down to a few sentences).  Also, egsomelete.  Egsomelete is the most beautiful misspelling I&#39;ve ever come across, and we should totally start serving it in the Cafeteria now.<br><br>Anyway, that was all a long-winded way of saying that I can understand why this mission was so hard to get through, and I&#39;m impressed that you kept at it long enough to get it posted.<br><br>If I may be so bold to point out a few typos:<br><b>He took in a deep breath. Oh, and the Origami Killer never kills babies...</b><br>You&#39;re missing the opening quotation before &quot;Oh.&quot;<br><b>“A Gary Stu?” asked Xanthus. “But that doesn’t make any sense. He hasn’t really done that much to be breaking the canon so hard, so… This doesn’t make any sense.”<br>“I guess we’ll find out later,” replied Xanthus, shaking his head. “For now… I think this charge list might finally have a definite victim.”</b><br>You&#39;ve got poor Xanthus replying to himself!  Surely, his new partners are better company than that!<br><b>As Norman was not wearing ARI, he was not affected by the flash of light.</b><br>I don&#39;t know what ARI is, but since he does get successfully neuralyzed, I think you meant to say he was affected by the flash.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve always thought of geek culture as more accepting than most of the rest of society - that among fellow geeks and nerds, race and gender and sexual identity and whatnot were less important and differences more embraced.  I&#39;m not sure why, but I supposed it has to do with geeks and nerds being outcasts along with more conventional Disenfranchised Persons, and the fact that so much of sci-fi, the geek&#39;s staple, involves looking towards the future, and reflecting the problems of society today.  It still isn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s better and getting better all the time.<br><br>But it seems we&#39;ve got even further to go than I thought.</p>

            <p>Alright, so here is how this is going to go.  We are going to keep all nominations from the previous thread and open it up for any new nominations.  After the nominations stop rolling in, the voting will start.<br><br>For those of you who need a refresher, the steps for becoming a PG are:<br><br>1)Get nominated<br>2)Get nomination seconded<br>3)Accept nomination (or decline if you don&#39;t want it)<br>4)Get enough votes to be in the top however-many-people-are-being-chosen<br>5)...<br>6)Hats!<br><br>The people who have been nominated are as follows:<br><br>1)Calista - Not seconded, has declined<br>2)DML - Seconded, has not accepted or declined<br>3)Flareshard - Seconded, has declined<br>4)Maslab - Not seconded, has declined<br>5)Miah - Seconded, has accepted<br>6)Tranum/Tray-Gnome - Seconded, has accepted<br>7)WarriorJoe - Seconded, has declined<br><br>I put all of them there so you can see who has been nominated, and also because they have the option of changing their accept/decline to the other one.<br><br>Let any further nominations commence!</p>

            <p>This is pretty much in response to being nominated in general. <br><br>About three and a half years ago, I was nominated to become a PG for the first time. I said no at the time, because I had been around barely half a year, if even at that point (the time I actually introduced myself was late September. I had tried asking for permission around then; Araeph told me no since I had been essentially quasilurking, posting in dark corners since the first time I posted in August). Quite honestly, the idea of having responsibility for something (nevermind that I was already running the wiki) was a bit terrifying, especially when I had only been around for such a short period of time.<br><br>Since then, I&#39;ve basically played merry hell with avoiding getting nominated again, through various ways, ranging from noticing when the various PGs were becoming inactive and just very carefully disappearing from the public conscienceness as best as I could, to going out of my way and starting the nominations myself by starting them off with people who everyone else would probably choose in overwhelming numbers and make PGs (sorry, Trojie, Sedri, VM. And sort of to Makari as well; if you hadn&#39;t been chosen that time you would&#39;ve been the next).<br><br>Being chosen this time was a bit of surprise, to be honest, considering recent events. By recent events I mean the whole thing with the IRC, and the main reason I brought it up last weekend with the PGs who I knew were active, and wrote that whole document- that reason being that I saw someone who appeared to be very deep with what had happened being nominated herself. <br><br>I can&#39;t help but feel that the reason I got nominated is probably because thanks to that, everyone is remembering that I exist, for whatever reasons they have. If I accepted being nominated, without acknowledging that, or saying anything, it&#39;d be pretty much against a lot of what I try to stand for, personally. <br><br>Basically, what I&#39;m trying to say is this.<br><br>I&#39;m honored, really, really honored by being chosen, but as it is I cannot accept it without bringing that up. <br><br>That said, I&#39;m not turning it down out of hand, but neither am I accepting this nomination entirely.<br><br>If the PPC wants me to be a Permission Giver, even with having read all this, then I&#39;ll accept.</p>

            <p>Let me be blunt. Becoming a PG is not a decision that the community should be making for you. This is a decision that you should be making FOR YOURSELF. You shouldn&#39;t be allowing yourself to be pulled into this by peer pressure. If this nomination is bothering you to such an extent, then don&#39;t accept it.<br><br>If you&#39;d rather just leave this up to vote, very well. I vote that you not accept.</p>

            <p>I suppose it should be said. July is one of my closest friends, and she is one of the first people I go to when I am wondering if I have worded a thing badly, or to poke for concrit, or to rave about a band or goodfic. <br><br>But we have, fairly often, disagreed about whether or not someone should be granted permission. I tend to err on the side of yea, she tends to err on the side of nay. And we have, in the past, disagreed about things like the IRC. I don&#39;t think being a PG gives me any authority at all to do anything besides grant permission; she sometimes disagrees. Given that, <s>Oh God I&#39;m about to make people angry again somebody don&#39;t let me type this</s> and the fact that we&#39;ve had disputes over use of authority in the IRC, I don&#39;t know if I can speak for her nomination to Permission Giver.<br><br>--VM, from a foxhole in the desert</p>

            <p>Phobos.<br><br>Now, I know this might sound like we&#39;re plotting some kind of nepotic coup to take control of the Board and rule forever in infamy, but I promise that&#39;s not why I&#39;m nominating him.<br><br>No, really. Really!<br><br>I&#39;m nominating Phobos because I have every confidence that he&#39;d do PG stuff: he&#39;s often the one reminding me to do it myself when I get distracted and forget. I trust his judgement of what&#39;s in the PPC spirit and what isn&#39;t, because I&#39;m the one who dragged him here and got him involved in it in the first place. Plus, we have a built-in support system if one of us is busy or we need to talk something out, which we often do anyway, because his perspective is different from mine and can shed new light on things. It&#39;s almost guaranteed permission-giving awesomeness, much of which is already happening anyway.<br><br>Of course, if we&#39;re both busy, other people still have to do stuff. Other people should still do stuff anyway, since this isn&#39;t a nepotic takeover.<br><br>*stare*<br><br>So, yeah. Phobos for PG!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Admittedly its very close to afternoon at the time of writing this, but whatever.  Anyways, I am a young writer, hoping to eventually be published and I have through pure coincidence (and Google) discovered this wonderful place.  I think its a wonderful and noble endeavor and greatly wish to take part.<br><br>So, this is the intro to starting my wait to get my very own agents approved.  In addition I look forward to being part of a community of people who take writing and fanfics seriously.  I can&#39;t say much of what I don&#39;t like as I generally like everything, I&#39;m  a jack of all trades, master of none.  I will play shooter games, fighting games, strategy games.  I&#39;ll read fantasy, sci-fi, or modern.  I am a devoted reader of manga and watcher of anime, I play D&amp;D and Warhammer 40k.  In truth just about the only thing I&#39;ve ever actually read that I don&#39;t like would be the Twilight series.  I have no doubt there are other things, I just haven&#39;t read, watched, or whatever them yet.<br><br>Now this is the end so show just a little more patience, just wait a little longer and it will be over.  In order to demonstrate my abilities as a writer, and because I&#39;m always seeking criticism for my work, here is a link to a tale I am currently writing!  <a href="http://chrystallix.deviantart.com/#/d4aiwf4"><a href="http://chrystallix.deviantart.com/#/d4aiwf4">http://chrystallix.deviantart.com/#/d4aiwf4</a></a><br><br>I hope you enjoy it, and my continued company.</p>

            <p>My goodness, Joe! That was a fantastic mission, one of the best I&#39;ve seen in a while. Lots of originality, Word-World mechanics, novel resolution methods, mini-Discords (I can&#39;t help it, I love them). This is one mission I&#39;ll definitely re-read.

            <p>You did an amazing job on this. You really made the most out of the fic for a mission, that is for sure. Your agents reactions really set the tone for how horrible the fic is (Though I still have to read it sometime). <br><br>The switching to another version of the story was interesting too, it really shows how weird the entire thing is. While making the agents confused.<br><br>The bit with Monty was great too, really surreal. It was a cool way to use the horribleness of the fic for something interesting.<br><br>The bit where they snap and charge at Not!Pinky was brilliant, and perfectly done. And showing the canons all okay, and having them be a bit confused, but still okay, and in-character was a great touch too. I&#39;m glad Not!Pinky got her just desserts. <br><br>The epilogue was good too, it&#39;s nice to see that the bit was okay. A pony agent will be interesting to read. All in all, it was a super job! :D</p>

            <p>Excellent mission, even just the bits of the horridfic you included in the mission were enough to turn my stomach. MLP: FiM is definitely the *wrong* place to set a torture fic. <br><br>Also: I love the way you ended it. The way you had the ponies react to not remembering what appeared to have been one hell of a party was highly amusing.

            <p>Most impressive sir, most impressive indeed.  I have never read the badfic in question but if its half as bad as you hinted at then I never wish to so much as set eyes on the thing.  Bravo to you sir on tackling such a horrendous creation.<br><br>Also, Silas...what kind of alien is he?  All the Emperor references made me think Warhammer 40k, but the descriptive pieces just didn&#39;t fit with what I know of the aliens there.</p>

            <p>I read Cupcakes, and a few of the alternate endings (don&#39;t ask why, I have no idea myself!).

            <p>... before I intend to have a shot at Permission within the week - it is understandable that characters in fiction may have a particular piece of equipment that would keep them alive. However, in some canons, merely using this device (or having it merely seen on the person) could be detrimental.<br><br>For example: the Helghast of the video game &quot;Killzone&quot; used to have been forced to wear cumbersome, orange-goggled breathing apperatus in order to adapt to the atmosphere of their home planet and, while it has largly fallen out of disuse, their vast military continues to wear this as a matter of pride (and, it can be assumed, when being involved in environments that their lungs aren&#39;t capable of adapting to).<br><br>Point is, would the use of similar devices disrupt canon and compromise an agent if they are working in a non-native environment?</p>

            <p>Remember that the Disguise Generator built into the console morphs the entire physiology of the Agent using it (except the brain).<br><br>So, any kind of device needed to keep an Agent alive in &quot;normal&quot; conditions would be either disguised alongside the Agent himself or made redundant until the mission is over.

            <p>Beta reading is great and all, and we always do it here gladly.<br><br>But Permission is also kind of a test of your own skills, too. Proofread it like, as superdoubleplusbest you can before you hand it to a beta reader. I&#39;m pretty sure PGs want to judge you on your writing, not the beta reader&#39;s editing.<br><br>But that aside, I submitted a total of <i>three</i> pieces. Which is way overkill.

            <p>I think I&#39;ve seen a few PGs comment on permission pieces with words of the effect of &quot;get thyself a betareader&quot;. Getting a betareader shows you respect the reader.<br><br>Though PPC authors should try to uphold the highest standards (we criticise others so people are going to point out every error we make), we don&#39;t think we are perfect. We know that one of the easiest things is to read over a typo you made yourself. PGs know this too. I doubt it is going to reflect negatively on a person if they admit to having asked someone to betaread their permission piece.<br><br>Besides, how much editing is a beta reader really going to do? I think if someone&#39;s own (unedited) writing was so bad that permission would be witheld, then there would be very few betas taking on the task of betareading the piece. Too much work for them in it.</p>

            <p>There was this one Animaniacs badfic I found back when I was just a wee little lad surfing fanfiction.net for stories to pass the time. I can&#39;t remember what it was called, but it involved the the entire cast being sent to an alien world where toon physics don&#39;t apply. The first couple of chapters were good because it kept everyone in character and were actually pretty funny. <br><br>Then came the self-insert/Marty Stu named after the author&#39;s username. Let me try my best to remember what he did; everyone was helpless without him (he tried to justify this by having the life on the planet being incredibly hostile and deadly, but that doesn&#39;t excuse him or his bit characters), making references to movies where the lines and quips were much better delivered, Minerva falling in love with him on sight, IMPREGNATING Minerva, having a nemesis less effective than the original cartoon Shredder, and being able to tear a monster&#39;s jaw apart WITH HIS BARE HANDS.<br><br>No matter how much I look, I can&#39;t find the fanfic, its sequal, or the author. Perhaps its for the best.</p>

            <p>My first attempts at fanfic were kind of bad. I eventually realized this and destroyed them myself in hopes of saving myself from further embarrassment. This was a while ago.<br><br>More recently, I went to check on a badfic that I had been tracking to find out it was gone. However, the writer left a message saying she just wanted to fix some things. Luckily, it&#39;s not the fic I&#39;m currently writing a mission on. :)</p>

            <p>... were taken down a couple of days after I found them. Fortunately I&#39;d already saved them for riffing purposes. (For the record, these were &quot;Shadow Rapes Matthias&quot; and its sequels, and I was sent Word file copies of them by a friend who already had a membership on the site they were on. When I saw that title, I assumed it was just his description of the fic. Nope, that was the title.)</p>

            <p>It happened to me once. I had remembered a Kingdom Hearts badfic I really wanted to PPC, but not only was that gone, but the author as well! I would like to believe they changed their name and moved out of their state, but with that fic, they probably changed their names, changed their faces, and moved to Hell. The Norweigans are very unhappy about their arrival. ;P<br><br><br>** Hell is the name of a village in Norway.</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m going to have a shot at Permission. Any feedback will be appreciated. Thanks.<br><br><br>Name: Chris Hammond<br>Age: 21<br>Sex: Male<br><br>Appearance: A Caucasian human about 181cm in height, with dirty blonde-hair and short-sighted blue eyes (hence he wears a pair of glasses). Notable features include the lack of a left foot big toe and unusual birth scarring on his left arm and chest. Usually wears a light blue T-shirt, faded denim jeans and white socks and sneakers, though he does change into a business suit for more formal occasions <br><br>Home Continuum: World One (Real World)<br>Department: Department of Floaters<br>Partner: Agent Lothar Roth (trainer)<br><br>Fandoms: Mass Effect series, Dragon Age series, Warhammer 40,000, Star Wars-verse, Doctor Who, Clancy-verse and Tolkien-verse (Original and Movie-verse – general knowledge (so don&#39;t ask him to speak in Rohirric)). Is willing to explore other verses and genres with another agent.<br><br>Lust Objects: Liara T&#39;Soni (Mass Effect series) and Merril (Dragon Age II) are the most notable. <br>Response Center: None ... yet.<br><br>Weapons: 6.5X52 mm Carcano bolt-action carbine, whatever melee weapon he could pick up or improvise with (though he is not a proficient melee fighter). Has extensive knowledge about equipment from Warhammer 40,000 canon.<br><br>Personality: As a new recruit, despite Chris&#39; sociability and his eagerness to become involved within the PPC, his current next to nil experience within the organisation is sorely telling. <br><br>While he does have a fairly broad appeal and is quite learned in the few fandoms he knows, he is inexperienced within the anime/magna genre due to lack of interest and he steers clear of works like “Harry Potter” and “Twilight” where he can. <br><br>He is also noted to be rather vehement against canon/character muddling, which can cause him to act irrationally. Heaven forbid if a canon he enjoys is messed up badly or one of his Lust-Objects is mistreated.<br><br>Lastly, he holds trollfics in contempt, branding them as a waste of time and energy.<br><br>History: An Australian university student, Chris encountered fanfiction relatively late in his teenage life, however, he became instantly enamoured in those works that pulled themselves off well and condescending at the ways that some did not. However, real life called and, for a time, he was parted from the Words World. <br><br>That is, until he learned of an organisation known as the PPC from some general research on TV Tropes. Curious, he searched for further information, yet to his shock, he was suddenly transported to PPC HQ (means unknown, but Chris has since speculated it to be a misfiring portal). With no way back (and intrigued by the place), he volunteered for the PPC, intending to see fiction in a way he had never seen before.<br><br>For the time being, he has been assigned to Agent L. Roth for training. <br><br><br>AGENT 02 (TEMPORARY)<br><br>Name: Lothar Roth<br>Age: 24<br>Sex: Male<br><br>Appearance: A human from Helghan. Notable albino complexion, bald and of average height and musculature. Usually wears a battered Helghast Army uniform and set of armour (though he can change into civilian clothing or an alternate outfit if necessary). Due to the detrimental effects of Helghan&#39;s environment, he is forced to wear their iconic respirator and set of goggles of his people when not in a native environment, though he doesn&#39;t know that Helghast can breath in a normal atmosphere (given time).<br><br>Home Continuum: Killzone<br>Department: Department of Floaters<br>Partner: Chris Hammond (training)<br><br>Fandoms: Multiple popular video games, including, (but not limited to) Call of Duty, Medal of Honour, Mass Effect, Half-Life and the Rainbow Six series. Is looking to dabble in Tolkien or other mediums to  expand his experience.<br>Lust Objects: None known.<br><br>Response Center: [Pending]<br>Weapons: Proficient in modern firearms and CQC. Usually uses a StA52 assault rifle and combat knife (unless the continuum being explored prohibits the use of similar weapons).<br><br>Personality: In general social interaction, he can be normal by human standards. He is interested in drama and has taken a liking to Shakespeare and some actors who had performed works based on the plays (such as Kenneth Branagh) – this could account for his manner of speaking: quipped, blunt and with a bit of subdued flair.<br><br>On the other hand, his time within the PPC have already begun to take a toll. He has become bitter and often rams home that Mary Sues/Marty Stus and their ilk are merely the constructs of amateurs and, as such, are inferior. This attitude and the resulting enraged impulses (possibly a side-effect of his indoctrination in the Helghan military) has caused friction between him, more level-headed agents and higher-ups. <br><br>History: A native of the planet Helghan (one of several colonised planets orbiting Alpha Centauri) and having been brought up in harsh conditions, Loth was recruited into the Helghan Army when he was of appropriate age and trained. About two years after his induction, he participated in the invasion of Vekta, where he was reported as MIA after a fire-fight broke out aboard an orbiting defence platform between the Helghast (who had seized the station) and a four man ISA “commando team”.<br><br>In reality, within the confusion, he had been extracted by a then-unknown representative for the PPC who had been looking to recruit. Faced with the choice of either facing certain death or going along with a stranger into the unknown, Loth accepted an offer and eventually joined the PPC.<br><br>Originally assigned to the Department of Mary Sues, things for Loth began to go downhill over the course of two years. The harsh doctrines that had been ingrained in him within the Helghan Army, despite his best efforts and social attempts, had remained. After several reports of brutal (by PPC standards) executions, Upstairs approached him with an ultimatum: induct new recruits into the basics of PPC operations and reform his conduct or he will be forcefully “retired”. Grudgingly, this was accepted and his first charge is due to arrive within a matter of days... <br><br>Writing Sample: My only fanfiction to date - not great, but should serve as an example of my capabilities: (<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6492167/1/Tip_of_the_Spear_Edge_of_the_Blade_Redux"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6492167/1/Tip_of_the_Spear_Edge_of_the_Blade_Redux">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6492167/1/Tip_of_the_Spear_Edge_of_the_Blade_Redux</a></a>)<br><br>Chosen Badfic: I have decided to stick with a fic I had analysed in detail earlier, “Commissar Cain in deep” (<a href="http://games.adultfanfiction.net/story.php?no=600086800"><a href="http://games.adultfanfiction.net/story.php?no=600086800">http://games.adultfanfiction.net/story.php?no=600086800</a></a> ). WARNING: N.S.F.W.<br><br>Why? Well, to quote the PPC Wiki&#39;s summary:<br><br>“... [it&#39;s] largely comprised of a laundry list of sex acts. Pointless, plotless porn that would be hilarious if it wasn&#39;t so badly written. Contains none of the humor or character of the original novels.”</p>

Your writing sample is very good - I don&#39;t know the canons, but your spelling, grammar, and style pass with flying colors. I&#39;d assume with a PPC spin-off you&#39;d be writing with more humor, but other than that it looks good.<br><br>Permission granted!</p>

            <p>I&#39;d like to sumbit an agent too! Though don&#39;t expect that I&#39;m going to write stories about him since my writing skills are subpar.<br><br>Agent Sinclair<br>Age:  17<br>Sex:  Male<br>Species:  Anthropomorphic sheep (prefers the term sheep-boy)<br><br>Appearance: Sinclair is a Norfolk Horn sheep with brown eyes and black skin. This gives him the appearance of a bipedal sheep with hands and a human-like face while still retaining the hooves of his sheep half. His arms, head, and neck are the only parts of him that are covered in wool. His horns curl around into a lateral spiral.<br>Home continuum:  World One and a half (was abandoned halfway into creation)<br><br>Department:  Department of Floaters<br>Partner:  Currently pending<br>Fandoms:  Starfox, My Little Pony, Animaniacs, Cats Don’t Dance, Sailor Moon, Looney Tunes, and Digimon<br><br>Lust Objects: Cheetara (Thundercats 2011), Peter Cullen’s voice, and Renamon<br><br>Weapons:  Sinclair has little to no understanding on how to fight. As such, he is usually on the sidelines writing charges down and will only use long ranged weapons such as guns and spears. Since he is a sheep and thus is covered in wool, he can use it to generate massive amounts of static electricity; however this only works if he has enough wool and can get close enough to a Sue to zap them.<br>Backstory:  Agent Sinclair was initially the idea for a character for a furry webcomic right before his creator realized that making a dozen more unique characters like him would take too long, so he was abandoned alongside the comic halfway into creation. This left him alone in World One and a half before he was found and taken in. With nothing better to do, he decided to train to become an Agent, determined to make the life for himself that his creator couldn’t. Sinclair is just a nickname he made up during his time training.<br><br>Personality:  Since he was abandoned halfway in to creation, only half of his personality actually exists, so he is currently making up the other half as he goes. His existing personality consists of recklessness, optimism, and a dislike of J-Pop. He has a bad habit of getting angry during a mission, and then revert to his cheerful self shortly afterwards in a matter of seconds.<br></p>

            <p>It&#39;s generally considered rude to tag on to someone&#39;s permission request with agents or a permission request of your own. While we do try to encourage the posting of other badfic in previously created badfic threads, that&#39;s not the case for permission threads. <br><br>Beyond that, agents are for writing with, not just making up or recruiting (be it just because, or to have that many.)<br><br>Additionally, you haven&#39;t been around for very long, nor have you posted very much, which makes this premature, to say the least.</p>

            <p>... ROTHY&#39;s Agent was pretty creative. I wouldn&#39;t mind reading Sinclair&#39;s missons if ROTHY will ever get to write them. I&#39;d say her attempt at a permission request is like a good rough draft.</p>

            <p>There&#39;ve been a couple of efforts in this direction (er... mostly by me, see <a href="http://genericsurface.livejournal.com/profile">Generic Surface</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wjJK4PaIzg">The Children&#39;s Book</a>), but you&#39;re thinking of something more mainstream...<br><br>There&#39;s an Australian children&#39;s series called Fairy Tale Police Department (FTPD) which is alarmingly close to being the PPC on TV. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fairy-Tale-Police-Department-Complete/dp/B000F39QUC">This one</a>. I won&#39;t say it&#39;s brilliant (it was free on LoveFilm.com last I checked, so we watched a couple of episodes), but it is surreal watching, well, a pair of bickering people in uniform trying to fix stories which keep going wrong. Surreal as <i>heck</i>.<br><br>The main problem with the PPC-as-show is, er, two problems. First, the PPC itself still belongs (sorta) to Jay and Acacia. Otherwise, I&#39;d be the first to try and sneak it into the real world. The second problem is that it consists virtually in its entirety of playing with other copyrighted works - which, yeah, doesn&#39;t go down too well. If we could overcome the first part (which... would pretty much consist of the Board agreeing to) we&#39;d still have to make it all Sherlock Holmes, E. Nesbit and H.G. Wells. Or Dickens... well, it could work, I suppose.<br><br>On the /other/ hand... if we had several PPCers living near each other, they could probably get together regularly and make film versions of specially-written missions. Sure, they&#39;d have to be set in whatever environments they could reach, but it could be done.<br><br>Any volunteers?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Drop the PPC theme all together. We&#39;re a bunch of aspiring writers, right? We ought to be able to put together at least one volume of short stories worth reading. I know I&#39;ve got at least three I&#39;d donate to, let&#39;s call it Continuum - published through some internetty people, a volume of stories from the young (mostly) authors of the PPC.

            <p>... keep the rating down - after all, we want the entire PPC to be able to read it comfortably, and probably friends and family as well - but don&#39;t specify a theme. At least for the first volume. After all, if it takes off, we might end up with a series.<br><br>The most pressing practical problem is finding someone who&#39;ll print on demand - I doubt there&#39;s anyone on the Board willing to pay up-front for however many copies on the hope that others will buy them.

            <p>... is that we&#39;ve tried it before, and it&#39;s always the point where these projects fall down. SilmFilm and the PPC movie both had wonderful scripts and loads of volunteers for voice acting; the Radio Plays prove it&#39;s possible to get people to record all the voices (and I think the Movie had a lot of the voice work done); but I&#39;ve never seen a single frame of animation for any of these.<br><br>As far as I&#39;m aware, there&#39;s no one near enough to me for me to get involved (other than Kaitlyn, of course), and I don&#39;t really have the time anyway.

            <p>Every new topic made pushes an old one off the edge of the page. And since most of us don&#39;t read past the first page for replies, that ends the discussions on them very quickly-- not to mention that our space here is finite, and eventually the topics past disappear forever. So we generally prefer that you keep the new threads to a slower pace-- you can reply to old threads all you want, but creating two new ones in a row, unless you have very good reason, is generally a bad idea. Likewise with badfic threads-- if you have a new badfic to report, first check to make sure there&#39;s not a thread already up to report/claim.<br><br>This is especially right now, since we really need people to see the Permission Givers topic. If you are interested in poking people at higher speeds, check out the link to our IRC channel up at the top of the page-- it&#39;s a fun place to hang out! Lots of fellow PPCers about.<br><br>(But yes, watching the PPC Cartoon Series would be awesome. We do have a webcomic in the form of LEGO, by hS somewhere, and there&#39;s a radio play.)</p>

            <p>I always pictured it as the room in Death&#39;s library, where you keep going, and the lighting gets dimmer, and slowly you find threads written in archaic tongues, arguing about topics like &quot;Do Balrogs have wings?&quot; and whether or not Fëanor was a tragic hero, or a villain in his own right, bound on animal skins and written in charcoal, and then you get farther on and find stone tablets, with incomprehensible hieroglyphs carved in weird triangles, which, when translated, would give you the ultimate origins of the Flowers or where Glitter <i>really</i> came from, but alas, their translations are lost forever to the sands of time.<br><br>Except, unlike in Death&#39;s library, infinity is a steep drop off a perfectly cornered edge, and it inches closer with every new volume written.</p>
