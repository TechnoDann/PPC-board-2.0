            <p>I want to write about what happens to badfic when the PPC is done purging it. It&#39;s kind of a large-scale idea and really hard to wrap your head around if you aren&#39;t fluent in PPC-speak.<br><br>Question #1:<br>Are there any stories specifically dealing with what happens to badfic when the PPC is done there? I am *not* looking for fics about agents taking out things or even people (i.e. children) with them. I am not talking about the badfic universe collapsing. I am talking about what happens when the universe is &quot;back to normal&quot;. Because I would like to do that.<br><br>Question #2:<br>May I write about a story that doesn&#39;t exist?<br>You see, I wanted to have a story about the TV cop show Blue Bloods. However, there are no PPC missions about the Blue Bloods. There are not really horrible, awful fics about Blue Bloods yet (But I&#39;m sure there will be later), and I don&#39;t want to use my imagination thinking up a really, really horrible BB fic, either.<br><br>Question #3: <br>Has anyone ever addressed &quot;losing your insanity?&quot; Because I think I may use that. It could be like (Discworld) going the opposite of drunk, only it&#39;s the opposite of insane. It could be worse than insanity (which is really common around here), because it could mean that the person tries to see how everything makes sense. But almost everything doesn&#39;t make sense. At all. So that would be even worse than going clinically insane. Or would that be a kind of insanity?  Hmm...<br><br>Question #4: Does the PPC have &#39;copyrights&#39; (er, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not the right word but you get the idea) on anything other than agents and OFUs? I&#39;m not sure how to say this. Hmm. <br><br>Question #5: Can I set up an organization that is neither an OFU or a PPC-style thing, but still talks about what happens when writers write bad badfic? Can I mention OFUs and the PPC without asking permission? Because I&#39;d be asking everyone permission.<br><br>For example, if I say in my fic that the Sunflower argued with an agent about a result of Bleeprin experimentation, would I have to find out who invented the Sunflower? (I&#39;m pretty sure it was Jay &amp; Acacia).<br><br>As you can see, my brain (what&#39;s left of it) is churning like crazy.<br><br>I am incredibly happy, though. This is the largest amount of written ideas I&#39;ve had in almost forever. I&#39;m really excited. And now I&#39;m going to go read the Wiki *golden lights and choir voices* while I wait for replies.</p>

            <p>(Hope you don&#39;t mind, Aeidhryn)<br><br>My agents need to use the handy dandy &quot;present tense detected, reset fic to past tense&quot; button.  I was going to look up how other authors have handled this, but every link I find on the wiki is broken.<br><br>I don&#39;t feel comfortable with rewriting fic quotes to past tense.  OTOH, leaving the quotes in present tense gives the impression that the button didn&#39;t work.<br><br>Has anyone on the thread dealt with a present-tense fic?  How did you handle the reset to past tense?</p>

            <h1>1: In a few of my missions I&#39;ve mentioned that the fic will fold in on itself. It will just disappear. In a way it&#39;s like everything non-canon will be sucked into a black hole and everything else will pop back in the place where it belongs.<br><br>#2: Like hypothetical badfic? That could work. Just don&#39;t write your own. I&#39;ve seen a few people write Sues on purpose (both for parody and so they&#39;d have something to PPC, seriously) and they usually overdo it on the bad spelling front. If on million monkeys can churn out Shakespeare, than 352 of them wrote that dialogue.<br><br>#4: Technically, I have copyright on anything that I have written. Including this message post. But I guess that is not what you meant.<br><br>Hmm. A bunch of equipment belongs to the PPC, except the things that were stolen from other canons (such as neuralyzers and SEP fields). Minis originally came from OFUM.<br><br>#5: Mentioning things without having permission in my opinion, is okay. It would be like a pop culture reference. I doubt Joss Whedon had permission from Monty Python when he had Dawn say: No one expects the Spanish Inquisition.</h1>

            <p>Since you mentioned Discworld, this is sort of addressed in &quot;Thief of Time&quot; (someone is the opposite of insane...sort of. It&#39;s complicated). I would think it sort of works the same way as being knurd; you need some body alcohol to keep the world from looking like the awful place that it is (or something), so maybe you also need a bit of insanity to supply creativity, dreams, inspiration, etc. or to make life more fun.<br><br>I don&#39;t know how you would get to be &quot;enasni,&quot; though, since there isn&#39;t an insanity equivalent of Klatchian coffee...yet.</p>

            <p>Question #1:<br><br>No idea, personally. I&#39;m sure someone knows, though.<br><br>Question #2:<br><br>Yes. ElvenEars, long, long ago, did that-- wrote a mission set on a composite of badness, rather than any specific badfic. And I believe others have, as well. If I ever do a mission, it&#39;ll probably be along the same lines. <i>Definitely</i> don&#39;t write a badfic yourself. One of the reasons for the PPC is a love of goodfic-- last thing we want to do is reverse that.<br><br>Question #3:<br><br>It sounds like a very, very interesting concept and story, and you&#39;ve my best wishes for writing it.<br><br>Question #4:<br><br>The rules are fairly simple. Don&#39;t use PPC property-- HQ, the Flowers, the uniforms (specific to PPC), etc. The OFUs were Miss Cam&#39;s domain, but she doesn&#39;t handle those anymore, I don&#39;t think. In light of recent RL events, poking her about them might be a bad idea. If you&#39;re using a PPC character that&#39;s not yours, ask permission and give credit-- that&#39;s about it, unless someone else has a better answer. If you&#39;re really not sure about something, you can always check with a beta, too.<br><br>Question #5:<br><br>Absolutely. There&#39;s a plethora of anti-badfic agencies out there<s>, we&#39;re just the coolest</s>. Personally, I&#39;d love to see more essay-type-things about fanfiction in general, and I&#39;d really love to see more people with a wider range of badfic-responses than &quot;Sue! Kill!&quot; I might actually have to join you, there...<br><br>The Sunflower was indeed invented by Jay and Acacia. He&#39;s one of those characters that&#39;s pretty much fair use for anyone, as long as you&#39;re not going OOC. Just don&#39;t kill anyone off or make sweeping changes to PPC canon without asking. </p>

            <p>Yes, the PPC is the coolest, but also the most complicated. And I&#39;m not trying to shoulder my way into a niche that the PPC has filled for years-- I&#39;m trying to discover a new one.<br><br>Question #1: So, where can I find PPC characters like the Sunflower and Lux that can be maybe used for a cameo?

The writing is decent - although the author has no idea how to space dialogue, I have seen worse writing in terms of grammar and mechanics.<br><br>The problem is that Alonna Jones is a terrible Hetalia Mary Sue because she claims to represent Hawaii but somehow maintains ties to France and Greece. France was responsible for knocking her up seven times. I kid you not.</p>

I am not allowed to read badfic to Hex.<br><br>1276. I am not allowed to replicate any of the items on Skippy&#39;s List, whether they made it onto the list or not.<br><br>1276b. Especially not throwing squid pies into the SO&#39;s face.<br><br>1276c. Or filling the SO&#39;s office with inflatable sheep.<br><br>1277. No, the German lyrics to IAMX&#39;s song &#39;Bernadette&#39; do not in fact translate as a sure-fire spell of any kind. Yes, it might be good for scaring Sues, but it won&#39;t make the SO give me time off.<br><br>1278.

            <p><i> by Agent T. Monk</i><br><br>ALMA, MI (IRL) -- Although a sprinkling of light rain threatened a potential crisis, the real-world wedding of PPC operatives Phobos and Neshomeh was, in blatant defiance of the Universal Laws of Comedy and Irony, <i>not</i> blighted by disaster or allegedly hilarious hijinks. <br><br>The two operatives, known to PPCers for Neshomeh&#39;s devoted service to the organization and Phobos&#39; unholy glee in participating in the badfic game, were married at the chapel of the college of Alma in a simple ceremony that was not crashed by anyone. Phobos and his groomsmen sported formal kilts, while the bride wore trailing white accented with a sash in correction-ink red. (This reporter may have teared up a little when she saw Neshomeh walking down the aisle, but you didn&#39;t hear it from her. Stop looking at her like that.) Rings were exchanged, and the new Mr. and Mrs. Phobos were played out by a piano medley that included, among other things, the <i>Star Wars</i> imperial march.<br><br>We cannot confirm or deny a Flower presence at the reception, which was held in a college hall next to the chapel, but it should be noted that despite the heat the bride&#39;s bouquet was looking suspiciously fresh and lively. <br><br>The alarming trend of heartwarming non-disaster was continued at the reception, where the bride and groom shared dances with their loved ones and did, as far as this reporter can tell, both the Cha Cha Slide and the Hokey-Pokey. Another form of potentially hilarious crisis was averted via a clever scheme; knowing the wedding tradition of chiming glasses to force the bride and groom to kiss, the reception&#39;s DJ announced that every time the assembled party tried to do that, he would draw the name of another couple in the room and force <i>them</i> to &quot;show the bride and groom how it&#39;s done.&quot; This prevented too many spontaneous attempts at inducing kissing and only added to the agreeable, lighthearted and completely non-ironic air of the occasion. This reporter caught the bouquet.<br><br>Photographs will be provided when this reporter&#39;s camera stops being an ass, which is unfortunately a rare occasion indeed.<br><br>Congratulations, Phobos and Neshomeh! May Eru smile upon you. Also, please don&#39;t kill me for writing this. *hides*<br><br></p>

            <p>Normally, I like to start off my comments with the aspects of the piece that I really liked before moving on to the areas that needed improvement. What bothered me about this MST, however, was so big that I feel like I need to bring it up right away. Don&#39;t get me wrong; this is very enjoyable and quite funny. But I&#39;ve got to say this.<br><br>I did not like the structure of this piece. The conventional story format, I mean. I&#39;ve always associated MSTs with the much-maligned scriptfic format, like so:<br><br><i>Quote from the fic being lampooned</i><br>CHARACTER: Snarky comment!<br>OTHER CHARACTER: Response to snarky comment.<br><br>Using an otherwise normal format for action and dialogue - as you have done - makes the piece feel sloppy, especially when you take into account that almost every new paragraph starts with someone talking. I feel like you could have turned this into a typical scriptfic-style MST without losing any of the jokes. You actually could have used both styles if you wanted to, using Luxury&#39;s pulling of the &#39;light switch&#39; as the cue to switch over to the scriptfic format. Once the badfic ended, everything would have reverted back to normal.<br><br>Still, I understand that everyone has their own style. Feel free to dismiss me as a backwards-looking kook if you like.<br><br>*gets down off his Ranting Podium*<br><br>You have some excellent character interactions here. I particularly liked Cali&#39;s stuttering and blushing routine. I just want to hug him sometimes!<br><br>TL;DR: It&#39;s very funny, but I did not like the structure.</p>

            <p>Hi, I&#39;m Albatross! Comrade Tranum referred me here and is currently informing me as to what to post here. He is telling me to inform people what fandoms I&#39;m a part of, so I guess I have to. I guess I&#39;d have to say my top 5 Fandoms would be Pokemon, Touhou, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Castlevania. I love a whole load of things, so...yeah...That&#39;s about all I&#39;ve got to say about myself...</p>

            <p>What are your views on RPF? I just found out that there&#39;s Generation Kill fic, and for those who don&#39;t know, it&#39;s a TV series based off a book that was the real-life account of a reporter who accompanied Marines into Iraq in 2003. I don&#39;t know why ff.net allows people to write what is in essence RPF, but it does.<br><br>But anyway, what is your take on RPF? </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t read a lot of real person fiction, but in my opinion, it depends on what the story is about, what happens, and how it&#39;s written. A famous actor having an amusing day on the beach seems pretty harmless.<br><br>The same actor getting written into bad slash in which he leaves his family behind to take part in whatever fantasies the author has in mind.... Not so much.<br><br>But Aster already made a good point about real people as characters. And I agree, forcing an AU real person to go too far is a bit creepy.<br><br>So my reaction to real person fiction can range anywhere from amused to thoroughly creeped out, but it all depends on the story itself.</p>

            <p>In my spin off, if the PPC ever encounters &#39;real people&#39; in a badfic, they are kind of like author inserts in that they aren&#39;t the &#39;real&#39; real person (the one that we know, behind the fourth wall) but an alternate universe version that exists in the PPC Prime Multiverse.<br><br>In the same way a Self Insert isn&#39;t REALLY the author, but an AU copy, so are the &#39;real people&#39; copies of the originals. No less important than the originals, though. <br><br>But... it&#39;s kind of bad to do that because it&#39;s one thing to write an AU of yourself, but another thing entirely to write an AU version of someone else. An author may choose to make their Self-insert leave their family and friends behind and forget about them, but MAKING another person do that? Nightmare fuel.<br><br>If I encountered a Real Person, I would have to escort them back to their real origin-AU to be with their family and friends, or exorcise that origin AU of glitter to let them just live their lives in peace.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t go after RPF itself, though. That sounds like a job for Despatch.</p>

            <p>But not totally. For instance, Robert Graves&#39; &quot;I, Claudius&quot; is technically RPF, being essentially the fictional autobiography of the emperor Claudius. Compare/contrast Ralph Nader&#39;s &quot;Only The Super-Rich Can Save Us,&quot; (which, I feel obliged to add, I was very disappointed in; Ralph Nader writing RPF should be the crackiest thing ever committed to paper, not this dull slog) where a whole bunch of billionaires get together and decide to change the world with a parrot mascot.<br><br>I think RPF can be done well (as in the case of Claudius) as long as the author bears in mind that they are writing about a real person and does their best to treat the subject(s) with respect. I&#39;d also add that, as a point of courtesy, one shouldn&#39;t write about people who are still alive. Writing RPF as an extension of one&#39;s own lurid fantasies is just sleazy.</p>

            <p>I loathe the stuff. I know that when somebody puts their lives out there as public, they generally know people are gong to mess about with it. Same as prying, for the press-- it&#39;s not okay to pick a random neighbor and start writing stories about how their kids are turning out, but it&#39;s fine to do that to a celebrity, because they&#39;re public figures...<br><br>But the idea of taking a real person&#39;s life and, without their consent, drawing up stories about them, sort of flips a switch in my brain. Like bandfic-- people might have a lot of fun slashing four attractive musicians, but they don&#39;t seem to realize that those people who they&#39;re writing about having sex in the studio have wives, and kids, and... the whole idea just sorta makes me twitch. <br><br>But everybody&#39;s different. Like Cassie said, the PPC doesn&#39;t (as far as I know) go after RPF, but I don&#39;t know if anyone here does MSTs or something. There might be something on the Wiki.</p>

            <p>I know Trojie did an RPF slash story once. There might be others, I&#39;m not sure.<br><br>*sigh* The reason I asked was that I posted a rant on LiveJournal about people writing fic for Generation Kill when it&#39;s basically RPF, and a lot of the comments are basically &#39;Generation Kill fics aren&#39;t RPF, because the TV series is based off the book, and the Marines aren&#39;t playing themselves, and things got altered, so it&#39;s not inaccurate to call them characters&#39;. I&#39;m not buying it, though. These characters have the names, jobs, pasts, and often similar or identical personalities to the people they&#39;re supposedly *not*, so how can you not call this RPF?</p>

            <p>By &quot;wacky&quot; I mean ones which you come up with and just know that it&#39;s going to be either one of the best or one of the worst fics ever, but either way you just can&#39;t get it out of your mind.<br><br>I bring the idea up because I was browsing the <i>Penguins of Madagascar</i> pages on TVTropes recently, and on the Wild Mass Guessing page I suggested that the entire show is actually a human in a mental hospital imagining that he&#39;s a penguin, a la <i>Sucker Punch</i>. I meant it as a joke, but then I got the idea stuck in my head and thought &quot;Hey, that could really work ...&quot; <a href="http://chelonianmobile.deviantart.com/#/d42irhh">I drew it</a> just to get it out of my system for a bit, but I think I&#39;ll have to try writing it once I have time. Sadly I have nobody to tell me whether it&#39;s a good or bad idea, because I don&#39;t know anyone who knows both fandoms.<br><br>As for other wacky crossovers, there is a ficcer who goes by the name of dreya_uberwald on Livejournal, who is the queen of the random crossover. She has a whole fictional town called Willowholme which she created for the sole purpose of having characters from random fandoms meet up in it. I can&#39;t do her work justice in mere words, but it&#39;s funny as heck.</p>

            <p>My biggest fandom right now is GI Joe, and I love love love crossing over stuff with it. The great thing about GI Joe is that it can, with only minor tweaking/creative thinking, cross over with any number of universes--as long as it&#39;s set on an earth where the 1980s conceivably happened.<br><br>For example, I wrote a crossover fic where Snake-Eyes (heavily scarred, blond, mute martial artist good guy) meets Deadpool (heavily scarred, blond, never-shuts-up martial artist Chaotic Neutral). Also, for the hell of it, I did a short &quot;what if Larry Hama and Andrew Lloyd Webber collaborated on a GI Joe musical?&quot; thing, which essentially crossed over Joe and Phantom of the Opera.<br><br>My favorite effort, though, is a crack crossover without the crack: GI Joe meets Alien vs. Predator. It&#39;s kind of sad, and scary, how much effort I wound up putting into making it all fit, and how eerily everything matches up. *headshake*</p>

            <p>Yes yes yes! Half of the ideas I have for fanfiction are weird crossover ideas that probably shouldn&#39;t go together. But then I get either a brilliant or terrible idea as to how they could be combined and I have to write it. Most of it is slightly cracky and not good for publishing, but some of them have turned out to be my best work. I just love reading and writing crossovers. And hey, some of the ones you would expect to be crackiest are actually the best. </p>

            <p>Whenr a certain friend of mine comes over- let&#39;s call her Bellatrix- sometimes we&#39;ll just go on a crackfic adventure and end up joining LotR with Artemis Fowl with Pride and Prejudice just for the heck of it.

            <p>I did ask a friend of mine who knows the show and read a summary of Sucker Punch, but he doesn&#39;t like grimdark remakes much, and it would end up pretty horrifying, given that the plot of Sucker Punch relies on sexual abuse, unnecessary brain surgery, and half the cast dying. Though I do like the idea of Julien dancing to &quot;Love is the Drug&quot; from the deleted scene (video contains scantily-clad women so is probably not worksafe): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8qBHeSk_OY"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8qBHeSk_OY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8qBHeSk_OY</a></a></p>

            <p>In the movie, three girls die in Fantasy Layer 1 (Fantasy Layer 2 itself seems to die along with the first girls&#39; death), the leading lady is lobotomised (the severe kind - it is in fact possible to remain reasonably functional after a lobotomy, but it&#39;s pretty clear this is the type that she wouldn&#39;t recover from), and only one escapes. I figured out a way to get the lead character out of the lobotomy, but I&#39;m not sure if avoiding the three deaths would lessen the impact of the story, or how to avoid using them if I did want to. I have no attachment to the human versions of the characters, but people might be upset about me killing off the cute&#39;n&#39;cuddly animal characters (which I&#39;m using for Fantasy Layer 1). Would probably be the latter kind of &quot;upset&quot; though, so maybe I should ignore that.</p>

            <p>Would we be collaborating with the Skainet roleplayers? Would we just be taking the idea and running with it?

            <p>Name: Lady of the Ocean<br>Mary Sue&#39;s name: Lady Galadrina Wavesong<br>Type: Classic Mary Sue, Legomance<br>Mistakes: Grammar, Spelling, Urple Prose, calling Legolas &quot;Greenleaf&quot;, not Thranduilion, making the Mary Sue fall off her horse and everybody treat it as if it&#39;s a life or death situation, Exaggerating the wound that you get when you fall off a horse, making Legolas have servants, and general OOCness for all the canon characters. It also is a Tenth Walker. The Mary Sue is both tall and small, which is impossible. And, more atrocitous, the author read the books, because Legolas has brown hair. Or, she just didn&#39;t pay much attention during the movie. This badfic is incomplete. </p>

            <p>We kinda prefer if you keep the badfic links/gaping to one thread.

            <p>I&#39;m working on my second mission, a Belgariad/Malloreon badfic.  There&#39;s a couple misspelled character names, and there&#39;s no mention of an established mini type for this world on the wiki.  Has this been discussed elsewhere?<br><br>If naming rights are open, I have a couple ideas for them.<br><br>1) A miniature version of the appropriate god&#39;s totem.  For example, if the mini is a misspelled Alorn name, it would be a tiny bear (Belar, god of the Alorns, has a bear totem).  There&#39;s just two problems with this; first, I can&#39;t find a totem for UL, and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s one for the god who shows up at the end of &quot;The Seeress of Kell&quot;.  (Name omitted as a spoiler.)  So any mini-Ulgos, or mini-Angaraks post-Seeress of Kell wouldn&#39;t have an established form.  Second, there are several races that don&#39;t <em>have</em> a god.  It&#39;s implied that the new God of Angarak will accept those races, but that just brings us back to the &quot;no totem animal&quot; problem.<br><br>2) A mini-Orb of Aldur.  (Malloreon-era Angarak minis could be a mini-Sardion.)  This would require a MASSIVE power downgrade to be remotely safe for Agents to adopt.  Seriously, if Garion wanted to he could use the (original) Orb to rearrange constellations.<br><br>Any opinions/links to an established mini type?</p>

            <p>Hi there.

I wish to place them in the Department of Mary Sues.<br><br>Ray Chell is a human female and escaped author avatar of about twenty years of age. She has some experience observing Sues from a safe distance but has never engaged a Sue before, preferring to quietly pass her reports along to other agents instead.<br><br>Connor is an impulsive human male who might be anywhere from eighteen to twenty-two, give or take a year; his foster family wasn&#39;t sure of his age, and he doesn&#39;t know it either. He displays wolfish mannerisms, but has learned to repress many of them and behave like a normal human when he can help it.

It is then established that the girl is &quot;a reaper...a God of Death&quot; who even appears in Hyrulean mythology.

            <p>This badfic is horrendous. Its name? Aurelia, the protector and golden light. The lack of capital letters was intentional on my part. Classic Mary Sue. This is in the movieverse, and obviously the two main characters are Legolas and Aurelia, daughter of Sauron, which is almost impossible. Oh, and her mom? Eragon&#39;s mom. Yes, that Eragon, the Canon Stu. Bad grammar and spelling, this is perfect for a mission. :) </p>

            <p>The short answer: No.<br><br>Long answer: It is considered something akin to a personal attack on the author (as opposed to his/her story) and is thus frowned upon. At least I think that is the reason. Oh, also, it attracts whiners and flamers and we don&#39;t want them.<br><br>The wiki *golden light shines from above and a hallelujah choir is heard* has this to say on the subject:<br>&#39;Giving the author links to the mocking we do is frowned upon by both the PPC and GAFF. There have, unfortunately, been people who have taken it upon themselves to try to make us look like flamers. Anyone can link to our site, so the presence of that link does not make the linker automatically one of us.<br><br>Most likely, the &quot;reviewer&quot; in question is not a PPCer at all, but rather a vengeful fangirl trying to stir up authors and start a flame-war. Keep in mind while you&#39;re reading the reviews that we are a loose confederation, not a closed secret society with singular thoughts.&#39;</p>

            <p>In the first mission I did, the author seemed to just go &quot;Muahahaha! Dance, little monkeys, dance!&quot; with all the characters. Not a trace of canon love. And she had awful grammar, even though her profile said, that she was studying English at college and was hoping to become an English teacher.<br>So I can totally understand wanting to link the author and tell him/her not just that their story sucks, but excactly how much and in what ways. <sup><sup><br><br>But</sup></sup> like it also says on the golden and shiny and singing wiki (although I can&#39;t find the excact quote so maybe it was somewhere else) it is not nice to make some 13 year-old cry herself to sleep, because we ripped her Legomance to shreds.</p>

            <p>I have to admit, I wasn&#39;t too sure about your agents at first. But they&#39;re definitely growing on me. Not only that, but the mission was both tremendously entertaining and very well put together.<br><br>The one qualm I have is that there are occasional stretches where your agents just stand around and complain. Once or twice is okay, but it started to wear on me the further along things went. Maybe try to spice things up with a bit more banter next time.<br><br>Other than that, this was great. Kudos!</p>

            <p>I must immediately brainstorm as to exactly what genophase does. We got geno- for the genome, obviously, and -phase as in a distinctive form. Maybe it liquefies your genome?

            <p>That was a stupid fic. I&#39;m not a fan of crossoverships to begin with and this had all the worst traits of the species.<br><br>By the way, when I read the title and the ... um ... second title? What are these things called? Anyway, where it says &#39;In which romance is approached way too quickly&#39; I thought there was going to be something about Maria. <sup>^</sup></p>

            <p>Yeah, the thing about Florestan and Maria is that with how quick they&#39;re going, they&#39;re at least not planning on jumping on each other in QUITE that way yet. So yeah...<br><br>Thanks! =D</p>

            <p>Just wanted to say thanks to those of you who gave me suggestions of places to see in London. Here&#39;s hoping the plane ride doesn&#39;t kill me before I get there.<br>And if any of you Boarders on that side of the pond happen to run into a pimply, nerdy teen with a perpetual idiotic grin prancing down the street and displaying every imaginable stereotype of an American tourist within the next two weeks or so, well... I apologize in advance.</p>
