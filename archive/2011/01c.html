            <p>Greetings all,<br><br>My contribution to the fight against the Sues takes the form of MSTs, using two squads of original characters.  <br><br>Foxtrot Squad is three brothers who worked for the PPC for several years, went MIA presumably in Middle Earth (another story entirely), returned and promptly resigned from official duty.  Though their resignation papers seem to have been misfiled.  The theater actively fights them for unknown reasons.<br><br>Tango Squad is three characters that may or my not be manifestations of my multiple personalities.  They&#39;re three Lords, though they are probably more like Time Lords without the steadfast morality than English blue-bloods.<br><br>Anyway, you can find all that here at <a href="http://nofreakinway.weebly.com/nst-3000.html"><a href="http://nofreakinway.weebly.com/nst-3000.html">http://nofreakinway.weebly.com/nst-3000.html</a></a> as well as my Star Wars spinoffs, original fiction, and blog.<br><br>Adieu,<br>Jesse Abram</p>

            <p>Thank you, water and robes I actually have great need of, so, excellent gift giving. <br><br>Fandoms... well, I&#39;m a big Star Wars fan; Firefly holds a sad little place in my heart; Lord of the Rings et. al of course; The Mallorean and Belgariad, though I haven&#39;t gotten my hands on all of those yet; I&#39;m probably too big a fan of my own writing, if that counts.  <br><br>Confession: I really like reading what I write, I hope that means other people do, too.  The &quot;I Write Like&quot; website told my I write like Corey Doctorow.  That was from an excerpt of a novel I&#39;m 2/3 of the way to completely.  The novel is about...<br><br>...My biggest craze, Humans vs Zombies, a moderated tag game played on college campuses using Nerf blasters and pure awesomeness.  This is probably the best video made in relation to the game: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSNK8gr5GH8"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSNK8gr5GH8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSNK8gr5GH8</a></a>  though if you want a real explanation everything can be found here: <a href="http://humansvszombies.org/"><a href="http://humansvszombies.org/">http://humansvszombies.org/</a></a></p>

            <p>Because if you are, you should probably introduce yourself first.

And also, I think (but am not sure) you need Permission (<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission</a></a>) if you&#39;re going to write using PPC-based characters. There&#39;s also some other stuff that you should read too, but as I am FAR too lazy to give you lynx and such, I&#39;ll just let some oldbie do it. (Also, I&#39;m not 100% sure what said stuff is, and I&#39;m trying to avoid randomly giving you lots and lots of unnecessary stuff.) <br><br>If you&#39;re not actually new, and I&#39;m just being completely boneheaded about this whole affair, please accept my sincere apologies. I haven&#39;t seen you before, and I&#39;ve been here for a while (well, lurking for a while. I&#39;ve actually only been officially &#39;here&#39; for less than a month, so, whatever) so I&#39;m just assuming you&#39;re new.<br><br>Weeell, I&#39;m talking FAR too much, so...Ciao!</p>

            <p>&quot;1. Email Miss Cam or ask at the PPC Board for permission before posting. If you don&#39;t do this, at the very least tell us you&#39;ve written one and send the link, so it can be linked in the Archive. Also if you don&#39;t get it beta&#39;d, use a spellcheck.&quot;  <br><br>Well, this is the first of the original rules posted on Miss. Cam&#39;s site.  I don&#39;t want to start an argument, of course, but I sent the obligatory email to Miss Cam.

            <p>This is the PPC board.It always has been. The URL changed, the board itself did not. The link on Miss Cam&#39;s site is severely outdated, not to mention that she&#39;s moved well on to other things considering it&#39;s been over four years at this point.<br><br>And I don&#39;t believe that grandfathering in works that way. If you were reading the original stories before they stopped writing you could have asked for (and received) permission from them then. That is to say, times have moved on, there is a different set of permission givers and things have changed.</p>

            <p>Squads and military alphabet... Well, I&#39;m an avid Humans vs. Zombies player (a moderated game of tag played on college campuses using Nerf blasters and pure awesomeness), so that&#39;s probably I organized my people into squads.  As for the military alphabet designations, I was part of a radio talk show during my undergraduate years called Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.  I&#39;m not much of a drinker, and neither are my characters, so using Whiskey Squad would have been misleading  Tango and Foxtrot are both dances, now that I think about it, but I don&#39;t think that had anything to do with it, but it&#39;s quirky, so it works, yes?<br><br>If you&#39;re reading Fangirls and Elf-friends, you should know I&#39;m in the middle of revising those. My original run through was a little sparse, and less funny than I had hoped.</p>

            <p>...You don&#39;t have to go through the whole Permission thing again, but if you really want to do your month a second time, I don&#39;t think anybody&#39;s going to stop you. <br><br>With that said, hello! It should be nice to have you back. I&#39;m not entirely sure how things are as opposed to how you left them - approximately how long ago did you leave? Whenever it was, the only thing I can just about guarantee is that there are more people here now than before. <br><br>P.S. I&#39;ve been giving out electric-blue hand-knitted yak-wool scarves to the past few newbies, so you&#39;re getting one too. </p>

            <p>Hi, I&#39;m Nikolaos. I don&#39;t write very much and I prefer original universes rather than fanfiction writing but I do love to read fanfic. I also love to review and poke fun at things when I can so naturally I&#39;m attracted to bad fiction.<br><br>The fandoms I follow are Nintendo stuff like Metroid and Zelda, Final Fantasy, Harry Potter... that&#39;s all I can think of off the top of my head. I&#39;m generally attracted to more lighthearted things though.</p>

Instead, have a scarf. I handknitted out of yak wool, so it is therefore made warmly but badly. It is electric blue, but don&#39;t worry, I didn&#39;t use any dye. Just in case...you&#39;re allergic...or something...<br><br>I&#39;m going to shut up now, before this gets really awkward. Ciao!</p>

            <p>Greetings all! I am Songbird-O! While I don&#39;t write much fanfiction myself, I do dabble in it every now and then (as of writing this, I have only submitted one experimental Dragon Quest one-shot to the pit). I fancy myself as more of an internet-roaming critic, as analyzing fiction and artwork is something I really love to do.<br><br>I play a lot of video games. I adore Fire Emblem and Dragon Quest among many others. I&#39;ve done a few casual riffs, but never any sporking. So bear with me.<br><br>In all media, I love to see creative and interesting worlds. I love to see how things work. I like stories that tend towards the simple and short, but are able to say a lot with a little.<br><br>So yeah. Hey there.</p>

            <p>In regards to video games, there are a lot of games that I would consider myself a fan of. I&#39;m very fond of the Mother (Earthbound) and Golden Sun games. There are plenty of other individual games I like, such as Okami, Baten Kaitos Origins, and a very small fraction of the Final Fantasy games (IV being my favorite).<br>I absolutely love Yu Yu Hakusho, Cyborg 009, and Dragonball. Though I wouldn&#39;t call myself anime fan, since those are pretty much the only three I like.<br><br>I do some reading as well, but I&#39;m not really a fan of any specific book series. My favorite movies are Fantasia 1940, My Fair Lady (the 1960&#39;s version), and Spirited Away.</p>

            <p>I really don&#39;t like using the Board for this sort of thing, but I really can&#39;t find any other method of contact...<br><br>May I borrow Agent Quen for a while?

            <p>As for Agent Quen, normally I&#39;d give permission right away, but in this case, I didn&#39;t actually create the character. Agent Quen really belongs to NenyaQuende, who is no longer active. So, to make extra sure Quen&#39;s written well, if you would like to use Quen, please send me a first draft of your piece before you post it. (My e-mail is above.)<br><br>If you would like to know more about Quen&#39;s personality, you can check out her now-defunct livejournal <a href="http://agent_quen.livejournal.com/">here</a>.

            <p>It&#39;d probably be easier, actually, given that writing someone else&#39;s character means constantly checking oneself to make sure they stay in character. Your new character doesn&#39;t have to be frightening, either - it doesn&#39;t even have to be complex. You could make a joke out of it; have fun describing the secretary as being so unremarkable as to almost fade into the wall, or something like that. Throwaway characters are easy because you don&#39;t have to invest much in them.<br><br>Araeph may give you permission to borrow Quen anyway, but I think you&#39;re better off making your own.</p>

Permission to use your stuff?  Any feed back at all?</p>

            <p>I find that most people either a) have never heard of us, or b) think we&#39;re mean because they don&#39;t know us and believe we like to hurt innocent little authors&#39; feelings for fun (or C, which is A followed by B). So, I can&#39;t really see a radio show about us going over very well with random high schoolers.<br><br>What exactly did you have in mind, though? I&#39;m curious.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Newbie here. *tentatively waves*<br><br>I&#39;ve been informed by the Constitution (the PPC Board one, of course, not the sadly mistreated U.S. one) that I, quote: &quot;should post at least once to introduce themselves (and to receive a bumper sticker from the Official Bumper Sticker Giver or the Deputy Bumper Sticker Giver)&quot;<br><br>So, being an obedient little newbie, I am dutifully posting.<br><br>(Although I have no car, so I don&#39;t know where I would put a bumper sticker. I also have a tiny little dorm room and am fairly poor, so I don&#39;t know what I would do with anything resulting from, quote the PPC wiki: &quot;[The Boarders] also tend to try and give you things, if you prove a vulnerable target.&quot;)<br><br>Here&#39;s the shorter version of what became a VERY long post. And it&#39;s still very long. Apologies.<br><br>1) I have many internet names. On here, I shall go by Jacer.<br><br>2) I&#39;m a language nut. Spelling, grammar, punctuation.<br><br>3) I&#39;m a rabid Narnia CanonGirl. Books are canon. BBC!movieverse is canon. Lewis&#39; timeline is canon. New!movieverse is complete AU. See 4).<br><br>4) I (very) unhappily concede that for the purposes of the PPC, Narnia movieverse is a legitimate continuum, as is Twilight, and they must therefore be protected. That said, the PPC wiki&#39;s Twilight page is entirely accurate.<br><br>5) I am a member of the Pit since June 2009. I follow the Narnia, Bible, and Coraline archives closely. I greatly lament and bewail the trashing of the Narnia archive. Thanks EVER so much, Walden/Disney/Fox/Adamson/Apted.<br><br>6) Incest is wrong. Slash is wrong. BBC Narnia is VASTLY superior to the new ones. New!Susan and New!Caspian flirt a little and she kisses him, nothing more. Fangirls don&#39;t love Peter and Edmund and Caspian, they love William and Skandar and Ben. There ought to be a rule that an author&#39;s first five Narnia stories include NO OC romance, zip zilch nada.<br><br>7) You are welcome to disagree with me on any of the things mentioned in 6), and I usually won&#39;t bug you, but attempting to convert me on any of them will be entirely fruitless.<br><br>8) None of my OCs ever have or ever will become a love interest of anyone, especially canon characters.<br><br>9) I know better than to deny that some of my OCs are Sues. But I&#39;m doing my best to rework them.<br><br>10) I&#39;ve gotten one of my friends interested in the PPC. While this would normally not be a bad thing, what with always needing recruits and all, she has a lot of ideas that don&#39;t really fit with established PPC canon. Also, we&#39;ve both gone over the top with making up agents, and I&#39;ve realized we need to pick two or three and keep it at that. I am NOT looking forward to telling her this....oh, and did I mention that she&#39;s a Twihard?<br><br>11) I currently have a whole bunch of &quot;agents&quot; that do PPC-inspired prose MSTing. I call them &quot;the Motley Band&quot;. Most of them are my OCs, because it&#39;s fun to imagine how they&#39;d would react to badfic in their home continuum.<br><br>12) If I ever request permission to write missions, rest assured that I will have a reasonable number of agents (two or three, most likely), as opposed to the Motley Band.<br><br>13) The PPC wiki is, in the words of AVPM, &quot;totally awesome.&quot;<br><br>14) Please don&#39;t kill me for the ridiculously long post.<br><br>Bye!</p>

            <p>...Ah, that&#39;s the other reason your name is ringing little gongs in my head. Jacer goes to both Jace, a Stu in my sister&#39;s guilty pleasure novels, City of Ash and their ilk, and Jacer + Narnia + Christianity rings bells of Agent Jaster, who used to hang around here, and whose C. S. Lewis icon reminds me a great deal of 6). I&#39;ll have to look it up at some point. <br><br>You seem nice, and I look forward to seeing you around here, and hopefully the IRC as well!<br><br>A few things, though: <br>We don&#39;t do Bible fic here-- when it was discovered, there was something of a shockwave, and the general decision was No, we don&#39;t even want to Go There. I dunno if opinion has changed since then, but... I&#39;m still in the place where Bible fic is just so much Do Not Want.<br>Secondly, um. On the slash thing. I would love to discuss this with you, but here does not seem like a good place. There are links and things that kind of explain my position on slash, and... well, non-heterosexuality in general, as a <s>bisexual</s> Christian. <br>Thirdly: Coraline! You&#39;re a Neil Gaiman fan? Have you read his other stuff-- or his blog? Are you in any other of his fandoms?<br><br>At any rate! Have a spork and a towel, two things a PPCer should never be without! See you around!</p>

            <p>And here I thought &quot;Jacer&quot; was an unusual handle. Well, at least it&#39;s an acronym.<br><br>Regarding Bible fic: L&#39;homme_Arbre taught me a French phrase. I shall use it here: Don&#39;t worry. I have no plans of PPCing Bible fic. It&#39;s just too...je ne sais quoi. I only mentioned it because it&#39;s one of the fandoms I follow.<br><br>Regarding Neil Gaiman: GOOD. OMENS. IS. AWESOME. I only check it rarely though, because Narnia takes up most of my fic-time. Sadly I have not read any of the other books he&#39;s written.<br><br>Regarding slash: Not to seem rude, but...I would rather not discuss slash. I can get defensive and somewhat vitriolic when my faith is involved in <i>any</i> discussion, and it would be impossible to keep it out of this one. Please note that I have absolutely no problem with the people, just the relationships.<br><br>Random thought: Why haven&#39;t spellcheckers learned that &quot;fandom&quot; is a word yet?

            <p>Just throws my brain for a bit of a loop. I only remarked on it because Jace is such a terrible Stu, and Jaster is such an awesome guy. The juxtaposition was a little odd.<br><br>That&#39;s good, then. The first/last time Bible fanfic was brought up here, as an aside, was a YHWH/OC monstrosity. That was enough to sour me on the entire fandom.<br><br>Good Omens is awesome! I heartily recommend the rest of his stuff, as well-- his short story anthologies are pure, distilled awesome. (Protip: <i>always</i> read the introductions on his anthologies.)<br><br>Regarding slash: Fair enough. I definitely sympathise, I&#39;ve been involved in plenty of discussions on faith that turned ugly. I will leave the topic alone. Do I correctly assume you&#39;re Christian?<br><br>Heh.

            <p>See, I can&#39;t read Biblical fanfic. I... can&#39;t. Maybe it&#39;s a failing on my part, but I really just can&#39;t stretch my mind  that far. To me, Bible is in one category, and literature is in another, and fanfic goes with literature. *shrug* Just a personal... thing.<br><br>Catholic? Interesting.

            <p>But of course! AVPM and AVPS are made of awesome! (and Red Vines. That goes without saying.)<br><br>Technically, Bible fic should be based on events in the Bible. Duh. Stories of background characters, expansions, the like, done with respect for the Bible.<br><br>However, from my experience, a lamentable chunk of the Bible archive is parody/mockery. Another chunk is fics that the authors obviously take seriously, but are either unfinished or aren&#39;t <i>really</i> fanfic (being just about Christianity in general). And then there are the good ones, which are much harder to find. If you want to troll through it, I would suggest setting the filter to &quot;complete&quot;.<br><br>Whee! Hat, cat, rat.

            <p>For one thing, there&#39;s no such thing as &#39;canon slash&#39;. Slash is a type of fanfic, a noncanonical, generally explicit, romance between two canon characters. It&#39;s called slash because it&#39;s generally tagged with a note that says &#39;Character A/Character B&#39; to indicate who is being slashed. Slash generally but not exclusively refers to a m/m pairing. Femslash is f/f, and het (not hetslash, just het) is the traditional m/f. Please note that explicit &#39;romance&#39; between a canon and an OC is not any sort of slash; it has to be between two canon characters for it to count. There are other subtleties, but I am too lazy to list them all.<br><br>However, if the part you object to is simply the whole m/m or f/f pairing in the first place, this explanation has done absolutely nothing to change your mind. But that&#39;s okay, because the point of this is to explain slash in greater detail, not change your opinion on anything. Others can, and will do that for me...<br><br>P.S. I am sensing from some of your previous responses to various people that you&#39;re thinking of putting agents into the DMS. That&#39;s all well and good, but have you considered all your options? Specifically, I&#39;m thinking of the DBS. You could be great, you know...It&#39;s all here in your head...heh heh heh... <sup>___^</sup></p>

            <p>To quote the first line of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Slash">our article</a> on the subject, &quot;Slash refers to romance and/or sex between two characters of the same gender.&quot;<br><br>Whether canonical same-gender pairings are slash is debatable in the same way as the question of whether canon characters can be Sues, I guess, but how is &quot;male canon/male OC&quot; not slash? I&#39;m pretty sure it counts, at least the way we use the term around here.<br><br>And, regarding the last part of your post, I refer to Trojie&#39;s <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Slash-Sporking_Guide">Slash-Sporking Guide</a>:<br><blockquote>If you don&#39;t like slash, I&#39;m sorry, but this is not the department  for you. My advice, although of course you don&#39;t have to take it, would be to not even go for Floaters. Be a freelance Assassin or something. But if you&#39;re going to be constantly distracted in a mission by the simple fact that you don&#39;t agree with who&#39;s sleeping with who, then you probably won&#39;t get the best and the most fun out of your sporking. And it should be fun. Don&#39;t you agree?</blockquote>
<br>In a nutshell: people who don&#39;t like slash shouldn&#39;t be in the DBS, because they won&#39;t have fun.<br><br>Just so we&#39;re clear. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>And they&#39;ve been in a basement or garage for lots of years now, so I have no idea if they still work. I hope so, though.<br><br>I haven&#39;t seen the new <i>Dawn Treader</i> yet, so I can&#39;t speak to that. (Did they REALLY make the mist of the Island Where Dreams Come True into some kind of Big Bad? O.o) I DID really like the new LWW, but was not overwhelmingly impressed by <i>Prince Caspian</i>. There are times when I can&#39;t even remember if I&#39;ve seen it or not, so there you go. The old one just left a much greater impression on me.<br><br>And yeah, Peter in the Wonderworks version is completely awesome. It&#39;s too bad he only got to be in two of them.<br><br>I&#39;m worried about <i>The Silver Chair</i>. I think it&#39;s my favorite apart from LWW of the old movies, and I just don&#39;t know how on earth it could be possible to best Tom Baker as Puddleglum. I mean, really. Tom frelling Baker. o.o<br><br>... Anyway, yeah! I&#39;m not even as big a Narnia fan as I am of other things (LotR is where my true diehard geekery appears; the movies make me want to strangle things because they COULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT if PJ hadn&#39;t been all STUPID and CHANGED things), but some things, like story over effects, bear speaking out. In the case of BBC Narnia, the key is to treat it like a stage play. Do that, and you&#39;ll find it is made of win, I think.<br><br><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/7l47a7mggf">For your listening pleasure.</a><br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

I guess I don&#39;t have a huge beef with the movies--HEAR ME OUT!--simply because I feel that they get Tolkien&#39;s story across fairly well.

Susan the Logical, anyone? Peter the Jerk? Jadis the Blonde? The non-existent Fox and river/wolf confrontation?

            <p>Do the LotR movies get the story across, that is. I mean, maybe, in a very broad sense, but so much of the intricacy and subtlety went completely out the window, along with Frodo&#39;s character. The Frodo in the books is wise and kind and competent, if frightened and slowly being dragged down by the Ring. The Frodo in the movies almost ruined everything by lying to Faramir and sending Sam home. He turns into this unsympathetic little jerk! *tears hair* I THINK they were trying to play up the power of the Ring, but it just makes him look bad. I mean, the Quest only succeeds because of Frodo&#39;s inner strength and his strong friendship that literally holds him up when he can&#39;t stand anymore. In the movies, it only succeeds because Sam is a better person than he is. What&#39;s the message there?<br><br>*deeeep breath...*<br><br>Hokay. So. I have to say the reason the movies really grind my gears is that the casting, the music, the scenery, the costumes... EVERYTHING is right except the characters. It looks like Middle-earth, sounds like it, feels like it... but the people aren&#39;t themselves, and there&#39;s no good reason for it, and that kills me. Idiot!Treebeard, anyone? Flaming!Denethor? Angsty!Aragorn? Jackass!Elrond? MPD!Gollum? Comic Relief!Gimli? Captain Obvious!Legolas? Elves at Helm&#39;s Deep? I mean, if you&#39;re going to have Elves symbolically show up to help the Men after all, why not do it at the Battle at the Pelennor Fields, or before the Black Gate? That would be so much more powerful than the pointless slaughter we got--which, by the way, would have left Lothlorien underdefended against the force attacking it at the time. So the movies have kissed Lothlorien goodbye and left it to burn, and gained nothing by the change. Thanks a lot, movies.<br><br>...<br><br>&#39;Kay, I&#39;m gonna stop talking about this. <sup>_<sup>;<br><br>I</sup></sup> probably WILL see DT, because my morbid curiosity demands it. I&#39;ll try to keep my expectations low. Thanks for the warning. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>My agents have been punished for not waiting to gather all charges and &quot;borrowing&quot; a car from a canon character on a rather nasty fic. (My last one, released a few days ago)<br>Today, tooling around with Flight Simulator 2004, I also made a PPC paint scheme for the F-14A (This will be the exact plane my Agents will try not to getting shot dow in):<br><img src="http://img31.imageshack.us/img31/8134/ppcf14.png" alt="http://img31.imageshack.us/img31/8134/ppcf14.png"><br>Rumors of this being Blaze&#39;s F-14A are around, but there is no proof. (Yes, I downloaded the Razgriz paint scheme and modified it.)<br><br>Another AC crossover I already mentioned a while ago, an AC/HP one too, tried to smash together our world and Strangereal. Azkaban in Belka, for example. Not counting a rather Sueish Ace!Hermione with a mind-bending F/A-27 Ravenclaw supposed to be the uncanonical production version of the XFA-27, but has four engines as the YR-302 Fregata, the only four-engined fighter in AC canon.<br>I&#39;m keeping an eye on it, for now it doesn&#39;t have badfic status.</p>

            <p>I love the design, great job! Good call on the Razgriz paint scheme, those guys were the best. I love to replay the Air base defense mission a lot, just because of the epic scale of it, and the Arc Bird&#39;s part. I hope your agents have some flight experience, jets are pretty complicated.<br><br>Now I&#39;m going to have to look  for some Ac5 badfic (as it is the only one I have extensive knowledge of). If that other fic ever goes into badfic territory, make sure to grab the uncanon plane, it would be a good trophy, or yo could sell it.</p>

            <p>I wanted to share these with everyone, as they are some of my favorite AU fics of all time. They&#39;re for the <i>Criminal Minds</i> fandom, but you don&#39;t have to know much of anything about the fandom beyond the fact that the main characters are FBI agents who solve crimes by figuring out what makes people tick psychologically. <br><br>This AU is a very cool supernatural-based &#39;Verse with vampires, werewolves, faeries, and a whole lot of other things that go bump in the night, not to mention some seriously awesome world-building. There are three stories so far, and all of them are long and plotty.<br><br>The first two are complete stories, while the third is on temporary hiatus for various reasons.<br><br>The stories in chronological order:<br><br>1) <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5202897/1/Power_Play">Power Play</a><br><br><b>Summary:</b> Tensions are running high when a vampire joins the BAU, but all differences must be put aside as the team investigate a series of suspicious werewolf murders.<br><br>2) <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5453405/1/The_Clockwork_Boy">The Clockwork Boy</a><br><br><b>Summary:</b> Reid finds himself teaming up with his kidnappers to determine the nature of his origins. Meanwhile, the team are split between searching for their agent and investigating a new and twisted case.<br><br>3) <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6277465/1/These_Endless_Days">These Endless Days</a><br><br><b>Summary:</b> Emily returns to her mother, while the team prepare to face off against the vampire Matriarch. The balance of power hangs on a knife&#39;s edge, and nothing is as it seems.</p>

            <pre><code>  Hey, semi-lurker here, and I have a quick question.&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m kind-of a prolific fanfic reader, and a while back I cam across the worst Kim Possible badfic I&#39;ve ever read.  Normally, KiGo shipping is a bit of a guilty pleasure, but this one is seriously bad.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      I was wondering if the board could vote on whether I should report it, or whether it would be okay for me to hold on to it, I do eventually plan to write a pair of agents, and I&#39;d love to send them through it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      By the way, for those interested, tags for the story are: BDSM, Character Death, Harem, Incest, Lemon, Rape, Violence, Evil!Super!Kim, and Gore.  The pairings, by the way, are Kim/Shego/Ann.  Yes, that is a three way slash between Kim, her mother, and her nemesis.  Later, it degenerates into everyone/everything.

            <p>Just put it on the Claimed Badfic list on the wiki so nobody else takes it in the meantime. You can claim fics before getting Permission.<br><br>For everyone&#39;s information, we do sometimes perform housekeeping on those lists, so if something sits there long enough (a year or more, especially if the claimer hasn&#39;t been active in that time), it may be taken off the Claimed list and put on the Unclaimed list. If the link to the fic is broken, though, it will be removed entirely, since no one can spork a fic that&#39;s been deleted. So, if you&#39;re going to do it, don&#39;t wait that long. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>...that you add it to the Claimed Badfic list, because many people without permission request want to keep an specific fic for themselves, and don&#39;t want to worry about it being sporked by someone else.

            <p>...I don&#39;t really like to pass judgement on a fi...il I&#39;ve read it myself. From what you&#39;ve told me, it sounds like there&#39;s enough citrus in that fic to set up a lemonade stand, if that&#39;s your idea of a good time, but still seeing it would be nice. I mean, something can be distasteful, and you may not like it, but if it&#39;s written well (and yes, I have seen some well-written rapefic, although I still didn&#39;t like it) then we should really (in my opinion, anyway) leave it be. <br><br>As for the moral quandary...Well, in my humble opinion, you&#39;re asking yourself the wrong question. It isn&#39;t &#39;Should I report this or not&#39;, it&#39;s &#39;Should I put this in Unclaimed Badfic, or in Claimed with my name on it?&#39; The answer to that, I belive, isn&#39;t in a popular vote, but in your own commitment to the PPC. Is, for example, this plan a defined goal for you, you&#39;re going to do x, y, and z and you&#39;ll have permission and a pair of agents ready to go, or is it one of those sort of nebulous, i&#39;ll-do-it-sometime sort of plan? Answer that, and I think you&#39;ll have your answer.<br><br>Well, that&#39;s my two paragraphs worth of cents. Maybe all that helped, maybe it just confuses you more. Either way, my work is done here.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think you have to hold a vote to get it assigned. All you would have to do is put it on the wiki in the Unclaimed badfic section.

            <p>I would like to be given permission (Not Permission, just permission) to give the Marquis a personal assistant. I&#39;m not thinking of him/her/it becoming a major character or anything, but if I could fit them in, it would make the Permission piece I&#39;m thinking of a lot easier...<br><br>Now, I was thinking of making a cyborg. I&#39;m not talking Terminator here, more along the lines of Lobot. (<a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lobot"><a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lobot">http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lobot</a></a> for those of you who&#39;ve never heard of him.) My reasoning is that, though the Marquis really does need a computer to play matchmaker for the hundreds-strong throng of Agents subject to his every whim, he&#39;s still a little too haughty and old-fashioned to learn how to use one. Since he uses telepathy instead of talking, system that uses voice-commands is logically out of the question. Enter our Lobotic look-alike. It&#39;s enough robot to run computer functions and keep the agent database in its head, but still enough human to be communicated with telepathically. <br><br>Additionally, he might be sort of a confidant. The Marquis is the sort of man...<i>plant</i>, rather, whose idea of asking for advice is getting someone to listen to him talk...<i>think</i>, rather, about himself (Apologies to Mr. Pratchett, holy horns, etc, etc). That sort of cyborg would be perfect. It&#39;s enough human to look interested and answer his rhetorical questions, but still sufficiently cybernetic to keep the whole vexed question of &#39;Is he doing this to me on purpose&#39; from the Agents. <br><br>I&#39;m also thinking of adding some glitches, to keep up the fight on the humor front. You know, the classics - skipping and getting stuck like a broken record, the ol&#39; neck-snapping nervous twitch, stuff like that. <br><br>I appreciate all feedback; approval, disapproval, additional or alternate ideas (a name would be nice, my mind&#39;s blank at the moment), the (slightly unwelcome, at this point) news that the Marquis already <i>has</i> an assistant, and that I&#39;ve been wasting my time...All that good stuff.<br><br>Well, that makes it six paragraphs, including this one, and I think that covers everything, so...Au revoir, y&#39;all. </p>

            <p>Naruto is practically infamous for having overpowered characters with over-the-top angsty pasts--I think I described it once as being something like a picture of a rape-murder scene painted in bright blocks of primary colors--but canon sues are rare (ymmv, of course) due to the time that is given to develop each character and make them sympathetic.<br><br>That said, Ayame is waaaaay past what would be appropriate, even for Naruto canon. And, as Neshomeh said, deities aren&#39;t a big part of Naruto canon anyway; having a character who is one (or is related to one) would be out of place.<br><br>If a story gets written and somebody wants to PPC it, I&#39;d be glad to act as canon-consultant for the Naruto universe. <sup>^</sup></p>

When she saw her husband u she miled and said, &quot;Good morning Spyro.&quot;</i> &#39;<br><br>This is a small sample, but none of these are explainable by that he&#39;s shaky with the language... later, he uses colloquialisms (&quot;bring it ya old fart&quot;) and can spell the words &#39;uppercut&#39; and &#39;insignia.&#39;</p>

            <p>You were not kidding. This is going to be one messed-up fic, isn&#39;t it. Generally, any fic with a first chapter that does nothing but painstakingly detail the original character the author is introducing screams &#39;SUE&#39;, but this one...Ugh. Allow me to highlight the most erroneous tip-offs;<br><br>1. Eyes: as storm shadow&#39;s eyes but a feminization style and larger. <br><br>2. Height: 1 m and 55 cm<br><br>3. Mass: 45 kg<br><br>(Note: According to the Heart, Lung, and Blood Association, that&#39;s a body mass index of 18, or &#39;dangerously underweight&#39;. This say anything to you?) <br><br>4. her real element is ice but <b>she controls all the elements cause she is the goddess of elemental powers</b>.<br><br>5. Ayame is sixteen years old. She has a bloody and sad past. She has a super natural power, and had a ying seal on her right arm, she had it since she was born or u can say <b>since her mother was pregnant of her and her twin brothers and sister.</b><br><br>It isn&#39;t finished, and I haven&#39;t gotten Permission yet, but can I volunteer to take this? I don&#39;t know much about GI Joe or Naruto, but I do know a thing or two about good writing, and this is not it...</p>

            <p>I have a couple ideas for agents.<br><br>The obligatory &quot;Look, Ma, I&#39;m a PPC Agent!&quot; would probably work best as just out of basic training.  My other idea is a UNIT soldier (no higher in rank than Sergeant, and I&#39;d prefer Corporal or Private) who was a bit character in a Doctor Who badfic and recruited by the agents who dealt with it.  That one could be written as either experienced or newbie.  The problem is, I can&#39;t find a fic for the character to be recruited from.  There has to be Third Doctor/early Fourth Doctor badfic out there, but most of the writers seem to be concentrating on Nine through Eleven.<br><br>If you want to discuss this privately, I&#39;m gamingkitty on LiveJournal and @Antigone68104 on Twitter.</p>

            <p>...Simply wonderful. This is what fanfic, to me, is about.

            <p>This is one of those amazing threads where one can influence the entertainment choices of their fellow humans. I am fast running out of Stephen King novels to read, and am looking for stuff to read once I&#39;ve finished off his writings. <br><br>No, I have not read any Discworld novels, and though I would like to, my local library system has exactly one (The Colour of Magic) which I promise I will read eventually.<br><br>I am incredibly open to suggestions. I&#39;ve even read and enjoyed terrible books like Twilight and Eragon, only in hindsight realizing how bad they are. The point is, I&#39;ll likely enjoy anything recommended to me.</p>

            <p>Brent Week&#39;s Night Angel trilogy is pretty great, though he gets a few of the weapon descriptions wrong. (Though I&#39;m apparently the only one I know who&#39;s noticed that.)<br><br>In a similar vein are Steven Brust&#39;s Vlad Taltos novels. They can be read one of two ways: You can start with Jhereg, and read them in publication order, or you can start with Taltos and read them in chronological order. The series makes sense either way.<br><br>Also recommended if you like fantasy is Jim Butcher&#39;s Codex Alera series.<br><br>Alternatively, if you&#39;re more of a Sci-Fi fan, Spider Robinson is a must, especially his Callahan&#39;s Cross-Time Saloon series. Incidentally, if you find The Callahan Touch, Callahan&#39;s Legacy, and/or The Free Lunch, will you let me know where yo found them? Those are the only three I&#39;ve not read yet.</p>

            <p>If you enjoyed the Hunger Games, I recommend Battle Royale, a Japanese novel that the Hunger Games obviously drew a lot of inspiration from. It&#39;s been translated into English multiple times now, and is a great read, if a little dark.</p>

            <p>Some of my favorites have been mentioned already, but here are a couple I haven&#39;t seen yet:<br><br>1. Anything by Charles de Lint, who writes fantastic urban fantasy short stories and novels. His stuff is interesting because it&#39;s all set in the same world, and sometimes different stories share characters, but it&#39;s not necessary to read anything in order. It&#39;s all one big tapestry you can move over as you will.<br><br>2. The Temeraire series by Naomi Novik. It&#39;s set during the Napoleonic wars, but with dragons. Each dragon has a captain he imprints on at hatching (similar to Pern, yes, but without the telepathy or any guarantee that the pairing will be a healthy one), and when they are big and well-trained enough, they and their captain and crew fight in Britain&#39;s (or whichever country&#39;s) Aerial Corps. The dragons are intelligent and can speak, but the level of intelligence varies by breed and individual.<br><br>I&#39;ll also second the recommendation for the Death Gate Cycle. I&#39;m not a huge fan of the authors&#39; better-known Dragonlance series, but they really did well with DGC. It&#39;s much more their own creation; far and away less derivative of the basic D&amp;D scenario, though some familiar races may appear. Well, sort of. You&#39;d have to see for yourself. *g*<br><br>~Neshomeh<br></p>

            <p>For straight fantasy, I usually turn to Garth Nix&#39;s <i>Old Kingdom</i> Trilogy. The books (<i>Sabriel</i>, <i>Lirael</i>, and <i>Abhorsen</i>) are a great read. Also, the &quot;Age of Fire&quot; series by E.E. Knight are fantastic. The main characters are dragons, and the world-building is often times breathtaking.<br><br>I&#39;m a big reader of what would be considered &quot;urban fantasy&quot;, and highly recommend the Kitty Norville series by Carrie Vaughn, as well as the Mercy Thompson and Alpha and Omega series by Patricia Briggs. If you like well-written novels about werewolves, vampires, and how they would interact in our modern-day world, you&#39;ll love these.<br><br>If you like a little steampunk with your fantasy, read &quot;The Parasol Protectorate&quot; series by Gail Carriger. They&#39;re fast paced, a great read, and fun to boot. I mean, how can you not like a vibrant and engaging protagonist whose main weapon is a brass-tipped parasol?</p>

            <p>Well, I pretty much recommend anything by Neil Gaiman. Tamora Pierce, too; just make sure you read the different series in order, otherwise it won&#39;t make as much sense. (Chronological order of the sets are the Song of the Lioness quartet, The Immortals Quartet, the Protector of the Small quartet, and Daughter of the Lioness, which is just two books. She&#39;s also still writing another series in the same universe, the Beka Cooper series, which is sort of a prequel series to the others.<br><br>On principle, I also must recommend the Redwall series, the Artemis Fowl series, and Lloyd Alexander&#39;s Prydain Chronicles.  There&#39;s also a book series by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, called the Death Gate Cycle, which is rather good. I&#39;m still in the middle of reading it myself.<br><br>You&#39;ll notice a pattern here. I practically never read anything that&#39;s not fantasy.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a really awesome but not very well-known series by.. *checks* Gayle Greeno. The first book, and admittedly the only one I have read so far, although the other two are waiting for me at home, is called <em>Finders Seekers.</em> It&#39;s kind of sci-fi disguised as fantasy, a bit like Dragonriders of Pern. <br><br>And it has giant telepathic cats! </p>

            <p>I read the series several years ago, so my memories aren&#39;t very clear, but I enjoyed it, and the sequels, too. It&#39;s good stuff.<br><br>I wonder if you&#39;ve also heard of Irene Radford&#39;s &quot;Dragon Nimbus&quot; series. They&#39;re another sci-fi-as-fantasy type set-up, though it&#39;s mostly fantasy in the early novels. The sci-fi comes more into play in the later &quot;Stargods&quot; series. There are dragons (Her Dragons Are Different), flying cats, and magic. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re the best books ever, but they&#39;re certainly fun (and badfic-free, since the author forbids it).<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Full of swears and horrifying acts of violence, but if you read Stephen King that shouldn&#39;t bother you. I don&#39;t think I can adequately describe why I like his stuff, but he&#39;s my current favourite.</p>

            <p>I like pretty much anything written by Anne McCaffrey. Her Pern series is always a good bet and there are, I&#39;m pretty sure, more than thirty books in that one series alone, so it will keep you busy for a while.<br><br>I like Xanth novels by Pierce Anthony. They have a sort of plot thread that tenuously winds through all of them, but the way they are written really does not require you to read them in order.<br><br>I liked the first few novels in the A Wizard In Rhyme series by Christopher Stasheff, but it jumps the shark after about the 4th or 5th one. <br><br>There is the Han Solo Trilogy and the Corellian Trilogy and the X-Wing Series that are all very good in Star Wars without really requiring you to invest heavily in the Extended Universe.  <br><br>Oh! I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t think to mention this one sooner.  Wen Spencer. Amazing writer. I read her Ukiah Oregon series (Hmm, I don&#39;t think I can sum this one up quickly other than AWESOME!) and instantly fell in love. She has two other series one starts with Tinker (urban fantasy with Elves, mechanics, and much more!) and and the other one starts with A Brother&#39;s Price (kind of dystopian future). I haven&#39;t the last two, but I&#39;ve heard enough discussion of them and seen enough excerpts to know that they will also be very good when I do get around to them.<br><br>I liked Tom Clancy&#39;s Jack Ryan series. I haven&#39;t had time to read them lately. They are too long to read in a day or two with my kids running around distracting me. They are wonderfully complicated books.<br><br>The Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Very good and after you read them you can watch the Granada TV series of them. :)<br><br>Artemis Fowl is good, up until the last book.<br><br>Then there are stand-alones and classics. Watership Down; The Children of The New Forest; (not a stand alone, but I&#39;ve never read the rest)--A Wrinkle in Time; The Ear, The Eye and The Arm (One of my all time favorites); The Iceberg Hermit; Carry on Mr. Bowditch</p>

            <p>I have read all the Star Wars books you have recomended. As a matter of fact, the first &quot;adult&quot; Star Wars novels I ever read were the Han Solo Trilogy. Awesome Books<br><br>Ann McCafferty- I&#39;ve read some of her stuff, but the only one that really grabbed me was &quot;The City Who Fought.&quot; And that was Co-Authored.<br><br>Tom Clancy has the same problem as Stephen King. Other than &quot;Cardinal in the Kremlin,&quot; &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; and whatever he&#39;s come out with since &quot;Teeth of the Tiger,&quot; I&#39;ve read (and enjoyed-mostly) all of his stuff. Still, now you&#39;ve reminded me to getting around to finishing him up too.<br><br>Artemis Fowl-I&#39;m now three books behind on him. Good reminder.<br><br>I&#39;ve also read &quot;A Wrinkle in Time,&quot; and &quot;The Ear the Eye and the Arm.&quot; Three times. It was my favorite stand-alone book in sixth grade.<br><br>That&#39;s less than half of the stuff on this list. Thanks for putting your time into this. I have a lot to read now.</p>

            <p><i>Snow Crash</i>, by Neal Stephenson is a great read - Douglas Adams meets William Gibson. The rest of Stephenson&#39;s stuff is also quite good, if you&#39;re a math nerd.<br><br>Now that I&#39;ve already mentioned him, William Gibson does good stuff. It&#39;s a lot more heavy philosophy than Stephenson&#39;s more approachable works.<br><br>Yet another author I really enjoy is Jim Butcher - the Dresden Files are great noir urban fantasy.<br><br>As far as sci-fi goes, Kim Stanley Robinson&#39;s <i>Red Mars, Green Mars,</i> and <i>Blue Mars</i> are rather epic. Stephenson also wrote some sci-fi, <i>The Diamond Age</i> is definitely worth reading. Louis McMaster Bujold&#39;s Vorkosigan Saga is also rather awesome, and available for free (legally!) <a href="http://baencd.thefifthimperium.com/24-CryoburnCD/CryoburnCD/">here</a>.<br><br>On the fantastic side, I&#39;m a fan of Mercedes Lackey. She can be hit or miss at times, but she writes incredible characters. I&#39;d suggest staying away from the Phoenix series, as they&#39;re on the miss side of the picture.</p>

            <p>If you read nothing else of his, read William Gibson&#39;s <i>Neuromancer</i>. It is practically THE seminal work for all other cyberpunk fiction. It is a bit dense at times, but you won&#39;t regret it.<br><br>If you&#39;re feeling more in a steam mood, check out Gibson and Sterling&#39;s <i>The Difference Engine.</i> It was the novel that established Steampunk as a genre rather than a theme that kind of cropped up from time to time since the 1950s.</p>

            <p>Hello.  This is a Permission Request and...I can&#39;t think of anything else to say here.  So on with it.<br><br>The writing sample: <a href="http://doctorlit.webs.com/resources.htm"><a href="http://doctorlit.webs.com/resources.htm">http://doctorlit.webs.com/resources.htm</a></a><br><br>The first target: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5169779/2/My_own_match"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5169779/2/My_own_match">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5169779/2/My_own_match</a></a><br><br>RC Request: 251<br><br>The Agents:<br>--Agent Doc<br>Department: Floaters<br>Partner: Agent Vania<br>Home Continuum: World One<br>Species: Human<br>Gender: Male<br>Age: 23<br>Appearance: Doc isn’t particularly muscular, but he isn’t lean either.  He stands at 5’8” and needs glasses for shortsightedness.  He has green-blue eyes and brown hair cut close to his scalp.  He always wears cargo shorts with big pockets (often containing at least one book) and a polo shirt with a pencil in the pocket.<br>Personality: While Doc is willing to chat with people and be friendly with them when he has to, he would much prefer to stay in his RC and get as much reading done as he can between missions.  He is almost always reading, even when walking around.  He still pays attention to his surroundings, however, and won’t put himself in danger or unintentionally ignore someone while reading.  He will put away his book in a moment of danger or when he needs to concentrate.  Extremely over-defensive of his always-growing collection of novels (which he occasionally refers to as His Precious), there is little anyone can do to upset Doc more than handle them without asking first.  Doc has a huge turnover rate for reading books, so while he is familiar with numerous fandoms, he doesn’t necessarily know them as well as an agent who works continuously in one or a few fandoms.  Doc also has a bad habit of underestimating Mary Sues; his assumption that they can be beat into submission with a few whacks on the head, coupled with his complete lack of combat experience, often leaves him vulnerable when threatened by Warrior!Sues or other potentially dangerous varieties.<br>Weapons: A three-foot metal pole; occasionally, a nice, heavy doorstopper of a book<br>Fandoms: Various literary continua<br>Likes: books, cool villains, cold weather, feeling accomplished<br>Dislikes: Bad Slash and Bad Het, villain sex, interspecies romance, fire, water, silverfish<br>--Agent Vania Tolluk<br>Department: Floaters<br>Partner: Agent Doc<br>Home Continuum: unknown<br>Species: Human<br>Gender: Female<br>Age: 20<br>Appearance: Vania is skinny, standing at 5’3” with short arms.  She has light blue eyes and black hair in a ponytail.  She wears black and white pinstripe pants and a double-breasted business jacket.<br>Personality: Vania is curious and impulsive, ready and willing to try new things at the drop of a hat.  She likes meeting new people, and can comfortably talk with anyone she’s just met; however, she doesn’t tend to form close friendships easily.  She sometimes fails to think about how her behavior might be received by others, and Vania can often be caught singing in public, or just staring at a wall thinking to herself.  When Vania becomes intrigued by a new fandom, she will devour any available source materials in short order, quickly catching up to speed on all facets of the ‘verse.  She mainly focuses on movies and video games, but is picky about which ones she really likes, based on their stories.  She is a more diverse fighter than Doc, being familiar with weapons and items from numerous video game continua, although she only excels with a few.  She prefers a straightforward execution of Sues, and will avoid directly fighting them whenever possible.<br>Weapons: A wide selection of items from various video game continua, her favorites being a baseball Home-Run bat and a Needler; also has a hodge-podge of healing items which are left behind in the RC more often than not.<br>Fandoms: Lost, Heroes, Broadway musicals, Mel Brooks movies, role-playing games, Halo, Portal<br>Likes: boss battles, Freddy Krueger, music, being around people, milk, cats, birds<br>Dislikes: boredom, being alone<br></p>

            <p>The Wiki says to comment on Araeph&#39;s RC list to have my agents added to it, but it won&#39;t let me leave a comment without a Live Journal account.  Is there some other way to go about securing my RC?</p>

            <p>I agree with the others: the story is very good. I like that you took your time building it up, so that even though it&#39;s a short piece, it doesn&#39;t seem rushed.

            <p>I did quite enjoy reading about these two. :3 The running thing about Boston getting lobbed into stuff looks like it could be highly amusing in future, and Az&#39;s bipolar attitude will /definitely/ be highly amusing in future.

            <p>Hey guys!<br><br>Lately, I have been on a big kick trying to tidy up the PPC wiki! Caddy-Shack, PoorCynic, KGarrett, Doctorlit, and others have done a lot of good work on the wiki as well, but there are many, many marked and unmarked stubs that still can use work! There are also a vast amount of agent and slain Sue stubs that I can&#39;t expand or detail any further because they aren&#39;t my agents or missions.<br><br>I&#39;m just posting to promote awareness of the wiki, and if anybody here wants to put in a little time in, editing the wiki is easy and fun. <br><br>Find a stub or create a new page, and try and match it to an existing completed page for format and clarity purposes. Just, please don&#39;t make more stubs-- especially for your agents. <br><br>... So yeah! Boarders old and new, if you act know, the wiki will become prettier with your contributions!<br><br>Yaaaay!</p>

            <p>I would like to clarify. July, of all people, knows the usefulness of the Wiki. She was the one who started it, if I recall! But, like last time when someone brought up reading the tutorials as an alternative to reading the actual missions, there&#39;s no real True Answer. Both are important. I happen to agree with July that anyone who wants to write a PPC spin-off should probably be interested enough to read spin-offs, rather than just reading <i>about</i> them. I happen to also agree that tutorials are useful-- for me, reading the Original Series was enough to get me into the organization, and reading the spin-offs was enough to probably write one of my own <s>eventually</s>.<br><br>But a lot of people learn different ways, and having someone explain How To Do It is quite helpful for many. For example, grammar. Some people are avid readers, but have trouble following the rules when they write, and a tab on the side with common grammatical issues is helpful to them. <br><br>BOTH ARE GOOD.<br><br>Reading the Wiki is no substitute for reading missions, and for myself, it&#39;s most useful for keeping all the useful links in one place and relatively organized. For some people, it is a staple that they could not imagine the PPC without.<br><br>No matter what you use it for, Aster is right! Organizational efforts should be, and are, applauded! Yay, Team Wiki!</p>

            <p>Reading and writing the wiki are no substitutes for reading and writing missions.<br><br>But it is an opportunity to put in backstory, analysis, and other PPC-related thoughts into PPC &#39;canon.&#39;<br><br>Missions are about the badfic, not the agents. They may banter, but many agents have their own backstories and their own aspirations-- things that we don&#39;t really have time to see in the course of a mission text. This can all be said on the wiki; people can find it and learn more if they want to.<br><br>Many canons have badfic quirks -- the 10th Walker phenomenon on LotR for instance, or the presence of uncanon vampires and werewolves. These can be discussed, analyzed, and explored on the wiki in ways that would detract from a mission narrative.<br><br>Terms like urple, Flower, mini... these are all PPC-exclusive terms and should be detailed, and people add their own terms all the time. It&#39;s right that we keep track of it all.<br><br>Reading and writing the wiki is SUPPLEMENTAL material. Making sure it&#39;s complete is no different from making sure the manual that goes with a video game has all of the information in it. It&#39;s a wiki. A variation of wikipedia. An encyclopedia. It&#39;s got information in it, and is not just a great switchboard directory of missions and homepages.<br><br>I feel the Wiki contains important information to PPC canon and in this canon written by many people, it is only fair that there be a certain amount of unity. The wiki can provide that, if the articles are complete, up to standard, and are able to be read enjoyably.<br><br>Reading the wiki and exploring everything the PPC has done thus far has brought me a lot of fun. But it could be even better!<br><br>So yes-- go, Team Wiki! Go!</p>

            <p>For all the stuff you specifically mentioned, heck yeah.<br><br>However, let&#39;s also remember that there are limits on what needs an article in our wiki, and that some things would do better with a link to somewhere else. Canons and canon things in particular. Some of them (LotR, Discworld) have special relevance to us and some (HP, Star Wars, Doctor Who) are just too big to be ignored, but most canons don&#39;t need more than one page with a general overview of their special characteristics. If something does warrant its own page, it should be addressed in terms of the PPC more than anything else. (&quot;X and the PPC&quot; is a good type of header to use.) I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big problem at the moment, but since we&#39;re talking about what the wiki is for, I thought I&#39;d bring it up. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>
