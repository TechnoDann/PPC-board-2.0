            <p>Hat of disguise - those things are awesome!<br><br>That was a particularly obnoxious Sue. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve seen one that actually did run the gamut of all the canon characters and prove herself &#39;superior&#39; to every single one.<br><br>I suppose you could claim that her going through everyone&#39;s most deeply-held secrets and announcing them was similar to Lupin making everyone face a boggart, thus displaying their worst fears to the class, but that at least had educational purpose.

            <p>Yeah, my point exactly. Lupin showed them how to laugh at what they feared. He helped them. The Sue merely dragged up humiliating details to &#39;prove&#39; she could read their minds.<br><br>And the way she targeted Hermione was just vicious; more like a schoolyard rival than a teacher who is supposed to have some professionalism. There&#39;s very good reason for Maz deciding Hermione ought to get a bit of revenge for that deliberate cruelty.</p>

She&#39;s Thranduil&#39;s wife and seems basically inoffensive, but in the one mission I recall reading where Legolas got OC relations and they weren&#39;t Sues or Stus, they were all recruited because royals would find it hard to assimilate.<br>Certainly, she&#39;s done nothing to deserve being killed; she seems mostly to exist in order to support the budding relationship between Arwen and Legolas. I&#39;d leave her alone were it not for her rank.<br>What are your thoughts, more experienced members? Should Jackson and Felaben recruit her, or neuralise her and let her assimilate?</p>

            <p>neuralyse and let her assimilate into the canon. Thranduil&#39;s wife isn&#39;t mentioned in the books, which is why those who&#39;ve read them tend to assume she&#39;s either dead or left for Valinor. As far as I know, neither is true; she just wasn&#39;t mentioned because she wasn&#39;t of any use to the plot.<br><br>The mission you read was actually one I co-wrote with Kgarrett; we decided to recruit the brothers of Legolas (and the eldest&#39;s wife and kids) because they were shoehorned in to facilitate Legolas&#39;s whiny bratty teenager-ness. Legolas was never mentioned as having brothers, and we decided it was seriously improbable for Thranduil to send his youngest son on a dangerous quest, and also for him to have children over a millennium apart in age. Also, the brothers&#39; basic personalities were not very consistent with typical Elvish behaviour, particularly royals, so we recruited the lot rather than have unexplained extra kids of Thranduil running around.<br><br>If Thranduil&#39;s wife is basically inoffensive to canon, you can likely get away with neuralysing her; after all, Thranduil had to be married at some point, or there wouldn&#39;t <i>be</i> a Legolas.</p>

            <p>That is a rather bratty attitude I saw from her. I&#39;m not sure if your saying the mod was wrong for being offended, or for the response about &#39;If you don&#39;t like it, bye&#39;. But I think that someone is entitled to being offended about someone thing like that, and the message they sent was hardly offensive at all.<br><br>I&#39;ve never read Deleterius, though I might check it out. But I really do think the image is a little much.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PPC! It&#39;s awesome to have friendly new people here. Have a bag of pebbles and a Random Shiny Object. They&#39;re useful for distracting people (and Sues) and throwing at people (and Sues).<br><br>I approve of your fandoms, though video games and anime are not things I know much about.<br><br>I recommend that you check out the PPC Wiki, if you haven&#39;t poked around on there already, for the suggested writings. The Original Series, by Jay and Acacia, is pretty much mamdatory, as is the page on requesting Permission, but other than that have fun exploring.</p>

            <p>Hi, everyone!<br><br>I&#39;ve been reading mission reports for a while, and decided to go ahead and sign up here.<br><br>My fan-type interests include tabletop RPG (D&amp;D up to version 3.5, Champions/Hero System up to 6th Edition), LOTR, Mercedes Lackey (Valdemar series, Elemental Masters series, Tales of the 500 Kingdoms, Dragon Jousters), classic Dr Who (can&#39;t afford the extra cable tiers to get the new stuff, and official disclaimer: I can&#39;t stand Colin Baker&#39;s Doctor), David Eddings (Belgariad/Mallorean), earlier Star Trek, earlier Pern (I have not read any of the books written by McCaffrey&#39;s son), and the Deryni novels.  I&#39;m also something of a history buff, and go out of my way to catch new episodes of MythBusters.<br><br>I&#39;ve never written fanfic, though I&#39;ve been tempted a few times.  This is probably just as well -- given the way discussion was going when a former D&amp;D group was talking about crossing our PCs over with ST:TNG, had we gone ahead with that one it would be over in &quot;Killed Badfic&quot; on the wiki.</p>

            <p>My first Doctor was Jon Pertwee, so he&#39;s the sentimental favorite.  I have to admit, though, some of his scripts weren&#39;t that great.  If we leave sentiment out of the equation, Tom Baker and Sylvester McCoy are neck-and-neck for favorite Doctor, with Patrick Troughton trying to push his way in there.  I&#39;ve only seen a few William Hartnell episodes, and while I like Peter Davison as an actor the writers had too much trouble coming up with a Doctor-persona for him.<br><br>:: pets cat ::</p>

            <p>You have some fantastic dialogue in this piece, especially when it comes to the inter-partner banter.

            <p>You have a valid point about the urple. Truth is, it was the first thing that came to mind apart from outright Sueifying him, which I didn&#39;t want to take the time to deal with. I thought the SILAS would be better specifically because it allowed them to continue the mission without further interruption, but if I missed the mark, it&#39;s good to know.<br><br>Could you be a little more specific about what antics were annoying?

            <p>This was great, I have onlt heard stuff about kenders from Mr Welsh&#39;s List, so I&#39;m not sure about them, but I like Earwig, hes great! Derik is also neat to read, and I find the huge contrast between them makes it easier to tell who is speaking.<br><br>My favorite parts would have to be :<br><br>&quot;No.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Awww. Not even a little?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No.&quot;<br><br>and<br><br>&quot;Yes, Earwig, it is a good thing you picked it up.&quot;- you can just taste the sarcasm and/or annoyance under the calm facade.<br><br>Also when Earwig and Derik have the shared look, funniest thing I&#39;ve read all day!<br><br>&quot;We are? Oh, how wonderful! I&#39;ve never been on a Viking raid before! I can&#39;t wait! Do you think we can torch the houses and pillage and—&quot; LOL! the image of a miniature person doing those things is hilarious! <br><br>&quot;Look! A distraction!&quot; Excellent use of diversionary tactics!<br><br>A great mission!<br><br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>Thanks especially for the specific comments. It&#39;s great to hear what&#39;s making an impact about the characters, and I&#39;m glad their personalities are coming through and entertaining. ^_^<br><br>To be honest, I have concerns that Earwig is a little too much a Generic Kender, because it&#39;s hard to pinpoint specific personality traits through all the racial characteristics, but I&#39;m working on it. What is Mr Welsh&#39;s List, by the way?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Mr Welsh&#39;s list is a bunch of things that the player (refered to as &#39;Mr Welch&#39;) are not allowed to do. It is a humourous thing, and you could get a lot of laughs out of it.

            <p>Hi all...<br>*shakey a bit*<br>I haven&#39;t been a newbie for a while anywhere, but after I saw Something Blue posting here (I know her IRL, she&#39;s awesome), I figured I&#39;d better get my behind in gear and actually register.<br>I started reading the original series about a year after it came out (I think) and got addicted.<br><br>Main question here, is anyone else here into the Sherlock fandom? It&#39;s considered a child of the Sherlock Holmes fandom, according to fandom consensus, so I think it would merit its own agents... Namely, I&#39;m considering writing a series. Problem is, it&#39;d often come under the heading of bad slash. The other problem? There&#39;s a plethora of really, REALLY good fic in this fandom! :( (Makes me consider going for Soul Eater instead...)<br><br>So, um, yeah, hi. *cowers* Please call me Meta.<br><br>And does BBCode work on here...?</p>

            <p>So, on Fanficrants, user of (as far as I saw) indeterminate gender and orientation shows up complaining about flames received from users also of indeterminate gender and orientation. Flames were because flamers were offended that user dared to include a hetero relationship between a canon female and his/her male OC. Fandom is a shooter game populated with a very high percentage of female characters, which leads me to believe it&#39;s marketed at young men. I don&#39;t think it was meant to be particularly feminist, it just has a lot of girls in it. There are no canonical romantic/sexual relationships at all, but fandom has a lot of yuri/femslash-type fics, naturally. I don&#39;t know what proportions of the fandom are actually made up of what genders and orientations. Male OC flirts and has relationship with one of the girls, whose orientation is, as noted above, not confirmed in canon. He is described as capable of &quot;holding his own&quot; with canonical abilities which the girls show but which are also used by the male characters. No hint that he has excessive powers or is capable of always defeating all the women.<br><br>Commenter on ffrants gets angry because apparently from what they&#39;ve picked up from the rant they&#39;ve decided OP is being misogynist and invading a &quot;lesbian safe space&quot;. Please see above notes about nature of fandom.<br><br>I comment saying that I&#39;m confused as to how a male character just being there is offensive to women.<br><br>Commenter repeats that &quot;lesbian safe space&quot; is being invaded and goes off about feminism.<br><br>I say I&#39;m actually deeply offended by the idea that feminism requires the erasure of men, say that truly strong female characters will still be so and may in fact be more so with a male to interact with and I also think vice versa for male characters - surely showing a competent man interacting respectfully with equally-competent women shows both in a better light than erasing one lot? I then point out above description of canon and fandom, and repeat that I don&#39;t see what the problem is with one male character appearing in one fic and having a relationship with one female character who could possibly not be a lesbian despite common fanon.<br><br>Commenter insists that implication of OP is that male OC is taking over fandom and defeating all female canons and that I am wrong for &quot;giving the straight male the benefit of the doubt&quot; (as if giving the OP the benefit of the doubt when HELLO HE/SHE&#39;S STILL WATCHING OUR COMMENTS is wrong) and am accusing the lesbian reviewers of the fic of being &quot;over-reacting screeching harpies&quot;.<br><br>I point out that there is no evidence that OP is straight and/or male, nor that the reviewers are gay and/or female (see above), and that, in my words, &quot;This is fandom, people will throw similar fits over what flavour breakfast cereal you describe characters as eating&quot;.<br><br>Commenter hissyfits at me, calls me &quot;asshole&quot;, and flounces without responding to these points.<br><br>Okay, I understand that people may be uncomfortable with a male OC in a fandom which was designed as a feminist-type story. But I don&#39;t think this one was. It just happens to have a lot of girls in it. Okay, I shouldn&#39;t have got drawn into the argument and I apologise for that, but I&#39;d like to have someone whose opinion I trust tell me whether I am wrong for thinking that male characters in a female-populated fandom are not inherently evil and wrong merely for being male. If I am, I apologise, but I still really don&#39;t see from the given evidence that there was that much of a problem.</p>

            <p>I know I haven&#39;t been around much lately, but as someone who knows the series in questions very well, allow me to explain.<br><br>The Touhou games have an all-female cast. There are two males: one of which is a turtle used for flying and has not been seen in a decade, the other is a cloud. There is one more male in the side works in a book, and he is a shopkeeper.  None of these male are powerful; in fact, the shopkeeper is noted several times as being very, very weak.<br><br>The Touhou fanbase is a little absurd. The shipping and such can go between any two characters for very little reason even if the characters have never met. However, in canon, there are NO relationships between ANY characters whatsoever.  In fact, most of the ship are between character who have never met, or want each other dead. It is not a &#39;lesbian-safe&#39; zone at all.  However, most of the girls are either teenagers, or Youkai that are hundreds or years old and look about like teenagers.<br><br>But now we come to the OC.  You see, most characters in Touhou are strong enough that they kill and eat humans, like Rumia and Mystia. The humans in Touhou are strong enough to hunt and kill Youkai for this, like Reimu and Sanae.  If the OC WORKS for his power, and isn&#39;t beating any of the big name people right off the bat, it&#39;s understandable, being as in Touhou they fight using &#39;Spellcard Rules&#39; which basically is a way that no one dies in these disputes, and no matter the power level, there&#39;s a slightly more leveled field.<br><br>Long story short, none of the characters have any set orientations in the games, the OC is ok as long as he&#39;s not blasting Reimu or Marisa or Yukari right off the bat, and it is NOT a &#39;lesbiant safe space&#39; at all.</p>

            <p>I was wondering, because if he was ignoring valid human male canon characters to pair the females with that would be kind of puzzling at best and offensive at worst, but clearly pairing off those guys would only appeal to a specific audience (which would probably include me if I had any idea who they were, because I&#39;m weird that way).

            <p>I did in fact check out a feminist blog on their condescending recommendation. Found no articles on &quot;oh noez, random stranger dares write fanfic about non-females&quot;, but it did lead me to the bands Gravy Train!!!! (their punctuation) and Voodoo Queens, which was worth checking out :)<br><br>I&#39;ve tried to see these people&#39;s point of view, and I just can&#39;t. Before we even start on the feminist thing, trying to claim a total stranger&#39;s fandom with which you (general-you) admitted to being unfamiliar as your own &quot;safe space&quot; is sheer ... I don&#39;t even know. It pissed me off badly enough when someone condescendingly explained to me about a Redwall rant of mine that mice do not have an incest taboo, when it should have been blatantly clear from the rant that I was talking about mice which talk, wear clothes, and adopt infant ferrets as their own, so ... yeah. Or the time I talked about Mossflower&#39;s vermin and someone else assumed I was talking about something called the Skaven, which I&#39;d never heard of.<br><br>I can understand being pissed off at the overall <i>trend</i> that interesting male heroes outnumber females in fiction, as I kind of am annoyed by that too and was even before this whole debacle. (Personally I think that&#39;s a sign there are too few interesting female characters, not too many male ones, but I get the point there.) But given that this is fanfic ... There is no limit on the amount of fanfic which can be written, or on the amount of space to put fanfic. This guy (I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s a guy, though it may not be - didn&#39;t say and I don&#39;t want to blog-stalk) is not taking away a publisher&#39;s or producer&#39;s attention/time/money from worthy books/movies/TV/etc with female heroes, and nor is he taking money from an audience which they might otherwise spend on things with female heroes. He mentioned that he labelled it as containing a male character, so people who don&#39;t want to read it don&#39;t have to, so it&#39;s hardly &quot;shifting focus&quot; of the entire fandom, which is still focused mostly on female characters. Given the nature of fanfic archives, unless the fic is either very good or very bad it&#39;ll probably be all but forgotten in a week. I fail to see how this is worthy of the level of vitriol it spawned. Also, they argue that because well-written male heroes outnumber well-written female heroes in fiction overall, they&#39;re entitled to be angry. According to that argument, it would be possible to get offended at men for doing just about anything. Maybe this simile isn&#39;t great because fanfic isn&#39;t something that&#39;s actually important to everyday life (our opinions notwithstanding), but here goes: plenty of workplaces sadly still discriminate against women and minorities despite laws against doing so, does that mean it&#39;s offensive for straight white able-bodied cisgendered men to have or apply for jobs at all?<br><br>Also, I did not realise &quot;I am not a member of a certain privileged group&quot; meant &quot;I can assume the worst of total strangers just because they may or may not be a member of said group and nobody is allowed to tell me this is rude&quot;.</p>

            <p>On the Fanmix community, someone just posted a mix about angels. I didn&#39;t see the poster&#39;s gender, but they said they&#39;d always been fascinated by angels and &quot;always hated seeing them portrayed as females&quot;. That I do find offensive.

            <p>I some time thinking about this one. I&#39;m definitely not a scholar on the subject, but the only named angels I think I  remember were Gabriel and Michael. They might not have had any gender actually attached to them originally, but those names have always been associated with males, so I suppose that a person could think that angels should be male. And all the figurines I&#39;ve ever seen look female to me in the facial features.<br><br>I had never thought about it before, but I suppose some people could have a male gender idea of angels, and feel left out by all the female looking figurines?  Personally I prefer hand-painted cherubs that are <i>not</i> glazed a solid white. Maybe it all just boils down to personal preference. (Of course there is a difference in stating their personal preference and being rude about it. The person still could have been being rude.)</p>

            <p>Starting from the point that they accuse someone of being misogynist just for adding a male OC (it&#39;s not a matter if it&#39;s a Stu or not for this) to the point of &quot;lesbian safe place&quot; (I can&#39;t still catch the meaning of that, was ffcrant done just to have femslash?)<br>Anyway, from what I&#39;ve read on the flamewar, it seems to me that people were discussing different points: adding a male character, trying to have no critics, and then I lost track. But I think dicussing it on the web is a bit useless, and as on the web you don&#39;t have to show your face, many people is ruder than in their normal lives.<br>Hope I hadn&#39;t taken out another point to discuss about :D</p>

            <p>Frankly, I&#39;d say back out. I know I said something down the thread about ethics of apologies, but might as well ignore it now. It&#39;s too big a mess to clean up with some well-phrased words. I read some of the comments on that post, and they make me want to tear my hair out, and I&#39;m not even involved! Charming. FFrants can certainly be fun, but I imagine it&#39;s a community best left with as few comments as possible on such topics. <br><br>...of course, as has just occured to me, it <i>is</i> a rant community and therefore not all that likely to be populated (en masse; I&#39;m certainly not aiming to offend you or the majority of your friends/peers/other sensible people here) by those who are all that open to calm, collected discussion. Certainly not when their feelings are hurt. Bleh. What a mess. I feel so bad for you, tangled up in there. And the amount of comments! You must&#39;ve been typing all day :(</p>

            <p>Possibly it&#39;s related to having experienced some gender identity issues myself (I eventually settled on my bio gender, but for a while I wondered because I&#39;m an extremely un-girly girl) but for whatever reason I react just as badly to misandry as misogyny.

            <p>Otherwise I&#39;d have expected a lot more &quot;but you HAVE to agree with me, you&#39;re a woman!&quot; I don&#39;t know whether to be flattered or not by that. I have XX chromosomes and corresponding biology, and identify as female, but I quite like the idea of being able to &quot;be&quot; male as well some of the time (hence what Laburnum and Hemlock do in my PPC stuff). And I&#39;m honestly becoming far more keen on the idea because of this. I&#39;m ashamed of having to share my gender with people who see nothing hypocritical in claiming that they&#39;re being mistreated because of their gender because a person wrote a fanfic with a male character in it in a fandom of which the complainers haven&#39;t even heard but decide &quot;must&quot; be for feminists because it has more women than men in it (so do brothels, womens&#39; prisons, womens&#39; clothing stores, and maternity wards, are they automatically lesbian and/or feminist havens?) and men have never been excluded from it and were in fact its target audience, then scream that I&#39;m &quot;giving the straight male the benefit of the doubt&quot;. Uh, yes, because from what I have seen this writer may <i>not</i> in fact be either straight or male and even if he is that does not mean he is necessarily wrong and/or trying to harm women?<br><br>I&#39;m not leaving ffrants, though. I have as much right to be there as they do, and I&#39;m not leaving because I think some people there are being irritating. It&#39;s ffrants, if I had to do that I&#39;d never have joined it.<br><br>I honestly don&#39;t know why I bothered to argue. Maybe I&#39;m under-sensitive, but I find it hard to get genuinely offended by fanfic. Whining at fanficcers isn&#39;t going to make them stop doing what they want to do, or else we&#39;d send our missions directly to them, and a fanficcer doing something isn&#39;t going to make sane people suddenly subscribe to that fanficcer&#39;s views. Even &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, no matter how much my agent characters screamed and swore and puked about it, just made real-me go &quot;Sheesh. Oh well, he&#39;s a moron, whaddyagonnado?&quot; A man who expressed views like that to me in real life would be either rapidly arrested or looking for his teeth, but since I can&#39;t do anything about it from here, I find it hard to care.</p>

            <p>I know I shouldn&#39;t worry about it, but I keep coming up with new holes to poke in the argument and it&#39;s really frustrating that I can&#39;t go say them. Like, their argument was, as far as I can tell, that it&#39;s offensive to write about men because male characters doing interesting things outnumber females in popular fiction and stories about women doing interesting things are more difficult to get published. By that logic, since men have sadly done their best to exclude women from so many fields over the centuries, isn&#39;t it basically offensive for any man to do just about anything?<br><br>I&#39;m gonna go affirm my feminine side in the way I like to do it - by reading slashy fanfic. Hey, I&#39;m female, therefore theoretically anything that makes me feel empowered counts as female empowerment.</p>

            <p>I really wish people weren&#39;t so sensitive about sexuality-related issues that they feel they have to fly off the handle at things like these. I don&#39;t particularly feel like joining in this argument on lj (I&#39;m not 18 so I can&#39;t yet anyway, and discussions with people like this give me a massive headache), but ever since 9th grade Ethnic Studies class, I&#39;ve been hearing these horrifically skewed versions of feminist ideas, and I&#39;m getting sick of it.<br><br>I believe you&#39;re in the right, if only because I agree with you that the presence of male characters does not at all detract from the quality or competence of the female characters, and I strongly disagree with the points someone said about how &quot;most of the time when an oppressed group says that a privileged person is ...ing up, the oppressed group is correct&quot;, and &quot;men have no place in a woman-dominated space.&quot; Clearly this person has never met a male cheerleader. <br><br>I&#39;m a woman and I&#39;m comfortable enough with that fact that I don&#39;t feel threatened when I work alongside men. The notion that others do, in this day and age, whether or not males are often privileged, is simply sad. I&#39;m against this whole &quot;men are pigs&quot; notion that a lot of feminists nowadays entertain, and I&#39;m annoyed that something as silly as putting a male OC in a fandom full of women would have the same effect on these commenters as throwing a bucket of ice water on a cat. These people are insisting that putting a female in a male-dominated place is alright while putting a male in a female-dominated place is demeaning and disrespectful, and in doing so they support the double standards that cause the very sexism that they all have a problem with.</p>

            <p>According to OP, there are in fact male characters who canonically have the same abilities the male OC does and are just as competent with them. They don&#39;t get in relationships with the girls because nobody gets in a relationship with anyone in this canon, not because the girls are all gay. As I said, I&#39;m pretty sure the game was actually marketed at men, and the angry commenter admitted they&#39;re not familiar with the game.</p>

            <p>These are not the same things. They don&#39;t even have anything to do with one another. I know everybody here knows this. But it really, REALLY made me facepalm when I heard this came from a PARINGS discussion. <br><br>NO. NO. NO.<br><br>Sure. A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle. But how many fish do you know even care if a bicycle is in their water or not? The idea is that sure, you don&#39;t NEED men to be yourself. But Feminism and lesbianism have nothing to do with each other. If anything, These posters caring that there WAS a guy is more neurotic and against feminist principles than just being cool with it.<br><br>It makes me think they are insecure about this character. And insecurity is fear. And people really only fear things that have power over them. You know. Doubt and uncertainty about life, like bills... employment... whether or not a tiger is going to leap out and eat them. That stuff has power over the direction of a person&#39;s life. It&#39;s powerful and people fear it because not fearing it usually gets you dead.<br><br>And these so-called feminists flip out at a /man/ of all things?<br><br>By freaking out that there is a man in their little haven, they are displaying the amount of power a male has over them. They are defeating their own argument. <br><br>A het relationship is not always an oppressive androcentric dynamic. Lesbian relationships can get abusive and oppressive just as much as het ones. If neither character oppresses the other in the pairing... why the FEMINIST outcry?<br><br>What /small/ words.</p>

            <p>Having read the thread and your post, at first glance this sounds like someone who isn&#39;t particularly self-secure with their sexuality and feels the need to lash out, honestly. <br><br>That said, all perceptions of the poster aside, I <i>definitely</i> do not agree that feminisim requires no men to be around. That&#39;s just... well, you already covered it, really. I agree with you. So now, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re at all in the wrong. <br><br>I think the briefest argument to support you is to do a genderflip: There are <i>lots</i> of fandoms mostly or entirely populated by men in which female characters are welcomed, even asked for, in a romantic sense. They aren&#39;t considered inherently evil, so why should it be so the other way around? I completely do not understand why it is that there can be a whole movement for feminisim without respecting that the other side needs to be supported too, or at least not buried under all the propoganda, because the moment &quot;feminism&quot; becomes synonymous with &quot;women in charge and men subsurvient&quot;, they&#39;re undercutting their own ideals - the ideals which started cries for women&#39;s equality in the first place. <br><br>...And, now seeing the thread, I see you&#39;ve already covered that. In detail. With graphs and illustrations, so to speak. And she still doesn&#39;t get it. Huh. Honestly, Laburnum, I&#39;d say your best bet is to back out of the conversation and let her be an idiot in her own circles, because she&#39;s not going to listen. Anyone reading that thread can see perfectly well that you&#39;re being calm and rational while she&#39;s throwing a tantrum. You&#39;re in the right, even if you can&#39;t win the argument. </p>

            <p>... I did kind of see the point. Women are, sadly, not yet equal to men, and I can understand why some of us would feel it was an intrusion. But the canon isn&#39;t women-only, it already has male canon characters even if the focus is on women, and since it&#39;s a shooter game I&#39;m willing to bet the game in question was designed by, was mostly marketed at, and is mostly played by males even if a lot of the ficcers are female. So, as far as I can see, it&#39;s not a &quot;female safe space&quot;, it&#39;s a game which happens to contain a lot of female characters and have fic written about it by women.</p>

            <p>I suppose it&#39;s hard for me to accept anyone saying that women aren&#39;t (&quot;yet&quot;) equal to men, because in my entire life, I have never seen anything to indicate that. I&#39;ve never seen any woman lose out to a man for a job, nor be treated in any way that I&#39;d define as gender-base unfair by them. I&#39;ve certainly never felt the least but un-equal myself.

            <p>... because, while I&#39;ve had the good fortune not to experience it myself, I know women do get mistreated a lot. But I&#39;m pretty sure that if we were 100% equal to men worldwide in all areas, all that would happen is that men would be mistreated an equal amount of the time by both women and other men. Women are just currently easier targets. While I&#39;d like to remove gender, biological sex, sexual orientation, race, age, and disabilities or lack thereof as a reason for it, the fact is people are going to act like asshats to each other whatever we do to try to stop it. All that would happen if prejudice was removed would be that people acted that way because they thought that specific person was an easy target.</p>

            <p>Too much politics and too many personal encounters involved. You&#39;re probably quite right; it certainly happens in schools, for instance, that children will find someone to tease regardless. I guess I just prefer my fairly simple approach of act-like-all&#39;s-equal-instead-of-whine-and-maybe-you&#39;ll-make-it-turn-out-that-way.

            <p>I&#39;ve never understood the mentality that having competant men present immediately stops a story from being feminist. To be honest, that attitude strikes me as <i>anti</i>-feminist. Sort of &quot;Women can only be badass when there are no men, and if men are there then the women should return to the kitchen where they belong&quot;.<br>The idea that to show a strong woman as having a romantic side makes her no longer strong is also rather obnoxious. If I&#39;m reading your post correctly, that&#39;s all the OP had done in his/her fic: have a love story involving a male OC and a female canon character. Having a woman fall in love doesn&#39;t immediately take away everything that makes her, well, her.<br>(To be honest, it seems to me that you can&#39;t <i>breathe</i> on fanficrants without someone throwing a hissyfit)</p>

            <p>I should probably read the thread in question before responding, but it&#39;s not like this sort of thing is uncommon, so:<br><br>No, you&#39;re not wrong. I don&#39;t doubt that the situation is exactly what you say it is, and that people are overreacting.

            <p>What I&#39;m getting from them is that women and GLBTQ folks not being equal with straight men now means that women/GLBTQ can have &quot;safe spaces&quot; in fandom with no male OCs but can also insert characters from their own genders and orientations into canons without them while everywhere with straight men has to allow women/GLBTQ into it. I might be missing a point but this smacks of having your cake and eating it to me, and also like making a fuss over something of no real consequence.<br><br>I did apologise because I can sort of see their point, but surely even if men and women aren&#39;t equal the way to get them so is to interact with both men and women as if they are equal while doing things of actual consequence to ensure they become so rather than arguing on the internet? For example, by not assuming that specific men are misogynist until proven otherwise?</p>

            <p>I have to say that I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s my Aspergers&#39; or just me, but I do still have a tendency to assume that everyone is equal and everyone will act as if everyone is so. I&#39;ve never face-to-face encountered genuine, malicious sexism, racism, ableism, or homophobia (I&#39;ve seen people throw terms which are so around as insults, but they were just picking whatever would be offensive, not actually hating those groups, and I&#39;ve seen people do and occasionally accidentally myself done offensive things because of thoughtlessness - just see my sporkings), so it&#39;s sometimes hard for me to remember to keep an eye out for thoughtless assumptions on my own part.</p>

            <p>Maybe the fact that I was raised in an all-girls school is skewing my view, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t remember any lesbians at my school, but presumably there were some whom I just didn&#39;t meet.

            <p>I know Touhou! It&#39;s 99.99999% fan service! Hell, the reason why few-to-none canon pairings exist is so the fandom can ship whomever they want. Also, calling the characters of Touhou &quot;women&quot; is stretching it<br><br>Even without that bit, it&#39;s no more a &quot;lesbian-safe place&quot; than, say, Love Hina, or Panty and Stocking, or any other anime/manga/game designed for male-oriented fan service.<br><br>I tried to make a (much longer, slightly ranty) post to that effect, but apparently you have to be a member of FFrants to post comments, and I can&#39;t be arsed to join.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d never heard of the game, but the fact that it&#39;s a shooter game made me pretty sure it was marketed at men. So by these girls&#39; own arguments, aren&#39;t they &quot;invading a male safe space&quot;? Because a game like that sounds like as much of a feminist safe space as the Playboy mansion. (Not saying women can&#39;t either enjoy playing the game or enjoy working at or otherwise being in the Playboy mansion. Just that people shouldn&#39;t be surprised that neither are geared specifically at feminists.) Arguing Commenter admitted she&#39;d never heard of the game, so I honestly don&#39;t know why she ignored me when I pointed out that I doubted it was specifically aimed at women and therefore it was unreasonable not to expect men to want to be involved.</p>

            <p>As you said, had this canon been geared towards a pro-feminist agenda, then having a male OC successfully flirt with one of the canonical females would have been problematic.

            <p>I&#39;ve now been accused of trolling for saying that I thought feminism was about treating men and women equally and therefore both men and women should be able to do everything the other gender can do (allowing for individual and biological variation eg XY people can&#39;t give birth except in mpreg) and therefore both men and women can write OCs of their own gender if they wish. I remain baffled as to why this is so offensive. I don&#39;t think I treat men and women any differently, and apparently I&#39;m being misogynist by not immediately leaping on this person and demanding they prove they&#39;re not misogynist.</p>

            <p>the concept of mini-Balrogs was created by Miss Cam, who wrote the Official Fanfiction University of Middle-earth. The idea actually is that mini-Balrogs are created by misspelling a Lord of the Rings canon character&#39;s name, or the name of a known location.<br><br>So the poor little minis are actually created by typos.<br><br>It&#39;s the same for other fandoms the PPC knows, these days.

            <p>The television series Sherlock(2010), is relatively new, and so far only three episodes have been aired in Great Britain. The series have yet to come to Denmark, however my sister got it for Christmas so we’ve already seen them. But by the Force I already love the show. Completely new thinking both in plot and characters. Because it is so new, you probably won’t find so many fanfictions about it. Another thing would be, that this series so far, only have been shown on BBC, where as the most popular and worst fanfics, comes from movies like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and other well known works. It is simply too isolated and new at this time, to have generated proper badfics. Meaning, it is so small, that people, who write badfics just to create a provocative fanfic, and get response, have so far overlooked it/haven’t discovered it so far. Thank the force for the sheer volume of the internet. <br><br>Another thing would be that Sherlock Holmes, though also quit simple, has such a complicated personality. Holmes is an arrogant, sociopath with an uncanny ability to see the smallest of details, and from that deduct the most relevant of information. This, is something the fanfic author has to be aware of, before he make a good fanfic. Where as, writing a Harry Potter fanfic might be easier, Sherlock Holmes is a genre where only the author, who understands the personality of Sherlocks, and is able to create the most detailed scene, with small overlooked clues, can create a great fanfic.<br>This means that, it might discourage people from trying to write a fanfi...il they’ve researched both characters, and have developed a proper plot. I get the impression that many of the people on that forum, takes their work so seriously, that when written they tend to either rewrite it or change it constantly.<br><br>The need for proper villains in Sherlock Holmes fanfics, almost screams out, for either unusual situations, or for a near Mary Sue or Gary Stue villain. The villain has to be near perfect, yet so flawed, that only Sherlock will be able to find him. This means, that this genre, is one of the only ones, where a Mary Stue or Gary Stue villain is (to some degree) tolerable, but not necessary. Meaning, not all Sherlock Holmes stories with Mary Stues og Gary Stues, needs to be purged.<br><br>As for their response to PPC, I think they’re a bit ignorant. PPC authors can be looked upon as a sort of reviewers, yet a more lively and serious version. This means, PPC authors don’t necessary mock people on their work (unless it is an intentional slashfic, which means the community itself would disgusted at the work) but rather try and encourage people for better writing and point out overlooked flaws, or mistakes. However, this still depends on the story, and how the PPC author decides to tackle it.<br><br>I agree with the others, that your first post has been a bit too, both negative and provocative at some points. PPC is an agency, people should find, not the PPC finding them. Those who are dedicated enough will find it, those who don’t care won’t.<br><br>My opinion, just if you’re curious, but don’t take me too serious :p<br></p>

            <p>I think they&#39;re reacting fairly rationally to someone who just jumped in with such an announcement, if strongly.<br><br>People do not take their work being made fun of easily.

            <p>Hopefully it won&#39;t spread any further than that thread, and it won&#39;t be a big deal, but it wasn&#39;t a good idea. This sort of reaction is why we don&#39;t go around parading the group to the general public. (Especially after the incident that sparked <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/the_ppc/52523.html">this</a> and <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/the_ppc/52871.html">this</a>.) Most people aren&#39;t as big into the rules of writing as we are. They don&#39;t get it, and they&#39;re not going to, because they don&#39;t share our passions. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that, it just means that we don&#39;t expect heaps of praise from people who aren&#39;t us. You&#39;ll want to get used to that before going any further.<br><br>Phobos made some excellent points, and I believe Miah recently provided you with the Links on your intro post. You should read them. Perhaps we should start giving them out more frequently again.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Using the word &#39;invaded&#39; might not have been the best idea, but perhaps a link to the FAQ:For other people on the wiki would help?

            <p>Anonymity isn&#39;t automatically cowardly, but it can be, especially if a person says something hurtful or just arrogantly declares their righteousness and doesn&#39;t leave the other person any space to reply. It&#39;s like trying to have the last word all the time. I used to use anonymous to review for ff.net, but I realize that if I was responsible for what I said, and I could get messages from anyone about what I said, than I would be way more careful about what I wrote (checking for typos on reviews, for example).</p>

A potential good crossover or a complete mess? I cannot say for sure. Maybe because English is not my first language. However, there are some errors only about Hermone&#39;s (thats it, Hermione is apparently an ace pilot) plane:<br>1) There is no such thing as a F/A-27 (the XFA-27 never became a production fighter in AC canon)<br>2) Wrong missiles: the XFA-27 has AIM-9M Sidewinders, but the fic states the F/A-27 uses MM-7s, whatever they are, and starts with a loadout of 26 missiles and 2 QAAMs, that doesn&#39;t make sense both in Ace Combat canon (worst loadout I know of are 52 missiles and 6 QAAMs on a rather scrappy plane) and in reality.<br>3) Wrong engines: the XFA-27 has two engines with unknown technology, the fic states that the F/A-27 has four pulse detonation ones. Believable about the pulse detonation engines, but where the hell are supposed to be the two extra ones? This guy is confusing the XFA-27 with the YR-302 Fregata, the special ability of the XFA-27 is to fire up to four missiles at once instead of two.<br><br>Since the fic relies a lot on equipment description, giving out each one wrong is not good.</p>

            <p>and as you&#39;ve already observed, people do have many variations on mission-writing.  There is a basic rhythm to missions, however; it&#39;s just a matter of taking that rhythm and fancying it up however you please.<br><br>The basic pattern is as follows (using Department of Mary-Sues procedure as an example).<br><br>1. Humourous interaction between Agents/arrival of mission on console, announced by BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!<br><br>2. Agents bicker/pick disguises and/or weapons, and enter fic.<br><br>3. Agents go through fic, noting down charges and bickering/ snarking at stupid in the fic/ avoiding being seen/ taking advantage of any mentioned food or chances of sleep/ bickering/ thinking up nasty things to do to the warping characters/ ogling Lust Objects/ bickering/ all of the above.<br><br>4. Agents get Sue on her own, charge her, and kill her in as inventive a way as they feel like.<br><br>5. Agents rescue any bit-characters they decided to rescue/ neuralyse the canon characters/ steal any of the Sue&#39;s belongings they feel like/ go back to HQ.<br><br>The Department variations usually come around step 4. I&#39;ll add them in too.<br><br>Bad Slash: Agents burst in on the characters, stun them enough to stop them struggling, and exorcise them, generally by howling like loons, ringing bells and shouting &quot;AVAUNT!&quot; a lot.<br><br>Implausible Crossovers: Agents neuralyse the canon characters and put everything and everyone back in the canon worlds they&#39;re supposed to be in.<br><br>Geographical Aberrations: As for Mary Sues, but insert an extra step after 4: Agents burn the geographical aberration in question. Laughing dementedly is an optional extra.<br><br>Disturbng Acts of Violence: Agents rescue the character who has suffered said disturbing acts and take him/her to DAVD Physician Fizz R, then bring him/her back once healed up.<br><br>Floaters: Any of the above.<br><br>Hope this was useful!</p>

            <p>As you&#39;ve already noticed every agent as a different style of reporting their missions. This is because the only requirements to a mission are: agent(s) is/are sent into a story, take(s) note of all the chargeable offenses and in the end find(s) the Sue/Stu and charge(s) her/him. Missions that are not about an OC Sue usually end with an exorcism or retreving canon characters from cowering in plotholes.<br><br>Paperwork is usually glossed over by authors, but agents complain about it plenty.<br><br>Yes, the monkey would explode if the C4 exploded. The monkey would not explode on its own, though. Only as a side effect of the C4 exploding. I don&#39;t know whether building up static is enough to make C4 explode.</p>

            <p>How an individual mission is written really depends on the writer, to be honest. However, barring stylistic choices, it usually goes as such:<br><br>1.) A mission is received by the agents via the console and/or given to them as punishment for an Incident (Noodle or otherwise) by the Flower that heads up their Department.<br><br>2.)

            <p>I&#39;m typically bad about greeting new folk, but I visit the board so rarely that I typically just miss their threads. Anywho, welcome!<br><br>The board, on a technical level, works off of the old (and in my opinion, outdated) BBS system, wherein a person creates a thread, people reply to that thread, and eventually the thread drops off of the first page as new threads are created because, unlike most forums today, new posts in a thread don&#39;t push the thread up to the top of the page.<br><br>As for PPC fic, I&#39;d like to direct you to the wiki (ppc.wikia.com). Writing for the PPC without Permission is frowned upon. To get permission, you have to hang around for at least a month so that folks can get to know you better, then whenever you&#39;re ready you submit a permission request consisting of a writing sample and a write-up of your planned agents.<br><br>On the subject of where to put up your stories, I&#39;d recommend Livejournal or DeviantArt, or something similar. FF.Net (known more colorfully around here as &quot;The Pit&quot;) tends to look unkindly upon PPC missions. At one point you could put them up, but now I believe it&#39;s against the rules. And for heaven&#39;s sake, <i>never</i> tell someone you&#39;re going to do a mission of their story.</p>

            <p>Last I checked, there was no real rule against double posting, most likely due to the way the board works and the lack of an edit function.<br><br>On the topic of My Immortal, I&#39;ve heard that someone is currently attempting to take it on, but I can&#39;t remember who. It&#39;s my opinion, however, that the entire thing needs to just be carpet bombed. This bias has absolutely nothing to do with my attempt at copy-editing the story a while back.</p>

It&#39;s so clumsily written it&#39;s barely possible to make out what&#39;s going on, which makes it more funny than squicky. It&#39;s very short, though, but I think I could work around that. Does anyone else think it&#39;s worth trying? Also, is the baby worth saving if we do? It has no possible defining characteristics, so I&#39;m not sure what should be done with it.</p>

            <p>that sounds like a very serious charge. Simpsons is funny, and different and such, but that is one subject that is too out of the box, even for them. <br><br>As for the writting itself, I&#39;d say the SPaG of this fic, could give you a reason alone for sporking it. <br><br>As for the baby... you could send it to the Department of Medical care. Then, when it had the right age, it could be send to the Department of Personnel, where it would trained to become an agent. Either that, or erase it.... permanently.<br></p>

            <p>Sadly, since it&#39;s <i>technicially</i> possible for Lisa to get pregnant, I doubt the baby could be logic-bombed out of existence like an mpreg baby could be.

            <p>Since it doesn&#39;t mention Lisa&#39;s old enough to get pregnant until after someone pointed it out to the author, maybe her sudden age-up would damage the baby sufficiently that it&#39;d be nonviable. Nobody&#39;s ever lost a baby that way in real life, so I&#39;d feel better about using that. Would result in &quot;squicked agents&quot; rather than &quot;funny&quot;, but I&#39;d be a lot more at ease with it.</p>

            <p>Well, Springfield does have a huge nuclear power plant. If Lisa is somehow exposed to the radioactive material you could say that the fetus suffered so much genetic damage that it is now unviable.<br><br>On the squicky end of that, severe genetic damage usually results in spontaneous abortion of the fetus.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m a little uncomfortable with using things which can actually cause abortion in real life to remove an inconvenient Sue child. It doesn&#39;t really seem to fit with the spirit of the PPC. (Admittedly I did have victim characters raped to death by trees, but nobody&#39;s ever had that happen to them in real life. If it was a human character doing it, I wouldn&#39;t have used that.)</p>

            <p>Wow. There are very few things I would consider bad enough to actually be funny. That story actually made the grade. Spork it!<br><br>As for the baby, this may sound slightly callous but I&#39;d argue that it shouldn&#39;t be saved. Besides having no real defining characteristics, it&#39;s the product of brother-sister incest. You might be able to argue that Medical could ensure that there are no birth defects, but that&#39;ll always be a problem in the child&#39;s backstory.</p>

            <p>... but I feel kind of bad about letting it die, even so.

            <p>I wrote up a draft of a mission involving Mpreg from a Kingdom Hearts/Nightmare Before Christmas crossover AU. It was a mess. The baby would have been the product of a vampire!Nobody and a living doll!Nobody. That&#39;s three &#39;species&#39; that don&#39;t really translate well to normal human growth. I couldn&#39;t figure out how to turn this mashup kid into something that made sense.<br><br>The idea I came up with was a &#39;Reality transfusion.&#39; Basically, one of my human agents would have had to donate a bit of their blood to Medical. They, in turn, would have used that blood to filter out the more nonsensical parts of the child&#39;s DNA. The child would end up human but still containing elements of the canonical parents.<br><br>Now that I read that out loud, it seems even dumber. Still, if you want to save the kid that bad, it&#39;s an option.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s 100% parody/sarcasm - the Flying Moose used to be one of my favourite sites way back in around 2002. It&#39;s all utter crack, but entertaining utter crack.<br><br>The synopsis, as such, is most definitely intended as humour. However, I guess it is possible some Suethors may have taken it at face value.<br><br>Check out the Tolkien Sarcasm pages. Balrogs have fluffy bedroom slippers, didn&#39;t you know?

            <p>Oh, I&#39;m <em>certain</em> it&#39;s a joke.  But I can also see someone realizing that 1) all the kewl Suethors are putting themselves in LOTR and 2) that&#39;s a very long story.  With all the other shortcuts a Suethor can take, going for the Cliff&#39;s Notes instead of actually reading the trilogy would be consistent.<br><br>(Or, whoever wrote that synopsis has also read LOTR badfic and was including &quot;tributes&quot;.)</p>
