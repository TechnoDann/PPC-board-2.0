            <p>You see, many of them were created early in the Wiki&#39;s history, and thus contain a lot of things that would be frowned upon today, including attacks on Authors, an informal tone that goes against the intention of the Wiki (example I deleted: However, Luthien, a part-Elf, part-Maia chick, and her pet dog beat him up for capturing her boyfriend Beren), and several redundancies. Not merely that, but several of them lack images (including the Sauron and Saruman pages).<br><br>I tried to fix the situation, but I ended up making a lot of mistakes as well. So I&#39;m asking for help as this seems to be too much for just me.  </p>

            <p>Mainly, I&#39;m wondering where you got the idea that being informal is frowned upon. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case. Heck, I&#39;ve heard complaints recently that pages aren&#39;t entertaining enough. Is there something saying otherwise somewhere?<br><br>Also, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything saying all pages must have images, either. They&#39;re nice, of course, but still, nothing to panic over.<br><br>It&#39;s okay to take things slow, too. Just do one article at a time, and research twice, edit once if you&#39;re worried about mistakes. Really, it&#39;s no big deal. {= )<br><br>Not that more people shouldn&#39;t help edit the wiki, of course.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s just that &#39;informal&#39; was the first word I had for it, even though it&#39;s innacurate. What I should have have said was that the earlier articles sometimes state the obvious a lot, sometimes as early as the second sentence of the article. Not merely that, but there are several understatements (reffering to Huan as merely a pet dog, which is innacurate) and overstatements. Does this clear up the confusion? <br><br>As for Images, no, not all pages should have images, but it would still be nice if there were more of them on the Wiki. You&#39;re right, I shoudn&#39;t have been panicking over them, but still, I&#39;d like a splash of color now and again.</p>

            <p>Still, that particular statement is <i>funny</i> because it&#39;s a massive understatement. I can see how someone not familiar with the continuum might be confused, but I think it&#39;d be a shame to edit out all continuum-specific humor like that. Rather, I&#39;d make sure the straight information is available somewhere, and I think the off-site links there cover that well, since we don&#39;t have or really need pages for Huan or Luthien. I&#39;d apply the same principle to any similar under- or overstatements that are used for humor.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>...I did include off-site links for Huan and Luthien on the Sauron article (though they look exactly like an in-site link for some reason). And what truly got me were the seeming trivilizations of the Kinslayings and the Sinking of Numenor, but then I remembered that those were <i>fictional</i> tragedies, and that sometimes, the understatements were intended to be Ironic. That said, many of those understatements are also used to shorten the article, to the point that the entire Numenor page consists of just one line (An island in Middle-earth which Men lived on, until it sank. Unsurprisingly, Sauron had quite a bit to do with this).<br><br>Actually, that page could be a good target for deletion, as links to Lotr.Wikia and Tolkien Gateway can supply the necessary information.    </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve looked at the Numenor page with an eye for expanding it more than once, but never did it (she said, stating the obvious). Again, I think that page is fine as it is for simple humor value; and really, what else needs to be said about Numenor? I don&#39;t think it was written that way to shorten anything, but just to convey the most pertinent information in a fun way. On the other hand, the same information could certainly be given elsewhere, like the Arda page, and still be funny. That would be a good middle ground.<br><br>I saw that Luthien and Huan are external links, actually. What I meant was they could be used with the original line, to keep the humor as well as providing more information for anyone who wants it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not as funny as the original line, IMO, but it should be less potentially confusing to an outsider. So, yeah, I guess I&#39;d accept that.

            <p>...and I don&#39;t know where to start with that. Also, if you can find Public Domain pictures of Sauron, Faramir, and other major characters, that would be great (although as mentioned above, not entirely necessary). The Denethor page is also sparse, even though he&#39;s one of the most OOC characters in LotR fic.</p>

Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve found with a little bit of research.<br><br>This appears to be the most recent <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> OFU, last updated in October:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6134663/1/Official_Fanfiction_University_of_YuGiOh"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6134663/1/Official_Fanfiction_University_of_YuGiOh">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6134663/1/Official_Fanfiction_University_of_YuGiOh</a></a><br>In chapter three, it names mini-Kuribohs (minibohs, as it calls them) as the mini for <i>Yu-Gi-OH!</i>.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6134663/3/Official_Fanfiction_University_of_YuGiOh"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6134663/3/Official_Fanfiction_University_of_YuGiOh">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6134663/3/Official_Fanfiction_University_of_YuGiOh</a></a><br><br>This does contradict our wiki, which says the mini is the signature monster of the misspelled character&#39;s name (which is clunky and complicated, and doesn&#39;t address non-dueling characters), but I can&#39;t seem to find any mention of this appearing in a mission or OFU anywhere.<br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini</a></a> (way down at the bottom)<br><br>So, to get back to your original questions, OFUs do not require permission (they once did from Miss Sandman, but she&#39;s not active anymore; might still behoove mentioning her in the opening author&#39;s note) but it&#39;s generally bad form to make a new one for a fandom that already has one.<br><br>By extension, the OFU I linked above seems to have created the first specific <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> mini, which generally means that&#39;s the one the PPC will adopt.  (I did find another, older OFU, but it only mentions minis once as mini-duel monsters, which is too general to be of much help.)<br><br>Anyone, am I in the wrong here?

            <p>The problem with this bill is that it&#39;s not written well, not that we should be able to disregard copyright and upload/watch whatever we want on YouTube or wherever. The whole point of copyright (or the equivalent law in other countries) is being able to control how the material under copyright is replicated and distributed. The owners are under absolutely no obligation to let anyone watch their show on YouTube for free.  A sense of entitlement that makes us think we shouldn&#39;t have to pay for stuff <i>is</i> a bad thing.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. This is an overly broad piece of legislation that would likely result in a fair amount of draconian abuse. However, the PPC and the OFUs would not be affected by this bill. It&#39;s questionable whether it would even threaten fanfiction as a whole.<br><br>I refer you to the Copyright Act of 1976, which sets out the four defining aspects of &#39;fair use:&#39;<br><br>&quot;In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include:<br><br>1.the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;<br><br>2.the nature of the copyrighted work;<br><br>3.the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and<br><br>4.the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.&quot;<br><br>The PPC and OFUs - and, to a lesser extent, many pieces of fanfiction - are transformative works. We parody (that is, we use a work in order to mock the work itself.) We criticize. We create our own stories and our own characters that interact with these preexisting worlds. There is enough original transformative work within the PPC and the OFUs to make the case that we would be able to stand on our own.<br><br>As I said before, SOPA is not a good bill. However, there is no sense in leveling accusations against it that are just not true. I&#39;m not an expert on law, but from the research I&#39;ve done there does not seem to be much evidence that SOPA will harm the PPC. Its aim is to target people who stream movies and music, not fanfic authors.<br><br>Sorry if this seems ranty or disjointed. I just want to see the facts come out right.</p>

            <p>Well hello to you all. I&#39;m new to this board (but not new to the concept of the PPC, I&#39;ve known about it for about 6 months). I&#39;m not a particularly good writer, but I&#39;m an almost compulsive MST&#39;er, due in part to being slightly insane, getting too used to some genres, and being a Troper. And when I say compulsive, I mean that I&#39;m doing a running commentary in my head pretty much all the time (usually not for the first instance of a story, though), even if it&#39;s just in my head. <br><br>So yah. I&#39;m a fan of fantasy and science-fiction series (Dresden, Discworld, Doctor Who), and am a complete nerd (I&#39;m a D&amp;D player). Glad to be here. </p>

            <p>And I think they had intended it that way: glorifying Shadow is a pretty common thing to do in the StH fandom according to my experiences with it. And, you know, the fact that the Phantom himself has fangirls even though he&#39;s supposed to be really ugly.</p>

            <p>This was fun to read.  Very different from most missions.  Very . . . <i>bizarre</i> badfic.  You set up the realization by your agents of the personality swap between Raoul and the Phantom very well.  (I was expecting you to keep the jerkiness of Myrin as his real attitude, and just kill him, so I was surprised to see him get recruited.)<br><br>I want to bring up something I see in your writing quite a bit.  When you&#39;re narrating a character do something, and you&#39;ve already used their name, you frequently start referring to them by some phrase.  Xanthus becomes &quot;the disguised Turian,&quot; Cindy is &quot;the former Beaxbatons student&quot; and Anneli is &quot;the female agent&quot; or some-such.  This is really clunky and detracts from the actual action.  These sentences would read a lot nicer if you used &quot;she&quot; or &quot;he&quot; instead.  If you think the readers might get confused between who you&#39;re referring to, just use their names again.</p>

            <p>Thanks! Yeah, it was a very bizarre badfic to work with, but I ended up skipping over quite a bit of it. The actual badfic is a lot more song-ficcy than the mission makes it seem, but that&#39;s only a function of utilizing the songs where thye&#39;d show up in the musical. Though, it does get a little jarring when you get closer to the end and the swapped characterizations of Raoul and the Phantom ensure that you&#39;re progressively unable to use the songs. But I think what was more criminal was that the author didn&#39;t even TRY to come up with new lyrics for stuff, and ESPECIALLY trying to come up with a replacement for the Final Lair.<br><br>Ah. I&#39;m always worried that I&#39;ll overuse a name or a pronoun, so that&#39;s why I do that. I&#39;ll curb it in the future, so thanks for pointing it out. :D</p>

            <p>Given the religious symbolism inherent in the Kings&#39; Cross scene in the last book, in which Dumbledore appears to be some angelic or perhaps deified being, surely the author was continuing the same theme with an allegorical retelling of the fall of Lucifer, perhaps some sort of cleverly-written tribute to Paradise Lost.<br>Thus we see Harry as Dumbledore&#39;s &#39;son&#39; and heir lead the armies of Heaven (or Hogwarts, which is populated by Dumbledore&#39;s students or metaphorical creations) consisting of Dumbledore&#39;s faithful followers against his fallen students the Death Eaters, led by the greatest and most powerful, Voldemort.<br><br>Not quite sure how to work in Ron being put in Azkaban for rape, though.

            <p>Specifically, it&#39;s the notorious Hetalia fic &quot;Debt&quot;, in which China mutilates England and America for no real reason. I don&#39;t know whether this would qualify as Disturbing Acts of Violence or Bad Slash, or if my assassin characters could take it. They&#39;re specifically forbidden from taking on pure Bad Slash after a nasty accident during a Gorillaz mission, but the China character is probably a replacement so they could get him under the heading of Villain Stu. Thoughts? (If they can, I have an idea for how to execute him which, while technically falling under the PPC&#39;s &quot;no torture&quot; restriction, could be &quot;fun&quot;. Then again it&#39;s probably far too quick for the creepy bastard. I&#39;m open to anyone who has suggestions.)<br><br>If my assassins can&#39;t take this mission, I&#39;m throwing it open to anyone else, because my Bad Slashers wouldn&#39;t know anything about Hetalia and making them do guro is probably a bad move.<br><br>If it does get done, I have some other questions; namely, what do we do to patch up England and America? They&#39;d be missing limbs and eyes if we got to them anywhere later than the first chapter, and Doc Fitz specifically can&#39;t regrow limbs, as seen with Ithalond, so would the agents have to collect the severed bits? And what about their eyeballs? I considered classing them as replacements, but they have the same problem Redtooth had during the spear incident, namely that they don&#39;t get a chance to actually show any character except &quot;being in extreme pain&quot; so I don&#39;t think it counts.<br><br>Also, a question about the workings of Hetalia; we know from canon that harm done to the country as a whole harms the nation&#39;s representative, as seen when England gets a cold because of economy problems, but does it work the other way? I don&#39;t know if this is ever mentioned in canon. It&#39;s mentioned in the fic that the harm done to the representatives caused an increase in violent crime in their respective countries, but if that does work, then considering canon portrayed both World Wars as about as serious as a paintball game, I&#39;m pretty sure something much worse should be happening.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m thinking the China character is a replacement. Sure, in canon China has gotten angry before (he broke holes through several walls when he got fed up in one episode), but he would never go so far as to do what that China in the fic does. (Sure, I only read the first chapter, but I think that&#39;s enough to understand his behavior...) I would suggest not too violent of an execution, however.  <br><br>As to workings within Hetalia, I don&#39;t think the harm done to America and England would cause spikes in violent crime. Considering that such an incident would probably never come up besides in this fic I would think that it wouldn&#39;t affect the country. My theory tends to be that scars and serious wounds and the like are usually representative of actual events such as battles and perhaps large national tragedies (I do believe China has a large scar on his back from a war with Japan), and that it would probably not occur the other way around. Most people would probably agree along those lines (though other fans correct me if I&#39;m wrong). That help some? </p>

I&#39;m sick of them.<br><br>For that matter I&#39;ve been really weirded out with some of your recent work, though since you&#39;d been here longer I felt kind of uncomfortable saying anything. I don&#39;t know if that was your intention or not, but it was the end effect and it really made me reconsider what I wanted to see out of not only your stuff but my own, and PPC work in general.<br><br>This isn&#39;t the best place for it so that&#39;s all I&#39;m going to say, but I&#39;d really prefer to talk some more about this and voice concerns if you&#39;re willing to chat more privately.<br><br><br>Now, all that nasty stuff said, considering that Hetalia IS a light canon the best solution would be a light one. If you can&#39;t just repair the eyes and the fic argues that harm done is represented by crime, then replace England&#39;s eyes with security cameras--wouldn&#39;t be hard for DoSAT to gin up some mini-sized ones. Blink, and they&#39;re back to being eyes, and you get a solid Britisher joke out of it too.<br><br>Limbs can probably just be reattached by Medical, but a similar analogy can likely be drawn if not to go with the crime theme. Represent the restoration of a &quot;long arm of the law&quot; with like a taser or pepper spray.<br><br>And while I&#39;m making suggestions, since Villain Stus are so rare, I think the Medical Study subsection would adore you if you could capture the China replacement alive instead of straight killing him.

            <p>Someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I think Ithalond couldn&#39;t get his hands back because he was an OC, while Medical has a much easier time getting canon characters back to full health because that&#39;s their appointed, canon state.  It&#39;s the same reason Medical can bring dead canons back to life, but not agents; the true author&#39;s influence over the canon character is on Doc Fitz&#39;s side, helping put the canon back the way they belong.</p>

            <p>Such a crossover wouldn&#39;t involve any Scott Pilgrim plot or characters- merely the storytelling, themes, and ideas. Presenting Mass Effect in the style of Scott Pilgrim, using that kind of goofy humor to parody it... that might be kind of fun....</p>

            <p>Hmm, its not the worst fan fic I&#39;ve read.  However, its far from the best.  My only real problem with it is the action scenes, which are poorly described and the fact that I really, really don&#39;t like first person narration.<br><br>Still I must agree, why did they choose Mass Effect and Scott Pilgrim? True they are both quite excellent and the idea of Scott Vs. Shepard is a very entertaining one, but the whole plot thing feels odd and a little absurd.</p>

            <p>I swear I&#39;ll become Lord of the Question Treads by the end of the year if I keep this up.<br><br>Anyhow, I&#39;m starting to formulate a story for a prospective Intelligence Agent and I was wondering what I should read to get me up to speed on the workings of that Department. I&#39;ve read the wiki pages and all available reports but I&#39;d still like to know more. There doesn&#39;t seem to be much canon for Intel, and even less active agents. I figure there is a reason for that (who wants to read the adventures of Bob, the guy reading stuff in the Sorting Room anyways?), but is there anything I should read to gain insight into DoI? </p>

            <p>Agents work in whatever structure works for them. Really, it&#39;s up to the spin-off. There&#39;s been at least one spin-off that have had one agent as mission control, or stayed at the RC while the others went off to duty...

            <p>Generally speaking, there are supposed to be two agents (at least) in the field together for reasons of one being there to restrain the other if a lust object comes in view, or if they completely lose it; or to help each other if they get hurt or attacked.<br><br>It&#39;s also because it&#39;s really, really hard to write an entertaining story with only one person there to do the snarking. It&#39;s much easier with at least two people to share in the experience and bounce reactions and dialogue back and forth.<br><br>Mithiriel isn&#39;t a very good example: she wasn&#39;t an official agent at all, let alone an action agent, and Ithalond was always with Suicide. Now that Suicide is partnered with Diocletian again, Mithiriel <i>is</i> an active agent, and does go into the field with her husband.<br><br>Not that solo missions haven&#39;t happened (Architeuthis&#39; Intel spin-off is an example of doing it well), but it&#39;s really generally not advised for the in- and ex-universe reasons above. Also, I can&#39;t really imagine a harmonious partnership resulting from one person going into the rough and tumble of the field while the other one got to stay at home and sip tea or whatever.

            <p>Hey all you people who volunteered to help with the Sue pages! It&#39;s time for us to get to work. Since it&#39;s up to us how to do this, I figured I&#39;d put some initial ideas down here.<br><br>I think what we should do, as far as evaluation goes, is look at each page and first decide a) if the Sue or Stu is noteworthy or particularly unique and b) if the page needs cleanup. Original Series Sues are of course exempt from part A; although not all of them are particularly original, consensus seems to be that they are a big enough part of our shared canon so as to be noteworthy. If one thinks that a Sue or Stu page does not meet the criteria to be &quot;noteworthy,&quot; than I think a review by a couple of the others working on the pages to see if they draw the same conclusion, and if everyone agrees, than the page becomes a Candidate for Deletion.<br><br>I figure that we should coordinate by email. If you all agree, I&#39;ll post my email here.<br><br>If a page is considered noteworthy, but needs a re-write, well, I don&#39;t have any real ideas about how to go about doing so.<br><br>What do you guys think about this plan? </p>

            <p>I like the idea of the Sue suffix. I think that might be a community issue though. As for division, I say we should all take a chunk. As long as one person (whose in this &quot;group&quot;) says we should keep a page, I say we air on the side of caution and keep it. I can divide them up if none of you want to. As for coordination, I&#39;m seeing the talk page as the most popular spot to do this.</p>

            <p>Sounds good.  Should we divide up the pages among us, or just all tackle them all at once?<br><br>Also, as a suggestion, I&#39;d like to name all Sue&amp;Stu pages in &quot;Sue&#39;s Name (Sue)&quot; format.  When randomly browsing around the wiki, it can be difficult to differentiate Sue pages from Agent pages by their name alone, and I think marking all of them &quot;(Sue)&quot; would just be helpful.<br><br>Personally I wouldd prefer to communicate by email, if only because the computer I usually use won&#39;t allow me to edit pages for some reason, and if I want to do that I have to switch to the Mac (which isn&#39;t actually difficult, it&#39;s just kind of annoying).  However, using the talk page would be fine if that&#39;s what people prefer.</p>

            <p>An alternative to emails, could be using the talk page for the Slain Mary Sue category, but otherwise I&#39;m game.<br><br>If a Sue-page is noteworthy, but needs a re-write, then if the agents&#39; boarder is still active, we could perhaps ask her/him to do the expansion. Otherwise we can figure it out on a case-by-case basis.</p>

            <p>Hello! Sorry if a lot of the boarders don&#39;t recognize me, I&#39;m not the most active on the board itself, although I was a fixture in the IRC for a few months - although I&#39;ve been absent from that lately as well. Leaving the IRC was catalyzed by some incompatible personalities, but it wasn&#39;t solely caused by it. I like the people of the PPC in general, and you guys helped me get into fanfic a bit (I&#39;m even writing one now, although it is sadly neglected in favor of my art usually), but there are a few issues that I&#39;ve noted with the PPC that made it hard to get enthusiastic about fully participating in.<br><br>Please don&#39;t just dismiss this as an outsider who didn&#39;t fit in trolling, even if it&#39;s unavoidable some people see it that way. Nothing I say here is meant to be spiteful, and there is no bitterness intended - this is a post of constructive criticism that I hope at least gives you guys some food for thought.<br><br>Here is my parting criticism of the PPC:<br><br>=============================================================<br>(1) Inflexible Adherence to the &#39;Way Things Have Always Been&#39;<br>=============================================================<br><br>I&#39;m I&#39;m not the only one in the community that is bothered at the fact that so many rules are dictated by people who are no longer part of the community. The board continues to use highly dated, difficult to moderate and impossible to categorize technology that shows it&#39;s age everyday that the first page is dominated by permission requests and welcome threads, hounded by fears that the community will &#39;divide&#39; with as simple a move as changing board technologies. Old standbys continue to see the PPC as just a small informal group of friends rather than a large, diverse group that will unavoidably divide. Lacking the ability to facilitate those natural tendencies just mean it stagnates and discourages new blood. The community seems to be fine with that, and some even actively encourage that viewpoint. The IRC channel is one of the most active PPC hubs, and it is barely granted any legitimacy by the &#39;core&#39; community that exists on the board. <br><br>The PPC has also grown to a large number of departments whose missions cover a wide range of genres, canons, story types, characters, etc, but the Original Series is still required reading, even for people who have no interest in killing Mary Sues, and with only passing interest in Lord of the Rings. There is this paradoxical attitude in the PPC that you shouldn&#39;t work too hard to follow old continuity but you should definitely follow all this old continuity. <br><br><br>============================================<br>(2) Ferocious defense of the term &#39;Mary Sue&#39; <br>============================================<br><br>This section could also just be section 1.1, as it is really just an aspect of that inflexible adherence I talk about above. <br><br>Lemme just link you something that actually prompted this post: <br><a href="http://adventuresofcomicbookgirl.tumblr.com/post/13913540194/mary-sue-what-are-you-or-why-the-concept-of-sue-is"><a href="http://adventuresofcomicbookgirl.tumblr.com/post/13913540194/mary-sue-what-are-you-or-why-the-concept-of-sue-is">http://adventuresofcomicbookgirl.tumblr.com/post/13913540194/mary-sue-what-are-you-or-why-the-concept-of-sue-is</a></a><br><br>This is a wonderfully worded essay on why Mary Sue is a loaded, sexist term. I am well aware that there will be a big wave of defense to come rushing to using the term Mary Sue, a pattern I&#39;ve seen with similar posts in the past that have been done with less effective execution, but this essay really sold me on it. All of the regular arguments PPCers use to defend the term Mary Sue - that they perpetuate negative stereotypes, that they are boring characters - these are all soundly defeated in this essay by pointing out that those traits can all be pointed out /individually/ and so there&#39;s no reason to use a gendered, ambiguous and loaded term to describe such characters. <br><br>The PPC has a huge wiki full of invented terms, gadgets characters... it is a very insular community with a large learning curve to participate in, so it really wouldn&#39;t be a big deal to come up with a new term to label the canon-warping monsters that center around PPC missions, save for the point argued above. It doesn&#39;t even have to be something fancy, something as generic as &#39;anomalies&#39; would work. <br><br><br>            ============<br>and finally (3) Elitism<br>            ============<br><br>People should be familiar with the TvTropes debacle, where Laburnum and Tawaki posted many links on TvTropes with examples of characters or storylines from their missions. Several people in the IRC took it upon themselves to have these links removed because they were attracting the &#39;wrong&#39; kind of people to the PPC. TvTropes disliked this and reverted all changes, arguing that Laburnum and Tawaki&#39;s characters are legitimate parts of the PPC canon and were using valid examples.<br><br>The obvious next step would be to put /more/ examples on TvTropes that gave a better general indication of what the PPC was about - an idea that was denied because we apparently don&#39;t think the people that browse TvTropes are /worthy/ of being PPCers, or alternatively that we just want to stay small and hidden. Both of these are very indicative of an arrogance in the PPC community, especially one that is supposed to stand for improving the writing community in general. If it turns down opportunities to grow larger and spread it&#39;s message to a wider audience, then is it really an organization to help people write, or is it just a small group of people that are maliciously picking on 13-year-olds&#39; wish-fulfillment stories, and then putting their fingers in their ears when any criticism is levied at them for it?<br><br>It also highlights this paradoxical attitude of the PPC where it can&#39;t decide if it wants to be a unified, rigid canon or just a kind of loose collection of lighthearted writing exercises. Everything about the PPC seems to indicate the latter until somebody does something &#39;wrong.&#39;<br><br>I will make a point to say I don&#39;t think anyone in the PPC is being mean on purpose, or willfully trying to exclude people, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that I think unidentified elitism does exist in the PPC, and steps should be taken to recognize and address it. <br><br><br><br>****************<br><br><br>Now that that&#39;s out of the way, just wanted to say that I did enjoy my time here, so thanks for all the fun times. Even if you just eye-roll my post and go on with what your doing, I hope you have fun with it and good luck. <br><br>I bid you adieu. </p>

            <p>I could certainly go into a long essay on this (and I might later), but on this point:<br><br><i>All of the regular arguments PPCers use to defend the term Mary Sue - that they perpetuate negative stereotypes, that they are boring characters - these are all soundly defeated in this essay by pointing out that those traits can all be pointed out /individually/ and so there&#39;s no reason to use a gendered, ambiguous and loaded term to describe such characters.</i><br><br>Of course all of Mary Sue&#39;s traits can be pointed out individually. But that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s not a good reason to use one term. When certain literary components appear in conjunction with each other time and time again in works of fiction (and in real life), it is useful for people to sort them into categories for ease of discussion. Isn&#39;t that what TV Tropes is all about?<br><br>I can&#39;t prove that the term isn&#39;t ambiguous and loaded, but I&#39;d be surprised if someone could prove that it <i>was</i>. All points in that essay are well-made, but not that hard to refute. And I&#39;d be <i>very</i> astonished if someone could prove that it was both loaded and ambiguous at the same time. Either &quot;Mary Sue&quot; has a meaning that everyone knows about (loaded), or it has a meaning that no one really knows about (ambiguous). <br><br>As for making up a  new term only to be used by the PPC...wouldn&#39;t that go directly against your suggestion of making the PPC more accessible to new people, especially people who come from places like TV Tropes where the Mary Sue term is widely used? (It would also imply that we are somehow ashamed of having used the term in the past, which would come with a stigma and language-drift barrier attached to older PPC writings. Yay, difficult for newbies and offensive to oldbies at the same time!)<br><br>Sorry that you&#39;re leaving us, though. Hope you find another fun place online!<br><br>~Araeph</p>

It&#39;s just jargon, and were there a push to change the term used, I have problem with adapting my vocabulary as long as the newer term had a convenient way to shorten it.<br><br>(Warning: tl;dr may follow.)<br><br>What I am on about, is that I&#39;d like to point out that hS&#39;s poll/survey/whatever earlier this year did indicate that a majority of us do want some kind of change to the layout in some way, and roughly two thirds of us want to leave this board all together. And then nothing happened. Until about two or three months ago this got brought up in the IRC, a big discussion happened, about why a change to basically any kind of board other than this one was a bad idea, and ultimately nothing came of it. Except for the fact that I started to notice a few trends every time the subject comes up (aside from absolutely nothing happening).<br><br>As far as I can gather, the major arguments against moving to a newer board, or even better a proper forum system are thus:<br>-We can&#39;t change the links to this board on some older sites/this is the place returning oldbies know to come to. (Easily solved by placing a large, noticeable link on the top saying &#39;The new home of the PPC is here&#39; or something like that, and having someone come back here occasionally and adding trash responses to old topics to make sure this board doesn&#39;t get deleted due to inactivity.)<br>-Forums and organization will fracture the community. (Proper organization can neatly dodge that problem, but if people are still unsure about that, then there&#39;s no problem with just having a single forum with a multitude of threads. Also, this one pretends like there&#39;s not already a split between people like me who mainly frequent the IRC and people who avoid it entirely. If anything, a better board would pull some of us back. I know it would for me.)<br>-Topics dropping off the front page is a good thing. (I actually had to have the logic behind that explained to me, and I still don&#39;t agree with it. It indicates a lack of trust in the community to know when to drop a subject, which is troubling. There&#39;s also the nice little bit where newbies who make too many threads too soon, or people who make multiple badfic threads when there&#39;s already one near the top get yelled at <i>because</i> doing that pushes topics off of the front page.)<br>-Authority is bad, and we&#39;d have to have moderators and stuff. (Admittedly this is a newer one, but it&#39;s possibly the most troubling of all of them, as it indicates either a lack of trust in your fellow PPCer and their likelyhood to not abuse their power, a lack of trust in the community to not not be jealous of those with the modpower, or that there is such little trust in the IRC that having mods (or, well, A mod at the moment) and designated arbitrators is fine for them but heaven forbid we add those to the board. Also? This one is nearly a direct quote. There was a long discussion on why mods are or are not a bad thing, and how one would go about selecting said mods. I made quite a few stupid suggestions, but ultimately I&#39;d think that elections like we do for the PGs or DAs would work fine.)<br><br>So yeah. There have been other arguments, but those are the ones that spring to mind, and the last one is really the only one without a real solution. Topics not dropping has a variety of solutions from locking or deleting old topics, to making it so that new posts don&#39;t bump topics, to simply getting a new board that does drop the topics after a time. I would like note that even though I may not remember all of the arguments against moving, I do remember that a surprising number of them had me going &quot;Really? Do you have so little faith in the community/your fellow PPCers?&quot; which is something that should probably be addressed. Of course, given my lack of faith in the community&#39;s ability to <i>not</i> sart or get involved in drama, maybe I&#39;m just being a bit hypocritical.<br><br>This does however lead me into another... well, I&#39;d say point, but at the rate I&#39;m typing, it&#39;ll probably be a rant.<br>There is, as DS pointed out, a certain dismissive attitude about the IRC. I, myself, have been told by boarders to not mention the IRC&#39;s problems here, because you lot didn&#39;t want drama here. That&#39;s all fine and dandy, but if I actually bother to come here, it&#39;s usually because I was directed here. And if I actually bother to mention problems? It&#39;s because they affect the whole community. Or at least, they should. Just because I mention that something was brought up on the IRC does not make it &quot;an IRC problem&quot;. We are not separate communities. Or at least, we shouldn&#39;t be. However, the IRC is continuously treated like it&#39;s somehow inferior or separate from the board, despite it being <i>the</i> most active hub in the PPC and just as important and legitimate as the board. To provide a reversed example, this would be like if people said that the IRC was the only thing that really mattered, and the board was just a bulletin board for updates and the occasional idle conversation. The each hub for our community is just as important as the other, and people need to start acting like it. I don&#39;t avoid the board because I think it&#39;s not important. I avoid it because it uses outdated software that became obsolete well before dial-up did, and because the host of problems I see with it (Which I fully recognize some people see as advantages for one reason or another) show its age every time I visit. Which are entirely stupid reasons, I know, but my point is that it&#39;s not because of any lack of respect for the board&#39;s importance. Similarly, avoiding the IRC because it&#39;s unimportant is stupid and wrong. Avoiding it because you have problems with the technology is still stupid, but forgivable as long as you&#39;re aware of how important it is.<br><br>Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have to go back to avoiding the board like a plague, and praying that I don&#39;t recall any of what I&#39;ve done tonight once I sober up.<br><br>Incidentally, SkyyRum, while an amusing pun, is a terrible idea when you&#39;re a light-wieght like me.</p>

            <p>Hey, DS.  Just want to say we were sorry to hear about you leaving, but if that is your decision then good luck and don&#39;t be afraid to stop by every once in a while.<br><br>Now, on to the points.<br><br>1) Inflexible Adherence to the &#39;Way Things Have Always Been&#39;<br><br>What we do here in the PPC is write fanfic.  We right fanfic of the Original Series.  As a community, we believe that when we write fanfiction, we need to leave the world in as good a condition as when we got there, as if we were visiting someone&#39;s house.  This is why the Original Series is required reading.  It is our canon.  It sets the rules for the universe.  I don&#39;t see a problem with insisting that everyone read TOS before writing PPC stories.  It is like insisting that someone read the Harry Potter series before writing fanfiction of that.  It is something that we advocate in the community.<br><br>As for the out-dated tech on the Board, it is not a matter of fragmentation of the group.  It is the fact that there is a growing number of PPC-related sites that link to the board, that we don&#39;t have access to change.  There is also the point that it is a good thing that posts can fall off the front page, and don&#39;t get resurrected every time someone posts in them.  Neshomeh would like it known that she also doesn&#39;t like the idea of separate sections for separate topics, as that is a surefire way to fragment the group.<br><br>The paradox you mentioned is an oversimplification of the message.  It should say, &quot;Know where you are coming from before you venture off the road.&quot;  We encourage people to explore, but if you are exploring Africa (writing original fic) and calling it Asia (the PPC), then there is a problem.<br><br>Phobos would like to note that he agrees that there is a lot of inflexibility in some members of the PPC, but that the community balances that with people who would like to burn everything down and start from scratch.  He thinks it comes out to a happy medium most of the time.<br><br>2) Ferocious defense of the term &#39;Mary Sue&#39;<br><br>We don&#39;t use the TV Tropes definition, so we don&#39;t know that the article you linked really applies in this situation.  However, we would like to address a few of the things that were mentioned in it.<br><br>We hold male and female characters to the same standard in the PPC.  Are they too powerful for the canon?  Did they gain this power for no reason?  Does everyone inexplicably adore them within two seconds of meeting them?  Probably a Sue/Stu.  One of the most important things in our definition of a Sue/Stu is that it doesn&#39;t follow the rules of the world it is in.  Batman has many Stuish traits, but he is in a world where that sort of thing happens all the time.  <br><br>Phobos is fond of saying that Sues/Stus can be written well, unpopular though that position is in the PPC.  He says, if it looks like a duck (Sue/Stu), sounds like a duck, and acts like a duck, then it is probably a duck.  If the duck is in a pond, do we care that the duck is where it is?  No.  However, we do care if we see a duck in a dungeon.  It is out of place.<br><br>Batman is a Stu.  We don&#39;t care because the rules of the world tell us that his level of Stuishness is acceptable.  The villains in his world are usually at or above his level.  If Batman were in an episode of NCIS he would be out of place because he has all of these advantages that don&#39;t exist in that world.<br><br>[We see that, as we were writing this, there was an exchange between you and Alleydodger.  We would like to address a couple of points you brought up there as well.]<br><br>To say that there are no other literary archetypes that use gender specific names is patently untrue.  A clear example is the Wizard/Witch archetype.  Additional point about this archetype, there is no standard definition.  Sometimes they aren&#39;t even related concepts at all.  Other examples are Hero/Heroine, Priest/Priestess, the Judas, the Jezebel and the Benedict Arnold (the last three are other examples of people&#39;s names being used as an archetype).<br><br>As for the assertion that people in circles other than ours use the term Mary Sue as an insult and thus no one should use it, we disagree.  People use the term Gay as an insult all the time.  However, the Gay community continues to use it and has even run ad campaigns to educate the public as to the correct usage of the word.  We believe that this is a more productive way of dealing with this issue than just coming up with a different word that means the same thing.  The baggage will travel with the definition and we will be having this same discussion in the future.  (So, you think these powerful, beautiful, female characters are anomalies?  That is sexist!)<br><br>3) Elitism<br><br>We&#39;re not sure if you were around during the TV Tropes editing spree, but Neshomeh was, and she&#39;d like to clarify what actually went on there as she recalls.<br><br>It had nothing to do with tropers being &quot;unworthy&quot; and everything to do with the fact that people actually were showing up with the wrong idea of what the PPC was about, and it was getting kind of ugly around here. Namely, there a series of incidents involving people focusing on finding squickier and squickier fics to spork, and creating more and more tricked out, uber-powerful, Sue/Stuish agents. We determined that people were getting that idea from the high prevalence of links to Tawaki and Laburnum&#39;s stories with little else to balance them, so we set about trying to correct the matter. We weren&#39;t just deleting things--we went trope by trope and asked ourselves, &quot;Does this relate to the group as a whole? If yes, let&#39;s add more examples of the trope.&quot; We only deleted things that really had little to do with the PPC as a whole and only appeared in one or two spin-offs.<br><br>Also, it was about this time that we started writing the Guide to the PPC and FAQ for Newbies, and all that other educational material. The learning curve you mentioned had been made much steeper thanks to uneven representation on TVT, and we reacted by trying to level it out. We did this not because we wanted to discourage people from joining, but because we wanted the people finding us to have an accurate idea of what they were joining. [/Neshomeh]<br><br>We are wondering where you got the idea that PPCers don&#39;t like Tropers.  It seems to us that a large number of PPCers <i>are</i> Tropers.  If Tropers were undesirable, then we would probably tell them to leave when they introduced themselves as such.  As it is, they get lavished with the same gifts that non-Tropers do.  Can you clarify where the community has been anti-Troper?<br><br>As for how we intend to continue to grow and spread our message, we seem to be doing just fine at the moment.  We had a boom of newbies in the past week, which was mind-boggling.  The message is getting out there and people are continuing to find us.  One of the people who found us (a few months back) was the person who edited Cupcakes.  They were well received and stuck around a while to talk.<br><br>4)... ... ...nope, that&#39;s about it.<br><br>That is our side of things.  Sorry this is so long, but we felt that this stuff needed to be said.<br><br>We don&#39;t bear you any ill will and we are both sad to see you go.  Phobos is actually proud that you came back long enough to post this.  We will be having a word with anyone that insults you over this.<br><br>We&#39;ll talk to you later,<br>Phobos and Neshomeh</p>

            <p>You are right, we did screw up on that one.  This post had two authors, and we were thinking of different things.  We should have reread that better.<br><br>Now, a little clarification on the fragmentation issue.<br><br>The reason I don&#39;t believe it is a matter of fragmenting the group is that the group is already doing a wonderful job of that, itself.  There is already a Boarders vs Chatters mentality, which comes from both sides.  I&#39;ve heard Boarders say that the Chat is a hotbed of drama and that the Board is the main hub of the PPC.  I&#39;ve heard Chatters say the Board is irrelevant and that the Chat is the main hub of the PPC.  It is not a problem with technology, it is a problem with people.</p>

            <p>The idea that the PPC doesn&#39;t like tropers probably comes from the reaction on both the Board and the IRC by a couple of members to new people who announce that they&#39;re here from TVTropes, and that they consider themselves tropers. It&#39;s not always as welcoming as it could be, to the point that one newbie was greeted with something along the lines of &quot;Leave the tropes on TV Tropes, because we&#39;re not very fond of Tropers, or tropes.&quot; The newbie in question stuck around, but that&#39;s beside the point.</p>

            <p>That is a good point.  A few people are not fans of Tropers.  However, one or two peoples&#39; opinions shouldn&#39;t dictate the PPC&#39;s stance on anything.  That&#39;s why we had the discussion and vote about the Sue and author pages recently, among other things.</p>

            <p>True. I just wanted to clarify why someone could think that the PPC itself had a problem with tropers, especially since quite a few of the issues we&#39;ve had, specifically some of the ones July mentioned in her post below, happened either before a lot of people&#39;s time or while they weren&#39;t around.</p>

            <p>I was actually in the process of starting a wiki article about TV Tropes before this thread started, and wanted to put my head together with some other folks who were around for the editing spree to get the most complete picture of what all went on. It has struck me as kind of odd that we haven&#39;t had an article about TV Tropes before, and it definitely deserves one since we get so many people from there now.

            <p>It had to have been 2010 or more recent. I joined in February of 2010, and I was in on this.  I really think Caddy-shack was involved, too, and he joined after I did (pretty sure he was one of those tropers that came over before the edits.)</p>

A friend I introduced said something as a joke and the reaction to it, which was basically a &quot;WHAT THE HECK?! YOU&#39;RE WRONG!!&quot; scared him off, as he hasn&#39;t posted anything since. I also saw someone make a joke saying that what we were doing basically was the definition of uncool, and some one else jump on them a bit.<br><br>In the past few weeks I have actually wondered though, if we are the &quot;good guys&quot;.Maybe with a bit of an attitude change everything will be good again.<br><br>See you when things improve I guess.

            <p>When the PPC2 incident came to surface, and you were involved in that, the official line from the PPC2 crowd was that the channel was a &quot;drama-free zone&quot; or something like that, and not totally about July, who had the temerity to try to impose the Rules on the IRC. When July and I and others had collated a trove of evidence and incidents to show that there was an anti-authority group of people out for her, it was deflected as paranoia and that it was really just to have a place to &quot;hang&quot;.<br><br>Now you admit that it was about July after all? I can&#39;t think of any other reading of your post. I appreciate your honesty I guess, but I don&#39;t appreciate dredging this thing up again. People have been attacking July for what feels like all of this year, and now as your departing shot you decide to kick that hornet&#39;s nest over again, implicitly (if not explicitly) fingering her as one of the reasons for you quitting, further fuelling the ridiculous yet persistent meme that July is Mean and Evil and the only thing wrong with the community.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not fair to single July out as &#39;the only thing wrong with the community,&#39; but she is indeed one of the main reasons I&#39;m leaving - if just because she&#39;s taken it upon herself to snipe at me anytime she ever speaks to me. And the large amount of time that she just ignores me, it&#39;s a constant ticking timebomb on how long it takes until she can&#39;t bear to listen to me before she decides she needs to put me in my place.<br><br>I would, and have, tried to figure out what her problem with me is, but she had just decided I&#39;m only worth the time it takes to form as biting and cruel sentences as she can to dismiss me. From what I&#39;ve seen July rarely sees any kind of discouragement by the community not to do that, so it&#39;s pretty obvious they&#39;ve chosen July over me (which I don&#39;t fault them for - she&#39;s an older member and far more active). I have heard of and watched many incidents of July just deciding that someone isn&#39;t PPC material and taking it upon herself to drive them out, which just makes me more upset that I&#39;m apparently being equated to people like Joe. <br><br>I am not informed enough (as July loves to frequently point out) to say with authority to what extent July has negatively impacted the positive attitude of the chat, but it is my personal opinion that she has in fact negatively impacted the atmosphere of the chat. That her behavior has been left unchecked and even encouraged isn&#39;t her fault, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that she is one of the primary reasons that I&#39;m leaving. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m seeing the same thing as Neshomeh here. I&#39;m pretty sure DS and July had trouble getting along and were clashing over issues that had nothing to do with PPC2 and the imposition of rules over the IRC channel. Hell, I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m one of those &quot;anit-authoritarians&quot; you&#39;re talking about, and I can tell you that there was annoyance, (and maybe outright anger) at more people than July. <br><br>You say you have read the logs and &quot;gathered evidence.&quot; If you have, you know then that there was a lot of nasty stuff said about VM as well as July.

It&#39;s the only literary archetype that does so and we should be moving away from anything that does.<br><br>And that doesn&#39;t change the fact that in many circles /other/ than the ones you are familiar with, Mary Sue is frequently used much more disparagingly specifically just against female characters (and their authors), and their male counterpart is argued not to even exist. <br><br>For a community that prides itself on exactness of language, why is it building itself on a word that has no standard definition?</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a pair of words. It doesn&#39;t /have/ to be gendered, it just is because it happens to be a name. As for the standard definition, I&#39;m assuming that is /exactly why/ the PPC made its own for use in determining whether a character is fit to be &#39;killed&#39;. The reason it&#39;s persisted so long as a &#39;gendered&#39; term is likely because most of them are, in fact, female, and the male counterpart is much less common in fanfiction. Not nonexistent, just seen less often.<br><br>There&#39;s also a nice little history of the term and its use on a little site called...*gasp* TV Tropes. Now, what /I/ would like to know is WHY TV Tropes is such a hive of scum and villainy. It&#39;s a place where these little commonly used story devices called tropes are logged as they appear in various media. It&#39;s not like letting them know about the PPC will bring in a flood of trolls, at least no more than any other place on the internet. Certain people have been rather unreasonable about this, as some who frequent the IRC may know.<br><br>I&#39;ll be honest, I agree with your points a fair bit, Socrates. If the goal of the PPC is to improve writing on the internet, then why preclude anyone from being involved with it just because they come from a place that some boarders don&#39;t like? I may be misunderstanding something somewhere along the line, but it really does seem very silly. By which I mean counterproductive.<br><br>If I misunderstood something or, dare I say it, am /wrong/ in any way, feel free to tell me what and/or how. I will gladly listen to what others have to say, and not backtrack or try to cover it up or flat out /ignore/ them.<br><br>Forgive me if I sound too harsh at times. This whole situation has me far from amused.</p>

            <p>(Incidentally, you don&#39;t really have to go &#39;Certain people&#39; when it&#39;s one person being loud and the one person is me. I am really not bothered by being outright named dropped when people think I am in the wrong.)<br><br>As Neshomeh and Phobos already noted, one of the main problems with TVTropes is that we were getting a lot of people from there who didn&#39;t really have a clue about what the PPC was about. So we had people who thought it was about bashing on fic and fic writers, about upstaging the Sues and Stus with our own, or using supremely bad fics that were bad in terms of content rather than quality. <br><br>Beyond that, we also got a couple people who were just entirely unpleasant and creepy, and had to be forcibly ejected from the chatroom after making pedophilic remarks at an underage boarder in the case of one, and the other making multiple hate based comments- not about fictional characters, but about races of people, and women, and so on.<br><br>This is the sort of stuff we were seeing from people coming from TvTropes. Not from general newbies, mind you, but people who were explicitly stating they were from TvTropes.<br><br>The other thing with Tropers, is that the ones who are really hardcore cases- read every single page, get heavily invested- is that they have a tendency to forget what makes a story a story, and see only the tropes and nothing else.<br><br>This makes for mediocre writing at best, and something that&#39;s a barely tacked together pile of building blocks at worst. <br><br>The PPC is not based on seeing the building blocks and categorizing them. It&#39;s based on writing, and how those elements are being used- and if they&#39;re being used badly. <br><br>Tropes don&#39;t make that distinction.<br><br>It&#39;s a massive difference between qualitative and quantitative. Just because you know what a thing is, it doesn&#39;t mean you know how to use it, or how to identify if when it&#39;s being used it&#39;s bad or not in a qualitative sense. <br><br>Writing and analyzing are two different things, and being able to do the second- or at least be under the presumption that knowing the vocabulary means you do- does not translate into writing or stories. <br><br>Being a writer involves thinking on your own, to an extent, and being able to turn things into a chain of interlinked events, or an examination of thoughts, or a scene.  You can&#39;t tap a few tropes and expect it to turn into a story by stacking them together. Elements do not a story make. </p>

            <p>As Duo said, that /is/ better than the last time, but still, it kinda irks me that you put all of the tropers into one category and that&#39;s it. I mean that:<br>a) That&#39;s kinda hypocritical - you&#39;re saying that categorisation is a problem, then you go and categorise a few thousand people (at the very least) into a single, no exceptions category. <br>b) This is especially irksome since there are tropers who are good writers (I don&#39;t say me, because I&#39;m not, but Wozzy is a good example for a good writer that is also a troper).<br><br>So, to conclude, what you&#39;re saying is both poorly worded and not 100% correct.<br><br>(PS: I&#39;m not bashing you, July; I don&#39;t have anything personal against you. It&#39;s just that what you say bothers me.)<br>(PPS: No argumentum ad hominem intended. If that is the case, I apologise.)</p>

            <p>Obviously, I can&#39;t ask for permission yet, but would you lovely people be willing to check out my characters for me? Just so I don&#39;t die of anxiety? Thanks.<br><br>The Scribe: The Scribe is a 200-some-odd-year-old female Time Lord from the Doctor Who plot continuum who lived during a short period of time before the Time War. She had found a plot hole caused by the sudden influx of badfic from the reboot of the series in 2005. Curious, she flew her TARDIS in, crashed in the PPC lobby, and was subsequently recruited. Her TARDIS died soon afterwards, as the rift energy in any universe will not be compatible with a TARDIS from a different universe (as evidenced in Rise of the Cybermen, if you were wondering).<br><br>The Scribe, after six months of grief and much therapy due to the death of her TARDIS, then cannibalized the parts to modify her console and other technology in her room.<br><br>As of now, The Scribe has no knowledge of the Time War, and has no idea that most of her race is dead.<br><br>The Scribe was named so because of her way with words and her, quite frankly, rather amazing reliability as a minutes-taker during meetings.<br><br>While The Scribe does not have any amazing powers other than the general Time Lord power of regeneration, she does have a sonic pen and a permanent case of indigestion. She claims that the sonic pen is quite useful, since she can “write and sonic things at the same time!” She does not offer any comments on the indigestion.<br><br>The Scribe is a touch awkward around people, but her excitable personality and mad ideas (read: Very Bad Ideas) make her rather endearing. She is a huge stickler for SPaG, hates Mary Sues with a passion, and absolutely hates squick.<br><br>She is a fan of Harry Potter, Naruto, Maximum Ride (before the series jumped the shark), Artemis Fowl, Uglies, A Series of Unfortunate Events, and His Dark Materials.<br><br>As of now, this is her third regeneration. She currently has spiky hair that she dyes every week (blue at the moment), tan skin, and a tattoo of a butterfly on her back. The Scribe generally wears dark-colored vests with frayed, denim, thigh-length shorts.<br><br>Lisa Frick: Lisa is a thirteen-year-old background character from an unpublished Suefic (written by me when I was eight), which was set in the Young Wizards continuum. She had exactly six sentences of ‘screen’ time. When this fic was deleted from the world by the author, most original characters were also deleted. For reasons unknown to everyone but that physics professor down the hall, Lisa was instead dumped into the PPC universe.<br><br>Lisa’s manual (a sort of ‘spellbook’ for wizards in her continuum) was luckily teleported with her. While she will not use it on missions often, it may come in handy for the more stubborn badfics. Also, as she (like every wizard in her canon) is fairly fluent in the Speech (the language to cast spells, every species can understand it), she may be able to communicate with nonhumans in certain fics. Whether this works outside of her canon or not is untested.<br><br>Lisa is very cheerful and outgoing. While she does have a tendency to forcibly glomp the cuter minis, as well as being unable to resist panda-themed objects, Lisa can be a very sympathetic and understanding person. As it turns out, she is also a seemingly limitless source of Very Bad Ideas.<br><br>Lisa is a fangirl over Doctor Who (some may even say the Eleventh Doctor is one of her objects of lust), Discworld, Kiki Strike, and anything by Scott Westerfield. Except Leviathan. She hates Leviathan.<br><br>Lisa is rather short (again, she’s thirteen), with a shock of close-cropped, bright red curls and quite a lot of freckles. She wears small, rectangular glasses; black, blue, or dark blue jeans; and t-shirts with funny sayings on them. She has an otherspace pocket in which she keeps her manual, a small stuffed panda, and all of her PPC materials; as well as her iPod stocked with Doctor Who episodes and noise-canceling headphones, in case of particularly gory fics.</p>

            <p>What is /with/ this influx of Time Lords into HQ?

            <p>I have to say, I like them.  Time Lord OCs you always have to be careful about, but The Scribe sounds like she can work well.  (There is precedent; check out Morgan and The Fisherman to see how Time Lord agents have been handled before.)  Also, as has been mentioned, the PPC has used TARDISes before.  The Fisherman still uses his.  An idea could be to have her come out of the plothole somewhere dangerous like DOSAT new technologies testing or the Reality Room or something, and have her TARDIS be destroyed and unsalvageable, if you want to continue that plotline.  <br><br>As for not knowing about the Time War, I think it could be a very powerful story if you write her only learning about it for the first time through the PPC.<br><br>And while &quot;Because it&#39;s cool!&quot; is a flimsy justification on its own, the Doctor isn&#39;t the only one to have a sonic device.  Jack Harkness had a sonic blaster and seemed to imply that those, at least, weren&#39;t particularly uncommon; the Master had a laser screwdriver, mostly to be able to boast that it was so much cooler than a stupid sonic one.  So if you can come up with a good reason - &quot;sonic engineering is a popular class at the Academy,&quot; maybe - I see no reason why you can&#39;t keep it.<br><br>As for Lisa, thirteen is a bit young.  I have an agent who&#39;s 17-18, and he&#39;s on the younger side of the age curve.  <br><br>I would really like to see a Young Wizards-verse agent, though.  I think she could be really cool.<br><br><br>I know this is just a short bio and you can&#39;t put everything in.  But, as it looks now, if you tighten up the backstory a little and flesh them out as characters, I think you could have a great pair of agents on your hands!</p>

            <p>Were this a request I was PGing, I would probably make my call based on how you wrote the two of them in your writing sample and just make some comments on possible problems here, so I&#39;ll do that now:<br><br>The Scribe: I don&#39;t know the Whoverse so I can&#39;t make a call on the validity of her background, but she doesn&#39;t sound bad as long as the emotional connection to her TARDIS is canonical. I wouldn&#39;t name her &quot;THE Scribe&quot;, though - aside from being awkward to read, it&#39;ll be irritating to type so many times - but just &quot;Scribe&quot;. Also, I&#39;m assuming that the Time War is a known part of Whoverse canon, and so I believe it&#39;d be almost impossible for an active agent working in that field not to have active access to the knowledge. <br><br>I like the touch about indigestion. Saying she &quot;absolutely hates squick&quot; is all nice and good, but squick is subjective, so all you&#39;re actually saying here is that she hates the things that make her cringe and hide, which is just redundant - you haven&#39;t defined what it actually is that she hates.<br><br>Lisa: Generally, unless something has changed while I&#39;ve been away, if a fic is unpublished it doesn&#39;t actually affect canon - as in, it hasn&#39;t gone out into the world of public access and so can&#39;t affect the word worlds. You could easily change this by pretending the fic was once posted and then deleted.<br><br>Having Lisa be speshully dumped in the PPC is not the best idea - how about just have her be recruited like so many other agents are? You don&#39;t want PPC agents to have things happen &quot;luckily&quot; very often; it makes them seem favoured by the Ironic Over-Power/Universe/TPTB/et cetera, which they never are. I worry about her youth in that it&#39;s far too easy to write children (or teenagers) as adults, or at least as equals with adults. I see that you&#39;re going for contrast with Scribe, but I don&#39;t think it needs to be that extreme. If you don&#39;t want to change the fic she came from, how about saying she was thirteen when she was recruited, and put to work behind a desk for the next five or six years until she could go out into the field?<br><br>Overall, for the both of them, you&#39;re paying a lot of attention to how they look, but as this is just bios I&#39;m not worried. Their interactions oculd be very funny; just be careful not to push them to extremes just to make contrast.<br><br>And... those are all my initial thoughts. I would like to see some more depth of character for both of them, but again, that&#39;s what the writing sample is for. I hope that was helpful!</p>

            <p>The Scribe: First, about TARDISes and the PPC: The PPC used them occasionally, and at least one pair of agents uses one as an RC. So they seem to work in the PPC.<br>Another thing: Why is it that Time Lords all have a sonic whatever? It was an invention of The Doctor... or has it been leaked and I don&#39;t know about that?<br>Also, since when are Very Bad Ideas endearing? They&#39;re very bad.<br><br>Lisa: The mysterious sole surviver of a deletion. Does that whole &quot;my world has been deleted and I&#39;ve probably been floating through the space between spaces&quot; thing even bother her? She&#39;s thirteen. Also, oh wonder, she still has her manual... what a nice coincidence.<br>Also, thirteen seems to be a bit young to become an agent.</p>

            <p>Deleted world humor? I can&#39;t really imagine that. Having one&#39;s home destroyed is always serious. Just because it&#39;s the PPC that doesn&#39;t mean that there can&#39;t be things that are serious.<br><br>Also giving a character stuff because you want it/it&#39;s awesome is often a Sue thing.

            <p>(( Hello! Before we start, just a few ground rules to keep things running smoothly:<br><br>1) When you join in, post your response to the end of whatever the most recent post is, to keep just one string of sequential posts. That way it should be easier to keep track of what&#39;s going on, and thus easier to include everyone. When the string gets too long, we&#39;ll come back to the top and start a new one off this post.<br><br>1.5) Don&#39;t worry about your characters being &quot;late&quot; if you can&#39;t get here until this has been going on a little while. It gets old fast, and this is an open party: people are welcome to come and go as they please. You can even write in yours as having been there the whole time if you want to.<br><br>2) Keep posts in past tense.

Some may be okay with it, but I&#39;m not (unless you have explicit permission).<br><br>And of course, OOC stuff gets marked somehow, but you all know that. {= ) So, here we go! ))<br><br><br>As near as Ilraen could figure, someone almost always threw a big party in the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Lounge#The_HQ_Lounge">Headquarters Lounge</a> around the month of December. It was linked to some kind of seasonal festival in World One, and elsewhere, though he had never quite worked out the specifics; everyone he asked seemed to have a different answer. They agreed on a few things, though: there had to be decorations involving lights and shiny objects, there had to be presents, and there had to be special music and food.<br><br>The latter had been the deciding factor for his attendance at this year&#39;s party. He wanted more chances to socialize with his friends and fellow agents, which was difficult without either leaving Nume alone or spending the time to convince him to come along. Nume was adamantly anti-party, and no amount of persuasion had moved him this time. Ilraen had considered staying in, too, for his partner&#39;s sake, but finally the thought of missing out on all the rare and wondrous holiday food items overcame him. He promised at least five times to behave himself in human morph, and to bring back some for Nume, and now he was here.<br><br>As a human, he was a willowy and youthful-looking man with messy ginger hair and green eyes. He had finally gotten himself a pair of bluejeans to wear around when he needed them, and Jenni had given him a traditional knitted Christmas sweater two years ago: it was pine-green with bounding white reindeer across the breast. He liked it. It made him feel less naked without his fur. Nothing could make up for being half-blind and liable to fall over, but he had enough practice with disguises that he managed, even with his bag over one shoulder. He had gifts for his friends, in case they happened to be around.<br><br>In the Lounge, the party was already in swing. People milled about, cheery music blared over the sound system, and whoever was organizing the thing had found one of the big pine trees favored for their long-lasting needles, and strung all manner of shiny things on it. It was probably the second one in its place—someone always tried to use real candles for the lights until something burned down. Ilraen wasn&#39;t sure whether he was imagining it, but he thought he could smell a hint of burning. That could just have been the Lounge, though. It had a history of being set on fire. Ilraen couldn&#39;t pick out a single piece of furniture he recognized from his first visits here.<br><br>He did pick out the spread of snacks on the bar top to his left, though. Unable to restrain an eerie, unpracticed grin at the prospects ahead, he shifted his way through the crowd. He <i>did</i> want to socialize, but a little bite first couldn&#39;t hurt.</p>

            <p>At first, Nume didn&#39;t realize that Sylvia was talking to him. There were lots of people in the room; she could have been addressing anyone in the general area, and anyway, he wasn&#39;t finished with the Yeerk. As Orken walked away, he curled his lip—it might almost have been a smile, sort of—and was about to remark to Ilraen how much the Yeerk seemed to like the sound of his own voice, but Ilraen shook his head and pointed over Nume&#39;s shoulder, anxiety writ large in his green eyes (not literally, thank goodness).<br><br>Nume turned around. &quot;What?&quot; he said before taking in the woman&#39;s appearance. &quot;Oh, that. Well, I warned people to get out of the way. If you didn&#39;t, it&#39;s your own fault.&quot; He folded his arms again.<br><br>Ilraen shook his head. He wanted no part of this. &quot;Excuse me, I think I saw someone else I know. Good-bye!&quot; He went to look for Maeryn/Kaliel.</p>

            <p>(Kali figured he must have been too busy with his food to respond), the Tok&#39;ra turned away from the Wraith and went over to see just how badly the tree had been burnt. It didn&#39;t look too bad, though a few branches towards the top had been singed heavily. She shrugged; the tree didn&#39;t mean much to her, though she was glad that it hadn&#39;t caught fire.

            <p>...Gaspard decided to call out for help. <br><br>Now, there are quite a few dialogue choices when it comes to asking people to help you get rid of a murderous, sentient blob that came from a cafeteria tray. For example, &quot;Help me!&quot; is a classic, while &quot;Get it off!&quot; conveys a more urgent tone. &quot;Kill it with fire!&quot; would be valid if the thing was not gripping onto your shirt while scrabbling at your neck. In the end, Gaspard settled with the ever-popular &quot;AUUUUGH!&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Your wallet or your life!&quot; yelled the blob, trying to strangle Gaspard. &quot;Your wallet or your- OOF!&quot; The terrified intern punched the blob in its side. He expected the thing have the consistency of Jell-O but to his surprise, it felt more like solidified chili. The chili monster recoiled from the blow, falling off Gaspard. It tried to slither away, but the edible abomination didn&#39;t manage to avoid a mighty kick from a bystander that sent it into the closest wall with a wet SPLAT! <br><br>Gaspard stood up and walked over to the chili monster, looking at it carefully. &quot;I have a question for you,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;What?&quot; answered the blob, slowly sliding to the ground.<br><br>&quot;Where the heck are your vocal cords? I mean, come on. You are a blob for crying out loud! How do you do it?&quot; <br><br>The chili monster thought about it for a few seconds. &quot;Does it matter?&quot; it said as it suddenly detached itself from the wall and launched itself onto a cyborg-like woman with bright white hair.<br><br></p>

            <p>As many mages from Lee&#39;s home continuum had found, when a large amount of magic was used for an extended amount of time, there was often an adverse effect on the mage who was acting as the conduit for said magic. In Lee&#39;s case, for example, it brought out her more paranoid and protective instincts; when they were combined with her battle skills that had been sharpened by two years of fighting badfic abominations of various kinds, the total effect left the elemental mage on edge quicker than if someone had shouted &quot;Sue!&quot; at the top of their lungs in the Cafeteria during rush hour. When she heard the ruckus begin thanks to the sentient grey jellies attacking people, she immediately located Ian and Sammy, both of whom were thankfully nearby. One muttered spell later and the two were neatly shielded from any kind of attack. <br><br>&quot;Who the <i>hell</i> thought it would be smart to bring sentient food in here?&quot; Lee growled, Roshaun baring his sharp teeth in an unconscious echo.<br><br></p>

            <p>Orken was leery of Agent Supernumerary’s question. He hoped that it was no the start of some anti-Yeerk tirade, or questions about flushing. He shuddered slightly, remembering the question Cadmar had asked when they first met, about giant space toilets.<br><br>“I am indeed a Yeerk, Agent Supernumerary.” A hint of a smirk passed over his face, briefly.  “It’s a pleasure to meet you, too. I’ve heard good things from your partner. I trust them to be true. Ilraen has proven himself to be more than adequate at his job. His knowledge of the Harry Potter canon proved-“ He was interrupted by a tap on the shoulder.<br><br>Thomas gestured to the presents Orken was carrying. “Cadmar’s being all huggy with this other dude, and I figured now was a good time to grab the presents.”<br><br>“It would be, if you had not interrupted my-“ Orken stopped, realizing that Thomas was offering to take the two annoying boxes that he had had been lugging around since the party began. “I mean…you may have them, Agent Thomas. I was just introducing myself to Agent Supernumerary.” <br><br>Thomas gave Ilraen’s partner a quick appraising glance before snatching the presents from Orken. “Sorry dude. I’d love to stay and get all introducutiony, but I have to get back to Cadmar. I asked a question, and they should stop hugging any second now and realize I asked it.” He ran off, back towards where Cadmar and Cali where wrapped in each other’s arms.<br></p>

            <p>Lisa lay back on the couch and closed her eyes, hoping for a short nap. Possibly a nice cookie. <br><br>Of course, this is a holidy party in the PPC HQ. Peace is not an option.<br><br>Within five minutes, Lisa was sat on, she had angrily attached the sitter to the ceiling, she was then accosted by a chaperone for the party (who, unsurprisingly, was drunk himself), she was forced to take the sitter down from the ceiling, and then the Scribe demanded that Lisa give her all her cookies.<br><br>&quot;Why?&quot; Lisa snapped exasperatedly.<br><br>&quot;So that next time you see me... Well... next time I see you, which will be in... hmm... two years for you? Yes, because you&#39;re... fourteen... so you&#39;ll meet me in about a year and a half... Anyway, so that then, you don&#39;t owe me anymore.&quot;<br><br>Lisa silently handed her cookies over and stomped to the snack table. Unfortunately, her foot got caught in the tablecloth, and the entirety of the snack table (including the inedible stuffed hedgehogs in motor oil sauce) came crashing down.<br><br>Lisa swore again and felt like kicking a puppy.</p>

            <p>Thomas cleared his throat. “I can see that… there is no need for either of you two dudes to answer my question. Uh. Well. This is kind of awkward. Well… I’ll leave you two be, but first, I wanted to give you this present. I guess it’s a combination Christmas and saving my life gift. Whatever you do, don’t pull off a red bead. It will explode instantly.” Thomas thought that the Sue necklace he had picked up a few missions back would look good on Cadmar. Of course, he didn’t know what the rule on giving jewelry to girls in a relationship already was, but he hoped that it wouldn’t make the situation even more awkward than it already was. Thomas handed the package to Cadmar.</p>

Now that the fire had come under control-- a few of the rafters were still smoldering, but other than that, the majority of the flames had been quenched --it seemed like everything was going back to normal. Kali caught sight of Kelok lurking in a nearby corner and figured that she may as well go say hello. She walked over to the Wraith, idly itching at the scratchy wool of her left sleeve with her free hand as she moved.<br><br>&quot;Hello, Kelok,&quot; she said, giving her fellow Stargate native a smile. &quot;Enjoying the party so far?&quot;</p>

            <p><br>Thomas grinned. “I’m glad you like it. Uh, if you pull the green beads, it releases sleeping gas. That might be useful at some point in the future.” He felt awkward in front of the couple. “Uh. Nice meeting you, dude. I have to go give Maria her present, and then I want to see if those dudes who were on the mission with us when Orken got the goa’uld in his head are around here.”<br>____<br>Orken did not know whether to take Nume’s statements as an attempt at intimidation, or simply an attempt to protect his partner. Perhaps it was both. Either way, intimidation was not something that worked well on the former Yeerk. <br><br>“Whatever you may think of our friendship, Agent Supernumerary, I can tell you that I have no intention of doing anything to harm your partner. Despite rumors to the contrary, Yeerk’s do care about more than messing with the heads of others. Besides, Ilraen has proven himself to be willful. I doubt I could really mess with him very badly.” He decided not to elaborate on the argument they had had about Thomas’ behavior. Now was not the time to open that particular can of worms. He continued. <br><br>“Maybe I could undermine his self confidence a little if I really tried, but even if you do not trust that I actually like this Andalite, remember that doing anything to hurt him would be detrimental to this organization. If you can’t trust my motivations, at least know you can trust my loyalty to the PPC, and in doing so know that I would never do anything to negatively impact the performance of one of its members. We will not have any problems,” he said, not thinking about anyone ever daring to question his loyalty. </p>

Gillies took two slices with glass fragments off the tray, and dropped them in the trash.  She smiled at the others gathered at the snacks.  &quot;Anyone want a Christmas cracker?  My partner brought a box full, straight from World One London.&quot;</p>

            <p>to the party. After being given that switchblade from Derwin, she had been left speechless. The problem with her and holiday presents was that if someone gave one to her, Natasha would feel guilty about it until she gave something in return. Which is why after Derwin had excused himself to go say hi to some of his friends, Natasha had raced back to her and Sylvia&#39;s RC to find something that would work as a gift. There being a fire might have had something to do with the speed that she had left the lounge.<br><br>Running back in (After checking to make sure that the fire had stopped)Natasha scanned the room for Derwin, gift clutched in hand. Seeing, him, Natasha ran up to the ghoul, breathing hard.<br><br>&quot;Um, I uh- I didn&#39;t say thank you for the Switchblade, so, um, yeah. Thanks! And I um, I realized that um- well...&quot;<br><br>Natasha trailed off, holding up her hand to give Derwin the present. It was a cluster of purple crystals, each pointing straight up from a grey stone below them.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s amethyst. I got it from this store in World One during summer once. I brought it from home because, well, it&#39;s pretty. I figure that you can use it to smash a Sue&#39;s face in for a bit of ironic justice.&quot; <br>_____<br><br>Meanwhile, Sylvia had been watching all of the commotion unfold, wondering if setting things on fire was part of the holiday, when she suddenly found herself wet, sticky, and smelling very sweet.<br><br>After a moment of shock, came a moment of anxiety about the condition of her trench coat. And then came the predictable moment of rage. Whoever was responsible was going to pay.<br><br>Sylvia grabbed a nearby party-goer.<br><br>&quot;Tell me who&#39;s responsible for this.&quot; she demanded, motioning at her soaked clothing. The agent pointed at a black haired man wearing glasses. &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br><br>Striding up to the man, Sylvia gave her best attempt at a death glare.<br><br>&quot;Explain.&quot; she snarled, once again motioning to her wet coat, &quot;Now.&quot;</p>

Deciding to give logic a rest, he shrugged his shoulders and quickly stepped out of the way as  a disgruntled woman wearing a trench coat stormed past him. After giving her a second glance, the intern returned to his table where his fellow interns were seated. <br><br>&quot;The main snack table is down,&quot; Gaspard said. &quot;So I&#39;m headed to the Cafeteria to go and get some more food. Can I convince some of you to come with me?&quot; <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll go,&quot; said Philip, rising from his seat. &quot;Besides, those choco-snails were staring to get gross after a while. Maybe we can find some REAL food in there.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re talking about the Cafeteria, Philip,&quot; replied Gaspard as they walked to the doors. &quot;Knowing them, they&#39;ve probably got some nasty stuff waiting for us in there.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Like... chocolate-covered anchovies.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Choco-steak.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Friday&#39;s lasagna.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Stu of the day.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Let&#39;s not go there,&quot; said Philip hastily as he pushed open the doors. &quot;Last time I ordered that there was strange lumps in my food.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Right,&quot; said Gaspard as the two boys stepped out into the hallway. &quot;Which way is the Cafeteria again?&quot;</p>

            <p>Orken did not know how to react. He could have sworn that the older agent had been challenging him. Maybe he had misread the situation. It certainly wouldn’t be the first time. It was around this point that he realized Nume was offering his hand. Ah, this again. This, he knew. <br><br>Shaking Nume’s hand, he said, “Ah. Well, don’t worry, Agent Supernumerary, the last thing I would want to do is undo any of the work you’ve put into training Ilraen. It has been… not unpleasant to finally meet you. I wish you a happy religious or non religious festival of your choosing. Or, if you so choose, of course, no celebration at all.” <br><br>Orken had never understood the term “happy holidays,” since, it had always implied to him that those who choose not to celebrate were somehow being left out of any well wishes. He had viewed it as one more example of humans irrationally separating each other into groups. His former host had called him “paranoid” and Thomas had told him he was way over thinking things.<br><br>He shoved his irrelevant musings into a far corner of his head, and gave one of his rare genuine smiles. “Well, if you two will excuse me, I think I’m going to try some of that chocolate covered ham Ilraen seems to love so much. While I know taking food recommendations from an Andalite can result in the consumption of some non-food items, I think I’ll take his suggestion this time. Hopefully I’ll be seeing you two around.”<br></p>

He shook his head, then took the brown-wrapped package from the top of Orken&#39;s stack and replaced it with his, which had the unmistakeable heft of two middle-sized paperbacks. He watched Orken tear into it with his characteristic precision. Inside were copies of <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> by Anthony Burgess and <i>Brave New World</i> by Aldous Huxley.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not certain if you have read these before,&quot; Ilraen said, &quot;but since you are in a science fiction division, I thought you might like to have them anyway. If you don&#39;t, that is. They&#39;re considered classics in World One. I read them both during the quarantine in 2008 and found them fascinating.&quot; He watched for Orken&#39;s reaction, unconsciously hunching his shoulders and turning over the package in his hands.</p>

            <p>Lee turned around to see if she could find her way back to Ian and Sammy. The crowd had shifted enough that the subjects of Lee&#39;s search were blocked from sight, however, and given the density of said crowd, Lee figured that it&#39;d probably be best for her to just wait until she spotted her partner and surrogate daughter. She spotted a nearby empty chair and quickly claimed it, the fabric of her silk robes-- in the traditional blue-with-white-fur-trim of her home &#39;Verse --rustling a bit as she moved.

            <p>At this point, the doors opened and a small group of people entered the room. The most distinctive one was a tall man with pale purple skin and green hair, who was practically bouncing with glee. &quot;Come <i>on</i>, you lot!&quot; he exclaimed, on noticing two of his companions were hanging back a bit. &quot;If I can get excited about something that doesn&#39;t even exist where I come from, you&#39;ve no excuse.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You get excited about any reason to have a party, Dayn,&quot; was Andrew&#39;s only response, while Alyssa and her daemon Kian - still a bit nervous around big groups, after nearly four years in the PPC - just smiled a bit sheepishly.<br><br>Dayn shrugged slightly and grinned. &quot;I&#39;d have dragged Faith along, too, but she said something about preferring to spend time with Parjai.&quot;<br><br>&quot;To be fair, he doesn&#39;t generally do parties,&quot; pointed out Russell, who was looking a bit more enthusiastic. &quot;And we know what she&#39;s like about him.&quot; They all chuckled at his understatement; Faith was head-over-heels in love with the clone commando, and took any opportunity to just spend time alone with him.<br><br>&quot;Anyway, that ain&#39;t the issue,&quot; said Kayla, the older of the two women in the group. &quot;Go on, all o&#39; you - party time.

Andrew hung back a bit more until Kayla gently shoved him at the nearest group of people. &quot;Go. Socialise. At least say hi to people. It&#39;s Christmas, even you can relax a bit.&quot;<br><br>He rolled his eyes, but decided not to argue and approached the people nearby. Kayla, shadowed by Alyssa and Kian, strolled off in another direction, hoping to say hello to a few others.</p>

            <p>Hopping through the doors at that moment was a deep one, with a fairy flying not far behind. The deep one had long forelimbs and a long head, while any details about the fairy were hidden due to her being on fire.<br><br>&quot;Now Kasaiko, we are trying make a good impression on these people,&quot; the deep one stated. &quot;Please make at least some attempt to control your impulses. Fire is NOT to be considered a method of conversation.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t be so boring, Yanri, fire is ALWAYS good!&quot; Kasaiko retorted, as she set an unused chair on fire. &quot;And besides, everyone is really happy to see it! Just look how shiny it is!&quot; the fairy continued. As she was flying off to set something else ablaze, she died from the heat, only to respawn at the chair she had just lit.<br><br>&quot;My name is Yn&#39;hrai, and fire is most distinctly not good. Notice how it just killed you?&quot; the deep one asked, as Kasaiko managed to ignite herself again.<br><br>&quot;Fire totally harmless. See, this chair&#39;s just fine!&quot; Kasaiko stated over a pile of ashes that used to be a chair. &quot;And look at the people with fire on their patches! I&#39;m going to go talk to them!&quot; she said sticking her tongue out at Yn&#39;hrai.<br><br>&quot;That fool, when will she ever learn...&quot; said Yn&#39;hrai disdainfully.</p>

            <p>Yn&#39;hrai, glad his Touhou-verse companion was  with someone else for now, hopped over to the snack bar. All he saw that was edible was some tuna, but it was a strange brownish color. &quot;All the food here is rotten, how do they ...&quot;<br><br>&quot;HI YINRA!&quot; shouted Kasaiko, despite being right next to the deep one. As he turned around, he noticed several burning couches and chairs, as well as single spot on the floor that had caught fire. &quot;The people with fire patches are from the Department of Geographical Abrasions! They use fire to clean up, and I&#39;m helping! See how much of the furniture I&#39;ve cleaned?&quot; said the fairy with a proud look.<br><br>&quot;How many times must I tell you, my name is Yn&#39;hrai. Additionally, the flame flash patch marks a person as being a member of the Department of Geographical ABERRATIONS,&quot; the deep one stated. &quot;Furthermore, the D.o.G.A. uses fire to cleanup uncanonical locations in badfic, not for housekeeping. As such,... wait, where are you going?&quot; asked Yn&#39;hrai as Kasaiko flew off toward the lights.<br><br>Yn&#39;hrai considered tackling her before she could light anything else, but quickly realized that doing so would result in him catching on fire, and unlike her, he would not respawn. At this point, he noticed a rather nervous looking intern near the exit, and hopped over to him. &quot;Hello sir,&quot; the deep one croaked, &quot;Is my companion causing you trouble?&quot;, he asked, pointing to the newly respawned fairy.</p>

            <p>&quot;Ah, yes, I should introduce myself,&quot; the deep one began, &quot;I am Yn&#39;hrai, a deep one. We are from the deep oceans of the Cthulhu Mythos. Great Cthulhu is often the only thing people know of from the Mythos, and so creatures such as myself are rarely seen. We are amphibious, and naturally very long lived.&quot;<br><br>At this moment, Yn&#39;hrai looked up, and saw that there was a small fire burning in the rafters directly above him. &quot;As for my companion,&quot; the deep one continued, &quot;Kasaiko is fairy from the Touhou continuum. All fairies from her universe are associated with some aspect of nature, and also have some minor power relating to that aspect of nature.&quot; The deep one noted that she was clear across the room at this point, and continued speaking, &quot;Fairies will also somehow revive if killed, though the exact mechanics of this are neither clear nor consistent. Additionally, fairies are very childish, and are unconcerned by death. As you have most likely deduced, Kasaiko&#39;s aspect is-&quot;<br><br>At that moment Yn&#39;hrai was interrupted by a rather loud shout of &quot;HI INHI!&quot; from Kasaiko. She had finished her &quot;cleaning&quot; of the rafters, which, as Yn&#39;hrai noted worriedly, involving igniting almost the entire ceiling. While most of the fire on the floor had been put out by various agents, they would have trouble reaching such high places. Kasaiko, oblivious to her partner&#39;s emotions, shouted &quot;Hey, who&#39;s your friend? And why does he have that strange color on his arm?&quot; pointing toward the urple armband.<br><br>Yn&#39;hrai then turned to address the man, and stated apologetically, &quot;How rude of me, I have not asked your name yet.&quot;</p>

Sue alert!&quot; Kyle and Kevin shouted in unison before turning their water guns on Miah and by association--Maria.</p>

            <p>((This is going on a little before the fire. I was busy yesterday, so yeah, wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey. ))<br><br>Ilraen had nearly forgotten the box he was holding, but now that he&#39;d seen Orken pleased with his present, Ilraen could think of himself again. It seemed heavy for its size, he thought, tearing through the brown packaging paper with abandon. It was fun, doing that.<br><br>The paper floated to the floor, and the lid to the box landed on top. Ilraen found himself looking down at a Dracon Beam. To say that he was surprised would be to say that a cat-owner feels surprise at finding a dead rat on the bed for the first time—it didn&#39;t quite suffice, but there wasn&#39;t another word for it. It was one thing, he realized, to accept a person, a fellow-being, who&#39;d happened to be on the wrong side of an old war. It was quite another to accept a cold metal object used in the slaughter and enslavement of millions. Very much not wishing to be rude, though, he quickly swallowed and grinned at Orken, for once counting on his usual lack of mastery with the expression to cover his real feelings.<br><br>&quot;I am sure it will be useful,&quot; he said. &quot;We have not been in the habit of carrying weapons, but that has gotten us into trouble before. Thank you.&quot;<br><br>He meant it, too, by the time he said it. Like the cat-owner, he could forgive his friend acting on his nature. The thought behind it was meant well.<br><br>Kneeling, he replaced the box&#39;s lid and tucked it into his bag. On standing up, he frowned and looked around. &quot;Do you smell smoke?&quot;<br><br>Moments later, the rafters caught fire.<br><br>~*~<br><br>Agent Supernumerary was not happy. He had meant to spend a quiet evening alone in his response center while Ilraen went out and made a fool of himself at the party, but no, Headquarters couldn&#39;t allow that. After all the strange messages filtering to his console, he finally resigned himself to the fact that <i>someone</i> would have to try and keep people from panicking if Maintenance did put the power out, and he was probably the only one paying enough attention to think of it.<br><br>He arrived in a deep sulk, head down and hands thrust into the pockets of his gray slacks, and stopped short in the doorway to the Lounge.<br><br>&quot;Oh, <i>Christ,</i>&quot; he swore, uncreatively but with deep feeling. &quot;This is why I stopped coming here,&quot; he grumbled to no one.<br><br>The place was on fire. Again. Some people were making an effort at putting it out, but the rafters were high up and hard to reach. It looked like kids with squirt-guns were the only ones making any effort there.<br><br>Suddenly, he overheard a blessedly sensible-sounding voice— <i>&quot;shouldn&#39;t you deal with the source of the problem first?&quot;</i> —and he spotted the flaming fairy.<br><br>Well, Nume had come here to stop chaos, and by God, somebody had to do something. He strode through the crowd, not caring who he pushed out of his way, and grabbed the first bowl of punch he could reach. Waiting for just the right moment, when the fairy fluttered into range, he shouted: &quot;EVERYBODY OUT OF THE WAY!&quot; and flung the entire contents of the bowl at the little menace.</p>

            <p>((Direct response to Neshomeh&#39;s last post, so same deal with timey-wimey stuff))<br><br>Orken breathed a sigh of relief. “Smoke?” He sniffed the air, and indeed smelled smoke. He frowned. “Hrm. I hope someone isn’t being unsafe with fire. This place has a tendancy to… ignite.” Not seeing any immediate flames, though, he continued. “I’m glad you like it. I noticed that you didn’t bring a weapon on our last mission. As an Assassin, I can’t imagine going into bad…” He stopped as he caught sight of the fire climbing the rafters. “Really? Again? Isn’t this getting kind of… expected?” He hugged the last two presents he was carrying close to his chest, in such a way that they shielded the books Ilraen had given him. The gifts Thomas had picked out for Maria and Cadmar would not be harmed by the eventual fire extinguishing water (probably) whereas the two paperbacks most certainly would. <br><br>“Why in the name of kandrona must people keep setting this place on fire?” Orken wondered allowed. He eyed the flames with apprehension, and calculated his chances of being able to get to the door. He estimated his chances were not good. Shortly after resigning himself to having to avoid catching fire in the lounge while stuck in the aforementioned burning room, he saw an agent he swore he had seen before (perhaps he had been around awhile?) wielding a punch bowl and screaming at the top of his lungs for others to get out of his way, as he threw punch at the instigator of the lounges nth fire. Some children were making headway on the rafter fire with their squirt guns as well. (He could not even hazard a guess as to the number of times it had happened. He had heard it had happened quite often even before his time, but no-one seemed to have exact numbers.) He hoped that there were others as innovative as the man with the bunch bowl and the children with the squirt guns, because there was a conspicuous lack of fire extinguishers. Orken silently cursed the laws of narrative comedy.<br></p>

            <p>Yn&#39;hrai had anticipated the intern&#39;s recommendation that Kasaiko join the DoGA. It was the obvious choice given her personality. &quot;Kasaiko&#39;s meeting with the Bonsai Mallorn has disqualified her from the D.o.G.A.&quot; the deep stated as his companion flew off once again. &quot;We currently interested in joining the Department of Floaters. The Floating Hyacinth being a water plant helps with this, as is Kasaiko&#39;s willingness to burn anything, including Sues,&quot; Yn&#39;hrai&#39;s tone was even more formal than his usual speech.<br><br>It was at this point that someone shouted something rather loudly. The deep one turned around just in time to see Kasaiko get drenched by a thrown bowl of punch. At this point it could be observed that her eyes, hair, wings, clothing, shoes, and anything else she happened to be wearing all looked rather similar to a burning fire, resulting in the already doused fairy becoming the target of several squirt guns. Kasaiko suddenly began crying, and flew directly through the flames that were now starting to engulf the exit. Her partner hopped after her, shouting something about a fire extinguisher.</p>

Peace is not an option.<br><br>Within five minutes, Lisa was sat on, she had angrily attached the sitter to the ceiling, she was then accosted by a chaperone for the party (who, unsurprisingly, was drunk himself), she was forced to take the sitter down from the ceiling, and then the Scribe demanded that Lisa give her all her cookies.<br><br>&quot;Why?&quot; Lisa snapped exasperatedly.<br><br>&quot;So that next time you see me... Well... next time I see you, which will be in... hmm... two years for you? Yes, because you&#39;re... fourteen... so you&#39;ll meet me in about a year and a half... Anyway, so that then, you don&#39;t owe me anymore.&quot;<br><br>Lisa silently handed her cookies over and stomped to the snack table. Unfortunately, her foot got caught in the tablecloth, and the entirety of the snack table (including the inedible stuffed hedgehogs in motor oil sauce) came crashing down.<br><br>Lisa swore again and felt like kicking a puppy.</p>

Then she looked up, and of course, found almost three sets of mistletoe. <br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t SEE anyone around...&quot; She ducked in quickly, bracing for someone to pop out. After a minute of looking foolish, she decided to try and blend in the crowd. <br><br>&quot;Ooooh, chocolate...&quot; She licked her lips.

            <p>Kaliel let herself be dragged into the Lounge by Orion, who was dressed in a suitably silly reindeer headband, a red-and-green sweatshirt, and a comfortable pair of sweats. The <i>Harry Potter</i> native had insisted that his partner dress up for the occasion, so here Kali was, wearing an oversized woolly sweater with a Christmas tree on it. The top of said tree had a light sewn into it that flashed on and off every few seconds; Kali had privately vowed to get suitable vengeance for the abomination, and Maeryn had agreed to help.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ve got to get into the spirit, Kali!&quot; Orion said as he pulled her into the Lounge. &quot;It&#39;s <i>Christmas</i>.

That is a lot of chocolate. Hmm. There may be some merit to this yet.</i>&quot;<br><br>--<br><br>The sound of PPC-themed Christmas carols heralded the arrival of Ian, Lee, and Sammy, with Ian finishing off their current rendition of &#39;The Twelves Sues of Christmas&#39; with a rousing &quot;...Two mini-Balrogs, and a single glistening tear!&quot; The three entered the Lounge, Ian keeping a tight hold on Sammy&#39;s hand as they navigated the crowd.<br><br>&quot;There&#39;s a good turn-out this year,&quot; Ian said, looking around at the various agents and PPC staff. He thought he saw one of the Flowers in a corner of the room, but wasn&#39;t sure.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m just glad I could make it this year,&quot; Lee replied, shifting the moderately-sized pile of presents in her arms in an effort to rebalance them. &quot;I&#39;m going to put these under the tree before they tip over again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good idea. We&#39;ll stay here.&quot;<br><br>Lee nodded and then started toward the tree, trying to focus on not spilling her precious load before she got to her destination.</p>

She reached behind her, and a glowing magic circle appeared in the air as she requipped a Santa Hat that, oddly enough, had a pair of green rabbit ears protruding from the sides.

            <p>And let two more people into the Lounge. The tallest of the pair, a 50-year old Chinese man with greying black hair and an angular face, surveyed the room. He turned to his son who was standing behind him.<br><br>“So as I was saying, you spend too much time in your Response Centre playing video games,” the man said as he smoothed his FicPsych flash patch. “It’s about time you got out of there and interacted with something alive, for a change.”<br><br>The figure sanding behind the tall man shifted slightly. He was a wiry 17 year old, with short black hair and brown eyes. He was clad completely in black, except for an urple armband he wore on his right arm. “But dad, I need to know this stuff. I mean, Intelligence won’t take people who don’t know half the things about the continuums they protect,” he replied.<br><br>“Gaspard, you’ve been in there for over five hours,” the man retorted. “You can afford to take a break once in a while.”<br><br>“I need to get hired.” <br><br>“You need to unwind,” said the Chinese man, pulling his son along. “I even see some other interns. This isn’t going to kill you or sabotage your chances at getting hired. Grow up for goodness’ sake.” <br><br>Gaspard stared at his father. “Fine,” he eventually replied before heading to the snack bar. He wasn&#39;t going to stay for too long: this party was not for him. Just a few minutes, a couple of snacks, and then he would be back off to the RC to finish that Starcraft campaign he had started. On his way to the refreshments, he was waylaid by a group of partygoers who jammed a Santa hat on his head and dragged him into their conversation. <br><br>Ten minutes later, he was singing Christmas carols and chatting with the rest of the group.<br><br>Gaspard&#39;s father smiled to himself, seeing that his son wouldn&#39;t try to leave the party early, and wandered off into the crowd.</p>

            <p>One of the most awkward moments of his life, coming a close second to the time he had dived through the window and into that girl&#39;s room. I mean how has he supposed to know she was undressing, she totally over-reacted.<br><br>Anyway he had been left wandering the halls of the HQ after his run-in with a wizard, a poetry spouting man and two rather strange ghouls. After colliding with several walls that Percy swore had appeared out of nowhere and having no luck in finding Vorce, he had managed to find his way back to the lounge area he had appeared in. And to say it had changed was an understatement.<br><br>Now he was left standing in a rather large crowd of people who had seemingly come out of nowhere and was feeling rather subconcious about his appearance, Who could miss a 6&quot;4&#39; person with skin the same green as a christmas tree and hair that could have come from a rather flamboyant anime character.<br><br>&quot;Should have stuck with the ghoul&quot; Percy muttered to himself, before heading off to try and find anyone familiar and hoping no one would stop to ask him who he was.</p>

Finally, he closed it and put in one of his longcoat&#39;s many pockets.<br><br>He looked around. Masses of people were milling around, eating snacks, drinking drinks, and talking. Already the noise seemed unbearable.<br><br>Shaking his head, he headed to the snack bar. Looking at the various chocolate-covered snacks, he chuckled. &quot;Someone here really likes chocolate,&quot; he said. Reaching into a pocket, he took a small box out of it, opening it to reveal a few cookies. He took one, then put the box on the table.</p>

Talk to people.  Make some new friends.  You can&#39;t stay holed up by yourself in your room forever.&quot;  She looked up at him and smiled enthusiastically.  &quot;Besides, they&#39;ve got chocolate-covered eggnog here.  <i>Chocolate-covered eggnog</i>.  I don&#39;t even know how that&#39;s possible, but they have it.  This place is <i>great.</i>&quot;</p>

            <p>First, Thomas had dragged him here, insisting that it was polite and &quot;professional&quot; to show up at one&#39;s office Christmas party. Then, he had insisted that Orken buy gifts for all of his friends. Luckily, that was not terribly many people. There were gifts for Cadmar and Maria (a combination Christmas/Thanks-for-saving-us present) and Orken had picked one out for Ilraen. Thomas had rolled his eyes when Orken had told him who the gift was for, but that didn&#39;t matter. At least he had resisted Thomas&#39; requests to dress festively. Thomas had put on his best Santa hat and was wearing an ugly green sweater with a Christmas tree on it. Orken was wearing his usual all black atire. <br><br>Of course, he had not thought that finding the Andalite would be this difficult. It did not help matters that Thomas&#39; priorities lay in eating chocolate covered foods and not in helping Orken locate the recipients of their gifts was not helping.<br><br>Then, Orken caught a glimpse of a man he thought he recognized. It took him a second to realize that it was Ilraen in human morph. He made his way through the crowd (resisting an attempt to put a Santa hat on his head) and, awkwardly shifting the presents he was carrying, tapped Ilraen on the shoulder. </p>

Morgan was slumped, staring into a mug.<br><br>&quot;So I get killed by a Macrovirus,&quot; she explained to anyone who&#39;d listen, &quot;and regenerate into, well, this.&quot; She waved a hand vaguely at herself, took a sip of her drink. &quot;Still not used to it. Then a few weeks later Makes-Things comes out of nowhere and tells me he&#39;s got an experiment he needs my help in. &#39;Sure,&#39; I say, &#39;no problem,&#39; I say. Idiot. He shuts me in this big metal box, and next thing I know, it&#39;s yesterday, my TARDIS is screaming at me - sort of, you know what I mean - for being gone so long, and there&#39;s a message telling me my parter... partnter... whatever, is dead. Hi there.&quot;<br><br>She waved to a passing agent, who blinked. &quot;Um, hi,&quot; the red-haired woman said.<br><br>&quot;She&#39;s got a baby, you know,&quot; Morgan went on to her now-captive audience. &quot;Had a baby, I guess. He&#39;s still alive - lovely little thing. But not Traf.&quot; She sighed and stared into her mug. &quot;Apparently I&#39;m a maudlin drunk. What is this stuff, anyway?&quot; She sniffed the drink and nodded. &quot;Ah. Hot chocolate.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um, right,&quot; her listener said. &quot;I... um, I have to do something.&quot; She stood up and walked a few steps away, then started speaking hurriedly into a radio. Morgan shrugged and went back to contemplating her drink.</p>

            <p>... didn&#39;t see anyone he knew well on the way to the snacks table, though he did spot Maeryn/Kaliel there and gave the Tok&#39;ra a wave. He made himself a mental note to go and say hello properly in a moment.<br><br>First, there was a quantity of chocolate laid before him that he felt certain wasn&#39;t allowed under normal circumstances, possibly not even under these circumstances. There was a reason most agents weren&#39;t allowed any, he thought as he reached for a chocolate-covered mint. It had to be some kind of drug—the chocolate-covered ham, for sure. That couldn&#39;t possibly be legal, it went down far too easily for something so rich and complex. He was all right, though. He had been working on his discipline of late, and as he chewed on a chocolate-covered orange slice, he felt confident that it was working. He was pretty sure he took the time to smile and nod at the other agents near the table between bites, though they did give him some odd looks in return. It had to be the smile—he just couldn&#39;t quite master the trick, and it put people off. Oh well.<br><br>He jumped at a sudden tap on his shoulder and spun around, a fistful of chocolate-covered eggnog drops on its way to his mouth. His eyes popped and he nearly choked when he recognized Orken, the one person he least wanted to catch him indulging in what Nume called &quot;stupid Andalite cliches,&quot; however well he thought he was behaving himself. His face got hot and red, clashing ferociously with his carroty hair. He swallowed hard to get rid of the gooey mess already on his tongue, tipped the rest of the drops into a nearby plastic cup, and brushed his hand on his pant leg. The smear of chocolate on his chin was completely lost on him.<br><br>&quot;Orken!&quot; he said hoarsely. Desserts were murder on human vocal cords. &quot;I didn&#39;t expect—that is, I had hoped to meet you here, but when I arrived—.&quot; He cut himself short. Babbling like an idiot wasn&#39;t going to help. He took a deep breath, straightened up, and started over. &quot;I am pleased to see you. Have you been well?&quot;</p>

Orken totally got you a…” Orken stomped on his toe. “Ow!”<br><br>“Agent Thomas, I would appreciate it if you did not ruin the surprise.”<br><br>Thomas grinned. “Dude, you were saying earlier about how the whole surprise thing was silly. Well, I guess that was before I found out you were getting Ilraen a present. It’s so cute you find being friends with an Andalite embarrassing.”<br><br>Orken’s face turned red. “Agent Thomas, I would appreciate it if…”<br><br>His waved a dismissive hand. “Yeah yeah yeah. I’ll go make myself scarce.” He wandered off in the direction of a group of people singing Christmas Carols.<br></p>

            <p>Ilraen sighed in relief and finally thought to wipe his mouth on the back of one hand while the partners talked. He frowned at the amount of chocolate that came away. He hadn&#39;t been <i>that</i> overtaken with the experience, had he? He quickly found a napkin and scrubbed the residue away in time to wave Thomas off.<br><br>&quot;Good to see you again, Agent Thomas,&quot; he said before turning back to Orken.<br><br>&quot;I am not busy now,&quot; he told the former Yeerk with dignity. &quot;And I also have a gift for you,&quot; he added in a rush, without it. He reached into his bag and withdrew a rectangular box clumsily wrapped in paper that looked like it had come straight from an attic in the 70s. It might have been Nume&#39;s own attic, at that; Ilraen hadn&#39;t asked. All he knew was that it was traditional to cover Christmas gifts in paper with repetitive designs in green and red. He grinned sheepishly. &quot;It was my first time wrapping presents. The tape can be quite troublesome.&quot;</p>
