            <p>There a link at the top of this page, near the wiki link. Input your username. There are usually some people on the IRC, depending on what time it is. There are PPC participants all over the world, so unless some are busy there&#39;s almost always at least one person hanging around.<br><br>While IRC is slightly complex (if you want to set up your own room with special features, like dice rolling for games... I play Dungeons and Dragons over it!) just chatting in the PPC room is simple and requires pretty much no experience with IRC at all. Just click the link, it launches in your browser, enter your username, and go! :)</p>

            <p>So, apparently someone wrote a badfic about the good people on <a href="http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/"><a href="http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/">http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/</a></a> and it came to their attention. Since sporking bad things are right up their alley, they decided to go ahead and spork it, by simply acting it out, thus fuelling my theory, that the very worst badfics spork themselves.<br><br><a href="http://blip.tv/nostalgia-chick/live-action-fanfic-5484116"><a href="http://blip.tv/nostalgia-chick/live-action-fanfic-5484116">http://blip.tv/nostalgia-chick/live-action-fanfic-5484116</a></a><br><br>It can be enjoyed without knowing anything about TGWTG, but I would recommend checking out their other videos; they are pretty awesome.</p>

            <p>At around 3:34 you can actually see Nostalgia Chick shaking with barely suppressed laughter. :D<br><br>My friend who showed me this, suggested I did a mission in the badfic, but the whole point of missions is to protect canon and this canon seems to be perfectly able to protect itself.<br>If I do the mission anyway, it would be a very odd one indeed, with all the canons being 0% OOC and my agents watching in puzzlement as the fic sporks itself and dies.</p>

            <p>Good job with Pinkie Pie&#39;s dialogue at the end (I don&#39;t actually watch <i>Friendship is Magic</i>, but I&#39;ve seen enough bits to know you got that spot on).  I also like that you preceded a mission in the Saw continuum with a character making choices in a video game.<br><br>I could have done with fewer chunks of the badfic, though.  I know you needed to show the terrible punctuation, and why the word cyclone was formed, but that&#39;s established fine with the first few paragraphs quoted.  After that, it just gets obnoxious having to read those huge paragraphs of text throughout the mission.</p>

            <p>That was actually... something that was so subconscious I didn&#39;t even realize there was something that could work about that. The whole choices thing, I mean.<br><br>Honestly, in terms of the badfic excerpting this mission gave me a bit of a hard time, because it /really/ made it hard for me to gauge how much I needed to cut. I ended up going with all those things of text, not because I needed to establish the run-on paragraphs, but because I felt it would be really awkward if I produced a fanfic excerpt that was a line long that had absolutely nothing in the way of punctuation.</p>

            <p>Good work! What a truly bad fic, both the idea and the execution (pun intended). I had to shake my head at how the author used almost no punctuation, but then spilled a bunch on three ellipses.<br><br>Also, please let us know what Florestan decides to do in Dragon Age.

            <p>but Midori Aoi&#39;s story started in June 2010, yours in March 2011. At a first glance, since she started nine months before you, you have to come with a little more substantial evidence than &quot;fic with similar idea&quot; before you start accusing her of plagiarism.<br><br>At the moment it looks more like you are plagiarizing her.

            <p>Have you or Anjilly contacted Midori Aoi? That might be a good way to clear the air, see what&#39;s going down.<br><br>But honestly, I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s that much plagiarism going on. Your OFU is an ensemble cast affair, while hers is more centered around one character going around doing stuff. Also, it reads more like a high school thing than it does a guide on how not to write fanfics in the A:TLA continuum.

            <p>Truth be told, I&#39;m good with just letting her be. Her story hasn&#39;t been getting much attention, and I personally don&#39;t care about what she does with it. Anjilly and I thought it best to ask for more professional second opinions on the Board, in case there was anything we missed.<br><br>So for now, I&#39;ll probably just leave Aoi alone.</p>

            <p>No disclaimer of &quot;fanfiction universities are Miss Cam&#39;s idea&quot;, and no trace of Midori Aoi in the Wiki or the Board. Not good.<br>I didn&#39;t search for similarities between your OFU and hers because I don&#39;t have the time, however.<br><br>I know that PPC and OFUs are separate entities, but effectively seems that a random girl decided to open her own OFU-lookalike. In my personal opinion, nothing wrong about that. Love for canon and good writing is always a good thing. <br><br>But pagiarizing somebody else&#39;s work is always bad.</p>

            <p>The month-long thing is just a general idea. For example, Gaijinguy got permission after only being here only a few weeks. So it really just comes down to whether or not any PGs feel like SS&#39;s been around long enough for them to give permission.</p>

            <p>And how interactive one is. For instance, doing a simple name search of the front page now, I see six instances of ShatteredSanity&#39;s name - two in this thread, and two in each of two other threads, both of which SS started. I don&#39;t see any other interaction on this page at all, so if <br><br>I were being your PG, SS - and I&#39;m not, sorry, I just don&#39;t have the time - I&#39;d ask you to wait a week or so and intereact a bit more so we can get to know you a tad better.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s something that concerns me, too - since I&#39;m not exactly a forums/board post type of person and enjoy direct communication (i.e. IRC) more, and I&#39;ve been here for almost two months now.<br><br>So what exactly defines &quot;participation&quot; in this community?

            <p>If my own permission is any indication, as long as there&#39;s a PG who think&#39;s you&#39;ve been active enough that folks have gotten to know you, you&#39;re good. I&#39;d rarely visited the board, but I was active on the IRC pretty much every day when I got permission. (Not that I&#39;m less active on IRC, I&#39;m just slightly more active on the board.)</p>

            <p>Sure it&#39;s kind of gross, but, unlike the spear incident, it&#39;s within the realm of physical possibility. So unless the actual writing was horrific, I think it comes under the heading of the Slash-Sporking Guide on the Wiki (even though it&#39;s het, but the point still applies):<br><br>&quot;Slash, however, and what makes it bad, is rather more of a heated subject. The usual place we run into trouble with this is on higher rated, PWP and kinkfic. Because of this, the Prime Directive of Sporking Bad Slash, for me at least, is &#39;Your Kink Is Not My Kink&#39;. Our job is not to judge other people&#39;s taste in porn. People are allowed to like what they like, and people are entitled to their opinion. If they think that Character A urinating into Character B&#39;s mouth is a turn-on, that&#39;s entirely their business. And if they&#39;ve managed to justify Character A and Character B wanting to engage in such an activity in decent-enough prose, then you should leave them to it. Yes, even if in your personal canon, Character A and Character B would rather die a thousand deaths than engage in what is charmingly referred to as &quot;watersports&quot;. Unless it&#39;s specifically said in canon that Character A and Character B don&#39;t like watersports, then there is always the chance it can be justified with some clever writing and a twisty set of speculations on their thoughts.&quot;</p>

            <p>This isn&#39;t a case of plagiarism exactly, but I think it may merit a polite poke. See, I have a fanfic that&#39;s fairly popular in the &quot;Penguins of Madagascar&quot; section. I mentioned in the author&#39;s notes that I&#39;d actually really like to see other fics with a similar premise. I don&#39;t have any claim on the premise, because I stole it from the TVTropes&#39; Wild Mass Guessing page and some Rule 34 fanart anyway ;) (In case you&#39;re wondering, it&#39;s the FTM!Julien one - long story behind the reasoning.) However, someone (who has repeatedly given me good reviews and faved my fic) has written a fic with that premise and included some scenes which are rather blatantly inspired by mine. They&#39;re not actually copy-pasted or anything, and I&#39;m actually a little flattered that someone likes my work enough for this. However, since it&#39;s so obviously inspired by mine, would it be a good idea for me to gently poke them and ask for credit? If so, can anyone give me a hand drafting a polite note?<br><br>Here are the two fics for comparison.<br>Mine: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6715281/1/Princess"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6715281/1/Princess">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6715281/1/Princess</a></a><br>His: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7306972/1/Wait_hes_a_what"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7306972/1/Wait_hes_a_what">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7306972/1/Wait_hes_a_what</a></a></p>

            <p>Exactly that happened to me too! Somebody, I guess, liked the name and plot of my fic. I decided to click on it, *just* to see what it&#39;s about, and it&#39;s about the SAME THING EXACTLY, so I told her so, and she went all defensive, but in the end I got her to publicly announce that she had been *inspired* by me... and to check out my fic. <br><br>    Mess with me. <br><br>     So, basically, I&#39;m saying to just gently prod them at first, not in a review, but a PM, because they get all angry you&#39;re makin&#39; it public, then, if they don&#39;t respond, ask a bit LESS politely. If this goes on, review it. If that doesn&#39;t work and you&#39;re on the brink of tears as they continue plagiarizing, alert the FF.net builders for assistance. <br><br>     -Laly :)</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s the problem: in my third mission I openly stated that the FB-22 is a twin seater fighter/bomber (only a concept IRL, but is a twin seater bomber derived from the F-22 fighter jet), and my duo of agents actually climbed up in one.<br><br>Only, they were in the Ace Combat continuum.

            <p>If out of disguise, Corolla&#39;s six inches tall, so she can fit in one of Sergio&#39;s pockets if needed (she&#39;s actually doing that before the actual mission begins, in order to take a nap while her partner tries to find the Hyacinct&#39;s office).

            <p>What could possibly go wrong? A lot, as it turns out. One of my buddies described <a href="http://sonicshadowlover13.deviantart.com/gallery/?q=shadow+of+the+opera#/d2i6s8a">Shadow of the Opera</a> to me, and even though I&#39;m almost completely unfamiliar with the Sonic franchise, I made her send it to me so I could share it here, because, well, the WTF speaks for itself. I&#39;m not entirely sure the whole thing wasn&#39;t run through Google Translate a few times in a few languages, because English does NOT work that way. From Chapter 1:<br><br>On the rainy night, there was the Opera house with Opera cast. They are mobians. Just then, a young rabbit came up the stage with her chao.<br>&quot;Everyone! We have a new member who will be joining us!&quot; She said excitedly.<br>&quot;Really, Cream?&quot; A pink hedgehog asked. Cream nodded.<br>&quot;Well who is he or she?&quot; A red echidna asked.<br>&quot;She&#39;s a pretty hedgehog. Her name is Maria.&quot; Cream replied. The mobians looked at each other with concern.<br><br>Outside the Opera house, a carriage stopped by. A elder man opened the door for a yellow hedgehog who dresses in a grey jacket and a hat on.<br>&quot;Come out, Miss Maria. Your life is here.&quot; A elder man said impatiently. Maria sighed sadly and stepped out of the carriage. She got her suit case in her hands, her eyes closed, her head was down as she was walking up the stairs. The carriage leaves as Maria opens the door of the Opera house. As she was inside, voices were heard from across the hallway to the doors that leads to the stage. Maria walks to the doors and opens them and saw the cast practicing their acts and singing.<br>&quot;Um.... Hello?&quot; Maria called. A blue hedgehog, Sonic, sees her and smiles at her, he ran up to her.<br>&quot;Hey there! You must be Maria, right?&quot; He asked.<br>&quot;Yes. I was told that I would be here with you.&quot; Maria replied while taking off her hat.<br>&quot;Yeah, we know. And..... we&#39;re sorry about your father.&quot; Sonic says as he scratches his head. Maria closes her eyes again, not showing her tears in her eyes.<br>&quot;You don&#39;t need to be, sir. Though it was very upsetting.&quot; Maria says opening her blue eyes again.<br>&quot;Yeah. Oh! By the way, I&#39;m Sonic the Hedgehog! Let me introduce you everyone else here.&quot; Sonic says while bringing Maria to the stage.<br>&quot;Ahh! You kicked me!&quot; A pink hedgehog yelled at the red echidna who was on the floor and now stood up.<br>&quot;It was an accident, Amy! I slipped!&quot; He yelled.<br>&quot;Hmph! You always &#39;slip&#39;, Knuckles. You&#39;re almost as worse as Silver.&quot; Amy says.<br>&quot;What&#39;d you say?!&quot; A white hedgehog cried.<br>&quot;People!&quot; Sonic yelled., everyone turned to Sonic&#39;s attention and sees Maria. &quot;Everybody, this is Maria. She&#39;s going to be living here with us.&quot; Sonic says. Maria looks at the mobians shyly.<br>&quot;Umm.... Hello there.&quot; She says.<br>&quot;Oh, nice to meet you!&quot; Amy says nicely. &quot;I&#39;m Amy Rose.&quot;<br>&quot;Knuckles the Echidna.&quot;<br>&quot;Rouge the Bat.&quot; The white bat introduced in a rude way. Maria ignores her.<br>&quot;I&#39;m Silver the Hedgehog.&quot; A white hedgehog said. &quot;And this is Blaze the Cat.&quot; The purple cat nodded at Maria.<br>&quot;I&#39;m Miles Prower.&quot; A yellow fox said &quot;But call me &#39;Tails&#39; like everybody else.&quot;<br>&quot;And I am Cream. It&#39;s so nice to meet you, Miss Maria.&quot; The rabbit says with a smile. Maria made a small smile to everyone.<br>&quot;Nice meeting you too.&quot; She says. &quot;Is there a room for me in this place?&quot;<br>&quot;Well of course there is!&quot; A green hedgehog replied. &quot;The name&#39;s Manik, by the way. The room for you is the one on the top floor.&quot; He says.<br>&quot;NO!!!&quot; Everyone cried out except Rouge and Knuckles. Maria was confused.<br>&quot;What?&quot; Manik asked with a funny look.<br>&quot;Maria is NOT staying in that room alone.&quot; Blaze added.<br>&quot;Why not?&quot; Maria asked.<br>&quot;That room is forbidin!&quot; A voice said, a rabbit came out from the shadows. She was wearing a black dress.<br>&quot;Madame Vanilla!&quot; Everyone said.<br>&quot;Mother! You&#39;re here!&quot; Cream says surprisingly.<br>&quot;Hello Cream dear. Maria, I welcome you to the Opera house, but the room from the top floor is forbidin. You have to be in Cream and Amy&#39;s room.&quot; Vanilla says.<br>&quot;But, what&#39;s wrong with that forbidin room?&quot; Maria asks.<br>&quot;It was his room, but never sleeps there anymore. I promised that room of his will never be taken.&quot; Vanilla replied.<br>&quot;&#39;His&#39;? Who&#39;s room is it?&quot; Maria asks.<br>&quot;I can&#39;t say anymore, dear. I&#39;m sorry. Amy, Cream, take Maria to your room that you two will have to share with her.<br>&quot;Yes ma&#39;am.&quot; Amy says walking to the left side where the stairs were. Cream took Maria by the hand by leading her to the stair and the room.<br>Above the girls who are going inside the room, a black figure watches them with red eyes. He then walks away.<br>&quot;A newcomer in my Opera house....&quot; He whispers. &quot;The girl will be well trained here by Madame Vanilla.&quot;</p>

            <p>I&#39;m actually reasonably familiar with both canons, and the name itself is pretty groan worthy, but the thing that really irks me about this piece is not the bad grammar, the outrageous idea, or the fact that &quot;forbidin&quot; can&#39;t be spelled right; but that the author felt it necessary to resurrect Maria as a hedgehog. Maria is actually a canon character, but she&#39;s a human, and dead, who had a sister like relationship with the character portraying the Phantom. For some silly reason, Sonic fanfic authors feel the constant need to bring Maria back as an animal and set her up with a romantic relationship with Shadow, which I&#39;m really really hoping this fanfic isn&#39;t heading towards. It&#39;s one of my biggest pet peeves. &gt;_<br>WHHHHHHHHYYYYY?</p>

            <p>Even without reading theEmily&#39;s post below, I&#39;d be prepared to bet money that Maria and Shadow get together. After all, he seems to be playing the Phantom while she plays the part of Christine (I assume from the title and that extract). Since the Phantom stalks and kidnaps Christine, murders people and threatens to murder the man she loves, we know that their love is clearly meant to be and all fanfic should work to correct the mistake made by Leroux when he split them up.<br><br>[/irritation]<br>[/ sarcasm]</p>

            <p>That&#39;s just… ugh. If you ship XYZ but can&#39;t have an interspecies romance (and I understand if that squicks you,) then you might want to consider switching to an OTP where you <i>don&#39;t</i> have to fundamentally alter the characters&#39; bodies in order for them to have a relationship. This goes for people whose only reason for writing genderflip stuff is &quot;I love Bob/Dave, but I hate slash!&quot; too. <br><br>If you care about having this fic spoiled, I suggest not reading the rest of this message. Otherwise… well, you might want to get someone to restrain you so you don&#39;t spork out your own eyes. <br><br>******HEY, YOU. YEAH, YOU. SPOILERS AHEAD.******<br>According to my friend, who did read all the way through, shenanigans ensue, they &quot;fall in love,&quot; despite barely knowing each other, and then eventually Shadow dies in Maria&#39;s arms… but he gets resurrected in the sequel. Yes, sequel.</p>

            <p>*Gets person to restrain me, then reads spoiler* <br>WHHHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYY? <br>*Proceeds to attempt to spork out own eyes* <br><br>But in all seriousness, I agree. I can be a bit strict when it comes to what I consider to be a canonical/plausible pairing, but if you have to drastically and physically change a character&#39;s body, orientation, or previously established relationships in order to make your OTP work... it just upsets me. A lot. *Sigh*</p>

            <p>Absolutely with you on altering bodies (with a very few exceptions, like allowing someone to grow up) but I can usually grok non-canon pairings— I ship nearly everyone/everyone else. As far as sexual orientation goes, I only get annoyed when writers (fan and otherwise) forget that not everyone is straight or gay. Yes, some people can feel attraction to more than one gender. Shocking, I know. <br><br>Previously established relationships are a little trickier, but as long as rival love interests aren&#39;t vilified I&#39;m pretty okay with a writer going &quot;These two had a thing, but fell out of love with each other and now they&#39;re just good friends.&quot;<br><br>None of which is meant to imply that everyone should approach shipping the way I do. People like what they like, and that&#39;s okay. <br><br>Then, too, in my main fandom it&#39;s possible to make pretty much ANYTHING canon with a little Googling. </p>

            <p>... are the literate bad ones. <br><br>I was reading this Dragon Age fic earlier and it had an interesting concept... and it seemed to address some subtle issues... but the more I read it the more I realized that even though the grammar was good and even though the construction was OK, the whole story revolved around getting the heroine laid over and over again. Somehow her awesome feats of combat were built on excuses. She managed things that would be totally unthinkable. And she bent the rules of the canon in order to be both a warrior and a mage at the same time... <br><br>Yes, the character was different from the norm. And I almost liked the thing. I almost thought it was a goodfic.<br><br>But it was just a literate suefic.<br><br>CURSES.</p>

            <p>First Sue I tackled I found in a fandom that had less than 25 fics (12 on Ffnet and about that many on a number of other sites).<br><br>No spanking fics there, even though one of the mains is a twelve-year-old boy.

            <p>AKA &quot;I knew it was a bad idea. Why did I go looking for Ivanhoe fanfic?&quot;<br><br>Now, in principle I don&#39;t think this is a bad idea. I couldn&#39;t pull it off, but I have only casual knowledge of Harry Potter and don&#39;t really care enough to put the effort into it. And here lies my &quot;Why?&quot;<br><br>The author gave as his/her first justification for why he/she had written this fic that it would require no creative input - just merging Scott&#39;s plot with Rowling&#39;s characters.<br><br>Why? Why, author, do you claim to love Ivanhoe and yet say that giving it an entirely new cast will require no effort? The only way that would be possible would be to simply do a find-and-replace on the names, but then why even bother? If I want to read Ivanhoe, I&#39;ll read Ivanhoe. You say it&#39;s an AU and you care more about characterisation than canon (by which I assume you mean plot) but how then can you say that this will require no creative effort on your part?<br><br>Why, author?<br><br>(And why do I keep being surprised and upset by this sort of thing?)</p>

            <p>So, guess what anime I&#39;ve been watching recently? <br><br>Alright, so despite only being at episode 12 so far (nevertheless the manga!) I&#39;ve already started to think about how missions and the like would be handled in this continuum. There&#39;s only been a mention of it on the &#39;Exotic Weapons&#39; page and a badfic (which seems to have been deleted) on the unclaimed badfics page. So, I thought it might be a nice idea to have a bit of a discussion/debate/contemplation about how missions in the continuum would work. I would think that bad slash and the like would be basically the same, but what about assassinating &#39;Sues? (Especially since they&#39;re likely to be meisters and/or the weapons themselves.) Would they be a Kishin Egg? Would they be a &#39;Sue Egg&#39;? (Maybe not <i>that</i> special/weird...) Could assassination attempts be normal or would something else have to be done in order to kill SE &#39;Sues? (I vaguely have the idea that I&#39;m over-thinking this, but it&#39;s some good brain food, no?)<br><br>Also, feel free to bring up other things I haven&#39;t thought about yet, especially if there would be some fundamental differences between fics based on the anime or the manga. Like I said, I haven&#39;t read the manga yet and despite knowing that the anime deviates near its end from the manga I&#39;m unsure if there&#39;s any other points that would need attention in that arena. </p>

            <p>Your RC number has the last three digits of the RC number I was thinking of using! It&#39;ll be a long time before I have permission, so there is a very good chance I’ll end up changing it, (especially if you chose it for the same reason I chose it) but seriously, what are the chances of that? Are you by chance an animation/Pixar fan? :D <br><br>As for needing a beta, I&#39;ve never beta-ed anything before, and I&#39;ve only started seriously writing in about the last 6 months or so; but I think your example was great. You managed to get both back-stories and descriptions in in a way that didn&#39;t slow down or clog the narrative, and it was short, sweet and to the point, which is exactly how I think an introduction should be. Also, I liked the short bit with the SO. XD I don’t think it needs to be changed or anything, but you might want to be a second opinion, just in case. c: <br></p>

            <p>people posting their missions as Google Docs. I rarely read them. My preferred browser and Google Docs don&#39;t seem to work well together, that&#39;s one problem.

            <p>We&#39;ve not had a birthday anouncement for a while, so I thought I&#39;d start up the tradition again, so here goes: as of today, August twenty-third, I&#39;m twenty-three. My fourth birthday with the Board, and I hope not my last. :D<br><br>Party in the Large Auditorium, everyone! I&#39;ve got the party food and drinks set up already, a number of games, and a whole pile of music. Go nuts!</p>

            <p>Rather, it was three days ago. Totally forgot to say something on the Board, mainly because the night previously I&#39;d been laid low by food poisoning, so it&#39;s sort of been the last thing on my mind for the past couple of days. (I&#39;m better now, though.) Pleased to say I&#39;m now a legal adult and can now access those livejournal accounts without having to log off first.<br><br>Happy birthday!

            <p>Hiya, everyone. I&#39;m new around here, and I thought I should introduce myself.<br><br>You can call me Catfish, if you like. I&#39;d like to be a writer of some sort for a career, but I&#39;m still pretty young and I&#39;d like to practice more. If not, I&#39;d go for programming or veterinarian-ing. Vet-ing? <br><br>I found the PPC about a year ago after reading about it in an OFU, and I&#39;ve been hooked ever since. I&#39;ve read all of the original stuff, and I finally decided to be a part of it all. You all seem like pretty awesome people, and I hope I fit in with all of that.</p>

            <p>Frodo will only be part of the framing story. He&#39;s reading Bilbo&#39;s story, and it will end with him putting the book down and embarking on the voyage to the Grey Havens.<br><br>I&#39;m excited because of Martin Freeman as Bilbo and Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug and Sauron. Mainly because I&#39;m a shameless Sherlock fan, of course. Forget the badfic, I&#39;m looking forward to the movie!</p>

            <p>I can see one way in which Frodo can be involved without it being bad, and that is if the story is framed as Bilbo telling Frodo about the adventures. Part of me thinks this would, in fact, be an excellent way of doing it as it would allow Bilbo&#39;s thoughts to be expressed in a reasonable way.<br><br>My preemptive revue: The book is better. :D</p>

            <p>I did find her birth year ironic though. Seriously? 1984? <br><br>I <i>especially</i> liked these lines in the second chapter: &quot;I was intent on writing a fanfiction today, of course, one that starred Maccus and an OC who&#39;s pretty much me. Some people may call it Mary - sueish, but I don&#39;t care.&quot; And why would she be college age when she&#39;s 17? The Mary Sue is an idiot too; five seconds means it&#39;s about a mile away, not five. And no way would you go out when there&#39;s a storm on a beach- I&#39;ve been to the coast when it&#39;s just been raining hard and it&#39;s really nasty weather. Such a <i>brilliant</i> figure.<br><br>And isn&#39;t Tori a nickname for &#39;Victoria&#39;? Wow. Just wow.</p>

            <p>Well, at least in Scotland, up to your fourth year in high school is mandatory, at the end of which you will be at least almost 16. Fifth year and sixth year are optional, but almost everyone will take fifth year at least because that&#39;s the year in which you do your highers and they are necessary to get into college or university on a full time course.<br><br>Assuming you make an application to join a college or university in your fifth year(at which point you could only be given a conditional offer which means they make a couple of expectations for your results which you MUST meet to get in, in sixth year your previous acheivements might merit you an unconditional offer) you could be in college or uni at age 17. This is not recommended, however... most places suggest you wait until the year you turn 18 to make an application, for numerous reasons.</p>

            <p>Just from the opening paragraph alone, this looks bad. For starters, she has her math off... (It is impossible to be born in 1984, ANY kind of PotC fan, and seventeen.

            <p>Okay. So I&#39;ve started a chapter-by-chapter reviewing thing of this fic, because, you know, I sent her one not-so-positive review, and she didn&#39;t respond with a flame, so that&#39;s a start. I&#39;m also archiving it in case she takes my advice and changes the bad, so that way if someone wants to, they can still spork the original that got such glowing reviews. <br><br>The worst part? She has a chick who helps her make sure her character isn&#39;t a Mary Sue. &gt;.<br> </p>

            <p>Okay, I&#39;ve hammering out the details for quite some time, and I think I&#39;m ready to ask for Permission:<br><br>Name: Agent Gijinka<br>Appearance: About 5’2, slightly hefty, short brown hair, blue eyes, wears glasses<br>Race: Human<br>Home Continuum: Earth-1<br>Department: Floaters<br>Response Center: 113<br>Partner: Agent Keats<br>Fandoms: Doctor Who, Yu-Gi-Oh, Tales of Symphonia, Kingdom Hearts, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Wicked, Red Vs Blue, Redwall, Harry Potter, Digimon, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, TGWTG, Marvel/DC, Scott Pilgrim, Axis Powers Hetalia, Pirates of the Caribbean, Pokemon, District 9<br>Lust Objects: The 10th Doctor (Doctor Who), Cloud Strife (Final Fantasy VII), Tommy Oliver (Power Rangers), Will Turner (Pirates of the Caribbean),  Legolas (Lord of the Rings), Ichigo Kurosaki (Bleach), Regal Bryant (Tales of Symphonia), Jacob Black (Twilight), Germany (Axis Powers Hetalia)<br>Likes: Reading, writing, drawing, killing Sues, Cute Things, listening to music, quoting fictional series, sleeping, good fan fiction,  happy endings, transformations<br>Dislikes: Mary Sues, anything rape-related, Fan Dumb, unfair character bashing, child abuse, Twilight, tweenies/fan brats, close-minded people, zombies, misogynists, when series she likes are screwed with.<br>Weapons: She isn’t really picky, and likes to get… “creative” with her kills.<br>Bio: Gijinka is somewhat of a mixed bag, personality-wise. On the one hand, she is generally cheerful, easy-going, laid back, and at times, downright immature. However, she also can be bad-tempered, impatient, sarcastic and cynical with a sardonic sense of humor. Gijinka is open-minded with a strong sense of justice, and absolutely hates it when things she likes are messed with. Gijinka has a weakness for cute things, a tendency to ramble when she’s excited, as well as a transformation fetish that she&#39;s a bit embarrassed about. <br><br>Name: Agent Keats<br>Appearance:  About 5’8, lightly tanned skin with a scar across his nose, longish red hair, hazel eyes<br>Race: Half-Elf<br>Home Continuum: Tales of Symphonia<br>Department: Floaters<br>Response Center: 113<br>Partner: Agent Gijinka<br>Fandoms: Power Rangers, Generator Rex, Tales of Symphonia, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Pirates of the Caribbean, Kingdom Hearts, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, NCIS, Fight Club, Cowboy Bebop, Resident Evil, South Park, Gorillaz, Gargoyles, Redwall, Firefly, Death Note, District 9<br>Lust Objects: Sheena Fujibayashi (Tales of Symphonia), Judith (Tales of Vesperia), Tifa Lockhart (Final Fantasy VII), Ada Wong (Resident Evil), Buffy Summers (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Ziva David (NCIS)<br>Likes: Martial arts, killing Sues, listening to music (he  prefers classic rock, heavy metal and alternative), martial arts/horror films, girls who kick ass, reading, video games<br>Dislikes: Being mistaken for an elf, Mary Sues, anything rape-related, Fan Dumb, unfair character bashing, child abuse, Twilight, tweenies/fan brats, heights, spiders<br>Weapons: A double-handed broadsword, but will use guns if he needs to; he also has picked up a few basic  spells (Fireball, Stalagmite, Wind Blade, Aqua Edge, First Aid), but tends to use them sparingly. <br>Bio: Keats is an former nameless Renegade from the Tales of Symphonia continuum who fell through a plot hole and into HQ after a particularly bad bit of Suefic logic. After some confusion, he reluctantly resigned joined the PPC, though he did take an interest in some of the other continuums he picked up in training.  The more level-headed of the two, Keats is often the one who has to restrain his partner when she flies into her rages. Keats is rather snarky and has a wicked sense of humor, as well as a soft side that prefers not to show. In his free time, Keats likes reading, listening to music, and either playing video games or watching movies. He occasionally smokes Blepettes and while his preferred profanity comes from his Home Continuum ( for instance, using ‘Goddess’ instead of ‘God’- long story there), he has also gleaned some Mandarin from watching Firefly (it might not be totally correct, but  he enjoys how it sounds).<br><br>Writing Sample: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/178oGyJ_us6EXl0HIWzqTublyNPijT05kV-7Hp3KohVM/edit?hl=en_US"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/178oGyJ_us6EXl0HIWzqTublyNPijT05kV-7Hp3KohVM/edit?hl=en_US">https://docs.google.com/document/d/178oGyJ_us6EXl0HIWzqTublyNPijT05kV-7Hp3KohVM/edit?hl=en_US</a></a>#<br><br>And the fic I want to slay is called &quot;Should Have&quot;, of the Wicked fandom... though with this fic, that&#39;s not saying much. <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5055279/1/Should_Have"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5055279/1/Should_Have">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5055279/1/Should_Have</a></a><br>How bad is it, you might ask?

            <p>I&#39;m going to say yes. <i>Don&#39;t stop reading</i>! I&#39;m glad you had a few people give it a once-over, and you clearly were careful on punctuation and spelling, but you&#39;ve got some issues to work out, there. The first is easy-- formatting. You have line breaks for paragraphs, and you appear to be doing quotations right, but <i>please</i> either indent your new paragraphs or leave a line of space between them. Once-overs are good, but you could use a beta as well-- I would volunteer, but I&#39;m a terrible procrastinator. If you can catch me on Gtalk (Vixenmage at gmail), or on the IRC, though, I&#39;m usually up to go over bits and bobs with a fine-toothed comb. Ish. Medium-toothed, anyway.<br><br>So, you&#39;ve got permission, but I would greatly appreciate formatting fixes in the future. Sound good?</p>

            <p>As a plot point in my first mission, I mention that Portia McSweeney, Intelligence Intern, has requested to be declared &quot;Summarily Unfit&quot; for duty in the Harry Potter fandom.  The Major part of this has to to with me becoming bored of the series after book 5 (around the time I discovered Discworld) and for petty, shipping war related reasons on part of both me and my character (only read the start of HBP and swore on the graves of my pets never to open DH nor read the epilogue).  <br><br>In character, there are also psychological reasons for the request, as Canonical R/Hr and H/G pairings have caused Portia, in the past, considerable, brooding anger and she fears massive bias in her scouting (such as mistaking canonical arse-ishness and personality changes for character breaches).  Basically, her only remaining link to the world is a warm, fluffy sea of constantly H/Hr or non-OBHWF fanfic.  However, she has also requested fitness exams for Discworld, Escaflowne, Gargoyles and various other fandoms where she has no such qualms.<br><br>However, since I wanted to scout out the bigger crimes against canon, the Church and Good Taste in the H/Hr fic I claimed, I would like to ask if, after issuing such a ruling, a one-report hold back is required to see how badly further reports might be botched.  And could I write it as such, or is there some other procedure that is followed?</p>

            <p>does not mean she was granted the &quot;Summarily Unfit&quot; label, or even that her request was processed. <br><br>So, unless you write that she is found unfit for HP fandom, she can be sent on missions there.<br><br>And even if she is found unfit, she can probably still be sent on missions there, because of rule of funny (and bad record keeping).</p>

            <p>Well, my first fanfic that I read was a Percy Jackson one, so during the time where I was obsessed with PJO, I&#39;d had my share of badfics. Most of them included a &#39;Sue pairing up with Nico di Angelo. I also found a parody sue, where legions of &#39;Sues attack Nico and Camp Half Blood battles the &#39;Sues in a parodical fashion. Anyways, if you have enough agents, (sorry, but I am a supporter and Boarder, but not an agent) on ff.net, go to the genre &quot;romance&quot; and  have the primary character as Nico, and there you go! A heck of a lot of Glaurunging PJO &#39;Suefics.</p>

            <p>And don&#39;t be intimidated by the capital letter. Permission is basically just our way of ensuring that people who write PPC stories are actually doing so in the spirit of the PPC. You know, not making Mary Sue Agents, using proper grammar and spelling, not injecting chatspeak or that sort of thing. All it really takes to get permission is to hang around on the board or the IRC for a while and take advice when given. <br><br>Here, have a Link: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">This</a> should explain what the permission system is and why we have it, but be sure to ask if you have any questions after reading it....<br><br>So, have you read <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> yet?

            <p>G&#39;Day, Board. You might not remember me, but I was a small-timer who came across the Board way back in April. Now, admittedly, with real-life concerns, I wasn&#39;t able to check in here as often as I liked, but after reading into what was done over that time and what the PPC stand for, I have an interest of taking a more active part in it all.<br><br>I already have a fairly good idea about what goes on, but I have a question (the first of many, I hope!): when it comes to selecting badfic to be utilised in your material, what triggers should someone examine (besides obvious signs, like bad spelling and grammer)? In addition, is there any specific proceedure regarding these &quot;sporkings&quot;, such as notifying the author in advance or already conducting a review on said fic to see what happens?<br><br>Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d like to disagree though that bad spelling and grammar is an obvious sign of badfic. Though it certainly isn&#39;t a characteristic of goodfic, I don&#39;t agree with the implication that only fic with bad spelling and grammar is sporkable. I&#39;ve PPCed a few fics that actually had excellent spelling and grammar. I even complimented one of the Sues on this (after the charging she asked: &quot;Wasn&#39;t there anything you liked?&quot; The charging agent replied: &quot;Your spelling was good.&quot;).<br><br>For me an obvious sign of a badfic is a plot that doesn&#39;t work, because it is contrived, or because all the canon characters seem to be replaced by wax statues or cardboard cutouts.<br><br>The most obvious sign is that I am making riffs while reading it for the first time. That means a story is bad and it means I can be funny about it. There&#39;s no point in writing a PPC mission if it&#39;s not going to be funny.<br><br>There&#39;s no addition procedure. I often (but not always) review the fic before I PPC it, pointing out some of the issues (not all, because you&#39;d be left without material for a mission and you&#39;d overwhelm the author). If and how the author responds is not really important for how I proceed. Unless that respond is: thanks, I will rewrite completely. I&#39;ve only had that response twice on a review, once for a story I wanted to mission. I asked that author if she was okay with a PPC mission of the original story. She had to think about it, but after a few weeks (by which time I had already written the mission) she said &quot;Okay&quot;. Incidentally, I didn&#39;t kill that Sue; I let her die of the injuries sustained in the story, but with her admitting she had erred.<br><br>I used to notify authors before posting a PPC mission. Just a friendly message that I wrote a spoof about their character and if they felt personally attached to that character they probably didn&#39;t want to read my story. I post on FFnet so it&#39;s relatively easy for badficcers to come across my sporking of their fics. I stopped doing that a while ago. I think it&#39;s because I wanted to notify someone that turned out to have me blocked after a review I left. Interestingly, this author put up an author&#39;s note on her latest chapter saying I should have contacted her about posting my PPC mission. (Mind boggles)<br><br>Others will probably advise you not to notify authors in advance to avoid flame wars, but I haven&#39;t actually ever been flamed by any of the badficcers. So, it&#39;s really up to you whether you send the author a polite message or not.</p>

            <p>I wasn&#39;t here back in April, but welcome back all the same. ^^<br><br>As for selecting fics, it is very much a question of personal preference and taste.<br>Besides horrible spelling and grammar, things you can look for are canon-breaks, out-of-character characters and Sues. The wiki [light shines down and a choir of angels is heard] has this entry on badfics, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Badfic"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Badfic">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Badfic</a></a> you can check out to get ideas.<br>You should however first and foremost look for something that can be sporked in a funny way. When you read a potential badfic, you can try MSTing for yourself and see if it gives you any ideas.<br><br>As for your questions, we do not notify the author, neither before nor after we spork their fic. It is considered something like a personal attack on the author, and besides it attracts whiners and flamers and we don&#39;t want them.<br>If you want to give them a helpful review before sporking, feel free to do so, but it is in no way required. Also, for truly terrible badfics, it can be impossible to give reviews, that isn&#39;t simply: &quot;Oh god, the stupid! It burns!&quot;<br><br>Hope this was helpful; otherwise feel free to ask again. There are wiser and more experienced persons than me who can help out.</p>

            <p>I posted this about a page ago, but no one responded telling me if I passed or failed, and if I did fail, why. So I decided to post it again. Umm, sorry if that&#39;s annoying or against the rules. Just tell me , &#39;k?<br>Alright, down to business.<br>Character Bios:<br><br>Name:Flynn Lamare<br>Sex: Female<br>Age: 16<br>Home: Earth<br>Department: Department of Floaters<br>Appearance: She is a skinny, underdeveloped teenager with short, dirty blonde hair and blue eyes. She normally wears a black sweatshirt with the floater patch, a skort of varying color, and multicolored knee-high socks.<br>History: Flynn was an ordinary, if very geeky, teen. While riding her bike to school one day, she fell into a plot hole which led to HQ and ended up running into a wall so hard she knocked herself unconscious. A wandering agent found her and, after a quick trip to medical, recruited her.<br>Personality: She is bubbly and cheerful most of the time, only really getting mad when confronted with a paticularly bad mary sue or something else in a fic that really offends her. However, she is very absentminded and flighty. She also has a horrible weakness for cute things, though the cute things in question normally end up biting her. Often, she doesn&#39;t take missions very seriously and has on numerous occasions risked discovery going after a particularly nice bit of loot.<br>Weapon of Choice: A nice big crowbar. Or umbrella.<br>Fandoms: Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Naruto, Bleach, Doctor Who, Glee, Pokemon, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Stargate Atlantis, Star Trek 2009<br>Lust Objects: Elrond, Aang, Rodney McKay<br>Partner: Teknishun<br><br>Name: Teknishun (Tek)<br>Sex: Male<br>Age: 28<br>Home: Stargate &#39;Verse<br>Department: Department of Floaters<br>Appearance: He is a very ordinary looking young man, with mousy brown hair and brown eyes. He prefers to wear military issue BDU&#39;s and combat boots from his home continuum with all the patches replaced with PPC ones.<br>History: Tek was born in a bad Stargate SG-1 fanfic. He attempted to attack the Goa&#39;uld sue that had broken into Stargate Command and was promptly killed, both to show off her evulness and to give the human sue inside something to wangst about later on in the fic. Before he died, the agents sent to the fic brought him back to HQ and recruited him. His name comes from the author&#39;s misspelling of his former job as a &#39;gate technician.<br>He was first put into DoSAT (probably due to his name) but quickly learned that he is absolutely hopeless at operating any kind of technology that runs on nonsenseoleum. So he was transferred into the department of floaters and paired up with Flynn.<br>Personality: Tek is dry, sarcastic, and fond of pointing out the obvious. He is very military in his attitude, sticking by procedure as much as possible. He is unfortunately a bit of a prude, which causes him to suffer more than most when sent on bad slash or bad het missions. He also has a huge chocolate addiction, choosing to ingest his bleeprin mostly through NMs&amp;NMs. He always carries some type of chocolate around with him and eats it whenever he can.<br>Weapon of Choice: P-90 or any other long ranged weapon<br>Fandoms:Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Stargate &#39;Verse, Doctor Who, Firefly, Halo, Star Trek, Star Wars, Batman (movies)<br>Lust Objects:Samantha Carter, Kaylee Frye, Jennifer Keller<br>Partner: Flynn<br><br>My writing sample is here:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6866200/1/bEscaping_b_the_bLine_b">In Which I Attempt to Make Bella Swan a Likeable Character by Having Jigsaw Play a Game With Her</a><br>And the fic I plan to do first is <a href="http://www.kinsfire.net/viewstory.php?sid=3">here</a>.

            <p>For the record, just so you don&#39;t wind up saying this about Sues or Stus in the future, I should point out that Agents don&#39;t torture. <s>I could also go on a rant about torture as a plot device, or breathlessly plug Boz4pm&#39;s <i>Don&#39;t Panic!</i> series as, among other things, a well-researched study of PTSD, but...</s> Just so you know. Attempting to write a redemption of a character involving past traumas is not in any way the same as having your agents torture an OC or other character. And talking about it, or saying &quot;S/he deserves to be [insert appalling torment here] and someone should!&quot; is generally a bad idea. We do try not to be bullies.</p>

            <p>(It&#39;s definitely not against the rules to re-post a request if no PG has had a chance to answer it, so don&#39;t worry about that.)<br><br>To start with, I rather like your agents. They&#39;re a bit flat, but a few missions would flesh them out well and there&#39;s potential for a lot of amusing clashes. <br><br>But your writing sample has several problems, most of which seem to be caused by carelessness. You are missing capitals in several names, such as &quot;Isabella <b>s</b>wan&quot; and &quot;<b>f</b>orks&quot;. You have several punctuation probelms, uch as putting the commas and full stops ending dialogue outside the relevant quotation marks, using a full stop to end dialogue when a tag (starting with a lower-case word) is still to follow, and in some cases punctuation (quotation marks, full stops) is missing entirely. There are similar mistakes in your agent bios.<br><br>As for the writing itself, your narrative did keep me interested - any attempt to reform that girl wins in my book! - but the structure of your sentences sometimes felt forced. To be honest, exchanging Bella&#39;s angsty-teenager-ness for the trauma of a torture surviour doesn&#39;t make her more likeable. On the other hand, the way you were writing her <i>is</i> what kept my interest - she felt like a real person, especially in the first few paragraphs, with the red eye flight and the mental rant about her stepfather - and I feel that you could make a much better reformation story out of this by removing the torture and crossover and just re-writing her story straight. So, points for that. <br><br>I think you could write missions quite well and would be glad to give you Permission if not for the sheer number of simple mistakes that you don&#39;t seem to have bothered to correct. Please, take some time to review your punctuation in detail before posting, get a beta to double-check, and re-apply when you&#39;re confident that you will spot all the tiny errors in a badfic as well as the big issues. <br><br>As a side note, your DragonOfLore bio says you&#39;re thirteen - am I right to guess, given that you posted your first fic there in 2008, that this is just out of date? (Do forgive me if you&#39;ve said this elsewhere - I&#39;m a tad rushed and can&#39;t find back your introduction post.)<br><br>Also, it&#39;s poor form to give us a link to the badfic that we can&#39;t follow. I realise you didn&#39;t make it a registered-access-only, but the summary you gave, while showing how appalling it is, doesn&#39;t let me see the actual prose if the badfic, and therefore, what sort of smaller errors it has and at what frequency. This isn&#39;t a deciding factor, but it does make life difficult.<br><br>So. Permission denied. I&#39;m sorry. Please know that you can re-apply anytime, as soon as the above issues are fixed. </p>

            <p>Congratsi :)<br><br>A few comments: <br><br>I like your writing - it&#39;s engaging. And your creativity is good and PPCish - the hologram waterfall and adjacent graffiti made me laugh. I also like the agents you&#39;ve sketched out in your bios; they&#39;re fairly unique and have a good deal of potential. In practice, however, you lean a little bit towards speshulness - having Ally be so notorious that a dozen or more agents won&#39;t work with her, and spending ten words describing Grace&#39;s hair in her first paragraph, for instance. It&#39;s not terrible. Just be aware of your tendency to do this and you should be fine. <br><br>I also have a problem with your characterisation of the Sunflower Official - characterisation is, of course, a subjective thing, but I can&#39;t see him saying that he &quot;thought it best not to insist&quot; when agents threaten him. The SO I remember reading in TOS is a lot more firm than that, regardless of threats. So please keep an eye on that too, and perhaps re-write some parts of that scene?<br><br>Also, I don&#39;t think the SO can nod, nor that he has an intern acting as a secretary, nor that anyone in the PPC would (dare to) move someone else&#39;s belongings. However, these are relatively minor. Again, it&#39;s something to keep in mind, not bad enough to be denied Permission. As, obviously, I haven&#39;t. <br><br>Overall, you&#39;re good to go. Have fun :)</p>

            <p>I believe there IS an OS bit where Jay or Acacia threatens the Sunflower Official. He did get a little apprehensive. But he still doesn&#39;t do a 360.<br><br>If that makes sense.

            <p>I probably should have phrased myself a little better.

            <p>Well, because the more insane something sounds to me, the more attractive it sounds. Well, with certain things: memorization, for example.<br><br>I thought the Lay was going to be 200-300 lines. But no. It&#39;s several thousand lines long. <br><br>I thought I wouldn&#39;t make it past line 200, but I&#39;m on line 230 and I can still remember the first lines. So it will take me most of my adult life, but it will be done.<br><br>:)<br><br>And if you like that sort of thing, go for a sonnet. Because I love Tolkien, but sometimes memorizing the Lay feels like work. My two sonnets didn&#39;t. Neither did the Julius Caesar speeches. <br><br>It is fun, but it has its ups and downs like writing.</p>

            <p>...is less whether or not it will happen and more that we need to figure out exactly WHAT causes the Mini-sue to spawn. Because no matter what happens, a Mini-Sue WILL spawn from that mistake.<br><br>So in that... you can either have the Mini-Sue show up once and have it attributed to how it&#39;s spelled in the title, or force your agents to have to murder a Mini-Sue constantly because the fic keeps spelling it wrong.<br><br>I say: go with whatever the Narrative Law of Comedy will work best with.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been wondering this for a while (mostly in Narnia). If an author misspells a canon name, or uses incorrect punctuation/pluralization/whatever, but the mistake created is still a valid word in the continuum, is it a mini?<br><br>E.g. someone saying &quot;the Pevensie&#39;s all lived in Finchley.&quot; Pevensie&#39;s is an incorrect usage, but is a real word, so would it create a mini or not?<br><br>Other examples would be &quot;that&#39;s Calormen food&quot; or using &quot;Helen&quot; to refer to the movieverse person Helaine.<br><br>Legitimate word used incorrectly = mini. Yes? No? Maybe so?</p>

            <p>It is common that when someone uses plural s instead of posessive, it creates one or more copies of whatever is being discussed.<br>Likewise, when someone uses possesive instead of plural, you can make something out of it. In the excample you mention it could create &quot;the Pevensie&#39;s all&quot;. What an &quot;all&quot; is and how it looks, would then be up to you to decide.<br><br>However, I don&#39;t think that there are any hard and fast rules for what excactly creates and a mini and what makes other kinds of shenanigans. I have seen other writes do it differently and never seen them geting corrected for it. My preferences also has a lot to do with the fact that a) they give room for other kinds of comedy than simply having a mini appear and b) they keep the number of minis down.<br><br>Using a common spelling for an uncommon name, would definitely produce a mini. Unless you have a amusing idea for doing something else with the misspelling, in which case the Rule of Funny applies.<br>In my second mission the author wrote &quot;Wildlings&quot; instead of &quot;Wilders&quot; and rather than making a mini, I chose to have some Wildlings from A Game of Thrones appear. I was up to my eyebrows in minis in that mission, so it was nice to do something else.</p>

            <p>I can see an author using words like that, but considering that she also used words like &#39;conductive themselves&#39;, I find it hard to believe that she is actually trying to use it.

I think that the excact point where my agents would have been screaming and clawing at the door to get out was &quot;IT’S A DAMN SHAME TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE ADULTS OUT THERE WHO CANNOT CONDUCTIVE THEMSELVES IN THE SIMPLEST MANORS THEIR PARENTS HAVE TAUGHT THEM!&quot;<br><br>I love your MST and, as always, I also love your agents.

            <p>Hey guys.<br><br>Well, since I&#39;ll be here for a month before I potentially get cracking, I have delved into the Unclaimed Badfic section and am currently discetting a possible fic to spork: &quot;Commissar Cain in deep&quot;. Problem is, I am about halfway through and already my notes are screaming at me in ire - thank heavens for the summary at the beginning, whoever typed that warning out.<br><br>On another note, I have a couple of questions.<br><br>Fist, the Department of Floaters: do they have a specific equipment loadout like the anti-Suers/Slashers/Plot-Holers, or do they select the appropriate equipment based on their best analysis to deal woth the mission at hand?<br><br>Second, oweing to the fact that they have to traverse multiple universes, which are usually not their resident universe, are agents able to procure or have forged appropriate weapons for the mission, regardless of rarity (with the exception of unique items, such as the One Ring from LoTR)?</p>

            <p>*dodges the fist of the first question* Floaters are basically the &quot;overflow&quot; department: they are supposed to be able to spork whatever fic they get, so they tend to have &quot;basic&quot; equipment (Remote Activator for portals, CADs and so on), plus the things needed for the particular mission (weapons for Sue slaying, canon sources for exorcism, et cetera). However, feel free to play out this as you like: if the Agents lack the right tech, they have to improvise, and improvisation is equal to laughs.<br><br>About weapons, we have an Armoury in HQ, so nearly every standard weapon is avaible. The best course of action IMHO is to get a sword/other melee weapon and a gun, in order to cover most continua. Sometimes weapons can be &quot;obtained&quot; as part of the disguise if it is iconical to whatever the Agent is disguising as (such as blasters for Star Wars clone troopers/imperial army)</p>

            <p>Hmm, I see.<br><br>The reason I am asking is that, regarding the potential sporking (which I&#39;ll have to delay until a month and a half from now) is that the fic in question is basically mindless PWP - and on top of that, it is bad.

            <p>Yeah, that&#39;s about right. The DORKS is a hologram-like costume, it makes you look like a canonical but nothing more. The Disguise Generator, instead, allows you to become a canonically-correct character (so, not only it would give you Force when disguised as a Jedi, you ARE physically a Jedi)</p>

            <p>Yes, anything that requires training is not going to be covered by the disguise generator.  Unfortunately, for the original question, Force powers require extensive training.  So, disguising as a Jedi could give you the ability to use the Force, but it will not give you the training to use it effectively.  That could lead to a lot of comedy, though.</p>

            <p>Partly, I really want to start a discussion on all of the above! The poking and prodding of various factors on the &quot;The label of &#39;Mary Sue&#39; is being used as a bat for sexism&quot; camp is making more sense to me as time goes on, and I see female characters get bashed for things they shouldn&#39;t, and male characters given a sort of pass on the whole thing.<br><br>And part of me just wants company to snark mightily at this ridiculous <a href="http://www.kevinhearne.com/books">Canon Stu</a>. Seriously, can you say wish-fulfillment self-insert fantasy? He keeps using the word &#39;druid,&#39; but I do not think it means what he thinks it means.<br><br>But seriously, I&#39;ve been talking this over with a friend a lot, after Tamora Pierce linked some very, very interesting things on her Livejournal. I&#39;ve been a fan of her books for ages, they&#39;re part of what got me into fantasy, and she has earned a great deal of respect from me. So when I see her snarking at users of the term Mary Sue*, openly, in a comment thread, part of me shrivels up into a dark corner. And when I see novels like <a href="http://ferretbrain.com/articles/article-751">this</a> praised and exalted, while I know-- <i>know</i> that a female protagonist doing half of that would be laughed out of the genre, it stings. And it makes me wonder.<br><br>And then I go onto the IRC, and talk to people, and get into passionate arguments about why, precisely, being Teh Awesome does not a Mary Sue make. What it comes down to, for me, is this. Does a character <i>matter</i>? Are they their author&#39;s best traits and <s>tragically misunderstood traits</s> &#39;flaws&#39; welded onto a fantasized face and body, and dropped into a universe of the author&#39;s choice, where all who surround them seethe with jealousy of swoon with adoration? That&#39;s the key, for me. In &#39;Suedom,&#39; by Andy and Saphie, where the two people get dropped into LotR and discover that they themselves are Sues-- the wilver hair and giant mammary glands only come in the second chapter. The real &quot;Oh God We&#39;re Sues&quot; moment comes when Bilbo drops to one knee and begins to recite bad Shakespearean at them. (Also he&#39;s lacking in the sniffles and in the wrong time, but you know what I&#39;m at.) It just burns-- I see close friends, feminists, talking about the sexism of the Sue label, and then I come back to the PPC and find someone has changed &quot;A Suethor will put his/her whatever&quot; into &quot;A Suethor will put her whatever,&quot; with the explanation that a lot of Suethors are female.<br><br>I like this community, because for me it&#39;s always been a bunch of fringe-loving geeks (I mean, come on-- we&#39;re on the fringe of a subgenre <i>of</i> a subgenre), a supportive place for people looking for concrit and help growing as writers, a place to cower from the awful standards of most fiction, fan-based and otherwise... the works. It&#39;s home. But when Tamora Pierce is gnashing her teeth about the word Sue being sexist, and I come back to people going &quot;Well, this girl&#39;s a Stu, she&#39;s really powerful and beautiful and an orphan and that just says it all, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; ...I wonder.<br><br>So, I guess this is part rambling, as per the Constitution, part plug of a seriously-wtf series, and part legitimate question. What is it that makes a Sue a Sue, a Stu a Stu?<br><br>For my own answer, I&#39;d say the character. I think it was DML who posted the best litmus test I&#39;ve ever seen, seriously-- I don&#39;t care that your OC&#39;s got rare and uncommon beauty, is a good fighter-- hell, if you&#39;ve got a good explanation as to why, special powers. But that&#39;s the key, for me. What makes a character <i>good</i> isn&#39;t their normality and ability to not outshine or bend anything or anyone, ever. It&#39;s in the word: <i>character</i>. If she&#39;s got a name like Chiannariel Moonswaternight, but she&#39;s believable, her story works, she&#39;s got <i>depth</i> and personality and character, I don&#39;t bloody care, she&#39;s not a Sue in my book. If an OC has the unremarkable name John Doe, he doesn&#39;t have any special powers or overshining beauty, but he&#39;s flat and floppy and clearly the self-insert of an unimaginative high-schooler... he&#39;s a Stu! <br><br>I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m getting too worked up for this; I definitely don&#39;t have the spoons to post it, and there&#39;s a huge number of brief threads up already-- hey, Huinesoron&#39;s goodfic-crit-thread is off, I&#39;m sorry I never got a chance to post there. Ah, well. I&#39;m done rambling.<br><br>...Thoughts, anyone still reading?<br><br>*For reference? A snippet: <i>And people who characterize those non-mainstream characters as Mary Sues don&#39;t read, don&#39;t know their literary history, don&#39;t know their social history, and don&#39;t know their feminist history. Until they know any of these, and perhaps political history as well, there&#39;s no point in talking to them, because they don&#39;t even speak the same dialect as a person with a modicum of education in the real world.</i></p>

            <p>...is probably already <a href="http://the-ppc.livejournal.com/52523.html#cutid1">here</a>. <br><br>In a nutshell: just because some people misuse terms like &quot;Mary Sue&quot; doesn&#39;t mean we should stop using the term altogether. We have our own definition, and it fits the general definition that&#39;s in Wikipedia, so I don&#39;t think a terminology change is in order.<br><br>What makes a Sue? For me, it&#39;s <i>proportion</i>. Does the character have mighty powers? Okay. Does no one, not even the antagonists, have powers as great? Not okay. Is the character gorgeous? Fine. Is the character the <i>only</i> person so described in the entire story? Not fine. Does the character have legendary weaponry? Great. Does the character have legendary weaponry, amazing looks, a cute animal friend, magical abilities, and an angsty tragic past...a combination of which none of the villains could hope to match? Why hello there, Drizzt Do&#39;Urden. What a surprise that <i>you</i> always come out on top!<br><br>The analogy I like to use is the SIMs. You know how in the SIMs game you have a certain amount of skill/personality points to begin with, and you have to choose how to distribute them? For example, your SIM can be a social butterfly...but will then have to be a total slob to compensate. You can&#39;t just have all of the personality traits be set on maximum, because...well, because then everyone would do that! And then all the characters would be *gasp* the same! Suethors (of whatever gender) do the equivalent of using cheat codes to create a &quot;SIM&quot; for themselves that really shouldn&#39;t be possible. And when they put these characters in with other SIMs whose creators have actually <i>followed the rules</i> of points distribution...well, no wonder other SIMs get outshone, and no wonder everyone hates the cheatcode!SIMs.<br><br>As for Suethors and the use of female pronouns...I would be worried if we changed the pronouns to female for Suethors, and kept the pronouns gender-neutral when talking about goodfic writers. If that&#39;s the case, that has to change. BUT, if we talk about both Suethors and canon purists using female pronouns, well, isn&#39;t that a good thing? I mean, if this were anywhere else we&#39;d be complaining about the ubiquitous use of male pronouns in the English language. I say use &#39;em! Just use them for goodfic and badfic authors alike--and if that bothers people, just remind them that this is the Internet, where authors might very well be lying about their gender <i>anyway</i>. <br><br>As for this: &quot;And when I see novels like this praised and exalted, while I know-- know that a female protagonist doing half of that would be laughed out of the genre, it stings. And it makes me wonder.&quot;<br><br>So, a lot of people praise flat, unrealistic male characters and criticize flat, unrealistic female characters. Yes, that is indeed wrong and unfair. But why would the <i>solution</i> be to praise (or fail to criticize) flat, unrealistic female characters? You&#39;ll just wind up with a double-dose of bad literature! Wouldn&#39;t the solution be, rather than letting up on Mary Sue criticism, to <i>toughen up</i> on the criticism of the every-present Marty-Stu?<br><br>More Stu-mocking for everyone! That can only be a good thing. :P<br><br>Finally, to this: <i>And people who characterize those non-mainstream characters as Mary Sues don&#39;t read, don&#39;t know their literary history, don&#39;t know their social history, and don&#39;t know their feminist history. Until they know any of these, and perhaps political history as well, there&#39;s no point in talking to them, because they don&#39;t even speak the same dialect as a person with a modicum of education in the real world.</i><br><br>I&#39;d really have to read more of this to form a sound response to it, because as far as I can tell, we <i>don&#39;t</i> characterize &quot;those non-mainstream characters&quot; as Mary Sues. Being non-mainstream is not a requirement for being Mary Sue. If anything, in fanfiction Mary Sue <i>is</i> mainstream. <br><br>And for the record? Tamora Pierce is herself a Suethor. But not because of her warrior women, oh no. Because of *snicker* <i>Veralidaine Sarrasri</i>, and let us count the ways. <br><br>-Beautiful, such that all the boys are queuing up to be with her<br><br>-Angsty tragic past due to being illegitimate<br><br>-Demigod<br><br>-Speshul nickname that no one else has - &quot;The Wildmage&quot;. (Note that this isn&#39;t the same as the nicknames that the Shang warriors, both male and female, get, because those names are part of the Shang culture, and Daine&#39;s nickname is the only one of its kind in existence)<br><br>-Has more wild magic in her than anyone in the history of ever<br><br>-Had not one, but SEVERAL cute animal friends, and at the end of one book actually controls the actions of all the animals in the land<br><br>-Is able to shoot a bow and hit three moving targets in the dark--which even Alanna, who is much older and more experienced with a bow than Daine, can&#39;t equal. She is, at most, <i>fifteen years old</i> at the time.<br><br>-Is beloved and adored by ALL the protagonists (at the end of the first book, everyone and their pet bunny wants to take her in)<br><br>-Impresses everyone she comes across, especially with her l33t archery skillz - keep in mind that she is <i>fifteen years old!</i><br><br>-Is only held in contempt by people who judge her by her illegitimacy, who are all naturally mean and nasty people<br><br>-Is beloved and adored by the VILLAIN (no, really), until like the last twenty pages of the last book, in which he becomes one of the mean, nasty people who judge her by her illegitimacy! (Gee, the author wouldn&#39;t happen to have an axe to grind about that particular topic, now would she?)<br><br>-Makes a man who has been sleeping around since she was four years old want to settle down and marry her<br><br>...and I&#39;m probably forgetting some. Again, proportion. You could get away with one of those character traits, maybe two, but twelve? The author is trying waaaay too hard to make her character likable.<br><br>My point being, although Tamora Pierce has created some of my favorite childhood characters (Keladry and Buri being my favorites), I wouldn&#39;t hold her up as an expert on Mary Sueism. (Consider Liam &quot;The Shang Dragon&quot; and his mood-ring eye colors. I haven&#39;t read &quot;Lioness Rampant&quot; in a decade and I&#39;m still giggling over them.)</p>

            <p>We shall have to disagree on whether Daine&#39;s series is a good story; I personally found it and her to be very bland even as a child, nowhere near <u>The Lioness Quartet</u>. But let us take Drizzt Do&#39;Urden.<br><br>I shall give you a quote from my first PPC mission:<br><br><i>&quot;And there are a handful of good Mary Sues out there. When I was younger, my hero was Drizzt Do&#39;Urden. He&#39;s good looking, has violet eyes and white hair, is different from the other drow, doesn&#39;t age like humans do, is the best of the best with weapons, has a tragic past, is noble, wise, compassionate, yadda yadda yadda. He&#39;s a regular Marty Stu. But he&#39;s a plausible and well-written one. It&#39;s when Sueish or Stuish characteristics neuter good writing that it gets messy.&quot;</i><br><br>Now, I shall give you a quote from Mythtaken, in response to my saying:<br><br>&quot;Ultimately, Mary Sue is bowling-with-bumpers safe as a way to experience a story. She is unrealistically beautiful, inhumanly powerful, and always gets rewarded for everything she does with only the barest of struggles. She can’t fail. She can’t get humiliated. The story itself will dutifully remove all real obstacles from her shining path. And a character who needs her author to do all that work for her is not a character who has any sort of power. On the contrary, that character is weak.&quot;<br><br><i>This is such a wonderfully succinct definition of Mary Sue and why she&#39;s an example of bad writing! I keep seeing people say stuff like there&#39;s nothing wrong with her if she&#39;s well written, and being totally perplexed, because as far as I&#39;m concerned she </i>can&#39;t<i> be well written. That&#39;s the whole point.</i><br><br>At this point in time, my opinion is somewhere in the middle of the two of these. Can a Sue be well-written? In rare instances, yes. Can a Sue be well-written <i>because s/he is a Sue</i>? Absolutely not. The thing I remember most about Drizzt is not how he had &quot;Twinkle&quot; and &quot;Icingdeath&quot; as his speshul swords, but how he hesitantly forged his first human connection with Catti-Brie. And to borrow from Phobos again, if I feel fondness for Rapunzel from <i>Tangled</i>, it is <i>in spite</i> of the fact that rough-and-tough barbarians are all nice to her and she splashes through a puddle without getting dirty.<br><br>But then I compare Rapunzel to a character like Mulan, who was clumsy and awkward and didn&#39;t fit in, and worked harder than anyone else to become a warrior, and suffered through several humiliating moments before she found her stride, and got <i>badly</i> hurt saving the day, and who found her self-realization not in seeing something shiny, but in helping other people, and I think...<i>oh. Oh, </i>this<i> is how it&#39;s supposed to be. This is a character I can really love.</i> <br><br>The message that Rapunzel learned was: &quot;The world isn&#39;t such a big, scary place, after all, and you are more than equipped to handle it.&quot; But it could have been: &quot;The world <i>is</i> such a big, scary place, but it&#39;s <i>totally worth it</i> even if you get hurt.&quot; It could have been: &quot;There is no WAY you are equipped to handle the whole wide world on your first sojourn outside...no one is...but you can <i>learn.</i>&quot; Wouldn&#39;t those messages have been so much better than what we got? And wouldn&#39;t they ring so much truer to the audience&#39;s (even kids&#39;) life experiences?<br><br>Mary Sueism is a mark of poor writing. Some characters are just strong enough to be liked anyway. And in the long run, their being Sues doesn&#39;t really do them any favors, because the fact that they are so speshul calls all of their achievements into question. Rapunzel might be fun to pal around with, but if she didn&#39;t have her Aura of Smooth, would she really have been able to go through with everything her adventure asked of her? I guess we&#39;ll never know.<br><br>~Araeph</p>

            <p>I&#39;m totally with Araeph (and Neshomeh down below) here - real feminism doesn&#39;t have anything to do with removing every term that /might/ be politically incorrect, it&#39;s about equality.<br>In the context of the PPC, this means equal mockery of both Mary Sues and Gary Stus, so why tiptoe around the females and further ignore the males?<br><br>As a woman, I personally feel more offended by the /existence/ of Mary Sues in general than what they&#39;re called. We could call them, I dunno, &quot;Sparklesmores&quot; and still offend people because we won&#39;t treat those characters any differently from before. They&#39;re characters that are based on warped female ideals, so the name is the least of our troubles.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think we should change our lexicon just for the sake of appearing politically correct.  &quot;Mary Sue&quot; has been part of fandom terminology since the seventies.  It is a word, and we, as thinking humans, have power over words; it is not the other way around.  Other groups may be using the term incorrectly, but I think it&#39;s safe to say we are not.  Also, since we typically (hopefully, preferably) have very little interaction with other internet groups, we don&#39;t need to worry about how the PPC is viewed.<br><br>As I side note, I personally dislike the Gary Stu/Marty Sam whatever distinction.  To me, any character with Sueish qualities is a Mary Sue, in the same sense that any animal with feathers is a bird (or archeopteryx).  I don&#39;t see the need to use a different term for a male Sue because the gender of a Sue is irrelevant.  A Sue is not a Sue because she or he is a she or a he; a Sue is a Sue because of their role in the story and their interactions with other characters.  Gender is a secondary detail, eclipsed by all the rest.<br><br>So, personally?  Even if we reach a consensus for a new, gender-neutral term for Sues, I will continue to call the lot—female and male—Mary Sues.  Because that is what they are to me.<br><br>Oh, wait!  I just thought of one: Plot Vacuums.  Eh?  Eh?</p>

            <p>I am a big fan of the Duck Analogy, as you may all remember from previous discussions.  If it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck, and acts like a duck...well...it is probably a duck.  Or Sue, in this case.<br><br>To go further, I will say that not all Sues are bad.  You can have a well written Sue.  Take Rapunzel from the movie Tangled.  While watching that movie with Nesh, I remarked that any litmus strips in the area would be bursting into flames.  She ticked just about every box for Sue traits.  Unique magical powers, cute animal friend, everyone instantly likes her for no discernible reason, her hair was a Deus ex Machina, etc.  However, she was fun to watch, and you could feel for her.  She was definitely a Sue, but she was a well written one.<br><br>The problem with a Sue comes from the fact that it is a difficult character type to write well.  It takes a lot of skill and effort.  It is very easy to write a bad Sue.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think that ticking off the boxes in a litmus test, makes the character a Sue. Ticking off all those boxes, are generally <i>symptomatic</i> of having written a Sue. I am agreed that hitting all those boxes does make for a very difficult character to write well, so most of the ones that hit those boxes are awful Sues, but I do not agree that a well-written character that hits those boxes <i>is</i> a Sue. <br><br>If the character disrupts the story--If the character destroys all possible enjoyment and breaks even the most willing suspension of disbelief then that character is not well-written. Whether the character is teh awesum! and hits every mark on the litmus test, or the character is the clumsiest loser on the face of the planet (or wherever the story is set), that character is a Sue. Going by that there can be origin!canon Sues (a concept I fought against believing in for a long time), there can be fanfiction Sues, and there can be Sues tacked onto existing shows as newcomer!canon Sues.<br><br>Anyway, I guess I am basically agreeing with DML&#39;s definition, just in less precise language.</p>

Isn&#39;t that what a good character is: a character that adds something to the story?<br><br>Also, I don&#39;t believe that you can divorce a character from the story.

            <p>A Sue character is one that warps the story around them. This is always a little bad.

The Sues the PPC kills are dangerous because they do this while stealing the story from other people.<br><br>Sure a story&#39;s quality and a character&#39;s quality can be divorced from one another.

A marginal Sue with bad writing has nothing to disguise that everything about her is deus ex machina. A terrible Sue with any writing always makes us gag, though...</p>

            <p>Alright, I&#39;m going to go off on a really weird analogy here.<br>So, you may be familiar with Gary&#39;s Mod, a simulator where you are basically God. You create and destroy things instantly at will, can&#39;t be hurt, can&#39;t be killed, and can do absolutely anything with the world around you. But, after awhile,it gets very boring. You never feel like you&#39;re accomplishing anything because there&#39;s no effort in it. This is what I think defines a mary sue. You just get the feeling that if the character wasn&#39;t there no one would be doing anything. The whole world gives itself to him/her, so it never feels like they have accomplished anything.<br><br>Well developed original characters, on the other hand, are more like Minecraft. It&#39;s still a creativity tool, yeah, but you have to work hard for every accomplishment and improve yourself in order to achieve your goals. It feels like the world stretches out forever and that there could be things going on that have nothing to do with you. This is how regular characters work, interacting with a world instead of controlling it, and showing development and growth as the story progresses.<br><br>That is mainly how I judge original characters. Are the playing Minecraft or Gary&#39;s Mod?<br><br>Alright, end of horrible analogy now.</p>

            <p>I understand that this is off the central point of the discussion, but I&#39;d like to explain a bit about Garry&#39;s Mod. Yes, you have all the materials at your disposal. You can switch on God Mode and shoot down NPCs all day long. But the point of GMod isn&#39;t the tools or the resources, it&#39;s what you make with them.<br><br>I&#39;ll admit, I was never a Lego fan but I don&#39;t see the appeal of Minecraft. To me, it&#39;s blocky and there&#39;s not much I can do with it. The resource gathering is a grind(in the case of common materials like stone) or a blind hunt(if you&#39;re looking for things like diamonds). You can&#39;t build <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP-NMpKh2Rw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=198s">this</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEZZasxM_qc&amp;feature=related">this</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGKlcI73RSo&amp;feature=related">this</a> or make <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yn3HHw6HQc">this(NSFW)</a> in Minecraft. Take that turret, for example. One of the best things about GMod is that you aren&#39;t given perfect tools. You can download standard shapes and tools that allow for perfect connections if you want to, but it&#39;s never required. The creator had a locker, some wheels, a tire, a dumpster, and some dock poles and thought &quot;what can I do with this?&quot; In Minecraft, everything&#39;s a square. It fits perfectly in a square block with all the other squares.<br><br><b>---GMod white knighting over, actual related discussion imminent---</b><br>So I guess, if I were to compare it to the central point, I&#39;d say a &quot;Garry&#39;s Mod character&quot; has, or can acquire, all the tools they need to accomplish what they want to do. The tools might not be perfectly suited to the task at hand, but it&#39;s how they use those tools along the way, what they accomplish with them and how they combine the irregular shapes they&#39;re given to make something great that makes the story. Like you said, a &quot;Minecraft character&quot; works for everything they get, and they&#39;re rewarded with exactly what they wanted.<br><br>I guess if you imagine yourself something of a MacGyver you might find Garry&#39;s Mod more appealing. I don&#39;t, but I still got more out of Gmod than I got out of Minecraft.<br><br> I dunno. I guess it&#39;s all up to your individual writing style and what you like to see in a character.</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t played Gary&#39;s Mod myself, though I have seen my friends. I AM an avid MineCraft lover, and can agree that the fun comes from collecting the materials. <br><br>I like this analogy. Having a person with powers who bulldozes through the world would get boring, usually. To make an example that DML gave to me, and I used, he was helping me with ideas, and he suggested not using a portal in the HP mission I last posted, and doing a travelogue thing to the destination. Well, lo and behold, I did, and I had a LOT more fun with it. <br><br>While I will not be dropping portals completely, doing things the hard way, or at least not the easy way has a definite satisfaction to it. <br><br></p>

            <p>What can I add to this discussion?<br><br>Well, I noticed that Maximum Ride is on the list of Canonical Sues. I disagree with that. She puts on that act because she needs to be tough and play the part of a leader. But her internal monologues show that she&#39;s just a teenager who has had a terrible life for as far back as she can remember, and it really SHOWS. Her she reacts believably, putting her family first even though she really disagrees with them sometimes. Yes, she&#39;s bad ass and she has had two good looking guys vying for her at the same time. One of those guys was BRED to want to have her children. It&#39;s stated in book, that this guy was made to be her &quot;perfect other half&quot;. As for being speshul, she acts like its a blessing and a curse. She&#39;s part bird(she has wings) but is sensitive about showing them due to being in hiding.<br>Now then, lets talk about her &quot;perfect other half&quot;. This guy is described as being &quot;super model gorgeous&quot;(or something to that effect) and everyone swoons when they see him. He can see the future, everyone but Max and the other guy who wants her take right to him, he can heal his own wounds, and what pisses me off the most is that he KNOWS that he was made to want Max&#39;s babies, but isn&#39;t shown to be all that distressed about it.<br><br>If I was put into that situation(which I am in my own way due to my OCD and the compulsions I have where I KNOW that it&#39;s not necessary to repeat my actions over and over and over again, but if FEELS like I should and then I get all distressed about feeling helpless over the whole thing, please pardon the run on) I would be pretty upset about it. <br><br>Yet this guy isn&#39;t. His entire existence is based around having Max&#39;s children, he knows that, and yet the most we see him angst over it is the occasional frustration.<br>Now you could argue that he was brain washed into it not bothering, but here&#39;s the thing: If this were true, why hasn&#39;t the flock tried to help him out? Point out when he&#39;s being all horny towards Max, have Max reject him as part of helping him, heck she doesn&#39;t even do THAT to his face! Max just sort of goes along with it, is confused about her feeling for a bit, then her boyfriend oh so conveniently leaves the flock because &quot;thats whats best&quot;. The next book she and her &quot;perfect other half&quot; are having sex. At the Eifle tower. &quot;Silhouetted against the night sky&quot;.<br><br>Who the hell is the Stu here?!<br><br>To sum up, Max is a believable character. This other guy is a Stu.<br></p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know the continuum you&#39;re talking about, but I do have two cents here, which may or may not apply to that particular character...<br><br>You get characters that are really, really obvious Sues and Stus. A toddler could point them out. And then you get characters that are less obvious, and less annoying.<br><br>Non-annoying Canon Stu example: Drizzt Do&#39;Urden. He&#39;s got all the sparkliness and angst going on; but he&#39;s not nearly as annoying as he could be, because he&#39;s well-integrated into the story. The story usually exists somewhat to serve him; but he gives back to the story, too; most Stus don&#39;t. Despite the obvious Stu traits, his glitter level stays pretty low, and the stories stay readable. A writer with less skill would have made him insufferable, but as it is, the other characters are just as interesting as Drizzt and the biggest annoyance has actually been due to copycats who have turned the entire drow species into a bunch of self-hating angsty atoner types rather than the downright scary, cold-hearted, back-stabbing subterranean elves they should&#39;ve been.<br><br>The more skill you have as a writer, the more Stu/Sue traits you can get away with without annoying your readers. It&#39;s really a spectrum.<br><br>This is why we can recruit ex-Sues to the PPC, right? Because the ones that aren&#39;t as annoying as the average, the ones who have some kind of a personality and don&#39;t twist the canon as badly as usual, have some hope of becoming full-fledged characters that are contributing to the story rather than just leeching off it. It&#39;s good to recognize that.</p>

            <p>If the character is the uncanonical child of someone, and it&#39;s kind of obvious from the story that the author made that connection just to make their character special (daughters of Aslan or Sauron come to mind), then I&#39;m far more likely to call them Sue than if the author has better reasons.<br><br>If a character has special powers and there&#39;s really no good reason for him/her to have them, and everybody respects them for it, then I&#39;m more likely to see the character as Sue. E.g. a LotR character doesn&#39;t need powerful elemental magic. Double points if the powers are mentioned and then either only used once or never really used. Pointless powers are one thing that cause suspicion for me. A Narnia Sue I came across was given a pair of golden wings that she can bring out or put away when she wants, and the title of the first book in the trilogy is &quot;Her Golden Wings,&quot; but I don&#39;t remember her EVER using them as anything but battle decoration. Don&#39;t give a character something they&#39;re not going to use.<br><br>For me, Sues have little character depth and (talking mostly from Narnia experience here): often have unduly tragic pasts, almost instantly fall in love with their authors&#39; lust object, often have poorly-written prophecies about them, might have ridiculous or uncanonical powers, throw people OOC, might cause unacceptable canon breaks, don&#39;t act like real people, are often written in first person, often defeat trained canon characters in a duel (often with martial arts), have undue attention paid to them, change the way the world works...<br><br>Let me explain better. No, there is too much. Let me sum up:<br><br>I see Sues as unrealistic characters, often without much character depth and no logical reasons for anything, who warp canon (and its rules) to revolve around themselves.<br><br>I personally think that if an author offers a reasonable explanation for a Sue trait, it becomes non-Sue. There&#39;s also the fact that a few Sue traits do not a Sue make:<br><br><i>Once again we&#39;re falling into the exceedingly wanky trap of &quot;any female character who&#39;s the center of a story and has good qualities MUST BE A SUE.&quot; We need to set our radar a little higher (lower?). Otherwise every heroine ever invented can be called a Sue, and that&#39;s ridiculous.<br>To whit:<br>Beautiful = not a Sue.<br>Loved = not a Sue.<br>Brilliant = not a Sue.<br>Powerful = not a Sue.<br>Plot-central = not a Sue.<br>Related to another character = not a Sue.<br>Love interest = not a Sue.<br>Needs to be rescued = not a Sue.<br>Kicks ass = not a Sue.<br>Whines = not a Sue.<br>HOWEVER. Combine three or more of the above, throw in &quot;makes other characters act like idiots&quot; and &quot;warps logic and/or plotline to suit HER,&quot; and...you might have a Sue!<br>PS: Flavor to taste with optional ingredients such as &quot;author apparently types with elbows&quot; or &quot;creator cries when criticized.&quot;</i><br>(<em>redpanda</em> on LJ)<br><br>I find that does a good job summing up as well.<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve known real people with four or five of those traits-- who could,  yes, turn fairly reasonable folk around them temporarily into idiots (ah, hormones). <s>And yes, I also have something of an issue with the specifically noted &#39;female character,&#39; rather than any character. I find glittery male OCs just as annoying. To whit, The Chosen One or whatever it is, Caddy probably remembers.</s> The fact of the matter is, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any magic formula that we can apply to every character and go &quot;Aha! This is a Sue/Stu!&quot; At all. As a wise fraa once said, it&#39;s  a useful theorical device, but all kinds of real things fail it, including you and I.<br><br>It just seems like an oversimplification-- that&#39;s why I have such a huge problem with most litmus tests. I&#39;m not interested in any single trait, I&#39;m interested in whether the character <i>works</i>. Last night in the IRC I used the Steelsings method for reference-- we&#39;d link to litmus tests, but it was a team of mentors that determined the character and approved applications. Someone would come in with a pickpocket who had the Gift (in, say, dark reddish-orange), but could do no more than light small fires. The mentors would point out it wasn&#39;t necessary, given his profile, and ask for reasoning/elaboration. If the applicant said something like &quot;Well, when he was a kid his best friend was afraid of the dark, and he used to hold fire to help her out-- now he makes a practice of keeping the areas around him lit, in her memory,&quot; it made sense, fit, and generally was given a pass. If the applicant sort of trailed off and couldn&#39;t find a reason, the reason generally had to do with &quot;I thought it sounded cool.&quot; Which is what makes a Sue/Stu. Not the coolness of the ability-- someone mentioned Harry Dresden, further down-- but how it actually effects the <i>character</i>, and the story around them.</p>

            <p>It was a roleplay, chat-based (but with attached forums), and set in Tamora Pierce&#39;s Tortall books, shortly before the Trickster books, or around the same time. The mentors were older members who judged applicants to the RP-- basically, they looked over a profile, asked questions, and either gave the person a link to the chat, or told them to try again. It was a good RP, mainly because so much attention was paid to the quality of application characters. Spelling and grammar were heavily stressed; it was there that I learned that no, it is never cool to suppress a natural understanding of English 2 talk lyk this. <br><br>About two years ago, though, the site folded in on itself-- membership had been dwindling, people had been paying no attention, and there was no traffic, so the admin eventually closed the whole thing down.</p>

            <p>There would be more male OCs. (I was presented with one a few weeks ago, but he&#39;s in the Bones fandom, and I don&#39;t know that.)<br><br>I think Calista made most of the first point I wanted to make: I feel that we as &quot;Suehunters&quot; (or people who stick the label Mary Sue on some female OCs) are accused of sexism to make us shut up. The real problem we have with characters are not addressed. Instead we are pushed in the corner of people with whom it&#39;s not possible to have a normal conversation, because we are &quot;sexist&quot; and can&#39;t therefore have any valuable opinions.<br><br>Do I hold female OCs to a higher standard than male OCs? i.e. do I let male OCs get away with things that I won&#39;t let a female OC get away with?<br><br>Hard to say, I haven&#39;t actually seen that many male OCs. Off the top of my head: all the male OCs I&#39;ve come across in <i>A-Team</i> and <i>Voyagers!</i> fandom are Stus. That&#39;s 100 percent. I have not seen a 100 percent rate of Suish female characters.<br><br>There are probably about 20 or 30 times as many female Sues as male Sues. I&#39;d like to think that I won&#39;t let the males get away with things I won&#39;t let the females get away with. <br><br>Description of an OC in an upcoming mission:<br>US Marshall arranges friend A will watch their niece for a while while they are away on a job. US Marshall doesn&#39;t make arrangements with set friend about when and where to drop off the kid, and manages to misplace the kid in a building they have never been in. The Marshall seems to be dumb as soup. Later, when the US Marshall learns the kid has met some old friends from her father, the Marshall drops everything to confront friend A in the workplace. In the process of which they threaten that friend in words, with a knife and with a gun. Friend A is a federal agent.<br><br>Does it really matter whether that Marshall is male or female? They are over the top and unfit for their job. And the story treats their behaviour as right and hilarious.<br><br>It&#39;s a Sue/Stu, because in this fandom US Marshall&#39;s take their job seriously and so do other federal agents. The US Marshall would have been arrested for their threats; not giving a sparing session in the gym with friend A.<br><br>Yesterday someone suggested to me I should write my own badfic (?) and I think I might just try substituting any of my recents female Sues with a male Sue. Although I would much rather write good fic with a female OC that is not an OC.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of male OCs in action-oriented video game fandoms (Halo, Gears of War, Left 4 Dead.) They are typically a bunch of ultra-tough kickass dudes, laying waste to their enemies without breaking a sweat. It&#39;s much closer to a 50-50 male-female representation in RPG-type games, like Mass Effect or Fallout.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve seen some, but they&#39;re mostly sidekicks, brothers and teachers of the fic&#39;s main character, and treated as abusive arseholes, punchbags or comic relief. I&#39;ve seen some characters I&#39;d classify as male Sues (distinct from Stus - I personally classify a very distinct archetype as a Stu), but they&#39;re usually in bad slash. On the whole, though, I totally agree that female OCs, especially objectionable ones, are far more common, which makes comparison difficult...</p>

            <p>I&#39;m afraid I haven&#39;t had time to read the whole discussion so far, but I think we agree about what makes a Sue or Stu. It&#39;s not what they are or what they do, but whether the people around them react in ways that make canonical sense. Coincidentally, I just re-read &quot;Suedom,&quot; too. ^_^<br><br>Regarding Tamora Pierce, let me point out that just as we don&#39;t believe being a bad writer makes you a bad person, so being a good writer does not make you a nice person. I take serious issue with being considered not worth talking to because I choose to use a certain term, and I did go to college and graduate with a BA in English--the studies in which which included literary history, feminist literary criticism, and many other things. Please to not blindly place me in a category without ever speaking to me, thank you very much.<br><br>I stand by what I&#39;ve been saying for a while: changing what you call a thing doesn&#39;t change how people feel about it.

            <p>One more thing... wish I could edit posts, but here we go.<br><br>I see this problem lots in all kinds of minority groups: Rather than declaring equality, once they realize they&#39;re not inferior, they tend to go overboard and declare superiority--usually embarrassing the mainstream parts of the movement. There are women who call themselves feminists and claim that women are superior to men. There are groups who say blacks are better than whites. I&#39;ve even met other autistic people who are autistic supremacists, claiming that autistic people are the &quot;next step in human evolution&quot; (biology fail, anyone?).<br><br>The feminist Mary Sue is a reflection of that. Rather than claim equality, she claims superiority. She makes herself better than everybody else--nothing truly challenges her. If the story goes against her, she changes the story. Rather than being a realistic person who is on a level playing field with everybody else, she puts herself at the top of the hierarchy and turns everybody else into playthings.<br><br>Real-life minority groups are dealing with this sort of inverted prejudice. It can be difficult because when you tell people, &quot;No, actually, women are just as good as men; not better,&quot; you can get accused of supporting male superiority. I&#39;ve been accused of being a &quot;traitor&quot; to autistic people because I agree that autism is a disability. It&#39;s like they can&#39;t get it through their heads that a person can be an equal to another person; and so they&#39;ve got to create these unrealistic ideas that puts them at the top, undisputably. And then they fly off the handle when you correct them.<br><br>The Mary Sue is this problem personified--the person who decides that rather than creating a character who fits into the canon as an equal, they will create a character who will make canon their toy and be superior to everyone there, whether by overpowering them, seducing them, or just turning the canon into their personal playground.</p>

            <p>I know people say Mary Sue when an OC is powerful; but that&#39;s not the big thing, at least not to me. The question is: Is the character realistic?<br><br>The power differential is also significant. If you have a very powerful character, who has very powerful opponents, then there&#39;s not a big power differential and there&#39;s no problem. For example: Harry Dresden. He&#39;s very powerful; but his enemies are just as powerful and often more so. Despite his high power level, he&#39;s not a Stu. (He&#39;s also got flaws which come back to bite him on the butt with regularity.)<br><br>Whereas, if you had someone with Harry Dresden&#39;s power level fighting opponents whom he could easily wipe the floor with, that would be a Stu, because the character would be a big old power fantasy.<br><br>The same applies for females. Check out Mariel, from the Redwall series. She&#39;s a good fighter and she can take on multiple opponents at once. She&#39;s tough, strong, and quick-thinking. But her opponents match her power level; they&#39;re a real threat to her, and she&#39;s not just standing there being awesome and grinding everyone into the dirt. Therefore, she&#39;s not a Sue.</p>

            <p>WARNING - the following contains lots and lots of opinion.<br><br>Mary Sue, Marty Stu - the name is irrelevant. It would be nice to have some alternative gender-neutral phrase that snaps off the tongue, but we have to make do with the language we&#39;ve been given. Unfortunately, said language opens us up to accusations of sexism and the like. Yes, it&#39;s true that male characters in both fanfiction and original fiction are given more leeway when it comes to being shallow self-inserts. Yes, female characters are more frequently bashed. Yes, it&#39;s a crying shame. But until we all become professional book critics (and how the world will shudder on that day, oh yes!), there is little we can personally do besides shout in the wilderness of the internet.<br><br>But anyway, what makes a Sue/Stu a Sue/Stu? Whenever I peruse a potential Suefic/Stufic, I have a mental checklist - a basic litmus test, if you will. If the story hits most or all of the points, then it&#39;s mission material.<br><br><b>Does the character have depth? If so, is that depth believable?</b><br>Flat, one-dimensional characters are not good for propelling a story. Neither are characters with personalities or backgrounds that make no sense. Here&#39;s an example from a DMS mission I&#39;m working on wrapping up: the main character (a young woman) owns twelve nightclubs AND was a former top SAS sniper. While you&#39;re all counting the contradictions in that very short sentence, I&#39;ll be on the next point.<br><br><b>Is the character likable?</b><br>Note: I don&#39;t mean &#39;likable&#39; as in &#39;morally good.&#39; A well-crafted villain protagonist can be just as interesting a character as the Boy-Scoutiest of heroes. Let me be more blunt: is the character a douche and, if so, does her/his behavior go on uncalled? The tenth Fellowship member verbally castrates Boromir and Sam every chance she/he gets while everyone else watches and laughs. The fifth Survivor opens fire on a crowd of uninfected people without provocation and everyone else pays it no mind. That sort of thing.<br><br><b>Is the character substituting herself/himself for a canonical character?</b><br>What&#39;s that? Sam&#39;s dead? Don&#39;t worry Frodo, I, [insert name here], will help you take the Ring to Mount Doom! Along the way, we can explore how deeply in wuv with each other we are.<br><br><b>Is the character violating the rules of the canon without a proper and believable explanation?</b><br>&#39;Proper and believable&#39; are key words here. Anyone can make excuses for why their extra Organization XIII member can feel genuine emotions, or why their intelligent Special Infected OC has fully-functioning wings. If said excuses don&#39;t fit the rules of the world, then something is wrong.<br><br>Anyway, that&#39;s what I feel about this issue. I hope that all made sense and wasn&#39;t just me babbling.</p>

            <p>English is the only language I know well enough to comfortably use (I know bits and pieces of some other languages, but not <i>nearly</i> enough to have an actual conversation with anyone), but I&#39;ve heard that English is a very gender-<b>un</b>biased language compared to most of the other major world languages (e.g. French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Polish, etc... I&#39;d include Russian, but I&#39;m not sure how gender-biased that language actually is.)

            <p>You seem to be talking about grammatical gender, which doesn&#39;t have anything to do with gender bias. Grammatical gender is basically just another way that words have to agree, like with number agreement--it wouldn&#39;t be correct to say <i>la niсo</i> or <i>el niсa</i> in Spanish any more than it would be correct to say &quot;they was&quot; or &quot;it were&quot; in English. In languages with grammatical gender, there doesn&#39;t have to be any relation between the gender of a word and the gender of a subject. For instance, in Spanish, <i>persona</i> and <i>vнctima</i> are always feminine, even when they refer to a male. I understand there&#39;s a word for the male anatomy that is feminine, but I don&#39;t know it. (I&#39;m sure there are masculine words that can refer to female subjects, too, but I don&#39;t know them, either. I&#39;ve forgotten most of my Spanish classes, and I got the aforementioned examples from Wikipedia. &gt;.&gt; )<br><br>That isn&#39;t to say that Spanish-speaking countries or other countries with grammatically-gendered languages <i>don&#39;t</i> have gender bias problems, though. Pretty much the whole world has gender bias problems.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

Perhaps we could all pitch in ideas regarding what new all-encompassing name we should call Sues and Stus, followed by a collective vote for the favorite. If the phrase catches on, we keep it. If not, we stick with the old familiar terms until a proper substitute can be found.</p>

            <p>I like this idea. And even if we end up having multiple names for something, how is that really different from the various names we have for spirit possessions? We&#39;ve already got Sue/Stu-Wraith, Author-Wraith, Author-Phantom, and slash dwimmerlaiks. We&#39;ve had people randomly using Marty/Gary Stu and Marty Sam for the male characters. <br><br>I know it would have to be pretty catchy and easy to remember for me to be able to really replace Mary Sue, but I bet with this group of creative people someone can do it.</p>

            <p>Not until we start sporking as many male OCs as female, anyway, and that&#39;s not likely until we start running into them with the same frequency. At least in the fandoms I follow regularly, there are vastly more female OCs than male, and therefore more poorly written female OCs. Whatever term we use, it will be primarily associated with female OCs because that&#39;s primarily what we see, and we&#39;ll still be accused of being anti-feminists and Canon Nazis and everything else, regardless of what words we use, as long as the numbers remain the same.<br><br>Hmm, I sense an opportunity for another Board-wide challenge: go forth and get ye a Gary Stu, and spork ye him well, and tip the scales of thy  count!<br><br>~Neshomeh, currently at 6:3 Sues to Stus, thanks to three Sues in one mission and two Stus from fandoms I don&#39;t usually follow.</p>

We are here to protect canons and if the most threats against canons are female characters by female authors, then by golly, that is what we&#39;re going after.<br>Anyway, as it is very nicely pointed out on the wiki, writing overpowered, divinely beautiful, female characters who wrap everyone around their littlefingers, have very little to do with feminism, so calling us anti-feminist for slapping such characters down, is kind of silly.<br>[/steps off soap-box]</p>

            <p>I admit, I&#39;m fairly recent to the concept of &quot;Mary Sue/Marty Stu&quot; myself - so much so that when I first came across the term almost two years ago, in horror, I put my fanfic writing on hold to sort out a few imagined chinks in the armour, so to speak.<br><br>In any case, after reading a number of articles about this sub-class of characterisation (or lack thereof), this is my take on it - regardless of gender, a &quot;Daemon Interferus&quot; (my personal, fictional term to replace the Mary/Marty identifier) is, at the heart, an author&#39;s construct which is generally over-idealised, conforms to steryotyped behavior and/or disrupts any established canon merely on its whim for its whim.<br><br>One of the biggest issues with the &quot;Interferus&quot; is that the Sue/Stue label has been thrown about so much that its original meaning seems to have lost signifigance. Should it merely apply to over-idealised, canon-breaking female characters? Of course not! But all such characters, regardless of gender, should none the less be held accountable.<br><br>Forgive me for seeming to be the fool in this rant, but, IMO, Neshomeh says it best - they, no matter what they are, have an annoying tendancy to get their way with little to no justification.<br><br>+CRUSH THE STERYOTYPE.

            <p>This isn&#39;t really a response to anything you said, Church; you just jogged my memory. {= )<br><br>Someone asked why we can&#39;t use &quot;Mary Sue&quot; as a gender-neutral blanket term. The reason is that it&#39;s a girl&#39;s name, and we already have a bad habit of using feminine terms to insult men by feminizing them. For instance, calling them girly. It&#39;s terribly anti-girl, since it implies heavily that girls are somehow lesser than boys. We don&#39;t want to do that, so if there is going to be Mary Sue, there must also be Gary Stu (or Marty Sam, or whatever).<br><br>It also occurs to me that we have an opportunity to improve our usage on this front. I&#39;ve just looked over the Mary Sue page on the wiki, and it does tend to make reference to Gary Stu as &quot;the male version of a Sue.&quot; I suspect that we could clean up those references, there and elsewhere, and go with language more along the lines of &quot;the author&#39;s darling male OC,&quot; or some such. (As usual, I&#39;m all for taking this on if it&#39;s the will of the Board.)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Mary Sue was once just ONE example, a real parody Sue named &#39;Mary Sue.&#39; To me, calling something a Mary Sue is like calling a character &#39;a Judas&#39;: it&#39;s not necessarily talking about their gender or what they are (because those can vary) but what they DO in the story. And even if Sues may take different actions, they all do the same thing... mess up the canon.<br><br>So when talking about Sues in GENERAL, I will use the term. But when referring to a specific male Sue I find, I will use &#39;Gary Stu&#39; because male examples follow a slightly different common pattern, and shouldn&#39;t be feminized... not just because it&#39;s insulting, but also because it&#39;s just not as accurate to call them the archetype &#39;Mary Sue.&#39;<br><br>All squares are rectangles, yet I describe squares as squares because it&#39;s more precise.<br><br>All Stus are Sues, yet I describe Stus as Stus because it&#39;s more precise.<br><br>And on and on.</p>

            <p>I fear the original Mary Sue character is often forgotten--I just forgot about her in that post--but the part where it&#39;s an archetype is something we could use when giving our definition of Sue or Stu, too. That might be effective, and with less of a hassle.<br><br>One way or another, tweaking the Sue and Stu pages after this winds down probably wouldn&#39;t hurt. I&#39;m basically with EileenAlphabet: I&#39;m not out to please people who are already set to dislike us for reasons I believe to be silly, but the clearer we can be for our own sakes, the better. With each time this conversation about what makes a Sue comes up, I think we&#39;ve come closer and closer to a standard definition, and the pages can reflect that better.

            <p>I don&#39;t, either; I doubt any of us do. However, suppose the original archetype character had been Ralph. My question is, why should calling a negative archetype Ralph be less offensive than calling it Mary Sue? I get why it <i>is</i>--you mentioned male privilege--but why <i>should</i> it be? Is it fair and equal if we aren&#39;t allowed to give a negative thing a female name, ever, even when it&#39;s accurate? My argument is that some underlying assumptions are at fault here, not the terminology we use; operating under a different paradigm is what we really want, and the only way to get it is to start behaving as though it exists.<br><br>I realize I may be undercutting what I said about needing a Gary Stu to go with Mary Sue, but the truth is I&#39;m sort of on the fence about all this. I&#39;m debating with you all to convince myself as much as anything else. I want what&#39;s best for women and the PPC, and if I thought changing the words would help, I&#39;d be all for it, but I have yet to be convinced that it would be worth the effort. (I note here that no one has seized on either of the two gender-neutral suggestions proposed so far, or even commented about them.) People are still racist regardless of what &quot;politically correct&quot; words we use for black people, and yet, homosexual people proudly identify as gay and gain acceptance despite the idiots who fling the word around as an insult. At the moment my position is that I&#39;d rather the term &quot;Mary Sue&quot; be more like &quot;gay,&quot; and we should defend its correct definition rather than retreat from it. But, at the same time, if the evidence mounts up that changing it would make a difference to how people feel and act toward us (women and/or the PPC), then I&#39;m willing to change.<br><br>So, I&#39;m sorry to cut in again before you have the chance to write your essay, but my hope is that I&#39;ve made myself a little clearer.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I sort of wrote this post knowing that at some point I would have no idea how to articulate what I meant, and I seem to have hit that barrier here. I&#39;ll try-- bear with me.<br><br>I came to verbal blows with an ex-friend of my sister&#39;s, recently, over a handful of things. He once told her to, and I quote, &quot;Get back in the kitchen!&quot; And used to go on about girls, what they were good for, and so on. I was not sad when they had a falling out (his chauvinism pushed him to a point where none of his female friends were comfortable with him, and he eventually chose casual sex with almost-strangers over friendships), because going home had become either grinding my teeth silently over sexist remarks, or a continual hashing over Feminism 101. And both of those are <i>exhausting</i> things to do on a regular basis.<br><br>But here&#39;s why I bring it up-- every time I tried to explain to him why his &#39;jokes&#39; weren&#39;t funny, I got the &quot;But women are equal to men, so why does it matter? It&#39;s just a joke, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m <i>actually</i> going to slap her,&quot; or whatever flimsy response. Or &quot;But I&#39;m only joking. Am I not even allowed to do that anymore?&quot;<br><br>Jokes <i>matter</i>. Using a joke that reinforces harmful behavior is a problem. Using language and terms that reinforce harmful stereotypes is a problem. Intent is not magic. All those other things that are well on their way to becoming clichйs.<br><br>Basically, my point is this. I... okay, I can&#39;t say I don&#39;t care what the critics think of the PPC. The most iconic critic on this debate around here, Boosette, is someone I look up to and respect; we have a mutual friend who I love dearly. Who also truly despises the word &#39;Mary Sue,&#39; and with good reason. Both of them have good reason. Tamora Pierce has good reason. ...That wasn&#39;t the point. Let me try again.<br><br>Basically, my point is this. Critics aside, I&#39;m thinking about the fangirls, the Suethors, the fourteen-year-olds who haven&#39;t seen this discussion or the many essays on both sides of the argument that sprang up around the last debate, dubbed (to my eternal chagrin) &quot;The Boosette Incident.&quot; Imagine you&#39;ve posted strong (in the strictest sense of the word-- I mean, literally. Strong with power, strong with beauty, etc. Not &#39;strong&#39; in the literary sense.) female characters three times, and each time you&#39;ve gotten a flood of reviews going &quot;SUUUE ALERT OMG SOMEONE CALL THE PPC!&quot; And then you post a fanfic with a Dunedan (I know there&#39;s an accent somewhere there) who does much the same thing, and <i>no one says a thing</i>. What conclusions could you draw from this? Female powerful characters = Bad. Male powerful characters = Good.<br><br>Now, we know that&#39;s not the truth, or the whole story. But from an outside perspective? I&#39;m oversimplifying it, and not doing the argument justice at all. But do you get what I&#39;m saying?<br><br>It&#39;s also, for the record, a big part of why I push for strong concrit instead of just sporking. I&#39;ve never understood why mocking someone should take precedent over trying to help them improve. Yes, some authors don&#39;t know how to take criticism. But what about the ones who do? Why is our automatic reaction not to post a review going &quot;Your story, to be honest, needs a lot of work. Your character doesn&#39;t seem realistic, s/he is undermining canon...&quot; etc, but to come running back here and go &quot;OH MY GOD GUYS LOOK AT HOW HORRIBLE AND STUPID THIS IS&quot; every time?<br><br>I don&#39;t know. I think I&#39;ve officially lost my train of thought (four paragraphs ago, possibly?) and am rambling.<br><br>TL;DR:<br><br>If we are not careful with how we use the term &#39;Mary Sue,&#39; we are, if not intentionally, undermining female fantasy characters and reinforcing harmful gender roles. I know that we don&#39;t want to do that. I know there&#39;s no perfect solution. But I think we could stand to be a lot more careful with our words. We&#39;re writers; let&#39;s try to remember that, when... well, writing-- stories and reviews both.<br><br>--VM, who will now climb off her soapbox and go hide in a cave somewhere</p>

            <p>I did read this, and started a reply, but then realized I wasn&#39;t making sense and resolved to come back later.<br><br>Long story short, I do get where you&#39;re coming from, but I guess I see the whole thing differently. I suppose our respective views have a lot to do with our life experiences--I don&#39;t have a Scumbag Steve in mine, for instance; I can honestly say I&#39;ve never been aware of anyone judging me simply for being female, and if they did I think I would just write them off as an idiot and get on with achieving my goals, thanks. It&#39;s really hard to wrap my head around the idea that not everyone has the same resources I do.<br><br>So, bearing my own personal privilege in mind, I do agree that we need to be careful, but I&#39;m with Araeph--I&#39;m not willing to let anyone&#39;s opinion push me around just because other people aren&#39;t as careful as I am. I think the best course of action is to keep on more or less as we&#39;ve been going and not to let actual Mary Sues off the hook, but rather to crack down harder on Stus, and not make excuses for them. All those superheroes with their cliched angsty pasts and ridiculously unrealistic everything? Yeah, that noise, for starters. We&#39;re not sending our boys very good messages, either.<br><br>Incidentally, this thread did get me off the fence about reviewing one of a pair of fics I&#39;m aiming to spork (<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6693370/1/With_one_Step">this one</a>, if you&#39;re curious). It&#39;s not a terribly positive review, but given that my issue with the fic is that 90% is lifted straight from the books, there&#39;s very little I could offer in the way of writing pointers beyond &quot;I&#39;m here to read original writing, please do some.&quot; {= P I actually liked the OC in question from the other fic of the pair--my plan is to let her go free in some Generic Fantasyland in the end.<br><br>Anyway, if you want to keep talking about this stuff, please e-mail me.

            <p><i>To me, calling something a Mary Sue is like calling a character &#39;a Judas&#39;: it&#39;s not necessarily talking about their gender or what they are (because those can vary) but what they DO in the story.</i><br><br>Which means it should be a gender-neutral term-- Mary Sue is a girl&#39;s name. The association is with a feminine archetype. This is a problem. Because as long as we&#39;re using a girl&#39;s name-- which is associated with femininity and a feminine archetype-- we are basically leaving ourselves wide open for accusations of being anti-feminist. And what&#39;s more, in that context those who jump to that conclusion have reasonable cause to do so.<br><br>(<sub>As a general aside: for what it&#39;s worth, I think Tamora Pierce was more referring to people who slap the label on any strong female character.

            <p>(DISCLAIMER: THIS IS ONLY ONE PERSON&#39;S OPINION. IT MAY NOT BE UTTERLY CORRECT, BUT SHE&#39;S TRYING TO PUT IT OUT THERE IN ORDER TO FIND THE &#39;MOST CORRECT&#39; THING,SO SHE CAN THEN FOLLOW THAT.)<br><br>The PPC doesn&#39;t go after authors, but what makes a Sue a Sue is very much an author&#39;s fault... whether the author knows it or not, the hallmark of a Suefic is that it somehow achieves a secret goal, one that doesn&#39;t exist to fit into the canon at all... but one that takes over and tramples it into the ground.<br><br>For example. I know this was true for me when I wrote suefics... I was 13 years old, and I was lonely, and I had no friends, and I felt my parents thought I was a useless shlub who couldn&#39;t do anything. And so what did I write? A 18 year old, sexy, popular, sassy girl who canons were friends with (despite the story!), who had amazing abilities (that didn&#39;t fit into canon at all) and saved the day (undermining the efforts of the canon characters).<br><br>I didn&#39;t realize it at the time, but I exorcised all of my desperate wants and insecurities as a character that ruined a story for her own gain. That character wanted so much. She was like a demon, that just wanted everything to satisfy her, and when she sucked the canon dry of everything she wanted in life, she didn&#39;t even care about finishing the story. It scares me today that I wrote such a horrid, shallow character. I didn&#39;t even realize I was doing it at the time... but my ulterior motives were there.<br><br>I&#39;m not a stupid person for it. I just wasn&#39;t aware of what I was doing, and was possessed by the need to negatively channel my frustrations into writing (Write a story where NO ONE GIVES HER TROUBLE! NO ONE! NOT LIKE REAL LIFE!) rather than positively (Write a story where the hero overcomes problems and becomes a stronger person!). So that&#39;s why we don&#39;t get mad at Suethors... it&#39;s temporary.<br><br>But the Sue. How many times have you read a story and been like, &#39;Why does everything end up as a sex dream for this character? It&#39;s like a hand of God keeps handing her sex scenes for no reason,&#39; or &#39;Why is this story continually trying to convince me that this character is cool? Can&#39;t he speak for himself?&#39; Yeah, those are Sue/Stu stories. They break your suspension of disbelief because the person making them ignores the storytelling in favor of their own emotional wants. Even ones they aren&#39;t aware they have, sometimes...<br><br>(And it IS perfectly possible to want something but not be aware of it. Look at so many people who are overweight who would outwardly claim that they are fine with how they look, or fine with exercising to stay in shape, but also feel unwelcome in society... wishing they were accepted. I know when I was younger and felt that way, I suddenly had a lot of effortlessly &#39;skinny&#39; characters... and I didn&#39;t realize why...)<br><br>As for Tamora Pierce, I suspect she&#39;s been very jaded by people defining Sues simply as &#39;female character with special traits.&#39; I would be too, if a thousand people without organization insulted me and said my characters were shallow every day. But I don&#39;t think say... Alanna was a Mary Sue. She was confronted by very big problems and mostly overcame them on her own merits, no matter what special traits she had. One scene comes back to me vividly: when she discovers her training lance has been weighted to make her fail. And yet, she doesn&#39;t solve it by being special. She solves it by practicing and practicing and practicing until she <i>succeeds with the rigged heavy lance</i> and it makes her a stronger person.<br><br>She doesn&#39;t do anything she does because OUTSIDE THE STORY the person writing her &#39;secretly wants attention&#39; or because &#39;she has insecurity issues&#39; and is living vicariously through her. Her motivations exist within the story, INSIDE the story, and if she&#39;s insecure at times, it&#39;s because SHE IS. Not because being insecure gets her something.<br><br>It makes me mad, too, that so many people (mostly not PPC people) have this definition of Sue that means &#39;female character with special traits within the setting&#39; because that means that if nearly every classical hero was female, they&#39;d be a Sue. This isn&#39;t true.<br><br>No matter how much &#39;stuff&#39; a character has, I usually hold this rule for Sues:<br><br>If a character exists to tell a story, and could have gone on living in the world even if there was no story to tell, they are not a Sue.<br><br>If a character exists to simply display traits or simply be desirable in some way (whether in power of beauty! It doesn&#39;t matter, only that they REALLY WANT YOU to like them because of what they are!) without fitting in to the world itself, then they are a Sue.<br><br>Whether they are a Sue/Stu worth killing remains to be seen. My definiton of a CanonStu is a little less stringent than many. To me, characters like Drizzt or Eragon are CanonSues/Stus: concessions are handed to them in their worlds to them that aren&#39;t found anywhere else. I actually know very few CanonSues written by female writers. Most of them are actually rather recent, actually. Bella from Twilight for example.<br><br>This is because I think many female writers (at least in the past) came from an adult feminist rather than a youngminded-romantic viewpoint. Many of them were there to write about the struggles and effort of this female character, how they earn their place in the world by the sweat of their brow and their own merits. Even if they have Teh Awesome in them. I know for a fact that was Tamora Pierce&#39;s point. In fact, you quoted her ranting about her characters&#39; feminist history...</p>

            <p>I&#39;m afraid that last time this point came out on the Board, I didn&#39;t know that much about groups that oppose Sues other than the PPC. Nor have I bothered to remember what I already knew. Otherwise, my posts there would have been very different from the ones I put forth. Now, I think I&#39;ve learned a few things about how the &quot;Sue-Opposing&quot; community really functions.<br><br>There are two types of criticism directed at Suefic. One is constructive criticism, in which one tries to tell an Author what they are doing wrong without trying to sound unnecessarily combative, and flaming, in which insults are hurled at the Author as well as the fic, sometimes verging on death threats. I had only been focusing on the former.<br><br>My perception was that most sporkers were like Neshomeh, Araeph, and July, who tried to help Authors but got flamed in response because their reviews weren&#39;t 100% percent praise. Araeph even gave an example in which a 30-year old Author gave her a flame out of proportion to the criticism. Fanficrants also has many examples in which relatively benign crit is met with shouting and insults.<br><br>Then, I began checking the review pages for Suefic on FF.N. While its true that there were people trying their best to help, pointing out the qualities and flaws of the story, there are also people who go &quot;Mary Sue, Die!&quot; or &quot;I want to destroy everything you love, including your cellphone&quot;. Also, for every good Sue Parody fic, there are a bunch of bad ones that focus only on superficial symptoms.<br><br>Not merely that, but on other sporking sites (I won&#39;t name names), outrage at how the canon characters are OOC shells of their former selves are often derailed into personal attacks on the Author him/herself. Ironically, those sites also call themselves feminist for tackling issues like heteronromativity, rape culture, and so on. However, they have not tackled the questions you posted, at least to my knowledge.<br><br>So, where am I going with this? Let&#39;s just say that I can&#39;t disagree with you entirely, not anymore. I still belive that the PPC isn&#39;t wrong in what it does, but that doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t a double standard, or that the term &quot;Mary Sue&quot; isn&#39;t used too often. I think that we do need a united defnition of a Sue, and that we should speak out against those who misuse the term.<br><br>I hope I don&#39;t come as calling for a crusade, or being aggressive again. Its just that there are two sides to every picture, and to me, the PPC was just focusing on one.</p>

            <p>She is a PG for it after all. She&#39;s just calling for some critical analysis about the term Mary Sue.<br><br><br>The problem with the term Mary Sue is that it is too nebulous. It <i>never</i> had a standard definition, and with how large and decentralized the fanfic community has gotten I doubt it ever will. There also seems to be an insistence that Mary Sue only applies to female characters (which I have always disagreed with - there&#39;s no reason the term can&#39;t be gender neutral. Making a &#39;gary stu&#39; counterpart is just unnecessary) which means that the term is going to be loaded with gender bias for as long as it is used.<br><br>I think that if we want to start making more clean language we&#39;ll have to start inventing new terms. A term for a character that has talents, innate powers, extreme beauty, etc above and beyond his/her peers (which would function only as a Trope, not necessarily as an automatic negative component. Not All Tropes are Bad), and another term for a character that seems to draw attention to his/herself in a story inexplicably, and drives the plots in ways that can only be explained with Fridge Logic.<br><br>The former would serve as the traditional superficial Mary Sue traits (and would not be negative by default) while the latter would cover the deeper Mary Sue traits (which would almost always be negative). </p>

            <p>For me, what makes a Sue/Stu, is not as much how the character is and what it can do, as how it affects people around it. If people instantly trusts the character and let it do things it shouldn&#39;t be getting away with, it is probably a Sue/Stu.<br><br>Take for example the beautiful, second daugther of Elrond, who falls in love with Legolas as soon as she lays eyes on him and who sneaks into the council and then jumps out and demands to go with the Fellowship. Definite - one might even say, classic - Sue, right? Except that after jumping out and making demands, she is sternly but kindly told off by Elrond and sent to her room, and the Felloweship leaves without her at dusk (or dawn, depending on &#39;verse). In that case she is still uncanonical, but I would say that she is not a Sue, since everyone around her acts sensibly and in character.<br><br>In fanfiction, Sues and Stues are mostly easy to spot, since we know how the canon characters are supposed to act and can spot it when they are being warped. A stranger walking in and instantly becomming friends with everyone would be a Sue in most canon, (but not, for example, My Little Pony).<br><br>CanonStues (telescope-word, yay!) are harder to spot, because we don&#39;t know whether their surroundings are acting as they usually would, we can only look at whether we think they are reasonable, based on what we know of the setting. Also, while it is easy to see when someone is stealing the spotlight, it is much harder to see when the person who belongs in the spotlight is hogging it. Most main-characters has some degree of main-characterness (which TV-Tropes has an excellent word for, which I can&#39;t remeber nor find), which means that f.ex. people in high places at least listen to them, even if the don&#39;t comply with them, so the line gets fuzzy.<br><br>While I will agree with those who say that fanfiction-Stues are mostly females and written by females, I think it is annoying if someone tries to argue that the same goes for canon-Stues. My experience are that they are 50-50, when it comes to original characters.<br>You are rigth that male characters get away with a lot more than women, without being called Stues. I think that has something to do with more people having heard of Sues than of Stus, but also with the general tendency to look at male characters as ... characters, while female characters get scrutinized and usually found either too weak or to strong, too feminist or not feminist enough, not a good rolemodel for girls or a two-dimensional, boring character who always do the right things.<br>Mikael Blomkvist from &#39;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo&#39; is not just a Stu, he is a blatant self-insert by the author, but most people don&#39;t think about that. In fact most people don&#39;t think about him at all; meanwhile Lisbeth Salander gets poked and prodded and discussed, in a way that would never have happend if she had been a male sidekick.</p>

I&#39;m prepared to believe that that&#39;s part of why female characters <i>get</i> analysed so much more, and as such are accused of being Sues far more than male characters are accused of being Stus.<br><br>Heck, I know I do it when I&#39;m not watching myself.

That boys don&#39;t like nerdy girls and if you&#39;re clever and academically accomplished then you&#39;ll end up alone (and anyway, I have no idea what her job was. Maybe she was now an author or something).<br><br>In my defence over that bitterness, at this time I&#39;d spent some time putting up with &quot;Oh, you&#39;re the one that&#39;s <i>not</i> engaged&quot; being the way people distinguished between me and my little sister.</p>

            <p>... People actually say that, to your face and all?<br><br>IFRC Hermione got a high position in the Ministry of Magic.<br><br>But yeah, that is the perfect example.

            <p>And now she&#39;s married I&#39;ve also had a couple of rounds of &quot;Ah, yes, the one that didn&#39;t get married.&quot;<br>I have to resist the urge to respond, &quot;That&#39;s right. I&#39;m the one that just got her degree from a world-class university.&quot;<br><br>To be honest, I have to try to be interested in Arwen, but having put in the effort I do think she&#39;s a genuinely interesting character, and strong in a way that the film missed entirely. It is true that her main motivation for staying in Middle-Earth is love for Aragorn and she doesn&#39;t do more than offer moral support, but I&#39;m actually prepared to let a high fantasy princess who is not a major character do that. I can see that she&#39;s strong in her own way, and I can see that the support she offers is important to the plot, and that&#39;s enough. I&#39;d not accept her as the heroine of the story, but that&#39;s because the action is happening with Aragorn.<br><br>Unfortunately, I can&#39;t think of a male character with that sort of role in order to make the comparison, or, indeed, a male character of whom we can fairly say that his only motivation is a woman. I have seen people criticise statements that Aragorn&#39;s <i>sole</i> motivation (as opposed to a major motivation) was Arwen, though, on the grounds that it makes him a terrible hero if the only reason he saved the world and defeated the dark lord and reclaimed his kingdom was so that he could hop into the sack with a pretty woman. So maybe there&#39;s hope?</p>

            <p>This contains a more-than-healthy dose of subjectivity, so be warned :)<br><br>For me, a Sue in fanfiction becomes a Sue when the canon characters start to pay undue attention to her. My favourite example is a fic I read years ago which caused me to add &#39;anti-Sue&#39; to my list of Sue classifications. The author had gone to great lengths to remove all Sueish traits from the character and, in the attempt, had removed most of her interesting traits as well. I literally do not remember anything about this character apart from thinking she was rather dull and didn&#39;t seem to have much to contribute, and having the niggling feeling that something was off about the way the canon characters were treating this utterly unremarkable person. I realised what it was when Erestor and Glorfindel took time out during the couple of days around the Council of Elrond to take her for a picnic: for some reason, all the canon characters she met became fascinated by her, despite the fact that there was nothing to draw real attention. In some ways, it would have been less noticable and irritating had she been a classic Sue with ethereal beauty and five different kinds of elemental magic, because there would have been a reason for the canon characters to notice her.<br><br>That same qualification can apply to original stories, though I&#39;ve not seen the problem there as much. An example that comes to mind is actually for a male character who does actually have striking good looks, a reputation and a powerful organisation backing him, so the comparison is imperfect. The book in question is Clive Cussler&#39;s <i>Lost City</i> and (trying not to spoil it) I felt that the villains dedicated a level of energy to eliminating Kurt Austin, the hero, that seemed quite out of proportion to the actual threat he posed, setting elaborate and dangerous traps in order to gain the satisfaction of personally killing him. James Bond villains are much the same.<br>In both the Kurt Austin and James Bond cases, the villains have had a chance to get to know the hero and resent him. Far more telling is the way smaller characters interact with Austin (I&#39;ve read that book more recently than anything Bond, so I&#39;ll stick with that example, though I&#39;m aware it&#39;s more obscure). In many cases they take one look at him and know he&#39;s an honest badass with a plan. I call this instatrust and count it as part of the world revolving around a Sue (or Stu, in this case, since most action heroes are pretty blatent Stus).<br><br>Although, as I say, the comparison between Kurt Austin, head of the NUMA Special Assignments team, and a random teenaged girl is imperfect, Austin&#39;s influence is correspondingly wider in scope as he can persuade people to do things like lend him expensive equipment and potentially get themselves fired from their jobs without even having to show ID. I feel that the comparison therefore stands and undue attention (including instatrust and everything that happens being connected to him/her) is a reasonable Sue trait for both fanfic and canon purposes and, as we can see from this example, applies to both male and female characters.<br><br>(Others include having objective knowledge of in-story reality and never suffering from bad consequences, but this post is already far too long. I can go into them more if anyone cares to hear about it :) )<br><br>I&#39;m a little sorry you posted that quote from Tamora Pierce, though. I never had a problem with her - read some of her books when I was a teenager and enjoyed them, and never considered Alanna a Sue. Still don&#39;t, looking back, if only because it seemed that she earned what she got. That quote, though... I can&#39;t read it without hearing &quot;Oh yeah? Well... you&#39;re stupid!&quot; and it&#39;s kind of given my opinion of her a knock.<br><br>Have you a link to that litmus test? I&#39;m always interested in tests that don&#39;t go &#39;Is she pretty? Is she an elf? Is she related to a canon character? She&#39;s a Sue, then.&#39;</p>

            <p>The discussion on which she was posting was basically someone telling her about various characters who they&#39;d seen labeled Sues for no apparent reason other than they were strong female characters-- which, obviously, would bother her a lot.

            <p>...this issue came up on the Board (not the IRC). So I&#39;m a bit nervous posting my views now. However, here are my arguments:<br><br>For me, what makes a Sue or Stu is the lack of real flaws and limits, with the latter more important than the former. Most of the characters sporked by the PPC have nothing going for them except a cliched corncoupia of awesome traits and powers, with a dash of tragic backstory that is soon forgotten after some moments of angst.<br><br>True, we do encounter &quot;Not-Sues or Not-Stus&quot; that are physically unattractive, can&#39;t do stuff considered cool, or are devoid of &#39;awesome&#39; traits to the point of flatness. But on closer inspection, they still get everything for free most of the time, and when they don&#39;t, it&#39;s meant to be treated as a moment of utter unfairness from an unfair world and everyone is supposed to sympathise with them unless they&#39;re monsters in human shape.<br><br>Here&#39;s an example: Benjamin Perry* is 18, a nerd with conspicuous pimples and oily hair and a penchant for clumsiness. But then he falls in Middle-Earth, where he is accepted instantly into Rivendell, belived right away when he says that their story is published as fiction in the far-off future, and allowed to go with the Fellowship despite his aforementioned clumsiness.<br><br>There, he keeps tripping on tree roots every so often, and his unattractive features are described once every chapter. But, everyone loves him except Boromir (who, even when he raises practical objections to Ben&#39;s coming, is still protrayed as a one-dimensional jerk with nor redeeming qualities). Then, he saves Gandalf at Moria, and at Lorien, Galadriel makes much of his &#39;wisdom&#39; and &#39;purity&#39;, even though those aren&#39;t shown beyond a few token mentions.<br><br>Then, he prevents the Fellowship from breaking by exposing Boromir as a coveteous liar just by showing Aragorn a passage from the book. Boromir is then given a humiliating exit, and then dies soon after without doing anything to redeem himself unlike in the book. This makes him best friends forever with the rest of the Fellowship, who take him to Mordor, where despite his clumsiness, he doesn&#39;t alert the orcs and other sentries.<br><br>Once they reach Mount Doom, he then destroys the Ring by ripping it off from Frodo and throwing it into the lava himself. He also has Sam kill Gollum by informing him that he&#39;ll be trying to attack Frodo on the Mountain. Once the mountain explodes, he then reassures the Fellowship that the Eagles are going to rescue them - despite the changes already made to the story. He is then given the highest honors when they get back to Minas Tirith, with everyone including Faramir suddnly forgetting about his part in Boromir&#39;s death. <br><br>On the Obverse, we have people who are Awesome and Tragic, unrealistically so. But they have some subtle flaw, some subtle limit, that makes them not a Sue/Stu. In fact, they can even be said to be Deconstructions of Sueish traits. Sorry to remind you of one of your debates in the IRC, but for me, most powerful-but-friendless characters fall into the Subtly Flawed/Subtly Limited camp.<br><br>For example, Paul Muad&#39;dib from <i>Dune</i> has a lot of Sueish charactheristcs. Noble lineage, special powers and training, and a great and tragic injustice early in his life. But what makes him not a Stu is that even when he reaches a position of power, the Universe is not willing to let him walk all over it. Not merely that, but the series does not cover up his morally dubious deeds or pass them off as unambigiously correct.<br><br>If he was a Stu, then those who plot his overthrow (and suceed) woudn&#39;t be portrayed as having points. If he was a Stu, then he would have been portrayed as the victim of an uncaring, unfair world and everyone would have been expected to overlook his dark deeds. Nor would his fall have been portrayed as self-inflicted, at least in part.<br><br>There are also characters with Sueish traits but limited spotlight. For example, Faramir of <i>LotR</i> is everything Boromir isn&#39;t: He is scholarly, yet a good figther nonetheless, is able to see the larger picture, and is able to resist the power of the Ring. However, he only appears for a few chapters, where he is generally helpful to the protagonists and allows them their space in the story.<br><br>In fact, there are a lot of awesome, tragic, and otherwise Sueish characthers that avoid Suedom because they show respect to the protagonists and don&#39;t try to usurp their place. You may disagree with this view (and the others that I put forth), but for me, several characters you see as Sues and Stus aren&#39;t, and some characters you see as Not Sues, but just flat characters are, as they don&#39;t do anything to earn the good things they get.<br><br>As for my views on Tamora Price&#39;s statement and the &quot;Sue-Opposing&quot; movement at large, I&#39;ll make another post as this one has become too big. <br><br>*A character made up just now, but based on certain archetypes spoken about on other sites.</p>

            <p>I have seen a lot of people use the label Mary Sue on a canon female character they didn&#39;t like. The only one that comes to mind now is in the Avatar (Last Airbender, the cartoon AKA good one. I ship TophxSokka, and a lot of people just labeled the opposing love interest, Suki, a Mary Sue. It does get grating, and almost made me stop reading the stories. Feeling shame for my Ship-mates isn&#39;t fun.<br><br>As for what makes a Mary Sue...Well, I can agree with your definition a lot, actually. In an Avatar story, Sokka gets powerful with non-canon powers, and it adds a lot of Cthulhu-esque themes and a complete non-canon race! But...I read it again, and while it pings my non-canon radar, I can&#39;t dislike it. Sokka is still Sokka, and everyone still treats him like usual (still the Butt Monkey).<br><br>To be honest, Eva didn&#39;t make me angry, with her elemental powers, because I have no objection with making powers up, or being different. Even the spells heather made up, with the exclusion of the Resurrection spell, didn;t make me angry. Heather herself made me angry. She, herself, was a horrible person and got away with it all, not being called out. <br><br>If we could use/make another word instead of Mary Sue, I&#39;d be all for it. Making one would be an interesting time, I&#39;m sure.<br><br>Looking back on the aspects of being a Mary Sue, having super powers, being powerful, being better, then wouldn&#39;t a lot of old FPS characters be? I remember in Medal of Honor: Frontline (Remember the begining of the PS2...I feel old now..) you are a person who is named only, but never talks, or communicates, and you kill swathes of enemies, and generally win the war yourself. I guess it could be more complicated then that, but it struck me just now. Just something to ponder. <br></p>
