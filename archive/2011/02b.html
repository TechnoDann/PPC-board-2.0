            <p>To officially be classified as &#39;criminal menace&#39; (the legalese term for stalking) the person in question must harass or follow the person or people in question three or more times with malicious intent before they can be charged. Socially, of course, things are generally less lenient; just a single occasion, even without malice, even without intent, can cause someone to be labeled a stalker. But all this, of course, is provided it&#39;s in person. On the Internet, of course, there&#39;s nothing to stop it from going on indefinately. <br><br>However, I get the sense that that has absolutely nothing to do with what you&#39;re asking, and that I&#39;m just taking the opportunity to use Wikipedia to be pretentious. I do that sometimes (read; too much). You&#39;re asking because you&#39;ve posted exactly two things on here, your introduction and a call for help when the BBC Sherlock Holmes forum attacked you for suggesting...cooperation with the PPC? Something like that. Anyway, putting my not-inconsiderable research skills aside for the moment (alas), I shall spake my response thusly:<br><br>I also lurked for quite some time before I worked up the courage to introduce myself (three years, actually) and I think I understand your plight. You seem to feel that you have nothing to contribute to our dear organization, and have therefore not contributed any of what you in fact could. This viewpoint is weighing you down. You have put these shackles on, and so you can take them off yourself. When you&#39;re ready, I have no doubt that you will. However, I&#39;m in no position to make judgements on this, and in any case, I may be full of **** with my whole theory.<br><br>The point is, I think, that you should follow your bliss, my friend. I wish you well where&#39;ere the winds of fate shall blow you. Ciao, my dear. </p>

            <p>board related, fic related or real life related?<br><br>My dictionary says a lurker does not participate and a stalker  showers someone with obsessive and unwanted attention. A lurker to the extreme can thus not be classified as stalker, because that would mean the lurker had started taking action. Which is quite the opposite of what the lurker had been doing.</p>

            <p>The link I&#39;m posting below leads to the complete oeuvre of one Hans von Hozel.  He claims he&#39;s writing these fics to &quot;make an improve of my English.&quot;  Some of his best works (read: the fics that I actually read) are:<br><br>Knuckles and Sonic save the Beach:  Where Knuckles and Sonic do absolutely nothing of the sort, and Tails is mistaken for a girl (I think.  The wording is rather vague on that regard.)<br><br>The Raven:  Wherein some hunters attempt to kill the titular character of the Edgar Allen Poe poem of the same name for its &quot;nice fur coat!&quot;<br><br>HalfLife:  The Combine arrive and smash Gordon&#39;s &quot;Science.&quot;  Then Gordon kills them.<br><br>Warhammer:  Unique among all other Warhammer fics, in that Hans admits that he knows absolutely nothing about the universe, and instead writes a story about generic aliens and a sentient warhammer.<br><br>The Room:  An alternative ending to the movie of the same name, where Earth and Mars are nuked into oblivion.  (And yet I still can&#39;t help but think that this would have made perfect sense had it actually been the ending for The Room.)<br><br>There are many more fanfics to be found in the link below.  (248, to be specific, all of them short, one chapter affairs.)  In general, if you name a fandom, chances are good Hans has written a fic about it.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1730364/Hans_von_Hozel"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1730364/Hans_von_Hozel">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1730364/Hans_von_Hozel</a></a></p>

            <p>I have a theory about that guy.  I&#39;m guessing, when he started writing these fics back in ye olden days of 2008, that he was genuinely trying to improve his grasp of the English language.  However, at some point, after he had improved his English language skills, he looked up, saw the reviews he was getting for his fics, and said, &quot;Hm, you know, these fics I wrote aren&#39;t written very well, but the reviewers seem to love their unintentional hilarity.  I&#39;ll just keep writing that way, people would love it, and I&#39;ll danube my way into Internet stardom!&quot;  Of course, we&#39;ll probably never know the truth one way or the other.<br><br>As for the idea of doing a mission on one of those fics, I think the best ones to start with would be the two Titanic fics he wrote, since one of them is a prequel to the other.  There&#39;s also one multi chapter fic he put up which covers, of all things, the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, but I haven&#39;t looked at that one, and thus, couldn&#39;t tell you if it&#39;s any good to spork.</p>

            <p>Well, I recently found out about PPC and it became some sort of a obsession.

In theory, introducing myself should focus my attention from PPC stories to checking if I got some replies.<br><br>Also, it gets me plenty of time if I decide to start writing spin-offs when school storm calms down a bit.<br><br>So, here, I&#39;m FreeAndy, a 17 year-old girl in love with reading and writing, who isn&#39;t sure why she got into prep high, &quot;mathematician division&quot; (I REALLY have no idea how am I supposed to translate that into English, so... yeah).

            <p>Bleeprin: a medication often used to soften the trauma of appalling badfic. It is made out of bleach, which gets rid of potentially scarring mental images, and aspirin, which deals with the headache. It comes in the form of a round white pill about the size of a chickpea (or large normal pea).<br><br>Bleepolate: Bleeprin and chocolate. Invented by Boarder Artic Blade, for those who want their oblivion without the hangover.<br><br>NM&amp;NMs: Bleepolate M&amp;Ms that come in bleen, blello, urple, and wilver.

            <p>Hello all, Songbird-O here.<br><br>I&#39;ve been hanging around here for just about a month, and I was wondering if I could be granted permission.<br><br>I would like to apply as a scientist, since I think of myself as more of a critic than an assassin. I don&#39;t write fanfiction very often, but I look at everything I approach with a critical eye.<br><br>Here is a sample of some of my critical analysis. The link will bring you to my DeviantART journal, particularly an entry where I talk about the flaws of Golden Sun: Dark Dawn, and why I think they are acceptable in that game, as opposed to anywhere else.<br><a href="http://zomgwingly.deviantart.com/journal/37463758/"><a href="http://zomgwingly.deviantart.com/journal/37463758/">http://zomgwingly.deviantart.com/journal/37463758/</a></a><br><br>I have dabbled in fanfiction too, of course. To this day, I have only submitted one story to FF.net. It is a Dragon Quest V one-shot that I wrote a year ago. While it has some pacing problems, I still think it is a decent piece. It is a simple look at two sides of an in-game event.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5692509/1/When_Ends_Meet"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5692509/1/When_Ends_Meet">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5692509/1/When_Ends_Meet</a></a></p>

            <p>The post was posted prematurely. Since I am insecure, I would like to continue down here.<br><br>My first agent would be Songbird. She is an artist avatar that has existed for eleven years in various still pictures posted on various sites. Only recently has she been removed from her constantly-smiling ID picture to participate in the PPC. She is a small human, three feet high at the most, with a pair of little bird wings on her back. These wings buzz like those of a fly, can can only lift her a few inches off the ground. She cannot fight due to being extremely frail. She does, however, greatly enjoy analysis and research of various fandoms and stories.<br><br>Her partner is Agent William, a semi-canon (customizable lead) from the Dragon Quest IX continuum. He is a human who, while his age is unknown, acts and looks like a boy around ten years of age. He can use a sword, but he consideres himself a &quot;defender,&quot; only fighting if someone is in danger. Even then, he is of the Minstrel class, meaning that his style of combat focuses on support and amusement more than physical abilities.</p>

            <p>I forgot a note about William. The story of Dragon Quest IX is such that when the plot is over, the customizable lead character (and his/her team-members) are allowed to go anywhere, and do anything in the world they want-- freeing William to go be in the PPC.</p>

            <p>Nice mission. <br><br>I&#39;m a fan of the original Spyro series. However, I&#39;ve never really formed an opinion of the Legend series, though.

            <p>What do reboots of different series do to their own Continua, anyway? If they wipe out any trace of the previous canon, then what about the fics (both good and bad) that involves the same previous incarnation of that series but were written after the reboot was done?</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know. As per July&#39;s suggestion, I kind of took the &#39;timey wimey&#39; approach to time travel and canon integrity. <br><br>The Star Wars universe sees retcon and reboot a lot, so I&#39;ll use that as a baseline and leave maybe a <i>slightly</i> informed opinion here. It can be assumed that stories taking place pre-reboot are canon in context, and post-reboot are canon in a different context. It should be marked, and elements from one can be incorporated into the other with a bit of skill. <br><br>But other than that? As long as something isn&#39;t directly contradictory, I&#39;d just call &#39;timey-wimey&#39; on the whole mess and leave it be.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll say what I said in the chatroom.

            <p>Good to see you. <sup>_<sup><br><br>And</sup></sup> you brought ... um ... you brought <i>Farscape</i> badfic. I have mixed feelings about that.

            <p>I think I&#39;m in love with you right now. The setup is fantastic--out of the ordinary, yet totally plausible given the nature of the &#39;verse in question, and also <i>Farscape</i> just makes me squee in general. IC!Scorpius at the beginning kicks eema. I love the difficulties the agents are facing, being cut off from HQ&#39;s resources. I can&#39;t wait for the rest. <sup>_<sup><br><br>Honestly,</sup></sup> yeah, being a big Scorpi fan, I kinda get it. But ugh. And ew. And WHY?<br><br>As for &quot;Subjugation,&quot; yes, it is happening, hopefully sometime this year. W<em>M and I are doing a co-write to get her agents back in the saddle, and then it&#39;s <i>on</i>. The story of what happened back then, as far as I remember and/or retconned into making sense, may be found on the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Subjugation">Subjugation</a> article on our wiki.<br><br>...

It&#39;s been years, but maybe I should dig those old books out again, in preparation, since I know someone&#39;s going to write horrible, horrible action/adventure fic. Of course, in that case the canon has so many bad action tropes that it would be hard to say what fan authors can get away with.</p>

            <p>It lacks the sense of humor I&#39;ve come to associate with other MSTs. You had a couple jokes here and there, but most of what I observed were either direct observations (spelling corrections, for example) or just railing against the author.<br><br>Still, I guess it&#39;s a bit understandable since you&#39;re still only in the author&#39;s notes.

            <p>Is it me but does most of the plot and characterisation of this fic have nothing to do with Poke&#39;mon. Author should probably give original fiction a go, to see if they do better working within a universe of their own making.</p>

            <p>So. I was a bit annoyed by the amount of Hetalia badfic cropping up (not to mention all the Mary Sues on DA)... and since no one had done an OFU for Hetalia before, I thought I&#39;d try.<br>(Pst, Cassie, I used my own waiver this time! *grins sheepishly*)<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6746784/1/The_International_Academy_of_Hetalia_Fanfiction">The International Academy of Hetalia Fanfiction</a> will now be taking registration for fanbrats of all shapes and sizes. <br><br>(also, any PPCers willing to participate in any future Crises that may arise?

            <p>Well, OFUM focused on Lina pretty much all throughout the story, and from what I&#39;ve seen, the main student character in OFUs (aka the author&#39;s student) gets most of the spotlight as it&#39;s his/her time at that OFU. Besides that, the only other students whose heads I can &#39;get into&#39; are Megan&#39;s, Merka&#39;s, and Kriss&#39;s.

            <p>It&#39;s true.

I don&#39;t really ask where people get their names, though. So... yeah.</p>

            <p>Sorry. The reason why I asked this is because I was making RPG Maker Sprites for myself. Nothing big at the moment, just that. Although I can make most of the sprites of the characters, I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be an easy process if I don&#39;t have a clue of what some of the OCs look like at all.<br><br>Speaking of that, are the characters wearing uniforms in the school? Are they just wearing random clothing that they would usually wear? What?</p>

            <p>Now I have a clearer picture of what a Division is.<br><br>My idea about the roles of the Fighter Wing (formally under the Floaters, but actually going to be used by a lot of Departments) was this:<br><br>- Shooting down Sues that fly/ride/drive nearly all the time in Ace Combat, Macross, or similar canons with heavy machinery involved (not Gundam, since only one aircraft in Ace Combat history is space-capable ad for a limited amount of time). Basically, a bigger stick to poke Sues that otherwise would slay Agents when they try to do the kill.<br>- Helping DOGA cleaning out uncanonical cities and landscapes too big for a single squad of Pyros but too small (e.g. less than the whole solar system) to warrant the use of a Sun Crusher.<br>- Following action in Ace Combat and similar canons when otherwise Words and extensive portalling would be tedious for the reader.<br><br>Why is it a punishment? I though it was more of &quot;try to stay alive when attempting to shoot down Ace!Sues&quot;: the mission I am writing right now is about killing off an Ace!Stu!James Sirius Potter (Yes, Harry Potter&#39;s son) that flyies around in an F-22 even when still a trainee. My agents have a single F-14A (only aircraft currently own by the Fighter Wing. It&#39;s an AC5 one, so quite cheap and hopefully not a money and maintenance sink like the real one.). If Reality Ensues, they&#39;re kinda screwed. Not to mention a single error when taking off or landing would reduce Agents and plane to a fireball.<br><br>So, any idea on what formally should be the PPC Fighter Wing? Only a couple agents with planes? A Sub-Division? Something else entirely? Shouldn&#39;t be existing at all?</p>

            <p>... why have you chosen to give them fighters? Is it:<br><br>a) Because it&#39;s funny<br><br>or<br><br>b) Because it&#39;s easier?<br><br>a) is good. b) is not. If you think it&#39;s funny to write them shooting down &#39;Sues by using their own PPC fighter(s), then the Fighter Wing or something like it is a necessity. If you think it&#39;d just be easier, go for funny instead - stealing fighters, using anti-air missiles, tricking the &#39;Sue into flying into a cliff, etc etc etc. (I specify killing &#39;Sues - this applies equally to any other department, and to simply chasing the action around). It seems like something that could well be funny - or could just be a way to make life easier for you. Only you know that. Just make sure you <i>do</i> know which it is.<br><br>hS, ramblin&#39;</p>

            <p>It&#39;s funny, since they are stilL two common agents who get their hands on a fighter jet (One of my agents had little experience on a DC-3, but I think you all know that a F-14 is a lot different!)<br><br>I cannot say what parts will be funny, since they are different from fic to fic, but I can say that in my next mission there will be some.<br><br>SPOILER: The planes used by the Stu and his fellow bits during a training exercise are rigged into ejecting the pilot when locked on. A very stupid thing, since you lose a plane for every simulated &quot;kill&quot;. When my agents close in and lock on... the Stu ejects. In the end, the Stu is killed by shredding his chute with gunfire.<br><br>Obviously there will be some recurring gags such as DoSAT complaining about every single thing done by the agents with the plane and refusing to give them a decent enough plane for the mission, posing as canonical squadrons to scare the hell out of canonicals NOT suppoosed to be flying at all (and subsequent reprimand from Flowers for impersonating canons), and maybe a couple planes crashed on landing...<br><br>And not easier, since they have to think how trick Ace!Sues into &quot;meeting&quot; with their weapons while trying to stay alive themselves. I do not have many Ace Combat examples right now, but about that continuum I can say that Sues will surely dodge pretty any kind of missile, even AC4 QAAMs (For those not familiar with AC, they&#39;re the &quot;it hits no matter what you do in 95% of cases&quot; missile.)<br><br><br>However, it still is something experimental. If I am not able to work it out well in the first couple missions, the PPC Fighter Wing will cease to exist. Or, rather, it will cease to have ever existed at all, since the mission will became uncanon.</p>

            <p>I was thinking about a similar things: agents get sent in with a plane decent but not perfect (F-14, exactly. But maybe I downgrade it to a F-4.), but somehow send back to HQ a couple F-22s.

            <p>It seems to me that what you&#39;ve got is in effect a canon division authorized to use special equipment due to the nature of the canon, so like Arbre said, that wouldn&#39;t warrant a division head. They&#39;d still answer directly to the Floating Hyacinth (not to mention having DoSAT breathing down their necks about treating the equipment well).<br><br>Another thing, though: exactly how is being transferred to a division that allows the use of fighter jets a punishment? To me, it sounds too high on the badass scale to truly be a bad thing.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>A while back there was a call to stop creating new divisions.<br><br>I believe this was in response to people seeming to create new divisions at the drop of a hat (not head, no matter what my fingers think). The point then was -- and I think it still stands now -- is it really, really necessary to create a new division?<br><br>And more of question to put my missions in line with everyone else&#39;s: do divisions really need their own head? My agents seem to do &quot;fine&quot; being bossed around by the head of the department. Or any flower with authority over agents.</p>

            <p>There are two types of divisions - those based on different canons, and those created for specific jobs. For example, the Harry Potter Division of the DBS is one of the former, while the Division of Mpreg would be one of the latter. What&#39;s important to note is that while Mpreg has a Division Head, HP would not. Now, from what you&#39;re saying, the Fighter Wing sounds more specialized than canon, even if you mostly spork Ace Combat fics, and therefore having a flower just for them sounds fine to me. <br><br>Now, I personally don&#39;t see why you shouldn&#39;t use the Crocus. In a consensual reality like ours, it&#39;s generally better to reuse something rather than make something new up, and I don&#39;t see why this would be any different. However, newbie-shrimp that I am, my approval is not the Board&#39;s approval, and you should probably wait for one of the Oldbies to confirm or deny what I&#39;m saying before you do anything.<br><br>Hope this helps a bit. Ciao. </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t see it being a problem, but I doubt I&#39;m allowed to give permission for this type of thing. A suggestion I might make is that you make the division more inclusive, possibly turn it into a division for fics that would require agents to use vehicles? Though you don&#39;t have too, we did have a Legend of Zelda division at some point.<br><br>I do like your idea though, hopefully it comes through.</p>

            <p>You could just ask her, since the list is her baby.<br><br>Also, providing you have an account at PPC Wiki, you can add the number to the list yourself. I think all you need is a username for that--they don&#39;t even demand an e-mail. It&#39;s quite simple, and you&#39;ll probably want an account to make agent pages and such eventually anyway. {= )<br><br>Of course, all that said, you might want to wait until you actually have a mission posted first. Aster and I have been encountering the effects of people making agents and never writing about them lately.

            <p>I was recently attempting to read a mission, (&quot;Aura&quot;) supposedly located at <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn3/AuraPart1.htm"><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn3/AuraPart1.htm">http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn3/AuraPart1.htm</a></a> . Sadly, the site there has gone down and now redirects to a &quot;Frozen for Abuse&quot; page. The mission appears (from the wiki) to have been written by Huinesoron. Google Cache and the Wayback Machine both don&#39;t work. <br><br>Could someone please help recover this page?<br><br>Many thanks.</p>

This means she sees in black and white, has a good sense of smell, and looks as in the image above.<br><br>Home Continuum: An AU of an original fiction continuum, both of which are co-written by me and a friend. In the original one, humans are all but nonexistent. In her version, humans won the First Human-Dragon war, adapted the taaju’s antimagic field, and spread it everywhere, causing the near-eradication of the other races, especially the rkiye, who rely on magic for even their genetics. Human culture then developed nearly exactly as it did in World One, down to the novels.<br><br>History: Grey grew up fairly normally, without a Tragic Backstory or anything of the kind. At about seventeen, she developed wanderlust, ran off, and fell through a plot hole into the role-play section of a forum. She became adept at finding plot holes if not telling where they led, and wandered through several more forums and stories, including an Academy for adventurers, where she learned how to fight decently. During this time, she also developed a hatred for bad writing and Mary-Sues, because being pitted against a Mary-Sue when you’re a relatively low-powered character is rarely pleasant. Finally, she stumbled into the PPC and signed on immediately, although she sometimes regrets her decision.<br><br>Bio: Grey is usually fairly easy-going, having developed a habit of not reacting to things that annoy her. However, this defense is not perfect, and when something makes her angry it makes her <i>angry.</i><br><br><a href="http://i699.photobucket.com/albums/vv356/grimmykitten/lia2.png?t=1297313388"><a href="http://i699.photobucket.com/albums/vv356/grimmykitten/lia2.png?t=1297313388">http://i699.photobucket.com/albums/vv356/grimmykitten/lia2.png?t=1297313388</a></a><br><br>Agent Name:  Lia<br><br>Full Name: Liaeru Rokomi<br><br>Department: Floaters.<br><br>Partner: Agent Grey<br><br>Age: Youngish adult; not very well defined.<br><br>Height: Average.<br><br>Species: Translucent human from an alternate universe.<br><br>Home Continuum: An unfinished novel written, in this ‘verse, by Grey.<br><br>History: Lia was a fairly privileged member of her race’s society, and grew up pretty sheltered.<br>However, unlike everyone else from the continuum, she lacks the ability to use runic magic, a source of much angst in her childhood. It turned out that her world was a source of large amounts of magic, and after an attack from another universe she stole their portal technology and began to recruit- well, kidnap really- talented people from other universes to protect it. Unfortunately, one of the kidnap-ees rather resented this and betrayed her, ultimately leading to her death. Already being from a black-clad, multiversal, portal-using organization devoted to protecting something, Lia was not too shocked when instead of dying in her story, she fell through a portal opened by Grey, who really needed a partner.<br><br>Bio: Lia is extremely violent, with a hair trigger and a habit of carrying around lots of pointy objects. Her mood also changes extremely quickly, and she can go from “decently happy” to “homicidal rage” and vice versa in less than a minute. She has a lack of caring about her appearance, and so her hair and clothes are often a mess.

            <p>I think there&#39;s more to getting permission than just wait around the board. Read this page from the wiki for more information: <br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission</a></a><br><br>Basically, waiting around here for a month isn&#39;t the only thing for you to do in order to get permission. For example, you guys will also have to actually interact with the boarders in the meantime. <br><br>If you guys already know about how permission and all that works, then I&#39;m sorry about posting this. That, and I wonder if someone can correct me about it if I&#39;m wrong about something.</p>
