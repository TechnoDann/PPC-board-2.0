            <p>PERMISSION REQUEST:<br>So…it’s been a month-ish…and I was wondering if I could have Permission.<br>Here is a sample from my FF.net account (it’s a Hunger Games fanfic, just in case you were wondering).  <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6563595/1/Third_Person"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6563595/1/Third_Person">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6563595/1/Third_Person</a></a><br><br>AGENTS:<br><br>NAME: Katie Kachinsky<br><br>HOME CONTINUUM: World One<br><br>GENDER: Female<br><br>SPECIES: Human<br><br>AGE: fifteen-and-a-bit-more-than-half-because-this-girl-is-too-lazy-to-do-the-math<br><br>APPEARANCE: curly brown-reddish hair, brown eyes, heart-ish shaped face, average height<br><br>BIO: Katie’s a bit of a spazz. Everyone sees her as a cheerful kind of girl—except when the Nazgul, any of the Valar but particularly Nessa, Tall Jake, or indeed Cho Chang are threatened. She rarely gets angry at actual people, and tends to be forgetful and lazy of certain things—doing the litterbox, getting the pay raise forms in on time, throwing out the milk before the creatures living in it discover fire, etc. She likes a wide selection of music, ranging from Hannah Fury and Emilie Autumn to Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga. But no rap. Never rap. She is also, for some odd reason, obsessed with giant squid and the planet Jupiter. Generally works in kid’s fandoms: Malice, Maze Runner, Harry Potter, etc. She was recruited from World One by means of accidentally tripping and falling into a Plot Hole and not wanting to be neuralyzed. She also has a...thing about spiders. Meaning a &quot;kill them before they kill us DIE ARACHNID AGENT OF EVIL, DIE, DIE!&quot; mindset xD<br><br>PREFERRED WEAPON: rosewood walking stick for bludgeoning, because ever since the Kitchen Sink Incident, she doesn’t like sharp objects near her fingers<br><br><br>NAME: Mellie Dawn<br><br>HOME CONTINUUM: Abarat<br><br>GENDER: female<br><br>SPECIES: Mary Sue (reformed, on Logicillin)<br><br>AGE: fifteen and a bit-more-than-half. <br><br>APPEARANCE: fairly tall, Japanese, (this combination results from the Suethor’s inaccurate grasp of genetics), has implausible blue streaks in shoulder-length black hair. Brown eyes, swirly birthmark of Significance. <br><br>BIO: used to be a bit-Sue in a truly terrible Abarat fanfic (that I totally made up for the purpose of having Mellie xD). Mellie’s actual name is Melliana Aurora Venus Boreal Dawn, and she is the (third) daughter of Finnegan Hob and a Japanese woman from the Hereafter. (Her eldest sister was the main character, to whom she and her other sister, who died tragically for the purposes of the story, were basically helpmeets.) She had all sorts of ridiculous magical powers, and escaped God-Mode-Sue-ism only by being a minor character. Yes, the author gave a character that much power and then gave them a bit part. Thanks to said author’s repentance, however, Mellie’s powers are now limited to breathing underwater, talking to fish, and waterbending. (Yes, the author got ATLA mixed up with Abarat xD)<br>Mellie is confident and not as spazzy as her partner. She, however, is far more intense about her Lust Objects than Katie is, once going so far as to throttle a Sue who was replacing Arwen Undomiel in Aragorn’s affections. Mellie tends to try and do things she would have been able to do if she was still in her original fic, which, unless the universe really likes her that day, ends in fiascos and sometimes even Noodle Incidents. Another notable thing about Mellie is that, being from Abarat, where you travel to get from one Hour to another, has a terrible grasp of time and, whenever she hears a certain Christmas carol, thinks that someone has written a spoof of the Hamster Tree song.<br><br>PREFERRED WEAPON: a frying pan of doom. She also lifted a lightwhip from the Star Wars continuum, but Katie won’t let her use it on missions because a) they hardly ever go into Star Wars, and b) because Mellie can’t actually use it yet and whenever she gets any good stops practicing out of habit. <br><br>MINIS:<br>Mini-Ceremonial Knife (Aztec Mythology) Qetzalcoatl<br><br><br>And I&#39;ll try and get the introductory non-mission bit posted on my dA fairly soon. I shalt link it here :D</p>

            <p>One small quibble, though: there are precedents for introducing new mini types. Those are that the person who gets to do that is either a) the writer of the OFU in that continuum, or b) the first person to encounter minis in a mission to that continuum. So, have a ceremonial knife if you want one--make it a magic object with a personality, even--but not an actual mini type. <br><br>Also, there is no edit button so that the Boarders of the PPC shall learn to re-read before they post. So it shall be written, so it shall be done!<br><br>~Neshomeh, who is actually just messing with you about that last bit (even though it is still a really good habit to get into--the preview button is your friend!).</p>

            <p>Having checked the page history, I see he edited the wiki to add it, early January.

            <p>PPC canon itself is collaborative, and there&#39;s really no way to check if somebody slips things in here and there. Usually it&#39;s not a problem, but it&#39;s also very important to the PPC to keep records of everything mentioned so people can use that stuff again with ease instead of making up new things every time they write a spin-off.<br><br>The more people collaborate, the harder it is to control what people add. Which is not bad-- a lot of our flavor comes from all sorts of people adding in their own stuff. But to keep it all under control at least a little bit, there are a few rules.<br><br>Don&#39;t worry, GoblinGirl, you didn&#39;t break any. But this is also part of the reason behind the wiki clean up-- it&#39;s harder to investigate PPC canon materials if stuff can slip in their willy-nilly.</p>

            <p>I say &#39;sort of&#39; because, although Araeph has already given me Permission (yay!) I thought that it really would be better if I announced things officially. Here are my agents:<br><br>Agent Nicolae ‘Nick’ Janus, DF<br><br>Appearence: Agent Janus stands 6’5”, not including his hair, which adds six inches of brilliant orange spikes that may or may not obey the laws of physics. He’s extremely slim, but quite muscular for his weight. Nick wears two small silver earrings in his left ear. Due to the odd chain of events that led him to the PPC, Nick only brought one outfit – a white t-shirt with a red Anarchy symbol, a green hoodie with a flash patch hastily stitched onto one shoulder, and a pair of brilliant yellow cargo pants. He never actually wears anything else, but due to the fractal nature of PPC time and his deliberate inability to hold onto partners for long, nobody really notices.<br><br>Background: Agent Janus was born into a modestly disreputable, generously large, and intensely overbearing family of Romanian immigrants in New York. At age eight, he ran away from home and joined a traveling circus (a pretty shady one, too, if their unquestioning welcome of an eight-year-old runaway is anything to go by). Nine years later, he ran away from the circus and joined a small Rastafarian street gang, whose location he has refused to disclose. Six years after that, he ran away from the gang and joined the PPC. His only comment is that they all seemed like good ideas at their respective times. <br><br>Personality: From a psychological standpoint, Nick is one of the better adjusted members of the PPC (i.e. borderline schizophrenic as opposed to full-on psychopath). His background has granted him many useful skills, not the least of which being an affinity with many different types of weapons. However, these positive qualities are marred by excessive laziness and an infuriatingly casual attitude towards everything. He would rather crack jokes than kill Sues and would rather play with his mini-Aragogs, practice circus tricks, watch TV, and generally loaf around than do either. However, when he is roused to action, Agent Janus is a force to be reckoned with. This, however, is no small task, and certain superiors may or may not be toying with the idea of pairing him up with someone who could get him to straighten up and fly right.<br><br>...<br><br>Agent Evonne Andrews, DF<br><br>Appearence: Agent Andrews is barely 5’7”, and is painfully aware of it. Her dark brown hair is about shoulder-length and extremely curly. She’s about average weight and build. She has no piercings, tattoos, or other body modifications. She generally wears a suit to missions, much to the amusement of less professional agents. <br><br>Background: Agent Andrews comes from a truly wretched crossover fic in which the author, in a frenzy of ‘inspiration’, decided that the story and characters of the Lord of the Rings were similar enough to those of Les Miserables for both storylines to be violently jammed together into a single piece of writing. Evonne was an amalgamation of Eponine Thernardier and Arwen Undomiel, for no other reason than (and I quote) ‘they both have brown hair’. Evonne was rescued by a charitable pair of Disentanglers when the PPC caught wind of the fic. Unfortunately, during her FicPsych retraining, an intern gave her a massive overdose of Logicillin. The psychological personal demanded that she be confined to the psych ward so they could study the effects of the drug, but due to a computer error that was in NO WAY connected to the malign curiosity of certain TOTALLY NONEXISTANT highly positioned persons in the DoP, she was listed as an Agent.<br><br>Personality: If a human, or even a lesser Sue, had been injected with the same dose of Logicillin, they would have undergone a complete personality wipe. It is a testament to the sheer mind-bending stupidity of the fic that Agent Andrews has one at all. Even so, Evonne is almost robotic in the commission of her duty. In some ways, she is the perfect Agent. She obeys every rule, protocol, and procedure in the PPC rules to the letter. She completes every assignment she is tasked with as far as she is told, and no further, with little emotion or concern. She’s nigh un-squickable, and never shows a trace of fear. However, her lack of empathy and poor cooperation skills concern some of the higher-ups. (These are COMPLETELY different higher-ups than the ones that DIDN’T make her an Agent, IF said higher-ups were to exist, which they DON’T.) Said nonexistent higher-ups are certainly NOT theorizing that, with the right partner, Evonne might loosen up.<br><br>I apologize if these are fairly long for descriptions, but the ideas for these characters have been bubbling through my brain for quite a while, accumulating details and details on top of details...Suffice to say, I actually trimmed a lot to get it down to this. <br><br>Anyway...this is how they meet (<a href="http://heros-anonymes.livejournal.com/605.html"><a href="http://heros-anonymes.livejournal.com/605.html">http://heros-anonymes.livejournal.com/605.html</a></a>) and this is what I intend to spork first (<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1824622/1/Comes_a_Badger_Warrior"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1824622/1/Comes_a_Badger_Warrior">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1824622/1/Comes_a_Badger_Warrior</a></a>).

            <p>...But I looked it over after I had posted it, and your right. It&#39;s not a brilliant piece by a long shot, and there are quite a few minor offenses, but it isn&#39;t really too bad. I was going to comment that I had changed my mind about it, but I noticed that no one seemed to interested in any case, so I just took it off the badfic page and grabbed a handy PotC Lustfic from the Pit. Nothing to worry about.<br><br>I must applaud your vigilance, however. It is all too rare that one encounters a Boarder as concerned about such things as you seem to be, and I thank you for it.<br><br>P.S. Out of curiosity, do you have any missions up?

            <p>The lowest post on the first page dates from the end of January. We&#39;re not losing brand-new, up-to-the-minute stuff every time someone posts. (I agree, as it happens, that this post should have gone on the previous thread - but that&#39;s beside the point)<br><br>Given, however, the sheer number of comments about things getting pushed off (I count four on the front page - it&#39;s turning into an epidemic!), I&#39;m going to suggest one of two options.<br><br>a) An edit to the Board header asking people to check there&#39;s not another thread they could add their post to instead of making a new one.<br><br>b) An obvious link in the header to an alternate Board (probably in a different style) for the posting solely of badfics. I was looking to see if the Board could be modified to have a pinned thread at the top (or bottom) for this purpose, but it doesn&#39;t look like it can.<br><br>Oh, or:<br><br>c) Something else which will stop this epidemic of ire.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I remember being a fervent fan of the Redwall series back during my middle and high school years. I liked them because they felt like a different kind of fantasy to me, so different from the &#39;dwarves, elves, and dragons&#39; pattern that I had grown tired of by that time. While I haven&#39;t picked up any of series in several years, I would still gladly do so (and probably will now.)</p>

            <p>...As the &#39;man who wrote those mouse books&#39; (his own words) passes into the great book-signing convention in the sky. He was one of the three people who convinced me to become a writer (along with Roald Dahl and Terry Pratchett) and he will be deeply missed.</p>

            <p>Okay, so I&#39;m still avoiding doing anything resembling homework this weekend (Go Greenbay!).  Instead, I went trawling for fics on the Pit in the HP fandom (I have masocistic tendencies), and found <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6448082">this jem </a> of a story there.  It&#39;s called <i>DADA Boycott</i>, and it&#39;s by Midnighter 13.  <br>The story is fairly unique in its approach to getting rid of Umbridge in the fifth book.  Hermione gets the idea of emulating Gandhi, the Civil Rights movement, and various passive-resistance movements from around the world to get rid of the toad.  Needless to say, everyone takes to the idea like ducks to water, and then a prank war starts up as an adendum...and snowballs from there.<br>Trust me, if you need a laugh or two, it&#39;s fairly good.  (Fair warning though, the first two chapters are a bit boring.  Rest of the story&#39;s okay.)<br>-H_W</p>

            <p>It&#39;s certainly an interesting idea, but the execution leaves much to be desired. The author&#39;s strange focus on America, dubious understanding of what those passive-right campaigns actually involved, questionable characterization, and sudden switch from pacifism to murder of Death Eaters (!) mean that, while it&#39;s readable, it&#39;s not my type of story.<br><br>That said, it could be worse, and the idea&#39;s certainly original enough.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s an acquired taste, I guess.  At the time, I&#39;d only read up to chapter 5--that was before the &quot;Let&#39;s kill the Death Eaters&quot; thing came up.  There are still bits of humor in it, but not really after that bit.  The author is American--you wouldn&#39;t believe how little the schools actually teach us about the world, unless you sign up for electives.  Oh Hades, but the American school system really sucks some days.<br>/rant<br>It&#39;s at least not a bad fic, and the author <i>does</i> make some good points in their notes about the story&#39;s birth.  That being said, I&#39;m still looking for a fic where a Ravenclaw puts up a message board that takes requests for accidents to befall Umbridge--it was actually fairly well-executed, and Umbridge tripped off the stairs as they wer changing (and it was a one-shot, I think.)<br>-H_W</p>

            <p>The author could still have made an effort to localize it, and obviously has at least some knowledge of world history.

Before that could happen, however, her home fic was intercepted by agents Maria, Mark, and Cadmar, and her fetus extracted before she could do any further damage to Crane, her “mother.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shortly after her arrival at HQ, Whin was adopted by the soon-to-be-retired agent Theodore Petty, despite the fact that she was not fully developed. Petty, using his tardis’ technology, artificially “grew” Whin until she was a fully developed infant, and while this would have some repercussions later on (see below), Whin grew up happy and (relitively) healthy, journeying with her father from continuum to continuum, and hearing stories of the brave agents who kept such wondrous worlds in check.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While she began training at a young age with her father, Whin officially started agent training when she was fourteen, showing an affinity for knives, psychology and neurotoxins-- partially inherited from, partially out of respect for her canon “fathers.” She graduated three years later, and transferred to the department of Mary Sues, though thanks to a time paradox her first mission actually took place several months before she was born.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even before joining the PPC, Whin had her share of mental problems. Easily bored and easily distracted, Whin seems to enjoy screwing with people just a little too much. She doesn’t seem to have a very firm grasp on how relationships work, finding “coitus ensues” to be a perfectly acceptable development, and has no idea how to approach a member of the opposite sex in any sort of romantic fashion. She has also developed a Silent Hill 4-esque attachment to her father’s tardis, thinking of it as her mother and occasionally referring to it as such. And that’s not even getting into the knife thing...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, in spite of her share of psychological issues, Whin is a very loyal and dedicated agent, and can boast one advantage: She genuinely loves her job. Hunting sues provides her with a (somewhat) healthy outlet for her violent urges, and for all the facepalming and mind screws being a PPC agent entails, Whin remains dedicated to defending the continua she knows and loves, and plans to keep defending them for a long, long time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First Mission: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5842365/1/The_Jedi_and_The_Hobbit&quot;&gt;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5842365/1/The_Jedi_and_The_Hobbit&lt;/a&gt; (Collab with Caddy-shack)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Writing Sample:&lt;br&gt;(Warning: Profanity ahead!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It had been six months since Meghan had almost died in that car accident, five since she’d stopped cutting, and three since she’d stopped smoking. She was currently trying her hardest to focus on her friend, who was still cutting, still smoking, and thanks to the car accident, no longer had the use of her legs, and trying her damndest to ignore the elephant in the room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, literally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;               Ever since that night on the interstate, Meghan had been seeing weird things. White blurs in the corner of her eye, weirdly pale people no one else seemed to acknowledge, and the occasional dream about people dying in horrible ways and finding their names in the obituaries within the week. And yet nothing, nothing she had seen could top this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;               Across the table from Meghan, standing beside Alison in her wheelchair, was an ethereal, incandescent, multicolored elephant.&lt;br&gt;               “So, yeah, it’s going as well as can be expected, I guess.” Alison sighed, gazing into her coffee. “Physical therapist says I’m making progress, though I think he’s just trying to make me feel better, and it’s a pain in the ass getting in and out of the car, but… Meg?”&lt;br&gt;               “Huh?” Meg jumped, snapping her focus back to the petite blond across from her. She’d been staring at the elephant again without realizing it. The hypnotizing swirls of colors within the ghostly pachyderm were easily the trippiest thing Meghan had ever seen, and she used to do pot.&lt;br&gt;               “Er, sorry.” Meghan mumbled, feeling guilty. “I’m the opposite of focused right now.”&lt;br&gt;               “I hear ya.” Alison sighed, taking a sip of her coffee. “Shit, that’s hot. So how’s stuff with you?”&lt;br&gt;               “Er, pretty good. Got a chunk of metal implanted in my spine. Scared to go through airport security.”&lt;br&gt;/I’ve also been seeing ghosts and having nightmares about people dying before they actually do. Did you know that there’s a magical, psychedelic elephant standing beside you? Did you see last night’s episode of Glee?/ Meghan sighed, shaking her head at her inner monologue.

            <p>I was finally able to sit in on one of these trope review sessions last night. It was certainly an interesting experience, but some parts left me a little ill at ease. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the majority of the process seemed to run along rather smoothly. But, from my point of view, there are two major issues.<br><br>CONTEXT - Sometimes the calls for cutting come too fast, resulting in something getting left out of the description. One entry was almost deleted for being &#39;too much about the badfic&#39; before I pointed out that it was an entry under the Fan Fic tab about legolas by laura that happened to quote the PPC. In the future, either more needs to be done to explain how entries might fit or more people need to follow along on the TV Tropes site itself, rather than just relying on someone quoting the page.<br><br>EDITING OF OPINIONS - Neshomeh asked me last night during a discussion about the Fetish Fuel Station Attendant page if opinions were to be considered sacrosanct. While I wouldn&#39;t have put it quite like that, I do believe that editing someone else&#39;s opinion for reasons of graphicness or unpleasantness is not appropriate. That&#39;s censorship. I believe that TV Tropes pages marked with the opinion header or that fall under Your Mileage May Vary should be left alone for that reason.<br><br>There you go. My two cents.</p>

            <p>I am not an experienced troper, so I can&#39;t claim to know all of what they consider opinion and what they consider fact, but we left everything on YMMV and marked opinion pages alone - you are entirely right, that&#39;s things that other people are saying, on pages that agree that these are things that people are saying.</p>

            <p>I have to agree. There&#39;s been at least one trope that I&#39;ve rescued by a timely last-minute explanation of why the trope fit. Also, TV Tropes rules pretty much state that you don&#39;t remove things from the YMMV tropes unless you put it up there yourself, though I haven&#39;t seen any of that going on yet.</p>

            <p>Both of those things are why it&#39;s a committee operation (and the first one is why KG kept getting angry when people said stuff before he was done pasting). Neither of those examples were actually cut, or even altered IIRC, precisely because someone spoke up and argued. That&#39;s how it goes. If someone doesn&#39;t agree, the group talks about why and then starts again.<br><br>On a personal note, it&#39;s more the implication of the wording in question than anything else that concerns me, and my vote was not for cutting that example, but rather for editing the oddly specific part. If someone thinks Lux is a Fetish Fuel Station Attendant, that&#39;s fine with me--and also, I get now that TVTropes has a policy about those types of pages, so thanks for pointing it out--but I still hope there&#39;s some avenue for us to strive to correct misleading information where we find it. I would like to protect the ability of newcomers to form their own opinions from the actual source material, rather than getting a wrong turn from the outset from someone who perhaps didn&#39;t think that far ahead. So, that&#39;s where I&#39;m coming from.<br><br>And, once again, I&#39;ll point out that the committee was swayed in favor of leaving it alone anyway. If you&#39;re still concerned, though, I think you can get the records of other sessions from Artell. What has been done can, in fact, be undone if need be.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The speed of this process has me a little concerned. What references were so offensive to have people up in arms? Who are the people on these committees? I (and others, I&#39;m sure) don&#39;t go to the IRC on a regular basis, so this whole process feels a bit exclusionary.<br><br>I&#39;m not a TV Tropes contributor, but I do consult it from time to time. Heck, that was how I got introduced to the PPC. I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t change things that appear to be over-the-top offensive, but such a process should be approached with a little more diligence. Haste makes waste, you know.</p>

            <p>Even Evil Has Standards:<br><br>One of the easiest ways to highlight just how bad something or someone evil is: have an otherwise-remorseless villain reject it.<br><br>Protectors Of The Plot Continuum usually do their best to save Mary Sues&#39; children, if they&#39;re not Sues themselves. They also seem to have a restriction on killing Sues in any way which involves rape - Agents Laburnum and Foxglove are responsible for two of these methods actually being banned more specifically (the Redneck Trees and Drip Tiberius Rat), and got in big trouble for them, though since the Marty Stus executed thus had committed graphic rape themselves they got in slightly less trouble than they otherwise would. In Laburnum&#39;s words:<br>&quot;I always thought that rape was the one unforgivable crime, and there was no way of justifying it at all. However, I&#39;m prepared to make an exception in your case.&quot;<br>&quot;So you&#39;re letting us go?&quot;<br>&quot;Nope. I was talking about your punishment, not your crime.&quot;<br>And then the Sunflower Official informs Laburnum and Foxglove that using the Redneck Trees as a form of execution comes under the heading of &quot;Going Too Far Even For The PPC&quot;. The use of historical atrocities such as the Holocaust as an assassination method is similarly forbidden; it&#39;s unknown if anyone has actually done it, however. Torture is also not allowed, and tends to result in arrest; torturing a Sue generally earns a reprimand, while torturing an agent can get one thrown out of the organisation entirely.<br> Also, HQ bicycle Agent Lux glomps and gropes anyone who stands still long enough, but the only time she&#39;s been seen genuinely angry onscreen was when she walked into a scene where the villain was about to rape his six-year-old daughter. (&quot;Mulla&quot; was adopted and renamed Molly. Possibly bringing her home wasn&#39;t the best idea.)<br> &quot;&quot;Fine, fine,&quot; Lux muttered. &quot;Snot like she&#39;s a real kid, you know. . .&quot; The words died in her mouth as she stepped through the portal and took in the scene at the other end. Mulla the ferretmaid lay curled up on Sawney&#39;s bedroll, shaking as the Juskarath chieftain loomed over her. She looked like she was about to start crying. &quot;Nevermind ...&quot;<br> One of Lux&#39;s recent paramours was seventeen, but they were - technically - in the UK, where that&#39;s over the age of consent (16), so it was okay. Or it would have been had they been of normally-compatible species, so as it was, age was the least of the onlooker&#39;s worries.<br><br><br>Improvised Weapon:<br><br>A creative fighting tactic used by unarmed people in any situation: Make what&#39;s around you a weapon. Even outside the dangerous environments, there&#39;s a lot of stuff to try. Anything can be used as a club if it&#39;s sturdy enough, and most stuff will develop a sharp edge if properly coaxed. For comedy value, go as wacky as you like.<br><br>Protectors Of The Plot Continuum does this a lot. Beating people with books is part of the exorcists&#39; usual modus operandi, as they need to knock the canon back into the characters in question. One particularly impressive example involved Agent Drake beating a victim to death with a dildo (which she had just finished using).<br><br><br><br>O Ring Orifice:<br>Protectors Of The Plot Continuum occasionally finds and mocks instances of this, as in one story where a guy successfully fits his penis inside another guy&#39;s urethra. And you wondered why Mary Sues must die ... Also, the incident in which a Plot Hole (which, in the PPC universe, are literal wormholes in which the characters the Sues have replaced are hidden for the duration of the fic) was found inside a Sue&#39;s uterus, resulting in a particularly disgusting scene in which she gave birth to the full-sized teenage girl she&#39;d been imitating. This shows up so often it&#39;s listed on their Charges page on the Wiki as &quot;Not There&quot;. <br><br><br><br>Rape As Comedy:<br>* Using rape in a disrespectful manner is officially disapproved of by the ProtectorsOfThePlotContinuum, but in higher-rated missions it has been used twice (by the same writer) as a CrossesTheLineTwice-type gag. Once, two &quot;pointless rapist bit-characters&quot; were executed by means of the Redneck Trees of Something Positive, and another time a  Villain Stu who did unspeakably Squicky things to the cute little animals of OverTheHedge was given to Drip Rat of the webcomic Jack in retaliation. The agents involved were punished and forced into therapy, but it was played for slightly-uneasy laughs onscreen. The same agents recently sporked a fic which featured the Narmful line &quot;There&#39;s nothing more painful than being anally raped!!&quot; It shows exactly how AxCrazy these two are that their first response, after they&#39;d stopped laughing, was &quot;Yes there is&quot; According to Agent Laburnum, a basic rule of fic sporking is &quot;any fic with the word &#39;rape&#39; in its title is probably going to be brain-meltingly bad&quot;.</p>

            <p>(( Hi, guys! Just a couple of ground rules to keep things running smoothly:<br><br>1. When you join in, post your response to the end of whatever the most recent post is, to keep just one string of sequential posts. That way it should be easier to keep track of what&#39;s going on, and thus easier to include everyone. When the string gets too long, we&#39;ll come back to the top and start a new one.<br><br>1.5 Don&#39;t worry about your characters being &quot;late&quot; if you can&#39;t get here until this has been going a little while. This is the PPC--Jenni understands that people can&#39;t always show up at one time. <sup>_~</sup> But really, it&#39;s just a personal pet peeve of mine, &#39;cause I&#39;ve seen it way too much in other RPs, so now it&#39;s just boring and distracts from whatever else is happening at the time.<br><br>2. Keep posts in past-tense. It&#39;s easier to read if everything is in one style, and it will make it easier for me if I decide to polish this up and post it later. {= )<br><br>3. No controlling other people&#39;s characters. Some may be okay with it, but I&#39;m not (unless you have explicit permission).<br><br>And of course, OOC stuff gets marked somehow, but you all know that. {= ) So, here we go! ))<br><br><br>The Really Very Tiny Auditorium had taken on a distinctly Potterverse cast in the last few hours. Granted, the ceiling only had a bedsheet-painting of a fairly generic cottonball-cloud sky tacked onto it, and the floating candles were battery-powered. The red and green streamers were nice, at least, and the single long table, draped with blue and set with yellow partyware, was laden with snacks that looked to have never seen the inside of the cafeteria kitchen.<br><br>The four adults in the room, two of whom wore Hogwarts robes and one of whom was a blue alien, stepped back from the final streamers and surveyed their handiwork.<br><br>&quot;You do realize,&quot; said the taller of the two robed people, polishing his glasses, &quot;that he won&#39;t remember any of this?&quot;<br><br>The other robed person, Jenni, folded her arms and tilted her head at Nume with an amused smile. &quot;Well now, I think we both know that isn&#39;t necessarily true.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You should hope for his sake that it is,&quot; Nume replied, sliding his glasses back on. &quot;Now, I &#39;helped,&#39; and if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m going to be in the stands avoiding the rest of the farce as much as possible, thanks.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ll be back,&quot; Jenni called happily. &quot;Even you like cake!&quot;<br><br>Without turning around, Nume pulled a large book out of a robe pocket and held it up in a display of how he intended to ignore her.<br><br>&quot;And he&#39;s your friend, is he?&quot; Agent Derik said. &quot;I&#39;ve seen friendlier watch-whers.&quot;<br><br>&lt;My partner is not a &#39;people-person,&#39;&gt; Ilraen said. &lt;But we are his friends, and that means he has to come to Henry&#39;s birthday party.&gt;<br><br>&quot;Yep!&quot; said Jenni. &quot;It&#39;s good for him. Now then... how&#39;s my kid?&quot;<br><br>She crossed to the far end of the room, where a fairly large area had been fenced off, the floor padded, and strewn with the few toys any one RC had room to keep. In the midst, the purported center of attention was chewing on the tail of a brown stuffed fire-lizard, happily oblivious to the strangeness of adults. Henry Rowling Robinson wasn&#39;t precisely the most beautiful child in the world, having taken rather after his father, Severus Snape, but he did have one or two saving graces. The first of these was a pair of large green eyes, clearly the mark of his other father. The second was an adoptive mother who loved him and made him smile.<br><br>&quot;There&#39;s the birthday boy!&quot; Jenni said, stepping into the pen and scooping him high in the air, making him squeal and giggle before catching him up again. &quot;Your friends should be here soon. It&#39;s going to be big fun!&quot;</p>

Kyle looked like he thought he was much too big to be holding hands, but Cali held firm when he squirmed. Deciding he&#39;d better behave if he wanted any cake, he stopped squirming and followed quietly.</p>

            <p>(( Sorry for not getting back to this sooner; I have been distracted. *shakes fist at RL and the wiki*<br><br>I hope you don&#39;t mind if I bend a rule a little to move through the group activity, since we all basically know how it goes. Fill in the details if you wish. {= ) ))<br><br>With just about everyone&#39;s eyes on her, Jenni hesitated. It wasn&#39;t as though she hadn&#39;t made speeches before, but usually when they happened it was the impassioned result of someone being an idiot and needing an immediate education in Jenni&#39;s School of Stop Being an Idiot. Deliberately stepping into the foreground like this was totally different.<br><br>Perhaps sensing his mother&#39;s discomfort, Henry provided a distraction by squirming and trying to pull his hat off.<br><br>&quot;Whoops. Nope, no, not yet. Gotta wear the hat, kiddo.&quot; She fixed it and looked back up at everyone with a grin.<br><br>&quot;Well, hi, everyone. Thanks for being here--I know how hard it is to get away. Um, as you all know, it&#39;s my son Henry&#39;s birthday. He&#39;s turning two, and this is his first party with friends, which I am very excited about. Dunno about him.&quot; She shrugged a bit sheepishly, as if to say &quot;kids; what can you do?&quot; Henry chewed on his toy and looked up at her curiously. The combination reminded her of something, and she turned to call up to the stands.<br><br>&quot;Nume! Stop lurking and come participate for a bit. This is mandatory party behavior!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not singing,&quot; he informed her flatly. However, he did set his book aside and come down to stand with crossed arms at the fringe of the group. Better to suffer a small dose of foolishness now than the subtle revenge the green-eyed woman would take later if he didn&#39;t.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll take what I can get,&quot; Jenni said, rolling her eyes. &quot;Anyway, we&#39;ve got a cake here, so I hear there&#39;s some sort of ceremony that goes with it. Uh...&quot; Shifting Henry to sit on her hip, she freed up an arm to light the two candles. &quot;So, here we go! If you don&#39;t know the song, make something up, I guess.&quot;<br><br>She took a breath and led off a round of &quot;Happy Birthday.&quot; Notably, Ilraen&#39;s non-voice lent an odd psychic undertone, and Derik managed to carry it off with far less difficulty than he&#39;d implied, though the crowd covered him for the most part. Not notably, Nume did not sing. He did, however, join the customary round of clapping at the end.<br><br>Jenni sat down in a chair in order to hold her son at a level with the cake. Fitting the event&#39;s theme, it was decorated with the Hogwarts crest. &quot;Okay, Henry. Blow out the candles! Blow!&quot;<br><br>Henry stared at the flames for a few seconds, then did his best and produced a slightly wet raspberry. Despite this, the candles winked out simultaneously.<br><br>Jenni blinked. &quot;Well now. You are your fathers&#39; son.&quot; She grinned and planted a kiss on the back of the boy&#39;s dark, fuzzy head.<br><br>&quot;Okay, everybody, dig in! It&#39;s Convenient Cake, so I know you&#39;ll all enjoy it!&quot;</p>

            <p>Ilraen smiled at the question. He actually had some practice answering it. &lt;We Andalites speak with telepathy. Do you know what that is? I understand that some worlds do not have people with the ability, but many do.&gt;<br><br><br>Having won the race to the ball, Henry seemed to think that was prize enough and sat down contentedly. He watched Helen try to bite it for a little while, though it was too big to really get a good purchase on that way—he would know, he&#39;d tried it before. But of course, one could never be too certain about these things. He left her to it. Artemis was causing a very interesting noise with the rattle, and Henry also noticed that he had dropped the toy apple. This was something New and Different, and therefore the most interesting.<br><br>&quot;Ball?&quot; he queried, starting toward it. It had certain ball-like attributes, to be certain. Further investigation was required.<br><br><br>&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about it, Ben,&quot; Jenni said, waving off the man&#39;s concern. &quot;You do enough every day. That&#39;s a great gift.&quot; Steering abruptly away from that line of talk before she could sound any more corny (although absolutely sincere), she indicated the large Warcraft Troll beside her. &quot;By the way, this is my friend Barid, though I suspect he&#39;s here more because the invitation had the word &quot;party&quot; in it than anything else,&quot; she joked. &quot;But, I should go around and act hostessy, so I hope you&#39;ll both excuse me.&quot;<br><br>Stepping back from them, she looked around for people she hadn&#39;t greeted yet, and decided to head for the food table.<br><br><br>&quot;Complex,&quot; Derik agreed with a chuckle. &quot;The records say I arrived in March, 2008, just before the lockdown, so technically it&#39;s been nearly three T—uh, years. It hardly feels like it, though. I remember fighting in the &#39;Sue invasion, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve lived for three years since then. Some kind of odd time-dilation effect during missions, I suppose.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Anyway, I&#39;m from Pern, though the fic I came from was a crossover with Potterverse. ... You probably don&#39;t want to know the details,&quot; he added, contemplating the likelihood that a &#39;verse native probably heard more than enough horrible things about it already.</p>

And you?&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>Barid clasped Ben&#39;s hand with a tight, three-fingered grip.  &quot;Pleasure ta meet ya, Ben&quot; he said with a smile.  &quot;Da name&#39;s Barid.  I&#39;m not exactly a friend &#39;a Jenni&#39;s, but we know some&#39;a da same people.&quot;  He looked to where Nume was sitting in the stands.<br><br>He turned back to Ben.  &quot;Ya got a good point about da numba &#39;a trolls in dis place.

            <p>&quot;Ah, yes, &#39;don&#39;t feed the trolls&#39;.&quot; Ben sounded dryly amused. &quot;Either the Nightshade has a grudge, or somebody&#39;s taken that old adage a <i>tad</i> too literally.

            <p>Stephanie reached the table and climbed up onto a nearby chair, not quite certain what to do now. Fortunately, before she could go diving in, Cara spotted the situation and came over quickly, giving all three children a smile.<br><br>&quot;You lot after the food?&quot; She found some of the paper plates and began filling them, one for each; her concern was mainly to prevent the little ones falling or spilling something trying to get to the food. &quot;What do you like, then?&quot;<br><br><br>William nodded understandingly. &quot;Crossovers are never much fun - I&#39;ve seen far too many things crossed over with Potterverse.

I... won&#39;t press you for details, though, if you&#39;d rather not give them.&quot; He gave Derik a sympathetic look. &quot;Not many people like to talk about the fics they came from.&quot;</p>

            <p>Cara nodded and just passed Kieran a plate. &quot;I&#39;m sure you know what you&#39;re doing then, hon,&quot; she said cheerfully enough, turning her attention to filling plates for Stephanie and Brad. Once the pair of them were satisfied, she sent them off to sit and eat quietly; she wasn&#39;t convinced they&#39;d do it for long, but at least they weren&#39;t the kind of kids to make too much mess with anything they didn&#39;t eat.<br><br>She set about getting a plateful for herself, but jerked back as something collided with her leg. &quot;Oi!&quot; Bending down and picking up the celery stick, she raised an eyebrow and lifted the tablecloth to give the two boys under it a slightly stern look. &quot;Can I ask which of you just threw food at me?&quot;<br><br><br>A rather big man, red-headed and with one eye covered, and a smaller blonde woman came into the auditorium, a sturdy boy of nearly five walking between them.

            <p>Henry reached the stuffed apple unimpeded, thanks to the other two being occupied with each other. It was soggier than he had expected it to be, but that didn&#39;t stop it from going straight into his mouth. On the whole, more like his fire-lizard toy than a ball, he decided.<br><br><br>Derik looked at the floor for a moment to cover the intense surge of anger that accompanied any thoughts of what he had to say about his fic of origin, though he couldn&#39;t stop his fists from clenching. By the time he looked up again, the fit had passed and he was smiling again.<br><br>&quot;Well, I don&#39;t have to talk about that to tell you about Pern,&quot; he said. &quot;Technically it&#39;s a colony of Earth, in the far future, but by the time I come from, it had been presumed a failure and forgotten about for hundreds of... we call them Turns, not years,&quot; he explained his hesitation. &quot;It&#39;s hard to break the habit.&quot; He went on to explain about Thread, which ravaged the planet every 200, sometimes 400 years, and how the early settlers genetically engineered dragons from the indigenous fire-lizards to keep it from devouring all the organic life.<br><br>&quot;There&#39;s quite a bit of history since then, not all of it pleasant, but essentially the Weyrs, where the dragons and riders live, protect the Holds and Halls from Thread in exchange for the goods and services we can&#39;t provide for ourselves--you can&#39;t farm in a burnt-out volcano cone, for instance, even if we had the time to spare for it during a Pass.&quot; He shook his head. Perhaps conspicuously, he did not mention having been a rider, although his perspective was obvious.<br><br><br>&lt;My home continuum is <i>Animorphs</i>,&gt; Ilraen answered Hannah. &lt;It is a science fiction series in which six youths use a special morphing ability to fight a guerrilla war against the invading Yeerk Empire. My people would have helped if they had known, but they were quite busy fighting the Yeerks elsewhere, and too far away to come immediately,&gt; he added loyally.<br><br><br>Naturally, Jenni reached the food table just in time for newcomers to walk through the door. She did spot them on a routine glance at the playpen, though, and happily waved them over before turning back.<br><br>&quot;How is everyone over here? Finding everything all right?&quot; she addressed the lot. &quot;Who&#39;s hiding under there?&quot; Seeing Cara bent over, she knelt down herself to take a look. &quot;Bit dark and cramped under there for two big boys like you, don&#39;t you think?&quot; she addressed the boys, backing Cara up with a raised eyebrow.</p>

            <p>Brad seemed blissfully ignorant of what was going on with the adults as he wandered off to find somewhere quiet to sit and poke at the selection of sweets and vegetables that had been put on his plate. The sudden cries from the playpen startled him, but the grown-ups seemed to have everything in hand, so he pointed out a quieter part of the table to Stephanie and continued on. After a check to see if she was following or not, he put his plate up and began trying to climb into the nearest chair.

            <p>&quot;Is that what it was all about?&quot; Jenni wondered, regarding the apple. Some private thought made her grin a mischievous little grin. &quot;Of course, he likes fruit.&quot;<br><br>Henry whimpered a bit at having the toy snatched, apparently unprovoked, which drew Jenni&#39;s attention from whatever she was thinking about. &quot;Oh.

His voice was noticeably trained, a clear, high-end baritone, but equally noticeably unused for the purpose for some time. &quot;Rusty pipes, I&#39;m afraid. Jenni demonstrated the birthday song for Ilraen and me earlier. That will be a challenge!&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Gets that bit from &#39;is father, I fink,&quot; Kestrel murmured to Jenni, smiling fondly at the toddler.<br><br>Artemis removed the toy from his mouth and clutched it protectively with both hands.

            <p>Vicky had decided to risk leaving Luke alone for a bit in favour of helping Owen get some food.

I&#39;ve never been much of a singer, myself, but at least the birthday song&#39;s pretty much expected not to sound overly tuneful when sung by large groups.

            <p>Ben gave another one of his quick nods. &quot;Sure thing.&quot;<br><br>The toy fire-lizard was easily retrieved, and he was soon handing it back to the young boy with a gentle smile on his face. &quot;Here you go, Henry.

            <p>Artemis observed Henry carefully, until he was absolutely certain the other toddler was sufficiently satisfied with his own toy, and thus wouldn&#39;t try coming after his.

            <p>Seeing everyone happy again, Jenni took a look around the room and made a decision. &quot;I think we can do better than doughnut holes. Off you go, Helen. Here, here&#39;s a rattle.&quot; She did a double-take at the teeth marks in it, but left it with the little girl anyway on the basis that she probably wouldn&#39;t mind. Sitting her down a good couple of feet from Artemis, she picked up her own child instead, toy and all, and headed for the table. Although reluctant to disturb the people occupied with plates of food, she decided it was better to err on the side of brevity, and ensure things didn&#39;t drag on longer than the little ones could handle.<br><br><br>Derik pulled a wry expression. &quot;To be honest, I don&#39;t know if I will take it up again. It seems this face&quot; —he gestured at his scars— &quot;comes with certain baggage in a wider multiverse. Although... I could do with <i>something</i> between missions. There&#39;s no work to do, and I don&#39;t know how often there are gatherings like this, just to socialize. Would you tell me about—oh, now wait a minute.&quot; He nodded in the direction of the table, where Jenni was calling for attention.<br><br><br>Ilraen thought for a moment. &lt;He would probably tell you to go away first,&gt; he confessed. &lt;Afterward, though, I am quite certain he would. Ah, but perhaps not just now.&gt;<br><br><br>Jenni made her way to the middle of the table, where a sheet cake sat covered. It was an easy matter to sit Henry in a chair long enough to uncover the cake with its two candles and fix an odd little Sorting Hat-shaped hat to the boy&#39;s head, and then lift him up again.<br><br>&quot;Excuse me, everybody!&quot;</p>

            <p>Stephanie had hurried off to put the present where Jenni had indicated, and then wandered off to locate other people her own age within the Auditorium. She waved to Miriam as the young woman entered, recognising her mother&#39;s partner, and promptly ignored the rest of the adults.<br><br>Cara flashed Miriam a smile. &quot;Wondered if you&#39;d wake up in time. Didn&#39;t want to wake you beforehand - I know how grouchy you get when you&#39;re woken up early, so I took Steph round to William&#39;s to get her ready.&quot;<br><br>William was looking around with undisguised fascination at the others in the room; his natural curiosity was at work already.

            <p>Jenni put Henry back down in the pen, where he contentedly toddled off to shove an inflatable ball around and chase it when it got away from him with the occasional shout of &quot;Ball!&quot;  His mother rejoined the adults.<br><br>Ilraen gazed at Agents Mal with rapt curiosity. &lt;Hello, Kaliel. I am Ilraen-Aroline-Fothergill, but you may call me Ilraen. I do not wish to be rude, but may I ask how you do that with your voice? I have never heard anything quite like that before.&gt; He spared a stalk eye to return William&#39;s look, while the other one kept tabs on everyone else.<br><br>Meanwhile, Derik turned his attention to William, since it seemed likely he wouldn&#39;t get a chance to speak to Kaliel (or Maeryn) for a little while, at least. At least William was someone closer to his own age. He didn&#39;t know precisely what that was, but definitely in spitting distance of forty, one way or another. &quot;Hi,&quot; he said with his damaged smile, offering a hand to shake. &quot;Agent Derik, DMS.

            <p>Once more, the auditorium door opened, admitting a grinning, green-robed female ferret. Trailing behind her shyly was a blue-eyed, black-furred fox cub, who was fiddling with the messy bow on his present.<br><br>Perched on Agent Kestrel&#39;s shoulders, his small thumb tucked firmly into his mouth, was the roughly one-and-a-half-year-old Artemis Crowley.

            <p>At the mention of the word &quot;host,&quot; all four of the Andalite&#39;s green eyes focused momentarily on Mal, the main two slightly narrowed, before the stalk eyes returned to roaming the scene freely. To his credit, although a certain racial intolerance for brain parasites had been imprinted on his psyche as part and parcel of his species&#39; heritage, it hadn&#39;t had the opportunity to properly take root, and so he didn&#39;t immediately say something stupid. There was, however, a decidedly lengthy pause when Kaliel stopped speaking.<br><br>For that reason, he only got as far as &lt;So—&gt; before Barid and Voltarmi entered.<br><br><i>&quot;&#39;Ey, Ilraen,&quot; said Agent Barid of the APD. &quot;It&#39;s been a while, mon.&quot; He waved to the Andalite as passed on his way to hand off his gift to Jenni.<br><br>&quot;Hello, indeed,&quot; said Voltarmi, as she eyed Agent Ilraen up and down... well, mostly up. &quot;Not so well muscled as the last time I saw you, more&#39;s the pity.&quot; With a blown kiss to Ilraen, Voltarmi went in search of something to eat.</i><br><br>Slightly dazed, Ilraen waved back to the pair of them before turning back to Kaliel. Maeryn. ... Them. He gave himself a little shake, scratched an ear, and tried again.<br><br>&lt;Forgive me, but you&#39;re not a Yeerk, are you? I do not believe any Yeerk ever bothered to differentiate itself from its host so politely, but perhaps things have changed.&gt;<br><br><br>Jenni intercepted Barid with a slightly worried look at his present. She had heard he was trying to get rid of a collection of shrunken Sue-heads at the behest of his partner, and one of them would definitely fit in that package. The raptors were nice, though. Well, creative, anyway. ... Were they wearing party hats?<br><br>&quot;You can put that over there with the others, thanks,&quot; she said with a slightly forced grin. &quot;Isn&#39;t Eamon with you?&quot;<br><br><br>Derik nodded at William&#39;s answer. &quot;Well, Jenni recruited me, and she&#39;s done her best to keep me sane since. Not her fault if there&#39;s no hope of that.&quot; He chuckled a bit darkly. In one of his abrupt shifts in demeanor, though, he looked toward Stephanie and brightened. &quot;Cute kid. One thing I will say for this place, it understands the value of a creche. It&#39;s a life-saver in an environment like this, or a fighting Weyr.&quot;<br><br><br>Henry, meanwhile, had captured the ball and managed to get a grip on it sufficient to carry it around, with a huge grin on his face at his accomplishment. He couldn&#39;t see Artemis coming, of course. A collision was practically inevitable.</p>

            <p>There was a quiet knock on the door followed almost immediately by the door being flung open. Two pale complected boys, the slightly bigger one wearing ripped jeans, a black t-shirt, and glasses; and the smaller one wearing shorts, a red t-shirt, and glasses burst into the room. They immediately spied the pile of presents and added impeccably neatly wrapped present to it.  An older darker girl followed, much more calmly. She was wearing green overalls and had a green bow in her hair. She put a diaper bag down beside the playpen and went to stand near Maeryn/Kaliel and Ilraen. <br><br>Finally, a young man with extroidinarily wild bright blue hair, wearing a PPC uniform, and green rimmed mirrored sunglasses entered holding the hand of a still unsteady girl toddler.

Luckily, this wasn&#39;t especially difficult, as she wasn&#39;t particularly hungry and her partner&#39;s daughter was easy to watch, but it did mean keeping a little apart from the others. Still, keeping an eye out seemed the least she could do, so she continued looking round, half searching for anything interesting going on and half making sure there&#39;d be no trouble.<br><br>Meanwhile, the steady trickle of newcomers continued, as a bespectacled man who looked to be in his thirties or so led others into the auditorium, including a DTE agent with black hair and a red beret, along with a little boy determinedly latching onto the DTEer&#39;s leg. While the Technical Errors agent stumbled off to bring his son to the play area, the  other - who looked like he could have passed for a Hogwarts teacher himself, with his robes and the way he carried himself - surveyed the area approvingly and headed over to Jenni.<br><br>&quot;It looks like your party&#39;s starting well,&quot; Benjamin Roberts said. The Bad Slasher-turned-Nursery worker shot a look to the play area and couldn&#39;t quite help a small smile. &quot;How&#39;s the birthday boy doing?&quot;<br><br>At the aforesaid play area, Bradley Kent finally detached himself from his father&#39;s leg, as the sight of people near his own age seemed to finally convince him to stop playing limpet. After a few moments spent squirming out of the DTE agent&#39;s arms, he toddled over to Stephanie with a broad grin.<br><br>&quot;Steffie! Hi!&quot;</p>

            <p>Stephanie had been watching Artemis and Henry rather closely, concerned in case they started fighting after Kieran&#39;s comment, but now gave Brad a huge grin. &quot;&#39;lo Brad! Been watchin&#39; the babies,&quot; she added self-importantly, &quot;&#39;cause he said they&#39;d fight.&quot; She pointed at Kieran.<br><br><br>William had hesitated at Derik&#39;s dark mood, trying to bring to mind a few comforting or at least encouraging words for the big man. He&#39;d seen a few moods like it before, and could never resist the urge to help.<br><br>At the sudden mood swng, however, he followed Derik&#39;s gaze and smiled at the little gathering of children. &quot;Yes, I don&#39;t quite know what we&#39;d have done without the Nursery; Cara and I were both so busy I doubt we&#39;d have been able to take care of her <i>and</i> do our work, back when we rescued her. I still wouldn&#39;t have regretted it, though.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;I didn&#39;t mean it like that,&quot; Kieran told them. &quot;Artie doesn&#39;t get into fights, really. He just starts them. Yesterday he pinched Molly&#39;s Noodle dolly and put it in my pocket, and she chased me for twenty minutes straight.&quot; A somewhat haunted look entered the fox&#39;s eyes. &quot;Twenty. Minutes. At a sprint. I didn&#39;t even know it was in my pocket until she jumped on me and dragged it out.&quot;<br><br>Artemis, who appeared to have been listening, gave him such a wide-eyed, innocent smile that it was impossible to believe he hadn&#39;t been behind the incident. &quot;Ball?&quot; He inquired.<br><br>Kieran shook himself and gestured. &quot;Ball&#39;s over there, guys.&quot;<br><br>With a squeal of delight, Artemis shoved the apple back into his mouth and toddled off in the direction Kieran had pointed. Abruptly he tripped and fell flat on his face, but quickly picked himself up and continued.</p>

            <p>&quot;I&#39;m sure he will, Barid,&quot; Jenni said, planning a speech to explain to the two-year-old exactly why he couldn&#39;t have it. She had really expected the Troll&#39;s partner to provide some kind of quality enforcement, but... &quot;Exchange program, huh?&quot;<br><br>She was about to ask for details when Benjamin arrived. &quot;Oh, hi, Ben!

I shall have to learn more about <i>Stargate</i>. Given the similarities between the Yeerks and your Goa&#39;uld, it would not surprise me to find that there are crossovers between our worlds.&gt;<br><br>One of his stalk eyes lighted upon Hannah, who had joined them. &lt;Hello, small human.&gt; His experience with children was limited to having seen them once or twice before, but he did his best to sound friendly.<br><br><br>(( We should probably start another string from the original post soon. Oh, and Pretzel, please reply to whatever is the most recent post in the string. Thanks! ))</p>

            <p>Artemis had been racing Henry for the ball, fluttering his wings in an attempt to boost his speed. At the sight of Helen holding it, he skidded to a halt, looking somewhat put out at being beaten to the prize. The drool-covered apple plopped to the ground. <br><br>Then, as though getting over his disappointment, Artemis crawled past her, retrieved the rattle, and bit it. The action momentarily exposed unusually sharp teeth, leaving onlookers to wonder how the cloth apple had managed to stay in one piece for so long.<br><br>--<br><br>Kestrel was helping herself to the contents of the food table. There were crumbs in her whiskers and a smear of whipped cream on her nose, but she carried on happily, licking up most of what had missed her mouth on the way down. She spied a tempting-looking cream puff on a platter to her left. As she reached for it, so did Kyle, and the two of them grabbed it simultaneously in an odd parody of Lady and the Tramp.<br><br>The ferret smiled down at him, exposing two rows of sharp teeth. &quot;Back off, young &#39;un, I saw it first.&quot;</p>

            <p>Brad mulled this over for a few moments, before nodding sagely and turning his attention to the other kids. &quot;Daddy says &#39;s okay to fight if you&#39;ve got a good reason,&quot; he said, his expression grave by four-year-old standards. &quot;Dun&#39; think a baby&#39;d have a good reason though.

            <p>For all you poor, wretched, clueless souls out there who have no idea what the subject of this thread is, Fill The Plotholes is a simple game of writing a short fic or blurb (that is good) to match the summary of some randomly chosen fic with a questionable summary that suggests it to be of dubious quality. <br><br>The rules are simple:<br><br>1) Reread it before you post it. Just because the story the summary is from might not have the spelling or grammar expected to pass an English class doesn&#39;t mean your bit has to be the same way.<br><br>2) People can write for the same summaries, so don&#39;t claim it and expect to be the only one. So just don&#39;t claim! Write and post it up!<br><br>3) Try and make it original! This is not &#39;let&#39;s spork the badfic summary&#39; or &#39;PPC mission extra light and with no added butter or transfat&#39;. <br><br>4) Make it as long or short as you want.<br><br>5) There is no rule five.<br><br>And now, for the summaries!<br><br>#1 Becoming the Creature<br>First Fanfic that i&#39;ve published.

Draco/Hermione<br><br>#4 A Whole Quidditch Team Plus One!<br>after harry destroyed voldemort, he and ginny got married and had many kids eight to be exact but what happens when some of voldemorts old followers try to rebuild their fallen lords empire and make another dark lord sorry story is WAY better then summary<br><br>#5 Dangerous Assumptions <br>Follow a classroom of high schoolers as they journey though middle earth, where things are in no way what they expected.

            <h1>10 Hogwarts Gets Sex Ed<br><i>Hogwarts gets sex education,and Snape&#39;s the teacher for the job.What could possibly go wrong- especially when the Gryffindors and Slytherins are supposed to take the class together? These are the days leading to it and the countless challenges.</i><br><br>The Potions classroom was under a gloomier cloud than usual that day, the day Snape would remember all his life as the source of his greatest headache.<br><br>The third year boys of Gryffindor and Slytherin were assembled in the dungeon.  Aside from the sniggering grins on Crabbe and Goyle, every face betrayed shock and revulsion.  Blaise was casting baleful scowls up and down the desks, as if daring anyone to try talking to him today.  Neville Longbottom, convinced that only a Boggart could be responsible for this situation, was frantically patrolling the room with his wand.  Perhaps the greatest sign of distress, however, was when the eyes of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy met, and the two exchanged a look of sympathy.<br><br>When Professor Snape strode into the room, fierce and silent, an uneasy stillness settled over all—except for Neville, who decided he had finally located his boggart, and pointed his wand at Snape, crying, “Riddikulus!”<br><br>Snape’s sour expression betrayed no reaction to suddenly wearing Augusta Longbottom’s hat.  “I’m going to ignore that,” he said, “only because this day cannot get any worse than it already was.”<br><br>As Dean and Seamus pulled Neville down into a seat, Snape flicked his wand at the wall, and the first image appeared, triggering a chorus of groans, feigned retching, and other sounds of disgust.  Despite these noises, the tone of his voice never wavered, nor did his eyes leave the wall in the back of the room.<br></h1>

            <p>Legolas is so depressed that he runs away and tries to live a fake life. Can his friends find him now that he won&#39;t look like himself? I&#39;ve edited and reposted chapter one so I hope its an improvement :<br><br>---<br><br> The Elf sprinted down the corridors of PPC HQ. &quot;No more Mary Sues,&quot; he told himself over and over. &quot;No more being made to forget the Laws and Customs of the Eldar. A new life for me.&quot;<br> During his stay in FicPsych, he had learned that he was often mobbed by fangirls or fanboys, thrown out of character, and then his memory wiped.  He had also learned of devices called contact lenses. They were usually worn to correct vision that was faulty even by Human standards, but sometimes noncorrective lenses were worn to change the eye color.  And nobody would recognize an elf with eyes of any color other than gray, right? Just to be on the safe side, though, he had cut his hair really short before bolting.<br> &quot;Where is the exit?&quot; he muttered to himself, not knowing the PPC . &quot;WHERE IS IT?&quot;<br> &quot;Legolas?&quot;<br> Legolas turned to see Boromir--dressed in one of the PPC uniforms, but unmistakable by anyone who had been in the Fellowship. &quot;Boromir?  I require your aid.&quot;<br> &quot;What happened to your eyes and hair?&quot;<br> &quot;I used blue lenses and cut my hair short.&quot;<br><br> Three minutes later, in the FicPsych staffroom...<br><br> &quot;We have a message from Agent Boromir,&quot; said Nurse Pablum. He&#39;s found Legolas.&quot;</p>

Harry was extremely curious as to why no one had thrown him out yet, or how he’d even gotten in here in the first place.<br><br>He only saw the Weasley twins, who seemed to have their faces stuck in a very uncomfortable looking split of amusement and mind utter disgust.  Harry took this as a sign they knew more about things then the rest of the people who all looked confused.<br><br>“I’m guessing by the looks on your faces, you two have something to do with this”<br><br>“Why Harry, we’re hurt you would think we would allow him into our most sacred of rooms” George (or was it Fred?) said while still keeping his eyes on Malfoy, though they both now had a small grin on their faces, which made them look even more ridiculous.<br><br>“Yeah Harry, why don’t you ask him yourself? He is here for you after all.”  The other Weasley twin told him. Harry was now even more confused, and began to reach for his wand; nothing Draco Malfoy could want with him could be anything good.<br><br>It was then that Draco seemed to break out of his trance and noticed him.  Draco rose off the sofa and walked over to Harry with an air of determination around him, he thankfully stopped a few feet away from them when the twins pulled their wands out and pointed them at him.<br><br>“I’ve been waiting for you Harry.” Harry wasn’t sure what disturbed him the most, the fact that he had broken into Gryffindor tower, that he had been able to, that he was here specifically for him, or that he hadn’t called him Potter as he always did.<br><br>“I can see that……” Harry struggled for something else to say, but failed horribly.<br><br>“They didn’t give you my message” Harry’s skin began to crawl slightly from the way Draco was talking to him. For Merlin’s sake, he wasn’t even leering or drawling!<br><br>“No, they didn’t. You might as well tell me to my face, seeing as I’m here.” Now he understood why the twins looked slightly amused, and how they even knew why Draco was here.<br><br>“I want to be your mate Harry” It wasn’t only what he said, but also the complete seriousness with which he said it that completely shocked Harry.<br><br>“My….My what!?” <br><br>“Your mate Potter, I want to be you Veela mate…NOW” He switched to a growling tone, and the last part was obviously an order.<br><br>“………” The awkward silence that followed was heavy with confusion, most of which was from Harry, who had a priceless look on his face, at least according to the twins. <br><br>“But I…that doesn’t even…..” Harry could imagine the effects of a Confundus charm were similar to this, as he was unable to even reply coherently.<br><br>Draco quickly stepped forward, and stood only a foot away from Harry now, who was now very scared, and for some reason couldn’t raise his wand hand, in fact, he couldn’t move his other arm either………<br><br>“Well Harry, you heard the man, he wants you to be his Veela mate, and I don’t think it is polite to keep him waiting.” Said one of the twins, who Harry now realized were holding his arms back. <br><br>“What!?…But I’m not a Veela!” Harry cried while struggling in their grasps. He began struggling harder when they both began laughing uproarishly, followed by a Draco Malfoy who was now starting to bubble and fizz, and slowly changed from the Slytherin student, into a very amused Dean Thomas, wearing some Slytherin robes.<br><br>“Sorry about that Harry, we needed a helper for a new invention of ours, a quick use Polyjuice, unfortunately it doesn’t work as long as we’d like, but we still though we should give it a test run.” Fred (he was almost positive) told him while still laughing.<br><br>“Yes, absolutely hilarious, very brilliant you two.” Harry couldn’t decide if he should be angry, or amazed by what they made, so he settled for both.<br><br>“C’mon Harry, you know it was great! Plus you fell for it way too easy!” Fred said.<br><br>“Yeah Harry, how do you think he would have gotten in here? Or why no one had thrown him out?” George added (or was it the other way aro-oh who cares!)<br><br>“And ‘Veela Mate?’ Now that’s just stupid, “Dean said while shedding the Slytherin robes, revealing his regular robes underneath.<br><br>“Yeah, I guess. I don’t suppose I’ll ever hear the end of this will I?” He asked them hopefully.<br><br>“Maybe if you’re a good little ickyHarrykins for us!” <br><br>Sighing and shaking his head, he headed for the exit of the common room. “Veela Mate,” he muttered while smacking his forehead.<br><br>`Caddy-shack<br><br>A little longer then I had planned, but I think it is okay for a first attempt.  <br><br><br><br><br></h1>

            <p>Here&#39;s my attempt. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve read the books, and I&#39;m a bit rusty. Feel free to tear it apart.<br><br>#4 A Whole Quidditch Team Plus One!<br>after harry destroyed voldemort, he and ginny got married and had many kids eight to be exact but what happens when some of voldemorts old followers try to rebuild their fallen lords empire and make another dark lord sorry story is WAY better then summary<br><br>The world spun and blurred, and it was all Harry could do to keep his grip on the Portkey. There were flickers of colour in the void, vanishing as soon as he focused on them. <br><br>Abruptly, the spinning stopped, and Harry felt his sneakers touch soil. His fingers loosened on the Portkey, and both it and his glasses clattered to the ground. There was a familiar smell of bone-dirt in the air.<br><br>He staggered backwards from the false Wand, stomach churning. The Elder Wand had been taken, and replaced by a transfigured Portkey.<br><br>He should have known better than to fall for the same trick as in his fourth year. He should have seen it. He should have known, but he&#39;d been too focused on making sure the Wand was safe after Xenopilius had vanished.<br><br>Ginny was going to kill him.<br><br>All around him, there were pale bone blurs. Figures stalked through the cemetery fog, whispering to one another. Harry struggled to make out their features, but could only make out their hooded, bright-red dress robes.<br><br>&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; he called, raising his wand in one hand. &quot;Lum-&quot;<br><br>Someone grabbed him by the wrist. His hand spasmed, and his wand dropped through suddenly nerveless fingers.<br><br>&quot;No magic, Potter.&quot; his assailant breathed. &quot;The Dark Lord wants to talk with you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Harry.&quot;<br><br>The man&#39;s voice was high and cold. It was also completely familiar.<br><br>&quot;Oliver?&quot; Harry gasped.<br><br>&quot;In the flesh.&quot; the one-time Gryffindor replied, moving closer. &quot;Surprised, Harry?&quot;<br><br>&quot;But...why?&quot; Harry finally spluttered.<br><br>&quot;Quidditch.&quot; <br><br>&quot;What?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lord Voldemort promised me unrivaled Quidditch skills if I swore loyalty to him. He came to my house the Summer before the Triwizard Tournament,. It was an easy choice. The rest of my team agreed as well once I raised the question. As for Goyle here, we keep him around to fetch lost Quaffles.&quot;<br><br>Harry stared, his mind in turmoil.<br><br>&quot;You can do the same. These dress robes aren&#39;t so bad once you get used to them. And with you as Seeker and with the Elder Wand, we&#39;ll have a team that will take the World Cup by storm.&quot;<br><br>Oliver straightened, looking Harry in the face for the first time since his arrival. There was an all-too familiar, maniacal glint in the older man&#39;s eyes.<br><br>&quot;So. What&#39;s it going to be, Harry?&quot;</p>

            <p>Do you mean, for instance, a nameless SW crewman who has no lines and might not even be seen on screen, or one that technically has a role but is so minor that they won&#39;t, as people have said below, be missed? If the first, is there any reason you can&#39;t just say that the agent was a bit extra in a bad fanfic rather than canon? Not that you need to, by any means, but it would neatly avoid the issue entirely. Just curious.</p>

            <p>My impression is that people got the idea that &quot;all bit characters lack personalities&quot; from the story I did about Ilraen&#39;s recruitment. He was meant to be a special case, because having a freaking Andalite as a throwaway character was particularly stupid, and we wanted him to have a chance at something better. There&#39;s no reason EVERY bit character recruit has to be the same--in fact, there&#39;s plenty of reason why they shouldn&#39;t. In most cases, there should be something worth recruiting in a bit character. If they&#39;re just a mindless dummy, might as well kill &#39;em or let &#39;em assimilate.<br><br>So, therefore, Sedri&#39;s idea would work. However, there&#39;s nothing wrong with having a character from a canon &#39;verse, if they aren&#39;t specifically a canon character--if people can get here from World One, they can get here from anywhere. There are plenty of agents like that.<br><br>~Neshomeh + $0.02</p>

            <p>For both Iza and Ketay, I just pretended there had been a badfic in which they&#39;d been bit or background characters and that they&#39;d been recruited for one reason or another; I assumed that was the norm, and that&#39;s the impression I was under for most non-Human agents. It never occured to me that we&#39;d be allowed to take bit characters from canon itself, but in retrospect I don&#39;t see why not - I guess I just prefer taking them from badfics since there&#39;s less meddling in canon, so to speak. <br><br>Rambling again... my two cents.</p>

            <p>This is why the PPC often recruits extras that are doomed to die-- they will NEVER show up again in their source material. If there is even the slightest chance of that character showing up again and playing even a small part in a canon work, I&#39;d avoid it. We&#39;d hate to cause a multidimensional paradox with somebody being in the PPC when they should have been in their canonical material.<br><br>If that&#39;s not the case?

            <p>KG&#39;s statement of &#39;extras&#39; in the sense that he&#39;s thinking of I don&#39;t think is precisely right, as we&#39;ve had actual canons recruited to the PPC who were major characters in their canon, the argument being that recruiting them at the point after their role in canon ends or just right when they are supposed to die makes them eligible since they are not going to contribute to the plot any further on a personal level.<br><br>What you&#39;re suggesting however, I take it you mean small minor characters from the canon and not a fic?  I&#39;d like to argue that this sort of thing can be tricky to explain away, since Star Wars has a universe with multiple levels of canon where even the most unexpected and most initially considered minor characters end up having their own personal and important contribution to make to the history of the canon and become main or secondary characters in their own right.</p>

            <p>Sorry about the ambiguity. The character I had in mind was of my own creation; more specifically, someone working in &quot;Artifact Processing&quot; for the Torchwood Tower. He&#39;d have been on lunch break when the Cybermen took over (Nu Who&#39;s S2 finale), and wound up jumping through a portal because it seemed better than getting upgraded.<br><br>So he wouldn&#39;t be on-screen or even technically canon.

            <p>Sorry, I&#39;ve not been up long and was trying to figure out how to put it, but something like that. And we&#39;ve had agents who&#39;re canon natives who&#39;ve held jobs that, canonically speaking, have to have existed. Either way, though, concern about character roles aside there&#39;s not been much problem doing so in past, though I seem to recall people getting tired of main canons being recruited?

            <p>There&#39;s lots of agents like that, sort of &quot;extras&quot; for lack of a better term. My interpretation&#39;s been that canons are more the major characters in a given work, while actual natives are technically part of the canon but not actual canon characters, if that made sense? With the &quot;canon&quot; characters being more strongly tied to the &#39;verse than the extras who nevertheless would canonically exist.</p>

            <p>OK, guys. I&#39;m fairly sure at least a few of you know a fanboy or two in real life. I know several, but I really am terrible at dealing with them. Beyond getting the urge to smack them around with a plank of wood, anyway.<br><br>Thankfully he&#39;s not very confident with his writing skill, so it will probably never get off the ground. But he will not shut up about his convoluted Star Wars AU where Obi Wan is not taken in by the Jedi, but the Sith and eventually becomes a chess-master-like figure that takes Dooku&#39;s place, drives Palpatine into hiding, and makes his own non-jedi/non-sith section of space, using the /entire/ clone army-- which he owns.<br><br>I am trying so hard to tell him that this is badfic, no matter how epic the storyline or fiddly the plot twists are, or how long, or how beautiful the complex political drama is... it&#39;s a character replacement for Obi-Wan Kenobi. Not a shred of the original canon character is left. Even if he wrote it, even if it was good, it would be a story about some guy who is distinctly /not/ Obi-Wan Kenobi, not even if he had lifelong divergent character development. You could name the guy &#39;Steve&#39; and the story would still go on.<br><br>Every time I try and tell him he&#39;s abominating a canon character, he rebuts by saying that I am just some kind of fanfiction conservative that doesn&#39;t believe anything but the exact canon can be good. But... it&#39;s fanfiction. You HAVE to at least nod at the canon... If it&#39;s mechanically and even workably good but one doesn&#39;t pay attention to the canon, it&#39;s not <i>fanfiction</i> anymore. <br><br>TL;DR: He is trying to make Obi Wan Kenobi a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaryTzu">Mary Tsu</a>. I am trying to stop him, but he hates the writing of 12-year-olds as much as I do and can&#39;t see he&#39;s behaving like one.<br><br>He&#39;s a bit of a fanfiction elitist himself and considers the 50+ chapter crazy epic fanfiction (canon-respecting or not) the pinnacle of writing skill. Also the Star Wars EU as the best literature around, which should be a *warning sign.*<br><br>DISCUSSION QUESTION: How do you deal with fanboys in real life? How does one justify that long doorstopper fanfiction with mostly ok grammar =/= goodfic? Are we as canon-lovers really &#39;conservatives&#39; in the world of fanfiction?</p>

Respect isn&#39;t the same as conservativeness, though; some of the best fanfics I&#39;ve seen have gone out on quite a long limb, but they&#39;re still on the tree, so to speak - it sounds like you&#39;re talking about the sort of people who jump right off the canon-tree and go swinging around on jungle vines like Tarzan. It may well be that &#39;we&#39; (and I&#39;ll use that term very broadly) are convservatives, and likely also in the minority, but given that about eighty percent of the fanfic floating around tends to be rubbish, who says it&#39;s a bad thing? If conservativeness generally results in good fanfic, I&#39;ll take up the banner with pride!<br><br>...Though that still doesn&#39;t answer your question, does it? I&#39;ve gone off on a tangent. Really, I just don&#39;t know. But thanks for bringing up the topic, because it&#39;s fun to think about.<br><br>(I have to admit, I had a plotline somewhat like that planned out once. It was even for <i>Star Wars</i>, though I lost interest in the fandom long before it could get off the ground - thank goodness. Maybe this guy will do the same. Maybe not. Here&#39;s hoping.)</p>

            <p>A darkside Obi-Wan could make for a very impressive goodfic, but I doubt he&#39;d end up a Mary Tsu, and that planned ending point is ridiculously out-of-character. Obi-Wan is just too hands-on to be an Emperor or similar.<br><br>Unfortunately, there really is no cure. In the example you gave, the best argument I could come up with is that that version of Obi-Wan isn&#39;t Obi-Wan at all, and that people who want to read fiction about Obi-Wan are going to be rather disappointed - but that&#39;s a tenuous argument at best.</p>

            <p>I encountered one of those this summer. In fact, I dated on of those this summer, until he revealed that he thinks that Eddiekins is the pinnacle of the male persona. And started talking about weddings. <br><br>But anyway. Yeah. His was a gigantic OC Twilight fic, with vampires so superpowered that they were ridiculous even for THOSE books. <br><br>I gave up on trying to convince him that this &quot;older than the oldest&quot; character of his was not, in fact, a believable character. </p>

            <p>Here in Chicago, we discovered just how crappy our windows and back door are when snow was being driven between the inside and outside panes of the windows, and just plain into our kitchen through the door, by the blizzard two days ago. We had to put a blanket between the storm door and the main door to stop it. We also noticed that someone who lived here before us actually stuffed newspapers into the top of one of the windows, so I&#39;m sure that&#39;s contributing to the draft we get.<br><br>Outside, of course, there are mountains of snow in the alley, and they actually closed Lake Shore Drive the night the storm hit, due to whiteout conditions.<br><br>For some reason, we had internet all through the storm (I was in the chat), but yesterday through just a few minutes ago it was out. *shakes head at ISP*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>But of course, I&#39;m in the southern hemisphere. We&#39;re all getting odd weather too, though - besides Cyclone Yasi, that is. It&#39;s been a very grey, wet, muggy summer. We didn&#39;t get any snow last June, either, so in a way I envy you lot, but given the sheer amount that seems to have fallen, that&#39;s probably silly. I hope it gets better for you soon.</p>

            <p>Please limit the repeat posts for showing badfic and claiming badfic. Out of the first five threads at the top of this page, only one is not directly badfic related. <br><br>While we are an organisation that is dedicated to fanfiction and the sporking of badfic, we also like to have conversations sometimes instead of being lambasting with only threads that are claiming fic or showing off badfic that no one is going to act on besides going &#39;oh, wow, that is a most terrible fanfiction, my good fellow! I dare say, I believe I feel by blood boiling just from the actof bestowing my vision towards the act of reading it&#39;s summary, by jove!&quot; <br><br>In short: Please guys, stop with the constant badfic threads when it can go on another thread that&#39;s already up at the top, it shoves everything else off and makes it hard to do anything more engaging than going &#39;MY EYES, MY POOR EYES&#39;.</p>

            <p>It happens everywhere.<br><br>I once was at a book fair that had a cafeteria. At the entrance of the cafeteria there was a sign &quot;no books beyond this point&quot; (so you don&#39;t smudge the books you haven&#39;t paid for yet, I guess). There were some people who had taken their books beyond that point. I remarked to them how brave they were to pick up books when they couldn&#39;t read.</p>
