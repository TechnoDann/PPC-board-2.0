            <p>What would happen to a contiuum where the author is very willing to incorporate elements from fanfic (even if they contradict prior canon), or even more so, when the author explicitly encourages others to write stories into the canon, and even state that there is no official canon? In particular, what manner of havoc could badfic inflict upon such a verse? I&#39;m wondering this because I was intending to write something set in such a universe (it is now in its own verse) and was wondering what manner of effects,good or ill, my story would have on the overall continuity. </p>

            <p>In fact, one of my agents was a character of one of these fanfic. That was some sort of cracky crossover (but after some time it became more serious) between the author&#39;s works and several other works, with a lot of OCs too. We wrote it as a roundrobin on the author&#39;s forum, and the author herself encouraged us to keep writing.<br><br>(It was an Italian fantasy book series, &quot;Nina, the child of the Sixth Moon&quot;. It has been published in many countries, but as far as I know it had success only here in Italy)<br><br>About the canonicalness (dos this term exist?) of the fanfiction, I doubt it as there were other similar stories there, most of which incompatible with ours. But in a way they were recognized by the author.<br><br>If I catch a badfic in that continuum (quite hard, as there isn&#39;t much fanfic about it) maybe I can play it out and make Nina recognize Agent!Sergio Turbo... and so the agent has another problem to deal with.</p>

            <p><br><br>I think that even if the author encourages fanfic, and there is no official canon, the things the author sets down and things that go along with/work off it/etc. are the things that are the standard of what &#39;canon&#39; would be there.<br><br>Meaning: if the author encourages fanfiction of his/her work, that written material... should be a fanfic of THAT WORK. Say writer A sets down Alice and Bob and says &#39;Go crazy, fanfic all you want,&quot; a story that renames Alice &#39;Charlotte&#39; and contains a Bob with absolutely no resemblance to his canon self... really isn&#39;t about the author&#39;s work anymore. I&#39;d call that sort of work badfic.<br><br>Badfic nearly always does the same thing in every continua: it gums up searching for good fic and it&#39;s kind of dumb. I wouldn&#39;t think this continua would be that special: just it defines &#39;canon&#39; a bit differently.<br><br></p>

            <p>I like to write stories - both fanfictional and otherwise - that play extremely hard and loose with the facts. Although it&#39;s yet to reach the level of incorporating elements from other fiction, the idea is rather tantalizing to me. The problem being of course that someone who can quickly produce terrible badfic is in danger of creating a major headache - which might itself be a fascinating mindscrew if viewed through the lens of abstract horror! (Or just a headache.)<br><br>For some examples, the Lovecraft Mythos eventually spun off to include many other writers of horror from all across the world - of varying quality, perhaps, but part of the reason it is so broadly known today. Similarly, the Wold Newton concept sought to connect through metafiction various individuals of some fame. I dunno if either&#39;ll help with your train of thought, but either way - good luck on your writing, and have fun!</p>

            <p>I was originally planning on writing my story in Lovecraft&#39;s mythos (it is now set in my own universe). That was why I asked this question in the first place, as the mythos continues expanding to this day by writers contributing more and more to it. Some of the biggest developments in the mythos have contradicted earlier canon (in particular, the Great Old Ones being beyond good and evil contradicts what Lovecraft himself wrote), and yet are still considered canon by many writers today.</p>

            <p>... who was recruited directly because of her PPC-useful skills (love/respect/knowledge of canon and insanity).  The PPC has a well-documented understaffing problem; generally, anyone they can get, they will take, no matter how they wound up in HQ.<br><br>I agree that the &quot;falling-into-plothole&quot; explanation is getting a little overused, but there are plenty of other ways for an agent to get into HQ - maybe they have friends who are agents, and on said agents&#39; vacation home they heard about the PPC and decided to tag along and join; maybe they have friends who are agents and said friends invite them in because it&#39;s the greatest job ever, you would totally love it, no really it&#39;s SO COOL; maybe they saw some suspicious-looking people exorcizing a celebrity on a real-person fic mission, and followed them back to HQ; maybe they&#39;re a new agey mystery-lover person who heard about a lot of strange things happening in New Caledonia, went to investigate, and found the entrance to HQ; maybe they saw a really weird ad in the local paper, answered it, and realized they had no idea what they were getting into... pretty much anything goes!</p>

            <p>The PPC pretty much allows anything if it&#39;s really and truly funny or thought-provoking. If it sort of &#39;follows the leader&#39; (for a lack of a better term) of the PPC Canon, then it&#39;s cool.<br><br>My human agent isn&#39;t literally from the real world, but was a self-insert that was &#39;from&#39; the real world... but her story wasn&#39;t finished. So really she&#39;s from an AU of the &#39;real&#39; world. The line between the real world and fictional versions of the real world is hard to say... I&#39;d even go so far as to suggest that NO PPC agent is from the actual real world as we know it, but are from AUs of the real world: fictional versions of it.</p>

            <p>There have been other methods of recruitment; it&#39;s been hinted at that the PPC sometimes puts adverts out in local papers and the like, and some people have met Agents on holiday and been recruited that way.<br><br>Hope that helps!</p>

            <p>Anne McCaffrey was the first sci-fi author I ever read. I have been working on a collection of all of her books for years. I know some of her others are not as well known as Pern, but the Petaybee trilogy is one of my favorite set of books ever. I love the brain ship series, except maybe The City That Fought. I liked the Acorna series, and the Damia series. I never quite got around to reading the Dinosaur Planet and Doona series.  <br><br>Of course I can&#39;t seem to find it now, but I am pretty sure that I looked it up at one time and her list of published works was well over 100 books.  What a wonderful contribution to the collective of humanity.<br><br></p>

            <p>Hi! I&#39;ve kind of been not here for a while, and I feel I should explain.<br><br>I got my Permission a while ago, but I&#39;ve yet to post any missions. If you&#39;ve forgotten about me, I&#39;m not surprised. I&#39;ve been very wrapped up in school and other writing, in particular an OFU for the A:TLA fandom. Here&#39;s a link for the curious: <br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6795085/1/Official_Fanfiction_University_OFUATLA"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6795085/1/Official_Fanfiction_University_OFUATLA">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6795085/1/Official_Fanfiction_University_OFUATLA</a></a><br><br>I&#39;ve been thinking about my writing lately, and decided it&#39;s easier for myself personally if I write things in order of how they happen. My character Karen DuLay, who is currently running OFUA:TLA, is also the character I intend to use for most of my PPC missions. Since Karen will not be going on any missions until she&#39;s done with OFUA:TLA (timeline-wise), I feel it&#39;s best to finish OFUA:TLA itself before I start writing and posting missions. In the time until then, it&#39;s likely I&#39;ll be more of a lurker on the Board than an active participant. I&#39;m not happy with it, but my real life schedule is full and I need to focus on OFUA:TLA for my writing and online activities.<br><br>Finishing OFUA:TLA looks like it will take some time, so I may not be able to do any official PPC work for a while. When OFUA:TLA is finally finished, should I ask for Permission again?<br><br>Also, would anyone like me to post updates for OFUA:TLA? It&#39;d be nice to get PPC feedback for it.</p>

            <p>Hi there! I just stumbled across the PPC wiki yesterday, and started reading the Original Series today. Since I really like the idea of fixing canon errors through interaction with the badfic, I figured I&#39;d get acquainted with the community. So to that end, I&#39;ll just give a brief introduction of myself.<br><br>My name online is KatonRyu, but my IRL first name is Thom. Why mention it? Because I&#39;m sadly not the only KatonRyu out there. I like reading and writing, although lately writing is more on my mind than reading. The best books I&#39;ve read are the Harry Potter books, which I consider to be so sacred I will never write a fic set in that universe...unless it is to set badfics straight.<br><br>My main fandom for fics is Pokemon, and nearly all the fics I write include shipping, which is either straight or femslash/yuri. I hate yaoi, but to each their own. I have a pet God-Mode!Stu called Ryu (who I call a Sue to piss him off), but the fics that originally starred him are long since deleted. Recently, I brought him back from suspension and set him free in the Pokemon universe, just for the fun of it. He&#39;s under control, which is well marked in the fic&#39;s title, so please don&#39;t kill him.<br><br>Lastly, I&#39;m part of a group of fanfic writers who call themselves Team Retard, mostly active as a group on the site fanbbs.net. <br><br>My personal works can be found at the sites below, in case you want to know more about me.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/~katonryu"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Ekatonryu">http://www.fanfiction.net/~katonryu</a></a> (The bio is slightly outdated, but most of it holds)<br><a href="http://www.fictionpress.com/~katonryu"><a href="http://www.fictionpress.com/%7Ekatonryu">http://www.fictionpress.com/~katonryu</a></a> (Massively outdated IIRC, haven&#39;t been there in a while)<br><a href="http://katonryu.deviantart.com"><a href="http://katonryu.deviantart.com">http://katonryu.deviantart.com</a></a> (Not many fics there, FFNet is my &#39;home&#39; site)</p>

            <p>Hi there! Thought I&#39;d introduce myself to a fellow Pokémon author.<br>I&#39;ve taken a quick look at your stuff, BTW, and I might just take a look at Mr. Ryu&#39;s foray through the Pokémon universe. The others are romance, which aren&#39;t my thing. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I have nothing against romance; it&#39;s just not what I prefer to read.<br>Anyway, hi!<br>(I said that already, didn&#39;t I?)</p>

So, if you don&#39;t like that sort of thing, you might want to give it a skip. But anyway, don&#39;t take him seriously. He&#39;s a nut.</p>

            <p>So, there&#39;s a particular author I&#39;ve seen around, who is known for writing insanely bizarre and violent fics. The characters are OOC and the SPaG isn&#39;t great. She has, however, also done some fics I think are pretty good, which are not full of bizarre guro. Is this just a case of me not being the target audience for her other stuff, or can I say the guro fics count as &quot;bad&quot; even if I like the other stuff? In case you&#39;re wondering, it&#39;s Hetalia fandom, and I&#39;m talking about the author of the rather infamous guro fic &quot;Debt&quot;, which is so well-known it has a TVTropes page.<br><br>This is complicated by the fact I&#39;m pretty sure a number of people would have a similar view of my range of work. I mean, I write both cute fluffy stuff and unspeakably violent stuff ...</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know anything about the author in question, but one possibility of the fics are spaced out in time is that you&#39;re seeing her older and newer work next to each other. I know I can&#39;t bear to look at some of my original and fan stories from even a year or two ago, let alone some of my very early stuff.<br>I&#39;d say that regardless of what you think of her &#39;good&#39; stuff, it&#39;s still fine to say that the &#39;bad&#39; stuff is indeed bad as long as it meets the negative standard for being counted as bad.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not the time frame that makes the difference, it&#39;s the general theme. The vanilla fics aren&#39;t bad, but she also writes some rather disturbing stuff which is also OOC.</p>

            <p>Did I just hear &quot;Debt&quot;? I only read one chapter of that and could go no farther. <br><br>I&#39;ve only read one other fic from the author (which was also disturbing in a different way, and also has a TV Tropes page), so I&#39;m not sure about the quality of most of her fics. However, I would not base quality of a fic on the general quality an author has. Some improve over time and write very well at present time but have some downright terrible fics from when they first started. (I suffered from this, for example.)<br><br>Tl;dr- Badfics should be looked at on an individual basis, not necessarily looking at an author&#39;s entire work (though often badfics&#39;s authors will write other badfics). Does that make any sense?</p>

            <p>...in general, if the gore is completely out of character for not only the characters but for the world as a whole, and if when you seperate out the gore, the plot itself is bad, or has more plot holes than an art film, then yes, you could legitimately spork the thing (see Cupcakes for a particularly infamous example).</p>

            <p>Um, hey there. My username&#39;s FourthWallPainter, and I&#39;ve recently come across your wiki. I&#39;ve already read the Original Series, and I must say, they&#39;re quite funny! I&#39;ve decided that I would like to help out in the PPC community, hence this rather lame introduction.<br><br>I generally specialize in cartoons and video games, particularly Mario, Animaniacs, Looney Tunes, and Disney. I have a faint understanding of the Harry Potter continuum as well, so I can help out there.<br><br>To be honest, I haven&#39;t written a whole lot of fanfic, so I probably won&#39;t be asking for Permission anytime soon, but I most likely will eventually. Just a heads-up.<br><br>Also, if you guys have the time, and if anyone on the Board knows anything about Animaniacs or Silent Hill, then I have a badfic that&#39;s rather ripe for sporking. If anyone&#39;s interested, I&#39;ll post the details ASAP.<br><br>Thank you for your time!</p>

He led a rather normal life before, his many weird quirks notwithstanding. His hobbies include reading, composing poetry, shooting pistols, and practicing fencing. He is a quiet person, with a dry sense of humour and a sarcastic and jaded view of the world. He is, of course, rather crazy, even if it does not show most of the time.

As he delved deeper into The Pit of Voles, horrified at the things he found, he became crazier and crazier. Once, he took a walk in a park near his home, and stumbled on an uneven flagstone. Normally, he would just have got a twisted arm, but, to his (mis)fortune, he fell through a plothole into HQ. After an embarrassing incident he does not care to talk about, he was recruited and partnered with another new Agent, Agent Caliban.<br><br>Lennox is a tall, gawky man. His hair is black, and so are his eyes. His face is round, and he wears rectangular glasses. He usually wears an Australian Straw Hat, a brown shirt, and jeans. He has an annoying tendency not to finish his sentences, and a Received Pronunciation accent.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5811848/1/Artemis_Fowl_and_the_Time_Lord">Badfic to spork.</a> <br></p>

            <p>I have to say, I like this permission sample better than the first one. It&#39;s way less purple and actually tells a short story in a considerable amount of text.</p>

            <p>Since I was told that there should be more concrit on the board, have some.<br><br>Yes, I said it was better. And it is. You managed to leave out the purple and be more direct in your storytelling.<br>Still... I don&#39;t know. Giving it a second/third read I found a few things that irked me.<br><br> 1. The story of this thing doesn&#39;t feel concluded to me. Dude kills the bandits and... uh. Yes. It was just a short scene out of something that felt like it should be part of something bigger.<br><br>2. The fight scene took me a few reads to get. You have a severe pronoun problem there due to having multiple males. I&#39;m not going to take on the fight itself because I&#39;m not that used to/good at writing fight scenes myself.<br><br>3. Okay, story crit time. So, we have the rider, dubbed Dude here. We start with him leading his camel onto a dune and taking a look in the far. He then sees something and mounts the camel. I&#39;m not sure why he can&#39;t lead the camel along for the rest of the way, or, alternatively, why he wasn&#39;t riding it all the time. I personally think that leading the camel would be the better idea if he expects bandits to be there. Fighting on camelback sounds rather shaky. I have been on a camel safari and I say they shake like hell. Also, there&#39;s a lot of stuff on that camel. The best choice would be to either lead it to the oasis or to leave it standing a bit away, go scout for bandits and take it there if the oasis is safe.<br>But okay, Dude rides his camel and, oh surprise, gets ambushed by bandits using the old breathing under water with a reed trick. Just under sand. I don&#39;t know how well that works, maybe we should ask the Mythbusters, but even if it doesn&#39;t I&#39;ll take an acceptable break from reality.<br>So, the Sandit Leader jumps out of his hiding place and demands... the camel. Surprise, again. Camels are so valuable, they used to be payment. Now we get to the fight. Dude draws a dagger. As said, I don&#39;t know that much about fighting, but dagger vs sword(y thing)? Well, fine, a sword restricts movement more than a dagger, but its reach is better. And, as said, I seriously doubt camelback fighting works that well.<br>The fight scene itself... there&#39;s a lot of dagger fu in there. I&#39;ll leave it at that, hoping for a dagger on sword expert to fill me in.<br>One thing did strike me as odd. &quot;For the wanderers of the desert.&quot; And no, I&#39;m not talking about this battle cry. I&#39;m talking about the fact that I can&#39;t tell if this is in character for Dude.<br>Anyways, the fight is done and dude gets to get his water and eat something. Then he walks into the sunset, never to be seen again. *plays the Lucky Luke ending theme* <font>THE END</font>. (Imagine this in a typical Western font)<br><br>4. I notice, I haven&#39;t talked about the depth of the story yet. Or rather, the depth of the characters.<br>I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s not really there. Dude is essentially a guy with a camel. There&#39;s not more to him than that. As said, if this was part of something bigger, something that actually defined Dude&#39;s character, it could work out. But as it is, he&#39;s just a random dude.<br>To be honest, I like the camel. The camel is cool. To me, it seems like each of the camel&#39;s answers is a snarky comeback.<br>The bandits, are, in TVTropes terms, faceless mooks. They&#39;re there to be an obstacle on Dude&#39;s journey. Again, in a bigger scope, you&#39;ve got to have some bit casualties, but for the length of this story, there should be more to them. 
<br><br>Le conclusion... *sigh* Yes, I said it was better. But yeah, it could still be better. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s nothing you can&#39;t fix with some practice, you&#39;ll get the hang of it.<br><br>Also, I wish for an edit button because I know there&#39;s something I forgot to say. &lt;_&gt;(Also also, if you allow comments to your document, people can comment on typos and other stuff.)</p>

Dragons would be more cool if so many of them weren&#39;t 4x weak against ice. Legendaries in general are also cool; I like cosmic nonsense and Legendaries lend themselves to cosmic nonsense.</p>

            <p>... from someone who wanders in vaguely every few months. :)<br><br>While I disagree with you on the subject of Tolkien (huge fan here - I&#39;m not in any other fandoms) I definitely concede your point: his prose style is not for everyone, so I don&#39;t think you need be embarassed about not liking it. Heck, I once tried my hardest to read Les Miserables and just couldn&#39;t get anywhere; it gave me a whole new respect for people who found Tolkien too descriptive. This is hardly a Tolkien-exclusive community, either, so I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re fine. :)<br><br>I guess you like Pokemon, huh? Is that your only fandom or are there others?</p>

            <p>I like (in no particular order):<br>Pokémon, Harry Potter, DC (especially Green Lantern), Marvel (especially Spider-Man), Artemis Fowl, Maximum Ride, The Incredibles, 39 Clues, Avatar: The Last Airbender (show, not movie, and I&#39;m not entirely through the series yet), Doctor Who (9th-11th Doctor), Animorphs, almost anything written by Tamora Pierce, and the Tennis Shoes series. There&#39;s probably more, but it&#39;s not coming to mind, and in any event, I think that&#39;s enough to be going off of, don&#39;t you? :)<br>Haven&#39;t read Les Miserables, but I must say, it does look rather imposing. At least with Tolkien, I get fantastical elements that are certainly lacking in Les Miserables. And therein, I suppose, hinges my interests: I like things unusual in some way, whether science or magic.<br>...I just realized I&#39;m rambling again. Am I verbose or am I verbose?</p>

            <p>About the only problem I had was that we don&#39;t get a good enough description of the Yatan to explain how feline creatures with paws can use swords and such, but given that such a description may have been forthcoming in another chapter, that may have been an invalid complaint.

            <p>I think there was a thread on here a while back, but I don&#39;t remember the particulars.<br><br>I have just discovered that there is an OFU for Portal. It does not give credit to Miss Cam, and it mentions the PPC with the following:<br><br><i>&quot;Are you PPC Agents?&quot; another girl tentatively asked. &quot;I heard they made schools like this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;…no, we&#39;re not PPC,&quot; Alix admitted. &quot;Katz and I are Freelance Plot Protectors. We didn&#39;t make the PPC. Next question.&quot;</i><br><br>Are people allowed to do this? Is this a legitimate OFU?<br><br>The main reason I ask is that I&#39;ve been hoping for a rather long time to be the creator of the Portal mini when I get Permission (since the Twilight mini has already been created).

            <p>Aside from them not crediting Miss Cam. That&#39;s something that should be mentioned, yes.<br><br>But beyond that, OFUs are first come, first serve, or second come, and completed. <br><br>We, the PPC, don&#39;t have anything to do with the OFUs in and of ourselves. There&#39;s nothing wrong with non-PPCers running OFUs. <br><br>And yes, of course it&#39;s a legitimate OFU. The fact it not ran by a PPCer does not change that fact. <br><br>Beyond that, the general thing with minis and OFUs is that the OFU gets the priority in what the minis are called, even if the OFU comes after the mini is already created in the first place.

            <p>And, last I checked, she doesn&#39;t care all that much about OFU legitimacy anymore. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s our place, at all, to take it down. And if they&#39;re not making claims about the PPC itself, we can&#39;t exactly claim they&#39;re treading on our turf.<br><br>Honestly, I&#39;d say leave them alone. It&#39;s possible (though improbable), that she doesn&#39;t know OFUs should be credited, or that she asked and Cam said &quot;Yeah, do whatever you want,&quot; or that she doesn&#39;t know that they&#39;re supposed to follow OFUM.

            <p>while OFU writers are not required to be answerable to the PPC, they should definitely credit Miss Cam.<br><br>And someone giving the impression the PPC makes OFUs... well, that&#39;s really not good. There&#39;s generally been a strong affectionate link between them, but they&#39;re separate and separately-run entities.<br><br>And finally, this person implies that these people are good enough to do the same sort of work as the PPC, but <i>weren&#39;t hired</i>.

I mean, they hired Luxury. :P<br><br>Personally, I&#39;d suggest we ask this writer to either fix her mistakes or take it down. :/ Though the latter is something of an extreme measure, I&#39;m aware.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m certainly not the expert on this, but I would think that would not be a legitimate OFU. They also seem to use a form very similar to those of the OFUs (they even ask if the applicant has heard of OFUs before, but cut out the question about the PPC). It seems that they want the fame of an OFU without dealing with having to be a member of the PPC. (Correct me if I&#39;m wrong/being too judgemental, anyone.) <br><br>Oh, and the fic is <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7130144/1/Official_bFanfiction_b_University_ASFES">here</a>, if people were wondering.</p>

I do not have many credentials to speak of, but as rule 14 of my page states, Canon resemblance is (one of) my top priorities.<br><br>If I do not, then may I at least offer some of my fan fiction works to be tested by whomever is the expert in those fandoms. <br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/845852/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/845852/">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/845852/</a></a> <br>I am no stranger to seeing badfics, having endured my way through some of them.

            <p>... I don&#39;t know where that came from.<br><br>Hi! I&#39;m Scribe. I&#39;m new. (My second name is Captain Obvious, by the way.)<br><br>I regret to say that I found this organization through TV Tropes while looking for legendary badfic to spork instead of doing homework.<br><br>Wait... I&#39;m not sure if that is actually a bad thing or not.<br><br>Anyhow. I also regret to say that I took your Wiki&#39;s advice and proceeded to read Celebrian as an initiation ritual. Without reading the summary beforehand. Please, please, someone hand me brain bleach. I only got through the first chapter before I had to go cleanse my brain with The Hobbit and some PPC missions.<br><br>Ignore my ravings, please. I tend to go off on strange tangents without warning.<br><br>With all that said, might I say that I am a fairly extreme Doctor Who fan, and the utter raping of canon in some of those stories that were sporked made me literally scream at my computer in a rage. Just... no. No.<br><br>Thank everything holy that I haven&#39;t read any Naruto fanfiction since xXxbloodyristsxXx uploaded Time Of Your Life.<br><br>I have no idea what I wished to accomplish with this rambling, strange, and frankly quite creepy train wreck of a post, but here I am! Brand spankin&#39; new, and already very slightly insane and bleeding from the ears.</p>

            <p>So, I decided to watch the series on netflix, because why not, and it did not take long for me to find a major flaw. Right there in the first episode one of the characters, ostensibly one of the good guys, is involved in a long sequence that’s supposed to be hilarious, about a spray that is essentially a rape spray, a super-roofie.<br><br>He goes to a bar, tries to talk to a woman, she wants nothing to do with him. He says he’s got to work in the morning and doesn’t have time to waste talking to her or charming her, so he sprays this stuff on his face that turns her into a sex maniac, for him exclusively. Ha ha, <i>not funny</i>.<br><br>Then they go outside and her boyfriend shows up, and she tells him she’s going to have sex with this idiot, so it’s not just rape, it also will destroy her relationship, and it’s all played for laughs. The boyfriend is about to pound the guy into oblivion, so the guy sprays another spray on his face, and the boyfriend now wants to jump his bones, too. Ha ha, titter titter, giggle, it’s even more hilarious now because it’s a guy, ha ha. Hee hee, he’s going to rape the guy now, too.<br><br>Am I missing anything here?  Does this ever get explained or redeemed? Because otherwise, I don’t think this show is for me.</p>

            <p>I took that scene as a total example of Owen&#39;s just sort of careless skeezieness, which yes, does get explained later on in the series and pretty much completely resolved and redeemed, but I digress. <br><br>I can&#39;t help but think that that scene was sort of awkwardly played for laughs simply to spark this question, this &quot;What makes people think that this can be treated as funny!?!?&quot; furiosity, because so often the mainstream media does play these things for laughs. But I&#39;m rambling again, and have added my two cents. <br><br>So, to recap:<br>1) Owen=Supercreep, BUT, he Gets Better. <br>B) Funny To Be Creepy? O.o?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s taken so long to get this up. Between the spammer messing with the data and the Thanksgiving holiday, I haven&#39;t been able to deal with it until now.<br><br>A full summary of the results, with shiny graphs, can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/gform?key=0AirxolPn-zgrdG5ZU1prVG1UTVdoYnE5LTFRUEJsc0E&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gridId=0#chart">here</a>—I think, anyway. If you can&#39;t view it, let me know and I&#39;ll figure something out. In a nutshell, though, the top results are, out of 44 responses:<br><br><b>1. Sue and Stu Pages</b><br><i>Of the existing Sue and Stu articles, should we keep all, some, or none?</i><br><br>- Keep some Sue and Stu pages! Sues are a dime a dozen; only the most unique or impactful ones need articles to themselves. (23 votes, 52%)<br><br><b>2. Author Pages</b><br><i>Are they useful, or just mean?</i><br><br>- Keep some author pages! Some of them are a big enough deal to deserve an article, as long as we treat them fairly.    (25, 57%)<br><br><b>3. Author Names</b><br><i>Is listing author names on wiki pages (including but not limited to the various badfic lists and Sue pages) a good idea?</i><br><br>- Yeah, I don&#39;t think it hurts anyone, and giving credit is important. (20, 45%)<br><br><b>4. Stubs</b><br><i>Is it ever okay to delete very short articles? (Note that this doesn&#39;t include just-for-fun articles that are intentionally short and silly.)</i><br><br>- Stubs of any kind should be treated on a case-by-case basis. Some should be expanded, some should be merged, some should be deleted altogether. (32, 73%)<br><br><b>5. Redlinks</b><br><i>Is it ever okay to remove links that don&#39;t go anywhere?</i><br><br>- It&#39;s sometimes okay to remove a redlink. They look bad, and if they&#39;ve been there a long time, it&#39;s pretty clear no one is going to make a page for them. (35, 80%)<br><br><b>6. Bonus Round!</b><br><i>Bonus question!</i><br><br>- Starfish! (12, 27%)<br><br><br>Most of the real questions got a fairly clear majority result (especially the Stubs and Redlinks questions); however, the leading answer on the Author Names question got less than 50% of the votes, so would anyone like to discuss that further?<br><br>Regarding the Sue and Stu pages, I think this result calls for getting together a group to look over these pages and come up with some criteria for what&#39;s worth keeping and what isn&#39;t. I suggest that members of this group should not have made Sue pages themselves so as to eliminate personal bias, and also that they should be willing to read the missions in question to make the best evaluation and/or improvement(s). (I think we can all agree that not all of the existing pages currently give a good account of their subjects.) So, who volunteers? I&#39;ve made Sue pages myself, so I&#39;m counting myself out of this one.<br><br>It might be a good idea to make a similar group to look over the badfic author pages, too. I think the biggest concern is probably that we&#39;re treating badfic authors like people, not punching bags, but it would also be a good idea for anyone who knows about a given author to be involved. Statements ought to be backed up with sources, and it&#39;ll be easier for people familiar with the authors to find said sources. Takers?<br><br>Finally, I am shocked, <i>shocked</i>, I say, that Starfish won over Hats by two. (Even though I selected Nitwit, myself.)<br><br>{; P<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;d feel that we shouldn&#39;t list author names on the wiki. I just think that if we list names in such a way, we&#39;d create some sort of &quot;wall of shame&quot; where people would constantly associate badfic to their (pen) names. <br><br>If I saw my name on a list like that for everyone to see, I&#39;d feel downright insulted: it would feel as if not just my work, but my very person is being targeted. I wouldn&#39;t like to have people pulling out some old shame out of the depths of the internet and wave it at my face all the time. Authors grow better as they learn and we don&#39;t need to keep track of their early attempts at writing which we consider bad. <br><br>I say keep it anonymous.</p>

            <p>Sorry &#39;bout that. I was thinking of doing it TOS style: as far as I can recall, there were no names and no links. Just the Sue. This method is probably outdated though, as the PPC has grown as a community and others might want to have a peek at the original material. It wouldn&#39;t make sense to list the title and link but not the author in the mission report. I think that the author&#39;s name just deserves a passing mention in the report, just like the way we do it now.<br><br>So in short: get rid of the author pages but leave links and names on the unclaimed/claimed/killed pages alone.  </p>

            <p>I am not too heavily into any one particular fandom, but I have enough general knowledge to recognize when fic authors have twisted their source canon too far. If I had to pick a main fandom, it would be North American graphic novels, particularly more &quot;literary&quot; ones (for example, the works of Chris Ware and Craig Thompson), but I&#39;m also a big fan of Scott Pilgrim. </p>

            <p>One of the Discworld books, I think it was Lords and Ladies, involves one of the characters being able to see into other multiverses of her life, and there is literally one for every single different decision she could have ever made. I agree with Calista&#39;s idea that it would just create a completely different universe of the combination of the two mirrors, but the fact that a new universe is being created might cause some issues with how aware the characters are in the original universes (and any others that might exist) of the combination. <br><br>Theoretically, this merged universe could already exist somewhere along the timeline of the Prime Multiverse and the Mirror Multiverse, and its own timeline could have started just as the combination took place. There&#39;s also the issue of the people in THAT universe knowing or not knowing about their being from two merged universes...you&#39;d definitely have to do a lot of explaining on those parts.<br><br>I don&#39;t think it would work well for an entire IAHF to be replaced by another one, because then you could get into the issue of where the replaced one would <i>go</i>. After all, OFUs don&#39;t just disappear. Would it get absorbed? But then you get back to the idea of replacement...maybe it would go into the void, that space between universes like in Doctor Who? There&#39;s a lot involved you&#39;d have to think about.<br><br>I hope the advice helps. Discworld novels do have a lot to do with different dimensions and universes being traversed or seen into or talked about, so maybe you could read a few of those (but there&#39;s a lot, so you&#39;d have to have a lot of time on your hands to read them all). Good luck with the story!</p>

            <p>I think it would create a third multiverse which is a combination of the first two.<br><br>A story is not just a single storyline; it&#39;s also the combination of all the possibilities that could have happened. Therefore, because you are writing a story about sets of storylines, your story is the combination of all the possible ways those storylines could combine.

            <p>Well, as pointed out below, it&#39;s recommended that you hang around for a while before you apply for permission. That said, there are a few other issues with your application.<br><br>Here at the PPC, our entire mission is to promote goodfic-- one of the most important things that separates goodfic from badfic is the spelling and grammar-- syntax in general, really. So, to put it bluntly, it would really help your chances if you proofread your posts on the Board for spelling and grammar before posting them. I is generally capitalized (unless you have an e. e. cummings style explanation, in which case I really, <i>really</i> look forward to your eventual spinoff, quite seriously) and so on.<br><br>Concerning your agents, it&#39;s hard to say anything about them, because the profiles, honestly, don&#39;t say much about their personality, which is the important bit. (Also, bit of a nitpick-- &#39;humanish&#39; is generally referred to as &#39;humanoid,&#39; unless you&#39;ve an actual species called humanish, in which case I stand corrected.) The thing that makes your spin-off worth reading isn&#39;t the age of your agents, or their guns-- it&#39;s their character. Their personality-- what makes them tick? How do they view the world, each other, the PPC? Do they regret leaving their home continuum, or look back on it with disdain? All of that-- how they tell their stories, how they live their lives... that&#39;s what we&#39;re reading for. Think about your agents-- imagine them in scenarios, meeting each other for the first time, reacting to their first Sues, and so on-- that&#39;s the important part.<br><br>Your writing sample... um. To put it bluntly, you really need a *beta. You&#39;ve got to work on your dialogue-- for example,<br><br><i>&quot;Yoyo have you even looked at this tag?&quot; Beat questioned &quot;This isn&#39;t some try-hard trying to pump himself up. This is quality work and besides only a rudie could reach half the places he&#39;s tagged&quot;</i><br><br>should be punctuated:<br><br>&quot;Yoyo, have you even looked at this tag?&quot; Beat <u>asked</u>. &quot;This isn&#39;t some try-hard trying to pump himself up. This is quality work, and besides, only a rudie could reach half the places he&#39;s tagged.&quot;<br><br>Never end a quote with just a quotation mark-- you want either the full stop or question mark at the end of a sentence, in which case the next words after the quotation mark should be a new sentence. (For example: <i>&quot;They all disappeared.&quot; She looked away.</i> rather than <i>&quot;They all disappeared&quot; she looked away.</i>) You can also use a comma, but in that case you need to be careful that you are not starting a new sentence. (For example: <i>&quot;They all disappeared,&quot; she said, looking away.</i> instead of <i>&quot;They all disappeared,&quot; She said and looked away.</i>)<br><br>You&#39;ve got quite a few comma errors, and you should have some sort of segue between scenes. You&#39;ve got the first scene, with the two main characters(?) viewing a tag, and the teenager watching-- then you&#39;ve got the group talking, and then the girl and the villain(?). There&#39;s no break between them, so it&#39;s a bit confusing to sort out on first read-through.<br><br>My recommendation is to go through and read the Original Series, and as many of the spin-offs as you can-- try and get a feel for the style you want, so you know what you&#39;re applying for. And be sure to proofread your stuff before it goes up-- a lot of times, you can fix those comma errors just by reading a sentence out loud and feeling where the pauses should be.<br><br>This is by no means a permanent deny; you&#39;ve got plenty of time, and it&#39;s absolutely recommended that you hang around and try again when you&#39;ve got to know the community a little better, and have a feel for what you want to do, more. Hope to see you around!<br><br>--VM<br><br>*I can&#39;t really offer to beta it right now, my life has just taken a turn for the crazy, but if you catch my on the IRC, I&#39;ll pm you and discuss things more in-depth-- grammar issues, anyway. I don&#39;t know that canon too well.</p>

            <p>We usually wait a month to get to know new PPCers before Permission is given. As such, you&#39;ll be asked to wait for that long until you&#39;re able to repost a Permission request. On that subject, I&#39;ve found a few problems with the request that probably should be rectified.<br><br>1) Inconsistent capitalization, especially when using the word &#39;I&#39;. It may be that you were just typing rapidly, but hitting either of the &#39;shift&#39; keys isn&#39;t all that hard, even when typing quickly.<br><br>2) There&#39;s not that much information about your agents here. What roles did they play in their original story? How did Percy get that handgun? What are their personalities like? Why did they have to beg the agent to recruit them? Usually, if an agent comes across willing and able recruits, they shove them through a portal to the Daisy&#39;s office ASAP. Also, how did they know the agent was an ally? Just because the agent was in a badfic doesn&#39;t mean that they can be trusted. <br><br>3) Your writing sample is good, but it seems rushed.

            <p>It appears my old question thread fell off the page after I posted a new round of questions so here goes:<br><br>What constitutes a badfic ripe for sporking? I can identify &#39;Sues, bad SPaG and OOCness from several kilometers away, but what separates a simply mediocre fic from something PPCable? Unintentional humour? Horrendous characterization? Something that is just so wrong it can&#39;t be ignored? I&#39;ve got my eyes on a potential Zelda badfic but I can&#39;t determine if it&#39;s something that deserves attention or not...<br><br>Secondly, do Spies have SEP fields? When reading one of Architeuthis&#39; reports, it is implied that Assassins are completely invisible to canon characters so long as they don&#39;t do something dramatic (because of their SEP field, I presume) while Spies need to be a lot more careful with disguises. I&#39;d like to play with the idea of a Spy always having to fiddle with a DORKS to avoid detection due to a weak/nonexistent SEP field. Can I do that?<br><br>Thirdly, is it okay if I update the description or introduce a cosmetically different version of an existing gadget in a spinoff? I say this because the description surrounding the Remote Activators seems a bit lacking to me: how can Agents get around on a device that can only hold 1000 combinations (using three dials)? I&#39;d like to give it a more practical design should I ever get Permission.<br><br>Thanks!<br></p>

            <p>What is the protocol for sporking trollfics?  Or at least, fics that we&#39;re pretty sure are trollfics?  I know some are funny, and many should be let slide because they weren&#39;t meant seriously - but what about the really, really painful ones?<br><br>I know that there is a Department of Bad Parody - Troll Division, but I&#39;ve looked there and there aren&#39;t actually any missions in it.  Other really really awful fics that were possibly/probably trolls (legolas by laura, My Immortal,  Thirty H&#39;s, anything by Squirrelking) either have missions written or forthcoming, and in the ones I have read they were treated like honest fics.  So... I guess is there standard procedure for these, or in sporking one should I just be extra careful about the charges, or what?<br><br>(The fic that I have in mind is <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7324877/1/Homestuck_high"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7324877/1/Homestuck_high">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7324877/1/Homestuck_high</a></a>, by the way.  Yes, it was probably a troll, but I want to KILL IT TO DEATH IN FIRE SO BADLY)<br></p>

            <p>As to the first: It should to be clearly and definitively bad. If it is unintentionally funny, all the better. The difference between something mediocre and something PPCable is, well, the difference between mediocre and bad. If you can read it without wanting to smash your head against the wall, or even enjoy it to an extent, it&#39;s probably just mediocre. Badfic, is, well, bad. It&#39;s got bad SPaG, OOCness, and stuff that just plain doesn&#39;t add up to the point where one or more of the elements involved utterly conquer what might be okay or otherwise excusable. <br><br>All agents* have flashpatches. The flashpatch is one of the two consistent items for the PPC uniform; the other is that the uniform is black.  The SEP field comes from the flashpatch. The thing with Spies is that, one can reason, while Assassins are there just for the Sue, Spies in comparison spend an extended amount of time in the field given any particular fic, in comparison to other field agents.<br><br>There are many different varieties of already existing gadgets in the PPC throughout many different spinoffs- I see no reason why it&#39;d not be okay to have a different version of the same gadget in the PPC. That said, I&#39;d suggest doublechecking with Dann if he doesn&#39;t comment on this thread since he&#39;s got the main general DoSAT agent who isn&#39;t a shared character.<br><br>*There is one group that use green armbands instead.  </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve also been having some problems on identifying bad fic where it&#39;s not absolutely outrageous - I was about to start a new thread, but since it&#39;s relevant here I figured that would be redundant.<br><br>I found <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3443347/1/Thats_Why_Im_here">this</a> (Warning: attempted M/M rape, NSFW) while hunting for something for my next mission. On first reading I was hissing and fizzing and thinking that this nasty thing needed to die, but I then sat back and asked myself what the actual charges would be; I do try not to target fics just because they feature a pet peeve of mine. While it does have the hilarious use of a canon character&#39;s name for an OC and genuinely confusing narrative on top of the aforementioned pet peeve, I&#39;m not <i>certain</i> it deserves to be killed.<br>With this example, what would be your opinion?</p>

            <p>Hmm.  I read it, and while it didn&#39;t make a lot of sense, used the Elvish language annoyingly, and was just kind of stupid (and Feanor?  They named the OC Feanor?  What?), I don&#39;t think it&#39;s particularly sporkable.  The spelling, grammar, and overall writing are fine, and amazingly for rapefics, it it really seems to do its best to not trivialize rape.  Overall, while not an actually good story, I think this is just sort of &quot;mediocrely bad&quot; without reaching the &quot;godawful&quot; stage that really requires sporking.</p>

            <p>Recruitment has been used in the past for a variety of characters but, in my opinion, some guidelines should be followed.<br><br>1) If the character in question could not conceivably be reintegrated into the canon world, then recruitment is viable option.  If they can be reintegrated, then maybe they should be.<br><br>2) If you have no use for the character in your spin-off, then maybe it is best not to recruit them.  We already have a fair number of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/NPC">NPCs</a> that are <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Free-to-Use">free</a>-to-<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FicPsych_Personnel">use.</a>  Sadly, many of the NPCs we have are overlooked in favor of recruiting a character or creating a nameless character for a one-off appearance, especially the ones in Fic Psych and Medical.<br><br><br>It occurs to me that we have gotten away, somewhat, from the practice of letting bit characters reintegrate into the canon world.  I don&#39;t know why this has happened, but I&#39;ve noticed a tendency toward recruiting every minor character and putting them up for adoption (though they never seem to make it to any of the lists I posted above).  I can&#39;t recall seeing many mission plugs, recently, that didn&#39;t have a recruit that the poster was putting up for adoption.<br><br>To quote a wise man, &quot;We&#39;re not hosting an intergalactic kegger, here.&quot;<br><br>This is all just my opinion on the matter, of course.</p>

            <p>Certainly in this case I wouldn&#39;t recruit the OC just because I would describe his entire personality in two words: &#39;Generic Rapist&#39;.

They run in, tramp mud everywhere, and brainwash people.<br><br>However, even if a suvian or sue-accomplice does some bad things, I think (and it might just be me, everyone&#39;s free to do it their own way!) if  they have the potential to  do constructive, non-trivializing things or have meaningful and deep relationships, they have the option to be recruited. Perhaps they just aren&#39;t fully realized as characters, or have been since glittered-over, or have been strung along by a possessing Suvian spirit... but for whatever reason, if they have substance, I personally believe they can be rescued. If it&#39;s not too late for them, anyway. I imagine it might be too late more often than I&#39;d like.<br><br>Mind you, getting a deeply imbedded glitter network out of them might mean a long stay in medical, pliers, fairy dust, strange machines that go &#39;honk&#39; every so often, the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary, and apocryphal applications of a rubber chicken... but eventually they might <i>only</i> have to take a single handful of enormous horse pills (Also available in wahoonie-flavored chewable tablet form) to maintain productive status in society! Or what passes for society in HQ anyway.</p>

            <p>1) What happened to Trojie&#39; and Pads&#39; missions? I get a notice saying I don&#39;t have access rights to view the entries when I click the links.<br><br>2) Are we allowed to add to minis things that are neither specified nor contradicted in the OFU?<br><br>3) At the end of the last sporking of That Series, chelonianmobile said &quot;I regret to say I have lost my copies of these fics in a virus attack, during which I had to clean out several files. Attempts to find them on the Wayback Machine proved fruitless. So all but “Among The Roses”, of which I still have a copy, have been lost to the ages, unless anyone else saved them.&quot;<br><br>I have found the original fics. Should I or should I not put links to them on the wiki page?<br><br>4) This is the issue. I quote parts the wiki article on Permission that talk about writing samples:<br><br><i>&quot;We want to see whether you can write well, basically.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Basically anything except a PPC story or a co-written work, as long as it reflects your ability to use spelling, punctuation, and grammar.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Permission is not withheld very often, but when it is, the Permission Giver in question should give you a reason (or several). The most common reasons, singular or in combination, are:<br><br>    * Having no idea who you are when you ask;<br>    * Ideas that really, really contradict the spirit of the original (i.e. Sue or Stu agents, SRS BSNS, mean-spiritedness);<br>    * Really bad writing. Not just a few typos, but horrible writing.&quot; </i><br><br>I&#39;ve seen several Permission requests (not mine) denied not for any of those reasons, but because the writing sample had flaws in pacing, depth of characters, &quot;no real development or change that occurs within the story,&quot; and other such things.<br><br>From the wiki article, I got the distinct impression writing samples were supposed to be checking that the asker knows how to use SPaG well so we aren&#39;t hypocrites, not how good he/she is at pulling together a complete short story with good characterization and whatnot. I&#39;ve definitely read official missions that could have done rather better at developing characters and pacing. What makes those writers so different from the ones who ask for Permission now?<br><br>I&#39;m getting a little stressed here. I know my own request was denied because of agent issues, and I&#39;m working on that, but some people have been denied multiple times for the non-SPaG stuff in their samples.<br><br>What exactly *are* PGs looking for in a writing sample?</p>

            <p>1) No idea. Sorry.<br><br>2) ...no idea. Sorry.<br><br>3) Linking is good.<br><br>4) This is why I&#39;m sometimes so hesitant to respond to requests. (SOMETIMES. Usually, I either see it and go &quot;Ah, I&#39;ll get to that later,&quot; not having the time at the moment, and then July or someone Ninjas it out from under me, or I don&#39;t see it.) Because I am terribly uncomfortable saying &quot;Yes, absolutely, go ahead!&quot; to someone whose writing I really don&#39;t like. Or, as July pointed out, who I don&#39;t feel is going to do the PPC any favors. (And here we all owe Nakkel a big hand for being the shameless troll that he is, and providing us with a perfect example subject.)<br><br>But the request isn&#39;t... doing anything wrong that I can pin-point. (I will say that, unlike what July says below, I wouldn&#39;t say yes to someone if I noticed a lot of SpaG errors.) So I just worry and think and go over it in my head repeatedly until someone else comes along and takes the decision out of my hands.<br><br>...I&#39;m actually not very good at this job.<br><br>It just doesn&#39;t sit right with me, stamping &quot;Yes Go Ahead&quot; on someone who I don&#39;t think has grasped A) the PPC, in general, B) writing consistently in character, C) syntax skills in English. If I can make good points and it&#39;s a clear Yes or a clear No, then fine. But if it&#39;s not a clear Yes, I can&#39;t just red-stamp it-- and if it&#39;s not a clear No, I want someone else&#39;s say-so before I go ahead. <br><br>So-- what I&#39;m looking for in a writing sample? Good spelling, good grammar, a style that doesn&#39;t crunch like a fancy cake being shoved haphazardly into a too-small box. A deft hand with the canons, and someone whose face I recognize from more than just &quot;Hi Newbie!&quot; posts and &quot;Hey, when going for permission...&quot; posts.<br><br>That&#39;s about it, really. Make sense?</p>

            <p>1) Trojie and Pads&#39; missions ca be found on a dreamwidth journal. <br><br>2) I am unsure what you mean by that, please elaborate.<br><br>3) You&#39;re welcome to put them on the wiki.<br><br>4) And as to your issue, you just explained it right there with those quoted portions. &quot;We want to see whether you can write well, basically.&quot; Flaws in pacing, a lack of depth of character, and no real development within the story indicate a basic inability to write. We- the PGs- are not here just to filter out basic SPaG issues. When your own writing has the same problems that we nail as being elements of badfic, spelling and grammar or not, it means that you shouldn&#39;t have permission yet. <br><br>I can&#39;t speak for the people who got permission who you think are lacking in characterization and pacing, but as Araeph put it in one of desdendelle&#39;s earlier shots at getting permission, PPCers shouldn&#39;t be just &#39;entry level&#39; writers. We need to know about writing and how it works. If we don&#39;t, we can&#39;t identify the unintentional humor that can be caused by use of questionable sentence structure and word choice. We also wouldn&#39;t know how to improve our own works.<br>se<br>Beyond that, there are so many spin offs now, that we should be trying to have better quality for new writers. What incentive is there to read their things if the writing is mediocre, and the only thing they have a handle on is grammar and spelling, and their characters aren&#39;t interesting, and the way they write is dull? There are other, better things to read, PPC or not.<br><br>The important element in this isn&#39;t Spelling and Grammar. If anything, that&#39;s just a surface matter. I can&#39;t speak for other PGs, but I&#39;m more inclined to give permission to someone whose story and agents for their request are legitimately interesting, and they hit the right spots as far as humor goes, know how to pace their story, or reveal or do <i>something</i> that makes me want to read more, even if their SPaG is off, than someone whose SPaG is technically perfect but has a story and characters that are the written equivalent of cardboard: Flat, without contrast, no change, tastes like cardboard, and soggy when wet.<br><br>SPaG can always be fixed, either when they learn it themselves- if they don&#39;t have any learning disabilities that get in the way of it- or with the help of a beta.<br><br>No one can help with the cardboard stories and characters, short of rewriting everything to the point where the original author&#39;s work is all but gone.<br><br>Beyond the issue of SPaG, there have also been incidents where previous PGs have also denied Permission on the basis and/or concern that the person who gave the sample would go against the spirit of the PPC on various items, such as lacking participation in the community or not getting along with it and its values (for example, if Nakkel decided to ask for permission, there&#39;s a higher chance of HQ being invaded by corgis than him getting permission due to his trolling nature that usually involves him bashing on things and people, which isn&#39;t PPC or cool at all) or trying to make the PPC grimdark, depressing, and utterly serious without the odor of humor to it at all. <br><br>Getting permission is more than just knowing how to write a sentence. </p>

            <p>As one of the examples (haha) I have to add that while they can be harsh sometimes, the PGs aren&#39;t out for your skin or something. They really care, and are willing to help. The best examples, from my own experience with them, are that DML went over my idea for a spinoff with me, and the RPG-ish thing that July staged a few days ago in the IRC channel in order to help me with my sample. So, even if they shoot you down, don&#39;t take it too hard.</p>

            <p>The Portal OFU says little about the minis except that they are Frankenturrets and tend to take on some characteristics (usually just eye color as of now) of the canons they are misspellings of. I get the impression they&#39;re full size as well, not miniature.<br><br>Examples: If one that&#39;s explicitly mentioned to be at the OFU were to pop up in a mission I did, would it be acceptable if I were to describe that the &quot;mini&quot; has a sticker or something on it saying it belongs to the OFU?<br><br>Another thought I had was that the name of the &quot;mini&quot; would be etched somewhere on it, mostly because of the sheer amount there&#39;s going to be in my first mission.</p>

            <p>To answer the first, the problem is that the links on the wiki take you to the missions on Livejournal. I&#39;d though I&#39;d fixed that by redirecting all the links to their Dreamwidth account for their PPC stuff, but I guess I missed a few or something. Their Dreamwidth can be found <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/">here</a>, and has all their missions, with the exception of the one Trojie did with July, and maybe one or two others.</p>
