            <p>Before I begin, I&#39;d like to clarify the subject line. In the PPC&#39;s &#39;official&#39; capacity as an organization that hunts down and makes fun of badfic, this is not PPC-related, no. On the other hand, in your <i>un</i>official capacity as a large collective of experienced and knowledgeable writers and beta-readers whom I know and trust, this has everything to do with you. Okay? Okay. <br><br>Alright, so I was going through some of my old original stories, and laughing at how terrible my writing was a few years ago, when I came upon a partially-written fantasy story that really didn&#39;t suck quite as badly as everything else. Oh, don&#39;t get me wrong, the writing itself still isn&#39;t even <i>approaching</i> decency, but the central concept and some of the main ideas strike me as suprisingly clever. So clever, in fact, that I want to try to continue the story. But, if I want to do that, some <i>serious</i> editing and cutting has to be done. I know that if I try to do it myself, I&#39;m going to be far to lenient, which is why I&#39;m coming here. What follows is a list of my preferences regarding beta-readers.<br><br>Let me be clear; I&#39;m not looking for someone who&#39;s going to painstakingly go over every detail, and inform me every time they want to fix a typo or something. I&#39;m looking for a real hack-and-slash, take-no-prisoners, McArthur-would-be-proud editing job here. If you&#39;re a person that can supply that, I&#39;m pretty certain you know who you are. If you have a busy schedule, without much time for editing, I don&#39;t really have a problem. I really don&#39;t mind if this takes a while. <i>You</i> might have an issue with that, which is something to think about, but I don&#39;t. Same thing with time zones. I follow Eastern Standard, but if you don&#39;t, I can certainly work around it. What else, what else...It&#39;s a fantasy story, but it&#39;s fairly high realism, so a firm knowledge of the genre is helpful, but not essential. Um...that&#39;s all I can think of for now. If you&#39;re interested in beta-ing or would simply like to know more, post a reply with your email address and I&#39;ll send you more info. <br><br>Thanks, <br>LHA</p>

            <p>The genre of &quot;fantasy&quot; is pretty broad. It can encompass some very opposite stories. For instance, is it a medieval setting or a modern setting? Both can be fantasy, but they require different knowledge to competently judge for realism. Perhaps you could give a short summary? I also agree with July&#39;s question; about how long is it?</p>

            <p>My apologies, I really should have put in much more detail. Plot synopsis is as follows. (Note; this is the plot as it stands now. I&#39;m planning to change a lot of this, so despite being WoG, it isn&#39;t set in stone.)<br><br>Ellis Damon is a fairly normal teenager living in Upstate NY. He inherits a grimiore from an uncle whom everyone else had assumed was simply nuts. Just for the hell of it, he tries one of the demon-summoning rituals in the book, and, suprise suprise, it works. In addition to the demons, there&#39;s a whole motley crew of other &#39;fantastic&#39; creatures hiding from humans in the modern world. Bla bla bla, wacky hijinx (Hijinks? Hijinxes? I could never get that right...), hilarity ensues. It&#39;s around 20 pages long or so, not counting the page breaks after each chapter. <br><br>Hope that answered your question(s). </p>

            <p>In 12-point typeface, it&#39;s 22 pages. Take out the page breaks at the end of each chapter and it&#39;s down to 20. As for time frame...? Hmm...Even with fairly sporadic work, I don&#39;t think it <i>should</i> take over two weeks. However, if RL problems arise, I would be <i>willing</i> to wait up to three months before I out-and-out said, &quot;Enough is enough, this is unacceptable, I&#39;m finding another reviewer.&quot;</p>

Eventually, she&#39;ll probably grow up and get her act together, and even if that is not the case, it&#39;s not something you should worry too much about. Your friendship is more important. </p>

            <p>It&#39;s a sad truth that writers are never going to improve until they&#39;re ready and willing to do so, and trying to push them only causes hurt feelings. If you want to try, then certainly, be as delicate as WhiteRaven suggests, but this sort of thing often turns nasty, and my advice would be to focus your frienship on aspects of your life other than writing, as much as that&#39;s possible.<br><br>My sympathies on having to read something to painful :(</p>

            <p>Personally, I&#39;d answer her &quot;I can do whatever I want&quot; thing by telling her that if she&#39;s any sort of fan, she&#39;ll treat the characters and setting with respect and try to do the anime justice. Tactfully point out all the mistakes and ask if she&#39;d tolerate that in a book she was reading, then respond to her &quot;it&#39;s only fanfiction&quot; line with what the FAQ has to say on the subject. Try to push her in the right direction with the fic, and if she won&#39;t listen, well..<br><br>...that&#39;s what the PPC is for.</p>

            <p>Or is it a fundamental writing problem? You might be able to convince her to improve her writing by ignoring the OOC and canon issues and focusing on the technical problems of her writing since those transfer more clearly to her other work. </p>

            <p>I just skimmed over it, and I have to say, that looks pretty bad. I don&#39;t even know the canon, either. Just...the writing itself (everything you mentioned). Wow.<br><br>Well, if you&#39;re really bothered by it and feel like you should talk to your friend about it, then I&#39;d say to just phrase everything very...delicately. You don&#39;t want to ruin a friendship over bad writing, right? Perhaps you can suggest she get a beta or offer to give her some pointers? If she&#39;s one of those people who believes that her writing is God&#39;s gift to the world, though, it may just be better to leave her be and not bring it up. Spork it if you&#39;d like, or don&#39;t. It all comes down to whether or not you want to push the issue with her (and how well would she take it).<br><br>Sorry I don&#39;t have better advice.</p>

            <p>BUT, before you start writing, I&#39;d like to see the other two components we ask for in a Permission request - namely, a link to the badfic you&#39;d like to tackle as your first mission and your agent bios (/character summaries). Looking way way back, I found short versions in your previous request, but it seems you&#39;ve completely overhauled ???/Lanyon/Bob since then, so I&#39;d like to see new ones, please. <br><br>I was a bit concerned to see that you haven&#39;t posted much on the Board since making your last request, but going back a few pages, I see you were active enough before that, and I trust you won&#39;t stop coming here and chatting from now on, so no worries. <br><br>That said, I loved your writing sample! I wasn&#39;t active when you made your last request and don&#39;t know what that version looked like, but you&#39;ve clearly taken the advice you were given and the result is lovely. The humour is subtle and well constructed, and the two agents play off each other beautifully - &quot;Bob&quot;, indeed! They&#39;re endearing, both of them, and should be great fun to see in active missions. <br><br>As a side note, I do hope you won&#39;t keep referring to him as <i>Lanyon/Bob</i> in narration - perhaps just &quot;Lanyon&quot; for narration, and restrict &quot;Bob&quot; to Karen&#39;s dialogue? IF you make it clear that she&#39;s trying to annoy him, that should make things clear enough to any reader without losing your meaning. <br><br>Also, are you aiming for an omniscient third person point-of-view here? Sometimes we&#39;re in Lanyon&#39;s head and sometimes in Karen&#39;s, and while I freely admit I didn&#39;t even notice the first time I read through this, it&#39;s a rather important point to keep in mind as you write. <br><br>Aside from that, you&#39;ve got a few small things that I&#39;d pick on if I were your beta (no offense to Anjilly - she&#39;s done a great job), but nothing that warrants being pointed out here. If you write all your missions to this kind of standard, they should be very good indeed. <br><br>Congratulations :)</p>

            <p>First, here&#39;s my badfic link: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5763760/1/Kiayas_Journey"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5763760/1/Kiayas_Journey">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5763760/1/Kiayas_Journey</a></a><br><br>It&#39;s fairly long, and I think it&#39;d be a good way to help my agents get to know each other. I&#39;ve had my eye on it for months, so I have a bunch of ideas already.<br><br>As for my agents, here are some bios:<br><br>Agent ???/Lanyon: A very uptight, clean young man. His last partner left the PPC for unknown reasons, and he isn&#39;t talking about it. Places a high value on preparedness and orderliness, and enjoys cleanliness above all else. Possibly thinks a little too highly of himself, but the Flowers have taken care to assign him a partner that should dispel his arrogance. Original world unknown, but assumed to have been a particularly bad original story. He has a vicious hatred of Mary Sues, though he never tells anyone why. Tries to maintain an Air of Mysteriousness, mostly fails with his new partner. Approves of Karen&#39;s oven, but hopes she will clean it biweekly.<br><br>Agent Karen Elaine DuLay: Recruited after her graduation from IAHF, spent more time in training than usual due to her cookie obsession (Karen: &quot;Cookie obsession? What cookie obsession? I don&#39;t have a cookie obsession!&quot;), which she is in denial of. Headed the Official Fanfiction University of Avatar: The Last Airbender with the help of Anjilly Ka, and prefers to work in that fandom if possible (Karen: &quot;But totally not because of Zuko. Nope.&quot;). Occasionally hears things wrong--totally not on purpose--and can be somewhat impulsive. Enjoys the thought of roasting Sues in an old-fashioned oven, and isn&#39;t much concerned with the remains. Tends to forget to bring anything other than her cookies with her on missions, leaving her partner to pack for both of them. The only large project she has begun and finished is her oven: otherwise, she will start something, be excited with it for a while, then completely forget it and leave her partner to pick up after her.<br><br>That appears to be all. I&#39;ll keep your comments in mind.</p>

            <p>*waves* Hey, guys.<br><br>Okay, um... I know most of you like sporkings, but I&#39;ve still been hesitating about posting this one for quite some time. The reason? The fic I tackled is bad. Not just bad, <i>Bad</i>. Seriously, it&#39;s like <i>C*l*br**n</i> met <i>My Immortal</i> met <i>legolas by laura</i>, and the three of them got fused together into one horrendous badfic conglomeration. It features, among many, many other things:<br><br>so many canon violations that I could hardly keep track, mangling of the English language so bad that it makes you want to hit yourself with a dictionary, complete ignorance of basic biology, complete ignorance of basic <i>reality</i>, terrible, vomit-worthy yiffy sex between a &quot;human&quot; and a &quot;xenomorph&quot; (and yes, these quotes are necessary), outright bestiality, logic black holes, so many different fandoms randomly thrown in there that I literally lost count about halfway through, rampant OOCness, mawwiage, implied Mpreg (I <i>think</i>), pronoun confusion extraordinaire, and... and...<br><br>Ah, I could name everything, but I&#39;d use up the maximum post length. Suffice it to say that this thing? Is NSFB and NSFW <i>to the extreme</i>. Unless you have an iron constitution - not to mention an iron stomach - do not, repeat, <i>not</i> click the following link. This is rated NC-17 at <i>least</i>. You may think I&#39;m exaggerating, or treating you guys like kids, but I seriously am not.<br><br>However, if you are foolhardy, here&#39;s the link. Just make sure you don&#39;t have food in your mouth if you click it.

            <p>OK, I just read your entire sporking (and strangely can&#39;t do long division anymore. Possibly related) and I can clear up some of the stranger parts. In the horrible orgiastic mess of fandoms here collected, one of the ones the author-creature is leaning on most heavily for source material is Warhammer 40K.<br><br><a href="http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Main_Page"><a href="http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Main_Page">http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Main_Page</a></a> <br>Interestingly enough, 40K does have a character called &quot;Abaddon the Despoiler,&quot; the Warmaster of Chaos. Being a genetically engineered super-duper soldier, assuming that he&#39;s actually the main character makes this story almost 2.6% less insane.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad Piper will be looked after. Being a Sue doesn&#39;t exactly come with practical knowledge of how to take care of yourself, does it?<br><br>Stuff I noticed:<br><br>1. I&#39;m not sure how &quot;Thranduil for the short time formality stands between us&quot; is a mini. Looks like a missing comma rather than a misspelling to me, like the Long Table Elrond from OFUM.<br><br>2. There were a few times I would have liked to see a quote from the fic to go with the silly shenanigans, like when Legolas was being a wig. How did that happen?<br><br>3. It&#39;s awkward dealing with a chapter heading as part of a sentence, especially when the normal line picks up with a capital letter, like with this one:<blockquote>The Shadow<br>Ch 7<br>Dwarves<br><br>Skidded over head, narrowly missing Piper, again.</blockquote>I think formatting it differently might help. Maybe, &quot;The heading for chapter seven, &#39;Dwarves,&#39; skidded overhead, narrowly missing Piper again.&quot; You already demonstrated what the headers look like, so the reader should be able to visualize it at this point.<br><br>That&#39;s it for nitpicks. I always enjoy the serious character development you do in your missions while also keeping the humorous elements in play. Also, Farawen is awesome. She seems to be getting along well in HQ. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Okay. I&#39;ve fixed the awkward chapter heading thing, at least in that one place, and added in at least a couple more shenanigan-quotes... <br><br>As for Thranduil (etc. etc.), I tossed that out into the IRC a couple times going &quot;dafuq is this?&quot; and the consensus was that he was a Mini, so that&#39;s what I went with, since there was nothing else that would really be functional. :/ </p>

            <p>Hello there, PPC!  I stumbled across the PPC entry on TVTropes a few weeks ago and have spent my time since then eagerly devouring as many stories as I could.  You folks are both brilliant and hilarious, and I&#39;ve enjoyed every minute of your badfic-induced pain and suffering.  As I&#39;m awkward at introductions I think I&#39;ll just stop here for now with a <a href="http://www.gabbysplayhouse.com/wp-content/usualsuspects/newkid.jpg">graphical representation of me</a>.</p>

            <p>And the gifts!  Chocolate and weapons and bleepka (mmm, bleepka), hooray!  Answering a few questions...<br><br>I don&#39;t remember which TVTropes article it was.  I think it was on the &quot;TVTropes Will Enhance Your Life&quot; page that lists different fandoms people recommended or discovered through the site.  I&#39;m not one hundred percent sure though.<br><br>I mentioned some of my fandoms in an early reply, but I&#39;ll be a bit more extensive here.  Video Game fandoms: Halo, Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo, Elder Scrolls, Gears of War, Fable, Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy VII and X, and the Half-Life-verse.  Literary &amp; Movie fandoms: Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Narnia, His Dark Materials, The Wheel of Time, Harry Potter, Crosstime Traffic and Southern Victory Series (both by Harry Turtledove), Firestar (title of the first book of a four book series by Michael Flynn), the Tortall-verse from Tamora Pierce, and the Foundation-verse.  TV fandoms: Lost, House, and Futurama.  Web Original fandoms: Red vs. Blue, Tales of MU, the Whately Academy-verse, and of course the Protectors of the Plot Continuum.<br><br>My exposure to fanfiction has actually been almost non-existent over the years.  The closest I&#39;ve come has been Red vs. Blue and some (generally good) video game webcomics.  Over the last month I&#39;ve seen quite a few thanks to the missions and MSTs done by Agents.  I&#39;m feeling some dread over the possible creation of a pair of agents of my own, since I&#39;ll have to actually read the fanfiction without the catharsis provided by other Agents fixing/mocking it.  It&#39;s probably inevitable because I do have a bit of a morbid fascination with badfic; it&#39;s why I read the entire Twilight series after seeing a few comics/shorters/MSTs of it.  Ah well, Bleep products will fix the mental scarring, right?  Right??</p>

            <p>I&#39;m most interested/knowledgeable in the Halo and Warcraft fandoms.  I also really enjoy Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter (So excited about the midnight movie premier tonight!), Star Wars (excluding the Expanded Universe), Starcraft, Dune, Legend of Zelda, Wheel of Time, Gears of War, Fable, the Elder Scrolls, a couple of the Final Fantasies... nothing else comes immediately to mind.  Fandoms that I&#39;m thinking of getting back into, thanks to some of the PPC agents&#39; mission reports, include Redwall and the Tortall-verse.  Any other recommendations are welcome!</p>

            <p>I think that&#39;s a wonderful idea! And Firebird is right, there&#39;s a lot of opportunity for conflict/comedy just in the nature of the relationship, let alone any clashing personalities/quirks they might have. I&#39;d say go for it if it&#39;s what you want to do! :D<br><br>As far as I can tell, anyone can be partners with anything as long as they are not Mary Sues and not boring.

            <p>Bit characters are characters that have bit parts. Meaning, they aren&#39;t the focus of the story, but appear, perform actions, and may have lines. <br><br>A good sign of a bit character is that they are in the story, and aren&#39;t background characters (even if they aren&#39;t named), but the story isn&#39;t &#39;about them.&#39;<br><br>They may or may not have description-- sometimes they don&#39;t need any, and they&#39;re left to imagination. It would be ridiculous to describe every character your leads see... especially when the leads don&#39;t really take notice of them themselves. How many people a day do you see that you can describe only as &#39;a security guard&#39; or &#39;a mailman&#39; but not give a detailed description?<br><br>Of course, if things are a little TOO-lacking in description, it all becomes beige prose. :<br>Even so, that&#39;s a bit character. I know that&#39;s probably covered on the wiki, but I needed to get my daily dose of blathering over with. &gt;_&gt;;</p>

            <p>Hi everyone!<br><br>I found PPC about a week ago through TVTropes and have been enjoying it ever since! I&#39;ve read through the original series so far and have been reading through other works. Don&#39;t worry, I disposed of my sanity years ago. I don&#39;t know what else to say other than I look forward to being part of the community!</p>

            <p>Honestly, everything that was changed from the books was changed for understandable reasons-- fit the movie. The pacing felt right, the characterization was <i>spot on</i>, and aside from a handful of minor quibbles (the Lovegoods&#39; house was, I felt, more dreary than it needed to be; part of what made that so poignant was what preceeded it - also, the eye-color has slightly bothered me from the first movie), it was awesome.<br><br>The end of an era, in a way. I doubt they&#39;ll ever be my favorite books or movies, and I won&#39;t say they&#39;re The Best [insert category] Ever, but there is still something... profound? about the very last movie of the series. </p>

            <p>I went to the midnight premiere with a load of friends, and I have to say, it was a geekishly wonderful experience.

            <p>For the most part they got it right. But they glossed over a couple important parts and they screwed up the final battle scene.

            <p>They glossed over Fred&#39;s death: they just showed the dead body and didn&#39;t actually specify as to which twin it was. We got little to none of Dumbledore&#39;s back story. And, this wasn&#39;t so much glossing over as leaving out, they didn&#39;t have Harry fix his wand.<br><br>Also, I liked the battle scene the way it was in the book. It&#39;s a big dramatic thing in the middle of the great hall with a lot of spectators. In here there was no one watching and it was in the courtyard or something. And Harry was supposed to have a cool speech about the wand which they had him say to Hermione later on.<br><br>I mean, over all I did like it. I liked it a lot and thought they did a very good job with it. I just tend to be a bit of a canon purist and get annoyed by little things that I consider important.

It was quite the parade of horrible.  Well done, you sick, twisted geniuses.<br><br>So, share your stories.  Who were you?  What was your favorite (or most traumatizing) badfic?  Did you do any irreparable damage to your brain by writing/reading any of this?<br><br>I was D4rkm0k, Ponyrella96 (I started a discussion about who that was, in the IRC.  Did anyone guess it was me?  I really want to know.), and Dystopian_Utopia (ran out of steam before I could get to the good parts with that one).<br><br>I have to say, my favorite parts of the Game this year was my duel with Tungsten Monk.  She issued the challenge before the game started and we pushed each other to new heights of badfic.  Her fic about Brightbeard shaving was hilarious.  But, I don&#39;t think we have a clear winner as of yet.  We will keep you posted.</p>

            <p>As you may have guessed I was &quot;Charlene Heterodyne&quot; and I actually like the idea of Makes Things (Or at least someone in DoSAT) being a spark, but it&#39;s one of those things that would take more brain power than I have to spare right now to do well. (Plus I don&#39;t have Permission, and may never decide to seek it due to other things on my plate.) Anyway it was a lot of fun writing out the idea without having to put in the effort to make it good. <br><br>I suspect I could have done a better job of making it bad, but a respect for good writing is so much a part of me that being deliberately bad, as opposed to unavoidably bad during a &#39;Spew Draft&#39;, is tough for me. It was hard enough to keep myself correcting typos and spelling mistakes.</p>

I made it so dull and uninteresting that it&#39;s not even funny as a joke anymore.  Oh well.  Cite it as an example of how NOT to write missions.</p>

            <p>Agents <br><br>Name: Mulrun Krolek<br>Rank: Unofficial Captain<br>Age: 25 standard years (or so he appears)<br>Species: Human Male<br>Homeworld: Yaga Minor<br><br>Description:  Captain, formerly Lieutenant aboard the Imperial Star Destroyer Titans Fist.  A tall, slightly pudgy man with brassy blonde hair, Malrun can come off as cold, pompous, prone to meddling in things that should not be meddled with and seemingly too involved with his crew.  However, seeing as he used to be the Bridge Liason to Enlisted and NCO affairs, it’s probably an acquired useful skill.  Specializing in the Discworld continuum (excluding the Aching series), the Escaflowne Anime and various movie franchises, he carries a particular grudge against one particular Escaflowne sue-fic.  No one knows why.  He has become used to authority although he wonders if it has actually done him or others any good.<br><br>Name: Portia McSweeney<br>Rank: Crewman<br>Age: 18-19-ish<br>Species: Human Female<br>Homeworld: Harry Potter Fandom Homeworld (quasi-Dreamlands where the Shipping Wars happen), Kabocha province<br><br>Description.  At about five feet tall, with dark brown hair, a “sort of Minnie Driver thing around the nose and cheeks”, a slender (make that skinny) frame and rather bad acne, Crewer Portia McSweeney is definitely not what one would call a stunning beauty.  For many of her crewmates and members of the PPC, she is neither what one would call particularly sane, being subject to nightmares of a battle she was never in along with occasional waking flashbacks. Part of this apparent oddness may come from being unable to truly forgive herself for “failing to protect” her friend, Ensign Soyoto Akima (traditional name order), to whom she was an unofficial member of retinue, with Akima the daughter of a proper samurai family in the Harmoni clan and Portia the descendant of namban traders.  Has a thing for rant-fics, especially concerning HP and the last two books. While not a bad hand with a naginata, Ms. McSweeney is denied access to the Harry Potter continuum for her own mental health... or what passes for such. <br><br>Leader of the Soyoto Mourners Society.<br><br>Side Characters<br><br>Name:  Joseph Clayton<br>Rank: Ensign<br>Age: 21-ish<br>Species: Human male, briefly touched by the power of the Outer Gods<br>Homeworld: A version of Cthulhu Mythos Earth<br><br>Description: At the most basic level, Joseph is one of HP Lovecraft’s nightmares made flesh.  He is a strapping Yankee boy, the pinnacle of the “aryan” physical and educated ideal, who is deeply, passionately in love with the tattooed daughter of a clan of (what HP would consider) degenerate cannibals from the mountainous depths of Annam and has adopted the markings of her people.  Working as a Navigation officer aboard the Titan’s Fist, he hopes to save enough pay to afford a decent wedding and/or honeymoon for him and the future misses.  He worries about being tracked down by the Mi-go or Majestic 12, as he fears he’s made an enemy of the latter or just interests the former in the brain department. However, since he and the Mi-Go worship the same gods and know each other from the past, they may just want a lunch date.<br><br>Name: Marie Trinh<br>Rank: Ensign<br>Age: 21-ish<br>Species: Human female, ethnic Viet, subgroup Leng Viet (one of a number of groups known by the derogatory “Tcho Tcho” label).<br>Homeworld: A version of Cthulhu Mythos Earth<br><br>Description.  Communications Ensign Marie Trinh and her fiance, Joseph Clayton, are from the Mythos.  Her people, a Viet subgroup who adopted some of the sorcerous ways of the men of Leng around 2000 years ago (mostly to keep the rice growing and keep hidden), are infamous for cannibalism, a fierce and isolationist territorialism, kidnapping and human sacrifice.  Her family, however, never did anything except sending home the obligatory remittances of money and ketchup.  She acts as the replacement for Ensign Soyoto Akima, who died while trying to knife JK Rowling.  She also becomes embarrassed when others relate tales of the battle that led to her people judging Joseph a suitable match for her, feeling that they take too much delight in battle and blood and heroism and that they know nothing of the fear and panic of that day.  </p>

            <p>Yes, they are &quot;returning&quot; (or should I say, retiring) to HQ life after as much as 10 real-world years on the move, though the funny thing is that aging is much slower on this ship.</p>

            <p>But I read on the Permission page not to go too deeply into the full history.<br><br>Anyway, the origin:<br><br>Shortly before the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion Arc in the canonical Star Wars Universe, the Titan&#39;s Fist was apparently lost in some sort of spatial anomaly in the minimally mapped depths of Wild Space.  Imperial and New Republic salvage teams found nothing and the ship was declared MIA.<br><br>What actually happened is much more interesting.  Slipping through a rupture in time and space, the Fist came upon a giant, ancient construction of unknown design.  Having lost almost half the crew including the captain and having sustained massive damage to the sensor and drive systems, Lieutenant Krolek was forced to gather the other junior commissioned officers and decide on a course of action.  <br><br>Eventually shuttles were sent into the massive structure, in which was found an abundance of non-euclidean architecture and strange technology.  Items such as a shrinking device, dimensional dampeners and even a teleportation engine were found, salvaged and incorporated into the engines of the Titans Fist.  Specialty sensors that could tune into thoughts, specific locations, the past and the future were also grafted into the systems, with no one yet having a complete understanding of how they work.<br><br>Given the command for his role in organizing the salvage, Acting-Captain Krolek also had to deal with one other important fact: he had discovered what others would call the “multiverse”.  In short, there was one “real” world (aka Earth 001, aka The Real World) and then there was the universe of all the fictions written of, called “continuities”.  While shocked that his own universe was one of these “continuua”, it also presented an interesting path.<br><br>In a few instances, the Titan’s Fist woulds jump to these universes in order to witness plots and stories in progress and, on occasion, to hire their services out to the author in order to implement some occurence or another that was vital to the plot of the story.  These jobs were responsible for fulfilling most of their supply needs, not to mention gaining new crew.  Most of the new recruits came young and, green as they were and as isolated as the ship was, they had to be drilled hard.  From universes, fandoms and even Earth 001 did crew come and, with the coming of the Yuuzhan Vong and the destruction they wrought and the time that has passed in the Star Wars EU, many arguments were given for and against going home or staying as effective mercenaries.<br><br>&quot;Plot device&quot; is a name snarkily given by a number of the crew who are disturbed, dishonored or tired of playing facilitator to every author and two-bit fanfic writer merely for food.  That&#39;s why many of the officers voted to come here so that the Fist might be put to good use... whole or as salvage.<br><br>The rest of the Crew... are free to go home or to join up, as soon as they are given story identities.<br><br>Now, assignments.<br><br>Malrun requests placement in the Mary Sue department, as many of then grind his colon.<br><br>Portia, as she is of... uncertain mental stability at the moment, will likely be put in the Dept. of Intelligence, drawing up charge lists for fanfics (the reading of which is her hobby)<br><br>Joseph has requested a post in the Dept. of Dead Author Electricity Generation, since he will probably get the most out of the Lovecraft Turbine.<br><br>Marie is undecided... but because Portia seems to have transferred her protective urges to the older woman, an attempt to lure her into Intelligence and fact checking is most likely.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s cool, and it would make an interesting story on its own, but to me it seems too grandiose and non-humor-based to really fit in with the rest of our construct here, even as a backstory.

            <p>I realize now that the grandiose aspect was part of the attraction, as was the sheer potential for humorous chaos with 50 000 crewers crowding into HQ... including, but not limited to, trying to blast through walls until they found the fabled pool room.<br><br>As a note to Makes-Things, his equipment dump was stupidly easy to raid.<br><br>I think the principle two characters may work if I remove the star wars angle: one is a proud Star Wars fan with an ancient writing shame and an intellectual attitude towards the Harry Potter fiasco, the other is a Harmonian irridentialist with a guilty pleasure for rant-fic (and cookie dough ice cream), adoration for the really good AU goodfic... but who knows when enough is enough in the bashing and OOC departments.<br><br>Just do not ask about the naginata.<br><br>Joseph and Marie were actually a Mythos fanfic idea, more Howard than Lovecraft, that somehow found it&#39;s way in here.

            <p>From my perspective, it would be cool if you toned it down to a few people (being your future agents) that were discovered by actual PPC agents who came on board the ship. The ship could be a semi-functional beater or entirely derelict. That&#39;s up to you.<br><br>Having a large crew flood headquarters could disrupt the main canon, which is something to avoid.

            <p>I&#39;ll have to rework the agents a little bit, but If I just have them as crewers or officers on a post-Caamas Joint-Faction ISD that has been hijacked and run down into beater-status by multi-verse mercenaries (wanting to sell their services to badfic authors) with little overarching story...

            <p>I think I remember reading somewhere on the PPC wiki that you shouldn&#39;t spork a fic if the author discontinued it because they realized it was bad. But is it okay to spork a fic if the author discontinued it for other reasons?</p>

            <p>Wasn&#39;t it more about the author attempting to remove the fic than discontinuing it? In most cases even after an author tries to remove a fic it&#39;s still archived somewhere, and I think it was considered kind of mean to spork a fic that was at least <i>attempted</i> to be taken down. </p>

            <p>It doesn&#39;t qualify as a &quot;crisis&quot;, but it could be fun. See, I was watching My Little Pony (yeah, yeah - it&#39;s actually pretty good) and got into a discussion with a friend about the RP-starting possibilities of Poison Joke. This is a magical plant which causes the victim to suffer magical effects which are harmless but embarrassing. On the show, these included uncontrolled hair growth, bodily shrinkage, tongue swelling, changing a female character&#39;s voice to that of a male, causing a unicorn&#39;s horn to go limp, and causing a flying horse&#39;s wings to be attached upside-down. The effects are usually related to the victim&#39;s personality, e.g. the swollen tongue was suffered by a very talkative character. It&#39;s easily cured by a herbal bath, and the effects aren&#39;t dangerous beyond embarrassment. I propose that, as a prank, someone sneaks some into the HQ airvents/laundry/wherever, causing several agents to suffer its effects. Hilarity ensues. Thoughts?</p>

            <p>On the Wiki, it mentions that there are wands available for non-magical agents on Potterverse missions, containing pre-programmed spells. My question: does every wand contain the <i>same</i> spells, or is there some degree of customisability?</p>

            <p>I have the impression that DoSAT are always handing out things that either malfunction at the most (least) fitting moment or doesn&#39;t quite do what they are supposed to, so a wand missing all the useful spell sounds like it would fit right in.</p>

            <p>I strongly disagree.<br><br>That makes no sense for the characterization of Makes-Things or Techno-Dann&#39;s agent self that they&#39;d let DoSAT send out still-broken things or half-assed repairs, and I&#39;d argue that by having that viewpoint and essentially using that in your own stuff, you&#39;re putting both of them out of character. <br><br>Especially Makes-Things, when you consider that we make a rather large deal of him. For example, from the wiki...<br><br>&quot;Makes-Things&#39; skill with machines and technology is nigh-on legendary in the PPC&quot;<br><br>&quot;Makes-Things invented most of the technology agents now take for granted, such as the remote activator, the combined CAD, and the DORKS, among others.&quot;<br><br>And in regards to Techno-Dann...<br><br>&quot;Exactly how he distinguished himself enough to be warranted taking over the Department&#39;s second-highest spot is also unclear, but if it impressed the Flowers it had to be good.&quot;<br><br>As a general rule, people who are good at something know it, and they&#39;re going to have standards. Saying that DoSAT hands out broken stuff or &#39;does not work as intended&#39; stuff is pretty much going against Makes-Things and Dann&#39;s stated characterizations, not to mention any other technician. <br><br>Narratively, I&#39;m personally of the opinion that PPC tech breaks as much as it does because it&#39;s poorly maintained by the agents (When&#39;s the last time you ever saw an agent treating DoSAT tech with care or making sure everything was working right and up to snuff before they go into a mission?), and used in situations where it is the technological equivalent of staring into the sun for several minutes in the middle of summer with no cloudcover. (No, no, you do not need to point your Canon Analysis Device at Legolas when he&#39;s singing along to Nightwish and cutting his wrists and preparing to dye his hair raven black.) The Rule of Funny works better involving PPC tech when yes, it is a PICNIC (Problem In Chair, Not In Computer) scenario problem instead of putting that it was because people who are competent and know what they&#39;re doing are giving you crappy stuff because they can&#39;t fix it right. <br><br>I can&#39;t think of many spin-offs where it was clearly a user error than DoSAT mucking up, which is concerning. I can only think of one other than my own, which isn&#39;t really impressive. Chatvert has Kitty jump into an ocean with her CAD still on her (no prizes for guessing that it breaks), and has Alec purposefully point another at a massively OOC character to use it as a make-shift grenade. In my own, I have at least one case where July ends up playing hot potato with the CAD because it didn&#39;t occur to her to not point it at a normally god-level powered pokemon that has suddenly taken human form, wears anime style clothes looks like a bishonen, and is a woobie uke.<br><br>This probably seems to be from out of left field, but I&#39;ve noticed this viewpoint show up more and more and it&#39;s somewhat alarming.<br><br>The idea that it&#39;s DoSAT that is the reason that your stuff always breaks, not what your agents doing with it, and that -with the suggestion that it&#39;s always them- they&#39;re so incompetent they can&#39;t even do the job that they&#39;re assigned to do, is practically a Suvian one. It&#39;s something we see in Suefic all the time. The Sue can&#39;t do anything wrong or break anything, so if something does go wrong, it&#39;s because of background character X or background item Z.<br></p>

            <p>Personally I consider borked equipment a time-honoured tradition in the PPC, dating back to Jay and Acacia.<br>Of course it shouldn&#39;t be used in every mission, but no plot device should be used that way. If you have a faulty RA in every mission, it doesn&#39;t make it any better that it is always because the agents are morons who break it.<br><br>I don&#39;t see why saying that there are equipment malfunctions would somehow be an insult to Make-Things or Techno-Dann&#39;s skills. It might as well be because DoSAT are overworked and understaffed - like every other department in the PPC - or because a lot of the gadgets are experimental and have to do with things that are in fact physically impossible.<br><br>Anyway, isn&#39;t it equally suvian to say that nearly everything Make-Things and Techno-Dann make is faultless and that the agents are just to stupid to use it properly? Even the Large Hadron Collider malfunctioned and it was built by some of the world&#39;s greatest minds. The Doctor is smarter than all the worlds greatest minds and he has a broken chameleon circuit on the TARDIS and leaves the brakes on when he starts it.<br><br>&quot;No, no, you do not need to point your Canon Analysis Device at Legolas when he&#39;s singing along to Nightwish and cutting his wrists and preparing to dye his hair raven black.&quot; Well, actually, you do. You need to know whether you are dealing with a character replacement.</p>

            <p>I would like to point out that in the cases I did point out how the agents broke or otherwise made their equipment malfunction it was not a case of &#39;user was a moron&#39;. One accidental, one was from mindless habit, and one was a case of being smart in how to make use of something they knew was going to happen. Hard use in harsh environments typically results in a short lifespan for most delicate equipment, which PPC tech from DoSAT certainly qualifies as. Nowhere did I make outright statement or suggestion that field agents are idiots when it comes to their equipment. <br><br>Things can and do break down; it&#39;s when you make statements like &#39;DoSAT are always handing out things that either malfunction at the most (least) fitting moment or doesn&#39;t quite do what they are supposed to&#39; where you&#39;re making a large presumption in regards to their ability to process their work. There is, like Dann pointed out, a difference between &#39;always handing out things that break&#39; and &#39;things sometimes break&#39;. Even if you&#39;re overworked, to make the sort of mistake of having nearly everything that goes out leave in a state where it&#39;s already malfunctioning is massively incompetent. Nowhere did I say or make the allegation that Dann or Makes-Things process and send everything out perfectly. Again, I did not call agents stupid, or say that the fault must lie entirely with them. Equipment does fail, especially in harsh conditions.<br><br>Continuing making allegations as to things that I have said doesn&#39;t work, when I&#39;ve pointedly indicated otherwise. <br><br>And, in recourse to what you said to Dann, when you say something, you need to be willing to back it up. You could have simply said you were exaggerating in your initial reply to me instead of posting what you had. Blanket statements make for weak discussions and arguments, especially when it results in requiring you to use various fallacies to further your own point.</p>

            <p>And nowhere in my original post did I say that Techno-Dann and Make-Things are incompetent and yet that is what you accused me of saying, and that was what I was replying to.<br><br>But you know what? Never mind. If you can&#39;t see the difference between making an offhand remark in a thread about Muggle-wands and ... I dunno ... editing the wiki to say that Make-Things is an idiot, and don&#39;t realize that a statement like &quot;all ___ are always ___, (for example &quot;all men spoke of his prowess&quot;), probably aren&#39;t meant to be taken literally, I really can&#39;t see us getting anywhere with this conversation, which anyway is less of a conversation and more of a old boarder using her extensive and slightly pompous vocabulary to beat up a new one who made an unforgivable remark, which she has already noted was an exaggeration.<br><br>I am terribly sorry that I joined the PPC for the fun and not to have long discussions about FN and the human rights of Mary Sues. You have thoroughly put me in my place and I will forever be aware that Olaf Quimby II is watching my posts, ready to strike down if I try any more descriptive writing.<br><br>PS. For someone who takes a perceived slight so serious, you sure make some pretty offensive blanket statements yourself. The difference between you and me, are my ability to say to myself &quot;Nah, she probably didn&#39;t mean it in that horrible way it came out.&quot; You should try it, once in a while. ^^</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t see the issue with her post. I think she said she had it beta&#39;d by a bunch of people other than me, too, and it never even occurred to me (and likely none of the betas) that the length of it would be a negative (as long as it&#39;s not War and Peace). <br><br>Especially in light of how recently July&#39;s had to fend of all kinds of arguments because people have misunderstood her meaning.

            <p>I honestly saw the issues I mentioned. I like to think I&#39;m not the sort of person to make things up to appear fair... because that wouldn&#39;t be fair.<br><br>Betas take note: communication is as much about what we don&#39;t say as what we do. Note all the accusations on both sides about not sticking to the literal meaning of every word. Unfortunately, literal definitions aren&#39;t always how we communicate. Everything is nuanced, and the more complicated and long the communication gets, the easier it becomes for both sides to make mistakes. For example, the &quot;you&quot; statements I mentioned. Whatever the intention, &quot;you&quot; statements make the argument about the other person, not their ideas, and it&#39;s a really quick way to put the other person on the defensive. At all costs avoid the word &quot;you&quot; in a debate.

Agents have a tendency not to treat their gear very well, and DoSAT is as overworked and underpaid as the rest of the PPC. I think they do the best they can, which is pretty good if their fame is anything to go by. Plus, it&#39;s funnier if the agents bring their difficulties on themselves.&quot;<br><br>See what I mean?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Context is important: not just what is said, but who says it and when.

            <p>At least when we&#39;re talking about fictional characters - saying the real Dann does shoddy work can&#39;t be taken nicely, but when we&#39;re talking about people within the written world, it seems possible to debate them relatively objectively. <br><br>Not to say it isn&#39;t always good to frame such things with &quot;I think&quot;, of course. <br><br>I certainly agree that context is important, particularly on a communication platform like the Board. However, what you said about July being accused of doing Wrong Things so easily worries me, because that&#39;s <i>definitely</i> not in the spirit of the PPC, nor acceptable on the Board. I don&#39;t think it actually happened, and I think a lot of the fuss here has more to do with misunderstandings over the intention behind what someone said, with people feeling attacked due to the tone of posts even if they weren&#39;t meant that way, but let&#39;s all be careful, shall we? <br><br>That said, this looks like it&#39;s edging towards a different potentially nasty argument, and I think we&#39;d all like to avoid that, so I suggest that this discussion end here, unless someone has something specific that needs to be said or answered, and everyone involved feels sure they can keep it entirely objective.</p>

            <p>They originate there, but the spells contained in the wands used by agents are apparently not the same as in the ones used by students at HFA, so the agents&#39; wands might still have been made or at least tweaked by DoSAT, in which case some of them are probably borked.<br><br>If I&#39;m wrong and all the wands are made at HFA, it isn&#39;t to much of a stretch to imagine that there is a mix-up and some agents end up with the wands meant for students, which only contains usele... spells which need more creativity to use in missions.</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>This is a lengthy post -just under a sixteen hundred words- so please bear with me.*<br><br>   I&#39;ve been noticing a viewpoint on Sues that is encroaching onto certain pages of the wiki, but isn&#39;t actually addressed in the main article on Mary Sues. That viewpoint is that Sues are not sentient or sapient beings, little more than humanoid-or-whatever-the-species-they&#39;re-trying-to-be-shaped flesh-bags filled with glitter, while the main article&#39;s definition is the following:<br><br>   &quot;<i>A Mary Sue is a pet character that the author exempts from realism and/or rules that otherwise govern a fictional world. The more that the author exalts this &quot;darling&quot; at the expense of the rest of the story, the more of a Mary Sue the character becomes. Mary Sue is impervious to failure and resistant to all in-story attempts at criticism and humiliation; any attempt at an external critique usually provokes an authorial temper tantrum. With a preference for style over substance, attitude over empathy, and romantic relationships above all others, the Mary Sue is nevertheless a popular character type due to her function as cheap wish-fulfillment.</i>&quot;<br><br>   If you notice, sapience and sentience are not addressed at all in that definition. I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s not something you can pin on all Sues as a matter of course, much less say that all characters are sapient or sentient or not because of a few issues that come up. Needless to say, I&#39;m interested in everyone else&#39;s opinion, but before I do, let me outline a few ways we can look at this. <br><br>   For one, from a &#39;normal&#39; writing perspective, you can&#39;t say that a fictional character is sentient or sapient just by fact of being fictional and not actually being alive. Their ability to &#39;think&#39; and be aware of their surroundings is limited entirely to what is allowed them by the author, and that is controlled. The author controls everything in the piece they are writing, and in cases of bad writing they will have the characters do things that do not line up with the setting or circumstances where characters are terribly obliviously unaware of something they should be, or understand and know things they have no business or normal ability to know. Judging if a fictional character is sapient or sentient is downright impossible due to this.<br><br>   Secondly, from a writing perspective where you do treat the characters as people, it&#39;s the opposite. All characters should automatically considered to be self aware, and thus sentient and sapient beings. They know who they are, what they&#39;re doing, and they&#39;re the ones making those decisions and learning and understanding things, even in the case of bad writing where things jump the logic line. <br><br>   That said, you can of course argue that it is on a case by case basis that each character should be judged, on the basis of how they&#39;re fleshed out, what the setting is like, and their role in the piece in question and how they act and react and whether they grow or not, and why. This of course renders any blanket statement impossible to make just on that alone.<br><br>   Finally, there&#39;s also how we in the PPC treat Sues, and the fact that we, as a group, do several things that can be used to treat that statement in a method of ways. First and foremost is the fact that something that is not condoned in the least is torture. It&#39;s looked down on both in character and out of character, both from higher-ups (Flowers and/or PGs**) and from colleagues (fellow working agents and your average Boarder). Torturing a Sue is Going Too Far, and not just due to the fact that it isn&#39;t funny, because as I have illustrated previously, yes, you can make it funny with the right spin or angle.° It doesn&#39;t, however,  make it right. The fact of torturing a humanoid character implies that said character is able to experience pain and not like it.<br><br>   The definition of torture, according to the United Nations Convention Against Torture is the following:<br><br>   &quot;<i>...any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him, or a third person, information or a confession, <b>punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind</b>, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in, or incidental to, lawful sanctions.</i>&quot;<br><br>   Using this definition (which I will adhere to for the purposes of this thread, and I ask others to do the same) eliminates considering Sues as animals or less than animals, especially when the torture of Sues would fall under the bolded clause.<br><br>   Additionally, there is the continued recruitment of Mary Sues who are either mild or are sincerely penitent, which means the statement can&#39;t be a categorical imperative. You need to be aware to be apologetic of previous actions, especially to be able to be willing to repent. It&#39;s the recalcitrant ones who are killed after being charged, which also indicates a viewpoint on the part of the PPC as an organization that Sues are aware of their actions. In court trials, the punishment for those who have been decided by the court that they are not fully in control of their actions, be it through insanity, infirmity of the mind, or otherwise not understanding what they did or the consequences of their actions is different from those who have been proven to have full control of their faculties.<br><br>   This of course, you might think, does not coincide with the various foods and beverages the PPC has that have Mary Sue as a base ingredient, such as Sue Soufflé or Water (for those of you who aren&#39;t aware what Water is, it is a beverage made from Sue blood. Why yes, it is glittery), or the acts of keeping Mary Sue scalp belts, or collecting their skulls, and taking all their things, and what have you.<br><br>   In regards to Sue Soufflé and Water, the PPC Cafeteria is downright infamous for the many questionable foods it serves, to the point where eating from from it instead of being there to socialize with agents besides your partner is an excellent  sign of having finally Lost It. The Cafeteria, as a matter of fact, low budget, and cooks who have to produce meals for hundreds (if not thousands) of people every day, needs to obtain ingredients quickly and cheaply to produce something that at least looks edible, even if it is not, in actuality. It is without a doubt very easy to obtain Sue corpses when they&#39;re not being fed to monsters and are left out in the fields, steps, hallways, and rooms of various continua, and  better than leaving them there to stumbled upon by an unwitting and clumsy canon character.***<br><br>   Scalp belts and the collection of various shinies are a natural development in an environment of few awards and accolades, little recognition from Upstairs of the combative abilities of Assassins and other agents who deal with Sues, and little-to-no pay****. Having items that show proof that yes, you had taken down this Sue what had sparkling glowing rainbow hair or had a blood dripping katana that would play a Battle Royale if you swung it just right is important in an organization of hearsay, gossip, and rumor, like most organizations that get large enough become. When people are not awarded for their own achievements in a potentially morale draining career, the only option is to provide them yourself. <br><br>   In short, I don&#39;t think we can say that a whole group of something- Mary Sues, in this case- are non-sentient, not aware, and are essentially animals. There are many many ways to view if a character would be self aware or not, and the definition of Mary Sue as provided on our wiki does not contain anything to suggest that they are or are not, just that they are characters designed to fulfill wishes and desires on the part of the  writer.

            <p>Working under the logic that any fictional character is sentient, Sues count as sentient as well. To be sentient, one only has to have the power of perception by the senses. Technically <i>worms</i> are sentient. As for sapience, <i>I&#39;m</i> not sapient. I&#39;ve never shown great wisdom or sound judgment in my life. Well, maybe once or twice, but those were flukes. So, no, Sues aren&#39;t sapient, but then a case could most likely be made for more than half of the PPC being non-sapient as well.<br><br>Also, here&#39;s a thought: Unless they have the sense of touch, the Flowers are not sentient, while Sues are. On the other hand, I&#39;m pretty sure at least most of the flowers are sapient.</p>

            <p>Hm. I&#39;m going to try to reason it out as I go along. Feel free to poke holes. (Not going to get into bit characters.) Wow, this turned out longer than I expected.<br><br>I usually get the impression that Sues are a cross between badly-raised children and ghosts/phantoms/something-of-that-nature.<br><br>The bad child aspect of course comes from the parent/author coddling them. The author gives his or her darling little Sue whatever she desires. The Sue doesn&#39;t have to work for anything. She doesn&#39;t suffer consequences. She simply does as she pleases, much like a spoiled child (you know the kind: the child you want to smack silly in the store because she&#39;s terrorizing the staff, breaking the merchandise, and acting like a deranged monkey while her parents completely ignore the behavior). Because she doesn&#39;t know what is acceptable behavior in a character, she simply goes on doing as she pleases. The longer this goes on, the more set in her ways she becomes and the harder it is for her to see that she&#39;s in the wrong. So, in this aspect, the Sue is sentient, but in a way that all of her thoughts and actions are based off of what she has been taught by her parent/author. If removed from the bad influence (the author) early enough, it&#39;s possible that the Sue could reform. The problem is finding Sues who are &quot;young&quot; enough, so to speak, that they will listen to reason and not go running back to the author who has always protected them and given them what they want..<br><br>The ghost/phantom aspect is a little harder. You can, of course, see the Sue and touch her. She has a body. It&#39;s inside, where her soul (her sentience and consciousness--that which makes her *her*) is supposed to be, that you find the difference. Some Sues have more thought put into them than others; they have a more solid soul/substance. Others are merely blatant, self-insert Sues: empty, with no purpose other than being a vessel for the author or reader. The soul has faded so that it&#39;s almost nonexistent. Those Sues with more soul are basically filled to the brim with glitter, and there&#39;s no hope for them. There&#39;s no room for anything else, and they must be destroyed. Those empty Sues, though, can go down two roads. The moment an agent cuts them off from their author and confronts them, they 1) collapse and fade away when they are dispatched, leaving nothing behind but a body; or 2) they waver a bit, trying to stand on their own, but ultimately use the new, good influence of the PPC&#39;s canon, agents, and authors to solidify into something that doesn&#39;t resemble a Sue quite so much anymore (this could possibly require intensive, long-term therapy to ween the former-Sue away from bad tendencies, and to prevent a relapse into Sue-hood).<br><br>So, you are murdering the Sue when you kill it, but by the time it reaches the Cafeteria in a Sue Souffle (or other inedible), you&#39;re not actually eating a Sue. The &quot;soul&quot; is already gone, and all that&#39;s left is a toxic body. Likewise, in the case of scalp belts, they&#39;re simply trophies, no longer a part of the Sue. In fact, they never were. The Sue&#39;s body is more like a shell or a suit for the Sue. As soon as she&#39;s removed, that&#39;s the end of it. There are still traces of Sue (which is why consuming any part of it is a bad idea), but the body is not itself as bad as the Sue. I imagine that if someone decided to turn into sort of monster and eat part of a living Sue, the results would be far, far worse.<br><br>... My mind seems to be wandering a bit at this point. I wonder if I covered everything I wanted to cover? This is mostly just speculation and what I imagine when I&#39;m thinking of this sort of thing.</p>

It makes sense (but not cents, sadly; my purse weeps). <br><br>In the case of scalps or whatnot, what is being kept is essentially the same as keeping some ridiculous piece of jewellery or furniture the Sue conjured up while in power - that it was part of her body doesn&#39;t really make a difference in the end, when all the words come tumbling down.

            <p>I am of the personal opinion that most &#39;Sues are indeed sentient, and know all too well what they&#39;re doing. Most of the &#39;Sue stories I&#39;ve read have given me the impression that the &#39;Sues know exactly what they&#39;re doing, deep down inside of their glittery little hearts, and that they simply don&#39;t care. They allow Suethors to manipulate them, but that&#39;s just because a Suethor makes the &#39;Sue&#39;s life oh so much easier. <br><br>It&#39;s because of this willful desecration of canon that &#39;Sues are targeted by the PPC. They&#39;re like war criminals: we allow them basic human rights by not torturing them, but otherwise, it&#39;s open season on Mary Sue.</p>

            <p>In my mind, Sues are characters the same as any other—agent, canon, whatever.  However, Sues, by virtue of their status as fan characters, don&#39;t actually belong in the worlds they reside in.  (This obviously doesn&#39;t apply to canon Sues like Eragon, who do belong, for better or for worse.)  As Sues commit worse and worse transgressions against the canon over the course of their existence, they become more and more glittery, and more and more openly hostile against the canon.  The less glittery specimens can still be removed from their badfic (and author&#39;s influence) and become part of the PPC.  More glittery ones are more likely to be openly hostile against agents when they reveal themselves to the Sue.  (Also, compare factory Sues, who are created almost entirely out of glitter rather than writing, and are also essentially &quot;programmed&quot; for hostility against the PPC.</p>

            <p>I pretty much agree with you - I would only add that the sentience or sapience of any given Sue doesn&#39;t necessarily mean all others have the same capabilities. In one of my early missions, Agent Sedri killed an original character and commented on how there just wasn&#39;t enough &#39;substance&#39; to him for him to fight death. Judging whether or not a character has enough &#39;substance&#39; is always going to be subjective, but it&#39;s generally the way we distinguish between bit characters and other OCs, isn&#39;t it? That&#39;s how I&#39;ve always treated it. <br><br>So, if they&#39;re bit characters, I tend to treat them as having no sentience and just being parts of the scenery, so to speak. In my opinion, some Sues are so flat and underwritten as to fall under the same umbrella category. Others are - infamously - complicated and undoubtedly substantial enough to have sentience as we class it in the PPC world. <br><br>So, if you agree with the above, I&#39;d say they have limited sentience, then, depending on their particular origins. We can show respect as a generalisation, but not treat them as sacred. <br><br>On that note, I&#39;d also add that (I think) our modern western society is very frightened of doing anything that might be seen as &#39;wrong&#39; by anyone, and while I <i>definitely</i> do not want to get into <i>that</i> debate, I do think that we are less fussy within the world of the PPC, hence the Sue Soufflé and its kin. <br><br>But let&#39;s not get into the complexities of PPC salaries - whether or not an agent can prove that they&#39;ve killed however many Sues isn&#39;t going to get them paid anyway ;p<br></p>

            <p>I forgot about the phenomenon of bit characters when I made my statement. Bit characters aren&#39;t sentient and they appear to &quot;deactivate&quot; once their purpose in the story is fulfilled. Often, they are minimally defined if at all.<br><br>I&#39;d like to amend my statement to say that lack of author tampering can produce a sentient character, but that character must somehow drive the story by his or her own written actions. In other words, they must have an important role in the story. Obviously, this gets into the realm of the subjective and is a rare occurrence as major characters are often highly tampered with.<br><br>This eliminates bits like shopkeepers, wingmen, and arranged engagements that Sues like to angst over by allowing them to deactivate once their purpose is served.<br><br>Ranger would have been a villain in the story and as such is a major character. By the time the other Sues were killed, he really didn&#39;t do much and was able to be recruited.<br><br>Perhaps, the timing in which we meet the character in the narrative is important? Maybe a Sue can be redeemed if removed from the canon early enough.</p>

            <p>Serious discussions like these are how we better understand the fictional universe this all takes place in. Better understanding of canon leads to better fanfiction.<br><br>If not that, some fanfics (any sporked by DAVD) have some very needlessly disturbing moments. It&#39;s good to establish that we&#39;re better than them. :)</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t believe Sues are quite sentient/sapient... but I do believe they have the potential to be. It&#39;s just that the Author doesn&#39;t LET them be a person.<br><br>This is because all Mary Sues (that I have encountered) are the product of some ulterior motive on the part of the author. Does the author want to write about coolness, or wish they were cooler? The Sue is cool. Does the author have a vendetta against other people in their life? The Sue is now abused or teased and everybody feels bad for her and hates the &#39;preps,&#39; &#39;evil parents,&#39; or &#39;mean kids&#39; that harass her. Does the author wish they could be a canon character&#39;s girlfriend? The Sue is irresistible. (Though they may not admit or &#39;actively&#39; desire these things... people&#39;s true feelings DO come out in their work. The personal attachment many suethors have to their Sues proves that...)<br><br>But... those things aren&#39;t a person. How many times do we encounter Sues that don&#39;t have a place to call home and instead are just inexplicably hanging around canon characters? How many of them don&#39;t have families or sources of income? How many of them literally do not have any sort of life outside their interactions in the fanfic? Or, if the nominally do have lives, how many of them drop them in a heartbeat for something &#39;better&#39; that doesn&#39;t contain having to live as a real person?<br><br>Furthermore, the author&#39;s super-involvement with the Sues&#39; conflicts and environment also suggest that a Sue may not be as independent or capable as a real person should be. Romantic rivals in the way? Author kills them all. Unbeatable enemies? Author gives Sue powers that kill them all. Impossible task? Author creates circumstances where it&#39;s magically easy. A Sue doesn&#39;t get by on her &#39;own&#39; merits: doesn&#39;t HAVE to think, doesn&#39;t HAVE to work, doesn&#39;t HAVE to strive to survive. <br><br>All they have is this mission that the author gave them. Nothing else matters; everything is an accessory to that goal. She has to sleep? It&#39;s so she can have prophetic dreams. She has to exercise? It&#39;s so the love interest can see her all sweaty and glistening. She gets wounded? It&#39;s so people can fuss over her. None of her functions as a character... or even a living thing exist for the sake of themselves-- they all exist for this goal.<br><br>That sure doesn&#39;t sound like a legitimate character to me. That doesn&#39;t even sound like a living thing to me. In fact, it sounds more like a doll that the author&#39;s moving around.<br><br>It&#39;s not putting them as &#39;lower life forms&#39; in my eyes. It&#39;s putting them as not even alive in the first place.<br><br>Sure, all characters are assumed from the get-go to be sentient or sapient. But it&#39;s the actions of a person that count, and if that person does not demonstrate that they are sentient... or even an organism at all... then why should we just assume that they are thinking beings when they give us evidence to the contrary?<br><br>This is also why Sues are redeemable... if they give us MORE information that suggests that they are in fact living, thinking beings, then they can be real characters. If they act like people, they can BE people. <br><br>So no, in my eyes, Sues are not lesser animals or bags of glitter. Sues are more like willful dolls, or angry spirits that may take physical form with a single goal and no need to act like a living thing at all in pursuit of that goal...<br><br>This is also why torturing them is a no-no aside from appropriateness. A Sue isn&#39;t built for that. You aren&#39;t causing it pain, you aren&#39;t making it suffer. It&#39;s useless. Any clever thing the agent does to kill a Sue is for the agent&#39;s amusement only. Sues don&#39;t suffer because in their own story the author prevents them from suffering. They&#39;re prevented from being characters, because an outside force tailors their appearance and interactions to not even NEED the Sue there.<br><br>And that&#39;s why Sues are often generic. They aren&#39;t their own person. The story doesn&#39;t need a character there. It needs a Sue. Which can be anything-- meaning, that Sue is in fact, nothing.<br><br>Characters are something, not nothing.</p>

            <p>While I haven&#39;t read the fanfic that Ranger from the original PPC (Chapter 7: Children of the Earth) came from, it seemed that his sentience/sapience came from the fact that he was less defined as a character. All that was really said of him is that he was an evil twin of a Sue character and that he had little impact on the story when they met him. Based on his case, I believe that all added characters, including cute animal friends are sentient when they are created and it is through constant author tampering that they become nothing more than viruses that infiltrate the canon and re-purpose it to fit the author&#39;s desires.<br><br>Ranger didn&#39;t have a really defined personality, but he was able to reason that joining PPC was preferable to death and that fear/avoidance of death is part of the definition of a living being. It would appear that he is a living person with a generic personality by default, but still sentient due to lack of author tampering.<br><br>On the contrary, a skilled author could make a well-defined character and the character can be sentient as long as the character acts in accordance with his defined personality and faces challenges realistically.<br><br>As for torture, even if a Sue is not technically living, it still reflects poorly on the agent. For example, you wouldn&#39;t want your child playing with another child who likes to take hacksaws to his teddy bears.</p>

            <p>As far as characters in general go, I&#39;d say some are definitely more self-possessed than others, and I mean that literally. I mean, we&#39;re all writers here, we all know what happens when a character suddenly becomes more than we ever planned for. I do think of myself largely as a scribe or historian, recording things that are not under my control beyond the effect I have by observing them from my own point of view.<br><br>Tangential thought: suppose that sensation comes from the collection of ideas that makes a character using unfamiliar pathways in the brain? I mean, ideas are real, they exist, so characters exist in the same way. It&#39;s all neurons firing when you get down to it. Our brains are infinitely complex. If they go off in a pattern we&#39;re not used to, responding to things we&#39;ve never seen in ways we&#39;ll never practice in real life, is that not, in effect, another real consciousness? Do our characters, in a non-metaphorical sense, use our brains to become sentient? O.o<br><br>... Leaving that aside.<br><br>As far I&#39;m concerned, the reason Mary Sues are treated as autonomous is to avoid bullying the author. Yes, Mary Sue is the author&#39;s darling; yes, she gets everything she wants because her author give it to her. However, the point is not to beat up on the author, but to critique the writing. Therefore, we kill the creation, not the creator. From this perspective, it doesn&#39;t matter whether the Sue has that quality of seeming-sentience or not.<br><br>From an in-universe perspective, the issue gets a lot more complicated because we&#39;re dealing with individual agents who may each have a slightly different take on things:<br><br>- Derik doesn&#39;t worry about whether Sues are sentient or not; they&#39;re a plague, it&#39;s his Duty to destroy them until he himself is destroyed, end of story. If Thread were sentient, dragonriders would still burn it out of the sky to protect Pern from its wanton, pitiless ruination.<br><br>- Earwig is a kender; he thinks it&#39;s all a game.<br><br>- Gall is perfectly happy being a murderer.<br><br>- Supernumerary, if you really, really pressed him, would own up to suspecting everything is made of words, so he&#39;s a fictional character fictionally killing other fictional characters, the difference being that the story he&#39;s in is better-made than the one the Sue&#39;s in, so it&#39;s like natural selection or culling the flock or some other metaphor in which the stronger thing destroys the weaker thing for the greater good.<br><br>- Jenni <i>knows</i> that it&#39;s all made of words—at least from one perspective. From hers, it doesn&#39;t matter, because it all feels real to her, so she has to act accordingly. She probably wouldn&#39;t be able to kill a Sue except to defend someone else&#39;s life, and even then she would try everything in her power to avoid it. If you ask Jenni, former avatar, fan character, and possibly Sue herself, no one is beyond redemption. Too bad she can&#39;t personally fix everyone.<br><br>- Ilraen . . . I don&#39;t actually know what Ilraen thinks about it. It&#39;s one of the many issues he has to make up his mind about as he grows. I suspect he&#39;ll come down on the side of his warrior ancestry and accept it as due process in the course of defending the universe, though.<br><br>So, in the end, every viewpoint is equally valid. Therefore, one blanket statement of &quot;Sues are sentient&quot; or &quot;Sues are not sentient&quot; can never apply.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve always thought that torture is verboten is not only because of the unnecessary suffering, but because of the way it reflects on the torturer. It&#39;s very hard to write a character who can thoughtfully and knowingly inflict suffering as a prelude to death for no reason other than their own personal satisfaction. Compare and contrast animal cruelty- even though the animal isn&#39;t sentient, and not a &quot;person&quot; by an stretch of the imagination, we&#39;re still (generally) loathe to inflicting unnecessary suffering on them. Considered from this angle, the question of Sue sentience becomes irrelevant: one don&#39;t torture them not only for their own sake, but for the sake of not employing people who will perform torture for their own satisfaction.<br><br>Whether or not the killing of a Sue is murder is largely academic. By the rules laid out within the PPC&#39;s internal continuity, Sues are damaging to the canon in which they are inserted and, as such, must be excised. The few who aren&#39;t too warping to their &quot;home&quot; canon can be extracted without killing them, but the more serious cases must be terminated in order to reverse the damage their existence does to the canon they infest.<br><br>I guess what I&#39;m saying is that, while intriguing, the question of Sue sentience isn&#39;t too relevant to the Great Work.</p>

            <p>For my definition of torture I used the one I gave, from the UN, and bolded the portion on it being as punishment or other discrimination, which is where the torture of Sues would fall as concerned by how the PPC is organized and how we deal with Sues, it&#39;s even in the very name. Protectors of the Plot Continuum. We style ourselves as being a form of law enforcement. We&#39;re a law agency. In the original series, we had constables; only later did we become agents. <br><br>We treat the Sues as people because we find what they did wrong, we tell them what they did wrong, we come to a conclusion on what the punishment should be for those aforementioned charges, and then carry said punishment out.

            <p>From a “normal” writing perspective, I don’t think the ‘Sue sentience should be taken all that seriously, but from the perspective of treating characters like people, or from an agent in the PPC, and defining sentience as simply self-awareness, I think that ‘Sues are a bit like the ghosts of the Harry Potter continuum, even though they behave like a real person, and appear self-aware, they are not, just the imprint of a real person that has been left behind. In the case of a Sue, this would probably be the Suethor’s image of an idealized self (fitting again with the wish fulfillment) and in the case of a canon ‘Sue, the image of a Suethor’s idealized canon character. <br>   When a ‘Sue is recruited, they stop being a ‘Sue; they become more then the shadows of an idea, and are fleshed out into “real” people. Thus, I think ‘Sues themselves are not sentient, but some ‘Sues have the ability to become so, which should be judged on a case by case basis, (which in turn, is different from an animal, who by any science we  currently have cannot become anymore “sentient” then they already are or are not).<br><br>Torturing a ‘Sue is looked down upon, in part, I think, not because ‘Sues are sapient, but because they are so close to being sapient. It’s a small step from torturing a ‘Sue to torturing a “real” person. <br><br>Basically, I think ‘Sues are not sentient, but rather something that mimics self-awareness and sentience.  I think ‘Sues have the ability to gain sentience, but only partially by themselves, or wholly with help form either from their author or agents. Also, I like to think that many agents have less then satisfactory morals anyway.<br><br>In that way, ‘Sues are a lot like robots. o.o<br><br>Hopefully I haven’t just made myself look idiotic by posting this here. &gt;_&gt;;<br></p>

            <p>I am personally of the opinion that characters are (in a strange sort of way) their own people. This is mainly because I usually lose control of my stories and my characters end up yelling at me that &quot;No, you idiot! I am not going to jump in to save her! I don&#39;t care that she is my love interest&#39;s sister, I&#39;m not that nice of a person!&quot; which in turn causes arguments between me and my characters. <br><br>This would then pose the question of: &quot;If Sues are sentient then isn&#39;t it murder to kill them?!&quot;<br><br>The way I see it, characters are not sentient until suddenly it is the characters dictating the story rather than the author. An example of this (besides mine) is the appearance of Faramir. According to <a href="http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Faramir#Trivia"><a href="http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Faramir#Trivia">http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Faramir#Trivia</a></a> (which, admittedly, I do not trust very much, but let&#39;s pretend it is credible for the sake of my argument) Tolkien himself wasn&#39;t quite sure where Faramir came from and was &quot;Sure [he] did not invent [Faramir]&quot;. In this case Faramir, would count as sentient because he is, more or less, dictating his own actions rather than having them dictated by the author. In most cases of Sue fics, the author is controlling the Sue like a puppet. When a milder Sue is confronted by the charges they are able to break free of the author&#39;s control (with the help of the different author, of course) and repent their Sueish ways.<br><br>The other time when characters have sentience is when they are well developed and their actions and abilities make sense for their character. (For example: it makes sense that Merry and Pippin, being loyal friends of Frodo and slightly foolhardy, would insist on going on the quest, and, because their is more to hobbits than meets the eye [and they are extremely loyal], would be able to play an important role in saving Middle-earth. It would not make sense for Mary Sue, a twelve year old girl from earth, to be allowed to join the Fellowship because she proved her [previously non-existent] fighting skills.) When it comes to the point that the character&#39;s actions are predictable based on their characterization rather than the archetype of their character, then the character can count as Sentient which is why most Sues do not count as sentient and are okay to kill.<br><br>This is really just my (rather lengthy) opinion, and the way I rationalize it. It is also how I remain in denial of the fact that arguing with my characters might seem slightly crazy.</p>

            <p>&#39;This would then pose the question of: &quot;If Sues are sentient then isn&#39;t it murder to kill them?!&quot;&#39;<br><br>We do, after all, have <i>assassins</i>, not pest controllers or exterminators or hunters, or what have you.

            <p>To me, charges are not really intended for the Sues. They are essentially summarizing the agents&#39; complaints against the fanfic itself. It&#39;s more of a review or note to the author, so that the author can write better characters and fiction in the future. Upstairs gets mad when charges aren&#39;t spoken because otherwise, the complaints aren&#39;t spelled out to the author.<br><br>&quot;Assassin&quot; seems more of a courtesy to the fact that Sues are usually humanoid.</p>

            <p>Not a bad first mission. You&#39;ve definitely got potential. However, there were a few things that kinda got under my skin.<br><br>--The bulk of the story felt more like a MST than an actual PPC mission. Lots of snark and very little action in between blocks of directly quoted badfic text. It felt like you relied too much on the direct quotes from the badfic rather than on your own words.<br><br>--The voices of your agents did not feel very distinct. There seemed to be very little to distinguish one from the other, personality-wise. You should not be able switch the dialogue tags of your characters and still have your story sound like it works. More distinguishing agent-specific actions would help with this issue.<br><br>--This last bit is just my own personal sentiment, but I thought you got a bit too meta in places. You know, when you started breaking the fourth wall of the mission itself (retrieving the machine guns, for example.) It smacks a bit of showing off. Again, that&#39;s just my personal view. If that&#39;s the way you like to write, more power to you.<br><br>I look forward to your next mission.</p>

            <p>RIP, miss Assihina. ;_;<br><br>Also, it seems like Haruhi destroying the world is going to be a standard problem in that continuum. New agents taking missions in it should probably get at least a warning about it, if not actual training as to what sudden fading color means.</p>

            <p>This was, overall, a very entertaining mission. The interactions between your agents was well done and I enjoyed how you made the troll a viable threat. Too often I think we get rid of the various Sues, Stus, and what-have-yous far too easily, so it was nice to see a bit of a struggle.<br><br>I was not, however, a fan of how you brought Bella back. Not because I hate Bella (I really couldn&#39;t care less), but because of the time travel aspect. It felt... sloppy, I guess. I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it.<br><br>But besides that?

            <p>Personally, I&#39;d have liked it more if you killed the troll by deflating its ego or making such a display of ignoring it that it kills itself trying to get the agents&#39; attention, but maybe that&#39;s just my preference for poetic justice. My splitting hairs aside, good work.</p>

            <p>Well, I dumped most of the grandiosity and am paring my scenario down to a few, less &quot;out there&quot; characters<br><br>Agents<br><br>Portia McSweeny (or &quot;Porsche&quot;, if you will): Much the same as before.  She&#39;s still 5 feet tall, skinny, has that &quot;Minnie-Driver-thing around the nose and cheeks&quot; and still has rather bad acne.  As before, she is an unrepentant Harmonian but still has standards of writing and characterization (she HATES God-Mode Sues).<br><br>She purports to have taken an intellectual view of the whole mess, but due to both canon-fatigue and having never passed her &quot;keep from shooting her arse off&quot; training, she is currently relegated to the Department of Intelligence, with a prescription for possible transfer to Pratchett duty.<br><br>Eventually, she will be joined by...<br><br>Malrun Krolek:  A former lieutenant of the Imperial Remenant Navy, his ship was hijacked by a mysterious band of pirates and dragged into Inter-continuum space.  Making his escape with Portia while the rest of the remaining crew sacrifices the ship, his stiff, military demeanour and weapons training allow this pair to go on actual assassination missions... hopefully.<br><br>I also claim this fic (having reported it before) to... well, not spork, but scout at least.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4605681/1/The_bReal_b_bUs_b"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4605681/1/The_bReal_b_bUs_b">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4605681/1/The_bReal_b_bUs_b</a></a><br><br>It&#39;s like I said, Ms. McSweeney hates Sues, especially God-Moders (makes everything so boring).  The troubling thing is that while there are some sweet moments and actual laughs in this fic and that Ms. McSweeney (and By definition myself) has a soft spot some of the authors rantier material, she (and thus myself) just cannot ignore the Sue-ism, the character bashing and the underage squick.</p>

            <p>I read through the fic you want to scout out, and I&#39;ll confess: at first, I thought it might actually have the potential to be good. That was dispelled the farther along I got in it, as the author showed extreme prejudice, severe GodModing, and breaks from both canon and the historical timeline just to suit their own wishes. Too bad--if there had been good, plausible reasons for everything, and less Weasley bashing (though a little could have been allowed if the properly worked to simply be for humor&#39;s sake), this fic could have worked nicely.

            <p>I prefer his fics and oneshots where no-one is particularly bashed.  Among these is &quot;Bun in the Oven&quot;.  It&#39;s a bit raunchy, yes and perhaps a bit over the top but there are parts that are sweet and hilarious and... well, everyone else may have dropped their jaws at Harry&#39;s one comment that started the whole process, but my Inner Thrawn just raised an eyebrow.<br><br>Still... &quot;Grandpappy Firebird&quot; and the thought of Albus in Anglican ministers robes and neon orange socks still does cause me quite the enjoyable chuckle.</p>

            <p>That thought also causes me enjoyment. XD<br><br>The title is referencing the fact that not everything this guy has written is bad. If he could just take out some Weasley-bashing, leaving in only the funny parts, maybe added some more romance between Harry and Hermione....and for the love of Agni, eleven year olds shouldn&#39;t be having sex! I&#39;ll understand that there are likely kids who are, but still! They&#39;re too young! And if Harry and Hermione are in love, I&#39;d like some more romance and development before it comes to sleeping together! V.V Luck on your mission.</p>

            <p>This is the what, 7,467,574th tenth walker? That&#39;s probably an understatement. Legolas/OC is also totally original. I&#39;ve never seen that before. I just love sarcasm. Did this person just never connect Riddle and Voldemort or what? Riddle being the most evil wizard in the whole story could be the reason there isn&#39;t a twu luv in cannon.

            <p>I enjoyed this mission- short and to the point, and the way they acknowledged and toyed with with the author&#39;s malapropisms was quite entertaining.<br><br>The only criticism I have is that it read almost more like an MST than a mission. The characters are inside the fic, but they never really interacted with it until the shooting started. The overall feel this gives is that Statler and Waldorf have joined the PPC. </p>
