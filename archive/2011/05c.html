            <p>I can only imagine how tricky this was to write.  The two badfics were both dripping with stupidity and boredom, and the similarities between the two OCs are a good example of how uninteresting Mary Sues can be.  The mission went on pretty long, but I think it paid off.  Well done!</p>

            <p>Yeah, this was a fine example of how overused and clich–π some character elements can be. But I think for me it was the first time that I encountered a Sue that was that similar to another Sue (and considering my list of missions, that&#39;s saying something).</p>

            <p>I wrote a little scenelet of Miah and Cali retrieving Abbey from Tasmin and Allison.<br><br><br>BIP. BIP.  BIP.<br><br>&quot;Why is the console making that sound?&quot; Cali asked as he edged away in case of an explosion.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a message,&quot; Miah said. She pushed the button and read the message.  &quot;Agents Allison and Tasmin have found Abbey. They have her in RC 80.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh thank goodness! I&#39;ve--I mean Magee has been so worried about her.&quot;<br><br>Magee threw a spare microchip at Cali. Castor gave him a disapproving &quot;Mrrw!&quot; and fluttered over to retrieve it.<br><br>&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; Miah said watching the exchange. &quot;Let&#39;s go get her before they manage to blow up the RC.&quot;<br><br>The two agents readied their distractions and left the RC. After several wrong turns, an encounter with Unger and the mini-Hound of the Baskervilles, Homles, and finding the cafeteria three times, they finally made it RC 80.  <br><br>&quot;We need better distractions,&quot; Miah said knocking on the door.<br><br>&quot;Agreed.&quot;<br><br>Agent Tasmin opened the door. &quot;You finally received the message, I see.&quot; <br><br>She stepped aside, and an ecstatic Abbey ran to Cali and latched onto his leg. He offered her chocolate, and she immediately let go to take the candy.  He picked her up and set her on his shoulder where she grabbed a handful of his unruly hair to balance herself.<br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t know you could make her de-glomp with chocolate,&quot; Allison said from behind Tasmin in the RC.<br><br>&quot;She loves the stuff--can&#39;t handle pure caffeine as well as the canon, though.&quot;<br><br>Dinozzo and Director Sheppard peaked around the corner, eying the chocolate.<br><br>&quot;Please can they come with us?&quot; Abbey whispered into Cali&#39;s ear. <br><br>Cali pointed at them and gave Miah his best impression of puppy dog eyes.<br><br>Miah sighed loudly. &quot;Do they have homes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;They do not,&quot; Tasmin said.<br><br>&quot;Well, we do seem to be running an NCIS mini adoption center. I suppose we could take them, at least until someone else wants them. They surely won&#39;t be lonely.&quot; Miah glared at Cali.  &quot;You are taking the blame with DoSAT for anything that gets destroyed.&quot;<br><br>She reached out to pick up Dinozzo. He apparently hadn&#39;t learned anything from being dropped on his head, because he tried for copping a feel. Miah didn&#39;t drop him. She threatened him. &quot;I&#39;m the only one in our RC that can cook bacon,&quot; she said seriously.<br><br>Dinozzo thought about it for a moment, and then said, &quot;I apologize sincerely, Miss.&quot; <br><br>He scrambled up to her shoulder and sat quietly. Director Sheppard apparently also took the threat to heart, because she made no fuss about being placed on Cali&#39;s other shoulder.<br><br>&quot;Thank you, and I suppose that if you ever can&#39;t find a home for NCIS minis you can always give us a page,&quot; said Miah.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ll keep that in mind,&quot; said Tasmin before she shut the door. <br><br>&quot;Let&#39;s go pick up the supplies for these two, and head back home,&quot; said Cali.<br><br>*0*0*0*<br><br><br><br>I think I&#39;ll open an NCIS Adoption Center in Miah and Cali&#39;s RC. <br><br><br><br><br>I found a couple of typos in the mission:  <br><br><br>Ziva and the Sue took the sheets off the bed and put them in evidence backs. <br><br>Her wet her was dripping on her shoulders.<br><br><br><br><br>I really liked smart alec commentary in this mission. The opening with a movie reference, which was fandom appropriate and then the head slap that was also fandom appropriate. I found a few lines things that I really liked:<br><br><br>Gibbs came walking down with his usual coffee in his hand.<br>&quot;How stale would that coffee be?&quot; Allison asked. <br><br><br>Tasmin took a deep breath. &quot;You&#39;re still gonna do that, right? Even if I say no.&quot;<br><br><br>&quot;If Gibbs didn&#39;t kill her for stealing his coffee, I don&#39;t think a random guy with a knife is going to be any more successful.&quot;<br><br><br><br>&quot;Yeah, that would be something.&quot; Tasmin opened another portal. &quot;Let&#39;s go back to the office and see whether the cat has returned his tongue.&quot;<br><br><br><br>&quot;...and find these minis some responsible agents to take care of them.&quot;<br><br>Allison raised her eye brows.<br><br>&quot;Or, you know, agents.&quot;<br><br></p>

I read it&#39;s the fourth largest fanfiction category, which means there&#39;s an abundance of badfic, but there&#39;s not many people in it.<br>I will also try not to start duels with squirt guns or grease the floor outside the cafeteria and scream &quot;Mary Sues!&quot;.

            <p>Thanks for the virtual stuff. I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll see it again soon.<br>I have a couple of questions. First of all, do both of your agents have to be human (I saw one that was a small lizard man)? Also, where can I post completed missions? I&#39;m pretty sure the Pit of Voles wouldn&#39;t like me running around on their site going &quot;Die, Sue, die- oh, shiny!&quot;. Are any of these places free, like the Pit? Lastly, if I target a fic, can I tell the charges to the author of the fic to help them fix the fic or write better in the future (except, obviously, annoying the agents)?</p>

            <p>Hello everyone! I&#39;ve been planning these two out for a while but I still can&#39;t help but think that they came out kind of badly on paper. Oh well. <br><br>Here is the piece of writing, which also serves as an intro of sorts: <a href="05c%3Fuser_id=16.html"></a><a href="http://kittykat1001001.livejournal.com/1593.html"><a href="http://kittykat1001001.livejournal.com/1593.html">http://kittykat1001001.livejournal.com/1593.html</a></a><br><br>Their bios (I apologize for the Gloria one; I tried to fix it up but it still kept dragging on): <br><br>Alastrine J—àrgensen-¬†<br>A nineteen year old who tends to act younger than she is. She was born to a then divorced woman, who is almost as whimsical as her daughter. Her first name was actually picked only because it sounded pretty, though neither were at all Celtic. She did okay in school, but mostly thrived among her friends and with her younger sister (a result of another failed marriage) and mother. Her friends tended to be the ones to keep her grounded. Despite her often whimsical and childish behavior she is actually pretty intelligent, especially when she sets herself to a task. However, she has some very odd habits and behaviors that only her and possibly her sister can figure out, such as where she puts stuff. She is a very happy person who almost never gets angry. If she does, she tends to remain smiling but become more of an axe-murderer type. Hurting or messing with her Lust Object or anyone from Harry Potter will cause this to happen, along with a combination of too little sleep and others harassing her friends or partner.¬†<br><br>Home Continuum: Real World<br><br>Lust Object: Hong Kong (Hetalia)¬†<br><br>Gloria Sato-<br>She was born in October of 1973 in Japan originally with the first name of Etsuko, but this was changed upon moving to the US when she was six so she would appear to be more &quot;American&quot;. After lots of drama (which may or may not be provided later on) her parents were killed and she was left for dead (due to falling out of a window INTO THE MIDDLE OF A STREET) by a Twilight vampire nomad. After waking up in the hospital several days later and killing several staff members and subsequently running off, she took several years to become rational. (If you haven&#39;t guessed already, she was an OC in a Twilight fic that involved a Mary Sue, though she herself hadn&#39;t been published and she wasn&#39;t that bad, just stuck... In a horrible story.) She tends to be a rather straight faced person, who unlike the 6&#39;1&quot; Alastrine is rather short, somewhere around 5&#39;. She is a &quot;vegetarian&quot; vampire, who is glad to have found that constant exposure to ridiculous stories and their horrid characters has caused her sense of smell to lessen, though so has her supernatural strength, speed, sight, and other such things. She tries to act like an adult, which tends to mess with peoples&#39; minds, especially her partner&#39;s. She gets annoyed rather easily at either immature acts (due to her trying to avoid doing such things no matter how old her actual mentality is) or people treating her as lesser than them, but she tends to not show it. If she actually gets furious she&#39;ll start growling at you. If you don&#39;t get it then that&#39;s the point she goes nuts and starts beating on you, no matter your size or strength. No one has actually been able to get her to that stage-or at least no one who currently knows her. So far people have only been able to get her annoyed, namely her partner.¬†<br><br>Home Continuum: Twilight<br><br>Lust Object: None known<br><br>The fanfiction I plan as my first mission: <a href="05c%3Fuser_id=16.html"></a><a href="http://m.fanfiction.net/s/5386744/1/TWILA_DA_GIRL_WHO_WAS_IN_LUV_W_A_VAMPIR"><a href="http://m.fanfiction.net/s/5386744/1/TWILA_DA_GIRL_WHO_WAS_IN_LUV_W_A_VAMPIR">http://m.fanfiction.net/s/5386744/1/TWILA_DA_GIRL_WHO_WAS_IN_LUV_W_A_VAMPIR</a></a> </p>

            <p>Disclaimer: I am not a PG but here&#39;s my two cents anyway.<br><br>On Alastraine:<br>How did she join the PPC? This isn&#39;t that important, I suppose, with how many World One agents there are, but it&#39;d be nice to know. The &#39;acts dumb but is actually really sharp&#39; is overdone in my opinion but nothing is objectively wrong with it. (FYI, it&#39;s not uncommon practice for asian women to bleach their skin and completely block it out from the sun - it&#39;s less common with modern americanized asian women, but it&#39;s still one of those idealized standards of beauty back in China, especially among older women.)<br><br>On Gloria:<br>She has no personality.<br>I mean, seriously, there&#39;s nothing there at all. She&#39;s not bothered by the small rooms (which makes me wonder why it&#39;s mentioned at all) but because she&#39;s impatient, except she&#39;s not being impatient about anything in particular. The &#39;damnit&#39; at the end seems to indicate she&#39;s not waiting for a mission, but you don&#39;t say what she is waiting for - I guess she&#39;s waiting for nothing. She standing still in a small room waiting impatiently for nothing. She apparently has no hobbies, or other relationships with people, and when Alastraine finally comes in, she just is in general short and a little bitchy. Honestly I don&#39;t know why she even talks to Alastraine at all - it would be more consistent with her character to just tell her where her room is then give her the cold shoulder. Gloria also seems decidely unplussed that Alaistraine pulled the &#39;dumb&#39; trick on her. <br>Another thing - why does Gloria have to be ashamed of being a Twilight vampire? There are good aspects to the series - Gloria should have some patriotism about her own canon (someone needs to), especially if you plan to be doing missions in it. <br><br>On the Story:<br>It&#39;s too uneventful. Introductions are important, but you don&#39;t need to shove everything into the beginning. Gloria seems the type that will avoid interaction unless it&#39;s absolutely necessary - the pair seems very incompatible, so Gloria should be trying to either get Alastraine to go away, or to go away herself. Alastraine should have to either chase Gloria to get her to answer these questions, or else ask her in a circumstance where Gloria can&#39;t run - like during a mission. Obviously you can&#39;t start writing the mission until you get permission, which just means you have to characterize in ways besides pure dialogue. <br><br>In summary: you have an interesting dynamic with your two characters that you aren&#39;t really using to it&#39;s potential. What&#39;s the point of having an angsty reticent character if she gives out major details of her life without prompting? Why have a silly upbeat character if she doesn&#39;t have to be annoyingly persistent to be successful? And finally, have stuff <i>happen</i>. </p>

            <p>Yeah, I kind of spent too little time on some of this stuff. I do have better bios (from my character sheets) and should probably post those soon in place of the quickly-typed summaries that were done on my phone. XD <br><br>I didn&#39;t realize I said &quot;is really smart&quot; for Alastrine. She kind of is smart, but is still a bit of a happy sort of idiot. Shall fix~ ;] (I&#39;m a little confused about that Asian women comment though. Alastrine&#39;s not Asian at all. Gloria is, but her skin&#39;s paler than normal because that&#39;s the case with all Twilight vamps.)<br><br>Gloria is a problem child of sorts for me. I did like your feedback on her especially due to the fact that she&#39;s actually thirty something but is physically (and kind of mentally, in terms of big mindset) stuck as a thirteen year old. Also, I hate intros with a passion. They&#39;re way too difficult to write, especially if you&#39;re writin them too fast. Perhaps I should show a different example of my writing (one that&#39;s better written but is not PPC related). I&#39;ll take some time on that though as I&#39;ll have to think of what to use. And you do have many other great points about Gloria, including that she should be proud of what she is because no one else is. (Besides, everyone knows that Edward Cullen is supposed to be the angsty &quot;I&#39;m a monster!&quot; guy, so Gloria shouldn&#39;t be like that too. Though I do like the idea of her being a cold-shoulder sort of person and ansgsty for other reasons.)<br><br>I shall remember to try getting stuff to happen- I might just do the official intro at the beginning of their first mission, so it won&#39;t be able to drag that long and won&#39;t be such a pain to write. <br><br>In other words, thanks for the very helpful input and I shall keep it in mind. :]</p>

            <p>The Asian woman comment was because Alastraine uses Gloria&#39;s paleness as a reason to identify her as a vampire, when it wouldn&#39;t be particularly unusual for an asian woman to be very pale. </p>

            <p>Yes, after many years of not writing for the PPC, a new mission! Starting from scratch and re-writing Shinra&#39;s misadventures from the top all over again. Sorry for the lack of funny for the first part. Just getting back into the swing of things.<br><br>So, just to clarify some things with the Oldbies...Agent Shinra used to be an agent in the DMS, but switched to the Department of Intelligence after the incidents in 2008 for personal and practical reasons. And so, she gets all new adventures! But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll go back in time every now and again in an attempt to have her past in written form as well~! That includes the weddings, hahaha.<br><br>So anyways...the new mission!<br><br><b><a href="http://pokegrey.webs.com/PPC-Intelligence/PPC01.htm">Part 1 - Beginning Anew</a></b><br><i>Or in Which Agent Shinra Is Attacked by a Lot of Beige</i><br>Returning from taking a long vacation from her work as a part of the action side of the PPC, Shinra is given an easy assignment of looking through a romance driven story in the Dissidia universe...or Kingdom Hearts...er...where was she again?<br><br>Once again, I apologize for the lack of funny.

            <p>Plus I&#39;ve had experience for writing Agent Corbett somewhat decently. *winkwink* And I had to do a scene of right before Aster goes on her own way with Shinra to re-establish her character. And, well, if you ever want to use Shinra from time to time for silly, motherly cameos when she isn&#39;t falling out of portals in the most ungainly manner possible, I&#39;m fine with it.

            <p>My agents haven&#39;t appeared yet because I&#39;m still working on my first mission, but if you need them you can use them.<br>Agent Joan Ford is a Noldorin elf. She has waist-long black hair which she wears in a braid, covering her ears, and she also has a silly amount of glitter in blood that allows her to have some completely useless Speshul Skillz, like being cheerful most of the time. Her bersek bottom is family, and she talks about her family all the time. She was also raised in World One.<br>Agent Bob Nothing is a biped Komodo dragon with a funny accent. <i>When he speakks he ttendts tto be almostt inkomprehensible</i>. He&#39;s a newbie and thinks that tempting the Laws just to see how they work is funny. He also has an issue with completely naked people. A towel is fine, though.</p>

            <p>For Bad Slash, here are <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Chalk"> Chalk</a> and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Jenka">Jenka.</a> Neither of them are familiar with Hetalia but still willing to help.<br><br><br>For the others, I have a couple of Agents I haven&#39;t posted anything about yet. Is that okay?<br><br>DMS: Frag and Norion. Agent Frag is a Krogan, recruited from a Mass Effect Suefic. He is easily eight feet tall, and has a large scar running across his face. Otherwise, he looks like the generic Krogan Battlemaster enemy sprite due to lack of description in his home fic. He is loud and eager for a good fight, but very dutiful. He uses a Hurricane V shotgun and biotics when fighting. Alone, his preferred technique is to biotic throw the enemy into a wall and finish them with the shotgun. When working with Norion, he only uses biotics during the cooldown period of each of their weapons and especially whenever his partner&#39;s pistol overheats.<br><br>Norion is a Alternian troll also recruited from a badfic. Because of the little description she was given, she has very generic, slightly curved horns and Generic Grey blood. The latter bugs her to no end. She is small because of her age (6 solar sweeps or 13 years old). Norion is also loud and eager for a good fight, and very reckless. She is worried that she is less of a troll and more of a human with horns and grey skin. She uses a Striker V pistol, but prefers hand-to-hand combat. She especially likes headbutting people. When using the pistol, she frequently overheats it.<br><br>Norion and Frag fight all the time, but during the invasion this will be limited to verbal bickering. None of them know the Hetalia canon. Expect arguments over which of them a kill belongs to.</p>

            <p>Huh. Let&#39;s see. Must be honest, there are few fandoms I dislike, but ambivalence does not a fan make, so we&#39;ll start with the Half-Life series. Firefly&#39;s one, too. I might be closer to LotR if I&#39;d read it within the past... years. Plural.<br><br>Homestuck, if you&#39;ve ever heard of it, is the big one for me right now. I&#39;m considering... well, Agent-wise, I&#39;m considering dragging a pair of characters from a fan-universe thereof. Which slightly embarrassingly means I&#39;m drawing characters from a fan-universe that drew the characters from original works. It&#39;s like a fanon filter.</p>

            <p>This peeve is not mission specific - I see this in most PPC missions. Few mission authors take the time to actually describe their characters. The PPC has so many characters that it takes a huge page on the wiki to list them - I don&#39;t think it would be too much to ask for a single line of description when a character shows up. </p>

            <p>Having agents-in-training sporking a badfic MST-style is a different and interesting way to review a badfic.  I also found the subplot with the other two students amusing, and I love the idea of an Ewok agent, even though it would make dialogue a little difficult on an actual mission.  Plus, using one of the Original Series missions as educational material is brilliant.<br><br>I do want to point out there are a few spelling mistakes in here, though.  In particular, you&#39;ve got a &quot;Mines of Moira&quot; mini-Balrog in there.  It&#39;s a great story, but reading all those misspellings kind of breaks the mood.  It&#39;s probably worth your time to read through it again and get those mistakes fixed.</p>

            <p>1) Google Docs is arguably the best choice.<br>2) It quite depends on personal chiuce. As long as it isreliable, it&#39;s fine.<br>3) It kinda varies. As the Wiki article states, it can be anything between a single, nearly empty room with a basic restroom attached (the original type of RC as in the TOS) to a full multi-room apartment. Do whatever suits you. I, for example, gave to my Agents an RC not too big but with enough furniture to make it a decent home, since they live in it.</p>

            <p>Hey, folks. So this is a tad awkward, but here goes anyway.<br><br>As some of you might be aware, the midwestern United States has been hit by a bunch tornadoes lately. Personally coming from southern Kansas, this is a bit of an &#39;And...?&#39; for me. However, the truth of it is that these tornadoes have been large, in charge, and hitting an unusual amount of highly populated areas. And this is the midwest, so that&#39;s saying something.<br><br>Anyway, to the point. The communities that have been hit are suffering. Tornadoes like the one that hit Joplin, MO can change a community forever. They need help. Now, I&#39;m not sure what the protocol on this is around here, but a friend of mine (and Blayze&#39;s) has put together an auction community on LiveJournal, the proceeds going to specifically help the Midwest. I&#39;m providing a link below, so check it out. I&#39;ve seen auctions like this do a lot of good, and with a surprising amount of PPCers living in this area I thought this might be of interest to the Board. They&#39;re accepting both offerings and bids, so please check it out!<br><br>At any rate, thanks for letting me blather on. <br><br><a href="http://help-midwest.livejournal.com/"><a href="http://help-midwest.livejournal.com/">http://help-midwest.livejournal.com/</a></a><br></p>

In particular, I enjoyed Abe. <br><br>Of course, it wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea to get a beta or two. I found this: &quot;With trepidation she pulled out her CAD out of her pocket&quot; but I&#39;m not the best at catching stuff, so there could very well be more. There were some other instances that could probably have been phrased better or used less repetition, but these are nit-picks. It was a good mission, overall.</p>

            <p>Excellent! I get to spork things now! Thank you! =D<br><br>As for the stories behind the names... it&#39;s an inside joke on Robert Schumann. See, in addition to being one of the foremost composers of the Romantic era, Robert Schumann was also one of the day&#39;s leading music critics. His style of criticism wasn&#39;t what most people would do these days, though: what he did was that he signed off his reviews as one of two pseudonyms. These two pseudonyms are the namesakes for my PPC agents: Florestan was the passionate, incredibly excitable one, and Eusabius was the calm, pensive one.<br><br>It even made it into some of Schumann&#39;s piano pieces, as you can see here:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXlH4y7ps4Y&amp;feature=fvwrel"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXlH4y7ps4Y&amp;amp;feature=fvwrel">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXlH4y7ps4Y&amp;amp;feature=fvwrel</a></a></p>

            <p>While yeah, I believe it&#39;s not cool to insult the writer of these things, there IS something that I&#39;m fairly sure anybody here can blame here without fear.<br><br>Their developmental stage, as writers, and as people.<br><br>There are plenty of suefics that are downright misanthropic, and nearly ALL suefics do not consider the happiness/well-being of canon characters with all that they barge into the canon and usurp the story focus from people who were actually trying to live their lives. So many of them exist only so a real-life person can pretend to be &#39;better&#39; than they are. And so many have ulterior motives, as perpetrated by the author.<br><br>Example. There is this fic that I am desperately trying to spork at the moment. It is Legend of Zelda. What this author does is pair off ALL female characters with OCs or kill them off, and is is very obvious she is doing so so that Link&#39;s only choice of mate is the Mary Sue... by way of availability. She cuts off all possible choices. Where one would normally say &#39;you can&#39;t know what the author was thinking when they wrote this,&#39; ... no. You really can. Not only is everybody immaculately paired off, when Zelda becomes available again (her OC &#39;husband&#39; is killed off for the sake of making a bad guy look more evil) she is immediately and very defensively stated to be pregnant and thus can&#39;t date Link. And then when the author forgets about the pregnancy, she decides to make Link and Zelda brother/sister (half-elf-half-hylian brother sister to boot) such that they &#39;can&#39;t&#39; get it on. Previously unattached characters such as Midna immediately grow husbands, not after the plot of the story, but as if they had been married all along. Midna is inexplicably the &#39;Twilight Queen&#39; with a husband when there had been no hint of it in the game Twilight <i>Princess</i>.<br><br>The author&#39;s ulterior, selfish motives are clear. But would it be wise to say the author&#39;s a selfish person? Yes... temporarily. Not permanently. This person&#39;s developmental stage is stuck in the egotistical, selfish stage normally associated with early adolescence-- you know the one I&#39;m talking about. The one that explains why everybody suddenly became idiots in middle school/early high school.<br><br>When I want to criticize this mindset, I usually take the Mary Sue as a manifestation of it. The Mary Sue wants to hook up with Link, so the Mary Sue makes sure all other women are hitched as to not even give him a choice.<br><br>If this author is not really that bright depends how long they are stuck in those developmental doldrums. I hate to insult authors, but if somebody is still acting like a selfish fanbrat at age 25, not all might be well with them. I have an older cousin who acts as if he thinks he is dark, paranoid, gritty and &#39;extreme&#39; because he thinks it&#39;s cool... not realizing he comes across as a moron. Not due to any mental issue or brain development. Just because that&#39;s what he thinks is cool. It&#39;s really not.<br><br>Why wouldn&#39;t this 26-year-old doofus make a Gary Stu that is a manifestation of his &#39;screw actually being a human being, I&#39;m more awesome than you and I am going to prove it!&#39; attitude?<br><br>So yeah. Most suethors will grow up to be nice, quirky people. Heck, I am still in the process of growing up to be a nice, quirky person. But many of the authors writing that fanfic that makes you scream &#39;how could you be such an insensitive moron!&#39; or &#39;you really enjoy being a horrible, manipulative person!&#39;, at THAT darkest stage of suethordom... are temporarily not that great of people.<br><br>There&#39;s a reason why early adolescence and bad suefic often go together. More often than not, it&#39;s that lack of empathy/thought that characterizes that developmental stage taking a manifestation in writing. Not all early teens are like this, but the ones that are sure do gather in FF.Net like flies on your ice cream.<br><br>***Just a note, throughout all of this, it is still not cool to insult writers, no matter what one may think of them. But I believe knowing the author&#39;s motives and mindset allows one to fully understand, to grok the story itself and allow for a funnier interpretation. It becomes a tale that wildly makes up ridiculous things in order to try and get some kind of goal rather than a story that makes one wonder &#39;WHY WOULD ANYBODY DO THIS?&#39;</p>

            <p>that it&#39;s about immaturity.  I didn&#39;t start writing fanfiction until I was fourteen, so I can&#39;t compare my treatment of canon characters, but when I look back at the things I wrote when I was twelve and thirteen, I see an immature writing style, bad plots, and overly powerful and/or angsty main characters.  I can only assume that a lot of the bad writers of fanfic just haven&#39;t gotten past that stage.<br><br>What I understand least are the good writers who don&#39;t care about canon, especially the ones who write stuff like these two badfics.</p>

            <p>Well, I can think of two reasons why somebody with basic grasp of storytelling would write really terrible crap.<br><br>1) Their emotional attachment to a stupid idea is stronger than their common sense. I know plenty of smart people who have some kind of lingering obsession with stupidly impossible things. Once again, not insulting the author, just the badness of their phase.<br><br>2) Despite their skill at writing, they have really terrible exposure to a variety of works. As hard as it is to believe, there are some people out there who read fanfic and books and stuff... but don&#39;t explore or try and improve beyond the semblance of being good. One particularly embarassing example is a friend of mine. He graduated college this year, and he is a self-proclaimed fanfiction snob-- he favors hundreds-page-long epic fics. Unfortunately, he also thinks that the Star Wars Extended Universe books and characters are high art (most of them are anything BUT) and is a fan of fanfictions that portray Hermione Granger as some kind of super-human apocalypse mutant witch, and stories that turn Harry Potter into a jaguar animagus and make him go to Brazil with Bill Weasley to swear, drink, and hit on women a lot... all the while running with a &#39;jaguar pack.&#39; And I won&#39;t even get into the fic that contains the line &quot;the rattata savagely lunged for Ash&#39;s neck, fangs bared!&quot;<br><br>(The only fanfic he ever wrote was the beginning of some AU where Kuzon from Avatar the Last Airbender was frozen in time like Aang, and turned out to be some kind of super soldier with a dark past who can&#39;t trust anyone. Commence canon rape, and the stealing of everything cool the canon characters do. Thank goodness the later chapters didn&#39;t make it onto the internet.)<br><br>Once again, the author&#39;s not a bad person. In fact, he&#39;s a pretty OK person. It&#39;s just very possible to have experience and knowledge of the basic mechanics, SpaG standards, and plot flow of a story, but little exposure to the goodness of a WELL-CRAFTED story, and no drive to get exposed to boot.<br><br>So yeah. &gt;_&gt;;</p>

            <p>Not to be a dramallama, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s that appropriate to change the wiki page or rename it. So many things link to it with those words, and not all of them are &#39;wrong&#39; or &#39;insensitive&#39; invokations.<br><br>Plenty of things talk about a metaphorical &#39;rape&#39; of sorts. It&#39;s not really appropriate to whitewash everything just because somebody may have a trigger to an offhand, metaphorical usage of a potentially charged word.<br><br>It&#39;s like saying that because there are people who mourn the WWII holocaust, the word &#39;genocide&#39; shouldn&#39;t be used.<br><br>Just saying. There&#39;s sensitive, and there&#39;s oversensitive. It&#39;s not good to devalue the word &#39;rape&#39; by using it casually, but maybe it&#39;s better if we use canon &#39;rape&#39; with the proper gravity.<br><br>Taking bits out for no reason other than it has the potential to offend somebody leaves a bad taste of Fahrenheit 451 in my mouth.</p>

He stopped and listened; a short figure moved forward out of the shadows.  Malfoy couldn‚Äôt have expected the face that revealed itself.<br>The face was covered in white makeup, with bright red on the lips.  The nose was obscured in a big red ball.  The face was surrounded by an orange wig of frizzy hair above, and a frilly white collar below.  ‚ÄúHiya, Malfoy!‚Äù the figure said in a raspy voice.  ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to say, ‚ÄòHello?‚Äô‚Äù<br>Malfoy was dumbfounded.  ‚Äú‚Ä¶Longbottom?‚Äù<br>Neville tossed an unfolded balloon animal at Malfoy‚Äôs feet.  ‚ÄúA snake certainly does have a long bottom!  Aha!  Aha!‚Äù  Neville squeaked the clown nose in time to his laughter.<br>Malfoy looked around.  He didn‚Äôt see anyone else.  Had someone jinxed the Gryffindor?  Malfoy had certainly never seen Longbottom smile for so long.<br>‚ÄúHas your pitiful life finally driven you completely mad, Longbottom?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúMy name is Pennywise, the dancing clown!‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes, fascinating.  Now if you‚Äôll excuse me, I have some Quidditch to practice.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt you want a balloon?‚Äù  Longbottom was now inexplicably holding a bundle of ballons by their strings.  ‚ÄúLook!  They FLOAT!‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhere are you getting these?‚Äù Malfoy shouted, growing furious.<br>‚ÄúWe all FLOAT down here!‚Äù  Longbottom shook the balloons desperately.<br>Malfoy turned to go, but as he started to walk away, he felt the sensation of something being pulled out of his pants pockets.  He glared and spun around, coming face to face with the Weasley twins.<br>‚ÄúWell, it was a fine plan,‚Äù said George.  ‚ÄúJust didn‚Äôt quite work out.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou did great, Neville,‚Äù added Fred.<br>Malfoy was looking back and forth from twin to twin.  ‚ÄúDo you mean to tell me,‚Äù he seethed, ‚Äúthat this was all just a plot to <i>steal my wallet</i>?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWell, you are rich,‚Äù said Neville, blushing through the clown paint.<br></p>

Also, he had a pounding headache.<br><br>He blinked, looking up at the ceiling as he tried to figure out what the hell had just happened. He vaguely remembered Nevillle Longbottom casting some kind of spell on him, and that was literally the last thing he could remember. Now, he had just woken up, and for some reason he was staring at the ceiling of the Slytherin common room.<br><br>Why he was there instead of the infirmary was beyond him. But he decided it was better not to think about it. Goyle and Crabbe had probably dragged him back to the Slytherin common room, but‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt that seem‚Ä¶ kind of odd of them to do, really? Everyone went to the infirmary first, and everyone in Hogwarts knew that.<br><br>So why was he--?<br><br>‚Ä¶<br><br>When Draco turned his head, the sight that met his eyes was so confusing he couldn‚Äôt even muster up the vocalization to betray how weirded out he was. And given that it was Draco Malfoy who was confused, that said a <i>lot</i>.<br><br>But then, even the nastiest of bullies would be confused at the sight their arch nemesis lying on his face in the most literal sense. The fact that <i>Harry Potter</i> of all people was in the Slytherin common room was not questioned, probably because of the possibly even more important fact that there was a rather small, but extremely important detail that had really made him much more than a little uneasy.<br><br>‚ÄúWhy is Harry Potter in my pants?‚Äù<br><br>Upon closer inspection, he had this to add:<br><br>‚ÄúAnd why are my pants made of leather?‚Äù</p>

            <p>With the Board&#39;s permission (and as interpretd under the Board&#39;s Constitution, Section Eight)...<br><br>For those who may be interested, I direct you to my only published fanfic, an incomplete Warhammer 40,000 / Mass Effect crossover. <br><br>Why? In hindsight, I look back on what I have written so far and sometimes I could not help but laugh.<br><br>The two core reasons for this attitude is:<br><br>1) A beginning author&#39;s first published fanfic - a crossover. Not a good move.<br><br>No matter how many revisions had been done over the two years I had been working on it, no matter the amount of canon knowledge or command of the English language I had gained over the years, a crossover is, in hindsight, a bad place to start in the fanfic world; and<br><br>2) As a fanfic writer, I can generally expect that the base would have a basic understanding about basic facets of the canon. Unfortunatly, I look back and realise my description may have been too basic.

            <p>I read the whole thing and honestly barely noticed the POV shifts, and of course, being me, 90% of the grammar errors mentioned in the sporking went right by me.  <br><br><br>It&#39;s funny what reading this fic does to your head.  This person you linked to is sporking it, and still can&#39;t wait to see how all the plot threads pull together. It&#39;s insidious. Brain breakingly awful canon wise, yet it somehow manages to make me want to check for updates.<br><br><br>I&#39;m about halfway through the sporking now.  I don&#39;t know if I agree completely with the assessment of Richard being a full out Gary Stu.  He&#39;s definitely too advanced for his age syntax wise in his speech--especially in the later chapter, but he only shows minor speshulness otherwise. I&#39;d say bit character level.  Though I might only be thinking that, because I am having to compare him to a character that looks like she will grow into being the worst Mary Sue of all time.<br><br><br>I followed one of the links in the sporking, and then followed a link on <i>that</i> page, and ended up at <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2101998/1/a_sad_story">this  </a>.  Someone should do a mission on it.  Seriously, or maybe an MST.  It is so over-the-top ridiculous that I couldn&#39;t help laughing at.</p>

            <p>I have to say that this would be a horrendously awful story to PPC. It is a canon raping abomination, yet it is very well written (other than this weird inability to know when to double a consonant), and has a fairly tight, compelling plot.<br><br>Yes.  <br><br>I am insane.  <br><br>Yes, I just spent hours reading the entire thing.<br><br>Anyway, like I said the offenses to canon are huge, but they are consistent. The things that have been altered have been explored to their logical, if still canon defiling, ends.  I&#39;m not saying this is goodfic. The canon changes are too far for me to think of it as a good AU, and there is a definite Sue in later chapters.  <br><br>You know this story is still being written, right?  <br><br>The Sue has not yet had time to come completely into her own, so that would complicate charging her. There are a few places where the author&#39;s inability to properly double or not double consonants in the &#39;ing&#39; forms of words would be good for a few laughs, but this is a loooooooong fic. Those places are too far apart to make writing a mission easy.  <br><br>Basically, there are three options that I can see.  <br>1. Go in and kill it in the first couple of awful chapters and ignore the next 50+ and the Sue<br>2. Wait to see if the Sue&#39;s presence breaks the continuity the story had built up (she is threatening to)<br>3. Admit that not all fics that don&#39;t line up with canon are good candidates for missions.<br><br><br></p>

            <p>I skimmed the first chapter and... dear god.  It&#39;s a monster!  Has the PPC ever done a relay style mission?  Where a pair of agents handles some of the fic then passes it and the charges collected off to another pair, and so on and so forth?  This might warrant such a mission for everyone&#39;s sanity.  I know I couldn&#39;t handle it alone... I&#39;m going to go purge my memory.</p>

            <p>I liked the dialogue at the end, with the Sue responding to her accusations, and the agents rebutting.  It was a good way to add more details about the problems in the abuse backstory, and also to make the Sue unwittingly admit to being an outsider to the &#39;verse.  It wouldn&#39;t work in every mission, but I liked it here.</p>

            <p>I would have liked it if all Sues responded to the charges made against them. They should have the right to defend themselves. But I think most Sues wouldn&#39;t have anything more intelligent to say than &quot;you can&#39;t charge me&quot;. So usually, I have Sues not say anything. </p>

            <p>That&#39;s my opinion, anyway.<br>Everyone- who doesn&#39;t believe in the Rapture, anyway- keeps going on about how the Mayan Calender ends in 2012 and that&#39;s when the world will end.<br>No one seems to realize that, well, the Mayans had to stop their calender SOMETIME, to just keep going on forever would take...well, forever. They probably came to that conclusion and thought, &quot;Screw this, I&#39;m not spending the rest of my life making a calender that will never end.&quot;<br>They couldn&#39;t have just kept going, the Mayan Calender isn&#39;t like the Gregorian one with specific months and specific days in a month.<br>Anyway, about the Rapture- Pfft. No offense to any possible religious boarders, but I find this so ridiculous that it&#39;s hilarious. The radio station that I listen to cracked a joke on how they were planning to go fishing today, and with their luck, they&#39;d start floating away JUST as they were about to catch a huge fish. On the same station, one caller said &quot;Ooh, we can offer meals! &#39;Last meal on Earth, you&#39;ll never get another chance like it! $100 for a burger and some fries!&#39;&quot;<br>This is almost so funny that it&#39;s sad, though. There was an article in the paper about a nurse who quit her well-paying job and sold her house so that there&#39;d be nothing to chain her down to earth when the Rapture occurred. I mean, you have to feel bad for those people. Come Monday- Sunday, even- they&#39;ll look around and say to themselves, &quot;Well, I didn&#39;t go to heaven. What the heck do I do now?&quot;<br><br>Anyways, I&#39;m going pre-Rapture looting now, anyone want to join me?<br><br><small><sub>Joking, joking.

            <p>Well, at least the posts on the fan community on Livejournal that I tend to visit a good deal. They were posting some stuff with the added &quot;since the world is ending tomorrow&quot;. I thought they had just pulled it out of thin air. Now I know they pulled it from Harold Camping. XD<br><br>Along with the whole &quot;No one actually knows when it&#39;ll happen&quot; I&#39;d like to add that it doesn&#39;t say who will be raised into Heaven and who will be left on Earth. For all we know all the evil people could be risen and the rest would be Left Behind (aren&#39;t I so clever?). Besides, I don&#39;t think being risen up at the beginning has anything to do with the judgement at the end of the world&#39;s end, so that could indeed be the case. <br><br>Americans can be so silly/easily fooled. Perhaps it&#39;s because (in this case at least) they fear not knowing what&#39;s going to happen in their futures?</p>

            <p>Well, the world will end sometime, but I don&#39;t expect it to be now.  December 2012 makes much more sense, since the US presidential elections, which is promising to be the craziest in a very long time, if not ever, will just have taken place.  What I don&#39;t get is why these people think that they&#39;re going to be right this time when prophecies like this have such a terrible track record. And no, America isn&#39;t to blame, since people have been predicting the end of times just about since the beginning of our existence.<br><br>Anyway, in case the Christians get taken to heaven tonight and the rest of us are left on the Earth, immersed in despair, I&#39;ll say right now that you guys are awesome, and I&#39;m going to post my first mission today so I can be sure I did it before the end of the world.  No use taking chances. ;)</p>

            <p>...is that there are so damn many of them it&#39;s almost virtually guaranteed that the next big one isn&#39;t actually going to happen. There was a whole Penn and Teller&#39;s &quot;Bullshit&quot; episode about end of the world prophecies, and I remember this one part where Teller was tossing all these index cards detailing all the predictions of the end of the world. There were a LOT of &#39;em, and you&#39;d be shocked how many of them came before this century.<br><br>Now, if only I could actually FIND that clip, that would make my life easier.<br><br>It&#39;s why I really don&#39;t buy into the whole &quot;Rapture&quot; thing.<br><br>But hey, it&#39;s good for people who want to set up ridiculously sappy (and contradictory when you stop to think about it) stuff like this:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OySl4D7S4U&amp;feature=player_embedded"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OySl4D7S4U&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OySl4D7S4U&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded</a></a> <br><br>Also, it&#39;s good for the mass media to distract us all from the debt ceiling. Hell, the Boston Phoenix&#39;s edition right now is going on and on about Rapture, but from the captions on the cover, I think they&#39;re grilling it alive in the actual issue. I wouldn&#39;t know because I&#39;ve never actually read Boston Phoenix, but given their history I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they did grill Rapture and this Harold Camping schmuck alive. (One issue I remember from the mid-term elections had a cover of Tea Party darlings Sarah Palin and Christine O&#39;Donnell in a soft-core drawing of them engaging in lesbian bondage sex while performing some kind of witchcraft ritual. No, I kid you not.)<br><br>So yeah, I don&#39;t buy into it.</p>

            <p>Okay, so reading over that post with the badfics from a couple of weeks ago didn&#39;t quite clear my question up. Basically, will it be possible for missions to be done in the Axis Powers: Hetalia anime/manga? (It sounded like the nations could indeed forget and therefore be set back to normal, but some other posts after that made it sound like that wasn&#39;t the case.)<br><br>Also, if Hetalia would indeed be able to have missions within its universe, does that mean that a page should be made for the series in general? I&#39;d be willing to help/do it, but I honestly haven&#39;t worked on wikis before and so don&#39;t really know how their formats work. (In other words, help with such a page would be wonderful.)<br><br>Thank you for any answers/input that can be given for this. <br>-Kitty&#39;s Muse</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve made the page! Of course, being rather new (and it being 11:30 at night) it&#39;ll probably need some revision. It&#39;s under the article title of &quot;Hetalia&quot;, but should that be changed to one of the full titles (like Axis Powers Hetalia)? Also, any added information/improvements, especially in the area of bad fanfiction (which right now has no designated area) would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!<br><br>-Kitty&#39;s Muse</p>

            <p>Yay! I was thinking it might be along those lines, but some of the later comments seemed to be contradicting that consensus, so I&#39;m happy that we will be able to do missions in Hetalia (and probably similar series). <br><br>Hmm... I shall read that section (and probably some of the other series&#39; pages, to see what their general layouts are) and at least start a Hetalia page. Once again, thank you for the help.<br><br>-Kitty&#39;s Muse</p>
