            <p>*huge grin* This very story was the reason I left my first post on the board, back in July. It&#39;s been obsessing me like you wouldn&#39;t believe, monstrous piece of shit that it is. Really, I&#39;ve been telling people about it. It feels so <i>good</i> to finally see the damn thing PPCed. And I gotta say, girl, you did a real good job. I kept giggling at this mission. I&#39;m just glad you stopped the Sue before the monkey business came into play. Because that section was twenty different kinds of wrong. *pause* You know what? If Tolkien were still alive today, I&#39;d be praying he&#39;d never learn about fanfiction. The poor man would have never recover.<br><br>One tiny nitpick, if I may. &quot;... and proceeded to pantomime raping the passive, fully clothed girl.&quot; Shouldn&#39;t that be &quot;... and proceeded to pantomime rape&quot;?<br><br>Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I must go inform Clear Dawnlight, &#39;scuse me, Safireix, and Zelda-Queen of this mission. *storms off to do so*</p>

            <p>Are we sure someone wasn&#39;t taking cues from &quot;legolas&quot; by laura? &#39;Cause I gotta tell you, although it seems to diverge as it goes on, that opening sequence is darn similar.<br><br>I caught a couple of things you might want to fix:<br><br>1.  “She… he… Oh.” <font color="red">Az</font> the Legolas impersonator stepped out of the cadaver . . . <br><br>2.  Before Az knew what was happening, Aragon had run Frodo through with his sword – which appeared to be a bad replica of the Movieverse <font color="red">Anduin</font> –<br><br>Other than that, good work!

Still, with a reader base as constantly changing as this, it&#39;s not a bad idea to keep new readers in mind, as long as you don&#39;t try to contrive an explanation where it wouldn&#39;t make sense for the story or characters.<br><br>I am supposed to be working right now, so I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to leave it there.

            <p>Dear Permission givers, I humbly request Permission to write PPC spin-offs.<br><br>My agents:<br><br>Teddy Leach:<br>A man in his mid 20&#39;s, skilled in the arts of sarcasm and stating the obvious. His entire knowledge of how to use a firearm comes from the arcades, and he knows even less about fencing and fighting with any form of close-range weapon. He is very much the type to let brute force solve a problem, rather than tip-toe around it. He has an evil twin who was created in an obscure scientific process. Said twin often tries to kill him, usually after periods of being deceptively nice. So far, he has not succeeded.<br><br>Bertram Axil:<br>A PPC agent in the Department of Floaters who has been active for three years. Or a close approximation of three years, given the notoriously shonky measurement of time in Headquarters. Unlike Teddy, he has more actual skill with weapons than perceived skill, and is also generally much calmer. He speaks with a strange speech defect where he will stress words seemingly at random. He is completely unaware of it, despite being repeatedly told and asked about it. While much calmer than Teddy, he is also much more careful, although not afraid to lash out at someone if threatened.<br><br>My Permission piece is here: <a href="http://manwithstuff.blogspot.com/2011/04/introduction-of-sorts.html"><a href="http://manwithstuff.blogspot.com/2011/04/introduction-of-sorts.html">http://manwithstuff.blogspot.com/2011/04/introduction-of-sorts.html</a></a><br><br>The fic I intend to challenge is here: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5810836/1/Broken_Pieces"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5810836/1/Broken_Pieces">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5810836/1/Broken_Pieces</a></a><br><br>My greatest and most heartfelt thanks to Phobos and Cassie Cameron-Young for the valuable beta-reading!</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I&#39;m giving this a No, at least for the time being. Although your grammar and spelling is decent, your agents don&#39;t seem to have much of the lighthearted humor vibe that we try for, generally speaking. Honestly, I didn&#39;t feel your characters really had enough depth to make for a good spin-off - your characterization of the Marquis de Sod also felt somewhat off. I would recommend reading more spin-offs in that Department to gain more of a feel of his personality. This is not a permanent denial, and you&#39;re welcome to try again when you feel you have a better handle on the air of the PPC. Like I said, definitely recommend reading more spin-offs, especially in the Department of Floaters. Good luck with further fanfiction efforts, and on your next application!</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been considering doing a few missions within the perview of this department, but the trouble is that it feels a little too limited. Parody is a very specific genre, which limits the overall usefulness of the DBP. Yes, the DBP wiki page says that it also covers trollfics, but that still doesn&#39;t give potential agents a great deal to do. <br><br>I would like to propose that the department be renamed as the Department of Bad Comedy. It would cover not only bad parody and trollfics but also more conventional humor-based stories and crackfic.<br><br>Thoughts? Questions? Criticisms? Cake?</p>

            <p>Honestly, I don&#39;t see the point of this new department.  Humor is incredibly subjective, after all.  Some people love puns, some people hate them.  One person&#39;s funny may not be funny to someone else.<br><br>The problem is what makes Bad Comedy bad?  Is it the spelling, punctuation and grammar?  There is a Department of Technical Errors for that.  There is probably a department for anything else you can list for why the comedic fic is bad.  So, I don&#39;t see that we need this department.<br><br>Also, the Department of WTF covers Crackfic already, so that is an unnecessary move, as well. </p>

            <p>Stale comedy cliches, overreliance on a single joke, mishandled gallows humor or dead baby comedy, sacrificing of plotline and characterization for jokes, abusing non sequiturs... does that cover a few possibilities or what might be considered bad comedy?<br><br>Also, it should be noted that nothing on the Department of WTF&#39;s wiki page says anything about crackfic.

            <p>For example, we see a lot of recognized (by us, at least) badfics with positive reviews.

            <p>I feel that it&#39;s not just the presence of those thing, but it has to do with execution and timing. While something might be funny in Invader Zim or South Park, is it funny when a 12 year old screams it over and over again because she thinks it&#39;s funny?<br><br>Bad humor is bad not because it contains something, but because that something is misused. Dead baby comedy can be funny, but in the right context and not for the sake of itself. When humor is not funny, when it is annoying. Like when somebody explains the joke. Or when somebody jokes about something tragic that just happened. <br><br>It&#39;s stupid, boring, inane, mindless, repetitive, etc. <br><br>The only thing that I think makes for bad comedy just by subject alone is a VAST IGNORANCE of a subject. Those who think blood and gore are wacky and funny (How about I CUT OFF HIS HEAD AND KILL HIM LOL) or those who think self harm is funny (LOL THAT EMO IS SO FAT I BET SHE HAS TO SLIT HER WRISTS WITH A CHAINSAW LOL)... and other offenses. Those things aren&#39;t funny, but show that if the person is making the joke thinks it&#39;s funny there might be something wrong with them... ._.;</p>

            <p>Technically ALL badfic could be considered subjectively bad. If that weren&#39;t the case, then every writer of a Mary Sue or of Bad Slash would have been jeered off of the internet as soon as they appeared. If quality were simply a matter of the facts, then there wouldn&#39;t be any need for the PPC.<br><br>There are people out there who think that Mary Sue is a shining exemplar of feminism.

            <p>We can demonstrate why Mary Sues and bad slash are bad.  There are rules of characterization and language usage.  It is far less subjective than bad comedy.  That was my other point in my first post.  The comedy is subjective, the SPaG is not.  It is better to focus on that.<br><br>I will also point out that being a Mary Sue is not enough of a charge to warrant a mission.  Just being not funny, in one person&#39;s opinion, isn&#39;t enough.  There has to be something more.<br><br>And on a different note, your argument seems to be an attempt to make all arguments, on both sides, invalid.  If everything is subjective, then what are we even doing here?  That argument shuts down the entire debate by leaving no solid ground to base any argument on.  Tell me why your case is valid, not why all cases aren&#39;t.</p>

            <p>You know, that might be an interesting idea. DBP could become the Bad Parody Division, and a humor department could take over.<br><br>We are generally slow to change departmental structure, though. If it&#39;s decided that this isn&#39;t too good an idea, it&#39;s entirely possible to create a new Department of Bad Comedy and have it be a sister department to DBP, with agents often being passed back and forth between them.</p>

            <p>18 doesn&#39;t seem to be a universal age-of-majority in the US.  My nephew&#39;s parents had to sign the paperwork for a trip he&#39;s taking because he doesn&#39;t turn 19 until a few months after the trip.  Just guessing here, but maybe they picked 21 to be sure they covered all the local laws.</p>

            <p>I guess it depends on the kind of cactus? Of the three currently chilling in my kitchen, one likes to stab me, one is only mildly grumpy, and the third actually has spikes soft enough that it&#39;s, uh, pettable. <br><br>The author in question is Mike Shepherd.

However, there are lots of people and especially Flowers missing. What this means is that we couldn&#39;t find where the heck they came from or any other mention of them in actual PPC writings, either because said writings never existed, or they vanished, or--most likely--no one ever put a link to them anywhere useful, like the character&#39;s wiki page. (Hint: all character pages ought to have links to the materials they appear in.) This is why we need your help, and by &quot;you&quot; I mean &quot;everyone who has Permission and/or knows where to find things.&quot;<br><br>To begin with, check the article&#39;s <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:Glossary_of_PPC_Characters">talk page</a> to see if your characters or any that you recognize are on the list of Characters with No Appearances. If they are, and they do appear somewhere, you need to make sure to link to the places they appear on their wiki page and then move them onto the list--or, if you&#39;re not comfortable with that, tell Aster or myself where to find them.<br><br>If you have characters there who don&#39;t actually appear in writing anywhere, you should consider taking them off the wiki, since as far as PPC continuity is concerned, they don&#39;t actually exist (yet). It&#39;s a bit silly to have articles for characters who don&#39;t exist.<br><br>We haven&#39;t gotten around to checking all the Flowers yet, I think mostly because we&#39;re just plain scared of the gaping chasm of information about their origins, since so many were brought about here on the Board with no actual use of them in a mission or interlude. Help in that area is particularly appreciated.<br><br>You may also notice that we&#39;ve redirected a buttload of pages to the Glossary. This is because said pages only contained the information that appears in the Glossary anyway, and a bunch of stub articles looks unfinished and bleh. If you&#39;d like to remake a page for anyone, please do, but make sure to fill it out with more than just their department, partner, writer, and links.<br><br>For more details about the Glossary, see the page itself. There&#39;s a thorough description of how to use it, which you should read because it&#39;s there to be read.<br><br>If you have questions, feel free to ask here or on the talk page.<br><br>Oh, and one last thing. <b>LOG IN WHEN YOU EDIT THE WIKI.</b> Thank you.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So, I am currently at work on a Mission for the Brother Cadfael continuum, and there is a mini involved. Checking on the Wiki, I find that the Mini-type for the Brother Cadfael continuum is a Mini-Jerome. However, there is no recorded instance of this Mini appearing, and I can&#39;t find any previous missions in the Cadfael continuum, let alone where it came from. Not only that, but the character in question, Brother Jerome, is not really Evil in so much as just sort of an annoying kiss-ass to a character who opposes the will of the protagonist. <br><br>Since it would appear that I&#39;m the first person to write a mission for the continuum, and since Jerome just doesn&#39;t seem to fit, given the facts, I am here to petition a change of Mini for this canon. <br><br>To this end, I propose that the Minis for this continuum be changed to simply a miniature version of the character being misspelled, not unlike those of the NCIS continuum.  <br><br>Please? </p>

            <p>There are two Cadfael fics in my future. One of them, entitled &quot;Independence&quot;, is basically ripping off the plot of the Leper of St. Giles thus-far (right down to one of the Sue&#39;s guardians being named &quot;Agnes&quot;), and has the (rather innocuous) Mini named &quot;Cadfaels&quot;.

            <p>where the first person to come across a misspelled name in a badfic felt the mini should be put up for adoption on the board, even though they didn&#39;t even set out on a rescue mission for said mini.<br><br>I think it&#39;s widely agreed among PPC&#39;ers that the first one to write a mission in a continuum that comes across a mini gets to name it. (Kind of like how European explorers went around the world naming places even though others had been there first; those others weren&#39;t on a mission.) So, I agree with you that you should get to name the Brother Cadfael minis. </p>

            <p>Great touches:  The mini-Lincoln&#39;s tiny, yet charismatic voice, and way of speaking.<br><br>Rachel&#39;s calm assertion that she has to learn to cope with this stuff, but permission to go throw up as she wasn&#39;t coping as well as she&#39;d like--it was a character building break in her extreme enthusiasm.<br><br>The mini-Stu attacking Laura.  I&#39;ve seen mini Sues or Stus mentioned before, but I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ve seen one be so immediately  hostile. That immediate hostility really makes sense. The mini-Stu is outside the story, so he can instantly see the other elements that are outside the story, like the agents.<br><br>The part where Rachel misses all the warning signs of an imminent explosion from Laura.  I really thought she had just killed the bit Stu when Danny heard all the pops. I was wondering what kind of trouble they&#39;d be in now, so I was rather relieved when she hadn&#39;t killed him.<br><br>The Capital Mortuary trick was inspired. It reminded me of the psychic paper trick that the Doctor does, but I never would have thought of trying it in a mission.<br><br>The dessert coma suit that the one guy was wearing--both disgusting and brilliant.<br><br><br>I don&#39;t know the Fallout verse at all, but this sounded really, really bad from a canon point of view. The original grammar and language usage was truly revolting.  I don&#39;t know how you get through such butchering of the English language in your missions.  The mini-Stu and dessert coma outfit guy kills were a little violent for my tastes, but fit in well with the agents and (guessing based on other video games I do know, which would make those look very tame) video game deaths.<br><br>I didn&#39;t remember Danny carrying a sledgehammer.  I don&#39;t why I didn&#39;t remember, but I like that he is using a much less common weapon. The sledgehammer combined with his kind of proper and quiet manner is really nice.<br><br>Nothing stood out to me as needing improvement, so I don&#39;t have anything else to add, I guess. Except maybe, nice mission.</p>

            <p>Pretty good- certainly easier to read than the fic itself. I had a quick look at the author&#39;s profile and it seems like he/she/it has another semi-illegible Fallout fic as well as a Hellsing fic.

            <p>Do you know if the person who&#39;s reporting you is the same one each time? If so, maybe we could use something to track their IP address and figure out who it is. From there, we may be able to find that person and ask why he or she wants your site down so badly. At the moment, we can&#39;t say if the person responsible is a Suethor with a grudge or a self-appointed moral guardian who simply wants to wipe everything less family friendly than the Teletubbies off the internet (for the good of the children, of course).

            <p>It would be something like Pruno or any other prison wine. PPC agents can get all kinds of booze, but sugar seems to be harder to come by, and someone might try to homebrew soda. I can picture it now: distilling sugar from dried fruit, stealing equipment from DoSAT to carbonate it, selling it under the table disguised as bottles of Bleepka . . . Probably one of those things where if you&#39;re lucky, it doesn&#39;t have any taste at all.</p>

            <p>I just googled up instructions for homemade root beer: <a href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/ROOTBEER_Jn0.htm"><a href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/ROOTBEER_Jn0.htm">http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/ROOTBEER_Jn0.htm</a></a> .<br><br>It&#39;s a fermented drink, so there <em>is</em> some alcohol present.  I&#39;m not seeing anything for the soft drink version (non-alcoholic) of root beer, but carbonated water was being made in the late 1700s.  You could probably make something on the line of an old-time phosphate soda fairly easily in your RC.<br><br>...or, you can remember to pack a luggage carrier the next time you visit a modern-day &#39;verse and raid a grocery store.</p>

            <p>My husband has made homemade rootbeer with my kids.  It is really good tasting. The alcohol content comes from being carbonated naturally, by the action of yeast.  It is really small, like .25% ABV.  If you homebrew beer, the easiest way to carbonate the beer is the same, add in a bit more yeast and sugar when you bottle the beer. Wait a couple of weeks for the pressure to build up, and there you go.  It does leave a tiny bit of of sediment in the bottom of the bottle, so you leave just a bit of the beer in the bottom while pouring.<br><br>So, all you never cared to know about brewing.  :D</p>

            <p>You don&#39;t know what else has been in the soda machines in the HQ cafeteria.<br><br>Also, this is a funny sentiment that soda is rarer than booze- for several reasons. One, you can get booze from most continuums, soda only from a few. Second, Suefics rarely mention soda unless the Sue or the Sue&#39;s friends are drinking it... and you don&#39;t want to drink that. Third, an odd trend I have noticed is that Mary Sues often &#39;forget to eat&#39; and by that I mean skip over mealtimes unless they&#39;re needed to fawn more completely over a canon character. I can&#39;t recall any canon instances of a Sue standing in a supermarket, or opening up a refrigerator, or even just sitting in a restaurant. Or even getting take-out!<br><br>So you may be onto something that real soda might be rare. I&#39;m sure that the PPC bleepka bar has it in bulk from World One, for use in certain bleepdrinks... but with the way HQ is who knows how easy getting there is, much less paying for it...<br><br>... <br><br>You have been writing PPC Missions too long when you begin seriously considering how to attain a cherry coca-cola in HQ, and realize it&#39;s nearly impossible. Or perhaps you have not been writing the missions <i>long enough</i>...</p>

            <p>I mean, the agents may be insane, but most of them still have their instincts for self-preservation. There&#39;s no way HQ food or drink is completely on the level.<br><br>You make a good point, though: soda only crops up in a few continuua, whereas alcohol is practically universal. I have seen Sues order take-out (Candie the Sk8r Girl called for pizza, I remember), but it&#39;s rare. It&#39;d be easier for agents to get drunk than buzzed.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s probably easier for agents who work in the modern-day continua, like crime dramas or anywhere where the inhabitants of that &#39;Verse regularly are shown eating normal food, to get soda and things like that. Take NCIS, for example: Team Gibbs is regularly shown eating food and drinking soda, not to mention Abby and her Caf-Pow! addiction, as well as the vending machines in the break room, so there&#39;d be ample opportunities for someone to snag some soda when no one&#39;s looking.</p>

            <p>I play a lot of video games.  Lately, I have been playing Megaman X Collection, which contains the six games in that series.  I have currently beaten three of the six.  Also on the list of games I am playing (I switch from one to the next) are Skies of Arcadia Legends, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time (Master Quest), Megaman Anniversary Collection, Soul Caliber 2, and Team Fortress 2.<br><br>When I am not playing video games I tend to read webcomics, meme sites, and the like.  I also take walks and play any sort of game you can throw at me.<br><br>Up until recently, the biggest timesink I had was Theatre.  I was rehearsing or performing every day for a couple of months.</p>

            <p>First, the obvious: I work from home as a freelancer, but I&#39;m subcontracted to one company right now, which means I&#39;m effectively on-duty 25/8. If I ever go on a killing spree, it&#39;ll be because of that.<br><br>The non-work timesink, though, is puzzle games.

            <p>Amazing Adventures is pretty much a pure HOG with a few other puzzles sprinkled in, no real storyline.  The earlier Hidden Expedition games were the same way; they had a storyline with some real potential in Devil&#39;s Triangle, but it ended on a &quot;to be continued&quot; and it&#39;s been over a year with no sign of the sequel.<br><br>Have you looked at the Drawn games?</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t—<i>can&#39;t</i>—stand it when a character is said to be something (like a genius) and is absolutely never shown to actually express that trait in any way.  This one, rather than merely failing to be a genius, <i>breaks the laws of physics</i> to make it so.  Cannot <i>stand</i> it.<br><br>One thing I want to bring up is Orken&#39;s stepping on Thomas&#39; feet.  Obviously, it makes sense for Orken to stop Thomas from charging into the meeting in some way.  I found it to get a little too repetitive, though, especially within that single scene.  I can see it happening two or three times, but the fact that Orken had to keep doing it, and with increasing strength each time to the point that it broke poor Thomas&#39; toes, feels a little over the top to me.  Maybe it&#39;s just that Thomas is still a relatively new character, and I don&#39;t understand the sheer depth of love he has for Stargate characters, but it seems unlikely to me that he keeps trying to charge the room, especially after the first toe is broken.</p>

            <p>Hm, I see what you&#39;re saying, but Thomas&#39; love for the Stargate &#39;verse is modeled on mine, and my reaction to each new stupidity inducing turn the fic took. It was partially because, in the scene you mentioned in particular, the Stu came up with more and more ways to be stupid. I might have done the same in his place. Or not. I&#39;m sort of a wimp. <br><br>There&#39;s that, and he has the restraint and ability to think ahead of a two year old. For example, the AK-47 served no useful purpose, he just wanted to bring it with him. Sure, it worked well for me (and gave me the title of the story) but his lack of restraint and ability to see the consequences of his actions is part of what makes him do the things he does. He is ruled by his emotions. If the Stu is making him angry, by god he is going to charge him. He would not think about the consequences until after his toes have been stomped. <br><br>That being said, it is more than a bit repetitive. In the future, I&#39;ll keep that in mind. <br><br>Does that make sense? It does to me. I think it&#39;s in character for someone like Thomas to try to do something like charging the room, even after he should know that Orken will just stomp his foot, but is probably mediocre writing, and not something I am likely to repeat to this extent. <br><br>Thanks for the crit. It made me think, and that is a good thing.</p>

            <p>Congrats on the first mission. I like it. {= )<br><br>First, a few things I noticed:<br><br>1. When the mini-Unas wakes Orken up, you mention him having to get his heart rate under control. I&#39;m not that familiar with the canon, so I could be wrong, but I thought the point of the disguises was that they wouldn&#39;t have a heart rate that the Stu could detect...?<br><br>2. A couple of missing apostrophes around the &quot;Another Excellent Chapter&quot; author&#39;s note; one before it (authors instead of author&#39;s), one after (Suethors instead of Suethor&#39;s).<br><br>3. &quot;Rouge NID&quot; is meant to be &quot;Rogue NID,&quot; yes?<br><br>4. This is for everybody: it&#39;s &quot;all right,&quot; two words; literally, everything is correct. &quot;Alright&quot; happens because we think it should work the same way as &quot;although,&quot; but the &quot;al&quot; there takes the medieval sense of &quot;even,&quot; so it doesn&#39;t really. It&#39;s so widespread that in most cases no one will notice, but since we&#39;re concerned with correctness here, it&#39;s something to keep in mind.<br><br>That out of the way, in general I thought this was a good mission for establishing the baseline for the characters. I think I&#39;m echoing the previous posters when I say I&#39;d like to see Orken get more ruffled by Thomas, but I think it&#39;s important to show what&#39;s normal for them before you start breaking them down, so it&#39;s cool for a first mission. {= )<br><br>The Stu... I just.... Look, people, if you&#39;re going to write a character who&#39;s supposed to be really smart, you have to do the dang research, or it all falls apart as soon as you run into a reader who actually knows anything about the subject you&#39;re talking about. Argh. Was his internet signal supposed to be squiggly, or adaptive to the multiple layers of shifting atoms in the rock...? I mean, I&#39;m pretty sure a wireless signal has to be continuous to be any good, right? You can&#39;t just break it apart and expect it to work properly. Gah.<br><br>Things I particularly liked include the conversation with Mitchell when the agents stepped in as guards, the attention given to keeping the Stu from noticing the agents, and the description of being flung from wherever they were to Cheyenne Mountain. I have trouble with Mitchell because I&#39;m a <i>Farscape</i> fan first and foremost, so I have a lot of trouble seeing him as anything but an alternate universe version of John Crichton, but even with that the exchange felt in character, even with his intelligence nerfed, and it was a nice break from the Stu being dumb. I think we rely a little too much on the SEP field at times (I know I&#39;m guilty of that), so the reminder that we should actually worry about this is well taken. And, well, silly things happening to the agents is always good. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I know it&#39;s in common use. That&#39;s fine. However, widely used does not equal appropriate in all contexts, which was my point. I&#39;m looking at my <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i> (15th edition) right now, and on page 199 under the section Word Usage, it lists:<br><br>   <b>all right.</b> Two words. Avoid <i>alright</i>.<br><br>Considering that the CMS is the standard for most if not all generally respected publishing houses, at least in this country, I&#39;ll take their advice and pass it on to others when it comes to contexts in which we want our writing skills to be taken seriously.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s informal spelling, and an informal word in speech. <br><br>Considering that it&#39;s passed completely into general modern usage, and that it is at this point its own word, saying it shouldn&#39;t be used in writing is akin to saying you shouldn&#39;t use contractions when writing because they&#39;re not technically correct either.<br><br>If it was used in dialogue, you&#39;re being far too persnickety for saying he should change it.<br><br>This is relatively light fiction writing; if he was writing some sort of essay or non-fiction work that didn&#39;t involve quoting anyone at all I would agree, but it&#39;s out of place as a suggestion in this context.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the catching of errors. Before Caddy beta&#39;d it, I also had a &quot;nuclear missile lodge.&quot; Although now I really want to see Rouge NID.

            <p>This is a good first mission. I can see that these agents have a lot of potential, especially in regards to their working relationship. There&#39;s an Odd-Couple-esque vibe to them that I always like to see in a partnership.<br><br>The bit with the radio wave fail!logic was delightfully hilarious. Nice catch with that one.<br><br>The one major stumbling point for me was the banter. I&#39;m a big fan of good interagent banter and it seemed a little weak here. I can&#39;t put my finger on why, exactly.

            <p>A while ago I deleted all the badfic from the unclaimed list that had been on that list for more than 18 months. What you are proposing to do, sounds to me like you are going to collect a lot of badfic, most of which is going to sit on the unclaimed list for a very long time, until there is another age-purge.<br><br>Thrawling sections of the pit for badfic is okay, but there is no need to put all the badfic you encounter on the unclaimed list. Just limit it to the stuff of which you think &quot;this could be a good mission, but I can&#39;t write it&quot;. And no, that doesn&#39;t include every badfic you will encounter.<br><br>I&#39;m just saying this because I don&#39;t want the unclaimed list on the wiki get even more unmanageable than it already is. The longer it is, the longer it takes to load, and I think, the less likely it will be that someone will go through the list to find badfic. Making a long unclaimed list is actually counterproductive. Besides, we already have FFnet as a quick and easy source to find badfic.<br><br>---<br><br>All that said, editing the wiki is easy. Just click on the Edit link. I believe it now has WYSIWYG editing. For the unclaimed list, click the edit link of the Hetallia subheading. </p>

            <p>Your enthusiasm is fantastic, but I wanted to point something out before you continued crawling through the dross of Hetalia fanfiction. It&#39;s a problem I&#39;ve been wrestling with without success for a while now. You see, the main characters within Hetalia are all anthropomorphic personifications. According to the tenuous tapestry of PPC canon, APs cannot be neuralyzed. In the PPC wiki&#39;s article on the Death of the Discworld it specifically says &#39;Due to his nature as an Anthropomorphic Personification, Death cannot be neuralyzed (although he is very good about playing along).&#39; We could just ignore that fact and say that the Hetalia nations are somehow different APs and thus can be neuralyzed, but that feels like a cheat.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong. My intention is not to rain on your parade. I just wanted the problem that I had trying to do Hetalia missions out there to see if you or anyone else had ideas in how to deal with that fact.</p>

            <p>Usually an anthropomorphic personification exists to service a particular canon. Like, what would Discworld be if Death permanently went away? What would Hetalia be like if suddenly there was no Germany? Usually because these characters represent concepts, taking them away ALSO REMOVES or REALLY MESSES UP the concept.<br><br>Remember in Avatar: the Airbender when Tui the Moon Spirit was killed? Yeah. The whole power of the moon went away until she was replaced.<br><br>If you do make one of these, you had best make them something from a dead canon, a mini-fic blip, an unpublished novel, or some other place where they won&#39;t be missed.</p>

            <p>I debated whether <a href="http://ppc.timescale.nl/34ateam.html"> Winners No Matter What</a> should be classed as a Sue mission or a troll mission. There&#39;s five Sues, there&#39;s script format, there&#39;s not a trace of characterisation. Enjoy.</p>

            <p>Those Sues were . . . <i>bad.</i> That&#39;s like, &quot;Sisterhood&quot;-level bad. I&#39;m tempted to agree it was a trollfic, but I&#39;ve met actual people who consider this good writing, so I&#39;m still on the fence.<br><br>Overall, I really enjoyed the PPCing. Always a pleasure to see horrendous characters who screw with genuine badasses like the A-Team get what&#39;s coming to them. Mind if I offer a little bit of critique, though? I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing more of your agents&#39; characterization; it seemed like things were whipping through at a fairly quick pace, and it&#39;d be nice to expand on the scenario and their reactions to it a bit more. Just my two cents. :)</p>

            <p>I started writing that mission a while ago and then stopped because I didn&#39;t think it was good enough. I thought badfic had eaten my funny. Or quite possibly my characters&#39; personalities. It was their 34th mission in A-Team; they&#39;ve seen it all (actually, they haven&#39;t seen five Sues that share a single personality.) I&#39;ve noticed that their personalities come out way better in the first few missions in a new fandom. At least, that seemed to be the case when I first started writing SGA and later NCIS missions.<br><br>There&#39;s another A-Team mission that I&#39;ve started, but am unlikely to finish. The agents&#39; responses are just too bland.</p>

It turns out that Zorc is back and is ticked off at Bakura, so Bakura wants everyone to help him fight Zorc, who is now in the 21st century. They agree, since nobody particularly wants the world to get destroyed. That makes sense, right? Well, then we find out Bakura&#39;s OTHER reason for wanting everyone&#39;s help: Zorc has kidnapped his beloved little sister. This sister of his is a Mary Sue, everyone seems to jump in and out of character, after a few chapters the story randomly shifts to script format, the punctuation sucks, and the author is clearly a Bakura fan, and the favoritism is a bit annoying. Also, Zorc is spelled as &quot;Zork&quot; for the first half of the story (the author starts spelling it &quot;Zorc&quot; halfway through a chapter, too, and doesn&#39;t bother to go back and change the spelling in the first half of the chapter.)</p>

            <p>There would only be one mini created in this case.  In the past, if a misspelling is used that often, the mini might take the place of the character in question, due to the fact that the Author is using the mini&#39;s name instead of the character&#39;s.<br><br>As for &quot;Zork&quot;, I believe it would be a mini-Zorc due to him actually being a monster.

            <p>I&#39;ve only ever read stories where one mini was created, even though the name was misspelled so many times. The minis reacted rather strongly each time a character said their misspelled name, as if they were trying to run towards the person who said it.</p>

            <p>When I see something like this, what I usually do is that if the agents fail to capture the mini, it shows up again and again and again, like a tiny stunt double in a bad low budget movie. If it&#39;s been captured, everybody just pretends the Mini is there and pantomimes around where the mini or character should be.<br><br>The way I write it, when people interact with a mini when there should be a character there (Say they&#39;re yelling at Zorc, and not Zork), it looks an awful like little kids playing the scene as &#39;pretend&#39; with a stuffed animal instead of a real character. You know, like when kids set up tea parties with stuffed animals and things instead of guests. :)<br><br>When it&#39;s just mentioned though, it simply skitters across stage, wondering who called its name. &gt;_&gt;</p>

            <p>I read about this yesterday, but couldn&#39;t think of anything to say. In a way, I still can&#39;t.
