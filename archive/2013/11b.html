            <p>Well, technically, an author rec. This author is Lynse (<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2045639/Lynse"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2045639/Lynse">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2045639/Lynse</a></a>), and she writes wonderful fic. Her Doctor Who crossovers are, in my opinion, as good as The Man With No Name, and I&#39;m really very fond of The Man With No Name. The Tenth Doctor is so very in-character it&#39;s scary, they&#39;re all brilliantly plotted out, the technobabble is incredible, and she has this habit of misleading both the Doctor and the audience. Never assume is a rule when reading her work.<br><br>Of course, those aren&#39;t only things she&#39;s written. Go take a peek.<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>...And I liked it. Alot. <br><br>Since I&#39;m in a critique mood right now, I will give some criticism. I felt like the story repeated itself quite a bit, though that was tied into the message of the fic. Drill it into their heads and such. I also felt that the kids were slightly ooc, mostly in how they spoke, but it was not too bad. <br><br>That aside though, it was very well made, and I do not regret reading it. The Doctor&#39;s voice was perfect, and the way the fic tied the begining and end together was brilliant. The author has skill, I will say that much.</p>

            <p>...but I&#39;ve been PMing with her, and apparently that&#39;s the one that&#39;s not like the others. For one thing, there&#39;s nothing bad happening to the Doctor&#39;s timeline, and, as far as I know, nothing giving him a headache. And no twists. *shrug*<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>We&#39;ve all heard about such books as &#39;Pride and Prejudice and Zombies&#39;, even if we haven&#39;t read them. They take a public-domain novel (such as, er, <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>), keep most of the original text intact, but add a distinctly modern plot to it (such as zombies, or in the case of &#39;Android Karenina&#39;... well, you get the point). At least I think that&#39;s how they work. I haven&#39;t read any of them.<br><br><i>Anyway</i>. My thought was - why should they only add <i>interesting</i> plot points? Surely there&#39;s a market for taking the fantastic and the bizarre and slotting something incredibly mundane in there?<br><br>Well... no. No there isn&#39;t. That&#39;s stupid.<br><br><i>But</i>, maybe there&#39;s a PPC Board game in it. So here it is: Swords &amp; Sorcery &amp; Stockbrokers.<br><br>The rules are simple. Take a fantasy, sci-fi, supernatural, or otherwise non-&#39;mundane&#39; novel. Add to or edit the title to indicate the presence of something really, really boring from the modern world. Then take an excerpt from the book and edit it accordingly.<br><br>Since it wouldn&#39;t be much of a game if I didn&#39;t get to play, I&#39;ve even prepared two examples.<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b>Lawyers of the Lord of the Rings</b><br><br>In rode the Lord of the N.A.Z.P.D. A great black shape against the fire engines beyond he loomed up, grown to a vast menace of despair. In rode the Lord of the N.A.Z.P.D., under the archway that no enemy ever yet had brought a warrant to pass, and all fled before his face.<br><br>All save one. There waiting, silent and still in the space before the Gate, sat Detective Inspector Gandalf upon Shadowfax: Shadowfax who alone among the properly licenced horses of the earth endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast as a graven image constructed with appropriate planning permission in Rath Dínen.<br><br>&quot;You cannot enter here,&quot; said D.I. Gandalf, and the huge shadow halted. &quot;You are out of your jurisdiction. Go back to the abyss prepared for you! Go back! Fall into the obscurity and nothingness that awaits you and your Master when you fail to close this case. Go!&quot; <br><br>The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown; and yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter.<br><br>&quot;Old fool!&quot; he said. &quot;Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know higher authority when you see it? Retire now and curse in vain, for I am now with the Arda Bureau of Invesitgations!&quot; And with that he lifted high his badge and flames ran across the emblem.<br><br>And in that very moment, away behind in some courtyard of the city, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking nothing of law nor of rivalry, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn.<br><br>And as if in answer there came from far away another note. Sirens, sirens, sirens. In dark Mindolluin&#39;s sides they dimly echoed. Great sirens of the north wildly blowing. Rohan’s street cops had come at last.<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b>High Finance Wizardry</b> (Book 3 of the Young Financial Wizards series)<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t tell me she&#39;s <i>still</i> in the toilet,&quot; Nita muttered, annoyed. <i>Reading the financial pages, probably. One of these days she&#39;s gonna fall in.</i> She went back the way she had come, past the stairs, to the ladies&#39; room. It was not only cold down here, there was a draft - a banker’s draft, stuck to the door. Nita pocketed the check - there was no point being wasteful. She grabbed the handle of the door and pulled; it resisted her slightly, and there was a faint <i>hoo</i> noise, air sliding through the door crack as she tugged. &quot;Dari? Come on, we&#39;re leaving! The markets closed ten minutes ago!&quot; Nita pulled harder, the door came open-<br><br>Air blew hard past her and ruffled her hair into her eyes. Bitter cold smote the front of her, and in it the humidity in the air condensed out instantly, whipping past Nita through the sucking air as stinging, dust-fine snow. The banker’s draft was pulled from her pocket and drawn through, despite Nita’s attempts to grab it.<br><br>Nita was looking through the doorway into a low rust red wasteland: nothing but stones in all sizes, cracked, tumbled, piled, with dun dust blowing between them, and not a bank or stock exchange to be seen. Close, much too close to be normal, lay a horizon hazed in blood brown, shading up through translucent brick color, rose, violet, a hard dark blue, and above everything, black with stars showing. Low in the crystalline rose burned a small pinkish sun, fierce, distant looking, and cold. Nita flinched from the unsoftened sight of it, from the long, harsh shadows it laid out behind every smallest stone, and most of all from the hideous, soul-crushing thought of how expensive it would be to repair the fixtures and fittings. She slammed the ladies&#39; room door shut. Air kept moaning past her, through the cracks, out into the dry wasteland, probably wreaking havoc on the lifetime of the air conditioning.<br><br>&quot;Mars,&quot; she breathed, and terror grabbed her heart and squeezed. &quot;She went to <i>Mars</i>... and she didn’t even file for expenses!&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>A good idea, and well executed I think. <br><br>I preferred &#39;Lawyers&#39;, but I think that&#39;s mostly just because I was familiar with the original material - I&#39;ve never read the <i>Young Wizards</i> books. <br><br>I would join in, but sadly the only titles I can think of are based on films or other non-novel things that would make the &#39;adapt it accordingly&#39; part a little tricky. That said, if you were interested in a game of <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons &amp; Dentists</i>, I could probably run one :P<br><br>Also, I couldn&#39;t help but notice that &#39;<i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i>&#39; sort of sounds like it&#39;s already received this treatment, just based on the title alone.<br><br>Also also, when you referred to a &#39;PPC Board game&#39; my initial thought was that you meant an in-universe board game, like PPC Cluedo is, not a game that could be played on the PPC Board.<br></p>

            <p>In addition to the various online writing guides that can be found, there is another source of useful info: online guides for role-players, specifically those aimed at Games Masters. <br><br>A GM faces a similar challenge to an author, in that they both have to convey everything they are supposed to be experiencing to their players/readers.

            <p>Is your friend good at describing weather, but needs help with other things, or does he need help describing weather? This may not ultimately make much difference, since good description exists independently of the thing you&#39;re describing, but it might help me and others come up with apt examples. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p><i>Disclaimer: What follows is purely my personal opinion, based on my own experience, and may in fact be made up on the spot. Your Mileage May Vary. Take what works for you, leave the rest.</i><br><br>So, the thing about descriptions is that you need to understand what you&#39;re trying to do before you start. Because you&#39;re using words, you have to accept right off the bat that you&#39;re never going to be able to cram in all the details that your senses would pick up, and you shouldn&#39;t try. Visually speaking, descriptions in writing are not like photographs; they&#39;re more like impressionist paintings. The goal is not to be 100% perfect, the goal is to be good enough that your reader&#39;s brain can fill in the gaps. And they will, if you give them enough to work with.<br><br>Part of that is using the right tools for the job. You want to select words that say precisely what you want so you don&#39;t have to use lots of extra words beating around the bush; but at the same time, you <i>don&#39;t</i> want to worry about the precise words so much that you lose your audience. It&#39;s all well and good to know about the coruscating astral bodies in the crepuscular aubergine vault, but you&#39;ll get a lot further with your readers if you tell them about stars twinkling in the sky at dusk, because everyone knows what those words mean and they&#39;ve all seen the evening sky before.<br><br>On a related note, it helps to describe things in terms of what your audience is already likely to be familiar with, and this is where metaphor and simile come in. This is pretty much the only way to describe smells, too, which tend to be the most overlooked despite being incredibly important. Again, it&#39;s one thing to try telling your readers about the pungent aroma of petrichor, but a far better thing to tell them it smells like the earth after it rains. Just about everybody can relate to that without needing to know a bunch of fancy words.<br><br>Another thing to keep in mind is that you&#39;re not just trying to put a picture or sound or smell in your readers&#39; heads; you&#39;re trying to make them feel something. How people feel about an apple is likely to be very different from how they feel about a stop sign, so if you&#39;re looking for a way to tell us about the color of a girl&#39;s lipstick, think carefully about how you want us to feel about her. Stop-sign red is a warning; apple red is an invitation.<br><br>The right verbs are important when you&#39;re describing things in action, and this is a place where you really do need to worry about precision. To take an example from <a href="http://obafu.livejournal.com/5749.html">this essay</a> about writing fight scenes, there&#39;s a big difference between <i>hitting</i> someone and <i>smashing</i> your fist into their jaw. You must also avoid passive voice like the plague. This is tricky to get a grip on, but in a nutshell, it&#39;s the difference between &quot;Steve punched Joe&quot; and &quot;Joe was punched by Steve.&quot; The first sentence is active; it describes a thing (in this case a person) doing an action. The second is passive; it describes a thing having an action done to it. As a rule, active voice is more exciting than passive voice. It uses fewer words, so it&#39;s quicker to read, and it forces you to write the events in the order they actually happen, which means your readers can follow along without having to stop and update their mental picture all the time. Active voice is your friend.<br><br>... I think that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got in me right now. Any specific questions I didn&#39;t cover? That&#39;s admittedly a very shallow overview.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The backstory of Tauriel has been revealed. According to Evangeline Lilly, “[Tauriel] is an orphan. Her parents were killed by orcs. When you understand that, you suddenly understand how and why this girl became the lethal killing machine that she is, how she became the head of the elven guard, how she got taken under Thranduil’s wings, and why she’s so passionate about fighting the evil that is in Middle Earth.” <br><br>And, apparently, she &quot;is one of the few characters in the film who is purely fighting for truth and for justice.

            <p>I&#39;m assuming here that Tauriel is too young for her parents to have been killed during the Last Alliance - that is, I&#39;m assuming that &#39;her parents were killed by Orcs&#39; is an ambush, one-off scenario, not part of a massive battle, invasion, or war.<br><br>With that being said... how many named elves do we know of who <i>were</i> killed by orcs outside of cataclysmic battles?<br><br>Because I&#39;m having trouble coming up with any.<br><br>Running through my mental Named Elf Checklist, we have:<br><br>-A whole bunch of people in Valinor. The only two who died are Miriel (of grief) and Finwe (of Morgoth).<br>-Feanor and his seven sons. They die of: possible ship-burning, balrog, jumping into lava, and... wow, do Cel&#39;n&#39;Cur&#39;n&#39;Car and Amrod/Amras really all die during kinslayings? That sucks.<br>-House Fingolfin. I count Fingolfin, Fingon, Turgon, Aredhel, Gil-Galad, Idril, Maeglin, and Elenwe, which is eight. One dies of Morgoth, one of Eol, one on the Helcaraxe, three in battle, one of Tuor, and one (Idril) survives. Fingon was killed by Gothmog, so Turgon and Gil-Galad are our only possible orc-deaths.<br>-House Finarfin. Finarfin lived, Finrod got wolf&#39;d, Galadriel lived. Orodreth, Angrod and Aegnor all died in battle, so may be orc-deaths 3-5. Finduilas was orc&#39;d as number 6.<br>-House Thingol. Elu was killed by dwarves, Luthien died of old age, Dior, Nimloth, Elured and Elurin were kinslain. Elros died of old age, and Celebrian (technically of House Finarfin, but whatever) didn&#39;t die.<br>-The nobles of Gondolin. Running down the list of the Houses, I find eight lords not already mentioned. Two (Glorfindel and Ecthelion) got balrogged. I find Duilin, Penlod and Rog dying in battle (so that&#39;s 9), Salgant being a coward (let&#39;s make him 10), Galdor apparently survived (!), and Elgamoth died in the Third Kinslaying.<br>-The only other elves I can think of who died (not counting Arwen, or movie!Haldir) are Amros (lost at sea), Celebrimbor (tortured to death by Sauron, so maybe orcs), and Oropher (Last Alliance, so orcs).<br><br>So that makes twelve: Turgon, Gil-Galad, Orodreth, Angrod, Aegnor, Finduilas, Duilin, Penlod, Rog, Salgant, Celebrimbor, Oropher.<br><br>Twelve elves in the entire named corpus were killed by orcs. Ten of those were in major battles: the Dagor Bragollach, the Fall of Gondolin, and the War of the Last Alliance. The other two died after being captured in the fall of their cities - Nargothrond and Eregion.<br><br>Oh, and of those twelve, only three - Turgon, Orodreth, and Oropher - were survived by known children (and Orodreth only barely, unless you accept Gil-Galad as his son).<br><br>So... in answer to your question? Not a whole lot of elves are known to have parents killed by orcs. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hm, I was gonna argue about Celebrían (the first one who came to my mind when I was thinking of orc-deaths earlier), but I guess technically fading and going over the Sea isn&#39;t dying. All right.<br><br>But, if we&#39;re going to be specific, let&#39;s look at instances of random once-off ambushes of named elves by orcs outside big battles. We now have two examples, right, Celebrían and Tauriel&#39;s parents? So, of our sample set, we&#39;ve got one third that technically survived and two thirds that died, giving us a whopping 66% death rate for random orc ambushes. The statistics aren&#39;t looking so hot now, are they? ^_~<br><br>~Neshomeh is bad at this game, but oh well!</p>

            <p>I think there might be a few more than two examples, though...<br><br>1/ Celebrian. Didn&#39;t die.<br>2/ Tauriel&#39;s parents (sure, because they&#39;re canon, right?). Apparently died.<br>3/ The ambush on the exiles of Gondolin in the High Pass. Total death count: 1, to Glorfindel, by a balrog.<br>4/ I&#39;m really tempted to count both the Dagor-nuin-Giliath and Dagor Aglareb, which are both &#39;Morgoth sucks at sending enough troops&#39;, but I&#39;ll be nice.<br>5/ The treacherous truce where Maedhros was captured. The only named character survived.<br>6/ The capture of Finrod and Beren by Sauron&#39;s troops. No-one killed by orcs.<br>7/ The orc raiding party outside Lorien when the Fellowship arrives. No named casualties.<br>8/ <i>Every single encounter of the Fellowship with orcs</i>. Legolas survived every one.<br>9/ The death of Beleg Cuthalion while rescuing Turin the Betrayer from orcs. Orcs didn&#39;t get him, either.<br>10/ Hmm... you know, that might be it. I can&#39;t think of any &#39;elves versus orcs&#39; encounters in The Hobbit/LotR we haven&#39;t covered... and I can&#39;t think of any other ambush-type scenarios in the Silm. Did Aredhel meet orcs? Maybe, but I&#39;m guessing it was just spiders (which didn&#39;t kill her, just to clarify).<br><br>Oh, we also have:<br><br>11/ Glaurung&#39;s little breakout during the Siege of Angband. He may well have had orcs with him. No elven losses.<br>12/ Morgoth&#39;s attack on Hithlum, also during the Siege. No noted losses, and since it&#39;s not one of the Battles of Beleriand, I think it counts.<br><br>What were you saying about 66%? I think <i>at most</i> the above is 10% - I&#39;d say probably a lot less, but there&#39;s a couple where there may be mentioned-but-unnamed deaths.<br><br>Also: this isn&#39;t Beleriand, where orcs were rife. It&#39;s not even the Misty Mountains. Mirkwood&#39;s main problem is spiders, not orcs and goblins. They&#39;d have to cross the entire forest to reach the Woodland Realm.<br><br>Heck, in the movie timeline, there were <i>no</i> enemies in Mirkwood until the attack on Rhosgobel. So how did Tauriel&#39;s parents manage to get themselves killed? Were they off hiking through Moria or something?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>C&#39;mon, the Eldar had a thing where they would actually accept the surrender of any orc that offered it. None ever did, but the option was there.<br><br>In all seriousness (well, as serious as can be when discussing fiction): orcs are dangerous. But for most of the history of Middle-earth, they were dangerous in the same way that any enemy combatant was: you didn&#39;t want to fall into their hands, but there were front lines. Sure, you might get unlucky and stumble into a raid, but in general, &#39;home&#39; was safe.<br><br>The main exception to this is the parts of the Second and Third Ages when Sauron wasn&#39;t around. That was when the orcs, for want of a better term, went feral: they hid in the mountains and occasionally scuffled with the dwarves. So that&#39;s less World War 2, and more guerilla soldiers (with a side order of cannibalism). Again, very bad news if you run into them - but they weren&#39;t exactly lurking in every alleyway.<br><br>Remember, orcs <i>can&#39;t stand daylight</i>. That&#39;s true right down to the War of the Ring. They really were just a mountain hazard, like, I dunno, rock giants? It&#39;s only under a Dark Lord that they became particularly mobile. The only orc war that wasn&#39;t under Morgoth or Sauron&#39;s direct control is the Dwarf-Goblin war - which, well, took place underground.<br><br>Could they have infested Mirkwood? In theory, yes - <i>The Hobbit</i> makes it clear that it was dark enough. <i>Did</i> they infest Mirkwood? The corpus says no.<br><br>So, Tauriel&#39;s parents? Unless they were with the Last Alliance, they would have had to hike to the Misty or Grey Mountains to get killed by orcs. It&#39;s not a very common fate.<br><br>(The time when it would have been common was after Unnumbered Tears - when Beleriand was overrun. But then, guess what? The Nandor took to the trees, and the rest of the Free People, once their various realms fell, fled to an island. They didn&#39;t just stick around in orc territory)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>But yeah, I understand what you&#39;re saying. Orcs really aren&#39;t all that bad unless there are a great many of them being directed by something smarter and more evil than they are, and it would be fairly odd for a couple of even marginally competent elves to be taken down by a random handful of them.<br><br>I still think it sounds like a contrived excuse for Tauriel being extra-specially passionate about fighting for <s>Truth, Justice, and the American Way</s> the destruction of evil, though, especially with her apparently being a contrived excuse for extra Legolas plot already. Not only does she have to exist in the first place, she has to have an angsty backstory that makes her superior in passion and warrior-ness to everyone around her (assuming the rest of Mirkwood&#39;s population are less interested in fighting evil, more interested in drinking wine, partying, and being jerks to any passing Dwarves), <i>and</i> there&#39;s something between her and Legolas. Orc-murders being vanishingly rare instead of common doesn&#39;t really help her case.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I remember when the first <i>DoS</i> trailer came out, there was a lot of discussion on forums about Bard looking like Will Turner. He&#39;s going to attract lots of fangirls, as far as I could tell, and I think the fact that he&#39;s played by Luke Evans already excited them.<br><br>However, I think they&#39;re going to include Bain son of Bard in the Movie, as well as two daughters that were never mentioned anywhere in the book. I don&#39;t think this is going to reduce the number of OC/Bard fics the Movie&#39;s going to spawn vastly, &#39;cause we all know how ignorant Suethors are...<br><br>~Autumn</p>

            <p>Note that this is from the perspective of someone who has read the Hobbit and seen the movies as sources of canon for Arda. Oh, and osmosis through the PPC.<br><br>Holy cow, Elves can die of old age! I knew this was true of the Elder Scrolls, D&amp;D, and every <i>other</i> fantasy world, but not in Middle Earth. I thought they were immortal as long as they didn&#39;t get killed. Or die of grief. For some reason. Sure, only, like, 5 reached that ripe old age, but it is possible!<br><br>Elves are oh so much better then humans! Praise our long lived, pointy-eared superiors, for while twenty orcs can decimate an entire village of humans, it takes hundreds to take out a single elf! Well, this is based off of statistics given, but still.<br><br>...By Eru, the Elvish hierarchy is complicated. I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s based off of culture per-se, but, and I am guessing here, how close they were to the Valar? This is either through blood, physical location, or following their ways? I am sure the Tolkien enthusiasts are twitching, as I am sure it is all wrong.<br><br>Well, that was... interesting. I feel like there is so much history here that I cannot even begin to grasp without a lot of time reading and studying the details about this fictional world. I&#39;ll give Mr. Tolkien this much: he is the single greatest world builder I have ever seen.<br><br>And now a question for the Tolkien enthusiasts. I am a fan of the Elder Scrolls seres of video games, and as it is a fantasy seres, it borrows several ideas from Tolkien. However, the Altmer, or High Elves, are said to be the closest to the elves we see in the Lord of the Rings. There is a <a href="http://theskyrimblog.ning.com/group/lore/forum/topics/altmer-part-1-creation-the-aldmer-and-the-old-ways"> seres of lore following the Altmer</a>, that is so in-depth that someone who has never touched any of the Elder Scrolls games  should be able to follow it. My question is: How close are the Mer of the Elder Scrolls to the Elves of LotR?</p>

            <p>In the form of irreverent summaries of each mythos:<br><br><b>ALTMER</b><br><br>In the beginning God created lesser gods, who created their own lesser gods. One of these last was basically Loki, and he persuaded the gods to make the world for them to live in. But, being Loki, this was a trick to make them all separate beings and mortal. This is called the Sundering.<br><br>The sun and the stars were created by gods fleeing the world and tearing holes in reality. Some of the gods sacrificed themselves to become the laws of nature. The others invented boinking and became the ancestors of the Altmer. Then Loki invented humans to be a malleable army for him.<br><br>The oldest of the gods talked to God and asked to come back, but there was no ‘back’ to go to, because it had been made into the world. This was a very bad thing. So instead God gave him weapons and told him to stop everyone killing the Altmer (since there were at least two splinter groups by this time).<br><br>Loki’s armies conquered all the Altmer lands, destroying them in the process, but then an Altmari champion killed Loki and cut his heart out. The heart was shot into the sea, men outnumbered elves, and the stage was set.<br><br>The oldest god finally found away to escape, and promptly did, apparently to show the way to all the Altmer after. The elves really wanted to go back to the (destroyed?) continent(?) of Aldmeris, but, uh, couldn’t find it.<br><br>The Altmer underwent speciation (apparently with some help from a few gods) and built themselves a society. Their cities are individual states led by petty kings, intermarrying and so on, all under the nominal rule of one High King in Alinor on the Summerset Isles. They have a three-class system, with the lowest level being made up of, um, goblins, for some reason.<br><br>Altmer live for about a thousand years. They are very formal and, well, stuck-up, and apparently have species-wide Asperger’s, because they can’t read facial expressions at all. They have a Standard Fantasy Religion, like mucking about with art, and are magic.<br><br><b>ELDAR</b><br><br>In the beginning God created the lesser gods, one of whom was basically Satan. God got all the gods to sing together (seriously); Satan tried to ruin the song, so God had to introduce new themes to counter him. When the song finished, God revealed that their song had actually created a model of the entire history of the world - a world which he then created. The lesser gods went down and started to work on making the world like they’d seen it would be.<br><br>To light the world, they first built a couple of gigantic oil lamps, but Satan knocked them down and destroyed the gods’ first home. Then they moved to a new continent - Valinor - and planted two Trees of light. Satan stayed behind on the old continent.<br><br>A fair while later, God created the Eldar and placed them on the old continent. The lesser gods discovered them and invited them to come to Valinor. Some refused, most began the march west. At the same time, the gods declared war on Satan, captured him, wrecked his stuff, and dragged him back to lock him up.<br><br>Eventually, most of the Eldar reached Valinor, although a fair bunch had dropped out on the way. They were all very happy in the light of the Trees until Satan was paroled: he promptly killed the trees and fled back to his old base.<br><br>Because of drama, a bunch of the Eldar followed Satan. The gods told them not to go, then banished them when they refused to listen. Meanwhile, the gods made the sun and moon from the last fruit and flower of the Two Trees.<br><br>When the sun first rose, God created men, also down on the old continent. Meanwhile the Eldar were setting up shop in the old lands to fight Satan (and to meet some of their kin who’d never reached Valinor). They basically fought for hundreds of years, meeting humankind along the way (and allying with them), before they lost miserably.<br><br>The gods showed up again - with an army of Eldar who’d never left Valinor - and took Satan prisoner again, then shoved him out of the world entirely because they were fed up with him. At that point, most of the Eldar sailed back to Valinor, and the world slowly became the domain of men.<br><br>The Eldar live basically forever, and, yeah, are a bit stuck-up. They have no real religion (because they lived alongside the gods for ages, you know), are fond of art, and have… a sort of magic, but not one most people recognise as such. Politically, they have a High King and petty sub-kings and other rulers, but due to the geography of the places they’ve lived, the High Kingship is pretty ceremonial. By the time of The Hobbit/LotR, there are basically four Elven domains left: Lord Elrond in Rivendell, Cirdan the Shipwright in the Grey Havens, Celeborn and Galadriel in Lorien, and Thranduil in Mirkwood. Thranduil is the only one who calls himself a king.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>So basically, in terms of their mythology? Other than the world being created and there being a bad god, there&#39;s not a lot of similarities. In terms of social and cultural stuff, which I haven&#39;t covered in as much detail... well, the Altmer look like fairly Generic Fantasy Elves. A lot of the stuff that gets stuck on those comes from Tolkien originally. So the fact that they&#39;re monarchist - stuck-up - long-lived - artsy-magicky - fond of trees - associated with the sea... that&#39;s adapted from Tolkien.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Dying of old age isn&#39;t really a thing for Elves. The oldest one we know of is Cirdan, and he just grew a beard ;). Luthien and Arwen both died of old age, true (which I think I referenced), but they were mortal at the time because reasons.<br><br>(Tolkien&#39;s actual view on what happened as the Eldar grew very very old is that their physical bodies would fade away entirely before the flame of their spirits. We don&#39;t talk about it much. ;))<br><br>Elves are totally better than humans :D. But yeah, the trick here is that I&#39;ve been discussing <i>named</i> elves. Hithlum, Gondolin, Nargothrond, and Eregion - to name but a few - all fell to armies of orcs. They were often backed up by balrogs, dragons, or both, but the bulk of those armies were orcs.<br><br>The Eldarin &#39;hierarchy&#39; Nesh and I referred to isn&#39;t a formal thing; it&#39;s basically constructed on, yes, closeness to the Valar. It&#39;s essentially in two parts: how close they got to the Two Trees when they were still alive, and how much they did what the Valar said after the Trees were killed. So the Noldor, for instance, all saw the Trees in flower. I split them into four: those who never disobeyed the Valar, those who left but came back before the final banishment, those who left entirely but returned at the end of the First Age, and those - like Galadriel (and in fact, at that point in time, pretty much only Galadriel) - who didn&#39;t go back until after the Third Age ended. Like I say, it&#39;s less of a heirarchy, more of a &#39;who thinks who is a rustic&#39; thing.<br><br>I will try and look at the Altmer thing tomorrow; it sounds like a comparison could be interesting. But not tonight - I have NaNo to do!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>But, first of all, the actual spelling is &quot;Silvan.&quot; So that&#39;s strike one against this thing.<br><br>The Silvan elves, or Wood-elves, are the people of Mirkwood ruled by Thranduil. However, Thranduil himself is one of the Sindar (Grey-elves). The difference is that the Silvan elves started on the journey to Valinor with the Eldar, but didn&#39;t actually cross the Sea; and the Silvan elves never even tried.<br><br>As elves go, the Wood-elves aren&#39;t as high and mighty as they Grey-elves, who aren&#39;t as high and mighty as the Noldor (who actually did get to Valinor but came back to fight Morgoth), who aren&#39;t as high and mighty as the Vanyar (who got to Valinor and stayed there).<br><br>However, there&#39;s nothing to suggest Thranduil would look down on his adopted people, and—this is the kicker for me—I don&#39;t think we know anything about Legolas&#39; mother. For all we know, Thranduil mingled his line with one of Silvan blood (which would be convenient for cementing his rulership), which most likely happened plenty among his subjects either way. As we keep reminding the Suethors, barring a very few exceptions involving people who were known to be corrupted by evil, Elves marry for love, period. Status has very little to do with it. Look at Celeborn and Galadriel, for instance. Celeborn is to Galadriel as a Silvan elf would be to Thranduil, and they manage just fine.<br><br>Now I&#39;m going to go make dinner and wait for hS to come along and correct any mistakes or oversimplifications I made here. ^_~<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Actually that&#39;s a good summary of the situation. I&#39;ll just offer the footnoted version:<br><br><i>The difference is that the Silvan elves started on the journey to Valinor with the Eldar, but didn&#39;t actually cross the Sea; and the Silvan elves never even tried.</i><br><br>I think you were going for &#39;Sindarin&#39; in the first instance, there. Actually both groups went a bloomin&#39; long way on the Great March - we never in the entire history of Middle-earth meet any of the Avari who didn&#39;t leave the Waters of Awakening (Cuivienen) at all. Tolkien once wrote the word for &#39;elf&#39; in six of their languages, and... that&#39;s all we know. Well, he also theorised that they might have been the first orcs - but he also theorised that about humans and animals, so that one&#39;s way up in the air.<br><br>Anyway, the difference between the Silvan folk and the Sindar is that they broke off the journey at different times. The Silvan... okay, look, &#39;Silvan&#39; is English, and bothers me; I&#39;m going to start using &#39;Nandor&#39;, which is one possible identity of their group. Okay? Okay. The Nandor saw the Misty Mountains and decided they were impassable, so they stayed in what would later be Mirkwood and Lothlorien. The Sindar reached the sea in Beleriand (late - both of these groups are part of the largest Third Tribe, the Teleri, and were a lot slower in the journey than the Vanyar or the Noldor), but then their king, one Elwe, went missing. The remaining Teleri split into two groups - one which crossed the sea to Valinor, under Elwe&#39;s brother Olwe (or Olue in the Telerin dialect), and one which stayed in Middle-earth to look for Elwe.<br><br>They eventually found him, and his new Maia wife Melian, and stayed in Beleriand as the Sindar.<br><br><i>As elves go, the Wood-elves aren&#39;t as high and mighty as they Grey-elves, who aren&#39;t as high and mighty as the Noldor (who actually did get to Valinor but came back to fight Morgoth), who aren&#39;t as high and mighty as the Vanyar (who got to Valinor and stayed there).</i><br><br>The Noldor split the elves into two groups &#39;Light Elves&#39; and &#39;Dark Elves&#39;. Light Elves, or Caliquendi, are those who travelled to Valinor and saw the light of the Two Trees. Dark Elves, Moriquendi, are those who didn&#39;t. (No moral connotations to the term, by the way!)<br><br>But the Sindar are in a tricky position. Their king was one of the three taken to Valinor to prove it exists, so he&#39;s definitely in the Caliquendi. His people are Moriquendi - except they have a demigoddess as their queen. So they were dubbed the Sindar - the Grey-elves, the elves of the twilight.<br><br>(They may actually have given themselves this name, but Noldorin arrogance makes for a better story. ;))<br><br>Neshomeh&#39;s hierarchy is pretty good. The full version, as seen from an Exilic Noldorin point of view (let&#39;s say Galadriel during the Third Age), probably goes like this:<br><br>Vanyar (live in central Valinor with the Valar) &gt; remnant Noldor (stayed behind in Valinor and never followed Feanor) &gt; Finarfin&#39;s Noldor (turned back to Valinor before fully leaving the Undying Lands) &gt; Valinorian Teleri (live outside Valinor proper, but in the Undying Lands, never left) &gt; Returned Noldor (now living on the Lonely Isle in the vicinity of Valinor) &gt; Exilic Noldor (followed Feanor, but were Caliquendi, after all) &gt; Sindar (the Grey-elves, obviously better than the Nandor, because of Elwe/Elu) &gt; Nandor (Wood-elves in general - totally dark) &gt; Avari (who never left Cuivienen, so basically the darkest of the dark).<br><br>But the only real manifestation of that was that the Noldor in Beleriand were pretty dismissive towards everyone. By the Third Age, the few who were left had gotten most of it out of their system - and there&#39;s no indication that the Sindar ever looked down on anyone. In fact, in the First Battle in Beleriand (way before the Noldor showed up), it was the Laiquendi - those Nandor who had crossed the Misty and Blue Mountains after a wait - who saved the Sindar from destruction. Being prejudiced against their saviours would be extremely petty, wouldn&#39;t it?<br><br><i>However, there&#39;s nothing to suggest Thranduil would look down on his adopted people, and—this is the kicker for me—I don&#39;t think we know anything about Legolas&#39; mother.</i><br><br>This is very true - but we have one piece of information which shines a little light on it. While the names of Thranduil (tharan-duil, &#39;vigorous spring&#39;) and his father Oropher (&#39;tall beech-tree&#39;, the first Sindarin King of Mirkwood) are Sindarin, the name Legolas (&#39;green leaf&#39;) is <i>not</i> pure Sindarin. That would require the first syllable to be &#39;laeg&#39;, not &#39;lego&#39;. So apparently he is named in Nandorin.<br><br>Also, there&#39;s this, from LotR:<br><br>&#39;...the Elves of this land were of a race strange to us of the silvan folk...&#39;<br><br>That&#39;s Legolas in Eregion, which was a Noldorin land before it fell. So <i>he</i> thinks of himself as Silvan.<br><br><i>Celeborn is to Galadriel as a Silvan elf would be to Thranduil, and they manage just fine.</i><br><br>Let&#39;s not get into the question of who Celeborn is. But my preferred interpretation agrees with this. Of course, Galadriel is a lot less snippish than Thranduil...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve said all along that with a name like &#39;Forest girl&#39;, she <i>had</i> to be a war orphan. And hey, lookit that. ;)<br><br>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d characterise that backstory as leading to &#39;fighting for truth and for justice&#39;, though. Seems more like it would lead to fighting every evil (which is good) in an attempt to find closure, exact revenge, and, yes, ensure no-one else suffers the same fate.<br><br>(Who wants to bet the Great White <s>Whale</s> Orc killed her parents?)<br><br>But, as with everything else - it&#39;s not the description that makes a Sue, it&#39;s the way she acts, and the way others react. If that description is accurate, she could be a terrifying character - one who hunts the enemy as a reason to keep on living, and will ruthlessly discard personal relationships and loyalties to get at the enemy. Or, she could be a Disney Princess who occasionally tries to kill things and has to be rescued by Legolas and refuses to admit her feelings for you&#39;ve heard this all before.<br><br>Who can say? Well, okay, in about a month, us, because the film will be out. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I thought with all the being Thranduil&#39;s favourite and &quot;Leggy&quot; being all protective over her, she sounded a little like a Sue. Then TheOneRing.net said she was going to Laketown without Thranduil&#39;s permission, (Legolas tagging along, of course.) then healing a girl the orcs (?) hurt.

            <p>Lothiriella was walking in the woods of Rivendale one day at night, her long silver-white gown glittering in the moonlight. She sang with her beautiful voice a lovely song, hoping to raise her spirit with the song: <br><br><i>I sang of butterflies, <br>Of grass and flowers,<br>Of sugar and glitter.<br>But none of these beautiful things,<br>Can ever compare to the beauty<br>Of my true love</i><br><br>And then she saw him. The prince, Legaols, was standing there, armed with a bow, looking ever so hawt and delicious. Her battered heart leaped. <br><br>Running to glomp him, she cried,&quot;O hott one! You have come at last! You are indeed my true love!&quot; <br><br>And then Legaols saw her, and his eyes widened in panic, for he knew she was a Mary-Sue, and that he would drown metaphorically from all her sugar. <br><br>Just then, the <i>real</i> Legolas jumped out behind the tree where he had been spying on the Sue, and shot her in the throat. Lothiriella clutched at her throat, as she tripped, and fell flat on her face.<br><br>Reaching out an arm, she whispered,&quot;N-n-n-no! Leggy! I-I-I luv u-u!!!!!&quot;<br><br>Earning a kick from a very disgusted Legolas, she shuddered and was still. Thus ended the life of Lothiriella, one of the many Sues in Arda.<br><br>~Autumn</p>

            <p>Dear Lord<br>Be with those who have been affected by the typhoon in the Phillipines. Be there for those who have lost others, close family and dear friends and comfort those who do not know if those close to them are still alive.<br>Help those who are working to find others and be with them as each person is found. Be with those who are already out in the Phillipines giving aid and helping where they can, may you give them the strength to carry on even when the only emotions surrounding them are despair and unhappiness. <br>May the government make the right decisions in these coming days to support their people in the ways that they can.<br>In your name<br>Amen</p>

I suppose it has something to do with being too nice and forgiving towards spelling/grammar errors as long as my curiosity is piqued. I take back what I said about the minis.

In real life, I am a British psychology graduate of questionable gender with too much time on hir hands. I found the PPC originally while on a trip through TV Tropes, but never bothered introducing myself and sort of forgot after a while. Then recently I rediscovered it via a friend of mine from tumblr (she goes by Laburnum around these parts, I believe).<br><br> As far as fandoms go, you will see me in a lot of different places due to my ever-changing interests and limited attention span, however a few more prominent ones include Homestuck, Berserk, That Guy With The Glasses/Channel Awesome (any other Secret Treehouse members here? just curious. If so, hi!), and Fandomstuck. You&#39;ll also see me hanging around the edges of any fandom about personifying non-human things, such as Hetalia or the OS-tans or a lot of other things I&#39;m not going to list for the sake of not talking y&#39;all to death any more than I already am. <br><br>Ahh, I&#39;ve probably rambled on enough.

            <p>It seemed that, while the Doctor would regenerate regardless, the Sisterhood gave him their Elixir so that he would transform into a specific form and personality to fit the task ahead of him. They seemed to predict what he would request, too, since the lead Sister had a specific Elixir prepared for &quot;warrior Time Lord&quot; before the Doctor even crashed.<br><br>Eight wasn&#39;t the sort of person who would willingly use the Moment, the as-of-now ill-defined superweapon that ended the Time War by wiping out Gallifrey and the Dalek fleets around it, as well as creating permanent scars in the timestream, and a random regeneration might have ended up with someone like Five, who would be even <i>less</i> likely to take that sort of drastic action. There needed to be a Doctor who would do what was necessary to preserve what little was left of the universe&#39;s sanity, no matter how many lives had to be lost, and if the new mind was unable to follow through, the Time War would probably rage indefinitely.<br>When you consider the Doctor&#39;s core personality traits, a mind like that would have been almost impossible for him to create through random regeneration alone, <i>especially</i> when the new body was still getting accustomed to it.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s actually the least believable part about the whole minisode for me - that was a spaceship moving at orbital, or even interplanetary, speeds.

            <p>From the footage after the crash, the craft did get pretty wrecked up - the Doctor appeared to be lying amid debris with the sky above him. The hull had essentially ceased to exist in any recognisable form. <br><br>However, the vessel was referred to as a &#39;gunship&#39;, which suggests that it is military in nature. It&#39;s not unreasonable to assume that it would have had a lot of armour, and structural redundancy - it may have even had automated emergency systems designed to help out in a crash landing, something like a <i>Star Wars</i> repulsorlift could be used to cushion the impact, but might only kick in at the last second. OK, the sudden deccleration of such a system could do some fairly horrific things to any crew left onboard - but it&#39;s not going to be worse than hitting a planet at terminal velocity. <br><br>As for the crash itself, the final trajectory appeared to be a straight line. Yeah it was at quite a steep angle, but the craft wasn&#39;t plummeting, and it wasn&#39;t rolling or spiralling either - that implies that it came down under at least partial control. I don&#39;t think it was an unpowered descent. If it did have some kind of emergency landing system fitted, then those two things combined might have been enough to stop it from turning into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_kill_vehicle">relativistic kill vehicle</a> - which seems to be the sort of thing you were expecting from that &#39;vaporised&#39; comment. <br><br>In conclusion, if you do <i>have</i> to be in a crashing spaceship, then being in one designed/built by whoever did that one is not a bad idea. Also, try and sit near the Black Box - after all, if that&#39;s the only bit of the craft they expect to recover, that sounds like a pretty good spot to be in :)<br><br>And I just have to say that I really like the Doctor&#39;s logic about why they should move to the back of the ship - I thought that was a very nice line. </p>

            <p>During the initial approach sequence, we see two shots of the gunship approaching the planet. There&#39;s about six seconds between them, with no indication that we&#39;ve jumped in time. In those six seconds, the planet&#39;s apparent size roughly doubles. That means the distance to the planet has halved. Since the episode goes on longer than another six seconds, either we <i>did</i> jump a bit, or the ship slows down somehow.<br><br>But... I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough. That final crash trajectory? That&#39;s <i>really fast</i>. It takes less than a second to go from &#39;dot on the screen&#39; to impact. Given that the-- actually, wait.<br><br>The ship was <i>trailing smoke in space</i>. The only way for it to be doing that is for it to be <i>accelerating</i> on the way down - otherwise the smoke would be moving at the same velocity as the ship, and would just jet outwards. The engines were still working - and without being able to reference the dialogue, I&#39;m betting they were jammed on. That ship hit atmo - and hit the ground - under significant thrust. The explosion when it hit expands to at least three or four times the size of the ship itself - and is big enough to light up the faces of the Sisterhood at what seems to be a fairly large distance. There are multiple bursts of light - at least three major fireballs in the space of two seconds. We then cut to a pan through the ship, which has been torn apart. There are broken ribs everywhere. That impact was <i>not</i> survivable.<br><br>My guess? The Doctor was in the TARDIS when the impact came, trying to do something clever (put the gunship on tow?). He was thrown out of the doors, much like Eleven had to be in <i>Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS</i>. That means it&#39;s the TARDIS&#39; dampers, buffers and shields which protected him from the impact, not the gunship&#39;s.<br><br>And yet, he was still genuinely dead - at least according to the clearly unreliable Sisterhood. To kill someone through TARDIS shielding - which has been shown to fall from orbit with little more than a bump before - that must have been one heck of a crash.<br><br>Given the former Frankenstein-flavoured shenanigans on Karn, I&#39;m going to guess that Cass wasn&#39;t just dead - she was a complete ruin. Only their experience with Morbius - and the technology which resurrected him - allowed the Sisterhood to piece her back together for the Doctor to look at. Whether they needed that technology to bring the Doctor back to life, or whether their Elixir sufficed, is an open question.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>After all, what&#39;s the easiest way to introduce an alien presence in sci-fi stories without said presence providing an immediate threat? Send a spaceship hurtling through the atmosphere, and crash it into the planet. Normally, there&#39;s at least one person who stays alive from it, regardless of how much red goo the impact should have turned them into, though they do occasionally die a few minutes after someone finds the crash site following the low muttering of something cryptic or the handing off of some sort of space relic.<br>The Doctor, a titular character, getting through a spaceship crash from planetary orbit in one piece? Seems basically like a given. He was even dead for a few minutes, so there&#39;s a bit of a concession to the more probable option there.</p>

            <p>Possible spoilers if you haven&#39;t watched The Brain of Morbius and Mawdryn Undead.<br><br>The clip involved a lot of references to The Brain or Morbius (Fourth Doctor), such as the Sisterhood of Karn. The Brain of Morbius implied that the Doctor&#39;s incarnation at that time wasn&#39;t his fourth, but could also be taken to possibly be previous incarnations of Morbius (who was also a Time Lord). The elixir of life that the Sisterhood guard also seems to circumvent any rules regarding regenration (like the 12 regeneration rule referenced in Mawdryn Undead- but this serial has a lot of continuity errors...) and it seems implied that by taking the elixir, the Doctor has more than 12 regenerations. Moffat enjoys his references to Classic!Who, so I am guessing that he is taking the implication that the Doctor has had many more than 11 incarnations as canon. The frequent references to episodes that are more than 30 years old must be frustrating to newer viewers because they add so much more to the new material. :/<br><br>The War Doctor probably doesn&#39;t count as &quot;The Doctor&quot; because he isn&#39;t really the Doctor in a sense (if you consider the Doctor as a description of what he stands for and not just a name). The Doctor wanted to become a warrior, so he became pretty much an entirely different person in the sense that he isn&#39;t about being a force of good in the universe any more (until he starts calling himself the Doctor again). I wouldn&#39;t consider the War Doctor to be 9 because he isn&#39;t the Doctor. If you&#39;ve seen The Unearthly Child, you know that One was a terrible person by human standards until the end of that serial. I think it&#39;s fair to consider One the first Doctor even if he has had previous incarnations of a different name because his goal wasn&#39;t to be a force of good until that point. <br><br>I apologize for my ramblings, but the clip has given me so many feels. XD I&#39;m also a bit annoyed that Paul McGann doesn&#39;t have a role in the actual 50th anniversary episode. I would love to see more of him on screen as the Doctor instead of just listening to audio plays. </p>

            <p>Let me say at the outset that I have no problem with characters in stories having things dramatically revealed to them that we, the audience, already know about. Heck, one of my favourite lines from Doctor Who is a perfect example of this:<br><br>&quot;My home planet is far away and long since gone. But its name lives on: <i>Gallifrey.</i>&quot;<br><br>Yeah, yeah, we knew that decades ago - but it&#39;s still awesomely played.<br><br>No, what I&#39;m thinking about in this post are dramatic reveals - the sort which reveal something shocking to the audience - which are lost, either through adaptation or prequels. I have a couple of examples:<br><br>-Dernhelm. The sequence where Dernhelm, knight of Rohan, reveals himself to be Eowyn in disguise - and then kills the Witch-King - is one of my favourites in the book. Dernhelm is a minor character up to this point - he looks like nothing more than a deus ex machina to get Merry to the battle - but that reveal is amazing. In the movie, though? We know it&#39;s Eowyn in disguise as soon as we see &#39;him&#39; - partly because they gave her a completely non-concealing helmet, and partly because Merry immediately calls her &#39;my lady&#39;. There&#39;s no reveal to us, and I miss it. It&#39;s a cool scene.<br><br>-Also from LotR: finding out what happened to Frodo. For those of you who&#39;ve only seen the films, the book is structured like this:<br>--End of The Two Towers, after Shelob&#39;s lair: &#39;Frodo was alive, but taken by the enemy&#39;.<br>--The <i>entire</i> Aragorn-etc portion of RotK, up to and including the meeting with the Mouth of Sauron at the Black Gates. The Mouth shows them Frodo&#39;s mithril shirt and Sam&#39;s sword, and we - the readers - have no idea what&#39;s happened. We know Sauron doesn&#39;t have the Ring (we saw Sam take it), but we have to assume Frodo is still a prisoner.<br>--A several-day timeslip to Sam rescuing Frodo, way before the shirt ever reached Barad-dur.<br><br>This is a brilliant reveal - one given to us, not to the characters. Unfortunately, the structure of the films prevents it from happening - the scene at the Black Gates is intercut with the climb up Mount Doom. This one I understand, but it&#39;s still a shame (and as I recall, Tolkien wanted the structure kept...)<br><br>-Finally, perhaps the most famous reveal of all: Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker&#39;s father (see, I <i>can</i> talk about things other than LotR). This is completely and utterly spoiled by the prequel trilogy. They didn&#39;t even try to keep it a secret, so if you watch the films in order, it&#39;s not a surprise in the slightest.<br><br>It&#39;s possible that they tried to put in a second big reveal for if you <i>do</i> watch them in order: that Palpatine is evil. I don&#39;t know, because, obviously, I knew it all along. I may have to go back and watch the prequel trilogy and pretend I don&#39;t know that Palpatine is Sidious. Maybe it&#39;s a real shock if you do that? But I don&#39;t know.<br><br>Obviously these are only a couple of examples. I&#39;m sure you can think of more. Or maybe you think I&#39;m silly for minding this loss at all?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen the film, but from what I remember, the ending had quite a twist - thanks to a certain iconic landmark. The prequel from a few years back, <i>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</i>, gives that away completely. <br><br>The identity of Luke&#39;s father was the first thing I thought of, halfway through reading your post and before I&#39;d seen that you&#39;d used that example yourself. As it happens, I recently read a webcomic bit that featured a character who has never seen <i>Star Wars</i>, and more importantly knows nothing about it, and a couple of the other characters discussed what order she should watch the films in, for that very reason. <br><br>Unsurprisingly, <i>Star Wars</i> nerds, uh... sorry, I mean <i>fans</i>, have already given this some thought and have suggested a couple of  <a href="http://static.nomachetejuggling.com/machete_order.html">alternative viewing orders</a>. The proposed &#39;machete order&#39; (IV, V, II, III, VI) seems to make a lot of sense, and the guy argues his case very well. </p>

            <p>You would think that anyone whose religion held a tiger as a sacred or symbolic animal would also celebrate the tiger&#39;s fierceness, strength, hunting ability, etc. Which, in fact, Hinduism does (as far as I know, from my legendary knowledge gained via Wikipedia). There&#39;s nothing about revering a tiger that should make you so stupid as to climb into the enclosure of a tiger which doesn&#39;t know you and could very well mistake you for an antelope. If you wanted to leave flowers for a tiger, you could hang them near the tiger&#39;s enclosure, or give them to the keepers. At the very worst you might toss them into the tiger&#39;s enclosure, though that would be rude and let&#39;s hope the flowers aren&#39;t poisonous.<br><br>No... religion&#39;s not to blame here. As a Christian, I may marvel at the stupidity of people who get drunk and play with rattlesnakes; as a Hindu I would think it just as stupid to get drunk and climb into a tiger cage.</p>

            <p>Is it possible for someone to do a mission or sporking of that &#39;Mission #1&#39;? I was doing fine, except for the plagiarism, until they identified Galadriel as both the Lady of the Golden Wood--which is quite accurate--and as Queen of Lothlórien, which very much is not. Mind you, this is their Character Analysis Device&#39;s identification, not someone mistakenly saying it. So. Possible?<br><br>I suppose it doesn&#39;t actually fall under PPC jurisdiction for missions, but it&#39;s pretty galling to find not only huge amounts of plagiarism partially masked by adaptation, but also inaccurate details purporting to be Tolkien&#39;s canon. I just...I thought perhaps I should bring up that it&#39;s not just plagiarism, it&#39;s also inaccuracy; and while that&#39;s not something that Wikia needs to worry about, it&#39;s something that I, for one, find extremely annoying. Kind of the icing on the cake, really.<br><br>(Also, um, that&#39;s not just Tolkien and the Original Series being mangled/ripped off. It&#39;s also the Suethor&#39;s story--dialogue and details have been changed. For example, Galadriel? She&#39;s supposed to be Arwen. Galadriel didn&#39;t appear in Rambling Band, at least not that I remember. Furthermore, this is misrepresenting the Suefic as worse than it actually is, in this case by adding the charge of Galadriel being in Rivendell without explanation. At least Arwen was in the right place, if not in character or in her rightful position.)<br><br>Back to reading sources for my essay now. I just...that needed to be shared.

            <p>I mean, I&#39;m still fairly sure it&#39;s not actually PPC jurisdiction (except possibly during the Badfic Game), but...it hurts. A lot.

We do have a Department of Plagiarism, although I don&#39;t know if it has any recorded missions or what its methods consist of (and, er, this is plagiarism of a Suefic and a PPC mission report, among other things, which is why I have no idea whether this is really even within our jurisdiction). It&#39;s difficult to know if PPC agents could even take this on, unless they were the self-aware, fourth-wall-breaking sort (of which there are at least several, possibly more than I realize). However, in the context of an MST...I do think it could work. It honestly seems (to me, at least) to be a rather appropriate response: we are the PPC, and we critique things like this. Admittedly, we don&#39;t normally deal with such huge cases of plagiarism (although smaller ones have definitely cropped up before), but I think an analysis/critique of this, PPC-style (albeit probably in MST format, which does have a history here as well), might actually be rather appropriate.<br><br>Like I&#39;ve been saying--just a thought.

            <p>I had hoped it would be possible to rein in harsh responses--keep it light, while also analyzing and explaining, as calmly as possible, why the choices made were bad ones--but you&#39;re right in saying it would be difficult to do. I think I&#39;m being influenced somewhat by the MSTs I&#39;ve been reading on das_sporking, although those don&#39;t actually tend to stay that calm...you may have a point about the MST, actually.<br><br>However, we do seem to have a Department of Plagiarism, albeit one that is completely without missions. I&#39;m guessing this is an older department, but I can&#39;t be sure. On the other hand, even taking this into account, you&#39;re right about the difficulty in avoiding dealing with the author...which is why I suggested an MST. I suppose I failed to consider that a PPC-connected MST would also be unable to address the author, even politely.<br><br>On the other hand, I think there does need to be some sort of polite, mature response to this. (Perhaps we could send Vulcans to deal with it?) My suggestion would be to possibly write something, with frequent breaks to cool down, and then have a large number of people beta it (probably along the way as well) to keep it from becoming, as you said, full of personal attack and unpleasantness. Because there definitely needs to be some sort of response, or at least that&#39;s the way it seems to me; but it definitely needs to be mature, as polite as possible, and not an attack.<br><br>If people could keep weighing in, that would be great.

            <p>I have a near-solid wall of comments down the site of the thing, and that&#39;s just from an hour&#39;s looking.

            <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jaXH8uZyMMznTV40SPDzASKEg73ivzoXjnJSTh3JJqw/edit?usp=sharing">The mad comment-fest</a> makes it clear that there are definitely a whole heap of things to comment on. However, yes, a lot of them are to do with the plagiarism - either that something /is/ plagiarised, or that it&#39;s been badly done so.<br><br>That said, there are a bunch of things that aren&#39;t (directly) related to the plagiarism - like the fact that they&#39;re unable to keep track of whether they&#39;re in a tent, or the incredibly creepy serial-Sue-killer (thanks, Dawn) vibes they keep giving off.<br><br>I think there&#39;s enough there to make a mission. Specifically, I think a mission in which the agents blame the <i>characters</i> for things that are more accurately the authors&#39; fault. Yes, that&#39;s sort of what the PPC does anyway (since Mary-Sues aren&#39;t prone to describing themselves <i>out loud</i>, for instance), but I suggest something a bit more so:<br><br>Treat Jason, Emma, and Harriet as the psychopaths they are. We&#39;ve said a few times in the comments that they seem to basically be doing this for kicks - so take that premise. Entirely for their own sick entertainment, these three have turned themselves into parodies of PPC and ACMESES agents, written themselves a Suefic (partially based on &#39;Rambling Band&#39;, because they&#39;re a highly unoriginal lot), and gone into it. They&#39;re reusing jokes and actions from RB because they enjoyed reading the report (how they got it from HQ&#39;s network, I don&#39;t know) - so it&#39;s basically the same as agents repeating lines from Monty Python. Except that this lot are twisted sadists while doing so.<br><br>If JEH were obviously self-inserts, I&#39;d be uncomfortable with this suggestion. But they&#39;re not. They&#39;re mashup plagiarism. So I don&#39;t see any problem with seconding someone to the Department of Plagiarism and sending them to deal with JEH <i>as plagiarists</i>. The way to avoid accidentally flaming Aelin and Addie is... not to acknowledge they exist.<br><br>At least, that&#39;s what I think. But I&#39;d like to hear comments from the people who (quite rightly) pointed out that it might be a bad idea.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Note that I&#39;m not actually claiming the right to <i>do</i> this mission. I might do so, but I&#39;m pretty sure other people (Dawn?) mentioned it first, so priority goes to them. ~hS</p>

            <p>...but while I see the reasons people would want to take it on, and like I said a bit downthread I&#39;d be willing to help out, I still don&#39;t think we should make a mission of this, for a few reasons.<br><br>First off, this was a poor job done by some (no offence to our younger members) dumb kids who abandoned the idea a couple months after starting it up anyway. Not to mention Neshomeh got the wikis taken down, so not only do we no longer have a reference for their &quot;canon&quot; but they effectively don&#39;t exist. Us making a big mission out of their, well, mission (more on that later) gives the plagiarised, low-effort work more attention and legitimacy than it deserves, and frankly it would also come off as needlessly retaliatory, like yelling at somebody after they&#39;ve already left the room. Why treat it as a canonical thing when we can just shunt it out of existence like the Badfic Land stuff? Plus, we&#39;ve already dissected the one PPS story in that google document, I&#39;m not sure how much more a mission would add from an out-of-continuity perspective.<br><br>Secondly, it opens a lot of meta weirdness that I think would make the story more trouble than it&#39;s worth. In-continuity, do we treat the PPS as a real organisation? A bunch of misguided &quot;PPC fans&quot;? Psychos who killed a fic then wrote a story about it plagiarising Jay and Acacia? Do we kill the agents tackling the fic? Destroy the entire PPS? Give them a very stern talking-to? Not to mention I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen <i>missions themselves</i> being treated as a Word World before and I&#39;m not sure how to approach that. Not to mention either it&#39;s in the same setting as the PPC or not - just how &quot;real&quot; is the PPS to be? I think it could get more convoluted than it&#39;s worth.<br><br>Again, sorry I&#39;m mentioning this point so late, only just been catching up becauseI got busy with other stuff.</p>

            <p>Man, this semester has been crazy busy...<br><br>Yeah, there could be enough material for a mission in there. This interpretation of events does require subtext to make sense, but it&#39;s subtext that&#39;s present in the fic itself that could work within the PPC verse. So it is missionable.<br><br>However, my comments were aimed more at the MST treatment of the story that Sergio suggested. As an MST, I don&#39;t feel there&#39;s enough material to work with.

            <p>Anyway, if people want to mission this, then I wouldn&#39;t stand in their way, even if I could.

            <p>Ever since I read <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Extended_Challenge:_Intertextuality">this</a>, I really took the idea of cameos to heart, since I kinda agree with what July wrote there. That&#39;s why I am offering my agents for cameos whenever I can. So Des and either Anebrin (if the mission is going to be set before February 2013 HST) or the Librarian (if it&#39;s going to be set any time after that) are available for cameos.</p>

            <p>...speaking as someone who&#39;s dealt with the trivialization of very serious subjects within fanfiction in my snarkings with the Library, I tend to cut the bullshit at points that demand that I get more serious. While it is true that those times generally coincide with the fic doing something that <i>truly</i> pisses me off, I imagine you could address that topic seriously by indicating that you&#39;re not making a joke at any point.<br><br>That said, let&#39;s face it: the fact that its biggest sin was plagiarism doesn&#39;t justify an MST for me. For me to be able to do an MST and/or mission, there has to be something wrong with it beyond just one really bad thing. Granted, there are a couple things they do, but for me they&#39;re not big enough to take away from the main complaint of plagiarism. And hilariously enough, I can tell you why with something that&#39;s being done at the Library right now.<br><br>See, another contributor at the Library is currently snarking a <i>Mass Effect</i> fic which is actually an almost complete plagiarism of another <i>Mass Effect</i> fic that I snarked at the Library earlier. So really, a lot of my complaints on the fic that was plagiarized are complaints he&#39;s brought up in the snarking of the plagiarism (a fact that he&#39;s lampshaded a couple times, actually). So what justifies snarking that fic as well as the one I already snarked? Well, the plagiarizer did several things that justified it, but chief among them are two things:<br><br>1) the plagiarizer added enough casual sexism to make Rush Limbaugh seem feminist.<br><br>2) the plagiarizer also injected a few plot elements that were extremely stupid that were <i>not</i> airlifted in from the fic he plagiarized.<br><br>And both of those two complaints are bigger than the plagiarism complaint itself, to the point that the sexism has actually gotten us riled up more than the plagiarism itself.<br><br>So I don&#39;t know. It doesn&#39;t really seem like it&#39;s MSTable, though for different reasons than Phobos suggested...</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s what my Wikia contact said:<blockquote>Thanks for the thorough research! I know that wasn&#39;t an easy process.<br><br>Given the inactivity of the wikis, the widespread nature of the attribution issues, and the clarity of the explanation you offered the Admins, I have gone ahead and closed both wikis.</blockquote>
<br>So, yeah! I&#39;m kinda blown away. I expected it to take longer, or be more difficult, I guess. But hey, that&#39;s the solution I wanted, so I say break out the party gear. {= )<br><br>And, incidentally, let&#39;s let this be a lesson to us to always properly attribute anything we put on our own wiki. Citing sources is important for lots of reasons! When it&#39;s other people&#39;s stuff, it&#39;s important to give credit, and when it&#39;s our own stuff, it&#39;s important so that other people know where the information came from and that it wasn&#39;t just made up on the fly. Yay attribution!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Well, the fact that it exists is cool, I&#39;m guessing the fact that it was plagiarised is less cool... although if that was the reason you rediscovered the FPF then maybe every cloud really <i>does</i> have a silver lining. <br><br>I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s anything else that we can deduce about the writer - I&#39;m sensing a certain &#39;devil may care&#39; attitude from them.

            <p>Now, I know I&#39;m hardly a board regular- my post career here is minimal to say the least. And these days, I look at the board and I see new people, and my lawn chair cane combo starts to look pretty good right now. <br><br>However, I&#39;d like to remind y&#39;all of a pretty basic thing that I think has been forgotten by some of our more excitable members. Aelin and company? They&#39;re just kids. At the time that these wikias were made, they were like, 13-14ish, and maybe now are 15 at the most. <br><br>Yes, Plagiarism is wrong. No quibbles about that, but namecalling? These are kids with a bad idea and had the ability to execute it, not Sauron and the gorram ring wraiths. <br><br>I can understand getting all upset and flail-y because this is our stuff being stolen, and our stuff being plastered without care for our efforts, BUT. <br><br>They are still people.<br><br>We are still people.<br><br>Stuff like this? This is stuff we get called out on, next time someone decides to paint our community with a less than kind brush. This is the kind of stuff that makes us look, as a community of writers and readers, pretty bad.<br><br>And you know what? Unless this kind of thread goes completely uncontested? They&#39;re totally right to go after us for this. I&#39;m not saying be Happy or Super Duper Ally Ooper Cheerful that our stuff got ganked. I&#39;m saying be civil.<br><br>Alright? While yes, article 27 of the PPC Constitution is important, Article 2 is as well. Righteous Anger =/= name calling that can lead to bullying.</p>

            <p>I must agree with Bryn as well. I haven&#39;t contributed to this thread yet, as everyone has been saying exactly what I mean to hours before me and far more concisely, but I feel the need to second this. We are the PPC. We&#39;re nice. We welcome newbies and celebrate birthdays. We create complaint threads about badfic, and rec goodfic. We hold writing contests. We make things. But we always, always don&#39;t mock people, instead mocking their writing and giving constructive criticism. How is this any different? Yes, it&#39;s an outrage, but the issue can be resolved without bloodshed, virtual or not. Calm, civil discussion is a very productive alternative. As Bryn said, Aelin and the others are, after all, still people.<br><br>-Aila<br><br>(And sorry for the huge paragraph. I just had a lot to say.)</p>

            <p>Earlier, Phobos noted that the FCA wiki hasn&#39;t been updated since May, or their blog since March. The PPS, as observed by the Irish Samurai, was last updated in September.<br><br>As you may remember, I&#39;ve been collating information about the Board. AelinTheAmazing is in that data (of course): she posted for six months. Specifically, March-August of this year.<br><br>Which means that all the time she was hanging about, welcoming what seems to be every single newbie, and talking about how she might eventually ask for Permission, she was simultaneously ripping off the Wiki and <i>Rambling Band</i>.<br><br>I&#39;ve just glanced over all her posts (yes, really), and can&#39;t find any mentions that she was doing anything of the sort - or even any vaguely-worded questions asking if it was okay. The only thing that comes close is the thread where she asked whether it was okay to adopt abandoned agents, and listed a few whose authors hadn&#39;t been around for a couple of years.<br><br>Did she spend time in the IRC while she was around here? If so, did she talk about it at all there?<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: AddiePenguin, the other name mentioned here, also posted to the Board; from what I can tell, she made her intro post and never said anything else.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t remember anything specific about her, but the name definitely rings bells of <i>some</i> sort.

            <p>Being suspiciously similar (and out of continuity, plagiarised) doesn&#39;t really make you a threat the security departments or redcaps need to deal with. DIO, maybe, if they still existed and weren&#39;t disbanded for a good reason, but I prefer to go about as if the FCA/PPS just plain don&#39;t exist in-continuity.

That is not to say that he is not going to be an agent.

            <p>We agreed on no official affiliation. We aren&#39;t on poor terms with them, but we aren&#39;t exactly about to be doing crossovers with them, either.<br>Adding to the no-crossovers-in-the-foreseeable-future factor is the fact that their community is very different from ours; they have fewer members and no public Board, they don&#39;t actually spork real badfics, but instead make up archetypal stories to send their characters into, and the in-universe structure is different, with different power structure, different technology(for the most part; there are some bits like plothole generators, SEP Fields, and Canon Cannons that are shared, but those are either fandom-derived or meta-derived, so it&#39;s most likely coincidence), and higher acceptable power level for the agents.<br><br>There&#39;s actually not a lot of overlap in the particulars, just the basic concepts, and the two organizations basically just let one another fight the Sue scourge their own way. I&#39;m not familiar with the details, but this isn&#39;t the first time the Society has been brought up on the Board, and a lot of this reply has just been me summarizing the general responses in the past.</p>

            <p>I think I recall, or this could just be my interpretation, that the PPC and ACMSES are mutually uncanonical - which is to say, in the PPC setting the ACMSES doesn&#39;t canonically exist and vice versa. Either way, we&#39;re pretty much neutral, yeah.<br><br>(I personally don&#39;t care for them, but that&#39;s not the topic at hand.)</p>

            <p>That&#39;s not the only place we&#39;re being plagiarised, and yeah, it&#39;s pretty damn clear that the FCA is a case of plagiarism. <br><br>I was looking round their wiki, mostly for my own personal amusement/entertainment (in a weird sort of way, I&#39;ll admit), to see just how many instances I could spot. For reference, as has been pointed out by others, there are a lot - although the most egregious one that I found is a direct reference to the PPC. Quoting from the FCA&#39;s Rules:<br>&#39;346. Thou shalt remember that during the <b>PPC&#39;s</b> Quidditch matches, that accidentally taking out Juniper is not a good idea. It only makes her think thou dost like her.&#39; It&#39;s also possibly worth noting that this &#39;Juniper&#39; was in fact Luxury in the original version, and there a few other references to Juniper that I recognise as originally refering to Lux.<br><br>Anyway, that&#39;s not actually the bad bit...<br><br>While browsing, I noticed that <a href="http://sect.wikia.com/wiki/User:AddiePenguin">one of the other FCA Admins</a> is also active on another wikia site: the <a href="http://sect.wikia.com/wiki/Plot_Protection_Society_Wiki">Plot Protection Society</a>, or PPS. Now that seemed suspicious enough for me to check out, and when I got there I found a <a href="http://sect.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Society_Fiction">list of stories</a> produced (apparently) by this society. The first mission, titled <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lzJ-ycX4YU2-gfQytUqIi_5MCsdh-rWJz-amS7Icl0k/edit?pli=1">Not For Harp</a> features three agents going in to Middle-earth to dispose of the Sue, Laurel. That name seemed sort of familiar to me, and after a quick check of our very own wiki, I discovered that I had indeed seen the name Laurel before: that&#39;s the name of the Sue from &#39;Rambling Band&#39;, the first ever PPC mission. <br><br>From the PPS:<br><br><i>Either way, the music was... not that good. Call Me Maybe just wasn’t meant for the harp. It wasn’t even as if they had anything to drown it out - all three had been forced to turn off their Analysis Devices, or risk being deafened by the now-constant shrills.<br><br>Upon the last chord, Emma sighed with relief, and then noticed that Gandalf had stood up and taken Laurel&#39;s hand.<br><br>&quot;You are quite a special young woman, lady Laurel. You have woven a spell over us all with your wit and beauty. Are you sure you possess no magic?&quot;<br><br>Laurel smiled demurely, and Emma tried not to retch. &quot;The little brat even messed with Gandalf,&quot; she muttered. &quot;If anyone deserves what I&#39;m going to do to her...&quot; <br><br>It was then that Laurel wandered off towards a moonlit balcony, and Boromir following, with a lovestruck expression on his face. Jason, realizing his partner hadn’t noticed, poked Emma in the arm, and pointed.<br><br>Emma stared in utter confusion, then realized what was going on and hurried off to a vantage point beneath the balcony. <br><br>When Jason reached her side, Emma&#39;s teeth were gritted, and she was glaring venomously at the balcony.<br><br>&quot;But you told me the bint was after Legolas-”<br><br>Jason hurried to correct her, hoping she still had the self-control to restrain herself from murdering him. “Both of them, I said. Remember?” Oh, no.<br><br>It was only then that he noticed her hand scrabbling for the strap of her quiver.<br><br>&quot;Are you mad?&quot; demanded Jason, snatching her bow away and hoping his partner wouldn&#39;t just try to throw the arrow like a dart.<br>“I don’t think so, but whoever came up with this Sue is! Look at this!&quot; She waved her Device frantically in Jason’s face. &quot;They&#39;ve just about made up an entire new character and named him Boromir, I am not standing for this, give me back my bow!&quot;<br>&quot;Not until they&#39;re out of Rivendell, remember? You were the one who had to tell me that!&quot; Jason protested. On his shoulder, robin-Harriet twittered in concerned agreement, then jumped when a beep erupted from Jason&#39;s pack. He pulled out his Character Analysis Device, which was shrilling strangely.</i><br><br>From the PPC:<br><br><i>It... wasn&#39;t that good. Led Zeppelin just wasn&#39;t meant for the harp.<br><br>Acacia made a face at the sound of the music. It wasn&#39;t even as if she had anything to drown it out—she had finally been forced to turn off the sound on her Analysis Device, or risk being deafened by its by-now-constant shrills.<br><br>As the music ended, all of the canon characters beamed at the band. Jay winced as Strider and Gandalf cheered... even Elrond and Arwen were smiling interestedly, although Elrond&#39;s smile looked a bit forced. Ah, thought Jay, sharing a glance with her friend. The man&#39;s no fool.<br><br>Acacia smiled faintly, but resumed her grim expression as she aimed her Analysis Device at each canon character in turn and read the rather depressing results. Jay couldn&#39;t help noticing the ridiculous number of times it was pointed at Boromir, always with the same result: basically, that he was so far out of character he couldn&#39;t poke the canon with a very long pole.<br><br>Jay patted her friend&#39;s arm comfortingly. &quot;It&#39;ll be all right...&quot; She turned her attention back to the Council.<br><br>Gandalf had stood up and taken Laurel&#39;s hand. &quot;You are quite talented, young lady. You have woven a spell over everyone with your song. Are you sure you know no magic?&quot;<br><br>Laurel smiled demurely at Gandalf. &quot;I am positive. I didn&#39;t write it, so it is not my magic.&quot;<br><br>Jay tried not to retch. You even affected Gandalf, you slime mold. You richly deserve what you&#39;ve got coming...<br><br>It was then that she noticed Laurel wandering off towards a balcony... and Boromir following, with a dazed expression on his face. She poked Acacia in the arm, and pointed.<br><br>Acacia&#39;s jaw dropped. &quot;But you said that Legolas—&quot; she began, then hurried off to a vantage point from the bushes under the balcony.<br><br>Jay followed hurriedly. &quot;BOTH of them, I said. Remember?&quot; Oh, dear.<br><br>When Jay caught up with her, Acacia was not glaring venomously at the scene on the balcony, but had the slightly unfocused expression that meant she was looking at the words that made the world, and in fact reading ahead of the here-and-now. Jay shook her gently, and she focused again, and now started glaring at the balcony.<br><br>And scrabbling for her quiver.<br><br>&quot;Are you crazy?&quot; demanded Jay, snatching Acacia&#39;s bow away and hoping Acacia wouldn&#39;t just try to throw the arrow like a dart.<br><br>&quot;No, but whoever came up with this Sue is. And look at this.&quot; She showed Jay the Device. &quot;It&#39;s even worse than at the Council, they&#39;ve just about made up a whole new character and named him Boromir, I am NOT standing for this, give me back my bow!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not until they&#39;re out of Rivendell! NOT UNTIL THEY&#39;RE OUT. We&#39;ll be able to save him then.&quot; A faint beep erupted from Jay&#39;s pack. She pulled out her Character Analysis Device, which was warbling strangely.</i><br><br>And there are various other instances like that.<br><br>So yeah, it&#39;s gone beyond just stealing from random pages of the wiki - they&#39;re stealing stories too. Which comes under &#39;Not Cool&#39; as far as I&#39;m concerned. </p>

            <p>Not only has the &quot;PPS&quot; been ripping off the PPC, it&#39;s also been ripping off the <i>FCA</i>. I was looking around the PPS wiki that was just linked, and immediately noticed, shall we say, similarities between its pages and some of the pages in the already-full-of-stolen-pages FCA wiki, and after I went back to the main pages of both wikis once a brief search revealed a few ACMSES concepts that the FCA, and consequently the PPS, had also absconded with, I recognized something.<br><br><i>The PPS stole the majority of the main page of the FCA Wiki, itself a plagiarized series, and posted it as <b>their own main page</b> with almost no editing or alteration whatsoever.</i> Not only did they lift numerous articles from the plagiarism-wiki word-for-word, they lifted its <i>main page.</i> At least the FCA had the minuscule amount of dignity necessary to <i>make their own main page.</i> This is just... I&#39;m not sure whether to be confused or appalled by the outright <i>laziness</i> that drove that entire process. I seem to be leaning more on the &quot;appalled&quot; side, so I&#39;ll keep out of official cross-site discussion. I&#39;d probably end up more enraged than helpful.<br><br>Still, though. Why? So much why?</p>

            <p>I just hadn&#39;t checked through their chatlogs. If I had, I would&#39;ve seen that right away.<br><br>Now I&#39;m even more confused, though. The way the two admins refer to it in their chatlogs, both &quot;organizations&quot; are extensions of the same entity, with one being an elite tier of the other, or something like that. So why make two wikis, especially when one wiki is going to be functionally identical to the other? Why not just keep the same one they were using, but change all of the relevant information to fit the altered direction?<br><br>Then again, if they were prone to thinking things through, they probably would not be plagiarizing, especially this blatantly.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s probably a good idea - and I&#39;m very curious as to what it locked away behind those other GDoc links. <br><br>I didn&#39;t notice the gibberish, I don&#39;t think I got that far. I just got as far as having definitive proof that it was a copy of the mission before I stopped reading (after all, the name of the Sue could have been a coincidence). <br><br>They seem to have stolen a lot of your stuff, I&#39;d offer you some Bleeprin on the off-chance that&#39;d help, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s strong enough to have any affect. Maybe some Bleepka, or even some experimental Bliskey? (Bleeprin and whiskey - I haven&#39;t even given any of this to Agent Skeet yet, and he&#39;d love this stuff).<br><br>I think they definitely need to be contacted about this, but probably not right now - it&#39;s still too raw for me to think that I could do so and actually remain civil, and I&#39;m guessing you feel the same.  </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve done some further digging and it seems that the two main people in the FCA have not updated their wiki since May.  No one has posted on their blog since March, or on their message board, either.  So, it is entirely possible that they have given it up.  That being the case, it is important that we let them explain themselves.  So, let&#39;s put the knee-jerk reactions down and let them do that.<br><br>Aelin/Impossible, if you are reading this, this would be a good chance to give your side of the story.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I agree that knee-jerk reactions should be put aside, I actually started writing my above post before you&#39;d posted yours - if I&#39;d seen that I would have tempered mine a little. <br><br>However, I also think it&#39;s worth pointing out that the PPS site seems to have been active after the FCA site stopped getting updates. The most recent update to the PPS that I can find was in September, so while it is possible that they have <i>both</i> been abandoned, I figure it&#39;s also possible that the PPS has taken over from the FCA, and it&#39;s just been a slow couple of months. </p>

            <p>I have no clue about Terminator or Fullmetal Alchemist. But I assume that Halo is deemed &#39;too dangerous&#39; because the FCA don&#39;t have disguises like PPC agents and thus are more likely to be attacked by canon&#39;s like (in the Haloverse) the Flood or the Convent or the Prometheans who have something against humanity in general and are more likely to &#39;kill first ask questions later&#39;.<br><br>I have no real idea, I&#39;m just guessing though. It could just be that the admins either love/hate those fandoms too much to write missions in them.<br><br>Storme Hawk </p>

I wonder what the differences in style might be.<br><br>Your writing sample has improved, though there are still issues.  hS had really good advice and covered most of what I would, so I don&#39;t need to get too far into that.  I will say that the redundancies still crop up from time to time.  For example, &quot;James was <b>comparatively</b> lucky <b>compared</b> to the majority of the Powered...&quot;  That would be better written as, &quot;James was lucky compared to the majority of the Powered...&quot;  Gotta watch out for that.<br><br>And now for something completely different.  I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on the Halloween RP thread and I liked what I saw from you.  Your characters interact well with other peoples&#39; and seemed to be having fun.  They have distinct personalities and voices (something that was often missing in the writing sample), which makes it easy to know who is talking.  However, most of the criticisms for your writing sample apply here, as well.<br><br>So, my verdict is <b>Permission Granted</b>.  Just keep working on the things that need improvement and find yourself a good beta who can help keep you in check.  Believe me, as someone who has similar writing quirks and habits, a good beta is your best friend.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. <br>Right, now I&#39;m slightly calmer.<br><br>-Kelly is going to be more of a support person, quite a large chunk of her is based off of my Time Lord alter-ego thing we did a while back, whilst Apollo is much more offensive and is the &#39;leader&#39; of the duo. Apollo&#39;s the more serious person whilst Kelly is much more laid back and slightly hyper. <br><br>-I will bear that in mind, thank you.<br><br>-No explosion? I&#39;m disappointed. I&#39;ll be honest I&#39;ve been RPing on a different site for about 18 months now, so I&#39;m a lot more confident in a RP than in writing fiction. <br><br>-Thanks once again, for the advice and everything<br>Storme Hawk </p>

            <p>A lot of RPs can teach you pretty bad habits for fiction writing, in terms of style, shortcuts taken, the considerations you have to make when writing on your own vs. making a post other people will be replying to with their own part of the story, etc.</p>

            <p>Mostly because, as Phobos was the one to flag up a few problems last time, I think it appropriate that he decide whether you&#39;ve adequately fixed them. But I can still offer comments, right?<br><br>-Your agents. I was going to ask why James called himself Apollo, but your sample answered that. I quite like Kelly&#39;s description - particularly that she was actually injured in the Battle of Manhattan. Her traits seem to come nicely out of being a daughter of Apollo; I&#39;m pretty sure the canon ones have displayed all of those characteristics, so I can&#39;t really say you&#39;re overloading her!<br><br>-Your sample I only read a bit of (another reason I&#39;ve got the Hat off). I like your worldbuilding and general narrative. My two negative comments are:<br><br>--Commas. You still need more of &#39;em. And I know at least one of your betas occasionally runs into the same problem. ;) Actually, you could simply solve it by altering your sentence structure, but... you have things like this: &#39;In the past few years a group of seven Powered, called the Guardians, had formed and cleaned out any Powered...&#39; That reads, to me, like the role of the Guardians is to form Powered and then clean said Powered out. It&#39;s a clumsy phrasing; either &#39;a group... had formed, and cleaned out&#39;, or &#39;a group... had formed. They had cleaned out&#39; would work better.<br><br>--Your dialogue. I actually spent a page or so unclear what timeframe we&#39;re in here. You go from fairly colloquial (&#39;It’s good to see that you could make it&#39;) to either stilted, archaic, or formal (&#39;May I enquire as to what that device you had over your eyes was?&#39;) and back (&#39;Cool&#39;), without really nailing any of them. I&#39;m not sure what you were aiming at, but I think you missed. As a single example, a casual speaker would render that first quote as &#39;I&#39;m glad you could make it&#39; - the fact that he can see it is implicit in the fact that, you know, he&#39;s there. It could be &#39;It&#39;s good [that] you could make it&#39;, but people don&#39;t tend to use the passive voice in dialogue: we prefer to attach our own reactions.<br><br>Oh, you also have a bizarre verbal quirk: when the Powered are introducing themselves, about half of them begin with &#39;So, I&#39;m [name]&#39;. I&#39;ve never heard anyone who talks like that - is it a regional thing?<br><br>Moving on...<br><br>-The badfic. I don&#39;t really know what to think - I don&#39;t have the energy to plough through to the plot. But Angry Percy is Randomly Angry.<br><br>One thing I do note is that the author claims to have recently(?) revised pretty much the whole thing. You may want to check whether this is still the version you think it is.<br><br>Ehm... I&#39;m not sure any of my comments were particularly useful there. Good luck?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Overall thanks<br><br>-I had fun trying to create Kelly and not make her too powerful or anything, I must have gone through half a dozen or so different deities before I settled on Apollo as her father, so thanks. <br><br>-On commas. Great, more of them I can hardly wait :p. I see what you mean though.<br><br>-Right, I think parts of it have become more and more formal as it goes through each Beta check and I haven&#39;t paid as much attention as I should have to how it actually sounds overall, preferring to stick with it as it sounds better to me when I read through it. <br><br>-It&#39;s more of a personal thing than a regional thing I think.<br><br>-Gah, I didn&#39;t realize it&#39;d change so much, last time I checked on it (week and a half ago or so) it wasn&#39;t being revised, although this time I made a list of different badfic I could do before deciding to try and spork that one so I&#39;ll have to go back to the list and pick a different one I suppose. <br><br>Once again thanks<br>Storme Hawk </p>
