            <p>...do a lot of the early episodes of the Original Series for Star Trek remind anyone of Suvians? <br><br>The first episode&#39;s about a creature that can assume the form of anyone else (and throws them out of character). The second is about a human teenager with mind powers and not enough emotional maturity to handle them wisely (thus forcing everyone on the Enterprise to cater to his whims for a bit). The third is also about a man who develops god-like powers (which also forces everyone on the Enterprise to deal with him, although they seem to have learnt from Charlie and don&#39;t readily play along). The fourth is about a virus that makes everyone OOC (or removes their inhibitions to the point where they seem OOC). The fifth is about the &quot;impostor&quot;, or the evil!Character Replacement-like doppelg–¥nger. The sixth features three women who use something akin to Aura of Smooth.<br><br>I mean, with all of that canonical experience with Sue-like powers, I find it unsurprising that the Lieutenant Mary Sue/Ensign Sue originated in that fandom. I bet it&#39;d make for a really entertaining TOS-verse Sue parody (and if you&#39;ve read one, could you send it my way? Thanks).<br><br></p>

            <p>The pilot episode with Captain Pike almost reads like a deconstruction of the concept of a Sue. Pike meets the last survivor of a population who is an unbelievably beautiful woman, and he ends up trapped with her in a series of idyllic fantasy worlds. However, nearly every part of this scenario is an illusion engineered by creatures who wish to study him rather than by the woman herself, and in the end they&#39;re quite easily overcome when their weaknesses are discovered.<br><br>And the woman choosing a world of happy fantasy over the less-perfect real world at the end can&#39;t help but draw comparisons with Suethors.</p>

            <p>I was wondering how various characters would handle crossing the bridge from <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i>. Then, remembering how popular said film seems to be around here, I thought you guys might enjoy this exercise too!<br><br><i>Before you lies a misty chasm, and across it stretches a rickety bridge. The far side is shrouded by the fog, but by the near end waits a short, tattily-clothed man... the bridge keeper.</i><br><br>Anybody can try to cross, be they agent, canon character, etc. However, in order to cross they must correctly answer three questions asked by the bridge keeper. The questions are as follows:<br><br>1. What is your name?<br>2. What is your quest?<br>3. A random question (the more random/hilarious the better).<br><br>If somebody wishing to cross gets a question wrong, they are flung unceremoniously into the chasm. If a question is ambiguous and the person wishing to cross calls attention to this, the bridge keeper gets flung into the chasm instead (and presumably climbs back out in time for the next post).<br><br>So, have fun!</p>

            <p>The Mirrorverse has never had a movie before - just the one TOS episode, some DS9 and Enterprise episodes, and some of the expanded universe. Though it does bring up the question of whether the Mirrorverse was affected by the alternate timeline split. They would have to come up with something, because it&#39;d be impossible to make the TOS cast play their Mirror counterparts now. Well, it could definitely be interesting if done well. <br><br>Then again, I feel like the reboot cast might be due for a lighter feature, similar to the way <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_IV:_The_Voyage_Home">Voyage Home</a></i> came right after <i>Wrath of Khan</i> and <i>Search for Spock</i>. Not sure they could do something like that, since they&#39;ve been marketing NuTrek as more action-y, but it could be good. </p>

            <p>[Before you lies a misty chasm, and across it stretches a rickety bridge. The far side is shrouded by the fog, but by the near end waits a short, tattily-clothed man... the bridge keeper.]<br><br>The one trying to pass the bridge is an old man. He walks confidently towards his end of the bridge, unperturbed by the sight that is before him. He sense no ill-will from this so-called bridge keeper. Perhaps he will entertain the bridge keeper for a while, if only to know more of his purpose.<br><br>&quot;Now, my good man, can I pass through this bridge? I am in dire hurry, for someone may have need of either my counsel or aid, or both.&quot;<br><br>&quot;NAY!&quot; shouts the bridge keeper, &quot;I will only let you pass if you answer the questions three.&quot;<br><br>The old man simply nods in agreement.<br><br>1. What is your name?<br><br>&quot;I am known by many names, my good friend. It is rare for anyone to ask of it, instead preferring to give me names instead. For now, let me be known as Storm Crow.&quot;<br><br>2. What is your quest?<br><br>&quot;I have many quests, for my duty stretches beyond one land,or nation, or people. I may even have duties that far into the future, that I may have not remembered yet. An old man, you see.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In fact, I may even found out that my dire need to hurry is useless, as the people that I am in hurry to help have either settled their problems, or even that the problem hadn&#39;t occured yet, and their fate makes the problem didn&#39;t happen.&quot;<br><br>The bridge keeper finds this information to be more of a puzzle than an answer. &quot;Then why are you in such a hurry? You didn&#39;t know whther the people that you want to help may need it or not.&quot;<br><br>The old man simply chuckles, &quot;Well, do you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, AAHHH!!!&quot;, and the bridge keeper magically launched from his standing point.<br><br>3. A random question (the more random/hilarious the better).<br><br>The bridge keeper soon climbs back to his side of the bridge. He brushes off the dust of his cloak. He smiles sheepishly at the old man, embarrased by his last flight. &quot;A final question. What is the height of Minas Tirith?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The one in the First Age or the Thrid Age?&quot;<br><br>&quot;How do I know?&quot;. Again, another free improptu flight ticket for Mr. Bridge Keeper.<br><br>Gandalf simply shakes his head. &quot;Radagast must think that my pipeweed is addling my mind if I told him about this.&quot;<br><br><br><br></p>

(He crosses the bridge, where he finds Peregrin.)<br><br>Tomash: Peregrin! I&#39;ve been looking for you. We have a mission!<br><br>Peregrin: (lost in thought) Oh. Right. We do. I left the RC in order to gather supplies for our mission, but I seem to have become lost. Do you remember our Response Center number?<br><br>Tomash: It&#39;s 112358. Let&#39;s head back.

            <p>Your German.

            <p>...that although we generally run this place in English, and most of us are English speakers first, <i>all</i> languages deserve respect, not just this one.<br><br>I think Neshomeh said it in better concrit-words than I, so I&#39;ll just quote here:<br><i><br>Also, I would advise against putting in Elvish words if you&#39;re just going to translate them. ... The only reason to include dialogue in another language is if you DON&#39;T want the audience to understand it for some reason, such as if your point-of-view character doesn&#39;t understand, either.</i><br><br>I would, though, also make note - though you couldn&#39;t be expected to know this, I think - that those who speak German (and other languages) have asked people not to throw in phrases at random, as it&#39;s frustrating - much like you would wince if you were watching, for example, a captioned Anime that was all in Japanese... and then, at random, the characters would throw out a phrase in bad English.</p>

Thank you, my dear.<br>Crowley: *still--oh, you know* Don&#39;t mention it. Any thoughts on getting out?<br>Aziraphale: We could fly, I suppose.

Certainly not.<br>Crowley: ...<br>Aziraphale: Well, alright, but only a little. They all looked so tired, poor things, so I said, why don&#39;t we all have a nice cup of tea? And so we&#39;ve been talking. It&#39;s really rather sad, Crowley, the poor dears have literally been through hell--<br>Crowley: *groans* Angel, please tell me you haven&#39;t been crossing canons again.<br>Bobby Singer: No, that&#39;s definitely not Crowley we know. Since you asked, and all.<br>Aziraphale: You see? He&#39;s really not so bad, I did tell you...<br>Crowley: Aziraphale, you do realize what these people do, right?<br>Aziraphale: Of course I do.<br>Crowley: They hunt demons, angel.<br>Aziraphale: Yes, well...<br>Crowley: Sometimes they even hunt angels.<br>Aziraphale: *shocked* Oh, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not true!

            <p>Well, it falls to me once again to show the ceremonial <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Constitution">wiki link</a> to another newbie. That leads to the Constitution in particular, which you should read, and the pages leading to all the spin-offs, as well as the Original Series, which you should at least take a look at if you haven&#39;t already.<br><br>Don&#39;t pay any attention if people make jokes about trying to eat you; it was a craze from the last few newbies that may or may not be dying down by now.<br><br>What are your fandoms, by the way? Most newbies say them in their introductory thread, to let people know what you like and let the Board regulars know what gifts you might appreciate.<br><br>Now, let&#39;s see, what do I have to give you? Let me look around for a minute... here you go! Take this jar of blue! No, not  blue objects in a jar, just the color blue. You can use it to re-color things, to confuse and surprise others, and if you open the jar, the bright flash of light as the blue escapes could be useful for escaping enemy ambushes!<br><br>(I&#39;d been planning on using the name Danielle for an Agent I was developing, but if I use it now, I might look like I&#39;m copying your name. Hmm. Maybe I&#39;m just being paranoid.)<br></p>

            <p>Er, technically it&#39;s a technique. It&#39;s when you draw on a cloth with hot wax, then dip it in dye. Don&#39;t try doing it yourself-you need special equipment and a teacher. But batik is also a noun-we tend to call the dyed cloth batik. So batik is a verb-noun thingy. If that exists.</p>

            <p>It is! It&#39;s a real pain to make, though. When I was in fifth grade, my class went to a museum to make batik. After about fifteen burns and a boy spilling wax all over his cloth, my teachers declared that they would never do it again.</p>

            <p>A belated welcome - I wait until the newbies have established what kind of person they are before replying. Also because I like to know what fandoms. <br><br>I just saw the movie version of Les Mis, and I liked it a lot. Also, by Disney you mean Disney Animated Canon, right? It&#39;s been a recent obsession of mine - which is your favorite movie? Mine are Beauty of the Beast, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Mulan. I like Rick Riordan and Harry Potter too, but I agree - I tend not to participate in the online fandom as much, because they scare me. My username includes Hermione precisely because it&#39;s a personal thing for me, as she&#39;s someone I admire.<br><br>Newbie gift‚Ä¶newbie gift‚Ä¶I&#39;ll get back to you on that.</p>

            <p>Around the 70&#39;s if I&#39;m not mistaken. The original cast are very old or are ex-alive now, so to speak. The living members decide that due to rampant piracy of their show, they&#39;d rather show it for free on the Internet. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m rather familiar with the site. (I&#39;m currently spying on/helping my friend without telling her it&#39;s me. I feel concrit has been easier that way.)The badfic there has many similar traits to the Circle, but it&#39;s kind of drowned beneath the 1D and such. Which is probably a good thing, except for when you&#39;re looking for original fiction. *grumbles* It&#39;s much less scary than the Circle, though, considering that fact that badficcers are not given near-complete free reign. If I find anything worth sporking, I&#39;ll be sure to let everyone know.</p>

Also, many thanks to the contributors: DawnFire, hermione of vulcan, firemagic, Herr Wozzeck, Huinesoron, and SeaTurtle!<br><br>And now, for the next issue: I will be going off to China on June 20th, which means I&#39;ll be away from my Photoshop and InDesign, which I&#39;ve used to make these past few issues.

Everything else is still up in the air (although there have already been head starts in the briefing, gossip, want ad, and feedback sections.

            <p>In the intro to the Krios article, you say &quot;they found [the Stu&#39;s] powers allowed him to detect them through the SEP field&quot;.

As in, froze, with everybody suddenly stopping what they were doing.

            <p>... is a very recent one. The idea of it being tied to the flash patches is even more so.<br><br>The original concept is that the presence of canon-friendly agents induces the canon itself to produce an SEP-like effect around the agents. That means canon characters won&#39;t notice them, since the canon is stopping its parts from hindering those out to help it. Non-canon characters - and character replacements - aren&#39;t under canon&#39;s control even slightly, so aren&#39;t affected by it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Since, you know, the agents ARE their problem, because the agents are out to evaluate and possibly kill them. It may provide a very weak protection on top of the canonical masking, but it&#39;s just as easily breached by shouting or direct interaction. I know this, because I&#39;m pretty sure it was my idea, or at least one that came out of a discussion I was involved in around the time I was compiling the Useful Technology glossary. Take a look at the <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/gizmo.html#patch">flash patch entry</a>. It was never meant to subvert the need for agents to be discreet‚Äîit was more an attempt to explain things in a way that doesn&#39;t require the canon to explicitly be on our side.

            <p>That would just cause there to be three layers of non-detection, which I&#39;ve done my best to outline below.<br><br>Layer 1: The canonical influence.<br>The continuum is rejecting the badfic, and will keep anything connected to itself from preventing the destruction of said badfic. OCs would be able to pierce this field, since 1) strictly speaking, it doesn&#39;t exist as a force or a physical substance, and is only an effect the continuum has on its natives and 2) the OCs are not part of the original canon of the continuum, and would thus be less able to be affected by its less specific effects.<br>Layer 1 is also incredibly passive, and can be pierced for even a central canon character if they are disturbed or directly interacted with.<br><br>Layer 2: Disguises.<br>The disguise causes the being affected by the disguise to take on the characteristics of a being native to a certain continuum. This would allow the OCs to merely dismiss the Agents as background characters if said OC noticed the Agents&#39; presence. Typically, the PPC Agents would choose a species that would either 1) blend in with the surroundings, or 2) plausibly kill the OCs and/or burst out shouting and waving things. There can be overlap, of course.<br>Layer 2 cannot be pierced unless use of a D.O.R.K.S., equipment malfunction, or related occurrences cause the disguise to be dropped, or more specific or situational causes, i.e. a character with a canonical ability to see through disguises, such as Bionicle&#39;s Axonn.<br><br>Layers 1 and 2 are not optional and have always been part of the PPC methodology, since Layer 1 is involuntary and Layer 2 is required by the PPC for its field agents.<br><br>Layer 3: the Somebody Else&#39;s Problem Field. Native to the Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy continuum, the SEP Field will hide anything inside its scope from view unless it is going to cause a problem for the viewer. One would not expect to see three orcs angrily ranting about continuity or writing on a clipboard, so one simply <i>does</i> not.<br>The SEP Field can even hold up against OCs, though Sues and Stus may be speshul enough to detect its presence. (The Field will usually conceal the fact that an SEP Field is being used, because the use of unfamiliar technology is usually not a direct problem, and thus is under the Field&#39;s purview.)<br>Layer 3 can be pierced when an Agent directly creates a problem for a character, such as when they interfere with said character&#39;s story, dragging them off to charge for Suvian activity, and subsequently killing them. However, since it is technological in nature, it is prone to the same limits as any piece of technology, especially in continua hostile to technological activity. It is usually stored in portable form in an Agent&#39;s flash patch, though the flash patch SEP Field is weak enough that it only activates while within a badfic. The flash patch did not originally contain the SEP Field at all, but the technology was adapted several years ago to increase safety for field agents once it was noticed how prone field agents are to ranting, shouting, and otherwise doing things that would draw attention to themselves.<br><br>Subject 23 encountering the Agents can be explained by way of Layers 1 and 3 being pierced. Layer 1 was pierced by Xanthus making a scene, and subsequently drawing the attention of several canon characters. Layer 3 was pierced by Subject 23&#39;s ability to detect and disable technology that would be used against him, coupled with his extant Suvian power. Layer 2 held, but since the three agents were members of continuum-native species, and only changed their clothes, it wasn&#39;t much help in concealing them.<br><br>I think I missed something, but this looks about right..</p>

            <p>The sneaking around is there for a <i>reason</i> - it stops the missions just being MSTs with the occasional &#39;they followed the story&#39;. Agents have to hide behind sofas, up in trees, and generally sneak around to avoid being spotted. Due to their disguises, they can get away with being out in the open in groups - such as generally wandering around populated areas - but if the plot takes place somewhere no-one else is around, they have to sneak. Otherwise you might as well write the whole mission sitting in a TARDIS sipping tea.<br><br><i>The flash patch did not originally contain the SEP Field at all, but the technology was adapted several years ago to increase safety for field agents once it was noticed how prone field agents are to ranting, shouting, and otherwise doing things that would draw attention to themselves.</i><br><br>By that logic we should give all the agents flying cameras and let them watch the stories from their RCs. Or, hey, they could just read the written version and get the charges from there. I really, <i>really</i> dislike the &#39;this technology makes agents&#39; lives easier&#39; school of thought - particularly since it often translates as &#39;this technology makes my life easier&#39;. I was guilty of it myself when I started combining the two types of CAD - but I&#39;ve stopped doing that, and I never dropped in anything else. If I&#39;m going to write a mission, my agents are going to have an appropriately horrible time.<br><br>There is a difference with things like the D.O.R.K.S. (which I also don&#39;t like to use) - the portable disguise generator is /supposed/ to make their lives easier, but ends up being absolutely useless. If you want anti-OC SEP fields, make them properly PPC-esque - that is to say, have them fail spectacularly every other mission.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>First, that three-layer idea from the last post was an approximation, based on the information that I&#39;ve gathered from both the Board and the missions. I am fully aware that it&#39;s got its rough spots and bits that don&#39;t fit in, but it&#39;s what I managed to assemble so far. If the model doesn&#39;t work, it doesn&#39;t work, and it can be scrapped and somebody can come up with something else.<br><br>Do you have ideas for a modification to the existing idea, or a better idea for rationalizing the SEP Field with the canon-protection effect? Input from other people would help fix up some of the shaky spots.<br><br>There are also a few holes in your &quot;technology=boring stories&quot; reasoning: it&#39;s not about whether or not what happens in the mission is caused by the canon shielding the agents or an augmented device shielding them or whether the agents just took the opportunity to jump behind a bush when a Sue looks behind her, it&#39;s about the story, and whether it&#39;s well-written and worth reading.<br><br>There&#39;s a difference between &quot;PPC technology doesn&#39;t develop much because Finance isn&#39;t made of money, it only works with it, and DoSAT is more about fixing things these days anyway&quot; and &quot;PPC technology does not address one of its fundamental problems&quot;. Agents shout, and babble, and throw things, and all of that. This is not wrong, and is in fact fully expected, since the Sues and other canonical distortions are busting up the worlds we know and love, after all, but it poses a potentially dangerous problem, since, as we see in TOS and several spin-offs afterward, the canon does not make it so that the Sues cannot hear you, and if you make enough of a scene, even the canons will notice you.<br><br>Thus, a large percentage of Sues would find the Agents assigned to her when one of them starts breaking into a rant, or going bonkers, and then could break the storyline and attack them, or be prepared for being attacked, and cause untoward danger to the Agents. The PPC is terminally understaffed, and if a personal quirk of the humanoid agents results in lots of extra work for Medical, with the possibility of the PPC then becoming even more understaffed, the only options become either forcing that trait out of the Agents, which is inhumane even by the Flowers&#39; standards, or upgrading the technology to let them rant in peace without the risk of suddenly being ambushed by Boromir&#39;s non-canon niece who can blast rapid-fire lightning bolts from her hands. <br><br>You can make a mission funny and well-made without having the Sue spot the Agents, or having that be a significant risk. It just has to be handled well. A good story is always in the execution.<br>Even with an SEP Field up, it could fail spectacularly, as the CADs often do, or certain in-fic circumstances could make it less than useful, if you really want to go the &quot;we have only our disguises now, and nothing else&quot; path, or if you want, you could ignore the presence of the SEP Field outright or cause the Agents to have disabled it in their flash patches for whatever reason. But there are plenty of ways to mess with the agents using what the badfic already creates simply by way of being badfic.<br><br>You&#39;re right, having the Agents sit in their RC reading the badfic while a little camera-robot or something goes to kill a Sue would be no fun. That is why we do not write it. This world is, when you get down to it, a series of stories about making fun of other stories, and therefore, a large portion of them must be fun to read.<br>If something is implausible, the writers in the community can address that, and solve it in-universe, and if something isn&#39;t fun, then that can also be addressed. If someone tries to make something easier, it <i>can</i> become less fun, but if someone does something the &quot;hard way&quot; and doing so becomes implausible, we should fix that as well.<br>And, yes, I am fully aware that &quot;implausible&quot; has a different meaning in a world where an organization of trans-dimensional fiction police travel through literal plot holes on the orders of talking plants. But something can be strange without being problematic.<br><br>The PPC using enhanced technology isn&#39;t going to ruin the way the stories work, because unless it&#39;s something everyone likes, not everyone is going to accept it, and that&#39;s okay. On the flip side, we have a formula for how our missions normally go, but that doesn&#39;t mean that everyone has to stick to it exactly, or else every new story would read like every other older story, and the plotlines and characters would become boring and cookie-cutter.<br>If there&#39;s inconsistency, it should be ironed out, but nobody should be forcing their ideas on anyone, and that&#39;s not what I&#39;m trying to do here. There was a problem. I&#39;m doing my best to find out how to make it less of a problem. My idea might not work. It might need substantial revision. But that&#39;s okay, because there are far more people who would have a stake in this than just a select few.<br><br>Okay, this went on for a lot longer than I thought it would, but I hope the points I was trying to make didn&#39;t get lost.<br><br>Oh, and a postscript on the D.O.R.K.S. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve <i>ever</i> seen the D.O.R.K.S. being absolutely useless. Difficult to use, yes, irritating, yes, occasionally hard to find because it turned into something very small, yes, but never the device just not doing what it was intended to do. If a D.O.R.K.S. didn&#39;t work, people would stop writing about them, because there&#39;s really only one joke in the &quot;I tried to change my disguises, but it turned out that my D.O.R.K.S. won&#39;t work.&quot; premise, and it&#39;s right there <i>in</i> the premise.</p>

            <p>Since technically she&#39;s a canon character, to some extent, Layer 1 wouldn&#39;t work at all, and she would be more susceptible to effects from the Words that claim that &quot;all the elves&quot; or &quot;every elf in the room&quot; does something, but I&#39;d think that her distance from her home continuum in recent years has lessened some of the restrictions this may have had on the SEP Field.<br>It wouldn&#39;t have removed them completely, obviously, since some part of her would always be whispering &quot;What are you doing over here, hiding under that bush dressed as an orc? You should be in your true elven form, standing behind Legolas where you belong!&quot;, and the Sues and Stus would probably be able to pick up on that, since the canon characters not perfectly falling into line would prove a problem for them, and thus would make them able to see through her SEP Field.<br><br>I just realized I spent a paragraph saying what you already said in one sentence, but in longer and more specific terms. <b>+2 Rationalization Points!</b></p>

            <p>I&#39;m reading through the mission now, and it seems that Lily made no mistake! Unfortunately, it seems that the mission writer was unaware of the rule that OCs can see PPC agents, regardless of the SEP field. From Part 3 of the mission:<br><br><i>[Agent Xanthus, thinking aloud, said,] &quot;[The Stu] would‚Äôve had to have seen us coming‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>Both agents sat there, silent for a little bit. This information settled in their brains, leaving the both of them silent as their eyes widened with the grim realization of what had happened to make their mission go so horribly wrong.<br><br>‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶ he sensed us through the SEP Field, didn‚Äôt he?‚Äù asked Xanthus.<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶‚Äù said Anneli. ‚ÄúBut given how he reared his head at us like that, I think he did.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúNot enough to know who we are and what we‚Äôre here for, but enough to sense that we‚Äôre a threat‚Ä¶‚Äù Xanthus shook his head, opening up his omni-tool again. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what to say to that, Anneli.‚Äù<br><br>[A few paragraphs later, after figuring out the implications for the captured agent Cinderella, Agent Annelli says,] ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs overpowered, not to mention that‚Ä¶ Oh God‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>The turian nodded grimly, typing something onto the omni-tool. ‚ÄúYes, yes it is,‚Äù he agreed, unable to say much else. ‚ÄúOverpowered‚Ä¶ and he tampered with PPC technology.‚Äù [The Stu had shorted out their RA by this point in the mission.]</i><br><br>Though, looking at it again, it appears that the phenomena can be reconciled: While an OC is able to <i>see</i> PPC agents, regardless of SEP field, the Stu obviously had some speshul detection <i>powers</i>, which the agents didn&#39;t anticipate.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll leave that to other hands. My point was and is that the Multiverse Monitor - which is a part of PPC canon - states something which is wrong. If I wrote a mission where the Sunflower Official was just a nickname for a blind panther, and the MM reported it as fact, I&#39;d call that a mistake, too.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Okay, I might be entirely wrong and there is a canon reference about what to call a female Time Lord (Romana or Susan etc.), but I&#39;ve noticed a tendency to presume it is Time Lady. I was thinking about this and realised the equivalent would be if we World One types went around calling female humans huwomans, which would be considered Political Correctness Gone Mad. Of course as a completely different culture/species this could be possible.<br><br>Feel free to tell me I&#39;m being ridiculous, I just thought it worth mentioning.</p>

            <p>... Time Lord isn&#39;t a species, probably; there are non-Time Lord Gallifreyans, and in some media non-Gallifreyan Time Lords (Leela, as I recall).<br><br>There is also one piece of precedent (a distressingly common state of affairs in Doctor Who): in <i>City of Death</i> an artist sketches a surreal picture of Romana (I think it&#39;s a broken clock in place of her face) and the Doctor makes a comment about it being a suitable image for a Time Lady. I may have some of the details wrong, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s there.<br><br>What We Know Is This (TM): the Doctor and people around him refer to the Gallifreyan society as &#39;The Time Lords&#39;. They also use this same term to reference the High Council. The Doctor also uses &#39;Time Lord&#39; to identify himself - so does the Master, and no doubt others. The Doctor has also identified both River and Jenny as (partially) Time Lord, which indicates it can be used as a psuedo-species descriptor at the least.<br><br>But what would a Gallifreyan female Time Lord - Susan (presumably), Romana or Rodan (From <i>The Invasion of Time</i>) spring to mind - refer to herself as on introduction? I can&#39;t think of a reference off the top of my head, since even the Doctor never used the term while Susan was around, and Rodan would never have had a reason to - it would be like going into a shop on Earth and saying &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Derek - I&#39;m human!&quot;.<br><br>General conclusion: I see the term &#39;Time Lord society&#39; much like the term &#39;House of Lords&#39;: the members are referred to collectively as &#39;the Lords&#39;, individually as &#39;a Lord&#39; - but without this meaning there can&#39;t be a female form of the term. It&#39;s just not used very often. (And don&#39;t get me started on &#39;Time Tots&#39;--!)<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: I don&#39;t think the weird picture is ever referred to again in that story.<br><br>PPS: Am I alone in thinking that Rodan was originally intended for Romana&#39;s role? We have an intelligent female Time Lord introduced one story before an intelligent female Time Lord randomly appears on the TARDIS? Suspicious.<br><br>PPPS: Agent Morgan wants to comment: &quot;From the heart of the continent Wild Endeavour, from beneath our burning sky, from our ancient Citadel and Capitol, we Time Lords watched over the whole span of Time and Space. We saw your sun fold itself into existence, and we have seen its final, explosive death throes. We have watched galaxies collide and burn - great interstellar empires crumble to dust and ash - entire <i>species</i> rise from the ooze to rise nuclear fire between stars before fading from existence. We have defended your people from a trillion threats you never knew existed, and kept the spark of life alive through the darkest ages of the universe.<br><br>&quot;After all that? I like to think we can call ourselves whatever we jolly well please.&quot;</p>

            <p>Interesting. But IMHO, one usually only goes back to one&#39;s parents when identifying one&#39;s ethnicity. So you&#39;d be correct in saying &quot;American,&quot; or at least &quot;half-Brazilian,&quot; since as far as anyone is concerned, your father is American.</p>

            <p>If I&#39;m not mistaken, a lot of Scots were in Canada when the continent was first being settled.

            <p>I think that the English language&#39;s approach to loanwords is one of these two:<br><br>1) Mug other languages in the back alleys and grab loose vocabulary from their pockets<br><br>2) Accumulate phrases from a mixture of grabbing them at garage sales and having them just turn up in drawers and shelves, then when you try to use them you find that you&#39;re missing half the pieces and the instruction manual either comes in French, German, and Esperanto, is covered in unidentifiable stains, or was never there in the first place.</p>

            <p>That sounds like a pretty great post. I&#39;m guessing you finished basic training quite a while ago?<br><br>...I&#39;ve become so Israeli this year. Next thing you know, I&#39;ll be sharing stories of my own non-existent army service and wearing that same hair-clip thing that most of the army girls wear...oh, wait, I already do the latter one. Hm.<br><br>Glad to hear it. Actually, except for the actual being in the army bit, I&#39;ve been in a similar position this year--I&#39;ve been out in the middle of nowhere, pretty much, which was rather a relief when the rockets were falling. What wasn&#39;t such a relief was having my twelve-year-old cousin sending out a short group email update about how they don&#39;t have a shelter near their house and that the rockets--which reached her city--were frightening. I think I went from, &#39;For heaven&#39;s sake, don&#39;t tell your grandparents that&#39; to &#39;please don&#39;t tell me that, either&#39;. And most of my friends were scattered around the country that weekend, too. It...was a tense time. Fortunately, none of them were hurt.<br><br>Heh. That got long. Anyway, after the 20th it is! D&#39;you know any other Israeli Boarders we can round up?<br><br>(Organizing a Canadian Gathering is going to be so much harder, isn&#39;t it. At least in Israel most things are only a few hours away by bus. For one of the Canadians who&#39;s responded, we&#39;re talking 5 hours by <i>plane</i>.)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Yeah, it&#39;s a nifty post. Finished basic training half a year ago. Finished the course about four months ago (Cipher/Technological Deciphering, ◊¶◊§&quot;◊ò - ◊¶◊ï◊§◊ü ◊§◊¢◊†◊ï◊ó ◊ò◊õ◊†◊ï◊ú◊ï◊í◊ô, in case you&#39;re wondering.

A friend of mine was there - and it was when Pillar of Defence rolled around the corner. Not nice.<br>As to more Israeli Boarders... Unfortunately, no.

            <p>...but that they mostly hung out at the IRC? Hm.<br><br>Huh. I was wondering, but...I&#39;m still actually learning how to understand the different parts of the army, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard of yours (beyond the general concept). Then again, most of the girls here are going to ◊î◊ï◊ì (does that get the quote marks? I have no idea) or ◊ó◊ô◊ú ◊î◊ê◊ï◊ï◊ô◊® or a third thing that I&#39;ve forgotten, so that may be it--it&#39;s possible they just aren&#39;t going to ◊¶◊§&quot;◊ò. Or maybe someone did and I missed it, which is quite possible considering that I&#39;m talking about something like sixty girls.<br><br>I feel like you probably had to sign an agreement not to reveal confidential information. Did you? ◊¶◊§&quot;◊ò sounds like it would be a program that would require that...Also, while I&#39;m asking questions, where&#39;s your English from? Just school/friends, or do you have English-speaking parents?<br><br>Oh, wow. I mainly just had to worry about someone who was in Tel Aviv. I remember there were three of us--everyone else had already left for the weekend, and I was the only one who was staying for the actual weekend, the other two were leaving Friday morning. So we had dinner together in a classroom, and every five minutes or so we&#39;d check the news. And none of our classmates had gone to the army yet, so...it probably would actually have been better if they had, because then at least we&#39;d know what base they were on. As it was, it was a whole lot of &#39;where is everyone? I know one girl was in Tel Aviv, but another had two places she might have been going to, and oh, hey! This one&#39;s just texted me to say she&#39;s alright!&#39; Most stressful dinner ever, especially considering that we were three ◊ë◊†◊ï◊™ ◊ó◊ï&quot;◊ú (girls from abroad, for anyone reading this who doesn&#39;t know Hebrew). I suppose I should stop bringing this up, since every time I do my post gets really long...although I do have a tendency to write long posts even when I&#39;m not talking about rockets.

            <p>Yeah, &#39;twas a long-post indeed.<br>How I learned my English...? Well... back when we had a TV at home, it was British (that&#39;s where I found <i>Thunderbirds</i>, BTW). That certainly helped. Add to that a certain natural aptitude for languages, a lot of reading and speaking... and there you have it. Being a computers person also helped, I guess, since the amount of interesting stuff you can find about computers in Hebrew is pretty much nil.<br>That being said, my English is far from perfect, though I&#39;ve come a long way; I&#39;ve recently looked at something I wrote a few years ago, and it wasn&#39;t pretty.

            <p>I couldn&#39;t find a mini of either of the types he would be looking for, which means that he might not be able to find one either. I could find a mini-Giclops, Gamgee, and a Bety-mini of the character Betty from the Archie comics. Maybe I can use the latter as bait. Nah. I have no idea what it looks like, so I&#39;m not even going to pick it up.<br><br>Without the support of his superiors, the mini-Guy Fieri should be significantly weakened, and the Board&#39;s security units have managed to narrow his location down to a certain section of hallways.

            <p>you <i>were</i> using British spellings!

            <p>I started writing in British English in Freshman year. No teachers bothered correcting me back into American English, so I just kept on writing like that.<br><br>I think it came partly because I wrote most of my Hetalia fanfics from Arthur&#39;s perspective and I didn&#39;t want Americanisms popping up willy-nilly in his speech. I did a year or two RPing as him, too, which cemented the habit, and then when I started writing for fandoms like Sherlock and Doctor Who, it wasn&#39;t that far of a stretch to continue that way. <br><br>Still, since most of my fandoms are either created by Brits or set in Britain, it&#39;s more of just a &quot;adapting to the tone&quot; sorta thing that got stuck. Also, I get to sound like a posh git, so there&#39;s that, too.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m actually Canadian/American/Israeli. Ta. Hurrah for triple citizenship!<br><br>Basically, I was born in one part of Canada, hence the Canadian citizenship, my mother&#39;s American, which automatically gave me US citizenship (well, she probably had to fill out a form or two, I don&#39;t really know), and then we moved to Israel when I was really young, which gave me Israeli citizenship. This gap year I&#39;m taking is actually the first time I&#39;ve been back in about eleven years.

I have never been more tempted to use chatspeak and abreviations, which I&#39;m pretty sure I may have just mispelled...)<br><br>Oh, and so there&#39;s no confusion- I first learned spelling and reading in America and I clung to it. That&#39;s why you&#39;ll probably never see me using Canadian spelling, apart from whatever&#39;s crept in, because I tend to only use it conciously for schoolwork. (Rebel!DawnFire, this is she.

            <p>Indeed it is. As for my father, he was born in America as well, but eventually decided to give up his US citizenship and keep the Canadian (and Israeli, but I think that came later). Nothing too exciting.<br><br>(I lied. He&#39;s Irish, but moved around in his youth so that he lived in Poland, Russia, Antarctica, Cookietopia, Wales, Sweden, and Hungary. He has a lot of great photographs from that time.)<br><br>Fair enough. Well, they filled out the forms, and I&#39;ve got citizenship. Quite nice. I just love wandering around Israel with my three passports (American to fly to New York, Israeli to fly to Israel, and Canadian to fly back to Canada). It&#39;s lovely.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure you ever said where you were from. To that end, where&#39;re <i>you</i> from?

            <p>Luthien certainly died first - a year or so after Beren gets Carcharoth&#39;d, and significant amounts of time before the Turin story. A good way to remember this is to realise that the mothers of both Turin and Tuor were Beren&#39;s cousins - which makes the Two Ts a generation (~25 years) younger than Beren, and therefore puts their stories after his.<br><br>But of course, Beren and Luthien got better, and hung around in Ossiriand for... well, quite some time. We know that they were still alive <i>after</i> the Fall of Nargothrond (and thus the death of Finduilas): when the Dwarves slew Thingol, it was Beren who ambushed them in turn, and reclaimed the Nauglamir - taken from the Sack of Nargothrond - for Luthien.<br><br>So, which death is the story talking about? I think it has to be the first, for two reasons: Luthien was apparently distraught over Beren&#39;s death when Ulmo put her to sleep, which matches very nicely to her situation after his first death. And, much though I hate remembering this, it&#39;s strongly implied that wearing the Silmaril actually shortened Luthien&#39;s life - which means she would have probably died first.<br><br>Of course, if it was the first death, that means Dior was never born, so neither was Elwing... so neither were Elrond and Elros, the ultimate ancestor of Aragorn... and Earendil never received the Silmaril, so there is no Evening And Morning Star... and no-one would have been able to sail West, so Beleriand still exists, albeit overrun by Orcs. The few remaining Noldor and Sindar would presumably have given up on the western part of the continent eventually, retreated over the Ered Luin... then spent the <i>next</i> thousand years slowly retreating to the Misty Mountains... depending on how much trouble Morgoth had with the remnants of the Edain (no Numenor, remember!), there <i>might</i> be a &#39;Last Fortified House&#39; at Imladris by the time the War of the Ring would have taken place... but honestly, I think the Free Peoples would have been pushed far east of Mirkwood by then. Perhaps the Lonely Mountain could mark their westernmost outpost...?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think an Istari cooking show would just be funny just by the concept. What would they bake? Because if it&#39;s standard cooking show fare, the disparity would make it even better.<br><br>Now I have a mental image of Saruman wearing an apron instead of his robes, pulling a lasagna out of a modern-style oven, and it is great.<br>What would the other Istari do, though? Maybe Radagast could have some kind of Bob Ross-style painting program. Painting happy little sled-bunnies.</p>

            <p>By all the stars of Elbereth, <i>WHAT</i>?!<br><br>You take the Nightingale and her cousin out of their proper time - tear the Weaver&#39;s tapestry asunder to bring them to the Third Age - despoil utterly the greatest tale of love told among the Elves - and after all that, you <i>don&#39;t use them</i>? Really? You have a princess of Nargothrond, greatest city of the Noldor in exile, and <i>Luthien of Doriath</i> - possible the greatest weaver of elven magic of all time - and you <i>don&#39;t do anything with them</i>?<br><br>I want to take this. I really do. I want to dissect everything that&#39;s wrong with it and kill it dead. But I have a serious problem:<br><br>There&#39;s nothing to <i>charge</i> for!<br><br>The English is fairly touch-and-go, but this is a non-first-language author (A/N in chapter 12), so some slack should be cut. And Luthien at least is wildly out of character, so there&#39;s a character replacement/potential exorcism victim on hand... but she doesn&#39;t <i>do</i> anything! The entire story is a copy of the films, with occasional comments by the abductees. I don&#39;t know what department would even take this, it&#39;s so clearly <i>wrong</i>, but in such an undefinable way.<br><br>And that very nature means there&#39;s no &#39;moment when it breaks canon&#39; - except of course for the very beginning. I&#39;m not even sure there&#39;s anything worth writing.<br><br>But. I want to kill it. Does anyone think it could fall under the Department of Temporal Offenses? Or even the Department of WhatThe? I could club it to death on those terms...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... it makes me want to take the basic premise (Luthien and Finduilas show up at the Battle of the Fords of Isen) and make a full-fledged AU out of it. Luthien heals both Theoden (who is suffering from /exactly/ what she&#39;s good at fixing) and Theodred (using general-purpose healing); that means Rohan has a strong leadership when the Three Hunters cross it, but probably means Eomer isn&#39;t in place to help Merry and Pippin. So now the Hobbits end up in Isengard, Gandalf and Co are welcomed into Edoras - but without proving themselves.<br><br>Could Saruman break one of the Hobbits enough to find out where the Ring is? Probably. What would he do next? The Ents might or might not be moved to action (I forget the exact sequence of events); would Saruman enact a Final Solution to the Fangorn Problem - or invade Rohan as planned - or send everything to Ithilien to try and catch Frodo - or reveal the Ring&#39;s location to Sauron. Sauron certainly believed Saruman would tell him (&quot;It is not for you, Saruman!&quot;).<br><br>So now we&#39;re heading into a full mobilisation of Minas Morgul, <i>not</i> to march on Gondor, but to search the borders of Mordor for the remains of the Fellowship (since, of course, Merry and Pip don&#39;t know the Three Hunters are coming to rescue them). And caught up in the middle of the largest military movement in recent history are two Hobbits, one dubiously-trustworthy Smeagol... and a certain Ranger company led by the Steward&#39;s son. What would Faramir do? Insist Frodo come to Minas Tirith - or try to guide him through the Mountains of Shadow to Orodruin against the full force of Mordor?<br><br>Meanwhile, in the west, Saruman probably does attack Rohan (to claim it in the coming Age of Darkness), but with more time to prepare, the Rohirrim can meet them on open ground - and mounted. That gives Rohan an advantage - but there are no Huorns to help out.<br><br>And in the North? I can see Dol Guldur giving up on attacking the Northern Realms - the Ring is going to Mordor! The home armies will find it, but what if it turns around? And word comes down from the Black Tower - send the armies to Gondor! Seal off the Halfling&#39;s escape!<br><br>And <i>now</i> Galadriel, given a moment to breathe, likely would send Haldir (or someone) to pass the word to her future grandson-in-law - the evil of Mirkwood is heading south. What would Elessar do? Abandon Rohan to Saruman&#39;s attacks and head east? Give up any chance of warning Gondor? Or try to do both, fight off Saruman, then take the Paths of the Dead to rally aid for Gondor.<br><br>And all of that is without our two cross-time visitors getting involved beyond a pair of healings. Imagine if the Nightingale of Doriath - the woman who temporarily <i>took out Morgoth Bauglir</i> - got it into her head to visit Saruman... or Sauron.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>For instance, Edgar&#39;s translates Quenya but not Sindarin, Eledhwen and Christianne&#39;s translate(s)...neither, actually, and most of them don&#39;t seem to translate Sindarin or Quenya, since most missions contain the original text of the badfic, without the Sindarin/Quenya/Grelvish mix being even partially translated by the translators (I would love to write that now, though: &quot;Fair morning it is to thou a;sldkfh ladies of the Man&quot; Legolas said. The agents traded startled looks.<br>&quot;Okay,&quot; one of them said. &quot;Usually the English bits aren&#39;t so badly worded. What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br>There was some shuffling, and a lot of shrugging, before the youngest of them responded. &quot;I think we all forgot to turn off the Sindarin translation on our Universal Translators,&quot; he said, and they all started to sigh and roll their eyes.<br>&quot;Of course it would be that,&quot; the oldest said, and reached for her translator. &quot;I suppose now we know what the Elves get from these Suefics now, at least.&quot;<br>&quot;If someone mangled Hebrew that badly and claimed to be fluent, I&#39;d be pretty mad,&quot; the fourth of their number said.<br>&quot;Oh, wow,&quot; said the one who had spoken first. &quot;I had both the Quenya and the Sindarin translation enabled. I think that was a mix.&quot;<br>&quot;Make that &#39;if someone mangled Hebrew that badly, and threw in bits of French, and then claimed to be a fluent Hebrew-speaker&#39;,&quot; the fourth muttered, and joined the others in adjusting the translation options.)<br><br>So basically, yes, they have universal translators, but...every translator seems to operate under different rules, or at least be capable of doing so, and most people don&#39;t seem to have Sindarin and/or Quenya translation enabled.

            <p>At least for several sentences. Then the narrator would probably realize that the readers didn&#39;t speak Quenya, and would translate to English.<br><br>They do speak Quenya to each other, though (and to anyone who looks like they might understand). Their translators are set so that they hear most other languages in Sindarin, and that when they speak Sindarin it generally comes out English. Sort of. It&#39;s a bit confusing, what with everyone&#39;s translators. But they hear most languages that they don&#39;t know as Sindarin.<br><br>(Ah, the Quenya jokes. And the First Age jokes. I love them.

I just thought I should ask, since Lambda&#39;s the last (and only, I think) one to ever post mission reports, and since there are only actually about three recorded agents in SIELU as of the current wiki knowledge.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>... Quenya and Sindarin can be written in many alphabets. If you write them in latin letters they certainly have punctuation marks... :P<br><br>But to answer your actual question: the three Elven alphabets are the Tengwar, the Sarati, and the Cirth.<br><br>-The <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/tengwar.htm">Tengwar</a> have a handful of attested punctuation marks - period, comma, question mark, exclamation mark - and a full set of numerals. (Going from 0 to 11... the Quendi count in base 12)<br><br>-The <a href="http://at.mansbjorkman.net/sarati.htm">Sarati</a>, or Tengwar of R—ämil, apparently have a number of punctuation marks, but the only attested ones are two forms of a period.<br><br>(For both of the above, vowel carriers may be considered &#39;punctuation&#39; of a sort, but not in the same sense as English)<br><br>-The <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/cirth.htm">Cirth</a>, Runes of Daeron, or Dwarvish Runes (or Angerthas Daeron/Moria/Erebor... you get the picture) have at least one punctuation mark, the ampersand. In general, though, I&#39;d guess they don&#39;t use them, being designed for carving stone - &#39;The Doors of Durin Lord of Moria Say friend and enter&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hey, PPC! I&#39;m AddiePenguin (my wikia name is the same) and, like you all probably are, I am a Mary-Sue hater. I despise badfic, and have interests in organizations such as the PPC. I&#39;d have to say that my main fandoms are Harry Potter, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Pok–πmon, Percy Jackson and the Olympians, and Doctor Who. Happy to contribute to the PPC... stuff... or whatever... in any way that I can!</p>

            <p>For me, that kind of has to be a matter of opinion whether it&#39;s an enjoyable Sue or not. I mean, there are some Sues that we all *know* are bad, of course, like the ones we kill in missions. But (though I haven&#39;t seen that many people excited about her on the board) some people enjoy Bella Swan as a canon Sue (personally, that&#39;s not the case. However, I do have a family member who believes this). So, yes, there are other canon Sues, and even fanfiction Sues that are very enjoyable to read. But it depends on the person who those Sues happen to be. <br><br>For example, I don&#39;t know if anyone here&#39;s read &#39;Mirror of Maybe&#39;? But Harry does show a lot of Character Replacement, Gary Stu-ish traits (although he might be a boarderline Stu, but I think it&#39;s a little farther than that). However, I do enjoy the story and I&#39;ve read through it a couple of times.<br></p>

            <p>I think in fanfic that it tends to be much easier to find a character enjoyable, if you don&#39;t know the canon that well. In my case, I don&#39;t know the canon very well at all for X-Men. I&#39;ve read the character summaries for various ones that I am interested in, like Gambit. I know the bare bones of &quot;what&quot;, but I don&#39;t know very well the &quot;heart&quot; of the character. <br><br>I read and enjoyed things written in that fandom that I have no doubt would make people that have read all the comics whip out their mission writing hats. And many other things that would probably make those who hold the canon dear to their hearts would find rather wrong.<br><br>Many times I think that the positive comments on stories that are basically well-written, but completely violate canon come from people that either don&#39;t know canon or just don&#39;t care. (Also think a lot of fanon gets created this way, like Denethor or Thranduil being physically abusive, which I&#39;ve seen quite a lot. People that don&#39;t know the canon that well getting their info from other people that don&#39;t know it or don&#39;t care about it.)<br><br>I can think of at least one story that I wrote a mission on, because all the characters were OOC, even the physical properties of the setting were all wrong. Judged through the lens of the canon, the story was horrendously awful.  But I could see that if the author had decided to call it a world of her own creation and disassociate it from the canon she was defiling, that it would probably be considered a very good story. <br><br>I don&#39;t know if this makes sense or not.</p>

            <p>... in that context, is, apparently, Canon Sues. The quote from the Wiki is:<br><br><i>Not everyone agrees that Mary Sues can exist outside of fanfiction, but enough do that it is worthwhile to mention canon Sues. These essentially share the same traits as fanfiction Sues, although naturally the details vary, since there can be no distinction between canon and non-canon. Canon characters often described as Sues by PPCers include Drizzt do&#39;Urden, Eragon, and Bella Swan.<br><br>Canon Sues are not necessarily disliked to the same extent that fanfiction Sues are, since by definition they can&#39;t warp their own world; it never had a different shape to begin with. Drizzt, for instance, is as widely liked as disliked, and PPC Boarders have held up Rapunzel from the movie Tangled as an example of an enjoyable Mary Sue.</i><br><br>I think that should read &#39;an enjoyable Canon Sue&#39;, since the current phrasing is contradictory. I offer no opinion on the subject of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mary_Sue#Canon_Sue">the section</a>.<br><br>Also, can something be a Parody Sue (by your definition) if it&#39;s not written as a parody?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think any of the antagonists in the first couple episodes of Star Trek TOS were meant to be written with Sueish powers, but the way those episodes played out almost seemed to deconstruct common occurrences in badfics that the PPC has encountered.<br><br>So in my mind, Charlie X could be a Parody Stu because while he was handled well and fairly realistically, he still did have the power and potential to warp the fabric of reality as the crew of the Enterprise knew it, and that&#39;s something Sues are known to do more blatantly and crudely. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t get around to responding when you posted the thread.<br><br>I never thought of those specific episodes that way, but then again, I saw them before I got into fandom, so I didn&#39;t know about Sues. Now that you mention it, though, it makes sense. Also, I will always call that virus the OOC-virus now. It appeared in the third episode of TNG, and the episode is, well, now that I think about it, kind of fanfic-y. Unlike in the TOS episode where it was an interesting exploration of the characters&#39; inner desires(Spock...*sniff*), the TNG episode did that with one character and the rest of them...either shamelessly flirted or <i>really</i> paired off, if you know what I mean. And the one that did the latter was the pairing where the two people had had next to zero interaction.(Ironically, they are often shipped, despite going back to next-to-no interaction after the episode.) And I&#39;ll stop before I start ranting about how much I hate that pairing, because it&#39;s irrelevant.<br><br>Star Trek has done more deconstructions of Sue traits. Characters have been possessed multiple times, and there&#39;s a episode of TNG where Picard is replaced by an impostor and the rest of the crew have to figure it out before fake!Picard kills everyone. Then there&#39;s a Voyager episode that sometimes appears to be a parody of fanfiction - an alien discovers a crashed shuttlecraft and writes a play based on the logs, and when Lieutenant Torres finds out  she has to fight an uphill battle to get him to write them in character. We also have the holodeck, which is a place for people to act out their self-insert-y fantasies. A minor character on TNG had a spotlight episode revolving around his &quot;holo-addiction&quot;. In his simulations, he was a charming womanizer who got with Ms. Fanservice Deanna Troi, but in real life he was incredibly socially awkward. And then the Doctor on Voyager <i>is</i> a hologram, and his daydreams include being the captain and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zH6R-w2ARc&amp;feature=related">all of the three major female characters flirting with him</a>. (It&#39;s absolutely hilarious.)<br><br>I&#39;m sure there are more episodes, since over five series and ten movies Star Trek&#39;s covered pretty much everything. But Star Trek is no stranger to deconstructing and parodying Sue tropes.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d go with TV Tropes on this point: It can&#39;t really be a parody because the thing it was meant to parody didn&#39;t exist yet. They call it an <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">Unbuilt Trope</a>, where writers seem to be taking apart a tired cliche and examining it from new angles, except that the example predates the cliche.</p>

            <p>I wouldn&#39;t call that Sueish at all. Odin leaves that eye behind forever - in fact, &quot;One-eye&quot; is a nickname he picks up afterwards, and it sticks with him up through today, as per <i>American Gods</i>. A Sue would, perhaps, do this and then regrow the eye; sacrifice is a heroic trait that Sues often seem to lack, or attempt and then sidestep. Creating a planet from a dead body is... what Neshomeh said - godlike,  not Suelike. Gods weren&#39;t Speshul, they were the only game in town.</p>

            <p>Sues often ape the powers of gods. Remember, the concept of gods existed before the concept of Sues, and the whole point of them was to explain the then-inexplicable in whatever ways people could dream up.

            <p>It&#39;s important to bear in mind that the concept of a Sue is inextricably linked with the modern concept of what a good fictional character should be. The purpose and function of fictional characters has changed quite a lot since the likes of Hercules, Beowulf, and Gilgamesh were created. Particularly important, the mythical heroes weren&#39;t meant to be like real, relatable people. They were meant to represent an impossible ideal that people (read: men) were encouraged to strive for even without the expectation of actually achieving heroic status. They&#39;re also the product of their whole culture&#39;s oral traditions and values rather than just one writer with an inflated ego.<br><br>So, yes, by modern standards they are over the top and unbelievable, but they weren&#39;t written to suit modern readers, so it isn&#39;t necessarily fair to judge them by such standards. It&#39;s a bit like saying the <i>Mona Lisa</i> or <i>Starry Night</i> are inferior works of art because they doesn&#39;t look like something that was created on a computer.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Personally, I&#39;d feel a bit arrogant laying modern definitions of &#39;Sue&#39; on characters and stories that have been around since before this civilization. So many of our stories and tales today have descended out of the myths that were told generations ago - I think it&#39;s just a matter of different ways of storytelling. </p>
