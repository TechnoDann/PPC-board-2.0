            <p>I&#39;ve been on here a little longer than a day or two (almost a month, actually) but I&#39;ve spent most of that time finishing the Original Series, doing my homework on the PPC, and figuring out editing. I DO occasionally read the Board, but I&#39;ve only gotten up the courage to start posting-well, a day or two ago. </p>

            <p>While that&#39;s wonderful to hear, if I were you I&#39;d move my projected Permission Request to mid-April, or even late April, and spend at least a month actively participating on the Board. While you now feel you&#39;re ready (or nearly ready) to start writing, we don&#39;t actually know you very well (it has to go both ways!) and we&#39;d prefer it if we saw you around for a while before you request Permission. So, hang out, comment, start a thread or two, and have some fun. As you&#39;ve hopefully seen so far, we don&#39;t bite...and the extra time will allow your agents to develop even more as characters, and give you a great Permission Request to submit once we&#39;re ready to read it :)<br><br>Also, I think I may have missed out on welcoming you (I&#39;m on vacation with inconsistent internet, which is the reason but not the excuse). Welcome to the Board! It&#39;s nice to meet you :) Here, have some Swiss Bleepolate!<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Maybe I&#39;ve missed something, but as far as I&#39;m aware, you&#39;ve only just started posting here in the last day or two. Even if you actually introduced yourself at some point when I wasn&#39;t paying attention, I still can&#39;t remember seeing you around until today. We like to have a chance to get to know people for more than a couple of weeks before handing out Permission, so focusing on preparing for a request in early April might be jumping the gun a bit. It&#39;s generally best to just hang out without worrying about it for a while. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The fact is, apart for greeting a couple of newbyes you didn&#39;t post basically anything.<br><br>As other Boarders pointed out in your previous request, &quot;reading some threads&quot; here is nowhere near enough. You have to post too, discuss in the threads, and even make one yourself if you have something interesting to discuss. (Or even something random. We encourage both serious and silly conversations here. It&#39;s even in our Constitution!) The &quot;one month&quot; rule is basically there to let the wide-eyed newbyes to get themselves known.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to be rude, but before giving you Permission, we need to know who you are. If you don&#39;t partecipate on the board, how are we supposed to get to know you, and so trust you with Permission?</p>

            <p>You had <i>mentioned</i> that it was a trick question. Was there actually a subcategory of both cookies based on whether or not they were baked by one&#39;s grandparents the whole time, and that subcategory was in itself indicative of a third part of the question? (throws documents up in the air)<br>This new component practically voids all of my previous calculations! Baked goods are a complex and multi-faceted matter! To calculate for all possible conditions, family members and other acquaintances involved in cookie production, and level of experience on the part of the baker would be sheer madness! Now we&#39;ll <i>never</i> find out which cookie is best! (looks for more documents to toss into the air in frustration) And I don&#39;t have anything else to throw!</p>

            <p>To me, the best part of chocolate chip cookies is the way that the chocolate gets so that it melts on the inside, but holds its shape until you bite it. White chocolate melts a little when it cooks, but it falls in on itself when it should turn into delicious goo.<br>Maybe I&#39;m just cooking the white chocolate wrong, but it&#39;s still not the same.</p>

            <p>Surprising as it may be, I&#39;ve known the Pit to have a small amount of good anime, if you know where to find it. Mainly the stuff that was written five years ago... when Pitters actually cared about quality... *sighs*. Most of it is archived away in communities and such, but it&#39;s there, at least. Other than that, I would suggest Google. </p>

            <p>Can&#39;t say as I&#39;ve watched more than a few episodes of Card Captor, more due to availability than actual desire not to continue. <br><br>I would recommend reading Tsubasa, although the anime kinda leaves things hanging. And I loved Magic Knights Rayearth (my first CLAMP), it ends a little weird, but oh well, and the second season of the anime went way overboard on filler/extraneous stuff, the manga is great though. Clover and RG Veda are good ones too.</p>

            <p>Seriously, if you liked CCS, stay away from TRC. As I wrote myself on the Wiki page for the latter, Tsubasa not only has a bittersweet ending and retroactively changes a good chunk of CCS, but it&#39;s also a <i>mindscrew.</i><br><br>I&#39;m happy to see that CCS is gaining popularity here on the Board, though. That anime was probably my childhood&#39;s favourite (and is still in my top five now)<br><br>I did several missions in that continua (#1. #2, #4 and Collaboration #2, although the latter is a crossover mostly focusing on Lyrical Nanoha), and there&#39;s two nice missions with Agents Janet Ackerly and Cygna Hoshiko by another author, so I think you might want to read those.<br><br>(You can find all here: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Card_Captor_Sakura"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Card_Captor_Sakura">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Card_Captor_Sakura</a></a> )</p>

            <p>I am not going to claim that Harry Potter is one of my core fandoms by a long stretch, but I read all of the books at least three times each, which gave me enough fandom-attachment for that filth to make me feel like I&#39;d been punched in the throat. I am almost certain that this Suethor created the anti-Herminone. Literally everything about her personality is swapped almost the full one hundred eighty degrees. And the dialogue attribution, sweet Eris! If someone&#39;s own OCs are so like their depictions of canon characters that a reader cannot tell them apart, which is in itself a <i>huge problem</i>, they should at <i>least</i> not have a canon and an OC speak in the same conversation without letting the reader know which character is saying which line! Just... uugghhhh.<br><br>Are you missioning this yourself? If you aren&#39;t, I suggest finding out who the most fervent Harry Potter fan in the PPC is, sending them the link, and saying &quot;THIS BLOODY THING NEEDS TO DIE RIGHT NOW.&quot;  You can do it without the capital letters if you so wish.</p>

Or, if you put it up in the IRC and someone jumps at it, you can let them have it. Either way would work.<br><br>If you can&#39;t find anyone who wants it in the IRC, you could always just put it on the Unclaimed Badfic page and check back later when you&#39;re planning your Permission to see if it&#39;s still there. Claimed Badfics have an awful habit of sitting around and not getting missions written about them, but it would be better than just letting it sit there, and if the person who claimed it abandons the mission they were making for it, you could always just ask for missioning rights back.<br><br>As for who the biggest Harry Potter fan is, I honestly couldn&#39;t tell you.

            <p>First, I want to thank the good people behind Fan/fic/ Theater 3000 for providing a wonderful list of awful fanfiction. You can find their lists on the main hub page here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uJ8FqW1zBIzsYZoe4M1ILS9H8wgk2zjEEGQqmgNsfIg/edit"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uJ8FqW1zBIzsYZoe4M1ILS9H8wgk2zjEEGQqmgNsfIg/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uJ8FqW1zBIzsYZoe4M1ILS9H8wgk2zjEEGQqmgNsfIg/edit</a></a><br><br>However, My Brave Pony by Mykan (just read the MST on the page, it&#39;s better for your sanity) and Pinkamena: The pink shadow:<a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/46056/pinkamena-the-pink-shadow">www.fimfiction.net/story/46056/pinkamena-the-pink-shadow</a> are two of the worst fanfictions I have ever read EVER. Just... just read them. <br><br>Yes, Marvin and Printworthy are unfortunate enough to be going into them, and somebody special is going to make their appearance in Pinkamena: The pink shadow, but a collaboration for My Brave Pony would be open and appreciated. The reason is that the fic is simply too darned massive, I cannot handle it myself. Well, not without a huge amount of work that is, and I would have to find some way to make sure my agents don&#39;t take some nukes from Fallout Equestria and carpet bomb the entire land of Unicornocopia too soon. Yes that is the name of the country. The citizens are anthropomorphic alicorn Sues that call themselves unicorns, despite their wings, and use the magic of believing. Believing in what, we never learn, just believing. And the Celestia counterpart is an alicorn with three golden horns that can cast a spell called the Uni-force... Yeah, it&#39;s going down in flames, just as soon as I find out how.</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t access any of the fanfics on that page because the links on the Google Document wouldn&#39;t work, something about needing permission from the document&#39;s original author, so I had to look most of those up myself. Some of the fics have been removed since that document&#39;s creation and, I don&#39;t think that everything on that list was irredeemable enough to be missioned, but most of them are, especially the Star Fleet Magic series. One word: UUUGGGHHHHH.<br>If you want help from others with that one, you could trick some agents (in-universe, of course; actual co-writers would read the fic first) into thinking that it was a crossover with Star Trek. Once they were inside, they&#39;d realize that it wasn&#39;t, but one of your agents could respond with &quot;Well, there&#39;s not much My Little Pony in here, either, is there?&quot; Wait, that sounded better in my head. Either way, any hard feelings that the other agents retain for being tricked could be resolved through the magic of blowing up dimensional aberrations. There&#39;s no bonding quite like the bonding that happens when you destroy a mutual enemy together!<br><br>On another note, that Through the Eyes of Another Pony fic is possibly the most egregious Humans in Equestria author avatar that I have ever seen. Notably, I haven&#39;t seen very many, because I usually stay away from them unless they&#39;re obvious jokes(Choose Your Own Adventure: Brony Hero of Equestria comes to mind there, especially since it was actually pretty funny.), but that one... no. Just no. He contaminates the canon ruthlessly, he can&#39;t keep consistent for his own rules about any of the new components, and he turns Nightmare Moon&#39;s story of jealousy, loss, and madness into &quot;Luna was possessed by a ghost the whole time, and now a second human is controlling that ghost&quot;. And the Author Avatar <i>seduces Luna and gives her access to the Internet</i>. Excuse me while I vent my fury through loud outbursts of Angrish.</p>

Presumably the same plothole as every character besides Percy, Artemis and a brief mention of presumably!Chiron, described as a horse like man.<br>I am a rabid Greek mythology geek and Artemis is my favourite of all the gods, so anything that affects her can go straight to Hades.</p>

            <p>With this fic&#39;s gradually increasing length and exponentially increasing stupidity and bad SPaG, it seems to me like it could be a candidate for Legendary Badfic status, or at least Bleepfic status. Quoting for both pages on the wiki:<br><br>&quot;Legendary Badfic is a collective name for the worst badfic encountered by the PPC, specifically those &#39;fics which most of the community have heard of and (in many cases) been traumatized by.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bleepfics, also known as worsefics, AUGHfics, Glaurunging Badfics and several other terms, are those badfics as painful and terrible to read as any Legendary Badfic, but not well-known enough by the community to be considered truly legendary.&quot;<br><br>So, should it be on at least one of these lists?<br><br>(Also, here&#39;s some good advice from Pinkie Pie on how to deal with badfic: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrPte1uijDw"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrPte1uijDw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrPte1uijDw</a></a>)</p>

            <p>Ok, I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m listening to that song, and all that&#39;s going through my head (besides, &#39;oh, hey, I didn&#39;t realize the show had songs&#39;) is, &#39;how exactly does anyone equate that singing pink pony with Batman??&#39;<br><br>(Ok, fine, it was also a very cute song. Thanks for sharing :) )<br><br>Now, to the actual topic--I do agree with you that this fic&#39;s awful quality (and I barely even read any of it, so...that&#39;s how bad it is) does make it a candidate for at least one of those categories. Most likely the Bleepfic one, unless it&#39;s better known by the community than I think it is...of course, it may become better heard of once there&#39;s a mission for it :)<br><br>On a slightly different note, I&#39;d like to submit <i>this</i> fic for Bleepfic status, at the very least. For being a terrible songfic without disclaimers, for consisting of disconnected chapters consisting of song lyrics with run-on sentences before and after the lyrics, for exceedingly random and unexplained crossovers (including TOS, Star Wars, and I don&#39;t even want to know what else), for odd instances of 21st century movies, ads, and music appearing in the 23rd century, for mentioning Picard before he&#39;s even bloody well <i>born</i>-- *deep breath* For all this and more, and for the complete and utter ruination of Spock&#39;s character--to whit, forcing him to act like a whiny, emotional, human teenager instead of a stoic, logical, half-Vulcan <i>thirty-year-old</i>--for badly-written romance, for badly-formatted songs, for revealing no grasp of the ideas and characters in Star Trek, for <i>currently being 61 chapters of bad songfic and intending to reach 100 chapters</i>, this fic is condemned to be PPC&#39;d and its characters exorcized with extreme prejudice. Although the way it&#39;s going, Spock&#39;ll be a replacement, and can be charged and terminated with extreme prejudice.<br><br>Do you see why I don&#39;t like this fic? It made me run away screaming and crying for goodfic after stupidly reading thirteen chapters at once. Considering that those chapters included Spock singing the words &quot;listen to your heart&quot;, an <i>actual, plausible plot</i> (minus the singing) that was ruined by the text after the song, an unexplained Star Wars crossover, Spock <i>grinned ear to ear</i>, a chapter with a plot that would work perfectly and be almost completely in character--if only the Star Trek characters were Blaine Anderson and the Warblers from Glee, SPOCK yelling &#39;WOOHOO&#39; (as part of a song), some random person named Borris (not a clue where he came from, and I don&#39;t remember him in canon), Picard being mentioned a century before his birth, and, the coup de &#39;grace&#39;, <i>the entire Enterprise crew</i> going to McCoy&#39;s &quot;family ranch&quot; on shore leave. All 400 of them. Yeah. That&#39;s the bit where I ran away screaming. I mean, it was just too much. Spock had been replaced by a human teenager back in chapter 32, McCoy was living in a dump before he joined Starfleet, Spock had Single Tear Syndrome, and McCoy is seriously in love with old music and movies in this fic. Seriously, he sees an ad for Toy Story 3, has a ridiculously old (by his time, anyway) song as his ringtone (and I&#39;ll bet the phone itself looks very 21st century in design), and he&#39;s been watching Star Wars recently. I think he may be addicted to a very strange history channel.<br><br>Oh, yes, and here&#39;s the link: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8860223/1/rare-musical-moments-on-the-USS-Enterprise"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8860223/1/rare-musical-moments-on-the-USS-Enterprise">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8860223/1/rare-musical-moments-on-the-USS-Enterprise</a></a> Read it if you dare. I&#39;m also claiming the bloody thing, although I wouldn&#39;t mind a co-writer when the time comes to actually take it on. Oh, and did I mention it spawns mini-tribbles as well? Not too many, but they&#39;re there.<br><br>Ugh. Off to skim through the new chapters and eat several bars of Bleepolate...<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Wait, huh? Ok, weird. Really, really weird.<br><br>That&#39;s what really bugs me about this fic (or one thing, anyway). This music is all really, really, really old by the time they&#39;re supposedly singing it. It&#39;s also often inappropriate for the culture and heritage of the person singing (see: Spock singing with abysmal grammar, Gaila singing Adele...) Even worse, the songs occasionally are meant to tell a story that matches up with the characters&#39; story, and completely fails--such as Uhura singing Taylor Swift&#39;s &quot;Love Story&quot;. Now, I don&#39;t have anything against Taylor Swift, but I can&#39;t see Uhura singing her songs, and what&#39;s even worse is that the story in the song doesn&#39;t at all fit the Spock/Nyota romance. At all. Ugh.<br><br>But seriously, this whole singing really old songs thing? It&#39;s about the same as if I were to write a 100-chapter fic about people singing...well...the only thing I can come up with right now is Gilbert &amp; Sullivan opera, because I&#39;m not actually all that sure what music was popular in the Victorian era. Actually, I probably do know some folk songs, but most of them may be even older...but that&#39;s the thing: having the Enterprise crew rocking out to &quot;I&#39;ve got a feeling&quot; is about the same as if I wrote something dealing with...I don&#39;t know, the cast of <i>Glee</i>--no, wait, they actually sing a lot canonically. Uh...let&#39;s go with...all the BBC Sherlock characters having a party to the sounds of:<br><br><i>Ring the merry bells on boardship, rend the air with warbling wild<br>For the union of His Lordship with a humble captain&#39;s child!</i> (from G&amp;S&#39; HMS Pinafore)<br><br>I mean, admittedly, with Sherlock canons it could be written off as a tribute to the original Sherlock Holmes stories, but...it still seems very strange, doesn&#39;t it? I mean, it would be one thing if they were singing the modern remakes of those songs, but as it is...it kind of feels like Bones is addicted to a weird history channel and the others have no excuse. Or frequently watch it with him.<br><br>(Just as long as they don&#39;t start singing High School Musical...)<br><br>Right, the concert! If it&#39;s held after this mission, then I can just see Agent Dawn hugging herself and grinning, mumbling, &#39;Sweet, sweet canonical music, how I love thee. Let me count the ways...&#39; And then whoever&#39;s sitting next to her either tells her to be quiet and enjoy the music or, if it&#39;s a student, probably asks how she&#39;s managing to enjoy this. (Also, it turns out that Dawn has now become the [future] part-time coordinator of the Avengers OFU, mostly because her sister is the full-time coordinator. Make of that what you will.<br><br>Ah, got it. Well, she&#39;s quite welcome; and I&#39;ve got some missions to write before I get to this one anyway. In fact, I&#39;m still working on the first one...<br><br>*Gives a cheer for OFAS* *Runs off to write that pesky first mission*<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

By the end of all 100 chapters, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll all have been replaced, except perhaps for some of the more minor characters, and even that&#39;s a bit iffy.<br><br>Ugh, yeah--this fic in no way reminds me of the ideals and social standards of Star Trek&#39;s 23rd century. Agent Tanya is most welcome to join; I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be welcomed with open arms.<br><br>Scottie...*sigh* Well, I&#39;m sure Agent Dawn would like a pet dog...<br><br>As long as you don&#39;t mind that I already have some ideas for what happens during this mission, you&#39;re quite welcome to join (as in, I&#39;ll probably glomp you and not let go until you threaten to leave, after which I&#39;ll get down on my knees and beg you not to). I have a Star Trek fanfic that&#39;s been in the works for a while, and I want to bring them in--and even have a way to do it--so that they can, uh, join in the fun. I can elaborate more on both the fanfic and the ideas about bringing them in if asked :) Anyway, I (and my agents) will be <i>extremely</i> glad to work with you and Agent Tanya. You can (try) to keep us all from becoming too insane :)<br><br>(I really, really want a wonderful fic about McCoy and Joanna and several wonderful episodes full of Vulcan and Doctor snark and--and--and Kirk in there somewhere, and I should probably just go watch TOS, shouldn&#39;t I. That gives me everything except for Joanna.)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t actually see them in badfic that much. Just Shaundrah and Jack Russel. Doesn&#39;t mean that we don&#39;t need a class, though. Sues and Stus <i>do</i> underestimate the capabilities of many Trekverse villains. Ooh, Lore would have something to say about his lusters. &quot;I am not the &#39;bad boy&#39; version of Data!

            <p>At first, when I was reading this abomination(curse my morbid curiosity!), all of the rampant spelling errors in the first sentence and the lack of premise made me think &quot;This has got to be a troll.&quot; Then I realized that I was on the twelfth chapter. When I went back and looked at the first few chapters, that statement turned into a sanity-preservation mantra.<br>I skimmed the fic for minis, having a hunch that this would break the mini-collection record that was until recently hoisted begrudgingly by the mission for &quot;Rainbowdash goes to the Mushroom Kinkdom&quot;. It did, and it did so by a <i>lot</i>. There are THIRTY-NINE MINIS HERE. Even not counting the two mini-Sues and the minis of Trekverse technology (I&#39;m not sure if misspellings that aren&#39;t places or characters get their own minis), this blows the old record out of the water.<br>I <u>have</u> to focus only on the abuse of spelling and grammar rather than the other flaws. One flaw above all others. If I do not, and I realize the full immensity of this fic&#39;s stupidity at once, I will go completely rathive maggots for hours.<br>This has got to be a troll. This has got to be a troll. This has got to be a troll.<br><br>Oh, wait... (digs out newbie gifts) I know I had Bleeprin candy in here somewhere. AH! THE AMBROSIA OF LETHE ITSELF! (consumes several &quot;Bleep&#39;n&#39;ms&quot;)<br>Hoooo... I&#39;m fine now. All I can remember now is the sheer number of minis that Suethor made of Icheb. Thanks, Khaosity, for temporarily staving off the encroach of my madness!<br><br>Seriously, though, it&#39;s actually a good thing you&#39;re waiting a while to spork this one. Your agents should probably get a buffer of slightly less awful missions beforehand. This is <i>not</i> a first mission. This is the sort of mission that the Sequoia(or Rain, as I&#39;ve heard she likes to be called) would give her agents when they&#39;ve been bad.</p>

For once, my impulsive &quot;Ooh, Youtube link!&quot; reaction has actually helped out.<br><br>I had always thought that trollfics were distilling and amplifying all that made badfic bad for the &quot;lulz&quot;. Yet, I suppose even archetypical trolls like Peter Chimera had to take notes from <i>something</i> on how to make readers&#39; skin crawl.<br>Normally, this sort of revelation would fill me with a deep, primal horror, the sort of feeling you only get when you realize that what you just saw was even worse than the already world-wrecking awfulness that it had been the first time around. Now, it&#39;s not, for some reason. I&#39;m chalking it up to either temporary mental numbness from shock or residual exposure to Pinkie Pie. Probably a lot of the latter with a sprinkling of the former.<br><br>What did your agents do the first time to get them saddled with <i>this</i> as their <i>second-ever</i> mission? I&#39;m not saying reveal spoilers; that would be no fun. Can you give me a hint, though? Did it involve accidentally killing a canon? Did some planet get assimilated that ought not to have been? Did their Psych profiles show an unusual tolerance to horrible plot contrivance?</p>

            <p>Though I will say it isn&#39;t as bad as what you&#39;re thinking. <br><br>Though, honestly, Pinkie&#39;s reaction has been mine when going through this fic. Yes, it&#39;s horrid, but some time ago it crossed the line of &quot;unspeakably bad&quot; and twisted back around to &quot;extremely entertaining&quot;. So I&#39;m feeling like my agents might be laughing, that this might be almost a <i>break</i> for them, I mean, <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2883020/1/It-s-not-a-blender-it-s-a-coffeemaker">this</a> was their first mission, and while it looks short, it goes badly.</p>

            <p>Actually, out of those two, the one you just posted was the one that crossed over to laugh-out-loud ridiculous for me. Maybe its the fact that there are unexplained fantasy elements crossing into the Trekverse at random times, or maybe it&#39;s the unintentionally hilarious lines like &quot;Are you an angle?&quot;<br>Yes, Ensign, she is.

            <p>Yep, hi. <br>I&#39;m AelinTheAmazing - at least, that&#39;s the name I tend to use on the net. Aelin is perfectly fine - friends also call me Fungus. Why? All you need to know is that it involves a friend of mine, summer holidays, and a dried-out paint tray.<br>I&#39;ve been into stuff like the PPC for quite a while, since I have an unfortunate problem I&#39;ve dubbed &quot;train-wreck syndrome&quot; - when I find a badfic, I&#39;m immediately compelled to read it. Sometimes I can resist it, sometimes not. <br>Originally I came across the PPC while hunting desperately for a sign that there were other people who felt the way I did about badfic. However, I only just got around to putting up this message, due to my bad habit of complete laziness and the fact that I&#39;m also kind of nervous about introducing myself to new people.<br>As displayed by my extensive list of fandoms, I read pretty much anything I can get my hands on. I used to write badfics without even knowing what they were... rest assured, I have figuratively burned them (I would literally, but I&#39;m technically not allowed to play with fire). At the moment, I usually write original fiction, and put far too many characters into everything because I come up with too many different personalities that simply won&#39;t mix. <br>In real life, those who know me well call me insane. I&#39;m not insane - I simply have eccentric tendencies. Or at least that&#39;s what I like to think. Those who don&#39;t know me think I&#39;m either opinionated, threatening, or annoying, and that I read too much. <br>I&#39;m a bit of a grammar and spelling freak and own an imaginary cat due to my psychosis from cat deprivation. I&#39;m a bird addict (really animals in general), although I&#39;m by far a cat person. With other kinds of animals (both imaginary and not), I love Venezuelan poodle moths, Tribbles, least weasels, sea urchins, and Japanese silky chickens. <br>I speak English, passable intermediate Chinese, some Latin, and bits of German and French. I also play violin and draw a lot, and am a soccer and cricket fanatic. I also have really weird tastes in music - mostly music no one else knows about. I live in California (Los Angeles, to be precise), which is just as great as it&#39;s made out to be, although if I could have my pick I&#39;d move to Tasmania. <br>My fandoms... Artemis Fowl, Chronicles of Narnia, Doctor Who, Dragonriders of Pern, anything by Tamora Pierce, Graceling, Sherlock, Lord of the Rings, Monty Python, Redwall, Watership Down, and nearly any musical you care to name. I&#39;m also good with Shakespeare, Astйrix and the Phoenix manga. And Pokйmon - it is awesome. And though the Inheritance Cycle is terrible, I know quite a lot of bizarre trivia on it nevertheless.<br>So, that&#39;s me, and once again, hi, and I&#39;m glad to be here.<br></p>

            <p>I read all four books, the first two before I was well-versed enough to realize that they were more than just the usual sort of bad, and I know most of what makes its canon tick, in-story geographical and psychological aberrations notwithstanding for obvious reasons. It&#39;s annoying, really, since I also know that everything going on there would be a mess to write a mission on. You can&#39;t tell how warped a canon is when it was never put together well in the first place.<br><br>For example, I realize now that for most of the secondary characters, diagnosing character replacement would be impossible, due to how much their personalities vacillate randomly in the course of the story itself. It was pretty egregious, especially with King Orrin.<br>That, and the magic system and laws of physics bend over backwards to give all of any protagonists&#39;s opponents a hard time, except in the case of Galbatorix, who, in order to be on the same level as the protagonists for the Big Showdown, goes from malevolent caricature to Villain Stu in the course of one scene. That has to be some sort of record. What sort of scale would we judge Suvian manipulation of the world&#39;s rules when they aren&#39;t internally consistent in the original story?<br><br>I&#39;m going to stop now before this turns into a rant, assuming that it hasn&#39;t already.</p>

            <p>Your point about vacillating personalities is definitely a good one. Perhaps it would be possible to pin down when the offending fic takes place, and take what &#39;should&#39; be canon from around then... or just give it up as a bad job and spend our mental energy on surviving bad smut.</p>

            <p>With that continuum, only the worst of the worst fics should even be considered for missions, since the canon is so full of Suvians that, as you said, agents would have a hard time not killing the canons before leaving the world.  That being said, if anyone ever goes to the Inheritance continuum again, they should kill <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3508182/1/a-whole-new-world">this repulsive mess</a> before doing anything else. (If you didn&#39;t pick up on it in the post title, the story is definitely a Bleepfic, so proceed with caution if you click on the link.) Even by the standards of that continuum, it is horrendous.<br>When a crossover mini using two continua that are not even being written about in the rest of the fic, two Norse mythology minis (mini-jцtunn? mini-svartбlfar? mini-norns? These are all good mini ideas, I think.), trivialization of psychopathic murder (and in the Inheritance continuum, that&#39;s saying something), a talking egg, spelling and grammar so bad that entire paragraphs lose their meaning, and at least eight major Mary Sue tropes are used within <u>the first chapter</u>, and the main character is a demigod Sue that upstages every one of the already incredibly Suvian dragon riders, the story is a big enough blight that no Flower would deny the need for it to be purged.<br><br>On the bright side, the agents who&#39;d run that mission would get to be the first people to charge for trans-dimensional snatching of a god from World One mythology, at least as far as I know. Wait, that&#39;s only a bright side when you look past how incredibly stupid that charge is, or rather, how stupid the situation would have to be to make that charge.<br><br>I wonder what a mini-Gohma and mini-Balrog would even look like crossed together. I&#39;m imagining a scorpion creature with horns, a carapace radiating intense heat, and segmented demonic limbs. It would probably be able to set its claws on fire to imitate the blazing swords that some Balrogs carry.</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t want to read any more of that fic than I had to, which led to me missing that important detail. That, and I almost never read the genre tags regardless of the fic&#39;s quality. It&#39;s still a repugnant mess, though, and troll fiction that&#39;s that painful to read is still treated as badfic, so it should be purged anyway.<br><br>I don&#39;t know who takes charge of it now, though. If it was just a regular preposterously overpowered Sue, the Department of Mary Sues would take it without question(though with considerable retching), but bad troll fiction has been handled by DMS, the Department of Technical Errors, and in one case, the Department of Bad Parody.<br>They all have legitimate claims to troll disposal, though the Department of Bad Parody&#39;s one (unfinished, to boot) Troll Division mission created some sort of giant Troll Author Avatar to cause trouble and never actually showed it or what it could do before the mission was abandoned, and I have no idea how much that affects the mission format in general for bad trollfic.<br><br>If you end up killing it yourself, can I adopt Blard the mini-Norse mythological figure(jцtunn?)? I promise I won&#39;t let him freeze anyone to death unless there&#39;s no other option...<br>The adoption center will probably have a hard time adopting out Ganondalf, but I&#39;m sure that there&#39;s a special room for crossover minis.</p>

            <p>Hi and welcome to the PPC. It looks like you&#39;ve already left your sanity at the door, so you&#39;ll fit in quite well! I wonder what kind of missions you will be writing once you get Permission. DTE? DF? The good old DMS?<br><br>Oh yeah, your gift!<br>*rummages through Pokemon-Trainer-issue bag of holding*<br>*holds Poke Ball* Aha!<br>(SFX: Poke Ball opening)<br>Meet Ditto. But it&#39;s not just any Ditto: It&#39;s a <i>Pokemon Adventures</i>-verse Ditto, able to Transform into anything that it has seen, not just anything in front of it. (If you&#39;ve read the manga, you know that this is what Green&#39;s Ditto can do.) Perfect for such a multi-fandom Boarder like yourself!</p>

            <p>Howdy, howdy, how...dy! *tries to mimic inflection with which this phrase is always said by my father*<br><br>Welcome, welcome, I see we share several fandoms. Artemis Fowl, Chronicles of Narnia, Doctor Who (to a small extent, it&#39;s awesome, but I haven&#39;t seen much), Lord of the Rings, and Pokйmon! Although I am a wee bit intimidated by your language proficiency. ^_^; I suppose that just means I should get off my bum and fix that is all. XD Are you into manga in general, or just Astйrix and the Phoenix, which is unfamilar to me.<br><br>I am a little curious how your imaginary cat would get along with my invisible guinea pig? Think they would be friends? It is a rather large guinea pig after all. Now on to gifts, you must have gifts to welcome you! I&#39;d like to present you with a mysterious pokйball, rumored to contain a shiny little Skitty and a jar containing a will &#39;o the wisp flame. And my invisible guinea pig insists I throw in a pack of limited edition Alantian sponge capsules he just picked up on his last visit home. Just add water and you get an instant full sized sponge city with architectural design style(s) of your whim!</p>

            <p>Manga is a favorite genre of mine, though I haven&#39;t read a lot more than what&#39;s listed here. I&#39;m not sure if Astйrix is technically manga, since that&#39;s usually Japanese, but I do love it. <br>Perhaps I will use these sponges to make a replica of Rivendell, my favorite fictional city of all time. ;) <br>I think our invisible pets would certainly get along well! Thankfully, I&#39;ve managed to train said cat to not eat any small furry animals belonging to other people, as it tends to offend them. </p>

            <p>Ah, well there is an awful lot of manga out there so that&#39;s not really as surprising as one might fear. XD Some of my favorites are Hana Kimi, W Juliet, Black Butler, Demon Diary, Vampire Game, Red River, anything by Yuu Watase, Kodocha, Sailor Moon (I love the new release with the Japanese names!) and Trigun.<br><br>Nice! I would love to visit sometime! The last time I broke them out in public, I had several people (and a sheep, though they were more concerned with chewing on the place than designing it) designing the rooms, we had quite the mish-mash palace. XD My guinea pig lives on an island that tows around the Bermuda Triangle, but I hear he&#39;s docked right now, so I told him he should come visit too. ^_^</p>

I like Narnia and Watership Down, too, but I decided that it would be in the best interests of my childhood not to read any fanfic in those categories. Monty Python is, of course, amazing, and I tend to randomly sing songs from Sweeney Todd when I&#39;m bored. Sometimes even in public :-) We most definitely share the Lord of the Rings fandom!

Let&#39;s look through your fandoms for a bit.. ooh, Pern <u>and</u> LotR; the admins will <i>love</i> you. Ah, we share the Doctor Who fandom! That&#39;s good, because I&#39;ve a got an adorable little Cybermat here that I&#39;ve been wanting to give someone for a while now. Don&#39;t worry about the teeth; he&#39;s domesticated. He might go after a neighborhood dog or too, but that&#39;s only because they don&#39;t have any robot parts. It&#39;s a perfectly logical reaction.</p>

            <p>I’m about to start the actual writing portion of my new tumblr fashion Blog “Stolen Upholstery” Which focuses on the fashion, culture, and character design of characters from Star Trek: VOYAGER tv show. I’ve recently finally completed the entire series, but I’m not sure where to start so far as my blog.<br><br>So this is where y’all come in! Answer with your favourite Voyager episodes with cool designs. This can range from sets, aliens, or onboard fashions (Holodeck, Neelix, I&#39;m looking at y&#39;all). <br><br>So what are YOUR favourite Voyager alien or costume designs?

            <p>Favorite Costumes?<br>-Captain Proton. It&#39;s goofy but I absolutely LOVED seeing a character from Star Trek playing in the Holodeck, even something as silly as Captain Proton, and not caring how cheesy it was. More people need to have fun in the holodeck.<br><br>-The Various ones from &#39;The Killing Game&#39;. I love the Hirogen, not only for being a Predator-lite species, but that they&#39;re so different from other run-of-the-mill encounters, and they appear enough to be recurring, a valid threat, and memorable. All the different costumes used by the crew for the simulations were great to see.<br><br>-Any episode with the Viidians (or however you spell it). The idea of a race hat was once thriving, and is not left with no options but stealing organs in a desperate attempt to survive was something that drew me emotionally in like few TV shows have done. <br><br>For individual Species, The Hirogen, Vidians, an the Tak Tak (Though they were a one-off species). </p>

            <p>That was <i>awesome</i>. Everything else in Captain Proton, but that is the best. In a purely girly-fashion way, Seven&#39;s dress in &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot; was pretty. The crew also looked pretty amazing in &quot;The Killing Game&quot; - again, also a fan of Seven&#39;s outfit there.<br><br>As for alien designs, the Borg are always awesome, and the Vidiians are cool in a creepy way. And there&#39;s a reason the macroviruses, despite having only one episode, were included in the PPC-verse. <br><br>That should be a start. Post the link to your blog when you have it up!</p>

            <p>Yes, really. If anyone remembers the original run (or stumble) of this, frankly I&#39;ll be impressed - it was eight years ago and lasted about a week.<br><br>But it&#39;s back!

            <p>It was from Carpe Jugulum. It said that past Lancre, nobody really bothered to &quot;balance two dots on another letter, where they&#39;d only roll off and cause unnecessary punctuation&quot;. If that line wasn&#39;t such a good example of Pratchett, I&#39;d probably be a little annoyed by the discontinuity. Then again, in the Discworld, there is no discontinuity, only a series of alternate pasts.<br>I&#39;m mostly a bit put out that I didn&#39;t get a mini out of that, really, but I&#39;ll just wait until another comes along that I&#39;d like to adopt. Maybe there will be a Rhys Rhysson mini around later. Not likely, because I don&#39;t think fanbrats would know about him, but it&#39;s possible.</p>

            <p>(After all, he probably has plenty of spares)<br><br>Yup, <i>The Fifth Elephant</i> is one of the ones I was thinking of. Just had a quick skim through it, and (among various other characters) Angua uses Uberwald - I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;d know the correct pronunciation. <br><br>Vetinari uses Uberwald too, again, I would expect him to know the correct pronunciation.<br><br>But the most telling one, for me, is that the narration uses Uberwald. The stuff in dialogue you could maybe rationalise away as people mispronouncing it, but I don&#39;t think that works quite as well for the narrator. <br><br>And on a vestigial tail (an appendage almost completely unrelated to <i>everything</i>), if I remember rightly, the PPC hivemind decided that minis could only come from missions or OFUs and had to have originated in a badfic somewhere. Things would probably have to get quite meta for the title of a work to end up being referenced in the badfic itself. <br><br>However, if that did happen, I&#39;d be tempted to say that it would create a mini (and be the normal mini for that continuum), particularly if there have been a whole bunch of regular minis already. I imagine that each mini destabilises the canon slightly, so that as you get more of them it becomes more likely that you&#39;ll get further ones, and that mistakes which might normally be overlooked would start forming minis. While minis are normally formed from mistakes with a character&#39;s name, or sometimes places, the title of a book is a name too. <br><br>It&#39;s probably more likely that books would get mentioned in fanfics for other continua, so a <i>Harry Potter</i> Sue saying how much she enjoyed reading &#39;the Lod of the Rings&#39; - would something like that create a mini-Balrog or a mini-Aragog?<br></p>

            <p>Anything connected to a fandom creates the mini for that fandom, and this occurs even when the badfic that creates the mini is fanfiction for a completely different continuum. This has precedent in the mission &quot;Lucid Nonsense&quot;, in which a Suefluenced Holly Short mentioned &quot;Sherlock Homes&quot; and spawned a mini-Baskerville in a crossover between two unrelated continua.<br><br>For minis created from books within the canon itself, I don&#39;t see why they should be treated any differently from the minis based on the misspelling of that work in the context of different continua, though I agree that the circumstances for creating a mini of a title within the same canon would be a lot stranger. </p>

            <p>Though, I suppose three chapters isn&#39;t enough of a sample size to base that sort of assumption on, and I am almost certain that the word &quot;prolific&quot; is not intended to be used that way. Still, three chapters in under a week says &quot;prolific&quot; to me, and no thesaurus website that I could find gave up a more accurate word to use, so prolific it is!<br>Ridcully was especially brilliant in this one.

            <p>I was never certain on what the OFU policy was for finding minis. Do we just report whichever minis we found in badfics, or would there have to have been a mission to that continuum where they were picked up? Because if it&#39;s the former, I have Sam Vines, Ventinari, Vetinar, and Granny Wetherwax to donate to the Discworld&#39;s foremost center for fanbrat reconditioning.<br><br>Also, the two minis from the one known mini-finding PPC mission to the Disc, Ms. Cakes and Carrrot, are not in the master list.

            <p>... PPC standard is (I believe) that all minis have to appear in a mission or OFU to be registered.

            <p>So, they&#39;d need to be in missions or an OFU to be put in the registry at all? That&#39;s a little disappointing, but at least the two I reported with a mission are being registered. I don&#39;t suppose any of the missionless misspellings I found will be showing up in OFUDisc, then, will they? I remember other OFUs mentioning that misspellings reported to them could be put in as minis, but I was never certain of the process, as I said before.<br><br>If this counts, I found a <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=230292;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">topic on the Board</a> that brings out the mini-Luggage Ventinari. It&#39;s still not much, but it&#39;s more PPC-based than just finding minis around the Internet, and it looks like there still aren&#39;t a lot on the Official Adoption Record. It probably wouldn&#39;t mean anything, because it&#39;s not a real PPC story, but four minis is still a very low number for a Fanfiction University.</p>

            <p>Hi! I am reading (mini-Luggages are cool!) and...certificate? Fun! (Also, am I actually the first/only person to have a mini-Luggage? It kind of looks that way...)<br><br>Agent Edgar Sullivan of the DIC is taking care of Carrrot, and bemusing and confusing (and occasionally amusing) his partner while doing so. I&#39;m sure he&#39;d be quite happy to have an adoption certificate, and would hang it proudly on the wall along with the nonexistent one for his mini-Balrog, Neinor...<br><br>(Edgar hasn&#39;t actually showed up yet--although technically none of my agents have officially appeared anywhere yet--but he should pop up after several missions. He also seemed the most likely agent to have a mini-Luggage, and who wouldn&#39;t want a mini-Luggage anyway?)<br><br>Also, just a quick note--I believe Ms. Cakes is actually ms. Cakes, unless I&#39;m misremembering what I read in the mission...<br><br>I&#39;m starting to get the feeling that my agents are eventually going to be completely overrun by minis and other pets, and I&#39;m going to have to set up some sort of shared living space for the minis. Should be interesting. Maybe some of them can vacation at the Avengers OFU...<br><br>(I kind of want to see what a mini-Luggage of the Luggage would act like. I think it would be wonderfully terrifying, and something I would never want to meet in RL.)<br><br>Also, hS...? You remember how you told me it was alright if I wrote meta stuff as long as I could do it well/edit it if it came out badly? Well, it&#39;s grown into an entire storyline, and it&#39;s coming in quite early on. As in, the first mission. I don&#39;t think my missions and interludes are going to be particularly &quot;normal&quot; in terms of general mission/interlude content...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I would totally print them out if I had a printer. Sadly, I&#39;m away from home for the year, and printerless, so instead I&#39;ll just save them on my computer and print them out in about four or five months. Thank you!<br><br>Let&#39;s see, how many minis do my agents collectively have now? Brenda has one, Charlie has two, Edgar now has two, Agen____t has none, Dawn has two and a tribble, and Nariel (Dawn&#39;s sister, and technically Miss Nariel as she&#39;s a coordinator) also has two...and then there&#39;s another...and yet another tribble...so that makes approximately twelve minis and pets, give or take a bunch of tribbles. Wow. And I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be picking up more from missions--mini-tribbles are a necessity. I think the time for marginalization of minis is over; the way this is going, they&#39;ll be ruling HQ by the end of things--<br><br>Oh no, now I&#39;m picturing them all having a meeting and deciding to actually do that...and, knowing my brain, that&#39;ll somehow end up as part of the actual storyline, even if it&#39;s just an April Fool&#39;s interlude...and then there&#39;s this Supernatural comic about a secret evil society of innocent-looking dogs...oh wow.<br><br>And this is how my craziest ideas get started: something pops up, I think it would be hilarious, and then I figure out how to make it work. Fortunately, I do know how to keep a leash on the most insane ones; odds are, the Mini Takeover will either fail or be a dream/April Fool&#39;s chapter...or the minis might get their own department, you never know.<br><br>Wow, that&#39;s a lot of important things. Well, I tend to think these ideas are funny, and one or two other people have reacted similarly, so hopefully I&#39;m safe there. Fun to write? Definitely. Well-written? Hopefully, and it&#39;ll be run through at least one beta anyway. Doesn&#39;t tear holes in the &#39;canon&#39;? I don&#39;t think anything I&#39;ve come up with so far does, but I&#39;ll be sure to run anything really unusual/crazy by the Board for safety. And I&#39;m definitely not afraid to edit after posting (unless it&#39;s a completely abandoned story, in which case I&#39;d probably just leave it unless it was something really minor), although I should hope most issues would be caught at the beta stage.<br><br>Ok, I wrote this ages ago and should have clicked &#39;Post Reply&#39; instead of letting it sit. Sorry!<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>With all of the unsupervised minis from the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings continua alone, the minis would probably be able to overrun a few hallways before someone alerts the Tiger Lily. Involving the rest would only make it easier for the minis to spread across HQ.<br>Plus, if mini-tribbles are capable of parthenogenetic spawning like their full-sized versions do, even if it&#39;s every once in a while, the newborn doubles would be able to serve as shock troops for the Tribble Primes.<br>The forces of misspelling would need some sort of stabilizing force, of course. A leader or an organizer, who would support the cause and yet be able to coordinate it. Otherwise, they&#39;d never be able to stay in line when the DIA comes out wielding the ever-tempting trays of raw meat.<br><br>That last paragraph was written ten minutes before this one. I just got back from seeing if there were any good minis of Theodore Roosevelt. No dice. They&#39;re all in Newsies fanfiction. I didn&#39;t even know there <i>was</i> Newsies fanfiction before today. Reminds me of the time I found a Casper the Friendly Ghost Suefic. Who <i>does</i> that? I found two Winston Churchill minis called Chirchill and Winston Chruchill in a Doctor Who Suefic, though, so maybe there will be a few mini-British Prime Ministers picked up in the future.<br><br>Of course, even with a mini-Historical Figure to lead them, I&#39;m not saying that the mini takeover wouldn&#39;t still fail. The DIA probably wouldn&#39;t even take them seriously. Still, it would be pretty fun to write about the attempt, especially if they take over the Armory and figure out how to operate the rocket launchers.<br>Wait, aren&#39;t minis mute? The only ones I know that have a vocabulary above a handful of words are the mini-Aragogs, and I&#39;m pretty sure not even other minis would trust mini-Aragogs to be good negotiators. How would the mini faction state their demands? I suppose they could always just have one of the Pirates of the Caribbean monkey minis write their demands down. The monkey minis have thumbs, which most mini races lack.<br><br>Also, unrelated questions. What actually is Agen_<strong><em>t? Edgar used gender-neutral pronouns when referring to xim in the April Fools mission, so obviously xie isn&#39;t human. Is Agen</em></strong>_t xir name, or a title? What species is xie? What continuum is xie from? Am I conjugating these gender-neutral pronouns correctly?</p>

It&#39;s happening. &gt;XD<br><br>I&#39;ve got a theory...that whenever a mini-tribble is repeated, it just gives birth to a double. In fact, that theory just popped into my head now, but it seems vaguely logical...thoughts? Alternatively, they give birth to mini-tribbles with nonsense gibberish for names, or with names that are anagrams of the original mini-tribbles&#39; names...<br><br><br>Agen_<strong><em>t is...an agent. Alright, alright, real answer: Agen</em></strong><em>t technically is human--ze&#39;s just not a particularly ordinary one. That is, ze has yet to choose a gender.<br><br>Agen</em><strong><em>t is a badfic recruit. Zer author wanted three S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to accompany her Sue as bodyguards of some sort. She thought of two names, and forgot about the third: she meant to write &#39;Agent _</em></strong>&#39; and then fill in the blank later, but the blank ended up in the middle of the word, and she posted the chapter without filling in a name. Agen_<strong><em>t had an extremely minimal part in the badfic, and was never given a gender or any description at all, beyond being included in general descriptions of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Ze was given several surprisingly logical lines (questions quickly shot down by the Sue), and then was forgotten about, and subsequently fell into a plothole. The PPC agents assigned to the fic pulled zer out and recruited zer. As zer bit character personality consisted of logic/common sense and stubbornness, ze refused to choose a name before settling on a gender, and refused to settle on a gender without knowing more about zerself and what genders even meant. Ze spends time in FicPsych now (and was given the general S.H.I.E.L.D. agent memory implants by them), mostly talking through problems to figure out what ze does and doesn&#39;t like. Agen</em></strong><em>t has chosen a hair color, but zer height fluctuates and ze wears contacts to cover up the fact that zer eyes are currently an undefined color.<br><br>So basically: Agen</em><strong><em>t is human, of an undefined gender, and Agen</em></strong><em>t is zer name because ze refuses to choose a name arbitrarily. Ze originated as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in the 2012 <i>Avengers</i>verse.<br><br>Re: gender-neutral pronouns: Are you conjugating correctly? I haven&#39;t the foggiest idea. I&#39;ve just been using ze and zer, although there was originally an x in there instead of a z...I don&#39;t actually know what I&#39;m doing. I just settled on ze and zer, although zir might make more sense, to be consistent.<br><br>But thanks for noticing Agen</em><strong><em>t :) Ze&#39;s gained a surprising amount of backstory, really, considering that I, uh, made zir up because I kept writing &#39;Agen</em></strong><em>t&#39; instead of &#39;Agent _</em><strong>&#39; for Edgar&#39;s unidentified partner...And did that enough times that I ended up starting a paragraph with, &#39;Uh. Is the mysterious agent’s name Agen</strong>__t, by some chance? Because that keeps coming out…&#39; Ze was nearly an MI6 agent, but I quickly settled on <i>Avengers</i> as zir home continuum rather than <i>James Bond</i> (you can tell what I&#39;d been watching).<br><br>So, yeah. Sorry the reply&#39;s late, hope the fact that it&#39;s long makes up for that :)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>It makes perfect sense! With fanbrats to keep them occupied and a constant supply of bacon and fellow minis, they&#39;d <u>never</u> think to overthrow <u>anything</u>! They&#39;d have no leadership, no defenses, no plan... it&#39;s beautiful in its simplicity.<br>Of course, the minis without an OFU or those still left in the adoption centers would be as prone to revolt as any others, and if enough new minis were to be sent in at once time...<br>Now I&#39;m planning something. It is very silly, but I&#39;m planning something, Permission pending and a few missions in of course.

I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a real term for that group of minis, and I would have said &quot;owners&quot; if not for the fact that minis most often refuse to be &quot;owned&quot; by anyone.<br>I suppose that some OFUs have an official staff member specifically for mini-corralling, like Argus Filch for the Official Fanfiction University of Hogwarts, but for the ones that don&#39;t, I don&#39;t know if getting a bunch of minis in one place and saying &quot;You six go down that hallway and guard the staff section. The rest of you... go cause some trouble.&quot; is really keeping them supervised. It sort of seems like the opposite.<br>That, of course, is a defining point in my plan.<br>(steeples fingers villainously)</p>

            <p>hS: Cassie is indeed in charge of the mini-Balrog adoption center. I should know--she was the one I talked to in order to adopt six mini-Balrogs in the first place!<br><br>Outhra: I have a nice long start to a reply to your Mini Takeover post, and it&#39;s on my laptop, which is currently battery-dead. I&#39;ll get it to you somewhere around Sunday or Monday, when I have the charger again.<br><br>With that said...<br><br>I do hope you don&#39;t mind if I end up writing my take on the mini takeover as well, since it&#39;s already partially formed in my head (and because I can get a bunch of mini-Furys--that&#39;s mini-Nick Furys--in on it without much trouble). Our plans sound pretty different, though, so I doubt there&#39;ll be a problem with close similarities...<br><br>I pity whoever&#39;s in charge of corralling the mini-Furys, I really do. I feel like everyone would try to make Fury do it himself, and then, when he slips out of doing it, they&#39;d try...Agent Dawn, probably, but that doesn&#39;t work too well, since she&#39;s only there part-time (and, possibly, it results in the attempted Mini Takeover), so they have to try someone else...a crazy person suggests the students, but that&#39;s vetoed fairly quickly...and then, well, I don&#39;t know, actually. They&#39;re probably just kept very busy so that they won&#39;t get into trouble--which, of course, fails, since these <i>are</i> minis of Nick Fury, after all, and they are possessed of varying levels of sneakiness. So I suppose there really needs to be someone in charge of them. Possibly Odin? Hm. I think I&#39;d better ask Karen what she thinks; I don&#39;t seem to be able to figure it out on my own.<br><br>Anyway.

            <p>I believe you&#39;re quite right about Marie. Although it would be amusing to see the shovel come into play. I get the feeling the minis would end up either leaving her alone or treating her with some sort of respect if she ended up bashing them with a shovel.<br><br>That sounds like it could make a wonderful argument, really...in my mind/headcanon, the minis act a lot like Fury, only with aspects of their namesake&#39;s character as well. So for instance, pepper would be intelligent and sneaky, and like Tony, tony would be extremely intelligent, snarky, good at leadership, and be very fond of Pepper, etc. As for Midguard and Asguard, I&#39;m not completely sure--maybe they&#39;d take on aspects of their namesakes&#39; inhabitants&#39; personality? Who knows. But yeah. What do you think?<br><br>(Now may be a good time to mention that I&#39;m still rather new to the idea of having minis that are minis of human[oid] canon characters, and I&#39;m still figuring out how they even work in the first place. The mini-Furys amuse me, though.)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>From what I&#39;ve seen of human-minis, they&#39;re similar in personality to the human they are based from, but are affected on a secondary level by their naming aberration. Of course, most of the time human-minis are smaller versions of the character that they&#39;re misspelled from rather than versions of one character created by misspelling of other characters, so it&#39;s not fully set, but you&#39;re the writer(well, co-writer) of their OFU! You have exclusive rights to hammer out the details.<br><br>Can minis come from reviews of badfics rather than badfics themselves? Because after I heard of the Avengers OFU, I was looking around the Internet to see exactly how much Avengers fanfiction there really was, and encountered &quot;the Oncredible Hulk&quot; in a series of comments. You can have him if you want, and if you decide he exists. I also found the mini &quot;Nuck Fury&quot; in a bad role-play, if you decide he&#39;s valid, too.<br>That brings up another question: what would Nick Fury&#39;s personal misspellings act like? If Nuck Fury&#39;s a mini-Nick who acts like Nick Fury... would he just be an exaggerated Nick Fury? Like he&#39;s doing a constant &quot;look, I&#39;m the boss&quot; impression of the sort that would be used by exasperated S.H.I.E.L.D. employees? Actually, that could turn out to be pretty funny.</p>

            <p>Is it a Fanfiction University for the whole Marvel universe, or just the portions of it involving the Avengers team? And if it&#39;s the latter, is it only the movieverse, or the movie and the television show, or the movie, television show, and comics? What exactly are the parameters for it?<br><br>Regarding your question about minis, I suppose the level of supervision each mini needs would depend on the character it was based on, as well as its mini type. No mini-Discord is ever going to be well-behaved, because it&#39;s a mini of a primordial chaos spirit. Other minis of more neutral or balanced species might have a varying amount of adherence to rules, based on their experiences and how their namesake might act.<br><br>I say it would probably be safest to supervise any minis, especially potential problem minis, than to leave them unsupervised and risk them hacking something or breaking important items.

            <p>So far, it looks like this OFU is just going to be about the movies, with the characters from other versions of the continua making appearances frequently. We also plan to have a  bunch of characters from various fandoms appear as guests, such as Gabriel from Supernatural and Captain Jack Harkness. EMH Clint is going to be one of the frequent guests, but we are drawing our staff purely from the Avengers movie and the movies that led up to it.<br><br>Also: XD Good pooooooint.

            <p>I&#39;ll be rolling out the minis from OFUDisc itself as they appear in the story (otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be fair).

            <p>Members of the PPC, honored guests, random passers-by,<br><br>I bring you a legend today.  A piece of fanfiction so beloved by its readers that the mention of its name makes some readers choke up.  One that leaves me crying tears of joy every time I read it.  Before I link it - or rather, <i>them</i> - I would like to take a moment to preface them, to give you some perspective as to what makes these pieces so outstanding.<br><br>---<br><br><i>&quot;Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim darkness of the far future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.&quot;</i><br><br>In this most grim of times, this most dark of hours, there are many sacrifices made.  Sacrifices of men and machines, of entire planets at times, for the good of the Imperium of Man.  All of them tragic, but none so poignant as the tragedy that befell - and continues to befall - the inhabitants of a planet known as Krieg.<br><br>Millennia ago, Krieg was simply another world among millions, its inhabitants serving the Emperor no more and no less than their fellows across the Imperium.  Disaster struck, in the form of an uprising that left Krieg wracked with civil war for five hundred years.  It ended, finally, when a Loyalist Colonel gained control of Krieg&#39;s nuclear stockpile, and laid waste to the entire planet in a storm of atomic fire.  The loyalists were victorious, but at the cost of their very home.  Krieg emerged a barren, irradiated wasteland, covered with great clouds of ash that left it in perpetual nuclear winter.<br><br>In the 41st Millennium, the soldiers of Krieg are the hardest, toughest men of the Imperial Guard.  They know no fear, they are loathe to retreat even a single inch.  They have one goal, and one goal only:  to die fighting the enemies of the Emperor in penance for their ancestors&#39; betrayal.  Kriegers have been known to actually <i>execute their own <b>Commissars</b> for cowardice.</i><br><br>They are broken human beings, bred in the vast cloning facilities of Krieg and raised from infancy to be soldiers in the most brutal, unforgiving, iron-disciplined army in a galaxy of total war.  They almost never remove their gas masks, at they wish always to be prepared for enemy assault.  They do not have battlefield medics, as treating those too badly wounded to fight is inefficient - they have Quartermasters, whose duty is to strip the dead and crippled of their gear (to be redistributed amongst the healthy) and booby-trap the bodies, that they might perform one final service for the Emperor.<br><br>There isn&#39;t much to like about the Krieg.  They are the ultimate faceless mooks - no personality, no face, not even a name.  Every gas-mask-wearing, Lasgun-toting figure has a serial number, nothing more.  They are weapons of war, not human beings.<br><br>---<br><br>Into that setting, within that army, came the most noblebright fic ever written about Warhammer 40,000.  A story of misunderstandings, of confusion, and of growing love.  A story of hope for the most hopeless humans ever born.  A story of a chance for redemption for a planet with an unpayable debt.  <br><br>A story...of Love and Krieg.<br><br><br>---<br><br>Part the First, in which a Krieger falls in love:  <a href="http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Love_and_Krieg"><a href="http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Love_and_Krieg">http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Love_and_Krieg</a></a><br><br>Part the Second <i>(Still in progress, thank the Emperor!)</i>, in which Kriegers find their peace:  <a href="http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Love_and_Krieg_Spinoffs"><a href="http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Love_and_Krieg_Spinoffs">http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Love_and_Krieg_Spinoffs</a></a><br><br><i>Please note:  I am <u>not</u> linking from 4chan, but from /tg/&#39;s wiki.</i><br><br>---<br><br>Happy reading, and remember:  <br><br>Terranis holds.</p>

            <p>Okay, now that I&#39;ve got your attention.<br><br>Just a person who&#39;s been browsing through the mission reports lately here. Just thought there would be something I&#39;d like to share.<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure that the PPC isn&#39;t the only thing that tries to protect the continuum of canon. And I know in the process you all have to also watch out for each other - in the sense that you do not become one of &#39;them&#39; as well.<br><br>So here&#39;s the challenge: How would you deal with others that have &#39;defected&#39; to the Sue side without knowing it? (As in, Sue-hunters who have turned into Sues themselves.)<br><br>For the mission report - Here&#39;s a fic. (Link is to a DA page, said fic is in the download pdf.)<br><br><a href="http://angelglitched.deviantart.com/art/quot-Insert-Novel-Name-Here-quot-NaNoWriMo-2011-271526569"><a href="http://angelglitched.deviantart.com/art/quot-Insert-Novel-Name-Here-quot-NaNoWriMo-2011-271526569">http://angelglitched.deviantart.com/art/quot-Insert-Novel-Name-Here-quot-NaNoWriMo-2011-271526569</a></a><br><br>You could claim and try it. Open to any agents, as long as you&#39;re in a good condition for normal missions. Be warned, though. Said fic spans across multiple canons (Sue canons included, oh my god), and because of the presence of &#39;already dead in the PPC canon&#39; characters, repeat Sues can be treated as &#39;fake!Sues&#39; or clones of the original Sue, whichever you prefer.<br><br>Multiple teams are allowed, given the scale of the operation.<br><br>I hope that made sense, and good luck.</p>

            <p>Hey, thanks for popping in! Glad to have you around. Fell free to go on ahead and introduce yourself on our <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/Indices/199610.html">main board </a> and join the discussions over there!<br><br>As to your mission proposal, the link doesn&#39;t lead to any sort of PDF. Is it available elsewhere? Is this a writing prompt or just a simple question? If it is the latter, Huinesoron used to have the Department of Internal Operations chase after Sued Agents. They never really did any sorties that we know of, so I guess that&#39;s kinda why it&#39;s been quietly disbanded. <br><br>We usually don&#39;t interfere with other Sue-hunting organisations, so I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever sporked those kinds of stories (though admittedly, I&#39;ve read an ACMSES story that had me scratching my head for a minute).</p>

            <p>High fantasy, high fantasy, low fantasy, high fantasy, rabbits ...<br><br>Tad Williams is brilliant, he does some sci fi as well, though its sort of mixed in. Like the War of the Flowers which has fairies living in skyscrapers.<br><br>Joe Abercombie is a good author if you like the realism mixed with fantasy of things like A Song of Ice and Fire (which I also highly recommend).<br><br>James Barclay is a mixed bag, some stuff is good, but he&#39;s also one of the few authors who I&#39;ve had to give up on a book by due to annoyance at pacing and plot.<br><br>Trudi Canavan is always good, plus it works for any age from teen up.<br><br>Neil Gaiman is of course a wonderful writer, I particularly suggest American Gods.<br><br>J. V. Jones isn&#39;t that well know, but I like her stuff for the political and action elements.<br><br>Katherine Kerr writes epic, not quite Celtic, stuff. It takes a bit of time to get all the reincarnations straight and there&#39;s about a million really fat books, but I love it.<br><br>Jasper Fforde mixes a love of books with a great sense of humour, as well as being an awesome guy to fans. (or at least from the couple of times he&#39;s dome signings near where I live.)<br><br>Steven Erikson writes well, as long as you don&#39;t mind having a billion and two characters and settings to figure out and that&#39;s before the reincarnation really sets in.<br><br>Jim Butcher&#39;s Dresden Files is a good example of supernatural elements in a World One like setting. I can&#39;t speak for any of his other works.<br><br>Hope this is helpful MAX.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll echo those before me who recommended Tolkien, Douglas Adam&#39;s Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy trilogy, Discworld, Neil Gaiman, Hunger Games, Philip Pullman&#39;s His Dark Materials Trilogy, Artemis Fowl, Chronicles of Narnia, The Giver, Lemony Snicket&#39;s A Series of Unfortunate Events, Michael Crichton (especially Jurassic Park and the Lost World), The Dresden Files and the Inkheart trilogy by Cornelia Funke.<br><br>I would also go on to suggest The Thief Lord also by Cornelia Funke. I would say The Princess Bride is a fun read, probably even more so for fans of the movie. If you&#39;re into dinosaurs my favorite book is Raptor Red by Robert T. Bakker. It&#39;s a look at the prehistoric world through the eyes of a Utahraptor. If you&#39;re looking for fantasy Angie Sage&#39;s Magyk/Septimus Heap series is a good read as well as the Enchanted Forest Chronicles by Patricia C. Wrede, the Fablehaven series by Brandon Mull, The Stolen Child by Keith Donohue which is about changelings, and is written from both perspectives (the changeling and the changed for child) and if you don&#39;t shy away from Christian themes the Dragons in our Midst, Oracles of Fire and Children of the Bard series by Bryan Davis are very good. <br><br>Frank Peretti is also a very good Christian author, I particularly enjoy The Oath and the pair This Present Darkness and Piercing the Darkness. Angela Elwell Hunt has several very good semi-romance historical fiction series, also written from a Christian perspective. Her Heirs of Cahira O’Connor series follows an Irish family through several hundred years of history highlighting females who have broken traditional roles, the first book is set in the 1400&#39;s and is about a female knight, the second in the 1600&#39;s and follows a female artist aboard a ship, the third is set in the Civil War and the fourth switches between modern day and during the Norman invasion of Ireland. She also wrote a series about the early days of the colonies starting with Roanoke. And a trilogy about Joseph&#39;s dreams and his time in Egypt, as well as a book about the women in Moses&#39; life (his Egyptian mother, his sister and his wife) that was really interesting.<br><br>I also enjoyed Dan Brown&#39;s books about the Da Vinci/church conspiracies I guess you&#39;d call it, and his other two stand alone books, Digital Fortress and Deception Point, I&#39;ve not had the chance to read The Lost Symbol or Inferno by him yet though. Tamar Myers is another good author if you like murder mysteries. She has two series, one set in Amish country Pennsylvania at a bed and breakfast and the other in Charleston South Carolina at an antique shop, which amuse me vastly because all the titles are puns. Also you get some good/fun recipes from her Penn Dutch series! I doubt you&#39;d call it superb literature, however another one I read recently, Carpe Demon, about a suburban mom demon hunter did really well with plot twists. I had it figured out several times, and the author kept throwing me for a loop. It was kind of a pleasant change to being able to figure the thing out. XD<br><br>Anyway, hope I didn&#39;t add to badly to the overwhemance of literature suggestions. :)</p>

            <p>If you&#39;re looking for something that&#39;s paced particularly well for good writing examples, &#39;Great Gatsby&#39; and &#39;Fahrenheit 451&#39; are really great in my opinion. <br>Not sure if you&#39;ll enjoy them, though. The writing&#39;s great, but &#39;Great Gatsby&#39; is basically &#39;Desperate Housewives&#39; from the 1920&#39;s and Fahrenheit is confusing as ----. <br>Books that are truly classics in my mind? &#39;The Giver&#39; (or any book in that series) and &#39;Marley and Me&#39;. I&#39;ve read both at least ten times and every time they make me cry. They are beautiful pieces of writing, greatly paced, and they are so thought provoking. Especially if you have a pet. <br>Are you on goodreads? If you join a book group on there, they might have some pretty good recommendations, too. Or even looking at lists or what friends are reading.</p>

            <p>Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy, LOTR, Discworld, His Dark Materials... trying to think of something that hasn&#39;t been mentioned already... Kate DiCamillo&#39;s stuff is good. As is the Graceling trilogy, which deserves to be known far better than it is. A Wrinkle in Time (really anything by Madeleine L&#39;Engle) is also a must-read.<br>I second Rick Riordan&#39;s books and the Hunger Games, although the second and third weren&#39;t really my cup of tea. Neil Gaiman is great (I loved The Graveyard Book), Tamora Pierce.. and John Green. Everything by John Green. Gorgeous stuff. <br>I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;d call the Dragonriders of Pern series great in terms of writing, but it&#39;s complex and interesting and makes for a good read. The writing in Redwall is not always great, and it abounds with Canon Sues, but I seem to have an absurd fondness for it anyway. Maybe it&#39;s just because I like cute fluffy animals.</p>

            <p>Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy, LOTR, Series of Unfortunate Events, and His Dark Materials (I need to reread these...). I also recommend the Hunger Games, and any of Rick Riordan&#39;s mythology based books: Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Heroes of Olympus, and the Kane Chronicles. The first two are connected, and you have to read Percy Jackson first. Those are Greek and Roman mythology while Kane Chronicles is Egyptian. Both are hysterical. Also, the 39 Clues and spinoff Cahills vs. Vespers. Not sure how to describe it, but very good. All of these are YA, but that certainly doesn&#39;t mean that they are low quality or not entertaining, as evidenced by my next recommendation - the Oz books. Yes, they are children&#39;s books, but they are so fun and well-written. Not great for continuity, though. </p>

            <p>I read way too much, so forgive me if the list gets out of hand.<br>For just plain wonderful writing, I&#39;d suggest anything by Holly Black (I love Holly Black. I love her so much I am going to cry) and certain books by Jerry Spinelli. The Young Wizards series by Diane Duane is also simply amazing (and mixes in Biblical symbolism without going over-the-top, if you&#39;re into that kind of thing). Then there&#39;s the Uglies series by Scott Westerfield, the His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman, anything by Neil Gaiman (I particularly enjoyed American Gods, but that might just be because I have a huge soft spot for mythology in general), and every single thing John Green has ever written. Also, Holes by Louis Sachar is a really great book that you should definitely read, no matter what. Oh, and I&#39;d also suggest A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket (the dark comedy in this series is astoundingly amazing), most books by Tamora Pierce, and Flora Segunda by Ysabeu S. Wilce (not quite as made of pure amazingness as the other ones on this list, but it definitely needs more recognition in the world). Also, I know you didn&#39;t ask for comics, but even so I&#39;d suggest Castle Waiting by Linda Medley. The plot is clever and fun, and it reads more like a fairy tale which just happens to be in comic format, rather than a pure comic.<br>Oh, and I&#39;d also suggest that you check out The Order of Odd-Fish by James Kennedy! The tone of it reminds me quite a bit of the PPC...</p>

            <p>As has been said, LotR, Discworld and Neil Gaiman stuff, definitely. I&#39;d also recommend the Recluce series and the Spellsong Cycle, both by L.E. Modesitt jr, for good magic systems. (Manipulating the &quot;order&quot; and &quot;chaos&quot; that make up everything in the former, and song-magic in the latter, with plausible-sounding explanations how it works.)</p>

            <p>If you want to learn how to write good descriptions, symbolism, and foreshadowing (as well as simply beautiful prose), read anything by Thomas Hardy. Far from the Madding Crowd is a good one to start with. So is Tess of the d&#39;Urbervilles, but it will break your heart.<br>Not the same kind of thing as everyone else is recommending, or anything that has a &quot;fandom,&quot; exactly, but I promise it will help your writing.</p>

            <p>Seconding all the standard PPCer fare: LotR, Discworld, Neil Gaiman, etc. Also the Pern books, though looking at them now I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d hold Anne McCaffrey&#39;s writing up as really great; for world-building, though, she indisputably rocks.<br><br>To throw in some new names, I recommend anything by Greg Bear for science fiction, Charles de Lint for urban fantasy, and Sherri S. Tepper for... uh... I guess science fiction is the closest? Mostly sci-fi, with elements of fantasy/the supernatural, religious myth, and feminism/gender issues in various degrees depending on the book.

            <p>Discworld - all of the Discworld. Along with the Dresden Files recommendations, I&#39;d add Codex Alera, also by Jim Butcher. Anything by Neil Gaiman is good, but I especially recommend his short stories (Fragile Things in particular).

            <p>Well, Lord of the Rings, if you haven&#39;t already read that, definitely throw in some Phantastes (George MacDonald), Jurassic Park (some discretion might be advised depending on your age)- and to mention some of my personal favorites (I find them well written, but I may be prejudiced) anything by Lois Lowry, especially &#39;Autumn Street&#39;, Artemis Fowl, The Keys  To the Kingdom (Garth Nix), anything by Garth Nix, and for those wonderful explanations of scientifically impossible things, Michael Crichton (discretion, again).

            <p>Hello there! Another newbie introducing herself, here. You can call me Vanya, or cake, or really anything you&#39;d like, I don&#39;t mind. I believe I used to bum around the board a couple of years ago, but I can&#39;t quite remember because I am a dumb butt.<br>Anyway, I am a fourteen-year-old human of the female persuasion (well, I&#39;m very nearly fifteen, but I suppose we&#39;ll go with the technicalities for now). I am in nearly too many fandoms to name, but currently my major ones are Homestuck, Supernatural, Doctor Who, and some miscellaneous minor ones. I have extensive knowledge of several canons which I do not actively participate in the fandoms of (i.e. MLP:FiM, Ava&#39;s Demon, Sherlock, Gunnerkrigg Court, Harry Potter, probably a few others that I can&#39;t remember right now).<br>If you guys want to see my fanfiction, I&#39;m exterminatecake on most websites (my ff.net account is super out-of-date, though; I&#39;m much better now!). I have a tendency to post without proofreading, though, so keep that in mind if you care to try and slog through my heavy-handed prose and overused adjectives. I&#39;m not particularly interested in writing missions right now, but that&#39;s mostly due to time constraints. Currently I would just love to be a part of what seems like a wonderful community!<br>Other than write, I also edit fanvids frequently and draw a bit. Other hobbies include collecting snowglobes, reading obsessively, crying over television shows, and doing various fashion-y things. <br>I didn&#39;t mean for this to become an entire essay, sorry! I get carried away sometimes...<br>quietly slips back into lurkdom</p>

Assuming you haven&#39;t seen it already, take a look at the PPC Wiki. Most of the history&#39;s there, along with all the fiction and other stuff you might want to read.<br>Don&#39;t worry about the length - check out my introduction if you want to see how long these things can get. On second thought, don&#39;t. It will most likely bore you. <br>As for your newbie gift, have this toaster! It&#39;s available in the Sue color of your choice and fires pastries at high velocity! Also, have a supersize bottle of Bleeprin. You&#39;ll most likely need it during your tenure here.</p>

            <p>Aw, yes, another Homestuck fan! H1GH F1V3! And don&#39;t worry about the length, some newbies put a lot more than that on their first posts. Making long posts is perfectly fine and acceptable here. I know I do it.<br>Now, let me try and find a newbie gift for you... let&#39;s see... ah! Have a transforming lipstick-chainsaw! Kanaya&#39;s formerly-signature weapon provides wanton destruction in a small and easy-to-transport package! It would probably be extra-effective at decapitating the typical Mary Sue, given their vanity, slow-wittedness, and love of makeup! Just make sure to clean it every once in a while if you do that, or all of the glittery blood will ruin the color.</p>

            <p>Have you read the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">Constitution</a> and the <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/">Original Series</a>? Also, have some Bleep&#39;n&#39;ms (helps combat Badfic effects) and an Unspecified Plushie (turns into your favorite character) as welcome gifts! I&#39;m sorry to say I don&#39;t share in your current major fandoms, but there are several people here who will. Glad to have you anyway :-) Just one question, though: why would you exterminate cake? Cake is awesome! ^.^</p>

            <p>Yes, I have indeed read the Constitution! As for the Original Series... well, I&#39;m working on it. I&#39;m not a huge fan of LoTR (don&#39;t get me wrong, I admire it as a wonderful work of literature, it&#39;s just not really my thing right now), so I keep putting it off, which is really dumb of me, I know.<br>I would never actually exterminate cake.

            <p>In a Fanfiction University, OOC has plenty of precedent if it&#39;s for Rule of Funny. Otherwise, Sauron wouldn&#39;t keep a stuffed rabbit and throw meteors at Morgoth!<br>I thought that Miss Gloria and Miss Maria were in charge of OFAS... is something that I was going to say before I remembered that when dealing with a Q, it&#39;ll just be safer to humor him than to provide direct opposition.

            <p>For anime, I would first like to recommend Princess Resurrection. The manga is much longer, has some differences, and is generally more entertaining, but I don&#39;t know your preferences there. I&#39;d also like to recommend Sekirei, Highschool of the Dead, and Fairy Tail (also Rave Master, by the same mangaka as Fairy Tail, it&#39;s amazing).<br><br>For book series, I would recommend Dresden Files, Song of Ice and Fire, anything by Mercedes Lackey or Tamora Pierce (keep in mind, most of my recommendations are fantasy.

            <p>Wait, was that you in the PDF? Was it a fanfiction about people who use anime-style screennames, or were there actual anime characters? Both? I am confused, mainly because the ratio of anime that exists compared to anime that I have watched is very low. Either way, you&#39;re more than welcome to link to the Challenge on the other Board somewhere in this topic. That way, people can be redirected to it, and you don&#39;t have to make duplicate topics. You should probably explain what the challenge entails, though, for the benefit of people like me who had no idea what was going onin that story.<br>I&#39;m going to be the one who posts the <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2013/ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Constitution">link to the PPC Constitution</a>, which is tradition when welcoming newbies. Since it&#39;s on the PPC wiki, you can read some missions while you&#39;re there! Though, if you have been around for over a year, you&#39;ve probably at least read the Original Series already.<br>Part Two of newbie-welcoming tradition! Gifts! Take a scaled-down kaiju! All of the fun of owning your very own city-destroying monster, but without the high food costs and with a significantly smaller risk of destroying your house!<br>Part Three is puns, usually puns based on the words &quot;new&quot; and &quot;Board&quot;, but I&#39;m very bad at those, so it&#39;ll be better if I allow those more gifted in wordplay to cover that.</p>

            <p>I feel like it&#39;s been a while since I last <s>ranted</s> posted about this. I mainly feel this way because I notice that many of you are not paying attention to the treatment of titles in your wiki edits. So, a brief refresher course about how titles are set off from other text:<br><br>Titles of <b>long works</b>, such as novels, feature films, video games/game franchises, and TV series, are <i>italicized</i>. On the wiki, you do this with two pairs of single-quotes, like so: &#39;&#39;Title Goes Here&#39;&#39;. Note that these are not the same as &quot;double-quotes.&quot;<br><br>Note that titles of book series are sometimes italicized, sometimes not. It seems to depend on whether it&#39;s considered an official title for the whole series or just a handy nickname for it, but I couldn&#39;t say how to tell the difference just by looking. I usually look it up on Wikipedia if I&#39;m not sure.<br><br>Titles of <b>short works</b>, such as individual TV episodes, PPC missions, and most fanfics, are set off by pairs of either &#39;single-&#39; or &quot;double-quotes,&quot; depending on your brand of English usage. On the wiki, you do this the same way you do everywhere else.<br><br>So, now you know. {= D Please pay attention to this. It will make my life easier, because I <i>will</i> come in and clean up after you if I must.<br><br>Please let me know if you have any questions about this. We can talk about how titles are capitalized, too, if anyone wants to, but for now I&#39;ll just point out that forms of the verb &quot;to be&quot; are always capitalized, even if they&#39;re short, and &quot;is&quot; is a form of &quot;to be.&quot;<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Meaning I have exactly two questions.<br><br>1.) What is the PPC&#39;s stance on role-playing games, and gear from role-playing games? I&#39;ve been reading some webcomics with very blatant DnD bases lately, and wondered if any of the things from RPG games could possibly be in the possession of an Agent? Going off of that, what&#39;s the PPC&#39;s position on sporking badfics taken from RPGs? I recall reading Drizzt do&#39;Urden was a canon Sue, and his universe is based on DnD, so I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s some sort of guideline there?<br><br>2.) The Steampunk AU version of the PPC, the one on Twisted Skein. I read through it all recently and am very interested. Where might I learn more about it?</p>

            <p>I have a character who is from the Shadowrun universe, and brought all of his gear into the PPC with him (Most of which, aside from maybe the armored jacket and the rather obvious cybernetic arm, will likely never see real use, especially not in a mission), as well as knowledge of his particular version of the future.<br><br>For those not aware, Shadowrun is basically Earth, roughly 60 years in the future, and with corporations ruling almost everything. Well, plus magic. So, for example, for him something like Harry Potter is classic children&#39;s fantasy, much the way the Chronicles of Narnia are for us. His knowledge of videogames is largely incorrect, because most of today&#39;s games are either part of history which no one really touches outside of maybe a &quot;history of gaming&quot; class at some university, or they&#39;re part of a series that&#39;s still ongoing, like say Zelda or Sonic, but most of the canon he knows for those is stuff that hasn&#39;t happened yet, and may never happen. Legend of Zelda: Lamentations of the Flame Princess may never happen, for example. (In fact, I&#39;d be surprised if it did, since that&#39;s currently the title of a D&amp;D adventure module, minus the &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; bit.) He knows a lot about film history and &quot;classic&quot; comics, but he thinks about movie and comics from today much like we would think of stuff from the 60s.<br><br>As for fics based on RPGs, almost any RPG will have canon characters. Games popular enough, like D&amp;D and Shadowrun and World of Darkness, tend to also have novels based on the game settings, which give you an idea of what the canon characters are like. Even if there are no canon characters in the story, if you know the world well enough, you should still be able to spot traits that are Sueish, or non-canonical. Elves in Shadowrun? Sure! Immortal Elves in Shadowrun? I&#39;m side-eyeing you pretty hard unless they&#39;re an established canon character. Elves of any stripe in World of Darkness? No sir, not on my watch. Similarly, demons in D&amp;D or World of Darkness? Sure! Real demons in Shadowrun? Uh, no, not likely. Guns in Shadowrun or World of Darkness? Absolutely, it&#39;d be odd not to see guns in fact. Guns in D&amp;D? It better be like a blunderbuss, and even then they&#39;re extremely rare.</p>

            <p>We have at least one PPC Agent from a D&amp;D-verse - the same as Drizzt Do&#39;Urden, in fact, the Forgotten Realms. He is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mazarun_Zothyrr">Mazarun Zothyrr</a>, a drow from Menzoberranzan and quite possibly a contemporary of Drizzt. He belongs to Rilwen Shadowflame (the Boarder, not the Agent). He&#39;s not overpowered by any stretch of the imagination; he&#39;s partly trained as a wizard, but mostly a fighter, so he&#39;s limited to spells like Ray of Clumsiness and Endure Elements - nothing remotely superpowerful, but enough to give the edge in a fight. It certainly hasn&#39;t left him blasting through missions so easily they&#39;ve become boring.<br><br>Regarding gear from RPGs, I&#39;m pretty sure more than one Agent has got themselves some Bags of Holding, to carry loot if nothing else. I&#39;d figure that as long as it&#39;s not an easy &quot;I win&quot; button, any gear&#39;s fine.<br><br>And sporking badfics... it sort of depends how well you know the RPG in question. If it allows for crazy feats of endurance/combat/magic etc., you can&#39;t really use those as a reason to spork. You&#39;d have to go more on whether or not the fics are keeping people in character. For example, say it&#39;s a fic about Drizzt set during the earlier books, where his surfacer friends are alive. You could have Drizzt being the extremely talented and superpowered (and Sue-y) warrior he is, but if he&#39;s getting fluffywuffy with an OC and not even stopping to think about Catti-brie, or otherwise angsting about the evils of sex (legitimately, given one of his early sights of it was a ten-foot-tall demon and a drow priestess getting funky in the middle of an orgy) then he&#39;s Out Of Character and the canon needs resetting at once.<br><br>And I&#39;ve given you way more info than you probably needed. ^^;; My fingers run away with me when I get to talk about D&amp;D. Hope this helps though!</p>

            <p>Agent Unger is from a D&amp;D-based continuum.<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve seen minor magic items, like the Bag of Holding, floating around HQ as well. Some D&amp;D items and spells may be quite interesting if added to a mission.<br><br>One caution, though: D&amp;D quickly becomes a very high-powered universe--Drizzt, for example, is not even a particularly powerful character if he&#39;s statted up, and everything he does in even the flashiest battle scenes is totally possible for a D&amp;D character of mid-level.<br><br>So, despite the allure of being able to put up a Prismatic Wall or decapitate a Sue with a +2 Vorpal weapon, it is probably best to stick to minor items and low-level magic, the sort which adds story possibilities and strategic options instead of sheer power. A simple &quot;Grease&quot; spell or a Hand of the Mage would be interesting things for agents to have, and a Hat of Disguise would be a good makeshift replacement for some functions of the DORKS.<br><br>Most role-playing games have some sort of canon which can spark badfic and deserve protection.<br><br>As far as I&#39;m concerned, I think it&#39;d be cool to see some more D&amp;D stuff in the PPC.

            <p>Woot! Someone remembers him! *Does happy dance*<br><br>Origins of Unger:<br><br>He specifically is a half-elf barbarian, purely for the ridiculousness of that. When he arrived, he couldn&#39;t read, and it took him a long time to learn. He is also afraid of the &quot;magical&quot; drain hole in showers and baths. He owns a Quiver of Ehlonna which holds javelins. He comes from a tribe of half-elves in the far, cold north, and he was on a sort of walkabout to prove his manhood. In his infinite (about 6, I can&#39;t remember his exact stats now) Wisdom, he decided to attack a camp full of bugbears and goblins all by himself, which went about as well as can be expected. He fell through a plot hole /just/ before they tried to eat him. He landed on a table in the Cafeteria, and spent a short stint in FicPsych acclimating (being tamed). During which time he tried to set fire to something 62 times. (How I came up with him as a character is that I was playing around with Hero Machine 3, and made this picture, which I liked a lot and decided to to come up with a name and background for. We were playing family DnD sessions at the time, so I rolled him up as a level 3 or 4 character--to keep him from being too powerful. He is also 21, which is at or near the minimum age for half-elves, so figured it was equivalent to about 15 for humans. Then we never used him in the game, so I moved him off to the PPC)<br><br><br>Agent Miah also has a backpack of holding, which she is extremely vague on the origins of, but she was rescued from a semi-fic blip and then worked as an Internet Avatar for several years before getting a job with the PPC.</p>

            <p>Recruitment options:<br>--Character comes from an unpublished fic or role-playing game, and is sent to HQ by the author. The character usually doesn&#39;t know this and it&#39;s just a plot hole. A semi-fic blip is a character from an unpublished fic.<br>--Recruited from badfic. Sometimes there are salvageable characters in badfic, including bad RP. If they&#39;ve got enough of a personality, you can recruit.<br>--A former fanbrat from an OFU. I&#39;m not aware of a D&amp;D-based OFU, but there could be one.<br>--Dropped through a plothole or wandered through a door from World One (or even specifically hired for the job via a Want ad).<br>--A professor transferred from an OFU.<br>--A teenager who grew up in the Nursery.<br>--Very occasionally, rescued from goodfic after death. Agent Stormsong was rescued this way, just before death, with a Simulation Generator used to create the corpse to keep the fic intact. Characters from goodfic can have problems relating to their experiences in the fic--a sort of PTSD that gives them &quot;flashbacks&quot; to what should have happened. FicPsych can help, but there&#39;s no cure.<br><br>So there are a lot of options. If you have an RP character you want to use, and they&#39;re not too powerful to be an agent, they could certainly become one.<br><br>Though--for very powerful but non-Sue characters, there is the option of ESAS, which is the department that handles high-power-level continua. If you have to take care of a Sue or slashwraith in a continuum that&#39;s populated by gods, superheroes, giant robots, or the like, ESAS is the department that takes that on. Though it can be quite comical to see a team of regular agents try to figure out how to deal with a fic where they&#39;re in way over their head, power-wise. ESAS does have the drawback of being actually limited to high-powered fics, unless you can write an interesting story with high-powered agents in a low-powered world. Could be done, I guess. Danger of glitter, though.</p>

            <p>Since the usual method for introducing an agent is &quot;they fell through a plothole&quot;, this could be an interesting new spin on the finding-HQ scenario.<br>So far as I know, nobody&#39;s caused entry into HQ through death, probably because doing so would just spawn a problem for Medical.<br>Ooh, idea! There&#39;s a high-level psionic ability that can resurrect anyone the user knows, even if their original body was destroyed (I forget what it was called). If the user was distracted, maybe the botched power could reconstitute the body, but fail to bring it to the location of the caster, and the confused space-time matrix would dump it in a null zone, i.e. HQ. The DnD native would be confused, out of both his home dimension and time period, and potentially psychotic from the transit. A perfect recruit.<br>Just an idea. I don&#39;t know if it could stand up to scrutiny,  but I thought it made sense, by DnD logic at least.</p>

            <p>One thing that rather intrigues me with this is that, in my meager experience with DnD, the characters are the sum of their players&#39; desires and roleplaying.

            <p>A character is defined by their surroundings and experiences, and since PCs, especially poorly role-played PCs, are essentially puppets for the players the way that bits are puppets for Sues or plot advancements, they&#39;d experience a psychological crisis rooted in the same cause: they need to develop a personality as an individual.<br><br>If the character was too meta during their quest, or if their player was too heavy on the pop culture references, the character would have a mix of World One knowledge with the knowledge of their home world and canon, and likewise, if the player was really heavily into the role-playing aspect but didn&#39;t do it properly, the character would be stunted psychologically, with knowledge of their home canon but with little ability to operate outside it. If they entered the PPC, they&#39;d both need a stay with the Psychs, the first guy to develop a stable identity, and the second to be able to develop his ability to make new mental connections and operate in new scenarios that have nothing to do with shouting catch-phrases and waiting for his Daily abilities to recharge. Both would also need mental training to allow for more independent thought.<br><br>Nue Houjuu&#39;s mention of the Great Dice in another comment made me think about something else: DnD characters are essentially operated by dice rolls, game mechanics, and feats, and the particularly meta players even treat their characters as having knowledge of these functions, but how would those functions adjust into the PPC continuum? Since it&#39;s based on real-styled physics for much of the time, most of the probability manipulation that a DnD character requires is either nullified by default or brought into question. What would a sword with, for example, a +2 to hit do in real-world physics? How would saving throws work? Would a PC&#39;s ability to resist magic or poison become completely random as he was cut off from the dice that formerly powered his entire existence? Outside the original continuum, these become relevant questions. If he always succeeds at the dice rolls, he becomes a Suvian, if he always fails, he dies quickly, and if the results are random, he&#39;d have no idea what to expect in a given situation, and would have to formulate plans and life choices as if he had no abilities at all, because he&#39;d never know if they&#39;d actually work.<br><br>These are actually pretty interesting problems. Maybe a DnD-based character would come up with these questions on his own as he&#39;s learning to think for himself, and prompt a change in the formerly-arrogant persona of 97% of DnD characters as he decides how he&#39;s going to deal with the uncertainties. Will he find out for himself? Will he play it safe and try to operate as a standard humanoid? Will he take risks and bank on his powers working when they need to? Maybe not even he&#39;d know at the start.</p>

            <p>Being a Pokemon fan, I want to raise this question to any other Pokemaniac PPCers: What is your opinion on Ash? To be more precise, I think that Ash is borderline Stu. I recently saw today&#39;s episode of the anime, and the plot contrivances that have gone on in the series are baffling. (Obviously, if you have not kept up woth the series, <b>SPOILERS AHEAD!</b>)<br><br>*In Ash&#39;s first battle in the Unova League (Ash vs. Trip), it seems all but certain that Pikachu was going to lose. Then Ash magically pulls a victory out of nowhere!<br><br>*In today&#39;s episode (Ash vs. Stephan), during the first match, Krookodile manages to survive despite having been hit quite a few times by that Liepard. Unless I am mistaken, a match like that would have been a draw in any other anime (though with the antagonist falling first, of course).<br><br>And let&#39;s not forget that in general, Ash gets through the series with unevolved Pokйmon, and using strategies that any battler would laugh at! And he still manages to beat every Gym Leader and at least make it at least few rounds into the regional league!<br><br>So what do you think? Is Ash just a horrible trainer with strings of dumb luck, or is he a Canon Stu?</p>

            <p>So, from what I&#39;ve been reading so far, it seems that I&#39;m not the only one to think that Ash has some Stuish tendencies, with the main argument otherwise is that this is a kids&#39; show and the protagonist must never fail.<br><br>With the Unova region, I did notice somewhat of an improvement in the series: Team Rocket finally looked like the evil organization that they were originally supposed to be (as opposed to the bumbling buffoons that we were treated to on a daily basis in Sinnoh), and there was more of a subplot as opposed to &quot;Ash solves the Problem of the Week&quot; every episode. If the creators could just figure out how to make compelling battles without Stuifying Ash and his Pokemon, then the problem of going over children&#39;s heads would not be much of a problem. However, I must admit that with all the plot contrivances that have been invoked over the years, it looks like Ash is a borderline Canon Stu.</p>

            <p>Back when I actually watched the show, I thought he was learning and had a bit of luck toward the beginning. I saw his complete and utter disregard for what was coming out of his mouth as his flaw. Plus, Pikiachu would be at a fairly high level right now....as long as Ash wasn&#39;t battling a ground, would it matter? I can&#39;t remember...<br>Maybe he&#39;s a Stu, but I see it as more of a trying to keep kids interested thing. What I notice is as soon as his companions change (besides Brock), his entire character development is wiped and he goes back to being ignorant, yet still winning matches because technically those things still happened and he still has high level pokemon. <br>So, erm....I guess the short answer is I don&#39;t know.</p>

            <p>It got progressively worse after the first two seasons, which were decent. For those, you could pretend that it was just dumb luck. But after that, it got pretty ridiculous. He seems incapable of failing, which is obviously a pretty generic Stu trait.<br>On the other hand, this is technically a children&#39;s show, and kids are not going to be interested in a protagonist who loses all the time. I have a personal belief that this is also the reason why they continue to change his companions after every few seasons.<br>It&#39;s odd, because every few seasons (usually when his companions change) his character development goes back to the very beginning of the series and then starts over, but he continues to win matches due to his high-level Pokйmon.<br>As a side note, the first three or four victories he won were just pity victories, which is not as implausible as a beginning trainer.<br>So in the end, yes, he is borderline Stu, but not totally Stu. At least, not yet.</p>

            <p>Season one was okay, season two, eh, worked too. But it just went downhill. And I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other ways to keep kids interested. Like having him, finally, win a damn league and getting him out of the show. Like the games did.</p>

            <p>I stopped following Pokйmon a while ago, mostly because the show just got eh. He&#39;s not a good trainer, and friendship can only get you that far. And yet, despite that, he&#39;s shown as the awesome problem-solver of all. I&#39;m trying to think of an episode where it wasn&#39;t him who solved the problem of the week, but I can&#39;t.<br><br>And to Nue Houjuu: Just because it&#39;s a kids show, that doesn&#39;t mean that he should be the way he is. I&#39;m not saying that the show should adhere strictly to the game mechanics, though, since they&#39;re just that: gameplay. I still wish he was a more balanced protagonist.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s typical in a kid&#39;s show for the protagonist to be able to solve a wide variety of problems, but Ash is pathologically incapable of failing, even when a problem falls completely outside the range of what he could conceivably do. If he encounters a problem that determination, friendship, and deus ex machina can&#39;t get him through, the writers try to cover up that there was ever a problem. This is particularly bad since he, due to writing laziness and Aura of Smooth, is able to cure the psychological problems of every single Pokйmon he meets without any effort whatsoever, especially fire-types.<br><br>The Unova series is really awful about this. One episode is basically &quot;Oh, hey Tepig! You&#39;ve been abandoned by your Trainer, just like every other fire starter I&#39;ve ever met, but with the added condition that you&#39;ve been alone, forced into a life of desperation, and expecting your Trainer to return for what may have been months? Here, come with me, and everything will be all better. You&#39;ll literally <u>forget that you ever had any sort of problem</u> three episodes from now!&quot; You know, despite the fact that Charmander/Charizard&#39;s character was interesting due to the way it reacted to a very similar problem even seasons after Ash found it, and Charmander wasn&#39;t even suffering visible abandonment issues when it had been found. The Tepig was <i>emotionally scarred</i> by its original trainer <i>tying it up and practically starving it to keep it from following him</i>, and Ash just takes Tepig in and it drops any repercussions that it might have due to an objectively horrible past.<br><br>That&#39;s Ash&#39;s main Canon Stu trait for me, aside from the one mentioned before where he wins battles with no effort and horrible strategies. Whenever he&#39;s directly involved, logical responses to anything, even responses that could make interesting subplots or provide distinguishing experiences for characters, go out the window.<br><br>That, and the fact that he was &quot;the chosen one&quot; for two separate prophecies and one secret organization in three completely unlinked regions, but that&#39;s peanuts to the bad psychology and the total affronts to logic he creates.</p>

            <p>The most recent &quot;chosen one&quot; nonsense occurs in the Black-Victini and Reshiram or White-Victini and Zekrom movie(the creators never said which is canonical, so they are assumed to both be by most sources, which is stupid because they contradict each other&#39;s backstories), where he allies himself with Reshiram/Zekrom for what amounts to &quot;pursuing the best truth&quot; or the &quot;best ideals&quot;, respectively (because that&#39;s <i>never</i> a Mary Sue trait), and leads the legendary that he befriends to go beat down on the other one, who was pursuing the &quot;wrong&quot; path. This is despite the fact that in the episodes, he had already attuned to Zekrom, which means that in Black-Victini and Reshiram, he was not only usurping the role of the player character, but also attuning to both legendary dragons of Unova, which is specifically said to be <i>impossible</i>. That&#39;s why the storyline needed two heroes! The dragons&#39; divine portfolios and personalities are too different to be contained in one individual, whether that be human or Pokйmon! It is a <i>core</i> component of the Unova legend!<br>...<br>Okay, I&#39;m going to go cool down for a minute before I tell you the last one, because it is a doozy and I want a clear head when talking to you about it. I have trouble with continuity damage. Rage trouble.<br>...<br>I&#39;m okay now.<br><br>Ash was also the &quot;chosen one&quot; in the Lucario and the Mystery of Mew movie, where his real Stuish tendencies come out. Here we go...<br><br>He was the only surviving descendant of a secret organization called the Aura Guardians, and thus the only one capable of using their Lost Technology to look through time, summon a time-sealed Lucario, and heal a gigantic tree-like lifeform of its undescribed ailment. Also, when he was in the presence of that time-Lucario, he could shoot balls of life-force at things, because he was part Aura Guardian. Yes, that&#39;s all the explanation the movie gives for him gaining and then losing the power to summon orbs of spontaneous destruction.<br><br>The tree-thing was not a Pokйmon, in case you were wondering. It was a gigantic rock-covered creature made of crystal and the technology of an anime-exclusive ancient civilization, and it kept gigantic shape-shifting blobs that typically took the form of Kabutops or Omastar inside its body to serve as a biological security system.<br>Lucario and the Mystery of Mew was messed up, is basically what I&#39;m saying here. I&#39;d link a picture of those blob-nasties, but I can&#39;t get Google to show me any. I must be using the wrong search terms.<br><br>Basically, there is no doubt in my mind that Ash is a massive blight on the canon. When one movie has enough Stu-traits to merit a kill and a second has enough to send the unprepared reaching for a flamethrower, he deserves to be purged.</p>

            <p>You went into a little more detail than I needed, but that&#39;s OK. However, about the Unova movie, I do not understand part of your rage, since (going by what&#39;s been out in the US; I do not know if you&#39;re somehow following the Japanese release, which is a few episodes ahead of us) Ash only <i>saw</i> Zekrom; he was not established as the Hero of Ideals, so both movies can serve as canon (remember that in gamesverse, Black and White serve as alternate canons).<br><br>I have seen Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, and I do not think that Ash was a <i>descendant</i> of the Aura Guardians; he just happened to have a similar Aura to Sir Aaron, the original trainer of the eponymous Lucario, which allowed him to (try to) make the Ultimate Sacrifice in the end. Either way, I would not classify that as so Stuish that, were Ash not a canon, he&#39;d necessitate a sporking.</p>

            <p>N is already the Hero of Truth there, due to Ghetsis forcibly attuning him to Reshiram in a process that was never fully described, and they&#39;re making it pretty blatant that Ash is going to be the Hero of Ideals, partially because Zekrom was giving him &quot;special attention&quot;, and partially because Ash has to stick his head into absolutely everything.<br><br>It&#39;s been a while since I saw Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, so I could have misremembered whether Ash&#39;s ability to use Aura Guardian technology meant he was a descendant or not. However, if he had a similar enough aura to one of the Aura Guardians to summon the Lucario and use everything that they could, and he <i>wasn&#39;t</i> related to them in some way, that might be even more Stuish than the alternative.<br>At least if he was their descendant, his powers could be some sort of genetic throwback, but the chances of a random kid becoming Lugia&#39;s chosen one <i>and</i> just <i>happening</i> to have dormant Aura Guardian energies is much lower than him just manifesting a recessive trait. And when him having that recessive trait at <i>all</i> is Stuish, that&#39;s saying something.<br><br>Anyway, like darklordaakmal said, I couldn&#39;t spork him in any case. He&#39;s Protected.<br>And I agree with what you said in one of the other posts about the show getting better as a whole in Unova. Ash is still a Stu, but he&#39;s putting his Stuish power to decent use some of the time, the villains aren&#39;t the sort of people who just fall down when he shows up any more, and he&#39;s finally got a character to serve as the guy we look at and say &quot;Well, I guess he could be worse. He could be that guy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That guy&quot; being Cilan. Cilan&#39;s not Stuish, but one of the reasons I stopped watching the American version is that I got so tired of hearing him say things like &quot;Boy! That Flamethrower is adding a new spicy ingredient to this battle&#39;s recipe! As a battling connoisseur, I approve!&quot; I&#39;m not sure whether the writers/dubbers are trying to set him up as the most obnoxious companion in the show&#39;s history, or if they&#39;re just oblivious. Since none of the other characters ever get to the end of their tolerance with him, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the latter.<br><br>That, or they really <i>are</i> trying to make Ash seem more watchable by comparison. If they are, it&#39;s working.</p>

            <p>... is that Ash, for NO REASON WHATSOEVER, goes back to &quot;incompetent kid&quot; as soon as he steps into a new region.<br><br>For examples, towards the end of Sinnoh, Ash manages to use his fairly regular pokemons to great effect against rare ones thanks to his unconventional strategies. He&#39;s the only one to actually manage to knock out Tobias&#39; Darkray This guy has six Pokemons, like Ash and al the others. We only see two, as everyone who isn&#39;t Ash gets curbstomped by Darkray alone and Ash barely manages to defeat it with all of his six pokemons, only to be finished off by Tobias&#39; second one, another rare uber-powerful one. Yeah, sure. (Seriously, I kinda want to put a Gary-Stu-wanted-dead-not-alive warrant on that guy.)<br><br>Clearly there&#39;s something wrong in all of this.<br><br>Then Unima starts, and Ash is so incompetent and obnoxious that I facepalmed after watching the first couple of episodes. Where the hell went all of his character development?<br>Not to mention that poor Pikachu got himself nerfed again. Although I kinda understand that - by the end of the first arc that cute yellow mouse was able to go against a Dragonite and lose by a very little margin. (If I recall correctly, Dragonite fainted just a couple seconds after Pikachu)</p>

            <p>Eeeyeh... I didn&#39;t mean a generalization for all kids&#39; shows, I meant because it&#39;s targeted at a demographic consisting of mostly kids that like to idealize people. So what better way than to idealize said protagonist? Of course, there are better ways than doing so, instead of Stu-ifying him but yeah, creators are creators, can&#39;t say much about that. Plus the original seasons had &#39;The Power of Friendship&#39; theme for the most part, so I guess Status Quo is God in this case.</p>

            <p>Well, it is <b>is</b> a children&#39;s franchise, isn&#39;t it?<br><br>If the shows were to be realistic, Ash would most definitely be losing left and right, because once he learns the best way to tackle and opponent (and mostly because the Type efficiencies in Pokemon are in a scissors-paper-stone system) the battles are going to get predictable. Very predictable. And we all know what happens when a kids&#39; cartoon gets predictable - the company loses money because no one wants to watch it anymore! The horror!<br><br>Unevolved Pokemon are usually there for the cute factor. I think in the first generation of the anime he carried around at least one fully-evolved Pokemon, but in the subsequent generations his Pokemon hardly seemed to evolve. Granted, Pikachu refused to evolve, but the rest who technically should have evolved via leveling hardly do either.<br><br>Actually, about Liepard... I find that it&#39;s attacks in-game (referring to BW 1 and 2) are pretty weak, so a Krookodile should be able to withstand some hits. Given that both are Dark-type as well, Type resistances should come into play. I think if anyone else were to do this they would most certainly change their active Pokemon instead of just waiting out the potentially long battle. Normal attacks against Rock, Dark attacks against Dark. Whooo, yeah. I think I&#39;m going to just mash the &#39;A&#39; key while doing the dishes.<br><br>Having a different protagonist for each region won&#39;t have the same effect as having the same protagonist everywhere, and you do need said protagonist to somehow get around regions after exploring them more or less thoroughly. The formula here would be quite the same as the game: Enter region, beat Gym Leaders, Beat Team Whatever at Whatever they&#39;re doing, Meet a Legendary (Okay, so this mostly happens outside of anime now, in the movies instead), crush a few League people, then set sail for the next region. Like in the game itself, but do you see it getting old?<br><br>So, verdict. Yes, he is a bordeline Stu, but as I said above, this is a kids&#39; show about a video game. If Ash really were to play as an experienced Trainer, it would get pretty boring quickly, so yeah.<br><br>Bleh. Anyway, high five, fellow PokeFan.</p>

            <p>I think it is justified. I remembered an episode in the first season of Pokemon, where Ash had to release Butterfree since it is fully evolved and has to mate. I assume Ash subconsciously banned his Pokemon from doing the same. But Charizard may throw my hypothesis to the dumpster.</p>

            <p>In fact, it was a pretty large part of Dawn&#39;s(from the Sinnoh series) character, at least in the episodes that I saw, that she could only control her Pokйmon after certain criteria were met, most of those tying into gaining their trust. Seeing her work her hardest to get Mamoswine to trust her after its evolution changed its personality is a huuuuge contrast to the way the series treats Ash.<br>Pokйmon essentially line up to be with Ash, to the extent that a Latias, a legendary Pokйmon that is essentially the female form of that second ьber-powerful Pokйmon Sergio Turbo mentioned, <i>attempts to pursue a romantic relationship with him.</i> If that doesn&#39;t brand him a Stu, especially when when stacked with the rest of his traits, I don&#39;t know what will.<br><br>As for the &quot;preventing them from evolving&quot; thing, Pikachu and Bulbasaur didn&#39;t evolve on purpose, but most of the rest could have done it if he ever bothered to <i>train them</i>. He never actually trains anything, despite announcing that he&#39;s a Pokйmon Trainer almost as often as he announces his hometown, and he spreads <i>that</i> around like he&#39;s the sole member of its department of tourism. The closest we get to him training in any respect is when he tries to teach something a TM move(without ever getting his hands on a TM, mind you), and the trainee has trouble with it for two episodes before using it to bring down a Gym Leader. Just... uugh. Ash Ketchum. Ash Glaurunging Ketchum.</p>

            <p>Or to put it more specifically, the Pokemon he gets in other regions?<br><br>Because somehow after each region, he places all the Pokemon he caught (somewhere, maybe with Prof. Oak) and goes to the new region with only Pikachu. So how would the new Pokemon know that Ash would release them upon final evolution?<br><br>If Pikachu doesn&#39;t tell them, that is. But then why would Pikachu tell them?

            <p>Which is why I didn&#39;t prescribe to my own assumptions. Charizard stayed with Ash for a long time, and Butterfree was released immediately. And I&#39;m not even sure if evolution is voluntary, or a stage of life they must pass through.<br><br>Then again, it may be that Pikachu is the one doing most fights and voluntarily not try to evolve, and other Pokemons Ash had didn&#39;t fight enough to evolve(?).

            <p>If so then Pikachu would be overleveled, and on times where Ash has to depend on his other Pokemon for stuff like Gym battles his underleveled Pokemon pull through too?<br><br>And as to evolution, I think it&#39;s more of a life stage for those who don&#39;t use stones.

            <p>Paras and Parasect are based on the Cordyceps fungi, which is a parasitic organism that controls the brains of insects. While the World One Cordyceps just marches an ant or beetle into a nest before bursting out of its head and spreading spores to infect the rest of the swarm, the fungus controlling Parasect is master of its entire body on a level akin to the fungus gaining sapience. Once it&#39;s at that stage, it starts producing spores. The fungus essentially hijacks the energy of evolution to assist in its own life cycle. It&#39;s fascinating, really, especially from a biological standpoint.<br><br>The girl from the first season wanted her Parasect to evolve to use a chemical in those spores for medicine, and the undeveloped fungus on her Paras wasn&#39;t mature enough to produce them. The Parasect was stronger once it evolved partially because it had increased to the &quot;adult&quot; stage of its life, but also because before then, its native mind and the fungus were vying for control over its body. When it became Parasect, the Paras&#39;s mind was completely subsumed, and thus the fungus was no longer forced to hold back. It could then use all of the power in Paras&#39;s body without fear of backlash from the now-destroyed consciousness of the body&#39;s original tenant.<br><br>Isn&#39;t science fun?</p>
