            <p><i>Hey there! Welcome to another episode of the mini-series based on another mini-series. The technical term would be mini-series<sup>2</sup>, but I’ve had a bit of trouble having it recognized by the Systиme Intenational as a true metric unit.

It turns out that it was actually an EPC staging area for the Tolkien ‘verse. Two Enforcers of the Plot Continuum agents have been captured and a third one was killed during the fight. I have personally overseen the team sent to salvage and dismantle the camp.<br><br>Technician Frank Wolff of the DoSAT has remarked that some of the machines acquired during the raid were specifically designed to interfere with our portal and comms channels. None of the devices had been assembled yet, but their activation would have restricted our ability to portal agents into badfics.<br><br>We have also recovered some books and paperwork at the camp, most of which describe surveillance techniques and even some observations on some of our own agents (see attachment). By the looks of it, they have been monitoring our movements in the Tolkien ‘verse for about two weeks.<br><br>The two captured operatives, Yazzmine Moonweaver and Jess’ca Sunhammer, are Suvian-positive according to DMSER tests, but their Glitter levels are far below normal levels: 56% as opposed to +70%. The scientists theorize this is to lower the risk of detection by the C-CAD’s Glitter detection suites.

            <p>I&#39;m a bit dubious about the, er, actual possibility of it - as I recall, the whole point of the Mirror Multiverse was that it was incredibly hard to get to - but I still found the story(let) fun to read.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As for the EPC-lands-in-the-Prime-multiverse thing, I was inspired by mirror!Ontic&#39;s claim that the EPC was planning to take over the Prime multiverse. I figured that if Sues can bend space-time and create the most impossible geological aberrations, then a determined team of Sue-scientists might one day create a plothole big enough to hop across dimensions.<br><br>The thing is, if I do go ahead and write about the EPC crossing over into the Prime multiverse, I&#39;m going to create a new DoI division. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure if that would be too big of a change for the Department, so I&#39;m open to opinions and ideas just to be safe. The actions of this new division shouldn&#39;t affect the operations of any other branch of the PPC, so.... yeah.</p>

            <p>... the key question is whether it&#39;s something that would reasonably come under Intel&#39;s wossname.

            <p>I&#39;m just being slow about posting the replies I wrote to people who gave me advice, and about finishing editing my reply to her. But the advice has helped, and...we&#39;ll see what happens with the author.<br><br>It&#39;s just annoying, because she&#39;s so likable! Only her writing is...well, awful, really. If you take out all the twisted canon and characterization, then it just goes to &#39;passable, but needs work&#39;--except, it&#39;s fanfic, so that doesn&#39;t work. And the other problem is that I don&#39;t want to actually be her beta...(partially because I have too many projects already, and partially because, in the case of her latest story, my advice as a beta would be to scrap the entire story and work out a different plot--or at least, take the Aragorn romance out of it).<br><br>Sorry about the rant, but...it&#39;s a topic that easily lends itself to ranting. Also, I&#39;m pretty sure this is the first time I&#39;ve had a lengthy conversation with someone who wrote such bad fanfic, even though I know how to dissect bad fanfic...so I know what I&#39;m talking about, but not how to deal with someone whose writing has more errors than accurate facts. Especially as I&#39;m not completely sure yet if she&#39;s willing to improve her writing.<br><br>Thanks for &#39;listening&#39; :)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Kitty Pictures: You may need several for each kitty, to represent certain poses. I&#39;m actually wanting to do this for you in terms of the OCs, especially StarGleam. (She&#39;s purple, therefore her pictures need to be edited.)<br>Silly Sound Effects: I found some good ones here:<br><a href="http://www.grsites.com/archive/sounds/"><a href="http://www.grsites.com/archive/sounds/">http://www.grsites.com/archive/sounds/</a></a><br>Music: You definitely need classical background music.

            <p>Ah, yes. The only &quot;legendary badfic&quot; I can actually tolerate. It&#39;s not disturbing, like most of them, just horrible lack of SPaG. But, in the case of this video, I couldn&#39;t watch the whole thing at once, I was laughing so hard! I had to watch it a few minutes at a time. Laughter: my biggest strength and weakness. Also, the live action trailer for &quot;legolas&quot; is very funny.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m trying to finish up an Indiana Jones mission that speed-ages the poor guy to over 100 years old.  The Suethor doesn&#39;t describe how he (or anything else) looks, so I was going to base my description on George Hall&#39;s &quot;Old Indy&quot; from <i>The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles</i>.<br><br>However, according to the reviews on Amazon, the official DVD releases cut all of Hall&#39;s scenes.

            <p>. . . my instinct would be to use the appearance of Hall!Indy, simply because there&#39;s nothing else in the <i>published</i> canon to go by.  Since &quot;Old Indy&quot; doesn&#39;t directly contradict canon, and is the closest thing we have to Indy being one hundred years old, it seems reasonable that the Word World would default to that.<br><br>But that&#39;s just my take on the problem.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the link!  It&#39;s been too long since I watched that series, and I didn&#39;t tape it at the time.  There&#39;s only one photo (that I&#39;ve found) of Old Indy on the Indiana Jones wiki.<br><br>My concern was that Lucas has gone back and changed canon before <i>(Han shot first)</i>, I wasn&#39;t sure if he&#39;d ever said that he didn&#39;t like Old Indy so it didn&#39;t happen.</p>

            <p>I think you could call it something along the lines of Word of God, because it does not sound uncanon per-se, but it is not anon either. Hmmm... I&#39;d say, file it under justified fanon or outright noncanon, though that sounds a little harsh seeing as it was going to be canon, just got cut later. Just my thoughts though.</p>

            <p>I bring back all the minis from a mission, even ones from unobserved portions of the fic, for the sake of completeness, and to give as many folks the opportunity to adopt some as possible.<br><br>Obviously, in a mission with absolute butt-tons of minis, there is no obligation to name them all in the text itself.

            <p>Have I been here long enough to ask permission? <br>If so, there is a certain Dragon Quest VIII badfic I want to spork called &quot;The Journey&quot; by Murix Bob.

She is more often seen with a smile than with a frown, even when slaughtering Mary Sues. However, she can (and will, if it is severe enough) get upset about major breaches from canon.

            <p>1) How long does it have to be?<br>2) I read that you could use agent backstories when requesting permission. Is that true?<br>3) Where should I write my writing sample? (If I can post it in a separate topic post, can I post it there?)</p>

            <p>Two main reasons:<br><br>1. I&#39;m not convinced you read or fully understood the Permission article before posting. Many of the questions you asked in this thread are answered there, and you didn&#39;t seem to know the requirements for a permission request—for instance, it took my prompting to even bring the issue of the writing sample into the conversation. Whether you haven&#39;t read it or just didn&#39;t get it, either way is not a good sign. Reading and the comprehension of it are both important to PPCing.<br><br>2. Your writing needs more work. The basic SPaG mechanics are mostly there, but overall, it seems like you wrote this piece in a hurry and haven&#39;t really looked it over since, or consulted a beta about it, either. There are some systemic problems, and more questions raised than answered for the reader. I&#39;ll bring some of them up as I go through the main issues.<br><br>First, there&#39;s a whole lot of telling instead of showing. The whole history section in particular is made of this, and then the characters tell us what we&#39;ve already been told with their dialogue about having a job to do. Readers want to learn about the world by experiencing it through the characters, not have it spelled out to them ahead of time only to have it repeated. You could have set up the setting by showing us how Kaite and Daisy became Dream Knights, for instance; by describing the world as they move through it. Think of the narrative as the lens of a camera, only it lets in sounds and smells and textures and emotions as well as light as it passes over the story. Usually the camera is whatever character we&#39;re following at the time, so we experience things as the character does, but as you get more comfortable you can play with different perspectives and such.<br><br>Furthermore, regarding that particular bit of dialogue, the characters should already know this stuff, so it feels forced and unnatural on top of being redundant with the narrative. People rarely feel the need to tell each other things they already know. Also, if Daisy is really so young and air-headed as to forget what she&#39;s supposed to be doing at any given time, how is she suitable for what seems like important work as a Dream Knight?<br><br>Second, there are some serious contradictions. For instance, we&#39;re told it takes more than twenty minutes to get to the Nightmare World because you have to cross a long, thin cloud bridge on the way. However, when Kaite uses the star button, the other Dream Knights are there instantaneously, &quot;on cue.&quot; How did they get there so quickly? Where did they come from? Were they in the Nightmare World all along? If so, what are Kaite and Daisy even needed for? Shouldn&#39;t this huge army have things under control?<br><br>Then there are sentences like this one: &quot;There were no guards, due to the fact that everyone felt like guards were necessary.&quot;<br><br>Did you mean &quot;unnecessary&quot;? Even if that&#39;s the case, how are guards unnecessary if Dream Knights regularly turn up to keep the Nightmare World in order whether they want it or not? Don&#39;t the Nightmare World citizens want to keep them out—I mean, isn&#39;t that what a gate is for? I definitely didn&#39;t get the impression that the Knights were invited over.<br><br>Third, some things are just downright confusing, like this passage: &quot;Most of the citizens retreated back into their houses, even if they were on fire. The citizens who had burning houses then stepped outside their homes to complain about it.&quot;<br><br>Did they... somehow... not know their houses were on fire before they went in? Otherwise, why would they go to all the trouble of going inside first if they were just going to come back out and complain? It doesn&#39;t make sense. Are they supposed to be dumb? Silly? What?<br><br>Also, this passage: &quot;Both girls faced away from the gate to see various creatures attacking each other, various people setting houses on fire somehow, and weapons flying, both figuratively and literally.&quot;<br><br>This is very nondescript and paints a terribly vague mental picture. What are these various creatures? Since they are &quot;various,&quot; what different kinds are there? Who are these various people? What do they look like? Are they different from Dream World citizens? What kind of weapons do they have? Are they throwing swords and guns at each other?<br><br>Also, beware the narrative &quot;somehow.&quot; It&#39;s a red flag to the reader that the writer either has not stopped to think about what is happening or couldn&#39;t be bothered to clue us in, either of which is bad news. If the writer doesn&#39;t care to put the effort in, why should we? In this case, you could have just left the word out and it wouldn&#39;t have been an issue; we&#39;d just assume the normal methods of setting fire to buildings, like torches, or maybe fire spells, since magic seems to be a thing here.<br><br>Altogether, that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying no for now. I&#39;m sorry if it seems harsh, and please understand I don&#39;t mean all the questions to grill you. They&#39;re just things that came up as I was reading. I ask them to point out areas where you could improve the story, if you want to rewrite it for next time. &#39;Cause there can always be a next time. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I see a lot of &quot;unnecessary quotation marks&quot; here, particularly around the terms &quot;hub&quot;, &quot;dreamers&quot;, &quot;Real-Life Clones&quot;, &quot;RLC&quot;, &quot;sister&quot;, &quot;Nightmare World&quot;, and &quot;Dream Knights&quot;. I think the average reader would understand these terms are either used ironically or the names of things that the reader wouldn&#39;t think of assigning names to.<br><br><br>Also, in this piece:<br><br><i>In fact, it was more likely to encounter a “RLC” that acted nothing like the person they look like.</i><br><br>...Instead of &#39;a RLC&#39;, that should probably read &#39;an RLC&#39;, since if you read RLC aloud, it would sound like ARE-ELL-SEE, which would necessitate the use of &#39;an&#39;.<br><br><br>I think it&#39;s an interesting idea, but it&#39;s very short and the unnecessary quotations make the flow of the story very choppy. With some polish, this could turn into something very fun to read.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve seen this fic before, but . . . Egh.  Urgh.  Blargh.  Why.<br><br>The author just changed so much about the Potterverse, it stops feeling like a Potter anything at all.  The entire plot is doomed to fail, because it creates a paradox.  Very simply: Harry has a sucky life, causing him to go back and &quot;fix&quot; it, causing the new, young Harry to have a wonderful life, which would remove the cause for him to have gone back to fix it in the first place.<br><br>Then again, Avenging!Harry is so clearly not Harry, perhaps it would have worked, since the real child Harry grew up to be thrown into a plothole.  Then Avenging!Harry could keep on changing the timeline all he wanted, in an eternal cycle of putting wrong what once went . . . not quite as wrong.  You two did a great job of showing off all the ways in which Avenging!Harry was a replacement, through his speech, behavior and mannerisms.  This is probably one of the worst examples we&#39;ve seen of an OC coming into a canon and actively trying to do as much damage as possible!<br><br>Especially annoying to me were all the ways living wizards were able to manipulate things after death in the fic.  The afterlife was always treated in canon as an utter unknown, but Avenging!Harry was able to affect Ginny and Dumbledore&#39;s existences just by speaking sentences, and he was absolutely certain of what he had done.  It&#39;s downright creepy.<br><br>Heather, Ted and Kayla all have very distinctive personalities, and I barely had to pay attention to the &quot;said Teds&quot; and such because of how well their dialogue communicated their characters.<br><br>During the charging process, when Heather kept claiming to hear something after the replacement!portrait&#39;s moans, I thought for sure it was building up to some terrible danger about to interrupt the charging/assassination.  My expectations were all built up, waiting for the surprise to come . . . and then everything went off without a hitch.  Perhaps  I failed to get a joke?  Or maybe this mystery is to be answered in a future episode?<br><br>I didn&#39;t understand how Ted knew where the plothole containing Harry&#39;s family was, until I read the extended charge list and saw that the cave that contained it had been ignored throughout the entire fic.  You might want to make that more clear in the mission, since not everyone would read the extra materials.<br><br>A couple of mistakes I saw:<br><br><i>&quot;&#39;Especially the portrait of one of Hogwarts most beloved headmasters.&#39;&quot;</i> &quot;Hogwarts&quot; needs an apostrophe at the end.<br><br><i>&quot;The group of agents were gently tipped to the ground in what appeared to be a very clean Kings Cross Station.&quot;</i>  &quot;Were&quot; should be was (the group was) and &quot;Kings Cross Station&quot; should be &quot;King&#39;s Cross station&quot; (So sayeth Wikipedia).</p>

            <p>I thought that this mission was enjoyable, though I do have some criticisms which I&#39;ll get to in a bit.  <br><br>I like that your agents talk about their fic preferences and favorite ships.  It makes them much more relatable than someone who only sees this as a job that needs doing.  So, kudos on that.  I also liked the choice of making the section breaks into barbed wire, though I wonder how being struck by something like that did so little damage.  Portaling ahead and ambushing the Stu was a good idea, as well.  No one expects their epic exit to be cut short by a fist fight.<br><br>So, my biggest problem with the mission was that the pacing seemed really fast and, because of that, some of the conclusions seemed to spring out of nowhere.  Like how they knew where the characters were.  I might have missed it, but it seemed like the agents just knew, for some reason.  I almost wonder if it was a relic of an earlier draft that no one caught.<br><br>Anyway, it was an enjoyable read, as I said.  Job well done.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Alright.<br>--<br><br>Brenda Loringham, DMS (Freelance)<br>Brenda is generally good-natured and easy-going, with a tendency to bounciness, except when faced with such things as crimes against canon. She detests Sues and Suethors with a passion, and has trouble understanding why anyone would *want* to warp canon in the first place. She originates in World One, and claims never to have written a Sue (it&#39;s unclear whether this is true, or if she has simply suppressed the memory). She often works in the LotR division, although she has a soft spot for James Bond and will take missions in almost any canon that she knows. Her preferred weapon is a longbow. She is somewhere in her 20s, and of average height with light brown hair and brown eyes to match. She is also farsighted, and often has trouble reading displays, but refuses to admit that she needs glasses. She was dismayed and disgusted to be partnered with a former Suethor, but does her best to get past that. (She is, unfortunately, not always successful).<br><br>Charlie Shoe, DMS (Freelance)<br>Charlotte Shoe (generally known as Charlie) is much newer to the PPC than Brenda and is still having trouble adjusting. She is often nervous, but tends to get upset at such unlikely things as anime-style Muggle clothing at Hogwarts and Tolkien&#39;s Elves talking and behaving like human teenagers. She is a former Suethor from World One, and wrote numerous crossover Suefics, but has since attended OFUM (as most of her stories involved extraneous characters coming to Middle-earth) and reformed. She has a special fondness for Tolkien&#39;s poetry, and can recite most of it on demand. She is frequently unnerved by Brenda, generally when the latter remembers Charlie&#39;s history, but works well enough with her in the field. She prefers missions in the LotR or HP continua, but knows many others and is willing to take missions in them without much complaint. She is shorter than Brenda and in the latter half of her teens, with wavy blonde hair that turns white-blonde when given enough sun, and light blue eyes. She has yet to develop a weapons preference, and usually just uses whatever works best with her current disguise.<br><br>Note: Charlie was sent into one of the worst of her Crossover Suefics for her first mission, along with a male DIC agent. Brenda was sent in to find them after they lost contact with HQ mid-call. The mission went rather disastrously (although it became hilarious in hindsight) for the most part, but in the end was sorted out by the three agents. It was on this mission that Brenda learned that her shiny new (sane!) partner was a former Suethor, and became upset enough to start vowing vengeance on the SO. (Nothing came of her threats, possibly due to the fact that by the time she and Charlie had finished with all the missions that were dumped on them immediately afterwards she was too exhausted to do anything more than collapse and threaten to portal into the Avengers &#39;verse and borrow the Hulk to smash the console if it dared to BEEP! again any time soon.)<br><br>They share RC #29 (unless that gets taken before I get permission), and will probably pick up various minis and pets throughout their PPC career.<br><br>--<br>Hopefully that&#39;s short enough. If I left out something important that you need to know, just ask.<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>I love that I could identify Tom Paris and B&#39;Elanna Torres from context and their &quot;voices&quot; before their names were mentioned. That is a sign of good work!<br><br>I&#39;d love to read more about what actually goes on in the classes, like the actual teaching part, but I guess you&#39;ve got a full year&#39;s worth to cover in future chapters.<br><br>I&#39;m also increasingly sad that DS9 isn&#39;t involved, because I keep noticing instances where the cast would be helpful, like in Dating in Starfleet. Trill and Klingon romance, anyone? How about Ferengi and Bajoran? What if the woman you&#39;re dating turns out to be a space pirate with a heart of gold and you have to bring her in? Awkward!<br><br>Janeway and O&#39;Brien could totally come in to help talk about being married in Starfleet, though. That&#39;s a tricky beast, and I&#39;m sure they all have different ways of coping with the stresses involved. I don&#39;t know much about Janeway&#39;s marriage, but O&#39;Brien&#39;s is particularly rocky at times.<br><br>... Muaha. If the fanbrats are particularly ill-behaved, you can always inflict Neelix and Kes on them. They&#39;re so sappy!<br><br>I will stop telling you how to conduct your OFU now. <sup>_<sup>;<br><br>~Neshomeh</sup></sup></p>

            <p>First of all, did you realize they were Tom and B&#39;Elanna before or after B&#39;Elanna started listing her minis? Because if it was after then that wasn&#39;t any talent on my part. If it was before, wow. I don&#39;t think there were any hints.<br><br>Yes, more of the actual teaching will be shown later.

When I started OFAS, I hadn&#39;t seen any of it, and now I&#39;ve seen maybe 5 episodes. I like it so far, and I plan to write the DS9/Enterprise branch of OFAS after this one&#39;s done.

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure I suspected before B&#39;Elanna called her minis; that confirmed it. Tom Paris sounded particularly Tom Paris-like, and you&#39;d mentioned this chapter was <i>Voyager</i>-heavy, and he and B&#39;Elanna would make sense to teach a class about dating as a couple. It all added up. {= )<br><br>Whoops, Janeway was <i>engaged</i> at the beginning of the series. Had to check Memory Alpha about that—I just remembered that she was involved with a guy and had a picture of him, and got mixed up. <sup>_<sup>;</sup></sup> Still, though, she&#39;d know something about dating in Starfleet.<br><br>Just gonna put out there that I&#39;d be willing to help with DS9 stuff, as and when you want. I haven&#39;t quite reached the end of the series, but I&#39;m close enough that I&#39;d be pretty comfortable consulting. For instance, if you want to know what O&#39;Brien and Worf get up to for characterization purposes.<br><br>Kes... I dunno, she was kind of annoying, but she also had enough good moments to balance it out, as I recall. Her relationship with the Doctor was cool. I&#39;ve only seen the first two or three seasons of <i>Voyager</i>, though, so maybe she gets more ridiculous later? I did wonder if they were going to do something about her species&#39; short lifespan, and I guess there&#39;s the psychic thing. *shrug*<br><br>Oddly enough, though, I like Neelix. He&#39;s just so earnest about everything, it&#39;s hard to hold it against him even when he&#39;s being ridiculous.<br><br>All plotholes in Trekverse? That&#39;s, uh, a lot of plotholes.

            <p>Yes, Janeway is slated to be a guest speaker in Dating in Starfleet. That&#39;s how I&#39;m including characters who aren&#39;t teaching classes, as well as, in Janeway&#39;s case, elaborating on characters who are teaching already.<br><br>By the time I do DS9, I&#39;ll probably be caught up on it. I&#39;ll certainly tell you when I do, though. (I&#39;m already looking forward to it.)<br><br>Kes strikes me as a Canon Sue for the simple reason that I can&#39;t find any flaws. Everyone loves her, and she has special powers, and she&#39;s all sweetness and purity and light. Seven of Nine, who replaced her in the fourth season, was much less Sue-y. Despite being the obvious Ms. Fanservice, she used to be Borg - was in fact assimilated so young that she was basically raised by the Borg collective. Then she suffers the trauma of being seperated, and there&#39;s a wonderful Humanity Ensues character arc as she slowly gains the crew&#39;s trust, comes to terms with her Borg nature and all that entails, and explores different parts of the human experience.<br><br>I didn&#39;t like Neelix at first, but he grew on me. I think it was his relationship with Tuvok that did it - his constant perkiness contrasted with Tuvok&#39;s solid Vulcan-ness made for humor and interesting character  development.<br><br>Yes, all plotholes.  Though the less obvious ones just float aimlessly around, sometimes causing malfunctions when they hit things. Like making Data use contractions. The bigger ones can be used as storage.</p>

            <p>For me, the main thing that makes a Sue is that they bend (or break) the rules around them, whether they be rules of characterization or basic rules of reality. So, just having alien powers and being really nice and thus popular isn&#39;t necessarily Sueish, but if members of the crew treat her differently than they do other nice people, or if her abilities contradict previously established Trekverse rules without a really solid reason, that would be Sueish.

            <p>OK, that was hilarious. Miss Gloria using Hanssen as an assistant makes sense, and the text strings and text walls are brilliant - as is the idea of making the students take their lessons in a room build from them.<br><br>Oh, poor Janeway. She really needs that coffee, having to teach that lot. She fits her teaching subject well, too - and I liked the &#39;You have all been put in this class because it has been decided that you need it&#39;. So true.<br><br>Oh, and the fangirls are fighting again. Lovely comparison between the sheer chaos of the fangirls battling each other and the complete calm of Paris and B&#39;Elanna. I see B&#39;Elanna has a lot of minis, too. (Also the: &#39;don&#39;t be gentle about it&#39;, HA!)<br><br>I had some more ideas, too:<br><br>1. Students vs some varient on the Kobayashi Maru test. Exam, perhaps?<br>2. Have you noticed how often in badfic the Sues/Stus make a bee-line straight for the biggest big bad they can (often the Borg, but not always) and win, just so they can show how powerful they are? Maybe later the fanbrats need a practical lesson in why that is a bad idea...<br>3. Star Trek is one of the few fandoms in which there are as many fanboys as fangirls. Imagine a class full of fanboys given the teacher of Seven or Uhura etc. Poor teacher, but probably even more poor fanboys.<br><br>Looking forward to more, as ever. Keep it up!<br><br></p>

            <p>I already had some of those planned for the afternoon classes. Your first and second suggestions will be features of the class taught by the three captains. (Having all three trying to teach together is going to be…interesting) Deanna Troi&#39;s teaching a class, and Seven and the Borg Queen are co-teaching another class, which covers your third suggestion.<br>And yes, the winner for having the most minis in Star Trek is…B&#39;Elanna Torres! <br>Oh,  and I figured Janeway would be violently against Sues, especially Grrl Power!Sues. I&#39;ve written a story called &quot;Dear Fanfiction Writers&quot; which is exactly what it sounds like, and Janeway expresses her distaste for Sues.  Glad you enjoyed the chapter!</p>

            <p>No problem. {= ) It&#39;s easy to get overzealous with new habits. I went through that with semi-colons in particular.

I got the impression from the author&#39;s notes that it&#39;s working differently for SC just because... well, because, which isn&#39;t really a good example to set for the students/readers.

            <p>Hey, at least somebody is making an effort to read it.

It&#39;s just, back when I wrote parts one through three, people were chomping at the bit for me to get part four done.

I think I agree with the autobiography idea--it would be very interesting!<br><br>I actually have a relative who enjoys doing occasionally dangerous sports-type activities, though I&#39;m not sure she&#39;s ever been shot.

I&#39;m *pretty* sure the Light Side had the CCCs, and the Dark Side had the brownies (that being why I chose Dark Side), but...&#39;Join the Dark Side, we have cookies!&#39; sounds much too familiar, so who knows? But I digress. Have a wonderful birthday! *debates joining KittyNoodles in the giant birthday huggle* *eventually just gathers up the pudding and puts it in a bowl for you to have later*<br><br>But, all silliness aside, congratulations; may you celebrate many, many more birthdays; and I hope you had a wonderful 20th!<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>...Do everything in your power to keep it that way. They don&#39;t really hurt when it first happens (at least, I don&#39;t remember much more than the massive adrenalin rush and the sense that it <i>should</i> hurt a lot more than it seemed to, which led to gratuitous amounts of shrieking both times...), but the moment the adrenalin runs out and you&#39;re actually in a splint, it will hurt a lot and the splint (and the cast, if it&#39;s a big bone like your leg or your wrist) will itch like <i>crazy</i>. Also, once the cast comes off, your leg/arm/whatever you messed up really will look pale and completely devoid of muscle. Also, the smell (which is a hundred times worse than &#39;sweaty gym socks&#39;) takes about a week and a half to completely go away once the cast is off. It&#39;s not a fun experience overall, so don&#39;t do it.<br><br>(HA, and now I have scarred you forever. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA.)</p>

            <p>20 years old, well done good sir, well done on surviving this long. As a gift, I give onto you one Pinkie Pie Premium Party Pack. Pinkie Pie and her party cannon will make sure your birthday is a blast! Oh, and if you are afraid it&#39;s going to be one of those 6 year old&#39;s birthday parties like she usually does, let me put your fears to rest. The Pinkie Pie Premium Party Pack is not like those other parties, as it is not a canon party. Oh no, it&#39;s a FANON party. The highest quality Sweet Apple Acres cider (non-alcoholic if the legal drinking age is 21 where you live), catering from across the multiverse (she is a forth wall breaker after all, she got connections) and music from the one and only DJ PON-3. Further, with the aid of Dr. Whoves and other Time Lords (turns out Gallopfrey was not destroyed by the Daleks in this universe), your birthday party will last an extra 3.573 hours! <br><br>Happy Birthday from me,<br>(and Jumper.)</p>

            <p>In addition to permission, it&#39;s sort of... really HARD to find a fic that fits criteria that you set up. Badfic first, THEN start planning out a mission. Believe me, I know how difficult it is. But do you know how hard it is to find a fic with an OOC Arcade Gannon? Pretty dang hard!<br><br>So, just look for bad fic first, and then plan your mission around it. If you can find a bad fic that fits your criteria, great! Go for it!

            <p>Hey, it is a bit early for a newbie to post, but I was wondering if I should do a mission on this post. It&#39;s a Short Supernatural Sabriel Slashfic (aliteration) that manages to take both the Winchesters horribly OOC. I don&#39;t really know what Sabriel shippers are thinking, because Sam and Gabriel canonically despise each other and I am preeetty sure that they are both straight. Anyways, link is here:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8922208/1/Broken-hearts"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8922208/1/Broken-hearts">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8922208/1/Broken-hearts</a></a><br><br>P.S.

            <p>Hey, I just discovered ppc about a week ago, and it sounds like a ton of fun. I&#39;m a nerdy Asian high school girl who lives in a tiny town in Virginia. Right now, my current fandoms are Game of Thrones, Supernatural, and Sherlock (BBC). I&#39;ll stick around for a while before I write a mission, so try not to be bugged by my questions. I&#39;m actually really surprised at how little Supernatural stuff is on here, but me and my friend will change that. So, uh, hi :)</p>

            <p>Pros: Well developed characters, realistic world, gripping and unpredictable plot, books are long so they last longer, untraditional and uncliched, lovely prose.<br><br>Cons: Action moves a bit slowly - six books and you still don&#39;t really know who&#39;s winning, it&#39;s easy to get lost while reading (that&#39;s what wikipedia is for), author publishes books at a really slow rate, female characters aren&#39;t really well developed.<br><br>Things you may not like: lots of sex scenes, including ones with underage girls, crapsack world, nobody is truly good (everyone acts like a jerk at some point), many many POV&#39;s, anyone can die.<br><br>Basically, this series is for lovers of really dark fantasy and action. For me, the pros outweigh the cons, but I can&#39;t speak for everyone. I definitely think it&#39;s worth a try, though. And after the first book, you get used to the screwy POV&#39;s.</p>

            <p>Welcome to our humble abode. I admit, it&#39;s not much, but we made do with the materials we had. But what do you expect from a place made out of POST-its and a BOARD!<br>(That was...)<br>Clever? Amusing? Punny?<br>(Anvilisious.)<br>Anvil... what does Anvilisious mea-*CLUNK*<br>(It means it was worthy of anvils on your head.)<br><br>(Hello, my name&#39;s Jumper. Sorry for what World-Jumper did back there, but I&#39;m sure someone, somewhere thinks his puns are funny. Anyway, this is not about him, it&#39;s about greeting you!)<br><br>(Before we continue, there are particular questions I must ask you, because if I don&#39;t, someone else will. They are:<br>1. Have you read The Original Seres, the Constitution and/or any other missions or Official Fanfiction Universities?<br><br>2. How did you find the PPC?<br><br>3. Since you seem to want to write missions, specifically for Supernatural badfic it seems, do you have an idea of what department you want your agent(s) to join?<br><br>4. Would you rather face 100 short badfics, or one Legendary badfic?<br><br>Answer the questions now, and avoid having to answer them later!)<br><br>(Now for the matter of your gift. Game of Thrones fan, hmmm... Here, have a chess game with all the pieces as various chairs and thrones!)<br>(*CLUNK*)<br><br>Payback... is... served... *faints again*</p>

            <p>Wow, I didn&#39;t know I&#39;d be getting so many comments! Thanks for saying hi. To answer World Jumper&#39;s questions:<br><br>I&#39;ve read the Original Series and I think its hilarious. I read the constitution because apparently, its one of requirements for n00bs. <br>I found PPC through Tvtropes, my one true internet love. <br>Imma have three agents : myself, my best friend, and my little bro (they all exist in real life). Me and my best friend (mwahaha I&#39;m evil like that) are probably gonna be in the Department of Bad Slash, and me and my bro are gonna be in the Department of Mary Sues.<br>And I would rather face one hundred short badfics. Trust me, I&#39;d get bored  with the long badfic, and I&#39;d get to fight more Sues and demons.<br>Surprisingly, one of my main concerns is finding badfic for my fandoms (weird, huh?). Most of the fanfics that I have found in my long hours of hunting are surprisingly literate, so I&#39;d be happy to take suggestions, especially for Sherlock and Supernatural.</p>

            <p>Hi!<br><br>The title of this post is slightly misleading; I&#39;m a bit of a lurker so I&#39;ve got a vague idea of going-ons. However, I haven&#39;t lurked in quite a few months, and I haven&#39;t posted in at least two or so years. Even when I was &quot;active&quot; here, I only did post once or twice. <br>In fact, I&#39;ve been gone long enough that I forgot my original screen name. So I figured that I might as well start fresh. After all, past me was (slightly) more foolhardy and naive than I am now. Thus is the life. <br><br>(For the next two or so weeks I&#39;ll be on rather sporadically as it is. Whoops. That&#39;s what happens when you&#39;re on a team sport, I suppose? Perhaps I should have waited to post this?? No not really if I don&#39;t do it now I&#39;ll forget, most likely.)<br><br>Anyways, nice to meet you all! To those I&#39;ve met briefly in the past and forgotten, nice to meet you once again! I do hope we can become better acquainted! <br>Cheers and all that!<br><br>-Rats</p>

            <p>It&#39;s baaaaaack...<br><br>So, what is the fandom buffet? It&#39;s a place where we can all get together and natter on about out favourite fandoms. How do we participate, you ask? It&#39;s very simple! Just create a message-less post with your fandom name in the subject line and then post a message describing it and what you like about it. Afterwards, people can reply to that fandom-specific thread and chatter. <br><br>As hS (way back when) put it, the structure would look like this:<br><br>quote<br>&quot;Fandom Favourites thread - hS<br>&gt;Lord of the Rings (nm)<br>&gt;&gt;My LotR favourites - hS<br>&gt;&gt;My LotR favourites - person2<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Hey, that sounds really interesting; tell me more - person3<br>&gt;My Little Pony (nm)<br>&gt;&gt;My MLP favourites - person2<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Wow, really? Mine too! - person4<br><br>etc etc. Where you don&#39;t just say &#39;I love Boromir and Aragorn and Legolas and Galadriel and Eowyn!&#39; but actually give interesting whys as well - and then people can, as you say, browse the buffet and comment on what they want to.&quot;<br>/quote<br><br>Have fun!</p>

            <p>It&#39;s another modern Sherlock Holmes adaptation. Ironically, it has received a lot of scepticism  (read: hatred) from the BBC <i>Sherlock</i> fandom for &quot;stealing their stuff!11!1eleventyone!11!&quot;, especially since the BBC show had been doubted prior to its first release by the fans of Granada and the ACD canon, etc.<br><br>(Some idiots still dislike the <i>Sherlock</i> fandom for being young and predominantly female; they think it&#39;s stuffed full of mindless fangirls who give Sherlockiana a bad name. Ignore them.)<br><br>Anyway, despite the initial scepticism, <i>Elementary</i> is actually quite a stellar show. It features Jonny Lee Miller (who, strangely enough, also played Frankenstein/the Creature opposite Benedict Cumberbatch in Danny Boyle&#39;s <i>Frankenstein</i>) as Sherlock Holmes and Lucy Liu as Joan Watson. Sherlock in this series is a recovering drug addict in New York City working with Captain Gregson on various cases. Joan Watson, an ex-surgeon (she lost her licence after one of her patients died), is hired by his father M. Holmes to be his sober companion. However, she goes from becoming a sober companion (which is really just a glorified babysitter) to his assistant on his various cases with the NYPD. <br><br>Most of the episodes so far have been procedural, monster-of-the-week sort of cases with plenty of plot twists galore which make each one worthwhile (as well as plenty of Joan and Sherlock bromance, of course). However, the most recent episode, &quot;M&quot;, reveals the presence of Colonel Sebastian Moran and, of course, Moriarty, who apparently killed Holmes&#39;s lover Irene Adler. That promises to take up a couple future arcs. <br><br><i>Elementary</i> is not BBC <i>Sherlock</i>. It doesn&#39;t follow ACD canon as closely (none of the cases are adaptations of the original stories), but there are plenty of shoutouts to the canon (Holmes is a beekeeper and quotes the canon quite often). <i>Elementary</i>&#39;s Holmes is also not as much of a cold deducting machine as <i>Sherlock</i>&#39;s Holmes - he&#39;s more human, even succumbs to emotion sometimes (and has daddy issues like woah). Joan Watson is also definitely not BBC&#39;s John Watson - despite the huge change to her backstory she still acts very Watsonlike, except she doesn&#39;t let Holmes walk over her quite as much as John does with Sherlock - some of the greatest scenes of <i>Elementary</i> involve a sass-off between Holmes and Joan.<br><br><i>Elementary</i> also addresses, more subtly, the things that <i>Sherlock</i> lacks - there are more characters of colour in <i>Elementary</i>, more addressing of racism and sexism, more rounded out female characters (not to say Molly Hooper wasn&#39;t rounded - but parts of BBClock fandom seem to really hate on their Irene Adler and Sally Donovan and sometimes even poor Molly. One of the biggest complaints from BBClock about Elementary was Joan Watson being not just a woman, but an woman of colour). <br><br>I personally would just love to combine these two modern adaptations together, so I can get both my canon adherency and my racial/gender inclusion. <br><br>Anyway, ramble over. Thoughts?</p>

            <p>and I have yet to catch up, but I do thoroughly enjoy this show. I was privately preparing for the worst when I saw the show, despite my willingness to give it a chance, but I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw. <br><br>I especially like the differences between this Sherlock and the BBC Sherlock; this is not a man who would be far less caught off guard by a naked first impression with Irene Adler. It&#39;s kind of fun to compare the two, think about what either would do in the situations that the other gets into. For example, one moment I liked was when Miller!Holmes admitted to knowing that Watson had lost a patient, but had refrained from saying it to avoid being insensitive. I&#39;m almost certain that Cumberholmes, especially at the beginning before his character development, would have bluntly pointed it out, insensitivity be damned. It&#39;s the little things like that that I really like about this show.</p>

            <p>Favorite episodes would have to be any with Gabriel or Balthazar. I&#39;m especially fond of &quot;Hammer of the Gods&quot; because wow look at all those great pagan gods.

            <p>Meg is just a really well rounded character; she&#39;s one of the few reoccuring female characters on the show, and she&#39;s basically moral ambiguity and grey morality and heel-face turns embodied as a person. <strike>Also she&#39;s hot but that really doesn&#39;t contribute to her character development because...possessing different people...</strike><br><br>Crowley because he&#39;s the sassmaster demon and I have a soft spot for snarky big bads.

            <p>What is Supernatural?<br>In short, it&#39;s a scifi/fantasy/SPOOKY series about two brothers named Dean and Sam Winchester who hunt all sorts of monsters. It also causes severe cases of feels traumas.<br><br><br>My favourites? ... I actually started watching it yesterday and have seen three episodes. But I&#39;ve seen enough of it on Tumblr to generally know a lot about it (same thing happened with Doctor Who). XD<br><br>Favourite characters so far are Sam&#39;s hair, Castiel and Charlie Bradbury. Sam&#39;s hair is very majestic and looks almost alive I swear (or I just have a thing for nice hair).<br>Castiel consists of giant amounts of fluff and that&#39;s already enough for me. Also the epicness. So much epic. I don&#39;t even have right adjectives to describe him.<br>Charlie is just flamin&#39; awesome, period. It was actually because of her that I finally started watching SPN, because the moment I heard &quot;LARP episode&quot; I knew I was done being in a fandom without having seen it. She&#39;s brave. Super smart. Supergeek. /Hacker/. Also sassy. Very sassy. I think I want to be her when I grow up.</p>

            <p>I agree, Sam&#39;s hair is truly magnificent. But my favorite characters definitely have to be villains (What? I have a thing for bad guys). Lucifer&#39;s awesome cuz he&#39;s Affably Evil, but not to the point of being good, and I like his interactions with Sam.<br>I also like Meg, because she is creepily gorgeous, and Crowley, because he is Crowley &gt;:)</p>

            <p>Late to the party, and I&#39;ve only seen the first episode, but hey, I might as well jump in.<br>My Little Pony blew my mind.<br>I went into it with an open mind, because I have a friend who&#39;s a brony and I know a fair amount of PPCers are as well. And then my mind was blown at how NOT little-girly it was. It&#39;s a show about sparkly candy colored ponies, yet I didn&#39;t die from sugar overdose. The characters are interesting and the plot was good, albeit predictable due the fact that I read the wiki page on it ahead of time.<br>And to contribute to the Luna/Celestia debate, I feel that darkness is always asssociated with evil and light is always associated with good, so maybe Luna felt that stigma. But I like how Celestia accepted her again, because you need both light and dark to make a balanced world. Sure, Celestia took over the moon, but really, it was Luna&#39;s job. Balance between the sisters makes for balance in life.<br>(Gods, I&#39;m going to get <i>so</i> into this.)<br><br>~HV</p>

            <p>You have been introduced into a world of friendship, magic, and NON-girlishness. Even better is, all you have seen so far is the pilot. You haven&#39;t even gotten to the good episodes yet (not they are not all good, but some are downright AMAZING). Might I suggest Return of Harmony, where Q-I mean, Discord, makes his big appearance, Party of One, Sonic Rainboom, Keep Calm and Flutter On, and Suited For Success for your next episodes, in any order. Or, you know, watch chronologically, whichever. If you want to look deeper into the fandom, look no further than Equestria Daily, the hub of all bronies. Art, goodfic (and almost only goodfic, though how good it is depends on personal preference), music, Tumblr ask blogs, animation, sculpting, news on the show, all of it comes to Equestria Daily. Equestria Daily: All the pony that&#39;s fit to print. (TM)<br><br>Since we are on Celestia/Luna, if you want to hear a good Luna turning to darkness song, look up The Moon Rises. It&#39;s really, really good, and shows some of Luna&#39;s emotional conflicts as she turned into Nightmare Moon.<br><br>Have fun looking into the brony fandom. It&#39;s a hell of a ride, I guarantee you, but it is so worth it. Almost all the members are the kindest people you will meet, much better than SOME fandoms (Not going to name anyone, but you should know some less then accepting fandoms) If you see something, be it from the fandom or the show, feel free to gush about it. I&#39;d be happy to indulge in some gushing with you.</p>

            <p>...is by far my favourite character from the show.<br><br>She&#39;s got one of the most adorable introduction scenes ever, and I really like the idea of a character that is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxQTOnwMu-U/">scared of her own shadow</a> normally, but still able to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYwqtylZjKQ/">face down a dragon</a> if she needs to. <br><br>As for the show itself, I&#39;ve watched the first season or two, and I think it&#39;s really well written. There&#39;s an ensemble cast, but they all seem to get a decent amount of time in the limelight, and the recurring parables of treating people nicely and how important friends are never felt cheesy or preachy to me. <br><br>And the fact that it has such a wide appeal outside of its target demographic would seem to indicate that it is at least 20% cooler than other similarly targeted shows. </p>

            <p>Only two this time, for simpler reasons.<br><br>First: Desert Rose, also known as that background pony with beige fur and a rose-colored mane and tail. She is adorable (i a bit airheaded) and she is modeled for my favorite lower: roses! Yay!<br><br>Second: Luna. She&#39;s the pony goddess of the night, she&#39;s the quieter, calmer, and I think the more composed of the two sisters (at the very least, her sense of humor is devious but harder to spot than Celestia&#39;s, and she doesn&#39;t gorge herself on sweets where little ponies with cameras might wander by). That, and she can dreamwalk. How awesome is that?</p>

            <p>BLASPHEMY! Princess Celestia has lead Equestria though over a thousand years of Light and Prosperity! When Luna wished to see Equestria fall to darkness out of jealousy, Celestia rose to defend the Equestrian ponylace, wielding the Elements of Harmony to send her sister to the moon. She lost her sister that day, and likely her only true friend, but did what was needed for her ponies. Since then, she has lead Equestria through their brightest age yet! Perhaps she is playful with her subjects, but she wishes for her subjects to laugh with her, rather then laugh out of a feeling of necessity. Further, Luna is the quieter of the two? PRINCESS LUNA, MISTRESS OF THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE?! (However, I will concede your point on Luna being more composed. Still, how would you react if Discord came back after you thought he was gone for good?)<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like Luna allot, she&#39;s awesome and all, but Celestia seems to get no love from our community. In truth, I am for the sister&#39;s ruling Equestria together, leading the land into an even greater age of friendship and platonic love.<br><br>Oh, and as for Desert Rose (I thought her name was Roseluck?) I must agree. She is a very pretty pony. In fact, she is a:<br>Picture Perfect Poneeeh! (link for those who don&#39;t get it: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDdL4z5qfr4"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDdL4z5qfr4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDdL4z5qfr4</a></a>)<br>Her design is very smooth, and is one of the best looking background ponies there.<br>(Um, World-Jumper? Dosen&#39;t that sound a little...)<br>What?<br>(You know, you sound like you think she is... VERY pretty.)<br>Yeah, her color design is very appealing, and is a brilliant use of colors for character design. What do you think I meant by... Oh. OH! No, no, I did not mean like THAT, you dirty little-<br>(I know, I know! Just, you know, checking.)<br><br>Now, my favorites. It is a constant battle between Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy. <br><br>On one hoof, Twilight is smart, bookish, a little dorky in a very adorable way, snarky at times, and often is the voice of logic in difficult situations (unless she could be... TARDY!). Plus she has a tendency to overreact, and while she can be the voice of intelligence, she is rarely the voice of reason. Her flaws are just as important to me as her positive quirks.<br><br>On the other hoof, Fluttershy is just cute and sweat, and the very ponification of kindness. She barely speaks above two decibels, and when she does... look out. She may be cripplingly shy, but is someone threatens her or her animals, she will break them down with a stern look, a talking too, and perhaps THE STARE, which she used to out -stare a cockatrice. Let me say that again: Fluttershy, the small little pegasus pony who would not hurt a fly, had a staring contest with a monster that can turn creatures to stone with it&#39;s gaze, to protect the Cutie Mark Crusaders from turning into cement, AND WON. Mostly though, she is diabetus-indusing adorable, and I love genuinely kind people- er, ponies. The fact she can protect herself and others when she needs to just makes her all the better.<br><br>In a later post, I will explain why I think the show is awesome! Because the Brony fandom is totally not one of my favorite fandoms and I obsess over the show way too much. You can never have too much pony. Ever. </p>

            <p>Luna had voice problems for majority of one episode as &quot;Real Luna&quot; and shouted as &quot;Evil Luna&quot; because she was the designated villain for those two episodes. Besides that, by &#39;quieter&#39;, I was referring to the fact that she very rarely says more than what&#39;s necessary - Celestia seems to favor a more roundabout way of explaining things, whereas Luna tends to say what&#39;s on her mind (or attempt to, when she isn&#39;t being interrupted) without waxing lyrical.<br><br>As for the jealousy argument, I&#39;d say she had a fair bit of reason for getting a bit piqued that her sister was getting all the glory - from what we&#39;ve seen in her most recent appearance, she not only brings the night but is also capable of venturing into the dreams of any pony she chooses, which likely means that Scootaloo&#39;s nightmares are not the first to be chased away with a bit of sensible advice from Luna. Yet as far as the canon states, the majority of the ponyfolk either didn&#39;t appreciate this or did very little (if anything) to show their appreciation - likely they took her for granted, since the only time they saw her was probably in their dreams. Celestia was a more solid figure who appears when everypony&#39;s awake; it&#39;s harder to take a pony as just something that exists when she&#39;s actively walking amongst her subjects while they&#39;re awake to appreciate it. I&#39;d even go so far as to say that many ponies probably even began seeing Luna as a pleasant dream sent to them by <i>Celestia</i> - particularly the older ponyfolk, if we follow the logic that some people/ponies tend to try to find more... concrete reasons for things like dreams and voices in their minds.<br><br>Speaking of Celestia~<br><br>Yes, she absolutely did what needed to be done to protect Equestria... But. I find two things very difficult to believe: First, there is no way Luna woke up one evening, decided on the flip of a coin she was mad enough to shroud the world in darkness, went Nightmare Moon, and was imprisoned... all due to the boiling-up of intense jealousy that took place in <i>one night.</i> There had to have been a build-up. We could be talking about <i>centuries</i> of nights spent painting wonderful, starry skies and guarding the dreams of others; of days spent sleeping and watching her sister received the bulk of their ponies&#39; praise. Which translates, I think, into just as many years of Luna becoming more and more jealous of her sister as time went on. Eventually, that built-up jealousy exploded, forcing Celestia into action.<br><br>Which did not, I believe, <i>have</i> to be the way things worked out, because the second thing I find very hard to believe is that Celestia could <i>completely overlook</i> how jealous her sister was becoming. Even if it <i>wasn&#39;t</i> centuries of build-up, there is no way Luna went from happy-go-lucky to BAM NOW I AM EVIL in a night, which I think means there&#39;s no way Celestia missed how unhappy her sister was becoming. True, the canon states that Celestia &quot;tried to reason with [Luna]&quot;, but Luna is not hot-headed. Not to the extent that her sister&#39;s reasoning with her would not carry at least some weight.<br><br>And, for that matter, why did Celestia apparently never do more than reason with Luna? Where were the requests to remember how important Luna is to Equestria? Where were any festivals held, parades led, or statues erected in Luna&#39;s honor? True, Luna works a full night&#39;s shift just as Celestia works a full day, which means Luna is most probably nocturnal (in other words, she probably sleeps during the day) - but that doesn&#39;t mean that she didn&#39;t try every way she could to garner some sympathy when she <i>was</i> awake, even if the only way to do that without irritating anypony was to dreamwalk. The fact that she is nocturnal <i>also</i> does not mean no celebrations could be held for her at night. Clearly the fact that most ponies are diurnal (nighttime sleepers) has no effect on how many of them are willing to participate in Nightmare Night festivities, nor did those shown in the pilot episodes seem terribly opposed to staying up all night to watch the sunrise for the Summer Solstice celebration. Would it have been terribly much to ask that they show the same consideration a night or two now and then the honor everything Luna&#39;s done for them? I&#39;m not saying Celestia should have forced her subjects to like Luna, but I certainly think more could have been done to share the enormous spotlight Celestia enjoyed even back a thousand years ago.<br><br>(Please note that all of that was not intended as an attack, and if anything came off as chilly or even a bit spiteful, I apologize. You hit my debate button. I CANNOT RESIST THE DEBATE BUTTON. XD<br><br>Also, do explain why you love the show. I want to hear~)</p>

            <p>*Comes out of lurk* A debate about Celestia and Luna&#39;s backstory makes me want to jump in! I&#39;m sorry, some of you here may not know who I am. I joined the PPC around mid last year (2012) but semi-left the place (I&#39;m still around on IRC) to concentrate on writing pony fictions on fimfiction.net around September 2012. So, anyway. Back to Celestia and Luna.<br><br>Regarding why Celestia didn&#39;t do more than &quot;reason with her&quot;, this is one of my personal theory (I think I have a couple, one for my story, one for general fanon):<br><br>- Celestia was aware of Luna&#39;s anger and resentment and tried to assure her over the decades but the situation (the common ponies still taking her for granted) did not improve. It&#39;s kind of like when you know a friend is in a funk but you couldn&#39;t do much but only assure him/her with words. Celestia couldn&#39;t just decree everypony to love Luna&#39;s nights, right?<br><br>- Combined with the dark magic Lauren mentioned in her dA comments, I&#39;d like to think that negative emotions draw these dark magic. The angrier/more jealous Luna became, the dark magic gets more entrenched until it reached boiling point. She tries to introduce some night activities and were rebuffed and the anger boiled over. By then, Luna refused to lower the moon until her subjects would even look at her nights.<br><br>- Celestia confronts Luna and tries to talk her into lowering the moon but it was already too late as Luna was no longer in a mind to even listen to anything. As the argument went on, the anger and jealousy, combined with the dark magic, turned Luna into Nightmare Moon and attacked Celestia. Eventually, Celestia had no choice but to use the Elements of Harmony to banish her sister to the moon.<br><br>- As for why there wasn&#39;t any celebration for Luna, I&#39;d say we don&#39;t see much for Celestia either. The only true celebration we saw was the Summer Sun Celebration, the rest were welcoming parties. I did read a couple of fics on fimfiction.net which mentioned that Celestia let Luna be semi-forgotten and Nightmare Moon become a caricature of horror so that Luna could return with a blank slate. Which I think is a pretty nice theory.<br><br>I apologize if I seemed to have come out of nowhere.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d never really thought much about Luna&#39;s backstory, just accepted her as the Designated Bad <s>Guy</s>Pony for the pilot, to give it some decent drama/conflict. <br><br>But yeah, you&#39;re right, she would have needed a pretty powerful motivation to try and bring about eternal night, and it&#39;s unlikely that would have been a snap decision on her part.

            <p>*cracks knuckles*<br>Alright. Let&#39;s do this.<br><br>Ah, so by &#39;quiet,&#39; you mean &#39;direct,&#39; yes? Alright, I can see that. I see Celestia as the more Public Relations type of the two, who likes to express her opinion in fancy, more round-about ways. Luna on the other hoof has a meteor shower to plan for next week, and an eclipse in three days, so let&#39;s get on with it, shall we? That and the fact she did not have opportunity to learn how to communicate well to the public, due to everypony being asleep when she was around.<br><br>As for Nightmare Moon (henceforth known as NMM) and Luna&#39;s turn to jealousy, I have a theory (WARNING, FANON INCOMING!) that connects to dreams and nightmares that could solve our problem, with some Word of Faust to back it up. NMM was not just a state of being Luna became, it was a completely separate creature or entity that took control of her, like Venom from Spiderman. NMM is the cumulation of negative emotions brought out in nightmares. Fear, hatred, self-loathing, and most important, jealousy. Over hundreds of years, ponies&#39; nightmares continued to feed the beast, infecting Luna with these emotions, due to being the Princess of the Night, and dreams being under her jurisdiction. The mass of dream-polution eventually created a personality for itself, and began to whisper in Luna&#39;s ears. It played off Luna&#39;s fear of not being loved, of being hated by everypony. It fed her self-doubt, making her think she did not deserve praise. It caused her to become angry at the people it told here was responsible for her not being loved by everypony, those ponies who give all credit to Celestia. It slowly, over a long corse of time, corrupted her, gaining a strong footing in Luna&#39;s mind so it could not only have a host, but spread these emotions through all Equestria. Once Luna snapped, and wanted revenge against those who wronged her, NMM replaced Luna in her mind, and began to cause not only the sun to never rise again, but to spread her Aura of Evil through all of Equestria. Fear would grasp the land, and the strength of Nightmare Moon would only grow.<br><br>NMM&#39;s plan would have worked, had Celestia not sent her sister to the moon itself, Luna&#39;s land of power and control, to slowly strengthen her sister, and weaken the grasp of NMM. Now that Luna is free of NMM, she is making sure it cannot rise again, by stopping the Nightmares at the source. That is why she appeared to Scootaloo to stop her nightmares, the TRUE nightmares of Rainbow Dash not accepting Scootaloo as a sister or mentor, and all the connotations that brings. As a seres of reams? Not too harmful, but given time and an ability to let the Nightmares take hold...<br><br>As for Celestia&#39;s lack of observation or intervention: I honestly think she did not see it as a problem when it started. Luna began to feel a little jealous, a little more mopey. Just provide some support and it will go away soon. Celestia spoke words of encouragement, prompting Luna to make the ponies know about the night by putting on spectacular astronomical events that can only be seen at night, wowing them into respecting her. What she didn&#39;t know was that she was feeding the beast until it was too late. Luna began to do more reckless behavior with her responsibilities, keeping the moon up while the sun is up, trying to extend the night, and so on. Now Celestia began to get cross at Luna. Why was she doing her job wrong all the sudden? She needs to do it right, darn it! Voices were raised, Celestia begins to see that her sister is not quite right and tries to stop it, but it&#39;s too late. <br>Poor Luna snapped.<br>And so Celestia had no other choice. She had to banish her sister to the moon, so Luna could build back her strength.<br><br>Could this have been prevented with more public recognition of Luna? Perhaps, but strong feelings of jealousy, especially those fueled by self-doubt and tacky purple tufts of smoke, find a way to ignore logic and blatant truths that point to the contrary. They will find those things that support their theories of the world, even if they are invalid. Basically, once it passed a particular point, it was too late for Luna, and it was not a problem before it crossed that point, so Celestia felt she had no reason to spread all this awareness for Luna that Luna did not want done in the first place.<br><br>Well, I think that about covers the debate aspect. Now, as for why I like the show. The animation is stellar, the voice actors are phenomenal and convey so much in their voices, the characters are strong and fun, and the show is funny. However, I think the biggest draw for me was a good cartoon who&#39;s characters are dumber than a bag of rocks, use toilet humor for cheap laughs (Spongebob, I look at you) or uses immense amounts of violence, sex, alcohol, and cynicism. This show does not speak down to any audience, nor does it have &#39;adult&#39; humor, but  humor I understand now that as a kid I would not know. I believe Bronyville decided that the show has very witty humor, to which I would agree and point out the use of several slapstick elements usually seen in older cartoons. The subtle references and horse puns also add to the enjoyment of the show.<br><br>Of corse the extremely vast, creative, accepting, kind, fun fandom helps too.</p>

            <p>I think I love Jane the best, especially when she impersonates Darcy. That first time she did it with the fake texting bit was glorious. And she&#39;s so pretty and sweet and dresses so nicely, and I love the bit where she becomes &quot;new Jane&quot;, because that&#39;s just beautiful to me.<br><br>Lydia&#39;s my second favourite; she&#39;s much more fleshed out here than in Austen and she reminds me of a friend of mine - really party-girl-like, yet still vulnerable on the inside, and I just want to hug her (especially given the falling out between her and Lizzie). Also, her antics are always hilarious. I just adore her.<br><br>Also, Darcy is an adorable dork. He wasn&#39;t exactly what I visualised, but he more than makes up for it in awkward adorableness. YouTube&#39;s right - he needs that pool scene, and stat.<br><br>I feel like LBD in general is doing for Pride and Prejudice what BBC Sherlock is doing for Sherlock Holmes - putting it into the 21st century, keeping everything relevant to the 21st century yet still giving shoutouts to the original canon and sticking by the original canon quite faithfully. It&#39;s given more depth to characters like Jane and Lydia, and offered a new perspective on the classic.</p>

            <p>Also, I&#39;m really hoping that Caroline hijacks Lizzie&#39;s camera, much like Charlotte did when she accepted Ricky&#39;s job offer. That way Darcy can shut her down and call Lizzie some modern variation of &quot;one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance&quot; on camera!</p>

            <p>In short, it&#39;s a vlog series modern adaptation of Jane Austen&#39;s <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, created by Hank Green of Vlog Brothers fame.<br><br>Much like BBC&#39;s <i>Sherlock</i>, it was a quality modern adaptation that got me to read the original classic. As an adaptation it&#39;s spot-on and incredibly clever, and the acting is apparently amazing enough that some people actually mistook it for a real vlog. The various costume theaters that Lizzie and her friends perform to compensate for the fact that not all the characters would realistically appear on a show that&#39;s supposed to be a young woman&#39;s video diary are side-splittingly hilarious. They seem to know exactly what to do to tease their fans, such as never showing Darcy on screen until episode 60 or so when he shows up at the very end, standing up so we don&#39;t see his face.<br><br>The writing is excellent when it comes to adapting a Regency!England romance to modern-day America, from minor race changes such as making Charlotte and Bingley (Bing Lee, rather) Asian, and Colonel Fitz William (ahem, Fitz Williams) African-American, to other character changes like making Lydia an unashamed Valley Girl partier and having Darcy show shades of being a hipster.<br><br>Thoughts?</p>

            <p>What is Star Trek?<br><br>The franchise consists of five television shows, eleven (twelve in May) movies, and a plethora of non-canon books, comics, and games. Most fans - even very devoted Trekkies - have only seen a fraction of these. The first TV show was simply called Star Trek (now called Star Trek: The Original Series, abbreviated TOS) and when it came out in the &#39;60s it was revolutionary. It was a sci-fi show that depicted an optimistic view of the future, with a United Earth as a member of an interstellar Federation, focused on peace and exploration. TOS focuses on the flagship of Starfleet, the U.S.S. Enterprise, under the command of Captain James T. Kirk, with the iconic Mr. Spock as first officer. The show ran for only three seasons, but gained enough of a following to spawn six movies and the rest of the spinoffs: Star Trek: The Next Generation (abbreviated TNG), Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (abbreviated DS9), Star Trek: Voyager, and Star Trek: Enterprise. TNG had a similar premise to the original, but had a whole new crew under the command of intellectual Captain Jean-Luc Picard (leading to the debate among Trekkies &quot;Kirk or Picard?&quot;). DS9 was the only series to focus on a space station and the only series to have a black captain, Benjamin Sisko. Voyager focuses on the adventures of a ship of the same name, under command of the only female captain of a Star Trek series, Kathryn Janeway, when it is thrown 70,000 light-years from known space. Enterprise is a prequel to all the others, showing one of the first Starfleet ships under the command of Captain Jonathon Archer.  Fans of the 2009 movie are encouraged to at least watch the Original Series, considering that that&#39;s what the movie is a reboot for.<br><br>(I&#39;ve probably rambled on <i>way</i> too long. In my defense, it&#39;s a huge franchise.)<br><br>My favorites:<br><br>My favorite series is TNG, but Voyager is such a close second that at times it surpasses it. TOS is good, but it didn&#39;t develop as many interesting characters as TNG and Voyager. Not that it it didn&#39;t develop interesting characters, it&#39;s just that only Kirk, Spock and McCoy were truly developed, while TNG and Voyager had large casts and recurring characters who were all given development. I haven&#39;t seen much of DS9 and none of Enterprise, and I can already tell DS9 is going to do the same.<br><br>On TOS my favorite character is Spock. Logical Vulcan, but with a human mother, so when he serves aboard a starship full of humans, he is torn between his Vulcan upbringing and his human side. This makes for a very interesting character. <s>And, of course, being attractive is a nice bonus.</s><br><br>On TNG I like Data best. Another logical type like Spock, he is an android. He is therefore inherently logical, but his creator programmed him to be fascinated by humans, so throughout the series he is trying to become more human. This journey defines his character, and arguably makes him the most human character in all of Star Trek. <s>And also makes him rather adorable.</s><br><br>In the Kirk v.s. Picard debate, I am firmly on the Picard side. Just listen to their voices.<br><br>On Voyager, Seven of Nine is my favorite. Yes, she&#39;s well known for being the sex appeal of the show, but she managed that while still being a really well-developed character. She used to be member of the Borg Collective, a mindless drone who killed thousands. Once she&#39;s separated from the Collective, she struggles to fit into human (well, non-Borg) society. Her journey is to discover her humanity, and come to terms with her Borg past. She was esssentially raised by the Borg, so she has to learn to let those ideals go or reconcile them with humanity. Very interesting character.<br><br>And then there&#39;s Q, a recurring character on both TNG and Voyager. My Little Pony fans will recognize him as Discord. A nigh-omnipotent being and &quot;next of kin to chaos&quot;, as Picard puts it, the story&#39;s sure to get interesting if Q&#39;s around.<br><br>That&#39;s what I like best about Star Trek: the characters. It&#39;s a sci-fi show, but its real strength is using that sci-fi setting to create thought-provoking storylines and quirky characters.</p>

            <p>There are so many reasons why I love this series, but the game that stood out to me was &quot;Journey of the Cursed King&quot;. It was not only my first Dragon Quest game, but also one of my favorites. Good acting? Check. Sense of humor? Check. Punny? Check. Fun to play? GOOD LORD, CHECK. When I actually beat that game after so many years my eyes were watering. THAT RIGHT THERE is an accomplishment.<br>Also, who doesn&#39;t love Dragon Quest&#39;s Slimes? (Well, except for &quot;Metal Slimes&quot;, but that&#39;s a different story.)</p>

            <p>Some of the blood elves and pretty much all of the pandaren. That&#39;s about it.<br><br>I&#39;ll explain the easy one first: I love the pandaren because:<br><br>1. They live on a giant, sentient turtle whom they clearly love very much and with whom they are able to converse at need (although the game makes it seem like there&#39;s a bit more effort to it than three or four hours of gaming would have you think...)<br><br>2. They don&#39;t seem like they have a very strict leadership - from what I&#39;ve seen in the starting zone quests, it looks like they&#39;re led by whoever the oldest pandaren alive at the moment happens to be. Even if this isn&#39;t true, there is an insane amount of respect for their elders that isn&#39;t readily apparent with most of the other races I&#39;ve played, and it&#39;s a refreshing change of pace to see that cultural element be so strongly interwoven with the actual game play (especially since, even with the tauren, any other race with a strong respect for their elders only seems to display it in the lore and very rarely in-game, if at all).<br><br>3. Pretty much their entire culture and belief system (as much as I&#39;ve seen of it, anyway). I love the &#39;hello&#39; and &#39;goodbye&#39; quotes they give you (&#39;Slow down; life should be savored!&#39;), I love their focus on the betterment of one&#39;s self as well as the protection of one&#39;s people (rather than, &#39;You or your loved ones? Choose!&#39;), I love how connected and ACTUALLY symbiotic they are with their surroundings (even Ji doesn&#39;t want to wipe out <i>all</i> of the hozen, which is why he directs his strike at their leader), I love how downright <i>peaceful</i> they are... I seriously want to live on Shen-zin su, now. And I&#39;ve only played pandaren characters for a total of eight hours.<br><br>4. They are so fluffy. So very, very fluffy. I&#39;m ashamed to admit I love them for their huggableness, but it is definitely a factor in how much I love these guys.<br><br>5. You get to punch Varian upon joining the Alliance. WORST REASON HERE, but you would not <i>believe</i> how refreshing it is after having to say goodbye to those pandaren you&#39;ve played alongside for twelve-ish levels and who chose to leave with the Horde - especially knowing just how awful the &#39;join the Horde&#39; scene turns out to be (as far as I&#39;m concerned)...<br><br><br>As for the blood elves, the reasons are a bit more complicated, mostly because there&#39;s a different set or each character. Fortunately, I only really have four favorite canon characters: Regent-Lord Lor&#39;themar Theron, Ranger General Halduron Brightwing, Grand Magister Rommath, and Archmage Aethas Sunreaver.<br><br>As far as Lor&#39;themar is concerned, I have lots of reasons that really focus more on his personality than on his actual appearance (although, uh, there&#39;s something a bit fetching about the whole silver-haired-and-missing-an-eye thing, and I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s the blood elven equivalent of a forty-five-year-old, so there&#39;s that...) Also, he&#39;s the only one whose good traits I already had written down, so he&#39;s the only one with a really extensive list at the moment~<br><br>To start with, <b>Lor&#39;themar</b> comes across to me as being very fatherly towards those he leads. From what I&#39;ve seen and read, he doesn&#39;t just look on them as &quot;his people,&quot; he really does behave as though he understands that he is their ultimate defender and is willing to do, in his own words, &quot;whatever it takes to protect Quel&#39;Thalas and its people.&quot; In my mind, there are few figures more worthy of respect and admiration than those who feel as unfit for their position as Lor&#39;themar seems to, yet willingly take on the mantle of the protector and leader for the sake of those people they claim as their own. Lor&#39;themar wants nothing more than to go back to the days when he was a simple Farstrider, yet he does not once shirk or shrink from his duties as the Regent Lord, and to me that is a powerful thing to witness.<br><br>Additionally, he&#39;s sensible. He&#39;s not just practical, he&#39;s not cold and clinical, and he&#39;s certainly not impetuous; he actually sees and feels what his people are made to go through, understands what they want and what they expect, and is able to see and choose what he believes to be the most reasonable road to walk at the time, even if that road is painful for him. And he tempers that with a rare (for Warcraft leaders, anyway) understanding of what others deserve, despite how he feels about what they&#39;ve done. Take his mission to the Quil&#39;lithien Lodge in &quot;In the Shadow of the Sun&quot;, for example: he went there not only because they were once his friends, not because he expected a warm welcome, but because he knew whether they welcomed him with smiles or blades, they were once his people, too, and they deserved to know that Kael&#39;thas had died a traitor and that the Sunwell had been restored. That takes a lot of courage, especially considering how against the trip Rommath and even Halduron were.<br><br>Combine that with the way he reacts to Aethas&#39;s request in Shadow: Lor&#39;themar carries the same anger as Rommath and Halduron, but Lor&#39;themar does not jump into an argument with anyone over what the Six could have or should have done, nor did he allow his feelings to sway his decision overmuch. Instead, he essentially left the choice up to his people: you can fight under the banner of the Kirin Tor, or you can stay out of it under the banner of Silvermoon. Considering the emotions and the history between the sin&#39;dorei and the Kirin Tor, I think he made the least explosive decision available to him, and I&#39;m impressed at how easily he picked it out... even if it was partially to get on Aethas&#39;s nerves. And he didn&#39;t waffle - he made his decision and he stuck with it.<br><br>As a matter of fact, the whole story in Shadow really showcases to me his ability to separate his own thought process into sections - to detach himself when he needs to and see things from his own standpoint and still see the bigger picture. He doesn&#39;t easily allow himself to be swayed by his own emotions - or the emotions of those such as Rommath - which I think makes him a much more reliable leader than, say, Kael&#39;thas, who&#39;s a bit infamous among the fanbase for having a somewhat quicker temper. At the very least, Kael certainly vented more passionately than we&#39;ve seen Lor&#39;themar do so far, and in my mind some emotions are better left controlled (as Lor&#39;themar does beautifully) than spoken aloud for your followers to hear (as Kael&#39;thas did once or twice even before he joined forces with the Illidari).<br><br>And, of course, there are tiny, less important things, like the fact that he&#39;s missing an eye and gives few - if any - indications that he even notices it at this point; the fact that he wields a kickass two-hander in one hand; the fact that he is the rare white-haired pretty boy who has not turned evil; and the fact that he was a Farstrider long before he was Regent Lord.<br><br><br>As far as <b>Halduron</b> goes, I love him more because he is able to act as a voice of reason when Lor&#39;themar needs to bounce his thoughts off someone; he very easily slips into the role of silent supporter (again, I&#39;m referencing Shadow here); and he has the ability to read Lor&#39;themar well enough to know when arguing with him isn&#39;t going to work (not that this necessarily stops him from doing so every time...)<br><br>Pair that with Halduron&#39;s hotter temper (I have to admit, where I dislike it in leadership roles, I love it in generals and archmages) and his ability to make what he believes are intelligent militant decisions regardless of what Rommath might have to say about it, and Halduron&#39;s an appealing character for me. I just wish there were more canon sources involving the man...<br><br><br>With <b>Rommath</b>, it really comes down to his loyalty to his people - even over the prince he very clearly would have followed to the grave, had certain events not taken place. My Country, Right or Wrong might be an irritating trait to put up with sometimes, and Rommath is definitely old-fashioned when it comes to the traditions of Quel&#39;Thalas&#39;s leadership, but he&#39;s an admirable character for it - even if he is as snobby as a magister can get sometimes. Plus, he has long hair. I live for men with long hair~<br><br><br><b>Aethas</b> is pretty much the hotshot kid fresh outta college, at least as far as the others are concerned. I like that he&#39;s got spunk, even if he is a bit childish in comparison to Kael&#39;thas. I also think he gets some of the worst rotten luck - not only do he and the rest of the Sunreavers get forcibly removed from Dalaran, but Lor&#39;themar manages to lose his cool just long enough to (essentially) publicly demote/humiliate the poor man. Aethas needs a hug and more fans. And then he and Rommath need to sort out their issues with each other so that they do not have to spend every minute in each other&#39;s presence fighting like cats and dogs.<br><br><br>I also have a bit of a soft spot for Magister Astalor Bloodsworn, Lady Liadrin, and Voren&#39;thal the Seer, but more than anything the only reason I even started to like them is because of wanda von dunayev, who is a demi-goddess of fanfiction writing.<br><br>I also have a soft spot for Koltira and Thassarian, but that&#39;s more of a fanon-induced soft spot than a canon-induced one. They make the world&#39;s most adorable undead pair...<br><br><br>/end book.</p>

            <p>What is Pokйmon? <br><br>It&#39;s a Nintendo-owned game that focuses on the adventures of you, a young boy/girl who receives their first Pokйmon and goes out to become the best trainer in all of the land. Each of the games&#39; plot is rather formulaic, but the inclusion of new &#39;Mons, non-battle related competitions, and crime syndicates in each generation keeps things fresh. The franchise is composed of the games, a manga series, and an anime.<br><br>Why do I like it so much?<br><br>The game itself can be enjoyed on multiple levels ranging from simply playing through the single-player story to building a team, EV and IV training them to perfection, and challenging a friend to a showdown. Some people even organise Pokйmon tournaments! As a not-very-competitive player, I particularly enjoy talking about team-building and discussing the strengths and weaknesses of individual &#39;Mons. <br><br>With all of that said, what&#39;s <i>your</i> favourite Pokйmon and type? I favour <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Glaceon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Glaceon</a> for its absurdly high Special Attack and water-types in general for their good balance between defensive and offensive attributes.<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve already mentioned them in another topic, but I guess I&#39;ll post them here as well:<br>Jigglypuff: This little pink puffball was what got me interested in Pokemon in the first place. While I knew Pikachu was from this &quot;Pokemon&quot; series, Encountering Jigglypuff in Super Smash Brothers Melee was a life-changer.n Besides, it&#39;s adorable and has it&#39;s charm.<br>Gastly: Cute, ghostly, and easy to draw. It helps that my first shiny I&#39;ve seen peronally was my step-mother&#39;s shiny Gastly.<br>And finally:<br>Missingno.: While not a &quot;true&quot; Pokemon, but a Glitch Pokemon, it still counts (Well, I think it does, anyway.) It introduced me to the world of glitches, can be considered one of the safest of &quot;Glitchmon&quot;, and is one of the few &quot;Glitchmon&quot; that can be caught without a cheat code. Oh, it also duplicates one of your items in a certain slot, so that&#39;s nice too.<br>As you tell, since I have a glitch Pokemon on my list, I like Glitch Pokemon.

            <p>From the looks of it, there are going to be a bit more urban areas in the game. Also, the dev team got their act together and decided not to make the fire starter another fire/fighting. It&#39;s going to be a fire/psychic, with the other starters being water/fighting and grass/dark.

            <p>As it turns out, there is no real solid evidence of what types the new starters will evolve into.  The theory of their types came about through seeing what move each of them used in the trailer.  The fire-type used a psychic-type move.  The water-type used fighting-type.  And the grass-type used a dark-type move.<br><br>So, this is all really just speculation at this point.  However, one never knows what clues might have been left on purpose.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Well, a poem that does not have anything to do with fan culture or the PPC, but since you like good writing, you all should enjoy it. It was written by a friend of mine, who is a fantastic writer and loves word-craft, seeing what one can do with the right word in the right place. Unfortunately it does not have a name that I know of, but here is the poem:<br><br>Once there was a girl who lived like grace<br>And when she was born<br>Her mother made her a box that said love<br>In it were pictures of very old houses and love poems and diamond rings<br><br>Her mother took her to church every Sunday<br>There she learned of love and acceptance and family and beautiful songs and miricles and met nice people<br>Mother said, &quot;I love you no matter what.&quot;<br>Her mother took her home on the last day of her life<br><br>And she seemed like ice to the girl<br>One day she melted and the girl cried and cried<br>&quot;Stop crying,&quot; Her father said, and he hurt her<br>She screamed into the pages of books so someone could know her pain<br><br>She breathed in love poems so that the stanzas may be trapped in her chest so even in her sleep she&#39;d feel the words, &quot;I love you no matter what,&quot; escape her lips<br>The books served no judgment and never hurt her<br><br>So her father took the books and ripped page from binding<br>She saw her screams on the carpet for the first time<br>For she had no more to scream<br><br>She lay awake at night protected only by her blankets<br>And she would talk to her mother<br>&quot;Hi mom, I miss you&quot;<br>She woke up at the age of 17<br>Her screams long gone and boys looked at her now<br><br>But she couldn&#39;t look in the mirror<br>She had forgotten what she looked like<br>But it was the morning of her birth that she met a boy<br>He talked of love and acceptance and sang her beautiful songs and spoke of miricles and family and he was very nice<br><br>He was born 17 years ago but she had died long before<br>For the first time she felt her heart beat<br>She liked the boy very much<br><br>She looked in the mirror that night and touched her cheeks and hair and lips and neck and felt like a princess again<br>She felt her mother&#39;s words in her throat, &quot;I love you no matter what&quot;<br>But it couldn&#39;t be true<br><br>So she swallowed the page with pictures of old houses and diamond rings and what dissolved in that place was love<br>She didn&#39;t want to believe there was somthing worth living for because survivling to get it meant living for more<br>For more than survival <br>And she had lived so long by the skin of her teeth that everything tasted of blood and wine<br>And in such a land as that of blood amd Merlot there holds dominion beings of sound and stone who speaks through the deserts and bleed mountaintops<br>But how can a creture who bleeds stone live in mortal form?<br><br>She thought then the boy was a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing<br>Wanting nothing more than to slaughter her sheperds and roam forever a road with a bloodied oil lamp where he might tear from the chest of an innocent her still-beating heart and with it in his hand say,<br>&quot;I don&#39;t bleed like you.&quot;<br>She felt that heart in her chest and cut<br>She could feel the words leak from jer wrist and it was very dark now<br>She felt alive again but her father found her<br>A stringless marionette who&#39;s puppeteer carried her in the strongest of arms but let her strings loose<br>He whispered, &quot;Please don&#39;t die&quot;<br><br>He prayed.<br>&quot;Lord please bless my child<br>Help her find the strength from within to carry on<br>Lord? Lord?<br>Please speak to me!&quot;<br><br>She heard a voice, &quot;I&#39;ll always be with you.&quot;<br>And she jumped,<br>Knocking her father back into the blood pooled behind him<br>She thought of only the boy and she ran through darkest and rain-soaked night to find him.<br><br>She came to him in tears<br>&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; He asks<br>She says, &quot;God lives inside of me.&quot;<br>She falls to the ground and he takes her about the arms<br>&quot;God lives inside of all of us,&quot; he says.<br><br>&quot;You can taste his word in the desperately desolate sections of breath<br>The quiet and silent and peacefull moments whee only your mind rumbles in your skull<br>That&#39;s where God is and it doesn&#39;t matter if you want him there<br>He&#39;ll pay for his rent through your kindness and when he checks in he&#39;ll never leave<br>But he&#39;ll be a good patron and keep your soul immaculate<br>So there&#39;s no need to cry because moments of silence and blank pages are God&#39;s words<br>And you&#39;ll live  in moments that seem never-ending and forevers that end too quickly<br>Because to understand the soul is to understand the end of forever and the forever ending<br>And you&#39;ll never understand, there&#39;s only acceptance<br>He lives inside of you and everyone who has ever lived and those who shall<br>Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Agnostic, Atheist<br>No matter what you believe or don&#39;t believe God will let you know he&#39;s there when you kiss a loved one, help a frend in need, laugh or cry or love or hate or scream or whisper.&quot;<br><br>Thus spoke the boy, he said, &quot;God bleeds the stone and from his wounds came the mountains.&quot;<br>She said, &quot;But who did God bleed for?&quot;<br>He said, &quot;He bled for us. God&#39;s skin shed to sand and his tears made the ocean&quot;<br>He leans to her ear, &quot;I looked into your eyes and I saw the ocean.&quot;<br><br>She felt his heart beat<br>It sounded like a church service<br>She cried and said, &quot;I love you no matter what.&quot;<br>She saw a clear sky and there were mountains <br>She thought the mountains to be closer to God than anything else<br>And on top of those mountains were beings of sound and stone who bleed to bring life<br>And those beings spoke to her saying,<br>&quot;We&#39;ll always be with you.&quot;</p>

            <p>Why do I do this? I double checked, I think I even triple checked, and yet I missed some typos. By the Nine Divines... I&#39;m so sorry to you all. I am trying to improve my spelling, and I know it does not often seem like it, but I am. The reason there are typos is because I only have a hard copy of it, not a digital one to copy-paste over to the document. I had to type out each word, and my device at the time had no spell-check, plus I am terrible at spelling, so I goofed up.<br><br>On a positive note, thank you. Unfortunately I don&#39;t see him often at all, but if I do see him, I&#39;ll be sure to tell him people like it. When I first heard the poem, he was reading it aloud. It is a beautiful piece for dramatic reading, and conveys a variety of emotions, so mix this poem with his deep, heavy base tonal quality to his voice, it was very moving. It was so moving, I asked him for the hard copy I posted here. I have read some of his other poems, and I know, if he does not get published and well known for his writings, there is no justice in this world. He is that good. <br><br>Thanks again, and I am sorry to you all for my continuing mistakes. I just don&#39;t know what went wrong...</p>

            <p>Hey, no, don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s not your fault if you didn&#39;t have a spell-checker at the time, and unfortunately, these posts can&#39;t be edited after they&#39;ve been posted. (Not to mention that being &#39;terrible at spelling&#39;, as you put it, is most definitely not a crime). It was still understandable and, like I said, very strong. I just thought I should mention the typos in case they existed in a different digital copy.<br><br>Ooh, yes, I can see how this would be beautiful read aloud. You&#39;re fortunate to have heard it :) Here&#39;s hoping he does get published, and well-known, and someday I get to read this poem in a book and recognize it! :D<br><br>Again, really, don&#39;t worry about the spelling.

            <p>Hello, PPC!<br>I am new here, but I&#39;ve been reading PPC stories since . . . hmmm . . . 2011? I&#39;ve read much of the Original Series, and I&#39;m particularly fond of the DTE, though one can find me reading any well-written sporking in a fandom I know about.<br><br>(Un)fortunately, I come bearing a possible badfic. I ran across this Cybercase/Pokemon fic:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7041683/3/Cyberchase-and-Pokemon"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7041683/3/Cyberchase-and-Pokemon">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7041683/3/Cyberchase-and-Pokemon</a></a><br><br>Centered text, short chapters and SPaG errors aplenty! I couldn&#39;t bring myself to read past the first two chapters! If someone can stomach the entire thing and give him some concrit, I&#39;d be happy. If the concrit falls on deaf ears and the PPC needs to be sent (this looks like a job for DTE and DIC), I&#39;d be happier!</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PPC at long last, you&#39;re very welcome here. Have a bag of pebbles and a Random Shiny Object.<br><br>Regarding the process of adopting minis, it can depend on if there&#39;s an active OFU or other adopting body for them. With the mini-Balrogs, for example, there&#39;s an Adoptions Agency which is run by myself, so I actively update the list whenever I see new ones (or they&#39;re reported). But other people just find minis from other fandoms on missions and have their Agents adopt them.</p>

            <p>It fell through, as far as I can tell. There was a whole set of badfics in PotC, Mulan and Little House on the Prairie - the only missions that ever got finished that I know of were my agents&#39; Mulan ones - and the original plan was for Araeph&#39;s agents to be along for those, too, but Araeph got snowed under with work. So I finished the missions I&#39;d claimed by myself, and everything else just sort of - dissipated - really.</p>

            <p>I have three:<br>Jigglypuff: This little pink puffball was what got me interested in Pokemon in the first place. While I knew Pikachu was from this &quot;Pokemon&quot; series, Encountering Jigglypuff in Super Smash Brothers Melee was a life-changer.n Besides, it&#39;s adorable and has it&#39;s charm.<br>Gastly: Cute, ghostly, and easy to draw. It helps that my first shiny I&#39;ve seen peronally was my step-mother&#39;s shiny Gastly.<br>And finally:<br>Missingno.: While not a &quot;true&quot; Pokemon, but a Glitch Pokemon, it still counts (Well, I think it does, anyway.) It  introduced me to the world of glitches, can be considered one of the safest of &quot;Glitchmon&quot;, and is one of the few &quot;Glitchmon&quot; that can be caught without a cheat code. Oh, it also duplicates one of your items in a certain slot, so that&#39;s nice too.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve recently been trying to freshen up on some nice old classics. A few days ago I picked up &quot;A Little Princess&quot; by Francess Hodgson Burnett. I loved &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; and so far I think that this, too, is a splendid read- splendid aside from the titular character, Miss Sara Crewe. Jadis in a block of ice, that kid is a SUE.<br><br>So how about some other opinions on Sara? What about some other Sues that you&#39;ve come across in the classics?<br><br>I&#39;m specifically fascinated by Charles Wallace Murray. Not sure if he&#39;s a Stu or not but... C&#39;mon, no kid is that smart.</p>

            <p>While not quite classics, they <i>are</i> based on classic fairy tales. Perfectly beautiful, desirable, all sweetness and light, Tragic Pasts, Twu Wuv, Cute Animal Friends, the whole package. The Sue-ishness might have had its roots in the original fairy tales, but Disney certainly popularized them, and many a little girl has wanted to be a Disney princess. Arguably, this is why some little girls grow up to write characters like that.<br>Interestingly enough, my friend on DeviantArt, who got mad when her characters were accused of being Sues - I posted on the Board about it - is a Disney princess fan, and when drawing her OCs in Disney style used the princesses as references. When she posted the pictures of them, she asked for critique, which I gave to her. (I&#39;m not sure she&#39;s listening, but it hasn&#39;t gotten angry and I&#39;ve offered to beta read any fic she writes, so hopefully I can stop anything before it gets onto the Internet.)</p>

            <p>The original fairy tales were actually quite grim (*rimshot*), but Disney took them and made them brighter and fancier. I wouldn&#39;t call them Sues as much as I&#39;d call them just shallow. There&#39;s not much to your average Disney Princess, and in the end you can&#39;t tell me that you (as an adult) watched the movie for the plot. We <i>know</i> that Belle gets the beast, Jasmin gets Aladdin and the little mermaid lives happily ever after with her smexy prince (okay, the latter is definitely very sparkly).<br><br>I&#39;m not denying that these kinds of characters are really really easy to Sue.</p>

            <p>The more modern princesses like Tiana and Rapunzel and Merida seem more realistic - yes, even Rapunzel, who has so many Sueish traits yet is still an engaging, sympathetic character.<br>Perhaps it&#39;s because she&#39;s so blatantly naive and obviously suffers from it?</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t recall finding them that annoying, but wasn&#39;t sure if that was just that it was a while ago when I watched those films, and wasn&#39;t too bothered back then about having well rounded characters in the stories. <br><br>But I finally got around to watching <i>Tangled</i> over Christmas, and really enjoyed it, despite Rapunzel having several speshul characteristics. <br><br>I think some it might be (for me at least, I can&#39;t speak for anyone else), that the Disney princesses and other overly special canon characters aren&#39;t going around upstaging people that they shouldn&#39;t. If I remember rightly from Jay and Acacia&#39;s missions, a lot of the Sues seemed to think that they had to justify their presence in the Fellowship by being &#39;better&#39; than one of the canonical members. If someone tried that using Rapunzel&#39;s character as the basis for an OC, I&#39;m pretty sure there would be a pair of agents waiting for the right time to do the Duty. But in her own story, I think she works really well as a good character. </p>

            <p>The whole sweetness and purity and light can actually work in a character as long as it is shown to be both a strength and a weakness. Rapunzel is sweet, but also horribly unaccustomed to the world. <br>All the Disney princesses have the same message &quot;Dreams come true&quot;. (Of course they do if you&#39;re a Sue![and that rhymed]) But Tiana was interesting in that her dream was not to marry a handsome prince, and she was actually <i>working</i> to try to achieve it. <br>And Merida doesn&#39;t get married, and the story mainly focuses on her relationship with her mother, which is some real conflict and not &quot;my mom is oppressing me! I&#39;m going to wangst!&quot;<br>So, Disney&#39;s improving. Woo-hoo!</p>

            <p>Accents from anywhere in the British Isles are cool. Music&#39;s good too. I&#39;m in a Scottish fiddling group, and I prefer it to classical. It&#39;s a lot more expressive, not to mention the way I&#39;ve learned how to make the fiddle sound like bagpipes. I&#39;ve played with a piper before. It&#39;s harder than it looks - they have so few notes, you have to keep adjusting to them. But cool, aye.<br>I don&#39;t want to go anywhere <i>near</i> the Disney Channel.</p>

            <p>While this device has no spell-check, and my spelling is abismal, in this particular instance I was trying (and failing apparently) to do a slight scottish accent.

            <p>Your transcription of a Scottish accent looked alright to me, but it also looks like it was supposed to be confined to your first line.

            <p>I tend to use Word whenever I&#39;m writing anything, which has a pretty good spellchecker, but every now and then auto-correct will throw something daft in to keep me on my toes.

            <p>was Giselle in <i>Enchanted</i>.  She started out as a very blatant parody/homage to the older animated princesses before being dropped literally and figuratively into the real world.

            <p>It proves the real indicator of non-Sueishness - character development.  Have you ever seen a &quot;Girl Falls into Middle-Earth&quot; plot where the girl learns and grows through her exposure to Middle-Earth? (Besides, of course &quot;Don&#39;t Panic!&quot;) Giselle, however learns from her experiences and changes. <br>(Now I want to rewatch that movie.)</p>

            <p>Thankfully, the writer is so good that the book is still entertaining despite Sara&#39;s Canon Sue status. It&#39;s almost like a literary experiment: If the worst thing in the world happened to the best person in the world, what would happen?<br><br>Back then, I think it was considered more okay than it is today to write about idealized characters, especially idealized child &quot;role model&quot; types. I don&#39;t think it was fooling anybody even then.<br><br>Charles Wallace... nah, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a Stu. His intelligence is really the one remarkable thing about him--he&#39;s not given a bunch of superfluous positive traits for no good reason. Sara, for example, isn&#39;t just kindhearted (the only trait she actually needs to have for the story to work); she&#39;s also beautiful, intelligent, well-traveled, multilingual, and a great storyteller. That she eventually does crack, just a little, is the saving grace of the story.<br><br>Charles Wallace is just unusually smart. He&#39;s also small for his age, often bullied, sometimes overconfident, and somewhat autistic--more of a realistic character than Sara. Real-life prodigies and profoundly gifted kids really can be that smart.</p>

            <p>I think you hit the nail on the head when you said Sarah Crewe was an &quot;idealized child &#39;role model&#39;&quot; and that it was more acceptable back then to write about idealized characters. The story was intended, at least partially, to teach little girls about how they should act, whether in good circumstances or bad.<br>It&#39;s difficult for me to admit, but... I guess she did at least have some Sue-like qualities, leaning toward a Purity or Sympathetic Sue (according to TV Tropes). </p>

            <p>Hm. You know, sometimes I think we should all introduce ourselves by our names and genders, just to avoid misunderstandings--I, for instance, spent several years thinking that Tawaki was female (I was reading sporkings, not missions). Imagine my surprise last week when I found out he was male! (...sorry that took so long, Tawaki...)<br><br>It&#39;s a pretty common problem, I think, judging from past experience on various online forums (RL interfering, that is). Hopefully I&#39;ll have my internet back soon...<br><br>Gee, thanks. How about I judge you a little, and you judge me a little, and the judging will cancel itself out somehow? :)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I was communicating with someone on fanfiction.net that I thought was a girl (I always assume female on ff.net because most fanfiction writers <i>are</i> female) We&#39;d have these long PM conversations about Star Trek and other fandoms we shared, and somehow it never came up until I misunderstood something he said and I said that to avoid confusion, I used emoticons. His response to that was something to the effect of &quot;I&#39;m a guy. I don&#39;t use emoticons.&quot; I stared at the screen in shock for maybe a full minute, then went back and went through all our converstions to make sure I hadn&#39;t said anything awkward. Thankfully, I hadn&#39;t.<br>So, yeah.<br></p>

            <p>Thanks :) I&#39;m just having a lot of fun being a PPCer (never thought I&#39;d be one, really, I didn&#39;t realize it was still so active), so I wanted to explain my sudden absence...but that&#39;s me.

            <p>It&#39;s interesting that Mrs. Eliot mentioned so many things that we still see today.  Looks like good reviews on bad works predate the internet!  And she even discussed how Sues undermine views of equality for women, something we&#39;ve argued as a community before.</p>

            <p>I wonder, what would they think of the PPC? Hmmm....<br>--------------------<br>George Elliot: You&#39;re work is good and all, but why restrict yourself to fanfiction? There are plenty of silly characters, or &quot;Mary Sue&#39;s&quot; as you call them, that deserve to be killed on the bookshelves.<br><br>SO: I understand, however we protect canon continuum, even is they have Canon!Sue&#39;s. Bad fanfiction damages those continuum, where bad writing just hurts our minds.<br><br>Mark Twain: Your point? If the writing is bad, then it should be shown for what it is, not allowed leniency for their crimes on the english language and reader&#39;s intelligence.<br><br>SO: I understand your position, but we have rules, restrictions. What is to stop an agent from &#39;fixing&#39; worlds that are not too broken in the first place? If there is an element they do not like, and they have the option of killing it, agents will take it.<br><br>George Eliot: I understand. Still, there must be something we can do to these bad stories...<br><br>Crow: Hey, Mr. Sunflower Face, we got a MST coming up with a really bad original story, wanna join in the torture?<br><br>SO: My name is the Sunflower Official, and I have far too much to do to snark a bad piece of writing in a theater with you three.<br><br>Crow: Meh, suit yourself Sunny Days.<br><br>SO (gritting the teeth he does not have): Sunflower. Official.<br><br>Crow: Whatever. Say, you two look important, wanna join us?<br><br>Mark Twain: What is this MST you speak of?<br><br>Crow as the three walk out of the SO&#39;s office: Oh, it&#39;s simple. Basically, you find a really bad piece of dreck, be it a movie, book, fanfic...<br><br>SO: *sigh* And I thought agents were bad. At least you can punish them for waisting your time, unlike authors.<br>--------------------<br>Hmmm, methinks someone now needs to make an MST with George Eliot, Mark Twain, and the folks at the Satellite of Love. That someone should probably not be me.</p>

            <p>I love how she touches on things that are relevant to PPCers today. She lists types of characters that we see today: Saintly!Sue, Princess!Sue (though she probably would call it Heiress!Sue), Brainy!Sue, and more. She discusses the &quot;drivel&quot; that is urple prose, and provides some amusing examples.<br>What really spoke to me was how she says that all female writers are looked upon as having the same intelligence as those who write the Sues, and I know that some people think all fanfiction writers are Suethors. She talks about how people give great reviews to those horribly written books, and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all seen the Suefic with hundreds of glowing reviews, and maybe one or two people saying that the character <i>might</i> be a Sue. <br>Awesome find, Lily!</p>

            <p>Welcome, welcome! (if a little belatedly) Glad to meet you! I&#39;m DawnFire :) (also new-ish)<br><br>You don&#39;t happen to be a Supernatural fan, do you? It&#39;s just, the way you worded &#39;killing trolls, sporking badfics, and exorcising Mary Sues&#39; sort of brings to mind the whole &#39;saving people, hunting things&#39;...I can&#39;t help wondering if it&#39;s a reference.<br><br>Bleepolate seems to be quickly becoming my signature gift, so here, have some Bleepolate! Enjoy the chocolatey taste as you forget the details of...well, whatever you&#39;re trying to forget, really. Also, some of Italy&#39;s pasta (he won&#39;t miss it), seeing as you&#39;re a Hetalia fan :)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>
