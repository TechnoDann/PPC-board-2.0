            <p>Right, I&#39;ve been lurking on the wiki for a year or so, and only just figured out where the board was. Electronic skills at their finest, right there. <br><br>And I figured I should introduce myself at some point. Helloou. <br><br>I like philosophy, english, most forms of writing barring the ones that I don&#39;t remember I don&#39;t like, and whatever anime, book or other form of media has currently grabbed my attention.<br><br>Fanfiction recently became a valid target for said grabbing-of-attention. Usually, I lurk about The Pit, generally, trying to find something worth reading. When you have a certain respect for the common comma, that becomes rather difficult, I have noticed. <br><br>There probably should be something else I should be saying here...<br><br>Fandoms! Recently, the fandoms I have been lurking about on have been Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Puella Magi and Neon Genesis Evangelion. (Which more-or-less has a permanent lurking-about on it.)<br><br>Right. I think that should be everything.<br><br>...<br><br>Do I sign this?<br>- TopHatOfDoom</p>

            <p>I must say, that was probably the most I have every seen of a response in any board-shaped community. Which is a good thing, I think. Well...

            <p>Welcome, fellow reader of fanfiction! It may oftentimes be hard to find goodfic, but it&#39;s out there, if you&#39;re willing to take the effort. Usually, I just sort by reviews then scan the summaries for premises that look good (a badly-written summary usually portends a badly-written story), but it seems that we <i>both</i> have learned some good ways to find goodfic.<br><br>But enough of that; you&#39;re due a gift!<br>*rummages through bag of holding*<br>Aha! Here, have a copy of <i>Anguished English</i>! All the technical errors of badfic, without the concomitant need for Bleeprin!(Really, this book is good.

            <p>I enjoy Google Translate.<br><br>Anyway, welcome to the PPC! Unfortunately, we don&#39;t have any fandoms in common, so for your newbie gift you&#39;ll have to tolerate this unrelated Dinglehopper. (Not a fork. This one has built-in plasma cannons, a kitten dispenser, and a deux ex machina button among its many lethal features.) A good tip for navigating the horrors of the Pit: find one story you *do* like, and click around in their favorites list. Then, if you like anything you find, go to that author&#39;s favorites list, and pretty soon you&#39;ll have a whole network of decent writing.

            <p>I had an idea recently that I figured was worth sharing. Has there ever been a time traveling agent? I came up with the idea for an Agent who experiences thing in a different order than his partner while looking at the Continuum tabletop game.<br><br>IE Agent A, then non time traveler, experiences missions in order.<br>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and so on.<br><br>Agent B, the time traveler, experiences those missions in a slightly different order.<br>13, 2, 6, 7, 1, 3, 11, 10, 12, 9, 4, 8, 5.<br><br>Does anyone else think that, if done right, this could be an interesting idea?</p>

            <p>Well, Homestuck did it pretty well with the trolls. That was just conversations spaced out over a lot of action, but a PPC mission would be as well. If you have an idea of where the missions are &quot;going&quot; and plan things ahead of time, it&#39;s doable. It&#39;d definitely be more work than a standard PPC mission, but I think it would be worth it to make a &quot;story arc&quot; involving a displaced agent.</p>

            <p>... for a non-PPC story, in which two people receive the same time machine with sixteen preset coordinates. Of course, since the buttons are in a 4x4 array, one person presses them in order for a phone (bottom left to top right, reading horizontally), while the other reads them down in columns. So they meet 16 times, but in different orders depending on who you follow...<br><br>I think it <i>could</i> work in the PPC. You&#39;d probably have to use a malfunctioning TARDIS to throw someone&#39;s timestream off (TARDISes are like that). The main problem is that... well, most people don&#39;t write that many missions. ;) Actually, the majority of written agents have... one mission (or even just an introduction). Obviously there are exceptions (Jay and Acacia, Indemaat, Tawaki, Laburnum, Araeph, and to some extent me... I&#39;m sure there are other examples), but they are exceptions - and I&#39;m not sure how well it would work if one only wrote two of the missions. Particularly since each one would necessarily be referencing others - many of which wouldn&#39;t have been written yet.<br><br><i>Time is out of joint — O cursиd spite,<br>That ever I was born to set it right!<br>Nay, come, let&#39;s go together.</i><br>-Hamlet<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>How would you actually make the receiving of their missions make sense? Do they stay in the same RC? If so, how? If not, why not? What makes B experience the missions in an order other than A (Not just &#39;time travel&#39;, but, like, &#39;B shows up on mission 13, falls through a plot hole at the end, finds themself in 2)? <br><br>I&#39;d be interested in seeing this if you could pull it off, but that might be too much of a chore for you to explain how/why the different timelines, and making things mesh like this can be... difficult. Does A know that B is a timetraveler? How does this effect A&#39;s relationship with B, knowing that what happened last time for A may be what will happen three times from now for B? <br><br>Again, the idea is good, the execution on the other hand may be more than you want to tackle for something like the PPC... </p>

            <p>... and fleshing out my &#39;malfunctioning TARDIS&#39; suggestion...<br><br>... would be to have both agents be without a partner due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control (and funny, of course), and for the Marquis to insist they take a series of missions together but not partnered. Precisely why he&#39;d do this is up to the writer - whim, I guess. ;)<br><br>Only problem is, one of the agents has a normal RC, the other has a TARDIS from the Macrovirus Infection - and in the incident when they lost their partner, the TARDIS was damaged. So after every mission, it wanders a bit in time, and lands back in HQ at a random point in the recent timeline - sometimes ahead, sometimes behind.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The way I&#39;d do it is through portals: the time-travelling agent gets irradiated with something or sprayed with something that won&#39;t come off, and every time they use a portal they end up at a different mission, more or less randomly. Thus, from the linear partner&#39;s perspective, every time they portalled into a fic hir partner would be replaced by a version who was trying to enter either an earlier or later mission (of course both would wise up to the fact after a few jumps (maybe through a time loop where Agent A explains it to Agent B, &quot;then&quot; a later B explains it to an earlier A)). Obviously, if this happened with EVERY portal it would just get unmanageably confusing, so either they can&#39;t use portals in-fic (which sounds like an interesting challenge but would probably just turn out to be really dull), or it only happens with inter-continuum portals (perhaps the traveling agent is sent directly from one mission to another even when (s)he tries to portal to the RC, and thus cannot access it?)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m currently working on a mission where one of the agents refuses to portal ahead (much - and the one time she does, the RC nearly explodes ;)). It actually <i>is</i> a challenge, but fortunately the mission is Tolkienverse. Since we <i>know</i> the geography, I can write about them hanging around in Rivendell, or hiking ahead to check out the ruins in Eregion.

            <p>Well, instead of portalling past the boring parts you could just skip over them narratively (which I really wish was a word), and then SAY the Agents were bored... usually we pride ourselves on &quot;show, don&#39;t tell&quot;, but I don&#39;t think readers would want to be shown boredom.

            <p>You did a fantastic job on these. It&#39;s amazing that you can create such sympathy for your characters in so few words. Very well-written and I&#39;d love to read more of your work. :)<br><br>The only criticism I could possibly offer is that they&#39;re both too short. Even realizing that they were flash fiction or contest entries of some sort, I&#39;d really like to see them extended. Like, did Angela feel any remorse about failing to protect Morgan? Does he die? And what happened leading up to the events in &#39;Visions?&#39; Why do the characters need masks? What is a Toa, anyway? Or the other strange names, for that matter? Just a few thoughts if you were ever to add on.<br><br>-- Len</p>

            <p>so yeah, they&#39;re kinda out of context.  I can tell you right now that, provided that I&#39;m keeping them in canon, all that happened after FOR SCIENCE!!!1 was that Morgan got soaking wet and really bummed out, and Angela was all &quot;oh my god you are such an idiot&quot;.  As for Visions, that&#39;s a BIONICLE fanfic written for a BIONICLE fanfic contest, so naturally there&#39;s quite a bit of stuff out of context.  For the record, Kanohi masks are necessary for Toa to function properly, Toa are essentially an entire subspecies of elemental cyborgs made for the sole purpose of being heroes, and the names are because, well, BIONICLE has weird names and stuff.  :P</p>

            <p>... I&#39;m a man of little wealth and less taste. More specifically, I&#39;m a college student, majoring in computer science with an emphasis on robotics- probably even that is a bit more than anyone has reason to know, so I&#39;ll just cut to the bit pertaining to you. I&#39;m an avid consumer of bad creative material, and those significantly less bad communities that deal with it- MST3K, Retsupurae, and of course the PPC. While I&#39;ve lurked about the wiki and mission list for a couple of months now, I&#39;ve decided to actually participate in the community, college timesucks permitting. Hopefully, my basic knowledge of literature and slightly less basic knowledge of hard science will be of use to the community. Maybe some day I&#39;ll bother to write a few missions of my own... but that&#39;s getting ahead of myself. For now, I&#39;m content to ponder the infinite garbage scow that is the internet with a community of like-minded people.<br><br>Regards,<br>AdmiralSakai</p>

Your good sense of humor and your knowledge of the materials makes me think you&#39;ll fit in quite well here. <br><br>Also, you&#39;re studying robotics, and my favorite Star Trek character is an android. Of course, Star Trek science is fairly soft (on a scale from &quot;feather bed&quot; to &quot;granite&quot;, I&#39;d say it&#39;s mud - there&#39;s some rock in there, but mostly it&#39;s just squishy and fun to play with), so I doubt it would be relevant, but still, robotics is very cool.<br><br>Gift…gift…Here, have a fluffy hat in whatever color/pattern you choose.<br></p>

            <p>Greetings, I am platypus. I, or rather we, are the collective intellect of every platypus in the galaxy. On the topic of robotics, could a conductive nanobot gel be used for an artifical brain? I&#39;ve made drafts, but would like to ask someone currently learning the field. Also, would brain cells grown in a nutrient fluid serve as better autopilots, because they can adapt to new circumstances?</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t see why not. It&#39;d basically be an artificial analogue of real nerve cells, so long as they were rigid enough to maintain connections (or had some means of long-range communication). Of course, such a thing is pretty far away from terrestrial science, so all bets are off. Just don&#39;t ingest it, otherwise you&#39;ll start +YP1NG L1K3 +H15.<br><br>As for autopilot, there&#39;s two types of &quot;artificial neuron&quot;: hardware neural networks (which don&#39;t currently exist and involve &quot;neurons&quot; made from transistors on a circuit board) and regular software neural networks, where neurons are represented by values in a very large mathematical equation inside the computer. This second type is better understood, and is indeed often used to recognize images, navigate, and learn. The Google Car is, at its core, a neural network. At the moment, they&#39;re really the only thing that CAN be used for a learning autopilot.<br><br>Hope that helps.</p>

            <p>So I came across this fanfic that has what looks like several charges, based on what I read on the wiki. Most blaringly obvious is Link severly OOC (possibly possessed or replaced) and using real world mannerisms and pop culture refences as well as Bad Pysch (in chapter 4) So my question is the author states that it&#39;s a humor/parody fic does that protect it from a sporking?</p>

            <p>Ah, I see you ARE new. Welcome to the Board! Have this bleen cloak. You&#39;d never know when you might need it...<br><br>~Autumn<br><br>P.S. You might want to introduce yourself in a more proper fashion. It&#39;ll do you good. <br><br>P.P.S. The fic you&#39;ve told us about is a good find. However, do check the Unclaimed Badfic List, the Claimed Badfic List and the Killed Badfic List first and make sure your fic isn&#39;t there before you add it to the &#39;Unclaimed&#39; list. Since you&#39;re new, I&#39;ll check it out for you.<br><br>P.P.P.S. (Ok, I have a feeling this is starting to get annoying for you.) Regarding your question, I&#39;m not too sure, because I&#39;m kind of a newbie too. I joined...I dunno, one week, two weeks ago? Anyway, I&#39;m sure a more experienced Boarder will answer your question. Have fun here!</p>

            <p>Overall, I think this is a fascinating story starter. The dialogue is smooth and clever, and I like the descriptions of your characters. I did find a few nitpicky grammar/formatting slipups, which I&#39;ve included below.<br><br>Other than that, I kind of got the feeling from the writing style that you were trying very hard to write in an imperious, intelligent voice. It&#39;s a style I&#39;ve noticed crops up a lot in the PPC, and in some cases not one I&#39;m particularly fond of. Frankly, it would be more entertaining with shorter sentences and a more casual tone. You&#39;re telling a story, not trying to impress a law professor. Ease up a little!<br>Okay, here goes...<br><br>&quot;Inside a large flying object miles above a larger planetary object, a conversation was going on about a population of recently developed apes.&quot; This sentence is a little clumsy. I honestly don&#39;t even think you need it at all. The next sentence is a perfectly adequate opening line, and inspires more curiosity from the reader.<br><br>&quot;...with one perched on a large block, and the other lay curled in a nest of tentacles.&quot; Should be &quot;...and the other lying...&quot;<br><br>Start a new paragraph each time there&#39;s dialogue.<br><br>&quot; &quot;But thats&#39; jus it hon&#39;rable...&quot; Should be &quot;But that&#39;s jus&#39; it, hon&#39;rable...&quot;<br><br>&quot;The pillbug waited for the statement to sink in before continuing. &quot;I think that these apes are a menace to galactic economy. If they can replicate our technology, then surely they can find cheap alternatives that will put entire planets out of a job.&quot; The nest of tentacles paled as it...&quot; No new paragraph before the first sentence. Paragraph break after &quot;job.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...we can fine&#39; out da apes secret...&quot; Should be &quot;...we can fin&#39; out da apes&#39; secret...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Its last thoughts would roughly translate to: Not the greys!&quot; Italicize the thought.<br><br>&quot;Meanwhile..&quot; Three periods, not two. Always three.<br><br>&quot;Far away from the planet that would later be known as Earth, a multi-fanged smile spread across the face of a reptilian humanoid that had been listening in on the conversation about the fate of the humanity&#39;s precursors.&quot; This is an unweildy sentence, and it would read better broken up and dumbed down a bit. Maybe you could sub out somethin along the lines of: &quot;Far away from the planet that would later be known as Earth, a reptilian humanoid smiled slowly, exposing countless razor-sharp fangs. It had overheard everything.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m sorry if anything I&#39;ve said seems inflammatory or insulting, particularly the bit on tone. I hope my feedback is helpful!<br><br>-- Len</p>

            <p>Ponystar has already done a good job of covering the SPG glitches in your story, so I&#39;ll not belabour the point, except for one thing:<br><br>It really is important to break up your paragraphs. Breaking for each new speaker is absolutely necessary, but you can also break for a significant change in the focus of the action.<br><br>But like I say, I won&#39;t dwell on that. Instead I&#39;d like to look at the story itself.<br><br>-The idea that &#39;humans are awesome because they advance their technology really quickly&#39; has been done so much, it&#39;s pretty much a cliche by now. I admit I&#39;ve not seen it with reference to <i>Homo habilis</i> before, but it is still a very common idea.<br><br>-Your aliens... aren&#39;t very alien. Okay, their appearance isn&#39;t bad, but they talk in sound, can communicate with each other despite being from wildly different evolutionary backgrounds, blush when they get embarassed, and one of them has a... well, whatever accent that&#39;s meant to be. I&#39;m no good at back-translating accents. They use the term &#39;apes&#39;, when they shouldn&#39;t really care enough to have given them a name. Oh, and they apparently have an economy almost identical to ours...<br><br>-The idea of &#39;if they can replicate our stuff, they can come up with cheaper versions!&#39; is kind of... weird. Surely if that&#39;s the case, so can the planets which would otherwise be out of work? And surely, you know, the idea of &#39;make cheaper things&#39; has been tossed about before in the last seven billion years? It happens on Earth - the usual response is either to employ the people who make them cheaper, or to somehow drive them out of the market.<br><br>-Related, the idea that a single planet could produce enough to drive multiple others entirely out of business is... well, it would require a pretty weird economic system in the other planets. Some sort of bilennia-old agreement that each world would make one product in strictly limited quantities, for example.<br><br>-I do like the idea of collecting brain scans - but I&#39;m not sure it would actually save the apes, since they can still be wiped out after the scans are complete.<br><br>-&#39;Xrvillian&#39; is an... interesting word. The &#39;xr&#39; sounds suitably insectoid (since it&#39;s being spoken by one, it has to be pronouncible by it), but the &#39;ll&#39; doesn&#39;t. Without any linguistic data from the tentacle creature I have little to go on, but I&#39;d imagine that the tentacle&#39;s name for its species would be &#39;Survillian&#39;, while the pillbug would call it &#39;Xrvikkian&#39;.<br><br>-I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing with &#39;Not the greys!&#39;. No, not the greys - you&#39;ve just been teleported into space.<br><br>-That&#39;s actually really bad health and safety right there. Seriously - what sort of spaceship is set up so that it&#39;s possible to teleport people from the bridge into deep space with no safeguards? Not a very good one, I think. How did these people survive seven billion years?<br><br>-Your &#39;reptilian humanoid&#39; is very, <i>very</i> cliche. Seriously - the universe seems to be entirely populated by Cat People, Lizard People, and Tentacle Monsters. Why not shake things up a bit by having a &#39;reptillian xrvilloid&#39; - a reptile which outwardly resembles a xrvillian?<br><br>-No creature except humans (and maybe dogs) smiles. Baring your teeth is not an expression of pleasure.<br><br>-And... you call this a short story. It isn&#39;t. It doesn&#39;t have an ending. Your &#39;meanwhile&#39; doesn&#39;t come out of what went before - it comes out of nowhere, and doesn&#39;t explain anything. I have no idea where the reptiles are going, or why. It <i>could</i> be an ending, if you worked it a bit. An idea/suggestion:<br><br>After the xrvillian is thrown away, stay with the pillbug a little. Have it think about how much it will make out of these apes, how useful it is to have such an intelligent xrvillian around - this is a good chance to throw a bit more alienness in, by having it decide it will need to retrieve the body to take a cutting for the next iteration or somesuch. Have it make some alien-seeming gesture &#39;gleefully&#39;, to rub in the fact that it&#39;s an unscrupulous critter out for profit at the cost of whatever it takes.<br><br>Then cut to the reptiles - and make it clear that they&#39;re going to take the pillbug&#39;s ship, and that the end result of his scheme will be that he himself is thrown into space while his ill-gotten gains go to the pirates. Don&#39;t actually show us that happening - it&#39;s redundant - but tell us that&#39;s the plan. That would give him his comeuppance and close off the story.<br><br>Sorry if this all sounds a bit rushed - it is, I don&#39;t have internet access for long. But concrit you asked for, and concrit I have tried to give.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>This whole story is my way of explaining the ufo craze. People report abductions by bipedal reptiles, and greys. Both are not very alien, and both are in the story. The pillbug and the Xrvillian are based off of two New Zeland sightings. Brain scans are my way of rationalizing why some advanced species would go through the effort of abducting humans. Also, this whole thing was meant to be a subtle way of pointing out how ridiculous the standard little green men are.<br><br>The &#39;aliens&#39; are merely an expy of many stereotyped space monsters. Also, the ending was intended to be interpreted differently by various readers. In my version, the reptilians are merely bootlegging scans of human brains, and selling them elsewhere. I also would like to say good job for catching the bit about a smile. But I would like to say that I never stated that it was showing happiness. <br><br><br>&quot;Not the greys!&quot; Is a reference to the Greys of UFO sightings, as I may have already said. The Xrvillian is thinking about what the greys will do with humanity.<br><br>No, brain scans do not ensure our survival. Fridge horror.<br><br>Sorry if I rambled on, I&#39;m recovering from illness, and the medicine is affecting my capacity for coherent thought. </p>

            <p>There are two ways to play with an idea, such as the standard UFO setup: to play it straight, or to deconstruct it. I don&#39;t think you really hit either of them:<br><br>-If you&#39;re playing it straight, you&#39;re relying on people realising <i>what</i> you&#39;re using. Assuming you don&#39;t want to just tell them (and you don&#39;t), that means you need to give them enough information to figure it out. You may have based the descriptions off specific &#39;sightings&#39;, but unless you show the story only to people who&#39;ve heard of those examples, it won&#39;t really twig.<br>--As an aside to this, your &#39;Greys&#39; line, with this explanation, bothers me, because it was the Xrvillian&#39;s idea in the first place! That would be like me finishing this post with &quot;Oh no! platypus might get concrit!&quot; - when I&#39;m the one giving it.<br><br>-To deconstruct the standard story, you don&#39;t necessarily need to make it clear what you&#39;re playing with - but you need to take the pieces and rationalise them. I think that&#39;s what you tried to do (Why would aliens abduct humans? Becuase they want to scan their brains for this reason), but I don&#39;t think it worked. I guess the reason I think that is that apart from the single idea, you pretty much <i>did</i> play it straight.<br><br>To achieve the effect you were going for, I think you&#39;d be best to set your story a little later. Don&#39;t show us &#39;Haha, now we shall steal the humans&#39; brains!&#39; - show us &#39;Well, we&#39;ve scanned these humans&#39; brains - now what?&#39;, or, &#39;Oh, hey, welcome to the Galactic Community. We might have a few things to apologise to you for...&#39;.<br><br>I guess what I&#39;m suggesting is, play with it. Humans have weird minds, so the aliens want our brain scans - great, that can work. What else can you play with? How can you take things from the generic UFOs and subvert them? (&#39;White? Our ships aren&#39;t white - oh, I see, your eyes don&#39;t read ultraviolet...&#39; &#39;Right, we&#39;ve got one of the apes - goodness, I didn&#39;t know they were so large and quadripedal...&#39; &#39;Okay, <i>real</i> human this time. Erm, where exactly <i>are</i> their brains...?&#39;) Just playing it straight as an attempt to highlight &#39;how ridiculous the standard little green men are&#39; simply leads to people assuming <i>your story</i> is ridiculous. It&#39;s a similar approach to &#39;I shall write a deliberately terrible story to show how bad badfic is!&#39;. Well, yes - but you&#39;re showing by example, not by analysis.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: The word &#39;smile&#39; denotes happiness or pleasure. It&#39;s not a value-less facial expression. ~hS</p>

            <p>According to our vague previous plans, there&#39;s a Gathering planned for Saturday 31st August (ie, 2 weeks from now) in London. Is anyone still planning on coming? Cassie, Irish Samurai, I&#39;m hoping to hear from you with definite yeses or nos; of course, anyone else is welcome to sign up too!<br><br>As to specifics of time and place: I&#39;m thinking 12 noon to about 3, 4ish. The place I&#39;m thinking of is <a href="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y148/Huinesoron/GatheringL05/02.jpg">this sundial</a>, which is right next to Tower Hill station.<br><br>So - anyone?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t come. It&#39;s going to cost nearly Ј80 for day tickets to London and back from where I am, and I just cannot afford that even with the extra birthday money. I&#39;m disappointed, I really am - I would have loved to come and see everybody, but keeping a roof over my head comes first.<br><br>I hope you guys have a good time, though. :)</p>

            <p>1)  I don’t know Nikki’s world of origin and the character she is based on, so if the reason should be found there, I wouldn’t know. I can only go by what she spelled out: “his determination about saving as many innocent people as he can” is lovable, isn’t it?<br><br>2)  I may need to reread the series (it’s not one of my favorites, because I’m only vaguely aware of most of the word worlds involved, so I don’t have vivid memories), but I seem to remember that Sergio’s past is mostly unknown or he told contradictory stories about it, not to mention the newest trailer. Sergio may have been involved in a war or warlike situation, like a secret service operation? Innocents were killed, specifically a young girl? Did Sergio do it? Couldn’t he prevent it to happen? Should she not have been there in the first place, and it was his fault that she was there? Yeah, this last one sounds most probable.<br><br>3) Is it annoying? I wouldn’t say I’m eager to find out what it’s all about, because I’m not really invested in Sergio’s story. But if I get the chance and have the time, I may give it a shot. <br><br>Now to me being annoying, although I’m not overly confident that my grammar is right:<br><br><i> He was like <b>one one</b> of those hot-blooded anime heroes</i>. I don’t think you made Nikki stutter intentionally?<br><br><i>The little girl didn’t have the time to come out with a remark for <b>his</b> partners</i>. Shouldn’t this be <b>her</b> partners?<br><br><i>The Unison Device<b>d</b> tried to recall the full name of the series, but failed.</i>. There is an excess “d” at the end of “Device”?<br><br><i> Nikki asked <b>to</b> the Nurse visiting her</i>. There is an excess “to” in this sentence?<br><br><i>”Why <b>I am</b> not surprised?” Nikki said.</i> Should be “Why am I ...”?<br><br><i>“Why <b>you didn’t</b> say that earlier?” Sergio complained.</i> Should be “Why didn’t you ...”?<br><br><i> “Interesting. What version <b>it is</b>?”</i> Should be “What version is it”?<br><br>The last three may all be meant to show that Nikki, Sergio, and Makes-Things aren’t native speakers, but they do use universal translators, right?</p>

            <p>And, at this point, I&#39;m pretty sure Wordpress messes up things when copypasting, &#39;cause when it was on Gdocs I re-read it, had three beta readers read it, and no-one noticed all of that.

            <p>For one who does not speak English natively, your writing&#39;s pretty good. I am quite unfamiliar with the <i>Madoka</i>-verse, but I was still able to keep up with the story.<br><br>However, there are a few spots where your English is off. If you don&#39;t mind:<br>1) You have: &quot;Judging by how the Unison Device fit well in...&quot; It&#39;s &quot;fit in well,&quot; not &quot;fit well in.&quot; Better yet, try writing &quot;how well the Unison Device fit in.&quot;<br><br>2) It&#39;s &quot;caught,&quot; not &quot;catched&quot;<br><br>3) &quot;Weight&quot; is a noun, &quot;weigh&quot; is a verb: &quot;Weigh much,&quot; not &quot;weight much.&quot;</p>

            <p>In fact, one of those errors (the weigh one) was one that I was sure to have corrected, but I probably noticed something else in the way, fixed that, and then forgot about the first one.<br><br>Weird thing is, Google Docs considers &quot;catched&quot; a proper word...

            <p>Yup.<br>Sorry to spam your Board with useless information, but &quot;IsaacTraver&quot;, that weird kid who tried to join this site but couldn&#39;t because he lost interest due to his inability to write nor have a wide attention span, has reappeared a bunch of years(?) later under a new name; &quot;BlockMechanics&quot;. It fits. Don&#39;t judge me.<br><br>How are you all doing? I hope this site is still kicking. Because any other forums I went to is mostly dead. Or prefers to ignore my contributions. So, I guess this is my desperate attempt at crawling back to you to help me from slipping into insanity by boredom. No offense.<br><br>I have no idea how re/introducing myself works anymore, so I&#39;m just gonna go unload any specific details about myself and my interests as a writer. I like deconstruction stories; stories that takes the whimsical norm and just pull it apart to the rotten core that it truly is. Another is the &quot;Coming-of-age&quot; stories, where the reluctant hero is forced to grow up and face the giant looming evil ahead for the sake of the future and himself.<br><br>Genres I like is anything with an over abundance of sci-fi, magic, or even the arcana. From the far future to the fantastic middle-ages and everything in between. Robots and golems and you get the idea. I&#39;m a huge New-Whovian (4th and 8th is best Classic Who) and I will be very heart broken when Matt Smith leaves the set this November.<br><br>All in all, I am rather happy to see this place still running and I hope I can finally pour what time I can muster up into this site and eventually start making ridiculous demands and become an obnoxious Boarder. Again, no offense.<br><br>Look, self-deprecating is the only form of humor I know! D:</p>

I&#39;m considering putting up a free-use chacracter in PPCverse, but I&#39;m researching.<br><br>I am now more on anime, such as Blade of the Immortal, Full Metal Panic, Ghost in the Shell, and a few other animes. I have no love for Doctor Who, sorry.<br><br>As a gift, I have an advise for you. Humour can also be gained by stating the obvious in another light. Such as:<br><br>&quot;Switching on the light? What do I have to switch to that is also on the light?&quot; Oh forget it, I&#39;m not good at this.</p>

            <p>Hey there, Aakmal. I enjoy a good slice-of-life story too. And I like some animes too. But I&#39;m not an avid watcher.<br><br>And I am sorry to tell you this, but Claptrap of Borderlands 2, who can&#39;t tell even a decent pun, can explain humor better than you.<br><br>... Too bad he still doesn&#39;t know how to tell a joke that just doesn&#39;t make you implode from the cringing.</p>

            <p>I realize it&#39;s likely that you intended humorous joshing rather than meanly insulting, but IMO, it&#39;s not appropriate to tease people you don&#39;t know well, since you can&#39;t be certain how they&#39;ll take it. You could end up hurting somebody by accident, especially online, where you don&#39;t have facial expressions and tone of voice to modify your words.<br><br>Also, for the record, English is not Aakmal&#39;s (or several other Boarders&#39;) first language.

            <p><u>Soul Savior</u><br>Canon: Soul Calibur<br>Author: Thaeonblade<br><br><ul>As the battle between the children of Sophitia approaches the climax, Siegfried now comes face to face with a terrible oversight in choosing Soul Calibur&#39;s newest wielder as his mistake gives birth to an evil far greater than anyone could have imagined. Starts from chapter 16 of SC V&#39;s story mode/new soul blade/appearances by past, missing or ignored characters.</ul>
<br><br>Rating: T<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8188316/1/Soul-Savior"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8188316/1/Soul-Savior">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8188316/1/Soul-Savior</a></a><br><br>My Thoughts: This looks like it has a pretty interesting premise: Patroklos becoming the villain of the story. There are some punctuation issues at the beginning of the story, but the author, Thaeonblade, has improved. However, I have a few issues with it, such as the gratuitous, but brief, sex scene between Patroklos and Tira in one of the early chapters(...this is rated T, right?), some of the characters popping out of nowhere, and fights that are just about to start before we get to the next scene.<br><br>While I find some of the things he&#39;d added in such as a bit of world history onto the Soul Calibur universe, I couldn&#39;t help myself if he would&#39;ve made it more interesting had he take a look at the New Legion of Souls Project artbook. It had some pretty interesting ideas in it.<br><br>My favorite moment in this fic is the beginning of the tenth chapter. Great way to draw in the reader, if you ask me. I&#39;ll quote it here:<br><br><i>To an outside observer, it would appear as though Hungary was overcome by civil war.<br><br>Hungarian, Holy Roman and Ottoman soldiers all fought across the region intent on leaving no quarter. Fields were razed to keep the enemy from using the grain, civilians were forcefully recruited or brutalized, caravans were raided for anything of worth and city upon city was burned in the blaze of war. No area within this captaincy of the kingdom was left untouched, a fitting metaphor for the war that was fought for the soil of Hungary.<br><br>Or so it appeared.<br><br>To anyone who had true knowledge of this conflict, they would know that the true war did not wage for the kingdom of Hungary, but for the souls of it&#39;s people.<br><br>What is believed to be a civil war was in truth a slaughter.<br><br>When Holy Roman and Ottoman reinforcements arrived to quell the apparent unrest spread by the &quot;malfestation&quot; of Graf Dumas&#39; uprising, they expected to face nothing than spears held by mortal men.<br><br>Instead they faced fearless and even maddened yet completely synchronized soldiers led by Graf Dumas&#39; successor. A young man who was believed to have been one of the Graf&#39;s holy warriors before he overthrew his master.

            <p><i>Because I have so much fun putting them together, I feel I ought to share the results from time to time...</i><br><br>Based on the traffic information for this Board, and on copying and analysing the front page (and, in fact, all previous front pages), I&#39;ve been able to generate a whole heap of graphs of various things. For example, the number of posts on the Board every day this year (up to the end of July):<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Stats/August%202013/PostPerDay.png"><br><br>Or, related to that, the number of unique IP addresses viewing the Board every day between March and yesterday:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Stats/August%202013/IPPerDay.png"><br><br>... which is going up! So either people are using more different computers during the day, or we have more visitors.<br><br>Based on that graph, by the way, and assuming PPCers use an average of two computing devices to check the Board each day (probably home computer, plus any one of work, school, phone - with some only using one), we probably have around 200 people who watch the Board right now. So that&#39;s cool.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Stats/August%202013/Pageviews.png"><br><br>This is the number of times the Board (front page or any post) was viewed per day, again from March to now. Spikes usually represent high-traffic threads, so it looks like we&#39;ve been quite calm of late.<br><br>Looking more long-term: in my processing, I&#39;ve gotten back as far as October 2011 (which is 1600 threads back - the Board archives go back 4710 threads to July 2008, so I&#39;ve still got a way to go). From then to this July, I&#39;ve plotted the totalmonthly post count (and my personal count per month, just for giggles):<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Stats/August%202013/PostCount.png"><br><br>So from 2011 to now, we have an overall increase, allowing for random spikes and troughs. Also, April and May are the &#39;most posted-in&#39; months - it&#39;ll be interesting to see if that extends further back.<br><br>Weirdly, my own post count seems to mirror the total, except for my drop-off at the end of last year. Quirky.<br><br>Finally (on the graph front) I created a list of everyone who&#39;s posted so far this month, which was 62 people, and matched them to the date they joined the Board.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Stats/August%202013/LengthofStay.png"><br><br>What that says to me is that essentially, people tend to drift away in their first six months on the Board. After that point, the roughly one person per month who is still here tends to stick around.<br><br>The &#39;Earlier&#39; spike obviously includes Very Oldbies, such as myself and Neshomeh, but may well also include people from September 2011. All it really tells us is that about a third of the current posters have been here more than two years (less a bit).<br><br>I also took a look at this month&#39;s top ten posters:<br><br><b>Boarder----------Date Joined</b><br>Ayane458------------Aug-13<br>Neshomeh------------Earlier<br>son<em>of</em>heaven176----Jan-13<br>Huinesoron----------Earlier<br>hermione of vulcan--Oct-12<br>Hieronymus Graubart-Jul-13<br>Outhra--------------Mar-13<br>Autumn_68-----------Aug-13<br>Desdendelle---------Oct-11<br>DemonFiren----------May-13<br><br>As might have been expected, a lot of the top posters are relatively new - six of those are from this year. But even so, that&#39;s a pretty decent spread. No, older Boarders don&#39;t post as much - but we&#39;re definitely still around!<br><br>And one for the Very Oldbies... as of right now, the front page holds about a week&#39;s worth of threads. At 25 threads/page, that means we&#39;re averaging 3-4 threads per day.<br><br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040714013002/http://disc.server.com/Indices/199610.html">Wayback in 2004</a>, we were pulling <b>15</b> threads per day. In <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060316160607/http://disc.server.com/Indices/199610.html">2006</a> we were still topping ten. It looks like the drop-off happened down in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070806192353/http://disc.server.com/Indices/199610.html">2007</a>. Does anyone have the faintest idea what changed? And, for that matter, guys: what in Arda did we spend so much time talking about?<br><br>And one final note - the Wayback Machine has near-continuous coverage of the front page for several months in the middle of 2007 - and again in 2004. Yes, I <i>will</i> eventually be adding that data to my stats (and mourning the inability to read the posts themselves...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I guess you could call it &#39;dedicated&#39;, though there were a few years when I did very little, and only posted a couple of times a month to the Board. But this year (or thereabouts) I&#39;ve gotten interested again - and when I get interested in the PPC, I end up writing a lot and finding new ways to play. The first time round (2003-2006) that led to the creation of DOGA and <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/Agents.htm">a whole heap</a> of missions, as well as the very idea of <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/">PPC Histories</a> (specifically The Reorganisation and Crashing Down). The second time (around 2008-2010) I delved into the future with <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndTitle.htm">The End of the Beginning</a> and <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/SunderingTitle.htm">The Sundering</a>, as well as expanding the Histories with Lofty Skies, and a whole heap of family trees. This is, I guess, the third time I&#39;ve gotten really into the PPC, and it&#39;s manifesting as (obviously) Origins, Flower-centric stories, data analysis for the Board, and (once I get them finished...) some pretty long missions.<br><br>It&#39;s a fun place to be. I just have to watch out it doesn&#39;t eat all my time...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I thought about putting the actual values, but, er... didn&#39;t? Anyway, it looks like our most prolific poster, Ayane458, clocked in at thirty posts (12 on a single day!), while DemonFiren at number 10 hit 12. Actually, that&#39;s equal to SeaTurtle and StormHawke, so it goes to show how little you can trust raw numbers. For the record, you had 9.<br><br>For the further record, the &#39;top poster&#39; totals for an entire month are usually in the range of 70-120. That said, in April and May, the top five/four posters all topped a hundred; in April, the top two were pushing 270. And that wasn&#39;t &#39;one mega posting session&#39; - that was sustained across the month.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Once again, some interesting data you&#39;ve collected. I&#39;m not sure quite why, but I think that the &#39;Unique IPs per Day&#39; graph has a very pleasing shape to it. <br><br>Of course, when discussing data trends and what they mean, it would be remiss of me not to mention <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PiratesVsTemp(en).svg">this graph</a>, which clearly shows the correlation between the number of pirates worldwide and global warming. Actually, the stuff you&#39;re talking about probably does have clear links, I just think it&#39;s an amusing graph and wanted to share it. <br><br>I think that little blip at March 2012 on the &#39;Current Boarders&#39; graph is me :)<br><br>I wasn&#39;t around wayback when, so I can&#39;t claim any knowledge of those times, but a couple of ideas spring to mind that might explain the declining threads trend:<br>1) Were there just more Boarders around back then? If the community itself was larger, then it&#39;d make sense that more new threads were being posted each day.<br>2) On a slightly more tenous note, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=240579;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this post</a> indicates that the IRC was set up in 2006. Is it possible that back in 2004 there was more general chatting going on on the Board itself, as there wasn&#39;t anywhere else for that to be done, and that now that&#39;s mostly moved off? This is possibly supported by a few of the 2004 posts specifically noting that they are Off Topic. <br><br>Also, while the number of new threads may have dropped from 2004, several of those threads only had one or two replies, and there are a couple that didn&#39;t generate any. While we may be having fewer distinct conversations than before, it looks like the conversations that we are having are more active. It&#39;s difficult to tell, because they represent different time periods, but at first glance the current front page <i>looks</i> more active (in terms of general posting activity, rather than just specifically how many new threads are created per day) than that 2004 one - to me, at least. </p>

            <p>I think your linked graph clearly demonstrates that the number of PPC Boarders is directly correlated to the number of pirates in the world...<br><br>To your two points:<br><br>1/ I don&#39;t know, but I don&#39;t think so. At least, I don&#39;t think the Board in 2006 was five times the size it is now - I&#39;d like to think I would have noticed!<br><br>2/ You may have more of a point here. The IRC note on the post you linked is actually dateless - I&#39;m pretty sure it was between &#39;06 and &#39;08, but I don&#39;t know when. But it could have been that far back. But... well, two response-points:<br><br>a) I don&#39;t think that much &#39;general chat&#39; went on on the Board back then. We had things like birthday announcements, but we still have those. And yes, we had off-topic posts - but they often (sometimes?) led to in-depth discussion. I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t know how things work in the IRC. It may be irrelevant, because...<br>b) We had a PPC Chatroom before the IRC. ;) The old Lounge was a wretched hive of scum and villainy, but it did exist. That said, you&#39;re right in that I don&#39;t think there was much of a &#39;chatter sub-community&#39; going (although... I don&#39;t know).<br><br>Yeah, it is a bit of a tangled web. You can&#39;t draw conclusions from raw numbers - heck, if you could, the spambot attacks (had we not deleted them) would be the most active time in the PPC&#39;s history! I was mostly curious as to whether there was something that sparked the cutoff - which may have been the IRC - and, as I said, what the heck did we talk about?!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hmm, seems like a very &#39;Sue-ish &#39;Sue. Good find! I agree with Ellipsis Flood though. You do have to check the wiki. First of all, you&#39;d have to ensure that this fic is not recorded in the Unclaimed Badfics list or the Claimed Badfics list or the Killed Badfic list. If it isn&#39;t, make sure it&#39;s recorded in the &#39;Unclaimed&#39; list and claim it. Then, look up &#39;Permission&#39; at the wiki. I&#39;m sure you&#39;d know what to do from there. </p>

            <p>Way, way (way way way) back in November 2003, when I had only been in the PPC a few months, I wrote a story entitled <i>Origins</i>. That story was a summary, attributed to Agent Dafydd, of the earliest days of the PPC - the Awakening of the Flowers, the discovery of portals and Mary-Sues, and the eventual arrival of human agents.<br><br>In the years since, I have written multiple <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/">PPC Histories</a>, covering most of the major events between the first agents and the ever-moving present. The Lofty Skies Insanity and the Mysterious Somebody&#39;s takeover. The Reorganisation and the fall of the DIS. The Crashing Down Invasion. But in all those years, I have never really gone back to the beginning. <i>Origins</i> remained as a summary, occasionally updated, sometimes missing entirely from the internet, never fleshed out.<br><br>Until now.<br><br>It&#39;s been ten years in the making, and builds on both that very first tale, and everything that has happened since.

            <p>This just makes the PPC and its mission seem so grand.<br><br>I love how the sort of vague meta-ness of the PPC - how plotholes can shape life, how the PPC is basically a Word World of its own - gets explored.

            <p>Even more than the other Histories, <i>Origins</i> was written to be an exploration of the nature of the PPC. I had to think a lot about what exactly the existence of plotholes implied - not to mention how to create them! A lot of the more fun parts to write were where something slotted in entirely by accident - the parts about Reality Rooms, for instance, weren&#39;t planned; I just realised I&#39;d written a perfect explanation for them, and slotted them in.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you liked Makes-Things - he was the character I was the most worried about messing up. I tried to use his brief appearances to look into both how awesome he is, and how he (started to) become the nervous wreck we know and love.<br><br>The Flowers, I confess, are one of my favourite aspects of the PPC. I&#39;ve been writing stories from their POVs for a little while now, simply because they&#39;re so unusual that it&#39;s a voyage of discovery every time. I like to think they had character development through <i>Origins</i>, but I know for sure they had <i>role</i> development - I particularly enjoyed charting a career path for the Queen Anne&#39;s Lace that would take her to the Postal Department, while simultaneously making references to her eventual position in Bad Slash.<br><br>Anya appears again in <i>Lofty Skies</i>, so you haven&#39;t far to read to find her again. Elisabeth I deliberately <i>didn&#39;t</i> use again (other than moving her, off-screen, from DBS to DIC); all I know is that she&#39;s not around any more.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>All that&#39;s known so far is that Anya and Elisabeth were the former agent partners of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Montgomery_Osbert_III">Montgomery Osbert</a>, back when Assassins worked in three-person teams, and they aren&#39;t currently involved in PPC affairs, since Osbert is the &quot;oldest Agent currently active&quot;, though he&#39;s been part of Personnel ever since he got too old to actively go on missions. It&#39;s not known if they died, or retired, or went crazy, or what, but Osbert&#39;s the only one left, and he never mentions his partners.<br><br>There&#39;s good story potential behind that, actually. The first members of the Department of Mary Sues, back before the need for Departments existed, and it was just the Poppy taking a chance on three human interlopers. There&#39;s still a lot of ground to explore there.<br>There are also a few ideas I had about the Origin Civil Wars that this story stirred up, since there&#39;s still a lot of space for what the main government of Origin was doing, what happened on Origin after most of the Firstborn left to form the Organisation, and the like, which I think could also make a good story.<br><br>I think what I liked most about Origins was that, while it does make a good story in itself, it also creates numerous spaces that other stories could fit into, much like how PPC continuity works as a whole. I don&#39;t know if that was intentional, but if it was, it was brilliant.<br><br>Wait. I just realized something. If Makes-Things was with the PPC since the early days, even before any other humans, but Osbert has been there since the early 1980s(judging by the rough timelines I&#39;ve found that may not be exact), how is Makes-Things still so young? I&#39;ve seen Makes-Things described as appearing to be under thirty before, but the 1980s were themselves thirty years ago. Is there something he created that slows down his aging? Is he secretly a vampire? Has he actually died multiple times, and each time is reborn from a clone that retains the majority of his memories, <i>Dune</i>-style? Or has he perhaps modified his body to become an immortal heedra with Nausicaд-verse technology? I just don&#39;t know. There are so many answers to a confusing question.</p>

            <p>One of my favourite things about writing <i>Origins</i> is exactly what you commented on - being able to leave those spaces. I actually really enjoy this episodic style of writing - it&#39;s very different to the single-narrative style of Reorg and CD. I&#39;ve always had problems writing the epic battles (most of mine consist of long conversations interspersed by little bits of narrative), so in this case I just skipped it. Origins was always about the Flowers, not the wars, anyway.<br><br>According to my master timeline, which I don&#39;t know where it is, the Civil War took place around 1975. Makes-Things&#39; arrival and the Cascade were in 1988, which means, with Makes-Things&#39; &#39;long year&#39; comment, that Elisabeth, Anya and Osbert arrived in 1989. That&#39;s the same year as Nyx Nightingale, who was recruited by <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/Nyx.htm">two unidentified Assassins</a>. They don&#39;t read like Elisabeth and Anya (who one could speculate were on a temporary assignment - but they aren&#39;t), so there are at least five agents when she joins - which means there&#39;s probably at least nine, with one team each in DBS (Anya, Osbert and Josephine), DMS (three unknowns, two of them seen here), and DIC (Elisabeth and two unknowns). There could of course be multiple others - there&#39;s no real indication as to how fast the PPC grew. I&#39;m going to guess that, once the First Three had proven their worth, the answer is &#39;very fast indeed&#39;.<br><br>Makes-Things&#39; age has fluctuated since he first appeared, pretty much. It&#39;s only blind luck that enough of us noticed the passing reference to him being (or rather speaking) Korean for that to stick; his age has never really been pinned down. I suspect some temporal trickery is going on, but as far as I know, it&#39;s never been addressed.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I had an idea for an agent who joined up in the &#39;60s (a fan of the original Star Trek), but since the PPC wouldn&#39;t have existed then I suppose she doesn&#39;t work. <br><br>Also, Makes-Things - when you put together &quot;ageless&quot; and &quot;good with machines&quot; in my head, you get android.

            <p>The PPC has time-and-space-spanning portal technology. They can send a recruitment letter anywhere, anywhen, so for practical purposes it doesn&#39;t matter exactly when it was founded. The fact that HST happens to mirror the Real World calendar is merely for our convenience, so we can keep track of when things happened in relation to each other. It has no real meaning in-universe, and even if it did, there&#39;s still nothing stopping anyone from recruiting people from times past. Nume fell into 2003 HST from 1976 Real World Time, after all, and I know we&#39;ve had people from ancient times, too. {= )<br><br>Re. Makes-Things, he&#39;s definitely a young man in the Original Series (&quot;cowed young man&quot; in mission 3, &quot;young Asian man&quot; in mission 4). That could put him anywhere from his teens to his early thirties, by my reckoning, so maybe if he was a young teen when he joined up in `88 it works out?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>(As the originator of the term HST, I can confirm that it exists solely as an authorial convenience.

            <p>I have not really been <b>in</b> any fandom, or in the PPC, before I discovered Harry Potter, but I <b>did</b> see (from afar) fandom evolve since the sixties.<br><br>Your imaginary agent, who seems to be about my age, doesn’t really need to have been in the PPC that long to have “seen fan culture at, basically, the beginning, and” have “seen it grow and evolve over the years”.

            <p>Or rather, past versions of the timeline - I think my original Origins timeline put things significantly further back. It would be delightfully meta for an agent to have joined up in the &#39;60s, then woken up one day to find the PPC had never existed - and then hung around for 20 years to join up when it did again. Well, actually that&#39;s not meta - the meta part is the explanation, which is &#39;because the timeline got changed&#39;. No idea how you&#39;d work it in, though.<br><br>(As I recall, the reason for the change was to bring the Flowers&#39; ages down a bit, so they wouldn&#39;t already be getting old)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You&#39;ve missed a trick for once, I&#39;m afraid. A fair chunk of Anya&#39;s story is covered in <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/SkiesTitle.htm">Lofty Skies</a>. For spoiler reasons I won&#39;t discuss a lot of it, but I will quote this:<br><br><i>Anya raised an eyebrow. &quot;You&#39;ve never met Elizabeth, have you?&quot; she asked. &quot;Seriously, a natural team we were not. She switched to DIC as soon as there were three more Agents to make up the team. And the Poppy&#39;s been trying to poach Osbert since he arrived. She called him her ‘ideal Assassin&#39; once.&quot;</i><br><br>Elisabeth, Anya and Osbert (in that order) were the First Agents - and they were in what became Bad Slash (under the Gladiolus, since the Lace was still in Postal). After a few more agents had joined, Elisabeth transferred to Implausible Crossovers, leaving the First Slasher Team composed of Anya, Osbert and Josephine. Not long after <i>that</i> - there&#39;s only about two and a half years between the end of <i>Origins</i> and the beginning of <i>Lofty Skies</i> - Osbert finally switched to the Department of Mary-Sues, and Anya and Josephine got a new third partner - Suzay.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It appears that I lapsed in my continuity recollection with the bit about Lofty Skies. It has been a while since I read that particular history, but that&#39;s poor excuse for not knowing the characters involved, especially since one of them is a significant part of PPC history.<br>The bit about the first Department to be formed and the order that everyone transferred out should be put somewhere on the wiki, to keep anyone else from making that particular mistake in the future. The way it is now, the little information available on the pages of the early Agents indicates that the DMS was the first to have members, and neither Anya nor Elisabeth/Elizabeth(which spelling does she use when referring to herself?) have pages that give anything to expand or contradict that. I will make several edits pertinent to that information myself.</p>

            <p>This was just something that I remember rubbing me the wrong way when I read it in Origins, and I just found out why.<br><br>In <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gZ2qzHkAqmJLBoX8bSpxIPkVcyeb5PnCsSOvUf36Voc/pub">Hornbeam&#39;s Tale</a>, Makes-Things is the creator of the blue effect surrounding the plot holes used in the portal generators, which was there since the beginning, but in <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/CrashPart2.htm">Crashing Down</a>, the blue glow was said to be added by a short-lived PPC Department as a response to &quot;disastrous incidents&quot; in the PPC&#39;s early days. That creates a minor intra-author continuity error that should probably be corrected. I&#39;d say it would be best to just change a few sentences in Hornbeam&#39;s Tale to comply with the Crashing Down version, since changing the Crashing Down events would alter a scene-critical plot point.<br>Also, the relevant passage in Crashing Down uses the phrase &quot;not, though few are aware, and intrinsic feature of the technology&quot;, which needs to have an &quot;an&quot; there rather than an &quot;and&quot;.<br><br>I hope that I have restored some fraction of my lost honor with this post.</p>

            <p>A lot of the scenes here are absolute home-runs.

            <p>I read this story, and as far as I remember, it was by Huinesoron, labeled <i>Prologue</i>, and posted under <i>Origins</i> together with <i>Origins: A Summary</i>.

            <p>Specifically, that <i>Prologue</i> was written by kgarrett, who&#39;s now Ekyl; he was going to write a full-length <i>Origins</i>, but never got round to it.

            <p>(and I&#39;ll probably get around to reading the rest of your history stuff at some point, now that I&#39;ve been drawn in by this.)<br><br>I was wondering about the chapter titles, which appear to be somewhat inspired by the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. I&#39;m pretty sure that was deliberate, so I just wanted to ask how close the correspondences were, having not read <i>Canterbury</i> myself.</p>

            <p>The &#39;[So-and-so]&#39;s Tale&#39; format is straight from the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, of course. Less obvious is that all the titles (Summoner, Shipman, etc etc) are the [So-and-so]&#39;s who occupy that place in the original titles. These titles were chosen for their relevance to the chapter and the characters in it.<br><br>As far as I know, however, there&#39;s no correspondence between <i>Origins</i> and the <b>narrative</b> of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. By which I mean, any you do find are clearly me being really clever and aren&#39;t at all coincidence. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Being that I have not done a lot of reading of Floaters missions, I am not that knowledgable of the Hyacinth&#39;s personality, so I would not suggest that you get too comfortable.

            <p>It&#39;s common to make mistakes when joining an organization for the first time. Since we have a lot of newbies at the moment, I thought now would be a good time to put this out there.<br><br>So these are important things to remember when joining the PPC community:<br><br>1. Read the FAQs. Specifically <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_The_Board">FAQ: The Board</a>, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies">FAQ: For Newbies</a>, and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission#Some%20Frequently%20Asked%20Questions">FAQ: About Permission</a>. Much of what I&#39;m going to say here is covered on those three documents.<br><br>2. Use proper spelling and grammar. We understand the occasional typo, or your phone glitching out, or not being a native speaker, but we pride ourselves on good writing, and part of that is making an effort to have good spelling and grammar. Plus, it makes you look smarter. :)<br><br>3. Don&#39;t post too many threads at once. Any questions you have can be asked on your introductory thread. Every time a new thread is started, another old thread gets pushed off the Board, so we try to consolidate threads as much as possible. In the same vein...<br><br>4. You don&#39;t have to post every badfic you see, nor do you have to start a new thread for it. We usually have a badfic report thread going around, you can use that.<br><br>5. Boarders are not agents. Boarders are people who post on the Board, who create characters who are agents.<br><br>6. You cannot write for the PPC immediately upon joining. You must wait to get Permission to write from a Permission Giver, and you won&#39;t get Permission when you first join. The criteria for Permission are:<br><br>- Having been part of the community for some time, long enough for everyone to get to know you. Roughly a few months, depending on your activity level.<br><br>- A sample of your writing. This is so we can make sure that you are a good writer. It would kind of be hypocritical if we claimed to be against bad writing and then had badly written stories.<br><br>- Agent bios. This is so we can tell if your agents are going to be Sues/Stus. Again, if we didn&#39;t, we could get hypocritical.<br><br>- A fic to spork. This should be last thing you worry about. <br><br>7. Also, you don&#39;t need to have Permission to have a good time in this community. Some people wait years, or never get it at all!<br><br><br>I hope this was informative. If I didn&#39;t welcome you, welcome, and I hope you have fun here!</p>

            <p>I remember reading somewhere (I could drag up the link if anyone&#39;s interested) that people using software will often completely ignore anything that doesn&#39;t look like it will help with what they&#39;re trying to do. For example, if someone wants to make a new post, they&#39;ll zero in on the &quot;New Post&quot; button and just not notice (SEP-field style) the <b>READ THIS FIRST</b> bits, even if they&#39;re in 72 point blinking neon Urple. This doesn&#39;t apply to all users, of course, but it&#39;s a trend that I&#39;ve seen pointed out a few times.<br><br>One of the solutions to the not-reading problem I&#39;ve heard of is to to have the body text box in someone&#39;s first post start out populated with a &quot;Did you read the important stuff like the Constitution?&quot; instead of being blank. We can&#39;t really do that with our current software (note to self: do something like that to T-Board when I&#39;m less busy, so I&#39;m nut sure what we can do with what I just brought up. <br></p>

            <p>What I mean is, yes, the Board is software, but it&#39;s also a place and a group of people. To me it just seems like common sense to learn what the group&#39;s rules are before jumping in, so it completely baffles me that anyone wouldn&#39;t deliberately go looking for that kind of information. Like, if you were going to go to a new club, wouldn&#39;t you find out what the dress code, prices, and hours of operation are? So, how does the SEP effect come into play then, and what (if anything) can be done about it?<br><br>Plus, this particular group is devoted to promoting good writing and making funny stories about bad writing, on the Internet, which naturally should involve lots of reading. The avoidance of reading under these circumstances just does not compute in my head.<br><br>~Neshomeh, flummoxed.</p>

            <p>, as you said, dictates that all new people <i>should</i> read the introductory stuff before jumping in. In (as I&#39;ve seen it) reality, some newbies do do the reading (I think I did, before I made my intro post), while many others don&#39;t, and just barrel off the high dive wearing a jetpack. The people who don&#39;t read intro things here might do similar things in real life (&quot;Oh, this place is closed already? Darn.

            <p>Since that character hasn&#39;t been around since 2009, the mission would either need to be set that far in the past or slightly retcon Tadkeeta&#39;s history. Either way might work though, since working in the past might be fun, and blowing up the Naga Eyes world wouldn&#39;t be the only time Tadkeeta got to torch a bleepfic, so it wouldn&#39;t be depriving her of the experience. If we do retcon Tadkeeta out of the event, there should still be someone torching the place, because just from the badfic&#39;s summary on the wiki, I can tell we would not want to take chances with it.</p>

            <p>I checked over Tawaki&#39;s stories after sending that that post, and it never actually says in any capacity that Tadkeeta torched the Naga Eyes world. Not even a passing reference. It seems to be something that was just added onto the wiki, to use a phrase, apropos of nothing. Would it even <i>be</i> retconning in that case if the events never actually occurred in-continuity? I&#39;m not being rhetorical there; that was a legitimate question. The section about pounding &quot;voreland&quot; into glass was there since the page was created, but it wasn&#39;t based on anything that happened in any story and has never been referenced before or since, so would it have actually happened?<br><br>As for the official Permission bit, it wouldn&#39;t be me doing the retconning anyway. I usually prefer working around existing events rather than reshaping them to fit what I was trying to do, because reshaping past events just seems like it&#39;s being rude both to the events and the people who wrote those events. Plus, missions set in the past would be fun.</p>

            <p>The original introduction of the Sun Crushers took place in a <i>Multiverse Monitor</i> article, so I&#39;d start looking there for more information. Failing that, it&#39;s possible it was mentioned in someone else&#39;s spinoff, or a Board discussion, or something. I guess you can&#39;t retcon things that never actually happened, but in this case I don&#39;t think we should be convinced that it didn&#39;t without a good bit more digging.

            <p>I was going to state the issues with this entry post, but doctorlit already did that, and in a much more concise manner than I was going to, so I&#39;ll just say one thing about the long list of departments.<br><br>If you want to take on missions of all of those categories, we have a Department of Floaters for that, but if you want to specialize, you can only pick one. If you do want to run missions for Bad Roleplay or Despatch, then specializing in one of those two might be best out of the list, because we have had very few people over the years with an interest in those Departments, and it would be good to see them worked with again.<br>Actually, that might have been two things, depending on how one looks at it, but that&#39;s not important right now.<br><br>What do you mean by &quot;his comic&#39;s canon&quot;, by the way? Is Kyo Osamu native to a pre-existing canon work, or migrate from a webcomic you contributed to, or something of the sort? That will need to be clarified if you want to write for him here.<br><br>Well, either way, welcome to the PPC! Have a box of Duplic-Os! The only cereal that reproduces by budding!</p>

            <p>Well not exactly.<br>I haven&#39;t posted my comic on DeviantART yet, but I do have designs for him and his friends.<br><br>And Ok, with the department issues, I&#39;ll shorten it to just Despatch and Mary sues. Two is better then four. Less complicated and less overpowered.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think you quite caught up with the Department issue; an Agent is assigned to <i>one</i> Department at a time, no more.<br><br>I can see you&#39;re quite excited to get stuck in - that&#39;s a good thing, we love people who want to get involved. And wanting your Agent to try lots of different areas is cool. But I do think you&#39;re charging in a bit too fast and trying to do too much at once.<br><br>Put your Agent in Despatch first, if you like, and after a mission or two he can transfer to Mary-Sues for whatever reason the Flowers give. Or the other way round, and he can go switching Departments every couple of weeks or the like. (I wouldn&#39;t recommend it, it can get a bit confusing, but if it works for you, that&#39;s shiny.)<br><br>- Cassie</p>

            <p>Now, I shall make like a Beverly Hillbilly and invite you to take your shoes off, and stay a while.  Writing in the PPC universe that Jay and Acacia created requires permission from one of our longer-running members, but they don&#39;t give it to total strangers.  This is a community, and we like to see new people stick around for at least a month or two before asking for permission.  During that time, you should participate in discussion threads, writing games and other examples of &quot;hanging out;&quot; this lets the permission givers have a chance to get to know you and determine your writing ability.<br><br>More information can be found by reading these articles:<br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission</a></a><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ%3A_For_Newbies"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ%3A_For_Newbies">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ%3A_For_Newbies</a></a><br><br>Additionally, I&#39;d like to point out that PPC agents can only be assigned to one department at a time.  Agents do, however, sometimes get assigned missions outside their department&#39;s ordinary purview, as punishment for screwing up, or simply because of that agent pair&#39;s areas of expertise.<br><br>I look forward to seeing you around, Kyo.

            <p>Hey my roomate a huge avatar: the last airbender fan. Mentioned a fanfic called &quot;How I became yours&quot; a Zuko/Katara fic which is infamous in the fanbase as an example of what not to do when writing a fic. I want to know has anyone heard of this fic or known if it&#39;s been the subject of a mission?</p>

            <p>...but you could always browse through the Claimed Badfic and Killed Badfic lists to find out. The only problem I could see with sporking a fic that has become an example that way is that it has probably been MST&#39;d so many times already that it wouldn&#39;t be anything new. Then again, that may not be the case with this fic. I&#39;m speaking only from experiences in other fandoms.<br>But if it hasn&#39;t been claimed or killed already, you&#39;re up for that kind of challenge, and it hasn&#39;t already had all of the snarking potential sucked out of it by previous MSTers, I&#39;d say go for it!<br><br>-- Len</p>

            <p>I actually have no problem with this pairing.  <br><br>Had Zuko not gone over to Azula&#39;s side in Ba Sing Se, it could have happened.  In fact, I thought that&#39;s where it was going.  I knew Zuko needed to join the Avatar and that would have been a good time.  In his conversation with Katara, he managed to break through her hatred and form a rapport with her.  She even goes so far as to offer to use her Water-Of-Heal-Everything to fix his scar.  That is not something she would do lightly.  The reason Katara felt so betrayed later in the episode was because she had made a strong connection to Zuko through their shared hardships, and he threw it away.  She felt so betrayed that she actually hated him more in the final season than she had before.  Had there been nothing there (I admit that a budding romance is not the only option, but it is an option), she would not have hated him so much.<br><br>So, there you go.

            <p>I have not gotten to the point where I look for badfic yet. In general, I look for fanfic in continua that ended in cliffhangers (e.g. Animorphs); continua that are open to new stories (e.g. Phoenix Wright); or continua that have yet to have a new addition to the series, thus opening the floodgates of imagination as to what the new edition will/should look like (e.g., Kingdom Hearts until recently).<br><br>So, long-winded explanation aside, no, I have not seen A:TLA shipping.

            <p>It would&#39;ve been my tenth mission with my Floaters RC.<br><br>The problem is... I just couldn&#39;t make it funny. The only things that&#39;re really objectively horrible about this fic are Big Mac&#39;s OOCness and the fact that it&#39;s just so wrong. Just those two things alone aren&#39;t enough to justify a mission, and it&#39;s even harder to do it considering that some of the things there are kinda sick and it&#39;s hard to make comedy out of the subject matter involved without grossly trivializing it.<br><br>So... in my opinion, this is a mission-proof fic. I dunno...</p>

            <p>And as for the Cupcakes mission, that at <i>least</i> had more to work with given its infamous history and some of the fan writings surrounding it. You couldn&#39;t make it funny per se, but you could at least get <i>something</i> out of it that wasn&#39;t a straight-up MST or a mission that entirely detailed horrified reactions. SAM doesn&#39;t even have <i>that</i>.</p>

            <p>Hello, everyone!  As some of you know, I am involved in a gaming and anime convention that is run by the college I attended.  Well, it is time for me to plug that convention again!  Only this time, there are almost 6 months between now and then, to make potential travel easier to plan.<br><br>So, without further ado: <a href="http://www.almaconmi.com/index.php">AlmaCon!</a><br><br>Now, in my mind, the biggest points of interest are LittleKuriboh (YuGiOh Abridged) and Doug Walker (The Nostalgia Critic).  However, if you watch any English dubbed anime, we have several prominent American voice actors in the line-up, as well.<br><br>The Con takes place in Alma, MI on February 7th-9th.  It is gonna be a good time and I hope that some of you can join me and Neshomeh there.<br><br>Let me know if you have questions, comments, or concerns.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I am not left-handed!<br><br>... wait, no - it was the other thing.<br><br>According to the map in the company meeting room, they do actually do a fair bit round that kind of area (although I&#39;ve got no idea what scale that map was to, so that could still translate to several hundred miles away). <br><br>They actually use a manufacturing company across the border in Cananda, so people have to visit that fairly frequently. According to Google maps that&#39;s only 250 miles away from Alma College.  Yeah, OK, 250 miles is still a fair distance, but I figure if I&#39;ve already flown a few <i>thousand</i> it wouldn&#39;t exactly be much of a detour. <br><br>If I can convince my company to fly me out sometime round the Con I&#39;ll certainly see if I can make my way over.  </p>

            <p>((That&#39;s okay. No matter how much Lonny likes being the center of attention, this thread has more important things to deal with by now. I&#39;ll just declare my last post before this thread was moved up here to be about ten seconds or so after your previous post. Potentially further, since I thought Sebak was with the group when he apparently isn&#39;t at this point. So, wait, then how is Sebak <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=2941;title=PPC%20Message%20Board">over at the archery range</a> when there&#39;s <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=2936;title=PPC%20Message%20Board">simultaneously a Sebak sitting in the coffee shop behind</a> the rest of the group? Unless... the coffee-shop Sebak&#39;s another body-copy of the % entity! Uh-oh. I&#39;m glad the characters can&#39;t hear beyond these double-parentheses.))<br><br>On the northwest side of New Caledonia, a cemetery took up an unassuming patch of ground on a low hill. Those living around the hill tended to stay away from it, since for some reason, the presence of numerous tombstones tended to make most humanoid species nervous.<br><br>The Yertis had no such reservations. After briefly scanning the area for other minds, it moved to one of the uppermost sections of the hill, stopping next to an unassuming tombstone dedicated to Makes-Things, the famed co-founder of DoSAT. Those agents that have visited DoSAT within the past few years would likely be very confused by its presence, but in truth, the gravestone was only there as a location marker. Makes-Things&#39;s body had never been found, for what were in retrospect quite obvious reasons, and the gravestone&#39;s value as a memorial site was only a beneficial side effect to its intended function.<br><br>The Yertis felt around with its roots close to the base of the gravestone, quickly locating a pressure switch that, if one were judging solely by shape and position, was originally intended to be stepped on. However, as a being possessing no feet, the Yertis instead activated the switch by pressing down on either side with two of its nearest roots until the Flower detected a distant grinding sound. It moved back a few feet as a small section of ground shifted, the gravestone tilting back with it to reveal a passage under the hill. Contracting its branches to keep them from hitting the sides of the corridor, the Yertis descended, pushing another switch on its way down to close the passage behind it.<br><br>Even after the tunnels widened out, it kept its branches clustered inward until it reached the central communications room, alerting a few of the technicians monitoring various streams of information from a subspace messaging device. One of those technicians looked up as his Flower superior approached him, the Yertis&#39;s ambient telepathy radiating irritation and disapproval as it advanced.<br><br><i>There had better be an extremely good reason for interrupting me during inspection,</i> the Yertis said firmly. <i>The recent instability in Headquarters isn&#39;t going to last forever, and I&#39;ve been given a prime opportunity to see how my officers respond to unusual problems, of which I do not relish wasting a second.</i><br><br>&quot;Actually, sir, what I needed to report may be tied to the instability,&quot; the technician replied, turning his swivel chair to face the Flower. &quot;We&#39;ve had reports of a god-mode Suvian posing as an Agent.&quot;<br><br>The Deputy of the Department of Internal Affairs was suddenly paying its full attention. <i>Where? What is it? How much damage has it done?</i><br><br>&quot;As of the most recent report, it&#39;s only caused acid damage to a few meters of road in Soeur Jeanne Avenue and the nearby buildings. We knew it was god-mode mainly due to its vast power set, which included shapeshifting, self-duplication, and a few other potential high-class threats. I say potential because it <i>claimed</i> to have them, but it also claimed to be a terror of gods and a devourer of worlds, so I doubt we can take anything it says at face value.&quot;<br><br><i>Where is it now?</i><br><br>&quot;It&#39;s already duplicated at least once, so it could have secondary and tertiary selves anywhere in the area, and right now, all I have to go on is the report from a vacationing DTE Agent on the scene and one of our patrolling officers that reported it as &#39;a big scary thing that just showed up out of nowhere&#39;. There&#39;s good news, though. Two Officers managed to destroy its primary body.&quot;<br><br><i>What did they use?</i><br><br>&quot;A black hole.&quot;<br><br><i>Ah.</i><br><br>&quot;Pity it wasn&#39;t something a little more portable,&quot; quipped one of the other technicians sitting near the subspace receiver. &quot;We can&#39;t send people out armed with black holes, because we&#39;d do more damage than it&#39;s-&quot; <br><br><i>Be quiet, Pearson.</i><br><br>&quot;Sorry, sir.&quot;<br><br>The Yertis paced about the small amount of free space in the communications room for a moment before turning back to the first technician.<br><br><i>Put the patrol officers on alert. Logically, this thing should hang low after its primary body died in so cinematic a manner, but the day Suvians behave logically is the day the Weeds grow feet, so we should expect anything. I also need Carpenter protocol active. If this thing can shapeshift, we need to make sure it isn&#39;t impersonating one of our officers, or one of the Headquarters agents running around the city. If it sends a duplicate into HQ, next thing we know it&#39;ll be trying to replace de Sod.</i><br><br><i>Normally, I&#39;d say I don&#39;t want to alarm people, but since this thing&#39;s already  spooked one of the patrollers and sprayed acid on one of our streets, it&#39;s safe to say they&#39;re alarmed already, so I just want to make sure the intruder&#39;s contained. Run checks on everywhere it might have been, just in case. We don&#39;t want to miss anything that could grow a new Suvian.</i><br><br><i>Oh, and another thing: give me the names of the officers who took out its first body and tell them good job from me; they&#39;ll be on the fast track to promotion if they keep that up, and if they&#39;re not mine, I&#39;ll put in a good word with the Tiger Lily at our next department meeting.</i><br><br>The Yertis shook its berries in satisfaction. <i>That felt good.

            <p>While running across the plaza towards New Caledonia&#39;s downtown area, the DIA duo was accosted by a Dersite and his clockwork partner. The officers skid to a halt as the little black figure darted to and fro between Fire Flash and Taldaris. <br><br>As the carapacian babbled excitedly, the protoss glanced at his partner, who was grinning from ear to ear.<br><br>&quot;Looks like you&#39;ve got an admirer,&quot; said Fire Flash. &quot;You know what? I&#39;ll leave you to it. You came here to have a day off, right? Enjoy it! The Yertis probably kicked off the carpenter protocol already, so this whole schtick should be done in a couple of hours. You look like you&#39;re pretty tuckered out psi-wise anyways, so there&#39;s no point in overexerting yourself. Don&#39;t come back too late, wash that cloak before you drag it all over the RC, and make sure Cloudsweeper brushes her teeth before going to bed. Be good!&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Hold it. How can you believe that we can safely contain the % entity without psionic support or...</i>&quot; began Taldaris, but his partner was already gone. The protoss stood there awkwardly for a moment before turning his attention back to Lonny the Dersite.<br><br>&quot;<i>Erm. Yes, your question about my weapon. I require my forearm gauntlet to channel my psi into blades. I have not yet achieved the proper control or discipline to produce a cutting edge without mechanical assistance...</i>&quot; said Taldaris. <br><br>The High Templar continued to answer Lonny&#39;s questions one at the time, all the while keeping an eye out for the possible reappearance of %.<br><br>- - - <br><br>Gaspard squinted down the shaft of a blunted practice arrow, trying to align the top with the centre of the mannequin&#39;s chest. Following Sebak&#39;s previous observations and suggestions, he slowly drew back the bow until the string nearly touched his nose. The Spy slowly adjusted his firing angle upwards to compensate for arrow drop and a fraction to the right to counter the slight breeze that had just picked up. <br><br>He was just about to let fly when there was a loud roaring sound behind him. Gaspard&#39;s aim was thrown off and he let go of the string, causing the projectile to sail a metre above the target. The racket continued for a few more minutes, then stopped as suddenly as it began. <br><br>&quot;What on Earth was that?&quot; asked Gaspard. <br><br>The question was answered when a woman waving her cell phone ran up behind the firing line, shouting: &quot;You guys just missed an epic fight! Come &#39;round, I got it all on video!&quot;</p>

            <p>Sigma folded her arms and sighed. She knew that look anywhere.<br><br>&quot;No, we&#39;re not going to assimilate you,&quot; she said, then promptly facepalmed. The Ironic Overpower had a very bad (or possibly very good) sense of timing. Concentrating on reverting the Borg voice to her normal one, she repeated herself and made sure to apologise:<br><br>&quot;No, we&#39;re not going to assimilate you. Sorry.&quot;<br><br>Then she realised how awkward that wording had sounded.

We haven&#39;t explored any further because that Suvian accosted us.

            <p>Tish really didn&#39;t have anything to say about what was a decent ship, unless it was the romantic kind. <i>Then</i> she had some strong opinions.

            <p>Day-offs were a rare occurrence for the many agents of the PPC. In fact, there were many who had never been fortunate enough to take a day-off; Joseph and Andrew were in this group of unfortunates, which was why they had instantly pounced on the opportunity to get some sunshine the very moment the scheduling accident had occurred.<br><br>&quot;I like this coffee shop,&quot; said Andrew happily, leaning back into his chair with a content sigh. &quot;Their stuff is brilliant.&quot;<br><br>Joseph nodded. &quot;It is of better quality than what we usually consume.&quot;<br><br>The duo had immediately made a break for the coffee shop upon leaving the headquarters, and had been sitting within the shop for hours, basking in the aroma and enjoying the rich flavour of their drinks. It had been a long time since they had drank anything that wasn&#39;t instant coffee, and they wanted to savour the drinks for as long as possible.<br><br>&quot;Man, I wish we could have a door to our RC from here,&quot; continued Andrew, who paused and quickly turned to the waiter nearby, handing over a tip. <i>&quot;Ton cafй est dйlicieux. Je le adore.&quot;</i><br><br>As the waiter left, the red-headed agent turned back to see his partner watching his face with a rather curious expression.<br><br>&quot;Is there something wrong?&quot; he asked.<br><br><i>&quot;Je l&#39;adore.&quot;</i><br><br>Andrew blinked in confusion, before letting out a quiet chuckle. &quot;Heh, forgot about that. Man, the thing I get wrong in French is something really obvious.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You usually make obvious mistakes,&quot; replied Joseph, the dark-haired agent lifting up his mug to his lips.&quot;<br><br>Peaceful silence followed, only regularly broken by Andrew&#39;s content sighs. The two agents were not too interested in talking, preferring to enjoy their drinks to the best of their ability, an act that the atmosphere of the cafe seemed to promote.<br><br>The wooden tables and chairs, open windows and natural lighting ... it all added to the cosy feeling.<br><br>&quot;Hey Joseph, could you note the address in case we need to find this place again?&quot; asked Andrew, interrupting the silence.<br><br>Joseph nodded, pulling out his notebook and jotting down the location of the cafe: 21 Avenue Soeur Jeanne.<br><br>With this interruption out of the way, their peaceful day continued, hopefully without coming across any problems that would befall them.<br><br>...<br><br>Who are we kidding?</p>

            <p>I was a bit disappointed in how that one turned out, actually. Since nobody was quite sure who could do what in the RP&#39;s storyline, everyone just sort of left it. It could have been a lot of fun, but it never really got off the ground. I had to introduce hordes of triangle monsters in out of left field just to try and get it working, and still not much happened.<br><br>By the way, would I be able to participate with an agent team if I don&#39;t have Permission, or will I only be able to work with New Caledonia NPCs, like citizens and Flowers and the like? I&#39;m trying to brainstorm character directions, and that information would be helpful.<br>Actually, if I don&#39;t have Permission, would I be even able to create NPCs for this? The only current New Caledonia NPCs are: a few shopkeepers that are all the property of their individual creators; Monty, Tod, and Deirdre(Deirde?), who are all birds judging by <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1v4HKVdLZu_lfjnh29fja1kfYK67qqFGIftwPTvagmFw">this story</a>, and so may not be able to speak human languages; and the Yertis. That&#39;s a small pool to work with. The Yertis could be fun, though. He hasn&#39;t really been developed at all, so there&#39;d be a lot of room to move about in his character, and there&#39;d be a direction to move him in as well, with all of the other-dimensional travelers coming in and, knowing PPC Agents, making a mess of his territory.</p>

            <p>Permission is not required for RPs, since their canonicity is considered dubious by default. Plus, RP is a great way to develop new characters, so we don&#39;t want to deny people the opportunity to do so pre-Permission. <b>However</b>, if the RP&#39;s creator (in this case, SeaTurtle) wants to have a strictly canonical, Permission-only kind of RP, they can do that.

I actually would have had to drop out in any case, since I had a meeting that weekend, but I&#39;d hoped things would happen before I left, and I could&#39;ve written my characters a graceful exit, perhaps to make a glorious comeback later. Somebody (preferably the person who started the game) really has to take charge and <i>run</i> things in a an event-driven situation like that, or we get exactly what we got: everyone has a different idea about what should be happening, and therefore nothing does.

            <p>SeaTurtle is the one who started this, so I leave it to him to state the rules properly, as he would know better. However, as far as I know, our agents get a day off and wander about New Caledonia (the PPC city in World One).

            <p>&quot;A day off? A day off!&quot; cried Eagrus when Cyba brought him the news. It was such unusual and such good news that he momentarily ignored the fact Cyba had also brought Sigma and Phi along to the RC door.<br><br>&quot;No joke,&quot; Phi chimed in. &quot;Some kind of bizarre scheduling accident, apparently. Oh, sorry, Joke!&quot; she added quickly, when the mini-Colossus bleeped indignantly at her.<br><br>Eagrus sat down loudly, stunned. This was not something that had happened - well - ever, in his experience. &quot;Come!&quot; he said. &quot;We should make the most of this, and I know just the place!&quot;<br><br>The door was easy enough to find, given that Eagrus knew how to distract himself, and the other three had no idea where he was leading them anyway. It looked ordinary enough, but when they stepped through, it became immediately apparent that they were no longer in HQ.<br><br>The four of them found themselves in the hall of a building, which housed &#39;doors&#39; to the PPC General Store and various OFU Staff Sections as well as to HQ. The only other door led out onto a street lit by blazing sunshine.<br><br>&quot;Where are we?&quot; asked Cyba when they stepped out, squinting until her eyes adapted to the bright sunlight.<br><br>&quot;Welcome,&quot; announced Eagrus, &quot;to the PPC city of New Caledonia!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is this... World One?&quot; inquired Phi.<br><br>&quot;Indeed it is!&quot; Eagrus told the happily. &quot;It&#39;s not exactly Middle Earth, but I&#39;ve heard it is quite a nice place nonetheless.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What about disguises?&quot; wondered Phi aloud, noticing that she, Sigma and Cyba were still plated in black metal (Sigma appeared to have polished hers), and Eagrus was in his Easterling armour.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a PPC city,&quot; Eagrus answered. &quot;I believe we can walk freely here, undisguised.&quot;<br><br>Sigma, meanwhile, who had said nothing until now, suddenly crowed from by the map she had discovered across the street. The others turned, startled, and unable to quite make what she had said, and Eagrus ducked into the doorway behind him in case of attack.<br><br>&quot;WOOT! They have a THEME PARK here!&quot; crowed Sigma again, slightly more discernably this time.<br><br>Eagrus breathed a sigh of relief that there was no attack going on, but face-helmeted all the same. &quot;I&#39;m for finding somewhere to get my hair shaved,&quot; he said finally. &quot;There&#39;s no way I am going anywhere near a theme park with any of you three ever again, and most especially not any roller-coasters!&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s multiversally themed!&quot; protested Sigma, and Cyba and Phi joined her by the map board eagerly.<br><br>&quot;Ooooh!&quot; squawked Cyba, noticing something else. &quot;There&#39;s a shopping district! I wonder if they have an armour shop...&quot;<br><br>Eagrus groaned audibly, and Phi thought she caught a quite mutter of &#39;Women!&#39;.<br><br>&quot;They might have a sword shop,&quot; Phi pointed out, making Eagrus perk up immediately. &quot;I mean, probably only replicas, given this is World One, but...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Alright,&quot; Eagrus relented. &quot;I will consent to come and visit this shopping district with you, but then I am going to get a haircut!&quot;<br><br>&quot;And we shall go on roller coasters all day!&quot; proclaimed Sigma, getting cheers from Cyba and Phi.<br><br>Eagrus smiled beneath his helmet. If they were off on roller-coasters, then he might just get a holiday from the Collective of Three...</p>

            <p>Agent % stared solemly at his console screen. It had alerted (gender neuter) of some unforseen free time. % disliked free time, and also disliked the cheery notice telling him to socialize. Regardless of %&#39;s prefrences, his daily report was still advising him to interact with corpreal beings he shared a workplace with. % took a moment to steady (gender neuter)self as well as a seventh dimensional disembodied intellegence can. Then he went through the complicated process of acumulating matter to form a body. <br><br>The end result appeared to be a tall, lanky humanoid with grey skin, blank blue eyes, and slit nostrils. Now having formed a body, % was headed for the grey door of his RC before it remembered three important things. One, it needed a mouth. % rearranged his tissues to form the missing orifice, and added sharp fangs in afterthought. Two, it needed a gender so its fellow agents would have something to apply pronouns to. After a few minutes of tricky biological addition, he strode towards the door. With one hand on the knob, %  stopped to look into the murky gloom of his room. Switching his vision to ultraviolet, he remembered what forgotten. Clothes. % ran over to his small closet, and chose the least complicated clothes from his hangers.<br><br>Clad in jeans and a leather jacket, % stepped out of his RC, and into the hall of headquarters. A few days ago, he wouldn&#39;t have been doing this alone. However, his partner would be in medical until the pon farr wore off. % looked around at the other agents stepping out of RC units, and noticed the all had one thing in common that he was missing. % was bald. However, by the time he was at the door to world one, agent % had a erect mane of purple bristles atop his head. Stopping in front of the door, % took a deep breath before turning the knob. New Caledonia was the largest city he&#39;d been to, and evidently the loudest. % was about to find a map stand, but stopped when the smell of cooking pheasant whipped into his nostrils. %&#39;s stomach growled, reminding him he&#39;d choosen a carnivore&#39;s digestive tract. % had never injested food before, but his blood sugar was low and accompanied with a large wallet. He set off at a dead run, following the burning meat scent to its source.</p>

            <p>Compared to the Generic Grey hallways of HQ, the PPC City of New Caledonia was like a resort town: it had sunshine, fresh air, food that didn’t come to life and cause an Emergency, sunshine, places to sit, greenery, and sunshine. Due to their shift-based schedule, Infrastructure Department agents accounted for most of the city’s visitors, but today was an exception. Floaters, Assassins, Bad Slashers, and even some Untanglers had discovered the city and were currently milling about, taking in the sights. And the sunshine.<br>  <br>The general architectural style was reminiscent of an old European city: tall and narrow buildings with brick facades placed close to one another, cobblestone streets lined with trees, and the odd open plaza complete with statues of famous Agents or fountains.<br><br>Along the street known as the Rue Des Fleurs walked a yellow Earth pony mare wearing a set of black armour and a rather nondescript black-clad young man with a blue bowtie.  They weaved through the crowds in silence, slowly making their way westward. The duo crossed the restaurant district, which was practically overflowing with people trying to find someplace to eat lunch. Agents streamed in and out of restaurants, argued with their friends about where they should eat, or rested on the benches that lined the street.<br><br> The two agents eventually reached a park with a pond at the outskirts of the city, where the paved road turned to a beaten earth path. They walked around the pond until it was between them and the trail then stopped under the shade of a tree that leaned over the water. The pony reached into her saddlebags, pulled out a paper bag using her teeth and offered it to her human companion. The man reached inside and tossed a handful of grains into the water. The seeds had barely touched the surface of the water before a swarm of ducks converged noisily on the spot, nipping at the food. The man continued feeding the birds for the better part of a minute before crumpling up the bag and placing it back inside the pony’s saddlebags. After looking around to make sure he and his friend were truly alone, the man broke the silence.<br><br>“It was a good idea to go for a walk, Fire Flash. Thank you.”<br><br>The mare brushed a lock of her red-and-orange mane out of her eyes with a foreleg. “Nothing to it, Gaspard. You looked like you needed some fresh air anyways; I’m not sure if you noticed, but you’ve lost some weight in the past few weeks. I think you’re overdoing it with that plan of yours.”<br><br>“Oh, that,” said Gaspard, looking down at his shoes. “No, no. It’s fine.”<br><br>“No, it isn’t,” said Fire Flash firmly. “You’re running yourself ragged. Besides, how do you know this isn’t some sort of elaborate prank? Some parts of the story seem a really far-fetched to me.”<br><br>“You’re forgetting who sent it,” said Gaspard. “He would never joke about that.”<br><br>The cartoon pony made a sound halfway through a snort and a sigh. “Right. Still doesn’t rule out the fact that this could all be the product of a delusional mind. ‘Cause were talking about a guy that was perfectly willing to go through with the Cafeteria Ma—“<br><br>“I know,” interrupted Gaspard. “But he’s definitely sane. He couldn’t have recorded everything in great detail, given it to his friends, and then given it to me without somebody noticing he had gone mad.”<br><br>Fire Flash rolled her eyes. “Yeah, right. He was mad since the beginning. I mean, how could he have lived with himself after the incident?”<br><br>Gaspard shook his head. “He couldn’t. He neuralyzed himself immediately after the battle but later found out that the memory was more… <i>persistent</i> than he thought.”<br><br>Silence fell between the agents as they watched the birds battle over the last few seeds in the water.<br><br>“I still think this is completely insane, but thanks for talking to us about this,” said Fire Flash once the birds had settled. “We’ll help. Maybe this time it will turn out differently.”<br><br>“Yes, ma’am, that’s the plan. If we can convince Agent Terabyte to shift towards a more tech-oriented role, we have a chance to go into a full-blown power play with the DIA on our side,” said Gaspard with a smile. “We could end the war within a matter of weeks.”<br><br>“Glad to hear it. Oh, and keep that positive attitude, will you? It’s better than that moping routine that you’ve been doing.” Fire Flash craned her neck towards the city. “Wanna head back? I think Taldaris and Cloudsweeper went to the theme park. You could do with a little R&amp;R.”<br><br>“Lead on, ma’am.”<br><br>“Stop calling me that.”<br><br>“Yes, miss.”<br><br>“Stop.”</p>

            <p>((Let&#39;s try to keep things in a single chain to maintain chronological order of posts.))<br><br>A little blonde five-year old girl strolled alone into the coffee shop on 21 Avenue Soeur Jeanne. She took a seat at an empty table and spent a couple of minutes kicking her feet in midair before hopping back down and wandering aimlessly in the cafй. She eventually grew tired of the activity and stopped at the table where Agents Andrew and Joseph were seated.<br><br>&quot;Hi, my name is Sophie!&quot; she squeaked as she peeked over the table&#39;s edge. &quot;My Daddy got lost. Can you find him, please? We were supposed to go to the merry-go-round but he stopped to go and look inna shop an&#39; I got bored so I went alone an&#39; then they wouldn&#39;t let me go alone on the merry-go-round so I went to the <i>mew-say</i> over there but it was really boring an&#39; then I went looking for Daddy but he got lost. Can you help me look for him?&quot;</p>

            <p>((Understood.))<br><br>Joseph placed his mug back onto the table surface, shooting his partner a quick, somewhat bemused, glance, before turning to face the little girl who barely reached the table&#39;s height. It was not everyday that someone asked him and Andrew to help them find somebody - usually any requests for assistance involved acting as backup for any bad-fics that required more than one agent pair. However, even if such a thing was new to them, he would not decline her request. It would be impolite to do so.<br><br>&quot;Very well,&quot; he said, giving the girl a polite nod. &quot;We shall provide you assistance.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He means that we&#39;ll be happy to help,&quot; added Andrew, the red-headed agent assuming that Sophie would probably not understand the word &#39;assistance&#39;. He didn&#39;t when he was young. &quot;What does your dad look like?&quot;<br><br>He discreetly gave his stoic partner a thumbs-up, indicating that he would handle the situation from then on. His partner was not much of a talker, so it would be better for him to deal with the seemingly talkative child. He didn&#39;t know if he could handle the strain of seeing Joe speak for longer than two minutes, not even if with the help of all the coffee he had consumed in the last few hours.</p>

            <p>&quot;Great!&quot; the girl beamed. &quot;Okay. So my daddy is about this tall...&quot;<br><br>She jumped with her right arm stretched upwards, trying to give the two agents an idea of her father&#39;s height. She didn&#39;t quite manage to reach the desired height the first time so she jumped again. And again.<br><br>And again.<br><br>After a few unsuccessful tries at jumping at dad-height, she spread her arms wide. &quot;Never mind. He&#39;s also big like <i>this</i>. But shhhhhh... don&#39;t say it to anyone,&quot; she added in a whisper. &quot;He doesn&#39;t like it when other people say he&#39;s big. Even if he walks like this all the time.&quot; She paraded in front of Joseph and Andrew with her stomach puffed out and taking heavy steps. When she settled down she cupped her chin with a hand, apparently deep in thought.<br><br>&quot;Um... oh! He&#39;s got blond hair like me and his name is Angus. He&#39;s a secret agent! He works for a nice rose-lady.&quot;<br><br>Sophie grabbed Andrew by the finger and started moving towards the cafй&#39;s exit. &quot;Can we go now? Daddy gets nervous when he&#39;s all alone.&quot;<br></p>

            <p>Agent % was starting to appreciate human architechture. The narrow store fronts melded with seemingly random gothic spires, while clashing with abstract art. The chaos reminded him of his seventh dimensional home, where physics behaved like they had partaken in large qualities of alchohal. <br><br>He passed several thing in his pursuit of the baking bird, including but not limeted to; a theme park, seventeen assorted museums, four pyrotechnic displays, and big bird. As the grey hominid rounded a corner, and leaped over a improperly parked ballista near town hall. Of to the side was a grey coffee shop, the kind one typically associates soft yellow lights, and smooth jazz with. Its tinted widows allowed a dim glow into the street, while a stream of customers opened doors, letting a rich legume derived smell waft into %&#39;s nostrils. He loped over to the door, and cautiously stepped in. <br><br>Agent %&#39;s first experience in a coffee shop was pleasant. His multi-leveled mind took in the rich aroma of food, and drink. He marveled at the soft blue walls soothed the eye, and how rich velvet carpet tickled his bare feet. The overall effect of this subtle art on an alien mind was similar to how a blind person may marvel at a colorful sculpture. They can percieve specific aspects of it, but still lack its full intended meaning. % noticed a few pairs of agents talking to a young girl. Well, he assumed they were agents, as the electrical activity of their brains had the unique pattern a being forms to cope with headquarter&#39;s strange layout. % realized he&#39;d used more energy to grow an organ for reading minds, thus increasing his metabolic need further. He swiftly metabolized the lump of tissue, and began walking towards the agents. <br><br>At first, % reached out with a tenderil of his conciousness in order to communicate with the humans, but then remembered that verbalizing his questions would be less perturbing to his colleauges. % took in a deep breath, and exhaled. He repeated this, but now moving his tongue to push words out from between recurved fangs. &quot;Ezzzcuzzze me, bu&#39; can zomeboody tell mee vhere tooo ordzer?&quot; He stopped, the effort of speaking had tired him out. The grey humanoid plopped down in a chair, started unzipping his leather jacket. % hadn&#39;t realized being an endotherm would lead to increased energy needs, but even now he could feel his constructed body dying with no food to sustain it. <br><br>Looking up, % squinted his pale blue eyes. &quot;Zomebody needzz to invezzzt in zzzpell check...&quot; he murmered</p>

            <p>Andrew gave the young girl a grin. He would definitely do his best to help her find her dad. After all, it wouldn&#39;t be polite to leave her father scared and alone. The little girl was probably the responsible one in the family, and it was his duty to make sure that his fellow agent, even if he didn&#39;t know said agent well, had someone responsible to act as a bastion of sanity in this crazed world.<br><br>&quot;Sure,&quot; he began. &quot;We can go right no-&quot;<br><br>His words trailed away, the red-headed agent having seen the grey being that had just asked him and his partner on where one could order a coffee. At least, that was what he assumed - it was a bit difficult understanding the other being with all the Z&#39;s.<br><br>&quot;Uh, go talk to the girl at the counter,&quot; said Andrew awkwardly. It had taken a few seconds, but he had recognised the other being as a fellow Agent, although not one that he regularly socialised with. &quot;Do you have money on you for something though?&quot;<br><br>While Andrew attempted to instruct the newcomer, Joseph gave Sophie a glance and a shrug. Weird things always happened to them - it was a trait that most agents shared. He was used to it though; all of the PPC&#39;s weirdness had pretty much become just another part of his daily life.<br><br>Although the agents falling out of the ceiling was new.</p>

            <p>“Hey, Anebrin, lookit this,” Des said over his shoulder. He was standing near RC log e&#39;s console, while his partner was sitting near the RC&#39;s old table, sharpening his talking sword. Said elf took his time, but in a few moments joined Des near the console.<br>“A free day?” he asked, incredulously. “I thought that the PPC was dangerously understaffed?”<br>“No kidding,” Des answered. He peered closer at the message from Personnel. “A length of rope, a plastic inflatable shark, and an impressionable group of trained circus monkeys? And I thought the fact that someone managed to create a <i>Teletubbies</i> mini was weird...”<br>“Still, we should use this oddity,” Anebrin said. “I miss the sunlight, and I have an idea where to go.”<br>“St. Stephan&#39;s green in a sunny day?” asked Des hopefully.<br>Anebrin, however, shook his head. “I have no idea where that is. No, that is not quite what I had in mind. I have heard tell that the PPC has built, or leased, or came across, a city in the World One territory of New Caledonia.”<br>Des made his &#39;mouth as a diagonal line&#39; expression, whose meaning, Anebrin learned a while back, was that the Israeli teenager was half-annoyed, half-perplexed. “New Caledonia...? French. Augh, hate that language. It gives me headaches.” He paused, rubbing his goatee. “Still, I guess it couldn&#39;t hurt.”<br><br>And so the duo left their RC, distracting one another with a conversation about music (“How can you like <i>Magia</i>? The yells at the start are quite horrid!” “Easily enough; I&#39;m used to them, and the rest of the song is awesome. Also, it&#39;s <i>Madoka</i> stuff.”) until they have reached the door. While Des examined the door in a fit of curiosity (he found the tiny runes etched on one corner quite similar fuxark runes) his partner went through the door and waited, blinking in the sudden sunlight, for him to finish poring over the door.<br><br>After some time, Des finally left the door in peace and joined Anebrin at the other side. He took a deep breath. “Ah, the great outdoors,” he said, a stupid smile plastered on his face. Anebrin nodded, taking a huge breath.<br>“I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew,” said a voice from Anebrin&#39;s general direction. Des turned and saw the elf hitting the scabbard of his sword.<br>“You haven&#39;t said that, have you now, Anebrin?” he asked.<br>“Of course not. It is my sword,” came the reply. The elf drew the sword and presented it, hilt-first, to Des. The boy took the sword and inspected it. Nothing seemed out of ordinary to him.<br>“Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing?” came a voice from the sword, and the startled Des dropped it, nearly puncturing his foot.<br>“I see what you mean,” he said, clearly surprised. Anebrin picked the sword up and sheathed it.<br>“That aside...” the elf said, “I think I know a good place to sit in.”<br><br>So Des followed Anebrin around, staring at the various people on the streets and distracting Anebrin with his prattle (“Hey! Isn&#39;t that a Game Theory!Nanohaverse Kabupatenic mage?” “I have no idea.”) until they&#39;ve reached a coffee shop.<br>“Aw, coffee?” the disappointed Des asked.<br>“You do not have to drink it,” Anebrin replied, “and their cakes are rather good.”<br><br>They entered the shop, ordered some pie, and found themselves a table.</p>

            <p>Sebak decided that he liked New Caledonia. It didn&#39;t have quite the comfortable, dry heat of Vulcan, but its sunshine and light breeze were significant improvements over the cold, stale air of HQ. Sebak felt he could have a pleasant time.<br><br>What was not as pleasant, however, was his partner.<br><br>&quot;Sebak! There&#39;s a theme park here!&quot; Tish exclaimed, pointing. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have heard of a museum that sounds most interesting. It contains lost works from many continua.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Boring,&quot; Tish said. &quot;The theme park has <i>rides</i> from many continua! You could <i>never</i> go to a park like this  in World One. Or, I mean, in the non-PPC part of World One.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I highly doubt you could find many of the works contained in the Musйe des Univers Perdus in World One libraries,&quot; Sebak countered.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, but rides are more fun!&quot; Tish said. &quot;And Vulcan or not Vulcan, you need to learn to have fun!&quot; She tugged on his hand.<br><br>&quot;Musuems are &#39;fun&#39;,&quot; Sebak said, pulling away quickly. Touch telepathy with such an emotional human was...unpleasant. &quot;Have you ever considered that perhaps you need to learn to have fun in different ways?&quot;<br><br>She sighed audibly. &quot;Fine. If you go on some rides, I&#39;ll go to the museum with you.&quot;<br><br>Sebak nodded. &quot;That would be an acceptable compromise.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yay!&quot; Tish exclaimed. &quot;Come on!&quot;<br><br>She took off running towards the theme park, and Sebak followed, ever so slightly rolling his eyes.</p>

            <p>% was getting as close to enjoying himself as a being without the necessary glands can. He was currently walking around some trekverse themepark, holding a cup of ammonia cocktail laced with coffee beans. His leather jacket was missing, having melted an hour earlier in a coffee shop. % was headed towards the starfleet bridge simulator when several things happened.<br><br>1) The laws of narrative comedy caused him to trip. Normaly, this would cause humorous coffee splatters. However, it is significantly less funny when the coffee in question is lethal to organic life.<br><br>2) Said coffee had created a pretty lightshow in his frontal lobes, making it hard to make sure he wouldn&#39;t hit somebody.<br><br>3) %&#39;s mind was so muddled he forgot that he could bodily purge the offending chemicals from his ammonia based bloodstream.</p>

            <p>... that the ammonia coffee did not hit anything organic. Well, nothing fully organic, anyway...<br><br>Cyba, Sigma and Phi were just picking themselves up from having tripped over Fire Flash - with hurried apologies - when the ammonia coffee hit them. It was Sigma who got the brunt of it, because Phi was shielded by her cloak (which was promptly ruined but provided an excuse for shopping later) and Cyba by her coat (which was not ruined because it had once belonged to a Stu and was evidently more resilient).<br><br>Sigma was damaged by the ammonia, but her body immediately went into a repair cycle and quickly fixed the problem.

            <p>Fire Flash got up on shaky legs, her head still reeling from the three Borg women tripping over her. She had barely got her breath back as a... <i>thing</i> tripped and spilt coffee all over the Borg with a blue eye-laser. As the three cyborgs towered over the downed agent, Fire Flash scooted towards the confrontation.<br><br>&quot;Hey.

Even while off-duty, a DIA officer must be prepared to respond to any situation that might come up.

Now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>My apologies,</i>&quot; said Taldaris as he set his partner down. He turned to  face Sigma, who was in the middle of auto-repairs. &quot;<i>Fascinating. Bio-mechanical engineering. Do you require medial attention?</i>&quot;<br><br>Meanwhile, Fire Flash had slowly scooted over to Agent %, who was still lying on the floor and looking pretty out of it. &quot;What&#39;s with that drink, mister?

Gaspard De Grasse, Spy Thirteenth class, at you service. You are part of ESAS, correct?&quot; he said, gesturing at their flash patches. <br><br>In the junior agent&#39;s mind, memories were getting jumbled.

            <p>Agent % squinted at the three borg. They seemed to be showing displeasure at his spill. He looked down to see the hole his drink was eating into the cement, and mentaly checked his alchohal blood levels. To high for his health. &quot;Thizzz bodyzzz a mezzz.&quot; He remarked, and started prepping himself for mass conversion. His bony grey frame creaked dangerously, while the purple bristles atop his head started vibrating. &quot;You might want to ztep back.&quot;<br><br> Then the being known as % exploded. Large chunks of silicon based flesh flew in all directions, while caustic body fluids sizzled when they hit pavement. It looked like an industrial accident. Then, rather unceremoniously, chunks of flesh started crawling back together. Bone grew, and became coated in flesh. Scaly grey hide covered black muscle, and purple quills elongated. The end result was a creature that looked like a cross between an iguanna, and a horse. Its mane and tail were composed of quills, and the hooves were rather strange. <br><br>% found his new body less taxing than before. Several new nerve swellings acted as secondary brains, reducing the strain on his main intellect. Food may be a problem, as plant matter had never been %&#39;s favorite substance to ingest. He resorted to his typical method of tacking curved fangs onto bodies. He finally remembered something had been talking to him. Turning to the pony, now eye level, he spoke. &quot;That wazzz a double zot ammonia exzprezzo. I&#39;ve alwayz had an affinity for creating zilicon bazed bodiezz to interact with phizzzical beingz. But thizz iz not my native formz.&quot; He paused, and concentrated on the bits of of himself that had not reassimilated. With some effort, he fashioned them into a grey snake. After painfully stringing his mind between two bodies, he sent the &quot;snake&quot; off on its way. He could now be able to participate in two coversations in two places. Socialization, just what the doctor ordered.</p>

            <p>Fire Flash scooted away as nonchalantly as possible away from Agent %. <br><br>&quot;Right. Firstly, you&#39;ve regenerated once already and that was pretty much like an acid bomb going off on the pavement. We&#39;re not having this again. Secondly, we have FicPsych for individuals like you who want to hammer out some of their inward aspects. Thirdly... no.

The only reason you are not done so is because your </i>pay<i> would be significantly decreased.</i>&quot;<br><br>The protoss moved his right arm in a way which Agent % could not fail to notice the golden psi-blade gauntlet that covered his forearm. &quot;<i>Know that I am protoss! Firstborn of the gods, living embodiment of purity of form, adept of the holy Khala, veteran warrior of the Templar caste, and upholder of the Great Stewardship.

Now--</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;Calm down, Taldaris,&quot; said Fire Flash. &quot;Maybe you misinterpreted his thoughts.&quot;<br><br>The protoss agent continued to glare at % as he tucked his arms back under his ruined cloak. &quot;<i>Furthermore, you have not addressed my first question,</i>&quot; said Taldaris. &quot;<i>What are you?</i><br><br>- - -<br><br>The arrow grazed the side of the target mannequin and then lost itself in the tall grass of the theme park&#39;s shooting range. Gaspard lowered his bow and glanced at Sebak, who was standing several paces behind him. &quot;Twenty arrows and only two hit the mark, three if you count that one,&quot; said the Spy, pointing at the target with his thumb. &quot;I&#39;ve had better days. Do you want to have a turn, sir? I&#39;d just like to observe your technique.&quot;<br><br></p>

            <p>% was not impressed. The lecture about being firstborn of the gods was a tired old ramble he&#39;d heard to many times. Agent % was now itching to try out what he learned in Intimidation of Sues 101. He was passing so far, and now was a perfect time to test his skill. % reformed his throat, so he&#39;d have a deep sinister baritone, the ones that shake spines to bits. He started increasing mass, sucking up the cement under him. &quot;Who am I? There are worlds, thing. Lands that are whirling chaos, that tear apart your very being, and shred your atoms. Living there are entities that gods fear, who consume worlds to whet their appetite.&quot; He paused, unable to resist a dramatic pause. &quot;THEY. FEAR. ME.&quot;<br><br> By now Agent % had become nothing short of an eldritch abomination, with many snakelike heads, horns, and the ever popular glowing eyes. However, he couldn&#39;t overcome the scientific thrist that afflicted him. On of his &quot;heads&quot; curled around Fire Flash and asked bluntly. &quot;You have the largest eyes of any equine I&#39;ve encountered. What is your taxinomic classification?&quot; Several other head were trying to examine the Borg triplets, with limited success.</p>

            <p>Faster than % could react, Fire Flash sprang into action. She bit into the abomination&#39;s neck, causing it to release her. She followed up the action with a disproportionately powerful kick into %&#39;s centre mass, causing him to reel backwards towards Taldaris. <br><br>There was a reason that the protoss were universally feared by both terran and zerg alike. They stood at three metres tall, possessed incredibly advanced technology, and were one of-- if not <i>the</i>-- most advanced race of psychics in the known galaxy. They created energy <i>blades</i> made out of their <i>minds</i>.<br><br>The High Templar whipped his right hand out of under his cloak and channeled his psionic energy into the gauntlet on his right forearm. A metre-long blade, sharp as a lightsaber, shimmered into existence and was quickly put to use by Taldaris, who had charged directly into %&#39;s core. The protoss hacked and slashed with superhuman speed and strength, loping off limbs and tearing deep gashes into %&#39;s body. <br><br>Fire Flash wasn&#39;t idle. She darted around %, faster than he could track her, delivereing kicks, headbutts, and bites to the monster to corral him away from the theme park and into a wide open space. &quot;Go, Taldaris, go!&quot;<br><br>The Earth pony and protoss disengaged, leaving the crippled form of % in the middle of the plaza. The High Templar pointed the palm of his left hand towards %. A brilliant bubble contained the monster, tapping it inside. &quot;<i>In position. Hit it,</i>&quot; said Taldaris.<br><br>Fire Flash didn&#39;t waste any time and mashed her RA&#39;s controls. A portal opened inside the bubble, sucking % out of his enclosure and right inside the event horizon of a black hole.<br><br>Taldaris held the force field for a few more seconds to ensure any bits of % had gone and then nodded to Fire Flash, who closed the portal. The protoss lifted the bubble once the portal snapped shut. <br><br>&quot;You okay?&quot; panted Fire Flash. &quot;There&#39;s still a part of it off in the city, as a snake.&quot;<br><br>The protoss nodded. He turned his face to the sun and spread his arms, basking in the warm, energy-giving sunlight. &quot;<i>We go. You three,</i>&quot; he said to Cyba, Phi, and Sigma. &quot;<i>Alert the Yertis. Suvian in New Caledonia, shapeshifter, as a snake creature. It is able to replicate itself and possess agents. All combat-trained personnel are to be on the lookout for this abomination. Terminate with extreme prejudice.</i>&quot;<br><br>With that said, the protoss and his partner dashed off in the direction that the snake left in. <br><br><br><br>((Hey, platypus. We don&#39;t ruin RPs with grossly aggressive and overpowered agents.))<br></p>

            <p>A short distance away, two beings stood stock-still in the center of the street. They had arrived for the same reason as many others, to enjoy a day off and wander around without disguises, but they had expected it to simply be a day of fun and respite from the constant sounds of minis wreaking havoc. They were happily incorrect.<br>The taller of the two, a creature of complex clockwork in human form, had watched the battle in appreciation, taking mental notes on the uses of martial psionics in the battle and the teamwork on the part of the DIA Officers. He smiled as he saw the portal open underneath the creature&#39;s massive form, mentally underlining his recollection of the event in case he&#39;d ever need to use similar strategies in the future. He had been motionless while he watched out of both intense concentration on the events in front of him and the even more intense desire not to interfere. The last thing he wanted was to get in someone&#39;s way during the fight, or worse, interrupt something social that was going on in the background.<br><br>The shorter of the two, on the other hand, was standing still out of pure outright awe. He almost considered letting the oversized blue snow-cone in his hand fall to the ground as a visual representation of his reaction, but he decided against it. He&#39;d paid two dollars for that thing at the snack bar, and he was going to eat it no matter how many awesome fights broke out in front of him. He opted instead to shove his snack into his partner&#39;s hand before running toward Taldaris in unrepressed excitement.<br><br>&quot;Oh, wow! Just, that was... that was the most awesome thing I&#39;ve seen in... I don&#39;t even know! Can you make those energy swords whenever you want? How did you know the big monster wouldn&#39;t break into a bunch of little monsters? Where did that hand you lopped off of it go? Oh there it is under the table, never mind. But anyway! That was awesome! You&#39;re awesome! I should stop saying awesome, but I can&#39;t even think of any synonyms! That&#39;s how excited I am!&quot; Close up, the being who was now jumping up and down and running back and forth between Taldaris and Fire Flash could be identified as a Dersite from the Homestuck continuum, atypically dressed in a gray leather jacket that looked slightly too large for him.<br><br>The taller being had patiently been walking toward the group during the excited babble, clutching the snow-cone in his hand as though he&#39;d rather not be handling in lest the drippy blue artificial flavoring stain his carpal mechanism. The Dersite turned to the clockwork being, a massive sharp-toothed smile on his carapaced face.<br><br>&quot;See, Nick? See? I told you you wouldn&#39;t regret coming here! Granted, I didn&#39;t know that this was going to happen, but I <i>knew</i> that <i>something</i> cool was going to happen!&quot;<br><br>The clockwork being looked back and forth between the assembled Agents, several of whom were now staring at him and his partner. Unsure of what exactly to do in his current situation, he defaulted to the most available response.<br><br>&quot;Yes, Lonny. It was... very good. Now, if you would calm down for a moment, I believe this is your snow-cone. I cannot eat it, as I do not possess a mouth.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, yeah.&quot; Lonny&#39;s smile shrank a little as he took the snow-cone from his partner&#39;s outstretched hand. &quot;Sorry about that. I didn&#39;t want to drop it when I was running over, you know.&quot; Taking a large bite from his newly regained treat, Lonny turned back to Taldaris, quickly restoring his excited grin. &quot;Okay, where was I? I remember I was at &#39;That&#39;s awesome, and you&#39;re awesome&#39;, which was one of my main points, but... oh, well, you probably know the rest.&quot;<br>To his partner&#39;s mortification, Lonny turned to the collection of other agents, waving at one that the clockwork golem recognized as a Vulcan.<br><br>&quot;Hello, everyone else! I&#39;m Lonny, and this...&quot; -the golem visibly flinched as the Dersite indicated him with a wide sweep of his arms- &quot;is Copernicus! How much other cool stuff have we missed?&quot;<br><br>((I was going to join the RP a while ago, but decided against it when events started rolling on without me. However, after reading this last post, I couldn&#39;t restrain myself any longer. Meet my two first Agents-to-be! This is going to be fun, I think.))</p>

            <p>&quot;Oh really?&quot; bristled Phi, having heard Taldaris&#39; thought this time.

            <p>Sebak took the bow. &quot;I haven&#39;t had much practice,&quot; he warned. &quot;Recreational weapons training is not popular on Vulcan.&quot;<br><br>However, to a Vulcan, there was nothing that could not be logically reasoned out, though Sebak thought that humans were the exception. He nocked an arrow and pulled the string back, imitating the proper form he had seen in movies. He squinted down the shaft at the target, then let go.<br><br>The arrow flew straight, and Sebak watched as it struck the dummy in the arm.<br><br>&quot;Fascinating,&quot; he said. Somehow, he hadn&#39;t expected logic to apply to this. &quot;Perhaps I can teach you.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>Tish walked into the park. Truthfully, she&#39;d wanted Sebak along to keep her company.

Sure, Sebak wasn&#39;t the most fun, but he was someone.<br><br>She spotted a group of agents near a section of the amusement park that looked Trekverse. Three of them appeared to be Borg, another was a MLP-verse Earth pony, and the others were species Tish didn&#39;t recognize, one something like a reptilian horse made out of rock and the other tall and armored with large weapons. The word &quot;protoss&quot; drifted across her mind. She shivered. She&#39;d never heard that word before - how did it get in her head?<br><br>Tish found herself torn between a desire for company and a fear of a group where the Borg members were some of the least threatening.

            <p>Really <i>ambitious</i>—seems like it would be a lot of work—but I&#39;d personally love to see a graphic-novel version of the Original Series. I hope you like drawing Uruk-hai. J &amp; A spend most of their time in that disguise, at least in the early missions.<br><br>To get to the point, though, I don&#39;t actually know if this is something that requires Permission, per se, though asking on the Board first was definitely the right move. I&#39;d personally class a project like this as fan art, which shouldn&#39;t be a problem, but I think you should wait for some more responses to see how people feel in general.<br><br>Also, could we see a sample of your work?

            <p>I&#39;m sure I misunderstood this, but it definitely sounds like you think you can fit a Jay and Acacia mission into five pages of comic strip. That might (just about) be possible for <i>Rambling Band</i>, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be doable for anything else.<br><br>As for descriptions: there are a handful of references scattered through their missions, but conveniently, Bold Font also drew <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/Images/ppc.jpg">a famous picture</a> of Jay and Acacia:<br><br><img src="http://www.misssandman.com/Images/ppc.jpg"><br><br> Acacia is the shorter one with the brown hair and glasses.

            <p>From &quot;<a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/JAAKSONS/ch1_laurel.html">Laurel</a>&quot;:<br><br><i>The world flickered bizarrely before their eyes...</i><br><br><i>...and instead of two ugly Uruks in full war gear, they were suddenly faced by a pair of young girls, younger than Nenya but older than Rosie. There was a tall, gangly one with messy reddish hair and a shorter brunette wearing a pair of glasses.

There&#39;s what, nine-ish panels per standard comic page, give or take depending on size? There&#39;s a lot of banter to work in... And the missions do get longer on average over time, so whatever you manage for the first one, you&#39;re going to need more for most of the rest. The only exception I can think of offhand is the one with Agent Dead, &quot;Torment.&quot; We get a nice appearance from Dr. Fitzgerald in that one...<br><br>But, anyway.

            <p>I just realized that we only know bits and pieces about the PPC City in New Caledonia. For example, we know there is the Musйe des Univers Perdus, an eating district, a door to HQ, a DIA division, a TARDIS dock, and a cemetery somewhere in town. Aside from that, we don’t know much else. The place seems somewhat underdeveloped and unimportant in the PPC universe.<br><br>With that said, can I interest anyone in a little world-building RP?<br><br>The scenario is simple: following a freak scheduling accident caused by a length of rope, a plastic inflatable shark, and an impressionable group of trained circus monkeys, dozens of agent teams suddenly found themselves with nothing to do for an entire day. Some of them decide to visit the PPC city to see the sights, eat the food, meet some friends, relax, or just goof around. <br><br>Now go forth, chronicle your agents’ day off, and flesh out New Caledonia!<br><br>…um, if anyone’s interested, that is. If so, maybe we could start it up on the Other Board to avoid clogging up this one.<br></p>

            <p>A while back I started, and nearly finished, a short interlude based on the &#39;what would your agents do in a Disney-related theme park&#39; thread...which could easily take place in New Caledonia, if people agree to placing a Disney-themed amusement park somewhere in there or nearby. Not sure how much it would be related to this RP, but...it could help with the world-building? And I could perhaps finish it by having the main agents I&#39;m using in it heading over to a restaurant of some sort or wandering around the city...<br><br>In fact, what if there was a permanent portal set up somewhere in the city that leads to a sort of generic Disneyworld/Disneyland? Anyone mind if I put that in? It would certainly explain what all the agents were doing there...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>You may or may not need to adjust the descriptions of Disneyland attractions to something a bit more like what a PPC affiliate would build, but since it would be a &quot;sort of generic&quot; Disneyland, it might be like that already.<br><br>As for the second thing, all of the agents just went to New Caledonia of their own accord for a day off. No portal mishaps or anything of the sort. If you were asking to have a free-standing plothole in the middle of the city that takes the agents to the theme park, well, you could, but it would be easier, more plausible, and less unstable to just have people walk over there, or at least use local transport.<br>It&#39;s a theme park, and the agents have a day off. They might want to go there anyway, if only to see what it&#39;s like, and they don&#39;t need to be pulled in dimensionally from across town. Then, when the agents finish going on the rides or eating theme park food, they could go somewhere else and immediately regret consuming said theme park food.<br><br>As an aside, since it&#39;s a PPC-themed generic theme park, I imagine that instead of the people dressed in Mickey Mouse or Foghorn Leghorn suits walking around traumatizing children, there would be a collection of dull-colored Generic Beast-costumed workers strolling around the park, staring at people with unblinking plastic eyes. Lumbering, unblinking facsimiles of potentially licensable characters are part of the theme park experience, no matter <i>how</i> many creepy dreams you have afterward!</p>

            <p>...how about a theme park in which the attractions are based off of various &#39;verses? There could be things like the Lost Woods maze from <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>, a <i>Star Trek</i> flight simulator (complete with Kobayashi Maru mode), a shooting gallery with weaponry from various continua, and so on. The possibilities are only limited by the (semi-insane) imaginations of the Agents!</p>

            <p>Now, which popular continua could easily be turned into a roller coaster? Stargate could make a fun one, since the theme would allow the cars to teleport after passing by certain sections.<br>Admittedly, that would be difficult to service if there was a problem in the middle of a ride, but I expect the dedicated New Caledonia Division of the DO has protocol for problems with sudden physics reassertion in the rides. Actually, it might be just as hard keeping the Skull Kids in the Lost Woods attraction from causing trouble. They&#39;d be on the payroll, of course, but there&#39;s only so long a guy like that can go without trapping some tourists in alternate universes or turning them into plant people.<br><br>Now, what else would make a good roller coaster? Every theme park needs at least two or three.</p>

            <p>There are two ways (that I know of anyway) to add links in a post.<br><br>The first is just to copy and paste the web address, in which case it will appear as a clickable link with the full title - like this: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki</a></a><br><br>The second is to use this handy bit of HTML code:<br><br>Type the text you want the link to appear as here (remove the Ј symbols to get it to actually work).<br><br>This allows you to <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">make the link appear as part of the normal text</a>, just like I&#39;ve done here. I find it particularly useful for long addresses, or things like Google Doc links which just look really messy as they&#39;re a string of random characters. </p>

            <p>But, to help out anyone who does, I thought I&#39;d throw you a list of the key references to New Cal. By &#39;key&#39; I mean the ones that tell you the most - if a ref only mentions something in passing which is more fully described elsewhere, I&#39;ll give the second.<br><br>This is also a good opportunity to pull all the information together for the purposes of adding references to the Wiki article...<br><br>*<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/New_Caledonia">The Wiki itself</a>. This gives a good overview of most things.<br><br>*<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1WpOpdT4j8hHeFLM1ZvFidJhla4skdr6Ts9rtkKCBtxw">Fallen Feathers: Nita</a>. About halfway down we get this:<br><br><i>She found herself the Rue Jay Thorntree, the main street of the New Caledonia, scowling at the sunlight as if it had offended her. Around her was a variety of hustle, bustle [...] she leant against the wall of the entrance to HQ (a building known, through the magic of PPC multilingual humour, as The Appetiser)...</i><br><br>There&#39;s also a mention of Club Aujourd&#39;hui (&quot;What do you do there?&quot; &quot;Mostly alcohol.&quot;) at the very end.<br><br>*<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1v4HKVdLZu_lfjnh29fja1kfYK67qqFGIftwPTvagmFw">PPC: Flight of Swans</a>. The second and fourth sub-stories are set in New Cal. The first only tells us that Agent Monty&#39;s pond is there. The second gives us a decent description of the Musйe des Univers Perdus:<br><br><i>Agent Penny was wandering through the streets of the PPC’s city in New Caledonia, just passing the time, really, when she heard an unusually loud voice. Screaming voices weren’t actually that uncommon around the PPC - the insanity levels were even higher than in Penny’s home city of Ankh-Morpork - but the content here wasn’t the usual obscenities.<br><br>“... the Doctor’s favourite book growing up! And oh, what’s this? It turns out it was the Racnoss! Oh, did I ruin that for you? Let’s get another one... the Lost Road Trilogy, by J.R.R. Tolkien! Forgotten when the Professor died, leaving it unwritten. And on the last page... well, fancy that. It seems Earendil was-”<br><br>Penny emerged into the plaza before the Musйe des Univers Perdus, took in the crowd of agents and associates gathered in front of it, and then her gaze joined with theirs and tracked up to the blue-skinned woman standing on the roof of the Musйe.<br><br>“... now this is rumoured to have been Cicero’s favourite book. Let’s see... oh, a murder mystery! And, would you credit it, it was her slave who did it? What is the world coming to?”<br><br>[...]<br><br>“Looks like they’re making another go of it,” she said. A handful of black-clad figures were sneaking across the [roof] tiles towards Starwind [...]<br><br>&quot;[...]is there a back way into the Musйe?”<br><br>“This is the PPC city,” she pointed out. “There’s back ways into everything...”</i><br><br>As for the original description of the Musйe, that comes from <a href="http://tawaki-ppc.livejournal.com/8524.html">here</a>:<br><br><i>Dustin and Five were leaving the Musйe des Univers Perdus, a museum of continua lost when the civilizations they were written in had fallen. (Works from the Roman Empire stood side by side with folktales from Sernpidal and Time Lord novels in its library and its bookstore.)</i><br><br>That same link notes that the pond is &#39;on the other side of town&#39; from the Musee.<br><br>*<a href="http://uncommon-comma.livejournal.com/8003.html">This</a>, <a href="http://tawaki-ppc.livejournal.com/7565.html">this</a> and <a href="http://tawaki-ppc.livejournal.com/6044.html">this</a> all mention the <i>Tour Prend Pion</i> pawnshop. The second establishes that it&#39;s possible to park a TARDIS opposite it, but to be honest I think Tawaki&#39;s agents just parked them wherever they chose. That link does also note that the TARDIS dock (singular) was newly-opened at that point.<br><br>The third link provides an address for <i>Tour Prend Pion</i>: 104 Rue Fait-des-Choses du Nord (ie, it&#39;s on the northern half of &#39;Makes-Things Road&#39;). It also provides us with &#39;the corner of the Rue Dafydd Illian and the Rue Imbolc Telyan, by the hospital&#39;, which I guess is a local section of Medical (and maybe FicPsych?). It also gives us this:<br><br><i>Tawaki walked down the Rue des Fleurs, trying hard to resist the urge to ignore his destination. That works in PPC HQ, but not on Earth. Besides, the city is so regularly laid-out that getting lost is well nigh impossible, unless you happen to be looking for a strange TARDIS. Tawaki was looking for a familiar one. He reached the corner of the Rue des Fleurs and the Rue Imbolc Telyan and turned left. It was another two blocks to the Rue Jay Thorntree.</i><br><br>Which both points out that navigation is different there, and gives a hint of a map. And then there&#39;s this:<br><br><i>Eclectica read the message. “&#39;Tadkeeta, and Tawaki if you are with her, report to the field just south of the cemetery hill at once. Signed, the Yertis, Deputy Head of the Department of Internal Affairs.&#39;” So saying, she moved the TARDIS to the hill. Tawaki and Tadkeeta left the TARDIS, which had become a large headstone with the inscription:<br><br>“SACRЙE А LA MЙMOIRE DE<br>“FAIT-DES-CHOSES<br>“NЙ 30 JUIN 1954<br>“MORT 13 MARS 2008 <br>“LOIN EN AVANT<br>“LA ROUTE EST PARVENUE”<br><br>In fact, it was a perfect replica of Makes-Things&#39; memorial stone. However, it was at the base of the cliff, while Makes-Things&#39; stone was on top of the hill.<br><br>[...]<br><br>They entered the farmhouse and met Agents Honesah and Ontic from the mirror multiverse, with the Yertis, the Corkscrew Cattail, and Captain Dandy.</i><br><br>That gives the general layout of the cemetary area, and also provides the farmhouse, which is either a safehouse for Honesah and mirror!Ontic, or the New Cal DIA headquarters.<br><br>*<a href="http://tawaki-ppc.livejournal.com/7955.html#cutid1">This</a> provides us the following:<br><br><i>And it is not in the TARDIS dock, but at the corner of the Rue Jay Thorntree and the Rue Ella Darcy.”<br><br>“Down by the park where Misplaced Flora and Fauna found those feral squees?”.<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>Ten minutes later, they arrived at said park, and Dustin flew low enough to drop her safely. He then alighted by a brook.</i><br><br>*<a href="http://tawaki-ppc.livejournal.com/10219.html#cutid1">This</a> might imply that there&#39;s a Nursery in New Cal. It&#39;s sort of unclear.<br><br>*<a href="http://warrior-joe.livejournal.com/4372.html">This</a> provides us a look inside Big Murphy&#39;s store:<br><br><i>“Right you are,” Big Murphy replied, leaning over the store counter. “Agent Marcus Langston brought the set to me - Department of Floaters, like you two. [...] I took one out back and tried running it over with a truck. Didn’t even scratch the finish.” He smiled broadly. “Of course, that means they don’t come cheap…”</i><br><br>It also notes that &#39;Several minutes later, both agents were walking down a surprisingly crowded hallway in HQ&#39;, which suggests Big Murphy&#39;s store is fairly close to the door back inside.<br><br>*<a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndSlope.htm%22">By 2024</a>, the City will have agents living in it with their children.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>That appears to be all I can find right now. Anyone got any other links and information?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Oh, another one? Goody goody! Here, take this magical urple box. It has an Engorgement Charm placed on it. For your permission request, you do have to be quite active on the Board to get Permission. Also, you might want to stick around for at least half a year to get us to know you. Since I&#39;m quite new (I joined just a week ago), you can also choose to take advice from oldbies. Have fun here!<br><br>Autumn</p>

            <p>The rule is, &quot;wait to ask for Permission until a) you&#39;ve been active long enough for the community (including PGs) to get to know you, b) you&#39;ve proven that you have a solid grasp on the community spirit and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">Da Rules</a>, and c) you feel confident that you know what you&#39;re doing and can effectively demonstrate it with your Permission request.&quot;<br><br>How long that takes for each individual varies quite a bit. I will say it&#39;s extremely unlikely that anyone could get Permission within a week of their introduction, but we&#39;ve had people blow us away with their awesomeness in as little as two to three weeks, and we&#39;ve had people like me who waited <i>years</i> before they personally felt ready to start writing anything. I actually think multiple months is more likely the norm for when is a good time.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Greetings, new friend!  Have a potted Poison Joke!<br><br>Now, I do need to mention a couple of things.  Firstly, make sure you double-check your writing before you hit &quot;post,&quot; to make sure everything that needs punctuation and capitalization has it.  We&#39;re a writing community, and we take pride in making the effort to keep our grammar sharp!<br><br>Also, when you do eventually write missions, keep in mind that the idea is to find badfics that can be made humorous.  Otherwise, the mission would just turn into a list of deviations from canon, and that wouldn&#39;t be any fun to read!</p>

            <p>here is another shiny newbie to be showered with gifts.<br><br><b>Proactive answers to FAQs:</b><br><br>I found the PPC in early 2012, when I wondered why <i>If I Am Ever Head of an Alien Monitoring Agency</i>, I should keep good relations to the Protectors of the Plot Continuum as well as to the Men in Black and Torchwood. <br><br>How I found this derivative of The Evil Overlord’s List is a long story, starting with my daughter listening to a Harry Potter audio book thirteen years ago, and including my discovery of the <i>Harry Potter Lexicon Forum</i> in 2007, some persons on this forum (Freshwater and Potteraholic) pointing me to <i>Mark Reads Harry Potter</i> in 2010 and Mark or some commenter on <i>Mark Reads ...</i> or <i>Mark Watches ...</i> mentioning genre-savvyness and linking to <i>tv tropes</i>.   <br><br>Yes, I read the Constitution – twice (it had changed meanwhile). <br><br>I also read the FAQs, TOS, OFUM, HFA, the Handbook, the Manual, everything linked on <i>The Complete List of PPC Fiction</i> and some other stuff more difficult to find.<br><br>So, my fandoms are essentially Harry Potter and – the PPC. <br><br>I also like Middle-earth, but since I read <i>The Silmarillion</i>, <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> only in translations which may not be accurate, I never read any of the stuff published later, I didn’t bother to learn Sindarin or Quenya, and my ancient German paperback-edition of <i>Der Herr der Ringe</i> doesn’t even have all the appendices, I cannot rightfully call myself a fan.<br><br>Funny fact: Before I found the PPC, I didn’t read fan fiction (making very few exceptions) because, “if it is bad, it’s a waste of time, and if it is good, it may damage my precious memories; it’s hard enough to remember what was only in the movies, I don’t need more contamination”. I changed my mind. Reading badfic to laugh about the atrocities may be entertaining, but watching agents struggling with the badfic is even more fun.<br><br><b>Why I shouldn’t join the PPC:</b><br><br>It is hard work to say something coherent in this foreign language, and I am never sure whether I really said what I intended to say.<br><br>Even reading in this language and looking up words to make sure that I understood everything consumes too much of my time.<br><br>I am far above the average age here. My wife already frowns on me when I engage in serious discussions of a “children’s book”, I don’t know what she will say if she finds me having too much fun with young women.<br><br>All of this probably means: Don’t expect to see much of me, don’t expect fast responses, and never expect to see me on the IRC, because I’m unable to communicate in real time.<br><br><b>Beta offer:</b><br><br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=246621;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Calling out the agents for their lack of canon knowledge</a> was the very first thing I ever did on this board, so I obviously have to do this now:<br>I’m willing to read any mission in the Potterverse to check for canon accuracy. Of course I will try to point out other problems as well, but I’m probably not very good at this. <br>Also, if you ever need a native krautpicker, here’s your man.<br><br>Some contact information will be up soon on my page on the Wiki. Or it may be not so soon (see above), but it’s the next thing I should do, right?<br><br><b>My random questions:</b><br><br>I see some links here on a grey background. Should this tell me something? Probably new comments, but I <b>did</b> read some of them yesterday, and it doesn’t happen when the whole thread is new?<br><br>Is Darkover a quarantined world or just forgotten?<br><br>On top of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Complete_List_of_PPC_Fiction">The Complete List of PPC Fiction</a>, it says<br><blockquote>The original list <a href="http://the-ppc.livejournal.com/18564.html">may be found here.</a> If it is not up-to-date, please leave a comment on the LiveJournal List telling Araeph what needs to be changed.</blockquote>
<br>Is Araeph still around? The last comment on her LiveJournal List is more than three years old. Should we drop this line and admit that Araeph’s List is not longer maintained, or should somebody (aka me) try to comment telling all the differences between this list and the Wiki?<br><br>It also says<br><blockquote>Anyone with Permission may update a mission count, introduce a new spin-off, or make a note about a particular series. </blockquote>
<br>I understand that anyone with Permission could and should add their agents and keep their mission count up to date. But I need some clarification. Supposed I had Permission and found other authors mission reports on their LiveJournals or agent’s pages or anywhere else, could I link them on <i>The (In)Complete List of PPC Fiction</i> to make it more complete, or should this decision be left to the respective authors? If I could, why would I need Permission to do this?<br><br>I’m not planning anything, but I would like to see some opinions concerning the Flowers dedication. Supposed the agents didn’t charge for a break of canon, because they agree with the suethor and a significant fraction of the fandom that this specific part of canon is stupid, they obviously have to be punished. But would the punishment be less harsh if even the Flowers agreed that this part of canon is stupid? Or could the Flowers never agree, because protecting the canon is the essence of their life and their only reason to exist?<br><br>The <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=246661;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">original example</a> of ”stupid canon” was Midi-Chlorians in Star Wars. May “elvish reincarnation” in Tolkienverse be another example? I don’t intend to offend Luthien (a very special case) or Dafydd Illian (another special case) or even Glorfindel of Gondolin and Imladris, if they aren’t two persons (everybody who died killing a Balrog deserves a second chance). But there seems to be a concept of every elf killed in battle being able to come back from Mandos’ Halls. Where does this come from? <i>Unfinished Tales</i>? <i>History of Middle-earth</i>? <i>Hurin’s Children</i>? Tolkien’s L.O.S.I.N.T.B.U?  <br><br>Specifically to KittyNoodles and SpectacularSC:<br>-   Will we ever see a third chapter of OFUA?<br>-  Are applications still open?<br>-   Don’t you get into trouble for interactivity when students apply via comments?<br>-   So can I apply here?<br></p>

            <p>hS beat me to the punch, so I&#39;ll just fill in my two cents regarding the (In)Complete List:<br><br>Araeph is still around sometimes, but busy with Real Life type stuff. You could definitely ask her how she feels about striking that line from the wiki article.<br><br>As for adding other people&#39;s spin-offs to the wiki, in general I&#39;d say go for it. The only caveat is that if they themselves don&#39;t have Permission (or if they <i>shouldn&#39;t</i> have Permission), their spin-off(s) probably shouldn&#39;t be added. I&#39;ve noticed one or two dubious-looking spin-offs recently, while trawling through fanfiction.net looking for the history of the Department of Floaters. One guy, name of Who&#39;s Asking, claims that he got Permission, but has a line in his bio stating that &quot;Yaoi is shit, 100 of the time&quot; is an &quot;undeniable truth,&quot; and some other unsavory things, so... ick. We might want to put up something to the effect that we <i>don&#39;t</i> condone that sort of thing, a la <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Gabriella">Gabriella</a> and her cohorts (see <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Out_of_Continuity">Out of Continuity</a>), but beyond that, I think I speak for all of us when I say Do Not Want.<br><br>Maybe undocumented spin-offs should be brought up with the Board before they get added?<br><br>I think the line about Permission is just supposed to apply to adding/updating your own stuff. If you don&#39;t have Permission, you shouldn&#39;t be updating your mission count or adding a new spin-off, because you shouldn&#39;t have one in the first place.<br><br>Oh, and definitely make a page for yourself, especially if you plan to join the Grand Editing Cabal. ... Okay, there is no Grand Editing Cabal. But there could be. &gt;.&gt; Anyway, help is always appreciated, especially with an attentive eye like yours. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh, who is 28 and married to fellow-Boarder Phobos, for what it&#39;s worth.</p>

            <p>Or, er, hello again! And Welcome Officially A&#39;Board!<br><br>That is... one heck of an intro post. I&#39;m seriously impressed. And since I&#39;m here, I&#39;ll answer/respond to some of your points.<br><br>-Anyone who has even watched and enjoyed the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> movies can call themselves a fan. My wife has never read the Silmarillion, but try telling <i>her</i> she&#39;s not a fan! It&#39;s great fun to learn the languages and read the Histories (I&#39;ve done both), but it&#39;s not required.<br><br>-Good fanfic is fun to read too! Good fanfic should expand on the original, not damage it. A good example for a Middle-earth fan is <a href="http://rustbucket.net/leithian/">The Leithian Script</a>, which is a dramatic telling of the story of Beren and Luthien. It&#39;s incredibly long, and it has shaped a lot of my perception of Valinor and Beleriand, in ways which Tolkien didn&#39;t give us a lot to go on.<br><br>-I hadn&#39;t actually realised that you were working in a foreign language. As far as I can tell, nothing you&#39;ve said has given the wrong impression - so well done.<br><br>-I&#39;m not actually sure what the average age is on the Board any more. It used to be around fourteen, but while there&#39;s still some people around that young (and occasionally younger!) a lot of us are up in our twenties now. I believe in the past we&#39;ve had people on here who are grandparents - there&#39;s no age limits, believe me.<br><br>-While it used to be the case that most Boarders were female (I remember when there were... lessee, AW, Dann, Leto, Elcalion, me... about five males, total, in the PPC), I think the split is a lot more equal these days.<br><br>-The grey links: the way those work is that everything posted in the last day on a thread older than 24 hours will be grey. So a new thread will have no grey replies for a full day, but after that, each reply will stay grey for 24 hours. It&#39;s quite useful on a slowish Board like this one - you can skim the front page once a day and see exactly what&#39;s new.<br><br>-Araeph is still around sometimes. I&#39;m not actually sure if she&#39;s updating the Complete List, though.<br><br>-The wiki version ought to be up to date at all times (even though it isn&#39;t). I think this is more a question for Unofficial Wiki Queen Neshomeh, but as far as I&#39;m aware, if you find something that&#39;s not on there, you can add it. I don&#39;t know about it requiring Permission - it might be a quality control measure, or it might simply be a leftover bit of text from some earlier version.<br><br>-Your punishment question: this is really two questions, which I&#39;ll answer separately.<br><br>--How would this be written? Most of the time, it wouldn&#39;t be. If a PPC writer thinks something is &#39;canonical enough&#39; that they don&#39;t write a charge for it, they probably won&#39;t write the Flowers telling their agents off. Equally, in cases where the agents specifically say &#39;well, it&#39;s a breach, but I prefer it&#39;, there won&#39;t be any consequences simply because the author doesn&#39;t create them.<br><br>--How would this in theory work? Well, assuming the Flowers became aware of it, I doubt they&#39;d care. The charge list is a means to an end - it&#39;s a way of checking that the character being killed/story being sporked is actually <i>bad</i>. Leaving off a charge but still killing the story has no effect - and, as recently discussed, there&#39;s more to a Mary Sue than merely breaking canon. A well-written story which just disagrees with some aspects of canon is an AU.<br><br>But imagining a story which is clearly, say, the business of the Department of Implausible AUs, only the agent decides they prefer it that way and lets the story keep on existing - then, the Flowers might have something to say. What it is would depend on, as ever, what&#39;s funnier - a hardline Flower, or one who says <i>Yes, agent, I actually agree with you on that score - but I still have to punish you</i>.<br><br>-Elvish reincarnation: there&#39;s actually a fair number of sources for this one. Obviously Luthien is in the Silm, but so is Finrod (after his death scene, we read that he was restored to life and now lives with his father). I don&#39;t remember how much of the story of Finwe and Miriel ended up in the Silmarillion, but the reason Finwe was allowed to remarry is that Miriel declared that she would never return to life.<br><br>There is more on this subject - a lot more - in the Histories, which basically contain most of Tolkien&#39;s working notes and essays. He played around with two ideas: reincarnation along the Luthien lines, where the spirit is given a new body modelled after the old, and rebirth, where they are born to new parents, and eventually regain their memories. I think he eventually settled on the former.<br><br>Somewhere - I don&#39;t remember where - the idea comes along that the rebellious elves - that is, the Noldor who went into exile, and possibly the Sindar, Nandor, Avari and other elves who either gave up on the March or never joined it, and thus never reached Valinor - wouldn&#39;t be allowed to leave the Halls of Mandos for a very long time. Finrod is the canonical exception to this, but in general, the idea that they could just pop straight back out is a false one.<br><br>That said, the <i>idea</i> fits very well in Middle-earth. Men are mortal, and their spirits pass beyond the world when the die. Elves are immortal, but their spirits are bound to the world. They don&#39;t have an &#39;elsewhere&#39; to go to - this world is all they get. But they are immortal in the lifetime of the world; why shouldn&#39;t they be reembodied so they can continue that life? Particularly in pre-Rebellion Valinor, when the only cause of death was accidents (it doesn&#39;t seem to have ever happened, but the possibility was always there).<br><br>-I believe Tolkien&#39;s final decision was that there was only one Glorfindel. That&#39;s in the Histories, too.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don’t remember Miriel declaring that she would never return to life in the Silmarillion, but then I didn’t remember Finrod being restored to life and living with his father (good reasons to re-read the Silmarillion). So I thought Luthien, being half Maia, was the big exception. It’s actually what made immortality undesirable for me: You may live “forever”, but when you are killed by force or by an accident, you neither seize to exist, nor are you allowed to pass on, you are just stick in the Halls of Mandos until the world ends.<br><br>When I read that all elves who “died” could, and actually did, return to life(*), this seemed to take away from the horrors of the ancient wars. It was terrible for the humans who fought on both sides, but for the elves, it was more like a video game: Bing, you are dead, return to last save place? <br><br>Making the fallen warriors stay in Mandos’ Halls for an age or two, before they can return to enjoy their eternal life in the rest of Valinor, seems to be a good solution. Not “worse than death”, but horrible enough.<br><br>(*) I vaguely remember to have seen similar claims in other places, but my actual reference was a comment to <i>Don’t Panic</i>, so you see, I started to read legendary goodfic. Yes, I also read the comments. I’m weird. Being weird is required for the PPC, isn’t it?<br></p>

            <p>... the canonical reason death is &#39;the Gift of Men&#39;, and immortality has its downsides, is that the Eldar grow weary of life. They are stuck here for the lifetime of the world, whether they&#39;re in the Halls of Waiting or upstairs in Aman. Apparently, it starts to wear thin - they want to leave - but they can&#39;t. And they have to face the prospect of ages and ages to come in which it just gets worse.<br><br>Men, in contrast, get one short life - but then they go <i>somewhere else</i>. They aren&#39;t bound to the earth like the Eldar - and, given that Tolkien was Catholic, and since he never said what happens to Men, it&#39;s reasonable to suppose the &#39;somewhere else&#39; is something like the Christian heaven. That is to say, they go to live with Iluvatar - which one assumes is a good thing. ;)<br><br>The big exception that was made with Luthien wasn&#39;t that she was allowed to return to life - it was that she (and her descendent Arwen) were given the chance to <i>accept the Gift of Men</i>. They were allowed to become mortal, to live out a mortal lifespan - and then to leave the world behind and go on to whatever awaits mankind afterwards. The Elves still mourn the second death of Luthien, not because she died - but because she, alone of the Elven people, left the world entirely. As far as they know*, her family, friends, everyone, will never see her again. She is out there in the Timeless Halls, and they are stuck on their little world, until both it and they die together.<br><br>*Well, Finrod has other ideas. But he&#39;s a funny one.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Trying to retranslate from German, last paragraph of first chapter of <i>Quenta Silmarillion</i>: <blockquote>... For the elves do not die, as long as the world does not die, unless they are slain or pine away in sorrow (by these two forms of apparent death they are consumed); ...  and to perish they gather in Mandos’ Halls in Valinor, from where, when time comes, they may return. </blockquote>It is also said (paraphrasing) that humans will play along in the Second Music of the Ainur, but even the Valar do not know what Ilъvatar intends to do with the elves after the world’s end.<br><br>So, “when time comes” doesn’t refer to the world’s end, and “they may return” means actually “return to live in Aman”, not a vague possibility that, when the world ends, everything including the elves may return to wherever the whole creation came from?<br><br> Of course the German text may be completely wrong, because the attempt to be poetic limits the choice of words and the translator couldn’t know more than had been published at the time. (I have my experience there. German Harry Potter never mentions chivalry as an important Gryffindor trait, apparently because it didn’t fit into the German Sorting Hat’s songs. And it confuses the readers by using the same German word for “robes” and for “cloak”, which becomes hilarious when Mr. Weasley pulls another robescloak over his cloakrobes.)<br><br>In chapter six of <i>Quenta Silmarillion</i>, Miriel said that she would never bear a child again, because all her strength had gone into Feanor, and that she was tired. While Miriel apparently slept in the gardens of Lуrien, the spirit left her body and went silently to the Halls of Mandos. No promise was made on page, and it seems that nobody except herself even expected her to die. When Finwe married Indis on the next page, Feanor didn’t like this, but Miriel’s spirit still existing in Mandos’ Halls didn’t seem to be a problem.<br><br>When the dying Finrod spoke to Beren, he said something like “Much time will pass until I am seen again by the Noldor, and it may be that we both do not meet again in death or life, for our races’ destinies are different. Farewell!” So he may expect to return to Aman, if not Middle-earth, or he may refer to the unknown plans Ilъvatar may have for the elves after the world&#39;s end. (Finrod apparently doesn’t believe that it is impossible to meet a human “in death”, is this why you called him “a funny one”?)<br><br>Ah, here it is, on the next but one page (trying my translational skills again): <blockquote>Felagunds corpse they buried on the highest hill of his island, now pure again; and the green grave, where rests Finrod, Finarfin’s son, fairest of the elven princes, stayed untouched, until the land was turned and broken und sunk into crushing seas.  But Finrod strolls with Finarfin, his father, under the trees of Endamar. </blockquote>It is such a casual reference. Obviously I never took this serious, or I thought it meant that Finrod lived on in his father’s memory and could not be forgotten, even if everybody who knew him in Middle-earth should die. <br><br>So my confidence is restored. I <b>do</b> remember the canon I know. And Three-Book-Tolkienverse worked quite well for me, until I found the PPC, where agents shout “Sex is marriage” and “Elves aren’t abusive” and “There is no forced marriage in Midle-earth”, which all sounds quite plausible based on general characterizations, but was never really said in the books I read. And there seems to be some counter-evidence that needs further explanation. <br><br>Eol the dark elf is clearly an exception, and again the German text may be completely wrong, but to me, Aredhel’s fate sounds much like a politely concealed marriage-by-rape, so forced marriage is not unheard of (although this is not what is generally meant by the term). Thingol would never force his daughter to marry a man who only suits <b>him</b> for political or economical reasons, but what he did comes uncomfortably close to this. And locking her up should not be called abusive because it was only done to prevent her from being killed in an attempt to help Beren?<br><br>Obviously the Silmarillion is not the last word on all this. So you see now why I don’t dare to call myself a fan in the PPC? I deliberately ignored half of the canon by not reading every book, and what I believe to know is actually the translator’s canon, not Tolkien’s.</p>

            <p>So thank you for giving me an opportunity...<br><br>Your re-translation seems to be pretty accurate to the <i>Silmarillion</i>. In your first quote, I can see how that could be read either way - I&#39;ve always read it as a &#39;when they&#39;re allowed out&#39;. It&#39;s &#39;may&#39; as in &#39;will be permitted&#39;, not &#39;may&#39; as in &#39;maybe&#39;. As the book says, no-one but Ilъvatar knows what will happen to the Eldar at the end of the world - and since the <i>Quenta Silmarillion</i> is framed as an Elvish account of their history, they certainly wouldn&#39;t have put a &#39;maybe&#39; in when they didn&#39;t know anything. So it&#39;s a &#39;when they&#39;re allowed&#39;.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>It&#39;s interesting - and a bit depressing - that so much of the story of Finwe and Miriel is dropped from the published Silmarillion. The story, in brief, is that after Miriel goes to Lorien and dies, Finwe is quite happy to wait for her to be reembodied (because why shouldn&#39;t she?). But time passes and passes, and eventually Finwe goes to the Valar and says &#39;I still want to have more children, but my wife is refusing to leave Mandos. Can I remarry?&#39;. There&#39;s a <i>massive</i> debate over this (and actually still is - the Eldar still argue about whether Finwe&#39;s second marriage was the cause of everything that later went wrong), with the result being that Finwe can remarry, provided Miriel confirms that she will <i>never</i> leave Mandos. Which she does. The principle is that an Elf cannot have two spouses on the earth, because that&#39;s icky, but if one of them is never coming back...<br><br>Still, that was essentially special dispensation for Finwe alone. It&#39;s never invoked again. Most of this, since it&#39;s not in the Silm, is from <i>The Statute of Finwe and Miriel</i>, somewhere in the Histories of Middle-earth.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Oh, Finrod... Finrod is awesome, he is far and away my favourite character in the Silmarillion. One of the reasons is that &#39;maybe&#39; in his farewell to Beren.<br><br>The thing is, Finrod claimed to have been sent a vision. This is separate to the vision from Ulmo telling him to found Nargothrond (at the same time as Turgon was sent to build Gondolin). At some point, Finrod began to claim that he had been granted a vision of the world after the End of Days. He claimed this:<br><br><i>&quot;Ah, wise lady!&quot; said Finrod. &quot;I am an Elda, and again I was thinking of my own people. But nay, of all the Children of Eru. I was thinking that by the Second Children we might have been delibered from death. For ever as we spoke of death being a division of the united [ie, body and soul], I thought in my heard of a death that is not so: but the ending together of both. For that is what lies before us [elves], so far as our reason could see: the completion of Arda and its end, and therefore also of us children of Arda; the end when all the long lives of the Elves shall be wholly in the past.<br><br>&quot;And then suddenly I beheld as a vision Arda Remade; and there the Eldar completed but not ended could abide in the present for ever, and there walk, maybe, with the Children of Men, their deliverers, and sing to them such songs as, even in the Bliss beyond bliss, should make the green valleys ring and the everlasting mountain-tops to throb like harps.&quot;</i><br><br>Which is a <i>wild</i> departure from Elven orthodoxy, and sets the &#39;Secondborn&#39;, the &#39;Latecomers&#39;, the &#39;Sickly Ones&#39; - in short, mortal men - up as the deliverers of the Elves. It&#39;s a powerful vision, presented with Finrod&#39;s uniquely enthusiastic voice - and all that made it into the <i>Silmarillion</i> was &#39;maybe&#39;!<br><br>(That&#39;s an excerpt from the <i>Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth</i>, a conversation between Finrod and a mortal woman on various matters of death and mortality. Also from the Histories)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>As to the three things that agents shout:<br><br>-&quot;Sex is marriage!&quot;<br>--Another <i>Histories of Middle-earth</i> reference. This comes from LACE - the Laws and Customs of the Eldar. It outlines the process of the Eldarin betrothal and marriage ceremonies, but goes on to state that all of those are understood to be purely ceremonial and for the families: the actual physical act is what matters, to the point where Elves &#39;on the run&#39; are able to get married hiding out in the woods. As one of my agents will say when his mission gets finished, &quot;Well, in Quenya, she&#39;s definitely your wife.&quot;<br><br>-&quot;Elves aren’t abusive!&quot;<br>--This is a flat-out lie. :P <i>Most</i> Elves that we know of aren&#39;t abusive, but both Feanor and Eol definitely engaged in (at minimum) emotional abuse of their spouses. However, from reading their characters we do know that <i>Elrond</i> isn&#39;t abusive, and neither is Thranduil, which covers about 95% of the cases that show up in missions.<br><br>-&quot;There is no forced marriage in Midle-earth!&quot;<br>--Definitely and canonically untrue amongst Men - Tar-Miriel of Numenor was forced to marry (and give up the Sceptre to) her cousin Ar-Pharazon.<br>--The marriage of Eol and Aredhel was rather more explicitly a forced marriage in earlier drafts; apparently Tolkien toned it down somewhat to make it more of a &#39;he kept her in his house and eventually she chose to marry him&#39;. But Eol is The Dark Elf anyway - he&#39;s well and truly under the Shadow. The principle we tend to operate on is that he was an isolated incident; the <i>institutional</i> forced, often political marriages that show up so often in fanfic were definitely not a thing among the Eldar.<br>---Actually, I think there&#39;s further comments in LACE to that effect. They point out that the Eldar marry for love, not for political reasons, and that although sometimes people pine over a spouse they didn&#39;t get, they don&#39;t go in for forced marriages. I&#39;m pulling this from vague memories, though.<br>--Thingol was... rather messed up. I think he definitely would never have forced Luthien <i>to</i> marry someone, but he was clearly comfortable with forcing her <i>not</i> to. Actually, in various drafts of the tale of Beren and Luthien, either Curufin or Celegorm plans to (presumably forcibly) marry Luthien... so yes, forced marriage is a thing, but only among evil characters, and only in isolated cases. We <i>know</i> which characters are evil; the ones who usually end up doing this aren&#39;t them.<br>---I&#39;m not sure whether locking a child up to stop them doing something (you see as) stupid is abuse per se... I think it just comes under bad parenting. Again, if a character is being locked up by a parent in badfic, it&#39;s usually as <i>punishment</i>, not simply as a way to stop them leaving. But I guess this one is debatable. I&#39;m not overly fond of Thingol anyway, so it doesn&#39;t bother me either way. ;)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>There are really only a handful of people in the PPC who have this in-depth knowledge of the Silmarillion and the Histories. Most people who would call themselves LotR fans don&#39;t have it - and that&#39;s absolutely fine! If I insisted everyone had to be as obsessive as me, we&#39;d never get anything done...<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: If you&#39;re interested in reading the &#39;Statute&#39;, &#39;Athrabeth&#39; and &#39;LACE&#39;, they&#39;re all in the tenth book of the Histories of Middle-earth: <i>Morgoth&#39;s Ring</i>. That&#39;s also the book where Christopher collected Tolkien&#39;s thoughts on the nature of Orcs. If I were recommending one volume of <i>HoME</i>, it would be that one. ~hS</p>

            <p>Just to speak on behalf of ardent Tolkien fans who haven&#39;t read much outside the &quot;big three&quot; of <i>The Hobbit</i>, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, and <i>The Silmarillion</i> (though I&#39;ve recently made a start on <i>Unfinished Tales</i>).<br><br>At first, I was a bit overawed by the people like hS who know more about Middle-earth than I do, since my knowledge at the time was ridiculously in-depth by most &quot;normal&quot; people&#39;s standards. For the purposes of PPC missions, though, you don&#39;t really need to know more than what you can reasonably expect the fic&#39;s author to know. If the fic is based solely on the movies, you only need to know the movies to know what&#39;s reasonable in the movieverse. If they&#39;re blending book and movie canon and clearly making references to things that come from <i>The Silmarillion</i>, then it&#39;s acceptable to use LotR and <i>Silm</i> knowledge in critiquing it.<br><br>It <i>shouldn&#39;t</i> be acceptable to expect the average fic writer to have read <i>The Silmarillion</i> and the Histories and the Tales and and and. We do sometimes get a little carried away when it comes to the things we&#39;re passionate about, though.<br><br>Anyway, the point is, you can be a fan in whatever scope works for you. It&#39;s not anyone&#39;s place to judge your fanhood based on what works have or haven&#39;t been available to you for whatever reason. If you&#39;re gonna write a fic centering on an Elven marriage, though, it <i>does</i> behoove you to learn exactly how Elven marriages work first. {= )<br><br>And, to say something about the actual conversation, I never got the impression from <i>Silm</i> that Elves could reincarnate willy-nilly. Luthien (and apparently Glorfindel? I thought that was one of those eternal debates, like Balrogs and wings) was the exception, and she only got to come back on the condition that she would now be mortal (although still very long-lived). For everyone else, their spirits continue to exist in Mandos, and they might get to have bodies again when the world is remade, but in 99% of cases, they only get one body, and if that&#39;s destroyed, it&#39;s game over and they&#39;re stuck on the sidelines until the end of the world.<br><br>I do definitely remember some talk about marrying people off to secure alliances, too. I don&#39;t recall if anything came of it, but it was certainly discussed, by Elves, as a thing that could happen.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I’m just careful to say this not too loud here (and that’s a joke further explained in my response to Huinesoron above this).<br><br>If I were a Gary Stu in Middle-earth, I would try to defend myself by shouting back “Canon is what the author <b>published</b> about this world, not everything he scribbled on a sheet of paper!” (Unfortunately for the ‘Stu this makes <i>The Silmarillion</i> non-canon, and – woosh – all the wonderful examples of elves whose behavior is at least questionable are gone.) So yes, he should be nailed on what he should have known from his sources.<br><br>From what I read in <i>The Silmarillion</i>, Luthien was given a choice. She could return to eternal life, but then Beren would have to pass on, or she and Beren could return to human life-spans together. But I wasn’t sure whether Luthien was “really dead” or, being half-maia, had found some other way to go to Mandos and bargain with Nбmo.  </p>

            <p>It would be interesting to see a dialogue like that between agents and Suvian. I&#39;ll keep it in mind in case I ever have a good opportunity to use it.<br><br>As for Lъthien, I think that&#39;s almost right. Here&#39;s what my copy of <i>Silm</i> says:<br><br><i>These were the choices that he </i>[Manwл]<i> gave to Lъthien. Because of her labors and her sorrow, she should be released from Mandos, and go to Valimar, there to dwell until the world&#39;s end among the Valar, forgetting all griefs that her life had known. Thither Beren could not come. For it was not permitted to the Valar to withhold Death from him, which is the gift of Ilъvatar to Men. But the other choice was this: that she might return to Middle-earth, and take with her Beren, there to dwell again, but without certitude of life or joy. Then she would become mortal, and subject to a second death, even as he; and ere long she would leave the world for ever, and her beauty become only a memory in song.</i><br><br><i>This doom she chose, forsaking the Blessed Realm, and putting aside all claim to kinship with those that dwell there; that thus whatever grief might lie in wait, the fates of Beren and Lъthien might be joined, and their paths lead together beyond the confines of the world.</i><br><br>So, Lъthien could never go back to Middle-earth as an immortal, but she could have a sort of life in the city of Valimar in Valinor—but without Beren, who must someday die and leave the world. Or, she could return to Middle-earth with Beren, but only as a mortal like him.<br><br>It&#39;s also important to note that Lъthien was only given her choice because she sang to Nбmo Mandos, and her song was so fair and sorrowful that &quot;Mandos was moved to pity, who never before was so moved, nor has been since.&quot; No one but Lъthien could do this. So, Mandos went to Manwл for advice, and Manwл revealed the will of Ilъvatar, as above.<br><br>Lъthien does give some justification to singing Sues in Middle-earth, though. Music is of course the fabric of which Arda was woven, and songs have power—especially if you&#39;re the immortal child of Elf and Maia. Not so much if it&#39;s pop music and you have to wreck other people&#39;s stories to have yours, though...<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Since I&#39;m now at home and have access to <i>Morgoth&#39;s Ring</i>.<br><br>On death and reincarnation:<br><br><i>It was in Aman that they learned of Manwe that each </i>fea<i> [spirit] was imperishable within the life of Arda, and that its fate was to inhabit Arda to the end. Those </i>fear<i>, therefore, that in the marring of Arda suffered unnaturally a divorce from their </i>hroar<i> [bodies] remained still in Arda and in Time. But in this state they were open to the direct instruction and command of the Valar. As soon as they were disembodied they were summoned to leave the places of their life and death and go to the &#39;Halls of Waiting&#39;: Mandos, in the realm of the Valar.<br><br>If they obeyed this summons different opportunities lay before them. The length of time that they dwelt in Waiting was partly at the will of Namo the Judge, lord of Mandos, partly at their own will. The happiest fortune, they deemed, was after the Waiting to be re-born, for so the evil and grief that they had suffered in the curtailment of their natural course might be redressed.</i><br><br>I think the keystone of this idea is the opinion that death, among the Eldar, was never meant to happen. Unlike mortal folk, the forcible separation of Eldarin spirit from body is entirely a result of the Marring of Arda. Since the purpose of the Valar is to try and counteract the Marring and Morgoth, it follows that they&#39;d want to get the dead back to life as soon as they were ready. The fact that the reembodiment comes both from the will of the Judge (therefore presumably punishment) and from their own will (therefore psychological readiness) is very interesting. Oh, here:<br><br><i>For there was, for all the </i>fear<i> of the Dead, a time of Waiting, in which, howsoever they had died, they were corrected, instructed, strengthened, or comforted, according to their needs or deserts. </i>If they would consent to this.<i> But the </i>fea<i> in its nakedness is obdurate, and remains long in the bondage of its memory and old purposes (especially if these were evil).<br><br>Those who were healed could be re-born, if they desired it: none are re-born or sent back into life unwilling. The others remained, by desire or command, </i>fear<i> unbodied, and they could only observe the unfolding of the Tale of Arda from afar, having no effect therein.</i><br><br>(Really, I love this book)<br><br>In the interests of full disclosure, I will note that in the text quoted, Tolkien says that being born to another set of parents is (virtually) the only option for reenbodiment. I think he went back and forth on that point a bit.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>On the topic of marriage:<br><br><i>The Eldar wedded once only in life, and for love or at the least by free will upon either [ie, both] part. Even when in after days, as the histories reveal, many of the Eldar in Middle-earth became corrupted, and their hearts darkened by the shadow that lies upon Arda, seldom is any tale told of deeds of lust among them.<br><br>[Some details about betrothal and its breaking off]<br><br>Such was the law; but the right of revoking was seldom used, for the Eldar do not err lightly in such choice. They are not easily deceived by their own kind; and their spirits being masters of their bodies, they are seldom swayed by the desires of the body only, but are by nature continent and steadfast.<br><br>Nonetheless among the Eldar, even in Aman, the desire for marriage was not always fulfilled. Love was not always returned; and more than one might desire one other for spouse. Concerning this, the only cause by which sorrow entered the bliss of Aman, the Valar were in doubt. Some held that it came from the marring of Arda, and from the Shadow under which the Eldar awoke; for thence only (they said) comes grief or disorder. Some held that it came of love itself, and of the freedom of each </i>fea<i>, and was a mystery of the nature of the Children of Eru.</i><br><br><hr>

            <p>I think you&#39;ve definitely succeeded in making Sebak your own, starting with bringing some resolution to the events of his original appearance, then establishing his relationship with Tish, and finally giving him some depth with the dream sequence backstory. Very well done. I like him and Tish, and I look forward to their future stories. <sup>_<sup><br><br>I&#39;m</sup></sup> not quite sure why you made this three stories instead of one—the events seem to be directly and linearly connected to each other—but then, if it were just one continuous story you couldn&#39;t do the cool ABC titles. I notice that your blog gives page numbers, though; each part gives &quot;Page 1 of 1.&quot; I don&#39;t know anything about Tumblr, but perhaps you could make it so it&#39;s possible to navigate to each part directly, Page 1, Page 2, Page 3?<br><br>The only critiques I have are 1) my on-going crusade to see titles of long works properly italicized, and 2) I noticed several parenthetical remarks that probably don&#39;t need to be parenthetical.<br><br>A rule of thumb I was taught about parentheses is that if the information enclosed is important enough to include, it shouldn&#39;t need parentheses; if it isn&#39;t important, it shouldn&#39;t be there at all. This doesn&#39;t apply to any and all cases in which parentheses might hypothetically be involved, of course, but it&#39;s worthwhile to ask yourself why you feel something is a parenthetical remark and not a regular part of the narrative—does it need to be there, or not?<br><br>By the way, you mentioned RP. This should totally happen. Have I pointed out the <a href="http://ppchq.dreamwidth.org/">Dreamwidth RP comm</a> lately? I&#39;d love to see it get some use.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>First of all, glad you liked it. I look up to you as a writer and as a person and it&#39;s really great to hear that. :)<br><br>The reason they&#39;re separate stories is because I conceived of them separately. I wrote the first one to do what you said. The second one was, basically, &quot;I want to write elves and Vulcans!&quot; + &quot;What if a Vulcan watched a comedy show like <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>?&quot; + &quot;Hey look I have a Vulcan agent I can totally do this now!&quot;. The third was based on the writing challenge <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=245778;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=75">here</a>, but I started the story after the thread fell off the page, and here we are. <br><br>I italicized everything in the posts, but for some reason it&#39;s not showing up on the blog. *digs around* I&#39;m still trying to figure out Tumblr. If I can, I&#39;ll fix it.<br><br>I&#39;ve changed some of the parenthetical markings, but some of them I think I want to keep. I&#39;ll keep that rule in mind in the future, as I find in my writing that I tend to not so much as go off-topic, but saunter vaguely in that direction.<br><br>I was more thinking in terms of when a new RP thread popped up, as I&#39;ve never done RP before and it&#39;d be easier if someone else already started it. If someone else starts I&#39;ll definitely contribute.</p>

So they might be partial to eating bacon, raw eggs and fangirls, and can probably be trained by anyone with sufficient patience to do so. As for whether or not they can breed, I&#39;d be tempted to say no, that they can only come from the appropriate spelling mistake, but I don&#39;t see any reason why they couldn&#39;t if you thought it was funnier that way. </p>

            <p>That is, I assume we don&#39;t, because as far as I know the person who created the page is the only person who can take it down or do anything else to it, and I wouldn&#39;t know how to get in touch with them at this point.<br><br>That&#39;s another reason I&#39;m personally uncomfortable with it, for the record.
