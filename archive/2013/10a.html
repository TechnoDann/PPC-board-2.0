            <p>Oh gods, I nearly got blinded by a particular fic that wouldn&#39;t stop coloring its dialogue in Suvian colours. In case you were wondering, this one isn&#39;t the colorful fic though. Maybe just as bad.

            <p>Owowowowowowowowowow...<br><br>Haven&#39;t read very far, but...&quot;My mother, Lady Celebrain...&quot;<br><br>Her mother is a mini-Balrog. Who apparently dies of a fever rather than sailing to Valinor due to injuries by Orcs. Yeesh. And I&#39;m fairly sure Arwen was older than twelve when all of that happened--100 and something springs to mind.<br><br>...Dialogue. No. Get it away from me, that&#39;s horrible! Elves don&#39;t talk like that! At all! Also, she should be Gloriel, if I&#39;m not much mistaken--who gives out Quenya names in the Third Age? Very few people, and certainly not Lord Elrond. Maybe the Gondorians, they have a tendency to mix Quenya and Sindarin, but Elrond--Elrond&#39;s *parents*, even--were born in a time when Quenya was no longer widely spoken. (Do you see Glorfindel&#39;s name starting with &#39;Laur&#39; and looking something like Laurefindele ((missing accents))? No. No, you don&#39;t.) I mean, there&#39;s a basis for Elrond having heard it as a child, but...the fact remains that it&#39;s highly unlikely for him to give out Quenya names to his children...seeing as how he didn&#39;t give them to his other children (unless I&#39;m missing something?).<br><br>Speaking of which, are the El-twins in this? Are they even in this? They certainly don&#39;t seem to be so far...<br><br>Oh, and, Suethor, dear? Ten-year-old Elves are infants. Toddlers, at best. Good grief, what is this? It&#39;s like fifteen-year-old Legolasa all over again. Why don&#39;t people do their research properly?<br><br>Oh, and...why exactly is Elrond not telling his very young daughter that &#39;Celebrain&#39; dying means that they won&#39;t see her again until they themselves sail into the West and meet her, reembodied, on the shores of Valinor? That&#39;s what death means for Elves, y&#39;see. They go hang out in the Halls of Mandos for a bit (or for a lot, if they&#39;re Feanorian) and then they get reborn. Why Elrond isn&#39;t using this to comfort dear Lauriel I have no idea.<br><br>...Elves don&#39;t have &quot;golden blond hair&quot;, especially not female Elves. They would have golden blonde hair, if Elves had that, but they don&#39;t, so they don&#39;t.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry, RandomlyatRivendell!Legolas looks to be little miss Lauriel&#39;s age, and he&#39;s shooting a bow?? That&#39;s it, I&#39;m reading a movieverse fic about elven toddlers. This is stupid. I think I may claim this, if it gets any worse.<br><br>Yeah, it just got worse. She lives near the Bruinen and doesn&#39;t know how to swim, and she thinks her mother&#39;s in heaven. Wonderful. Also, her name can&#39;t be Undomiel, that&#39;s *Arwen&#39;s* name! And only Arwen&#39;s! Does Lauriel look like Luthien? No, I don&#39;t think so! For one thing, Luthien&#39;s hair was dark! Argh.<br><br>You don&#39;t have the boy&#39;s name? Well, I know who he is, and I am at a complete loss as to what he&#39;s doing near Rivendell.<br><br>...yes, remind me to take this one and give it to...someone. Not sure who. But an agent or several who will get a kick out of the wording and the badly written details.<br><br>I wonder how old she is in chapter one as opposed to the prologue...I&#39;m guessing she&#39;s in her teens, her twenties, or possibly in her thousands--you never know with Elf-Sues.<br><br>I shall add this to Claimed Badfic, I think, unless someone else really has their heart set on taking it (in which case, let me know).<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Great Scott, what&#39;s up with the <i>font</i> that this story is using? It&#39;s seriously too painful to read...<br><br>Quotev isn&#39;t the first place I look for badfic, but every now and then I find one that might be suitable for an Intel run. It&#39;s quite fascinating really: some of them do have potential. For example, in the sci-fi RPG <i>Mass Effect</i>, it&#39;s very common for players to base their avatar, Commander Shepard, on themselves. I spotted a fanfic which had the player somehow drop into the game&#39;s universe and meet their Shepard face-to-face.<br><br>I was intrigued, but was ultimately disappointed when all the main character did was to be very immature and hostile towards characters which she didn&#39;t like. When one of the aforementioned not-liked characters voiced his suspicions on the intentions of the dimensionally displaced Suvian, he was judo-thrown over the Sue&#39;s shoulders (despite being a trained soldier with gene therapy) and threatened with a knife.<br><br>In response to having a comrade threatened with death, the rest of the soldiers in the room went: &quot;Hey, that&#39;s pretty badass. Wanna hang?&quot;<br><br><a href="http://www.quotev.com/story/3403936/Born-For-This/1/">It can be found here.</a> Herr Wozzeck, I think you might get a kick out of this one.</p>

Huh.)<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9618603/1/Metal-Gear-Solid-6-Rise-of-Sentinel"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9618603/1/Metal-Gear-Solid-6-Rise-of-Sentinel">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9618603/1/Metal-Gear-Solid-6-Rise-of-Sentinel</a></a><br><br>There&#39;s only one chapter of this one so far, but it still looks pretty bad.

This seriously has to be one of the most sexist fanfics I&#39;ve ever read. Yeah, just about <i>every female character</i> is written as if they&#39;re horny teenagers, and all they really do throughout the fic is to fawn over the main character and not much else. And then, you know, there&#39;s the fact that the author is very impersonal and <i><b><u>refuses</u></b></i> to listen to criticism, and on the rare times he does he is still content to make excuses for himself. On top of that, the plot is completely stupid, to the point that it makes the fic it ripped off look <i>better</i> in comparison.<br><br>Seriously, I could go on all day about how bad that fanfic is.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve unfortunately known fics like that.

            <p>Interesting stuff. Not sure why it&#39;s on the wiki and not the board, but this discussion is something we absolutely <i>must</i> have.<br><br>Although I&#39;m not a biologist by discipline and have no formal training in the area, I have managed to pick up some knowledge through trying to design aliens, dragons, etc.<br><br><br>The biggest problem with a Suvian classification tree is that in World One biology, organisms descend in a treelike manner from common anscestors. The products of bad writing don&#39;t. However, biology can handle convergent and parallel evolution with little trouble, so the resulting duplication of traits across artificially-imposed tree boundaries isn&#39;t a big problem. Despite the enherent problems with forcing a tree-like classification onto something that&#39;s not tree-like, I think we should still make an effort to clump Sues by shared or similar traits. The more broad the similarity and the more variation is observed within the group, the higher up the tree it should go.<br><br><br>I would start by seperating Sues into two kingdoms (or perhaps a new, higher designation): wraiths and physical Sues. I&#39;ll look at the Wraiths at some other point (focusing on Sues now), but it seems obvious that given the massive physical differences between the two, they should be very far apart on the tree.<br><br>Sues I&#39;m thinking of seperating at the next-highest level into &quot;active&quot; and &quot;passive&quot;: roughly, Stus and Sues. However, I&#39;d like for this not to be based on biological sex, as that is in and of itself relatively superficial. Amazon Sues will fall into the &quot;active&quot; camp (assuming they are actually competant, otheriwse they are an offshoot of passives), while wimpy Stus (such as Archir the Ring Child) will fall into the &quot;passive&quot;.<br><br><br>I feel like this needs a flowchart.<br>I&#39;ll write more once I figure out how to make &amp; post one.</p>

            <p>Ok. I&#39;m proceeding in a roughly depth-first method through this tree, ignoring those sections that are more difficult to classify with the idea that working on the easier ones will give me more insight that can be later reapplied.<br>Tree can be found here:<br><a href="http://www.freeimagehosting.net/r1qwc"><img src="http://www.freeimagehosting.net/t/r1qwc.jpg"></a><br><br>Primary reason for considering a seperate category for character replacmenets is to make the tree look a bit less binary, and that they are often physically different from Wraiths or corporial Sues. However, since character replacements can do MANY different things, it might be better treated as something like camouflage, evolved independantly so many times that it is useless as a classifier.<br><br>Decided to group the passive Sues by thing they are intended to elicit. These roughly correspond to the suetypes from TVTropes:<br>purity sues (including literal goddesses, druids, etc.),<br>relationship sues (a subset will be porno-sues whose only involvement is to give or recieve sexual gratification), <br>popular-girl sues, <br>villain sues (those not actually badass enough to fit into the active category, which seems to be all of them?), <br>sues that primarily elicit pity or receive hurt/comfort (providers of comfort are a purity subset),<br>and sues whose primary purpose just seems to be showy and pretty (maybe merge with &quot;decorative&quot;?);<br><br>I&#39;ve also branched off at this point:<br>sues that exist to convey an ideological message,<br>&quot;false badass&quot; warrior sues,<br>anti-/suetiful-all-along sues,<br>and probably a catch-all &quot;other&quot; category.<br><br>Not sure if trans-dimensional hoppers and snatchers are broad enough in function to merit their own categories, of if enough of them fit into the relationship category to justify making them a subset.<br><br>Considering adding a third &quot;peripheral&quot; category in addition to active and passive, for Sues that don&#39;t directly exist to represent or act as a vehicle for the author: love interests, villain sues where another sue is clearly the authorial focus, deus-ex-machina &quot;cavalry&quot;, etc. Could make these another type, but they can be either active or passive in roughly equal number.</p>

            <p>Hello guys, it&#39;s so good to back on Board. Some of you may still remember me, some of you might not. In any case, I&#39;m just going to introduce myself again. <br><br>I&#39;m Autumn_68, preferred to be known as Autumn, and I originally joined somewhere around early August. I spent two lovely weeks on the Board, welcoming newbies, participating in discussions, etc. And then I had to take national exams, so I left the Board for about two months.<br><br>I&#39;m a shy, Asian pre-teen (11 years old, to be precise) that well...kindaliedaboutmyagelasttimeIwashere. *flushes* I&#39;m so sorry, I really am. I told all of you that I&#39;m 13 when I haven&#39;t even hit 12 yet. I feel so bad about myself now. I *do* apologise, I was such a jerk then, sorry, I&#39;m really sorry...sorry.<br><br>Again, I apologise if I speak broken English sometimes, because I&#39;m not so much of a native English speaker. (I speak Chinese with my family and South-East-Asian-nised English with the rest of the people.)<br><br>My fandoms are The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Hunger Games and Percy Jackson and The Olympians. I have limited knowledge on Wheel of Time and The Matrix, and I plan to start on Discworld when I finally find it in the library. (Argh)<br><br>I can Circle-Dive without as much trouble because I basically hang out with this bunch of nice fangirls that *wouldn&#39;t* pick up a high fantasy book however I insist. The only time they got interested was when I started carrying The Silm around and they were fascinated with the book cover. (They thought the drawing was frosted glass.) So, they make me go to the Circle to read so-called-goodfics. So I&#39;m basically used to that place now, and I can Circle-Dive anytime I want provided I take with me a kitchen knife and a pair of sunglasses. I think.<br><br>If I haven&#39;t drown you in brackets and nonsense, thank you. I really, really appreciate that you put up with me.<br><br>~Autumn</p>

            <p>Hello guys, it&#39;s so good to back on Board. Some of you may still remember me, some of you might not. In any case, I&#39;m just going to introduce myself again. <br><br>I&#39;m Autumn_68, preferred to be known as Autumn, and I originally joined somewhere around early August. I spent two lovely weeks on the Board, welcoming newbies, participating in discussions, etc. And then I had to take national exams, so I left the Board for about two months.<br><br>I&#39;m a shy, Asian pre-teen (11 years old, to be precise) that well...kindaliedaboutmyagelasttimeIwashere. *flushes* I&#39;m so sorry, I really am. I told all of you that I&#39;m 13 when I haven&#39;t even hit 12 yet. I feel so bad about myself now. I *do* apologise, I was such a jerk then, sorry, I&#39;m really sorry...sorry.<br><br>Again, I apologise if I speak broken English sometimes, because I&#39;m not so much of a native English speaker. (I speak Chinese with my family and South-East-Asian-nised English with the rest of the people.)<br><br>My fandoms are The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Hunger Games and Percy Jackson and The Olympians. I have limited knowledge on Wheel of Time and The Matrix, and I plan to start on Discworld when I finally find it in the library. (Argh)<br><br>I can Circle-Dive without as much trouble because I basically hang out with this bunch of nice fangirls that *wouldn&#39;t* pick up a high fantasy book however I insist. The only time they got interested was when I started carrying The Silm around and they were fascinated with the book cover. (They thought the drawing was frosted glass.) So, they make me go to the Circle to read so-called-goodfics. So I&#39;m basically used to that place now, and I can Circle-Dive anytime I want provided I take with me a kitchen knife and a pair of sunglasses. I think.<br><br>If I haven&#39;t drowned you in brackets and nonsense, thank you. I really, really appreciate that you put up with me.<br><br>~Autumn</p>

            <p>We know, of course, that hair colour in Tolkien tends to be the same across an entire people - so all Noldor have black hair, all Rohirrim are blond, etc. The exceptions are for specific families - Nerdanel&#39;s kin featured red hair, apparently uniquely.<br><br>We also know that, of the three houses of the Edain (Hador, Haleth, Beor), Hador was called &#39;the golden&#39;. So they were mostly blonde.<br><br>Hurin and Huor were a mix of Hador (from their father Galdor) and Haleth (from their mother Hareth). They married daughters of House Beor, one of whom was Morwen, noted for her black hair - which both implies that Beor was generally dark (otherwise that&#39;s genetically impossible), but also that they didn&#39;t tend towards jet black (since that would be unremarkable, but hers is commented on). So we can assume House Beor was brown-haired.<br><br>Beren, interestingly, had fair hair, but where he pulled it from I&#39;m not quite sure. His parents appear to have both been pure Beor.<br><br>But anyway, we&#39;re down to Turin and Tuor. Tuor was taken for a Noldo several times, which implies he had dark or black hair. Turin I don&#39;t know, but I really can&#39;t imagine him being blonde. Which... well. We know one half of their heritage was Beor (dark). We know one quarter was Hador (blond). <br><br>But wait, we can go further: Nienor and Lalaith. While I don&#39;t actually <i>know</i>, I&#39;m moderately sure Nienor was dark-haired (otherwise she would have been more visible at the various points where she&#39;s hiding from people. Lalaith... well, the book might actually say, I can&#39;t remember.<br><br>Unfortunately at this point we run foul of genetics: blonde hair, at least in our world, is recessive. We don&#39;t know where Beren&#39;s blondness came from - probably a Hador marriage a little way back - so we can&#39;t even guess whether the gene would be available to the Hurin/Huor families.<br><br>Ultimately, we come back to one statement: House Hador were specifically &#39;the golden-haired&#39;. That strongly implies the other houses weren&#39;t. So Haleth, probably, had dark hair. Black or brown, we can&#39;t tell.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: The best way to work this out would be to pull out a copy of <i>The Children of Hurin</i>. The woodsmen of Brethil are the last remnants of the House of Haleth - if you can find a hair-colour reference anywhere in there, it could help pin it down. My copy, alas, is all boxed up. ~hS</p>

            <p>I returned The Children of Húrin to the library two days ago. But, oh, I guess you&#39;re right in that &#39;Haleth had dark hair&#39; theory. From the information I could gather from the Silm, Haleth most likely had dark hair.<br><br>~Autumn</p>

            <p><i>Children of Hurin</i>, I mean. Running down the various Edain I can find on a quick pass:<br><br>Hador (blond) has various descendants, eventually coming down to Hurin and Huor. Hurin married Morwen (dark), and they had Urwen Lalaith (blonde), Turin (dark like his mother), and Nienor Niniel (blonde - her golden hair is revealed when Morwen leaves Doriath in search of Turin - bizarrely, her hair turns dark when she runs from Glaurung, and yes, this is discussed later). The whole people of Hador are nicknamed the Strawheads by Brodda the Easterling, implying the majority of them are blond (and not just the ruling house).<br><br>In Brethil, among the remnant of the people of Haleth, we meet their lord Brandir, Dorlas, and Hunthor. Hunthor is once described as &#39;a dark form&#39; (and mistaken for Dorlas), so that may indicate dark hair - but on the other hand, they&#39;re in shadow at the time. That&#39;s... all we have on the House of Haleth. Still, the evidence strongly suggests they were dark-haired.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... who Tolkien gave us very little about, which (as is usual in the case of minor Silm characters) means I get most of my impression of her from Philosopher at Large&#39;s <a href="http://rustbucket.net/leithian/">Leithian Script</a>. Haleth actually gets mentioned twice, the first time in Nargothrond:<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b>Finrod</b>: [musing]<br>--Haleth was like that. Wonderful child, but one had to be careful not to agree with her too closely, or she&#39;d take it all wrong.<br><br><b>Beren</b>:<br>I&#39;m not <u>that</u> bad. I don&#39;t think. --Hey! You knew Haleth? As in <u>the</u> Haleth? <u>Lady Haleth of Brethil</u>?<br><br><b>Finrod</b>:<br>Yes, she was having a run-in with Elwe, as it happens. Or Elu, as he calls himself now. Life&#39;s funny like that.<br><br><b>Beren</b>:<br>It makes a little more sense if he&#39;s like the rest of the crew, but I never understood why she wouldn&#39;t take up Lord Caranthir&#39;s offer of shelter.<br><br><b>Finrod</b>: [drily]<br>Obviously you&#39;ve never met Caranthir.<br><br><b>Beren</b>:<br>? . . . ?<br><br><b>Finrod</b>:<br>--Let me put it this way: <u>I don&#39;t cross him.</u> --<u>Ever</u>. No, that wasn&#39;t the incident I was referring to. Why? Because Haleth was an intelligent and perceptive young woman and was not fooled by Caranthir&#39;s charming ways and words. Ever wonder why they showed up a week late, <u>after</u> the lord of the land was killed, and the heir, when they were practically in his backyard? Caranthir knew them for efficient fighters, and wanted them grateful, and leaderless. And he has not, so far as I can tell, the slightest compunction about using mortal Men as a screen for his more -- <u>valued</u>, shall we say -- troops. --I don&#39;t know that for a fact, of course. That&#39;s just my reading of the events. And the way he spits when he hears her name. No, I was referring to the -- tenor, of her exchanges with Elu over that unused property of his. It was a rather, er, heated crossfire to be caught in. A little tact might have made a great difference.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>She&#39;s also discussed midway through Act IV (which takes place in the Halls of Mandos, with a whole bunch of dead people...)<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b>Fingolfin:</b><br><br>Or -- what was her name, that young mortal woman who caused so much fuss not too long ago?<br><br>[the other Belerianders stare at him]<br><br>[simultaneously (overlapping)]<br><br><b>Everyone from Middle-earth, native or returned:</b><br><br>-- Haleth!!<br><br>[there is an embarrassed moment as everyone sort of recollects themselves]<br><br><b>Fingolfin:</b> [defensive]<br><br>You must grant, I never <u>met</u> the lady.<br><br><b>Aegnor:</b> [sarcastic aside]<br><br>There&#39;s a surprise --<br><br><b>Angrod:</b><br><br>Neither did I -- but we still heard about her enough to remember her name, uncle! It wasn&#39;t as though there weren&#39;t relatives of hers straggling through the realm for the better part of a decade.<br><br><b>Aegnor:</b> [faint amusement]<br><br>It was almost like the first years here, where you never knew <u>when</u> you were going to walk into a settlement of strangers giving you funny looks and speaking a language nearly but not <u>quite</u> comprehensible. It was rather hard <u>not</u> to cross Nargothrond and hear the name &quot;Haleth&quot; in the process --<br><br><b>Angrod:</b> [interrupting]<br><br>-- But he didn&#39;t, don&#39;t you recall?<br><br>[the Princes shake their heads in too-obvious pity, to their uncle&#39;s chagrin]<br><br><b>Luthien:</b><br><br>Yes, annexing part of the kingdom and then telling Mablung off for trespassing --<br><br>[to the Valinorean Eldar, living and otherwise]<br><br>-- well, <u>you</u> don&#39;t know our Captains, so that doesn&#39;t mean much to you, but people <u>listen</u> to them, most of the time -- when he came to try to evict them, does sort of stick in people&#39;s memory.<br><br><b>Finrod:</b><br><br>Not to mention dragging half-a-thousand unwilling kinsmen through a vale full of giant spiders and other assorted monstrosities, and her with no natural abilities whatsoever to help her defend them, and most of them increasingly convinced she was insane for not staying in a land already cultivated and partially settled, because there was too much &quot;<u>open</u>&quot; to the northward. Or commanding a successful defense against the Enemy&#39;s minions, when everyone else was on the verge of giving up and dying before rescue arrived -- which was partly the reason they didn&#39;t kick her out as chief after the business with the Old Road and the mutant beasts. &quot;The spiders were a mistake,&quot; she told me, &quot;I thought they were bogles out of tales to frighten bad children -- or Men who might think of going too close to the Shadowking&#39;s woods otherwise.&quot;<br><br>[shaking his head]<br><br>The way they talked about her, you couldn&#39;t tell if they thought she was brilliant, mad, or both -- and that they weren&#39;t sure either. But not being around her wasn&#39;t an option, any more than for moths about a lit candle.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>And from the notes to the first scene:<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Caranthir: perhaps I read too much ancient history and political intrigue, but I can&#39;t escape the conclusion that for some reason, the Haladin found their rescuer even more scary, and the thought of his active involvement in their lives a worse prospect, than Orcs. One doesn&#39;t become refugees for no good reason, particularly just after having fought a hard war. Add that to the chroniclers&#39; asides as to Caranthir&#39;s insolence, arrogance, hideous temper, and later actions — and it adds up, for me, to a picture of someone charismatic, dynamic, charming, and violent, whom you don&#39;t ever, ever want to tangle with if you have any sense… He is after all a Son of Feanor too.<br><br>Haleth: It&#39;s been at least three generations since the legendary Chieftain of the Haladin led her people to a new homeland in the western forests, and for most of us, fifty years ago is — a long time. A hundred years ago is a long time. A hundred-fifty years ago is a long time…two hundred a really long time… Intellectually we may even know that, realize that compared to say &quot;geological time&quot;, it&#39;s nothing, but on a basic personal level — it&#39;s all &quot;a long time ago.&quot; Even for those of us who really know history and study family lore, there&#39;s a certain cognitive dissonance involved in keeping the relative scale present. I do think that this would be the case for Beren, who never even had the opportunity to achieve the level of accustomed familiarity that his older relatives had with Elvenkind in the Leaguer — and that it would trouble Finrod, divided as in Canon between loyalty and prudential considerations.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Yeah... Lady Haleth&#39;s pretty cool.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>A large hive the size of a city block (from the perspective of its inhabitants, at any rate), with tiny Elves dressed in yellow-and-black striped clothing running around it and throughout its catacombs and speaking to each other in high-pitched buzzing noises.<br>But then everything changed when Beekeeper Ungoliant emerges from the horizon. Draped in the imposing hazmat suit traditional to beekeepers everywhere, a necessary barrier from the stinger-arrows of the elves, she cracks open the hive to retrieve the Elves&#39; hard-wrought Varda Light within. Once she has had all she can carry, she takes it back to her house and stores it in whimsical tree-shaped containers to sell at the local farmers&#39; market.<br><br>So <i>this</i> is what happens when I check the Board at 1 a.m. Good to know.</p>

            <p>And, of course, she sells them all to Modern Artist Morgoth--no, he&#39;d be Melkor at this point. They&#39;re very good friends. However, there&#39;s a bit more of the Varda Light, and since it&#39;s in such high demand, Melkor (being curious) comes with Beekeeper Ungoliant to get it. Unfortunately, the Elves are guarding it fiercely...and Melkor, discovering a previously unknown fear of Elves, swats Finwe and crushes him under his boot. The Beekeeper and the Artist (oh no, more Time Lord names, help) leave with the Varda Light, and Feanor the Elf swears vengeance on the one he now renames Morgoth...because Melkor is now an enemy, and he was wearing black at the time and cast a giant shadow besides. Feanor&#39;s seven sons take up the call as well, and they and their followers set off on a dangerous quest to regain the previous Varda Light...<br><br>Funnily enough, I guess this is what happens when I check the Board at 1 pm.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>...I feel vaguely like I&#39;m starting to become an oldbie. I think I&#39;m just getting to the point where I&#39;m more comfortable than &#39;I&#39;mnotjustaPPCfangirlIpromise&#39;, that may be it...anyway.<br><br>Like Kitty said, you&#39;re a pretty cool 11 year old :) And we&#39;re glad to have you. I share all of your fandoms except for Wheel of Time, and you&#39;ll probably love Discworld (or possibly not. Not everyone does. I do, though, and a lot of PPC stories are kind of similar, so if you like those...you may well like Discworld).<br><br>Hope your exams went well! Also, here, have some extra-fine Swiss Bleepolate for the Circle-Diving: you&#39;ll need it. It&#39;s an essential part of visiting the Circle (along with Lemming Repellent...) Also, Gummyblee Pirate Hats (a la Captain Jack Sparrow). May as well. Circle-Divers need all the Bleeproducts available, trust me...I&#39;ve found out from experience.<br><br>You appreciate us putting up with you? Well, we appreciate you putting up with us :) And, y&#39;know, being here. Everyone adds to the community, you know, and I have yet to see your contribution being a bad one. And now I&#39;ll stop being somewhat sappy and comment on the Silm (isn&#39;t it amazing? A little hard to get through, maybe, but, well, it&#39;s got some great stories in it. Did you get through it? Which story/character was your favorite?)<br><br>Out of curiosity, which fandoms do your bunch of nice fangirls write for? And, um, how bad are their &quot;so-called goodfics&quot;, as you put it?<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I just bought The Colour of Magic yesterday, and so far it has been awesome. Oh yes, thank you for your gifts; I&#39;ll make sure to bring them next time I go Circle-Diving. <br><br>My favourite story from the Silm? Hmm...I like Of Túrin Turumbar (I&#39;ve read the Children of Húrin) best, and then Of Beren and Lúthien comes second. The Darkening of Valinor is also very nice. My favourite character(s)? I guess it&#39;s Maglor, Túrin and Eärendil for male characters and Morwen and Melian for female ones.<br><br>I&#39;ll list the fandoms of my friends here: Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Taylor Swift, One Direction, Mortal Instruments, Taylor Swift, One Direction, Harry Potter, and lastly, Taylor Swift and One Direction! In addition, one of them is a fan of Twilight and another likes The Inheritance Cycle. (Darn) Many of them have crushes on Niall Horan and one of them (my best friend) is actually convinced that she is in love with Harry Styles.<br><br>As for their fanfiction, none of them except for my best friend has actually published fanfiction yet but they have shown me their stories. As far as I am concerned, those are actually &#39;Sue-fics. I have to wrench my features into a smile instead of a disgusted, horrified expression I&#39;m always tempted to make while reading those stories. *shudders* Occasionally, I do explain to them what a &#39;Sue is but they&#39;ll just look at me with this confused expression and carry on making &#39;Sue-fics. And then there&#39;s tolerating squeals, glomps, sobbing (of how they&#39;ll never marry Mr. Styles/Horan/Payne/Tomlinson/Malik), and of course, shrieks of how who-and-who &quot;are, like, sooooo hott. Especially him, he&#39;s soooooo cute!&quot; <br><br>Ah well. But they&#39;re still good friends that are worth it, so tolerating a little doesn&#39;t hurt! That is, if they don&#39;t damage my brain cells. <br><br>~Autumn</p>

            <p>I search mainly for Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, The Lord of the Rings and The Hunger Games ones. Those are the more popular ones with teens and their fandoms are, therefore, often swamped with fangirls. For Percy Jackson, Harry Potter and The Hunger Games, I have to abandon my sunglasses for a pair of tempered goggles. Very, very, occasionally a hazmat suit. And then I&#39;ll have to bring out every sharp object I can find. You can never know.<br><br>~Autumn</p>

            <p>So, based on <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=248710;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">DawnFire and Ailavyn Siniyash&#39;s discussion</a> of &#39;ship names for PPCers - specifically the Jay/Acacia ship, Byrdtree (or maybe it could be Jaycacia - no, taken - or Thornbyrd - no, taken too ;)) - I started scribbling a few of my own. Of course I started with my OTP, Dafydd/Constance - which, me not being very good at this, became Dafstance.<br><br>&#39;Oh hey,&#39; thought I, &#39;that sounds sort of like a Pokemon. I wonder what it would be like...?&#39;<br><br>Oh dear. There&#39;s a fair number of Dafydd &#39;ships, aren&#39;t there?<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b>Sillmaglor</b> (Maglor/Silmaril)<br><br>Fire-type<br><br><i>Burned Hand Pokemon</i><br><br>It constantly longs for the rock that burned it. It searches in dark caves for any such jewels. Only a significant shock will help it move on.<br><br><b>Sellian</b> (Dafydd/Selene)<br><br>Fire/Electric-type<br><br><i>Pyro Pokemon</i><br><br>Wherever it goes, it brings the storm. Between fire and lightning, there isn&#39;t much left after it&#39;s done. It prefers to do its work at a distance, rather than going in close.<br><br><b>Vefydd</b> (Dafydd/Vemi)<br><br>Fire/Fighting-type<br><br><i>Assassin Pokemon</i><br><br>It goes all-out to take out its opponent, using whatever comes to hand. It will happily follow a blizzard of punches with a long-distance fire attack.<br><br><b>Dafstance</b> (Dafydd/Constance)<br><br>Fire/Ghost-type<br><br><i>Nightcloak Pokemon</i><br><br>With its right hand it heals, while with its left it burns. It apparently believes its fiery attacks are cauterising wounds. If injured, it will vanish into the night to recover.<br><br><img src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y148/Huinesoron/Pokeships.png"><br><br>(Can I draw? No, not really. But I do like Dafstance&#39;s design)<br><br>And with those methods of evolving, I&#39;ve still got at least two (burn and freeze) left to exploit...<br><br>So, go on. What are your PPC shipnames (for your characters or others, I guess)? And what would they be like as Pokemon?<br><br>(I imagine Byrdtree would definitely be half-poison, for Acacia&#39;s arrows - but what would Jay&#39;s half be?)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Geeze. Of course I manage to give my two main agents really hard names to smush together. <br><br>So, first up is <b>Lian</b>, which sounds okay, but not the best. Hm. Let&#39;s look at their last names...<br><br>Moorehaven and Nahinu. Morinu? Naven? Right. Maybe not so much. <br><br>Let&#39;s see. Well, I could always do something a bit more non-traditional.

With that in mind, let&#39;s see what comes up:<br><br>Hawaiian Cougar (Eesh.

It can apply to characters that actually are (Eledhwen and Christienne), or who never were (Dafydd and Vemi).

They also have encyclopedia entries, which give a two or three word description (<i>Camel Pokemon</i>), and a short description of them (&#39;It lives in trees and drops on the heads of unwary passers-by, relying on its hardened skin to protect it from harm&#39;).<br><br><b>The PPC</b><br><br>The PPC is a flat world which rides on the back of four elephants, which themselves stand on the shell of an enormous turtle, which (being a turtle) swims endlessly through space.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Elechriss/Elekriss would make for a good Pokémon name (Bug-type, maybe? It&#39;s not in the motifs of either character, but the &quot;ch&quot; right next to the sibilant at the end there associates it with insects to me. Probably Psychic as a primary, or possibly Electric, but I&#39;m going with Bug as a secondary.), but Elechriss sounds like... some sort of mystic armament. Like one of those lightweight swords in Arthurian-style fantasy made up of an unearthly metal, the sort that can cut through practically anything with little effort on the part of its bearer. Still awesome. Plus, just imagine Eledhwen wielding one of those. Character-perfect.<br><br>Would her sword be named after the ship, though? Would the word even mean the same thing in-universe? Further questions to ponder. Possibly only by me, but ponder nonetheless.<br>Though, considering that the PPC has at least a few meta-cognizant individuals on its staff, the answer to the second question could easily be both yes and no to some people.</p>

            <p>... the name &#39;Superdecimary&#39;. I&#39;m sort of picturing these as an anthropomorphic book - but in a cool way, not an Egyptian god shove-a-stupid-head-on-it way.

Something like this?<br><br><img src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y148/Huinesoron/Nume-Decima.png"><br><br>Those are supposed to be two rolled pages for the arms, two folded down pages for the legs, with the rest of the pages sticking out to the sides and the covers folded right back to make those two little spikes (which look something like wings). I guess this would be Nuima - Decume would be a bigger book with some intricate origami work to give it a (mouthless) face and better limbs, while Superdecimary, befitting its fire nature, would actually be pieces of charred paper hovering above an empty or burning book cover.<br><br>Very little chance of me drawing <i>that</i>, though.

            <p>I think you&#39;d have that as basically an overturned book, with folded/rolled pages making the legs. I&#39;ve actually made my version of Nuima in actual reality, sort of, and to get it to look right you&#39;d really need to rip the pages partially away from the spine.<br><br>I can see Decume as a... I guess more turtle than crab, with a faceted shell, and one book open at the front to make the face. Then Superdecimary - well, I think that comes down to how well the art would work. I&#39;m pretty sure <i>I</i> couldn&#39;t pull off a biped made of books without it looking stupid, but I agree that it would look good if someone <i>could</i>.

            <p>I&#39;m gonna have to pass on the Pokemon part, though, as the Pokemon franchise and I have been through a rather nasty falling out. Lots of yelling and throwing of things (Pokeballs, mostly) and squinting at teeny tiny screens.<br><br>But ship names? Yeah, I can try my hand at a few of those. I&#39;ll start off simple, with my own characters. Since some of them don&#39;t really portmanteau together all that well, the following list will be a combination of mash-up couple names and descriptors. First off, the partnership... uh, ships.<br><br>Gremlin/Xericka - <b>Grexicka</b>, <b>Xemlin</b>, <b>Dark Sparks</b><br>Laura/Danny - <b>Lanny</b>, <b>Darla</b><br>Laura/James - <b>Jarla</b>, <b>Southern Comfort</b><br>Rachel/Cornelius - <b>Ralius</b>, <b>AUspicous</b>, <b>AUsome</b><br><br>And, as a bonus:<br><br>Laura/Danny/Rachel - <b>Darlachel</b>, <b>Mentorshipping</b><br><br>Finally (for now), a suggestion for Dafydd/Constance: <b>OBMF (One Big Mad Family).</b><br><br>PC</p>

            <p>The design for Grexicka put me in mind of the D&amp;D nightmare creature, only with lightning as opposed to flames. I approve of such a concept.<br><br>As for Xemlin, I assumed (in the short moments after I had seen the drawing but before I read the bit underneath it) that what I was looking at was the darkness it carried around. I thought that the creature itself was more like a sentient foo fighter or will-o-the-wisp hiding in a eel-shaped cloak of darkness<br><br>Either way, pretty cool concepts. While I might not be a Pokemaniac anymore, I could see these as interesting critters from that universe.</p>

            <p>Bltzle is a zebra that absorbs and discharges electrical energy, and evolves into a larger version that does so more quickly and efficiently. Grexicka is a horse phantom made of darkness and sparks, and evolves into a titanic sky-eel that shoots lightning from its eyes. I think they&#39;re different enough.<br><br>I&#39;m imagining that Xemlin looks a lot like the a flying version of the <a href="http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/59/131059-004-AE5DE7F3.jpg">gulper eel</a>, just because the idea of that thing also being capable of swallowing a small plane whole is just too incredible to dismiss. <br>Of course, they&#39;d probably live in systems of strong and turbulent weather, being thunderstorm-based creatures and all, so pilots would probably stay away from a potential Xemlin den with or without the threat of being <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I16_8l0yS-g">Megasharked</a>, but I&#39;m having too much fun with the idea to let basic logic get in its way.</p>

            <p>What was it that first convinced you badfic needed to be killed? I&#39;m not necessarily asking how you first heard of the PPC, although I imagine that for many people the two may be synonymous. I&#39;m talking about the event that made you think either &quot;someone should do something!&quot; or &quot;these Agents have the right idea&quot;.<br><br>For me it was the latter revelation: I heard about the PPC through TVTropes while looking for badfic in general, and wandered around the wiki for a few hours driven by pure curiosity.

            <p>Checking my <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/~huinesoron">old profile</a> shows that my &#39;Sue-killing story was started in August &#39;03, and the very first chapter mentions the PPC. I know (or think) I first heard of OFUM when someone mentioned it in a review to another, deleted story - which, judging by the date on the sequel, would have been around March &#39;03. I believe I only got an email address in around November/December &#39;02 (in time to email a friend about The Two Towers over the Christmas holidays), so... I&#39;m going to guess I first heard of badfic, fangirls and Mary-Sues when I read OFUM, and I read OFUM because someone mentioned mini-Balrogs to me, and I wanted one. ;) The PPC, of course, is found on the OFUM website...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>*clears throat and laces fingers* Let me tell you a story.<br><br>I was - and still am - a fangirl. It isn&#39;t something I&#39;m ashamed of. However, my newbie-fangirl self was a Suethor, or, at least, had the mind of one. My Lust Object was Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. (He&#39;s still my Lust Object, but now shares that title with several other characters). I devoured fic and fan art featuring him, and realized that there were others who felt the same way. Most of the time I felt an affinity with them.<br><br>One time, I was browsing fanfiction on Deviant Art (don&#39;t ask) when I found a story featuring Data. Due to Deviant Art&#39;s lack of organization, I had no idea what it was going to be. So I read. And it was a Suefic.<br><br>It didn&#39;t have bad SPaG, but that&#39;s all. This is the plot progression:<br><br>Data&#39;s best friend Geordi: So, are going to ask her out &#39;cause you too seem to be really close?<br>(keep in mind that this is the beginning of the story and we haven&#39;t even met her yet)<br>Data:…<br>She and Data get trapped in a cave-in. Declarations of love are exchanged and an intense makeout session ensues, with an author&#39;s note indicating mature content in the next chapter.<br><br>I kid you not. Naturally, this made me angry - mostly out of jealous. Then and there I vowed to hate her and her kind for all time. Now I definitely understand Poor Cynic&#39;s point about laughing at badfic, but at that moment I was mad.<br><br>My writing didn&#39;t suddenly improve, nor did I learn to recognize Sues that weren&#39;t lusting after characters. But it alerted me to the problems in fanfiction, and made me think that I could be part of the solution.<br><br>Sorry to go on so long, but your question hit something very specific and I wanted to share. </p>

            <p>The PPC, for me, has never been about &#39;killing&#39; badfic. I joined the PPC because I love writing. I saw in the community a group of like-minded folks with a sense of <i>Mystery Science</i>-esque humor who sought to both improve themselves and make people laugh at the same time.<br><br>The phrase &#39;killing badfic&#39; always felt a bit too mean-spirited to me. We spork badfic, we mock badfic, we tease badfic, but actually killing it? That strikes me as too much. Not to mention that killing badfic -- actually removing it from existence -- is nigh-on impossible outside of badgering the actual authors, which would not reflect well on our little society. <br><br>You can&#39;t say &#39;someone should do something&#39; because there is nothing that <i>can</i> be done. Mike (or Joel) and the &#39;Bots could never stop the films that came their way. All they could do was sit down and throw jokes at the screen until the metaphorical storm had passes. We can&#39;t stop the flow of badfic. All we can do is crack jokes and be silly until the story comes to an end.</p>

In appreciation of your alternate timeline sensibilities, have a jet pack salvaged from a sapient coelophysid! Don&#39;t ask what the point of divergence was in that time stream; I&#39;m still trying to work it out myself. It probably had something to do with a delay of the Permian extinction event that I picked up, but I&#39;m still working out the details. Causality derivatives are hard for me to measure.</p>

            <p>I know it doesn&#39;t really fit what you were asking for, but that was my first thought. Gritter is what you sprinkle on a canon to get a darker, edgier version. If it&#39;s an official version you have a &#39;gritty reboot&#39;. (Nolan&#39;s dark Knight films are the epitome of this.) In fanfics, Gritter can be used to create a &#39;Dark AU&#39;.</p>

            <p>A while ago, I beought up the concept of Logic Water and Crystals of Plausibility. Logic Water is like water except that it glows bright blue. When consumed, for Non-Suvians it has them think logically. It generally calms the consumer down. But if the consumer is Suvian, they will get SOCS and or disolve into glitter. Logic Water isn&#39;t foolproof; some Suvians might be immune to its effects. The Crystals work the same way, but thsy have a repelling effect.<br><br>As for their taste, I figure you&#39;d have to combine the two. Perhaps you could grind up the crystals and mix it up with the water to get a paste. As for the taste,  it would probably be sweet. Maybe like icing. Hmm, icing of Logic...The Sues wouldn&#39;t know what hit them. You could offer them a piece of cake with the icing then BAM! A pile of glitter.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if powdered crystal could be used to make icing...but we can improvise.</p>

            <p>It first showed up in an OFU somewhere, and essentially means that Sues will start having mental breakdowns when they encounter too many things they can&#39;t understand or can&#39;t control. An overload of logic, since it&#39;s outside a Sue&#39;s ability to influence, could potentially provoke a similar malfunction.</p>

            <p>The first mention of SOCS was at IAHF I beleive. Because the consumption of Logic Water and or Crystals of Plausibility induces logical thoughts or actions, most Suvians cannot handle them. I think it&#39;s because their very existence is illogical. How can one have a large chest and a waist as thin as a baseball bat and not suffer the consequences of such bad anatomy.  How can you be the best archer in the realm when you&#39;ve just pickes up a bow?<br><br>Logic counteracts those examples.  Of course Logic can&#39;t really exist in liquid form...which is somewhat illogical., but let&#39;s not go there.</p>

            <p>Glitter exists in its PPC form because Sues are often sparkly and speshul, and so, from a meta-standpoint, it was determined early on that Sueishness is determined by the presence of glitter. Glitter is almost like the smallest observable particle of Sue material. Admittedly, that&#39;s not the best comparison, but you wouldn&#39;t ask what the opposite of oxygen was, or the opposite of propane. Doubly so for semi-supernatural materials like glitter.<br>Fully supernatural substances usually have an opposite, but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s usually just to provide a phlebotinum antidote in case the creators write themselves into a corner, or in order to have a &quot;dark&quot; version of the existing substances to be used by an antagonist.<br><br>And don&#39;t let Agent Corolla hear you say that glitter tastes nasty. She loves the stuff.</p>

            <p>Considering that a good chunk of Sues are written &quot;on sugar highs&quot; and often they contain too many &quot;sweet&quot; traits, we can assume that the taste of Sueness is a sugary one.<br><br>So the taste of Anti-Glitter should be bitter, but still pleasant. Coffee, perhaps?<br><br>Now that I think about it, coffee doesn&#39;t have that great of an appearance (it&#39;s usually brown), and tends to get one&#39;s head in place (for example, I tend to drink it oonly when I need help saying awake, as I&#39;m not quite a fan of it. And it must be an Italian-style espresso, not that dirty water thing Americans call coffee)... so it kinda fits in all three categories.<br><br>As a result, we can safely assume that the closest thing to anti-Glitter existing is coffee.</p>

            <p>Hello, brave agents of PPC! I have heard of your organisation a while ago and greatly appreciate the service you perform for the fanfiction communities. However, I just have a question to ask:<br><br>Given how subjective a lot of fiction tends to be (each one of us probably loves some generally reviled movies and vice versa), how exactly do you decide if a fic is good, bad or just mediocre and not worth bothering with? Is it just up t the agents&#39; judgement, or do oother factor also enter into it? Specifically, do the follows/favourites on the Pit (or their closest equivalent on other sites) ever enter into this, or not?<br></p>

            <p>I believe the best way to sum up the issue is whether the changes to the Canon are Plausible.  Is it within reason that such a change could happen.<br><br>So, if drastic changes happen to say Harry Potter during his time at Hogwarts, then it is a high risk of being a bad story.  However, if say subtle changes that occur well before the books happen, leading to more drastic alterations later one, that is probably more acceptable.</p>

            <p>I would like to add, though, that in general I find that the amount of likes a story has is irrelevant in terms of badfic: I&#39;ve PPC&#39;d badfic with no likes and I&#39;ve PPC&#39;d badfic that was liked by people.<br><br>As for the changes issue you brought up in the second paragraph... our stance is that changes are not really an inherently bad thing. However, with some changes to the canon you <i>can</i> go too far, and that&#39;s where we come in. It&#39;s sort of like what the Nostalgia Critic said about <i>The Last Airbender</i>: you do have to make some changes, but they&#39;ve gotta be changes that make <i>sense</i>. I don&#39;t know about your two <i>Dragon Age</i> fics (I&#39;ll give &#39;em a look later if I have time), but given the quality of the writing style I don&#39;t think there&#39;ll be too much to write about there.<br><br>And since you&#39;re here... welcome to the PPC, dude!

            <p>We each have our own idea of what&#39;s good, bad, or mediocre, but I think what&#39;s most important in our badfic selection process is if the badfic itself is funny (&quot;funny&quot; being anything that falls in between &quot;mess of funny typos&quot; to &quot;completely inane plot&quot;). We write missions to make our agents cry, rage, and go nuts over silly happenings, so we choose materials that would enable us to write a good scenario for them. Think of it as a MST shot on location, except the audience gets a chance to fix things at the end.<br><br>As for FFN (and other sites that host fanfic) reviews and &quot;likes&quot;, I find them to be a general indicator of what&#39;s trending as opposed to what is good. Consider the slightly horrifying appeal of the <i>Fifty Shades</i> series... It&#39;s popular, but a lot of us wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a great piece of literature. <br><br>Oh, and hello to you, good sir/ma&#39;am/mysterious entity!

            <p>Here&#39;s a link to The Last of Us post-ending story on The Pit I found recently (<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9402093/1/Their-story"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9402093/1/Their-story">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9402093/1/Their-story</a></a>). It doesn&#39;t seem bad by the looks of it and has 137 favs. at 36 k words. Does this actually mean anything in terms of the story quality or not? I don&#39;t know if you have done anything in the TLOU universe yet, but I hope you&#39;ll find this message useful.<br><br>Then, here&#39;s another story on the Pit (also available at the Dragon Age wiki) I&#39;m not sure about: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6852833/1/His-Father-s-Son"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6852833/1/His-Father-s-Son">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6852833/1/His-Father-s-Son</a></a> and its prequel of sorts, <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6488069/1/Necessary-Things"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6488069/1/Necessary-Things">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6488069/1/Necessary-Things</a></a> (plus some oneshots related to both stories.) I have been reading this for quite a while and I can&#39;t quite make up my mind on it: it is close to canon overall, but some later chapters do begin to change things and I&#39;m not sure about the characters&#39; handling. Essentially, my opinion of it changes from chapter to chapter and I was curious as to what you thought of it and how it matches with your quality requirements.<br></p>

            <p>Or the pool, as it were. <br><br>Who in the PPC listens to the Night Vale podcasts? And of you all, who&#39;s noticed how similar Night Vale is to the PPC? DawnFire and I are in the middle of a discussion about how they are so alike. And come on: the PPC is run by telepathic plants that sometimes wear clothing. Tell me that isn&#39;t Night Vale-esque. Our lack of spacial and temporal continuity is another point towards the PPC and Night Vale being somehow related. Doesn&#39;t &quot;you have to not know where you are to get to where you&#39;re going&quot; sound very Night Vale? And hey, I&#39;m sure there are plenty of PPCers who wouldn&#39;t mind flying around in green helicopters with diving birds of prey painted on the sides...<br><br>Am I trying to imply anything here?

            <p>&quot;We could probably get that many balaclavas by just sticking one in a replicator&quot; anyway. An interesting point, though what about stuff like maintenance costs, building up the New Cal city, etc.?<br><br>And of course the fact the PPC can just take everything from everywhere does raise the question of why Finance even exists, except for the purposes of (not-very-highly) paying the agents. Which is fair enough on its own, nobody likes working for free, but to get back to my last post I think the point I was making essentially boiled down to &quot;there&#39;s no reason the Flowers wouldn&#39;t be able to afford - or simply take/replicate - that many ski masks if they wanted them&quot;.</p>

            <p>So for you Percy Jackson fans out there, the House of Hades came out...and I read it...<br>I won&#39;t say anything about the book, but I do think there will be a fanfic explosion. I foresee much bad slash and Sues...<br><br>If anyone cares, I am emotionally damaged. I thought the book was good, but Rick&#39;s writing style...and plot twists....<br>Rick&#39;s writing style was subtle, it left small cuts in my feels. And then BOOM! He dumps lemon and lime juice on my wounds and rolls my feels in salt like one giant margarita of emotional pain.<br><br>So how was your day today?</p>

This is--this--okay, now I agree completely with your subject line. If, when you do this mission, you want any volunteer agents to help, or possibly burn down the &#39;reunited&#39; Gondolin if it turns out to be a Geographical Aberration, contact me.<br><br>Oh, and she had <i>better</i> claim to be related to the right people. Because, technically? Elrond&#39;s children are, currently, the last of the line of Gondolin&#39;s rulers. Y&#39;know, because Earendil was Elrond&#39;s father, and the son of Tuor and Idril, who was the daughter of Turgon, King of Gondolin. And since she&#39;s stated very clearly that her parents were only <i>friends</i> of Arwen&#39;s parents, well, she&#39;s out of luck there. If anyone&#39;s going to &#39;reunite&#39; Gondolin, though for what purpose I have no idea, it should be someone of Elrond&#39;s or Elros&#39; lines.

            <p>Hold on, I&#39;ll prepare the spaghetti western music! You&#39;ll probably both need to use melee weapons, though, because I don&#39;t know if Gimli knows how to use anything that shoots from a distance, and you using projectiles while he uses an axe would be very unfair. Then again, he is very experienced with an axe, and you might not have experience with axe-based combat.<br><br>Maybe you should both fight with a weapon neither of you would know how to use. Like a bat&#39;leth. That way, nobody has an advantage, and everyone who watches gets to watch a Dwarf fighting with Klingon weaponry, which is just ridiculous enough to be awesome.<br><br>Yes. This will work. I&#39;ll head off to OFUM and see if Gimli&#39;s awake yet, and then prepare a gigantic bowl of popcorn for everybody who wants to watch this happen.

            <p>These were recommended for PPCing, and <i>written</i>, by the guy who asked me to report <u>My Little Dashie</u>.<br><br>Fic A: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7788288/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7788288/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7788288/</a></a><br><br>Fic B: <a href="http://explicit.ponyfictionarchive.net/browse.php?type=authors&amp;uid=995"><a href="http://explicit.ponyfictionarchive.net/browse.php?type=authors&amp;uid=995">http://explicit.ponyfictionarchive.net/browse.php?type=authors&amp;amp;uid=995</a></a><br><br>Fic C: <a href="http://ponyfictionarchive.net/browse.php?type=authors&amp;uid=995"><a href="http://ponyfictionarchive.net/browse.php?type=authors&amp;uid=995">http://ponyfictionarchive.net/browse.php?type=authors&amp;amp;uid=995</a></a><br><br><br>Fic C isn&#39;t that bad. Basically, it involves Princess Celestia ruminating about her actions during the battle against the Changelings (I&#39;m only up to the Cider Squeezer 6000 episode, so my knowledge of those events is secondhand). Yes, the grammar could be better. Yes, it has a standoff scene with some weird double entendres. But I like the idea, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s PPCable, mostly because it&#39;s very short and Celestia is surprisingly in character (or more accurately, we see another side to her that it seems reasonable for her to have).<br><br>Fic B... is a rapefic. It&#39;s tagged with &quot;everything imaginable&quot; which I guess would be better than NOT being tagged, but... there&#39;s an OC who sounds exactly like Kam (the author) if Kam were to spontaneously lose 50 IQ points, Rarity and Prince Blueblood have their characters partially <i>inverted</i>, and the actual &quot;plot&quot; involves Rarity being gang-raped... and enjoying it... while <i>Sweetie Belle</i> is herself raped... and also enjoys it. Seriously, it&#39;s just... Kam told me he wrote it to being traffic to his account thinking people would read it as porn, but how anyone would find this arousing I don&#39;t know.<br><br>Fic A starts out reasonably well, but continually decreases in quality as it goes on. It creates an extracanonical race of ancient ponies called &quot;Builders,&quot; who may or may not be Suvian enough to merit extermination (they were set up as superior to all the other ponies, but actually had to deal with some of the consequences of their hubris); the villain is... hammy; the Mane 6 become flat and one-dimensional (although this is actually justified somewhat by the Elements of Harmony apparently sucking away their personalities); overall the story piles on new plot points without resolving the old ones, but in spite of all of this it raises some interesting points that I&#39;d like to see expanded on.<br><br>Then I read the last three paragraphs, which consist of the Stu from Fic B drugging, and predictably preparing to rape, Twilight <i>freaking</i> Sparkle.</p>

            <p>Now I was wonder if we can post stuff about goodfics or is the board mainly to report badfics that might be PPC material?  <br><br>Now, one reason why Alternate History is a relatively obscure genre is that the few major writers tend to have bad stories.  Such as SM Stirling&#39;s Draka series, or the &quot;Axis of Time&quot; Trilogy.  Never heard of those?  Consider yourself lucky.<br><br>If you want to read better Alternate History to see what I&#39;m talking about, here are several published ones you might like.<br><br>First, The Fireflies of Port Stanley.  <br>From the AH.com wiki: &quot;An administrative error by a British Ministry of Defence employee causes the delivery of 3 decommissioned Sherman Firefly tanks and some tank ammunition to the capital of the Falkland Islands in 1955. While members of the local administration are puzzled by the delivery, they keep the three tanks in basic working condition. Fast forward to 1982 and the invasion of the islands by the then Argentine junta… The locals have little time remaining and have to organize a basic defence of the capital until help arrives from the UK. And that&#39;s when the well-preserved Fireflies, until then only a local curiosity, come into play… &quot;  <br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fireflies-Port-Stanley-Marc-Jones-ebook/dp/B00COBGLLA"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fireflies-Port-Stanley-Marc-Jones-ebook/dp/B00COBGLLA">http://www.amazon.com/Fireflies-Port-Stanley-Marc-Jones-ebook/dp/B00COBGLLA</a></a><br><br>The second, and still in progress is a story called &quot;The Whale has Wings.&quot;<br><a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/266885"><a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/266885">https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/266885</a></a><br>If anyone wants to endure 670+ pages of thread derailments and long debates over minutiae to read the original version, see here:<br><a href="http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=224761"><a href="http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=224761">http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=224761</a></a></p>

            <p>From what I can tell, I assume you, like me, are a Circle-Diver. (Are you?) I have actually seen this fic before, while doing my weekly rounds in the Circle, but there were so many badfic that I just turned a blind eye to some. <br><br>This one is particularly painful. *chugs down Bleepka* Ugh, daughter of Varda? Then I suppose we can call Saruman &quot;Son of Aulë&quot; and Radagast &quot;Son of Yavanna&quot;. (No. No, we can&#39;t)  Carita (I simply cannot imagine why Varda would name &quot;her daughter&quot; Carita) has already mentioned that she is a Maia that was created by Varda, not her child, and yet she has the arrogance to claim she is &quot;the daughter of Varda&quot;. And Elvin? It&#39;s Elvish, or Sindarin, or Quenya, not some mangled word derived from Elvis Presley&#39;s first name.<br><br>And yes, as Desdendelle mentioned before, I have already reported &quot;Angelic&quot;. But I suppose it&#39;s my fault I didn&#39;t add it to the Unclaimed Badfic list...:/<br><br>Oh, and here&#39;s the Bleeprin you asked for.

            <p>I am not in the Lord of the Rings fandom, but... Is every LOTR fic in the Circle a Legomance with &quot;Legolas love story&quot; in the title?... Then again, this IS the Circle of <i>Lemmings.</i><br><br>On a related note, could you report bedfic in one of the already oper badfic threads next time? I&#39;m not angry with you or anything, it&#39;s just that using a single badfic thread keeps the board neater and prevents threads with active discussion in them fall off the first page too fast.</p>

Permission isn&#39;t designed to be an impenetrable barrier to anyone ever writing PPC stories - it&#39;s meant to be a ground-level filter. That&#39;s one reason I left my hat firmly off while making comments: I&#39;m very picky about Middle-earth stuff, more so than is necessarily reasonable in PG situations. As I think I said earlier, you&#39;ve been getting very involved in the Board as a community, which is a good thing! Quite a few people show up, post three threads in the space of a day, reply to nothing, and then ask for Permission. You&#39;ve been replying to comments, on both your own threads and other people&#39;s, which is a brilliant way to go about things, so well done!<br><br>As to your characters and writing... well, I&#39;d offer to give advice about how to make Eredan (did you decide on a translation of that, by the way? I think &#39;Mountains-man&#39; works pretty well) realistic for Arda, but I think I already did that. ;) I can also work up a review of your &#39;War of the Worlds&#39; story if you like, since I know both canons to some extent.

            <p>Most of us intended to/have at first, when we were newbies. It&#39;s okay to make a mistake, like what Sergio said. I did intend to do what you did, at first, and I even went so far as to write missions of my own, without Permission or claiming them.

            <p>It was a bit of a mistake, yes, but everyone does mistakes from time to time. Don&#39;t feel bad about it.<br><br>Just enjoy the community, and start thinking about how to improve your agents, or maybe come up with new ones from scratch if you hit a wall.<br><br>The latter possibility is kinda difficult to become absolutely necessary, though - I managed to turn an hopeless Stu of mine into an interesting and fleshed out Agent. Besides, hitting walls hurts. Just remember, come up with a characterization, a backstory, and just some &quot;stat&quot; details (what he&#39;s good at, what he isn&#39;t good at). Then let them grow on their own, write them as it &quot;feels&quot; right to do. They might become a bit different from what you thought at the beginning, but they will be more &quot;alive&quot;.<br><br>... Confused? Don&#39;t worry, I just managed to confuse myself too.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t really like the idea of rushing to get Permission just five days after you joined...but I&#39;m not a Permission Giver (not to mention the fact that I&#39;m rather new, though I joined two months ago [I left for about one-and-a-half months, so...]), so I guess you&#39;ll have to ask the still-active Permission Givers for their opinion.

He tries to be funny, but his attempts normally fail and he is a tad clumsy.<br><br>Family: His only known relatives are his mum, dad and older sister. All his family are devoted to keep the malfunctioning equipment of Vault 53 and, as a result, are sort of mad. He cared for them while they obsessively fixed the equipment and, when the Vault opened, he regretfully left them in the care of the Vault&#39;s other denizens. He hasn&#39;t seen them since.<br><br>Appearance: He is skinny, has beige skin, brown, unkempt hair and a roughly cut goatee.

He, nonetheless, has a strong moral compass and naturally gravitates towards moral choices.<br><br>Family: His known relatives are his mother, uncle and his older brother. His brother is a Dark Brotherhood assassin and his morals conflict with Norkas&#39;. His father died without Norkas having any knowledge of him, so his uncle filled in the position for him when he was young. He was a traveller when he was younger and told Norkas many stories of the outside world, which sparked his wanderlust. His mother is kind, but hasn&#39;t gotten over her husband&#39;s death. Norkas goes back to Helstrom regularly to check on them and to split his money with them.<br><br>Appearance: He has blue tinged scales, 2 horns and hair-feather-things that form a crest down his head.

            <p>He&#39;s looking a lot more suited to where he&#39;s from. I note he still has brown hair (but then, so does Grima the Wormtongue - a little genetic variation is allowed). As to the rest of him...<br><br>Okay, so he&#39;s not a mercenary - but now he doesn&#39;t have a job at all? He must have done <i>something</i> in sixty-three years. You&#39;ve taken away his bow and reduced his fighting skills, so he couldn&#39;t really pass as a hunter any more... the go-to occupation for western Rhovanion would be &#39;woodsman&#39;, but you&#39;ve placed him in the shadow of Gundabad. Hrm...<br><br>Well, let&#39;s talk about Gundabad, and the whole historical setting.<br><br>SA 1000 is a volatile period in the history of Middle-earth. For the past 250 years, the Numenoreans have been exploring the western and southern coastlines, mostly under the command of their current king Tar-Aldarion (reigned 883-1075). Over in the east, Sauron has been slowly building his forces for the past five hundred years; around 1000, he finally has enough confidence to begin building the Barad-dur.<br><br>On the other hand, the elven nation of Eregion is a thriving civilisation, and between it and Gil-Galad&#39;s Lindon, everything west of the Misty Mountains is inhabited by the elves. Greenwood the Great is also elven, and is several thousand years away from becoming &#39;Mirkwood&#39;. Even Lothlorien - then known as Laurelindórenan - already exists, under a Sindarin king (probably Amdír Malgalad).<br><br>The Dwarves, too, are a strong presence. Khazad-Dum is a trading partner of both Eregion and Lorien, and its population is still swelled from the influx after Beleriand fell. Gundabad we don&#39;t know about - it simply didn&#39;t get mentioned enough - but we do know it was one of the most ancient Dwarven fastnesses (and, in fact, the awakening-place of Durin the Deathless). Given the strength of the &#39;Good&#39; presence in the West, and the fact that the Dwarves are, for once, friendly with the elves, it seems fairly likely that Gundabad is inhabited by Dwarves. The Grey Mountains, too, are said to have been &#39;long mined by the Dwarves&#39; - they weren&#39;t driven out until the Third Age.<br><br>But then there&#39;s the north. This cold, barren land, the remnants of Morgoth&#39;s two bastions of Angband and Utumno, is known to be inhabited by the hardy, wandering Forodwaith, who at least are men. But it is also likely home to a whole bunch of nasty creatures: the cold-drakes who later conquered the Grey Mountains would have lived here, and it&#39;s entirely possible that the whole place was teeming with Orc warrens and Wargs. The land that would become Angmar is also very nearby.<br><br>So what, ultimately, does this mean for Eredan? It means a life in comparative safety, punctuated by short periods of terror when Something came over the mountains. It means the local friendly people are the Dwarves, who are notably secretive, and are probably only glimpsed occasionally (bear in mind that Gundabad is by way of being a holy site - they wouldn&#39;t be inviting in visitors, you know?). It means that there are constant, disturbing rumours from the south of the Men of Westernesse, who come in their great ships, cutting down the ancient forest, and while they aren&#39;t exactly out to get the inhabitants, they&#39;re not exactly here to make friends, either. It means the elves are a constant presence - but already slightly unearthly. Both the humans - who, 1500 years ago, stopped their march west and settled in the Vale of Anduin - and the elves - Silvan folk who halted in the same place even longer ago, led by the Sindarin King Oropher (who claims to have escaped from that mythical western land before it sank) - are &#39;backwards&#39;, never having lived alongside the Noldor or the Edain.<br><br>On the plus side, both Oropher and the Dwarves would have made <i>some</i> effort to teach the humans basic sanitation. I think you&#39;re pushing things with an age of 63, and you&#39;re definitely into unreasonable with his parents hitting their 80s (bear in mind, these people aren&#39;t Edain - they don&#39;t have the extended lifespan of the Numenoreans), but take ten years off each of them and you&#39;re into reasonable territory.<br><br>-His parents have a farm. That&#39;s entirely reasonable, and probably what Eredan did for a &#39;living&#39; when he still lived with them. What he does now, I&#39;m not sure - his skills suggest thief or hunter, but he doesn&#39;t have the fighting ability of a hunter, and there&#39;s no-one around to steal from.<br><br>Hrm... would you mind a suggestion? Keeping his backstory the same, have him hear stories of the Numenoreans (by way of the Dwarves, or maybe the woodland elves - second- or third-hand, at any rate). Have him hear about their encampments and their logging down in the south, and have him decide he&#39;s going to go and see them - given his personality, it would be because he wanted something (maybe even one of those legendary swords?).<br><br>So he goes south, probably in his late twenties. He hikes down Anduin, passing by such places as the High Pass (and a party of Noldor from Eregion, tall and actually quite scary, with stars in their gaze...), and Lorien/Khazad-Dum, until finally he enters the ancient woodlands of the south (of which Fangorn is just the northern reach - but the Ents are a power in the world, too...). Finally, passing over open fields through what would later be the Gap of Rohan, he can reach the river Greyflood, and the Numenorean city at Tharbad, or maybe the haven at Lond Daer...<br><br>... only to find that the Men of the West aren&#39;t even as nice as rumour would have it. They are, basically, stuck-up, convinced of their own superiority, prone to treating the locals as little more than slaves. And the worst part is, they&#39;re right about how much better they are... about all Eredan can do is get a job as a lumberjack (because the Numenoreans, they love their trees).<br><br>So now you have an angry, serious man with a knack for going unseen, in the employ of the most powerful nation in the world. And he&#39;s cutting down the ancient forests (which means he might well run into Ents), and he still wants one of those swords - and there&#39;s not really enough food in the work camps, and &#39;them in the city&#39; have so much, they wouldn&#39;t miss a <i>little</i>...<br><br>And now you have someone with a fully-fledged backstory, chock full of potential conflict once he joins the PPC. How will he feel about the rich? What will he do when he sees a sword he likes? Will he be prone to taking offense when others talk down to him?<br><br>I dunno. But I think he&#39;d be interesting to read about.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Okay, taking off my Permission Giver hat for a minute...<br><br>Eredan. First off, that name - it looks like you&#39;ve copied it from Elladan. It&#39;s definitely Sindarin in form, at any rate. The first syllable could be ered- (mountains) or eredh- (seed), or concievably ereg- (holly). The second... well, -dan is a preposition (against), or I guess it could be contracted from -dant (a fall). <i>Very possibly</i> it could be from -adan (man), but that would require the first syllable to be ered. Ered-adan, or Eredan, would be &#39;Man of the mountains&#39;, which I guess works.<br><br>Secondly, his home. &#39;A valley between the Grey and Misty Mountains&#39; could mean one of two things: either he is from the region around Angmar and the Orc stronghold of Gundabad, or he is from the vale of Anduin. The latter would make sense, but would be a very strange way of putting it.<br><br>Thirdly, his heritage. Um... no. There are precisely three successful human-elf marriages in history: Beren and Luthien, Tuor and Idril, Aragorn and Arwen. All three are strongly implied to be deliberate acts of divinity, or at least Fate. There is one known <i>failed</i> marriage of this kind - Aegnor and Andreth, who never got together. There&#39;s also the rumoured case of Imrazôr and Mithrellas, the founders of Dol Amroth.<br><br>Elves and humans <i>do not marry</i> except in very rare circumstances. You can&#39;t just add a new one without some very strong justification. And even if you did...<br><br>His age. Yes, the Eldar live for thousands of years. Yes, the children of elf-human marriages may do the same. But since the founding of Numenor, and by direct decree of the Valar, every half-elf has to make a choice: to be accounted among the Eldar, with all that implies, or to accept the Gift of Men and become mortal. Elrond married an elf, so his children get to make the same choice. The children of a half-elf and a human - such as the children of Aragorn and Arwen - are mortal. An immortal human such as you describe simply doesn&#39;t fit into Middle-earth - unless his life is unnaturally lengthened by a Ring of Power. Are you claiming that Eredan has hold of one of the dwarven Rings (the only ones unaccounted for)? If so, surely that&#39;s kind of important to mention. If not, he&#39;s pretty darn dead.<br><br>His equipment. An elvish cloak - where did he get that? He&#39;s insular and from an isolated village, but has extremely rare fabric. Fabric, of course, doesn&#39;t last all that long - probably a bit longer than normal if the Eldar make it, but I&#39;m positive it wouldn&#39;t survive six thousand years. And a Numenorean sword - again, where&#39;d that come from? The Men of Westernesse didn&#39;t go into the north of Middle-earth.<br><br>And he uses his bow as a walking stick. Nice idea, but springy wood is not actually suited for supporting a man&#39;s body-weight, which is what a staff like that is meant for. He would break it in short order.<br><br>His appearance. Again, you claim he&#39;s immortal, but give him a beard. The Eldar - even by adoption - do not grow beards unless they are <i>incredibly</i> old, like Cirdan. No.<br><br>And his &#39;old job&#39;. &#39;Wanderer&#39; is not a job. You don&#39;t just &#39;wander&#39;, particularly if you live between two inhospitable mountain ranges and Mirkwood, not noted for its friendliness to foragers. &#39;Mercenary&#39; is more plausible - except that there&#39;s no indication of <i>any</i> mercenaries in the history of Middle-earth. That probably comes out of the fact that the bad guys are usually ruled by genuine dark gods - saying &#39;I&#39;ll only fight the forces of the incarnation of darkness if you pay me&#39; will not go down well.<br><br>And, one more point on his appearance: we actually know of some people who live in that general area. They were called the Northmen at the time, but eventually migrated south and named themselves after their great leader, Eorl. The Rohirrim, you may notice, are all fair-haired. There&#39;s a reason for that: the Northmen are closely related to the First House of the Edain, that of Hador the Goldenhaired. The people of that region, by and large, are blond - not brown-haired.<br><br>So: you may have put a lot of thought into him, but I believe it went into the wrong things. Your character is not suited for an origin in Middle-earth.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well, he is my first LoTR OC and I just rehashed some old ideas with him. But not to fear, I improved him based on your critique. Here it is;<br><br>Name: Eredan<br><br>Gender: Male<br><br>Old Job: Mercenary<br><br>Birthdate: SA circa. 1000 January 23rd<br><br>Age: 63<br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Original Continuum: Lord of the Rings<br><br>Home: An un-named hamlet in a valley in the shadow of Mt. Gundabad<br><br>Strong Skills: Swordsmanship, Archery, Surivival, Agility<br><br>Personality: He is insular and humourless. He only speaks when necessary and always takes things seriously. He is quick to anger. He is uneducated.<br><br>Apperance: He has long, brown, very messy and unkempt hair and a matching beard. He is skinny and stinks. He is slightly taller than normal.<br><br>Gear: He wears a grey/green cloak over a brown tunic, ripped breaches, old fur boots and a makeshift knapsack over his back. He has a Numenorean sword (which he purchaased fairly, no matter what others would say) on his belt and carries a yew longbow around with him. He has (stolen) orcish arrows sticking out of his knapsack. (He has no idea how to make his own)<br><br>Much better, don&#39;tcha think?</p>

            <p>Okay, I&#39;m a bit concerned here. I&#39;ll take my cue from hS and leave the PG hat off for now, but I can give you some concrit on your characters - and as an answer to your question about posting your characters specifically before a formal request... I&#39;d prefer you didn&#39;t - at least, not over and over again. Once - this, for example - shouldn&#39;t be too bad. And remember, this is a writing organization, not an RP, so we&#39;re looking more at seeing them <i>written</i> than just sketched profiles. <br><br>My biggest beef with Eredan is that he still doesn&#39;t seem like an LotR character. He seems rather like a Fantasy or a D&amp;D character who got plopped into that continuum. Mercenaries weren&#39;t really a big thing, from what I remember, except for the Southrons, perhaps. Why would a mercenary have a Numenorean sword? What do you mean by a Numenorean sword? The rest of his character I&#39;ll leave to hS, who&#39;s far better at LotR than I. Your others... h&#39;m.<br><br>Norkas the Lonely... to put it bluntly, he looks a lot like a Stu. I can&#39;t think of any reason for an Argonian to be thousands of years old. Even the Heroes aren&#39;t supposed to live thousands of years, except for a handful of very excellent canon reasons. He should have a profession - &#39;Wanderer&#39; is not a living. Adventurer would be a bit better, but just wandering around is not so viable. Combine all that with his weapons, which are honestly quite a bit high on the Speshul scale, and you&#39;ve got a character I&#39;d be very, very hesitant to pass off as a PPC agent.<br><br>I don&#39;t know Archer, but let me try and give you a couple general pointers. It&#39;s not always easy to make OCs from scratch, especially the first time, and I know my first OCs, especially game-based, were about the same.<br><br>First, their appearance and equipment are sidenotes. Think about your friends, your family - what makes them so important to you? Not their hair, not their jacket, not the necklace they inherited from their grandparents. It&#39;s their personality, their mannerisms, <i>who</i> they are. Their clothes and hair and height and the equipment of their various skills are part of who they are, but they&#39;re pieces of a puzzle, not the whole.<br><br>While reading a Skyrim fanfic, if you came across an Argonian whose introduction was a paragraph about his swords and clothing, and his coloration, followed by a few lines that explained that he was mysteriously ageless and a humourless fellow... I&#39;m betting you wouldn&#39;t be very emotionally invested in the character. If you came across a character whose dialogue was interesting - blunt, dour, somewhat haughty, but witty enough to be able to joke and laugh - you&#39;d be a bit more interested. And then, somewhere down the line, it&#39;s revealed that he lived through the White-Gold Concordat, and the bloodshed that followed... now he&#39;s got depth, now you&#39;re interested.<br><br>You see what I mean? What your character is wearing doesn&#39;t matter so much - what matters is <i>why</i> they wear their hair braided like that (because appearance matters to them), and <i>why</i> they have that ratty old jacket, even though they could clearly afford better (appearance matters to them, but the jacket was something given to them by a dear friend, now dead), and not that they have a really awesome sword, but what they do with that sword, and <i>why</i>, and <i>who they are</i> under the dwemer-alloy and the Destruction school, and the green-gray scales.</p>

            <p>Hmm, I like the concept he seems like he would make a good generic mook in sauorn&#39;s army and it makes sense for him to be Human. From what I understand of the canon the &quot;Kings of Man&quot; were the ones corrupted by thier power rings thus leading them to become the ringwraiths, So a Human driven by greed...which is often the fatal flaw of Mercenary characters would be a natural fit.</p>

            <p>... doesn&#39;t actually seem to be mentioned on the Permission page anymore. <br><br>The answer to the question &#39;When should I ask?&#39; is currently &#39;Whenever you feel comfortable and confident asking&#39; - it then goes on to say that you&#39;re unlikely to be successful if the Permission Givers don&#39;t recognise you, but notes that &#39;there is no one magical time period&#39; for how long that&#39;s likely to take. <br><br>I&#39;m sure it used to specify one month as a general rule, as I&#39;m pretty sure I can remember waiting <i>exactly</i> one month before making my request, but it doesn&#39;t appear to be as specific any more. <br><br>I agree with you, this is probably too early for 99Hedgehog&#39;s Permission request, but with the page as it currently is, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that clear.  </p>

            <p>Specificially on her song, Burqa/Aura. I heard the song leaked on youtube, and I am rather impressed by her lyrics.<br><br>Before I start typing, let me give a rundown on the plot. It&#39;s about a guy who loves Lady Gaga somuch that he wants to marry her, and despite his family&#39;s disapproval, continues with his plan. But a religious leader he asked for advice convinces him to drop the idea, as he has no idea of who Lady Gaga really is, and what he loves is only her character onstage, not her real self.<br><br>Now, my questions.<br><br>1. How do songfics work? I read a few, but I can&#39;t make head nor tail. Are there any songfics you recommend, as reference?<br><br>2. Does this fall under Real-Person Fic? I have doubts it is so. Since she wants to be addressed as Lady Gaga whenever she&#39;s giving interviews and performances and whatnot. But then, she&#39;s just making herself a performance art when she&#39;s outside, and her true identity as Stefanie Germanotta will remain hidden from the public.<br><br>Second question is more important than the first, as I only want to write a songfic pf Lady gaga&#39;s Aura, not a stalkerfic of Stefanie Germanotta. In Malaysia, I have seen TV shows that employ a character called &#39;Lady Gaga&#39; (more of a mockery of her based on her video clip in Just Dance), so as a citizen, I can almost assure you, there isn&#39;t any laws against writing Real-Person Fics. Except for politicians, even then there&#39;s never a case recorded.<br><br>Apologies beforehand if this post angers you.</p>

            <p>Does anyone know <i>Red Dwarf</i>? I&#39;ve got a mission written up, and could do with a second opinion on it.<br><br>Not much canon knowledge is needed, as the entire fic takes place in the first episode of the first series, although my agents do refer to various things from later on.</p>
