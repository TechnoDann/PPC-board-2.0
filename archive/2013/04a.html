            <p>So, it&#39;s back. It&#39;s got 67 chapters now. And Spock has gained a &#39;ghostly&#39; smile.<br><br>Can I just--?

What the--<br><br>Ok, ok, let&#39;s try to calm down...<br><br>Anyway. Spock sings to squirrels. Bloody *squirrels*. And there&#39;s a repeated misspelling of t&#39;hy&#39;la (or am I misspelling it too, and it&#39;s t&#39;hyla? No, I think there are two apostrophes. At any rate, it&#39;s definitely not thyla!) And--Spock&#39;s way too emotional.

And Janice Rand, who shouldn&#39;t even *be* there since she&#39;s not in AOS, sings Meg&#39;s part, with Gaila (or her mini-tribble counterpart), Uhura, and Chapel singing the Muses&#39; part.

            <p>Still, even the idea of Spock singing to squirrels made my eyes twitch.<br><br>Great, now you&#39;ve got a grinning Spock ghost to get rid of. I&#39;d recommend getting something from one of the many ghost-battling universes to capture it. A Proton Pack from Ghostbusters would probably be a good choice, but they only had what, four?

            <p>Well, the only &quot;ghosts&quot; in Star Trek were the anaphasic entities, like the one in that grob-awful TNG episode where Beverly Crusher&#39;s grandmother dies and then everyone decides to spend weeks on the Scotland Planet for some reason. Disregarding the episode&#39;s quality, the anaphasic entities were more like psychic parasites than they were like ghosts, despite how the one from the Scotland Planet&#39;s entire character seemed to be based on saying &quot;No, I&#39;m a ghost, really I am!&quot;.<br>There are a few species that can rip out someone&#39;s mind and toss it into space, like the Ux-Mal were, but that&#39;s not becoming a ghost, that&#39;s just extremely cruel and unusual punishment.<br><br>With the absence of real ghosts in the continuum, I&#39;d worry about the continuum taking the next best thing and manifesting him as a Thasian. They were probably the most powerful beings in TOS, and your agents definitely would not want Telekinetic!Thasian!Emotional!Ghost!Spock running around the place.<br><br>However, if there are no Ghost Rules implied at all, you may be able to impose an outside continuum&#39;s Ghost Rules on Ghost!Spock, similar to how an agent can impose a canonical surrounding on undescribed badfic locations. Then, you could just deal with him however the canon you chose deals with ghosts.<br><br>Maybe the agents could pretend to ally with Emotional!Spock as a distraction for fighting Ghost!Spock, tricking the former into thinking that he&#39;d be able to assume Spock&#39;s position if he won, and then trap them both when they start going for each other&#39;s throats. It&#39;d be a rare opportunity, since a Suvian entity rarely displaces another Suvian entity unless the one it replaces is a Canon Sue.<br><br>I&#39;ll read the songfic later. I&#39;m planning out a few story ideas right now, and I&#39;d like to be sane for that.</p>

            <p>There are some fandoms that have a pretty small amount of fics, which, unfortunately, makes it a lot easier to find badfics. I&#39;m part of too many of these sorts of fandoms.<br><br>Anyway, all of these are Rune Factory 3 fanfics, all rated T.<br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7529458/1/Half-Breeded-Kitty">Half-Breeded-Kitty</a>, by <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3351641/Mirakira98">Mirakira98</a>.<br>Mary Sue who can transform into a non-canon monster (i.e. a <i>catgirl</i>, I kid ye not), bad SPaG, OOC canons, and a whole chapter that says &#39;Sharon&#39; in place of &#39;Shara&#39;. Also it&#39;s 17 chapters. I skimmed three, and had a peek at 16, which includes a potion turning her into a man. Although admittedly, that&#39;s probably <i>in</i> character for the girl who made the potion.<br><br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8786131/1/Rune-Factory-3">Rune Factory 3</a>, by <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2704373/Twilightcrystalflame">Twilightcrystalflame</a>.<br>Mary Sue again, called Platina, who is obviously going for the dwarf blacksmith. Very imaginative name there. A complete lack of SPaG, including hige chunks of un-paragraphed text and many missing spaces. Pointless POV changes, the first of which also includes a switch from third person past tense to first person present tense. Obviously not a one shot, but is still only the one chapter. Plus the title of the fic is the name of the game it&#39;s based on. Imagination combo x2!<br><br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7261996/1/Sleep-Over-Fun">Sleep Over Fun!</a>, by <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1585657/digimonfan4ever101">digimonfan4ever101</a>.<br>Bad SPaG. (&quot;Uuuh… sorry! We thought you make party!&quot; apologized Sakuya, the rest is bowed to him.) The writer&#39;s profile says they&#39;re from Indonesia, but they should still have used spell-check and a beta. And they made a guy do farm work in his boxers.</p>

            <p>Well, the game basically works the same, really. There&#39;s only the obvious differences (characters, places, storyline). I&#39;m not sure how much you could do with them without knowing the characters, though. Some of them are a little odd. <s>Like the two who speak in opposites.</s></p>

            <p>Lots of us have agents that were/are RP characters. I tend to think of separate RPs as alternate universes as far as a shared character is concerned, and the different instances of the character don&#39;t necessarily have to have anything to do with each other. They can if you want them to, though. Plenty of PPC agents have some level of awareness that they are characters, even if it&#39;s something they push to the back of their minds most of the time.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The only reason I haven&#39;t reviewed before is that I&#39;m not very familiar with Doctor Who, so I can&#39;t comment on much in the story - except that I understood it all up till the end with the cocky American guy. That shows a lot of skill on your part, because like I said, my knowledge of Doctor Who is shaky. It&#39;s basically cobbled together from references on the Internet and from listening to friends talk about it.<br><br>So, yeah. Good job! </p>

            <p>And I&#39;m not saying it because my Agents are in it, I swear! (Though I liked how you handled them)<br><br>Three small mistakes about them, though:<br><br>- The rifle is called M82A1, not M281. Also, Sergio can&#39;t fire it while standing (it has to be fired from its bipod while prone), but we can justify it as Rule of Cool.<br>We had the Doctor fighting alongside our Agents, after all. Nothing beats that in coolness.<br>- It&#39;s Nikki Cherryflower, not Cherryblossom. I did think about calling her that, but I decided against it as it would have been too blatant. (She&#39;s a clone of Sakura Kinomoto, and &quot;Sakura&quot; has the meaning of &quot;cherry blossom&quot;)<br>- Nikki is the grenade specialist, not Sergio. It&#39;s fairly minor (Sergio can use grenades too), but I think it would be nice to make her do something.</p>

            <p>I loved how the old-timey dialogue from the Transfictional Canonical Defense Authority members was interspersed with modern-style grievances against the PPC technology. Ah, DoSAT. Even given the vast probabilistic distance between multiverses, you still never change.<br><br>The Doctor&#39;s description mentioned that he had braces. Unless that&#39;s dialect for &quot;suspenders&quot; or he got injured in one of the Series Seven episodes I didn&#39;t watch yet, that may be a phrasing problem.<br>Also, which continuum&#39;s wraiths/Wraiths was Eledhwen referring to?<br><br>So the Mongoose Shelter is finally mentioned somewhere. I was never sure what it was for, but it&#39;s nice to know that it still exists. I only wonder where all of the mongooses come from? There can&#39;t be <i>that</i> many spawned by Phrasing Mishaps.<br><br>Ah, so there <i>was</i> a showdown after all! Well, a showdown of sorts, but a showdown that&#39;s solved by a grenade and a Time Lord throwing playground jibes is still a showdown. Will that instance of the Reality Room still work after this? The Room&#39;s properties would make the grenade explosion actually leave permanent damage. Not structural damage, because it&#39;s still HQ, but it&#39;d be nasty.</p>

            <p>At last! A character of mine who doesn&#39;t read like all my other characters!<br><br>It&#39;s actually really interesting to see how someone else writes Morgan III, particularly given the current lack of source material (in fact, you&#39;ve just <i>written</i> the source material). I enjoyed the dialogue about the fall of Gallifrey and the segue into Sues - and also this:<br><br><i>“Sues can be rewritten,” retorted the Doctor.<br><br>“But when they’re rewritten, they’re not the same Sue.”</i><br><br>Which reminds me both of the Doctor&#39;s favourite tagline, of River&#39;s response (&quot;Not those times. Not one line! Don&#39;t you dare!&quot;), and of Gandalf and Saruman&#39;s exchange about the colour of Saruman&#39;s robes:<br><br><i>&quot;I liked white better,&quot; I said. <br><br>&quot;White!&quot; he sneered. &quot;It serves as a beginning. White cloth may be dyed. The white page can be overwritten; and the white light can be broken.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In which case it is no longer white,&quot; said I.</i><br><br>(And who said there&#39;s no humour in Lord of the Rings?)<br><br>I also really like your A/V techs - I can tell they&#39;re from the same Department-sorry-Division as Adam and Frenchie. And... oh dear stars, now you&#39;ve put the thought of a meeting between Captain Jack and Agent Lux in my head... or worse, an alliance...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I am loving this crossover so much. The Meatloaf Monster is perfectly crazy for HQ, and the inclusion of the steam-punk universe is going to make things extra interesting. The meeting of the Time Lords was great, and while more hostile then I expected the meeting to be, it made perfect sense.<br><br>Actually, speaking of the parallel universe barrier falling: could the Enforcers of the Plot Continuum be trying to get in? Or successfully getting in? That might be interesting, to see the Doctor fight a Mary Sue without being brainwashed by their Aura of Smooth. I know the Doctor have enough problems to deal with, but it may be interesting. Just a thought.<br><br>You know, I think I may have to write a blackout story after all. You brought in the timberwolves, so now I&#39;m seeing the Everfree Forest attached to HQ, and Marvin and Printworthy have to go around and try to calm, or destroy, the beasties. After all, they are members of the All Purpose: My Little Pony devision. Then they can come across some Aperture Science hallways, perhaps with GLaDOS trying to extend her reach over HQ. That could be interesting.<br>(Says the guy who still has not finished the first mission. Or sent the interlude to be beta read yet...)<br><br>Until the next update, I will sit back and try to write. Real Life gets in the way far too often.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s such a pity that the RP thread started and ended while I was on holiday without internet, otherwise I would have joined in. I had some ideas about part of DTE being in Knightmare (possibly related to the magic mechanic of that series: literal spellcasting, where you have to spell out the spell to cast it, e.g. &quot;Spellcasting: T-E-L-E-P-O-R-T&quot; for a teleport spell). You bet Eagrus would approve of magic like that.</p>

            <p>In fact, there was a short discussion of that in the previous blackout thread. The more stories in the blackout&#39;s time frame, the better, and if we get enough, it&#39;ll effectively make everything involved Officially Stuff That Really Happened. If you still want to write the story, go for it!<br><br>Wait, so Knightmare&#39;s magic system is based on a bad pun? I was all set to be annoyed by that, but puns like that are just too ridiculous for me to be mad at.<br>Can the casters draw on a wall or something to use the spell, or does it only work if they say it out loud? What if they needed to do something specific, like R-E-M-O-V-E-O-N-L-Y-T-H-E-O-T-H-E-R-W-I-Z-A-R-D-S? The other wizards could just cast Q-U-I-E-T and counteract it before the first one had even finished talking.<br>The Knightmare-verse wizards are probably masters of finding synonyms in stressful situations.</p>

            <p>I just watched it, and given that Amy has a &quot;Handbook to Traveling Through the Universe&quot;, the TARDIS has an &quot;Adventure&quot; setting, a human is capable of outrunning a Weeping Angel, and the Sonic Screwdriver is suddenly capable of blowing a Weeping Angel&#39;s arm off when that setting would have made three separate canonical encounters much easier, that Weeping Angel inexplicably hating the Olympics, which is just confusing and goes against most every canonical fact about them, and to top it all off, the minisode lets the Weeping Angel into the TARDIS when we know that to be a Very Bad Thing.

            <p>Children lack the understanding of boundaries that comes with writing fan fiction. They were told from the start of writing class to be creative and that they can do anything when they write. These children may have seen selective bits of the canon, only the parts with Matt Smith in it, and/or not at all (most decent writers know well that they have to know their stuff, whether that be the canon or something else).<br><br>It&#39;s somewhat plausible that the TARDIS could develop an Adventure setting, probably something like the Random function I just put into the Portal generator. Amy could&#39;ve found an old book that the Doctor had in his library. And like I said, the sonic increased the energy of the torch which somehow made the Angel explode, which would have made better sense if it was anything other than a stick of fire, since fire doesn&#39;t do much damage to stone.<br><br>It&#39;s not canon, but it doesn&#39;t mean little details can&#39;t be pulled from it. I personally think the Handbook would be a good addition to the TARDIS library, even if the Doctor finds himself yelling at the pages every time he reads it because he&#39;s done everything the book told him not to do.</p>

            <p>And hey, for kids, it&#39;s pretty impressive. I know when I was eight, I wasn&#39;t even able to keep my writing on the same topic for half a page, so compared to me from then, they&#39;re practically Hemingway. &quot;Good as Gold&quot; was still a mess, but at it&#39;s a mess that at least resembles the source material. I&#39;m still annoyed at the arbitrary rules set in the Handbook and the massive breaches on how the Weeping Angels work, but it could have been much worse. <br><br>Still, I was more confused than anything that that particular script was selected as the contest winner. Considering the scale of Doctor Who&#39;s influence, it should have been easy to find one that doesn&#39;t play out as contradictory to established rules.<br><br>I don&#39;t know how many groups entered, but seeing how Doctor Who is a Big Deal Television Show, they probably got hundreds, if not thousands, of scripts, and they went with the one that neutered the Weeping Angels(which to make it even more inexplicable were the current showrunner&#39;s malevolent darlings), unintentionally created capability for impossible speed in an Olympic torch bearer, and retreads a time frame that had already been shown before in Ten&#39;s run.<br><br>Oh, look at me, going on about something that&#39;s already been decided as non-canon and can&#39;t be changed at any rate because it was filmed over a year ago. Now I feel like I&#39;m just whining. I wasn&#39;t trying to whine, but it read like whining when I looked it over for typos just now. Bluh.</p>

            <p>For both agents, I mean. We can assume this is some time after the RP, so Gaspard did get down from his tree.<br><br>A bit of advice for writing each character, if you decide to fit them in later on:<br><br><u>Harris</u>: lives to impress others with his achievements/epic fails. A vain character who takes great pride in his appearance. Said want to impress is not out of snobbishness: he truly does want to be recognized as having done something great and wonderful during his time in the PPC. Of course, said want to prove himself has nearly gotten himself maimed/drowned/burnt a couple times. If you can get past his massively inflated ego, you&#39;ll find a very polite and well-behaved young man, if a little boring to talk to. <br><br><u>Gaspard</u>: his <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Gaspard_De_Grasse#Personality%22"> character page</a> should do the trick. He&#39;d also be instant bowtie-buddies with the Doctor if he ever meets him.<br><br>If it&#39;s not too much trouble, I&#39;d like to have a look at their parts if they ever appear. I&#39;ve got <i>plans</i> for both of them, so I&#39;m setting the stage for the future.<br><br>Do you still need my email or do you already have it?</p>

            <p>That&#39;s kind of an obscure reference, now that I think about it, so feel free to ignore it.<br><br>Oh, yes, Agent Omicron shows up somewhere! I&#39;ve always wanted to see him used. He showed up in literally a single sentence in his only other appearance, which was disappointing. One of the only Daleks in HQ to survive the Crashing Down, and nobody seemed to care.<br>I can just see the Doctor running into him and Agent Charlie(a Classic Who Imperial Dalek; he showed up in one of Tawaki&#39;s missions and never appeared again) sliding down a hallway, talking shop. And, of course, for two Daleks, talking shop is almost always going to be about efficient methods for murder, but then again, that&#39;s shop talk for <i>most</i> Assassins.<br><br>The dialogue with the Doctor and the Cafeteria Workers was absolute gold, even though I didn&#39;t recognize any of the Workers.

Having steampunk doubles would already invoke some crazy dimensional reacharounds, but the possibility of having brainwashed Sue-fused doubles in addition to that would just get everything much nastier much more quickly, and the Doctor&#39;s got enough on his plate (Hey! a pun!) with the-cafeteria-beast-that-shall-not-be-named.</p>

            <p>But it is possible to modify the game so that it&#39;s playable for two.

            <p>The one-department-only Cafeterias probably wouldn&#39;t be enmeshed enough into HQ&#39;s systems to black out the entire complex, and so the smaller ones would probably be restricted to their individual areas.<br><br>Plus, if a canon character tried to bust into... say, the DIA&#39;s headquarters for example, claiming he&#39;d dropped in through a rip in space and ask to be led to their Cafeteria... well, I shouldn&#39;t need to say what the Agents would do in response, but in case you were wondering, it includes the words &quot;high-powered tranquilizer&quot;.</p>

            <p>Hold on, let me back that up. OK, so Jumper is from another &#39;section&#39; of the multiverse and travels to fictional worlds. Part of his explanation of how he can do this is that there are natural holes in the universes where information escapes. You know the legends where a guy whispers something into the earth and the wind takes what the guy said to some vilagers? The information flows something like that, only sentient races, such as humans, receive this information as story ideas. The ideas are written, things are given some artistic licences, and a stronger &#39;link&#39; between the worlds are formed. While this was longer-winded then what the Doctor said, the premise was similar in the writer &#39;tunes in&#39; to worlds that are fictional here, but very real elsewhere. Then Jumper came to the PPC and his life got flipped, turned upside down. <br><br>As always, exelent story here. Hope to see the fourth part shortly, where we discover what is lurking in the kitchen.</p>

            <p>Especially in all the Doctor-visits-Tolkien/Rowling/Lewis sorts of fics. I know at least one Potterwho fic has the premise that Rowling has a subconscious psychic link to the Wizarding world that allowed her to create Harry Potter.<br><br>I mean sometimes it might even seem feasible. When I write, I like to picture the action happening in my head. It can, sometimes, feel extremely realistic, like it&#39;s actually happening somewhere.</p>

            <p>You missed a space, by the way. It should be &quot;But what&quot;, not &quot;Butwhat&quot;.<br><br>The Cafeteria, eh? Maybe we&#39;ll finally get to see the Flower that runs it. I&#39;ve always thought it was a Rafflesia, but that&#39;s based on both massive speculation and the fact that a Rafflesia would have plenty to feed on with all the uneaten food that&#39;s left behind. Rafflesia nutrient-absorption systems are weird.<br><br>Clara&#39;s disappearance will at least be easy to resolve. As somebody that I don&#39;t remember their name said, in HQ, the place is so time-distorted anyway that someone time-shifted by a Weeping Angel would probably just turn up in a hallway at the other end of the place.<br><br>When Captain Dandy called Christianne &quot;constable&quot;, I got a brief mental image of everyone in the scene wearing Victorian &quot;peeler&quot; uniforms and holding nightsticks. It looked especially amusing on the Angel.<br><br>Whoverse Tolkien must have been some guy. Which incarnation of The Doctor met him? The Doctor said he had a pipe when Tolkien traveled with him, but I don&#39;t remember any pipe-smoking Doctors. (checks the Doctor Who wiki) Oh, wow. The First Doctor. The Doctor knows Tolkien from waaaay back.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s on Netflix, if you have that. And seriously, you have no idea how much awesome you&#39;ll have on your hands. <i>Farscape</i> is my favorite show ever, not just for <i>a</i> reason, but for <i>all the reasons</i>. All of them. <sup>_<sup><br><br>That</sup></sup> particular episode, &quot;Crackers Don&#39;t Matter,&quot; happens to be one of the best, IMO, and one that really captures the essence of the show. It&#39;s zany, it&#39;s clever, the bad guy is a legitimate threat, and it shows the main characters overcoming problems foreign and domestic in creative ways. That episode has one of the best payoffs; fortunately, the wiki article doesn&#39;t spoil it, because you really have to see it to appreciate it. It&#39;ll knock your socks off. {= D<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Whatever it is, it would have to be either desperate or very confident to use HQ in that way, especially since, as an invader, it wouldn&#39;t know what it was up against.<br>Plus, if it was in the Cafeteria, it would probably have been <u>able</u> to hide out for some time sapping energy slowly, but the massive power outage all at once implies that it&#39;s due to the drainer of that power suddenly deciding to perform a task requiring lots of energy rather than needing it simply to continue existing.<br>It probably shouldn&#39;t be from the Doctor Who universe; he&#39;s fought the Weeping Angels already, and it wouldn&#39;t be fun just to see him running down a list of Who nasties. An entity such as an Osmosian would have the motive to sap HQ&#39;s power, but they&#39;re human-sized, as are most species like them in fiction, and their power-sapping ability just wouldn&#39;t be enough to knock the whole grid out, and even if it did, it would only be for a few seconds. If the power drainer is some sort of artifact, there&#39;d be more explanation than it&#39;s worth figuring out why it&#39;s in the Cafeteria and why it only activated now as opposed to earlier or later than it would probably be worth to introduce it.<br><br>With that in mind, I&#39;ve got a few ideas, but they&#39;re a bit shaky. Metroids and Stargate&#39;s Replicators are known for their energy-absorbing powers, especially the former, and they are both driven by a need to produce more like themselves. If a Metroid Queen or a powerful enough Replicator got into HQ, it would have been able to enter the Cafeteria(this part would be easy for the Replicator, as most models are quite small) and heal itself on whatever it&#39;s drawing the energy from. After it&#39;s done, it would increase the process, in preparation for reproduction.<br>If this goes on, the Metroids could be relocated, but the entire stock of Replicators would have to be destroyed. We can&#39;t have Replicators going back to their home canon with any knowledge or power whatsoever from more advanced continua than theirs, let alone HQ. Just them learning what androids were practically wiped out human civilization; learning about plot hole transport could easily break a galaxy..<br><br>There are other species that the same idea as above or a similar one could work with, but it&#39;s late and I can&#39;t remember them all.<br><br>I had another two ideas for why the power might be being drained, but one was, I now realize, a blatant ripoff of the Cataclysm part of Legends of Metru Nui, and the other I can&#39;t think of any species examples for. The latter one basically amounted to some entities forcibly draining HQ&#39;s power to restore their own, or build themselves physcial forms, or something of that sort. It&#39;s a bit clichй, and not at all finished, but I don&#39;t have a better one right now. I probably will later, though.</p>

            <p>So, while trawling around the wiki, snatching up shiny things left and right, I suddenly found I had three questions that needed answering. <br><br>Question the First: Is it acceptable to add to the list of Things I Will Not Do In The PPC? And if so, may I?<br><br>Question the Second: How far does the average agent&#39;s sanity stretch before it snaps completely? <br><br>Question the Third: What is the difference between SHINY things and just plain shiny things?<br><br>As you can see, these are very important and philosophical questions.</p>

            <p>(Not that you personally need to be told this, Bausiren, but it&#39;s been an issue in the past, so I think it bears saying. {= ) )<br><br>There is sometimes a tendency to confuse the mostly harmless combination of idiosyncratic nuttiness, defense mechanisms, and survival tactics that most agents possess with either actual insanity—the kind that gets people arrested and/or committed—or what Phobos and I refer to as &quot;Chaotic Stupid,&quot; which is what you get when someone goes &quot;well, my character is Chaotic, so they have to do random crazy things that make no sense! It&#39;s <i>in character</i>.&quot; Substitute &quot;insane&quot; for &quot;Chaotic,&quot; and it&#39;s the same bad excuse for choosing randomness and stupidity over actual characterization.<br><br>Being insane in the PPC does not mean being a sadistic psychopath, and equally it does not mean throwing all reason and consistency to the wind. Rather, the phrase &quot;there&#39;s a method to her madness&quot; applies. People tend to have reasons for doing things, even if the things they do wouldn&#39;t make sense by &quot;normal&quot; standards. That&#39;s PPC-crazy: the weird, quirky things agents do to keep it (mostly) together from mission to mission.<br><br>Make sense?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>In addition to the concerns Neshomeh raised, I&#39;d add that it would be very good if, in the course of agent-making, you decide to make them legitimately mentally ill, in a not-psychotic way - for example, bipolar, or schizophrenia, or multiple personality disorder, it would be greatly appreciated by myself, and moooost likely PPCers in general who may have mental illnesses, if you research said illness very carefully, <i>ask people who have it</i> if you have questions/concerns, and treat the character respectfully, rather than an excuse to make silly/zany jokes.<br><br>Also not because anyone specifically needed to be told, but it does come up every so often.</p>

            <p>And to highlight two of my own agents:<br><br>-Lou has said (very early on) that she was &#39;pentapolar&#39;, which is like bipolar only with, uh, more poles. My opinion is that this is actually a lie. Wait, did I say &#39;lie&#39;? I meant... no, I meant lie.<br><br>{It&#39;s not a lie if it makes for more interesting storytelling} Um, a) yes it is, and b) it didn&#39;t. {It&#39;s not a lie if <i>shut up</i>} ...<br><br>-Secondly, Kayleigh. Kayleigh has been consistantly described as ADHD, which was a somewhat misused label at one point in time (about eight years ago, when every child who misbehaved was immediately labelled ADHD. That seems to have worn off these days, thank the stars). She&#39;s also based heavily on a real person (of the &#39;I&#39;m ADHD and the pills make me boring so I don&#39;t take them&#39; variety), so I know she&#39;s accurate to at least <i>one</i> ADHD person...<br><br>Of course, she&#39;s <i>also</i> PPC-Crazy, and may be putting at least some of it on (I don&#39;t know; she won&#39;t tell me). Which of those three covers (for instance) constantly narrating her actions so Salamander (who&#39;s blind) can tell what she&#39;s doing? I haven&#39;t the faintest idea. At the end of the day, Kayleigh is Kayleigh - completely doolalley, and immensely fun to write.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The funny thing is, she just turned out that way (insane, that is). I wasn&#39;t bored, exactly...I think I just wanted her to quote everything, and it snowballed. And then I found out that she knew she was more or less fictional, and I got an explanation for at least part of her insanity. Quite fun.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Can agents not written by the same person have the same name?

The prominence of the agent<br>I can see how it would be odd to have two agents named, say, Acacia... but what about a slightly less prominent agent, like Mara? That&#39;s a common name anyway. <br><br>2. Whether the name was invented by the person who controls the agents<br>If so, would you then have to ask that person for permission to use the name?

The unusualness of the name<br>If it&#39;s an easily recognizable name, like Luxury, I can see how one might not want there to be two agents named that.

If it depends on other things, then what does it depend on?<br><br>These questions are pretty much hypothetical - I&#39;m just curious, since the FAQ doesn&#39;t seem to cover this.

            <p>I mean, there are a LOT of names out there, so honestly, I don&#39;t see why there needs to be a problem. You could always check a baby names dictionary. Or try to make the name meaningful. For example, the main character of my OFU is Nora Greyson. &quot;Nora&quot; easily extends to &quot;Eleanora&quot;, which is the name of her Sue. Grey is somewhere in between black and white, and Nora is somewhere in between badfic writer and goodfic writer as she learns more lessons at the academy.  <br>I think it also helps if you make agents who are not from World One. It&#39;s unlikely that you&#39;ll end up with two elves with the same name. Their names won&#39;t be Suvian, but they won&#39;t be common either.  </p>

            <p>They don&#39;t usually give the same name twice.

            <p>It&#39;s unclear whether there are one or two Glorfindels, and there were apparently two Legolases (?). One from Gondolin, and the poor ellon suffering from Orlando Bloomingitis.<br> By the way, what&#39;s up with Eledhwen&#39;s second name? &quot;Elerossiel&quot;... I recall reading somewhere that &quot;Elerosse&quot; would be the Quenya form of &quot;Elros&quot;, so that would make Elerossiel &quot;daughter of Elros&quot;, which makes absolutely no sense at all. It&#39;s probably my somewhat iffy knowledge of the Elven languages at fault here, though. Would you mind explaining?</p>

            <p>Okay, I&#39;ve finally had a chance to collate everything together, and I think we can start actually filming.<br><br>From the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=238624;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=50">previous thread</a> - that top post explains what I&#39;m talking about, and yes, there will be opportunities for people not on that thread to join in - I have five people who want to operate mostly as voice actors fro others (which is fine): World-Jumper, Cassie, Karen, Myrddyn and Rina. There are a wealth of quotes which need reading out, and several people who want to write something but not read it out (which, again, is fine). Anywhere I have a notation of &#39;???&#39; (in the Reader column) or &#39;[TEXT]&#39; (by a person&#39;s name), it would be astonishingly helpful if someone could volunteer to record the audio for that piece.<br><br>Equally, to anyone who is either already contributing or wants to, there are a handful of items with [VACANT] in their comments slot. Anyone who wants to volunteer for that slot (video, audio, or text contributions are welcome) should do so!<br><br>So without further ado (but with significant trepidation), the timeline, with parts assigned:<br><br><hr>

<br><br>[These final &#39;Everyone&#39; questions need reasonably short answers. Actually, what I mean is they <i>will</i> be short answers on the film. Feel free to ramble as long as you like - and I&#39;ll be rendering all the videos down to text for the supplemental materials, so that isn&#39;t a problem - but you&#39;ll probably get about five seconds actually on the film]<br><br>To anyone who wants to contribute their own words but can&#39;t find a [VACANT] to suit them - it&#39;s absolutely fine to just record your answers to the Who We Are questions. If you want to do so but are unwilling to appear on video, record audio. If you don&#39;t even want to do that, write it down, and we&#39;ll find you a voice.<br><br>All &#39;comment&#39; items are going to take one of two forms:<br><br>a) Preferably, you can just stand in front of a camera/microphone/bit of paper and talk a little (2-3 minutes I guess, but less is fine too) about the topic you&#39;re listed under.<br>b) If you prefer, you can treat it as an interview. Either you can write your own questions (preferred for simplicity&#39;s sake), or if needed, you can ask here and someone will give you some.<br><br>Obviously the flip-side of that is that if you see someone asking for questions, feel free to throw a couple at them! You don&#39;t have to answer every question you&#39;re asked, and it would be good if you could phrase your answers in a way that doesn&#39;t need the question to be spoken, but in general, it&#39;s wide open.<br><br>And, of course, remember: this is the PPC. We&#39;re allowed to be funny. ;)<br><br><hr>
<br><br><u><b>The Plan</b></u><br><br>In order to actually get this done (!!! I know, I know), we need a plan. So here it is:<br><br>1/ If you&#39;re on the list above, please reply to let me know you know what you&#39;re doing - or that I&#39;ve misunderstood and you don&#39;t want to do that. That includes both comments and readings.<br>2/ If you want to claim a [VACANT], [TEXT] or ???, also reply here, to let everyone know it&#39;s taken. [VACANT]s can be done as a [TEXT] if you wish, but please make it clear you&#39;re doing so, so that someone can come along and be your voice!<br>3/ If you wish to just answer the final four questions, please also reply here. That isn&#39;t a problem - the more the merrier! - but it&#39;s good to know who&#39;s contributing.<br>4/ My email should appear above. Please send your recordings or text to me within <b>one month from today</b>. This includes whatever comments or readings you&#39;ve signed up for, as well as your answers to the four Who We Are questions.<br>5/ If you are contributing text, it would be good if you could send it across earlier than a month, because...<br>6/ I will email text entries to the people who volunteered to voice them as and when I receive them. To facilitate this, it would be helpful for voice actors to email me straight away so I&#39;ve got your addresses.<br>7/ Your email should include your Board username (real names will <b>not</b> be used in the Documentary). This will make things easier, rather than me getting a dozen emails from <a href="mailto:ralph_agnostico@scramble.ez">ralph_agnostico@scramble.ez</a> saying &quot;Hi, this is Fredericia, I&#39;m ready to do my part!&quot;.<br>8/ ... well, 8 is the bit where I put everything together and try and make it work. Any further help I need at that point, I&#39;ll be asking for it then.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Any questions? Ask away!<br><br>(Some preemptive answers:<br><br>Yes, there will be music, and I&#39;ll be pulling it together on the fly.<br>Yes, there will be visuals, and I may need to ask for help with those.<br>Yes, I know how hard this will be. That&#39;s why I put this post off so long.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I was thinking a brief overview of OFUs and OFU writing, then a comparison with PPC writing. Good?<br><br>I&#39;ll answer the &quot;everyone questions&quot; here, if you don&#39;t mind. Feel free to edit for length.<br><br>1. How I found the PPC...that is a long story. It starts in late 2011 - no, earlier. Much earlier, when I first started to read fanfiction. I was browsing fanfiction on Deviant Art (a rather stupid idea, in hindsight), and came across a fic involving my favorite Star Trek character <s>and also Lust Object</s>, Lt. Commander Data. Unfortunately, said fic was plotless smut between Data and a female character I&#39;d never seen before, who had no character development whatsoever. Then and there I vowed to hate those sorts of characters for eternity. Later, I found a fanfiction called The Official Fanfiction University of the Federation - a one chapter beginning to a Star Trek: TNG OFU. It seemed to me to be a godsend, and I left a glowing review and waited for an update. It never came. <br>~skip a couple years~<br>My sister and I got Kindle Touchs, which have rudimentary Internet. Fanfiction is very comfortable to read on them, and she asked me for fic recs and I went to find the Official Fanfiction University of the Federation. In rereading it, I noticed a recommendation for OFUM in the author&#39;s note, and went to read it. I thought it was awesome, and went to find the second part. There was a crossover chapter with HFA in the second part, so I read HFA, which had references to the PPC. I found the Original Series on Miss Cam&#39;s website, and somehow found the wiki. From there, I found my way to the Board, and here I am.<br><br>2. I decided to stay because I&#39;d been lurking around the wiki, and I&#39;d gotten the impression that you guys were pretty awesome. I became aware of the PPC sense of humor, developed agents, found badfic to spork, etc., before posting on the Board. So posting on the Board was really just a way of alerting you to my membership. <br><br>3. Lots more newbies have joined, and a lot of them are Star Trek fans. And lookit! World-Jumper and DawnFire already have Permission! The newbies grow up so fast...<br><br>4. Jay and Acacia...hm. Just that I&#39;m grateful to them for starting this awesome community. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ll be putting things together in a combination of Audacity and, er, Windows Movie Maker, probably, unless I run into something better. In general, I can <i>probably</i> deal with most formats. The ones I&#39;ve historically had most trouble with have been Apple&#39;s formats - whatever it is that Quicktime uses, and I think m4a.

For video... I don&#39;t know. I tend to work in .wmv. My camera makes .avi, but those are massive, so I usually shrink them down in WMM. <i>Is</i> there a &#39;generic&#39; non-avi movie format?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>My original thought was that, for the start of the documentary, we&#39;d have the start of the very first PPC story. So by that logic, it&#39;d be the piece before they even go into the fic. In fact, I still think that&#39;s the best idea for that introduction.<br><br>But.

            <p>I should maybe contribute to this, seeing as I&#39;ve been around for a good deal of it. <sup>_<sup>;<br><br>I</sup></sup> AM the webmistress over at The Lost Tales, so I can give you something about that. There&#39;s not really much to say, though—GeoCities announced its death throes, there was a scramble to grab stuff, and a bunch of it ended up there, with more ending up on the PPC LJ and/or individual archival LJs (Calista did a bunch of this, IIRC) and/or your webplex. I actually found a lot of the material I ended up with was already on ff.net or hosted by Miss Cam, which was a bit frustrating after I&#39;d put the work in. Some of the unique items I&#39;ve got there actually went missing separately from non-GeoCities sites, like the original APD missions and Teena and Wyldehorse&#39;s spinoff. Odd Lots going down prompted more of the same, and I think you grabbed all or most of the stuff hosted there, right?<br><br>What other kinds of things do you want to know? I guess I could talk about re-hosting and editing TOS...?<br><br>I actually put together an <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/TV_Tropes">article about us and TV Tropes</a> on the wiki a while back, so if you don&#39;t mind me submitting that, I could cover that section, too.<br><br>I am unsure whether I want to, or even can, read aloud. I have a mic, but it hasn&#39;t been very reliable lately, and anyway I sound dumb in recordings.<br><br>Also, is anything more slated to go into the How We Write featurette, like how missions work, or Permission? Speaking of which, where does Jay and Acacia&#39;s departure and the first Permissions Givers fit in? What about the first elected rather than appointed PGs? What about the So Sue Me incident, which made us re-think the definition of &quot;Mary Sue&quot;?<br><br>... And shutting up now before that list of questions gets any longer.<br><br>I&#39;ll come back with some answers to the Everyone questions a bit later, or e-mail them to you.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m wildly amused by the fact that you followed &#39;there&#39;s not really much to say&#39; with a massive piece about what you had to do... I think the original entry for that item was &#39;The closure of GeoCities and launch of the Lost Tales&#39;, so it was the preservation/centralisation I was thinking of. Re-hosting TOS falls into the same broad category - a sort of &#39;We&#39;ve been here for most of a decade now, we can&#39;t just keep stuff on dead websites!&#39;.<br><br>For TVTropes - I certainly wouldn&#39;t mind you contributing. I&#39;m not sure the Wiki article quite works - it&#39;s a very fact-heavy piece, which I&#39;m not sure would work too well in spoken form. But if you think you can edit it...?<br><br>How We Write exists because two people suggested ideas that didn&#39;t fit into the formal timeline. Bearing your (good) suggestions in mind, I&#39;m thinking of the following tweaks:<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Aug-02 - Launch of OFUM - Myrddyn on OFUM - OFUM Chapter 1 - ???<br>Mar-03 - The Board relaunched<br>2003 - Jay and Acacia leave - [VACANT]<br><br>Featurette: How We Work<br>- How we deal with newbies - World-Jumper<br>- The Why Of Permission - Neshomeh? [TEXT]?<br>- What Is This Mission Thing Anyway? - Neshomeh? [TEXT]<br>- Writing OFUs and their effect on the PPC - hermione of vulcan [TEXT]<br>- How the PPC impacts young writers - DawnFire [TEXT]<br><br>2003 - The PPC Lounge - BeautyID<br>etc etc<br><br><hr>
<br><br>The Why... would be a piece about how, when J&amp;A left, they appointed Permission Givers, how we eventually turned it into an election, and (obviously) why we have them at all. What Is... would be a brief description of a mission, explaining what we actually write. It gives How We Work an internal structure (a sort of PPCer&#39;s Journey) which makes it slot nicely in.<br><br>As to So Sue Me... I wasn&#39;t particularly involved in that, and on the two previous occasions I&#39;ve begged people to add things to the timeline, no-one mentioned it. :P If you can hang a date on it, it&#39;d be great to slot it into the appropriate place as a &#39;We interact with people/let&#39;s make ourselves perfectly clear&#39; kind of thing. (I suppose &#39;re-think&#39; is accurate - we did a lot of thinking - but I don&#39;t think we <i>changed</i> our definition of a Mary-Sue)<br><br>(And, of course, you don&#39;t have to record anything - we can certainly find someone to read your stuff out!)<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: I grabbed /some/ of the OddLots stuff... not all, I don&#39;t think. ~hS</p>

            <p>(I seem to be racking those up lately.)<br><br>Anyway. It looks like the So Sue Me thing happened almost exactly three years ago; JulyFlame posted about it on the Board on April 13, 2010; Araeph posted a response to the PPC LJ on April 15; and I posted another response to the LJ on April 18. The Board discussion went on until about April 19-20, with some stragglers posting on the 23rd and 26th.<br><br>What happened during and in consequence of all that is fairly complicated. I&#39;ll try to sum it up as best I can, and e-mail it. I don&#39;t want to prompt a rehashing of the whole thing here, hence not posting any links to the stuff I mentioned. It was a pretty sucky time.<br><br>Since Guvnor has volunteered to take the TV Tropes section, I&#39;ll bow out. I was only peripherally involved—actually, I think it was KGarrett who got himself banned for &quot;whitewashing,&quot; if you want to get in touch with him.<br><br>Permission is easy enough, and so&#39;s missioning. I can provide explanations of those processes.<br><br>Be amused all you want, but that paragraph I already wrote about The Lost Tales is really almost all there is to say about it, as opposed to some of these other topics, which could be discussed for pages. Still, I&#39;ll try to flesh it out. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>First thing: I know I haven&#39;t been active lately. Computer Science is a significantly harder major than history, and that accounts for a lot of my absence. I have been reading the board, more or less, but I have not written anything, and I have not read any missions since last year. I really should catch back up after the semester is over.<br><br>Secondly: I have too many books! I recently discovered the awesometastic paperbackswap.com, but my books aren&#39;t moving fast enough. My profile, where all my books up for giveaway are listed, is <a href="http://guvnorium.paperbackswap.com/"><a href="http://guvnorium.paperbackswap.com/">http://guvnorium.paperbackswap.com/</a></a>.<br><br>So, I figure, maybe I should give away a few of these books to the only internet group I am affiliated with that is known for its reading appetite.<br><br>So here&#39;s the deal: if you happen to be a member of paperbackswap, and/or want to join, I would appreciate it if you requested books that way. I get a credit, good for one book, for every book I ship out. If you join, name me as your reference!<br><br>However, I really am doing this to get rid of books. If you have no desire to join, I&#39;m still willing to send you a book if you really want one. Publicly post the one you want here, and if I tell you it&#39;s available, hit me up with an email at guvnorofspace AT SYMBOL HERE gmail DOT/PERIOD/DELIMITER POINT com.<br><br>I will cover shipping and such. Please no more than two, and please only ask if you actually plan to read the book in question! <br><br><br>All of the above supposes anyone actually, you know, wants any of these. Some are crap (the 1999 &#39;blue book&#39; is utterly worthless, but when I started I needed ten books to get my two free starting credits), but I do have Redwall and the Lost World listed, if anyone here still has not read those.</p>

            <p>Your spin-off was pretty good in my opinion. You&#39;re right about the first few missions not working out as well as the rest, and there were multiple rough patches throughout, but I liked it as a whole, especially the SG-1 missions.<br><br>I think its strong point was the whole dynamic between Thomas and Orken. It&#39;s one thing to make characters friends, and another to make them work together but unable to get along, but with those two, both agents were doing what they could to get along with each other, even though they didn&#39;t know how the other thought, and sometimes could hardly stand each other.<br><br>That, and most of their missions are really fun to read. Even after I&#39;ve been looking through other people&#39;s spin-offs for a while now, I&#39;ve yet to find a Word World confused more often than yours, and it&#39;s always good to see minis that aren&#39;t reduced to just hanging around the RC not doing anything.<br><br><br>I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;d read most of the books you posted, but the Garth Nix one looked interesting. So, would I need to join the website to get the book, or would I just e-mail you information and you could send it to me?</p>

            <p>I tended to pick really broken fic. That helped. I&#39;ll also admit to a bit of fudging- I remember a sky being a &#39;dark brewing color&#39; and deciding that meant it was raining coffee. I did that for rule of funny, but still wonder if I didn&#39;t take things too far. <br><br>And I would prefer you join the site, if possible. That way I get credit for the trade. It is a bit of work, and it does require posting your own books to get start up credit. If you can&#39;t, or just don&#39;t want to, I&#39;ll send it to you anyway. If you choose that option, send me an email to the address listed in the opening post.</p>

            <p>And I can fix those. Give me quotes so I can find them easily, and they will be fixed. <br><br>Also: You can take books down... assuming no one had them on their wish list. If that is the case, you are forced to leave them up, in case someone wants them. I would strongly suggest you only put things up if you are willing to get rid of them. I also suggest you understand how it works before you do anything. Also: I&#39;m only 80% sure you can order directly from a person. If instead, you hit &#39;order book&#39; and the request goes to someone else, I&#39;ll know for the future, and, well, you get the book.</p>

            <p>...How would your Agents be different if they originated in a different fandom?<br><br>This was the result of me doodling Agent Christianne regenerating, and I thought that if she had been a Time Lady instead of a human, she&#39;d probably have even worse issues with outliving her partners (although if she was a Time Lady, she&#39;d probably be able to stick around as long as Eledhwen, which is pretty fortunate for the two of them). <br><br>Also if she ran around in a TARDIS instead of an RC, I imagine Eledhwen would go into conniptions trying to keep track of everything (not to mention the &#39;bigger on the inside&#39; issue).

            <p>What was the original conception, then? &#39;Cause in the beginning of the first DOGA mission (I think), he was already reading over Unfinished Tales with a red pen.

            <p>Acronyms are not my strong point, and when I put it into Google, it just spat out a bunch of businesses. Oh, Google, you aren&#39;t very helpful in cases that don&#39;t involve specific keywords.<br>It&#39;s like the modern version of that tired old &quot;But how can you look something up in the dictionary if you can&#39;t spell it?&quot; joke.<br><br><br>Any agent&#39;s going to seem Sueish when he&#39;s got years and years of Sue-loot serving as his weapons.

Since I don&#39;t know if the Myths of the PPC story was canon to anything else, that last point might not be valid.<br><br><br>Now <i>I&#39;m</i> interested in the Fandom Protection Fleet. I mean, I&#39;d been interested before, but then I just thought it was a throwaway gag. Now that it&#39;s apparently a possible inter-dimensional organization, I&#39;m getting brain-cogs going.<br>I&#39;m seeing them as sort of a science-fiction-and-fastasy-heavy version of the pre-Lofty Skies Protectors, but with different ideas for what warrants anomaly destruction. All of the consoles would be aspects of an HQ-wide AI, to encourage efficiency and to cut down on destruction of Fleet property.<br>They&#39;d probably have an absolutely insanely complex (and effective) Medical Department, too, what with owning or scavenging technology from Star Wars, Star Trek, Starfishers, Stargate, and basically every other continuum with &quot;Star&quot; in the title.<br><br><br>Ugh, no, stop, me. I don&#39;t even have Permission yet, and I&#39;m going on like this. Last time this happened, I was reprimanded for it. (slaps self) I&#39;ll keep the rest to myself now.</p>

(It&#39;s only now we figure out that the fic is TNG-verse - the summary said so, but nothing in the fic up until this point has indicated anything.) She is obviously the best, and gets to work with all the senior officers on a regular basis, especially Lt. Commander Data. Only…could she possibly be developing a crush on the android? Oh, why did she fall for a man with no emotions, her senior officer to boot! He could never love her! They manage to become friends, but that&#39;s just not enough! Meanwhile, the Enterprise has just been assigned to carry a group of scientists to a planet for some purpose (the particular scientific discipline or purpose is irrelevant), and Tanya is one of them. They reconnect, and Sue thinks that&#39;s great until Data starts working with the scientists (discipline still unspecified) - and Tanya confides that <i>she&#39;s</i> starting to have a crush on him too! To make matters worse, Data&#39;s spending less time with Sue and more time with the scientists. Sue breaks down and cries, because she&#39;ll never get him, even though she&#39;s so gorgeous and smart and perfect! (the wangst goes on much longer). Finally, she resolves to admit her feelings to Data. She bursts into the science lab and proclaims her love for Data in front of Tanya and a group of Generic Scientists. Data spontaneously develops emotions, and starts crying, saying that he loves her. She asks him why he was spending so much time with the (still unspecified) scientists, and he says it was purely work,  and that he missed her. Tanya looks griefstricken, and Data and Sue move as if to close the distance between them…except that the PPC steps in and reads off the charge list, culminating in the charge currently paralyzing Data - making an android emotional. Sue is killed, canon reverts to normal but for Tanya still standing in the middle of a science lab. The agents ask her if she wants to join the PPC, she asks what they do, and when they respond &quot;kill people like her&quot; and gesture to Sue&#39;s body, Tanya responds &quot;Oh hell yes!&quot;, and joins.<br><br>I don&#39;t know where her sister fits into this, though. So if she was recruited this way agent Joani wouldn&#39;t exist, unless perhaps Joani appeared in a Voyager era fic by the same author as the BFF of that Sue. They were recruited seperately, and due to timeline confusion on the part of the Suethor are three years apart in age.<br><br>That was fun.<br></p>

            <p>I love all the little details in this one, especially the &quot;nothing up to this point indicated the fic was in TNG&quot; bit.<br><br>When those Generics assimilated into the canon, assuming alt-Tanya&#39;s rescuers didn&#39;t kill them in a burst of frustration, they&#39;d make excellent Starfleet Science Officers.

            <p>Well, let&#39;s see, the RC 8888 duo in the Nanoha-verse.<br><br>Narav: Probably comes from a family very much focused on going into the TSAB. However, he&#39;s got a good eye for magical physics, so he heads into spell and Device development. Eventually he gets assigned to tech-support for a front-lines unit of some kind, an Enforcers unit on a violent world perhaps. So even though he&#39;s technically not front-line personnel he still has to deal with the criminals roving around, so he gets pretty good at combat, and learns how to use basic Belkan style magic. Eventually, he gets sent to another unit when the area is mostly pacified, and in-between assignments he meets a PPC recruiter. <br><br>Lana: Grew up in a small family on an Unadministered World where the custom is for mages to serve the local warlord. Lana had a talent for support magic - specifically binds, teleports, and illusions, so she got trained to be a spy and bodyguard for the Device Meister manufacturing some of the weapons. Obviously, she didn&#39;t like it, and when an experimental Dimensional Transport machine broke she got thrown into the PPC Headquarters.<br></p>

            <p>Let&#39;s say I took Caleb the Twilight vampire...<br><br>...And made him a Rainbow Drinker instead. So Caleb Cooper the vampire would be... Cayleb Cooper the Alternian troll, I guess. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s possible, if male jadebloods are a thing. I&#39;m not completely sure. Anyway, he&#39;d glow in the dark, which is infinitely preferable to sparkling in the sun, and he&#39;d spend his days tending to the Mother Grub. Pretty boring existence, all in all, but it may very well be the safest on Alternia, all things considered. Of course, if I don&#39;t take his vampirism into account, he would probably be a blueblood instead, and I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s capable enough to survive in a violent environment like Alternia.<br>I think if Jack were transplanted with him he&#39;d end up being his spazzy green-or-brownblood moirail.<br><br>But let me do something different with Jack. Let&#39;s put him in... Adventure Time. Without Caleb to keep him from attacking people, he&#39;d probably end up being a quirky recurring minor villain that Finn and Jake have to beat back every now and then. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s evil enough for Finn to actually kill.<br><br>Now for Kestrel. I think I&#39;ll have to stick her on Alternia, too. And... <i>Kestra</i> would probably be higher on the spectrum, maybe somewhere around cerulean, I don&#39;t really see her as a seadweller. She&#39;d be right at home on Alternia, frankly. She&#39;s always right at home in violent environments. Now, the real challenge would be sticking her in Equestria. She&#39;d probably be a pegasus pony, either a trick flier or a member of the Royal Guard. If she were the former, she&#39;d be too reckless to cut it as a Wonderbolt, and if the latter is the case, she&#39;d probably get written up a lot for insubordination. Either way, she would never quite fit in.<br><br>Let&#39;s put Adder in Doctor Who. She&#39;d probably be stubborn and competent enough to make it as a passing, temporary companion, one of those once-an-episode minor characters that gets involved in the Doctor&#39;s shenanigans. She&#39;s definitely an Action Survivor, so she&#39;d actually have a decent chance of making it out alive.<br><br>I&#39;ll end this by sticking Deuce in Fairy Tail. Fire wizard, all the way. Depending on how similar his backstory would be to his &quot;canon&quot; one, he&#39;d probably start off as a villain, actually, maybe a member of a dark guild. Of course, Deuce has this thing where he subconsciously keeps a death-grip on his goodness, and since defeat often leads to friendship in Fairy Tail, his villain status wouldn&#39;t last very long.<br><br>I dunno, it kind of feels weird separating Adder and Deuce.</p>

            <p>...in the <i>Nanoha</i>-verse.<br><br>All right, let&#39;s see here. Male, currently 19, has magical potential. Likes order and being a part of a larger group, so he enlists in the Time-Space Administration Bureau as soon as he is eligible to do so. University-educated, creative thinker. He&#39;s always been thinner and weaker than most, so he&#39;s not combat material. He&#39;s not a very impressive mage either: overall rank of &quot;D&quot; with a specialization in support spells. Ground Forces don&#39;t want him, not powerful enough to join the Dimensional Navy, so he&#39;s assigned to the Rescue Corps. <br><br>Dutiful worker, obsessive-compulsive need for orders. Above average leadership skills, but not the most inspirational boss ever: natural cowardice meshes poorly with the risks that need to be taken for SAR ops. Re-relocated to the Wildlife Preservation Corps after a while. <br><br>Stuck in the middle of nowhere as a magic gamekeeper agrees with his more passive and quieter side, but he still dreams of becoming a soldier or maybe even a full-blown Enforcer.<br><br>When he encounters an off-duty PPC agent visiting Mid-Childa, he gladly signs up to fix the multiverse in search of glory and recognition. <br><br>In conclusion, we&#39;d have a more restless, inquisitive man than the one currently sipping his tea in RC 22 right now. He&#39;d be a lot more proactive, questioning orders, and finding new ways to do things. AU!Gasaprd would also be slightly, wanting certain things to be done by his partners/squadmates or by use of magic. <br></p>

            <p>Well, that is an interesting idea. The Wildlife Preservation Corps need more love in Nanoha - they stop poachers with dragons. Also considering some of the monster the Wolks use for mana you&#39;d probably end up dealing with things on the monster-y end of the scale at some point...</p>

            <p>What would my agents be like if they were from another continuum? Well, poor Marvin would have never heard of MLP:FiM, thus completely changing his motivation for being in the devision he is in. Great, now I am imagining Marvin as a wizard from the Discworld. I wonder...<br><br>While all his peers were busy reading star formations, summoning Death, and shoving their heads in mercury clouds, Marvin dared to wonder about a diferent kind of magic: the magic of friendship. Unfortunately, the Archmage was not Celestia, but a man who thought Marvin&#39;s fascination with human emotion was bolth absurd and complete hogwash. Marvin was alone in his observations of mortal resilience and strength in tight numbers, and while he was able to <s>stalk</s> watch others forge friendships through fire (and loose other freinds in the same blaze) he could not bring himself to make any friends himself. That is, untill his experiment with quicksilver, sunflower seeds, and a pony heart somehow managed to rip a hole in the fabric of reality. <br><br>While on almost any other world this would be cause for considerable alarm, dimensional tears on the Disc were a fairly common occurrence, especially in the Unseen University. This hole was different from the usual kind, which lead to a vast, barren land full of freezing cold sand and unimaginable horrors that were all too easy to imagine. No, this one seemed to lead into a genericaly grey hallway, with light fixtures hanging on the ceiling. Marvin would have taken more time to ponder the architecture, if he did not find himself sucked into the portal, and on the other side. Now all he could think about is, &quot;Oh bugger. Now what?&quot;<br><br>Meanwhile, in the laboratory Marvin was very rudely taken from, a tall dark figure stood, leaning against his scythe and watching the hole the wizard was pulled into shrink and disapear with a small &#39;Pop.&#39; The figure sighed and shook his head, as he pulled out a small hourglass, which had suddenly desided to stop. I HATE PLOTHOLES.<br><br>...Thanks Lily, now I have Marvin the Wizard stuck in my head. Fantastic.</p>

            <p>Well, Marvin the Wizard would be much less shy, but much more socially awkward. He would see the world as one massive opportunity to study friendship, and upon introduction to MLP:FiM, would use the friendship reports as scientific reports on how frendship works, and attempt to use them as guidelines to live by. Unfortunately, it will translate to everyone else as being very creepy. You see, he would have studied friendship from afar, and while he would know how it should work, it would be very hard for him to put it into practice.<br><br>As a wizard from the Disc, while being more open and considerate to non-wizards then most of his peers, he would still be a bit of an elitist, and feel that magic users were ever so slightly better then everyone else. He would be a unicorn evry time he enters a new badfic. If he has to go to Cloudsdale, he casts the cloud-walking spell on himself.<br><br>And now, a random moment in Marvin the Wizard&#39;s non-adventures.<br><br>Printworthy stared at his partner in shock. &quot;Have you lost your mind!? That&#39;s suicidal, there is no way it could work!&quot;<br><br>Marvin laughed, preparing to charge headlong into almost absolute death for anypony else. &quot;There is something you should know about Disc wizards, Printworthy. We have to be claimed by Death himself when we die, and last I checked, Death isn&#39;t in Equestria! I <i>can&#39;t</i> die!&quot;<br><br>ARE YOU SHURE ABOUT THAT?<br><br>Marvin froze, his pupils as small as pinheads, and his mane stuck upright. He slowly turned, dreading what he would see. Standing before him was a tall, bone white pony, with a platinum blonde mane. The pony wore a black cloak over his head, his eyes shining out from underneeth. That is, if you could call them eyes. Rather, where the pony&#39;s eyes should have been were two dark sockets, with two bright blue sparks for the actual eyes. Marvin glanced towards the pony&#39;s flank and saw a black hourglass cutiemark, the sand all emptied to the bottom, and a scythe lieing across the front.Were it not for the eyes and cutie mark, Marvin would have sworn he was looking at Death&#39;s dreaded mount, Blinky. But this pony was not Blinky. It was... It was...<br><br>I AM DEATH OF PONIES.<br><br>Marvin fainted on the spot.</p>

            <p>Well, seeing as Good Omens is written by Terry Pratchett as well, it makes sense the continuum would be similar. Death is my absolute favorite Discworld character, so creating Death of Ponies was great fun for me. Actually, Death of Ponies was not there to collect wizard!Marvin just yet, but rather sompony else nearby, but since he overheard the wizard being cocky, he felt like messing with the agent a little. Prinworthy would be unable to see Death of Ponies, like most humans cannot see Death, so to him, Marvin passed out for absolutely no reason. Hilarity ensues.<br><br>...Great, now Death of Ponies is going to appear in one of the missions, somehow. I don&#39;t know how at the moment, but I&#39;ll figure it out. And I&#39;m going to have to write out wizard!Marvin a bit more because of this. As a side note, all of my characters are free-use, as I don&#39;t hold much value to &#39;intellectual property,&#39; so feel free to use any of the characters if you so wish without fear of me hunting you down demanding permission before use. All I ask is a little credit and that the piece is not crap. </p>

            <p>Do you want us to just... pick one? Or is there one continuum specifically that you want us to pick and try to work with?<br><br>Since you said Doctor Who, I imagined both of my agents-to-be as Time Lords. I immediately envisioned a scene where a Dalek got into their TARDIS while they were charging it. One agent had been busy messing with the central computer, and turned around just in time to see his partner run around behind the intruder and jump on its rear side.<br><br>The following dialogue ensued.<br><br>C: &quot;Get down off of there!&quot;<br>L: &quot;No way! This is kick-ass!&quot;<br>C: &quot;It&#39;s going to... to hurt you!&quot;<br>L: &quot;It can&#39;t! Its gun and little plunger thing are on the other side!&quot;<br>D: &quot;<b>EX-TER-MIN-ATE!!!</b>&quot; (Dalek spins around, blasting from its gunstick wildly)<br>L: &quot;Stop spinning around! Go forward! Out the door! I&#39;m the Dalek Rider, I say where we go!&quot;<br>C: &quot;Did you just quote the Eragon movie? Of all the things to say in a crisis...&quot;<br>L: &quot;Nick, I say some things because I&#39;m joking about them. I say other things because I didn&#39;t have the time to think of anything better. This... (Dalek smacks into the wall in an effort to dislodge its passenger) Oof. This is both cases.&quot;<br>(Dalek spins faster)<br>D: &quot;<b>EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!</b>&quot; (fires wildly at TARDIS ceiling)<br>L: &quot;So this is what it feels like to be nauseous. Can&#39;t say I recommend it.&quot;<br>C: Oh, for cog&#39;s sake!<br>(Copernicus knocks the Dalek over)<br>&quot;<b>Ex-Ter-Min...ate.</b>&quot; (Dalek shifts back and forth, trying and failing to right itself)<br>C: &quot;Look at him. He&#39;s like a turtle that&#39;s been tipped onto its back. I almost feel sorry for him. I probably would, if he hadn&#39;t broken in, smacked into the walls, and scratched the new paint.<br>L: (stands up, brushing dirt off his coat) &quot;Plus, I think it was trying to kill us.&quot;<br>C: &quot;Really? I&#39;m going to need to buy a new lock for the ship.&quot;<br>L: &quot;Let&#39;s sonic the top open before it gets itself back up. I want to see what button the squid-blob pilot pushes to make the gun work.&quot;<br><br>These two are going to be fun to write.<br>Also, that is possibly the multiverse&#39;s most easily toppled Dalek, but that&#39;s neither here nor there.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got a couple of Agents coming together in my head, so I&#39;ll just try this....but Disclaimer: Don&#39;t have permission yet, and it will probably be a while before I even ask. <br><br>P.S: Still refining the characters. If you see anything that looks weird in here, it&#39;s probably going to get changed at some point. <br><br>Solstice or &quot;Sol&quot;: Alright, let&#39;s say she was from the Charmed verse. A witch. Hmm.......<br><br>I&#39;d imagine she&#39;d be more outgoing and touch-happy. Sol now is really drawn inward, guarded and quiet. I&#39;m giving her premonition as a Charmed power, so her power would be focused through her hands. So to gain information, she&#39;d likely be just a bit more &#39;out there&#39;. Especially since she&#39;d be in a family where it made sense, rather than with a family that Sol was vastly different from. Maybe she&#39;d be more positive, to. Solstice is really quite the downer. <br><br>And then, I think, she&#39;d be a bit less hard. Sol usually has quite a bit of quiet emotional strength. I don&#39;t think that the other Sol would have less, but since I doubt she&#39;d be allowed to fight demons until she was older.....maybe?<br><br>Cass: Hello, sweet, sarcastic little friend. Let&#39;s place you in Sol&#39;s home universe. <br><br>Hmm......I actually don&#39;t think Cass would end up that different. That&#39;s partially my fault, I guess. I placed her into similar circumstances. <br><br>The biggest difference would be her eyes. Cass relies a lot on what she sees- she hates being blinded. She can see like a hawk and any little moving tic on a body language. She notices everything (Well, not everything, she isn&#39;t perfect...ahem, you get my point). But if she were in Sol&#39;s home universe (Missing-verse) then she would have to rely less on what she sees and trust more in things she doesn&#39;t see to do her job. <br><br>And I suppose that she wouldn&#39;t be so protective. She&#39;s like the parent of a wounded chimp sometimes. With only her being transferred, she&#39;d be more out for herself, I guess. <br><br>Wow, that was a good exercise for them. Really made me think. Interesting....very interesting....<br></p>

            <p>Sure, why not. <br><br>Hmm. Karen-the-Agent and Lanyon from other continua. <br><br>Well, Lanyon&#39;s from an original story of mine, and Karen-the-Agent went through your IAHF and seems to have been later incorporated into a friend&#39;s story...so...<br><br>Lanyon. Let&#39;s say he&#39;s from a sci-fi continuum, instead of a steampunk one. He&#39;d certainly be a lot better with technology of the PPC variety, since as he is now, anything that doesn&#39;t run on steam confuses him. He&#39;d also be a lot more open-minded and accepting of others. Possibly he&#39;d have more patience with Karen-the-Agent.<br><br>And Karen-the-Agent...well. As my self-insert character, it&#39;s hard to imagine her otherwise, but...for the sake of the question...let&#39;s say she was born as a troll on Alternia. Yeah. She&#39;d have been an indigo-blood (what I keep getting on tests) that was never very good at being a blueblood, and always felt like something was wrong with her  because of that. Karen-the-Troll (Karren? Let&#39;s go with Karren) and Karen-the-Agent are both equally violent, which is more than most humans have but less than an indigoblood. Karren&#39;s internalized the caste system and looks down on below her caste, but can relate better to them than her fellow bluebloods, and all-around tends to have trouble making friends. Karren would be a Maid of Void if she ever played Homestuck.<br><br>Crap, now I think that when I get my Permission I&#39;ll have to do a Homestuck mission so I can turn Karen and Lanyon into trolls.</p>

            <p>I could have them both be from the Girl Genius &#39;verse. It&#39;s a steampunk webcomic of amazingness, and I think it&#39;d be very well suited to my agents because...<br><br>Lanyon would be a Spark, which is basically a mad genius. He&#39;s quite good with steam-powered tech already, and would be perfect as a Spark. His specialty would be clanks, large ones with lots of weaponry. As a Spark, he&#39;d also be from a high-class family, which perfectly suits his aristocratic nature. He&#39;d have a megalomaniacal drive to conquer the world, which would make him much more confrontational and violent, instead of a seething mass of pent-up frustration.<br><br>Karen in Girl Genius would be a Jaegermonster, with claws, huge sharp teeth, an aversion to bathing, and a love for fighting. Her impulse control would be the same (read: nonexistent), but markedly more violent, and she&#39;d be stronger to boot. Her hair and skin would also be some odd color, as a result of the change, likely clashing. She&#39;d also have a strong sense of loyalty to the Heterodyne family, and would only work for the PPC if they allowed it. Alternatively, she fell through a plothole while looking for a Heterodyne and decided to stay on at the PPC so she could search for a Heterodyne in the word worlds, speculating that a lost heir might have fallen through a plothole at some point in the past. Hmm, I like the second one better. Oh, and she&#39;d have a phonetic accent, &quot;Like dis, und it might be because ov zee beeg teeth, or chust a Slavic aksent, seence Mechanicsburg ees located in Transylvania.&quot;<br><br>As a team, Spark!Lanyon and Jaeger!Karen would be quite at odds. Lanyon would see himself as the leader of the team, and take insubordination very badly, while Karen feels only beholden to the Heterodynes and will not serve another master. Expect bickering, casual maiming (fortunately Jaegers are durable, and as a Spark Lanyon can fix himself up), and lots of explosions.</p>

            <p>It&#39;ll most likely be a while before I get Permission, but I&#39;ve been messing around with possible agents, so here goes with my favorite two.<br><br>First, Luya de Rousseau. Luya&#39;s from an original short story of mine set in future Earth; she headed up a genetic research department for a secret society. She&#39;s legally insane, domineering, incredibly annoying, and a complete savant. She&#39;s also a serious perfectionist and appears to have a form of schizophrenia. <br><br>Let&#39;s say she&#39;s from....Ankh-Morpork. Hmm. I actually don&#39;t think that would change her very much due to the nature of the city. She&#39;d probably work for the City Watch, since she&#39;s good with forensics. Not only would she enjoy her work, she&#39;d make her way up through the ranks fast, either by impressing her superiors or stabbing other people in the back. She&#39;d be a human, and everyone else would be under the impression that there was something severely wrong with her. As a child, she wouldn&#39;t have understood that, but as a teenager and adult, it made her cold and distant. <br><br>Her partner, Samkim Upton, is from an old Game of Thrones fic of mine set about twenty or twenty-five years into the future of Westeros. He was Arya Stark&#39;s son. I think. Yes, I know it&#39;s rather ridiculous. In his revised form, he&#39;s severely paranoid, has OCD, and has a phobia of Furbies. He&#39;s also quite good with technology and has an apparently eidetic memory. He&#39;s proud and resents anyone insulting his intelligence.<br><br>Let&#39;s put him in the Pern-verse, shall we? Well. He&#39;d most likely specialize in one of the crafthalls, since he&#39;s good with technology. He&#39;d also be more open-minded to supernatural happenings, since Pern has the dragons and fire-lizards and all, and he&#39;d have grown up with them. Most likely, he&#39;d be less sarcastic and biting, and be quieter and more patient due to all his work. He&#39;d definitely be less proud as he&#39;d have a sense that he was a less important member of the community.<br><br>Hmm. This really made me think about these two... now I really want to get Permission so I can start writing their missions. Their respective disorders should make for a very interesting relationship.<br><br><br></p>

            <p>Ello there Kitt! Man, It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve said hello to a newbie. Too long. Because of this lack of greatings on my part, I shall compensate with two gifts! Have a bleep-blap bar, the bleepolate version of Kit-Kat bars! I don&#39;t know why, but I have a feeling you&#39;ll enjoy them. <br><br>Now, for gift two... *GUAAAAH!* You like ponies too?  Yay, another brony in the ppc!<br>(as if we don&#39;t already have a whole herd in here...)<br>Here, your second gift is a crystal statue of your favorate character from FiM, with an aspect of their personality enchanted onto it. Just be careful, demon shadow ponies may try to make it their slave.<br><br>Welcome to the PPC!</p>

I&#39;m Pauline....I&#39;m a rather passionate Harry Potter lover (which is, unfortunately, the only fandom we share). <br>.....I&#39;ve been giving this out lately, but recently I&#39;ve been making this bleepolate ice cream with extra chocolate- you like chocolate?- perfect for all of your badfic brain scrubbing needs (homemade, by the way).

            <p><b>Generic Surface</b><br><i>The Doctor and Clara fall through a plothole into HQ.</i><br><br>It was midnight when she heard it tickling at the corners of her dreams.<br><br>Clara Oswald’s eyes flew open as the noise grew louder and louder – that familiar grinding noise that meant adventure was close behind – and she sat up in bed, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. She strode over to the window and opened it, peering out to see her darkened street –<br><br>–And a familiar man in a waistcoat and bowtie waving at her from her driveway.<br><br>“I don’t recall an arrangement to pick me up at midnight,” Clara remarked once she opened the front door to reveal the Doctor on her doorstep, grinning from ear to ear like the overgrown boy she knew he was (didn’t make him any less awesome or endearing, of course). <br><br>The Doctor laughed at her. “Why not midnight? It’s the witching hour, after all. Anything’s possible at midnight! It’s one of my favourite times of the day – well, night – right up there with three o’ clock on Friday afternoons!”<br><br>“What’s so special about three o’clock in the afternoon?” wondered Clara as the Doctor skipped back to the TARDIS and opened the door for her. <br><br>“Jammie Dodger time, of course,” replied the Time Lord, beaming. “Now come along, we’ve got some things to do – people to see, worlds to save, children to not-walk-away from!”  Clara laughed at that; the Doctor grinned at her, before pulling the lever. “Geronimo!”<br><br><del><br><br>“So, where are we going?” asked Clara, smiling as the Doctor walked around his console, pulling levers and pushing buttons. The Time Lord did a little twirl, before grinning at her again. “And what’s with the grin? You’re like the Cheshire cat, you are, grinning every time you do something clever.”<br><br>“I do clever things all the time.”<br><br>“Therefore you never stop grinning, therefore you’ve got a face like the Cheshire cat – can you turn invisible, too?”<br><br>“Oh, I wish! That’d be rather handy in a tight spot. Hm, I should look into stealing an Invisibility Cloak or something. Anyway, off we go – we’re just popping next door to Monoceros, to the Snowflake Cluster! I’ve timed it just right so that we can see the breaking of the cluster right from the comfort of the TARDIS –<br><br>The TARDIS jolted. The Doctor rushed back to the scanner and the controls, frowning at the screen. “What was that?” demanded Clara. The Doctor paid her no heed as he fiddled with the central computer again. <br><br>“No, no, go right, I said, turn right!” muttered the Time Lord. <br><br>“What’s right?” repeated Clara. “No, wait, scratch that, what’s left?”<br><br>The Doctor looked up at her. “A stretch of spatial-temporal distortion. A rip in the fabric of reality. A volatile gap in the Time Vortex that, last time I came here, was definitely not there.” He paused. “We’re being sucked into a plot hole,” he said rather blithely, before the TARDIS lurched violently again, and the lights went out. <br><br></del><br><br>Notes: I&#39;m assuming this plays into the roleplay that&#39;s happening with the Weeping Angels already in HQ? I dunno.<br></p>

            <p>Amy didn&#39;t realise that she shouldn&#39;t look into an Angel&#39;s eyes either, so the Agent would suffer the same problems.

            <p>Is this considered PPC canon (as far as that word goes here) as some sort of interlude, or is it just going to be crossover shenanigans that don&#39;t really tie into anything? Because if it&#39;s the former, I&#39;m adding your appearance and personality data for Rosalie to her wiki page. She has one sentence for her entire history. That&#39;s a problem. She&#39;s not even in the Glossary.<br>It sounded like she had some sort of feud with Eledhwen. Does she? If so, what caused it?

I particularly liked the Doctor&#39;s reaction to the Creeper exploding.<br><br>But where did the Weeping Angel reflection come from? The portal closed before it got into the room, and unless another Weeping Angel was already at their destination, there would have been nothing to reflect.<br>Since the only Hallway of Mirrors Uncle Google would show me is in World One France, it&#39;s not very likely that there&#39;d be a Weeping Angel there already. I may have been overlooking a location from a canon I don&#39;t know well, though.</p>

            <p>One was in the rickety house. The other is in this hallway. I came up with it after my friend wondered why the DW writers never bothered putting an an Angel in a mirrored room, so either the plothole for that hallway is malfunctioning or it was built like that to disorient Agents in that segment of HQ.<br><br>I&#39;m not entirely sure if the blackout is meant to be part of canon, but even so, I would think Eledhwen wouldn&#39;t get along with Rosalie because of the Suethor tendency to stick Naiads into Middle-earth, her home continuum.</p>

            <p>That explains it. I thought the &quot;random&quot; setting always just picked a spot from within one of the Protected continua.<br>But where did the third Angel go? Simple. Wherever the Doctor&#39;s going to go next.<br><br>If the reflections all turned into Weeping Angels, what happens with reflections that overlap? When a room is full of mirrors, there are going to be reflections, a reflection of those reflections, and reflections of that reflection on top of, but not completely obscured by, yet another reflection.<br><br>Would a partial reflection join with another reflection-fragment and spawn a multi-headed Angel? Would the Angel reproductive process cut its losses and just make a small Angel? Is that even how this works?<br><br>If enough people set stories to refer to the blackout, it&#39;ll probably become canon by default, or at least canon by osmosis. So far, there&#39;s one story and a roleplay. Wait, two roleplays. We should spread the word and get more people to make blackout stories.<br>I was going to write one myself, but it would have involved creating new characters and filling out the personality of one of the Flowers, and I can&#39;t do either of those without Permission. That can&#39;t stop me from commenting, though!</p>

            <p>I think the Doctor was just extremely lucky with the portal generator. Who knows where the random setting would&#39;ve taken them.<br>I&#39;m seriously actually just making this up as I go along, so who knows where the third one is lurking. And I do believe there are other beasties hiding in the shadows, too...<br><br>That&#39;s a good question, but I&#39;m just saying that they&#39;re all separate Angels for the sake of creepiness. As far as I&#39;m going with this story, the Angels use the mirrored room to be able to attack even more effectively, since there&#39;d be absolutely nowhere to turn to (that isn&#39;t Angel-free).</p>

            <p>Now I find myself eagerly awaiting more, and I see I am not alone in that.<br><br>One thing that I have been wondering for a while, though, is what would happen if a Weeping Angel met something very good at staring (either also from the Whoniverse e.g. Cybermen/Daleks, or something from another continuum)? Would it simply be a matter of no blinking winning the day with ease, or would the tech count as a recording device and make the observer become another Angel? Also, does somebody who becomes an Angel retain their personality, or do they go crazy with hunger? (I must admit that I am guilty of not having seen the episode where the Angels convert people.)<br><br>Also, a DnD-verse Beholder vs a Weeping Angel would be fun...</p>

            <p>I wonder what the hell would happen if it met the Vashta Nerada. <br>And generally you become an Angel if you look into its eyes because it makes a mental image of the Angel which (after an incubation period) breaks out and kills you. So I assume recording devices in things like Daleks and Cybermen would do the very same.<br><br>During the incubation period people hallucinate that they&#39;ve been turned to stone, and count down to the moment of their death. They&#39;re controlled by the Angel in their mind. And afterwards, the creature that escapes them is a full-blown Angel and would probably have no traces of the former person in them.<br><br>(It&#39;s all found in the Doctor Who wiki, which is extremely thorough imo.) </p>

            <p>Honestly, this is one of the most awsome things I have ever seen, ever. You have the Doctor&#39;s personality absolutely spot-on, I could see Matt Smith saying those lines in an actual episode.<br><br>I really hope the Doctor gets to see at least one of the other Time Lords before being neralized, just so he has that moment where he can finaly stop feeling so bloody guilty and alone. I see it acting out kinda like the Van Gogh moment in the show, when the Doctor shows Vincent how important his art was in the future: a big teary moment with a confused man just trying to do his job being huged and cried on, that unfortunately amounts to nothing in the scheme of things. Still, this is your story to take wherever you wish, and I will patiently wait for the next part.</p>

She was in <a href="http://tawaki-ppc.livejournal.com/7565.html">one of those stories circa 2008</a> that loved introducing new characters and never bringing them up again. She called herself The Disentangler, because she worked in DIC, and I assume also because the author was out of original nicknames.<br><br>There was another one briefly mentioned in that same story who called himself The Agent, probably for the same authorial reason.

            <p>I only brought up those two as a reminder about another few Time Lords in the PPC in case none of the other writers of Time Lord agents said yes to her using theirs, or she wanted to reference/write a scene about an event that would involve multiple PPC Time Lords at once.

She could always have changed it, I suppose. I don&#39;t remember any Time Lords canonically doing that, but she could always just have been a badfic rescue that didn&#39;t have a title before.

            <p>Will you be writing a Part 2?<br><br>Also, will this story take place during the Blackout, when the failure of HQ&#39;s shields let the angels in, or shortly afterward, when the shields would be back up?<br>Or will the Doctor be running into the Weeds while they&#39;re trying to set the shields back up?

            <p>According to the Reorganization story, Flowers perceive their surroundings through a combination of light patterns caused by motion and perception of surface thoughts. They&#39;d be able to know that the Angels were there, if only from the telepathic aspect, which would still activate the quantum-lock.<br><br>Of course, this raises the question of what happens to the Angels when observed by a Flower. They wouldn&#39;t be able to move regardless, but I remember something being said about them not looking like angels when they&#39;re able to move around. Since the Flowers don&#39;t &quot;see&quot; per se, would the Angels still turn into their sharp-toothed winged humanoid form when quantum-locked by Weeds? I think it&#39;s an interesting question.<br><br>Well, the shields were down during the Blackout, so HQ might have just started slowly coming apart, creating an increase in plot holes. Since the holes get bigger and nastier when the null zone is broached, I&#39;m pretty certain that&#39;s what led to HQ being tangled up with the other worlds in the roleplay. HQ&#39;s undefined nature would allow other worlds to imprint on it, and in turn, allow temporary interdimensional transit. In turn, the Creepers and Angels could just come in through the cracks.<br><br>Of course, since SeaTurtle started the roleplay&#39;s element of dimension juncture, he&#39;s got the defining say on why all the Creepers and whatnot showed up, so this is just a theory for now, and one without much precedent at that. Still, I think it sounds pretty plausible, given HQ&#39;s nature.</p>

            <p>As you, Steve? (yes, the question mark is part of the name),  move about the world, the game loads and unloads &quot;chunks&quot; of land around you so that your map seems infinite. The chunk is a 16X16X256 piece of land with various things running though its length and depth. <br><br>To spawn a monster (a &quot;mobile entity&quot; or &quot;mob&quot; as it were) the game checks to see how much light surrounds the player. To spawn a hostile mob, the game needs an empty space with a light level of 7 or less. This usually is found in the underground areas of the chunk Steve? is in. This is why Minecraft players light up important areas like a Christmas tree: it&#39;s to prevent hostile mobs from spawning around them.<br><br>In this case, the section of HQ in question was built in a Minecraft cave. When everything went dark, the world&#39;s rules still applied and Gaspard got mobbed (heh heh) by a Creeper and a huge spider that spawned nearby.

            <p>...is unravelling because the shields that (for the purposes of narrative simplicity) keep plotholes within HQ stabilised as well as keep nasties out were lowered during the blackout. That particular juncture which was in the Minecraft cave happened to spawn Creepers, while the Angels entered through a destabilised plothole (another destabilised plothole brought in the Doctor). <br><br>Therefore for my fic the Doctor has to somehow get power back to HQ as well as remove the Angels before they send Agents back in time. However, I doubt the RAs would be functioning properly if the shields that helped stabilise the plotholes are down, since RAs harness plotholes for travel. I guess the best way to get things done, then, is to just run.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s not try to pin all things down with a single, solid, definite explanation? HQ also runs on the Narrative Laws of Comedy, etc. So I think it&#39;d be safe to say that messing around with portal technology of pretty much any kind is going to have unforeseen side effects. (And I say this, I should note, for at least partially selfish reasons, since Minecraft teleporting is sorta <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1itVatu_D7U4DvmvYsg4kQCe9VikatLpAVsCvJLq0T1w/edit?usp=sharing">the backstory</a> for one of my agents.)</p>

            <p>What I saw in &quot;Jof&#39;s Origin&quot; was: Cafeteria Workers portal into the future and unwisely leave their portal generator on, Cafeteria Workers invoke Ironic Overpower, portal opens to Minecraft-verse, Enderman comes through, Enderman makes eye contact, Enderman chases Cafeteria Workers down the halls, Cafeteria Workers meet Cadmar, Cadmar talks about pumpkins, Cadmar eats a sandwich, Cafeteria Workers acquire pumpkins, Cafeteria Workers wear pumpkins on heads, and Cafeteria Workers say that Enderman is cute and presumably recruit him.<br><br>There&#39;s not really anything in there anyone could dispute. Equipment malfunctions, meta-explanations, cameo appearances, and odd recruitment scenarios are all factors the PPC practically runs on. Coupled with that, when something falls through a plot hole, all bets are off as to whether it would actually belong wherever it was sent, and Endermen don&#39;t really belong anywhere.<br>Poor little guys. Even on the floating white islands of their home dimension, all they do is wander around and stare at each other. It&#39;s no wonder Jof decided to stay with the PPC, even if he does have to distribute the Cafeteria&#39;s notorious pseudo-food.<br><br>Now that I think about it, I may be just misinterpreting your grievance entirely.

            <p>Yeah, that was my point - right now, there&#39;s nothing in any of this that contradicts anything else. I&#39;d like to keep it that way. I never specified whether or not Lyn and Mohan left their portal generator on, though. The way I was planning on having it go, canon-wise, was Lyn making eye contact with Jof, and him teleporting &quot;towards&quot; her when she looks away - because of HQ&#39;s reality-bending nature, and perhaps because they&#39;re already breaking the rules a bit by being in the future, he crosses over the Multiverse and winds up on their side of the divide.<br><br>Mostly, I&#39;m just cautioning about laying down one-hundred percent This Is How It Works rules, because it&#39;s generally a lot more fun when things have multiple plausible explanations, and leaves more room for future authors&#39; creativity.

            <p>... we have two contradictory theories of the Mirror Multiverse phenomenon (if not more), and two materials (concrit and generic surface) which both make up &#39;most&#39; of HQ, and absolutely no unity in how the Flowers sense things, or exactly how getting lost in HQ works, or how portals work, or... anything.

            <p>But the traditional RA shouldn&#39;t be working in the scenario. Any plothole fuelled tech shouldn&#39;t be working, but the narrative laws of comedy could probably make any working portals go extremely wrong.</p>

            <p>In my head, at least, portals are made by a) generating a plothole and b) stabilising it. This implies that an open portal wouldn&#39;t immediately close in the event of power outage - but it would be destabilised. Whether that would lead to immediate closure, alteration of far-end location, change in shape and size, or a &#39;tunnelling&#39;-type flip to another type of plothole altogether... probably depends on the portal (and the Laws of Narrative Comedy).<br><br>I haven&#39;t been keeping track of the blackout thread, but I assume the portals which link the various parts of HQ are still active? (I see that they are - though the differences between the sections have become more pronounced). One might hypothesise that this is because <i>those</i> plotholes were created in the Cascade, and so are &#39;naturally&#39; stable - and, perhaps, that some disguise-generator-esque technology was attached to them to give HQ that uniform &#39;drab grey&#39; effect we all know and... know.<br><br>All of which gives me <i>fantastic</i> ideas for the House Of Rhodes. My original conception was &#39;a handful of the original corridors left&#39; - now I&#39;m seeing &#39;sprawling abandoned mishmash of different, battle-scarred buildings&#39;, with the occasional &#39;tunnelling&#39; portal turning into a different sort of plothole altogether. That&#39;s... pretty awesome, actually.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Considering that the canonical Weeping Angels retain their minds while being in their stone form, the Reality Room would still be able to throw that out of whack, since stone isn&#39;t favorable for high-speed conduction of the sort that would be needed to regulate a sapient being. The statue might or might not dematerialize when it was looked at, but it would essentially be dead even if it could, meaning that it would never be able to shift position again. At that point, you could just disintegrate it and throw the bits into an ocean.<br><br>Plus, that article&#39;s later claim that positrons are just electrons moving backwards in time throws all of the rest of its scientific credibility into question, but that&#39;s not really connected to my other statement.</p>

            <p>Seriously, I was going to write that. Then, I scrolled down and found that you had done it first. (...Barrowman? *shakes fist*) (insert new paragraph here, since I&#39;m on my phone, of all things, and it won&#39;t let me. Where&#39;s Tony when you need him?) Also, I started writing the Adventures. And, of course, I started from the next visitor on the list (Mr. B.) rather than from the beginning. It&#39;s quite fun. (Look at me, using code.

            <p>That&#39;s, like, three-quarters of the DMFF&#39;s duties. They&#39;re the ones in charge of hunting down and sending out or killing otherworldly life forms or structures that appeared in HQ due to the massive amount of plot holes that keep the place suspended in a null zone.<br>World One has the most, because HQ is suspended... I&#39;d say above it, but that doesn&#39;t really make sense because that would imply a three-dimensional direction when we really need to look in causal directions instead.<br><br>Anyway. The plot holes constantly drop things in, and the DMFF has to go around and get rid of them. Sapient and non-omnicidal beings are usually be sent to Personnel and either recruited or neuralyzed and brought home, but if there&#39;s some sort of dangerous creature or a potential biohazard, they&#39;ll have to send a team of Agents to dispatch it. If they don&#39;t, a Land Before Time sharptooth or a clutch of Cthulhuverse Mi&#39;go can come in through a rip in space-time and start wrecking the place. <br><br>Of course, External Security would give them all of the rot jobs, because the DES is there to protect HQ from being permanently damaged, invaded, or compromised, and thus would feel they had better things to do than be animal control.<br><br>... Okay, about half of that was approximated, but now I really want to write a story about these guys.<br><br><br>Oh, and a final note. If there isn&#39;t a plan being made for Weeping Angel disposal by this point in time, one should be made as soon as possible, because SeaTurtle and Pretzel&#39;s roleplay let a few of them in during the power outage, and all their agents did was abscond as fast as their legs and the out-of-battle use of a Pokйmon move could take them. Not a bad course of action, but that means that they&#39;re still in the halls.<br><br>Nobody blink.</p>

            <p>They don&#39;t have a lot of stories, and their purview is incredibly specific if you consider it from a &quot;mission-only&quot; standpoint, because the DIC or DF would take most of their mission fodder. Combine that with the need HQ would have for someone going around and collecting all of the plot hole refugees, and you reach the point where I sort of got carried away.<br><br>It still sounds like something that would happen, though. To me, at least. It isn&#39;t as though those holes in space-time only drop in teenagers from World One who have fervent love for a particular fandom.

            <p>One is that the agents would band together and find a way to kill it. Blasting it with a mineing lazer perhaps? Diamond pickaxe to the face?<br><br>Another is that, because of the impossibility and timey-whimyness (totally a word) of HQ, the angel would gorge itself on time energy from the vast amout of time bending and time travel ocurring in HQ every day. It would be like if the angel got into the TARDIS, and would be a very bad thing.<br><br>The final senario I can think of is that the angel gets locked inside the pool room and becomes a statue because of the lack of energy.

            <p>Also, since I don&#39;t seem to have the energy to go put it in the right place right now, I&#39;m going to take the opportunity to say that your Doctor and Clara end up in HQ story is hilarious, and I caught one typo--you&#39;re missing a closing quote right before the TARDIS starts getting sucked into the plothole (where the Doctor gets interrupted mid-babble about where they&#39;re supposed to be going, something about &#39;from the comfort of the TARDIS&#39;? Sorry, I currently lack the energy to reopen the tab and check.)<br><br>Also, please write more :) I&#39;m enjoying it very much. I&#39;d volunteer my own DW canon agent, but she isn&#39;t even close to coming into play yet, and hS already approved Morgan anyway, so there&#39;s no point. Why am I babbling so much today?

            <p>John in flannel with a be--? Do you mean the lumberjack playing John Watson? That&#39;s the only thing that would make sense...<br><br>Although, mind you, I&#39;m seeing the cap being more Bobby&#39;s than John&#39;s...<br><br>(However, when I first saw it, I went, &#39;CANADA!&#39; rather happily. And then it turned out to be the Roots beaver rather than a maple leaf. Oh well. There&#39;s still a lot of red and white.)<br><br>Ok!<br><br>Yeah? Alright. I won&#39;t be giving you all of her backstory, though, in the interest of not giving away my own plot points. Also, her PPC involvement is still developing, so it&#39;s quite likely that what I tell you now will cease to be true.<br><br>Also, if you&#39;re curious, the story she comes from was my Script Frenzy script two years ago. It quickly spawned a little spin-off AU, and now it&#39;s spawned a PPC AU as well. Plotbunnies these days.<br><br>With that said: time to meet the Reader. (We&#39;ll go with that for her name, in order to avoid spoilers. In her story, she eventually adopts that name because &#39;The Wanderer&#39; sounds rather stupid as a title/name. Reader is an academic position, mostly in the UK, and denotes a senior researcher or scholar. This was chosen in the story because she likes universities and knowledge, and is a sort of researcher of space and time--or at least, that&#39;s how I put it in my notes. &#39;Reader&#39; also works as a play on words, since, of course, a reader is someone who reads, and as a PPC agent she reads and then protects the continua she reads about. While the Reader is technically a different regeneration, I can&#39;t see her choosing &#39;the Wanderer&#39; as a title in this PPC AU thing.)<br><br>So. The Reader&#39;s current regeneration (oh, bother, if my PPC canon for her changes even a tiny bit, this entire thing is inaccurate. Oh well. For the moment, we&#39;ll assume she&#39;s not on the regeneration that would have been the Reader, but instead is on the one that was supposed to be the Wanderer, but isn&#39;t, because she never chose that name--ok, I&#39;m going to stop now, this is getting somewhat confusing.) The Reader&#39;s current regeneration is that of a 21-year-old woman with brown hair and dark blue-grey eyes. Technically, she&#39;s closer to 100 or 150 years old but, well, Time Lords. What can you do. She normally wears a dark plum shirt (not button-up), a jean-jacket, black pants, and hiking shoes. Her hair reaches to approximately mid-back. She has a slight Irish accent. She likes purple quite a lot: she uses a sonic penlight that glows purple, she usually wears at least one purple article of clothing, and the interior of her TARDIS is mainly purple, although it does have indigo highlights. Rather gloomy, now that I think of it. Maybe there&#39;s some lavender or white in there too.<br><br>Speaking of the Reader&#39;s TARDIS, the interior looks rather neglected, since the Reader only found it again recently and has been very, very busy with missions. The TARDIS also had a near-death experience, which didn&#39;t exactly improve matters. The TARDIS looks like a hexagonal garden shed, because she decided that she liked it, and sort of guilted the Reader into letting it stay like that. The TARDIS&#39; near-death experience came from...oh dear, spoilers. Look, let&#39;s just say that the Reader fell through a plothole into HQ before the TARDIS did, and, well, that wasn&#39;t very good, since it meant the Reader registered as almost definitely dead, so the TARDIS started dying. Then, it fell through a plothole as well, and started to recover. It still took the Reader several months after that to find the TARDIS, though.<br><br>The Reader&#39;s personality...ok. She&#39;s still rather traumatized from not only realizing that Gallifrey was gone but from being told that she was fictional and oh, by the way, you&#39;re not completely alone--there&#39;s the Doctor, and the Master, only you can&#39;t actually interact with them, because this isn&#39;t your story, it&#39;s canon, and yes, there are other Time Lord/Lady agents in the PPC, but they&#39;re kind of busy with missions right now, and half of them weren&#39;t even born on Gallifrey. Welcome to the PPC! She has a tendency to be mischievous, doesn&#39;t have a perfect understanding of human culture (although she does know better than to go around staring at the blue sky with one sun). In the PPC, she&#39;s been partnered with a male Klingon agent, who currently lacks a name, which is why I won&#39;t be providing it here. Hopefully he&#39;ll gain one soon. They...get along reasonably well, with the occasional culture clash. They&#39;re in the DMS, for now, although it may end up being DIC by the time they&#39;re actually written. The Klingon agent used to be Agent Dawn&#39;s partner, although that was some time ago by now, and is the same Klingon we meet in the AU exploration thread (the one where you write your agents as originating in a different continuum/being a different species)--or at least, he will be once I finish writing that post and, well, post it. He&#39;s not a bad sort. He&#39;s also a TOS Klingon, mainly because I know them better (and because it sounded like something interesting to explore).<br><br>Uh, what else...the Reader has a habit of talking aloud whether there&#39;s someone there to talk to or not, a habit she developed through years of talking to her TARDIS. She may have been some sort of galactic researcher(-in-training) before Gallifrey was destroyed, but that hinges on whether or not that&#39;s possible in canon (I&#39;m afraid my knowledge of Gallifrey is rather limited). She&#39;s rather somber for the most part, seeing as she&#39;s in mourning (her planet was destroyed, as was nearly her entire species. She&#39;s not exactly Little Miss Happy-Bouncy right now.) How she&#39;d react upon meeting the Doctor is up to you, really--she&#39;d probably be rather startled, and happy/emotional that she can actually talk to him without being constrained by the fact that she&#39;s on a mission, but other than that, she can react in whatever way works best for the story. I mean, if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;ll let you know if she seems ridiculously OOC to me, but other than that, do what you like :) She&#39;s technically still developing, anyway (or at least, the PPC version is.)<br><br>Apologies for the length of this (*winces*), but it was inevitable, seeing as I&#39;m essentially reinventing a character I wrote about almost exactly two years ago. Hopefully it&#39;s readable. (On the plus side, I&#39;m now getting quite excited about writing this story-line. Not such a good thing, considering I haven&#39;t even finished my real first mission, but...at least I know it&#39;ll work out!)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Thanks for the link. I must admit, that rendition of OWA does give more of a sense of dread than the original, what with the female voices chanting, and the low volume of said chanting.<br><br>But let me play devil&#39;s advocate here. For starters, Caius&#39; Theme is a LOT more complex than OWA. First of all, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AJwOxBo704">when you first hear it</a>, you automatically know that an epic battle is about to come down; you cannot miss that sense of &quot;Oh Crap&quot; when you hear it. And it is such a complex piece of music: if you know Latin, you learn a bit about what drives Caius. OWA...not so much.</p>

            <p>AND A PARTRIDGE IN A-- *is forcibly silenced* ...Hello, I&#39;m Agent Dawn, and I&#39;ll be taking over this post now, since DawnFire&#39;s gone insane. Hopefully it&#39;s temporary. Anyway, in that bit with the Avengers, there are six mini-Nick Furys created. DawnFire doesn&#39;t actually remember enough about Phineas and Ferb to take on this fic (all to the good, in my mind, I&#39;m insane enough without having to deal with stuff like this), and is rather squicked by the fic anyway, but she&#39;d be quite happy if someone else took on this fic and delivered the minis safely to the Avengers OFU. Thanks for your time, have a nice day! *pokes DawnFire* Hey, I think she might be waking up! Awesome, that means I can stop being serious. Toodles! ~Dawn~ (and DawnFire. Ugh. I don&#39;t think I want to look past the first chapter, thanks all the same...bye, Dawn. Thanks for taking over there.)</p>

            <p>Since the appearance of other minis can change based on the character misspelled, maybe the mini-inator could differ as well, possibly being something connected to the misspelled character or one of their traits.<br><br>Wait, that might be a little too complicated. Now that I check the wiki, there are about a hundred inators, and most of them are too situational to correlate to characters. <br><br>Hmm... this is more difficult than I thought it would be. Plus, since most of the inators are large ray guns on tiny little support posts, it&#39;s hard to rank how evil they look.</p>

            <p>The Avengers mini is a mini-Nick Fury, but the Percy Jackson mini is a mini-Fury as in the Greek mythological creature. Technically, that latter mini would be a mini-Erinyes, but the OFU got several chapters in calling them mini-Furies and it&#39;s been dead for a while. I just call the Avengers mini a mini-Nick for convenience&#39;s sake. I imagine they could be referred to either way.<br><br>By the way, what are you going to do with your responses that you had on your laptop now that the topic they was in is on the next page over? I still want to find out what sort of creature Agen____t is, and now Ican&#39;t even find the post where I asked the question.</p>

            <p>Well, I was planning on saving it for myself, but if you really want to see it, <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5253574/1/Loving-Niece">here it is</a>.<br><br>I did find some Squire&#39;s Tales badfic, which was an annoying escapade considering that I had originally thought I was looking for badfic of the story in the Canterbury Tales, but the only badfic I found was abandoned after its first two chapters. Disappointing. I found some mediocre fanfiction that constantly spelled Gawain as &quot;Gwaine&quot;, but I don&#39;t think it wasn&#39;t really up to PPC standard for &quot;kill this now&quot;, since it had good SPaG otherwise and had characters recognize its ridiculous premise as ridiculous rather than accepting it at face value.<br><br>There are so many badfics that would be fun to spork, but were abandoned a few chapters in. I remember a story I found a few weeks ago that was labeled as a Batman/Mario crossover, had a blatantly obvious Mary Sue, and stopped updating before Mario even got involved at all. Again, disappointing.<br><br>As for Good Omens fanfic, most of the badfic I could find was really annoying slash or never got anywhere before being abandoned, and then I got to <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/697276">this</a>. There are no words. I can&#39;t even. Too short to spork, but when the entire setting is OOC... just flat what.<br><br>Also, <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6767073/1/Out_of_the_Frying_Pan_and_Into">one more Good Omens one</a>. It&#39;s not the worst of fanfictions, but the prose is impenetrable and it takes place in the Supernatural universe, so I figured you&#39;d want to give it a look. I&#39;ve never watched Supernatural, so I couldn&#39;t tell you how OOC everyone is, but judging by how the story treats Crowley, at least a few of the Supernatural characters are going to be knocked OOC as well. Plus, the scene transition marker is &quot;&amp;!&amp;!&amp;!&amp;!&amp;&quot;, so nobody could ever call it &quot;good&quot;.</p>

            <p>Okay, this is simply my opinion, and I&#39;m not trying to offend anyone, but, yes, I do think guns should be kept at a school. And that regular citizens should have them. Believe me, if someone walked up to the shooter, in, say the Connecticut school shooting and put a gun to his head, I don&#39;t think he would have kept going. In regard to the question raised about a hidden gun frightening children in a classroom: I don&#39;t think its presence should be advertised in the first place, and in the second, being shot would frighten them a lot more. Sorry if this offends anyone.</p>

I don&#39;t like the way it is shaping my opinions of my fellow Boarders.<br><br>My specific proposal is this:<br><br>-No-one new will post on the thread.<br>-Anyone who has already received a reply to a post of theirs may respond to that reply with a single post.<br>-Any further discussion anyone wishes to hold on this subject with anyone on this thread should be taken up in another venue.<br>-It is acceptable to post a one-line reply requesting someone&#39;s email address.<br><br>Regardless of whether people agree to this, I will not be posting any further in this thread. Also regardless, I do not and will not harbour any ill will towards Pauline07 for starting the thread.<br><br>If people do agree, I will do my best not to allow anything said as part of the prior thread or the closing statements to affect how I see anyone. I will also not bring this thread up in any later discussions for any reason.<br><br>If people don&#39;t agree, then those last two points do not stand, since I will assume that people are willing to be seen differently based on what is said here.

            <p>I&#39;m going to have to disagree with you on this.  Closing the thread now kind of feels like a contradiction with what I see the PPC as.  While for the most part, we do have primarily silly conversations, every so often something serious does get discussed.  And on serious issues, people are going to have vastly different opinions.  I feel that closing the thread kind of seems like &quot;no, can&#39;t do this, too serious&quot; which seems discouraging if people want to post a serious topic later on.</p>

            <p>I almost added a note about how there&#39;s nothing wrong with continuing serious discussions - I am a first amendment absolutist, after all. The &#39;Board is not an oligarchy.

            <p>Once again, I seem to be in opposition to the majority opinion. Over all I don&#39;t think this would be such a bad thing, though there are several addendums I would make to that. Such as I&#39;m not sure <i>requiring</i> an armed guard is necessary. But I don&#39;t see the problem with letting teachers or the principal have a gun on school property, provided of course said individual went through the proper training including all possible ways to take down someone without firing a lethal shot, legal process and anyone considering the privilege under go a second and much more thorough background/psych check. I mean I know they are supposed to have that done before being a teacher anyway, but let&#39;s face it, some of the teachers you hear about and what they get caught doing, yeah... I wouldn&#39;t want them to have a gun either. <br><br>As to the fear that a student would get a hold of the firearm, while it nullifies a point I&#39;m going to make in a minute, they can&#39;t get a hold of said firearm if it&#39;s not made known that so and so has a gun. Just keep it locked in a desk drawer, or file cabinet or safe and only take it out if there is an actual threat, and the kids wouldn&#39;t know it was there to try to get it. On the flip side, however, can you honestly say that there would not be one less school shooting if the students perpetrating them knew they could/would face return defensive fire? I know it probably wouldn&#39;t stop them all, but just knowing that you weren&#39;t facing a completely defenseless population, would stop some, maybe even a lot of people I would think. I don&#39;t know, maybe since I can&#39;t even fathom what would cause someone to do such a thing to other people, and yes there are those that deserve to be smacked or punished for their treatment of others. But gunning down whatever random bystanders you can get at is beyond my comprehension, so maybe I&#39;m giving their determination too little credit. But I really do think if someone is planning to shoot up a place, they would think twice or more about it if they knew they would face return fire, and the consequences of getting caught before they had the chance to take their own lives. <br><br>I agree just turning teachers/principals loose with the right to carry in school is probably not the way to go about it, but I don&#39;t see a problem with it once they have gone through the proper legal tape and had proper training, and not just safety and point and shoot, but as I mentioned, ways to incapacitate a threat with out the use of a lethal shot, and of course an additional, more thorough and up to date background check/psych evaluation. But I do agree with  Rep. Jim Lucas (R) about needing to over come the negative stigma attached to guns. A lot more people than you think have guns, and have them legally, and it&#39;s no problem because they aren&#39;t out waving them around. I&#39;ve known people that don&#39;t realize this and they went, pardon my language, completely ape**** when they&#39;ve found out that friends of theirs are gun owners, to the point of all but accusing them of going to come running two states over and shooting up their house, just because they owned guns. So I believe there is reason to work on over coming negative stigmas, however the proper steps need to be taken as well to insure safety while doing it. I grew up in a gunless house, did I feel less safe for it? Not really, it wasn&#39;t something I ever thought about. Now I live in a house with several guns. Do I feel less safe than when there weren&#39;t any around? No, unless you count the few hours a careless person was messing around with them, but he&#39;s not allowed to touch them anymore and can&#39;t get into the gun safe. Do I feel safer knowing they are in the house and there are people who know how to use them? Maybe a little, if I ever think about it. But again, I really don&#39;t think about them being or not being there so it doesn&#39;t affect how I feel about my safety. Are there times I would have felt safer with a gun around and had been thinking about it? Absolutely! I have spent more than one night sitting with my only weapon, in this case a katana, right at, or in hand due to break-ins or drunk neighbors. And I would have felt a lot better had there been a trained gun owner around.<br><br>And to anyone that takes note of it, the only reason I left janitors out of people in school that should be allowed to under the above circumstances, to carry a gun was that janitors may not always be around during school hours, or they may not be employees of the school, ie outside contracted janitorial service. So it would be harder for them to be properly vetted, or since they might not be around during school hours, it would not be as helpful for them to be the lone school defender.  <br><br>(PS I know this is a clean board and I hope I didn&#39;t cross a line by saying something even if I starred it out mostly. If I did, let me know and it won&#39;t happen again.)</p>

            <p>Kids tend to have very vivid imaginations. Having a gun hidden somewhere in the class room might be like having a boogeyman in there to them. I think it would make things feel unsafe.<br><br>And having one hidden in a high school classroom? Nuh-uh.

            <p>The article seems to cover all Indiana schools. So all ages I think?<br><br>True and true, however, they can only feel unsafe about it if they even know it is there. And I know that the knowledge that there are adults at the school that have guns is one of my main points that they would help be a deterrent, I did also state one option to the concern that if kids knew there were guns around they could get at them and there would be more shootings was to keep it secured and not announce that this teacher or that teacher carried a weapon. <br><br>If you are going to announce to the student population who has a gun or that they are in the classrooms, then it is an excellent opportunity to teach them about gun safety and work toward dispelling the negative stigmas surrounding guns. And that goes for all ages. I also think if the teachers or principals are allowed to carry guns after the proper vetting and safety classes it&#39;s a good idea to make it known rather than hide it due to my thoughts that they would be deterrents to further shootings, because hiding it, especially from the parents is a bad way to go about things, and if the parents know, at least some of the students will find out. Plus, hiding them and sneaking around about it is not a good way to work on those negative stigmas... <br><br>I don&#39;t know if I was clear before, but I do not support guns lying around. I know I mentioned locked drawers, locked file cabinets or a safe when pointing out places to keep guns in the event students were not told about them, but the same goes for if everyone knows who has a gun. They definitely need to be locked up, public knowledge they are there or not, that would be part of gun safety. <sup>^</sup></p>

            <p>But... of course the students are going to know if there are guns in a class room.

            <p>As I acknowledged, having the teacher/principals be allowed to  carry guns in school without the knowledge of the student population would be detrimental to the deterrent factor, I only mentioned it as an <i>option</i> for those that argued that the students knowing they were there would make it easier for them to get at and would result in more school shootings.<br><br>And yes, keeping the guns locked up would mean having to take the time to unlock them, but depending on what the shooter was after, where they were forced to start from and how many teachers had their own guns the shooter could not get to them all, so once the alarm was raised more than likely someone could get to their gun and go to help defend the school and children. Is it less than ideal if the point is to defend and save everyone? Probably, but that unfortunately is a necessary delay to ensure the safety of the students from having an unsecured gun around.<br><br>Again, as I previously have pointed out, an addendum to allowing teachers/principals to have their guns in school is that before hand they be properly vetted with an additional stricter background check and psych evaluation to what they may have had to go through to gain the position in the first place to make sure people that might be prone to freak out and be a danger are not allowed to have their guns at schools.<br><br>Not every school has an officer. I went to a smaller Christian school and we didn&#39;t have officers or security guards there. And we did have trouble a couple times with strangers getting into the building and wandering around. Am I saying we needed someone there to be able to shoot them? No, but I&#39;m just pointing out that not every school is going to have safety officers. And yes a great deal of public high schools now a-days have safety officers, security personnel or police officers, what about preschools and elementary only schools? Maybe they do too, I have no experience in those matters. (it&#39;s been years since I knew anyone that was either in or had children in public school at the younger levels.)</p>

            <p>It&#39;s there for a reason.  Guns are a tool, yes, but a tool intended to <i>kill</i> things.  I know the argument is that &quot;guns don&#39;t kill people, people kill people&quot;.  This may be true, but the gun definitely helps.<br><br>Look at it this way.  Let&#39;s say you own a gun for hunting.  You go out and hunt deer.  Are you intending to kill the deer, or merely wound it?<br><br>Guns have a negative stigma because what they tend to be used for (i.e. killing things) is, y&#39;know, a <i>bad</i> thing. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m not going to say I&#39;m sorry for skipping this earlier, I&#39;m not, at the time it was one of the replies that was pushing me toward the &quot;stop posting or you may regret it&quot; end of the spectrum, but that was more due to the place I was in after reading a few of the other replies, and that I think I the first read of your reply wound up in the wrong context. And I did debate whether to reply here or ask that we take it to email or IRC PM. I decided it might be best to reply here since your reply was already up here, as long as I could keep it in the realm of civil discussion. And after having taken a step back and re-reading it and seeing it more in the way it was intended, that will be no problem. I am still going to say this is going to be my last reply on the topic. :) <br><br>Since you made this point, a fine point. I will say, I&#39;ve not actually thought about pointing out that while I say guns have a negative stigma they don&#39;t deserve, this does not mean I think they are wonderful or the best thing eva. More like a necessary evil that don&#39;t have to be &quot;bad&quot; bad so long as precautions are observed and responsibility is used. It means I think they don&#39;t deserve the totality of the negative feelings that are directed at them.<br><br>While I&#39;m not sure where I fall on the whole &quot;guns don&#39;t kill people, people kill people&quot; issue because it&#39;s true they don&#39;t, it&#39;s the people behind them that do, but it&#39;s also true as you state they do definitely help. And while it&#39;s true that the speed will differ greatly, you can make the same case against knives, swords and the bow and arrow, and for the most part those implements do not carry the same stigma. (Although the same friend that flipped out over her friends owning guns, had the same reaction to her having a collection of pocket and small knives. So for some people they do.)<br><br>My thoughts on the hunting argument are that for the purpose of the general point of this discussion, hunting guns generally don&#39;t have quite the rapid fire capability of guns used in school shootings. As to that those who own guns for hunting intend to kill with them, yes that is the purpose of the gun in hunting and those I know that go hunting do intend to kill the quarry, but they also then use the deer or ducks for food. They are not killing for the sake of killing. I also know bow hunters, they too shoot to kill as well, but the bow and arrow don&#39;t carry quite the same stigma that I&#39;ve seen. Maybe I just haven&#39;t seen a lot in that area and I&#39;m totally off base on that.<br><br>You&#39;re right that what a tool is used for determines how it&#39;s seen. I was just trying to say that perhaps it&#39;s more than is deserved in the case of guns, and with some education in the matter, that they could shake the knee-jerk they are absolute evil reactions they cause. Because I don&#39;t believe they are evil, and since we&#39;re never going to get the people that use them in the way that gains them the terrible reputation they have to give them up, or stop obtaining them. I think it&#39;s a good thing for responsible people to be able to also own them to defend themselves and in this case others should need arise. So I still think allowing them in schools in the hands of responsible adults is not a bad idea. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ll start giving out my personal background on the issue: I live in Italy, where guns have thigher regulations. I don&#39;t own a gun myself, but my father owns a .22 semiautomatic carbine, used for target shooting at shooting ranges but once used around 1985 to repel would-be burglars with warning shots.<br><br>The right solution is to do proper regulations about firearms, like background checks and force everyone who owns a gun to store it in a gun locker and not a random drawer.<br><br>I see no problem too in letting teachers carry a gun, as long as they are properly checked, trained and a safe way to keep those guns is found. Security guards would be a better choice IMHO though, since well... that&#39;s what they are supposed to exist for, right?<br><br>The true problem underlying that is, though, that the gun stygma is going to make things worse. As Myrddin just said, there&#39;s people who is branding other people as psychos just because they own a gun.<br><br>Pardon me if that sounds like medieval witch hunting to me. If nobody could use guns legally, criminals would still have them. (Black marked unregistered guns exist)<br>Besides, knives still exist. Sure, with a knife the body count would be surely lower... if someone still has a gun to shoot the perp, or a really good karate/judo/whatever fighter is there, that is. But a crackpot with a knife in a classroom would still be able to do a massacre.<br><br>In the end, the true problem isn&#39;t the weapon. The true problem is the &quot;human&quot; being behind it.</p>

            <p>I respectfully disagree. Please don&#39;t take this personally. Murder is completely against the law. However, people still murder. Certain drugs have an absolute ban in some areas, yet they&#39;re still dealt there. The thing is, even if you ban it, people will still find a way to get it. Banning is not the answer here. </p>

            <p>In the most recent mass murder in the US, the gunman killed 26 people in less than 5 minutes.  That was before the police could arrive.  He also had to shoot his way through a window to get into the building.  If he had only had access to a knife, how many of those teachers and students would have made it out of there alive?  Maybe not all of them, but many more than did.<br><br>The gunman was faced with at least 4 adults as soon as he was through that window.  Two were killed and two were injured.  Now, I am a large man.  I weigh almost 300 pounds, much of which is muscle.  If 4 people tried to keep me from moving, they could easily keep me from doing much of anything for a good long time.  This gunman, as I understand it, was not a large man.  He probably would have injured someone; maybe even killed someone.  However, he would not have been able to kill the 20 children and 6 adults that he did, if he were wielding a knife.<br><br>Guns don&#39;t kill people.  They allow people to kill people with speed, efficiency, and ease.<br><br>-Phobos, who will take a murderer with a knife over a murderer with a gun any day of the week.</p>

            <p>Beside the point that I don&#39;t think you can honestly say that since it&#39;s never been tested, and can&#39;t be (you can&#39;t have the same shooter go in under two different circumstances and find out if they wouldn&#39;t have gone at all under one of them.) Just as I honestly can&#39;t say that it would prevent any of them. I just think it would, just as you think it would not. And maybe it wouldn&#39;t because they already planning on not coming out of it.<br><br>My point was not that they thought they might get out of it alive, but that knowing they were going in to a situation where everyone one was not defenseless would help, because I don&#39;t know the percentage of school shootings that take place where they are expecting return fire, but pretty much all of them go in expecting to die as they are going to kill themselves anyway, but the point is maybe they wouldn&#39;t take out a bunch of bystanders with them if they knew that 1) the place wasn&#39;t defenseless, 2) not only is there the possibility of return fire, but the likely hood that it would happen <i>before</i> they accomplished the taking out of innocent (or in some cases not so innocent, but still not deserving to be shot) bystanders and 3) that there was the distinct possibility that they would not be able to take themselves out before the consequences caught up with them.<br><br>I don&#39;t think there is one school shooter that goes in expecting to come out, the point is they are wanting to die, but they want to be remembered and/or exact vengeance or make some point as they do it, so since they know there are no armed personnel on the premises they know they can walk in, wreak whatever havoc they have in mind and take themselves out before they can be held accountable for their actions. Where as if you allow people who have been properly trained and vetted to carry guns then 1) it might stop some people, 2)even if it doesn&#39;t stop them, they can be stopped before they slaughter a couple dozen people and/or 3) they can be taken alive and held accountable for their actions whether anyone was killed or not. And that last one is also a big factor, I mean I believe people are a lot more prone to do things they wouldn&#39;t do otherwise, terrible or not, if they know there won&#39;t be any consequences. And if you&#39;re not planning on sticking around to feel them, why not do whatever you want?</p>

            <p>Being a Connecticut native who&#39;s seen my friends, family, and my entire community at my last college torn apart on this debate, I don&#39;t think I have the stomach to enter it lightly. I will say that the last article I wrote for that college before leaving was on the topic of guns - control thereof, and arming security therewith. Opinions from student and faculty alike were pretty solidly against arming guards. Most people felt that if someone was determined to bring a gun to school, an armed guard wouldn&#39;t stop them, and might increase the casualty rate - especially if, in a worst-case scenario, the students get ahold of the firearm. I was inclined to agree. If it comes to a shoot-out, things have already gotten pretty bad. About a week after I moved away, though, there was a gun scare at the school, and my friends were posting updates from where they were hiding, underneath their desks in dark classrooms. I don&#39;t know whether it changed anyone&#39;s mind.<br><br>On a completely different subject, Pauline, you might want to slow down with the posting. Not so much slowing the &quot;serious&quot; topics specifically, but if you&#39;ve got something that might fit into another thread, it helps to put it there, rather than start a new thread altogether. You&#39;ve probably noticed that each new thread pushes the old ones down - eventually, they all fall off the side of the &#39;Board, and several pages down, disappear entirely. So it&#39;s preferable to avoid double-posting when possible. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Seems pretty much like a crack-fic but there isn&#39;t any warnings.

            <p>I&#39;ve been recently marathoning New Who and the Potter films (the latter more for the sake of nostalgia) and naturally that led me to browse the crossover section of FFN. And so now I bring you all a badfic and a goodfic from the Potter/Who section of the Pit.<br><br>(Yes, this is an excuse to report a Hermione-Sue, but I also really wanted to rec the goodfic too, so: two birds with one stone.)<br><br>The badfic is <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8467366/1/A-Girl-Out-of-Time">A Girl Out of Time</a>, which is rated R but should be NC-17 for all the NSFW/NSFB it&#39;s got in the form of a sickening Hermione-Sue/Doctor pairing. Apparently Hermione&#39;s a Time Lady and Ron becomes a Death Eater (or something to that extent, at least). Oh, and Hermione and the Doctor are ~soulmates~.<br>(Cue Agent Eledhwen foaming at the mouth. Ignore her.)<br><br>Aaaaand the goodfic is <a>That Which Holds The Image</a>, which is rated PG and features the Trio and the Doctor fighting a Weeping Angel that appears in Hogwarts after materialising from a Boggart. It&#39;s brilliant, because the characters are so bloody in-character, and the plot is pretty well-paced for flitting around Prisoner of Azkaban, and the bits of humour in there (the bit about Godric Gryffindor in particular) are true to both Potter and Who.<br><br>So, yes. I should probably do this more often, rec a goodfic with reporting a badfic. It might balance the universe out a bit better.</p>

            <p>First up, I apologize for barely posting since introducing myself. Apart from being a completely antisocial idiot with severe anxiety, I also have about sixty MEP parts to do and also school and yeah. <br>I do have a sort of question slash discussion topic slash antelope, though. The main event that brought this up was that I was reading a Doctor Who novel last night, and I noticed several inconsistencies with canon.<br>(Okay, I know that there are inconsistencies with Doctor Who canon in the canon itself, I *did* watch Asylum of the Daleks.)<br>That got me thinking, though-do the books actually qualify as canon? They are not necessary for enjoyment of the show, they&#39;re sort of extra content that you can read or not at your own discretion. They are usually not written by regular show writers, either. Does this mean that they are essentially officially sanctioned fanfiction? <br>What about in other fandoms? In a lot of shows/movies/books/et cetera, there&#39;s often extra content with no particular bearing on the canon storyline (filler episodes being a more iffy example of this; more appropriate would be things like little bonus comics you might get for buying a particular offer, or mini-episodes you buy on iTunes). Are these things considered part of the canon? If so, how do we deal with contradictions to the main canon?<br>And this leads us to the elephant in the room-is The Last Airbender considered Avatar canon? (HORRORS UPON HORRORS.)</p>

            <p>Another thing you have to watch out for is when canon incorporates the statements of a character who is an unreliable narrator or who lies. In some cases, fanon claims that the original narrator is unreliable (often with a good excuse, such as changing names and situations to protect the innocent,) in order to clear up inconsistencies in canon. This seems to happen a <i>lot</i> with Sherlockians, in order to clear up such questions as which cases happened first, how many times was Watson married, and why anyone thought that snakes could digest milk. (I&#39;m not even going to get into <i>The Creeping Man.</i> I think for most Sherlockians who were unfortunate enough to read that <i>after</i> starting biology it was a big WTF moment, not that we can blame ACD for not knowing better any more than we can blame Jules Verne for not knowing that Nemo and company would be instantly crushed if they ventured outside of the Nautilus in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.)<br><br>The only series I have any experience of with officially sanctioned fanfiction is the Star Wars Expanded Universe, which seems to me to be a vast collection of Alternate Universes held together by the application of retcons, duct tape, and Timothy Zahn. Unless you were writing fanfiction of a specific EU book or with a specific EU character, I doubt you&#39;d have to bring in any EU &quot;canon&quot; elements.<br><br>The Last Airbender - I can only presume that you refer to the TV series that proceeded The Legend of Korra, so yes, it has to be canon, doesn&#39;t it? ;)</p>

            <p>Even though you probably didn&#39;t mean it, that last sentence juxtaposed The Legend of Korra, widely considered one of the best things to happen to the Avatar franchise, with what is undoubtedly the worst product that will ever be produced under its license. That winking emoticon had better denote that you knew about this and were deliberately trying to put them together to be amusing. Otherwise, the thunder will be brought down! Mountains will shake!

            <p>There will always be plenty of awesome parts of the franchise to rival any others. I think Legend of Korra was the best in regards to the sequence as a whole, but there were definitely plenty of awesome bending battles. I don&#39;t personally remember Toph vs. Iroh, though.

            <p>Honestly, I just wasn&#39;t that into Korra. The love triangle was irritating, and I just couldn&#39;t be as invested in most of the characters. (Aside from Bolin, because Bolin is amazing.) It just seemed to lack the depth of the original.<br><br>And I think I was thinking of Toph vs. Bumi, which was in one of the comics.

            <p>I&#39;m sort of a mild, toe-in-the-water, Doctor Who fan, so don&#39;t place too much importance on my answer.<br>As Neshomeh mentioned, quite a few canons do have hierarchies, so although I don&#39;t know of an established one for Doctor Who, I&#39;d say that the shows would come first for canonical resources, and then the novels. With DW, though, it&#39;s hard to be completely certain. <br>On a completely irrelevant sidetrack: I liked some of the Last Airbender. The scenery was quite wonderful in parts, but the acting was highly amateur, and most of the time Aang was completely out of context for emotional reactions. Or it seemed fake. And they pronounced his name wrong. <br>Anyway, hope this helped! </p>

            <p>The scenery and costumes and special effects were the only good things about that movie. I&#39;m most upset over how they cast it - the Southern Water Tribe, which was in poverty, was Inuit, but the Northern Water Tribe, which in the series came from the exact same ethnic stock as the Southern, was white people! And Aunt Wu&#39;s village, from the deleted scene? In the series, it&#39;s a nice place: in the movie-that-is-not-never-was-and-never-will-be, it&#39;s run-down and dirty and everyone&#39;s black!

            <p>I know some canons that will accept anything that doesn&#39;t directly contradict established material, and throws the entire installment it out the window when established events are broached, and others that officially license Expanded Universe works and treat them as just as canonical as the main source. Then there are others that accept any material given to them, but throw certain volumes out selectively for being stupid, driving people out of character, etcetera. Then there are universes like Star Trek, in which the episodes are the only canon, and all of the books and comics are shunted off into alternate universes that have become so tightly knit with each other&#39;s backstories and histories that they might serve as an independent canon if necessary.<br><br>Just because someone has a license to write in the universe, that doesn&#39;t mean that the creators want the material, or that they will accept it. Even if official policy makes a certain material canonical, an unaware or spiteful writer might deliberately write over it, figuratively speaking, if it doesn&#39;t mesh with his views of how the story should go, even if some of the written-over material was previously part of the &quot;alpha&quot; canon, which creates what is commonly called Continuity Snarl.<br><br>In answer to your two direct questions, yes, the tie-in books of most franchises are officially sanctioned fanfiction. Even the Star Wars Expanded Universe, which makes up almost all of the Star Wars material, is technically fanfiction, and the people at Lucasfilm can and will steamroll over it if they think they have a good idea for a new video game or some such.<br>An EU can be treated as canon, but only the central portions of the franchise are &quot;real&quot; in most cases, and sometimes, not even then. In continuities prone to mass retconning, like DC Comics, this latter point can be a big problem.<br><br>Doctor Who EU in particular was, at least up to the end of the Russel T. Davies era, treated as canonical if it didn&#39;t try to mess with the established material of episodes to make a story with &quot;higher stakes&quot; or some such. See <i>War of the Daleks</i> for a particularly blatant example of attempted retconning that was treated as, as I&#39;ve heard said &quot;a big no-no&quot;.<br>I don&#39;t know how the Steven Moffat era treats it. I&#39;ve seen one episode where the Doctor mentions a few species only ever seen in the EU, and I&#39;ve seen plenty more where several previously established points in Classic Who and the EU were abandoned for cheap kicks.<br><br>For your last question, the M. Night Shyamalan The Last Airbender movie is not considered canon to the cartoon. Both the fans and creators have disavowed it, and at any rate, since it takes place within the same timeframe as canonical events but treats them far differently, to say nothing about the OOC that we see rampant in the storyline, it would be an Alternate Universe story at best.<br><br>(By the way, what were the inconsistencies specific to Asylum of the Daleks? I watch Doctor Who on Netflix, so I&#39;ve not seen most of Series Seven yet.)</p>

            <p>There were several inconsistencies, but my biggest problem was WHERE THE HELL DID ALL OF THESE DALEKS COME FROM?!<br>The Daleks, of course, were Time-Locked along with the Time Lords in the Time War (I think this franchise needs more variety with its descriptive nouns :P). The few times that the Daleks featured in the Davies era, they had at least believable explanations for why they appeared, if the explanations seemed a little forced at times; plus *they were always portrayed as stragglers.*<br>There was no explanation as to where the hundreds of Daleks came from. Why is the Dalek Council there? How did they escape the Time-Lock? Or if they didn&#39;t, WHERE DID THEY COME FROM?! THIS SEEMS LIKE AN IMPORTANT PLOT POINT!<br>Sorry for capslocking in rage.<br>I just sometimes wonder if Moffat&#39;s even trying anymore.</p>

            <p>The Dalek Council didn&#39;t escape the time-lock, for the simple reason that it was never in the time-lock. It was created by the White Dalek and his compatriots after they time-warped to who-knows-where after the (disastrous) Victory of the Daleks episode.<br><br>Of course, your rage about how they managed to spit out hundreds of bronze Daleks to sit on the council just today, and to add an addendum, your rage left out the Dalek Prime Minister. What was he even doing there? He was an Emperor-class mutant, which if I may point out, only exist if an actual Kaled is physically transformed into one(though this was established in a Fourth Doctor story and kind is of confusing, so the writers probably just up and forgot about it like they do most of Classic Who), trapped in a glass tube (despite the fact that this completely removes any usefulness he would have had to the Daleks, because he has no weapons and would need to be purposefully picked up and moved around), and it seemed like he only existed because Moffat said &quot;Hey, guys, wouldn&#39;t it be funny if Daleks had a Parliament, despite the fact that them being governed in that fashion would go against the entire point of the Imperials-Renegades conflict of the 1980s Doctor Who era? I think so too.&quot; Oh, wait, that&#39;s Classic Who again. We <i>can&#39;t</i> have that, can we?<br><br>Wait a second, how did the White Dalek know how to use the progenitor in the first place? <i>His own Strategist Glaurunging killed the only three beings in the universe who knew how to operate it!</i><br>Looks like I found yet another plot hole in Victory of the Daleks. It&#39;s not surprising. There are probably more I didn&#39;t see.</p>

            <p>This was always one of my biggest problems in Victory of the Daleks. The Daleks mysteriously have time-travel technology, and the Doctor does not use his own.<br>The whole &quot;HA HA YOUR PLA-NET IS GOING TO BE DEST-ROYED IN TEN MIN-UTES UNLESS YOU GO DOWN AND STOP... IIIIT!&quot; thing is <i>completely</i> neutered when you realize, hey, this is a Time Lord. He can stop the Daleks, blow up the ship, and go <u>back in time</u> and stop the planet from being blown up!<br><br>The Tenth and Eleventh Doctors are really phobic about meeting their past selves, but they wouldn&#39;t have to! The Ironside Daleks&#39; ship was in the upper atmosphere, and the man-that-was-a-robot-and-also-a-bomb was on the ground in Britain. The two Elevens would be nowhere near each other! The Daleks only escaped by creating a plot hole and a preposterous plot contrivance, and then getting their worst enemy to play along.<br><br>Well, maybe they didn&#39;t create the plot hole. Maybe they just used the one the Ironside Daleks created to escape the wave of kill-all-of-the-Davros-born-Daleks that Metacrisis Ten used in Journey&#39;s End.<br><br>Frigging Victory of the Daleks. Why did nobody actually look over the episode that would revive the iconic aliens of the series to see if it made sense before they shot it?<br><br>For the bit about the time-lock, keep in mind that only inanimate objects could be sent through without going insane and slowly dying in pain, at least if the only two known examples are held up as precedent.<br>I never saw the point of the time-lock, really. The Doctor calls himself the &quot; last of the Time Lords&quot;  because everyone else died on Gallifrey, but when your entire species is capable of constructing, growing, or improvising time machines, there are probably a few dozen that have been living a thousand years in the future because they like the cuisine, or hiding out in the past because they were time criminals, or some such. Heck, given the Classic Who precedent, that bit with the food seems like something they&#39;d do in a blink.<br>Even if we assume that they&#39;re past selves and that they will die on Gallifrey but don&#39;t know yet, just because they&#39;re predestined to die doesn&#39;t make them any less alive at the points in time that they were living in.<br><br>Actually, now that I think about it, the &quot;last of the Time Lords&quot; moniker may have just been adopted by the Doctor because he likes giving himself titles. It would certainly be in character for him.</p>

Over Nine&#39;s run, it was pretty clearly established that the time-lock didn&#39;t just stop things escaping from the final throes of the Last Great Time War - either it or the war itself led to the elimination of anything trapped in it from <i>the history of the universe</i>. In the universe as it stood in <i>Rose</i>, the Time Lords and the Daleks existed only as semi-mythological memories of species advanced enough to have sensed the Time War itself (&quot;Pity the Gelth!&quot;). There were no other escapees, and so there were no other Time Lords. Ever, before or since.<br><br>That has been shattered somewhat more recently - but almost always by things outside the universe. House had records of dozens of Time Lords - in a pocket universe. Not the main one. And that means the rules can change.<br><br>And yes, that means the Doctor&#39;s existence is an anomaly - a crack in the time-lock, as it were. And didn&#39;t someone say recently that if it&#39;s remembered it&#39;s never truly gone...?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>If the Time Lords were retroactively removed from history, the changes would be a <i>whole</i> lot bigger than just having their planet become a myth.<br><br>Back in the Dark Times, the Time Lords were the closest to stability that the universe had, and if they hadn&#39;t repressed other species from developing time-travel technology, there&#39;d be at least a few other time-traveling races jumping around mucking things up. If they hadn&#39;t pepped up the Fledgelings to fight against the Racnoss, a sizable chunk of the universe would have been consumed, and furthermore, the Empress would have never needed to invade Earth. Etcetera etcetera. There are bits about the Daleks, too but mostly &quot;and this and that planet wouldn&#39;t have perished in flames&quot;, which is really all the Daleks ever did.<br><br>The Time Lords were always a myth. It was an image they&#39;d cultivated during their early days so that people wouldn&#39;t steal their time machines and instead think of them as gods incarnate, and they&#39;d definitely be a myth in the year when the Earth was destroyed, because they tended to hang around the 100 B.C.-4000 A.D. range, to give a wild guess that&#39;s probably off a few millennia, ad the Earth ended in a year in the billions. The Time Lords wouldn&#39;t go around introducing themselves to every species that had ever existed, is what I&#39;m trying to say here.</p>

            <p>Not to mention that there were only five Daleks that escaped from the Progenitor, and that was stated to be either the last or one of the last (I haven&#39;t watched the episode in a while, so I forget exactly which). I might just be extremely dumb and/or not up-to-date with my Dalek procreation methods, but I&#39;m not entirely certain that they could create thousands of Daleks in that period of time. I&#39;m also not exactly willing to believe that that many Daleks running around would not have any effect on Tennant&#39;s and Eccleston&#39;s seasons (or even Smith&#39;s early ones).<br><br>Also, wasn&#39;t Skaro imprisoned in the Time Lock as well? Call me crazy, but I think that an entire planet escaping from the lock would probably attract *someone&#39;s* notice.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I do think that Moffat seems to have gotten his swing back! I really liked the premiere, and I&#39;m excited to see the rest of the season.

            <p>... it&#39;s perfectly possible to create Daleks from cells of a pre-existing Dalek. The problems with the <i>Parting of the Ways</i> and <i>Journey&#39;s End</i> Daleks was that they were cloned from non-pure Dalek sources - which is why the Progenitor was needed in the first place. Once they had the DNA, they could make as many as they needed.<br><br>(As to why time-travelling Daleks never caused trouble in earlier seasons... well, once you figure out why both Daleks and Cybermen linked their technological progress to the Doctor&#39;s regeneration cycle in Old Who - and why the time-travelling Master did the same thing with his regenerations and his plans - <i>then</i> I&#39;ll try and come up with an answer. :P)<br><br>Also also wik: <i>what</i> period of time? Was there a date pinned on <i>Asylum</i> that I&#39;ve forgotten about? That story could have taken place ten thousand subjective years after the last one. Heck, it&#39;s at least two hundred for the Doctor, judging by the ages he gives.<br><br>Or... wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey. It just works like that. :P<br><br>hS<br><br>(Re: Skaro... yes. :P No answer to that, it should be gone from history. Unless, and this is just a theory, maybe the near-breaking of the lock during <i>End of Time</i> let a few things slip out? Not the Daleks themselves, but the ruins of their planet...?)</p>

            <p>I just thought of something. During The End of Time, Gallifrey was completely removed from the time-lock for about fifteen minutes due to Rassilon messing with the Master&#39;s personal history. Well, the Time Lords were stated in an earlier episode to have used their TARDISes as vehicles in which to fight their enemies in the Time War, and since Gallifrey&#39;s cities and dominion were still (barely) standing at the point in Gallifrey&#39;s personal timeline that the version pulled out of the lock in The End of Time was, wouldn&#39;t at least a few of those TARDISes still exist?<br><br>Most of the Time Lords native to that Gallifrey&#39;s era would have stayed on Gallifrey the entire time, of course, because Rassilon had promised them a new Time Lord empire if his plan went through, but at least a few might have done as the Master did and just decided they&#39;d had enough. They&#39;d have had plenty of time to get out while Rassilon was monologuing and name-dropping the episode title. There were something like five billion people on Gallifrey; it&#39;s statistically impossible that at least a few weren&#39;t tired of endless time-looped years in a devastating war against a species that only a few of them had met before the combat started.<br><br>On another note, how did the Master escape the lock in the first place? He turned himself human and fled to the last point in space-time he could go, but how did he get there? Just because he&#39;s human shouldn&#39;t let him navigate through the damage to the time vortex that kept the time-lock up, and it should in fact have hindered him severely. Adding to that, his human form Yana had no time machine and little technical ability, so after he turned human, so how did he get so far into the future in the first place?<br><br>Did the Master just steal a TARDIS from one of the other Time Lords and hoof it right before Nine used The Moment? And if so, why did he need to turn human at all?<br><br>Another note regarding the Progenitor: I&#39;m not exactly sure how much closer to &quot;pure Dalek DNA&quot; you can get than the cells of the being in the universe who is not only from the same species that became your ancestors without going back to the Tom Baker era and just abducting one of the Renegades. Of course, it&#39;s always possible that Dalek evolution was stabilized by the high radiation levels on Skaro, and that Daleks are now indisputably a separate species from how they started out. This raises the question of how the Progenitor would still work, though. It was a Second Doctor artifact, and at a point that close to the origin of the Daleks, they&#39;d still be more Kaled than not.<br>Of course, the Kaleds were introduced in a Fourth Doctor story, but we&#39;re not going to get anywhere in discussing Doctor Who if we refer to show airdate chronology as if it&#39;s a straight line relative to the Daleks&#39; personal timestream.</p>

            <p>Some of them have sort of a canon hierarchy—for instance, I know <i>Star Wars</i> has <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Canon#Canon_in_the_Holocron_continuity_database">a ranking system</a> for canon materials, with the six films and Word of God at the top. Lower-ranked materials tend to be considered canon only if they don&#39;t contradict the materials ranked above them. Same goes for the Warcraft universe: <i>World of Warcraft</i> is at the top, followed by previous games, followed by books and other stuff. Using elements from lower-ranked materials in a fic supposedly set in the &quot;alpha&quot; canon can be problematic, but if it&#39;s justified and works well in the story, there&#39;s not much to complain about. <i>Doctor Who</i> probably works like this, but someone more familiar with the fandom can tell you better than I can.<br><br>Others, like <i>Harry Potter</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, have separate movieverse and bookverse (and gameverse and whatever-elseverse) canons. They&#39;re protected equally by the PPC, but are distinct from each other, and trying to use movieverse elements in an explicitly bookverse fic (or vice versa) can be problematic and sometimes charge-worthy. I think the A:TLA movieverse vs. showverse fits into this category.<br><br>I hope that helps!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

However, when I say this, keep in mind that black coffee is not coffee. That is tea made from coffee beans, and is nasty, unlike most tea. Coffee has cream, sugar, and perhaps some hazelnut flavor to mix it up a little.</p>

            <p>If somebody wants to throw building materials at somebody else just because they happen to enjoy a beverage that is also enjoyed by Jean-Luc Picard, I would hate to see what happens when they&#39;re cut off in traffic or on an airplane with a colicky baby.<br><br>To answer the first post&#39;s question, I&#39;ve never liked coffee. It&#39;s not the caffeine, it&#39;s more due to a taste aversion from my childhood days when I was sleeping over at my grandparents&#39; house and thought it would be a good idea to try and make some myself. I think I was nine. You can probably imagine how that turned out. If you can&#39;t, the reveal that this was the same day I learned that colby jack cheese is not a good topping for oatmeal should help you along.<br><br>I&#39;ve sort of acquired a taste for soda after my first few months as a DM. In DnD, if you don&#39;t like the Mountain Dew and Generic Dollar General Grape the guy who was picked to be the host that week left in his mini-fridge for washing down your snack cookies and cheese-cracker squares, there&#39;s not really a lot of other options as far as beverages are concerned.<br>I agree with you about how oversweetened it is, though. That&#39;s why I tend not to drink a lot of it outside the meetings.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t have a preference between green and black; it just depends on the day. I also like oolong, and I&#39;ve met good and boring white teas. In addition to a straight black and straight green tea (or possibly several), I think every tea stash should include jasmine green tea and Earl Grey. Also chai.<br><br>As for non-<i>Camellia sinensis</i> infusions, I&#39;m not a big fan of rooibos, but it can be okay when blended with other stuff. Mate is good if you need the extra energy boost. Don&#39;t drink it late at night if you plan on sleeping. Herbal teas vary so much it just depends, but I don&#39;t usually like fruit-based ones, since they tend to be too acidic for my taste. I don&#39;t like most bottled iced teas for the same reason: they add citric acid as a preservative, and it&#39;s just too harsh. Bigelow has a seasonal herbal tea called Ginger Snappish that I really love, though. It&#39;s smooth and sweet while also being suitably gingery and lemony, and I&#39;m actually drinking my last cup of it from this winter right now. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I was reading a website of a magazine I occasionally look at (hey, I&#39;m a teenager and I&#39;m vain) and I stumbled across this little treasure; wondered if anyone else had any thoughts?<br><a href="http://www.girlslife.com/post/2013/04/01/School-cancels-coolest-after-school-program-ever-after-parents-complain.aspx"><a href="http://www.girlslife.com/post/2013/04/01/School-cancels-coolest-after-school-program-ever-after-parents-complain.aspx">http://www.girlslife.com/post/2013/04/01/School-cancels-coolest-after-school-program-ever-after-parents-complain.aspx</a></a><br>Honestly, my first thought is that I would love for my high school to do something like this. The number one thing I see these days is catatonia. Although a lot of people would complain for some reason if lectures were reduced.......don&#39;t ask me, I suspect it&#39;s because they&#39;re self conscious and they enjoy texting under the desks. But I digress....<br>Anyway, the teachers, when they put their minds to it, plan a bunch of creative things. I can honestly say one of my best classes this year stays far away from textbooks, and instead does a lot of projects, discussion and writing (all right, you caught me. I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s an easy class to make interesting, at least for me.....although English is also REALLY easy to suck the fun out of. Plus, my Social Studies is included here too). This school planned this amazing course, though, that got students really interested. I would love to take this- it would be fantastic. So my first point is I wish that schools would plan more of these classes that put learning in a more interesting setting. I remember the first words out of my History teachers mouth last year were, &quot;I&#39;m not here to entertain you.&quot; Yeah, I get it. It&#39;s not like schools are supposed to be TV. But is it fun for teachers to just stand there and lecture you? Or watch you finish worksheets? Because it really isn&#39;t that fun on the other side of the equation, either. Besides, one of the points of school is to teach us how to learn. Half of this stuff we aren&#39;t going to remember past finals if it&#39;s not our career path, and that&#39;s ok. If the learning isn&#39;t fun, why would we look to it so much in the future? <br>Then again, teachers don&#39;t particularly have enough time to plan this stuff.....but don&#39;t get me started on the public school rant unless you want to be here all day.<br>My second point is this: why are the parents shutting this down? I&#39;m sorry if you think parental censorship is great, but I simply never understood it. Any one of you pro-censors (if you&#39;re there, that is) mind explaining this to me? Literally, my parents never did anything of the sort. One time my first great teacher caught me explaining to the other students the.....erm, I&#39;ll just censor that out. Anyway, you can imagine how that went....but that&#39;s another tangent. Back on topic. <br>Here&#39;s my view on it: Yeah, there is a certain age where certain things probably should be kept to certain standards. But we can&#39;t really hide our kids from reality forever. Now, if this were a course for first graders, I&#39;d get what the issue is. Sort f But this is a course for high scholars. Do they really think we haven&#39;t seen or read about graphic violence before? <br>My personal views on all censorship for children are a little radical...okay, highly radical, and I&#39;ll admit that. But I don&#39;t really understand this high school censorship- we don&#39;t know everything, and we never will even if we think we do. But first of all, that&#39;s what school is for. And B, if you&#39;re going to cut out educating us about violence, why not cut Social Studies for our education on wars, certain books in our English class (The Oddessy is violent as heck, but we still read it). Even science has it&#39;s violent tendencies. Seriously, the only subject I&#39;ve seen no violence with so far is math, and to that point there&#39;s probably something I don&#39;t know about yet. <br>Sorry all that rant got mixed in there with my thoughts.....but I just wanted to spark a discussion. What do you guys think? <br></p>

            <p>Insofar as I remember my high school days (they&#39;re only three years ago, after all,) I remember liking different teachers more than their subjects. For example, I had advanced composition with a sarcastic little old woman who we were all firmly convinced was british, and pretty much my entire class asked &quot;how high?&quot; whenever she said &quot;jump.&quot; I don&#39;t remember liking the actual assignments that much, but I loved the actual class, despite having despised English the year before when I&#39;d had American Lit. My chemistry classes, which I&#39;d expected to be interesting, got really boring aft er the teacher stopped being able to explain things very well, and I won&#39;t even trouble you with my junior year Spanish teacher, who was universally hated.<br><br>With the right teacher, history can be amazing. (Like Neshomeh, I also read the Horrible Histories, but I also made myself instantly popular with the boys and unpopular with the rest of the girls in first grade when I presented &quot;how mummies were made,&quot; and talked about them pulling the brain out through the nose, so my standards of what&#39;s cool tend towards the zombie attack school.) I&#39;ve also had extraordinarily dull history teachers, but luckily I&#39;ve learned to read between the lines (and to watch Hetalia) so that I can get through those negative charisma point teachers.<br><br>What I think the main reason might be for this course being removed or changed is probably because it doesn&#39;t sound educational, and parents and school board members want everything to sound as educational as possible. I&#39;m pretty certain the school board at my high school would have wondered what the &quot;educational value&quot; of a class called &quot;Zombie Apocalypse Survival&quot; was, and not even bothered to investigate that it&#39;s a class where you read and write about the zombie apocalypse. <br><br>Never fear, though: depending on what college or university you go to and what you major in, the fun classes start there. In the past three years I&#39;ve had the most fun in my Philosophy class, which was surprising given that most people expected it to be boring, an environmental sciences class where we had a field trip every week, Latin (our textbook was surprisingly dirty and we didn&#39;t get points taken off for some of our most ludicrous translations, such as &quot;the poured soldier was a column,&quot;) and biology, a class I roundly hated in high school. <br><br>(Also, math gets violent when it turns into statistics or economics. :D )</p>

            <p>Erm....a smoothie, not old enough to drink yet. But that&#39;s so off topic.....<br><br>I think it&#39;s a mixture of both. I&#39;ve never had an interesting math teacher (There&#39;s probably one out there.....hopefully.....somewhere.....) but I had this one teacher in 6th grade English that made me absolutely hate his class. He was so boring and I can&#39;t remember a darn thing he taught us. My classes this year aren&#39;t bad. I have one teacher who&#39;s a lot like me, and since we have about five people in that class, we&#39;ve really bonded. And then my Social Studies teacher is the bomb (before she ended up in the hospital three weeks ago.....long story. She&#39;s doing better). <br><br>Although I still don&#39;t understand other people sometimes. We have a teacher, our science teacher, who uses a lot of what he calls &quot;virtual labs&quot;. Sometimes they are really virtual labs, sometimes they&#39;re scavenger hunts across the internet, and sometimes they are practice problems or articles, even online movies. But everyone says they&#39;re pointless and he&#39;s a horrible teacher because he doesn&#39;t lecture enough. And then we have this great student teacher in our math class who tries to do some fun stuff with Geometry, and everyone&#39;s like &quot;I wish she would just lecture.&quot; So I&#39;m just like &quot;?&quot;. I mean, he&#39;s not that engaging a teacher, so he can do smaller explanations but lectures don&#39;t work out that well. And math is a boring subject for us all. Why do they just want lectures? <br><br>The worst part is they say something of that sort right in front of the teacher in question. So it&#39;s really rude. <br><br>I don&#39;t mind saying I hate a teacher. I&#39;ve hated a lot of teachers. I do, however, wait until said teacher is out of earshot. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve had a moderately interesting math teacher. It was in Statistics. <br><br>Your classmates are, if you&#39;ll excuse the presumption, lazy teenagers who prefer not to participate actively in anything and would prefer a lecture so that it isn&#39;t so obvious that they&#39;re texting under their desks, off in la-la-land, or obviously not following the material. (Also, if notes aren&#39;t being checked, lectures usually seem like &quot;less&quot; work to most people whereas most teenagers think any in-class participation or excercizes is &quot;more&quot; work.)<br><br>I&#39;ve only ever had one teacher who I was tempted to tell the truth to (that I hated her guts) and she was a math teacher who actively played favorites, so that&#39;s sort of beside the point.</p>

            <p>Zeroth thought: Pauline, you&#39;ve probably noticed most people around here - or on the internet in general - put an extra line break between paragraphs. For some reason I&#39;ve never been able to figure out - but Neshomeh could probably tell me - it makes reading from a screen a heck of a lot easier. Looks awful in books, though...<br><br>First thought: On the subject of interesting/enjoyable/educational lessons, I&#39;m going to pull in three examples from my own experience:<br><br>-At one extreme, we have my Physical Chemistry lectures at university. These were blighted by the fact that two of our three lecturers actually had negative charisma (one of them literally read the slides out to us - yes, fine, I can do that myself). I had a horrible time trying to learn the stuff, although I did pass the exams with the aid of last-minute revision outside the hall. Don&#39;t remember the equations now, though.<br><br>-At the other extreme, my wife (Kaitlyn, she&#39;s around occasionally) had a... very... uh... <i>interesting</i> lecturer for some course at uni. Her assignments included trying to sell a piece of junk on eBay, and making a new Wikipedia page (without it getting immediately deleted). Okay, that&#39;s highly entertaining, and the latter taught her a few things about citing and referencing - but I don&#39;t know that she took anything else away from the class.<br><br>-And then there&#39;s the middle ground.<br><br><i>Erste links<br>Zweite rechts<br>Dann gerade aus...</i><br><br>German class at... oh, probably age 15? Could have been as early as 11 or 12. Our classes were firmly based in the textbook, but the <i>textbooks</i> were interesting, with random songs, stories, all sorts. French, too.<br><br><i>Tu comprende maintenant?</i><br><br>I have kept a far better working knowledge of (basic) German than I have equation-based physics and chemistry - and I&#39;m a chemist. My teachers knew their jobs, made the class engaging enough to keep our attention, but also got the words to stick.<br><br>(Interestingly, I took German at AS-level - age 17 - and gave up. My only memory is a horrible, pointless creative-writing exercise which I didn&#39;t connect with at all. So there&#39;s that)<br><br>Second thought: I learnt a lot of my history from <i>Horrible Histories</i> (the books, not the TV show), tag line: &#39;History with the nasty bits left in&#39;. That gave me a pretty good grasp of what things were actually like in the past (in contrast to the rather generic view I picked up in the early parts of school).<br><br>But here&#39;s the thing: they were still kids&#39; books. They were censored - of course they were, with their charming little cartoony pictures. If I&#39;d opened one and found gruesomely realistic photos, I&#39;d have screamed the house down.<br><br>You say: &quot;Do they really think we haven&#39;t seen or read about graphic violence before?&quot; My answer is: I&#39;ve certainly never seen any, and I&#39;m nearly 30 (ohdearstarsI&#39;mold). I&#39;ve seen <i>films</i> which featured it, but most of that was off-screen (action films and the like). The few occasions when I&#39;ve encountered it directly in the media, I&#39;ve wished I hadn&#39;t. Nightmares did follow.<br><br>(Of course, nightmares also followed <i>Jurassic Park</i>, but I was a lot younger then)<br><br>And now I have two children of my own, and (astonishingly, I know) I haven&#39;t completely forgotten what it was like to be young. Yes, there will be different experiences - a different world - to shape my children&#39;s view of things... but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not going to <i>try</i> and stop them from encountering things which will damage them (in whatever way). I might get a few things wrong - but I&#39;d like to imagine I&#39;ll be able to listen to them as well as to me.<br><br>Third thought:<br><br><i>If you&#39;re going to cut out educating us about violence, why not cut Social Studies for our education on wars, certain books in our English class (The Oddessy is violent as heck, but we still read it).

            <p>Thanks for the heads up!<br><br>Well, a class of all games wouldn&#39;t work. But I disagree that something at that end of the spectrum is not educational. You would just need the instructor to explain it to make sense, I guess. <br><br>Then again, I&#39;m horribly hyper and creative, so that might just be me :)<br><br>Sorry, guess I didn&#39;t make myself clear: I&#39;m definitely not saying that we should watch graphic violence. Bad things follow, and not that many people in my grade are that interested in gore. But is the reading as bad? It would depend on the book itself. I&#39;ve read some violence, and honestly I tended to skim those parts. But I have read it, and most of the grade has had a little exposure at least. <br><br>Let&#39;s just agree to disagree on the last part. Both can be equally as horrible depending on a number of factors, including who&#39;s listening?</p>

            <p>On a more serious note, the part of my history lessons that dealt with the Nazis featured some pretty graphic stuff, and that was in ninth grade. Then again, this was in Germany and supposedly meant to shock us into not ever doing stuff like that again... or something, I don&#39;t even know. Books that featured semi-graphic descriptions of people getting blown up were required reading for SIXTH grade German class. Also, my eighth grade English teacher made us watch &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, with the excuse that we wouldn&#39;t be able to understand the nastier language (as if <i>that</i> were the worst part). Childhood innocence? What childhood innocence?</p>

            <p>Which sounds like a sci-fi name rather than an ordinal... or maybe a supervillain whose power is to make evil, grainy copies of things.<br><br>But I digress.<br><br>I think it&#39;s mostly because nobody uses first-line indentation online, which is what books normally have to set off new paragraphs; it&#39;s easier to hit &quot;Enter&quot; a couple of times than it is to remember the HTML/CSS code for creating an indent, assuming you&#39;re even posting someplace that allows that sort of code. Either way, though, I believe the idea is to make sure there&#39;s no possibility of confusing where one paragraph ends and the next one begins, such as if the last line of the previous paragraph is the same length as the first line of the following one.<br><br>I also find that double line-breaks (also called hard returns, I learned that today) are easier to read than indentation online, but I don&#39;t know why that is. Maybe because the average computer screen is wider than the average page, so that little indent doesn&#39;t take up as much space relatively and is thus less noticeable? I dunno.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who couldn&#39;t ignore an invitation like that.</p>

            <p>So are the other two I found back-tracking from it. I don&#39;t think I can form a fair opinion about this without knowing what materials the teacher was using and what actually went on in the class sessions. I mean, the Zombie Survival Guide is pretty harmless, IIRC, but was that it? People seem to be upset about an &quot;emphasis on violence&quot; in the class. I suppose that could have come out of generalizations that all zombie materials are about gore and merciless slaughter, but it could also have been a real, present issue with the materials and/or class discussions. I wasn&#39;t there, I don&#39;t know what the teacher spent his time talking about.<br><br>This is slightly beside the point, but I&#39;d also like to know how the class got started in the first place if &quot;the use of zombie-related materials ... was not approved in accordance with district curricular policies.&quot; I&#39;d assume new classes, even optional ones, have to go through some kind of official vetting to be added to the class lists, so who signed off on it in the first place, and why didn&#39;t they know it was against their school district&#39;s policies? And, parents, don&#39;t you pay attention to what classes your kids are signing up for? How did this even exist long enough to be cancelled if it&#39;s against everyone&#39;s parental and curricular policies?<br><br>Too many questions for me.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Though I think the reason it wasn&#39;t vetted is because it was an extra-curricular activity, rather than an academic class. The Huffington Post article is a little more clear on that, though all the articles seem to muddy the waters by talking about academic value... which is somewhat irrelevant to an extra-curricular program. That fact also has me seriously wondering if it was all that necessary to cancel the program outright, rather than just having kids need a permission slip, or somesuch.</p>

            <p>My middle and high schools had &quot;electives,&quot; which were regular-hours classes, but weren&#39;t part of the standard English-History-Math-Science core. Electives included gym, music, art, creative writing, and foreign languages, IIRC.

            <p>I see your point. I get that we don&#39;t know the whole story. But whatever violence there was in the class, someone didn&#39;t think it was too much (whoever signed off on the thing and whoever ran it) and if some parents thought it was too much, they still cut it for the rest of the student body. <br>I don&#39;t know, maybe it was really too much.

            <p>&quot;Parents... were concerned about the violence inherent in the subject matter...&quot;<br>Is it just me, or did they make a subtle reference to Monty Python?<br><br>Honestly, I think a zombie apocalypse survival writing program could be very successful and harmless if done well. While most movies and shows on the subject are extremely violent (it&#39;s a situation that allows you to lay waste to endless numbers of human-shaped creatures with no consequences whatsoever), there are many other aspects to consider. Perhaps the largest and most pervasive of these is the element of survival. If you were really in a zombie apocalypse (or any kind of post-apocalyptic scenario, for that matter), you would spend a lot less time dispatching the shuffling hordes and much more time obtaining shelter, food, clean water, etc, not to mention trying to find a way to contact other survivors. (Would you use a radio like in &quot;I Am Legend&quot;?) You can use a lot of creativity here.<br><br>There are also aspects of world-building, and things like the origin of your zombies to consider. Did they come from a virus? A voodoo ritual? Are there zombie animals? Do they retain a degree of intelligence? Can they be restored to life (like in &quot;Warm Bodies&quot;)?<br><br>This is just the beginning. Then again, in a school that suspends students for drawing a picture of a gun, writing about a gun might be equally forbidden.</p>

            <p>To be fair, though... most people in my creative writing classes were somewhat self-censoring with regards to violence due to the fact that the stories were being read and graded. I know that student two&#39;s example is kind of disgusting, but it&#39;s honestly so over-the-top that it&#39;s hard to take seriously, and would probably pass muster at certain schools or at a certain age. (It sounds a bit like the most passable sentence in the revamped, zombie apocalypse themed &quot;Eye of Argon,&quot; known as the <i>Eyes of Aaaaaaargh!</i>) The kids you have to worry about are the ones who aren&#39;t aware of the violence of what they&#39;re writing, and schools are usually pretty bad at catching them through examining their &quot;creative expressions.&quot;</p>

I think today I&#39;ll be my mini-boarder and stay anonymous today.<br><br>Normally when people start talking about rights and censorship and whose allowed to marry who (I know not the point, but it&#39;s one of those issues) or what constitutes stepping on &quot;pet rights&quot; (also not the issue) or who&#39;s allowed to eat what or how far you&#39;re allowed to &quot;influence&quot; your children and whether punishment is ever appropriate or politics in general, I bow out of things rather than join the shouting match that ensues when both sides try to voice the &quot;right&quot; opinion.<br><br>I thought I might offer an opinion from the other POV here though, since I can hide behind anonymity of not having a set posting name, but rather being allowed to type in whatever one wants, and also because unlike some boards I visit, I don&#39;t see this as a particularly liberal leaning (or any leaning really) board, so perhaps a meaningful discussion can be had without things degrading to insults and shouting. (Which is oddly enough how most discussion boards on the liberal sites I&#39;m a part of start out rather than degrade to...)<br><br>Anywho, on to the opinions! :3 About parental censorship, yes I think it&#39;s a good thing actually because what most teens see as and cry &quot;censorship&quot; at is more their parents trying to protect them, since that&#39;s what parents do. Can it be taken too far? Of course, but then again, every good thing can be taken too far. But is not allowing younger children especially (these are 11-14 year olds we&#39;re talking about in this article) to be exposed to excessive or gratuitous violence, sex, drugs, profanity, etc appropriate just because they can get it from other sources? I really don&#39;t think so. As for the argument that they have seen it before, if the parents are watching what their kids are up to, then no, no they haven&#39;t, and those parents that care enough to speak up against this are watching their kids and should be allowed to shield them, from certain things, that is their right as a parent. (Once again everything including this can be taken way too far, but that doesn&#39;t mean it should be stopped altogether) I&#39;ve met children who run wild and destroy things and get into nasty crap because their parents don&#39;t want to do anything to &quot;stifle or censor or shelter&quot; them, they don&#39;t end up well. Or how about the middle-schoolers that show up with guns or kill themselves over a C or a break up because they don&#39;t understand the permanence or seriousness of death due to being inundated with it from a young age rather than sheltered a bit? Am I saying everyone who plays shot&#39;em up games, or watches violent programming is going to go out shooting? No, I&#39;m just saying this &quot;no censorship eva&quot; attitude leads to a lot of desensitization, which can precipitate other behavior. As a less extreme example, think about the 4 and 5 year olds that scream profanities at store clerks or in restaurants because the don&#39;t get their way and their parents either do nothing rather than risk trampling their &quot;rights&quot; or &quot;censoring them&quot; or they give in and get whatever the kid is asking for?<br><br>Hmm, and I think this too turned into a rant, I do apologize. Strictly the issue at hand, do I think parents should be able to have certain things censored from schools? Yes, in the case that it is a required course/reading/etc. Do I think this was such a case? No, it doesn&#39;t sound like it. And as an avid reader, I didn&#39;t need such things to keep me interested, I would have gone to the exploratory reading program happily. However, if parents are concerned about the inherent violence to the subject (a valid fear in my opinion) then in this case, as it is optional, don&#39;t sign your kid up for it, it&#39;s not the school&#39;s responsibility to raise your kid, you don&#39;t like their program, take time and come up with a way to get your own kid into reading, even if it&#39;s just a trip to the library to find appropriate books that interest them and unplugging the cable box , video games and internet for a couple nights a week. When me and my siblings were younger, both my mom and dad would read to us at night for family time. We colored or cross-stitched and they would read. That&#39;s how I found Tolkien. It&#39;s also how I discovered the difference between fiction and non-fiction.<br><br>And as for your cases of not understanding censorship, you said you were 14? 15? No one understands why they can&#39;t do what they want at that age, (some people never grow out of it), I know I didn&#39;t. But was I emotionally scared by my parents protecting me, even when it was from Scooby-Doo because it was &quot;too dumb&quot; and we didn&#39;t need to be watching it? No, I wasn&#39;t actually harmed by it in anyway. And in a lot of cases it was a very good thing. I can&#39;t stand all that horror/gratuitous violence/gore/etc, I simply can not handle it, I have a very vivid imagination, if you say it/I read it, I see it, and probably worse than it would be had I seen it. Even talking about it I can start imagining horrific things, so I don&#39;t think programs that require that sort of thing should be allowed in schools. If parents wish to allow it at home, that&#39;s one thing, and again, I don&#39;t think an anything is allowed because we can&#39;t stop it approach is good, but it&#39;s still based more individually than a school saying you must read/attend/watch this that may have age inappropriate themes. Wait another 15 years, or til you have kids, you&#39;ll understand it then. As to the history books, I&#39;ve not ever seen a history text book that had gratuitous or gory descriptions of the wars of history. That&#39;s just, I&#39;m sorry, having a fit and saying if you&#39;re going to censor one thing for being overly gratuitous why not censor all mention of anything bad ever and be done with it. That is not the sort of extreme all or nothing argument to be making if you want people to respect your positions, and that is not directed at you, it&#39;s directed at the internet where people seem to think that sort of attack is the way to win. As for historical accounts, I&#39;ve read the Odyssey and the Iliad, and yes, they can get pretty bad, but then again they are not required reading til later high school. I&#39;ve also read historical accounts of Nazi prison camps that really aren&#39;t that bad in the graphic/gratuitous description of things area. Were they disturbing and terrible? Yes, but they were able to tell their story accurately and evoke the emotions/outrage that are associated with those actions without describing every single graphic torture in detail. Just sayin&#39;<br><br>Sorry to ramble on like that, and rant at things, but there it is...</p>

            <p>First I should sincerely like to apologize for any toes I stepped on. That was not my intent, in either posting anonymously, or in that I ended up a bit on the rant-y side in the end.<br><br>Tray-Gnome, VixenMage and Huinesoron, I understand the problems that come with posting anonymously and the reason for the strong discouraging there of as it is most often abused. However from what is said in the Constitution;<br><br><i>Stick to one penname across the PPC as far as possible — or at least make it clear that the different names are still you. Please don’t deliberately use multiple names — it’s confuzzling and pointlessly annoying...</i><br><br>I understood it to be a strongly suggested request to keep confusion and drama down rather than a hard, fast, absolute rule that one must only ever post under one name. So as a dash and stab sort of post was not my intent, but rather that I wished to use the mostly con of internet anonymity to my favor in that if I were taken the very wrong way, or if as I suspected it might end up being an attackable position, I could let the opinion take the heat, leave the discussion as is recommended by the rules and continue to post as myself without worry that my posting an opinion on this topic would follow my name around for the rest of my (probably short after that point) time here. Plus I figured, as Huinesoron pointed out, it would not be hard for those in charge to determine my identity should I post something completely out of keeping with the rules around here, taking advantage of being able to post without naming myself to it&#39;s fullest and most often used extent. And I thank you for allowing me to remain as I wanted rather than outing me before a problem came up if it were going to. Nor did I hide the fact that I was a poster here, albeit a shy one yesterday.<br><br>Was I wrong to post without my name? In this case, most probably. However, while my newbie-shine may be wearing off, I&#39;ve not been around but about a month and a half (Feb 12th), and I do not know people here well enough to have felt comfortable posting in opposition to the creator of the topic and it&#39;s responses at the time under my name. Should I have simply held off as I normally do in that case? Again, most probably, but for some reason I didn&#39;t. But having been stung before by people I know better, and stabbed in the back while by someone who was even at the time insisting we were friends and she looked up to me, I made a choice. And I ask that you please understand, even if it does not excuse, my decision, and accept my apology for it. I&#39;m also sorry I&#39;m awkward and shy (which do play a part) <sup>_<sup>;</sup></sup> And please know that you won&#39;t hear from me again. (The me that is the stated author of this post, not the me that is the boarder signed at the end that is.)<br><br>I now return you to your regularly scheduled discussion.<br><br>As to being or not being gifted, and thus being able to police yourselves vs. parents having to do so, I was going to try to make a similar argument/point as has already been put forth and I think Neshomeh put it well. Also as many have pointed out, the article is rather vague and I too fell victim to taking it at it&#39;s face value rather than realizing that upon a first reading, but my opinion still stands, that parents should be able to censor their children&#39;s reading/games/television when they feel it necessary, and although I didn&#39;t put it very well, I do agree with Pauline in that every child is different, and to a degree no one should tell them how they must parent, making allowances for abuse of the child and/or the child&#39;s abuse of others if they are allowed to run wild. But as Neshomeh said, parents will know their kids best, and so will be able to tailor their censorship of materials to the situations that face them. And since I know Pauline is right about kids sneaking around to do stuff as well the parents then either allow the material, if it was wildly in appropriate to teach them they should listen when they are told something is not allowed for reasons given. Or since they were involved enough in the first place to try to censor it, to appropriately disciple when the kid ignores the rules. Point is I still believe parents should have the right to speak up to schools and request certain materials or activities be removed or changed if they believe them to be harmful to the students, in this case mental, well being. Just as they can chose to not allow those subjects in their homes. And when enough parents are upset about the subject matter, as seemed to be the case in this story, then the school should re-evaluate the matter and either explain more to the parents, in the case of a knee jerk reaction as could surround a discussion about zombies considering most zombie games/movies can be fairly gory, and like Huinesoron pointed out, give kids a subject like that and you may get wholesome learning, and then someone steps up who is into all that gore and scars the rest of the class, yes we hope the teacher catches it, but what if they&#39;re not writing at school, what if it&#39;s a homework assignment that is not pre-read? And if the parents are still concerned the school can remove or change it. Such as in this case, you could still do a course centered around survival preparation and leave zombies out of it. Shipwreck them, spaceship wreck them on another similar planet, have an apocalypse scenario that doesn&#39;t involve zombies. It doesn&#39;t have to be zombies or quiet reading time. :)<br><br>And since I seem to have either most offended VixenMage, or at least they were the ones that spoke up about it, I apologize again.<br><br><i>I must admit, this made me raise my eyebrows. For every kid you can name who &quot;runs wild and destroys things&quot; because their parents haven&#39;t &quot;sheltered&quot; them enough, I&#39;m sure I could name you a kid who goes wild and destroys things because their parents are controlling - or we could both admit that there are a lot of factors in the behavior of children and young adults, and anecdotal evidence doesn&#39;t really prove the point.</i><br><br>Here, I will admit you&#39;re right, I overgeneralized, or let the rant take over and yes lack of censorship is not always the cause of this, and yes, there are just as many perhaps that do so as a result of over controlling. The flip side being that for every kid I can name that &quot;runs wild and destroys things&quot; due to parents letting them get away with doing/reading/watching/playing anything they want, or was too controlling. There are probably just as many who are more like Pauline and her friends who receive less controlling in the material they are allowed because they are able to police themselves better than others, either due to higher intelligence, higher maturity for their age, good upbringing to begin with or some combination of the above. You don&#39;t ever really hear about the good kids, because... well they&#39;re good and don&#39;t cause trouble. So I do apologize for my over-generalization in the midst of a rant.<br><br>As for the other issue taken with over generalization on my part;<br><br><i>This, I really do have to take issue with. We have had a lot of kids on the PPC at fourteen or fifteen, and they&#39;re plenty mature enough to understand why they can&#39;t &quot;do what they want.&quot; It&#39;s really quite an assumption to make, and honestly, I don&#39;t really appreciate the stigma you&#39;re putting on every/any 14-15 year olds. Plenty of us grow up faster than that, and it&#39;s pretty harsh to just assume that everyone has the same patterns of life. Some of us learned early why, exactly, doing &quot;whatever you want&quot; was a bad thing precisely because of parental situations.</i><br><br>Here I must disagree, mostly because although it was taken as harsh and directed toward thinking all younger people will act the same because they are younger. It really wasn&#39;t meant that way. I apologize for not being a little clearer on that point so that it wound up offending, but it was less a jab at young people and grouping them altogether in behavior. It was a response to the 14 (or 15) year old poster of this discussion stating she saw little reason for censorship (perhaps just of zombie violence) at any age;<br><br><i>Here&#39;s my view on it: Yeah, there is a certain age where certain things probably should be kept to certain standards. But we can&#39;t really hide our kids from reality forever. Now, if this were a course for first graders, I&#39;d get what the issue is. Sort of.</i><br><br>So I was pointing out that her age probably played a part in her understanding of why censorship can be good. Yes there are people of all ages that still can&#39;t stand to be told, it&#39;s not just teens and children. And yes some younger people mature faster. But in this case, my point was that age was a factor to her argument, not trying to say every teen in general would follow the same behavioral pattern.<br><br>Again I apologize to toes that were stepped on.<br>~Myrddin</p>

            <p>I&#39;m twenty-two. It&#39;s been a fairly long time since my feelings were hurt by discussions about non-specific teenagers. :P<br><br>You are correct in your understanding that the Constitution is aimed at preventing people from creating confusion/drama by jumping between names - it&#39;s there to get people to have a single handle, rather than several confusing ones, and not to prevent people from posting anonymously. There is no &quot;absolute rule&quot; against posting anonymously - the reasons stated were more aimed at explaining why we&#39;d prefer you to just use your own name. I should also mention, I suppose, that it&#39;s not just &quot;those in charge&quot; (quotation marks only because it is important to note that we technically don&#39;t have anyone in charge! Just The Nameless Admin, who is a shadowy figure who only gets involved when things are rally dire) who can figure out who you are - your IP address doesn&#39;t change when your name does, so it&#39;s very easy for just about anyone to match an anon&#39;s IP to that of a regular Boarder&#39;s.<br><br>Thank you for your apology - I was rather more snarky than I intended to be, and I apologize as well for getting aggressive about it. And thank you for returning to the discussion to clarify your points; dialogue is always a good thing!</p>

            <p>Aside from what Tray said about not jumping around names (the main reason for that, IIRC, is because putting on name after name after name is confusing and gets annoying), it puts up a sort of... flashing light, I suppose. When I see someone say &quot;I&#39;m going to post this, but I don&#39;t want to sign my name to it,&quot; my first thought - fair or not - is that it&#39;s going to be something hurtful or offensive that they don&#39;t want to take the blame for, and my second thought is that it&#39;s not offensive, but it&#39;s controversial, and they don&#39;t trust the rest of us not to jump down their throats. I don&#39;t think either of these were your intention, but as someone who places a lot of emphasis on identity, it&#39;s just something I would advise you to be cautious about.<br><br>That said, I would also say that we have a history, in the PPC, a fairly long one, of being able to discuss a lot of difficult, controversial, and emotionally charged topics without losing our cool or attacking one another. That hasn&#39;t <i>always</i> been the case, but I do believe we&#39;re doing pretty well, and I do trust people on the &#39;Board to be mature and respectful. I&#39;ll take this opportunity to remind <i>everyone</i> of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">Constitution&#39;s words on the matter</a>:<br><br><i>5. All respectful opinions that do not attack, insult, or persecute others (see Article 1) are welcome. We encourage respectful, friendly debates here. Should a debate escalate into an argument for any reason, everyone involved should step back and calm down before continuing. ...<br><br>6. Everyone in the PPC Community should be respected as people, regardless of who they are. The opinions of a newbie are just as valid and wanted as those of someone here for four years. ...</i><br><br>There&#39;s more, of course, and I <i>strongly</i> urge everyone to refresh their memory if they ever find themselves wondering &quot;Is this appropriate for the PPC Posting Board?&quot; (Perhaps I needn&#39;t say this, but when you start off by mentioning, offhand, &quot;pet rights&quot; and &quot;who&#39;s allowed to marry who,&quot; I feel it might bear repeating.) But that&#39;s all beside the point! I am interested in what you have to say, here, so I would like to respond to that - I just wanted to get that stuff out of the way first, since it seemed to be merited by the oncoming likelihood of a Serious Discussion<sup>TM</sup>.<br><br>Having seen both sides to the &quot;parental censorship&quot; thing, I would have to agree with you that it&#39;s not a <i>bad</i> thing for parents to keep an eye on the kind of media content their children consume. I also think it&#39;s important for kids to have some independence and choice in their media - my siblings and I were very, very strictly controlled in our media choices, and when we did finally get turned loose at the library without supervision, we made some very, very poor choices (and some good choices! Tamora Pierce, Harry Potter, A Wrinkle in Time<s>, R. A. Salvatore</s>...). So I definitely think there&#39;s something to be said for allowing kids to, so to speak, fall and hurt themselves on bad literature, if only so they know what it is when they see it as adults.<br><br><i>I&#39;ve met children who run wild and destroy things and get into nasty crap because their parents don&#39;t want to do anything to &quot;stifle or censor or shelter&quot; them, they don&#39;t end up well. Or how about the middle-schoolers that show up with guns or kill themselves over a C or a break up because they don&#39;t understand the permanence or seriousness of death due to being inundated with it from a young age rather than sheltered a bit?</i><br><br>I must admit, this made me raise my eyebrows. For every kid you can name who &quot;runs wild and destroys things&quot; because their parents haven&#39;t &quot;sheltered&quot; them enough, I&#39;m sure I could name you a kid who goes wild and destroys things because their parents are controlling - or we could both admit that there are a lot of factors in the behavior of children and young adults, and anecdotal evidence doesn&#39;t really prove the point.<br><br><i>And as for your cases of not understanding censorship, you said you were 14? 15? No one understands why they can&#39;t do what they want at that age, (some people never grow out of it), I know I didn&#39;t.</i><br><br>This, I really do have to take issue with. We have had a lot of kids on the PPC at fourteen or fifteen, and they&#39;re plenty mature enough to understand why they can&#39;t &quot;do what they want.&quot; It&#39;s really quite an assumption to make, and honestly, I don&#39;t really appreciate the stigma you&#39;re putting on every/any 14-15 year olds.

Some of us learned early why, exactly, doing &quot;whatever you want&quot; was a bad thing precisely <i>because</i> of parental situations.<br><br>Basically, I do understand your underlying point - there is a limit to allowing kids to just have unlimited access to the content they want, without supervision. But I think you could stand to tone down the condescension. This response came of as rather heavy-handed, especially in response to someone who is dealing with this issue from the other side of the argument. Please consider, in the future, that we have people of all ages (roughly, over thirteen) on this space - generalizing that &quot;all&quot; people of a certain age are too immature to understand certain things is something I&#39;m not really a fan of.</p>

            <p>I agree. I never swore or rebelled against my parents, even though my Dad swore like a sailor extremely loudly while working with technology. I&#39;m one of the lucky teens who actually like my parents. <br>There is no right parenting style, really. It depends on what works with the kids. But kids aren&#39;t carbon copies of their parents, either. And that&#39;s where the problems start. For someone who&#39;s very loose in a family that&#39;s controlling (like a good friend of mine) then you have problems. On the other hand, if you have a kid who needs parameters in a family that&#39;s very loose like mine, then that can be bad too. The most important thing is communication, and then you can go from there. <br>There&#39;s a good friend of mine I mentioned above, who&#39;s a lot like me. But she and her parents are nothing alike personality wise. They&#39;re very forceful and controlling. And because of who she is, they&#39;re pushing her away. They won&#39;t even let her try to explain. So come her eighteenth birthday, she wants to get as far away from them as she can and never look back. And it&#39;s going to haunt both of them. <br>Good parenting is less a strict set of perimeters and more of a combination of communication, your best judgement, and a dash of knowing how kids tend to work (and being ready to throw that understanding out the window most of the time). At least, in my experience. I would never block my kids&#39; media unless it specifically needed to be done, but that&#39;s just how I work. <br>Thanks for defending me! Fourteen,, by the way. And I think I&#39;m somewhat mature for my age, if a little sheltered. In my defense, I&#39;m working on that.</p>

            <p>&quot;On your anonymity... Honestly, that&#39;s usually kind of frowned upon on the Board.  You may have noticed that we have a &quot;one name per person&quot; rule.  The reason for this is because, well, we do try to be open and honest with each other here!  You don&#39;t have anything to fear from us.  This is a community where we do value everyone&#39;s opinion, provided it&#39;s not openly offensive.  Seriously!  If somebody disagrees with you here, it&#39;s highly unlikely anybody will flame you.  Even when people disagree, the conversation is really quite civil.&quot;</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll admit that my ideas on censorship are pretty radical. But here&#39;s my point- my parents haven&#39;t censored me at all. And I can&#39;t stand violence. I have no desire to read saucy sex scenes. And I&#39;ve never sworn in school. <br>See, maybe I&#39;m wrong and this isn&#39;t the norm, but I&#39;ve heard so many times that a friend of mine wasn&#39;t old enough to watch something. Most of them who don&#39;t take that freedom as far as it can go, or sneak around it big time, have a huge bond with their parents. <br>But the rest of them? They sneak it around. And some of them actually like the stuff and that&#39;s why they do it. But most of them read the saucy sex scenes or the graphic violence because their parents don&#39;t like them reading it. By making it specifically banned, they&#39;re drawing the kid&#39;s attention to it. For a younger kid, this makes it desirable and a curiosity; for the older kids it&#39;s a way to rebel. My friends who don&#39;t but anything around their parents with this stuff were told as really young kids, as well, exactly why they weren&#39;t allowed to read the books. <br>This is possibly because all of us are gifted (and that&#39;s probably part of the problem- hard to censor your first grader when her reading level&#39;s a seventh grade) but we have huge curiosities. I don&#39;t condemn those who censor, though it doesn&#39;t make the greatest amount of sense to me (yeah, I know, wait a few years) but you have to do it the right way and once a kid hits a certain age, it has to stop. <br>What is my opinion on how censoring should go, if it&#39;s done? It&#39;s two very simple rules- A. Don&#39;t tell someone else how to parent, and B. Tell them why in the most age appropriate terms you can without violating your morals. There are several kids out there who are like me- they aren&#39;t censored, and their cool like that. So demanding to take out courses like this or books out of the library simply annoys them and, if it&#39;s one of the few high level books in a school library or high level courses in elementary school, can also hold back other kids education. Thank God no one in my town paid any attention to the level seven books in the library....<br>Second of all, kids are curious. Depends on the kid how much, but that&#39;s kind of their nature. Most of the people I know who censor just say &quot;It&#39;s bad&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s not age appropriate&quot; and that&#39;s not going to do you much good unless you have the most obedient kid on the planet. How about explaining that it&#39;s violence and it would be best to wait until their older, or whatever else works well? <br>I&#39;m saying that unless people explain it, most of the time the kids are going to read it just to satisfy their curiosity, anyway. I satisfied it by reading and asking, and honestly the closest I got to actually wanting to watch the saucy scenes was one rated R movie I thought would be funny (I ended up never wanting to see it again, by the way). My parents may not have censored, but it&#39;s not like they put the books in front of me or actively swore. One of the things I loved about them was from a young age they never treated me as a little kid- they treated me as if I knew what I was doing and was capable. <br>Also, once the kid hits sophmore, freshman year, it&#39;s going to get practically impossible. That&#39;s just due to how high school students are treated and how other parenting methods work as well. If people keep trying to do it, not only is it not the greatest for the kid, they might get bullied if they don&#39;t try to sneak it. <br>And if it&#39;s a gifted kid, the deadline needs to get pushed back. Gifted kids often have higher reading levels and understanding levels- a gifted seventh grader can have the understanding of a freshman or higher, even if they don&#39;t have the knowledge. <br>Sorry, this is turning into another rant, and I definitely would rather discuss this civilly (You should see some political debates at school....). But my point is not many kids naturally want to read the stuff. Censor can be good (and you&#39;re right, sometimes seriously overdone) for a simple barrier, but it can also encourage it, from what I&#39;ve seen. </p>

            <p>That word, &quot;censor,&quot; I do not think it means what you think it means. It&#39;s a rather heavily loaded term, so I think it&#39;s important to clear this up: To censor something is to block it from expressing, so if you were being censored, you&#39;d be prevented from expressing yourself through speech, behavior, and/or other means. That does not appear to be what you&#39;re describing, so perhaps a different term is called for?<br><br>Also, being intellectually gifted does not automatically confer emotional maturity, so just because a smart kid can comprehend the language used to describe adult topics doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re ready to process those topics in a healthy way. Every kid is different, even the smart ones, and in <i>most</i> cases I&#39;d trust parents to know their kid&#39;s limits better than other people. After all, they have (hopefully) been around for the kid&#39;s whole life.<br><br>For some context about where I&#39;m coming from, I was talking at nine months, brought in a toy plesiosaur for &quot;P&quot; week in preschool, and learned the mechanics of where babies come from at about age three and a half, when my mom got pregnant with my little brother. No topic was taboo in my house. I remember having a conversation about AIDS when I was in elementary school, and at first thinking we might be talking about the people who helped out in the cafeteria (it was actually about not being scared of people who are sick).<br><br>I still wasn&#39;t allowed to watch R-rated movies or read books with adult themes intended for adults, even if I was curious about said themes, until I was old enough, because I would have been scared or confused or disgusted, or some combination, and would probably have been traumatized to some degree, and my parents knew that about me. Probably from experience, since no one is perfect—my mom tells the story about the movie <i>Airplane</i> had me freaked out and refusing to eat fish sticks for months when I first saw it, because I was just a kid and didn&#39;t get the dark humor. Oops.<br><br>Come to think of it, I still don&#39;t eat fish sticks, though that could just be a function of growing out of them. Sushi is where it&#39;s at now.<br><br>Anyway, just want to go on record as kid who was bright for my age and who had the emotional maturity of... a kid my age... whose parents managed my media intake appropriately for the most part. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh, supposedly some kind of responsible adult now, with a marriage and taxes and everything.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know if it was adorable. It was part of a set of plastic toys, which Uncle Google has informed me were made by a plastics company called Invicta. The set can be seen here: <a href="http://www.dinosaur-toys-collectors-guide.com/invicta-dinosaurs.html"><a href="http://www.dinosaur-toys-collectors-guide.com/invicta-dinosaurs.html">http://www.dinosaur-toys-collectors-guide.com/invicta-dinosaurs.html</a></a><br><br>I don&#39;t think I had all of them, but it&#39;s pretty darn nostalgic looking at most of them. They all had personalities and relationships—I think the plesiosaur was married to the icthyosaur, or something like that. The dipolodocus and brachiosaur were also a thing, with the cetiosaur being an elder to one of them. I think the iguanodon was the &quot;cool guy.&quot; Not sure about the rest, but that&#39;s enough of that anyway. <sup>_<sup>;<br><br>Anyway,</sup></sup> thanks!

            <p>My brother got obsessed with Dinosaurs when he was about two and I was seven and obsessed with mummies, so yes, by my standards, that plesiosaur was adorable. We didn&#39;t have those exact ones on our side of the pond, but Jurassic Park came out when I was little so there were a lot of plastic dinosaurs to choose from. I also remember when my stuffed animals had those kinds of personalities: I had four beanie-baby cats and they were all sisters.

            <p>Wow! Hello, coincidence! Looking at the years they came out, I guess they might have been hot items when we were little? I have no idea where mine came from, though.

Or I&#39;m just misremembering. *shrug*<br><br>I feel like Megalosaurus wasn&#39;t necessarily a &quot;bad guy&quot; to me. He&#39;s not as rough and scaly as the T-Rex, so obviously he must not be as mean, right? Kid logic! &gt;.&gt;<br><br>Don&#39;t worry, all kids love dinosaurs at some point.

            <p>First off....oops? Sorry, the blocking thing was never really big in either town I&#39;ve lived in, so I wasn&#39;t sure of the exact term. <br>Eh......depends on the kid in question. Giftedness and maturity aren&#39;t completely correlated, I know. But because of the advanced track I&#39;ve seen all of us on at the four school systems I&#39;ve been to, I&#39;ve noticed that my gifted peers tended to mature a bit faster than the others. In my classes, discussions, competent ones about violence and death were commonplace. So I guess it&#39;s more of a personality thing. Or maybe it&#39;s just not a big sample size. I mean, my class has five people in it at the moment, so....<br>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong. Really young kids are going to get nightmares most likely if they go over &quot;R&quot; rated shows. But I doubt even a gifted five year old would want to go to a rated R show of their own accord. It&#39;s not something really talked about in school at that age. I&#39;m talking about middle school here, when most kids are starting to show maturity anyway (key word: starting. MS&#39;s are in no way completely mature). Heck, I don&#39;t even want to see rated &quot;R&quot; shows, and that&#39;s with my upbringing. <br>Besides, I think it&#39;s more discouraging a kid than downright prohibiting. Telling a kid she probably won&#39;t like it because it&#39;s inappropriate for such and such a reason does more to discourage them from doing it than actually prohibiting it. That&#39;s just an observation, but I&#39;m not a child psychologist, or anything. <br>To be honest, I&#39;m in no position to tell someone how to parent. I deal with my own stuff. I really only get annoyed if it&#39;s to the point of ridiculousness or it&#39;s forcing other people how to parent. </p>

            <p>Now that I think about it, you can&#39;t really generalize it for all gifted kids, either. It depends on what kind of gifted you are. When we&#39;re talking about giftedness, we&#39;re usually talking intellectual, but as my G and T teacher *loves* to quote, there&#39;s more than one type. Some kids aren&#39;t very good at reading but are gifted artists. Others are extremely gifted intellectually but not very well versed socially. And some people are a mixture of these. It really just depends on who you&#39;re talking about. <br>When I was talking about gifted, I was talking intellectually and also the gift of emotional maturity beyond an age level. That&#39;s pretty much how I&#39;m classified (that would be a long story about living in a tiny town where all kids my age hated my guts and I only hung out with my parents friends and one of my older sisters, a senior in high school by the time I was three, but let&#39;s continue) as well as artistically gifted. However, I&#39;m also extremely socially awkward, get way to into projects that no one else cares about, can&#39;t throw or catch a ball to save my life, and if you follow Harry Potter, I am a big time Slytherin (I&#39;m not rude! I swear! At least, I don&#39;t think I am.....sometimes I don&#39;t think through things before they come out of my mouth. Did I mention I have all seven overexcitabilities as well?). We all have our own strengths and weaknesses, so if you&#39;re talking a gifted kid, you could easily be talking gifted with numbers or gifted with pottery, but not emotionally. My intellectual giftedness barely touches on numbers (I am in sophmore math as a freshman, but I suck at it), but I&#39;m a good problem solver (despite being really bad at brain teasers and math) and lean towards English.<br>Everyone&#39;s gifted at something, but for some it&#39;s not as prevalent as others, and regular school teachers don&#39;t tend to pay attention to athletic or artistic giftedness unless they&#39;re a music teacher or visual art teacher, or possibly a gym teacher (depending on who you have). And others might be horrible at all of these things, but they have a gift socially, for making people have a brighter day just by being sunny. And that&#39;s not even measurable. <br>I guess I&#39;m saying that since everyone is technically a gifted kid, and they just have to capitalize on it, you can&#39;t really say &quot;gifted, no blocking&quot;. I still don&#39;t believe it should happen, but to be honest I stink socially, so I&#39;ve only hung out with people who haven&#39;t needed it in the first place, even if they had it. <br>It really is all about communication between the parent and the kid as soon as the kid is old enough. Maybe a kid doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s good for them, but the parent is also not them and has probably not the complete idea of what&#39;s going through the child&#39;s head. <br>There is an age, though, where the child is ready to face it or they will anyway. And whether that&#39;s before high school is the job of the parents and child in question to decide. But even in my high school, which is in a fantastic suburb and only for ninth graders, they would face things that parents want to protect them from. <br>Plus, as I&#39;ve mentioned before, no baby is born wanting to watch porn. At least, I&#39;ve never met a three year old who enjoys it yet.  </p>

            <p>My first response to this is agreement that, yeah, parental censorship is getting ridiculous. Middle-schoolers are perfectly capable of handling zombie stories. I don&#39;t know why some parents think that&#39;s not the case - and I&#39;d frankly rather not go into talking about why some parents don&#39;t think kids should read books with violence, because I view said parents rather dimly.<br><br>And as for school being fun, that is the best way to make sure someone remembers something! I can still tell you about books I read in elementary school because they entertained me (heck, I think I can even quote a few I only read the once when I was ten). Worksheets and such are fine and dandy for homework or quick in-class assignments, and it&#39;s rather hard to make subjects like math fun once you reach a certain point, but if a class is boring, the students won&#39;t get as much out of it as they would a fun class.<br><br>And...huh. You&#39;ve reminded me of a certain grudge I have against Health classes, namely, that they don&#39;t teach students anything new and should be cut from curriculums altogether. (I learned more from my older friends than I ever did from my Health class, and I point-blank refused to do some of the self-confidence assignments my Health class assigned because they only made me feel worse about myself.) Seriously, my Health classes did nothing to prepare me for the real world. Everything I know about drugs, mental illnesses, and sex, I learned online or from older friends.<br><br>I have the feeling I got off-track somewhere in there, but I dunno. Blegh, Ima stop there.</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m definitely with you on the censorship thing. My curriculum (homeschool, little bit of private schooling) has been pretty uncensored, and I&#39;ve read some textbooks that I don&#39;t think would get past public school censors, and I&#39;m not TOO weird. Actually,that might explain a lot. </p>

And I&#39;m probably just tired; Agent Dawn is coming out tired and annoyed (although that does suit her situation) rather than bouncy and insane in the OFU.

            <p>I hope Charlie and Brenda&#39;s CAD acts like that in the official version of this mission. There should always be somebody around when things get a little nutty to say &quot;Are you kidding me?&quot;, and since the CAD is a world-weary, usually-abused piece of nigh-omnipresent PPC technology, it&#39;s in a unique position for that role.

            <p>You&#39;ve made me grin; congrats :) Also, thanks--this was quite nice to wake up to.<br><br>Technically, anything&#39;s possible, but the current plan is that that bit of Charlie&#39;s CAD&#39;s personality is always there in reserve, just in case it&#39;s needed. On the other hand, it may end up making an appearance if they spend too much time fighting, at some point; who knows? As for Edgar&#39;s CAD, well, both it and his console are obsessed with Monty Python, and they tend to communicate through quotes...and while I&#39;m not entirely sure why &quot;It&#39;s only a model!&quot; was thrown in there (besides the fact that the Camelot Song is hilarious), I&#39;m glad it made you laugh :)<br><br>Heh, well, I guess now I know what to improve for the real mission! I&#39;m glad you&#39;re looking forward to it; I am too, actually--I like what I have so far, and I want to know what the finished version will look like! As for Edgar...he&#39;s not actually supposed to show up, but...again, you never know. Alternatively, the CAD may threaten to call in back-up, but not actually do it...and the &quot;Assassins sound like criminals&quot; (well, they <i>do</i>) could always take place at a later date, possibly with Agent Dawn, who would turn it into a mess of <i>Supernatural</i> jokes...*sigh* (Really, keeping the word &#39;gank&#39; out of this was a test of will. If Dawn had been there, it would have gone in.) I suppose we&#39;ll see.<br><br>*sighs again* Oh, I did that. It&#39;s not loading in both Google Chrome and Internet Explorer. No, I just need to restart the computer; I haven&#39;t done that in long enough that it&#39;s affecting things. I&#39;ll do that pretty soon, though (and then we get character pages and proper announcement of the mission and yay). Thanks for the advice, though :)<br><br>(It is kind of fun, and it&#39;s funny to me that I&#39;m technically on the next day and it&#39;s still there. I wonder if it&#39;s just switched back, since it&#39;s gone a minute past midnight in the time zone the Board uses? I guess I&#39;ll find out when I post this.)<br><br>(Also, foreshadowing...? Oh dear. I may take that idea and run away with it...)<br><br>Thanks for the long review! :D<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Oh, are you the one who reported her? Thank you. She&#39;s making a good first mission (two chapters, classic Sue, what more do you need?) and has provided me with the most awesomely named mini-Balrog ever (namely, hobbition. Love it. Keeping it. Making <i>Supernatural</i> jokes with it.) Quite fun, and it&#39;s simple/short enough that I can use it to develop the agents&#39; personality and working relationship (because, quite frankly, they currently hate each other. Or at least, Brenda hates Charlie.)<br><br>I reread it, and was kind of surprised at how plausible most of it actually is as a PPC mission. Considering that I wrote it at odd hours and in spare moments over four days, and did my sort-of best to make it crazy...well, I suppose I know what to do if I ever want to finish a mission quickly! It looks like I could write it like this, and then go back over it several times to add in bits that I missed (such as what they did with the horse), as well as some text from the actual badfic...hm.<br><br>Well, hope you like the other version of this mission too (once I finish it and get it up...)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

Well, it is fun to do :) The mission I&#39;m working on doesn&#39;t start that way (due to the necessity of some backstory), but the mentioned first mission--the longfic where Charlie and Brenda met Edgar--does, both because I like to shake things up and it struck me as amusing.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>&quot;Aye then,&quot; said Gaspard. &quot;I can understand that. Besides, who wouldn&#39;t want to stare at this scenery all day long... hey, over there! What&#39;s that?&quot;<br><br>Far off in the distance, right next to the river, a man dressed in black erupted from the ground. He rocketed skywards, limbs flailing and all, then fell and landed belly-first into the water with a slapping sound audible all the way from the oak hill. Out from that same hole in the ground swarmed a pack of MLP-verse Timberwolves. The animals gathered around the river, watched the man stagger out of it on the opposite bank, then started to spread up and down stream, searching for a way to cross.<br><br>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s just fantastic,&quot; grumbled Gaspard, who was already halfway up the oak. &quot;I&#39;m not getting paid enough for this.&quot;</p>

            <p>The lights in the Generic Hallway went out one by one. <br><br>Gaspard, who was on his way home, stopped and peered into the distance. Following the time-honoured horror trope, the lights in the back shut themselves off first, then the ones closer to him, and closer, and closer until a curtain of darkness was sweeping forward. <br><br>The spy dove his hands into his Adventure Pouch and pulled a stack of Minecraft torches from it. He stabbed them into the wall and ground surrounding him, creating a little island of light in the now pitch-dark corridor. He plastered himself against the wall and fumbled in his Pouch for his RA. The agent knew where this was going: this was a classic horror setup. He wasn’t going to become one of those stupid genre-blind victims who would blunder off into the dark with only a flashlight and calling out for monsters to eat them. No, he was going to portal to somewhere nice and sunny until Maintenance fixed whatever was going on here. His eye twitched. Hang on a moment: didn’t a power outage in the past lead to some sort of big Emergency or the other? <br><br>Time to go, then.<br><br>Gaspard pulled out the calculator-like device and frantically keyed in a code for a little beach in Cuba. The RA beeped and displayed an error message: [Error. Portal generator inactive. Contact DoSAT for assistance.]<br><br>“Fantastic,” he grumbled, stowing the RA. “Stuck in HQ with the power out. Damn, damn, damn. Next plan, then.”<br><br>He pulled his DORKS from his Pouch and set the code for a HEV suit. Retreat to the RC, light everything up with torches, wait it out. Yes. That was good. Small space, easily defendable, choke point. Booby-trap the door, set up motion sensors.<br><br>The Kostume System, currently disguised as a packet of instant noodles, flared to life with a sci-fi twanging noise. Seconds later, a heavily armoured Gaspard was shuffling forward down the corridor, placing torches on the wall as he went. If he was going to be blundering around in the dark, he was going to do it silently and wearing several centimetres of energy-shielded bulletproof material. <br></p>

            <p>&quot;Listen, if I knew what was going on, Ian, we wouldn&#39;t be stumbling &#39;round in the dark, now would we?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, no, but seriously, how the hell can <i>all</i> the lights go out at once?&quot;<br><br>There was a soft snort and then a heavily implied shrug from the first speaker. &quot;It&#39;s HQ. Logic is kind of non-existent here,&quot; she said. &quot;Look, hold still for a second.&quot; There was rustling and then the soft glow of magical lights that began to hover about five feet high in the air. &quot;Much better. Grandad Nate taught me how to make these.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nice, Lee,&quot; Ian said approvingly, poking gently at one of the floating cubes of clear crystal; there were six in total, and each glowed with a soft blue-white inner light. <br><br>&quot;Hey, wait a minute... Are those <i>torches</i>?&quot;</p>

            <p>Gaspard ducked into a nearby RC&#39;s doorway. He was <i>sure</i> that someone was making sound back there. A lesson he learnt from long hours of spelunking in Minecraft was that, in a cave, any noise that wasn&#39;t water preceded a Very Bad Thing (and the complete absence of sound was a surefire sign that a Creeper was about to explode behind you).<br><br>He pulled a mirror from his Pouch and angled it so that he could look down the hallway. Two figures were standing at the end of the corridor and were busy looking at the line of torches he had placed on the wall. Oh. Good. Agents. Friendlies. False alarm. Good. Must stop being paranoid. Yes. Healthier that way. Hm.<br><br>It was then he noticed the texture of the doorway: Minecraft stone. There was a vein of coal in the wall opposite him. The light fixtures above were actually redstone-powered lamps. This section of HQ was in a cave. <br><br>A dark cave. Dark as in &quot;could spawn monsters&quot; dark.<br><br>A split second after his realization, a what looked like a four-legged pixel-camo-patterned cactus slithered silently out of the darkness, headed straight for the agent. <br><br>&quot;CREEPER! RUN!&quot; shrieked Gaspard has he tore back up the corridor with the monster in slow but steady pursuit. <br><br>- - - <br><br><i>I should build a replica of HQ in Minecraft.<br><br>SeaTurtle</i></p>

            <p>I actually haven&#39;t gotten the spatial-loop corridor to work yet - the portal out of the Nether ended up in another corridor entirely.<br><br>But the &#39;and then&#39; is my plan for after it&#39;s finished.

            <p>&quot;These look like Minecraft torches,&quot; Ian was saying. <br><br>&quot;Handy. We&#39;ll have to pick up some of these when--&quot; Lee broke off when she heard Gaspard&#39;s cry of alarm, turning on the spot. &quot;Wait, what?&quot;<br><br>Ian, having caught on more rapidly than his partner (she&#39;d never played Minecraft; Ian was a regular on the patchwork in-house server someone had managed to set up), grabbed hold of her wrist and pulled. The lights followed them, illuminating their way. &quot;Move move <i>move</i>, he yelped, starting to run. &quot;If there&#39;s one there&#39;s almost always more. Or a spider, a skeleton, a zombie... Just... Run.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can we kill it?&quot; Lee asked, easily falling into the steady ground-eating lope she&#39;d learned in her days as a police-mage; she could keep it up for quite some time, given her naturally high stamina. &quot;I could hit it with some magic. Would that work?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ian panted. &quot;It might just make it worse. Wait, here-&quot; He pulled her into a short branching hallway, shoving her down it before heading back to the entrance and waiting, poised to grab Gaspard as soon as he passed. While he did that, Lee noticed that the walls were made of an odd pale stone that looked almost like cobblestone, marked and pitted. Well, if cobblestone was roughly the shade of eggshells and twice as hard</p>

            <p>...as he careened forward, checking doorways for anything that might spring out from an empty RC. The creeper had gone, disappearing off into an RC with an open door. That didn&#39;t make the agent more comfortable: there was always one more you didn&#39;t see. A skeleton in the corner, a zombie horde that falls through a seemingly empty shaft, a spider on the ceiling...<br><br>A spider on the ceiling. Look up! <br><br>Gaspard sidestepped but was not fast enough to prevent a huge black spider from dropping directly on his head. The monster flailed about, trying to sink its hairy fangs something soft. Luckily for Gaspard, he was hearing a HEV suit. Unfortunately for him, it didn&#39;t come with a helmet. The spy raised his arms to protect his face, and saw a tall man further up ahead guide his partner around a corner and turn to face him. <br><br>&quot;Get it off!&quot; yelled Gaspard, stumbling forward the agent with the spider scrabbling all over his head.<br><br>Just about then, the creeper popped out of an adjacent doorway and started hissing like a fuse. As Gaspard&#39;s momentum carried him past the explosive monster, the only word he could manage was: &quot;Really?&quot;<br><br>Light. <br><br>Flight.<br><br>Air whistling past. Sound, lots of it. Spider still clamped on his face like the world&#39;s ugliest and most murderous hat. <br><br>Touchdown. Bounce off the ground, spider absorbing a good deal of the impact. It came off, hopefully dead.<br><br>Second impact. Something cracked. Gaspard hoped it was just the HEV. Slid face down. Friction against his cheek. <br><br>Everything stopped moving. <br><br>From where he was lying, Gaspard could make out a white wall with a dimpled texture. End Stone. How unusual. Did he explode so hard he got blasted into another dimension? There was a woman staring at him. Did she explode too? The agent rolled onto his back and beheld Agent Ian. <br><br>&quot;Excuse me sir,&quot; Gaspard wheezed. &quot;Do you have a medkit to spare?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Here, I can help,&quot; Lee said, stepping forward. She gathered her magic to her, laying one hand flat on the End Stone that made up the floor and the other gently against Gaspard&#39;s forehead. Lee directed the healing magic through the spy, allowing the cool sensation to flow from the stone, through her, and into Gaspard, searching out any wounds and hopefully mending them. <br><br>Meanwhile, Ian went to investigate the spider, checking to see if it was, in fact, truly dead. He nudged the hairy body with one reenforced toe of his boot, jumping back when it twitched, its mandibles clicking weakly. Instantly, Ian jumped into action, pulling a cue from Isaac Clarke of <i>Dead Space</i> fame and stomping heavily on the spider&#39;s head. Several times. With a lot of force.<br><br>Once he was satisfied that the spider was, in fact dead (the body fading, leaving only a squishy looking red eye, was a pretty good sign), Ian turned his attention back to Lee and Gaspard. Lee had sat back, hands folded in her lap, as she observed Gaspard. The End Stone where she&#39;d placed her hand was cracked and faded, an odd occurrence, given the stone&#39;s natural high durability.</p>

He turned to Lee. &quot;Many thanks, ma&#39;am,&quot; flashing her a smile.<br><br>The spy stood up, leaning against the wall to catch his breath. &quot;Okay. So, monsters in the halls. Note to self, complain to Upstairs for ignoring a source of infinite light in favour of the technologically vulnerable redstone lamp. Right.

            <p>Dawn was quite happily watching the latest episode of <i>Supernatural</i> and ignoring the world, while Kelaborn and Gladladriel crunch-sizzled eggs in the middle of RC 18 and the tribble (still unnamed; she would have to think of something) trilled softly on its shelf. She hadn&#39;t noticed the black-out, and the screams coming from outside her door (left open through the will of the Ironic Overpower) blended perfectly into the soundtrack of screaming demons on the console&#39;s screen. She didn&#39;t even notice when the two mini-Balrogs straightened defensively and the tribble stopped trilling and started to shake. She did notice when a stack of books crash-thudded to the floor, though.<br><br>&quot;Hey!&quot; she said, hitting the pause button and turning around. &quot;Knock it o--&quot;<br><br>There are really very few courses of action when coming face to...more or less face with a hissing, grey-green, vaguely humanoid <i>thing</i>, and Dawn took the one that didn&#39;t involve the sharp weapons that weren&#39;t within her reach: she screamed, and frantically slapped at the console&#39;s buttons, creating a portal.<br><br>Unfortunately, the portal that opened was positioned directly in front of the console&#39;s screen; and instead of Dawn being able to grab the tribble and retreat through it, followed by the roaring mini-Balrogs, the portal flickered and disgorged two Hunters, a demon, and an angel of the Lord.<br><br>That is to say, they fell on Dawn.<br><br>Dawn was silent, due to having the breath rather forcibly knocked from her lungs. The tribble...stared, presumably. The mini-Balrogs stole quick glances backwards, assessed the threat level, recognized canon characters, and turned their attention back to the creature that had invaded their RC. Even the creature paused in its hissing, startled by the four suddenly-appearing people.<br><br>Sam looked up first. &quot;Crap! Dean--&quot;<br><br>Dean winced, and tried to shove Castiel off him. The angel went, looking rather puzzled. Then Dean looked up.<br><br>&quot;What the--&quot;<br><br>Meg got to her feet and tugged her jacket straight. &quot;Well, this is nice and geeky,&quot; she said, and shifted backwards. &quot;Guys? I think maybe we should run.&quot;<br><br>Finally free of all the unexpected people on her back, Dawn coughed and struggled to her feet. Wavering, she looked round at her accidental visitors (and nearly fell over doing so), and then swayed back around to look at the creature. &quot;What are you and what are you doing in my RC?&quot; she asked hoarsely.<br><br>The creature hissed. The minis hissed back. The creature contemplated them curiously.<br><br>&quot;Uh,&quot; Sam said. &quot;If that&#39;s what I think it is...we should probably get out of here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why, what will it do?&quot; Castiel asked.<br><br>Sam coughed. &quot;Explode,&quot; he replied, and tried to ignore Dean&#39;s look.<br><br>&quot;Seriously?&quot; Dean said. &quot;Could you be any more of a geek?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey. Canon characters. Quiet. You, exploding hissy thing--get out of my RC!&quot;<br><br>The &#39;exploding hissy thing&#39; shuffled closer, and hissed louder.<br><br>&quot;Oh no,&quot; Sam said, and three of the four canon characters backed up. Cas remained where he was, contemplating the creature. &quot;It&#39;s going to--&quot;<br><br><i>--Meanwhile, back at the Board...--</i><br><br>DawnFire was writing a note, in parentheses. [I don&#39;t actually know anything about Minecraft,] it read, [beyond what I just read on the Minecraft wiki. But you did mention an open RC, so...I had to. Really.]<br><br>She paused, thinking, and then added, [Dawn&#39;s going to kill me for this, by the way. If she isn&#39;t too distracted by the canon characters, that is. I&#39;ll have to do a lot of groveling if her RC gets exploded, though. That won&#39;t be fun.] She paused, and thought some more, then sighed. &quot;I suppose I&#39;d better not let her RC get exploded, then...&quot; She sighed again, laid her fingers on the keyboard, and began to type.<br><br>--<br>((Yup, I know nothing about Minecraft. And no, I couldn&#39;t resist. And also, I haven&#39;t actually finished watching &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot;, so please, no one spoil it for me.<br>((And yes, I&#39;ve just smashed the fourth wall to smithereens and stomped on it.

You have been warned.]<br><br>[And, with that said...]<br><br>The Road So Far<br><br>Dawn was watching <i>Supernatural</i> when a creeper entered her RC. After being made aware of its presence, she frantically opened a portal, which malfunctioned and brought Sam, Dean, Cas, and Meg through into PPC HQ. Sam recognized the creeper as, well, a creeper...<br><br>&quot;Oh no,&quot; Sam said, and three of the four canon characters backed up. Cas remained where he was, contemplating the creature. &quot;It&#39;s going to--&quot;<br><br><i>Now</i><br><br>DawnFire&#39;s fingers tapped frantically on her laptop&#39;s keys. She had just finished reading the replies to her first post, and had managed to come up with a desperate idea. Now she only had to put it into practice...<br><br><i>PPC HQ: RC 18</i><br><br>&quot;Cats,&quot; Castiel said thoughtfully, and the plotholes opened.<br><br><i>&quot;Good,&quot; DawnFire mumbled. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry for taking advantage of that canonical fact that you can have a conversation without seeming to leave, but it had to be done.&quot; She paused, considering this. &quot;Oh, great. I&#39;m the villain. Or at least a misguided protagonist. Wonderful.&quot;</i><br><br>Sam, Dean, Meg, and Dawn shifted backwards, startled by the sudden change in the RC&#39;s inhabitants. Castiel, of course, barely blinked, staring at the creeper.<br><br>&quot;RUMBLEROAR!&quot; snarled a huge lion with an old man riding on its back. Beside Rumbleroar, several animated lions stared at their suddenly changed surroundings, and quickly checked to make sure their cubs were unharmed. A twelve-year-old Hermione Granger screamed, and tried desperately to cover her currently cat-like face once she realized there were people around. Castiel stood still, smiling slightly, as more and more cats of all shapes, sizes, and breeds slipped through the plotholes. Nanny Ogg&#39;s Greebo hissed, spotted the mini-Balrogs, and hissed louder. Morwen&#39;s cats stared meaningfully at the creeper, which was frantically swiveling its head back and forth, trying to keep all the cats in view. Bagheera padded through another plothole, and was rather startled to find the jungle gone. The cat Castiel had once interrogated made its appearance, glaring at the angel. The Doctor, currently in another part of PPC HQ dealing with a Weeping Angel, would have been interested to know that several cat-nuns and the cat he had talked to in Craig&#39;s flat had just made their appearance in RC 18, a number of corridors and several dimensions away.<br><br>Speaking of RC 18, it was getting quite crowded. In fact, the only open space was swiftly becoming a direct path to the open door.<br><br>The creeper shivered. Its blocky head swiveled from side to side, from cat to cat. The smaller cats scared it; the cat-nuns and Hermione terrified it. The larger cats were enough to send it running for the hills of New Caledonia. And that was before Benvenuto and Vittoria scrambled through another plothole and hissed at it.<br><br>Faced with the boss cats of the Casas Montana and Petrocchi, who had chased the White Devil from Caprona, as well as all the other cats of assorted breeds and sizes, the creeper stopped hissing, turned, and ran. Most of the cats ran after it, yowling, hissing, spitting, snarling, and roaring. Rumbleroar&#39;s cry rose above the others, accompanied by Dumbledore yelling, &quot;After it! After it! We&#39;re gonna get that green thing and drown it in the Hogwarts swimming pool!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Alright,&quot; Dawn said, once the chaos had cleared enough for her to be heard. &quot;What was that thing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh, a creeper,&quot; Sam replied. &quot;It&#39;s...from Minecraft--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dude, you are <i>such</i> a nerd,&quot; Dean said, and sat down in Dawn&#39;s chair. &quot;Where are we, anyway?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No idea, but I&#39;d like to leave,&quot; Meg said. Sam and Dean exchanged looks. Then Sam thought of something, and frowned.<br><br>&quot;Cas, how&#39;d you know creepers are afraid of cats?&quot; He paused, considering his last sentence, and shook his head. &quot;Our lives are so weird. What&#39;s next, Daleks?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Several of our best agents are Daleks,&quot; Dawn said absentmindedly. &quot;Uh, Cas? Castiel? Are you, um, planning on moving any time soon?&quot;<br><br>&quot;W-what&#39;s going on?&quot; Hermione quavered. &quot;I--what is this place? How did I get here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Did you just say some of your best agents are Daleks?&quot; Sam asked. &quot;Wait, what type of agents are we talking about? There&#39;s no way this is a police force--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Cas?&quot; Dean got up and walked over to the angel. &quot;Hey, man, you alright?&quot;<br><br>Castiel turned, and grinned broadly. &quot;Well, maybe. I think so. Did you see all those cats? I mean, not all of them were cats, but they could have been. I was thinking, actually, what makes a cat? I mean, was the creeper afraid of the tail, or the whiskers? Or was it the fur? I mean, I don&#39;t find fur very scary, but then again, I&#39;m an angel. Do you find fur scary, Dean?&quot; He stared at the human, head tilted to one side, blue eyes intent and that same, awful, un-Cas-like smile on his face.<br><br>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Meg said. &quot;Here we go again.&quot;<br><br>Dean stared. &quot;You have got to be kidding me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course,&quot; said the angel, &quot;if it&#39;s the fur they&#39;re afraid of, then a dog should scare them just as much as a cat. But I was specifically told cats. I wonder why some cats are bigger than others...&quot;<br><br>Sam groaned. &quot;Great. Just great. Cas, this isn&#39;t just a--a practical joke, or something, is it?&quot;<br><br><i>In a Room at the Board</i><br><br>DawnFire stared at her screen, nonplussed. &quot;What--hold on, why&#39;s he gone back to being mentally unstable? I thought that went away when he came back from Purgatory. Why&#39;s it happening again?&quot;<br><br>She reached out a hand to pat her first tribble, which purred. In its fireproofed corner, the mini-Balrog looked up questioningly.<br><br>&quot;And--and I didn&#39;t even mean to write that,&quot; DawnFire added, mostly to herself. &quot;He was going to turn around and apologize, he was just being quiet because he was concentrating on sending the cats home, or something. How&#39;d he even--?&quot; She stopped. &quot;Oh no. No, no, no...&quot;<br><br>She checked the screen, and found that several more lines had typed themselves while she was talking. &quot;No! You&#39;ve got to be kidding me. Since when do stories write themselves to this extent?&quot;<br><br>The tribble purred. DawnFire positioned her fingers on the keys of her laptop, and jerked them away as something stung them. Cautiously, she tried again, and was relieved when no shock followed; when she tried to lift one hand to move the tribble away from her tea, she discovered that her hands refused to move any farther off the keyboard than it took to reach the rest of the keys and the touchpad.<br><br>&quot;Aah!&quot; she squeaked, and tried frantically to free her fingers, with no success. As she watched, they began to type, guided by an unseen force. &quot;No! Nonononono! Help!&quot;<br><br>She tried to stop typing and failed. Attempting to reach her email, she found that her fingers refused to comply. The story just kept writing.<br><br><i>RC 18</i><br><br>Dawn frowned as she watched the chaos that had taken over her RC. &quot;DawnFire?&quot; she said. &quot;What&#39;s going on? And why can&#39;t I turn on the lights?&quot;<br><br>As if in answer, a portal flickered open and dropped a young woman with light brown hair into the abandoned chair. She shrieked in surprise, and then stared at her fingers.<br><br>&quot;What--&quot; The newcomer wiggled her fingers, and grinned. &quot;Yes! I&#39;m free!&quot;<br><br>Sam and Dean eyed her warily, ready for a fight. Meg glanced at Castiel, who was eyeing the newcomer over Dean&#39;s shoulder. Hermione backed away, wishing she had her wand with her. Dawn stared, and then walked cautiously closer.<br><br>&quot;DawnFire?&quot; she asked. &quot;Is that you?&quot;<br><br>DawnFire blinked. &quot;Wha--Dawn? Why am I--&quot; she caught sight of the canon characters and froze, gaping.<br><br>Dawn sighed. &quot;DawnFire, focus. What&#39;s going on? Why are you here? Actually, just what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br><br>DawnFire managed to drag her eyes back to the shadowy figure of the Assassin, and sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t really know. I mean, we&#39;ve had a blackout, at the Board, I mean, only now it&#39;s at the PPC--there&#39;s a great interlude going on, it&#39;s really hila--&quot; She stopped, and went pale, although no one could really tell in the dark. &quot;That&#39;s it. I&#39;m in PPC HQ, and Slorp is roaming the hallways.&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;Slorp&#39;?&quot; Sam asked, eyebrows raised. &quot;What&#39;s &#39;Slorp&#39;?&quot; He pronounced the word as though he wasn&#39;t quite sure it was what he was supposed to be saying.<br><br>&quot;Uhhh,&quot; said DawnFire, blinking several times in an attempt to keep her mind clear. &quot;Um. Slorp. Right. Meatloaf monster from the Cafeteria. The Doctor&#39;s dealing with it. Not sure if it&#39;s eaten an Angel yet or not, though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wait,&quot; Dean said. &quot;We&#39;re dealing with a <i>meatloaf monster</i> that runs around eating <i>angels</i>?&quot; He glanced at Sam, and then at Cas...who wasn&#39;t there. &quot;Cas? Cas!&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s alright, it eats a Weeping Angel, not an angel-angel,&quot; DawnFire said hurriedly. Sam stared at her.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re dealing with <i>Weeping Angels</i> now, too?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, the Doctor is--&quot; DawnFire began, and was interrupted by Dawn.<br><br>&quot;DawnFire, you&#39;re going to have to tell me everything about this interlude, and we&#39;ve got to find Cas. And get all the cats back where they belong. And Hermione. And Dumbledore.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ok, <i>what</i>?&quot; Sam said.<br><br>Meg&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;So basically, we have cats from all over the place running around here, as well as a meatloaf with a taste for angels, and my unicorn&#39;s run away. And who knows what other dangers there are in this place, whatever it even is.&quot; She smirked. &quot;What the hell. Let&#39;s save the day. Sounds like fun.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I still don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re here,&quot; Dawn said. She was unusually intent, most signs of insanity pushed to the side.<br><br>DawnFire sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t actually know. The plotholes aren&#39;t supposed to be stabilizing--maybe it&#39;s because Cas opened so many that worked, I think he might have stabilized the room instead of each individual plothole? As for why I&#39;m here, it&#39;s...not a good story. I was typing, and then I couldn&#39;t stop, and then the story started writing itself, and I&#39;d nearly managed to contact Karen when the plothole dumped me here.&quot; She tried to smile. &quot;So, are we saving the day, then?&quot;<br><br><i>To be continued!</i><br><br>--<br>[I couldn&#39;t quite decide which cat to bring in. Then, I decided to just bring in all of them. Virtual cookies to you if you know where all the cats are from. Also, Meg is extremely hard to write, at least in terms of facial expressions. I mean, I can see her move in my head, but getting that into words...pretty difficult.]<br><br>[Also, this is technically my first time writing for <i>Supernatural</i>, unless I&#39;ve forgotten something. So, if you spot any OOCness, feel free to let me know and I&#39;ll deal with it. Thanks!]<br><br>[Oh, and, uh, I think this is becoming an interlude in its own right. Once it&#39;s finished, I&#39;ll probably clean it up and post it on livejournal.]<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Creepers are deathly afraid of cats! It&#39;ll leave, and you can neuralize/glomp the canons without as large a problem! <br>Of course, there probably are no cats nearby, but a meta-entity such as Agent Dawn will probably be able to approximate. Possibly.<br><br>I say &quot;without as large a problem&quot; rather than &quot;no problem&quot; because dimensional junctures have dropped Minecraft creatures and geographical features into HQ&#39;s null zone, and the DMFF and DES will probably need to disentangle the foreign continuum before block-headed fireproof ghosts start swarming the cafeteria.<br><br>A Creeper drenched in water will be unable to damage its surroundings when it goes off, but I don&#39;t know where you&#39;d be able to get that much water at short notice.<br>Maybe if the tribble undergoes parthenogenesis, the Creeper will mistake the spawned young for cats... no, tribbles look nothing like cats. They don&#39;t have heads. Some have cat-like fur patterns, though. Maybe you can make it work...<br><br>On another note, I have a suggestion for the tribble&#39;s name, but I don&#39;t know if you would get the reference. Have you ever read Chasing the Moon?</p>

            <p>... so I suppose a tiger would work just as well. There were tigers in the animated Disney universe, the Marvel Universe, and the His Dark Materials universe, just to name a few from the top of my head. I think Narnia had a tiger that could talk, too, though I&#39;m not sure about that one.  Plus, there&#39;s a tiger named Raksha in RC 481,516,234,277, but that number would take too long to type in and her owner would probably blow her stack if you sent Raksha halfway across HQ to ward off a creature known to be explosive, so that&#39;s out.<br>Actually, this might not be as complicated as I&#39;m making it. I suppose most World One variants would have some form of large cat. At least a leopard or a lion or some similar creature.<br><br>I don&#39;t think you should involve alternate-reality selves in this. If the cat-disguised alt-Brenda and alt-Charlie ever de-disguise before going back to their home timestream, they&#39;d be an ontological hazard. You&#39;d most likely have to keep them as cats until somebody kills the Creeper, for safety&#39;s sake, and you probably shouldn&#39;t keep two of your own characters as cats for longer than they have to be unless they want to or they really deserve it. Plus, the main-world Brenda and Charlie would freak out if they walked into Dawn&#39;s RC and saw their alt-selves(though that assumes the alt-selves would have de-disguised or that the main-world selves would recognize themselves as cats).<br><br>Chasing the Moon is a book by A. Lee Martinez about interdimensional creatures trapped on Earth. It&#39;s a sort-of parody of the &quot;eldritch abomination&quot; stories from Lovecraftian times, but it downplays the &quot;horror&quot; aspect common to those stories significantly and spends most of its time on its (hilarious) characters, especially the monstrous roommates of the human protagonist.<br>The one I was going to name the tribble after is named Smorgaz, who was one of the roommates after about the first fourth of the book. Smorgaz, or Unending Smorgaz if you give him the title he rarely uses, has the ability to create copies of himself, though if he avoids spawning for long enough, copies will bud off even when he isn&#39;t trying to. If he&#39;s not trying, the copies tend to be shrunken nuisances that go around ripping up the carpets, but the copies he makes on purpose can act as other Smorgazes, and even duplicate on their own if they need to.<br><br>Since the tribbles are the most spawning-happy creatures in science fiction and Smorgaz is awesome, I figured he&#39;d be a great tribble namesake.<br><br>The only Greebo I can think of is the mini-Rancor, so you don&#39;t need to worry about spoilers there. It&#39;s a lot easier to conceal things from people if they don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

            <p>&quot;We should probably let them know, just in case,&quot; Ian said as he began walking. &quot;Leaving a hole like that in the middle of a corridor probably isn&#39;t the best idea.&quot;<br><br>Lee nodded in agreement and then smiled at Gaspard&#39;s compliment. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she replied. &quot;That was one of our more tame missions, even with the mini-Discords mucking everything up.&quot; <br><br>As they walked, the Minecraft halls briefly transitioned from End Stone into an area with the more familiar Generic Surface before turning into a passage with dark wooden paneling and creaky floors. Ian sighed.<br><br>&quot;Looks like we&#39;re in some sort of abandoned building,&quot; he said. &quot;What d&#39;you think, horror or video game?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Could be both,&quot; Lee mused, and then poked at the nearest wall. &quot;If it had gas or aetheric lamps, I would&#39;ve said Victorian or steampunk.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Putting Response Centres in abandoned buildings is sure going to boost morale, eh?&quot; quipped Gaspard. &quot;I doubt we&#39;ll find some secure RCs in this corner of HQ: given the current context, jump scares and stuff are probably around the corner. Or above,&quot; he added, remembering the giant spider. <br><br>He studied the surroundings for a moment. &quot;Doesn&#39;t look like anything I&#39;ve seen in my fandoms before, with the possible exception of <i>Amnesia</i>.

            <p>&quot;Run,&quot; Lee said. &quot;I have magic at my disposal, but since we don&#39;t know where we are, I&#39;d rather not accidentally create a bigger mess than what we&#39;re already in.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This might just be a generic horror setting, but the quicker we&#39;re through it, the better,&quot; Ian chimed in, wincing slightly when the boards creaked ominously underfoot. &quot;We&#39;re used to running; we&#39;d probably fit in well in the <i>Doctor Who</i> &#39;verse.&quot; </p>

            <p>&quot;Aye, sir. Let&#39;s hope that we&#39;ll not encountering Whovian nasties. Those are a  nasty piece of work,&quot; said Gaspard. &quot;Besides, I don&#39;t think I can shoot anything for the life of me--&quot;<br><br>But there! Corner of his eye. Movement. A shadow to the left flitting from doorway to doorway, corner to corner. Gaspard clicked on his armoursuit&#39;s flashlights and pointed towards the disturbance.<br><br>&quot;Th-there!&quot; he hissed, voice shaking with terror. &quot;M-movement. Nine o-o&#39;clock. Some b-big th-thing in the a-archway!&quot; The suit-mounted flashlight barely illuminated the area in question. <br><br>There was a statue of an angel under the arch, its face cupped in its hands. Another one was poised behind it, looking straight at the agents with its face twisted into a snarl.<br><br>&quot;Weeping Angels!&quot; squeaked Gaspard, getting ready to bolt. &quot;Can&#39;t move if you keep them in line of sight-- <i>another one behind us!</i> I&#39;ve got him! Do not look at them in the eye! You&#39;ll become one of them. Don&#39;t blink! It gives them enough time to dash forward!&quot;<br><br>Three Angels, three agents, a branching corridor.

            <p>&quot;By the Bright Lady herself,&quot; Lee breathed, eyes wide. She grabbed at Ian&#39;s wrist, searching for a familiar point of stability. &quot;Ian...&quot;<br><br>Ian swore under his breath, wracking his brain as to what to do next. After several tortuous moments, a thought hit him: &quot;Medusa.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>What?</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;Medusa. Mirrors. Lee, can you conjure up any sort of mirrored glass? Would that work? Or maybe one-way mirrors?&quot; Ian asked, doing his best to keep his eyes on the Angel in front of him without blinking or staring it directly in the face. <br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know. Besides, doesn&#39;t the image of an Angel become an Angel itself? Anything reflective would just create more Angels!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think that&#39;s only been recently established. These may be series three-era Angels and not follow the same rules.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How in the nine hells can we tell?&quot; Lee asked, her voice sharp. &quot;They all look the same to me!&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; said Gaspard to try to pull himself together. &quot;Eating habits. If they are the send-back-in-time-to-feed type, we can wait it out until the portal generators are fixed and portal back to HQ. No biggie. If they don&#39;t need us, we&#39;re dead meat. You each have an RA, right-- damn!&quot; <br><br>The HEV suit&#39;s flashlight started to fizzle out. Gaspard quickly pulled a Minecraft torch from his Pouch and placed it on the ground, but the Angel in front of him used the temporary distraction to leap forward, its fingertips now centimetres away from Gaspard&#39;s nose. The spy lept back into the Assassins.<br><br>&quot;Ack! Sorry!! Okay, what do I have...? RA, nope. Earpiece, worthless. What else, what else...

            <p>&quot;We haven&#39;t been on a mission in a day and a half,&quot; Ian told Gaspard, catching his balance. He blinked, and then yelped when the Angel he&#39;d been watching moved forward, and far too close for comfort. &quot;No RA. They&#39;re back in our RC.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What&#39;s this big plan of yours?&quot; Lee asked, her grip on Ian&#39;s wrist tightening. &quot;My eyes are starting to water here, so sooner would be better than later, please.

            <p>&quot;That should help a bit,&quot; said Gaspard, growing more and more excited as he typed in a code into his noodle-pack DORKS while keeping one eye on the Angel in front of him. <br><br>&quot;You see, not many people realize how much power you wield with the Kostume System. It can be used to turn you into a living weapon: a krogan, a protoss, ultralisk, brood lord, you name it. It even does Pokйmon. Here&#39;s the plan: I turn myself into an Espeon-- little psychic fox thing-- and I&#39;ll cast Trick Room which makes slower creatures--us-- move a whole lot faster. Next step, run for our lives. It&#39;s a million-to-one chance, but it just might work,&quot; he added, hoping that Legal was listening. <br><br>&quot;Ready? On three. One, two three!&quot;<br><br>BZORP!<br><br>A couple of seconds later, the world <i>twisted.</i> A little lilac Pokйmon shook its head and dashed down the nearest opening, looking back over its shoulder to see if the two human agents were following.</p>

            <p>A few minutes of frantic running brought the agents to a new section of HQ. Here the walls were more of the familiar Generic Surface sort, complete with scorch marks and sparkly stains on the walls. A quick scan of the his surroundings reassured Gaspard that nothing was chasing him or his companions so he finally came to a stop and spat out the DORKS which he had been carrying in his mouth. <br><br>A quick BZORP! later and he was back to being human again. Gaspard stood up, knees still knocking together. &quot;They told me I was crazy,&quot; he said to no one in particular. &quot;Stupid plans, they said. I&#39;ll never make use of Trick Room, they said. Stop practicing the move, they said.&quot; He pumped both fists in the air, giggling nervously. &quot;Vindication! Wheee-heee-heee-heee!&quot;<br><br>Once he had finished his giggling fit in the corner, he turned to Lee and Ian. &quot;Ah... sorry.

A few green leaves blew in from beyond the frame, landing silently on the Generic Flooring. <br><br>The door opened on a grassy hilltop dominated by a single oak tree. A gravel path wound around the tree and meandered away into the distance, skirting a river and a man-made forest. The sun was high in the sky, indicating it was sometime around noon.

He pulled a cylindrical object on a tripod and a handheld monitor from his Pouch, flicked them on, and set them down on the ground beside him. <br><br>&quot;Motion sensor gadget,&quot; explained Gaspard. &quot;It may be sunny here, but you can never be too paranoid.

            <p>Ian and Lee followed after Gaspard, blinking against the bright light that washed over them as they stepped into the Courtyard. Between one breath and the next, Lee had changed back to human, rising elegantly to her feet before taking hold of Ian&#39;s offered hand. They joined Gaspard beneath the tree, taking seats next to one another on one of the other benches.<br><br>&quot;I would love some tea,&quot; Lee said, giving Gaspard a thankful smile. &quot;It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve had any.

            <p>Gaspard pulled an electric kettle, a crumpled cardboard box of tea bags, a canteen, and two mugs from his Pouch. He placed the box and mugs beside him, filled the kettle with the canteen of water, plugged the power cord somewhere inside his pouch of holding (&quot;You have no idea what a pain it was to get that generator in there.&quot;), flicked the power switch, and placed the kettle next to the mugs. <br><br>The agent sat back and looked at the two Assassins holding hands. Feeling a little awkward, he clasped his hands together and stared off into the distance, not sure whether he should start a conversation or not. He eventually picked up the cardboard box and sifted through the tea bag envelopes with an index finger.<br><br>&quot;Right, er...

You patched me up after that Creeper explosion, and I pulled us out of the Weeping Angel corner, so I think that makes us even, so... um. I really-- no, wait. Sorry. What I meant to say was: thanks.

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been here in all my time as an agent.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Really?&quot; Ian looked surprised. &quot;I would&#39;ve thought this would be one of your favorite places to go as an elemental mage, since it&#39;s outside.&quot; He paused. &quot;I think.&quot;<br><br>Lee shrugged, checking her tea. &quot;I&#39;ve never managed to find the place.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;If you don&#39;t mind me asking, ma&#39;am, have you ever been to New Caledonia?&quot; asked Gaspard between sips of tea. &quot;If you haven&#39;t yet, I highly recommend it. The weather over there is pretty nice around this time of the year and there&#39;s some pretty good food over there if you know your way around the city.&quot; The spy leaned against his bench&#39;s back rest, gazing upward into the oak. &quot;Speaking of which, my grandmother keeps on talking about this awesome little ramen shop on Rue Nйnuphar. I&#39;d better check it out next lunch break.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Please, just call me Lee. I&#39;m not much for formalities,&quot; Lee said, trying her tea and humming in pleasure at its taste. &quot;I got way too much of that back home.

            <p>Lee frowned. &quot;I don&#39;t know if it has an actual name or not,&quot; she replied, leaning back in her seat. &quot;All I know is that it&#39;s mine.

It&#39;s a steampunk &#39;verse with magic, though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Picture the <i>His Dark Materials</i> &#39;Verse, but no daemons and more dragons,&quot; Ian said, &quot; add a dash of <i>DMFA</i> &#39;verse cubi clan structures, and then throw in a few gods.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Try a whole pantheon.&quot; Lee shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s complicated.&quot;</p>

            <p>Lee nodded. &quot;My whole House,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#39;re a big family, or at least, those among my age group.

            <p>The Infrastructure Departments are <i>not</i> going to have a good time disentangling yet another random continuum from HQ. Minecraft&#39;s intrusion provided enough extra work. At least that one is big enough and labyrinthine enough naturally to be able to slide in and out of HQ&#39;s null zone comparably easily.<br><br>A continuum like the new one, with actual floors and wood, will take ages to separate! The reason HQ is made of Generic Surface is because Perfectly Generic Material is the only substance capable of keeping itself structured properly in a null zone for extended periods of time. If the wood flooring isn&#39;t separated properly, it could fall into a random spot in the multiverse, leaving huge holes in HQ! Then, the Department of Operations would have to go repair it, and I&#39;m not even sure I want to know how many workers they&#39;d lose while mapping out the structural damage once the holes form.<br><br>This power outage caused an even bigger problem than I thought it would. Once you&#39;re out of the unfamilar area, somebody should really call the Nightshade and the Captain Dandy to get their troops removing the invasive dimensional space before the damage snowballs and HQ ends up colliding into a continuum with sapient life.</p>
