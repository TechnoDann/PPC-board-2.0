            <p>While I do hope you feel better soon, Specs, I think I should remind you that every new thread on the Board pushes an old one off the edge, and after that off the edge of the Internet, permanently.

            <p>[miscellaneous medical trivia soapbox time!]<br><br>&quot;Flu&quot; and &quot;stomach flu&quot; actually are two different things, and in fact, what people call &quot;stomach flu&quot; is not even the flu at all! &quot;Flu&quot; is short for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza">influenza</a>, which is an infection caused by a strain of the influenza virus. It is <i>not</i> generally characterized by vomiting. There are lots of different strains, some more dangerous than othersâ€”you&#39;ve probably heard of some of them. Generally speaking, though, the influenza infection itself is not what kills people, but rather secondary infections like pneumonia that strike while their bodies are weakened. That&#39;s why it&#39;s usually more dangerous to young people and old people, who are already more susceptible to infections.<br><br>So-called stomach flu, on the other hand, is a colloquialism referring to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</a>, which is inflammation of the lining of your stomach and intestines. It can be caused by like a gazillion different things. Food poisoning is indeed one of them. Your body reacts to the inflammation by trying to expel whatever is causing it, and fun times are had by all.<br><br>And now you know! {= D<br><br>[/soapbox]<br><br>And yeah, do feel better, and keep an eye on those use-by dates.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>You wouldn&#39;t say that after watching me play. I have the most terribad micro on the planet, and I have to bear the shame of losing to a completely BS Probe rush. Seriously, even being 6pooled is somewhat legit, since you <i>might</i> have a chance of holding off the early zerglings provided you wall off your main, park a unit in the gap, scout his early spawning pool, and your opponent flubbing his timings. Being worker rushed is the stupidest all-in you could ever lose to. <br><br>Now, if you want to see SC2 done properly, you could go and watch the pros at work. You can watch their streams on <a href="http://www.teamliquid.net/video/streams/"> Team Liquid</a>&#39;s page, or listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/huskystarcraft"> Husky on YouTube</a> cast some of their matches. I suggest watching Dragon and Empire.Kas for Terran, WhiteRa and HuK for Protoss, and Destiny and Idra for Zerg. </p>

            <p>Well like many before me I&#39;m sure, I don&#39;t really ever know what to write for an intro, so I guess I&#39;ll try the basics and go from there ^^;<br><br>I&#39;m Myrddin, I&#39;ll probably wind up going by Myrd a lot though. I&#39;ve been a fan of the original series and OFUM for several years. A recent re-reading of said series, as well as some of the lovely spin-offs has left me with the thought that being a Sue-sassin would be interesting, that and I&#39;ve always wanted to adopt a mini-Balrog or three, so I thought I&#39;d start the process by poking my head in here and saying hi :) <br><br>My fandoms include Lord of the Rings of course, Jurassic Park, Stargate, Narnia, Hunger Games and to some extent Doctor Who and Farscape. I&#39;ll probably dabble in Harry Potter a bit, but after the last book... I don&#39;t think I&#39;d call myself a fan of the series any longer. And I may see if my agents are strong enough to handle Twilight, as it really bothers me that as rabid as fans of the series are, they can&#39;t even get the canon right XD<br><br>*sets out some NM&amp;NM cookies for everyone*</p>

            <p>Welcome to the Board! Nice name :)<br><br>You have a point about Twilight--I hate to say it, but we could use a few rabid Twilight fans in the PPC. Oh well. I suppose non-rabid, non-fans will have to do... (I&#39;m also planning on taking on a Twilight badfic or two. I was a fan for a few months, before I noticed how bad the plot was, and I can at least get through a few badfics without wincing *too* much. And I&#39;m sure I can get up enough rage to deal with Sues--well, non-canon Sues, anyway--as long as they&#39;re messing up some of the only bearable characters in the canon. So I suppose we&#39;ll see how long it takes my agents to go completely insane...)<br><br>Cookies! *omnomnom* Thanks very much! Here, have some Swiss Bleepolate, guaranteed to distract you with amazing chocolate while making all those horrific details go fuzzy. Also, some lembiss bread (spelling intentional). Be careful, though--it was created by a Sue, and may have some strange effects.<br><br>The problem about Twilight, is that it attracts far more Suethors than goodfic-writers--because, while it appeals strongly to teenagers and people who like romance novels (just a generalization, not meant to encompass every teenager and romance novel fan), it doesn&#39;t attract too many of the sort of people who flock to, say, LotR because of the detail and depth of the canon. Which is why there&#39;s rather a lot more Twilight badfic than goodfic. (At least, that&#39;s my theory).<br><br>I do love Twilight parodies, though :D There&#39;s a good LotR one called &quot;Highlights&quot; on FFN, by Araloth the Random, if anyone wants a recommendation.<br><br>Again, welcome, welcome...<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Thank you, and thank you. XD<br><br>And thank you again for the Swiss Bleepolate and lembiss!<br><br>I just don&#39;t understand all the fans that rabidly defend something that even they don&#39;t know. Not even that they can&#39;t get right in their fan-fiction stories that&#39;s nothing new in sue-fiction, but that they honestly seem not to grasp, despite it being specifically stated. It baffles me. O_o<br><br>Sadly for Twilight fic authors, it helps to have something to start with that has some depth. I did read, and enjoy Luminosity, which I found through the wiki. I will definitely check out Highlights too! </p>

            <p>Strange as it may sound, I&#39;m pretty sure there is the occasional Twilight goodfic. However, there are far more of the sort of fic that, for instance, completely changes the canon rules of vampires (it exists. It would probably work fairly well as an original novel, if not for the first chapter, which involves--or rather, is--the flashback tale of the Sue&#39;s tragic past).<br><br>Ooh, Luminosity! I like that one. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever gotten through the entire fic, but I like what I&#39;ve read of it. As for Highlights...well, I love pretty much all of Araloth&#39;s work, and Highlights was just hilarious. Happy reading :)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>*sniggers* One might argue that since Twilight is almost a badfic, just a canon one, the reverse of good literature should be true. Most Twilight fic should be goodfic. XD Sorry to any Twilight fans. ^^;<br><br>I enjoyed the second &quot;book&quot; of Luminosity more than the first, I think the author kind of over did it in swinging Bella to the opposite. But then, maybe that&#39;s how she&#39;s be if she didn&#39;t revolve around Edward and actually had her own personality? Anyway, a lot of the second book takes place in Volterra and gives a lot more fleshing out to the members of the Volturi, kind of like how the Hunger Games movie sounds like it expanded the characters of Seneca and Haymitch, so it was really interesting. The little side stories listed on Lumiosity&#39;s website are further glimpses at specific people, and are quite interesting too. ^^<br><br>*runs off to read Highlights* </p>

            <p>Hi. :D I haven&#39;t seen any Hunger Games missions at all actually, which since it has been made into a movie, surprises me a bit. I may look into doing my first mission there once I have hung around a bit and procured permission. ^^<br><br>I think the first book is my favorite if I had to pick, although really they are all very good, it&#39;s very hard to choose. As for characters, I really like Rue, Finnick, Wiress, Beetee, Cinna and Haymitch a lot. Now it&#39;s your turn, mwahaha! Which is your favorite book and character? Have you seen the movie? And if so, what did you think of it?<br><br>Thank you for the rendering ^^ It was lovely!</p>

            <p>Missions in the PPC generally get written according to author preference. It just so happens that not very many people in the PPC are into the Hunger Games canon. Now that I&#39;m back, I might see if I can&#39;t change that, but we&#39;ll see.<br><br>Personally, my favorite of the whole series is Catching Fire. I was actually really interested in some of the ideas that Catching Fire postulated, particularly in regards to that awesome arena where the games took place, and how all the plot threads came together at the end. The first book was also very good, and there were things about Mockingjay that I loved and things about it I didn&#39;t like so much. Finnick and Rue are also some of my favorite characters, actually: they&#39;re just so lovable it&#39;s hard to get around it, really.<br><br>I definitely saw the movie. I was a little sad that they cut the avox subplot, but I could see why they did it. On the whole, I thought the movie was a bit rushed, so it wasn&#39;t a great movie. As far as an adaptation of the book, though, I couldn&#39;t have asked for anything more: the film showed a world that was <i>literally</i> what I imagined the world of the Hunger Games to be.<br><br>Yeah. I always find myself fascinated by Luciano Berio&#39;s work: it&#39;s always incredibly fascinating.</p>

            <p>That seems really odd to me considering they are such good books. I look forward to reading missions to the Hunger Games if you find some good (bad)fic for them. Maybe I&#39;ll peruse some and make some suggestions for you to check out.<br><br>I did love the Catching Fire arena, it just seems like the second games went so fast. I suppose as clever as the arena was, it was less geared toward having a nice long staying power like the first arena, you can only loop through the cycle so many times, especially once they figured out the catch.<br><br>I&#39;ve not watched the movie, I was unimpressed with the casting choices, especially since I know people who are pretty much Katniss and Peeta, so I would really prefer to not muss up the pictures I have in my head. ^^; I had heard mixed reviews of the movie, and my only friend here that&#39;s into it is &quot;Katniss&quot; so she wasn&#39;t too keen on seeing it either. I&#39;ve been trying to find someone who was a solid fan of the books who went to see the movie for an opinion, it&#39;s nice to hear they did the world justice. It would have been nice if they could have kept the avox sub-plot, though as a fan, I would pretty much say that about any element they had to cut.<br><br>I feel I must confess that I am not a music connoisseur, it was very pretty though. :) </p>

            <p>Well, tastes here in the PPC differ wildly. There used to be someone here who I got into an argument about taste with when it turned out that she didn&#39;t like <i>World War Z</i> (another book I quite like a lot), so taste in the PPC is pretty relative with that.<br><br>Yeah. And honestly, for me the more interesting part of Catching Fire was watching the ways President Snow went around screwing with Katniss&#39; life. I think that made him an extremely effective, villain, particularly when the quarter quell conditions were announced. So yeah...<br><br>The casting actually worked out pretty well in the end, particularly as far as Jennifer Lawrence is concerned. (I actually thought J-Law&#39;s casting was perfect for Katniss Everdeen, mostly because she kind of already played a very similar character in <i>Winter&#39;s Bone</i>. Difference between them, of course, is that J-Law had to gut a squirrel on-camera in <i>Winter&#39;s Bone</i>.) I don&#39;t think I can find any casting choice in that movie that didn&#39;t work for me, as all the acting was really good. The things that weren&#39;t so great about the movie were the pacing (again, it felt just a bit rushed), and the fact that Gary Marshall <i>cannot</i> direct an action scene to save his life (seriously, Gary, lay off on the damn shaky-cam!). Otherwise, though, it was a pretty good movie.<br><br>Yeah, they did have to cut material, but fortunately they didn&#39;t cut too much. The avox subplot was not the only thing they cut, though: they cut Madge out of the movie entirely, and came up with a completely different version of how Katniss got her mockingjay pin (she got it from the Hob). There are merits to both approaches, I think, particularly as far as some things in Catching Fire are concerned. That said, there was actually a small amount of material that was added, and that one thing that was added was something that I actually thought was for the better. The really big thing I&#39;m thinking about is that the movie didn&#39;t stay with Katniss the whole time once she was in the Games. Seneca Crane and Haymitch both actually have expanded roles in the movie, on virtue of the fact that the movie cuts to the Capitol at some points (particularly to the game-makers, so Seneca Crane&#39;s role is <i>greatly</i> expanded). I actually thought this was really interesting, because then we got to see more of the machinations behind how things work in the Games. The movie <i>showed</i> how the game-makers might think to make things more interesting, the movie <i>showed</i> all the talking that Haymitch had to do to start dropping items down to the arena... that was actually an addition that I liked a lot.<br><br>Hm... we&#39;ll need to fix that, LOL. I think I have a new music guinea pig!</p>

            <p>XD Well I&#39;m sure there are people here who, upon learning I&#39;ve not had the chance to read/watch their fandoms, but have found time for Twilight would demand I go sit in a corner and think about what I&#39;ve done. XD<br><br>(not really... I know people here would never /say/ such things) ^_^<br><br>I&#39;ve not heard of Winter&#39;s Bone, although it sounds like I may have to check it out.<br><br>Don&#39;t you know? Shaking = intense action! How would we know what was going on if the camera stayed still all the time? I don&#39;t really have anything against the actors they chose... it&#39;s just they did not at all personify the people I had in my head for those characters, it&#39;s nice to hear they chose actors for a popular series that can act at least. *cough*Twilight*cough* I&#39;m even more sad to hear they cut Madge, Katniss&#39; and her friendship was a major (minor) theme, even if they could change how she acquired the pin smoothly.<br><br>However the addition of the behind the scenes with Haymitch and Crane sounds really interesting, and a good choice as an addition to make the book more &quot;movie friendly&quot;. I&#39;m still not sure I want to actually watch it, because I don&#39;t want the actors taking over the images in my head, but I may see about renting it and letting it play in a different room so I can listen to it!<br><br>*squeak* How did you know? Actually I suppose, I&#39;m not a guinea pig, but I do have one. ^^ It&#39;s two feet long, invisible, Atlantian in origin and lives on an island that tows around the Bermuda triangle. I would love to listen to new music though, as long as it&#39;s not all scream-y. ^^</p>

            <p>Yeah. I don&#39;t have too much time to do fandom catch-up myself, so... yeah. XD<br><br>Winter&#39;s Bone was actually the movie that basically jump-started Jennifer Lawrence&#39;s career. It&#39;s about a teenage girl in the Ozarks who has to prove that her father is dead to make sure that she and her family don&#39;t get evicted from their house. It&#39;s one of the most underrated movies of 2009, and you should really check it out (though make sure that the parents aren&#39;t around: a squirrel is gutted on-screen, J-Law does get pretty bloodied up, and a small portion of the plot centers around crystal meth).<br><br>Ah... I see... Yeah, I don&#39;t know. (And as for Madge&#39;s friendship... I don&#39;t know. It was pretty major in the books, but then Madge got killed off-screen in Mockingjay and then she was kinda forgotten, so I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a major theme of the whole canon.) And yeah, the casting was great: and it&#39;s even better, &#39;cause J-Law actually likes the Hunger Games, so... yeah.<br><br>On a world-building perspective, it actually also works for the better: not only do we get to see more things about life in the Capitol, but it builds the fact that the Hunger Games are, in the end, a spectacle. And on that level, it really works.<br><br>XD Oh, you. Well... in terms of getting you into new music... well, it&#39;s not really all scream-y, but it&#39;s not what people would call tonal either. And actually, most people consider music written in the 50&#39;s to be new music since it sounds so new. Here...

            <p>Oh my, I don&#39;t know how I missed this one, I&#39;ve been trying to keep track of everything. XD<br><br>I guess I think of Madge&#39;s friendship as a theme through the entire series, because Katniss is so affected by it, so while it&#39;s true she does die, and &quot;off-screen&quot; at that, she remains a part of Katniss, through the pin, the strawberries and as someone who was truly a friend to her. <br><br>I&#39;ll definitely add Winter&#39;s Bone to my &quot;need to watch soon&quot; movie list, as well as the Hunger Games, though however appropriate the casting may have been, I still don&#39;t want to actually watch it watch it, it sounds like a good representation of the book, with some interesting extra inside bits. XD<br><br>Fun, I&#39;ll listen to them all tomorrow. :D Thanks!</p>

            <p>I thought the movie was really good, especially when:<br>SPOILER ALERT, YES, THIS MEANS NEW THINGS THAT ARE PRESENT IN THE FILM THAT WERE NOT IN THE BOOKS<br>Haymitch convinced Senica Crane to include the new rule of &#39;If the pair is from the same district, they can both win&#39; because of the marketing power of Twu Wuv. That scene single handedly made the game-maker&#39;s worst mistake Haymitch&#39;s greatest triumph of the first games.<br>END OF SPOILERS<br><br> I consider the movie version mostly-canon, unlike most films, because Suzan Collins co-wrote the script and worked with the director every step of the way. The things they cut had to be cut for timing, and while the books are considered the main canon, the new additions to the film are still valid canon.<br><br>Fun fact about the movie: President Snow&#39;s rose garden scenes were made specifically because of a letter Donald Sutherland wrote to the director when he asked for the role. It was so powerful in explaining why he believed in the character and script, he gave him more time on screen to flesh out Snow&#39;s character.<br><br>As for my favorite book and character; Either the first book or Mockingjay, and Peta. Peta acts so much like me, I can&#39;t help but love him. As for the books, Mockingjay has so much politically, but the first books has a greater amount of raw impact, so I&#39;m not sure which one I prefer. All I know is, I love the books too, and need to re-read them soon.</p>

            <p>I like the idea of seeing behind the scenes like that, and I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s more engaging for the audience watching it.

            <p>*Seneca<br>*Suzanne<br>*Peeta<br>(Also Hunger Games fan here...Favorite book has got to be the first, and Mockingjay just got confusing. By the end I think Katniss was going insane, and the best resolution for her character would have been to join the Hunters of Artemis. They would give her a supportive family and friends, and she already has awesome archery skills.<br>I liked Peeta, Prim, and Buttercup. Seriously, Katniss and Buttercup&#39;s love-hate relationship is awesome. Yes, I&#39;m talking about Prim&#39;s cat.<br>The movie was good. The only change I was a little bit upset with was the muttations not looking like the dead tributes. It made them creepy times twenty in the book. But maybe it was too difficult. It seems like having the author involved with the process helps make it a good movie.</p>

            <p>I was sort of wondering if those were going to be picked up, or if as they were posted on my thread, perhaps that was my duty. Guess I missed the boat if it was. XD<br><br>Author involvement in the scripting process is definitely a good thing.

            <p>What exactly are Hunger Games minis? Also, could I perhaps have Suzan? Suzanne Collins is definitely a favorite author of mine (I should probably put Gregor and the Overlanders as one of my fandoms, really, I even wrote fic for it once), and I would be quite honored (and happy) to have a mini of her :) Although, would Suzan even be a normal Hunger Games mini, or would she be an Author-mini...?

            <p>I think she would be an author mini. I don&#39;t see why those wouldn&#39;t exist, sue-authors can make sue minis, and locations can be minis, so why not the canon authors themselves? I think they would be separate though since a sue-mini is distinctive to the sue, author minis should be their own category. Especially since lots of authors write more than one series, how would one pick which fandom the author mini would be?<br><br>I couldn&#39;t find Hunger Games minis when I looked either, I think the lack of missions there is the reason. I was trying to think what they would be and only came up with mini-mockingjays and mini-bread (because of Peeta) that would be easily recognizable things from the universe. But I think mini-bread would be more OFUM related what with its breadlegs being sentient bread. So that left the mini-mockingjays. But I think I&#39;m going to have to third the opinion of mini-muttations that came up! (although mini-Effies would be fun too!)</p>

            <p>Are simply the minis from that continuum. In <a href="http://lilywinterwood.tumblr.com/post/35034276137/ppc-the-strange-life-of-isabella-holmes">this mission</a> a misspelling of Stephenie Meyer was found (&quot;Stephanie&quot;), and it became a mini-Sparklewolf. <br>Yes, those are the muttations, and mini-Effies doesn&#39;t make any sense.

            <p>So, whatever story the mission is in, that&#39;s what the misspelled author minis are? So a misspelling of C.S. Lewis in a Narnia mission would be a mini-dragon where as a misspelling of C.S. Lewis in a Screwtape Letters mission would be say, a mini-demon and a misspelling of C. S.

            <p>Misspellings of author&#39;s names simply become the mini for that continuum, e.g. &quot;Tolkein&quot; is a mini-Balrog.<br><br>And minis are animals, unless the continuum doesn&#39;t have any animals that would work.

            <p>I like the idea of mini-mutts as well.

            <p>Absolutely right, but not. XD How&#39;s that?<br><br>When I say/agreed with mini-muttations, I meant the arena muttations of the tributes in book one. Although &quot;mutts&quot; does become slang for all hybrids made by the capitol by the end of the series. If I recall correctly &quot;muttations&quot; is very nearly only used to refer to the tribute mutts from the first book.<br><br>So my vote was for mini-muttations (first book incarnation), but I like World-Jumper&#39;s idea that they would all be different in that unlike most minis that are one thing, the Hunger Games mini-mutts would vary according to character, complete with physical aspects from the character who&#39;s name was butchered to birth the mini. ^^</p>

            <p>If it was a name of a place that was misspelled, then it would have some physical traits of the place, if possible. For example, if District 12 were misspelled, it would have a coal-gray coat with grey eyes. The fun mutt would be the Capitol (which I am sure has been misspelled before) as it may well share the Capitol fasion sense. If the autor cannot think of anything, the &#39;default&#39; mutt would be the ones from the film.</p>

            <p>Man, I&#39;m sorry. Shesh Peeta is even an easy one, I shouldn&#39;t have made that mistake. If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like to keep little Peta as a reminder to not screw up names. <br><br>Actually, I was just on the wiki, and I did not see what the Hunger Games minis were. If there are none, I motion for them to be mutts from the 74&#39;th games, complete with physical aspects from the charicter who&#39;s name was butchered to birth the mini. <br><br>In other news: Aperently Percy Jackson and The Hunger Games share the same universe. While Katniss joining the Hunters would be interesting to say the least, I don&#39;t think Artemis would appreciate a hunter who is in the middle of a love triangle and has expressed interest in male company in the past. Now, if Apollo would stop writing awful poems, and form his own archery team, perhaps she could join that. Otherwise, I don&#39;t think she would make it into the Hunters, or any other Greek Pantheon based organization. Darn it, now I have to think about the crossover of the two. What have you done hermione? What have you done?</p>

            <p>About Percy Jackson: Maybe they wanted them to be like the movie, because the Percy Jackson movie was nothing like the books. (Most fans, even those who saw the movie first, agree that the books are better.) Basically, if you don&#39;t know, they&#39;re similar to Harry Potter, only with Greek mythology, and, well, differences. Percy Jackson is a modern-day demigod, and the gods and monsters of Greek mythology live in modern-day America. Hilarity ensues as we learn that the Bermuda Triangle is a hotspot of monster activity, that Medusa sells statuary, that Zeus wears a pinstripe suit, and how other gods and monsters adapted through the ages. The books are fun and clever, and I highly recommend them.</p>

            <p>According to the mini page, creation of minis is reserved for the creator of the OFU for that fandom or for the first person to write missions in that continuum. But I feel that a vote on the Board would do just as well. Maybe I&#39;ll start a thread.<br>As to crossovers: I only say that because by the end, it seemed like she needed someplace to relax and get her sanity back before going back into society, if she should go back into society at all. So many of her friends had died, and she went through so much. I think if Katniss promised not to go back to her male friends, Artemis would let her in. Also, I feel like Thalia and Luke had some feelings for each other, and Artemis still let Thalia in. <br>This also could be my &quot;Team Katniss&quot; stance - I never could decide who she should be with, so I decided she should be single, at least for a while. Single + Archery Skills made me think of the Hunters.</p>

            <p>Okay! Every so often, we&#39;ve passed a handful of Newbie Crops, the people who are going to stick around having decided to do so, and the people who aren&#39;t, having wandered off, and everyone is happy and friendly and swapping stories and forging friendships, and all the lovely stuff this community is, at its heart, built on. The problem is, everyone wants to hang out with their friends, swap cool stories, fanart, plug fanfic, etc - and everyone wants to do it simultaneously, and we wind up with a lot of voices going unheard or underheard because of the din.<br><br>This is where I remind you all that in addition to this lovely Posting Board, we&#39;ve got a lovely IRC room (two, actually), and <i>all PPCers are welcome* there</i>. Chatting is awesome, chatting is fun, come hang out with us! And each other!<br><br>In addition to that, though, a lot of us have accounts other places - blogs, story-blogs, Deviantart accounts, GTalk accounts, Dreamwidths, et cetara, and I think a lot of us would benefit and be happy-fied by following and hanging out on each other&#39;s spaces thusly. So - consider this a free-for-all plug-your-space... uh... space.<br><br>Before I give out my own info, though, I&#39;ll hit the &quot;Plug&quot; end of this. If you&#39;re on the IRC when I am, you may have noticed my tendency to post links from <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/">Slacktivist</a>. I&#39;m here encouraging y&#39;all to check this blog out, because it&#39;s awesome, quite honestly my favorite place on the internet &#39;sides this one, and if you&#39;re into theology, philosophy, politics, pie, snark, and/or general geek culture, this is a place you&#39;ll fit right in.<br><br>And down to the selfish contact plugs.<br>On GTalk, my name is the same as it is here, with an @gmail.com attached. I&#39;m generally comparable to a badger or especially ornery snake in terms of vicious snapping, beware. On Tumblr, my account is <a href="http://vmthecoyote.tumblr.com/"><a href="http://vmthecoyote.tumblr.com/">http://vmthecoyote.tumblr.com/</a></a>, and I&#39;m also snarky and aggressive as well as frequently NSFW - beware. I have a DA account that&#39;s horribly inactive, but most of my writing, and a coming &quot;Interesting Things Are Happening&quot; feature, are located at <a href="http://thulcandran.dreamwidth.com/"><a href="http://thulcandran.dreamwidth.com/">http://thulcandran.dreamwidth.com/</a></a>. Come check it out!<br><br>What about y&#39;all? Where do you hang out?<br><br>*albeit, with the same &quot;Don&#39;t be jerks to others, read the rules and abide by them&quot; caveat that the &#39;Board carries.</p>

            <p>Outside of this community, I really haven&#39;t settled down anywhere for very long; I&#39;ll usually end up just making one or two posts and then leaving, but I will admit to recently acquiring a tumblr.

            <p>I&#39;ll plug my favorite authors on Fanfiction.net.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3643416/">androidilenya</a> - Awesome Hunger Games fanfiction. Mostly SYOTs (Submit Your Own Tributes) that have really unique arenas and encourage really unique tributes. They&#39;re sort of in a series, &quot;Glass Maze&quot; being the first and &quot;Fantasy World&quot; being the one currently running. (My tribute is the District 4 girl.) She&#39;s also written for the Silmarillion, and &quot;Fantasy World&quot; has a lot of Tolkien references. <br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1781664/">Cumberbatch Critter</a> - My go-to author for Sherlock fanfiction. Nearly all of it is fluffy sick!fics involving Sherlock or John or both sick and the other taking care of them. She&#39;s really good at throwing Sherlock just a little out of character while still keeping him in character, if that makes any sense.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2531448/">Zelda12343</a> - Good Star Trek: TOS, mostly oneshots with Chekov. I am a really big fan of her Star Trek High School AU, &quot;A Small Town Called Enterprise&quot;. An example of a high school AU done well. Unfortunately, it hasn&#39;t been updated in while. :(<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3515/">Alara Rogers</a> - Amazing Star Trek fic, mostly TNG and Voyager involving our favorite omnipotent trickster, Q. She writes from his point of view just as well as the professional novel from Q&#39;s point of view (which was co-written by John de Lancie, so this is <i>high</i> praise).<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/4171923/fictiongal">fictiongal</a> - Star Trek: TNG, mostly Data-centric. I love her holiday fics. However, I suspect that &quot;Captain&#39;s Prerogative&quot; and any sequels or related works are Suefics.<br><br>href=&quot;h<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3832947/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3832947/">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3832947/</a></a>&quot;&gt;Amelie Nockturne - Good Percy Jackson fic. Unfortunately, most of them haven&#39;t been updated in a while. But every once in a while, there&#39;s an update, so I feel like she might not have completely forgotten them. <br><br>Oh, and I have a Fanfiction.net account too, <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3175527/hermione-of-vulcan">here</a>. Haven&#39;t been doing much on it besides OFAS recently, though. I also have a DeviantArt account, but I&#39;m not that good of an artist so I won&#39;t <s>inflict it on you all</s> post the link.<br></p>

            <p>Um...I think the only relevant thing right now (at least, that I feel like sharing) is my FFN account--DawnFire and Silver Huntress (used to be shared with one of my best friends, who has since taken a vacation from fanfic). The link is <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Edawnfireandsilverhuntress">www.fanfiction.net/~dawnfireandsilverhuntress</a>. Most of what&#39;s on there is Harry Potter fanfic, along with a drabble each for LotR and The Hobbit. It&#39;s updated sporadically, but if you want to check it out, I don&#39;t mind :) I&#39;m also very happy when fed reviews, and often get inspired by them to continue writing/post more...<br><br>I&#39;m also on NaNoWriMo, dA, Tumblr, and suchlike, but I don&#39;t really hang out on any of them much (ok, you could make a case for dA, but that&#39;s it), and I&#39;d prefer to keep my Facebook private--although if you&#39;re looking for a great group on Facebook, try the Magic of Torchwood one--it&#39;s a discussion group for a really good fanfic, and consists of discussions about the story, about DW/TW/HP in general, Avengers, and who knows what else. It&#39;s very fun, and currently has about 100 members.<br><br>--plug over--<br><br>I&#39;m happy to add goodfic recommendations for varous fandoms, though, if people want them. I should have a pretty good collection by now.<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Oh, this looks like fun! Before I plug myself, Im&#39;ma plug some of my favorite fanwriters, because they deserve the love:<br><br><b>KittyNoodles&#39; Favorites:</b><br><b>Goodficcers:</b><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2924204/wanda-von-dunayev">wanda von dunayev</a> - C&#39;mon, anyone who&#39;s been on the IRC when I&#39;ve hopped on in the last few weeks should at least recognize the name! No capital letters here, I assume because she realizes that no one who writes WoW fanfics as awesomely as she does NEEDS to capitalize her own screen name! Lots of blood elf-central stories here, although she&#39;s done stories for non-blood elves as well, and those are just as awesome!<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/7068/Dragoness-Eclectic">Dragoness Eclectic</a> - So far the only decent <i>Dragonball Z</i> fanficcer I&#39;ve discovered. She has <a href="http://www.republicofnewhome.org/lair/">another site</a> all her own, and her writings are much better organizer there. I haven&#39;t read her <i>Transformers</i> stuff, but if it&#39;s half as good as &quot;Raditz&#39;s Return&quot; or &quot;Mythic Descent&quot;, it&#39;s definitely worth a peek!<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/206161/Jay-of-Lasgalen">Jay of Lasgalen</a> - One of my favorite <i>Lord of the Rings</i> writers on the Pit, Jay likes to write fanfics centered mostly around Elrohir, Elladan, and Legolas - all in their younger incarnations, mind you. I might not be a very <i>knowledgeable</i> fan of LotR, but it seems to me Jay does an excellent job of interpreting and giving characterizations to characters who otherwise get very little screen time in the books. Again, this writer is definitely worth a peek - and I&#39;d recommend you start with &quot;With Friends Like These&quot;, because it is equal parts funny and adorable.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1306701/Esteliel01">Esteliel01</a> - Another brilliant <i>Lord of the Rings</i> writer, though with quite a bit fewer stories than Jay. Esteliel01 has sadly decided not to write fanfictions anymore, but his/her account remains active and his/her stories are definitely worth the read, because they also feature little!Elrohir and little!Elladan.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1133693/InunotaishoandTheMikoSisters">InunotaishoandTheMikoSisters</a> - Hard name to spell, and to be honest, I copypasta&#39;d it. Nonetheless, this ficcer - or rather, these <i>three</i> ficcers - have written two incredibly awesome <i>Lord of the Rings</i> crackfics: &quot;The Boromir Letters&quot; and &quot;Dear Dad: The Gimli Letters&quot;. And I know for a fact that &quot;Under the Hat Brim&quot; and &quot;A Healer&#39;s Oath&quot; are also worth a peek. I&#39;d say at the very least, these three are fledgling writers.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1405882/knightchaser">knightchaser</a> - I&#39;ve only read two of this ficcer&#39;s stories - &quot;Itachi: The early years&quot; and &quot;A Perception of Reality&quot; - but those are both MASSIVELY AWESOME pieces and a must-read for any <i>Naruto</i> fan, especially if that <i>Naruto</i> fan is also an Uchiha Itachi fan.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/577994/MitsukiShiroi">MitsukiShiroi</a> - Another great <i>Naruto</i> fanficcer, Mistuki focuses solely on Itachi/Sakura stories - and does it <i>well</i>. My advice? Start by reading &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, then &quot;Evolution&quot; and &quot;Salvation&quot;. Hands-down, one of the best ItaSaku trilogies you will ever read.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1423731/">dead drifter</a> - A <i>Naruto</i> crackficcer with a very lewd sense of humor. Sadly enough, this is another favorite of mine who has apparently gone underground; still, his/her stories remain on the site in all their cracky, R-rated glory! Although, best to avoid this one&#39;s stories i you don&#39;t like male-on-male action or outright smut...<br><br><b>Others:</b><br><a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Protectors-of-the-Plot-Continuum-PPC/148909888470443">Protectors of the Plot Continuum (PPC)</a> - Someone made a Facebook group about the PPC!<br><a href="http://textsfrommiddle-earth.tumblr.com/archive">Texts From Middle-Earth</a> - Too funny not to plug, really.<br><br><br>And now for my own plugs!

            <p>Hey Huinesoron. I&#39;m a huge fan, especially of your series Crashing Down (Agent Kayleigh, at least for me, is sheer awesome). I was just wondering, would it be okay if I used a Mary Sue Factory in my Permission piece? <br><br>It wouldn&#39;t necessarily be a part of the LMSF, but it would be very underfunded and resorts to kidnapping people for experiments (as carefully and discreetly as possible, of course). They sent a Mary Sue type thing to kidnap my agent, an oblivious high schooler. It almost gets my agent with a syringe full of sleeping serum, but my agent notices and fends it off for a little, which just amuses it.<br><br>The Sue jabs my agent with the syringe, but just when all seems hopeless, Agent Lux comes to the rescue. My sgent manages to drag herself home, as the serum is all screwed up because it&#39;s expired/not made right/whatever. She then proceeds to spend the night hiding from her parents and vomiting up glitter.<br><br>Lux comes back, and it&#39;s revealed that the Sue just barely got away. My agent joins the PPC, as she hates how easily the Sue beat her and is scared that it will come back.<br><br>So that&#39;s the basic summary of what I want to use the factory for. Please tell me if you think my origin is the stupidest thing ever, and don&#39;t be afraid to offer ConCrit. It&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t want to let me use the Factory, I can always think of a different origin. I&#39;d also be happy to tweak my story. I can email you more details and when I&#39;m finished, my Permission piece (I&#39;ve basically written the parts up to Sue&#39;s entrance).<br><br>Thank you for reading my rambling post. Anyone else who&#39;s got advice for me, please share. I could use all the help I get (:</p>

            <p>To clarify, is it alright to have one of my agents recieve the Message (from the Swan&#39;s Egg trilogy)? I&#39;m not sure when/if it would happen, but I&#39;d like to know if it&#39;s alright :)<br><br>Also, can the connection between Boarders and agents be expanded upon? For instance, could a Boarder potentially know that their agent had gained sentience/reality, and amused him/herself by sending the agent gifts and the occasional message and watching said agent freak out trying to figure out what was going on? (Ok, that&#39;s not exactly what my idea was, that&#39;s more of a &#39;could this happen?&#39; question. The actual idea is that Agent Dawn has a supply of NM&amp;NMs that mysteriously replenishes itself, and that one day she recieves the Message and--I&#39;m not really sure what happens next, beyond someone--possibly her--becoming deeply suspicious of the NM&amp;NMs, and possibly having some sort of conversation on the Board with the Boarder who &#39;created&#39; her wherein she tries to convince the Boarder that she does exist, until reality reasserts itself. It would probably go in an interlude of some sort).<br><br>Although, on a different note, how can agents have NM&amp;NMs? Do they just not know where they come from?<br><br>Also, is there such a thing as an agent who doesn&#39;t forget? Outside of the former DIO agents? That&#39;s not to say that I have a candidate, but it would be an interesting idea to explore...As would the Boarders&#39; perspective of this. I mean, yes, we&#39;d probably either call troll or just assume it was a crazy roleplay, but...it could be very funny.<br><br>That&#39;s all the rambling and questions for now, I think...please let me know if any of this could be plausibly used in a PPC story.<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

Sigh.<br><br>{That&#39;s &#39;<i>Former</i> Agent Lou&#39;, thank you. Hi, DawnFire. What I believe His Nibs was about to say is that there are a fair few of us who know what&#39;s going on - but we don&#39;t all know the same things. I, for instance, am entirely aware that I live in hS&#39; head and only agreed to work at the PPC - the first time, I mean - as a way to get out. The fact that I got a love life out of it is a bonus. =D<br><br>{But there are others who &#39;know&#39; that they&#39;re written characters - because they&#39;ve met their authors in the flesh. I technically did that once, too, but that was a special case - and a conversation which actually happened in... Google Talk, I think}<br><br>Which was quite surreal; I don&#39;t recommend it.<br><br>{You wouldn&#39;t, control freak. <i>Any</i>way, it&#39;s (probably) impossible for fictional characters to actual reach the <i>real</i> real world - and I understand my grandkids are going to be finding that out in a story which isn&#39;t finished yet - so when agents meet their creators in meatspace, there&#39;s clearly <i>something</i> fictional going on.}<br><br>Is this helping? She does go on a bit.<br><br>{In the nicest possible sense, &#39;Mr Narrator&#39;, shut up. So, in general, the rules of writing PPC fiction apply: if you write it well, it&#39;s no problem. If you write it badly - rewrite it better.}<br><br>{And I think hS got called a troll by a very-newbie a few years ago for posting as a few of his agents. It was quite funny to watch.}<br><br>{~Lou}</p>

            <p>...so what you&#39;re saying is, if I can write it well enough, anything can happen. Up to and including interactions between Agent Dawn and DawnFire the Boarder.<br><br>I do hope you know what you&#39;ve started, hS (and Lou). My brain tends to take ideas and run away with them, complete with <s>evil</s> gleeful laughter and promises to make them expand into castles. Basically, I may have just found the subject for about ten or so interludes, or possibly more...Ah, that&#39;s it: &#39;snowballed&#39; is the term I&#39;m looking for. That one little idea has just managed to snowball into a whole storyline. I&#39;ll do my best to keep it from getting too crazy (and I think I&#39;ll succeed), but so far I&#39;ve planned out both the progression of DawnFire and Agent Dawn&#39;s interactions and an exploration of just how different Boarders can be from their agents. (I mean, seriously, how many of us would actually, realistically deal well with giant, sentient Flowers? Or seeing our favorite characters as actual, living, breathing people? Or even just seeing a place that only exists to us in books and imagination? We ourselves are not agents, and while we may base agents on ourselves--and often do--those agents generally have several qualities that we do not.) And also, how would Boarders react to someone posting as an agent, and refusing to admit that it was a roleplay? That could get fairly ridiculous...<br><br>And, of course, pretty much all of this <i>could</i> be written seriously...or it could be written with every scrap of humor to be found in the situation, which is a <i>lot</i>. :D<br><br>Speaking of the Message, has anyone (else) used it? If so, who?<br><br>Also, nice to meetcha, Agent--er, <i>Former</i> Agent Lou. You and hS in one post make for a very humorous read, and I remember you <s>fondly</s> happily from the webcomic.<br><br>To sum things up a bit: I&#39;ve just discovered exactly why Agent Dawn keeps coming out so insane. I mean, it goes beyond a lack of brain-to-mouth filter; there must be <i>something</i> that enables her to be so crazy, as well as something that can explain various little inconsistencies (such as, if she never gets to spend much time in her RC, why are there so many piles of things? So much painting on the walls? So much--ok, you get the idea). And, it seems, that something that makes her slightly above-average insane is that she knows she is, to some extent, a fictional character; and that something that explains the inconsistencies is that she occasionally gets (very surreal) visits from her writer. (They get a little less surreal as Dawn and DawnFire learn to ignore some of the facts of the actual situation, but...that&#39;s a bit hard to do, so I doubt it&#39;ll ever get too un-surreal).<br><br>And all this inspiration is coming right when I&#39;m trying to finish up my Permission Request. Why exactly did I decide it was a good idea to let my brain run off with ideas for this meta adventure <i>and</i> an OFU?<br><br>...Oh, right, I didn&#39;t <i>decide</i> that. It just happened anyway. Good thing, that; I&#39;m having a lot of fun with this, and the current plans for the OFU are <i>wonderful</i>.<br><br>...the troll incident sounds <i>hilarious</i>. I don&#39;t suppose there&#39;s a link to that thread lying around somewhere?<br><br>But yeah, if I&#39;ve got free license to run with all these ideas, as long as I can make them come out well...let the meta adventure begin!<br><br>(er, after I get Permission. Yes. Permission is important. Tomorrow Permission, on <s>Friday</s> Tuesday the stories!)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>For plot purposes in my current superproject (Blank Sprite), I was going to need Defectives. However, I have a little question:<br><br>- Is it possible to make Defectives deliberately, to be used as mooks?<br>- And it is possible for a single Sue (with the help of two other character with Suvian characteristics but not full-blown Sues) to set up all what is needed to produce them, during the course of rougly 4 years?</p>

            <p>1/ Yes, it would be - and it would probably be cheaper, or at least less resource-intensive (maybe you don&#39;t add the glitter? No idea) - but would a Mary-Sue do so? It&#39;s a bit of a toss-up between &#39;I must make only perfect things!&#39; and &#39;I can&#39;t produce a possible competitor!&#39;. A Flower-run Factory would face a similar dilemma, with the choice being between &#39;Mary-Sues are the best weapon against the PPC and/or canon&#39; and &#39;Defectives are rather less ditzy&#39;.<br><br>2/ That probably depends entirely on where she is. The Factories are using a sort of amalgam of various scifi cloning technologies. A Star Wars Sue, for instance, would probably find it very easy. One stuck in Middle-earth wouldn&#39;t have a chance. This also assumes she has a clue what to do - simple trial and error would probably take longer than 4 years.<br><br>But in principle, there&#39;s no reason a Sue couldn&#39;t set up a generator, nutrient system, and cloning pod, with attached genetic sequencer and glitter-dialysis system, in a cave somewhere and start growing full-fledged Sues, let alone Defectives. And if you can make one, you can make several...<br><br>(And on the Star Wars note: there&#39;s no indication that Factory Sues are grown in the presence of ysalamiri. In case that&#39;s relevant)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... I certainly don&#39;t mind you using the idea of the Factories. The League itself itself is fairly fragmented these days, so an &#39;Independant&#39; Factory wouldn&#39;t be a problem either - and being cut off from the League would explain why they were also cut off from the (former) PPC Biotechnology Inc. and its supplies.<br><br>As to your summary, I&#39;m assuming the Factory wants your character because she has some characteristic they want to breed into their Sues (the Mysterious Somebody bred for Force sensitivity at one point, for example). That&#39;s fine as a motibe, as long as you make sure not to make it a SuperAwesum!!!Trait (&quot;They want here because she&#39;s the BEST and PRETTIEST violinist in the historyoftheWORLD!!1&quot;). I suppose the other reason could be to use her as a test subject for the Sues to practice being Mary-Sues on - but in that case, I&#39;d imagine her kidnapper would use charm and so on, not sleeping potion (unless the charm failed?).<br><br>Using &#39;it&#39; to describe a Mary-Sue - even one from the Factories - is dubious; they&#39;re very definitely She (or He), unless they&#39;re a Defective. Defectives, if you recall, are the colourless workers in the Factory - they&#39;re Sues whose breeding process went a little wrong. Calling one of them It would make perfect sense - and would explain why it didn&#39;t use Suvian powers to kidnap her.<br><br>So in general: I think it&#39;s a good, workable idea, and I certainly don&#39;t have any objections to you borrowing my ideas. Just be sure you&#39;ve got people&#39;s motivations pinned down in your head - even if they don&#39;t show up in the story! You&#39;ve got a good motive for your character to join the PPC, but make sure you know why the Factory wants her - either specifically her, or just people in general. <i>What</i> experiments? And, equally, make sure you know what Lux is even doing there (although, yes, &#39;plothole&#39; is perfectly acceptable).<br><br>And I&#39;m glad you like Crashing Down! It took a bloomin&#39; long time to write, so it&#39;s good to know people are still enjoying it.<br><br>And have you taken a look at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?pli=1&amp;formkey=dExsRGpKMzhPbWVnTlB6TmJVdEttc1E6MQ#gid=0">PPC Permission Self-Check</a>? It&#39;s an awesome (even if I do say so myself) way to check how deep your understanding of the PPC is - and quite fun, too!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m just wondering, because based on your description of the scenario, she seems like an odd choice.

            <p>But - *laughs hysterically*<br>Ilraen is so adorably clueless, as usual, and Nume is, well, Nume. His is my favorite, actually, mostly because it fits the traditional format while being so completely him - as in, &quot;I don&#39;t want to see it, I don&#39;t want to know about it, I hate this holiday because it&#39;s <i>everywhere</i>!&quot; *gulps down Bleepka, acts like a complete party pooper*<br>Did I ever mention I&#39;ve really enjoyed his missions? &quot;Ring Child&quot; might be one of my favorite PPC missions ever, just because the interaction between Suicide and Nume was by turns funny and meaningful, seeing as they have totally different views on life - Nume having an eidetic memory and therefore being choosy about his experiences, and Suicide trying to live up to his name. Also a bit of the classic brains vs. brawn, especially when Nume dislocated his wrist punching Suicide. (I&#39;m so on Nume&#39;s side...Nerds for the win!) I do believe Nume came out on top - I mean, he &quot;looked death in the face and quoted canon at it&quot;! That takes a significant amount of awesome. <br>Enough fangirly gushing...thank you for making me laugh!<br></p>

            <p>Wow, I&#39;m really glad that I got interested by that description and went to find the mission. I remember that badfic! I heard about it through Deleterius. It was awful!

            <p>The thing with Suicide is that I know I&#39;d hate him if I met him in real life, but as a character I think he&#39;s interesting. His missions are some of my favorites too. (If Tungsten Monk ever returns, I&#39;ll probably give her equally gushy feedback.) If I met Nume in real lifeâ€¦well, right or wrong, I tend to categorize people who share my fandoms as my friends. I bet he&#39;d hate that - though, would he really mind discussing Star Trek?</p>

            <p>Yeah, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d hang out with Suicide in real life, either. He is a great character, though.<br><br>As for Nume... well, he&#39;d be quite perplexed to learn that he has fans, for starters. He might be open to correspondence, maybe even allowing you to work your way up to the odd cup of coffee now and then if you proved yourself to be sane and not prone to getting into his personal business and/or space. Maybe. But that&#39;s the crucial thing: he has been known to just about get along with people who don&#39;t mind personal boundaries on the level of Fort Knox.<br><br>{= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think Nume might just manage to not-quite hate me, because if he made those personal boundaries clear I wouldn&#39;t push them. At least I don&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t much like to get involved in people&#39;s personal business, let alone space. We&#39;ll have to see how he interacts with Agent Tanya Verde (my self-insert) when we co-write. <br><br>On a sort-of related note, I&#39;ve seen the new picture of Nume on his page. Did you draw that? Because it is really well done. My art skills are nearly non-existant, so when someone can do shading and shadows, I&#39;m impressed. Not to mention that his shirt is done in shades of purple and blue, my two favorite colors. And the Starfleet mug is a nice touch. Bet he&#39;s reading Lord of the Rings, since that and Star Trek are his two primary fandoms. (He&#39;s a TOS fan, Spock is his favorite character, but he thinks Picard is the best captain and is at least familiar with Voyager, since he showed it to Ilraen during the macrovirus epidemic. Did I get that right?) <br>I think I&#39;m rambling. Stop being awesome, Nume! :)</p>

            <p>As for my reaction to this whole thing, it went something along the lines of &quot;Oh my *Gog* this is *awesome*!&quot; (Not to mention hilarious. Well done, everyone!)<br><br>(&#39;Gog&#39; is from Gerald Morris&#39; The Squire&#39;s Tales series, and is not a misspelling--or rather, it&#39;s an intentional one that I&#39;ve taken from one of my favorite book series)<br><br>Not sure I can add anything to all this, but it&#39;s been very enjoyable to read :) (Especially the Aura of Smooth one.

            <p>All the ads for it look like ads for Twilight - some of the posters I&#39;ve seen show the couple clutching each other in a very Bella/Edward pose, she looks like Bella (at least from what I&#39;ve seen - pale, black haired, stick thin, haunted eyes), and it&#39;s a paranormal romance with those traits. Not sure where they&#39;re getting Hunger Games, though. Heavy social commentary doesn&#39;t mix well with teen paranormal romance.</p>

            <p>I tried to read Beautiful Creatures - I made it about fifty pages in before I chucked it away. In my (admittedly not very experienced) opinion, it&#39;s every cliched black and white idea of good and evil and formulaic teen paranormal romance story combined. But since I&#39;m not a fan of romance novels, who am I to complain? <br><br>I would actually like to see &quot;Twilight meets the Hunger Games&quot;.

            <p>I started reading the book, but stopped rather quickly. My basic assessment:<br>Guy sees girl. She&#39;s weird and everyone thinks she&#39;s creepy. They proceed to fall in love. It&#39;s kind of cheesy. Girl has weird family of magic-using-people. She&#39;s freaking out and kind of angsting over if she&#39;s going to become good or became all evil on her birthday or something. Plus a good sprinkling of flashbacks to the civil war involving their ancestors, and since their in the South, being very biased and bashing the North. (I live in PA so that bothered me.) <br>I never finished it, so I guess I can&#39;t get too harsh. But I can be harsh on the movie.<br>If I even bother to go and see it. </p>

So their ancestors were with the Vikings under Harald Hardrada, say, or... er... huh. It&#39;s actually hard to think of deep-historical battles that people don&#39;t have opinions on.

            <p>Hm...I think you may have a point with the werewolves. Actually, I&#39;d probably bet on any type of werewolf (within reason). I mean, does anything besides silver actually stop them? Traditionally speaking, that is.<br><br>Although, without moonlight...the werewolf becomes human. Usually. (See Once Upon a Time, and occasionally fanon Potterverse). So the fight would have to take place during the full moon...<br><br>Although I still think I&#39;d bet on the werewolf. Actually, scratch that, I&#39;d bet on the dragon :D<br><br>(What dragon? That dragon! Up there in the sky! See how it doesn&#39;t sparkle like diamonds? That&#39;s because diamond-sparkles make for terrible camoflage, which is far from useful if you&#39;re a predator)<br><br>(Seriously, what&#39;s up with the Sparklepires? I mean, I get the whole eye-color-changing, speed, strength, attractiveness, not sleeping, not eating human food--all of that. But why would they sparkle in the sunlight, beyond illustrating that their skin is hard? What purpose could it possibly serve? I mean, what normal human--let&#39;s go with the witch-burning period--is going to look at someone sparkling and not run away screaming &quot;Witch! Witch! It sparkles! It is unholy! Burn the witch!&quot; [feel free to imagine the spelling corresponds with that of Agnes Nutter&#39;s in Good Omens if you like]? And even now, they&#39;re most likely to be freaked out. Because, yes, sparkling is pretty, but it&#39;s also very, very strange, and likely to put people off.<br><br>(Unless--brainwave--what if that&#39;s the Sparklepire version of an aversion to sunlight? That they have to avoid the sunlight, not because it burns, but because it makes them, er, sparkle, and that&#39;s a nod to traditional vampires?<br><br>(...it&#39;s still weird and pointless, though.)<br><br>Garlic doesn&#39;t stop Buffyverse vampires, right? If so, I want to see the episode where Xander wards off Angelus with a handful of garlic. Seriously, I can see it--Xander would be very nervous at first, and then he&#39;d realize that it was working, and he&#39;d...probably start taunting Angelus, actually. Ah, IC Xander, how I love thee. (But not in a particularly Lust Object way. Just in a &#39;you are a wonderful canon character and I love it when you&#39;re actually in character and not in a badfic, because you have a tendency to be awesome and hilarious).<br><br>...that&#39;s one of the strangest clarifications I&#39;ve ever made, from an everyday-life perspective. On the other hand, within the PPC...pretty ordinary.<br><br>I hate Buffy badfic. Especially when it consists of Buffy being indecisive about her two secret daughters (one by Angel, one by Spike), and thinking that Spike would make a great father (I mean, he would, but he also really wouldn&#39;t, not without making a LOT of adjustments), and Xander and Willow (and Dawn) being pretty two-dimensional, and not witty at all, and--and--ugh.<br><br>Yup. That&#39;s the one I&#39;ve been dealing with most recently. I don&#39;t like it. I may claim it.<br><br>And both daughters have curly hair and look like their respective fathers. Oh, and they&#39;ve both been activated as Slayers, even though one is four and the other is...two, I think. There&#39;s no way that&#39;s canonical. I mean, from what I know, the Potentials were young--but not *that* young. Then again, I&#39;m only now watching season 7, and I&#39;m not at the Potentials yet. (Me watching Buffy is an...interesting story. I do it out of order, and avoided season 7 for quite a while. Then, I found out that Felicia Day played a Potential, so I got curious and started watching it. It&#39;ll probably end up being the only season that I&#39;ve watched from beginning to end in order).<br><br>Wait, I&#39;ve gone very far off topic, haven&#39;t I? We were talking about vampires vs werewolves...<br><br>I think that, even in Buffyverse, I&#39;d still bet on the werewolf. Unless we&#39;re talking a Master vampire (an IC one, anyway). Someone like Angel/Angelus, Spike, or Darla (not sure about Drusilla) could probably take a werewolf. But if we&#39;re talking run-of-the-mill vampire versus run-of-the-mill werewolf...probably the werewolf.<br><br>We hope you have enjoyed this rambling post, courtesy of DawnFire&#39;s Brain Inc.

            <p>*is bricked for too many MLP references*<br><br>This is going to be awful, totally and truly awful. How do I know it&#39;s going to be awful? Casting, with some storyline problems to boot. Savanna Snow and her dad, the mayor of this small town in South Carolina, are black. Now, I&#39;m not racist, but this small town is. They are a proud center of the Ladies of the Confederacy, Amma has to live outside of town, and there are no other black folks to be seen. So why on earth is the ELECTED MAYOR of this small racist town black? Why is his daughter, who is described in the book as your blonde southern popular girl, who would like to see Lena burned at the stake, black? This alone shows that the movie is going to be bad: because while I&#39;m not racist, the town and the region is, and that is simply the culture of the area that was being presented. The book is completely accurate with its portrayal of small southern town society, and they look over one of the easiest details in the darn casting, simply so people don&#39;t call the film makers racist. Add in the apparent storyline included with the trailers that we have seen, and we get one bad, bad film adaptation. I&#39;m sorry, I am not looking forward to this. AT ALL.<br><br>My father gave a more in-depth review of the film based off the little he has seen as for why it will be gosh darned terable. I&#39;ll see if I can post that later.</p>

            <p>Hi everyone!<br><br>I&#39;ve just finished writing a 40K short story to be submitted to the Black Library in April.  Irish Samurai has kindly had three beta reads of it (yes there were quite a few changes that might have otherwise driven many agents to Bleeprin abuse).

            <p>There was some discussion  <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=238132;">a few threads below</a> about what the Hunger Games minis should be. Several ideas were tossed around, and it seemed that the most popular idea was mini-muttations - the dog creatures from the first book, with the physical traits of the person whose name was misspelled. Can we have a vote? If it seems like a lot of people agree, I&#39;ll add it to the wiki. The minis found seem to have been adopted already: World-Jumper - Peta, DawnFire - Suzan, Rina - Senica. All we need to know is what these people have adopted.<br><br>Also, another thing pertaining to minis that I&#39;ve been thinking about: the minis for Percy Jackson. The wiki lists them as mini-Harpies, however, mini-furies were used in the well-written <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7390116/1/The-Official-Fanfiction-University-of-Olympus">Percy Jackson OFU</a>, and were the first thought of those involved in the goddess co-write. I would suggest changing them, but on the wiki mini-Erinyes (furies) are listed as the minis for Aeschylus, an ancient Greek playwright. My thought is that maybe a mini can be agreed upon for Greek mythology and Greek mythology based canons. Same with the Egyptian mythology mini (mini-Ammets) - it could work just as well for the Kane Chronicles. Discussion?<br></p>

            <p>I was planning on spending my day off this week (Wednesday) by checking for actual story sources for every mini listed on the mini page that didn&#39;t already have one.  (So that I&#39;m not taking credit for others&#39; ideas, I will point out this was at Data&#39;s prodding.<br><br>But everyone who would like to join in and help is more than welcome!  If everyone finds one or two missing links, we can quickly whittle down the number of &quot;parentless&quot; minis.<br><br>Which will lead us, I think, to the next step: removing any entries that don&#39;t have legitimate sources within the PPC or OFU canons.  I don&#39;t want to be stepping on the toes of any past or present PPCer who imagined the concept for such minis (future toes I have no respect for).  However, mini creation is partly a reward for that first writer who sporked a new canon and lived with enough sanity to tell about it.  It&#39;s not a decision to be made after a random engine search turns up some bizarre typo, followed by throwing up a new entry on the wiki.  If nothing else, creating minis through narrative will help the author pick something that will make for good, funny writing.<br><br>After we&#39;ve got our list, we can have a discussion here about the &quot;parentless&quot; mini types.  Maybe?  Or just delete them?  I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m suddenly very sleepy, and fear I may be ranting.  To summarize:<br><br>1. Good shared idea, Data and hermione of vulcan.<br><br>2. Start your search engines and find those missing minis!<br><br>3. The bristle worm spines under the skin of my finger are really annoying.<br><br>4. No more making up minis outside of a mission or OFU publication.<br><br>5. I appear to be stealing hermione of vulcan&#39;s numbered listing from the post I am responding to.  Sorry about that.<br><br>6. No picking up goats, please.<br><br>7. doctorlit fell asleep and became healthy!</p>

            <p>*gets into the list-making theme*<br><br>1. I think point 4. &quot;No more making up minis outside of a mission or OFU publication.&quot; maybe should be added to the mini page, since currently it says &quot;A mini is a creature created by a misspelling usually, though not always, made in fanfics.&quot; So since there are mini-boarders, maybe point out that they are the only minis that can be created on the board?<br><br>2. Per item 6, I&#39;ve put down my goat.<br><br>3. Where would be a good place to report a missionless/OFUless mini or in my case, one with both that never actually named the mini? I know anyone can technically edit the wiki, but that doesn&#39;t mean anyone should. And as new as I am, I&#39;d prefer to simply report any findings to those more familiar with the people/fics involved. :)<br><br>5. Because I don&#39;t feel like 4. today. I would cast my vote for the &quot;parentless&quot; minis to be be deleted, since technically they shouldn&#39;t have been allowed in the first place right? Or as a compromise to those who did add them, they should be moved to their own section which notes they are sourceless and therefore not official, but as an idea those that do write the official OFU or mission might want to use, but are not bound to. Maybe?</p>

            <p>I am leaning towards the deletion of the &quot;parentless&quot; minis as well, but wanted to see if anyone had less dramatic options (like yours) which I couldn&#39;t come up with in my addled-by-sleep-deprivation state yesterday.  (Wow, do I read like a goddam idiot.)<br><br>A &quot;Sourceless Minis&quot; section is a good compromise.  What I was trying and failing to say in my post last night, however, was that we should have a discussion/vote on the Board on each individual &quot;parentless&quot; mini type once we&#39;ve established which minis those are, just so we can get as many members as possible in on those decisions.<br><br>Now I must return to the Realm of Sleep before I start spouting off zoo rules again.</p>

            <p>You don&#39;t. Minis aren&#39;t reported, like badfic, they&#39;re found by agents or students/staff of an OFU. Until someone enters the story, the minis don&#39;t technically exist.<br><br>Think of it like Shrodinger&#39;s Cat, only with fanfiction: Minis are in a perpetual state of limbo until someone enters the wordworld and observes them.

            <p>I meant how would one go about reporting a mini that is already listed on the wiki, but is sourceless, as there was talk of trying to clean up the mini page and get rid of/move the &quot;parentless&quot; ones to a different section. Not how would I report a mini in general. ^_^ <br><br>Such as the Percy Jackson ones that were already mentioned. They are on the wiki, but there has never been a mission to the universe or an OFU written, so they would be removed/moved to a new section. I found another breed like that, and wondered who I would report it to if I didn&#39;t feel qualified to edit the wiki myself yet? (Especially in the case of the mini I found, since there are actually two missions to the universe and an OFU, albeit a very short one, however neither one actually says what the minis are. They just refer to them having been created.)<br><br>Sorry for the confusion!</p>

            <p>There are lots of reasons to create an account and sign in when you edit the wiki!<br><br>1. If you don&#39;t, your IP address shows up, so it&#39;s more secure to have an account.<br><br>2. It&#39;s completely free, and you don&#39;t even need to provide an e-mail address if you don&#39;t want to. It&#39;s also fun!<br><br>3. If you don&#39;t, we have no idea who you are and may not be inclined to take your edits seriously (i.e., we might just undo it instead of talking about it first if there&#39;s a problem).<br><br>4. Not doing so may mean you haven&#39;t read the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki#Helping_out">main page</a> or the PPC Wiki <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Help:Editing#Etiquette_and_Style">etiquette &amp; style instructions</a>, and have possibly ignored automated prompts from PPC Wiki, too. This is a sign that you may have no idea what you&#39;re doing or just don&#39;t care, which always makes people nervous.<br><br>5. If you make a habit of anonymous edits, your IP&#39;s anonymous-user Talk page will receive warnings. If the warnings fail, your IP will be blocked for some period of time. We understand that sometimes you can get logged out accidentally or just forget, but this is a community, and we don&#39;t take kindly to nameless strangers messing with our stuff. If you can&#39;t sign in for some reason, at least identify yourself in your edit summary.<br><br>This has been a Public Service Announcement from your friendly neighborhood Neshomeh.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

On the Board, you just type in your username - if you can make a post at all, it&#39;s just as easy to post your username.

            <p>I remember going &quot;Oh cool, a place to put all the historical stuff we always have trouble looking up!&quot; when it came about, but all the sudden, it seems to be Absolutely Necessary to log all missions, agents, and so on in the Wiki. Which is frustrating.<br><br>(Though I do agree what Neshomeh is saying with regards to people identifying themselves. If people do it by signing edits manually instead of logging in, that&#39;s fine - but a while back, we had a kid doing edit-floods that were nigh-on universally unnecessary and quite often more harm than good, and initially nobody had any idea who he was. I think we&#39;d be equally eyebrow-raising if people clumped around here refusing to sign their posts.)</p>

            <p>I am definitely not the poster child for consistent wiki edits. So anyway, most likely hypocritical since I am fairly certain I <i>don&#39;t</i> have all my stuff on there, BUT I like having a list of all the missions on the wiki. I don&#39;t always keep up with the Board, so I miss missions sometimes. Especially for those missions that are posted with something like Google Docs, the only way to find missions that previously featured the agents I am reading about is through the wiki.<br><br>So I understand how people might not want to edit the wiki, and we shouldn&#39;t be ugly toward them over it, but it is very valuable to have a central location for the mission links, as well. Maybe there could be a system where people that are very nervous about the wiki could ask for help?</p>

            <p>Personally, I hate editing the wiki.  I always feel like I&#39;m about to mess something up, or change the wrong thing, or accidentally blank a page, or... <b>*carries on for several minutes*</b> ...thus causing the downfall of the entire Martian civilisation.  Again.  So, I pretty much wind up editing it as little as possible.  Most of the edits I&#39;ve made have been adding to my primary agent pair&#39;s page.  I haven&#39;t even gotten around to any of my other PPC characters to the wiki, or adding Zombieland minis, or pretty much anything.  I just get way too anxious about it.</p>

            <p>Was it you who said that you hadn&#39;t read all the way through Mockingjay? Then obviously you wouldn&#39;t know about Katniss and Peeta&#39;s children. It&#39;s been some time since I read the series, so I don&#39;t remember if Finnick and Annie have a child or President Snow has a granddaughter. (Actually, that last one sounds interesting to explore. How <i>would</i> you feel if he was your grandpa?)  I&#39;m inclined to believe that these are all legitimate, they just look bad because they were never named in canon.<br>Not that their blank slate status doesn&#39;t make them likely to be Sued, though.</p>

            <p>Guh? Wuh?<br><br>Ok, so they have children. And yes, I&#39;m the one who picked up Mockingjay, read about half a chapter, decided it was more depressing than I wanted to read just then (not to mention that I couldn&#39;t really remember the details of the first two books anymore) and put it down again.<br><br>Hm.

            <p>Sorry about the spoilers DawnFire. I&#39;m going to add to them just a tiny bit though.<br><br>Peeta and Katniss have two children, a boy and a girl, Finnick and Annie have a son and a fleeting mention is made of Snow&#39;s granddaughter. These characters are not really given anymore description than the &quot;other tributes&quot; though. They are named to have existed, but we don&#39;t have any further information on them, names included.<br><br>Considering how aware the the rest of the capital was I would imagine Snow&#39;s granddaughter was actually pretty happy, being the presidents family and all, and blissfully unaware of what was actually happening, or what her grandfather was doing.</p>

            <p>Because I wanted the Minis to be mini-Hydras, with a bib that has their names on it and a new head each time that spelling is used. Oh well.

            <p>The idea is that OFU- or mission-writers in that continuum get to name the minis for a couple of reasons. First, it reserves the privilege for the person who actually goes to the effort of writing said OFU or mission. Second, it prevents the list of minis from getting (even more) artificially inflated by mini types that we&#39;ve never seen mentioned anywhere else and may cause a conflict when someone actually does want to write about them.<br><br>So, while I&#39;d agree with mini-mutts, I don&#39;t think it should go on the wiki until someone actually does something in that continuum.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I know that&#39;s the official take on minis from the wiki, and I don&#39;t disagree with it, creating a mini species is a high privilege, and should be reserved for OFU and first mission writers.

            <p>Minis <i>shouldn&#39;t</i> be created before an OFU or mission is written, because it&#39;s their prerogative. It&#39;s fun to think up minis on the Board, but then what?

            <p>It&#39;s just that there have been minis created and adopted, so I thought we should give them a form. And I have a feeling that someone involved in that conversation (maybe me) will be the first person to write in Hunger Games. <br><br>As to the artificial inflation - it seems that Percy Jackson is a victim of it, considering that the mini listed isn&#39;t from the OFU and there are no missions into Percy Jackson yet.

            <p>I was also thinking along the lines of what hermione seems to have been, that one of the people involved in the discussion would probably end up being the one that wrote the first mission. Heck, I&#39;d do it if I wasn&#39;t not even a week old here yet and therefore not eligible for permission. XD<br><br>That said, since I am new here, I wasn&#39;t sure how minis created on the board worked, and since they were collected, I figured we might be onto a rare situation here that might warrant a slight re-interpretation of the rule in this one case.<br><br>If not, amorphous-wraith minis are shiny or if we go with no non-mission minis, it&#39;s fine. We can pretty much bet the first or second mission will come back with peta and senica minis anyway, although I do vote that Suzan be allowed to stay and just gain form when the first mission gets back just because author minis seem to be rarer. I do whole-heartedly agree with the rule that the first mission/OFU gets that privilege. ^^ I wasn&#39;t trying to rock the boat. ^^<br><br>I also vote for the wiki to be changed in favor of the Percy Jackson OFU minis if there really are no missions yet. (I checked on that too, and was wondering where the mission(s) were at.) And that any others found without a reference be removed too. ^^</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not a Board consensus.  It&#39;s not a PPC decision.  It&#39;s up to whoever writes the OFU or the mission.

            <p>It would be something interesting to explore, though. I mean, the poor mini doesn&#39;t know what it is.

            <p>Thanks for getting this set up for discussion, and clearing up the mini adoption issue. ^^<br><br>Sadly I don&#39;t think I have anything to add to the discussion about Percy Jackson minis. I know OFU&#39;s hold precedence over missions, however if the missions were written first, perhaps it could just be noted that the &quot;official&quot; minis were found at the OFU after the first however many missions. While the mission minis were tied to the Greek mythology base as a whole some how and explain the difference that way?<br><br>I do think I&#39;ll agree with Ellipsis Flood that conforming minis across the board for mythology related universes wouldn&#39;t be ideal. Although you could spin off that thought and note that for mythology universes sometimes minis take a universal form, for a to be thought up later reason, and explain the discrepancy in the Percy Jackson minis that way too?

            <p>Normally mini types are only chosen when someone starts an OFU or writes a mission. I can&#39;t remember if there has been a HG mission.<br><br>The second thing is kind of iffy, since there&#39;s a wide variety of ways to interpret mythology, so I&#39;m against unifying minis there. Not sure what to do with the Percy Jackson thing, since OFUs have priority in mini design.</p>

            <p>Hi, shiny new newbie here (though not the shiniest!) thought I might drop in and say hi and welcome back. :)<br><br>Looks like we have some fandoms in common! I love the Avatar series, though sadly I haven&#39;t had cable or Netflix in a while so I&#39;ve only been able to get through most of the first two seasons, and none of Korra. I live with a big fan of Hetalia, though I&#39;ve not watched a lot of that, I am a big fan of Lord of the Rings and Stargate, both SG-1 and Atlantis! <br><br>In honor of your return I&#39;d like to present you with a working Stargate keychain and a plateful of mockingjay cookies!</p>

            <p>But I think she meant the animals, who were not so much shapeshifters, but they jump seamlessly between being the animal and being a human, and stories are often unclear about which is which. Coyote, for example, disguises himself in one story as a baby, in another as an old man, or an old woman - but sometimes he&#39;s clearly the canine coyote. </p>

            <p>So, yes, I did mean the animals - most of the stories I read portrayed them as being much more intelligent (I thought) than humans.<br><br>And it&#39;s funny you should bring up Coyote, VM - those were always my favorite stories, and are still today. At least, they were the only ones I ever found that eatured coyotes and didn&#39;t rip on them for being sneaks or thieves or called them horrible monsters for eating small baby animals (my grandpa really doesn&#39;t like coyotes...)<br><br>I recently read a story where coyote took the form of a beautiful woman who lost her shoe, and the guy who picked it up was a total creep who told her he&#39;d give it back for a kiss. She walked away without it, and after that any time he tried to pick up a girl or talked to one of the several girlfriends he already had, his shoes would clamp down on his feet until it felt like he was getting bit by a coyote. I forget how the story ended, though...</p>

            <p>Coyote stories are the very best! I started reading and listening to them at about eight, with a massive book of mythologies from my dad. Still love them today, even the ones wherein Coyote is a sneak-thief who gets in trouble for eating that which he should not, or stealing. (My absolute favorite, though, is the one about how the stars got in the sky.)<br><br>Unfortunately, all the Coyote stories I know that involve beautiful women are really far too raunchy for the &#39;Board. &gt;.&gt;</p>

            <p>I know, right? My personal favorite - and the first one I ever read - was &#39;How Coyote Stole Fire&#39;. It was a variation, a less common one from what I&#39;ve seen, but still totally awesome! (How the stars got in the sky? I don&#39;t think I ever read that one! Mine were more about how owl saved a human baby or how fox became so sneaky...)<br><br>Hee, that one I was referring to only gets as nasty as a coyote pretending to be a nekkid woman and the same coyote (a rare female variant, even on all fours) snagging a kiss from the guy later on when she stole HIS shoes. On the mouth, by the way. I cackled.</p>

            <p>You might like <a href="http://www.gunnerkrigg.com/">Gunnerkrieg Court</a> - it&#39;s a webcomic that uses a lot of myths, but the Native American component seems to be one of the heavier influences. <br><br>I&#39;ve often been compared to a hobbit myself, due to my short stature and large appetite.

            <p>Of all the webcomics that I&#39;ve read, there&#39;s only been one where it&#39;s been finished by the time I&#39;ve caught up with it all. <br><br>Going from being able to read a comic all through a lunch break / all evening to getting one or two new pages a week is kind of annoying.<br><br>But even that&#39;s better than finally catching up with the latest page of a comic you like, only to find a note from the author saying it&#39;s been abandoned. <br><br><i>Gunnerkrieg Court</i> is currently one of my favourites.</p>

            <p>Honestly, the only one I remember word-for-word is one of many versions of &#39;How Coyote Stole Fire&#39;.

She&#39;s got a fanfiction featuring her elf-self, Teleri to be exact, as a background character during the time of Maeglin&#39;s story I believe she said.

            <p>Eh, the memory&#39;s a bit fuzzy, but I think it goes sommat like: The Great Creator was walking through all the lands and helping each and every creature become what it wanted to be most - the mountain lion became brave, strong, and the color of dry earth to better hunt his prey, and the little hummingbird became swift and beautiful, such that every creature who looked on him fell in love with his beauty and would not harm him (and he could easily escape from those who tried!)<br><br>The Great Creator eventually came to rabbit, and rabbit wanted to be swift--<br><br>--And owl, who was listening in, jumped in and said he, too, wanted to be swift and strong, even more so than rabbit. The Great Creator told the horned owl to hush and wait his turn, just as all the other animals had done (including the poor rabbit!) Having said this, the Great Creator turned back to rabbit and made her legs long and powerful, so that she could cover much ground in little time.<br><br>The rabbit went on to say she wanted a sleek body and soft, warm fur--<br><br>--And owl jumped in and declared that he wanted brilliantly-colored feathers, a lithe, beautiful body, and long, sweeping wings. Again the Great Creator told the owl to be quiet and wait until He had finished seeing to rabbit&#39;s requests, and this time also told owl his impatience would get him nowhere. Then the Great Creator turned back to rabbit and gave her a sleek body and made her fur as soft as down.<br><br>Rabbit next asked for long, gorgeous ears, elegantly formed and strong enough to hear danger from miles away.<br><br>Owl watched on in silence for a moment as the Great Creator gently pulled rabbit&#39;s ears until they were very long, then shaped them until they were beautiful to rabbit&#39;s eyes. But just as rabbit opened her mouth to ask for one final thing, the owl spoke up again, vainly proclaiming that <i>he</i> would look much prettier than rabbit or any other creature, that he would ask for a beak made of gold and eyes like the stars and a singing voice sweeter than the most beautiful music.<br><br>The Great Creator had had enough of owl&#39;s vanity and selfishness, and turned on the hapless creature in anger. Instead of a long, sleek body, the Great Creator made the owl squat and fat, with a round, blocky head and no neck to speak of. Rather than feathers of every color and eyes like starlight, owl&#39;s feathers were smeared with mud and his eyes, already stretching wide in fear, were turned yellow and given the ability to unsettle all who looked on them for long - so eventually, no one would want to. And instead of a beautiful singing voice, the Great Creator decreed that owl would never sing, and would have to hunt in silence if he was to survive at all.<br><br>The Great Creator <i>did</i> give owl a voice, but in order to keep him from ever interrupting anyone again, the Great Creator made it so that owl could only let out an eerie hoot that chilled even the poor owl to hear; over time, this hoot would become mournful and solemn as the owl eventually came to accept he had brought this upon himself. Last of all, the Great Creator gave <i>owl</i> long ears of his own, so he could listen twice as well as he would ever speak.<br><br>This finished, the Great Creator finally released the owl, whom he now named the horned owl as a final form of punishment. Then He turned and went off in search of poor rabbit, who had fled when the Great Creator first turned on the horned owl. To His dismay, rabbit was nowhere to be found. She never did come out of hiding - the Great Creator&#39;s fury gave her one last, unfortunate characteristic: She would ever after be fearful of all other creatures, and would ever after be the first to flee from any sign of danger.<br><br>...Or something like that. I think one or two details might have gotten a little muddied up; it&#39;s been about ten years since I read the story, but it <i>feels</i> pretty accurate...<br><br><br>SO MANY MUCH PICTURES AH MAH GUH.<br><br>Totally with you on the balance problems. Ask anyone at my old high school why I always got picked last for basketball (and NO, it is not because I ran through a basketball game while chasing a classmate I had a crush on when I was in the fourth grade. That is total poppycock.)<br><br>Ah, okay, that makes sense! XD (Any idea where I might find that fanfic, by the way? It sounds fun!)</p>

            <p>Some lessons just have to be learned the hard way. Poor rabbit though! And poor me, I&#39;m going to be forever curious what her last request was!

XD<br><br>As to her fic, I&#39;ve been told I got it wrong. XD Her elf-self shows up at the end and gets the story from the Teleri elf, but it&#39;s actually a different elf that is her main character in the fic. And it spans from around the time of Maeglin to the Battle of Five Armies. I got the main characters mixed up with a different story she was writing that her elf-self is in, but that one&#39;s not really a fanfic, so much as it borrows the professor&#39;s world, but doesn&#39;t interact with his characters, other than brushing up against them in that they are named as present during certain recorded events.<br><br>Anyway, as the the real first one, that is a fanfic, and &quot;public&quot; She said she&#39;ll see about posting it somewhere public so you could read it, even though it&#39;s still a few inches from complete. But she&#39;s kinda shy about her work so right now, it&#39;s just been distributed privately for her friends to read. ^^</p>

            <p>I decided, just to double check, the PPC page again. there was something there that interested me that I had seen, but have never really looked at before. It was a link connecting to the tropes page for The Anti-Cliche and Mary-Sue Elimination Society. So recently I have been reading up on The Society and what they do, and I am pretty impressed. <br><br>Actually, I&#39;m really impressed. They have a very comprehensive history, storyline and, well, society. The similarities between it and the PPC are many, yet there are some clear differences. The PPC tends to be more... comedic I suppose is the best word, though we have the ability to be serious if necessary for the story. It just is rarely necessary. The Society is also very comedic, but is often more dramatic than the PPC usually is. Is this good or bad for either side? Absolutely not, but it is different.<br><br>After reading some more and drawing connections, I decided to make this post for multiple reasons.<br>One: I wanted to know the PPC&#39;s position on the Society. Have many boarders even heard of them before, and what they think on The Society and their group. <br>Two: I was thinking about a potential crossover. The two are very different, but have very similar motives: to spork bad fanfiction. If there were some badfic that was so mind-numming, canon breaking, grammatically failing, all around BAD, that the two sides actually come across each other to kill the same fic. This discovery could later be explored as the two share experiences, technology and potential rivalries. I have already thought of a few things that could be done with a crossover, but I wanted to see what the rest of the board thought about the potential, or wether it has been discussed before.<br><br>Just some food for thought. This is not saying I have joined the other side or anything, just want to spur discussion. Besides, the PPC has at least one thing that I prefer over The Society. Our board is much nicer than their forum. Just saying.</p>

            <p>Are you saying you are from the Society, or am I misinterpreting? Because if you are, awsome, this little idea may well work! We would both have to get permission first, but if we have someone willing to talk to and interact between the two sides, it seems even more likely to overturn the previous desision of &#39;nah.&#39;</p>

            <p>If it was an official decision then yeah, I&#39;ll leave it alone.<br><br>After reading some more on them, I must admit, the idea that they use made up badfic is a little strange. Why spend the time to make a Mary Sue when so many just sit there, waiting to be killed? Still, they HAVE done existing badfic before, it&#39;s just usualy an old badfic that the author wants to see killed. So, because of that it would theoreticaly be possable, but if it was officialy decided to leave eachother alone then fine.<br><br>Oh they are still active, believe me. They have a 4chan-esk forum that is still being used, as well as new stories continuing to be cranked out. And yes, they are a little OP for my taste. Ok, sometimes realy OP, to the point of some missions reading as &quot;Mary Sue kills Mary Sue.&quot; Still, not all of them are Sues and Stus, and lets be honest, we have had our share of over powered agents before. Admittedly most of our Sueish agents are reformed and have to struggle to stay just below the line, but still, we have been guilty of being too powerful as well.<br><br>Oh, I know I would need permission first before acting on the idea, from both sides. This was more throwing out the idea and seeing if it was any good, so that if it was of any interest to someone with permission, or if I got said permission, it could be furthered. This would change the dynamics of both sides, and without clear consensus and even ability to write for either side, there was no way it could or should be done. However, if nobody thought it was a good idea, it would just wither and die. At the moment it seems to be choking, though not dead yet per-se.</p>

            <p>As to why writing about &#39;artificial&#39; Mary Sues instead of finding them - there have been PPCers who did that, for different reasons.

            <p>I never said they were wrong in making their own badfics, I just said it was strange. Than again, I am a sadistic bastard on the internet, so that may have something to do with it. I see the missions we do as half entertainment, and half criticism (OK, more like 80% entertainment, 20% criticism, but whatever) and provides a semi-useful service through the criticism they give. That is why I enjoy the PPC as much as I do; because it backs up the reasons for tearing down in a humorous manner. When you make your own badfic to spork, you are creating a comentary rather than a criticism. While the killings can be entertaining, it does not have the same effect using an actual badfic does, for me at least. So that is why I said it was strange.</p>

The mission or sporking being shown to the author as a criticism is not something I would be in favor of - unless what you mean is that other people, by reading it, are less likely to make the same mistakes.

            <p>I am a firm believer in constructive criticism, and do not think ripping a story to shreds and laughing at the remains is the proper way to tell a writer how to correct their stories. However, as an editor, I am infamous for being very direct with my criticism. Not mean or rude, mind you, but direct. I don&#39;t sugar coat much of anything, and I make sure the author understands what is wrong and why I think it should be changed. I once got in trouble for editing a foreign exchange student&#39;s story in a creative writing class. Her spelling was fine, but her grammar and phrasing left much to be desired. The sentences were understandable, but were phrased and structured incorrectly. When I showed her the edits I made, I told her to make sure she finds a good editor, one who would not be afraid to tell her she is wrong, even though she is from a foreign country and english is her second language. How is she going to learn how to do it right if she never sees when she was wrong? She was thankful, but one of my other classmates chewed me out for being &#39;inconsiderate.&#39; &quot;If it  makes sense,&quot; he said, &quot;then just leave it alone!&quot; While in the end we agreed to disagree, it showed me that I thought, occasionally, you need to see the truth about what you wrote, no matter how much others don&#39;t want to see it. So occasionally, I think a charge list is helpfull for authors to know what exactly they did wrong, so they can learn how to fix it.<br><br>/end rant. Good greif, sometimes I just chatter on and on for no reason. Oh well.</p>

For example, adding the PPC to TVTropes - and specifically, the way it was originally done - was something that a lot of people had a lot of opinions on, but they were never given a chance to voice those. The last thing you want is to find out after the fact that people are upset about the decision.<br><br>So yes. Asking about this stuff - always a good idea.</p>

            <p>Yeah, the PPC doesn&#39;t tend to <i>have</i> a general consensus on things.  It&#39;s one of the things I love about this place.<br>Individual opinions?  Tons of them.  Group consensus?  As a general rule? Nope.</p>

            <p>Usually, when a thing comes up for discussion, there is... an overwhelming amount of discussion, by anyone/everyone and their grandmother, and two weeks later, when half of us have forgotten what we were talking about in the first place and the rest of us are -mostly- in agreement, the thread drops off the &#39;Board, and somebody writes a wiki article with the almost-consensus and the arguments for/against.

            <p>I have found many fanfic authors who write Mary-Sue killing parodies, usually called something like &quot;The Mary-Sue Slayer&quot;, or something else vicious. But, actual organization is very rare. I&#39;ve never heard of this &quot;Society&quot;. I had this idea, though. It would be interesting if some of our Agents ran into a &quot;Slayer&quot; of some sort, and confusion ensues. It might be even more interesting if this character was a member of a large organized group, resulting in a lot of possibilities. I think since the PPC aren&#39;t the only people sporking badfic, we might want to make that part of our canon. Sounds like fun to me!<br>Also curious. How many of them have heard of us? How active are they? I&#39;m going to go snoop around their wiki...</p>

            <p>Well, I was on the wiki recently when I stumbled across an old talk page about the two. Apparently someone made a wiki page for The Society on our wiki, as well as a PPC page on their wiki. While the two communities were similar, because there was no official crossover made, they bolth decided to delete the pages, the potential crossover never spoken of again. I supose the two groups know of eachother, they just don&#39;t interact. Oh well, I was hopeing on exploring a potential extension to bolth of our worlds. Who knows, it may yet happen anyway, but it seems the historical feeling is &quot;meh.&quot;<br><br>...I realy wanted to see what DoSAT would do with their technology though. Have you seen some of their toys? They&#39;re hilarious, and usefull. However, they don&#39;t have CAD&#39;s, consoles or disguise generators, amoung other PPC spesific creatures and technologies, so they could benefit too. Still, I&#39;ll wait and see what the board says before thinking too much on the crossover.</p>

            <p>I went poking around last night. I ended up shuffling things around a bit, because there were some odd arrangements of categories in categories in the original categories, and stuff where it didn&#39;t belong, and...<br><br>Never mind.<br><br>Anyway! If you check out the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category%3AWebsites">Websites</a> category, you&#39;ll note the presence of pages for GAFF, Deleterious, and Sue Report[s]. There&#39;s also the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category%3ATrans-dimensional_Organisations">Trans-dimensional Organisations</a> category, which includes the Fanfic Universities. I think something about the ACMSES would fit in the latter categoryâ€”I mention the various websites to show that we do have pages for other Canon Protection Initiative things that aren&#39;t us and may or may not be formally affiliated.<br><br>I think other people need to weigh in on this, given the strongly felt opposition to having a page about the ACMSES before, but that&#39;s my two cents.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Well then, I think you know what my vote goes for. The problem last time was that the wiki was intended as a &quot;guide for the PPC,&quot; and because of the lack of official interaction between the two groups, it was removed because of supposed irrelevance. I think connecting to other Mary Sue hunters on either the trans-dimentional organizations page or on the websites page would be helpful, as we serve very similar purposes, and if they like our missions, perhaps they would enjoy others. Besides, I&#39;m still up for a crossover with SOMEBODY in the multiverse of Sue slayers, as the confusion and chaos would be very, very funny. So yeah, I vote add them to the pages, however you all think would be best.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s actually been <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Claimed_Badfic#Death_Note%20">claimed</a> , although I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen AnnaBee around here for quite a while though. <br><br>And it&#39;s got to be a troll, I just can&#39;t believe that it could be that bad by accident.

            <p>Once your brain shuts down, reboots, and accepts that the entire thing makes no sense, it&#39;s wonderful for the comedy value. Although before I got to that stage I reached the level of sanity that generally accompanies yelling at a computer at a public library. <br><br>I had a point, though. The line was something like &#39;and then she naked.&#39; and i felt compelled to ask (or yell...) how exactly a person WOULD &#39;naked.&#39; <br><br>This is why some things cannot be used as verbs. </p>
