            <p>The circumstances (memory-lossed friends, last of their kind, etc) sort of matched up.<br><br>And <i>thank you</i>, so much. Here it is.<br><br>-------<br><br>Will recognises the sound from the Book of Gramarye, but it takes him a moment to place it, time enough for the blue box to finish materializing and eject its occupant, messy-haired and babbling at the speed of light.<br><br>“ -- You wouldn’t have felt it, of course, Donna, but anyone time-sensitive would have noticed the disturbance, I mean, a whole race -- ”<br><br>He sees Will and stops, startled. “Old One,” he says, after a pause.<br><br>“Time Lord.” He inclines his head slightly.<br><br>“And this is Donna. Donna, meet -- ” He glances to his left and visibly deflates. “Oh. Right. Gone.” His smile is brittle now, broken. “Alone again.”<br><br>His eyes are sad, Will finds himself noticing, old and sad and heavy with the weight of the universe. He has never met the Doctor before, but he has heard tales, and the echoes of the Time War made their way even here, for all those sensitive enough to hear it. The Old Ones didn’t interfere, Earth-bound and preoccupied with their own, more understated struggle as they were.<br><br>At last Will says, uselessly, “Our battle with the Dark. That was the disturbance you felt. The Light and the Dark, and now they’re all gone and no-one remembers.”<br><br>“So you’re the last, then, too? All alone in the universe, just like me. At least your people left by choice.”<br><br>“Who is Donna?” he asks tentatively.<br><br>“A-- a friend. My best friend. She was brilliant.” The grin wavers helplessly, and then shatters. “She saved the world, you know. The universe, even. And then she had to forget, to save her life, and she can’t ever remember or she’ll die.”<br><br>“Simon and Barney and Jane and Bran -- none of them remember,” he offers, trust for trust, story for story. “And Bran, he chose to forget, to be human, and so it hurts the worst, with him.”<br><br>A bitter twist of his lips. “They always leave, in the end.” And then what Will now knows to be a mask slips back over the Doctor’s face, and his grins widely, invitingly. <br><br>“Well, Old One, what do you say? Fancy an adventure?”<br><br>----<br><br>Thanks again!<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;d forgotten the memory-loss in <i>Silver</i>, so it&#39;s a good thing you made it obvious that&#39;s an actual thing...<br><br>We&#39;ll start with the easy SPG-type stuff, and there isn&#39;t a lot of it. You might want to lowercase the very first letter of the Doctor&#39;s first line - that &#39;-- You&#39; - to give the feel of an ongoing run-on sentence. And in his later line, &#39;So you’re the last, then, too?&#39;, the &#39;too&#39; is redundant with the (more informative) &#39;just like me&#39;, so could be cut. And... that&#39;s all I&#39;m spotting.<br><br>On the characterisation: the Doctor is spot on, I think. I like the way his mask keeps slipping on and off - it&#39;s very well done (and accurate).<br><br> Will... not so sure. It&#39;s that &#39;and now they&#39;re all gone and no-one remembers&#39; line. Like I say, it&#39;s been a long time, but... at this point, is he that maudlin? Later you justify it with &#39;trust for trust&#39;, which is a brilliant line, but that first one - I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s a good line, but I don&#39;t know how good a fit it is for Will Stanton. The rest of the line is perfect, it&#39;s just that final clause I&#39;d recommend a second look at. And on the flip side, the &#39;all gone&#39; nature of the line is actually a reply to the Doctor, in a way, so maybe it does work...<br><br>The style, because this story has a very specific style: it works. I like the terse description (&#39;A bitter twist of his lips&#39;), and the frequent lack of names or dialogue tags. I don&#39;t think it would be sustainable over a long story, but at this length, it works very well.<br><br>And now we come to my main, indeed only, issue with the piece: the Doctor&#39;s first few lines. We just recently rewatched <i>Partners in Crime</i>, which starts with the Doctor in exactly this situation - he&#39;s in the TARDIS, babbling about something science-fiction-y, and then he stops, because there&#39;s no-one to listen.<br><br>But I don&#39;t think he would fall into the depths of illusion you seem to be writing. Here you have him not just absently babbling to Whoever, but full-on believing Donna&#39;s right there - to the point of trying to introduce her to Will. I just... can&#39;t see it.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;m wrong, and there&#39;s something in... what was next, <i>Planet of the Dead</i>?... that shows he would do this. But barring that, I don&#39;t think it works.<br><br>Well, the first line can probably stay as it is. Dropping a name in there isn&#39;t too much of a problem. But the introduction... actually, I&#39;d just cut it down to &#39;And this is...&#39;, and then the glance. Thinking specifically about Donna (rather than about the disturbance) would trigger the memory. And you only lose half a line.<br><br>Finally, the plot: I love the plot. I love the idea of the TARDIS being in the Book of Gramarye (and I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve checked that spelling, because I can&#39;t). I love the idea of those two meeting. And I love the notion of Will Stanton as a temporary Companion for Ten. They would be a perfect mismatch of personalities.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That was wonderful and detailed and very, very helpful. (As well as flattering.) <br><br>I have taken all your advice, and am currently trying to figure out a way to redo that sentence without making Will seem maudlin. Because he definitely isn&#39;t. I was thinking instead of &#39;and now they&#39;re all gone and no-one remembers,&#39; I could put something like &#39;and I stayed behind to be Watcher.&#39; Maybe.<br><br>When I was writing the bit with the Doctor&#39;s babbling, I was actually thinking of the prequel to the Narnia-inspired Christmas episode, when Eleven was talking to an empty TARDIS as though Amy and Rory were still there. *shrugs* It appears he does that a lot.<br><br>Also, about the TARDIS in the Book of Gramarye. I sort of figured that, what with his interfering tendencies and human favoritism, a certain Time Lord would have gotten himself noticed. He&#39;s not exactly subtle, after all.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>I happened to mention the PPC to a brony friend of mine, and he immediately begged me to report this fic. I&#39;m not quite sure what to make of it, myself- the mechanics seem good and the prose is only a bit purple, but it&#39;s really quite unbelievably angsty and the characters seem very flat. I&#39;m not familiar enough with the series to make an OOC determination, though. Take a look at &quot;My Little Dashie&quot;:<br><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/1888/my-little-dashie"><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/1888/my-little-dashie">http://www.fimfiction.net/story/1888/my-little-dashie</a></a><br></p>

            <p>Unfortunately, your request does not meet PPC standards for badfic. We apologize for the inconvenience and misunderstanding. <br><br>OK, let me explain what I mean. As the head of the All Purpose My Little Pony division (with a grand total of zero missions...currently) and hardcore brony, I feel properly qualified to say that this is not badfic.<br><br>For the amount of canon it breaks: Not much. So the main character is practically the definition of angst. So Rainbow Dash is dragged into the human world with the rest of the six in tow a mere 16 years later. So what if this is blatant wish fulfillment. The character of Rainbow Dash is, relatively, kept in character. In fact, the dad makes a point to make sure she has all the skills she had from the show, as well as the personality. She has one or two moments that are questionable for Rainbow, though not wholly improbable. Add in that the main character seems to experience some growth through this story, and while is whinier than most people I know, he seems a relatively innocent character. Stu he aint. This story just does not commit enough crimes against canon to warrant a mission. Sorry.</p>

            <p>From what I can see the only real problem would have to be the borderline Angsty stu human who&#39;s life outlook changes when he raises a surrgoate daughter figure. But then agian this is common in canon meida if you don&#39;t belive me watch &quot;Man on fire&quot; or play &quot;The Last of Us.&quot; I say borderline because while he did teach Rainbow to be Rainbow he didn&#39;t do the excpted stu thing and go on a roaring rampage and beat up the other mane 5 and Celstia. A heartwarming story and a possible agent material for a FiM divsion if there is one</p>

            <p>Well, I tend to consider &quot;becoming a parent improves/mellows/matures/completes you&quot; to be a chargeable offense in its own right, as bad characterization and/or psychology (with cultural/ideological overtones, no less!). Of course, it can be handled well, but my default answer is charge. I sort of skimmed the fic in question so I don&#39;t know for certain, but it seems long and emotionally invested enough to make it work.<br><br>I kind of came into this thinking I&#39;d just be a loyal advocate for Ray, but you do have a point.</p>

            <p>...is that those are both <i>really</i> difficult charges to employ against a fic when you&#39;ve only seen part of the picture. If you&#39;re going to charge for both, it&#39;s usually a <i>much</i> better idea to wait until you have a clearer idea of what the whole picture is, particularly since a large number of fics towards which bad characterization/psychology apply normally don&#39;t get <i>really</i> bad about those two things until later.<br><br>So I dunno. I think that with this one, you very much jumped the gun here. There are cases where it&#39;s obvious that it&#39;s a Suefic, but this is one of those cases where, if you <i>did</i> find something you felt was wrong, you might have to dig a little deeper than &quot;skimming&quot;.</p>

            <p>Okay, several things. First, I&#39;m really looking forward to OFWho, and I have one character application filled out for you. I just also wanted to give you one or two really fanbratty characters as well as my semi-serious one (she&#39;s a bit of an experiment), which is why I haven&#39;t sent the email off yet. Let me know if you only want the one, if you want me to send them off as I complete them, or if you&#39;d prefer all three together; I don&#39;t know where you are in the writing. Also--this is in the email, but I don&#39;t know when you&#39;ll be getting the email--if you ever need guest PPC agents, I have a Gallifreyan-born Time Lady and her Klingon partner (and her TARDIS) who can be volunteered.<br><br>Secondly...Karen and I hereby volunteer to take on the (enjoyable) task of writing the Supernatural OFU. Because one is necessary, and no one seems to have written one yet. (Also because we&#39;re both definite fans of the series). So...good news, I guess? :D<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>It would be great to have guest agents. So far, I&#39;ve only got one agent helping out.<br>Supernatural OFU? Yes! I&#39;ll be eagerly awaiting for the chance to submit a character. I wonder if we could do a collaboration between the OFUWho and the future Supernatural OFU and Lily Winterwood&#39;s Sherlock OFU. It would be a crossover that a lot of people would want to see.

I have long been a fan of your MSTs (as I have already told Drew), and am honored by your very presence--okay, okay, what I mean is, it&#39;s nice and very exciting to meet you, and I&#39;m flailing again. And you both live in Canada, which is insane, because I do too. Um. Also, you sound like you and Karen would/will get along fairly well, just judging from your introduction here.<br><br>So. Hi. I&#39;m DawnFire. Nice to meet you! Here, have some Swiss Bleepolate and...hm, what type of...oh, of course. Here, also have some Gummyblee Cheeses (the round version). Er, assuming you still like cheese...<br><br>Are you still doing MSTs (or planning to do more), or are you firmly in the writing part of the fanfic world now?<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Nice to meet you too! Sanks for the cheese! The blue elf will always accept the gift of cheese!<br><br>As for MSTs, I&#39;m hoping to get it going again, which is why I&#39;m happy there are hot dwarves for the Sues to latch onto. Hands me material to work with on a silver platter and less searching for me. The thing is, I&#39;m also trying to find employment, so not sure when it will get started. But it is in the plans.<br><br>It surprises me and it doesn&#39;t how fanfiction Sue authors never change. I mean, Twilight itself is a self created world for the Sue. (HATE TWILIGHT!!) The only thing that&#39;s good about Twilight, is it got published; gives me hope that I&#39;ll get published some day too.</p>

            <p>Hi guys!  I see a few familiar names and a whole stack of new ones!  For those of you that don&#39;t know me, I&#39;m Drew, sister to Al&#39;s Waiter.  We MST Sues.  We used to be very active here on the forums, and in the PPC world in general.  Jay (original PPC) and I had even started writing something together.  <br><br>Anyhoo, life got busy and I kind of fell off the internet for... almost ten years.  But, I&#39;m not dead!<br><br>And a few years ago (ok, a lot of years ago!) we (AW and I) started our own original fic about the Fellowship in modern-day Canada. We had three chapters written and posted, and notes for the rest of the story. Then it got stuck. It has been revived! and chapter 4 is up and posted on ff.net!  Also, just so you don&#39;t think, &quot;Oh, one chapter, and then another 8 years of silence.&quot;  No!  The story is complete, and is only pending edits and a beta before being posted.  Feel free to drop in.  <br><br>To be honest, we&#39;re really hoping for reviews, because, well, feedback is food to a writer&#39;s soul.<br><br>Here&#39;s the link to chapter 1, so you can get up to speed.  <br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1088043/1/The-Fellowship-of-the-Urn"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1088043/1/The-Fellowship-of-the-Urn">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1088043/1/The-Fellowship-of-the-Urn</a></a><br><br>Enjoy!<br><br>~Drew</p>

            <p>Hi, Drew.  We&#39;ve never met, what with you disappearing 5-ish years before I got here.  It is a pleasure to meet you, and I am glad that you are not only not dead, but also getting back to some unfinished projects.  Both of those are generally considered to be good things.  Someone is bound to be interested in your story, and feedback is almost guaranteed once you have their interest.<br><br>Please accept this bag of multi-faceted random number generators as a return gift.

            <p>It is not. My sister and I checked the author&#39;s profile with the author&#39;s notes of a chapter posted at the same time and the information matches up too closely for it to be a troll putting random crap together. Here it is:<br><br>From the author&#39;s note in chapter twelve - <i>sorry i ditched u guys for so long,, i visited my bro he just move in buffalo and i spent lots of tim at the waldin galleria witch is a WAY better mall then we have in canada, they even have a dsw and also a maceys and a cheese cake factorey! i cold totally live at that mall! also i saw the sabres but they lost.</i><br><br>From the author&#39;s profile - <i>I got 2 yonger brother and 2 sister and also way older brother she has a wife from flordia and they got maried 2 and a hlaf years ago and they live just over the river in buffalo new york near the walden galeria (the big mall) so i go there for cheese cake factory </i><br><br>She updated her profile and that chapter within the same time frame.<br><br>Also, there&#39;s a recurring theme through the fic of her being a &quot;good Christian girl&quot; who doesn&#39;t hang out with boys, and on her profile she has links to blogs that a quick search confirms support that idea. <br><br>She also has a <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/4257895/amynoelle96">cousin</a> on fanfiction.net, which means one of two things. <br>1. One person can set up two accounts on fanfiction.net and the troll has gone to the effort of doing it for no purpose whatsoever - <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9122910/1/T-Ashlynn-the-Daughter-of-Picard">their co-written fic</a> isn&#39;t being updated and while still bad, doesn&#39;t look troll-like.<br><br>or<br><br>2. &quot;Shaundrah&quot; and &quot;Amy&quot; are real people.<br><br>Either the troll is <i>really</i> dedicated, or this is actually for real.

            <p>I have a link to it that I check periodically. It certainly qualifies as a Bleepfic, possibly contending for Legendary if enough people remember it. So, when the mission comes, it needs to be one to remember. I&#39;m not sure just what type of end would be fitting for this &#39;Sue - but something that involves showing her what some of the OOC characters are actually like might be in order (there isn&#39;t exactly a lack of OOC characters to choose from...).<br><br>I really want to see this thing noted as a Legendary Badfic; it is just *that* painful.</p>

            <p>Which characters do you think are character replaced? All of them are OOC, but they aren&#39;t all gone. For example, Harry has a canonical history of falling for the wrong people, so falling for a Mary Sue isn&#39;t too OOC.<br><br>I think Seven, because she&#39;s gone completely evil, Naomi, because she&#39;s been aged and personality changed beyond all recognition, Q Junior, because he&#39;s a powerful being and very OOC, and maybe Chakotay, because he&#39;s been de-aged. Vorik - for the one chapter he appears - could be possessed. Everyone else is just character ruptured - except for Tuvok, who feels obligated to state that something is logical or illogical every line because he&#39;s clinging to the logic by his fingernails.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure how to kill her either - in the early chapters, I was planning to strangle her with Red Vines, because she seems to have a strange obsession with them, but she backed off of that and now it doesn&#39;t seem appropriate.<br><br>And I&#39;m still not sure what to do with my agents anyway.</p>

            <p>Evil!Seven is definitely a replacement, and I can&#39;t really judge the likes of Q Junior or Naomi because I don&#39;t know their characters well enough.<br><br>The Borg Queen could be debated between replaced and ruptured, depending on whether you counted her actual appearance (very much ruptured, but not quite replaced) or the behaviour of the rest of the Collective (particularly Seven, although there is also debate about whether she is connected or not).<br><br>I agree that the rest would be a case of ruptured/possessed.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s see... if I were to make my criticism constructive, I&#39;d suggest first off explaining what a Mary Sue is and why they are bad, with the appropriate links to litmus tests, well-developed characters, etc. I&#39;d also suggest that the author has a decent enough job of describing things, but that she needs to spread it around a bit more appropriately to convey the right amount of relevance. It IS good that Elliot seems to have a normal family life and isn&#39;t too imperious, but if the folks aren&#39;t going to be relevant later on, I&#39;d suggest not including them (maybe put the beginning scene on the Hogwarts Express, so she can still interact with her brother, and relegate the events at home to just &quot;my letter was delayed. By the time it finally came, I was wondering if Hogwarts was even interested in me.&quot; or something like that. That, and some of the phrasing is awkward, but that&#39;s easy to change in a drafting process. The... many... ellipses and sort of backwards-seeming dialogue attribution I&#39;d actually keep in- with more practice, and as long as the author worked to stretch her wings a little and use structures OTHER than those, it could develop into a distinctive personal style without being distracting.</p>

            <p>Surely the ending of Part 2 will be the death of Smaug and the burning of Lake Town.

            <p>There we disagree. The title is The Desolation of Smaug, not the death of. We see the damage a dragon has on the environment including the ruined city of Dale. There is plenty of plot to fill in movie two: Beorn, Mirkwood, Lake Town, getting to the Mountain and meeting up with the dragon, not to mention the side plot with the Necromancer. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re get to the battle with Smaug. That seems too close to the ending of the book, plot wise, imo. Maybe mid-movie 3, then have all the bickering and the back again.<br><br>We all know PJ can flesh out plot and move bits around, IE moving Shelob to Return of the King because of timeline match ups.<br><br>Just my theory.<br><br><br>~AW~<br>Yes, I was Elrond as well as Sam and Gandalf if memory serves me right.

            <p>... that would make it <i>more</i> likely for them to shunt the battle with the Necromancer into Part 3, since otherwise Gandalf would be absent for the first 2/3 of Part 3.<br><br>Let&#39;s see... of the 19 chapters in the book, Part 1 covered chapters 1-6, roughly. I&#39;d actually forgotten they <i>were</i> covering Beorn, but since he&#39;s in the trailers... you&#39;re suggesting Part 2 covers chapters 7-12, leaving 7 chapters for Part 3. I&#39;m suggesting Part 2 is 7-14, leaving the last 5 for Part 3. Although, looking at the way it breaks down, Chapter 13 could be pushed forward to after 14 - it covers the finding of the Arkenstone and the absence of Smaug, while 14 covers Smaug&#39;s death and doesn&#39;t set foot in the Mountain. I think the Arkenstone should definitely be found in Part 3, since it fits better thematically with the B5A leadup.<br><br>... you know what? There&#39;s an easier way to do this: painstaking analysis! I&#39;ve just run through the trailer scene by scene.

Or maybe a lot of it&#39;s flashback to when they decided not to.<br><br>Anyway, it seems you&#39;re probably right. ;) They definitely meet Smaug, but there&#39;s no evidence of him dying (other than the fact that I remember reading in the mythical Somewhere that Cumberbatch isn&#39;t in Part 3). But equally, there&#39;s no evidence of a major battle in Dol Guldur - just Gandalf fighting a few half-seen things.

            <p>You can argue that they used some of Lake Town burning scenes in the most recent HobbitVlog, meeting up with Bard, equals battle with Smaug, but they had shown the Dwarves in barrels before when they thought that there was only going to be two movies, but then moved that back. PJ does hold a tight grip on what gets released and what doesn&#39;t (or at least the studio does). They don&#39;t want to have too many spoilers out too far in advance.<br><br>BUT, Benedict is showing up on IMDB as being in both the Desolation of Smaug and To There and Back again. So there are arguments for both.<br><br>I am getting some information from a Hobbit podcast that they really analyse a LOT of plot and they&#39;ve been doing it for over a year. If you&#39;re interested, have a look.

            <p>As I recall the plot, Bilbo only meets Smaug once. He goes into the mountain three times - once to get the cup, the second time to talk, and the third time to eventually find the Arkenstone. It&#39;s that second meeting that leads directly to Smaug attacking Lake Town.<br><br>I don&#39;t know. Maybe they&#39;ve put Smaug into the first trip inside, but not let him see Bilbo.

            <p>I would also like a Tempting Fate moment, and by the looks of the Trailer, I think it might happen.<br>I also hope that Legolas&#39;s screen time is limited, because 1. the book is about the  13+1 company, and 2. he is not mentioned in the books.<br>I would also enjoy seeing the lair of Smaug (and Smaug himself)<br>Now, what I would absolutely hate (with a burning passion) is if Tauriel goes off and gets married to Legolas (or has a relationship with him - most elvish lovers get married, it seems).

            <p>Tauriel is not going to have a romantic relationship with Legolas. They are fellow warriors who know each other well - she&#39;s the captain of the king&#39;s guard and he&#39;s the prince, it&#39;s not so extraordinary that they&#39;d spend a fair bit of time around each other. As friends. Which is totally possible between a male and a female without Teh Romance butting in.<br><br>In the original written lore of Tolkien, it was not out of the question for Elven women to be warriors - it was just that the majority of them <i>chose</i> not to be, in favour of healing or the like, just as many men chose to be warriors but some went into healing instead. Galadriel was apparently a decent warrior herself for some time, back in the Silmarillion era. Not to mention, Elves live long enough lives that they can retrain any time they want, if they choose to. For example, Elrond has been a warrior - he was raised during the last years of the First Age, saw the destruction of Eregion, and was Gil-galad&#39;s standard-bearer in the Last Alliance - and still took to healing and study with enough dedication that by the end of the Third Age he&#39;s one of the most renowned physicians in Middle-earth and considered to be Frodo&#39;s only chance after the hobbit got stabbed with a Morgul-blade.<br><br>I do agree with the fact that Legolas should show up - as others have said, the Woodland Realm is his home and he&#39;s quite involved with the running of it, being a warrior and the king&#39;s son and responsible enough to be sent with the Fellowship several decades later.<br><br>Apologies for the wall o&#39;text.

            <p>Given that they were always going to be fleshing out Mirkwood (because people like Elves ;)), I have no objections to a female warrior. As Cassie says, the Lady Artanis was an excellent fighter - and one of the only Noldor to fight <i>against</i> Feanor at the Kinslaying in Alqualonde. Aredhel, Turgon&#39;s sister, was also a fighter. The divide isn&#39;t between male and female - it&#39;s between fighter and healer, since the Elves had a notion that killing actually reduced your skill/power/capacity for healing. Of course, Tolkien was a Victorian-Edwardian, so yeah, he wrote the fighters as men and the healers as women (mostly) - but the idea of equality is entirely there.<br><br>I <i>do</i> have two objections to Tauriel, though...<br><br>1/ She&#39;s a redhead. Not only is that cheap shorthand for &#39;feisty&#39;, which Peter Jackson should know better than, it&#39;s also incredibly rare among the Eldar. The <i>only</i> known line of redheads is the descendents of Mahtan - specifically his daughter Nerdanel, and at least one of her children, Maedhros. And if Tauriel is a Feanorian, I&#39;m a Dwarf.<br><br>2/ That name. Oh, that name. Shall I go on? I shall.<br><br>--It means &#39;Daughter of the Forest&#39;. That&#39;s not a name you give to a normal Silvan child, because they are <i>all</i> children of the forest. So there&#39;s no way it&#39;s her Father-name. Since there are presumably a fair number of elves involved in fighting/guarding, it also doesn&#39;t work as a Mother-name, since it&#39;s still uninformative. (For the unfamiliar with Elven naming - fathers gave a name they liked. Mothers gave a name with prophetic overtones)<br><br>--That leaves it being either an after-name or self-name. Again, why would anyone <i>give</i> her the name &#39;Forest-girl&#39;, and have her keep it? It&#39;s a silly name for a Woodland Elf.<br><br>--And as a self-name... well, it&#39;s possible. But unbelievably arrogant, once you recall that &#39;Tauron&#39; (Forest-Lord) is the Sindarin name for the Vala of the Hunt, Orome. It would be kind of like naming yourself &#39;Godette&#39;.<br><br>--The alternative is the one suggested by Philosopher at Large for Mablung of Doriath - that she&#39;s an orphan. If her parents were killed in the woods (by spiders?), she could be a <i>literal</i> &#39;daughter of the forest&#39; - a child whose true name is unknown, so she grows up with a fairly generic one (with pious overtones - after all, who would have preserved her but the Lord of Forests?). Only... in the film, Greenwood only became Mirkwood, and the spiders only showed up, while the Fourteen+Gandalf were on their way to Rivendell. So that doesn&#39;t work either. There is literally no way that name makes sense for a character.<br><br>(In contrast, Legolas is named &#39;Green leaf&#39;. Yes, it&#39;s a woodland name - but recall that Thranduil (apparently &#39;vigorous spring&#39;) is <i>not</i> a Silvan elf. He&#39;s Sindar, and probably from Doriath. Giving his son a name that evokes the name of his (or his father&#39;s) realm - the &#39;Green&#39; component - but also spring, and the promise of rebirth (calen/galen, as in Eryn Galen &#39;Greenwood the Great&#39;, comes from &#39;bright&#39;, whereas Sindarin &#39;laeg&#39;, Silvan &#39;leg&#39;, comes from &#39;fresh&#39;) is a brilliant political move (as is naming him in the local dialect, rather than using Sindarin &#39;Laegolas&#39;), and also potentially personally meaningful. But &#39;Daughter of the Forest&#39;? No)<br><br>3/ I know, I said there were two... but she also has a romantic arc, according to Wikipedia. What, the only female simply <i>has</i> to fall in love, because she&#39;s a flighty emotional creature who needs a strong hand to give her direction? That&#39;s <i>wildly</i> sexist.<br><br>(I&#39;m guessing either Kili or Bard, by the way. Her actress says not Legolas)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Apart from the redhead one, which has been belaboured to death by a certain friend of mine. I&#39;ll summarise, though: just because there is only one <i>known</i> line of redheads doesn&#39;t mean it should be the only one ever. There&#39;s nothing that says red hair can&#39;t have cropped up elsewhere, particularly amongst brunettes with reddish overtones. (Also, Nerdanel&#39;s youngest, Amrod and Amras, were both nicknamed Ambarussa for their red hair.)<br><br>We could probably go back and forth all day talking over what was <i>stated</i> in canon as opposed to accepting possibilities, so let&#39;s not do that. I&#39;ll concede that even if we go with the possibility of red hair turning up elsewhere in Elven families, PJ pushed things somewhat by putting it on the named, combative lady.</p>

            <p>Psst, it&#39;s &quot;Maitimo&quot;, not &quot;Matimo&quot;.<br><br>Most Exiles tended to translate their names into Sindarin as far as &quot;okay, that sounds all right&quot; as opposed to exact translation, because I think some of the direct translations sounded a little bit silly, and Elves are alllll about &quot;sounds nicer&quot; rather than exact meanings. :p<br><br>For example, one of my OCs is named Telperossл in Quenya, which translates to &quot;silver dew&quot;; a direct translation would be &quot;Celemнdh&quot; or maybe &quot;Celemнdhon&quot;, which doesn&#39;t look or sound especially pretty, and definitely doesn&#39;t sound much like his, so a partway translation that still keeps a close sound would be &quot;Celebrost&quot;, which is what I use as his Exilic name.<br><br>And yeah, Curufin&#39;s the closest to his father out of the seven of them, given they share a name, so it makes sense that he&#39;d choose his father-name over his mother-name. :D<br><br>- Cassie is a happy happy Tolkien geek</p>

            <p>Oh, Curufin is the closest in temperament to his psychotic father (as far as we know - we don&#39;t hear a lot about &#39;Caranthir the Dark&#39;, other than that Haleth thought it was better to take her people through the giant-spider-infested Nan Dungortheb than hang around him), but Feanor wasn&#39;t (I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this) always, or even primarily, a psychopath.

A whole heap of them weren&#39;t even translations, just sound-alikes - and given how many of the House(s) of Finwe began using epessi instead of their given names, (like, six of seven Feanorions, Ar-Feiniel, Felagund, Galadriel, Gil-Galad...), I wonder whether there was some undisclosed purpose behind it all...<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: I&#39;m being corrected on my Quenya spelling.

            <p>I&#39;ve kind of always assumed Curufin was the closest to his father and that was why he chose to Sindarinise his father-name instead. And hey, Feanor has some good points... they&#39;re just kind of overshadowed by the impressive tantrum he threw that plunged a large amount of Arda into war for half a millennium. (And you could probably use that as a way to point out that at least he didn&#39;t do anything by halves.)<br><br>The name thing is kind of the point I was trying to make - they were going for &quot;sound-alikes&quot; rather than &quot;direct translation&quot; purely because the sound-alikes were more pleasant to the ear, in their opinion.

            <p>I&#39;m mostly directing this to Herr Wozzeck and the other Mass Effect fans, but of course anyone with something to contribute is welcome to do so. I will warn you that the subject matter is a tiny bit incendiary for ME fans (and likely incomprehensible for anyone else), but since we&#39;re all a fair bit more grown up here than the average netizen I think we can keep it civil and constructive. I also wish this board allowed ITALICS, so that I could EMPHASIZE KEY PHRASES without sounding like I&#39;m YELLING, but... well, one can&#39;t have everything.<br><br>Anyway. The POINT:<br><br>Many of the Mass Effect badfics we deal with here demonize Cerberus and its primary delegate, Miranda. And, being badfics, they do so in stark black, white, and urple morality. The are, as a result, roundly criticized by the PPC and other more discerning fans. This is, at the very least, consistent with ME2&#39;s canon, where Cerberus is, well, not REDEEMED exactly but at least upgraded from black to grey. But I for one think that this is the possibly unique confluence of events where Bioware&#39;s writers really, genuinely stuffed up (rare in and of itself) and the badficcers got it mostly RIGHT.<br><br>I&#39;m all right with Cerberus taking morally gray actions (which I define rougly as anything a particularly Renegade-aligned Sheperd would be willing to do- the best example being the instant execution of &quot;Wilson&quot; at the beginning of 2). They&#39;re a morally gray entity, after all, and Sheperd is given a wide range of dialogue responses to either condone or condem what (s)he sees.<br><br>It&#39;s when Cerberus does something truly monstrous that things get weird- and by truly monsterous I mean truly MONSTEROUS. Experimenting on children, torturing people for relatively basic information, trying to enslave an entire race of sapient creatures... stuff even SAREN didn&#39;t do. Whenever these atrocities come up, the Illusive Man has the same answer: a branch of Cerberus went rogue, did something nasty without authorization, and was subsequently shut down.<br><br>I don&#39;t buy it. Cerberus is a powerful, centrally-led organization that more or less lives on information. Significant chunks of its constituency should not just be able to go out and commit, well, basically WAR CRIMES without authorization, and not be stopped until the damage is done. That would require a level of incompetence that TIM obviously does not possess.<br><br>Instead, I see only two explanations. TIM could just remain willfully ignorant of the goings on beneath him, either as a means of plausible deniability or because he just doesn&#39;t care enough to investigate: in that case, I&#39;d still call him and his entire command structure culpable, because even if they didn&#39;t explicitly order atrocities committed they couldn&#39;t be bothered to use one iota of their significant power base to keep watch on their people or make the atrocities STOP. Alternatively, TIM may just be lying about the entire thing: we have NO independent proof that the war criminals weren&#39;t working directly for him, and the details of the &quot;disavowal&quot; (how did they manage to hide their activities, how much further they would have gone had they not been stopped, how the people involved were punished) are never revealed. Either way, the higher echelons of Cerberus are rotten, and you know what? The lower echelons of Cerberus are rotten too: the people directly involved in &quot;rogue&quot; activities seem to make up a substantial majority of all Cerberus operatives we see.<br><br>I cannot believe that Commander Sheperd would be fooled- heck, I saw through TIM in the first meeting with him, and Sheperd has WAY more experience with command ethics and war crimes than a 19-year-old kid with half a computer science degree. Given what they are revealed to be complicit in, even the orangest of Renegades would, I think, simply refuse to work with Cerberus. It certainly makes more sense than the existing denials, which I always found rather halfhearted.<br><br>Ok, from a gameplay perspective Cerberus vs. No Cerberus might be too big of a choice to make (although I think it could be done just by swapping Capt. Anderson for TIM in the  debriefings and the Cerberus logos for Alliance ones), but 1) Forcing the choice to default to No Cerberus would I think exclude less of Sheperd&#39;s plausible moral spectrum than the alternative, and 2) Cerberus could always FORCE Sheperd to work for them (they had two years to install a kill switch of some kind), and it would still make sense so long as Sheperd called them out on both that and their actions. Ok, ok, this IS Commander Sheperd we&#39;re talking about here, so (s)he could probably defeat whatever coercion Cerberus employed with a minimum of effort, but that&#39;s just linear game-writing and doesn&#39;t require planning for different player choices.<br><br>So, to conclude all of this: Cerberus are THE BAD GUYS, still, and Sheperd should NOT be working for them. Still.<br><br>That includes Cerberus&#39;s resident operatives, Jacob and Miranda (I suppose also the entire Normandy crew, but I imagine that if they had to choose between Sheperd and Cerberus they&#39;d almost universally pick Sheperd). Given that they are high-ranking officers in an organization that I&#39;m convinced Sheperd would want no part in and actively oppose, I can&#39;t imagine they&#39;d be allowed to operate as comrades the way they do in the game. My idea of appropriate choices for interaction would range from shooting either or both in the back at the earliest available opportunity to compelling them to quit through a good ol&#39;-fashioned Paragon sermon. And since she&#39;s more loyal to Cerberus (and more important within it), Miranda would be more likely than Jacob to receive something along the lines of the former. Until they are converted or removed, Miranda and Jacob are the ENEMY, and should be treated with at least verbal hostility.<br><br>Let me close with this. I am not, by any means, condoning what the badficcers do to Cerberus, in which they pile on atrocity after atrocity in the most obvious manner possible, and then turn Miranda into a titanic jerk. Cerberus, and Miranda in particular, do not need to be MORE EVIL. They are plenty evil enough already. What they need is for more GOOD CHARACTERS to CALL THEM OUT ON IT.</p>

            <p>...in fact, most of those are points I&#39;d actually agree on you with. Hell, in my own ME fanfiction I myself have a moment where my character chews gets into a yelling fight with Miranda about the Overlord DLC where he&#39;s all &quot;what the f*** was Cerberus thinking&quot;. So all these points are valid, and Cerberus is in fact not the greatest organization on the planet.<br><br>There are just two problems. First up are all the problems that some of the pro-Cerberus guys that used to hang around the BioWare Social Network bring up, and SeaTurtle just did a great job of mentioning them. Hence, why I won&#39;t be doing too much.<br><br>The second, <i>much</i> bigger problem in my eyes is this: whenever a badfic author bashes Cerberus, they either turn the whole organization into a bunch of idiots, or they never shut up about how evil it is: worse still, most badfics usually do both things. I get why they don&#39;t like Cerberus, I really do. However, I understand that Cerberus&#39; atrocities are the consequence of the &quot;ends justifies the means&quot; approach that they take: most badficcers almost <i>completely</i> miss that, and they go on to portray TIM and Cerberus in a way that is more &quot;their atrocities are there because they&#39;re EEEEVIIIIL&quot;. There&#39;s a <i>huge</i> difference between well-intentioned-extremist-evil and mustache-twirling-because-we-can-evil. And when a <i>Mass Effect</i> badficcer dips into mustache-twirling-because-we-can-evil with Cerberus, <i>that</i> is typically when I start to get annoyed with the portrayal of Cerberus.</p>

            <p>Given the badfics&#39; general lack of plot consistency or comprehensible motivation, sometimes it&#39;s hard to tell <i>why</i> Cerberus does what it does.

            <p>I do have some counter-points though:<br><br><i>Cerberus and its atrocities</i>: there is little doubt that Cerberus is in deep when it comes to the legal stuff. Then again, this organization&#39;s <s>madness mantra</s> rationale is &quot;Humanity first.&quot; Given the fact the Reapers are targeting humans first in this cycle and that the various races of the Milky Way are facing something that is totally out of their league, they think desperate times call for desperate solutions. They <i>need</i> to understand things such as Thresher Maw acid. They <i>need</i> to understand Indoctrination. They <i>need</i> to secure the Crucible&#39;s plans. They <i>need</i> whatever bit of intel an uncooperative person knows. And they will take what they need by force, which is what they usually do. At the end of the day, all that is left to justify Cerberus&#39; actions is the Illusive Man&#39;s mantra: &quot;Humanity first. We must survive, no matter the cost.&quot;<br><br>Speaking of which, wasn&#39;t that Saren&#39;s justification too?  &quot;If we cooperate, they might let us live. I must do whatever it takes to curry favour with Sovereign. The ends justify the means.&quot; <br><br>And when the Illusive Man&#39;s plans failed? &quot;I tried, Shepard.&quot;<br><br><br><i>The Illusive Man&#39;s chain of command</i>: TIM is in charge and he has the final say on projects. Given what I&#39;ve said above, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a matter of TIM not knowing or ignoring what&#39;s going on below him; he&#39;s fully aware of the situation and will gladly BS a story when his shadier projects are uncovered by Shepard. TIM is a master manipulator driven by his madness mantra. He&#39;s looked into the darkness and came out believing that the only way to fight it is to commit necessary evils. <br><br><br><i>Shepard cooperating with Cerberus</i>: it bugged me for a while until I considered the full implications of a newly resuscitated Commander flying the SR-2 directly to Earth and surrendering themselves to Alliance officials. Regardless of their moral alignment, Shepard realizes that the Collector threat  needs an immediate response and that Alliance procedurals would slow them down or maybe even preventing something from happening in the first place. They (begrudgingly) agree to cooperate with Cerberus on the basis that both want the Collectors dead as soon as possible. Furthermore, Paragon!Shep <i>will</i> call Cerberus out on their actions whenever they can. See TvTropes&#39; <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a>.<br><br><br><i>Miranda&#39;s case</i>: This ties in a bit with what I&#39;ve said above: if Shepard decided to off Miranda at any point in the operation, TIM would know what&#39;s up and sic all of his grunts on Shepard. Maybe a still-shackled EDi would comply with an order to engage a self-destruct system. The Commander knows that TIM has them in a corner, so they&#39;re forced to play nice with their custodians. <br><br>During Miranda&#39;s loyalty mission and inter-mission chats, we learn that the main reason she stuck with Cerberus was that they were one only ones who helped her (and her sister) hide from her father. Shepard presented her another way out: a path where she retains authority but where her superiors actually listen to her. <br><br>I do agree with the part about verbal hostility though. That would be a satisfying touch.<br><br><br><br>...aaaaaand that&#39;s all I have for now. What do you think?</p>

            <p><p>First off, I think we agree on the point that Cerberus is not just morally gray, but genuinely <i>eeeevil</i> (or at least they are willingly involved in the doing of genuinely <i>eeeevil </i>things- in a setting where evil doesn&#39;t have any kind of magical personification of darkness or evil, I actually “twitch” a little when people or things are referred to as such). Whether they are <i>necessarily</i> eeevil seems to be the primary bone of contention, along with whether or not Sheperd would understand them as such.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Most of the other issues emerge from that. If Shepard sees value in working with Cerberus, then the game proceeds more or less realistically- there&#39;s no reason to be anything other than civil to Miranda or Jacob, and it even makes sense to refrain from calling the Illusive Man out on his shenanigans for fear of alienating him (although without that explanation, the available dialogue options still seem quite... <i>tepid</i> to me).</p> <p><br></p> <p>If Sheperd doesn&#39;t want to work with Cerberus... well, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s terribly much anyone could do to stop hir. Self-destruct devices, AIs, whatever- I&#39;m sure that in between charisma, firepower, and pure savvy Shepard could find a way to make things work. Granted, it does make sense for hir to play along (including not offing anyone from Cerberus*) until (s)he is returned to control of the Normandy, and probably for some time after that to prepare what would basically be a mutiny, but after that...  </p> <p><br></p> <p>Also, the last time the Council intervened and tried to slow down Sheperd&#39;s efforts to save the galaxy, (s)he was able to ignore them with little trouble. But the big question is still whether Shepard <i>would </i>want to leave Cerberus.</p> <p><br></p> <p>I still say yes, since Shepard doesn&#39;t attempt to join forces with any of the merc groups (s)he encounters, despite them being powerful galactic entities in their own rights (or for that matter the Batarians, other Terminus powers, etc.), despite them being somewhat less nasty than Cerberus. Ultimately, it&#39;s a decision, and I think one that would be reasonable to leave up to the player. So maybe “even the orangest of Renegades” might be a bit of a misleading hyperbole... but it would still be an extremely “orange” action. Even assuming that players occupy a uniform distribution along the alignment spectrum (in my experience, most characters skew towards Paragon), defaulting to “no Cerberus” would encompass more people&#39;s intentions than the current option. <i>I</i> certainly wanted to go rogue...</p> <p><br></p> <p>*Honestly, <i>I</i> would have wanted to convince both Jacob and Miranda to defect from Cerberus, but I always played pretty far into the blue. A more renegade player might want to take them out before they could do something threatening... but then, a more renegade player would see less wrong with allying with Cerberus in the first place!</p> </p>

            <p>The board allows you to format your posts in HTML. To format something, you surround it in the appropriate tag like this: <code>&lt;tag&gt; text goes here&lt;/tag&gt;</code> . (Literal less-than and greater-than signs, if you need them, are obtained with the magic sequences &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; . Literal &amp; signs, where they might look like part of those magic sequences, are &amp;amp;)<br><br>Some common tags include:<br>&lt;i&gt; or &lt;em&gt;- <i>Italics</i> <br>&lt;b&gt; or &lt;strong&gt; - <b>Bold</b><br>&lt;del&gt; - <del>Strikethrough</del><br>&lt;code&gt; - <code>Monospace</code><br>&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://example.com/%22&amp;gt;Link">http://example.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Link</a> text&lt;/a&gt; - A link to example.com, which looks like <a href="http://example.com/">Link text</a><br><br>Those five tags should be enough for most of your Board formatting needs. If you need anything fancier, there are guides to HTML all over the Internet. (Should we put a mention of how to format posts in the header?)<br><br>Please check your HTML before posting, as the Board doesn&#39;t fix unclosed tags, which results in the rest of the thread page becoming bold or italic or whatnot. Also, the Board doesn&#39;t strip out some of the nastier tags. PLEASE, don&#39;t abuse this. Thank you.<br><br>­- Tomash</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been thinking for a while now that the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies">FAQ: For Newbies</a> (and maybe <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_The_Board">FAQ: The Board</a>, too) could use a section on how to go about introducing yourself, since I&#39;ve noticed that lots of newbies&#39; first posts are essentially some variation on &quot;Hi, I&#39;m new and I don&#39;t know what to say, so I hope this is all right.&quot; Updating the FAQ obviously won&#39;t help anyone who doesn&#39;t <i>read</i> said FAQ, but I think it&#39;s worth doing anyway. Here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking:<br> 
<h3>On Joining</h3>
<h3>How do I, er, join?</h3>It&#39;s easy! Just make a post introducing yourself on the Board and receive the warm welcome of your fellows, and boom, you&#39;ve officially joined the PPC.<br><br>Note, however, that you are <i><b>not</b></i> becoming an agent when you join the PPC. <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Agent">Agents</a> are fictional characters who live in HQ and go on missions. <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/You">You</a> are a real person who lives in a house or dorm or something, hangs out in an online community, and may (or may not!) write stories about said missions. There is at least one whole world of difference.<br><h3>What&#39;s the deal with this Board? How do I post on it?</h3>
<p>Main article: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_The_Board">FAQ: The Board</a></p>It&#39;s easy! See above for more information about the mechanics of the Board and some of our customs and etiquette.<br><h3>Okay, got it. But I don&#39;t know what to say!</h3>It&#39;s easy! ... Well, okay, this is a little more complicated. But the concept is simple: we want to know who you are, so your introduction should tell us a little bit about you. If you need suggestions, here are some questions that Boarders commonly ask newbies when welcoming them:<br><br><ul>
<li>Have you read the Constitution, the Original Series, this FAQ, and/or the variety of other helpful materials we have prepared for you? (If you haven&#39;t read at least the Constitution and the Original Series yet, go do it! It&#39;s important!)</li>
<li>What are your fandoms?</li>
<li>How did you find the PPC?</li>
<li>What&#39;s your favorite spin-off?/Who are your favorite agents?</li>
<li>What else do you do for fun?</li>
</ul>
<br>You may also wish to share information such as your gender/preferred pronouns, what you are studying/have studied/will study in school, what country you live in, and your native language if non-English. None of this is at all mandatory—and definitely <i>don&#39;t</i> reveal private information such as your real name or exact location—but we&#39;re a pretty broad group, and we are keen to know how broad. Diversity is fun! 
<br><hr>
<br>That&#39;s what I&#39;ve got for a start. Things that need links will be linked if this goes in the article, I&#39;m just not going to hunt down all the URLs right now. So, yea? Nay? Comments? Suggestions?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think this looks like a good addition. I remember when I first joined the Board I was a little unsure of what to say, but managed to work it out by looking at what other people had said, and what responses they got. Having something like this would have made that a whole lot more convenient for me. <br><br>One other thing that it might be worth adding to the Newbie FAQ somewhere is the fact that we don&#39;t encourage people to tell badfic authors about sporkings. I&#39;m sure I remember seeing a few posts (I think one may have even been an Intro post) on the Board along the lines of &#39;I&#39;ve found this badfic so I let the author know that it&#39;ll be PPCed soon&#39;. The FAQ for Other People says that it&#39;s not something that we do, but on my (admittedly quick) scan through the current Newbie FAQ I couldn&#39;t see anything telling the newbies that it&#39;s not sort of thing we do - so it might be a little unreasonable to expect them to know that. <br><br>I&#39;m also not completely sure that the current order of the points in the FAQ is the most useful. In my experience, the longer a document is the less likely it is that everyone reading it will actually finish it. Given that, is the difference between a Division and a Department really the most critical bit of knowledge, that one bit that we want to make sure every Newbie sees? Personally I think this &#39;On Joining&#39; section should be first (if it were to go in near the bottom then I think there&#39;s a good chance that it won&#39;t end up being read by the people that need it most), probably followed by the bit on Permission before we start going into details on Standard Operating Procedures and PPC Tech. Some of the sub-points in Miscellaneous are probably important enough to warrant a higher placement as well, although I agree that the Misc section should usually be last.<br></p>

<br><hr>
<br>I think that covers almost all the bases. I have a question, though, since I haven&#39;t used the Email space to receive notices myself (that I recall): do you automatically get notices when you fill in your address, or do you have to check the &quot;Check here to get daily updates&quot; box for that?

            <p>Neshomeh, what do you (and the rest of the Board) think about adding a section or a piece of the &#39;Posting on the Board&#39; section about how some basic html works on the Board (such as bold, italics, underline, strikethrough, links, and maybe font size as well)? This is something I really wanted to know as a newbie, and something that I periodically forget if I&#39;ve been away long enough. It might be nice to have it somewhere in the Board FAQ rather than in people&#39;s memories and notes. I know most of those html codes (with some help I could probably even make up a more complete article, for anyone who wants stuff like proper dashes) and there&#39;s been at least one recent post giving alternates. Do you think this is worth doing?<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I think we could definitely include basic code like bold, italics, strikethrough, and links—and I do like my proper dashes, too. {= ) We may want to simply provide an external link, like Outhra suggests, for more complicated stuff that people shouldn&#39;t need to use very much.<br><br><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools Online</a> is currently my favorite site for HTML and especially CSS reference. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">Here&#39;s the HTML reference list</a>.<br><br><a href="http://www.alanwood.net/demos/ent4_frame.html">This</a> is handy for finding the code for characters such as dashes and greater/less-than signs, as well as just about anything else you can think of. You can find all that on the other site, too, but it&#39;s in a single list here; on W3S it&#39;s split up.<br><br>Hope that helps!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Someone helpful(I think it was KittyNoodles) showed me <a href="http://yourwebapps.com/WebApps/db-view.cgi?db=83303&amp;sort=1">this guide</a> within my first few weeks of my entry onto the Board. It covers external links, bolding, italicizing, posting images, changing text color... basically the basics. No command for image resizing, or strikethrough, or a few other bits, but the basics.<br>It would be probably helpful to link to in the FAQ, or at least as a place to harvest basic html codes for copy-pasting into the FAQ.</p>

            <p>...I can say without a doubt that you most certainly have a point about it needing to be rewritten. I mean, it&#39;s reasonably clear, but it&#39;s far from easy to read, and some of the details could get lost fairly easily. Added to that, it rambles a little. And what all that&#39;s leading up to is that yes, I feel like taking a crack at it. I&#39;ll post a draft here for approval once I&#39;ve got one.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>If there are any of you who have felt nearly inexpressable anger at the destruction of canon - or worse: the <i>deliberate</i> shredding of a character (even worse: who happens to be your LO) - but the violation was not done in any narrative format that can be easily sporked, what did you do about it?</p>

<li>Find someone supportive to rant at until you feel better. (Remember not to bash the author!)<br><br>2. Take the energy you have and use it for something constructive, like a goodfic about the character in question. Show the world how it <i>should</i> be done.<br><br>3. MST the sucker. You can MST almost anything. (Again, remember not to bash the author.)<br><br>4. Personally? If a thing is so stupid or irritating that I can&#39;t get any humor out of it, I tend to just write it off as not worth my energy and go do something else until I can calm down. House- or yardwork is a great way to blow off steam—plus you get some work done, and that&#39;s a nice feeling. A game (I like Minecraft) can also distract you long enough to get a grip.<br><br>5. Always remember the MST3K Mantra: &quot;It&#39;s just a show [or book, movie, fanfic, etc.], I should really just relax.&quot;<br><br>I hope one or more of the above help. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

Anyone got any alternate theories?

            <p>I did 1.5 archivings of the Board (my archiver had some issues with character encoding in a specific old post, so I had to stop and go again). The archive I took is importable into T-Board instances (that is, there&#39;s a way to stick it into a database) or loadable into a Ruby interpreter. I gave Dann and VM copies so that the data hangs around for a bit longer. I also archived us because there&#39;s some things we&#39;ve done (writing, games, links to missions) that are <i>only</i> preserved on the Board, and I didn&#39;t want us, as a community, to lose them to the abbyss at the end of the Board, which is now swallowing June 2008.</p>

            <p>So, I&#39;ve found some Star Trek badfics, TOS.<br><br>The first one is a Suefic. Classic - she&#39;s a scientist who hates Vulcans, but rather quickly falls in love with Spock. And he returns it. Suethors don&#39;t seem to remember that Vulcans don&#39;t express emotions. Oh, and did I mention the urple description Spock gives her? He&#39;s describing her mind, but it&#39;s still painfully flowery - &quot;Knowledge was Spock&#39;s God, and Katalya Tremain was one of its prophets&quot;.<br><br>The second is a genderbend fic - basically, the Enterprise crew gets lured to this planet, then they inexplicably wake up as the opposite gender. Like, here&#39;s the line: &quot;Kirk snapped awake - and knew. There was no mistaking the one overwhelming fact: He was in the body of a woman.&quot; That&#39;s  how fast it happens. And then there&#39;s a scene where fem!Bones and unchanged Spock agree that Kirk is too pretty to be taken seriously as captain. Which is just...ugh. TOS is vaguely sexist, but it isn&#39;t <i>that</i> bad.<br><br>I suppose you&#39;re wondering where I found them, since I didn&#39;t post links. Well, that&#39;s because they&#39;re not online.<br><br>I found them in a box of old Star Trek novels from the &#39;60s and &#39;70s. The first one is a novel, and the second is from a fanfiction anthology. <br><br>I have some pictures and some more analysis on my Tumblr <a href="http://hermioneofvulcan.tumblr.com/tagged/star-trek-novels">here</a>, if you&#39;re interested.<br><br>This makes me so excited. This is the history of fandom right here. It&#39;s changed form - fanzine is an outdated term, and I never saw the term &quot;fanfiction&quot; anywhere on the book - but in some ways, it&#39;s stayed just the same. It&#39;s something the fans do to respond to the work, fill a gap, explore something, do something the series can&#39;t. Of course, badfic has stayed mostly the same too, which I find quite interesting. With all the different anti-badfic techniques that have cropped up over the years, wouldn&#39;t there be some changes? Wouldn&#39;t there be fewer Sues? What do you think?<br></p>

There&#39;s nothing out there stopping people from writing whatever they want, good or bad, and <i>nor should there be</i>. We all go through a learning process as we write. We <i>all</i> start out writing bad stories, and get better as we learn from our mistakes. (Well. Most of us get better. Some of us stop writing, and some of us refuse to learn from our mistakes. See again: the entirety of the history of sentience.)<br><br>If you mean stuff like the PPC, that&#39;s not really &quot;anti-badfic,&quot; not in a sense that would stop people from writing it. (And again - nor should it. The last thing we want to do is silence those we disagree with.) It&#39;s just a different kind of fanfic - one that happens to revolve around other folks&#39; fanfic. Meta-meta-meta-fiction. Sort of. But actually stopping badfic? Well, first we&#39;d have to agree on exactly what badfic <i>is</i>, which probably will never happen, since what&#39;s good and bad fanfiction is so subjective. (Mostly. The stuff we generally mission, as pointed out several times, is the hilariously-bad, not the mediocre or the &quot;bad but it could be improved.&quot; That&#39;s for a reason.)<br><br>But my point is, most people will never read fringe stories like the PPC, or Sue-slayers. They&#39;re written for a very small audience, for the most part, because most people don&#39;t actually know fanfiction exists when they start dreaming it up, and may not even know fanfiction exists when they start writing - until they get into a community, and even then, a lot of folks don&#39;t much care to distinguish between badfic and goodfic, and the ones that <i>do</i> either leave concrit or flames or just don&#39;t bother reading it... and the very few folks who are left over may or may not ever actually care enough to find the PPC. So... we&#39;re not really making a huge difference in fandom, in <i>any</i> single fandom. The point, as far as I know, is to entertain each other and vent about stuff we dislike - writing as catharsis. That&#39;s  never going to stop anyone (and, yet again, nor should it).<br><br>As for the thread going on about whether we&#39;re allowed to mission these... Please don&#39;t.<br><br>1) They were written, for the most part, multiple decades ago. The authors who wrote them would probably be deeply embarrassed to know they&#39;re still floating around. Lois Bujold got her start in writing there, and IIRC, one of the ones she wrote was the story where <i>Cordelia&#39;s Honor</i> started. And although a Klingon and a Vulcan falling in love may be utterly bizarre fanfic, and perhaps something some of us would write scathing reviews of, <i>Cordelia&#39;s Honor</i> is an excellent book. It&#39;s a cheap shot to go after something so long ago, so far, when we have no idea how the authors feel about it now.<br><br>2) <i>Not everything needs our input</i>. To me, it&#39;s really awesome that we have records of where the fandom started out! Maybe it&#39;s just me being old and crotchety, but I find it a bit irritating that our first thought in finding this interesting history is &quot;How can we best mock it?&quot; Please... don&#39;t. Appreciate it, laugh at it... don&#39;t go after it. Please.</p>

            <p>I think it would have to be a slightly less violent Klingon and a slightly less logical Vulcan. They&#39;d have to have something in common, some way of achieving mutual understanding before the relationship could work. It&#39;d take time. Lots of time.</p>

            <p>Hermione, do you know what you just found? You just found the missing piece to my idea for a Flower centric mission! For this discovery, I will even give you the right to use this idea as your own, if you want it. The idea came when reading about the Flowers on the wiki, and I saw that in the past, Flowers did misions, rather than agents. So, if I could find some old fanfic, from the 70&#39;s or earlier, I could write one of the mission reports from the Flowers! We could learn more about our favorite department heads as they take out Sues without most of the technology we have now. The implications are staggering! Anyway, I will fade back into the background and either write the thing or let somebody else take it. My only request is that Hermione has first dibs. Should she decline it, feel free to descend upon the poor plot bunny and claim it as your own.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure these are sporkable. They&#39;re published, even thought they are clearly fanfiction. And a novel is just hard to spork.

            <p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s sporkable have to remember at the time that book was published Star Trek was still a Cult Classic TV series that only got saved and made into a movie series because of the fans. Which led to TNG and such. So it could just be Gene going &quot;Hey look CBS/paramount...look how popular my little space opera is with people&quot; So in that sense it&#39;s fair game. Heck it might even be fun to do in a prequel sporking...you know have agents in the 60s~70s on a &quot;From the archives&quot; mission.</p>

            <p>Gene&#39;s &quot;blessing&quot; is actually just the opposite of a quarantined continuum.<br><br>Most authors don&#39;t say if they like or not fanfiction of their works.

            <p>You WOULD think that enough had changed in our culture since the 70&#39;s that fanfiction would have changed as well. It may have something to do with the idea of the Last Original Plot- all storylines have been written, mostly by Biblical writers, the Greeks, Shakespeare, and the Brothers Grimm, and the one remaining plot is sealed in a vault somewhere festering. It&#39;s hardly surprising that we&#39;re still using the same plots as forty years ago, when we&#39;re still squeezing every drop of intrigue out of plots created thousands of years ago.<br><br>But the gender-bender took me by surprise.

            <p>Haha, thanks!  Nice to meet you!<br><br>As for your questions...<br><br>1. Made sure to read it thoroughly a few times.<br>2. Yep! And loved it. <br>3. I don&#39;t exactly remember how, but I&#39;d stumbled across the missions of Agents Suicide and Diocletian, and from there began my years as a lurker of the PPC.<br>4. I have a good many fandoms, some of which include:<br><br>-Harry Potter<br>-Percy Jackson<br>-Warriors (first and second series.)<br>-Lord of the Rings<br>-Comics (I have a preference for DC.)<br>-Digimon<br>-Most video games (I&#39;m not going to list them all, but if you name one there&#39;s a good chance I have played it.

If minis are spawned by poor grammer, generic beasts are poorly described bit characters, and bit characters are only there to serve as a Sue&#39;s audience, what would a character who exists only as a single line of dialouge be? I personaly imagine it as a thing who&#39;s core personality is described in its one sentence, and it will try to acquire a description by eating other beings&#39; descriptions.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s something in the air. We smell it, and we begin a great migration to the boards, looking to join in it&#39;s wonders.

(Although, as a newbie, I may not be the best person for that.) It&#39;s a good place not to lurk, the people here being very amiable and also somewhat cracked and all. <br><br>Here is a top hat kitten, as a welcome present. It combines the best features of hats, kittens and good taste. Just don&#39;t look at it too hard or try to figure out how the two features are supposed to fit together.

            <p>In the life cycle of any posting board is a great influx of newcomers. Stock your bunkers though, because the good time don&#39;t last. Our forecast predicts a period of withering disuse in a few months, the a sharp decline in members. Mad Sues fall from the sky, and the last agents make a final stand in a sea of glittering fire! <br><br>However, increased cheese consumption for two weeks should cause a chain reaction, and lead to a golden age of the PPC.

            <p>They must have needed to get rid of even more of their Stuff than usual, and didn&#39;t even have time to bother renaming it. The distributor may have been a small faction that broke off from the main group after the latest corporate coup, and needed to sell the Stuff off to raise money quickly. That&#39;s how multi-dimensional corporations work, right? Like non-protagonist countries in fantasy books, always overthrowing their leaders and dealing with splinter cells because... business, I guess?<br><br>Yes. That is what is going on. The formerly-known-as-PPC Bioengineering noblemen are probably going to react by sending their financial wizards to secure the rebel province, only to find out that their entire shareholder portfolio was being manipulated by the Stock Rider as part of his plan to achieve a complete monopoly of the industry. The distribution of Purple Stuff is just pre-fallout. So... fall-in? I don&#39;t know how that term would work. Either way, it would make for the silliest fiscal quarter ever.</p>

They appear to have both linked to a site called Oddlots originally, but now only redirect to one of those &quot;this site was not found, so maybe you mean one of these&quot; browser web searches.<br><br>Could someone with sufficient knowledge change where those links go? I know that there&#39;s at least one person active who can change the Other Board, because there&#39;s a reminder to read the Constitution at the top of every page that wasn&#39;t there a few weeks ago, but I&#39;m not sure who it is, so I can&#39;t ask them directly. It might have been Huinesoron, since he was the one who changed the main Board&#39;s header a while ago, but again, I&#39;m not sure.</p>

            <p>So, last month someone suggested making a TV Tropes character page for the PPC. This brought up the bad history between TV Tropes and the PPC, so I suggested we just make it a game!

He wants to learn about humans to be able to do his job better, and he enjoys human media like <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Sherlock Holmes</i>, but he still retains his Vulcan stoicism and tends to like the parts of human culture that fit with Vulcan culture.<br><br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnarkToSnarkCombat">Snark-to-Snark Combat</a> - Between him and Tish.<br><br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> - The fact that his Lust Object is Galadriel, and the connection between Vulcans and elves.(<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Similar, but not the same.</a>)<br><br><br><b><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Tish_Jameson">Tish</a></b><br><br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMcCoy">The McCoy</a> - To Sebak&#39;s Spock, as expected given the PPC procedure of pairing opposites.<br><br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOniBlueOni">Red Oni, Blue Oni</a> - The red to Sebak&#39;s blue.<br><br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaQueen">Drama Queen</a> - Somewhat.

            <p>I&#39;ve been thinking of these two for a while. Hopefully I won&#39;t make &#39;em Sues...<br><br>Sif<br><br>Big Sister Mentor - She is this to Anya, being both older and more experienced.<br><br>Yamato Nadeshiko/Lady of War - She acts very lady-like, calm and polite. She prefers to avoid unnecessary combat. That being said, she is a brilliant manipulator and proficient in combat.<br><br>An Offer You Can&#39;t Refuse - She was originally a bit-character made as a romantic rival for a Sue. She joined the PPC because she didn&#39;t want to die.<br><br>Aloof Dark-Haired Girl - She can be extremely reserved and annoyingly polite. She happens to have black hair.<br><br>Anya<br><br>Heroic Wannabe - Really wants be able to defeat all Mary Sues and save canons. More often than not, she needs to be saved by Sif.<br><br>Tomboy - Very much so. She is occasionally mistaken for a boy.<br><br>Genki Girl - Tones it down a bit on missions. Constantly annoys Sif.<br><br>No Social Skills - Incapable of communicating with anyone without seriously annoying or insulting them.</p>

            <p>WarHammer 40k origins, huh? So is he from fan-fiction or a canon? I&#39;m not really familiar with that fandom. He sounds cool, though.<br><br>Yeah Marco and Sif do sound like they&#39;d have something going on... Question, though. Was he in a relationship with Hermione or Lana? Both are listed.</p>

            <p>The Marshal was from a Goodfic RP group I was a part of on second life. Hence his paranoia about meeting himself in other fictions. And the relationship issue was a love triangle issue he dated them both at one ponit, and was dating Lana when the PPC killed her.</p>

            <p>Oh, I see. Thanks for clearing that up! That actually does sound like an interesting premise -could be used as a joke or seriously depending on the context.<br><br>Ah, I see. So Hermione was like the Sue&#39;s romantic rival.<br><br></p>
