            <p>Wikia does display eight pages in the category as thumbnails below the category description (if any), but there&#39;s no way I know of to control which thumbnails are displayed. (Doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not possible, I just haven&#39;t personally looked into it.) Also, there are far more pages in that category than just the ones with thumbnails showing, and some of them are sorted by continuum already. You&#39;ll see the subcategories if you scroll down a bit, and all pages in the main category if you keep going.<br><br>Or, were you talking about something else?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>but I&#39;ll share my opinion again, just for posterity&#39;s sake.<br><br>I don&#39;t feel that there&#39;s any problem with having lots of Sue pages as long as they&#39;re well-written and informative.  I found the one that I made fun to write, and actually offered me some new insights into the mission itself.<br><br>Also, with needing a certain number of members voting in favor of giving a particular Sue a page, I suspect very few will ever meet that requirement.  But I guess that&#39;s partly the intention anyway.</p>

            <p>I think we&#39;d nearly settled on some kind of nomination process. If I remember right, the plan was that slain Sues could be nominated to have pages by anyone other than the mission&#39;s author(s), starting at least a couple of months after the mission&#39;s release. I don&#39;t think a time frame was decided. Also, a nomination would probably need to be confirmed by some number of other people agreeing with it. I don&#39;t know what number would be appropriate, but probably more than a handful, since the idea is that Sues getting pages should be ones that stand out and stick in the community&#39;s consciousness, and/or have relevance beyond just one or two people.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>That seems familiar now. I&#39;m thinking at least five boarders should have to second any nomination, though that&#39;s kind of just the number that feels right, so I&#39;m not really attached to it. And two months (60 days or so) seems like a good waiting period.<br><br>So now, the question becomes this: how do we make sure the rest of the community likes this idea? A poll, perhaps?</p>

            <p>Maybe get some more suggestions for number of people and length of time, and see if anyone has entirely different ideas, then set them up in a Google quiz thingy?<br><br>Personally, I&#39;d like to see a few more people second a nomination, like eight or even ten. More than ten might be pushing it, but I&#39;m just guessing. I don&#39;t know how many people read the average mission, though I&#39;d bet more than the number that comment.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t tell you how many people read any given mission - or any given post - but I can tell you that the Board averages ~350 unique IP visitors a day, and ~5500 pageviews - every day. Interestingly, this means any given IP is looking at a mere 15 pages/day.<br><br>I&#39;m collecting the daily figures on a spreadsheet, since the Board only records them for a month. Once I&#39;ve got enough to make a graph of awesome, I plan to throw them up here for entertainment.<br><br>Of course, what that really needs is someone to make a log of how many usernames we have active at any given time... hrm, off to Excel.<br><br>hS, fun with numbers!</p>

            <p>So on the front page, ignoring various anonymice, we have 45 named posters. The only letters we <i>don&#39;t</i> have a name starting with are Q, U, X, Y and Z. The most common first letter is S, with seven names, followed perhaps surprisingly by K, with 5. A, B, F, G, I, J, L, O, R, V and W all have only one adherent.<br><br>Assuming that Boarders average 2 IP addresses (work/home, school/home, with some having more and some having only one), we find that ~ 100 IPs belong to posting members, while ~250 belong to non-posters, suggesting we have around ~120 non-posting lurkers during the past two weeks.<br><br>The interesting question will be: in another two weeks, with an entirely fresh front page, how many of the same names will have posted? Only time will tell...<br><br>... or looking at the previous page. Back in a tick.<br><br>Well. 45 posters between 1st-12th April, but 55 from 20th March-1st April. That includes 21 who haven&#39;t posted on the current front page, and therefore 11 of the posters on this page didn&#39;t post on the last one.<br><br>That gives a total of 66 names in the past less-than-a-month, of which a whopping 10 start with S.<br><br>~Suinesoron :P</p>

            <p>Did you ever get around to writing any stories? If so, post a link so I can read them!<br><br>Presents, you say? Well, I certainly don&#39;t mind giving gifts! Have a tiny Spinosaurus in a jar! Due to state-of-the-art dimensional sealing and stasis technology, it&#39;ll stay dormant and sealed in its small size until the jar&#39;s inner casing cracks. Then it grows to its former size, full of as much prehistoric vigor as the day it was packaged! I&#39;d suggest not breaking the jar until you either have enough space to keep the full-sized version fed and active or an enemy shows up that you simply <i>have</i> to throw a dinosaur at.</p>

            <p>So, I&#39;ve been doing some tutoring, and I just covered momentum. I was thinking about it for a bit, and now I&#39;ve got a question I can&#39;t figure out.<br><br>So, let&#39;s start with two objects. One is 1 kg, the other is 10 kg, and moving toward the first at 1 m/s. They collide in an elastic collision, and Conservation of Momentum says the 1 kg object is now moving at 10 m/s, and the 10 kg is still. However, the Kinetic Energy of the 10 kg when it was moving was 5 J, but the KE of the 1 kg is 50 J after the collision. Where does the 45 J of KE come from?</p>

            <p>Realistically speaking, the 10kg ball could not transfer all of its momentum to the 1 kg ball: the mass ratio is far too big. Instead, the 10 kg ball will keep on rolling forward at something just under its initial velocity and the 1 kg ball will be sent forward at about 2*v<sub>1</sub>. <br><br>Source: <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html"> Hyperphysics</a> website.

            <p>CoM says that (duh) momentum is conserved - it doesn&#39;t say that a 1kg ball can stop a 10kg ball dead in its tracks. Balls of <i>equal mass</i> exchange velocities in that way; unequal masses don&#39;t.<br><br>Running via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum#Conservation">wiki</a>, I find a pair of equations (under &#39;Elastic collisions&#39;) allowing you to determine the final velocity, v(1,2), from the initial velocities u(1,2) and the masses m(1,2). For your 10kg mass, the equation reads:<br><br>v1 = ((m1-m2)/(m1+m2))*u1 + ((2*m2)/(m1+m2))*u2<br><br>Given that u2 (initial velocity of the smaller ball) = 0, and inputting the other figures, that gives:<br><br>v1 = (9/11) * 1 = ~0.82 m/s.<br>k.e. = 1/2 m1*v1^2 = 3.35 J.<br><br>The equation for m2 is the same, except with the subscripts flipped. Running the numbers gives us:<br><br>v2 = (20/11) * 1 = ~ 1.82 m/s<br>k.e. = 1.65 J.<br><br>And, of course,<br><br>3.35 + 1.65 = 5 J.<br><br>Does that answer your question?<br><br>(Short version: a bowling ball rolled at a ping-pong ball won&#39;t fire the ping-pong ball off into orbit)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not a huge fan of the subforum layout, but the &#39;sort by date&#39; classic Board view works for me. <br><br>The subthread lines work nicely, on this Board I would position my cursor over the point and the use the scroll-wheel to sort out which message it was actually a reply to - that worked fine on my laptop, but was considerably less effective on my phone (particularly as the smaller screen size of my phone meant that that issue came up more often). I&#39;ve just checked out T-Board from my phone, and it&#39;s so much easier to see where replies are coming from. <br><br>Being able to expand longer posts while looking the at full thread is also a good thing, and makes it quicker to read a full conversation. Again, this benefit is really noticeable when browsing on my phone, as it cuts down on the amount of page loading I have to do. <br><br>The 100 character limit on post titles also seems like a good idea (that seems to be about twice our current limit), as it can occasionally be a little difficult to get a sensible post title to fit in here. <br><br>The only advantage I can think of that this current Board has is that, if I make a post while I&#39;m signed in (and I tend to sign in - I&#39;ve never had any problems doing so), I get an e-mail alert whenever someone replies to it. That doesn&#39;t seem to be the case with T-Board. It&#39;s not a huge thing, because I have to browse the threads anyway to see anything that isn&#39;t a direct reply to me, but I have found it convenient to be notified of any replies. Out of interest, is this something that could be implemented on T-Board (and how difficult would it be)?<br><br>Also, a very minor point, on the &#39;edit your profile&#39; page there appears to be a typo in &#39;confirm&#39;. </p>

            <p>Email notifications are a thing on T-Board. In fact, they fire for replies to replies (to replies to replies ...) as well. The reason you didn&#39;t get an email when you replied to yourself is because there&#39;s code to prevent that, because getting emailed about a post you just made just clutters up your inbox.<br><br>Also, thanks for your typo report! It&#39;s fixed now. While you&#39;re here, do you have any ideas about how T-Board should handle long threads? Also, is the site easy to use on your phone?

            <p>I did get an e-mail notification for your reply. T-Board fooled me by being more sophisticated than I was expecting - well done :)<br><br>The site is pretty easy to use from my phone, the subthread lines and the ability to expand a post without having to load a new page definitely make it more convenient than this current Board. And the &#39;sign in&#39; bit is big enough on my phone screen that I don&#39;t have to zoom in to use it (which is a problem I&#39;ve encountered on other sites). I only tend to view stuff on my phone, if I&#39;m actually posting I tend to do it from my laptop because the bigger screen and keyboard make it so much easier. So yeah, I think it works well from a phone (I use an Android phone, if that&#39;s relevant). <br><br>With regards to the long threads (I&#39;m assuming you mean the ones that crab sideways, rather than those that just stretch downwards due to a load of first tier replies), T-Board already seems to handle them better than this Board. I guess that the amount of stretching experienced will vary based on screen size/resolution/whatever, but on my current set-up the Rangers RP from the Other Board goes off the side of my screen, while the same thread on T-Board doesn&#39;t. <br><br>The way the indents reduce as each new tier opens up seems to be a good way of reducing the sideways expansion (looks like it goes down from about 10mm to just under 5mm on the Rangers thread), although it does occur to me that those smaller gaps are still perfectly distinct, thanks to the lines, so if the whole thing had a uniform gap of the smaller size, those later postings would be less squashed up against the right-hand side of the screen. <br><br>I guess that (other than the occasional randomly sprawling conversation) the most likely time for that kind of thing to be an issue is in RP threads, where it&#39;s going to be a series of consecutive replies, each on a new sub-tier. The &#39;expand this post&#39; feature means that you can follow such a thread without having to scroll around (and possibly lose your place) all the time, but when it gets to a certain point it&#39;s so much easier to read full-width rather than simply expanding a column of text with a load of dead space to its left. <br><br>At the moment, if you actually click on a post you get to read that post full-width, then have the &#39;reply&#39; buttons etc., and then get the full thread. Would it be possible to add in duplicate links to any direct replies to the post before going on to the full thread? That way, you could easily follow a single thread-chain (such as you tend to get in RPs), while being able to read the text without it all being squashed up, and without having to scroll through and find your place each time. <br><br>On a slightly different subject, I notice that the admin-type tags (locked, edited, poofed, etc.) are colour-coded, is it possible to do that to the other tags (newbie intro, test post, new story, etc.)? It might just help highlight them if you&#39;re having a quick skim through on classic view.   <br></p>

The stretch is actually defined as padding on the left with a width of 3% of the space that the text would normally get.

            <p>I&#39;ll address the concerns about the software running T-Board in a later post. For now, I would like to note current and possible future problems with the hosting I&#39;m using, which has the side-benefit of being free.<br><ol>
<br><li>T-Board currently routes its emails through my Gmail account. This is not a good thing, and can be solved by getting a dedicated <code><a href="mailto:PPCBoard@gmail.com">PPCBoard@gmail.com</a></code> or something like that.</li>
<br><li>Search is not working because Heroku (the guys handing out this hosting) want $$ for that.</li>
<br><li>The import of the RP Board is an older import that hit a really minor bug related to character encoding, which has since been fixed. This is why some characters (mostly Word-style quotes) didn&#39;t come through.</li>
<br><li>We might run out of database rows, especially if we import all the posts from the Board. Heroku gives out 10k database rows for free, and lets you have 10 million rows for $9/month. If we stay on Heroku, we&#39;ll have to pick up that cash somehow. A medium-badness solution is to run some not-too-annoying ads (maybe Google&#39;s) to try and offset the hosting bill if we start to acquire one.</li>
<br>
</ol>
<br>As for the image problem, we might be able to get away with using our shiny HTML filter and some Javascript to make the images click-to-expand.<br></p>

The one I will highlight is:<br><br>-Tray-Gnome has expressed concern about the large amount of whitespace on the current Board, and has (possibly?) indicated that this is a problem lots of people have. TomashBoard (hereafter T-Board) has the same potential problem.<br><br>Other than that, let&#39;s get to it. I&#39;ll start by working down my original list of &#39;benefits of The Board&#39;. <b>Please note</b>: When I say there is &#39;no indication&#39; (or whatever) of which of several alternatives is the case, I&#39;m saying <b>I can&#39;t tell from the screenshot</b>. This is a request for clarification, not a statement that something is unworkable because you can&#39;t tell what it is.<br><br><i>-Instant visibility of all activity in the last 24 hours</i><br><br>I see a &#39;New&#39; tag floating around in one image, but no indication of when it pops up (or when it vanishes). Possibilities appear to be:<br>-&gt; Flags the most recent post (but that would be ridiculous)<br>-&gt; Flags your most recent post immediately after you make it (ditto)<br>-&gt; Flags everything posted since you last logged in (which, assuming you don&#39;t have to log in to read - and given that a lot of computers drop &#39;Keep me logged in&#39; - might be less than useful)<br>-&gt; Flags everything posted since your computer last visited (cookies? This would be like the change in link colour on the Board, and doesn&#39;t help if you use multiple computers)<br>-&gt; Flags everything since a certain time (like the highlighting. This works in general - but isn&#39;t a lot of help if you&#39;ve been gone more than a day!)<br><br><i>-For a thread you recognise by sight, near-instant recognition of not just whether anyone has replied, but precisely what they&#39;ve replied to. If you need to hunt for the thread, this takes a little longer.</i><br><br>This appears to be the case in Classic mode, but (obviously) not in Modern mode (or whatever it&#39;s called). Modern mode has an &#39;Edited&#39; flag, but again, there&#39;s no hint as to whether this is &#39;Top post edited&#39; or &#39;Someone has replied&#39;. The same flag shows up in the Classic mode pictures, which implies it&#39;s the former. If so, something would be required to indicate when a thread in Modern mode was last edited.<br><br>Related to this: I see &#39;Newest thread&#39; on Modern view. Does that actually collect newest, or most recently edited?<br><br><i>-The ability to spot an individual post, even if you don&#39;t remember which thread it&#39;s on. This can be done by eye, or by Ctrl-F or its equivalents, rather than through notoriously fickle forum search engines (example: the Minecraft forum search has literally never worked for me).</i><br><br>This is available in Classic mode but obviously not in Modern. I see a Search bar but don&#39;t know how it works.<br><br><i>-The ability for discussions in any given thread to wander wildly off-topic without someone telling them they&#39;re in the wrong forum for that.</i><br><br>This seems like it would actually be made <b>worse</b> by the dual setup. If someone on Classic mode discusses things in the wrong Modern mode forum...? Yeah. I think if we migrated to T-Board, a rule that &#39;forums are not rules, only guidelines&#39; would be not just a good idea, but essential.<br><br><i>-Instantly visible notes at the top of the page, rather than sticky threads. The current header is a lot harder to ignore.</i><br><br>This is there on Classic mode, but bizarrely not in a subforum on Modern mode? I think the Constitution, Wiki and IRC are important enough that they should be instant-access from subforae...<br><br><i>-As previously stated, no artificial divisions which could lead to, for example, &quot;What&#39;s the point of going into the newbies forum? Nothing ever happens there...&quot;</i><br><br>Alleviated by Classic mode. I&#39;m not convinced this wouldn&#39;t be a problem for Modern mode users.<br><br><i>-No-one being told off for posting in the wrong forum.</i><br><br>As stated above. I&#39;m assuming the tags (&#39;Test post&#39;, &#39;Newbie introductions&#39;) are the way of putting your Classic mode post into a given subforum. However, I also note they&#39;re possible to attach on lower posts in a thread. I&#39;m... really not sure how this works. Do tags elsewhere in a thread than the top post actually do anything?<br><br>And - yeah, that &#39;guidelines not rules&#39; rule is an <b>absolute must</b> for mixed modes. No, moving the thread and leaving a &#39;friendly&#39; note won&#39;t cut it - we have some very fragile newbies at times, and, given the tone of some of the &#39;You might want to check the Wiki before asking questions like this&#39; replies we&#39;ve had in the last year or so (specifically, blunt: I was told this was because people are fed up of saying the same thing over and over), I do not believe they would remain &#39;friendly&#39;.<br><br><i>-Given the extremely slow pace of stories being posted, no-one making a post in the General forum to tell people there&#39;s a story in the Stories forum.</i><br><br>Classic mode obviously negates this. Subforum... would depend on whether people save the link to the General forum or to the top page. I still forsee this being a problem, beginning whenever the first person says, &quot;Did you read my story by the way?&quot; &quot;Oh, no, I didn&#39;t see anyone had posted one...&quot;<br><br><i>-Depending on the forum technology, any of:<br>--No thread bumping (for reasons described multiple times in this thread)</i><br><br>I honestly can&#39;t tell if this exists on T-Board. One of the subforum posts seems to indicate it does (an &#39;Edited&#39; - whatever that means - thread has an earlier time than a non-edited post below it), and if so, it should be turned very firmly off. It wouldn&#39;t work on Classic mode - again, we&#39;ve tested this and proved it - and we do not want different modes showing different threads. That leads to exclusionism.<br><br><i>--Multi-threading of discussions, rather than the constraints of single-threading</i><br><br>This does appear to be in place.<br><br><i>--No logins, which encourages new posters, allows access to people on unusual technology (such as cheap phones - I recall Specs had difficulty logging into the wiki - and badly-firewalled computers at places like work), and permits in-character posts.</i><br><br>T-Board requires logins, but allows using a different name to your own. I like the &#39;JayBird (posted by Huinesoron)&#39; feature (though I wonder if it will cause arguments during the Badfic Game - how well will people disregard the flames if they&#39;re attached to a real name?), and wonder if it could be extended to deal with non-logged-in users?<br><br>I propose that a &#39;limited&#39; posting ability - no HTML, say, and a low posts-per-day count (as measured by IP) - be given to non-logged-in users, with the Author field reading &#39;Lacksidacksical (posting as Guest)&#39; or &#39;as IP 192.168.0.0)&#39;. This would cover the fears of spambots (because, say, 5 spamthreads is significantly less of a problem than 200), and of malicious HTML (which would be limited to registered users).<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Now, some further points:<br><br>-HTML limits. It&#39;s clear from the posts visible on the screenshots that you have some sort of HTML limiting in place. I have a few questions about this:<br><br>-&gt; Is it a &#39;only these things are allowed&#39;, or a &#39;these things are forbidden&#39;?<br><br>-&gt; Does it prevent post-body HTML from spilling over down the thread, or from affecting the working of T-Board (such as buttons)?<br><br>-&gt; Does it allow bold/italics in post titles, while preventing them from spilling down T-Board, in the various modes?<br><br>-&gt; Does it allow people to do, at a minimum, the things HTML is used for here, specifically bold-italics-underline (font size?), links, embedded pictures, embedded pictures which are also links, and horizontal rules? Tables would be good too.<br><br>-Moderator powers. Ignoring entirely the question of whether we should have moderators at all, what is the <i>maximum</i> amount of power a moderator could exercise? I&#39;m assuming some combination of the following (please note: I am not advocating the existence of these powers, just asking if they /do/ exist):<br><br>-&gt;Variable-length bans (from the screenshot); this appears to be either by username or IP, although I suppose it could be requiring both.<br><br>-&gt;Thread-locking (from a flag in one screenshot); does this apply only to the entire thread, or is it flexible enough to lock down a specific subthread?<br><br>-&gt;Post/thread deleting. This appears to be fairly standard.<br><br>-&gt;Post/thread editing. I&#39;m not sure how standard this is.<br><br>-&gt;Editing the structure of T-Board. Yourwebapps allows a board owner to edit the appearance, such as the header text, and the colour scheme (such as to cause a blackout, say). This is clearly an ability which <i>someone</i> needs to have, since the header sometimes does need to be changed.<br><br>-&gt;You tell me. What else can T-Board moderators do? (Actually I see several of these are covered in your draft announcement. Never mind then)<br><br>-Where are you planning on hosting this? It needs to be somewhere that is constantly up, stable (we&#39;ve never to my knowledge actually had the Board disappear and be unaccessible; it would be terrible to move somewhere that did that regularly), and not predicated on any given person staying in the PPC. That means anyone&#39;s own server is out, as is anything paid for by one person. I suppose a community fee could cover a paid host, but honestly, that sounds like an appalling idea.<br><br>-Are the tags just a way of recording what forum things are in, or are they a set of specific tags, or are they an enter-your-tag-here, or a choose-from-these-or-enter-a-new-one? Each of these has different pros and cons.<br><br>-You appear to have a feature whereby the entire text of a post is visible on the &#39;preview&#39; in a thread. How does this cope with, for example, this post, which is pretty massive? I can foresee extremely long pages within a thread.<br><br>-Is there a word-limit for posting? If so, what is it?<br><br>-Do you have anything in place to prevent the current &#39;thread scrolls off the side of the Board when it gets too long&#39;? I imagine this could be done with either a collapsing of subthreads that go too far to the right (although this would reduce readability significantly), or with a very obvious arrow and de-indent. I believe Wikipedia does the latter.<br><br>I&#39;m sure there are more points I could raise and questions I could ask, but I&#39;ve been writing this for three hours on and off and I want to stop now.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Before I start, I just want to say thanks for the concrit. Also, T-Board is a wonderful way of referring to my thing. Mind if I steal it?<br><br>With that, let&#39;s get to it:<br><ul>
<br><li>All recent activity</li>
<br>Right now, the &quot;New&quot; tag works like the highlighting on the Board. This breaks down a bit in Modern mode, since you only see the root post of a thread before going in. For that, I think I could throw up an &quot;N new replies&quot; feature. That might help.<br><br><li>Finding where the replies are</li>
<br>In Modern mode, clicking on one of the links in a subforum takes you to the thread. When viewing a thread, &quot;New&quot;, &quot;Edited&quot;, etc. are still displayed. This might help with the reply discovery problem in Modern mode a bit.<br><br>The &quot;edited&quot; flag goes up on a post when someone makes an edit. If it shows up on the Modern mode link to a thread, it means the top post was edited.<br><br>&quot;Newest thread&quot; collects the thread that would be highest up the page in Classic mode. This behavior is probably not the Right Thing. I&#39;m open to suggestions for what &quot;Newest Thread&quot; should actually do.<br><br><li>Finding individual posts</li>
<br>I have nothing to add to your comment except that the search bar is a full-text search of the forum.<br><br><li>Threads that wander off topic and the wrong forum problem</li>
<br>On T-board, &quot;at least one post in thread is tagged with X&quot; ↔ &quot;post is in the X subforum&quot;. This means that the same thread can be in multiple subfora, which should alleviate the wandering thread problem. For example, someone posts something tagged &quot;Mission Report&quot; (or &quot;New PPC writing&quot; (who knows what the tag names will be)) and one arm of that thread turns into an RP. Then, someone can just put the &quot;RP&quot; tag somewhere in the diverging part of the thread. This causes the entire thread to appear in the &quot;RPs&quot; subforum and the &quot;Mission Reports&quot; subforum.<br><br>If Joe Newbie posts in the wrong subforum, which is equivalent to uses the tags inappropriately, the issue can be fixed in one of the replies simply by adding the correct tags. Of course, this only deals with under-tagging. The only way to deal with a over-tag is editing, either by a mod or the poster. If over-tagging/excessive cross posting becomes an issue, we should be able to implement a solution.<br><br><li>Instant top-of-page notices</li>
<br>You have a very valid point. The header can easily be made to appear at the top of subfora.<br><br>We also have a solution for things that vary in importance from a &quot;normal&quot; thread, the sort timestamp. The sort timestamp is initially equal to the time a post was made, but it can be changed by a mod. Changing the sort timestamp causes a thread (or subthread) posted at time X to behave as if it had been posted at time Y for the purposes of sorting the Board. This feature allows for some interesting things to be done. For example, the survey thread can kept alive for a little longer by ratcheting its sort timestamp up by a few days. An alternative use for this is banishing threads to the past, where people are less likely to see them. This is actually one component of the &quot;soft delete&quot;, which is meant to make a thread go away without actually deleting it. I&#39;ll expand on that in the mod powers section.<br>Posts with modified sort timestamps have that indicated when you specifically view the post, but not by the subject line with indicators for &quot;Edited&quot;, &quot;Locked&quot;, etc. This can easily be changed if we want that. For now, a sort timestamp change counts as an edit, which should serve as some indication that things have been happening.<br><br><li>The arbitrary divisions problem</li>
<br>I agree that that could and up being a problem, and I don&#39;t have a proposed solution to that one. Cross-posting might help a little bit, but it won&#39;t actually fix things. The fact that classic mode is the default might help prevent the situation from developing, but I&#39;m not at all certain of that.<br><br><li>No thread bumping</li>
<br>There is no thread bumping. We might have some form of that with the &quot;Newest Thread&quot; in Modern mode as discussed above, but that&#39;s still undecided.<br><br><li>Multi-threading</li>
<br>Yes.<br><br><li>Logins</li>
<br>Yeah. Logins are required right now. I personally think anan posting is more trouble than it&#39;s worth (see spambots and nymshifters).<br><br><li>HTML filtering</li>
<br>Yep. There&#39;s an HTML filter in place. It&#39;s a default-deny setup, so anything outside of the approved list is tossed out. Currently, the filter allows everything on your list except horizontal rules and color changes right now. Patching in horizontal rules and the &lt;font&gt; tag is a configuration change and is now on the to-do list. Allowing &lt;span style=&quot;...&quot;&gt; is being considered.<br><br>The filter prevents bad HTML from spilling down the thread.<br>Currently, there&#39;s no HTML in titles, but I can change that to a super-restrictive filter that only allows bold and italics if that is desired.<br><br>There&#39;s also support for Markdown posting so people don&#39;t have to try and fiddle around with HTML.<br><li>Mod powers</li>
<br>Currently, there&#39;s no &quot;User X is a mod&quot; indicators anywhere, which I think is a good thing.<br>Mods can, as you mentioned, create bans, which are publicly visible so people know what&#39;s going on.<br>Thread locking, along with thread poofing and sort timestamp tweaks, can be applied by a mod to any post, and they propagate to its replies. This means that subthreads can be locked.<br><br>Poofing a thread makes people accessing it have to go through a &quot;Do you really want to read this?&quot; prompt, the text of which is up for customization. That feature is supposed to be used for threads that are near &quot;Get the Nameless Admin to nuke it&quot; on the Nope scale.<br><br>Sort timestamp fiddling was discussed above.<br><br>Tossing these three things at a &quot;bad, bad, bad&quot; thread is, in my opinion, approximately equal to a reversible deletion.<br>Mods don&#39;t actually have the power to delete threads; the Nameless Admin has to preform database surgery to do that.<br><br>Anytime a mod does one of these things to a post or edits it, the post goes in as &quot;Edited&quot; with the author pointer of the new version changed from the user to the moderator. This feature is intended to prevent secret mod actions. The post accessible by clicking &quot;Previous Version&quot; from the edited post still retains a pointer to the original user&#39;s profile.<br><br><li>Entire text</li>
<br>Yep. T-Board displays the entire text right now. I don&#39;t expect that to be a problem. Reddit et al. don&#39;t seem to die because of that.<br><br><li>Long threads</li>
<br>No, I don&#39;t have much of anything for long threads right now. However, I noticed that the T-Board doesn&#39;t smush threads as much as the old Board does (<a href="http://imgur.com/Y6mybGH">here</a> is a screenshot of the &quot;Power Rangers RP&quot; from the other board imported onto the T-Board). I like your Wikipedia-style arrow solution, which I never considered.<br><br><li>Word limit</li>
<br>None.<br><br><li>Tag choice</li>
<br>Those map to subforums, and so the set of tags is fixed, but amendable by the Nameless Admin.<br><br><li>The header</li>
<br>That, along with the styling, are in the code for the Board. This means that the Nameless Admin is needed to push those changes.<br><br><li>Hosting</li>
<br>That&#39;s actually an open question. I&#39;m open to suggestions. The project is in Ruby on Rails, which opens up certain cloud hosting platforms, though that kills our internal search box.<br><br>I hope I addressed all of your points to your satisfaction. If you have any more questions, please feel free to reply.</ul></p>

            <p>(I&#39;ve made an effort to maintain the order of this and group replies to similar points together. I have not succeeded)<br><br><i>Probably the biggest feature we&#39;ve added is editing[...]</i><br><br>I have to say it&#39;s more fun to talk about the minor mistakes which are usually all that get made than to edit them away, but okay. I&#39;m thinking that the Edited tag works best as it is - simply because that way anyone complaining will know there&#39;s been a change. I have to ask whether there is any record of the previous post, however: in the (very rare) event that someone edited an inflammatory post to cry foul, would it be possible to disprove their assertion that all they edited was spelling?<br><br>Floating threads: This seems to be a reasonable proposal. The precise length of time used in the float calculations would need calibration, of course.<br><br>Recent Activity: Unfortunately I haven&#39;t had a chance to test whether editing a post updates the New tag. I assume not? Either way, since obviously it&#39;s impossible to recognise a visitor by the smell of their perfume alone ;), Dann&#39;s multiple-ways-of-flagging-new-posts suggestion seems most sensible. Of course you currently don&#39;t have anything saying how much new material is behind a collapsed subforum or thread title... but Tomash has already noted that.<br><br>Tagging &amp; forums: it seems, then, that the best way to move a thread into the Badfic Discussion subforum is to forego editing the top post on someone&#39;s behalf, but simply to tag your reply correctly. I assume that doesn&#39;t remove the thread from the &#39;Everything Else&#39; forum? No, apparently not. Bet there&#39;s still complaints.<br><br>Search bar: At the moment just throws an error. If it&#39;s to be a full text search, please make sure it orders the results by age. I&#39;ve seen several that just throw things at you in a random order...<br><br>Non-logging-in: Dann seems to think that this will be available (with username checking - will this cover people posting as &#39;Huines0r0n&#39;, or even &#39;Huinesoron &#39;, or just a simple name-match?). Tomash seems to think &#39;an[o]n posting is more trouble than it&#39;s worth&#39;, but this is stated as a personal belief, not as a firm decision on what will be possible. Okay.<br><br>HTML: I disagree with switching to BBCode, since you&#39;re whitelisting anyway. I would accept both being available, but I&#39;ve always preferred HTML directly. It&#39;s usually more flexible, at least in my head. I also think HTML in titles - yes, just italics and bold - are important, since it&#39;s the best way to get people&#39;s attention in a long thread. I&#39;ve done it several times in the last couple of weeks.<br><br>Mod powers: If it&#39;s entirely programmable, we&#39;ll leave this to a dedicated discussion of why on earth we&#39;d even need them.<br><br>No word limit &amp; all text visible in thread view: This seems like a disaster waiting to happen. Imagine a spambot which threw a million copies of the text of <i>War and Peace</i> up - in Cyrillic? Does the Nameless Admin have the power to delete a post without having to scroll to the bottom of it? Would this overload most hosting systems? But even disregarding that, as <a href="http://ppc-posting-board-2-proto.herokuapp.com/posts/2762">this thread</a> indicates, the full-text version (full-image version, rather) can make you wildly lose track of what&#39;s replying where.<br><br>Hosting: It&#39;s not so much the existence of cost that&#39;s the problem, so much as the fact that it relies on a) the payer never leaving, and b) if they do, them finding a new willing payer and passing it on. We currently have <b>no</b> members who were here when this Board was founded. At present, we can go on forever, because it&#39;s free. That won&#39;t be the case on a paid board, however many people post now and say they&#39;d be willing to pay.<br><br>Tags: I don&#39;t think we need a free-range set of tags. That&#39;s what post titles are for. Just making them subforum-maps works fine.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>And some new points I&#39;ve noted from fiddling around with it. A lot of these are fairly cosmetic, but important:<br><br>-The only &#39;exit&#39; from a thread is &#39;All posts&#39;. This drops back to the Classic page (okay) or the Subforums index (not okay). There&#39;s no way to get back to your current subforum if you&#39;re in that mode without clicking back through to it. I would also significantly prefer a button along with the other buttons under a post (ie, the Board&#39;s Return To Messages)<br><br>-The message entry box is too long. It pushes the submit button and tags off the screen and forces me to use the scrollbar.<br><br>-Lack of (nm) or equivalent feature.<br><br>-Related to this... when looking down a thread (eg <a href="http://ppc-posting-board-2-proto.herokuapp.com/posts/171">this</a>) it&#39;s pretty difficult to spot which post you&#39;re currently on. You&#39;ve already bolded this, so I don&#39;t have a solution. The Board uses italics and drops the link in the title, which seems to work better.<br><br>-Is there a reason your links are pastel blue instead of the traditional PPC-Red? I think this (and the big red bars in the header!) would go a long way to making T-Board look less antiseptic.<br><br>- This may be a result of the massive archived threads, but T-Board&#39;s Classic front page is actually LONGER than the Board&#39;s<br><br>-Locked threads still let you write your post before telling you you can&#39;t post it.<br><br>-Poofing: This currently doesn&#39;t do anything on thread view other than add a little red flag. And since the entire text of every post is visible on thread view, that means it only affects people who click straight through to it or want to reply.<br><br>-I was going to say a &#39;reply&#39; button directly from thread view would be useful, but it turns out there already is one. ;) Maybe an actual button rather than just a link?<br><br>-How many threads will T-Board store? The Board has a cutoff somewhere in 2008, but from that point on, it will apparently store everything we do forever. Will the same apply to T-Board? That&#39;s kind of important (to use some real examples, the 2010 and 2011 Badfic Games are archived solely on the Board).<br><br>-Is <a href="http://ppc-posting-board-2-proto.herokuapp.com/posts/2774">this</a> a good thing?<br><br><hr>

            <p>(I&#39;m not directing this at you specifically, EF, but this seemed like a good place to put it)<br><br>T-Board allows both filtered HTML and Markdown. Markdown is a simplified syntax for writing the sort of things that often come across the Board, like bold, italics, links, etc. For example, in Markdown, you can bold text **like this**. A link looks like <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2013/a%20href=%22http://example.com/%22%3Ehttp://example.com/%3C/a">Text for link</a>. I put that in there so people wouldn&#39;t have to fiddle with HTML if they didn&#39;t want to.<br><br>What are the Board&#39;s thoughts on this setup, which should probably be explained more clearly on the &quot;New Post&quot; page?</p>

            <p>I&#39;d like to thank everyone for their bug reports, feature requests, suggestions, and concrit, especially hS, who has pointed out several problems (or possible solutions to known problems) I never thought of. Please keep that sort of thing coming!<br><br>Some of the things people have mentioned, like the &quot;deep thread problem&quot; and the mess that could be caused by really tall posts, are things Dann or I will fix when we&#39;re not too busy with real life. I actually have an idea for the tall post problem which involves throwing &quot;Show more&quot; links and limiting the height of each post to some limit until the link is clicked client-side. I just need to figure out how to implement that. <br><br>Other things, especially guest posting, editing, and the multiple views model, should probably be discussed a bit more before I go poking around in them.  As an aside, implementing guest posting given the current state of the code might be a little tricky because I pulled in a library of code that handles most of the login-related stuff, since that kind of code is notoriously tricky to get right.</p>

            <p>First off - the important thing to remember here is that this is a prototype. We can change <i>literally everything</i> about it, if we want.<br><br>Probably the biggest feature we&#39;ve added is editing - this is meant to be how one fixes a typo, broken link, etc. In fact, we&#39;d considered making posts lock after a given time after posting. Edits should be in-place, without affecting ordering, newness, etc. The intent here is that if you have new ideas to bring up, they should be in a new post. The &quot;edited&quot; tag is there so people can&#39;t edit away inflamatory posts and then cry &quot;OMG you&#39;re so mean!&quot; (Hopefully, this won&#39;t be a concern - but we decided that safety was better than sorriness on this one.) Personally, I don&#39;t think that the edited flag should appear at all on the main views - it should only show up with the posts themselves. I&#39;d be interested in hearing what you think?<br><br>One of the big themes that seems to come up in your post is how we define &quot;newest&quot; - which, fortunately, is completely up to us! You do raise a good point, that we&#39;ve seen that bumping on the Classic Board causes trouble, while not bumping on a Modern Board is a pretty strong contradiction of what people expect. And you&#39;re very right that we want people to be interacting with essentially the same set of threads, regardless of view. <br><br>There may be a reachable middle ground here... We could have threads float - rather than a reply automatically bumping a thread to the top, it adds to the thread&#39;s buoyancy. As threads age, they become sinky, with their bouyancy counting for less and less. (This could be a very aggressive sinking policy - after, say, a week, they could be back in their time-ordered position.) It would be a change for both views, but it keeps interesting threads from falling off the front page for a while, while also enforcing a death time.<br><br>And on individual comments:<br><br>On flagging new posts: Unfortunately, if someone visits us from an IP that they&#39;ve never visited from before, on a PC they&#39;ve never used before, and doesn&#39;t log in, we have no way of knowing that they&#39;re them. This is simply one of the fundamental limitations of the internet. What we could do is, once people have logged in, park a cookie on their box that says &quot;I believe that this person is the Sunflower Official&quot;, and then reference that to their last known visit time - this cookies wouldn&#39;t give them any permissions, of course, but it would give us cross-computer last-visited time once we know who that computer is. We could also set it up to work in multiple ways - if you don&#39;t have any of our cookies, it highlights the last 24 hours, and if you do have a cookie, it highlights everything since your last visit instead.<br><br>I don&#39;t recall what the status of the search bar is in the prototype - when it&#39;s done, of course, it will be a full text search, and do all the expected shiny things.<br><br>The dual setup does risk fun with offtopicness, but there are a few mitigation strategies: Firstly, tags on the Classic Board are forums on the Modern Board, so as long as people tag things appropriately, they should show up correctly. Secondly, and this one is a bit more hand-wavey at the moment, replies can be tagged as well. So, if a newbie thread turns into a badfic discussion, a badfic discussion post can be tagged with &quot;badfic discussion&quot;, and the entire thread will also appear in the Badfic Discussion forum. (With appropriate tags to make it obvious that it exists in both places, user configurable, subject to design review and usability study, etc, etc.)<br><br>Note visibility is trivial to add - every main Board page should have the same header with constitution, wiki, etc, IMO. It&#39;s all of a single line of code to add the header, so we can change our minds on it for free.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure that slow subfora is a huge problem - as long as they&#39;re all visible from the main Modern Board page, we have a single place that shows where all the new posts are, so new posts aren&#39;t going to get lost in the shuffle.<br><br>One of our thoughts with logging-in is that a lot of people (myself included!) don&#39;t log into the Board to post. We would like to keep this ability - set it up so that users can decide if they want non-logs to be able to post as them or not.<br><br>Regarding spambots, it&#39;ll be a lot easier to handle the content of spam than the sources, I suspect. Given that we have members with multiple computers, using proxies, not logging in, etc, detecting content is a lot easier than detecting a deliberately stealthy user. We definitely plan to create repeat-thread detection, which will happily snark at anyone trying to ypur the board.<br><br>*Dons the Security Fedora to address the point on HTML*<br><br>Allowed HTML tags will be whitelisted, not blacklisted - we will allow only tags that we know to be inoffensive, and disallow (probably by stripping them out) the rest. This is the only way to really protect against cross-site scripting: there are thousands of tricky ways to get javascript to run on a page, it&#39;s impossible to blacklist them all.<br><br>This is going to be a large set of tags - text formatting, links (minus certain vulnerable attributes like onClick), images, tables, etc, are all totally legit.<br><br>I suspect that we would want to switch over to BBCode-esque tags, rather than raw HTML - it&#39;s much harder to escape the post section with bbcode that we translate, on the backend, to HTML.<br><br>As far as mod powers are concerned, that&#39;s not really a question of what the prototype supports as much as it&#39;s a question of how much power we, the community, want to give our mods. Everything you&#39;ve listed is totally doable.<br><br>Hosting is a very good question. You&#39;re right that we don&#39;t want it predicated on a single member, but at the same time, we will want someone relatively technically savvy in a Nameless Admin position paying the bills, keeping an eye on the database, etc. Sadly, this will almost definitely not be free. So, it&#39;s a big question. I am totally against a mandatory community fee, and really have no good ideas beyond that. Hosting is probably not going to be expensive - I&#39;d be surprised if it was more than $20 a month.<br><br>Tags will have to be chose-from-a-set to keep the forums under control - we could possibly have two sets of tags, a canonical set that map to subfora and an enter-your-own set that don&#39;t? Even that seems complicated. I dunno.</p>

            <p>I still like it.<br><br>I also still have a twitch about the gradient-shaded smooth-cornered buttons, and the non-gradient but still rounded tags.

It&#39;s something about the contrast between lo-tek stark white background and hi-tek rounded-gradiented buttons.

            <p>As part of my job, I took a good long look at one of the chemicals we make.

In an effort to try and make sure things didn&#39;t keep going wrong and going unnoticed, I decided we needed to have a weekly report.<br><br>Again using Excel, I cobbled together an automated graph generator. &quot;Brilliant,&quot; I said. &quot;I&#39;ll just email it round every week, and things will stop going wrong!&quot;<br><br>Or, as it turned out, I could email it round every week, get no replies, and see no-one bother to act on the information I was very handily packing into a bite-sized morsel for them. Things keep going wrong with the same frequency as before.<br><br>And yes, that&#39;s left me feeling somewhat demotivated about doing it at all.

            <p><i>No moderators. Please.</i><br><br>Again. Why? I don&#39;t understand. The IRC works just fine with having people who have the authority to go &quot;Hey no not cool, I shall apply a boot to your butt so you understand that what you just said was unconscionable&quot;. How is that different from people on a forum who have the explicit authority to step in and say &quot;Hey, no, PPCer #413, what you just said in post #1025 was not cool, don&#39;t go exploding this thread into a flame war or you&#39;re off posting privileges for a couple days so you can cool down&quot;?<br><br><i>Because when we had thread bumping on, multiple people got extremely annoyed at other people for having conversations, or posting badfics to the mega badfic thread of doom which ended up three times the length of the rest of the front page combined.

Hell, I could see The Mega Badfic Thread being a sticky thread at the top where people could post all their NSFB links. In a forum type situation, you&#39;d only get... oh, here.

Bumping matters a hell of a lot less when it&#39;s one line being above another.<br><br><i>(PS: But tradition is fun!)</i><br><br>Until it stops being fun and starts being clunky, obsolete, and kind of an awful system.</p>

            <p>I offer two pieces of evidence.<br><br>Exhibit One: At one point, we actually <i>had</i> a forum-type board: <a href="http://ppcwebmaster.proboards.com/index.cgi">this one</a>. It didn&#39;t get used (and appears to be taken over by spambots). The only reason I remember it at all is that it&#39;s where the A/V Division stories were posted.<br><br>Exhibit Two: Not so very long ago, we tried turning the thread-bumping function of the Board on (since that&#39;s the thing people most often complain about). It was... pretty much a disaster, with one gigantic thread of badfic posts dominating the Board until people started telling other people <i>not to link to badfics on the PPC Board</i>. I don&#39;t think something which utterly removes the point of this place is a good idea, myself.<br><br>What we put in place instead is the current highlighting of &#39;new replies to old threads&#39;, which is actually incredibly useful.<br><br>So that&#39;s my evidence. Oh, And One More Thing:<br><br>Exhibit Three: People who spend all their time on the Board <i>already</i> don&#39;t know people who spend all their time in the IRC. I don&#39;t think that divide is a good thing, since we&#39;re actually trying to maintain a <i>single</i> social space here. Regardless of the intentions of the creators, breaking the Board into sub-forums would, does and will lead to people who only visit certain ones. I don&#39;t want the PPC fracturing even more.<br><br>... andonemorething:<br><br>Exhibit Four: What&#39;s the <i>point</i>? The Board is currently moving as fast as I&#39;ve seen it in a long time, and we&#39;ve <i>still</i> got nearly two weeks worth of threads on the front page. And no, still-visited threads aren&#39;t dropping off (you have to scroll halfway up the page to find a recent reply - KittTheCat&#39;s newbie thread), and on the extremely rare occasions where that&#39;s actually happened, such as the Badfic Contests, we just start another thread. Splitting into sub-forums would just give us a skein of ultra-low-traffic forums.<br><br>On a more personal, non-exhibit note: I like to be able to see what the PPC is thinking just by scrolling down a single page. If I had to click ten times just to see all the post titles (five sub forums, one click in, one click back out), I probably wouldn&#39;t do it. And this is <i>me</i>.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>What I was under the impression of is that the categories would be more &quot;badfic&quot; &quot;new mission&quot; &quot;new people&quot; &quot;EVERYTHING ELSE&quot;, since the badfic and new people threads seem to be what people are concerned about when they talk about stuff getting nudged off.

            <p>And this has been the root of most objections to, well, most things over the years:<br><br>The PPC doesn&#39;t divide things into neat little boxes like that. We never have. Newbie threads spawn massive conversations, badfic plugs even more so. And, and, you want to separate <i>missions</i> - the reason we&#39;re all here in the first place - from the central community hub?<br><br>And. And. We currently have 25 threads for the past 2 weeks. That&#39;s about two per day, and that&#39;s pretty much all we ever have. <i>Why</i> do we need a forum? There is not enough going on here to make it necessary or useful. I have not yet heard a good argument (er, any argument?) for this - just years of &#39;It won&#39;t hurt!&#39; and &#39;The Board is old!&#39;. No-one has ever given me any convincing arguments that a forum offers any <i>benefits</i> to the PPC community.<br><br>Again, we turned thread bumping on (the one thing people were consistantly saying would make things !!vastly better!!), and we turned it <i>off</i> again after a giant thread ate the Board. People who had been advocating bumping for years decided it wasn&#39;t worth it.<br><br><i>You&#39;d have the option of viewing the Board as-is. Presumably there&#39;d also be an option to not have thread-bump.</i><br><br>While I can just about see the advantages of having alterable layouts to suit preference, the idea of some people having bumped threads and some not... is pretty terrible. &quot;Hey, why&#39;d you give up on our conversation?&quot; &#39;Er, it dropped off the front page...&#39; &quot;No it didn&#39;t, it&#39;s right at the top!&#39;. And when a megathread eats the Board for people with bumping <i>on</i>, half the community won&#39;t know what they&#39;re on about...<br><br>Oh. And, to cut off the &quot;Logins means no spambots!&quot; argument before you make it - yes, it does. It also means no in-character posts, an extra hurdle for newbies, no in-character posts, no dropping into nameless anonymity on occasion, and no in-character posts.<br><br>Aaaand. The one other argument I can foresee you making is that proboards-style threading - where all the posts are visible on the same page - would be better because you could see the posts. This is sort of true, but again, the PPC has a wild time with multi-threading. A single column of answers wouldn&#39;t work here.<br><br>The Livejournal-style - where top posts and the first few replies are fully visible, and the others are collapsed - might work, but it gets awfully complicated to navigate. I <i>like</i> being able to click into a thread - anywhere, mind you, not just the top post - and see at a glance roughly what people are saying. It&#39;s brilliant.<br><br>Like I say: no-one&#39;s ever offered me an argument as to <b>why a forum would be better</b>. Please go ahead and do so. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not as bothered by the white-space, however about the excessive effort it takes to read a huge thread is offputting for me too, I was actually going to point that out once I finished reading all the replies since last night, and now it&#39;s been made for me. ^_^<br><br>I mostly don&#39;t even go through the steps Lilac stated anymore, I see a huge thread and I just skip it, so I miss out on a lot of the RP, and such because I just don&#39;t have the time or patience or both to sit and fiddle with trying to read things in order, and find where I am at the bottom of the thread (even with the italics) and figure out if there&#39;s been a reply to something I&#39;ve already read on the way down, and I know that&#39;s not anyone&#39;s fault but mine. But it still means I&#39;m less active than I might be otherwise. <br><br>Also, I didn&#39;t even know the purpose of the highlighting, it shows up so infrequently I thought it was just a glitch somewhere, like the one that makes the board show up blue and purple on occasion.

It becomes hard to see what posts are in response to sometime when you have the main post, and 3 replies to that post that lead to three different discussions that people jump in on at various levels. So you read the whole reply thread, and then have to &quot;scroll obnoxioulsly&quot; around to figure out which mid point dot of it that hanging, less indented, reply at the bottom is because the discussion has taken up more than the screen length and width. Where as with a forum style, replies are in order, a quick refresh lets you see if there was any replies since you started reading, and with the quote function a lot of them have you know what specifically someone is replying to if they got &quot;posted over&quot; with a huge reply tree. I know you can kind of quote on this board too, but that only helps if the people replying to a certain thing know to quote it in their post before hand. Which they don&#39;t if a discussion takes place after them and creates a bigger tree line of responses.<br><br>I hope that makes sense...</p>

            <p>I think I prefer the more forum-y board set up, it makes it easier, for me at least, to keep track of new replies. Though I must say, having hung around here for a couple months, it&#39;s not as daunting as it first looks like, so I won&#39;t be overly disappointed if the board stays here either. :)</p>

            <p>It was decided a while back that we wouldn&#39;t spork RPF any more, mostly because it <i>is</i> rather difficult to know if certain actions would be in character for our beloved actors/ writers/ etc. I don&#39;t recall exactly when the decision was made, but I think it would&#39;ve been arould 2010-ish.When I joined in 2008 one of my Agents was in RPF work, and Trojie and Pads were producing quite a few RPF missions themselves.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t exactly recall this, either, but in addition to what Cassie said, I think real people go in the same category as quarantined continua and religious texts: since it&#39;s not a good idea to write fanfic of it in the first place, it&#39;s equally not a good idea to write a mission involving it, since a mission itself is a kind of fanfic (albeit very meta).<br><br>If anyone feels like being a historian and finding out for sure, it should be possible to use the Board&#39;s search bar to do some investigation. Anything posted during most of 2008 and onward can still be found. I think it only displays so many results at a time, though, so you have to pick your search terms carefully.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>There are OFUs for Doctor Who, yes, but they&#39;re all on hiatuses (OFUs are so tricky to write; I should know). <br><br>And logistically it&#39;s extremely hard to write an OFU for that fandom because there&#39;s eleven Doctors, six Masters, countless companions and monsters, and extreme amounts of timey-wimey stuff that tend to contradict each other. If anything, I&#39;d suggest doing what I&#39;ve done with Sherlock Holmes, and have a Classic Who campus and a New Who campus so we can focus specifically on various areas. The OFU for Doctor Who that I read had separate campuses for Torchwood and Sarah Jane Adventures as well.</p>

            <p>OFUs are tricky. I mean, there&#39;s at least three abandoned Trek OFUs (one of which became affiliated with the PPC, and is the origin of mini-tribbles), and I tend to update very slowly because it is difficult <s>and I&#39;m a procrastinator</s>.<br><br>Wow, Doctor Who is really hard to manage. I mean with Star Trek you just have to divide up the series. Some of the Trek OFUs only focused on one series, one of them tried to do all five but basically ended up focusing on one. OFAS has two campuses, one with three and one with two, so that each series can get attention without there having to be five campuses. But with Doctor Who you have multiple versions of some of the same characters. And I have this feelng that the universe would implode if the all the Doctors met each other. Just a feeling though. I don&#39;t know much about Doctor Who.</p>

            <p>He always was paranoid about people meeting their time-copies. It&#39;s not really a rule, though; there have been several Doctors in one place on at least four occasions, and the Doctor was in the same time and area as his past self in the same regeneration on at least two more.<br><br>When dealing with multiple versions of the same character, or multiple characters that go by the same name, it would start getting even more complicated than Doctor Who inherently is. For example, there are three separate characters that call themselves the Dalek Emperor, one of which is the same character as Davros, the Fourth Doctor&#39;s main villain and creator of the Daleks, after one point in his life, but not he&#39;s not permanently the Emperor after that point.<br>How would someone even deal with that? Would there be two versions of Davros, the Emperor and the wheelchair-scientist? Would the two be constantly fighting over who the &quot;real&quot; Davros is? Would we have a second Dalek Civil War between the Vault Daleks and the Imperial Daleks for the validity of the Davros name?<br><br>I tried to make a situation that sounded complex and unwieldly, but that could actually be a pretty cool recurring scenario if it was written right.

            <p>Minis follow a protocol.  They are part of the canons of the OFUs and the PPC, and we have rules about where they come from and how to adopt them.<br><br>We just recently had a discussion about mini sources, and requiring them to have come from a <b>published, written</b> thing.  Tawaki has been asked to not do this anymore before, and he is still flagrantly disregarding that request.  Also, when Tawaki makes these posts pulling minis out of the Void or wherever, it sets a bad example for newbies, and encourages them to also not follow the rules.  He is not entitled to follow different rules than everyone else.<br><br>Additionally, making up minis (which is essentially what is happening here, regardless of whether Tawaki actually found these from badfics or not) is disrespectful to the writers who actually put the work into writing an OFU for their fandom and using them as staff, or into a mission to a badfic that spawns them.  It deprives the legitimately-discovered minis of their uniqueness.<br><br>So for the record, everybody: Minis must come from a <b>published story</b> somewhere in the Canon Protection Initiative.  They cannot be adopted or placed for adoption just from being noticed somewhere.<br><br>(Tawaki, feel free to jump in.  I feel like I&#39;m talking in third person about someone who&#39;s standing right next to me in the room.)</p>

Besides the party, I gift you with a fancy chocolate cake that actually tastes good (and can turn into a different cake of your choice if you don&#39;t actually like chocolate cake), many presents (that is, a gentle shower of them--wouldn&#39;t do to bruise the birthday Boarder!), and a year&#39;s supply of Swiss Bleepolate! Enjoy your birthday!<br><br>(Also, I feel like you&#39;re one of the newbies I never greeted. So...hi, Tomash! Welcome to the Board! My usual gift is Swiss Bleepolate, which I&#39;ve already given you, so...I&#39;ll give you a tribble instead. If you don&#39;t know Star Trek, it&#39;s a cute, little, purring ball of fluff. Literally.  They&#39;re very nice, and have a soothing effect on most humanoids. Just don&#39;t feed them too much, or you&#39;ll end up with a lot of tribble babies!)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>This thread was conceived for those of us who have been here since the PPC was essentially a Lord of the Rings fanwriting community with a really big twist - but is of course open to everyone. ;) It&#39;d be great to see some of the newer faces talking about the good old things.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>So in the past few days The Hobbit Part 1 has come out on DVD, and I figure this is a good time to talk about the entire series of Middle-earth films, what we think of them, and where we hope they&#39;ll go - not to mention how we <i>feel</i> about them, which is a somewhat separate issue. Also, it&#39;s awesome to engage in nostalgia on occasion (and that includes anyone just seeing the films now - you can be nostalgic about new stuff, right?).<br><br>It&#39;s weird to think that it&#39;s been nearly <i>twelve years</i> since <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i> came out, and we were all introduced to Huge-Eyed Frodo and His Blond Friend Leggy (Also Some Other Blokes). Prior to that, <i>Lord of the Rings</i> visuals consisted of:<br><br>-The Bakshi film and its Rankin-Bass sequel, which were... not masterpieces of the cinematic art.<br>-A bunch of paintings by various artists, some of which included Boromir in a horned helmet.<br>-Tolkien&#39;s pictures of trees.<br><br>And suddenly we were hit with this frankly incredibly cinematic assault.<br><br>And yes, it was pretty awesome. There were things we all complained about in FotR - notably the absence of Tom Bombadil and the inexplicable presence of Arwen - but for the most part? It was a bloomin&#39; good film, and the fandom was wild about it. I know I was. It was <i>pretty</i>, too, and it felt like Middle-earth. I mean, yes, it was a shame about some of the lines they cut (at one point I was sorely tempted to write my own &#39;Return of the Shadow&#39; script solely to get &quot;By Elbereth and Luthien the Fair, you shall have neither the Ring nor me!&quot; onto the imaginary screen), but it was a good film.<br><br>Then came <i>The Two Towers</i>. I may be wrong, but I think this was the film that provoked the most fury amongst fans. Treebeard says no? Faramir tries to take the Hobbits to Minas Tirith? <b>Faramir did what?!?</b><br><br>I still get angry about that. I mean, really - it was stupid. I don&#39;t understand why they did it, since it&#39;s not like the story lacks in tension. And then the Battle of the Hornburg (in the very apt words of Philosopher at Large) &#39;ate the film&#39;... yeah.<br><br>But was it still pretty? Did it still feel like Middle-earth? In a lot of ways, yes. But... y&#39;know, Movie!Ithilien never felt like the decaying garden it should have been, and Movie!Rohan felt a lot more gritty-dark, a lot less noble than it should have been.<br><br>With expectations balanced partway between &#39;soaring&#39; and &#39;suitably lowered&#39;, we went into <i>Return of the King</i>, which... I&#39;m still not sure how I feel about. FotR I loved, TTT I&#39;m upset over, but RotK... well. It gave us Flaming Denethor, Gothmog the Hideous, Searchlight Sauron, The Little Green Dead Men of Dunharrow, and a complete lack of the Scouring of the Shire, also known as &#39;the moral of the whole story&#39;. But it also gave us the Ride of the Rohirrim, Sam storming the Tower of Cirith Ungol, Black Sails Before Gondor, The Eagles Are Coming, and the Grey Ships. For all the wrong reasons, it was an emotional ride.<br><br>And then... well, there were the Extended Editions, with their own weird flaws (no, Sam does not get given rope as a present! <i>Stop making Gimli look stupid</i>!), and then it was over. Done. No more trilogy.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Now comes the bit I know nothing about: the two fan-films. I saw the trailer for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunt_for_Gollum">The Hunt for Gollum</a> when it first appeared, and squealed because I actually recognise the castle they use in there somewhere - I used to play hide-and-seek in the ruins when I was younger (and heck, who says I&#39;ve stopped? Roll on summer!). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_of_Hope">Born of Hope</a> I only found out about very recently. But... I&#39;ve not actually watched either of them. Has anyone? Are they any good? Please tell me they&#39;re any good...<br><br><hr>
<br><br>And then we had a decade of ups and downs as various people claimed they were making <i>The Hobbit</i>, that they weren&#39;t making <i>The Hobbit</i>, that the Estate had forbidden anyone from ever making <i>The Hobbit</i>, that it would be two films, that it would be three films... and then, quite suddenly, we discovered that <i>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</i> was coming out in late 2012.<br><br>And it actually did, too. ;)<br><br><i>Unexpected Journey</i> was not, I have to admit, up to the standards of FotR. It was about as pretty - with the notable exceptions of Azog the Ugly and Goblin-King the Wobbly (ugh, who thought that was a good idea?), and possibly Radagast the Mucky - but it diverged from the plot for dubious reasons. Azog&#39;s alive? There&#39;s a gigantic battle in Goblin Town? Stone giants try to kill them? And the list don&#39;t half go on.<br><br>But... it was awesome to see the Shire again, to see Elrond again (to see Imladris at war!), to see the Eagles again. The characters (or at least the ones you learnt to tell apart) were brilliant, especially Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin and Kili (aka &#39;The ones they bothered most with&#39;). The end credits song was fantastic ;). And, unlike TTT, it didn&#39;t actually break anyone&#39;s motives (&quot;A chance for Faramir, Captain of Gondor, to show his quality... of kidnapping and evil!&quot; Grr).<br><br>I also like - love - the fact that they&#39;re working in more of the backstory. Some of it seems to be hideously broken (Ding, dong, the Witch-King&#39;s dead...), but a lot of it worked really well. And it&#39;s always brilliant to see Galadriel again. And Saruman, for that matter, even if he did get a bit ranty.<br><br>And there&#39;s two more films to go. What I&#39;ve seen suggests that <i>Desolation of Smaug</i> will finish with Smaug&#39;s death, which implies <i>There and Back Again</i> will cover the Battle of the Five Armies and Bilbo&#39;s journey home. Thinking about how that breaks the plot down, I strongly suspect the Necromancer will remain a going concern into TaBA, since otherwise DoS would need to cover Mirkwood, barrels, finding the door, irritating Smaug, Bard killing Smaug, <i>and</i> the entire Sauron plot. So I&#39;m guessing we&#39;ll see the driving-out of the Necromancer interleaved with the leadup to the B5A, and then have a reasonably calm ending as Bilbo goes home.<br><br>All in all? I&#39;m excited. Despite disappointments at times (and he&#39;s supposed to be an example of <i>what Boromir isn&#39;t</i> - why should we like Faramir more than Boromir if they both succumb to the Ring? Especially since Faramir took way less time to do so...) I&#39;ve been a fan of the series since it started. Here&#39;s hoping they can end it on a high note.<br><br>And <i>then</i> will be the time for the eight-movie marathon... anyone up for it? ;P<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That was detailed. But all good points, I agree that in their attempt to expand Faramir, they only made him worse. It&#39;s honestly impossible for me to talk about movies to anyone not directly in front of my face, though. I could go on for hours.<br>Relating more to the PPC itself, what has the first part of The Hobbit done to the badfic community?Judging from what the three LotR movies did, I can&#39;t expect anything good. I suppose it&#39;s harder to lust over dwarves, but I worry for Fili and Kili&#39;s safety... On top of all the other very scary varities of fanfiction that just shouldn&#39;t happen.</p>

            <p>It&#39;ll be basically an entire day of Middle-earth. My inner fangirl is squealing.<br><br>I personally can understand what they were doing with Arwen&#39;s inclusion and all the other additions of female characters into the films aside from the canon roles - most of the books are, after all, predominantly a sausagefest, and in modern times inclusiveness is in (or you get Tumblr crazies shouting &quot;THE HOBBIT IS A SEXIST PILE OF ORC-DUNG BECAUSE THERE AREN&#39;T ANY LADIES IN IT&quot; because really, I don&#39;t think I saw a single female with lines in the pages of that book).<br><br>And as for other changes - well, Peter Jackson seems to function on the rule of Why Not. Stone giants did exist in the Hobbit, but Peter took it and ran away with it and made the Misty Mountains far more dangerous than it should be (falling off a stone giant in your sleep, much? And if the giants were part of the mountain, does that mean orcs live inside them like parasitic maggots? What happens if the giants relocate?). That&#39;s just one example, though.<br><br>I enjoyed the films as films in their own right, having seen them long after the DVDs came out and such. I suppose now that PJ has the money to really get down to the details in the Hobbit, he&#39;s just really... ran off with the story. I look forward to future installments, but I will admit some parts of the Hobbit were just horribly paced and I wonder why they didn&#39;t keep it to two films. Three seems a bit overkill.<br><br>I like McCoy as Radagast. The bunny sled sounds like something the Doctor would do.</p>

            <p>... while they added Arwen-the-random-horsemaid (and gave us innumerably fanfics unironically using &#39;She-elf&#39;) and her Amazing(ly Random) Depression, they took our Ioreth the healer, who was actually a character.

            <p>...but have owned the special extended editions of the LotR movies ever since they came out. The Ride of the Rohirrim is possibly my favorite piece of music in a movie ever. Stuff like Evil!Faramir and giving Treebeard some of Tom Bombadil&#39;s lines (yes, really) still annoys the heck out of me though. Oh, and leaving out the Scouring of the Shire <i>and</i> killing Saruman off in Isengard (just before Pippin picks up the Palantir) was VERY BAD. The only thing worse I can imagine is making a Silmarillion movie (which is probably never going to happen) and leaving out the Oath. *knocks on wood*</p>

            <p>...that was...amazing... Okay, I just skimmed over your <i>Fall of the Noldor</i>, but still...wow. I still privately think of the meeting of Feanor and Finwe in Mandos in humorous terms (&quot;Son, you are so grounded.&quot; :D), but that bit in the script was heartbreaking. Why is Fingon mentioning the sun in his song? You know, the &quot;song of Valinor that the Noldor had made of old&quot;...</p>

            <p>I actually skipped two scenes in my original writing of FotN-H (the Kinslaying and the rescue of Maedhros), and we ended up with a song written specifically for that event - &#39;O my well-formed cousin, where art thou?&#39; or somesuch.<br><br>I never liked it, and when I came back to reboot the Project, I edited it.

            <p>Are you saying you translated Shakespeare into Quenya? Awesome! Pretty much all the Quenya I know comes from the translations of the names. However, I <i>can</i> sing two versions of a popular song in it. Popular with Discworld Dwarfs, that is (gold, gold, gold, gold...) :D<br> I appreciate the sentiment in using Sam&#39;s song, but getting timelines wrong like that really annoys me. To be fair, we&#39;re so used to comparing things to the sun and it&#39;s movements that writing about the Years of the Trees requires looking everything over three times with only that in mind. At least. As for the &quot;O, my well-formed cousin...&quot; - good thing you scrapped that. The Maedhros/Fingon shippers would&#39;ve gone crazy...</p>

Since I don&#39;t <i>know</i> any songs from Valinor, I decided Fingon was either writing it on the spot or using a currently popular song - and at that time and in that place, &#39;Above all shadows rides the Sun&#39; isn&#39;t just a comparison, it&#39;s a direct and tangible reference to the only (visible) support the Valar have given the Noldor since the exile. To give a meaning-filled prose paraphrase of that entire verse:<br><br>Even though we have left the Undying Lands and sentenced to everlasting exile,<br>And even though we are not only in the shadowed lands, but under the very shadow of Morgoth&#39;s hand,<br>And even though we are far beyond the reach of our people&#39;s power,<br>And even though the mountains separate us from our home - and even greater mountains from our ancient home...<br><i>We are not alone</i>. The Light of the Trees now shines over the whole world,<br>And the stars which we are named for still burn - with the Sickle hanging high over our heads as a death sentence on Morgoth,<br><i>I will not give in</i> to Morgoth&#39;s shadow and threat<br>And I <i>will not</i> forget who I am - a son of the sons of the Firstborn, who awoke in Middle-earth under the light of the eternal stars.<br><br>... you know what? There is <i>no way</i> that symbolism is accidental. Not for the specific Morgoth situation, but... that&#39;s an <i>elven</i> song. The idiom is absolutely not Hobbitish, or even Mannish. And given the way it&#39;s expressed - a memory of Valinor, a hope against the Shadow, and praise of the Sun - I&#39;m going to say it was written in the first century after the First Dawn.<br><br>So no, according to the strict word of the (last rewriting of the) Silmarillion, it can&#39;t have been the song Fingon sang. But it still fits <i>really well</i>.<br><br>And if my theory&#39;s correct? That means the original version might possibly have looked something like this:<br><br><i>Anor dhosta or-dhuaithoth<br>Ah elenath hilar<br>Ъ-bкdithan &quot;i galad veth<br>&quot;Ah in elin &#39;wannar...&quot;</i><br><br>(Also known as &#39;the free translation that totally baffled Neshomeh since it throws some of the words into direct speech&#39;. The back-translation is, roughly:<br><br><i>The sun burns above the shadowhost<br>And all the stars shine<br>I will not say &#39;the last Light<br>&#39;And the stars are dying...&#39;</i><br><br>In Sindarin, obviously.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Finally got my brain to cough it up, stupid brain. That was a good thread. We should revive it. [/not noticeably subtle]<br><br><b>So, guys,</b> what&#39;s your favorite Tolkien song/poem? And, since we&#39;re talking about the movies, what&#39;s your favorite one PJ actually used? What about versions in other adaptations?<br><br>Mine is Sam&#39;s song from TTT, the one he sings while trying to find Frodo in the Tower of Cirith Ungol, which is sadly left out of the films. It is, however, included in the BBC radio adaptation by Brian Sibley &amp; co., which is a very good adaptation that is responsible for most of my ability to quote from the books, since I listened to it over and over (and over and over and over) as a kid. I especially remember the songs—I might forget words, but I rarely forget a tune. I also really like &quot;Upon the Hearth&quot; (both versions) as sung in the radio play. It&#39;s so cheerful, and I think of it darn near every time anyone is trying to mobilize people out the door. &quot;We must away, ere break of day...&quot;<br><br>My favorite that&#39;s included in the films... well, we&#39;ve covered the Lonely Mountain song and its awesomeness. From the LotR trilogy, I think my favorite moment is when Aragorn starts singing at his crowning. It&#39;s brief, but very moving. Pippin singing over the rout of Faramir and his men is also moving, but it&#39;s slightly ruined for me because they changed an important word, making it more depressing than it actually is.<br><br>Slightly tangential: did you guys know that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/HinterhofProductions?feature=watch">Christopher Lee sings</a>?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The Sindarin was... maybe a couple of hours work?<br><br>The Quenya, on the other hand, was basically a summer holiday project. Once I knew the grammar well enough (which took a few months, but <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/qcourse.htm">the Ardalambion Quenya course</a> is actually really good if you bother to do the questions), I basically went through If We Shadows one line at a time. I found that scribbling the key words... well, example time!<br><br><i>If we shadows have offended</i><br><br>The key words here are &#39;if&#39;, &#39;shadow&#39; and &#39;to offend&#39;. &#39;we&#39;, like most pronouns in Quenya, is a suffix, -lme [note: the umlauts over the e are non-essential: they&#39;re a reminder to English speakers that the e is pronounced), the plural &#39;shadowS&#39; is also a suffix (either -i or -r depending on the noun - in this case it&#39;s -i), and &#39;have ...ed&#39; is a tense, specifically the... past perfect, maybe? Which I can&#39;t remember how it works, since tenses are complicated. But at the time I had a notebook.<br><br>Checking the wordlist (also available on Ardalambion) gave &#39;Mai&#39; for &#39;if&#39;, &#39;lumbule&#39; for &#39;shadow&#39; (specifically &#39;heavy shadow&#39; - actually on reflection the best match for Puck&#39;s intent would probably be &#39;faire&#39;, meaning phantom), and &#39;feuya-&#39; for &#39;to feel disgust at&#39;.<br><br>&#39;Mai&#39; thus becomes the first word, Quenya sentence structure being similar to English. &#39;lumbul-i-lme&#39; becomes the second word through the rules of grammar (you suffix the plural before the pronoun), and &#39;efйuyiл&#39; is third, through, apparently, changing the -a to an -ie, lengthening the stem vowel (the &#39;fEu&#39;), and prefixing that same vowel to the whole word (for an analogous case, &#39;tulya-&#39; becomes &#39;utulie&#39; - in that case the -y- is dropped; I retained it because -euie is a stupid way to end a word). Thus we reach our final, slightly incorrect phrase: Mai lumbulilmл efйuyiл, &#39;If we large patches of darkness have been disgusted by you&#39;.<br><br>If I was a safe person to get talking about language, I wouldn&#39;t have <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Lingua/lijatac.htm">this section</a> on my website.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I would do the course, if I had a computer...<br> For some reason, I was never too good at learning languages in school, but can recite the &quot;One Ring to rule them all&quot; couplet in three languages (English, German and Black Speech) when blind drunk. I&#39;ve also learned a few words of Quenya just from the names of the members of the house of Finwe. Makes me feel a bit dumb when I look at your awesome work there and I&#39;m still at &quot;cane=commander, nare=fire&quot; etc.<hr> About umlauts - I&#39;m German and had to force myself not to pronounce Earendil the wrong way. As you have probably noticed, I leave the accents off completely, mostly for this reason. I was happy to find that I was mostly correct in my pronunciations, except for the bizarre (for me) &quot;ae=ai&quot; and so forth.<br> Also, I tend to pronounce some names differently depending on whether I&#39;m talking about the characters in English or German (which I feel more comfortable with, as I think the names sound better). Most affected are the characters that appear in LotR.</p>

            <p>Technically, names in Quenya and Sindarin (and Adunaic, if you run into any Black Numenoreans) should be pronounced the same everywhere, since they&#39;re actual Middle-earth words, not translations. Dwarvish, Mannish, Hobbitish and Rohirric names are translations, so are open to alterations.<br><br>What this means is that &#39;Gandalf&#39; is essentially an English word (actually adapted from a Norse name), and so can be said differently in another language. Mithrandir, by contrast, has specific pronunciation rules, as it&#39;s Sindarin.<br><br>Those rules don&#39;t always match English, either - Maedhros, for example, is &#39;Mai-th-ross&#39;, with a soft &#39;th&#39; as in &#39;thistle&#39;. An English speaker (or German, I suspect) would want to read it as &#39;Made-ross&#39;, or potentially &#39;My-dross&#39;.<br><br>The biggest difficulty has always been elven dipthongs. So ai, au, eu, iu, oi and ui are each a single vowel in Quenya - but all other pairs of vowels are distinct sounds? Oh, yes, I can definitely remember that... not.<br><br>(Man, I&#39;d forgotten how much fun this stuff is...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Yeah, the fact that the names are all translated is something one should remember when writing about someone suddenly appearing in Middle-Earth. Unfortunately, most people don&#39;t, especially Suethors. And then you also have to consider that &quot;Sindarin&quot; is, in fact, a Quenya word...<br> I&#39;d gotten the &quot;dh&quot; rule memorised, my brain just keeps insisting on stuff like &quot;Mд-thross&quot; or &quot;Mд-glin&quot; (with German д, of course), when it should be &quot;Mai-thross&quot; and &quot;Mai-glin&quot;. Also, there&#39;s dear old E-д-rendil... :-D<br> The thing is that the pronunciation&#39;s a lot easier for me when I&#39;m talking about LotR in German. I&#39;m not sure how to spell the differences phonetically, but <i>Elrond</i>, <i>Aragorn</i>, and <i>Gondor</i> are pretty much the most affected by whatever language I&#39;m speaking.</p>

            <p>I think we&#39;re pretty much in lock-step about the LotR trilogy. The first one had some unexpected changes, but overall was pretty awesome and had me looking forward to the next... which crushed my soul. I, too, am still angry about Faramir—though at one point I read a very convincing essay stating that it was actually <i>Frodo</i> they messed up the most, and that Faramir acted the way he did because Frodo lied to him and was acting all cagey about why he was there, which was not the case in the books.<br><br>Also, the episode on the steps of Cirith Ungol bears out that theory. The <i>real</i> Frodo would never have done that to poor Sam. I actually cried at that, not because it was sad, but because it was so, so very wrong. {= (<br><br>That happened in RotK if I&#39;m not horribly mistaken, so... while it&#39;s better than TTT because it has all the awesome stuff you mentioned (and I love the lighting of the beacons, too), I&#39;d still rank it below FotR. There was too much implausible!Legolas and comic relief!Gimli, among other things that made it feel not quite right.<br><br>All in all, the bad things about the films rankle so much because they got the atmosphere mostly right. The music is awesome, the scenery is awesome, the costumes are awesome, the casting is awesome... but they had to go and mess with the characters and the story. *headdesk*<br><br>I haven&#39;t seen the fan films. Will have to investigate. I second the jealousy about you having castle ruins to play in, though. {; P<br><br>As for <i>The Hobbit</i>, as you know, we diverge somewhat. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>Having learned my lesson since LotR, I went into it more inclined to judge it as a film for its own sake than as an adaptation, since people seem to have a better time that way. Unfortunately, &quot;as a film&quot; is where I have some big problems with it.<br><br>It <i>was</i> nice to see some of the familiar things again, and I did get a warm fuzzy feeling when they played the Shire theme, and the Fellowship theme. It wore off somewhat when they didn&#39;t <i>stop</i> using those themes, though. I can&#39;t recall any original music apart from the Lonely Mountain song, which is awesome, and I liked it every time they used it again (including the end credits), but I really wanted more original scoring, less variation on the themes we&#39;d heard before.<br><br>As for the rest, I thought the pacing was a mess, which prevented me from being able to enjoy the ride consistently. A lot of scenes dragged on too long and got boring, even some of the chase scenes. The one getting into Rivendell comes to mind—it felt too much like the one in Rohan for me, so it wasn&#39;t fresh or interesting, plus the problem with orcs/goblins/whatever running around in daylight, and Radagast on a bunny-sled. (I&#39;m just glad no one fell into the river for a silly dream sequence this time.) Also the ones getting out of and away from the Misty Mountains. The chase under the mountains felt like one of those amusement park rides where you&#39;re in a theater and the seats are supposed to move to simulate an actual ride, and you get sprayed with water and stuff, only without all that, so it wasn&#39;t actually thrilling. Then, I felt like I was waiting <i>forever</i> for the Eagles to show up, and I know that&#39;s metagaming, but still, how long did they spend up those trees, while their leader was getting beaten up?<br><br>I also felt like they couldn&#39;t make up their mind whether the movie was supposed to be a comedy for kids, or a more-serious telling of the story that would fit nicely with the LotR trilogy. The quality, number, and choice of CG effects contributes to this. They also made it harder for me to suspend my disbelief and enjoy the story.<br><br>None of that is going to keep me from seeing the next ones, though. I&#39;m still a Tolkien fan, even if a very disappointed and not particularly hopeful one at this point. At the very least, I think seeing the movies in the theater gives them the best possible chance of inspiring awe and wonder and other good things, which I would love to get from them. I just don&#39;t know if that&#39;s going to happen.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;d managed to forget Radagast on the bunny sled. I liked it for the first couple of minutes because I was seeing all the shout-outs to Disney&#39;s version of The Once and Future King, and then it got old very, very fast when there was no longer anything to Radagast besides mildly earthy comic relief. <br><br>I know Saruman doesn&#39;t take him particularly seriously, but given that he, Gandalf, and Saruman are the only three wizards we ever see... I doubt Radagast is really so much of a one-trick pony.</p>

            <p>If I had known it was about making people think about painfully odd choices of PJ&#39;s, I would have been more careful all these years. ^_~ If that&#39;s the case, does making someone aware of something odd they hadn&#39;t thought about before, like the Gandalf/Galadriel thing, count as extra-losing?<br><br>Turning characters into cheap comic relief is one of the things that most irritates me, actually. First it was Merry and Pippin, then it was Gimli, then Treebeard to an extent, and Gollum... and now Radagast. I mean, people don&#39;t have to be completely serious all the time, but I appreciate subtlety. For instance, I chuckled at Radagast&#39;s &quot;These are Rhosgobel rabbits&quot; line, because it seems like something he would actually say (even if the bunny sled itself is pretty silly). He&#39;s a master of birds and beasts, he knows what his critters can and can&#39;t do, and it was kind of fun to see Gandalf gently put in his place about matters in which he does not specialize. It shows Radagast in his element and Gandalf out of his, which we don&#39;t get to see much, but it doesn&#39;t take anything away from Gandalf, since he was just showing concern for his friend.<br><br>Most of Gimli&#39;s &quot;jokes,&quot; by contrast, pretty much boil down to &quot;lol, dwarves are short and prideful,&quot; sort of like most of Radagast&#39;s boil down to &quot;lol, Radagast is a dirty hippie.&quot; Just... glah.<br><br>I follow the Pratchett school of humor: the laughs should come from the characters and the situation, not be forced on them from the outside.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think some people were definitely too harsh about the films - such as P@L&#39;s dissections, which among other things gave TTT a lower score for character because Book!Boromir got full marks, but Movie!Boromir got zero for... y&#39;know, being dead already... - but... yeah, FotR was definitely the best canon-wise. Although I still get teary-eyed at the (wildly uncanonical) beacon scene; good cinematography there.<br><br>But yeah. I&#39;d managed to forget Frodo sending Sam away (and Sam GOING)... I&#39;ve also recently seen a note that if Legolas could kill a Mumak with a single arrow, how did he send three into that Uruk-hai who blew up the Deeping Wall and not even slow it down...?<br><br>I have heard, actually, that there&#39;s a fan-edit which turns the three films into one single giant mostly-canonical one...

            <p>That&#39;s a good example of adaptation done right, IMO. It&#39;s an excellent use of the medium to show something that couldn&#39;t be done the same in text, and although it&#39;s a slight change, it doesn&#39;t alter the story and it adds a great sense of excitement and (brief) triumph.<br><br>Hm, I don&#39;t think I saw P@L&#39;s stuff.

            <p>Well, I suppose now he&#39;s done his laundry...<br><br>Other than the things we complain about, the main difference between the books and the movies is that the books are rather more formal. Bear in mind that most of the characters we meet are nobility of various kinds, and even the ones who aren&#39;t - Frodo and Sam, Haldir, and... um... okay, that actually might be it except the Orcs - are well-bred (the beginning of The Hobbit makes it very clear the Bagginses are a very respectable family). The main exception is Sam (oh, and Gollum - though his grandmother was, according to Gandalf, &#39;a sort of local wise woman&#39;, so maybe even him), and of course the Orcs, so Sam tends to be a bit more casual than the other Hobbits, and the Orcs can be quite vulgar.<br><br>Throw in the fact that Tolkien was a) a linguist and b) born in the Victorian era, and you get a style of writing and speech that isn&#39;t used much today, even in High Fantasy. If you&#39;ve read the Prydain Chronicles, it&#39;s the same sort of slightly-out-of-date feel (actually significantly more so, but I can&#39;t think of any other examples you might have run across). A lot of that&#39;s been... not modernised, but casualised in the movies.<br><br><b>Hey,</b> anyone up for trying to name other non-&#39;nobility&#39; characters in Lord of the Rings?

            <p>I guess if we&#39;re counting by individual book, they somewhat count, but overall, they&#39;re not important except for Butterbur, Ferny, and Harry at the gates. Now that I think of it, outside of Frodo&#39;s extended family and later Sam&#39;s extended family (does &quot;becoming important in the Shire and founding an important family&quot; count?) there aren&#39;t many Hobbits that can be said to be characters either. They&#39;re usually referred to as massive family groups, including Hornblowers and Proudfoots (Proudfeet!) and it&#39;s only some of the Tooks, some of the Brandybucks, and the Sackville-Bagginses that get more than a passing mention in a paragraph.<br><br>Lobelia Sackville-Baggins counts as a character for sure, though.

            <p>I&#39;ll give you Merry and Pippin once the Shire is officially recognized by Gondor. I don&#39;t think you can have nobility where there isn&#39;t a concept of it, though, and I don&#39;t think even the Tooks and Brandybucks thought of themselves that way in all that time without a king so much as knowing they existed.<br><br>Also, there&#39;s Fredegar &quot;Fatty&quot; Bolger, who was another of Frodo&#39;s friends.

            <p>I&#39;m rather excited for the next two Hobbit movies. The fact that the book was made into three movies seems to be a positive thing to me, since it means there&#39;s going to be enough time for everything.<br><br>The original trilogy was a bit of a disappointment in terms of loyalty to the original story, yes, but I can understand why they made things the way they were. Making a movie, even a three-hour-long movie, requires some cutting of content. Working with a different medium, one visual in nature, also requires some changes to the story. With Hobbit Part 1, they had to give the movie some sort of conflict other than Smaug, since Smaug wouldn&#39;t be showing up until the next movie ((and I keep wanting to spell Smaug as &quot;Smaugh&quot; and I don&#39;t know why :C)). <br><br>I&#39;m trying to say that I think the movies are amazing on their own, and could stand alone if needed, and I am totally up for the 8-movie marathon. I&#39;ll bring the cookies.</p>

            <p>... I also have higher hopes for canonicity in The Hobbit due to the length. Surely with that much space to play with, even PJ can&#39;t cut <i>much</i> out... right?<br><br>(Weird point: other than Peter Jackson and George Lucas, are there any other filmmakers who are so universally praised and despised for their films - usually by the same people?)<br><br>I discovered not too long ago (when I was actually looking it up for this very reason) that you can stream movies over Skype... although of course that would violate the no-broadcasting thing in the DVDs.

            <p>I have little to say on the overall topic other than intertwined squeeing and grumbling. I will nitpick the films till the cows come home, no doubt about it, but the overall story and the sheer beauty of the films have endeared them to me deeply. (My family knows what I&#39;ll be wanting for my birthday/Christmas whenever the DVDs are released.)<br><br>Regarding The Hunt for Gollum and Born of Hope, I have seen both and was extremely impressed with the quality given they are low-budget, fan-made films. Born of Hope, especially, has almost the same kind of quality that we came to see on Peter Jackson&#39;s own films (minus the bits of CGI, which weren&#39;t quite so good). The costumes (and prosthetics, the orcs were awesome!), the acting, the combat scenes, the consideration given to the storyline... it was very, very moving. And it shows Elladan and Elrohir! *squee!* They were very good. (Yes, okay, the film wedged in a bit of unrequited love, but I have to admit I sort of liked that.)<br><br>The Hunt for Gollum wasn&#39;t quite as good, in my opinion, mostly because Aragorn was too well-groomed. it&#39;s an odd thing to pick up on, I know, but he just wasn&#39;t quite scruffy enough to be convincing.<br><br>I&#39;d still recommend them both to anyone who hasn&#39;t seen them.</p>

            <p>My immediate thought is lucky you, getting to play hide-and-seek in the ruins of a castle. Not that I didn&#39;t have a few cool places to play hide-and-seek as a kid, but the principle remains the same.<br><br>I&#39;ve also been trying to pretend that the oozing goblin king never existed, with varying degrees of success. But overall, there were only two points at which my family had to threaten to take me out of the theater during the Hobbit.<br><br>1)When I had a conniption fit about Orcs chasing Thorin and co. IN DAYLIGHT even before they got to Rivendell, when that undermines lines that they actually left IN the trilogy movies about west of Rivendell being mostly safe, and completely undermining the subtlety of the point about the Trolls, also rendering the escape from the goblins&#39; mountain annoyingly stupid (they got as far as they did <i>because</i> the goblins didn&#39;t want to go out in the sun...)<br><br>2)The Gandalf/Galadriel shipping. You know the stuff. In the middle of the council scene. Yeah, it was nice to see her again, nice to see the council operating (though, they could have been less blatantly obvious about Saruman being evil: someday somebody might actually want to watch this series in chronological order, and they threw away a good chance for people to actually <i>feel</i> shocked and betrayed which just wasn&#39;t there in the books,) but her and Gandalf? Leaving aside the fact that she&#39;s a married elf and that the Maiar just... don&#39;t? Honestly, the introduction of Thorin&#39;s pretty dwarf girl of the past should have been enough shipping for one movie. (Dear Peter Jackson: you already <i>have</i> an enormous female fanbase for Lord of the Rings, and adding in random romances is not the only way to make a primarily action movie appeal to women.)<br><br>I used to be somewhat afraid of the Rankin Bass one. (Don&#39;t blame me, the anatomy-fail is fairly obvious...)</p>

            <p>I ... did not read that as shipping, though, until now.

            <p>Hmmm... I&#39;ve got two possible candidates for when that line or something like it had happened in the books, and I think it&#39;s when they were standing on the steps of Orthanc, in which case I figure even the former head of the white council can resort to pettiness, given that a bunch of Ents just wrecked his fortress. <br><br>I can&#39;t block out the shipping anymore: my college friends have confiscated my anti-shipping goggles and they won&#39;t tell me where they hid them.</p>

            <p>Galadriel in the Hobbit bugged me.  I don&#39;t have a problem with Gandalf being unrequitedly infatuated, but I&#39;m sure she could have done something more awesome than walk in circles around them and make bedroom eyes at Gandalf.  She&#39;s legitimately fantastic, but they weren&#39;t in any hurry to show that.</p>

            <p>I keep getting flabbergasted by how long everyone on that council has known each other...<br><br>And that&#39;s why I think PJ missed a great opportunity to have Saruman be more subtle and them still trust him and respect him even if they disagree (which <i>has</i> to have happened before,) because it would be such amazing context for the look of <i>betrayal</i> on Gandalf&#39;s face when Saruman attacks him in Fellowship. <br><br>But I think PJ sees this as a continuation of the trilogy rather than an exploration of it&#39;s history, so that might explain both the missed opportunity and a lot about how he chose to present <i>The Hobbit</i> in the first place. Most of us probably started with <i>The Hobbit</i>: I know I did.</p>

            <p>I wonder how often Elrond feels like a little kid there? &quot;Well, here&#39;s two guys who&#39;ve known each other literally since before the world began... here&#39;s a (scary) lady who happens to be my mother-in-law and is older than the <i>sun</i>...&quot; I mean, she grew up with his <i>great-grandparents</i> (Turgon and... well, possibly not Elenwe, I think she was a Vanya).<br><br>But on the other hand, his Dad&#39;s a star who Galadriel likes enough to give little bits of to the Ringbearer in a bottle.<br><br>Oh, and I see Cirdan&#39;s on the White Council too... you know, the one who was there when <i>Galadriel&#39;s</i> grandfather crossed the Sea...<br><br>I do note (I&#39;d forgotten) that Saruman is Head of the Council <i>against the express wishes of Galadriel</i>, who wanted to put Gandalf in that position. Apparently Saruman never trusted Gandalf (or, we can assume, Galadriel) after that. That actually makes that scene work <i>better</i>, since we essentially have two factions at play - Saruman and his presumed supporter Elrond (neither of whom want to mess with the status quo - I forget Elrond&#39;s view on the Dol Guldur issue in the film, but he was pretty clearly against the dwarves mucking around with dragons), and the G-Team, who are engaging in sneaky discussions behind their backs.<br><br>hS</p>

I&#39;m just going to go on the theory that the whole &#39;war and terrible danger&#39; thing is her biggest turn-on. ;) It would certainly make sense of her history:<br><br>-Absolutely hated Feanor but wanted to go to Middle-earth anyway for kicks.<br>-Got involved in the Kinslaying at Alqualonde - as the only future Exile on the <i>Telerin</i> side.<br>-Went out to live with the generally-disliked Thingol.<br>-Wandered off into the wilderness to the east during the First Age.<br>-Accepted and kept a magic ring even though the Dark Lord wanted it and could potentially use it to keep track of her.<br>-Built herself (or stole for herself) a very obvious kingdom right between the often-hostile Dwarves (of Khazad-Dum, later to be replaced by always-hostile Orcs) and <i>the Dark Lord&#39;s fortress of Dol-Guldur</i>...<br><br>... yeah, even without the flirting I&#39;m seeing someone who <i>desperately</i> loves the dangerous life, and is probably <i>dying</i> of boredom in Lorien.

            <p>I should point out that I&#39;m really only a fan (albeit a huge one) of Maglor, Maedhros and, of course, Feanor himself (in that order). My feelings about the rest vary from &quot;meh&quot; to &quot;go do something unpleasant to yourself&quot;. Well, and there&#39;s a &quot;poor guy&quot; for whichever of the twins (opinions vary, I thought it was Amras) gets burnt in HoME-verse. Maybe Feanatic is the wrong description for me.<br> Also, I&#39;m perfectly capable of liking characters a lot without thinking everything they do is great. Heck, Sirius was my Potterverse favorite for the longest time, and I always thought trying to feed Snape to a werewolf was nasty of him.<br> Wait a moment... My favorite Silmfics concern the House of Feanor. My favorite Potterfics concern the House of Black. Something is terribly wrong with me o_O</p>

            <p>The artist is really good, the facial expressions are amazing, I JUST WANT TO HUG THEM ALL! Ahem. I loved some of her notes on the pictures. &quot;Feanorians don&#39;t get &#39;get well&#39; cards, they get &#39;get well&#39; swords.&quot; :-D (I still feel the urge to cut a few inches off Maglor&#39;s hair and make them into extensions for Feanor, though ^.^)</p>

            <p>Formerly an RP, this interlude has now become, well, an interlude. We shall now cease talking like a tour guide.<br><br>So, a short time back, I joined in the Blackout RP thread with a post about what was going on in the RC with the open door that the creeper had just run into. Recently, I got around to writing and posting part two, only to find that the RP thread had migrated to the next page, and therefore no one was likely to see it. As this seems to be becoming a full-blown fic, I decided to move it to its own thread, and post a lightly-edited version on Livejournal once it was complete.<br><br>With that said: Part 1 (&quot;Meanwhile, in that RC with the open door...&quot;) is <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=240239;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">here</a>. Part 2 (with the title of &quot;Cats, cats, cats!&quot;) follows. Thanks to everyone who&#39;s helped/given feedback so far!<br><br>--<br>[It got longer. I&#39;d say I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m not really.]<br><br>[Also, this installment contains some mild spoilers for <i>Supernatural</i>, mainly about Castiel and pieces of seasons 7 and 8. You have been warned.]<br><br>[And, with that said...]<br><br><i>The Road So Far</i><br><br>Dawn was watching <i>Supernatural</i> when a creeper entered her RC. After being made aware of its presence, she frantically opened a portal, which malfunctioned and brought Sam, Dean, Cas, and Meg through into PPC HQ. Sam recognized the creeper as, well, a creeper...<br><br>&quot;Oh no,&quot; Sam said, and three of the four canon characters backed up. Cas remained where he was, contemplating the creature. &quot;It&#39;s going to--&quot;<br><br><i>Now</i><br><br>DawnFire&#39;s fingers tapped frantically on her laptop&#39;s keys. She had just finished reading the replies to her first post, and had managed to come up with a desperate idea. Now she only had to put it into practice...<br><br><i>PPC HQ: RC 18</i><br><br>&quot;Cats,&quot; Castiel said thoughtfully, and the plotholes opened.<br><br><i>&quot;Good,&quot; DawnFire mumbled. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry for taking advantage of that canonical fact that you can have a conversation without seeming to leave, but it had to be done.&quot; She paused, considering this. &quot;Oh, great. I&#39;m the villain. Or at least a misguided protagonist. Wonderful.&quot;</i><br><br>Sam, Dean, Meg, and Dawn shifted backwards, startled by the sudden change in the RC&#39;s inhabitants. Castiel, of course, barely blinked, staring at the creeper.<br><br>&quot;RUMBLEROAR!&quot; snarled a huge lion with an old man riding on its back. Beside Rumbleroar, several animated lions stared at their suddenly changed surroundings, and quickly checked to make sure their cubs were unharmed. A twelve-year-old Hermione Granger screamed, and tried desperately to cover her currently cat-like face once she realized there were people around. Castiel stood still, smiling slightly, as more and more cats of all shapes, sizes, and breeds slipped through the plotholes. Nanny Ogg&#39;s Greebo hissed, spotted the mini-Balrogs, and hissed louder. Morwen&#39;s cats stared meaningfully at the creeper, which was frantically swiveling its head back and forth, trying to keep all the cats in view. Bagheera padded through another plothole, and was rather startled to find the jungle gone. The cat Castiel had once interrogated made its appearance, glaring at the angel. The Doctor, currently in another part of PPC HQ dealing with a Weeping Angel, would have been interested to know that several cat-nuns and the cat he had talked to in Craig&#39;s flat had just made their appearance in RC 18, a number of corridors and several dimensions away.<br><br>Speaking of RC 18, it was getting quite crowded. In fact, the only open space was swiftly becoming a direct path to the open door.<br><br>The creeper shivered. Its blocky head swiveled from side to side, from cat to cat. The smaller cats scared it; the cat-nuns and Hermione terrified it. The larger cats were enough to send it running for the hills of New Caledonia. And that was before Benvenuto and Vittoria scrambled through another plothole and hissed at it.<br><br>Faced with the boss cats of the Casas Montana and Petrocchi, who had chased the White Devil from Caprona, as well as all the other cats of assorted breeds and sizes, the creeper stopped hissing, turned, and ran. Most of the cats ran after it, yowling, hissing, spitting, snarling, and roaring. Rumbleroar&#39;s cry rose above the others, accompanied by Dumbledore yelling, &quot;After it! After it! We&#39;re gonna get that green thing and drown it in the Hogwarts swimming pool!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Alright,&quot; Dawn said, once the chaos had cleared enough for her to be heard. &quot;What was that thing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh, a creeper,&quot; Sam replied. &quot;It&#39;s...from Minecraft--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dude, you are <i>such</i> a nerd,&quot; Dean said, and sat down in Dawn&#39;s chair. &quot;Where are we, anyway?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No idea, but I&#39;d like to leave,&quot; Meg said. Sam and Dean exchanged looks. Then Sam thought of something, and frowned.<br><br>&quot;Cas, how&#39;d you know creepers are afraid of cats?&quot; He paused, considering his last sentence, and shook his head. &quot;Our lives are so weird. What&#39;s next, Daleks?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Several of our best agents are Daleks,&quot; Dawn said absentmindedly. &quot;Uh, Cas? Castiel? Are you, um, planning on moving any time soon?&quot;<br><br>&quot;W-what&#39;s going on?&quot; Hermione quavered. &quot;I--what is this place? How did I get here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Did you just say some of your best agents are Daleks?&quot; Sam asked. &quot;Wait, what type of agents are we talking about? There&#39;s no way this is a police force--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Cas?&quot; Dean got up and walked over to the angel. &quot;Hey, man, you alright?&quot;<br><br>Castiel turned, and grinned broadly. &quot;Well, maybe. I think so. Did you see all those cats? I mean, not all of them were cats, but they could have been. I was thinking, actually, what makes a cat? I mean, was the creeper afraid of the tail, or the whiskers? Or was it the fur? I mean, I don&#39;t find fur very scary, but then again, I&#39;m an angel. Do you find fur scary, Dean?&quot; He stared at the human, head tilted to one side, blue eyes intent and that same, awful, un-Cas-like smile on his face.<br><br>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Meg said. &quot;Here we go again.&quot;<br><br>Dean stared. &quot;You have got to be kidding me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course,&quot; said the angel, &quot;if it&#39;s the fur they&#39;re afraid of, then a dog should scare them just as much as a cat. But I was specifically told cats. I wonder why some cats are bigger than others...&quot;<br><br>Sam groaned. &quot;Great. Just great. Cas, this isn&#39;t just a--a practical joke, or something, is it?&quot;<br><br><i>In a Room at the Board</i><br><br>DawnFire stared at her screen, nonplussed. &quot;What--hold on, why&#39;s he gone back to being mentally unstable? I thought that went away when he came back from Purgatory. Why&#39;s it happening again?&quot;<br><br>She reached out a hand to pat her first tribble, which purred. In its fireproofed corner, the mini-Balrog looked up questioningly.<br><br>&quot;And--and I didn&#39;t even mean to write that,&quot; DawnFire added, mostly to herself. &quot;He was going to turn around and apologize, he was just being quiet because he was concentrating on sending the cats home, or something. How&#39;d he even--?&quot; She stopped. &quot;Oh no. No, no, no...&quot;<br><br>She checked the screen, and found that several more lines had typed themselves while she was talking. &quot;No! You&#39;ve got to be kidding me. Since when do stories write themselves to this extent?&quot;<br><br>The tribble purred. DawnFire positioned her fingers on the keys of her laptop, and jerked them away as something stung them. Cautiously, she tried again, and was relieved when no shock followed; when she tried to lift one hand to move the tribble away from her tea, she discovered that her hands refused to move any farther off the keyboard than it took to reach the rest of the keys and the touchpad.<br><br>&quot;Aah!&quot; she squeaked, and tried frantically to free her fingers, with no success. As she watched, they began to type, guided by an unseen force. &quot;No! Nonononono! Help!&quot;<br><br>She tried to stop typing and failed. Attempting to reach her email, she found that her fingers refused to comply. The story just kept writing.<br><br><i>RC 18</i><br><br>Dawn frowned as she watched the chaos that had taken over her RC. &quot;DawnFire?&quot; she said. &quot;What&#39;s going on? And why can&#39;t I turn on the lights?&quot;<br><br>As if in answer, a portal flickered open and dropped a young woman with light brown hair into the abandoned chair. She shrieked in surprise, and then stared at her fingers.<br><br>&quot;What--&quot; The newcomer wiggled her fingers, and grinned. &quot;Yes! I&#39;m free!&quot;<br><br>Sam and Dean eyed her warily, ready for a fight. Meg glanced at Castiel, who was eyeing the newcomer over Dean&#39;s shoulder. Hermione backed away, wishing she had her wand with her. Dawn stared, and then walked cautiously closer.<br><br>&quot;DawnFire?&quot; she asked. &quot;Is that you?&quot;<br><br>DawnFire blinked. &quot;Wha--Dawn? Why am I--&quot; she caught sight of the canon characters and froze, gaping.<br><br>Dawn sighed. &quot;DawnFire, focus. What&#39;s going on? Why are you here? Actually, just what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br><br>DawnFire managed to drag her eyes back to the shadowy figure of the Assassin, and sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t really know. I mean, we&#39;ve had a blackout, at the Board, I mean, only now it&#39;s at the PPC--there&#39;s a great interlude going on, it&#39;s really hila--&quot; She stopped, and went pale, although no one could really tell in the dark. &quot;That&#39;s it. I&#39;m in PPC HQ, and Slorp is roaming the hallways.&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;Slorp&#39;?&quot; Sam asked, eyebrows raised. &quot;What&#39;s &#39;Slorp&#39;?&quot; He pronounced the word as though he wasn&#39;t quite sure it was what he was supposed to be saying.<br><br>&quot;Uhhh,&quot; said DawnFire, blinking several times in an attempt to keep her mind clear. &quot;Um. Slorp. Right. Meatloaf monster from the Cafeteria. The Doctor&#39;s dealing with it. Not sure if it&#39;s eaten an Angel yet or not, though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wait,&quot; Dean said. &quot;We&#39;re dealing with a <i>meatloaf monster</i> that runs around eating <i>angels</i>?&quot; He glanced at Sam, and then at Cas...who wasn&#39;t there. &quot;Cas? Cas!&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s alright, it eats a Weeping Angel, not an angel-angel,&quot; DawnFire said hurriedly. Sam stared at her.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re dealing with <i>Weeping Angels</i> now, too?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, the Doctor is--&quot; DawnFire began, and was interrupted by Dawn.<br><br>&quot;DawnFire, you&#39;re going to have to tell me everything about this interlude, and we&#39;ve got to find Cas. And get all the cats back where they belong. And Hermione. And Dumbledore.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ok, <i>what</i>?&quot; Sam said.<br><br>Meg&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;So basically, we have cats from all over the place running around here, as well as a meatloaf with a taste for angels, and my unicorn&#39;s run away. And who knows what other dangers there are in this place, whatever it even is.&quot; She smirked. &quot;What the hell. Let&#39;s save the day. Sounds like fun.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I still don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re here,&quot; Dawn said. She was unusually intent, most signs of insanity pushed to the side.<br><br>DawnFire sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t actually know. The plotholes aren&#39;t supposed to be stabilizing--maybe it&#39;s because Cas opened so many that worked, I think he might have stabilized the room instead of each individual plothole? As for why I&#39;m here, it&#39;s...not a good story. I was typing, and then I couldn&#39;t stop, and then the story started writing itself, and I&#39;d nearly managed to contact Karen when the plothole dumped me here.&quot; She tried to smile. &quot;So, are we saving the day, then?&quot;<br><br><i>To be continued!</i><br><br>--<br>[I couldn&#39;t quite decide which cat to bring in. Then, I decided to just bring in all of them. Virtual cookies to you if you know where all the cats are from. Also, Meg is extremely hard to write, at least in terms of facial expressions. I mean, I can see her move in my head, but getting that into words...pretty difficult.]<br><br>[Also, this is technically my first time writing for <i>Supernatural</i>, unless I&#39;ve forgotten something. So, if you spot any OOCness, feel free to let me know and I&#39;ll deal with it. Thanks!]<br><br>[Oh, and, uh, I think this is becoming an interlude in its own right. Once it&#39;s finished, I&#39;ll probably clean it up and post it on livejournal.]<br><br>~DawnFire </p>

            <p>Did you know...that this part is nearly twice the length of the last one? Which, in its turn, was nearly twice the length of the first one? If these keep doubling, we&#39;ll end up with a novella.<br><br>Not that that&#39;s a bad thing...<br><br>So, without further ado: Part 3!<br><br>Actually I&#39;m going to ado just a little bit more, in a disclaimer. I don&#39;t own any of these canon characters. I also don&#39;t own any of the canon species. Furthermore, I don&#39;t even own the PPC! (Much less the various canons and fanfics referenced here). But, lovely people that you are, you probably knew this already, so...I shall stop adoing now and let you read on. Enjoy!<br><br>--<br><br><b>Part 3: “We need to find that meatloaf!”</b><br><br>Dawn scowled at her ragtag band of two Hunters, a supernatural creature, a teenaged witch, and a metafictional writer. She was not at all happy about DawnFire’s summary of the events taking place in HQ right now: the meatloaf was bad enough when it wasn’t a giant, people-eating monster. There was a reason she tended to avoid it (besides being vegetarian, that is). And, of course, she was stuck trying to lead a group that had Dean Winchester in it; and <i>of course</i> he insisted on leaving the safety (relative) of RC 18 and going to find the monster—because, apparently, an angel was an angel, and therefore Castiel was at risk. Dawn was a little more worried about how to send all the cats back home, and couldn’t even be bothered to add the moment to her list of moments that could be Destiel in nature.<br><br>And even worse, Hermione had regained her voice and her confidence, and was staying busy asking questions of DawnFire, who was doing her best to answer and not just stare at the Polyjuiced canon character. In between answers, however, she glanced around nervously. Dawn might have sympathized, or made some gesture of comfort or solidarity, if she had been less angry with the situation and less stressed by Dean’s demands.<br><br>Several corridors later, Sam had joined Hermione in questioning DawnFire, who was now fighting a losing battle with the staring, even in the dim light. After several minutes of conversation—during which Sam’s expression turned from politely curious to slightly uncomfortable and then shifted through the spectrum to confused—he lengthened his stride and caught up to Dean, frowning.<br><br>“Dean. Dean, this place…”<br><br>“Sam unless it’s a death trap, I don’t want to hear it. We’ve got to focus on finding Cas before the meatloaf does.”<br><br>“Dean, DawnFire says this is a story she was writing.”<br><br>This caught Dean’s attention. “What, you mean she’s a prophet? Dude, we don’t have time for this.”<br><br>“She’s not a prophet,” Dawn cut in. She glanced nervously around a corner, and decided it looked safe enough; the Laws of Narrative Comedy took note, and snickered. “She’s just a Boarder. It’s very meta, but she sort of created me and a bunch of other agents, only we’re sentient and she chronicles us more than she controls us, really, but—” she stopped in the middle of ‘it’s still the creepiest idea ever’, and blinked several times.<br><br>“Er,” said the chubby, blond man in the tartan suit. He had a pronounced English accent, and had just rounded a different corner. He was also apparently talking to himself. “Oh dear. It’s so dreadfully grey in here, isn’t it?” He spotted Dawn, and smiled. “Oh, hello! Are you also lost?”<br><br>Dawn stared. “Um,” she said. “Uh, these are not the droids you are looking for?”<br><br>“What?” Sam gave her an odd look, and smiled tentatively at the newcomer. “Hi. Uh, sorry about her, she can be a bit strange. I don’t <i>think</i> we’re lost…”<br><br>“Wonderful!” The blond man beamed at them. “Then perhaps you could direct me to the way out? I should really be getting back to my bookshop.”<br><br>“Wait, <i>bookshop</i>?” DawnFire stared more closely at the unidentified man, who looked back innocently. “You’re—wow, you’re actually Aziraphale, aren’t you? How did you get here? Was it another plothole?”<br><br>Aziraphale stared at her. “Plothole? My dear, are you feeling quite well?” He paused, frowning. “And how is it you know my name? I don’t believe we’ve met…”<br><br>“Smite you, in the face?” Dawn offered, then shook herself out of it. “Sorry. Seriously, Aziraphale? How many angels do we have to deal with?”<br><br>“Wait, he’s an angel?” Dean demanded. He pointed at the British bookseller. “Seriously? <i>Him</i>?”<br><br>“Oh, just because he’s not from your home canon,” Dawn snapped.<br><br>“Aziraphale is a fictional angel,” Hermione pointed out. “He’s from a book called <i>Good Omens</i>. Now, I understand that the Protectors of the Plot Continuum protect canons, but he shouldn’t be here, should he?”<br><br>“The Protectors of the Plot Continuum?” Aziraphale repeated. “Good heavens, is that where I am?”<br><br>Dawn stared at him. “Please tell me you don’t know who we are.”<br><br>“Well, no,” the angel admitted. “The name does sound rather familiar, though.” He was about to continue, when a man in a black suit and snakeskin books ran around a third corner and barrelled into him.<br><br>“Good Lord!” Aziraphale exclaimed. He untangled himself from the small heap that had accidentally been formed, and stared. “My dear, wherever have you been?”<br><br>“Meatloaf,” babbled the newcomer. He accepted Aziraphale’s hand, and let the angel pull him to his feet. “Giant. Growling. Couldn’t stop it.”<br><br>Aziraphale frowned. “Crowley, are you feeling quite all right?”<br><br>“Wait, <i>Crowley</i>?” Dean said. “That’s not Crowley.”<br><br>The newest addition to the group turned, presumably glaring at Dean through his sunglasses. “I’ve been A. J. Crowley for six thousand years, thank you very much.”<br><br>“Since when does Crowley have initials?” Sam muttered to Dean. “Or wear sunglasses?”<br><br>“Wait,” DawnFire said. To her credit, she barely stuttered; of course, it was possible she had simply gone into a mild case of shock. “Did you—you ran into the meatloaf monster?” She shuddered.<br><br>“Yeah.” Crowley straightened his suit jacket and tie, looking rather haunted. “It wouldn’t listen when I tried to talk to it, and blowing it up didn’t work either, so I ran. Look, I’m not suicidal,” he added defensively. “Who knows how long being discorporated would last here? Wherever here even is?”<br><br>“Not too long,” Dawn said, “Medical could probably patch you up. Say, you didn’t happen to notice any working lights, did you?”<br><br>Crowley just stared at her. “Is that a trick question?”<br><br>“Oh, do you normally have better lighting?” Aziraphale asked. He looked at Crowley, and sighed. “My dear, you’ve forgotten your hair.”<br><br>“What?”<br><br>Dean rolled his eyes. “Are you—you’re kidding me, right? Come on, we’ve got an angel to find.” He stalked past the <i>Good Omens</i> characters, scowling. Sam followed him with a somewhat awkward smile that tried to convey ‘What can I do? He’s my brother. And he’s right.’<br><br>“Are you mad?” Hermione exclaimed. She hurried after the departing Winchesters. “We can’t split up! There’s a monster on the loose!”<br><br>“Yeah, and it eats angels,” Dean retorted. “So if I can find it—”<br><br>“It doesn’t eat all sorts of angels, DawnFire said—”<br><br>Sam coughed. “Actually, DawnFire said it eats everything.”<br><br>“Ok, can we not talk about Prophet Girl right now?” Dean snapped. “We need to find that meatloaf!”<br><br>DawnFire sighed. Dawn rolled her eyes, and started walking, trailing the Boarder, two demons, and an angel. It was one of the oddest processions she’d ever been part of.<br><br>“If it helps,” DawnFire said quietly, mostly to herself, “the meatloaf’s name is Slorp.”<br><br>Judging by Crowley’s face, the only thing she had helped was his building case for proving her insanity. “It’s a meatloaf.”<br><br>“It’s a sentient meatloaf made out of Sues,” DawnFire corrected. She then considered this, and grimaced in disgust.<br><br>“I really do think you’re overreacting,” Aziraphale interjected. “I mean, it’s a bit silly, really, isn’t it? A giant meatloaf monster?”<br><br>Dawn grinned at him. “Welcome to the PPC.”<br><br>DawnFire laughed half-heartedly, glancing into the numerous shadows. Meg rolled her eyes, and quickened her pace to catch up with the Winchesters and Hermione.<br><br>“If it helps,” Dawn told her writer, “we know what places to avoid, and we’re a team of two Hunters, two demons, a witch, an angel, and an Assassin. I’d say we’re pretty well prepared.”<br><br>“Hermione’s twelve years old, Polyjuiced, and lacking a wand,” DawnFire retorted. “And the Winchesters think I’m a prophet. I get the feeling we’re going to need Cas to set them straight.” She shook her head. “Seriously, this day…well, it’s not going the way I planned.”<br><br>“At least you didn’t run into a <i>giant meatloaf</i>,” Crowley muttered, and was patted sympathetically on the back by Aziraphale.<br><br>“There, there,” the angel said soothingly. Crowley glared.<br><br>“You don’t believe me.”<br><br>“I’m sure it was very frightening,” the angel said.<br><br>“It <i>was</i>,” the demon replied.<br><br>“Even if it does sound rather silly,” Aziraphale continued.<br><br>“Exact—” Crowley stopped talking, and eyed the angel suspiciously. “It was enormous!”<br><br>“I’m sure it was,” Aziraphale replied calmly.<br><br>“And it stank!”<br><br>“I’m sure it did.”<br><br>“Angel, it <i>tried to eat me</i>!”<br><br>Aziraphale gave him a stern look. “My dear, don’t you think you might be exaggerating a little?”<br><br>“Ssso you don’t believe me?” Crowley demanded. “It wasss real, angel.”<br><br>DawnFire surreptitiously moved closer to Dawn; the hissing was a good deal more unnerving to hear than it was to read. Aziraphale just sighed. “Crowley, think about what you said. A giant meatloaf monster?”<br><br>“Named Slorp,” Dawn put in. DawnFire noted that she seemed almost to be enjoying herself now.<br><br>“Meatloafssss don’t have namessss!” Crowley shouted. DawnFire flinched, suddenly hoping that the demon’s sunglasses stayed where they were: she didn’t think she could take golden snake eyes in a human face on top of the hissing and the canon characters and the danger of Slorp roaming the halls. “They’re ssssupossssed to be food! Bad food, but ssstill food! Not giant monssterssssss!”<br><br>“Crowley, calm down,” Aziraphale said firmly. “You’re scaring the poor girl.”<br><br>“<i>I’m</i> ssscaring her?” Crowley spun around to glare at the angel, ignoring the looks he was getting from the faster-walking group. “Angel, she knowsss about the meatloaf! What if she’sss controlling it?”<br><br>“Now, I’m sure she’s not—” Aziraphale began, but was cut off by a new, also English-accented, voice.<br><br>“Not to be rude,” it said, “but why, exactly, are you shouting about meatloaf?”<br><br>The four beings turned around.<br><br>“Actually,” the man in the jumper continued, “I suppose a better question would by ‘why are you shouting about someone controlling a meatloaf’, but, well. Um.”<br><br>DawnFire stared, and clutched at Dawn’s arm. She tried to say something, but couldn’t quite find the words.<br><br>“If you had listened better, John,” said the man who had just followed man in the jumper around the corner, “you would know that he was shouting about a ‘giant meatloaf monster’ named ‘Slorp’.” He considered this. “That does sound rather silly, doesn’t it? Also, if you had paid more attention, you might have noticed the inconsistent scorch marks on the walls, most likely caused by a flamethrower. Wherever we are, time and space don’t seem to be nailed down.” He came to a halt next to John, and surveyed the quartet. “Now. Who are all of you, and why do you not care that your companions have disappeared?”<br><br>“Wha—buh—<i>Sherlock</i>,” DawnFire finally managed to squeak. Dawn sighed. “And, and—and John.”<br><br>“What?” Aziraphale eyed the newcomers with sudden interest. “From Conan Doyle’s books? Surely not.”<br><br>John glanced up at his friend. “You see, Sherlock? Even here, wherever here is, people read my blog.”<br><br>“Oh, shut up,” Sherlock retorted.<br><br>“Can we maybe go back to avoiding the meatloaf?” Crowley snapped. Sherlock frowned slightly at him.<br><br>“You’ve stopped hissing,” he observed.<br><br>“Wait, our companions have disappeared?” Dawn frantically looked at where the Winchesters, Hermione, and Meg had been, and started to swear…PPC-style. “Flaming Denethor! They could be anywhere!”<br><br>“Wouldn’t they just be around the corner?” John pointed out.<br><br>“Not in HQ!” Dawn set off at a fast walk. “This is awful! The SO’s going to kill me when we get the power back, isn’t he. How have we managed to lose so many canon characters?”<br><br>“It wasn’t really your fault,” DawnFire offered. Behind them, Aziraphale and Crowley sighed, and followed. Behind <i>them</i>, Sherlock Holmes and John Watson exchanged glances.<br><br>“Follow them?”<br><br>Sherlock shrugged. “We might as well.” The two started walking, and quickly caught up. “You,” the consulting detective said. “Crowley, was it?”<br><br>“What’s it to you?” the demon snapped.<br><br>“Your hair has slime in it. I thought you might want to know. Unless you decided it would make a good fashion change from your usual slimeless look?”<br><br>Crowley blessed, and miracled the slime away.<br><br>“Neat trick,” John commented. “Don’t suppose you could teach me how to do that? Might help with cleaning out the teapot after this one’s been at it.”<br><br>Crowley glared at the ex-soldier. “Are you a demon?”<br><br>John blinked. “Not that I’m aware of, no.”<br><br>“Then no, I can’t.”<br><br>John stared at him, decided he wasn’t joking, and coughed nervously. “Right. I’ll just…” He made some sort of gesture with his right hand, and edged away. Crowley stalked on, glaring into the shadows as though any of them might conceal carnivorous meatloaf.<br><br>Aziraphale smiled awkwardly at the <i>Sherlock</i> characters, thought better of making excuses for Crowley, and instead hurried to catch up with Dawn and DawnFire.<br><br>*<br><br>In another part of HQ, a Klingon was examining a note.<br><br>“‘Tonight will be a night of terror’,” he read, and frowned. “PPC HQ has no nights.”<br><br>“If I remember correctly, it’s a quote,” his partner said. She was a young brunette who stood almost a full foot shorter than the smooth-faced Klingon. She scanned the note again, and then started to look around.<br><br>“What are you looking for?”<br><br>The woman turned to give him a small smile. “It’s going to sound silly, but…a lamppost.”<br><br>“A lamppost?” The Klingon followed her, folding the note and placing it in a pocket as he went. “Reader, I have never seen a lamppost in HQ.”<br><br>“Well, one would be useful right around now,” the Reader replied. “What with the Blackout, and all, I mean. Kosar, distract me.”<br><br>The Klingon sighed. “I was once assigned to a mission in Narnia where killing the Sue was not enough to release the canon. Susan had been possessed by a secondary Sue-wraith, and I was forced to hit her head against the lamppost in order to force it out.”<br><br>“You…” The Reader turned and stared at him. “You slammed Susan’s head against the lamppost? Really?”<br><br>Kosar shrugged. “I was alone, and lacked a canon source. The lamppost was the closest thing.”<br><br>“But—” The Reader winced. “The lamppost. Really. Why wasn’t your partner with you?”<br><br>“I had no partner. This occurred some time before we met.”<br><br>“Yes, but you had a partner before that, didn’t you?”<br><br>Now it was Kosar’s turn to wince. “I did, yes, but this was after I left her.”<br><br>“Oh, right, the tribble problem.” The Reader turned a corner, trailing an annoyed Klingon.<br><br>“You mock me again. Those—<i>creatures</i>—are parasites, Reader. They—” He stopped.<br><br>“Well, what do you know,” the Reader said softly. “A pair of Assassins, hanging upside-down from a lamppost.”<br><br>“You were expecting to find this.”<br><br>“Well, it does fit with the quote,” the Reader replied. She examined the agents, head tilted to one side. “The question is, who has decided to imitate <i>Holy Musical B@man</i>? And why are they doing it in HQ?”<br><br><i>To be continued!</i><br><br>--<br><br>End notes: <i>Good Omens</i> was published in 1990, hence Hermione&#39;s knowledge of it. I also seem to be utterly insane; I&#39;m writing for the first time in the following fandoms: <i>Supernatural</i>, <i>Good Omens</i>, <i>Sherlock</i>, and I don&#39;t even know what else, but that&#39;s already a lot. Hope everyone&#39;s in character, let me know if something seems off...<br><br>And yes. This is now SuperWhoLockOmens+all the cats&#39; canons and the Potterverse. How crazy-awesome is that?<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>I adore that musical! In fact my Tumblr username&#39;s evil-sherlock-holmes because of it. Now there&#39;s that plotbunny wherein multiple incarnations of Holmes meet each other in HQ - BBC, ACD, HMB...<br><br>I&#39;m liking your portrayal of Crowley and Aziraphale (although I&#39;m wondering if Supernatural Crowley will still show up, heh), Sherlock and John, and Hermione! That&#39;s a lot of Neuralysing to do after this, I suspect.<br><br>Also, no one tell Eledhwen and Christianne that Sherlock and John are in HQ. They might scream unflattering things about being the only two people in HQ who have actively protected them and yet being absent when saner versions of them have appeared. Or at least Christianne will scream that. Eledhwen would just roll her eyes. </p>

            <p>I...can&#39;t believe I missed that. Both about your username and that Evil Sherlock Holmes was in HMB (more reasons to rewatch!) I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d bring the HMB versions in, seeing as they don&#39;t have much character development to go on, but...I think any other version of Sherlock would be offended :)<br><br>Oh, good! It&#39;s my first time writing them. Same for Sherlock and John. Hermione...not so much. I&#39;ve been in that fandom for rather a while now. As to SPN Crowley...well, I did kind of confirm that in an earlier post...wait, just realized what&#39;ll happen if he runs into Meg. Ah, well. Should be interesting. And as to neuralyzing, yes, there&#39;ll be a lot--especially if we include all the cats, Rumbleroar, and AVPM Dumbledore! Really, the only one who probably isn&#39;t going to be neuralyzed is J--nope, spoilers. You can probably guess, though.<br><br>Heh :) I mean, they could show up, if you like...gives me more people to juggle, but it could happen. Or you could write an outtake where that happens. Whatever you like. But yeah, they&#39;re there and...solving mysteries, I suppose. We&#39;ll see how that goes.<br><br>(You know, when I reread part 3 just before posting it, most of the best lines seemed to be coming from Aziraphale and Crowley. Well, and Dean, but Dean tends to have good lines. It amused me.)<br><br>Hm...I really need to watch MiB at some point. I hear it&#39;s good, and it would explain a lot more about how neuralyzing actually works... (most of what I know--actually, all of what I know--comes from the PPC).<br><br>Although...for bringing in Evil Sherlock Holmes (and possibly Evil Watson, too)...can&#39;t you just see John being so resigned at the fact that they&#39;re a couple? And it would be plausible to bring them in (see the whole &#39;Commissioner Gordon, the lampposts are disappearing!&#39; dialogue in my response to Outhra), as they could just fall through one of the plotholes that&#39;s bringing in lampposts...Hm.<br><br>We&#39;ll see what happens. All I know is some of what&#39;s happening next chapter. Which...is very vague, but all right.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Well, in terms of everyone&#39;s reactions to the implausible situation they&#39;ve ended up in, you&#39;ve got most of the new guys within boundaries. Not perfect, but as you said, it&#39;s your first time writing for them. I can&#39;t help you in regards to the Supernatural characters, though.<br><br>The real question is, why in the Fifty Spheres would someone bring Gotham City&#39;s lampposts into HQ? Are they on? I imagine that would be why the Assassins would be clustered around them, for the light. Of course, that raises the additional question of where they got the other power source from. Is that explained in the &quot;B@tman&quot; source? I don&#39;t watch a lot of musicals.</p>

            <p>...It&#39;s a problem. I may end up posting it on Google Docs (if I figure out how to work that) and just hijacking other interludes&#39; threads to announce the new parts. We&#39;ll see...<br><br>Glad to hear it. I am seriously diving into so many new fandoms this year...I should probably count them out at some point. Oh well! New things are good.<br><br>Welll...I mean, they&#39;re lampposts. They&#39;re not necessarily from Gotham (although now I have the mental image of &quot;Commissioner Gordon!&quot; &quot;What is it this time?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s the lampposts, Commissioner! They&#39;re--they&#39;ve--&quot; &quot;Well, speak up! I&#39;m busy.&quot; &quot;*deep breath* Commissioner, the lampposts are disappearing?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;The lampposts! They&#39;re--they&#39;re gone!&quot; &quot;Well, call Batman! He&#39;ll sort it out. Now go away, I have paperwork.&quot; ...and then Batman and Robin end up in HQ as well. Oh dear. Not sure that&#39;ll happen, though, it might be going a bit too far.) And, um, the Assassins are literally hanging upside-down from the lampposts. It&#39;s this thing from Holy Musical B@man (Starkid musical, wonderful--it&#39;s a sort of parody ((scratch that, it is a parody))) where at the beginning Batman leaves a note: &quot;Criminals of Gotham: fear me!&quot; and...that&#39;s not actually the quote I wanted. He later calls Commissioner Gordon, and the conversation goes something like this:<br><br>Gordon: &quot;You&#39;d better have some good news.&quot;<br>Batman: &quot;Tonight will be a night--of <i>terror</i>!&quot;<br>Gordon: &quot;What? That&#39;s terrible news!&quot;<br><br>And they start finding gangsters hanging upside-down from lampposts. At one point they find &#39;the entire Panangini mob outside hanging upside-down from a lamppost&#39;. It&#39;s...pretty hilarious, really, even though they never show the lampposts. So basically...someone is in HQ, imitating Holy Musical B@man, and using agents in place of gangsters.<br><br>But yes, I&#39;m sure the Assassins are glad of the light.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>To be honest, I&#39;m a bit too overwhelmed by all the badfic on the Circle of Lemmings to care all that much. Have you ever been on that site? It took me about 50 or more fanfics to find one goodfic, and I thought it was a badfic before I read it. And the only reason it&#39;s a goodfic is that it has great characterization, spelling, and grammar. It&#39;s a one-page paragraph with some unnecessary description that basically summarizes the character (Dean) as seen on the show, but other than that...it&#39;s a great, in character fic about Dean calling the Doctor (11, I think) and asking, begging, demanding that he save Sherlock, and the Doctor not being able to do anything because he knows that Sherlock lives. It&#39;s...well, it&#39;s great. It&#39;s just a wall of text with a bit of obvious writing.<br><br>And that&#39;s my goodfic. I also trawled through so much badfic you wouldn&#39;t believe. There--there was even a badfic *quiz*, which I may take on just to see how it would work. And do you know what I read? Tony&#39;s daughter getting honorably discharged from the army and not given a reason--but also knowing that her job was given to someone else--and swearing about it for rather a ridiculous amount of time. She then runs into Steve, at a <i>bar</i>, and then two months later they&#39;re close friends and living together, <i>and they still don&#39;t know each other&#39;s surnames</i>. And <i>then</i> she skips ahead to a future where they&#39;re dating and she&#39;s pregnant, and <i>then</i> we go back and Tony&#39;s OOC. And her dad. And <i>we knew all along because it says her surname is Stark in the summary</i>.<br><br>Yes. This is what I did last night. I had to use Holy Musical B@man as lemming repellent (thanks, whoever gave me that as a welcome gift...) And I haven&#39;t even told you about the blind girl who can become fire (ie, Human Torch), control lightning, and one more thing that I&#39;ve forgotten--oh yeah, she remembers everything that&#39;s ever happened to her (this is all due to her cold-hearted scientist parents trying to recreate Captain America <i>on their weeks-old kid</i> instead of, I don&#39;t know, <i>finding a volunteer</i>--I mean, seriously, why would you even want a baby with Cap&#39;s powers? It doesn&#39;t make any sense!)--and was adopted by Tony after he found her left outside a bar--who leaves a baby outside a bar? Seriously. And so, because she&#39;s blind, JARVIS has been given robotic arms--at least, I assume it&#39;s because she&#39;s blind--and apparently she knows the layout of <i>the entire Stark Tower</i> by heart, which, well, I guess Tony doesn&#39;t destroy anything, or if he does he rebuilds it exactly the way it was, and I think this is the one who also hates Pepper? Yeah, sounds about right. So she hates Pepper, and has a fight with Tony about how he&#39;d rather spend time with his girlfriend than with the Sue daughter he hasn&#39;t seen in two months (ok, ok, it&#39;s a little justified--apparently Pepper was with him on his two-month business trip--but it&#39;s still Pepper bashing, which I really don&#39;t like) and she goes to stay in a hotel. And then Thor finds her, and they&#39;ve apparently got some sort of pre-romance relationship? I don&#39;t even know. And--and Bruce calls Tony &#39;sir&#39;, I have no idea why. Oh, and up until the story begins, no one except for she and Tony knew that she wasn&#39;t really his daughter or that she was a clone of the Human Torch + lightning powers and super-memory. And then suddenly Bruce knows, and she tells Thor, and that&#39;s pretty much where I stopped reading. And then, of course, there&#39;s the Harry Potter badfics, and the Torchwood ones, and the Doctor Who ones, and--you see my point, right?<br><br>We&#39;re outnumbered. It&#39;s--it&#39;s kind of terrifying. I mean, it&#39;s a bit hard to find badfic on FFN now (well, depending on which fandom you&#39;re looking in--Twilight&#39;s pretty easy), but here...it&#39;s not even like shooting fish in a barrel. It&#39;s--it&#39;s like shooting dead sardines in a barrel. I just...I went through seven parts of HMB looking at it, and I barely scraped the surface. If this is what FFN was like when Jay and Acacia started...wow. No wonder they wrote the PPC. And believe me, I&#39;m very glad they did...<br><br>~DF</p>

But yeah, if Tawaki verifies that Fearn is not actually Omicron with a different name, definitely add him, and probably update Melpomene&#39;s page, too, since she&#39;s supposed to be Fearn&#39;s partner as of 2010.<br><br>The search feature is a pain in the neck, but you don&#39;t have to be an admin to use it effectively. (I&#39;m not one, by the way. PG =/= admin.) You just have to make sure your search term isn&#39;t too broad, because it doesn&#39;t seem to distinguish between upper and lower case, and I think it&#39;ll give you results with words that contain whatever you entered, too. Thus, &quot;DIA&quot; was useless to me, but &quot;cameo&quot; is unique enough that I was able to pull up results going all the way back to 2008.<br><br>Hope that helps!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Omicron&#39;s partner is Kamkenta Squee/Duval, one of Tawaki&#39;s numerous bit characters. Omicron has also been active for several years, which counteracts Tawaki&#39;s description of Fearn as &quot;rookie&quot;.<br>Omicron was never mentioned to be good at games until Lily Winterwood used him, which means this may be a coincidence. Plus, Fearn seems to be <i>bad</i> at games, which may be a difference in itself.<br><br>Still, I&#39;ll ask just to make sure, once Tawaki responds to my other e-mail so that I know the address he gave me works.<br><br>I&#39;ll keep that bit about the search terms in mind in the future.

            <p>Love the deleted scenes! I just have a request--could you write another one where the Doctor bumps into the Reader? I get the feeling that I volunteered her in a thread that&#39;s now on a different page, and that&#39;s why she hasn&#39;t shown up. Could you make a meeting happen? Even if he just bumps into a woman and a Klingon arguing loudly about battle tactics and strategies for finding a TARDIS in the maze of HQ? That could be fun...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Now Omicron is going to spend the rest of the Doctor&#39;s stay at the PPC hunting Clara down to demand a rematch. Exterminating her would be too easy.

Consequently, if she loses at Cluedo, she would not need to be exterminated, but might just be anyway for her insolence to dare defy the superior Cluedo prowess of the Dalek race.

            <p>There were very few things Luxury would not sleep with. As it turns out, a meatloaf monster was not one of those things.<br><br>She gave it her best smile (known to send other Agents running for the metaphorical hills, and even the actual hills on some occasions) and sidled a bit closer. &quot;Well hello there,&quot; she purred. Yes, purred. Back when she was with Sean, she had learned how to purr her words. It made it much more convincing when she wore her cat ears and strap-on...tail.<br><br>The meatloaf monster - Slorp - stopped its advance and turned the lump of meatloaf that could be loosely termed as a head towards Luxury. Despite a lack of facial features, Slorp managed to look perplexed. Perhaps it was the jutting ridge of meatloaf, approximately as high up the proto-head as a human&#39;s brow. Or it could have been the slight tilt of his head. Maybe the &quot;Graaaaaaaaaaawrghrah&quot; moan had a tinge of confusion. <br><br>All in all, Slorp was not sure what to make of the strange human approaching him. This was a first for Slorp. He tended to eat humans the moment they were in range. So what was it about this one that made him stop? What was it about her that made him hesitant? <br><br>&quot;So,&quot; Luxury smiled, &quot;I know a nice little RC down the way...&quot;</p>

He had neither organs nor bones, no skin or teeth or muscle. But even the most illogical of beings has a survival instinct, and his kicked in as Luxury took another step forward. <br><br>“Graaaahngah!” Slorp slithered backwards, leaving a greasy trial and a few bits of meatloaf as he went. Wait, he’d lost a partially-digested foot. A tendril of meatloaf darted forward and scooped it back into his mass. Luxury took note of the tendril and giggled. <br><br>“Ooh! You can make those?” Her eyes lit up. “How many can you make at one time? Can you make them bigger?”<br><br>That was it. Slorp knew he couldn’t eat this human – something told him that she would only turn it on him.

I don&#39;t think you outright stated that he wasn&#39;t in HQ...and his line at the end, that he&#39;d heard the Doctor had ended up in HQ, could be because he heard about the Doctor&#39;s visit while he was there himself...<br><br>Speaking of which, was that Jack post-Miracle Day, or what?<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>All I see it is that the last time the Doctor and Jack meet on DW is at that bar at the end of &quot;The End of Time&quot;, and that&#39;s the Tenth Doctor. AFAIK, Jack might&#39;ve returned to Cardiff during the Eleventh Doctor era for some reason, or perhaps the PPC has used the rift in Cardiff to stick him back into the Whoniverse if he showed up in HQ. The TARDIS could&#39;ve detected such a movement and sought it out, thereby making the Doctor meet Jack.</p>

            <p>there is purportedly a door to HQ in Wales on World One, but a copy of that door could conceivably exist in the Whoniverse as well. Seems like their sort of thing.</p>

            <p>Aw, not even Slorp supports the Luxury/Slorp crack pairing. Still, it&#39;s funny to read it this way. Now, even the terror of the Blackout flees when encountering the blonde terror of HQ&#39;s hallways.</p>

            <p>Good job, Karen. You&#39;ve either impressed or disgusted the entire Board with those short few paragraphs. I was more the former than the latter, but I&#39;m not going to say I was either exclusively.<br><br>Seriously, though, was I the only one who instantly imagined a pulp romance novel cover when reading this? The one I was thinking of had Luxury pointing dramatically at nothing in particular, while Slorp swoons in the background. There&#39;d be a bit underneath it that would go something like &quot;And is one&#39;s heart not made of meat? Why must meat be in the way of passion?&quot;<br>I don&#39;t know enough about pulp romance covers to know whether that would even be what one would look like, but it&#39;s illogical, someone is swooning, and the blurb contains the word &quot;passion&quot;, so I&#39;m going to say it&#39;s at least plausible. Plus, it made me laugh, so it works.</p>

            <p>This would be easier to explain if you knew Bionicle, because Zaktan makes a really good example, but I&#39;ll try and map it out with as few specific canonical references as possible.<br><br>If a being with one mind is fragmented into dozens of smaller minds, they would all function as portions of that one intelligence, under a collective command of its single mind. It wouldn&#39;t be the fragmentation of a personality into &quot;I&#39;m the sarcastic one, I&#39;m the nice one, I&#39;m the shy one&quot; that mind-splitting does on most TV shows, because I&#39;m pretty sure that TV writers usually only do that to tell the duplicates apart until the full person re-merges at the end of the episode. Instead, it would be that each piece has a component of the intelligence of the original, a &quot;pearl of consciousness&quot; if you will. Technically, that&#39;s a Dune reference, but it&#39;s vague enough to make sense out of context.<br><br>The fragments would be capable of acting separately if necessary, but this would have a detrimental effect on both the part that split off and the part designated the &quot;whole&quot; unless there were so many fragments that either could function without some of those components indefinitely.<br><br>Additionally, if any of those fragments were to be destroyed or otherwise would be prevented permanently from rejoining the whole, the whole would permanently lose the mental processing power allotted to the destroyed fragments.<br>This wouldn&#39;t decrease memories or overall intelligence, unless the fragments were partitioned poorly or there were only a few of them, but there would still be a loss in overall mental acuity relative to the percentage of the mind separated from the rest.<br><br>TL;DR, a tribble student, if allowed to duplicate, would become a swarm of tribbles that shared the student&#39;s original consciousness, which would still think and act as the student would, with the added but potentially dangerous ability to separate portions of him/herself.<br><br>Oh, wow, that was a long post. I just like to talk about this sort of thing.<br><br>This has gotten me thinking: would a tribble-swarm student arrange his/her component tribbles into a humanoid form, for convenience&#39;s sake, or would tribbles be just too large to hold a form other than an amorphous mound?</p>

It&#39;s just not exactly the one that was being tossed around. It&#39;ll be fun, though. And maybe someone else will bring in CD-era Sherlock, or BBC!Sherlock. Or maybe I&#39;ll bring in BBC!Sherlock. We&#39;ll see :) But it&#39;s going to be chaotic. And I kind of want Crowley to show up now...and come face-to-face with Slorp...ok, no, that&#39;s going in.

            <p>Looks like I should reread Lily&#39;s interlude, because I&#39;d forgotten that detail, but it could be pretty awesome.

They can also heal themselves by using energy from a human&#39;s soul, but...it&#39;s a dangerous and painful process for the human. (For clarification: in SPN, angels don&#39;t have souls, humans do, monsters generally do, and most demons, if not all, were originally human and are actually twisted human souls, made that way through hundreds of years of torture in Hell. I know, very cheerful.)<br><br>...I kind of wish I knew a species that fed on emotional energy now. It would make for a interesting scene.

It&#39;s happening.<br><br>Part 3 currently has 3 1/2 pages in my notebook, and will soon be typed up and continued. And...there are angels in it :) Or at least, one angel. So far, anyway.

            <p>They sort of just disrupt a victim&#39;s happiness by being there, so they wouldn&#39;t get any extra energy from a fandom hyperconvergence than they would from, say, a child&#39;s birthday party. That&#39;s why the Patronus works. There&#39;s so much concentrated happiness in one place that it cancels out the Dementors&#39; auras of bleakness. Admittedly, I may have a few details wrong in saying that, but what I remember out of the books and the facts from a few Internet searches I went on just now corroborate it. Potter fans, feel free to tell me off for what I left out.<br><br>Actually, wouldn&#39;t a fandom hyperconvergence have a similar effect to a Patronus? There&#39;d be the same basic emotional blast, powered by the joy of millions of fans instead of the joy from a happy memory. It wouldn&#39;t shape itself into an animal, but it would do the same sort of thing in regards to emotion and energy.<br><br>Now I&#39;m wondering what Watson&#39;s Patronus would be. For some reason, I&#39;m seeing &quot;monitor lizard&quot;, but I have no idea why. Maybe because he monitors Sherlock... but a monitor lizard doesn&#39;t actually monitor anything. Bluh.

            <p>But the BBC fandom has extrapolated from the ACD Canon and as far as I&#39;m concerned the only thing they can&#39;t agree on is his appearance. Because he doesn&#39;t really have one.

            <p>That&#39;s basically what I was thinking of, too. Octavia was a minor bit character from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic who had no lines and only showed up in a few scenes, but for some reason, the fandom latched on to her, deciding as a group what her personality, individual tastes, and other character components would be. They usually often set her as a counterbalance to fandom favorite Vinyl Scratch, who didn&#39;t even have a name before the bronies gave her one.<br><br>Vinyl Scratch is a lot more nebulous in terms of character development, though. The only thing the bronies can agree on with her is that she&#39;s &quot;cool&quot; and works as a DJ. Of course, an individual brony&#39;s version of &quot;cool&quot; affects her characterization fic-to-fic, since she&#39;s never had any lines either. Of course, this makes her able to be adapted in far more directions than Octavia, who everyone agrees is mostly just a classical musician who goes on very few madcap adventures.<br>I remember one fic idea I had where Scratch was an undercover time traveler working to prevent one-world  extremists from collapsing reality. I lost track of the idea a while ago, though, and never actually got around to writing it beyond the first chapter or so. Now that I remember it, that sort of irritates me. I had a pretty good deconstruction of the brony fandom&#39;s commonly decided-upon Doctor Who expy set up to serve as a recurring enemy and everything.<br><br>Oh, wow. This started off with you talking about Series Three of BBC Sherlock and ended with me talking about my never-completed MLP fanfiction. I really spiraled off-topic there.</p>

            <p>This plays into the time that I&#39;m going to be setting my interlude/possible Permission piece.<br>Would the Security Weeds have entered into HQ by April 2nd, since the power was down for an extended period by then, or would they have gone in on the 3rd, when Captain Dandy was first seen by the Doctor?<br><br>Were the two Weeping Angels defeated by the Depatment of External Security defeated at roughly the same time (it couldn&#39;t be the exact same time, though, since Captain Dandy knew that the first Weeping Angel had already been defeated as he was attacking the second), or was the one that was defeated first found and dealt with several hours or even most of a day beforehand?<br><br>About how many hours were there between Slorp&#39;s first rampages and Slorp subsuming the Weeping Angel, and how many hours between the latter and the full restoration of HQ&#39;s power?<br><br>I&#39;d been seeing the power as being out for two days, and now that it&#39;s been revealed to be twice that, it&#39;s throwing a few of my time-points into question.</p>

            <p>Aren&#39;t the Security Weeds just part of HQ?

            <p>But I remember it being mentioned in a few places (and it was definitely mentioned in Crashing Down) that they rarely, if ever, entered HQ proper unless there was a problem. They usually just lurked around the outskirts. Doing what, I don&#39;t know. They probably have some huge ongoing mission that most of the PPC doesn&#39;t get involved in. But you&#39;re right, they probably would have started heading for the core of HQ when the shields first went down.<br><br>The Weeds do have some form of long-distance communication, but I don&#39;t remember what it was or if it was technological in nature at all.<br><br>This helped, though. It means that there was still at least a full day between the last Weeping Angel being defeated and the shields being put back up, so the Weeds would conceivably still be hanging around HQ during the time I&#39;d planned for two to show up. </p>

            <p>That&#39;s always been my policy, at least. It&#39;s not retconning, it&#39;s introduction of previously unknown information!<br><br>It wouldn&#39;t be retconning if, for example, a being of unknown species was said after a while to be a member of a known species(as long as he/she matched the criteria for being part of that species; to give a Star Trek example, passing a Klingon off as a Xindi would be futile and ridiculous).

            <p>There was something I&#39;d been planning on making a Permission piece, set just after the Blackout and using a few concepts I&#39;d come up with when the Blackout first started and a character Lilac Lielac gave me the go-ahead to adopt from her, but I&#39;d like it to be part of PPC canon, because I had been planning to write a sequel later and sequels are sort of pointless when the original is non-canon.<br><br>But, I don&#39;t know whether I have the ability to canonize my own Permission piece. From some brief scanning of a few other Permission pieces in the past, those were canonized when they served as an extension to the Agents&#39; backstories, and the story I was thinking of for mine would center around two agents I was only going to use sparingly after that point, and would involve me inventing a new Division for the DMFF to deal with Blackout cleanup. I think that&#39;s a little much. I mean, at least it&#39;s not a new Flower or anything, but inventing a new Division seems like something I should wait a while before doing.<br><br>Determining my Permission piece is harder than I thought it would be.<br><br>But after my Permission, I would love to write the Sherlock story. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a month from now, when it makes no sense out of context because everyone&#39;s already published their accounts of the Blackout; I would need to reread my Complete Edition of the Arthur Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes stories enough times to make certain that I get him <i>perfectly</i> in-character. After Lily Winterwood&#39;s incredibly in-character and fun-to-read Eleventh Doctor, I can do no less.</p>

            <p>If you want to write a certain Permission piece, I would say (keep in mind I have no say in Permission-giving) write it. It doesn&#39;t need to be canon or not.

            <p>That would be waaayyy too much. Especially for my first PPC story, and especially since the other Departments seem to have most of the bases covered anyway. It would be a Division of the DMFF, a sort of Security Sector for cleaning up all of the leftover Blackout refugees and any of the varied creatures that have dropped into HQ over the years.<br><br>I&#39;ll probably still write that, but since I&#39;ve been getting loads of excellent ideas for the Sherlock story, and I&#39;ve managed to work in a scene that involves the ypur stampede <i>and</i> makes my agents meet each other for the first time, I&#39;m probably going to go with the Sherlock story for my Permission piece. It&#39;ll be a while before I post it, though. I want to make sure I don&#39;t mess it up.<br><br>Plus, Doctor Watson rides a ypur during that scene I mentioned, so I&#39;m pretty psyched to write it.</p>

On the other hand, as I pointed out above (or possibly in a different post, not sure anymore) I think I need to reread your interlude, because I don&#39;t remember the details anymore and in-fic!DawnFire&#39;s supposed to have read it recently enough to remember.

            <p>Huh, so Agent Mmrrowl is real. Interesting. Also, does this mean I could recruit a Warriors cat to be a PPC agent? Because there&#39;s this one really, really strange fic with a non-canon cat who isn&#39;t exactly a Sue but...is kind of not a canon character, and I was wondering if she could be recruited, since all the members of Fireclan (pleasetellmeI&#39;vegottherightname) are named in a list at the beginning of the books and she&#39;s not on it.<br><br>Anyway...<br><br>Apologies (or not) to Agent Mmrrowl, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;d have taken kindly to Castiel summoning him from his RC/a mission if I&#39;d known about him. Maybe they could run into him in the hall, though? He could be providing a bit of crowd control for the many, many cats...<br><br>To be honest, it&#39;s confusing and fast-paced because I didn&#39;t realize it was going to get that long and then it got difficult to proofread because of the html, so I just made sure there wasn&#39;t anything too bad and posted it. On the other hand, the characters are also confused, so the next part should have some explanations. And when I post the full version on lj, I can go back and flesh it out a little...Which places were you confused in, though?<br><br>Hi, former-Agent Lou! Can I just call you &#39;Lou&#39;, since this is the second time we&#39;re speaking and &#39;former-Agent&#39; is rather annoying to type? Anyway, yeah, it gets pretty meta. I like meta. And while I have yet to watch Inception, I do know the general idea and can follow what you&#39;re talking about, so that&#39;s alright.<br><br>As to, um, triple nesting my avatars...well, yes, that happened. That happened when I realized that, essentially, I&#39;m writing DawnFire, who writes Dawn, who...doesn&#39;t actually write anyone, to my knowledge, although that would be interesting to explore. At any rate, in-fic!DawnFire has become a little separate from me, mostly because she literally lives (at least part-time) in a Room at the Board. I forget where that started...no, wait, it was probably around the point where the Mary-Sues in the basement got out and I joined the RP about it. That&#39;s when DawnFire gained a room. As for the tribble--welcome gift from Hermione. Very fun.<br><br>Yes, hS. Spur many moments. :)<br><br>But spur them gently, lest they turn on you and cause you suffering.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>In my defense, it&#39;s been at least two or three years since I stopped reading the books. And, well, Firestar, like you said. At least I still remember the format...<br><br>FireClan is a thing in the Warriors fandom? Elaborate, please?<br><br>Also, if you&#39;re at all curious--the fic I was talking about is a crossover with James Bond. A terrible crossover with James Bond. A crossover that makes no sense. Because apparently Q invents something, and that&#39;s ridiculously shocking, because apparently he never invents anything ever. And, well, that&#39;s only scraping the surface.<br><br>I&#39;m honestly just waiting for it to be updated, because it&#39;s a trainwreck, yes, but nowhere near as bad (and far more amusing) than that Star Trek songfic. (Ah, the songfic. Some day, it shall be slain in a PPC mission. And then all of you who weren&#39;t masochistic enough to check out the link will know the horror that is &quot;rare musical moments on the USS Enterprise&quot;. And Hermione [if she still joins me] and I will laugh at everyone who says they didn&#39;t realize how horrible it was, and then we will cry and consume huge amounts of Bleeproducts.)<br><br>(...I may be overthinking this. It&#39;s horrible, though. And there are 67 chapters so far, with a projected 100.)<br><br>Anyway! Thanks for the correction, I appreciate it :) And sorry about the mini-rant.<br><br>~DawnFire<br><br>PS: Actually, one more thing. You see my screenname? That came from Dawnfire, which was a name used by my friend in a game we were playing that was based on the Warriors series. I was Brightshadow (the name I eventually used on Deleterius) and she was Dawnfire. I think Dawnfire was in ShadowClan, actually...can&#39;t remember where Brightshadow was, though. Anyway, that&#39;s the history of the sn DawnFire: I was very much a Warriors fan when I was younger. Actually, I still think the books are good; I just haven&#39;t read them in a while, and so I&#39;ve forgotten details.<br>...I could have just said that as &#39;I&#39;m no longer active in the fandom&#39;, couldn&#39;t I.<br>And now, in the interest of actually heading towards bed, seeing as it&#39;s 2:20 am, I shall say good night. ~DF</p>

            <p>There are the same six or seven fan-Clan names that keep popping up over and over. SwampClan, FireClan, IceClan, CityClan, and more I don&#39;t remember and don&#39;t really want to look up.<br><br>No, James Bond&#39;s Q invents lots of things. Mostly he just modifies things so that they blow up or double as a homing device, but he invents things every once in a while. Star Trek&#39;s Q doesn&#39;t invent things, because why bother when you can just teleport in a completed version of any device without the middleman necessity and patenting steps? And maybe there&#39;s a third franchise with a character named Q, but I don&#39;t know what it would be if there is.<br><br>But a James Bond/Warriors crossover... yeah, it should die. If they turn James Bond into a cat, or turn Firestar or Blackstar into a human, it should die twice. Kill it, claim it&#39;s been let off, then kill it again while it&#39;s distracted and say that it was never actually let off, you lied to it about that, and it in fact makes you sick.<br>Wait, that doesn&#39;t make any sense.

            <p>Although, technically, he&#39;s referred to as 007 for most of the fic...which makes it worse when a mini named 00 pops up for most of a chapter.

Now, we both know that that&#39;s not true in Bond canon, but...this author apparently doesn&#39;t. And Star Trek&#39;s Q has just managed to remind me of the Trickster from SPN. Wonder...ful...wait...got to tell Karen that idea.<br><br>Ok, done.<br><br>XD Well, unless MistyFoot becomes a Sue, I can&#39;t technically  <i>kill</i> it...but the agents can certainly have a lot of fun with the exorcism.<br><br>Actually, that method sounds great for a Time Lady!Sue.

            <p>And a more specific warning: Tensions are bound to be running high - if you&#39;re any kind of racial minority, or have friends who are, <i>please be careful</i>, keep your eyes open. And if you see a situation that starts looking nasty - especially around mosques, etc, <i>please tell the authorities</i>. We have no idea who did this, but people are bound to start in with the xenophobia and hate, and the last time a bomb went off in a big city, things got really violent really fast for anyone who looked vaguely Arabic or stereotypically Muslim. So - please, please keep your eyes open for this kind of stuff popping up.<br><br>Please, guys, be careful out there.

            <p>Ever watched a show, and for all it&#39;s wonderful/terrible hilariousness, you still unironically adore it.

            <p>Okay, that&#39;s a lie. I ship basically everything, but here&#39;s a few:<br><br>Stark/Rodgers. Yeah, yeah. I know the Cap and Iron Man have been shipped from here to the moon by now, largely thanks to the movie, but still. When even the comics seem to ship them, to the point that Tony and Steve have been married several times in alternate universes, I just have to go with it.<br><br>Stark/Banner: Science Bros. This one is <i>entirely</i> thanks to the movie. Nothing romantic or sexual here, pure pale quadrant.<br><br>Victor Mancha/Chase Stein: Another Brotp. The son of Ultron, and the jock son of a pair of evil scientists, from the Runaways comic. They&#39;re both awesome, and they&#39;re awesome together.<br><br>Joker<br>(Also, Homestuck ships.

I was really disappointed these didn&#39;t happen... Also, I like Bellatrix/Voldemort for some odd reason.<br> Angel Sanctuary: Rosiel/Katan. Definitely. Also Uriel/Doll and Layla/Nidvhegg (whatever his actual name is... oh, and that&#39;s how he&#39;s spelled in my edition). Kurai/Michael also works for me.<br> The Silmarillion: Maedhros/Fingon *ducks* Seriously, they&#39;re cute together!

            <p>... because that&#39;s not what they want to do with the story?<br><br>Seriously, saying that two male leads who share a house &quot;just have to!&quot; get together is exactly as wrong as saying it about a male and female character.<br><br>Now, the key difference is that it&#39;s incredibly <i>common</i> for the latter to happen (as evinced by the fact that I... can&#39;t actually think of an example where it doesn&#39;t?), while the former is pretty rare and usually a blatant political statement rather than just something that happens in the way of telling a good story. Given the way <i>Sherlock</i> has been so far about homosexuality (Kaitlyn keeps saying &#39;normalising&#39;, which I can only assume is a good thing), it doesn&#39;t <i>need</i> to make the blunt-instrument-political-statement move. Which means it can be reserved for &#39;if it serves the interests of the story&#39; - which it... kind of doesn&#39;t. It would reduce the potential of Molly&#39;s character, for one trivial example, and wouldn&#39;t <i>add</i> anything to the mystery-drama part.<br><br>Oh, And One More Thing (TM)...<br><br><i>...the contentious &quot;Moffat is queerbaiting everyone we need text, not subtext&quot;.</i><br><br>Gosh, Lily, Moffat?

            <p>Some people have the same issues with Dumbledore, that he was outed offscreen and such. There&#39;s very few gay couples that are actually couples on screen, whose... respective parties... don&#39;t fulfil some sort of stereotype. People just want to see the authors stating outright that yes, these two men happen to love each other instead of making it a running gag that&#39;s just played for laughs and such.<br><br>Because really, John and Sherlock do love each other - we&#39;d just like to see something where they actually acknowledge that they can&#39;t live without each other, and it doesn&#39;t have to be a sex scene or something. <br><br>Oh, I can see it serving the interests of the story if they ever adapt &quot;The Three Garridebs&quot;. That entire bit about Holmes&#39;s reaction to Watson getting hurt shows just how deeply he cares about Watson.

            <p>I actually don&#39;t care about the John and Sherlock Shipping as long as season three gets here, because it&#39;s taking it&#39;s sweet time!<br><br>That said, for me a lot of the seeing them as bros first is a holdover from the ACD originals. In the original stories, it&#39;s clearly stated that Holmes is asexual and while there might be plenty of &quot;romantic friendship&quot; type vibes, it&#39;s certainly nice to see at least one asexual character for whom asexuality isn&#39;t something that&#39;s supposedly part of what&#39;s &quot;wrong&quot; with them. (Big Bang Theory, I&#39;m looking at you. One does not need Aspergers or intimacy issues in order to be asexual. [Guys, I accept that Sheldon would be less funny if he had any clue about being human, but given that he&#39;s one of the few characters on TV for whom asexuality is even mentioned, it&#39;s kind of annoying that the show at times seems to assume that all &quot;normal&quot; people want to have sex. I also realize that there are plenty of things &quot;wrong&quot; with ACD Sherlock Holmes - the use of cocaine and a willingness to lie to Watson whenever it&#39;s convenient come to mind - but him being asexual was never portrayed as anything other than the reason he will always be a bachelor and the reason that his interest in Irene was intellectual.])<br><br>Oh wow. That&#39;s a long one. The Blind Banker was also hilarious, I need to go re-watch that now.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve always gotten the distinct feeling that Sherlock is basically asexual. If he has any interest in sex, it&#39;s related to human behaviors and not the act itself.<br><br>On the other hand, John clearly fancies women, and not just in the BBC Sherlock. (Which doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t also fancy dudes, but still. Fiancee/Girlfriend is a thing that actually happens for him.)<br><br>Still Sherlock/John are definitely one of my top ten Brotp&#39;s.</p>

            <p>Romantic or not, I do see them as a sort of soulmate pair (hence why soulmate!Sues drive me mad in BBC Sherlock fanfiction). There was that really good analogy where John&#39;s a rock and Sherlock&#39;s a balloon: without John, Sherlock drifts higher (rather literally, with drugs and stuff) until he&#39;s lost contact with the world with his aloofness. Without Sherlock, John sinks farther and farther (his trauma from Afghanistan has led to an eating disorder, which Sherlock fixed in the dinner scene in PINK). But together, they balance each other perfectly.<br><br>That can be taken both romantically or not, and I can see it happening romantically (and frankly I feel like it&#39;d do modern TV some good to actually have more than just Kurt and Blaine for fictional gay couple role models).</p>

            <p>... Wait, Jesse and James aren&#39;t together? (Honestly, I don&#39;t see why the show should object to it, they&#39;re both adults so there isn&#39;t even an age problem like there is shipping <i>anyone else</i> in that show.)<br><br>I figured that Susan/Caspian is a one-way, rather short-lived crush on Susan&#39;s side. Since Susan is a practical girl and knew that she had to go home (and she&#39;d been grown up once already,) nothing ever came of it.<br><br>I don&#39;t actually mind Daine/Numair because even if he did teach her some magic, I didn&#39;t ever really see her as ever <i>not</i> being his equal. (Which is why I have some problems with Aly/Nawat, because Nawat&#39;s only been human for a very short time and doesn&#39;t have a lot of emotional maturity to boot.) Oooh, I also thought Briar and Daja would end up together later, too, but obviously things changed a bit when they grew up. <br><br>I predicted Ron/Hermione by second year, based off of the similarities to Taran and Ellonwy from The Chronicles of Prydain. That said, I liked the ship better prior to year five, because there&#39;s bickering constantly about nothing and then there&#39;s actually trying to get back at people (A line which Hermione crossed with the birds, but there&#39;s an essay hiding somewhere about how warped magic in Potterverse appears to make your sense of right and wrong,) but I hated <i>everyone&#39;s</i> major decisions in year five.<br><br>Watership down... well, kinda. It&#39;s been a while since I read that, but I think it comes off a bit more as Bigwig being an overprotective brother-figure.<br><br>Gah. I didn&#39;t like Minerva. She was not well written as a girl, as a genius, as an antagonist, as a character, or as a love interest. (Actually, I maintain that the series ended after Opal Deception. There isn&#39;t a single new character, in my opinion, who was worth it except as pure one-scene comic relief, after the end of OD.) Clearly, Colfer didn&#39;t know what to do with her when he wrote her, and though he might have been able to win me over a bit if he&#39;d managed to grow her up (and figure out how to write a female character that isn&#39;t Holly, Juliet, or Koboi,) but he didn&#39;t. She was basically a bad female imitation of book one Artemis and it showed.<br><br>That said, I kinda ship Artemis/Juliet, once they&#39;re grown up and all. (Poor Butler might have conniptions, though.) Also, if you try hard enough, you can ship Mulch with almost anyone... (Yeah, sorry to break your brain there.)<br><br>You appear to have read many of the same books as me! Have you read The Bartimeus Trilogy?</p>

That was, I think, the point of her was to help show how Artemis has grown, we see him see how he was at first, and he does not like it. We also see her grow a little bit the same way as he did by the end of the first couple books. ^_^ She could have been developed as a love interest, or even just a friend, I was a little disappointed she didn&#39;t show back up.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I get that she was supposed to illustrate Artemis&#39; growth (and that her little brother and how she treats him was supposed to be foreshadowing,) but due to the age and experience difference, I felt like she didn&#39;t make a very good foil for him. And aside from emphasizing that she was just like Artemis, and then having to be the rescued damsel, she got absolutely zero characterization. If Colfer had come back to her and actually worked with her, I&#39;d probably have come around, but the fact that he didn&#39;t shows that she was never seriously developed as a character, just as an obstacle.</p>

            <p>But who is Hyzenthlay?

(To be fair, a lot of that is probably held over from the Chronicles of Prydain - I think he loved that dynamic too much to let go of it, except during the Vesper Holly adventures, but Vesper was a bit busy, what with her adventures and her languages and her archnemisis and being the only Philadelphian of Brinnie&#39;s acquaintance to own a volcano.)<br><br>Artemis and Juliet would make a great pair of super spies. :)<br></p>

            <p>But before I start listing mine, Troi/Worf? To me, it always fell under the category of, as you put, canon ships that completely bewildered me. (It is canon to me, because they get together in a couple episodes of seventh season) But it does make sense - I&#39;ve never much liked Riker/Troi, and at least Worf and Troi would raise Alexander together, and I really can&#39;t argue with that.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure I support it, but...Data/Geordi. They have the this friendship that makes you go <i>awwww</i>, and the inherent shippiness of cosplaying as Holmes and Watson cannot be denied. For me, this emphasized because I love BBC <i>Sherlock</i>&#39;s John/Sherlock.<br><br>My absolute <i>favorite</i> non canon pairing, though, is Janeway/Chakotay, from Voyager. The balance of their personalities (the reckless captain, the cool-headed first officer) and the clear logic of the command team being the mother and father of their crew makes this pairing completely awesome. Not to mention the chemistry whenever they disagree over a big command decision, that comes simply from the fact that normally they are on each other&#39;s side, and it hurts to go against that. They dropped hints, and Kate Mulgrew even confirmed that she supports it, and then...<br><br>We get into the canon pairing I find most baffling: Chakotay/Seven. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it makes logical sense -  the icy ex-Borg and the compassionate human - but with absolutely no buildup? Just slapped together at the end, after seasons upon seasons of Janeway/Chakotay chemistry? What were the scriptwriters thinking?<br><br>...I&#39;ll stop before I start ranting. Most the time, I support canon pairings, so when I do depart from canon, it&#39;s because I really like it.</p>

            <p>There are actually a few canon ships that I just find just plain annoying, and I really would have replaced them with something else. I can&#39;t say which one is MORE annoying. <br><br>Harry Potter. People know I&#39;m a huge Potter-nut. Ok, more than a Potter nut. Literally, I keep the elder wand in my purse (In my defense, it&#39;s a pen) But anyways....<br><br>A bit of bickering can mean attraction, I suppose, but in my opinion Ron/Hermione has NO sparky chemistry. Best friends (practically family), tutor-tutored, debate partners, yes to all of these. But LOVERS?? This pairing annoys the heck out of me. I don&#39;t see it. I prefer Hermione/HARRY. I mean, come on, those two had WAY more chemistry. Way more spark, and they were a bit more similar in personality. Plus, in a relationship Hermione would always be the smarter one. Ron tends to cut down when that happens, although being in the Golden Trio seems to have calmed down that tendency a bit. I don&#39;t know who to pair him with, but ANYONE but Hermione. And Ginny/Harry stories can be cute, but I still think they were better off as good friends. They were still better than Ron/Hermione, though. <br><br>I also like Neville/Luna, or even Neville/Ginny can be cute (though I like the first one better as an idea). <br><br>Finally, from the Power Rangers fandom (yes, I know). Actually, these people tend to ROYALLY screw up pairings (in my personal opinion). I love the show for some odd reason, have ever since I was a kid, but Tommy/Kat? Kim/SKULL!!??? Kim/Skull should NOT be happening in any universe. He&#39;s a complete bully to her towards the beginning. I mean, he gets better towards the end, but COME FREAKING ON!! Friends, I can see. Someone she tells about her being a ranger, maybe. I can even see them keeping contact when she leaves for Pan Globals. But really? And Spike can&#39;t be Kimberly&#39;s kid. She would kick him in the nuts for being that idiotic about Power Rangers before Samurai even happened. <br><br>And while I&#39;m not as upset about Tommy/Kat, Tommy/Kim still had a lot more great chemistry going on. While it may have looked like puppy love, I don&#39;t think it was. They were saving the world everyday. They grew up. And some people do find love with their high school sweethearts. Kat is great by herself, but then she takes Tommy away from Kim, so everyone hates her. And the way they made Kim break up with Tommy was completely idiotic, too. The letter? Kim would have called, at least, and probably visited. She and Tommy would have talked for hours about it. They would have set things strait. Kim was no coward. She was the world&#39;s first pink ranger, for goodness sakes. And then they would be IN-CHARACTER. <br><br>Oh, there are more botched pairings. <br><br>There&#39;s of course, the famous Kira/Trent, Conner/Krista. WHY? Let me list the reasons: Conner and Kira just had more chemistry and Trent lied to Kira BIG time about his Dad being Mesogog. Kira&#39;s crush on Trent was so forced, and Conner and Krista weren&#39;t similar enough to make it work. If you&#39;re at least not going to get rid of the Kira/Trent (who can have their cute moments, I guess), then pair Conner up with ANYONE else. Because Krista&#39;s kind of too up in nature, and Conner, even as a stuck-up jock (and he did a lot of growing being a red ranger) deserved a whole lot more than that. And it was forced. <br><br>Trini/Jason wasn&#39;t ever confirmed, was it? It should have been, they were cute together. And Dustin/Kelly- everyone thinks it should have been Marah, but I thought Dustin and Kelly were super great together. Kelly&#39;s age was never said- I would have placed her to be somewhere in her early twenties, Dustin around eighteen or nineteen- if not in his college years, then very close to it. <br><br>Even though they only ever confirmed Ally/Jack in SPD, they didn&#39;t really botch much from that season. Almost any combo of the rangers- Syd/Sky, Z/Bridge, or even Sky/Bridge (since apparently they tried to make a season of gay Bridge)or Z/Boom would work, to be quite honest. And Z could have done very well single. I prefer Syd/Sky and Z/Bridge, but any of those could have worked. Kat/Cruger would have been so cute, though. Even though his wife was there. But Kat/Cruger had a better relationship. We saw more of that, though. <br><br>And they didn&#39;t botch anything in Jungle Fury, I don&#39;t think. And in my fave season, RPM, they didn&#39;t botch anything, either. So writing got better as it went on. But the first several you were staring at the screen like, &quot;You just did WHAT???&quot; <br><br>Sorry, it&#39;s not often I get to rant like this :)</p>

            <p>I take canon pairings very seriously, because who knows the characters best, the author, or the fans? When I support non canon pairings at the expense of canon ones, it&#39;s because the canon pairing wasn&#39;t as developed as the uncanon one.</p>

            <p>In all seriousness, I was never a shipper, and one of my friends was basically all of the stereotypes of shippers. For all of the Homestuck readers, she was basically acting out Nepeta&#39;s tendency to circle crude drawings of two characters and write &quot;YESSSS!&quot; or &quot;NOOO!&quot; next to them. This inspired me to ship the randomest, nuttiest character pairings I could find, which I originally started to do just to annoy her. To extend the Homestuck reference, these were Doc Scratch/Tavros levels of nutty.<br><br>Switching continua for the next bit: I still think she was onto something shipping Gorast/Teridax. Not as a crack-pairing, but as a &quot;this might actually work without knocking them both out of character&quot;. I mean, with the obvious &quot;They&#39;re energy beings piloting robot bodies! That doesn&#39;t even make sense!&quot; factor excluded, they went so well together, personality-wise. Plus, Gorast was the only one who really &quot;got&quot; The Plan, which was basically the defining factor of Teridax&#39;s life. It would have been a good bonding opportunity, you know? Scheming psychopaths have got to stick together and all that.</p>

            <p>Only problem is, everything I wanted to say about it has already been said. But I&#39;ll say it again. I love how you translated fanfiction concepts into the MLP-verse, the interaction of fanboy and pony is awesome, and wait, I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s commented on Printworthy&#39;s potential threat to the Marquis. Well, all I can say is I feel sorry for the Marquis. *giggles*<br><br>So, Printworthy&#39;s prior knowledge has gotten me thinking. A while back, I had a plot bunny about Rainbow Dash writing a Daring Do Suefic. So…say the PPC were sent to tackle that Suefic. It&#39;s a badfic of a continuum with a continuum. Does Daring Do have a Word World like MLP? If so, do agents from the main PPC handle it, or is there another PPC, where MLP is World One and they tackle badfic for continua created within the MLP-verse? The mind-boggling possibilities…<br></p>

            <p>One of the Glitterfics (as Glitter Do fics shall now be known as) that Printworthy read was Rainbow Dash&#39;s.

            <p>Every continuum capable of creating books and the like of its own would have, due to the similarities in almost all Word World sentient life forms, fanfiction for those books.

Well, more than it usually is.<br><br>Now that I think about it, in Adventure Time&#39;s &quot;Adventure Time with Fionna and Cake&quot; episode chain, there were clearly occurrences of Lust Object character-warping, as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM7Mj0joPrE">Author-wraith possession</a> at the end of the first episode in that chain. <i>It&#39;s starting.</i><br><br>Plus, the possession looks pretty nasty, too. Just look at what the wraith does to their eyes! Ugh. They get all kaleidoscopey or the pupils dilate to incredibly unhealthy levels. Also, it&#39;s of note that the Ice King is the author of that fanfiction. He <i>does not even exist in the universe created by that fanfiction</i> and so the characters fall in love with him for literally no reason. I&#39;d have pegged Ice King as being a man of many problems, but before that episode came out, I never would have seen him as a fanbrat.</p>

            <p>Since Trekverse continua overlap with those protected by the PPC (e.g. Sherlock Holmes), say two sets of agents got assigned to the same fic! Something has caused a breach in the walls of nesting meant to keep them apart, and after teaming up to kill the Sue or Stu, they attempt to find who broke the walls, maybe visiting the each other&#39;s HQ in the process! Would a Trekverse HQ still be run by sentient flowers? Would the technology work differently? And what sort of meta conspiracy would be uncovered? <br><br>The thing is, I even have a fic they can meet up in. I once wrote a <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8101688/1/Writing">fic</a> where Data writes fanfiction, and massive Sherlock Holmes fanboy that he is, it&#39;s a Suefic (or rather, Stu).<br><br>I really want to write this now.</p>

            <p>Thanks for pointing out the typos, I&#39;ll fix them in just a moment. I&#39;m really confused with the extra parentheses. I did not think I had many parentheses, if any at all. Perhaps it was a transition error from word to google docs? I&#39;ll check it out.<br><br>It seems that people really like Printworthy. Perhaps his being an author leads other writers to him, perhaps it&#39;s his little mannerisms and logic patters, perhaps it&#39;s because he created the term Glitter Do. Be that as it may, Printworthy is the board favorite. I&#39;ll try to think up other pony names for badfic elements that he can use in missions.</p>

            <p>Nice story. Both Marvin and Printworthy seemed pretty well-written, and you handled Printworthy&#39;s identity crisis somewhat well. I&#39;ll be looking forward to your missions.</p>

            <p>No problem.<br>Your portrayal of Printworthy&#39;s crisis is good in that there actually <i>was</i> a crisis (as opposed to Printworthy accepting it at once), and that you portrayed a believable thought process as Printworthy came to terms with reality.<br>My only qualm--and in hindsight, it is pretty minor, if it is legitimate at all--was that Printworthy came to accept the truth pretty quickly; I was not sure if someone who was just told &quot;You are a figment of someone&#39;s imagination&quot; would have come to accept it so quickly.<br><br>Long story short, I see no reason to change it; your portrayal or Printworthy was good.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I can see where the speed in which he comes to terms with his fictional origins would be a little unnerving to some people. To be fair though, he is not completely over the truth of his origins, and will have some identity issues later on. I am playing with Jumper, when he enters the PPC, bringing Printworthy&#39;s home fic with him, and Printworthy freaking out. Think about it, this is your literal life story, the document from which you were born. One little edit to his personality, the very core of his being may change. It will be funny at least, if I can just find out how to get it to work.<br><br>Man, you should have seen the first draft if you want some real fast acceptance. It went something along the lines of:<br><br>Printworthy: Dude, what is going on here?<br><br>Marvin: Well, see, you&#39;re kinda from a fanfic. You don&#39;t exist.<br><br>Printworthy: WTF!?!<br><br>Marvin: Search your feelings, you know it to be true!<br><br>Printworthy goes through some internal flashback thing, like in the final draft<br><br>Printworthy: Say, what was that thing you said about you guys and killing badfic?<br><br>Marvin: We kill da badfic. If you want to join us you can.<br><br>Printworthy: Sounds cool.<br><br>Marvin and Printworthy: ADVENTURE!<br><br>Ok, it was not that bad, but it was really, really sudden. That and Marvin has no idea of subtly in the first draft. Here he kinda fails at being subtle, but at least he tries.</p>

            <p>I definitely remember commenting on it before, but that would make it either a Permission piece (which I generally don&#39;t comment on) or something I beta&#39;d (which I don&#39;t often do).<br><br>Still, whatever the reason, I&#39;d say that scene (which I recall being a bit dubious about before) worked a <i>lot</i> better this time.

            <p>I still wonder, though... What happened to his partner in Bad Slash? Is he/she/it going to just hang around in RC 2683 until a DIA patrol comes around a day or so later and somebody says &quot;Uh, you do know that this RC is listed as unoccupied, right? You should probably be getting back to yours. I don&#39;t want to have to make it an official order, but I will if I have to.

            <p>I am not positive how it is going to work, but Marvin&#39;s partner that never was is going to find him and absolutely rip him a new one. I am tempted to make her a changeling, so she could feed while on missions and drain the sue-waith&#39;s power slowly. Printworthy would then come in to defend Marvin, verbaly shutting her down, and then...She puts on the shipping goggles. She thinks that Marvin and Printworthy are in love, kept apart because of social and physical barriers, and thinks that it is &quot;so cute /)<code>3</code>(\&quot; Justifiably, the agents are more then a little disturbed by her assumption. The RC is awkward for a few days after that. No they will not fall in love with eachother, she is just insane.<br><br>No no, Marvin and Printworthy&#39;s RC is 901\1Y. It&#39;s pony made with (mostly) numbers. P backwards looks like 9, 0 looks like o, and 1\1 resembles N. Y is self explanatory.</p>

            <p>Now I have this awesome mental image of a goggle-wearing changeling. She should definitely be the spurned partner, and maybe even get some missions of her own with her new partner that doesn&#39;t just up and abandon her when a better option drops into HQ. I even have a <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7436759/1/Mlp-fim-The-Shiping-Ship">good mission-fodder</a> for her! There are no other changelings in there, but there are enough Bad Slash pairings to keep any of their species sated for a long time.<br><br>Heh, Sue-waith. Sue-wraith plus extra wangst. The dreaded &quot;OH I AHEV AL THE LOV INERST BUT STILL AM TOO BEUTIFUL FOR REST OF MY LIFE HOW I GOES ON&quot; possession. That would be great to feed on for an emotion eater. It&#39;d be a little cloying, but I imagine that it would have a unique aura flavor. It&#39;d probably be an acquired taste, though. The secondary flavor of wangst would be pretty hard to power through the first time around.</p>

            <p>...I just don&#39;t know if I can handle her. I mean, with Marvin and Printworthy, then later Jumper and whomever his partner is, I just don&#39;t know if I can handle one more. While an emotion-eater would be fun to play with, beyond the one interlude, I just have a feeling like I&#39;m going to let her go to the wayside.<br><br>You know, if you want to take her, I would be more then happy to let you have her. I think her name will be Thorax, but it&#39;s up to...well me I guess, since she is still my character I&#39;m abandoning on the Board&#39;s doorstep. So Thorax it is. All I ask is for whomever takes her to give me partial rights over her, mostly for the interlude when I do write it, and possibly a mission if I find a bad slash fic that I just HAVE to use her for. Other then that, have at it.</p>

            <p>Hmm... it might be interesting running a Bad Slash RC on the side from my Floaters one.

            <p>I will be sure to read it though as soon as I can.<br><br>Alright, I&#39;ll wait to send her away until then. Congratulations Thorax, you managed to escape adoption for a while yet. <br><br>Jumper is a guy who can travel to different dimensions, preferably those with a form of canon to help assist in &#39;honing in&#39; to the world he wants to go to. Besides this ability, he has a quirky personality, though he can be very serious when he needs to. His idea of &#39;fun&#39; is usually annoying for more serious-minded people. Guess who he is going to get as a partner then.<br><br>I believe she will be from a completely different continuum then ponies. I&#39;m thinking Half Life, if only so that she has a natural distrust of beings who can travel across dimensions. The Resonance Cascade and the Combine Invasion have left her feeling that beings who travel the Space Between Spaces tend to not be her friend. Therefore, the Flowers decide to make the guy who travels on a regular basis her partner. Brilliant.</p>

I found (or made, or designated) sections of HQ in Minecraft and the Real World - can you do the same?<br><br>What this video needs is lots of people to make or find a chunk of HQ in their favourite game - or anywhere else - and record a short film running through it (or flying the camera through it as if you were running). Preferably, the video wouldn&#39;t show the player as a recognisable person (but something like Dwarf Fortress with its top-down smiley-faces is okay), but in some cases this might be unavoidable, so I leave it to your discretion. The best soundtrack would be just the sound of footsteps.<br><br>Yes, you can do the same universes I&#39;ve already done (Real World and Minecraft); you can also do different ones. Obviously builder games (The Sims, Lego...) are likely the easiest - but maybe there&#39;s a tangle of grey corridors in World of Warcraft? An office that clearly belongs to a Flower in Shoot&#39;n&#39;Bang IV (okay, I made that one up...)? If you can find it - film it! It doesn&#39;t have to be a long film.<br><br>(I&#39;m actually wondering if the very first level of the original Tomb Raider might be good...)<br><br>Please to be emailing videos to my email address above so I can tack them onto the end of this one.

            <p>Hey, guys!<br>It&#39;s been several months, and I think it&#39;s high time I tried for Permission and wrote an introduction for my first agent, Silky. Essentially, she gets sent to the PPC as punishment for the horribly urple prose* she writes (but she loves it there, so it becomes more of a learning experience than a true punishment). So, who has an agent that wants to put a bad writer in their place?</p>

            <p>Hi :)<br><br>I&#39;m sure Agent Dawn would be quite horrified to meet a writer of urple prose, especially if she shares part of Dawn&#39;s name (and even if she doesn&#39;t). She can also terrify Silky by being somewhat insane (ok, quite insane), constantly quoting things, and being an OFU coordinator. Alternatively, the agent bringing Silky in could run into Dawn in a corridor and tell her what&#39;s going on, and Dawn can cackle evilly (ish) and say something about how she deals with too much of that at SBEI, thanks all the same, so she won&#39;t be coming. Whatever you like.<br><br>~DF</p>

<li>Is there another half to that asterisk?<br><br>2. Don&#39;t writers normally get sent to an OFU as punishment for bad writing? Perhaps you plan on explaining why she ends up at the PPC instead in the story, but I guess this is just a heads-up that it needs explaining.

            <p>Hi, Neshomeh!<br><br>1. There was originally another half to that asterisk, which went into greater detail about the bad, bad writing in question, but I deleted it and then forgot to remove the asterisk.<br><br>2. She wasn&#39;t writing fanfiction, but rather her own terrible stories, so that was why she didn&#39;t get sent to an OFU. But this whole idea is still in the pre-writing stage, so maybe she could get there through a plot hole in her abysmal writing. I&#39;m definitely open to making some changes.</p>

            <p>Hi!<br><br>1. Okay, no problem.<br><br>2. Hmm... in that case, I think whether it makes sense or not depends entirely on who&#39;s responsible for the decision to ship her to HQ, and their reasoning. As Ellipsis Flood said, LOTS of agents arrive by plothole, so IMO it&#39;s always nice when someone tries to get away from that. I&#39;d say give it some thought, and if you can make it convincing, go for it. {= )<br><br>Some suggested considerations: Who is the person doing the sending? If a modern PPC agent, why do they decide this is important enough to potentially break protocol and interact with an author who isn&#39;t even messing with an established canon? (Is there actually protocol about agents contacting non-fanfic authors? I&#39;m not sure about that.) Is it someone they know from home, perhaps a friend or relative? If they&#39;re not an agent, why do they care enough to intervene in this somewhat extreme way, and how do they know about the PPC? Either way, where/who/what precisely do they think her education is going to come from? Are they going to be involved beyond booting her through the portal/door/whatever? If not, what makes them think the plan will work?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... that Constance Sims&#39; official backstory is that her father &#39;encouraged&#39; her to join the PPC (quite possibly with a letter on her 11th birthday - she says it&#39;s &#39;almost true&#39;). The currently-unofficial (because unwritten) part is that he&#39;s a published author who came into contact with the PPC that way (and apparently thinks we&#39;re a really good idea? (&quot;I don&#39;t know why I went into this line of work; I could have been a nurse. An astrophysicist. A writer. A singer. An extra in movies. But noooo...

<br><br>The double doors to the Department of Intelligence’s Hub burst open and let out a stream of tired Green team agents. They poured into the hallway, split up into groups, and made their way to their usual after-work hangouts.<br><br>Five agents managed to untangle themselves from the sea of black-clothed figures. Angus and Yakov ducked out of the crowd, followed by Nasir, Gaspard, and Luisa. They gathered in a circle a bit further down the hall.<br><br>“So,” said Angus, patting his bulging stomach. “I’m hungry. What do you all say to supper in New Cal? There’s this new Italian place--“<br><br>“Yew’re always hungry, Gus,” quipped Yakov. “Every time yew say that, yer credibility plummets. Is there a time where yer not thinkin’ of food?”<br><br>“Only when I’m sleeping,” replied Angus. “As I was saying, supper in New Caledonia at La Trattoria. Who’s in?”<br><br>“Sure, I could go for Italian,” said Luisa. “Anyone got a copy of the menu or something? I think it was featured in this week’s <i>Wire Tap</i>.”<br><br>Nasir pulled a folded-up newspaper clipping from a pocket. “Here it is. They’ve got a large pasta selection, some meat and seafood, and two or three pizzas. I think I’ll go for the fish of the day,” he said, passing the paper to Luisa.<br><br>Yakov and Angus drifted behind Luisa, looking over her shoulders at the menu and making comments on what looked good. Nasir looked at Gaspard, who hadn’t moved. “What’s up, Gaspard? Not in the mood for eating out?”<br><br>The junior agent waved his hands. “No, no. I’d love to go out, but there’s a meeting of the StarCraft club soon…”<br><br>There was a pregnant pause. Angus looked around and said: “Er, you know, maybe it would be a good idea to maybe just take a break from the club, bud. Go outside, do something else for a change.”<br><br>“With all due respect sir, it’s the club’s one-year anniversary. As the club founder, I would like to attend the event,” said Gaspard.<br><br>There was another uncomfortable silence. Nasir spoke up: “Oh for Heaven’s sake, you know how I stand on the matter but I’ll say it again--”<br><br>Luisa gave a Look at Nasir, who suddenly decided that a change in attitude was for the better. “No, forget it. Go on with what you have planned,” he said.<br><br>Gaspard rubbed the back of his neck. “Sorry. It’s just that this is very important to me, so... er... I don’t want to be too much of a burden on you all, so I think just be going now. See you tomorrow!”<br><br>As the junior agent walked away, his four colleagues turned to look at each other.<br><br>“Why?” asked Nasir. “Just... <i>why</i>? Doesn’t he know?”<br><br>“Dunno,” said Yakov, still looking at La Trattoria’s menu. “Whatever floats his boat I guess. Hey, there’s an extra-large four-cheese pizza on the menu! Anyone want to split it?”<br><br>- - -<br><br>Gaspard shuffled into the computer lab, carrying a rolled-up banner under one arm and a lunch box under the other. “Sorry I’m late,” he announced as he made his way to the elevated area at back of the room. He put down his lunch bag at the single computer desk on the stage. He unfurled the banner, a simple white rectangular thing with the words “DoI StarCraft Club, 1-year anniversary” painted on it in black. The Spy put the banner up on the wall using duct tape and turned to face the rest of the room.<br><br>“I don’t know whether I should make a speech or not,” he admitted, walking back and forth on the stage and gazing at the rows of computer monitors in front of him. “I mean, if it’s all right… ah, what the heck. Welcome all to the one-year anniversary of the DoI’s StarCraft club! I hope you’re enjoying yourselves.<br><br>“As the founding member of this club, it’s been a real pleasure watching overall performance improve over time. Everyone’s gotten out of wood league and into bronze, at least,” he laughed, but stopped when no one laughed back. It was okay. Nobody would mind. “Oh, forget it. What I meant to say was that there’s still a lot of room for improvement but we’ve got some upward momentum. Hang on to it!<br><br>“That being said, it’s no secret that the terran race has an overwhelming representation in this club. Maybe consider switching to zerg or protoss to spice it up. Personally, I’m thinking of switching races to ‘toss. I’ve always preferred unit micro over economy macro anyways. As for zerg… well, you’ve got to be able to macro like a pro and expand early. Oh yes, and remember to spread the Creep carpet. That’s the key to victory.”<br><br>Gaspard scanned the room. “I know we’re not a big club, but I’d like to be able to participate in the Major League Gaming tournament this winter. If we could maybe round up another two or three people and introduce some variety in the race representation, we’d stand a chance during the qualification round. I’ve seen firsthand what the DMS StarCraft team can do and, without wanting to sound conceited, I think we can easily take them on. I mean, there are only so many times you can lose to cheese tactics before you can’t be taken seriously.”<br><br>The junior agent continued to pace back and forth across the stage. “Two or three people. Have I been doing enough? I mean, I’ve been advertising the club ever since I’ve started it, so it can’t really be something on my end... D’you think it might just be a lack of interest overall?” More silence. Gaspard smiled. Yes, it was probably a lack of interest.<br><br>“Anyways, I wish you all good luck and have fun during this meet.”<br><br>And so Gaspard returned to his desk, started up the game, and celebrated the one-year existence of his club with three straight hours of competitive multiplayer on the HQ servers.<br><br>The entire affair might not have been so sad if he wasn’t the only member of the club.</p>

            <p>I think this is a really good piece for Gaspard. Up until now, at least in my eyes, he&#39;s basically been the &#39;slightly gormless one who speaks kind of funny&#39;. This puts a whole new perspective on that.<br><br>I realise you deliberately left it ambiguous, but I definitely read this as &#39;he knows, but he doesn&#39;t care&#39;.

            <p>I&#39;m serious. The fandom&#39;s full of it. It&#39;s all over the place: in the Holy Musical B@man category, and in the Starship category, on FFN, and probably in other places, too, though I haven&#39;t had the heart to check. Seriously, when <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8504724/1/Fall-for-the-unexpected">this</a> is only the first of many similar ones that I found with no effort whatsoever...it really needs it. I mean, who writes this idiocy? If you&#39;re going to write RPF, at least write a polite disclaimer mentioning that these aren&#39;t fictional characters and you don&#39;t mean any offense to them, pay attention to what you can glean about their personalities from interviews and so on, don&#39;t make them into cliches, and, for goodness&#39; sake, <i>check your spelling and grammar</i> and put some effort into your plot! Ugh.<br><br>So...we really don&#39;t take RPF on anymore? Also, could someone explain to me why we stopped? The wiki doesn&#39;t actually explain that, and I&#39;m curious. I know there was a thread that touched on this not so long ago, but I don&#39;t remember a full explanation being provided. If there was one, and I missed it, feel free to just link me to the thread instead of wasting time re-explaining it.<br><br>This sort of thing just makes me sick. Seriously? They don&#39;t read like the Starkids. They don&#39;t even read much like any of the characters they play, except possibly for some of the ones in Little White Lie. They read like cliches, in a very badly written fic. And it just keeps on happening. So, if I can take on at least one of these, I&#39;d feel a lot better.<br><br>Like I said: explanation, please?<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Actually I have three: I rediscovered the third recently.<br><br>The first is this: <a href="http://dazzlemethis.wordpress.com/"><a href="http://dazzlemethis.wordpress.com/">http://dazzlemethis.wordpress.com/</a></a> It&#39;s wonderful (absolutely wonderful!) and done by a girl named Kate. Who is wonderful. Can you tell I like this blog? She picks apart all four Twilight books (she&#39;s currently on Breaking Dawn) and awards points for stupidity, red flags, and more, and points out all of the terrible things in Twilight. Including bad science, abusive relationships, gender roles, and unrealistic characterization. Just...amazing, and completely redefined my view of Twilight. And I&#39;m still on New Moon.<br><br>The second is this guy: <a href="http://markreads.net/reviews/2010/11/complete-mark-reads-twilight-archive/"><a href="http://markreads.net/reviews/2010/11/complete-mark-reads-twilight-archive/">http://markreads.net/reviews/2010/11/complete-mark-reads-twilight-archive/</a></a> I believe Twilight was the first set of reviews he did, although now he&#39;s reviewed a ridiculously large number of books, movies, and TV shows (and, apparently, video games). He often likes what he&#39;s reviewing; but he definitely didn&#39;t like this one. (He tried My Immortal at one point, too. His reviews of that were hilarious, even though he gave up after...chapter 21, I think. Brave man.) He also did all four books, and finished them quite a while ago (ok, a year or two, something like that. Still.) Pretty good fun.<br><br>The third is this one: <a href="http://cleoland.pbworks.com/w/page/10373763/Twilight#Bookdiscussionentries"><a href="http://cleoland.pbworks.com/w/page/10373763/Twilight#Bookdiscussionentries">http://cleoland.pbworks.com/w/page/10373763/Twilight#Bookdiscussionentries</a></a> I don&#39;t actually remember much (I rediscovered her in my bookmarks recently) but what I&#39;ve reread is hysterical. She&#39;s definitely worth checking out. I think she may have also coined the term &#39;fursplosion&#39;? Anyway, there you go. Enjoy!<br><br>They are indeed! I...am tempted to inflict this on Agent Edgar, but...he might not...be...happy. Uh. Brenda and Charlie would have no fun at all. Maybe Dawn? Or Agen_<strong><em>t? Or someone else altogether?<br><br>...Sparklepire!Time Lady!Agent? Sparklepire!Klingon!Agent?<br><br>...you know what, I think I&#39;ll just see if I ever have the opportunity to make this happen, and then take it from there. The mental images will be less horrifying.<br><br>(Although I&#39;m kind of thinking Edgar and Agen</em></strong>_t, because Brenda and Charlie would kill each other. Dawn&#39;s another possibility, because then she could freak out everyone at SBEI...actually, that could be really fun...maybe it&#39;s the three of them! I like this idea! And Dawn thinks she can maybe hide it, but then she starts sparkling...)<br><br>Thanks for being my sounding board, Silky :) Enjoy the Twilight-snarking!<br><br>~DF</p>

There&#39;s one over at Library of the Damned right now, called Twitanic, where Jack (Dawson, right?) gets turned by Carlisle.

            <p>Or venom, or something like that, and that&#39;s what causes one to turn? If I&#39;m not mistaken, then logically, there could be an antivenin to cure Twipirism as long as it were administered soon enough, the earlier the better. Probably once the &quot;newborn&quot; stage is past, the change is permanent.<br><br>Of course, normal antivenins are produced by injecting animals with diluted venom and then extracting the antibodies they make from their blood, so I can only imagine getting Twipire antivenin wouldn&#39;t be an easy process. Agent Caleb or someone would have to provide the venom in the first place, and then you&#39;d need lab subjects. There are some horses who live in the courtyard, I guess they might work.

Also, in terms of it being permanent once they&#39;re back the newborn stage, that&#39;s certainly how it works on Supernatural (well, ok, it can be reversed until the new vampire drinks human blood.

            <p>XD<br><br>Hm. Well, technically we could both do it. Actually, we could co-write a mission where all our agents (or some, whatever) turn into sparklepires. And then they can go terrorize SBEI :)<br><br>(I mean, think about it. They&#39;re examples of published bad writing.)<br><br>(...and, of course, there&#39;s all the jokes...and the sparkling...and, well, everything, really.)<br><br>(I seriously just want D. to come in as a sparklepire, and no one really realizes until they open a window or go outside, and then suddenly she&#39;s sparkling and B. gets kind of freaked out. And then T. gets started...and no one tell M. there are technically undead people in the school! That won&#39;t end well. Although, technically, shovels wouldn&#39;t be that effective against sparklepires...at least, not unless they were set on fire afterwards...)<br><br>Just some thoughts :)<br><br>~DF<br><br>(Oh, and if E. is also afflicted and comes to visit...then some students could start screaming about Team Edward, even though his hair&#39;s the wrong color.

            <p>That is seriously weird though. Just saying.<br><br>I do like the idea of co-writing a mission. It&#39;ll have to wait until I get Permission (which I&#39;m delaying quite a bit, partially because I want to be absolutely sure I&#39;m ready and have time to actually make missions, partially because I&#39;m scared)<br><br>That said, if this mission becomes a thing, I think one of my planned Agents (let&#39;s just call her K., I think you can guess why) would get along with Dawn quite well. And K.&#39;s partner (assuming I get Permission for them) L. would greatly dislike Dawn in a manner similar to how he will/already does dislike K. <br><br>I would just like to add - assuming D. returns to SBEI right after the mission - she&#39;d be a newborn. Newborn sparklepires tend to go for the jugular at the sight/smell/awareness of a human. <br><br>Oh, you KNOW M. wouldn&#39;t care the shovel didn&#39;t do any damage. She&#39;d whack and keep whacking until the dangerous thing was gone. And if anyone mentioned fire would be more effective, she&#39;d go for a Molotov first chance she got. <br><br>(Ehehe E. afflicted and visiting. Do it. Doooooo iiiiiit.

            <p>Looks handy :)<br><br>I actually read the first three books while I was a fan (for a very short time, I assure you, and I was...about 13 or 14 years old, I believe), and then I went on vacation for a month, realized they were terrible, and eventually read most of the fourth book just to find out how the story ended. I then skimmed the last bit that I just couldn&#39;t force myself to read once I&#39;d put the book down because two of my friends begged me to write them a Twilight fanfic and I needed information on Renesmee.

For ever as we spoke of death being a division of the united [soul and body], I thought in my heart of a death that is not so: but the ending together of both.

            <p>It feels rather pretentious, but it means Light&#39;s Daughter. Aila is light, vyn is the possessive, and siniyash is daughter, though that might change at some point.<br>The language itself is Rhellen, and I&#39;m making it for my invented world, Rhel (which also means home in the language; I&#39;m quite proud of that particular development). But really, the version I&#39;m working on might just turn out to be one particular dialect, perhaps that of the elves of that long strip of forest near the mountains...

            <p>I&#39;d say a fourth category, but most closely resembling Generic Fantasy Elves. They&#39;re about five feet tall, tend to have cinnamon or darker skin, purple, indigo, green or brown hair, and live in fiercely territorial tribes. They&#39;re only hostile to other elves, though, and if you can earn their trust...<br><br>I don&#39;t really think there&#39;s anything else too extraordinary, save some indigenous types of flora and fauna, but there&#39;s a whole creation myth that I&#39;ve had a lot of fun with, as well as a whole thing about the everli (the elements, of which there are five: fire, earth, water, air, and time) and the avlari (what I call, for lack of a better word, the counter-elements, and of which there are also five: light, darkness, life, death, and shadow), which together make Inershal (the Balance). There are also a bunch of minor deities and spirits and <i>things</i> that no one really likes to think about. And magic, of course. Magic that has hopefully original origins. Also, Rhel was created by accident. Yup, you heard me right!</p>

            <p>Something about your name makes me want to give you the nickname Sheila. That would be my inner <i>Spyro the Dragon</i> nerd speaking, I guess. <s>Kangaroos are awesome don&#39;t question it</s>.<br><br>Anyway, enough of the rambling. Welcome to the Board! I see you like fantasy books... Ever read the Black Magician Trilogy, by Trudi Cannavan? If not, I recommend it (if you can find a copy anywhere that is). It&#39;s basically sort of like Harry Potter, but slightly more adult. More violence, social class stuff, the like. But eh, I should shut up now. I&#39;m turning back into the rambling beast.<br><br>Have fun on the Board, Sheila!</p>

            <p>I really don&#39;t blame you-- it&#39;s certainly quite a crack pairing, but I love it anyways.<br><br>Harry Potter... is not my favorite series. I personally think it&#39;s overrated. *hides from enthusiasts* And really, poor Narnia. All those Susan redemption fics, and extra Sons of Adam or Daughters of Eve stories, and movieverse Suspian... for that matter, movieverse everything. I don&#39;t like movies.

Except that wouldn&#39;t work.<br> I like Harry Potter, but it isn&#39;t my favorite series either. What <i>is</i> my favorite series, you may ask? The Saga of Recluce. Not a lot of people seem to know it, so I won&#39;t be surprised if you don&#39;t. The only name I recognise from your list is Tamora Pierce (and I really mean the name only), so we&#39;d be even.<br> Poor Narnia, indeed. I decided to stay well away from Narniafic before <i>Prince Caspian</i> was even announced, so I hadn&#39;t even considered the impact of that bizarre movieverse pairing on it.

            <p>Thief of Time and Reaper Man were particular gems there, especially Thief of Time. But I&#39;ve always liked temporal shenanigans, so I&#39;m a bit biased there. The Watch Series was also great, and I agree with SeaTurtle about Thud being one of Discworld&#39;s highest points. <br><br>We already talked in the last thread, as you probably remember. Are you having fun with your new translocator?</p>

            <p>Oops, sorry, just translocated into a wall. It&#39;s so very much fun to use, though I think I may have gotten a bit overenthusiastic. :)<br><br>Have you read The Dark is Rising Sequence by Susan Cooper? Really well-written temporal shenanigans abound!</p>

            <p>Words of advice: never use a short-range transporter of any sort next to a moving body of water until you&#39;re good at aiming it. If you misjudge the distance and fall into the water, the current&#39;s going to hit you during that period of fuzzy-headedness right after you reconstitute. After that, you&#39;re probably going to need somebody to pull you out, which isn&#39;t going to be easy if you end up going under. I lost a good shoe that way.<br>Translocating around still water should be safer, though, at least if you&#39;re a good swimmer.<br><br>I&#39;ve not read anything by Susan Cooper yet. I&#39;ve seen it well-recommended, though, so I wouldn&#39;t turn the Dark is Rising books down if I was given an opportunity to read them.</p>

            <p>Thank you <s>knidly</s> kindly for the information. I do believe that if I ever get Permission, at least one of my agents shall be very bad with portals.<br><br>...But that&#39;s in the far future, so no need to bother with it now. As for TDiR, I would even recommend you deliberately go looking for them. Perhaps using your teleportation device, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re far more proficient with them than I am.</p>

            <p>I feel like this is one of those jokes that I don&#39;t have the frame of reference to get. Is there a canon character named Knidly who likes water?
