            <p>I rather like the way you started off with Eleven and Clara, as well as the colour Blink. Stupid fanbrat, doesn&#39;t know the Classic Series...<br><br>I did spot a couple of things that were off, though. As Des said, there were some weird mechanics issues, and I personally thought you did a bit too much showing and not enough telling, especially during Ashley&#39;s sections. <br><br>Are you going to reference the Blackout? That would be fun, especially &#39;cause Jack knows about the PPC.<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>First of all, the chapter was a fun read. It certainly has a Whoish feel to it, as well as that OFU air.<br>However, it is not without problems. First of all, the mechanics are wonky. I&#39;ve spotted numerous SPaG errors, there&#39;s something wrong with the indentation and there are sentences that simply cut off in the middle.<br>Second, it&#39;s a bit... formulaic for an OFU opening. That&#39;s not bad <i>per se</i> but it detracts from the fun in my opinion. At least the end is a good twist.<br><br>PS: As I&#39;ve told you about two months ago, if you need Agents, Des and (probably) the Librarian are available for cameos/Sue execution/capture.</p>

            <p>First, OOC stuff:<br><br><b><u>Ground Rules</u></b><br><br>1) No controlling other people&#39;s characters. Actions, reactions, dialogue, whether a thrown object hits, etc., are up to the character&#39;s author.<br><br>2) Keep all posts in third person and past tense. It&#39;s just easier to read if we all stick to the same style.<br><br>3) Since this is meant to be a lighthearted RP involving kids, I want zero Serious Business and zero dickery. Holiday-appropriate mischief and shenanigans are okay; causing chaos, wanton destruction, and injuries is not. <i>Scaring</i>, yes; <i>scarring</i>, no.<br><br>4) Please be respectful of the fact that people live in different time zones and have Real World commitments. For instance, if players X, Y, and Z are playing a conversation together and Y stops posting, it&#39;s not cool for X and Z to exchange dozens of posts and leave Y in the dust. Taking turns is encouraged.<br><br>5) If you&#39;re going to say something OOC in an IC post, put it in brackets or something. I use (( double parentheses. ))<br><br>6) Anyone can join, no Permission required!<br><br><b><u>How This Works</u></b><br><br>The basic premise is that the Nursery and parents/guardians of kids are sponsoring trick-or-treating in HQ. Everyone will check in at the Nursery and then head off into the corridors. We&#39;re going to assume that everyone knows to avoid outright dangerous RCs, but yet beware: even technically friendly agents may not be thrilled about munchkins coming a-knocking, and others may not respond according to suburban World One tradition! The treats should be interesting, though...<br><br>The structure of this is modeled after the Agent Mailbox game further down the Board, with some modification.<br><br>- If you want your characters to <i>get</i> trick-or-treaters, please reply to this post with your RC number and the name(s) of who&#39;s at home in the subject line and a description of the RC door and/or interior in the message body.<br><br>- If you want your characters to <i>be</i> trick-or-treaters, please respond to each RC string one at a time, in any order you like. If you want to go around in a cluster, that&#39;s cool, too!<br><br>- I&#39;m going to reply to this post with an OOC discussion string and a Nursery string containing the intro. The latter can be a sort of staging area for introducing your trick-or-treaters, teaming up with other RPers, whatever.<br><br>Basically, the thread will go like this:<br><br>&gt; Original post (this one)<br><br>&gt; &gt; RC #222, Bob and Aerith - Poster 4<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Anybody home?&quot; - Poster 3<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Boo!&quot; shouted Bob. - Poster 4<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Trick or Treat!&quot; - Poster 1<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aerith opened the door... - Poster 4<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Thanks! Bye!&quot; - Poster 1<br><br>&gt; &gt; RC #111, Agent X - Poster 1<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Y and Z knocked on the door. - Poster 2<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A and B also approached the door. - Poster 3<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Hi, A and B!&quot; - Poster 2<br><br>&gt; &gt; The Nursery - Me (This&#39;ll have the IC introduction.)<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Q and V were getting ready to go. - Poster 1<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Hey, can we go with you?&quot; - Poster 2<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sure!&quot; said V. - Poster 1<br><br>&gt; &gt; (( OOC Discussion String )) - Me<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; (( Hey, I have a question! )) - Poster 2<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (( I have an answer! )) - Probably Me<br><br>That should just about cover it, I hope. There will be that OOC string I mentioned for any questions you might have. <br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Sebak emerged from the bathroom in his costume and Tish looked down at him from the ladder where she was putting up orange lights. She sniggered. &quot;Oh, <i>very</i> creative.&quot;<br><br>Sebak raised an eyebrow. &quot;Is that sarcastic?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>No</i>,&quot; Tish said.<br><br>&quot;Why is my costume uncreative? As far as I&#39;m aware this isn&#39;t a common costume.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, but a logical person dressing as Sherlock Holmes is stereotypical.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Obviously, Sherlock Holmes appeals to those with logical minds. And if you ae comparing me to Data, I would like to point out that Data said he finds Vulcan philosophy limiting.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ve got a point,&quot; she conceded, climbing down. &quot;Will you help me with the pumpkins?&quot;<br><br>Sebak picked up his pumpkin - which he had only carved at Tish&#39;s insistence, and was therefore a mathematically precise jack o&#39;lantern - and followed her out the door. She set her pumpkin - which had googly eyes and a lopsided grin - on one side of the door and Sebak set his on the other. <br><br>Sebak watched as she darted back in, grabbed crepe streamers, and added them to the door. When she returned, he said, &quot;I&#39;m confused as to what you are supposed to be.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I couldn&#39;t decide,&quot; she said. &quot;So I&#39;m going as my fandoms.&quot;<br><br>She wore a set of Gryffindor robes over a Camp Half-Blood T-shirt and jeans. Her DS9 combadge was pinned to the robes.<br><br>He nodded. &quot;Quite creative.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you!&quot; she said, strolling over to the replicator and punching something in. A bowl of assorted full-sized candy bars materialized, and she carried it to a table next to the door. <br><br>&quot;All right, we&#39;re ready!&quot;<br><br>Sebak nodded solemnly.<br><br></p>

            <p>Marco West was busy running about the RC hanging various decorations up. &quot;Love this time of year&quot; he said calling to Agent Jameson who sat back in his chair muttering. &quot;Really? I hadn&#39;t noticed you even got Fat&#39;gun into the spirt.&quot; The Nightguant mini flew quietly by carrying a CD which was placed in a boombox, Marco then pushed play as he checked to make sure the treats were set. &quot;Everything is perfect!&quot; Marco said clapping his hands together in joy &quot;You think Sif might stop by?&quot;  The Marshal simply shrugged and gripped his Shockmaul  as Fat&#39;gun stared it&#39;s faceless stare at a black dragon D&amp;D figure but recoiled when it heard the sound of the weapon powering up. &quot;I don&#39;t know and frankly don&#39;t care.&quot; he said annoyed as he went back to his planning and Marco eagerly Awaited Trick or Treaters. </p>

            <p>&quot;&#39;ello there!&quot; came a half baked attempt at a British accent,if he was going to dress in his old Hogwarts robes he was going to at least try and use his friends&#39; accent even if it was a  shallow facade and even if they weren&#39;t really his friends. Marco smiled as Ghostbusters played over the radio and Fat&#39;gun dropped the candy goodie bags into each of the kid&#39;s containers it&#39;s faceless head staring curiously at the costumes it wanted to tickle something so badly but Marco kept it at bay as Marco smiled and looked up &quot;So is it chaos even more than normal out there?&quot; he asked switching back to his american accent.</p>

            <p>But then, almost before the boys were through saying &quot;trick or treat,&quot; the door flew open (inward, thank the Powers That Be), a bizarrely-dressed guy was exclaiming, the radio was shouting &quot;Ghostbusters!&quot;, and some <i>thing</i> swooped over the three kids. There were some alarmed squeaks and shrieks. With a sharp cracking sound, Henry was suddenly no longer at the door, but clinging to Jenni&#39;s legs with his face pressed into the back of her thigh, candy bag abandoned. As the Mpreg child of Harry Potter by Severus Snape, intense emotions could trigger the odd magical outburst like this.<br><br>She tottered with the new pressure, but Ilraen caught her by the arm and she quickly regained her balance.

Was that?&quot;<br><br>(( Falcon, please reply directly to the post you&#39;re responding to, okay?

            <p>Xericka&#39;s could have arguably be considered worse. It was a look that had the promise of knives in it.<br><br>When the door had opened and Marco had sprung out, Aiden had demonstrated a rare turn of speed for a toddler and bolted backwards towards his mother. He was now clinging on to her legs and quietly whimpering, all thoughts of being a brave adventurer forgotten for the moment.<br><br>As the agents spoke, however, her angered expression became tempered with confusion.

Temper your behavior, unless you are willing to deal with the wrath of multiple sets of parents for the foreseeable future.

You must control your pets as well as yourselves, Agents.&gt; <i>His</i> irritated stare had twice the eyeballs behind it, not to mention the long, scythe-like blade at the end of his tail.

            <p>She was, however, a creature of logic. Continuing to berate these agents for both their actions and their grammar -- while perhaps cathartic -- was not an effective use of her time.

            <p>&quot;Though that might not hold true if we denied them their candy at this point,&quot; Jenni added with a wry half-smile. This was by way of agreement. The rush of adrenaline she&#39;d received with the little ones&#39; shrieks was wearing off, and a nice object lesson in overcoming fear and gaining confidence had presented itself. &quot;What do you think, guys?&quot; she asked the kids. &quot;Should we go get your treats?&quot;<br><br>To this, Ian nodded vigorously. &quot;Me want—<i>I</i> want candy,&quot; he corrected himself with an ingratiating look at the grown-ups.<br><br>&lt;Very good, Ian.&gt; Ilraen beamed at him.<br><br>Henry was going to take a bit more convincing.

There was definitely some number of fingers on it, probably four. &quot;Red an&#39; yellow an&#39; blue an&#39; green,&quot; he warbled almost musically.<br><br>&quot;Oh.&quot; Jenni grinned, half embarrassed at his forwardness, half proud of the critical thinking he was showing. &quot;That&#39;s a little canon-teaching song we use,&quot; she told Marco. &quot;It&#39;s got counting, it teaches color words, et cetera. So, uh. What house <i>were</i> you in? I&#39;m a Ravenclaw alumna, actually. Marauder-era role-play &#39;verse, pre-<i>Half-Blood Prince</i>,&quot; she clarified.</p>

            <p>It was important to keep from getting separated in the unpredictable halls of HQ, so at least one adult made sure to hold the kids&#39; hands as they went along. Ilraen had one boy on each side as they approached a door with a flashing orange and black wreath on it.<br><br>&quot;Hey guys, look at that!&quot; Jenni pointed. &quot;That&#39;s a spooky-looking wreath, huh?&quot;<br><br>Ian wrinkled up his face. &quot;Wreaths are for Christmas.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s an orange one,&quot; Henry said. &quot;That means Halloween. Trick or treat?&quot; He looked up hopefully at his mother.<br><br>&quot;Wait for Aiden,&quot; she answered. &quot;You guys are a team now, okay?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Hey Marco you got guests&quot; said the Marshal as Marco rose to his feet and called to Fatu&#39;gun who flew over on silent wings. Marco stood up and put on his gloves  making sure that the Jack-O-Lantern covered his power limter tattoo, he could have used his magic but part of his anti-stu treatment was to learn to and do things for himself. Marco moved to the door and made a few adjustments to mural he had hung showcasing his and Agent Jameson&#39;s missions including one with Medli between them smiling on the beach of Outset Island wearing a pair of PPC standard issue Ray-Ban sunglasses after returning a nerurlized Link back to his grandma&#39;s house and just before returning her home to reset the canon. There was also his favrorite a picture of the two agents with the orginal Mighty Moprhin Power Rangers that had been signed by all five after the infamous Agony in Pink badfic. ((if that hasn&#39;t been claimed yet))He then smiled and waited for the doorbell or knocker to be used. </p>

            <p>The door of RC #2771a was normally adorned with a cheeseburger wrapper, a used band-aid, or any other vaguely sticky detritus the inhabitants hand in hand when they reached the door. Today most of the junk had been cleared away and a plastic skull with gold paint liberally slopped on it had been hung from the lintel. <br><br>Inside, the RC consisted of just one large room lined with consoles, lockers, closets, and several mattresses in various states of disarray. An ornate four-poster bed and a carved wooden cabinet hiding the console gave the impression that someone civilized, or at least ridiculously good at whittling, was trying to impose order on the place; judging by the large number of discarded socks and used dishes, that person was having an uphill struggle of it. A mini-Balrog and a mini-Dragon were curled up together on a disused George Foreman grill, snoozing happily. In a hamster cage, a small fluffy black thing with malevolent red eyes was gnawing on a squeaky rubber Palantir.<br><br>Suicide and Diocletian had been dealing with a crushing schedule for several weeks, and Halloween was their first chance to relax and breathe--so of course, there was a trick-or-treat scheduled. Diocletian had been all for skipping out and putting a big &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door but Suicide, to her surprise, was all for participating. (Dio found herself thinking she should&#39;ve guessed that Su would be eager to share a holiday all about staring mortality and evil in the face.) After a rather juvenile argument and several bouts of name-calling, they&#39;d finally reached an agreement: they would dress up and hand out candy for the trick-or-treaters, but Suicide was not permitted to buy or make any kind of weird, creepy costume. &quot;No trauma allowed,&quot; as she&#39;d put it. <br><br>So, with a knowing look that she wasn&#39;t sure she liked, he&#39;d dug through his wardrobe and come up with loose leather trousers, chest armor, black hair dye, random streaky paint on his shoulders and kohl on his eyes. Dio figured it was some kind of Emo Mongol thing, but at least it didn&#39;t involve the skin of his enemies. Dio herself had borrowed some greasepaint and was now a zombie agent. </p>

            <p>RC #13PKHC&#39;s door had a big X struck over it in caution tape- a decoration that had always been there, ever since before its current owners, a pair of DAVD agents, moved in. On the other side, stood a Pikachu wearing a blue cat costume, and beside him, sat a human male with a bushy brown handlebar moustache, wearing a pink bunny costume and holding a large bowl of candy in his lap.<br><br>&quot;Shockah, remin&#39; meh why we&#39;re dressed up as furry animals that&#39;re colored wrong?&quot; asked the human, in a slow Southern drawl.<br><br>&quot;Well, neither of us can think of anything scary without unintentionally reminiscing about one of our missions. Remember?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah... that&#39;d ment&#39;ly scar th&#39; kids fer sure...&quot;<br><br>&quot;So we came up with something both of us can guarantee could not scare- or mentally scar- anyone, just to play it safe.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, now I r&#39;member...&quot;<br><br>And so, the blue cat and giant pink bunny, in an RC decorated in an Easter-esque style very much at odds with what most people would consider Halloweenish, awaited the first kids that would knock on their door and request candy.</p>

He then looked to see Shumann sitting there stuffing its face with...<br><br>&quot;Oh, god damn it, <i>Shumann</i>!&quot; Florestan shouted, stamping his way over to the mini. &quot;What did I tell you about eating the candy!?&quot;</p>

            <p>(( I was really counting on getting some interaction between Ilraen and Cindy, so since it seems most everyone else has lost interest, I&#39;m just cutting to the chase. Hopefully you&#39;re still around, Herr. ^_^; PC, up to you if Xericka and Aiden are still with the group. ))<br><br>Several doors along, and everyone&#39;s bags of candy were heavier. Ian and Henry, being pretty little still, were starting to get tired, so Ilraen was giving them a ride. It was a great idea in principle, but made difficult in practice by two facts: one, his back was a bit more sloped than a horse&#39;s, so staying on required a firm grip on the kids&#39; part and a steady gait on his; and two, tired kids meant kids being rowdier than ever in an effort not to get taken home.<br><br>&lt;I promise you,&gt; Ilraen was saying for the nth time, &lt;if you do not stop bouncing you will fall, and we will go back to the Nursery. Do you both understand me?&gt;<br><br>His only answer was another chorus of the &quot;Trick or treat! No bed!&quot; song that had been going like a broken record for the last five minutes.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s too bad,&quot; Jenni said, shaking her head sadly. &quot;I guess we&#39;ll just have to skip this door.&quot;<br><br>&quot;NOOO!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, really? Because I don&#39;t see well-behaved dragons right now, and only good dragons get treats.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ll be good, Mommy!&quot; Henry said. &quot;Promise!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Double promise!&quot; Ian added.<br><br>Jenni exchanged a dubious look with Ilraen. &quot;All right,&quot; she said finally. &quot;But this&#39;ll be the last one if you two can&#39;t keep it together, hear me?&quot;<br><br>They nodded emphatically, making their dragon-scaled hoods bob.<br><br>&quot;All right.

And people worried about <i>her</i> wiles! She chuckled to herself as she turned to lift the two boys off Ilraen&#39;s back.<br><br>&lt;Yes! Flattering!&gt; Ilraen seized hold with relief. &lt;Um, everyone, this is Agent Cinderella. Cindy, these are my friends Jenni, Henry, Ian, Xericka, and Aiden. And this must be one of your partners.&gt; He nodded toward Xanthus.<br><br><br>(( I hope I guessed the right Morrigan. <i>Dragon Age</i>, right? Rather low-cut, vest-like getup with a hood? ))</p>

            <p>&lt;Ilraen-Aroline-Fothergill. An Andalite, by the way. It is good to meet you, as well. Cindy has nothing but positive things to say about both her partners.

That was unusual in his experience.<br><br>Jenni, meanwhile, ushered Henry and Ian up to the door, and made sure there was space for Xericka and Aiden, too. At Cindy&#39;s question, she smiled and took the liberty of answering even though she wasn&#39;t the one addressed. &quot;That would be genetics at work. Well, something like that. To use the technical terminology, Henry here is out of Harry Potter by Severus Snape. Personally, I think he takes more after Severus,&quot; she added with obvious affection. It might ring strangely in other people&#39;s ears, since Snape wasn&#39;t exactly winning prizes in the looks department, but it wasn&#39;t strictly about that.<br><br>&quot;Hi!&quot; Henry chirped, realizing he was currently the center of attention. &quot;I&#39;m a green dragon! Rar!&quot; He bared his teeth and curled his fingers into claws.<br><br>&quot;We gonna gobble up all the candy!&quot; declared Ian.</p>

            <p>It was fitting, he thought, that someone who had just become acquainted with the <i>Hunger Games</i> continuum would choose a costume from the series. &lt;I wish I had seen her, too. We must have just missed each other in the Nursery. Ah well. I will have to meet her another time.&gt;<br><br>The two boys giggled at Xanthus. The turian might have had some pretty sharp teeth in his weirdly leonine, skull-like face, but since he wasn&#39;t making any sudden movements or loud noises and nobody else was worried about him, they didn&#39;t have any reason to be, either.<br><br>&quot;<i>Two</i> dragons,&quot; Henry corrected, holding up what probably amounted to two fingers. &quot;Ian&#39;s the white one.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh-huh!&quot; Ian nodded. &quot;Give us you candy, or we gobble <i>you</i> up!&quot; He pointed for emphasis.<br><br>With Xanthus distracting the kids, the other grown-ups could talk more freely. Jenni gave a short, dry laugh at the question. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s pretty much the only way you get a baby out of two men in most universes. All I know about it is that Harry was written like a stereotypical pregnant woman and Severus was his doting husband. As if,&quot; she scoffed.<br><br>&quot;But enough about that,&quot; she went on, her expression turning conspiratorial, though it would have to be a one-woman conspiracy. She put up an arm and leaned against the doorframe toward Cindy. There was a mischievous glint in her eyes, though somewhat dulled by the purple contacts she was wearing for her Daenerys costume. &quot;What about you? I&#39;ve heard a fair bit from Ilraen—only good things, of course—but I&#39;m pretty much honor-bound to size you up, make sure your intentions are pure and all that.&quot;<br><br>Ilraen became quite alarmed at this speech. &lt;Jenni, I really do not think that is necessary.&gt; If she embarrassed him—or worse, Cindy!—he didn&#39;t know what he would do.<br><br>&quot;Sure it is. It&#39;s in the Meddlesome Friend Credo, not to mention the Pseudo-Guardian Manifesto.&quot; She grinned. &quot;So, Cindy, what <i>are</i> your intentions toward my boy here?&quot;</p>

            <p>Cindy&#39;s head snapped back slightly, and she looked at Jenny with a bright red flush on her face. &quot;I... Uh...

I... what?&quot;<br><br>Xanthus looked down at the children squatting down to their level as he eyed them. &quot;Oh my, you&#39;re going to eat me!&quot; said Xanthus. He then chuckled, looking at the two children. &quot;Hope neither of you are allergic to dextro food, though. I&#39;m sure that two dragons as mighty as you two are would find it anticlimactic to be taken down by a food allergy, don&#39;t you think?&quot; He nodded. &quot;So to help you out, the candy&#39;s on the couch.

            <p>When the tiny dragons popped out of the candy, Jenni snatched her hand back with a yelp. As soon as she got a good look at them, though, her alarm dissolved into laughter.<br><br>The kids laughed, too. Someone else being the butt of a joke is always funny, <i>especially</i> a grownup. Plus, now there was candy scattered all around, like prizes from a piñata, and they eagerly snatched it up.<br><br>&quot;Okay,&quot; Jenni said to Xanthus after a minute, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I doubted you. Where did these little guys come from? I don&#39;t recognize the breed, and I know a thing or two about dragons!&quot; This statement was given weight by her Mother of Dragons costume, complete with a little black plush Drogon pinned to her shoulder with his posable tail around her neck.<br><br><br>Ilraen glanced into the RC at Jenni&#39;s cry, but relaxed when he saw everything was all right. He reverted to a casual posture and beamed at Cindy&#39;s attempt to pronounce the long name. Andalites didn&#39;t name themselves with mouth-speakers in mind, that was for sure. At least she got the first part down, and that was doing pretty well for a start, he thought.<br><br>&lt;Elfangor was single-handedly responsible for setting the events of the <i>Animorphs</i> series in motion,&gt; he answered. &lt;He was the one who gave the morphing ability to the five human children as he was dying, allowing them to resist the Yeerk invasion of Earth while the Andalite fleet was held up elsewhere.&gt; That was an oversimplification, but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to admit that his people hadn&#39;t much cared about the fate of Earth for some time. &lt;Before that, Elfangor discovered the Time Matrix and prevented it from falling into the hands of the Yeerks, which would have allowed them to rewrite history as they saw fit. He ended up exiled on Earth and voluntarily took human form. He married Loren, a girl he&#39;d rescued from some other aliens, and their son, Tobias, became one of the Animorphs himself—as did Elfangor&#39;s little brother, Aximili, who crashed into the Pacific Ocean during the same space battle that fatally wounded Elfangor. So you see, he and his influence are directly responsible for saving Earth and ending the Andalite-Yeerk war,&gt; he concluded with pride. The story was full of holes, thanks in part to how convoluted it actually was, but he thought he&#39;d covered all the important points.<br><br>---<br><br>(( I went on an epic quest to track down information about those dragons, and I&#39;ve come back very confused. First, it looks like you only adopted two from Astral Void, purple and red, and you originally named them Jasmine (spelled &quot;Jazmine&quot; the first time it came up; you might wanna fix that) and Tiana. Someone else got the third one from Astral, and there aren&#39;t any references to your agents getting another one from somewhere else that I could find in their missions or their pages, so no idea what I&#39;m looking at there. Also, since these guys were apparently created in a mad science experiment and aren&#39;t actually from the Narnia-verse, aren&#39;t they just baby dragons rather than mini-dragons? Narnia dragons are notoriously unfriendly, anyway (except for Eustace), and I don&#39;t know that they come in such bright colors.<br><br>(( Also, I caught a reference to Cindy reading <i>The Hunger Games</i> (or at least, Xanthus thought so) back in their first interlude. You might wanna go back and change that to something else, since it&#39;s kind of a big deal that they&#39;re all reading it for the first time in &quot;Relocation.&quot; ))</p>

Thinking of how silly it might look but deciding to go with it anyway, Cindy held out her arms and her staff.<br><br>&quot;Morrigan is the adopted daughter of Flemeth, the famous witch of the Kokari Wilds of <i>Dragon Age</i>,&quot; she began. &quot;Forsooth, she did meet the Grey Warden who would become the hero of Ferelden, and she did beseech of this Warden to join his quest. Her snark was bountiful, her English was quite archaic, and her magic...&quot; She shrugged, deciding to break character. &quot;Well, she had magic that allowed her to shapeshift into an animal for a short period of time.&quot; She looked at Ilraen. &quot;Hence, why her and Elfangor would make a team.&quot; She then glanced to the side. &quot;Though... I would beware, because, forsooth, Witches of the Wilds may be untrustworthy in some regards.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Just what are you insinuating, sir?&quot; she asked with raised eyebrows and a rakish half-smile. But, she quickly shook her head. &quot;Actually, don&#39;t answer that. I&#39;d love to get into an innuendo duel, but this isn&#39;t a good time.&quot; She nodded toward the kids.<br><br>&quot;Speaking of which, we should probably get going.&quot; She looked over at Ilraen, who still seemed immersed in his conversation. &quot;I&#39;d hate to break that up, though,&quot; she said wistfully.

He wasn&#39;t sure whether Cindy had gotten back into character or if she was being serious. Could she be talking about herself?

            <p>&quot;People can be allergic to just about anything. Including compounds in certain bodily fluids.

Good freak out, or bad freak out?&quot;<br><br><br>Ilraen was pretty sure Cindy was talking about the character now, not herself. That was good, though it left him confused as to why she was embarrassed. One canon character asking another to impregnate her wasn&#39;t anything that bothered him. &lt;It&#39;s all right,&gt; he assured her. &lt;Elfangor has plenty of experience dealing with people who have their own agenda. In any case, that does not sound like such a bad ulterior motive. Nothing like, say, selling out your own species to the Yeerks to save your skin. That was Chapman,&gt; he explained. &lt;He was another human who was captured by Skrit Na and rescued by Elfangor, same as Loren.&gt;</p>

            <p>&quot;It&#39;s so nice to see the children having some fun outside,&quot; remarked Cloudsweeper as she trotted down the hallway, watching several costumed children and their guardians trick-or-treating. &quot;They all look so adorable, don&#39;t they, Taldy? I think my favourite one is the little boy over there dressed as a giraffe.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Indeed. It is very interesting: I have observed this celebration for fifteen years as a PPC agent, but I never once understood why Terrans spontaneously give out treats on this day. Is it some sort of giving of alms?</i>&quot;<br><br>The disguised pegasus shrugged. &quot;Iunno. Back in Equestria, we have Nightmare Night-- though I&#39;ve only heard of it, never actually been there. We disguise ourselves to avoid drawing the attention of Nightmare Moon. Maybe the candy is supposed to be an offering or something?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Perhaps. I shall ask the next time we see someone. Shall we satisfy our curiosity and knock on a door?</i>&quot;<br><br>The little changeling nodded vigorously and knocked at the nearest RC&#39;s door-- number 2183. <br><br>&quot;Trick or treat!&quot; said Cloudsweeper once the door swung open and tugged her saddlebags off her back.<br><br>&quot;<i>And if you don&#39;t mind me asking, what is the meaning of Hallow-- oh.</i>&quot; said Taldaris, hesitating when he caught sight of a fellow alien. &quot;<i>Never mind.</i>&quot;</p>

            <p>The pegasus patted her head where the tiny dragons had stepped. &quot;Thanks!&quot; Cloudsweeper approached the candy bowl.

            <p>&quot;I was actually rescued from a Harry Potter Suefic. My friends were all named after the Disney princesses, and hell, I&#39;m named after a Disney princess myself. So...

            <p>The interior of RC #1110 was fairly terrifying without any extra effort on anyone&#39;s part, home as it was to a giant spider, a demon of fire and shadow, and a wicked-looking blue dragon with slit-eyes and lots of yellow fangs. There were always cobwebs, and it always smelled of brimstone. Today, the interior was lit only by the glow of Arasgorn the mini-Balrog and a dozen tall black candles on the console, from which came a steady stream of pipe organ music (always unnervingly not-quite-in-tune). Severe the mini-Aragog skulked in a corner of his web. Snerri the Monstrous Nightmare lay just inside the door, keeping watch. On either side of the door were two large Jack O&#39;lanterns carved with leering faces.<br><br>Gall Bonecrusher, flatly forbidden from egging other RCs or jumping people for their loot, contented herself with decking out in full Viking battle gear and painting her face like a skull. She had wanted to get her hands on some synthetic flames from the <i>Hunger Games</i> &#39;verse, but those were sadly hard to come by. She lurked in the dark space between the console and the wall next to the door, waiting for the first chance to jump out.<br><br>Derik posted himself in a chair just outside the door to prevent this from happening. He was actually somewhat less hard on the eyes than usual by dint of a black mask a la the Dread Pirate Roberts, which covered up some of the scars and obscured the blind eye on the right side of his face. He refused to be the Phantom, ever, <i>ever</i>, but he acceded to being the Pirate to his partner&#39;s Viking. Rather than candy, he&#39;d brewed up a sweetened and milky batch of Pernese <i>klah</i> to ladle into paper Dixie cups for thirsty trick-or-treaters.<br><br>And when it was over, they were both bound for Rudi&#39;s for some <i>real</i> fun.</p>

            <p>The door to RC 845 was left open and was covered in fake spiderwebs made of white yarn and plastic spiders. In the middle of the doorway sat a brass cauldron on a magical fire. It was tended by Yakov, who was dressed in a pointed black hat and his usual battered travelling cloak. The wizard occasionally added ingredients to the cauldron, causing the contents to glow different colours and bubble ominously.<br><br>A perch stood next to the doorway, supporting a sinister-looking yet sleepy Murkrow. A large bowl of candy was placed on a stool next to the perch, with a simple &quot;Help yourself... if you dare!&quot; sign propped against the container. The Darkness Pokémon occasionally woke up to squawk at passersby or to cast Mean Look on someone who tried to take more than their fair share of sugar. </p>

            <p>The door to RC #999 was a sliding <i>Star Trek</i> model with controls mounted to the wall beside it.

Perhaps the occupant was going for a hair-raising Jekyll &amp; Hyde effect, but then again, perhaps he&#39;d been coerced into participating in something he really didn&#39;t want to by dint of a long, heated conversation with his partner, who had unaccountably developed a fondness for small children.

            <p>&quot;Certain people I know would take your head off for implying it could be otherwise just &#39;cause a kid&#39;s adopted.&quot; He shrugged, though; it was none of his business, really.<br><br>Looking down at Clara again, he appeared to have a thought. &quot;You know sign language?&quot; he asked, accompanied by a halting series of gestures that translated to the same in American Sign Language. He&#39;d seen demonstrations in school and church in his youth, plus a few TV programs with an ASL translator—enough to scrounge up a basic vocabulary if he put his mind to it. He was by no means fluent, though, nor a paragon of fine motor control, and his signs came off somewhat robotic.<br><br>(( Not intending to ignore Eusabius, but it occurred to me that Nume&#39;s timeline is a little wonky right now. He technically celebrated his tenth anniversary as an agent this February with a surprise (read: ambush) party in the Cafeteria, but you didn&#39;t know that because I haven&#39;t written about it yet. ^_^; So, theoretically, your agents could have been there and therefore might know perfectly well who Nume is, even if they aren&#39;t really  acquainted.

            <p>Nume turned back to Eusabius with a look of mild alarm at the word <i>friend</i>. &quot;Let&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves here. I remember things, that&#39;s all.

            <p>Zerenze nodded, looking at Nume. &quot;I haven&#39;t gotten into that yet, but it sounds like an awesome canon to be an alien in.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So I have heard,&quot; said Eusabius. He glanced down at Clara before nodding. &quot;Well, I suppose we must be off then.

            <p>RC 9.81 had been transformed from its normal self into something much more in fitting with the holiday celebration that had gripped parts of the HQ. A sign above the door on the outside read &quot;Happy All Hallows Eve&quot; whilst hastily scrawled underneath in brackets was &quot;Halloween&quot;. The door itself was black with an orange face painted two thirds of the way down the door at what both Apollo and Kelly had deemed &#39;kids height&#39;. <br>Inside the RC James &#39;Apollo&#39; Peirson and Kelly Jones, daughter of Apollo (thankfully not James) were all prepared, even if the former was rolling on the floor laughing as Kelly tried to talk to him. <br>&quot;Seriously Apollo, she had her own shop and everything.&#39;Auntie Em&#39;s Gnome Emporium&#39;.&quot; Kelly dressed as Circe stomped her foot in frustration as Apollo managed to get out an answer before he started laughing again.<br>&quot;Yeah, sure. I know you&#39;re rehearsing what you&#39;re going to say to the kids, but seriously? A gnome emporium? is that the best you can do?&quot; Dressed as Sportsmaster, a relatively unscary looking villain from the DC universe Apollo lifted up the hockey mask covering his face for a breath and saw the look on Kelly&#39;s face. &quot;You&#39;re serious aren&#39;t you?&quot; Kelly nodded. Apollo continued &quot;Well, it looks like we swapped personalities for a bit. Want yours back?&quot; <br>Kelly smiled, &quot;Why? so I can see you make a prat of yourself again?&quot;<br>Apollo shook his head. &quot;I think I&#39;ve done that enough for today. Anyway, aren&#39;t the kids meant to be around soon? Shouldn&#39;t we do an inventory check and make sure this place does look like a super-villians lair?&quot;<br>Kelly shrugged. &quot;With you being serious now we might as well.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Not all of them are for you mind.&quot; he said crouching down to Malran&#39;s height, not even bothering to stay in character any more. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be fair to not share your winnings with your friends would it. Besides we need to keep some for any more brave warriors that pass us by.&quot; Looking over at Saim Apollo sighed and answered. &quot;Well young hero, like you have your gear and clothes to wear I have mine.

Picking it up he sifted through it as he walked back towards the trio of kids. &quot;Yep, there&#39;s a couple of bits of dextro candy in here.&quot; he said, moving towards Saim, &quot;It&#39;s right at the top for you.

            <p>On the corridor wall beneath the trapdoor that was the entrance to RC #−273.15, a large and obvious arrow had been painted in glow-in-the-dark green paint. Next to it ws a pull-chain connected to a bell. The arrow pointed upwards to where two pumpkins hung from the ceiling, suspended on ropes made to look like spider silk.<br><br>One pumpkin depicted a vague likeness of a goblin&#39;s face - whoever had carved this pumpkin had probably done it with a sword, or at least a dagger, so it was only a very rough semblence.<br><br>The other pumpkin could not have been more different. All the cuts were clean and straight - if slightly singed - and it seemed to bear the likeness of a gargoyle.<br><br>Set in the ceiling between the pumpkins was a trapdoor, around the edges of which came an eerie green glow (reflected from Cyba&#39;s alcove via a series of mirrors). Beyond, Eagrus had rigged up a pulley with more of the &#39;spider silk&#39; rope, on the end of which was a plastic cauldron draped with cobwebs and filled with the good old failsafe that was chocolate.</p>

            <p>Several more chimes sounded in response to the bell, growing steadily more sinister until they ended in an ominous &#39;dong&#39;!<br><br>The trapdoor creaked open slowly (despite usually having well-oiled hinges), spilling eerie green light into the corridor. There was a brief pause, then two heads were stuck over the edge. One of them was wearing a helmet draped with fake cobwebs, with eight googly eyes stuck on the forehead. The other one had her usual laser-eye and cable-hair, but her head appeared to be floating above her shoulders because her neck was invisible (thanks to the &#39;neckless&#39; she had acquired during a mission).<br><br>&quot;Muahahaha! Who comes a-ringing on our doorbell?&quot; asked the guy in the helmet, in a rather fake-sounding deep and scary voice.<br><br>The woman had been about to add something spooky to her partner&#39;s greeting (in her Borg-voice for extra effectiveness), but what came out was: &quot;Oh, I LIKE your armour!&quot; It was directed at both Eusabius and Zerenze.<br><br>Her partner, Eagrus, facepalmed.<br><br>&quot;Ooooh... red... pretty...&quot; murmured Cyba, going slightly cross-eyed.<br><br>&quot;Oh, no...&quot; muttered Eagrus. His head withdrew for a minute, and shortly after he yanked Cyba by the shoulders and she diappeared too. There came few sounds of scuffling and muffled protests before Eagrus came back with Cyba now blindfolded.<br><br>&quot;Sorry,&quot; Eagrus apologised. &quot;Red sends my partner into a trance, for some reason.&quot;</p>

            <p>As it was, she simply smiled up at the two seemingly disembodied heads, her eyes twinkling brightly. She then turned her gaze to Eusabius and his red armor.<br><br>Zerenze did this as well, but this time he was quick to chuckle. &quot;Well, Eusabius, I knew that armor looked good on you, but it&#39;s getting the ladies interested now!&quot; He placed his hand on Eusabius&#39; shoulder, and then looked up at Eagrus and Cyba. &quot;Am I going to have to start swatting them away from you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That shall not be necessary, Z,&quot; Eusabius said.

            <p>&quot;Actually, I think it&#39;s something similar to the Redshirt Effect,&quot; hypothesised Eagrus. &quot;It doesn&#39;t help that Cyba loves armour anyway.&quot; He turned his attention to Clara. &quot;And yes, we do have candy.

            <p>&quot;The Redshirt Effect is a known hazard of the Trekverse,&quot; explained Eagrus. &quot;Wearing red there attracts all manner of bad luck, especially if that red happens to be part of a Starfleet uniform. It turns you into a magnet for trouble. Wear red and you&#39;ll be the first one to get sucked into space...&quot;<br><br>&quot;... eaten by monsters...&quot;<br><br>&quot;... captured by Klingons...&quot;<br><br>&quot;... caught in an explosion...&quot;<br><br>&quot;...assimilated by the Borg...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Cyba!&quot; exclaimed Eagrus, elbowing her pointedly.<br><br>&quot;What?

            <p>Meanwhile, Zerenze listened as well, but he edged closer to Eusabius. After a bit, the Elite then held his arm up.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Eusabius!&quot; he said.

There&#39;s a reason I&#39;m wearing green armor, you know!&quot;<br><br>Clara looked up at Zerenze and Eusabius, blinking in surprise at Zerenze.

            <p>Sara and Zach had made quite an effort for this Hallowe&#39;en. The RC door had been covered with black paper, on which orange cut-outs - several of them rather wonky - of pumpkins, bats, witches on brooms, and other such spooky images had been stuck. Fake cobwebs trailed down the hinges.<br><br>Inside, the room was similarly festooned wiith a kind of carnival spookiness. Black and orange streamers were everywhere, several walls were draped in black, and cobwebs were tucked anywhere a cobweb could possibly go and several places they couldn&#39;t.

            <p>The RC&#39;s door was wide open, with Vania standing expectantly just inside and dressed in Spartan armor (sans helmet).  By virtue of an extension cord, the RC&#39;s mini-fridge had been scooted next to the door.  Little plush Behemoths, spiders and Zubats were pinned into the generic surface around the door frame.  The doorway was lit by a green glow (not as a decoration, but simply due to the mini-Hound of the Baskervilles who was resident there).<br><br>In the background, Doc was pacing a random path around the RC.  He wasn&#39;t in uniform, but was still celebrating Halloween by binging on Stephen King, Edgar Allan Poe and H. P. Lovecraft short stories.  Occasionally, he would start reading aloud, but Vania was making sure to stop him from scaring any children with liberal application of thrown object.</p>

Music from Equestria and the brony fandom played over soe &#39;borrowed&#39; speakers fro a particular DJ. Classic games such as spider toss, apple bobbing, and pumpkin catapulting (directed through portals) were set and waited to be played. Of corse, no Nightmare Night celebration was complete without a statue of Nightmare Moon to offer candy to.<br><br>Marvin was dressed as a humanized Shining Armor, as he paced across the RC floor, practicing his telling of the Tale of Nightmare Moon as he waited for people to arrive. &quot;Every year, we put on a disguise, to save ourselves from her scanning eyes. No, wait...<i>searching</i>. To save ourselves from her <i>searching</i> eyes...&quot;<br><br>Printworthy shook his head, himself waiting patently for children to stop by so he could bring them some cheer that Nightmare Night. He chose to wear Daring Do&#39;s outfit, having decided that he should acknowledge his former position as the author of the popular book seres. He smiled slightly, as he fully anticipated to have several little ones attempt to hug him. Several big ones, too. He held no intention of stopping them.</p>

            <p>Somehow the entrance to this particular response center has been redone in a colonial air, with dramatic columns and swathes of luxurious red velvet. The door is wide open, revealing Rachel Calendar dressed as an unconvincing George Washington (his teeth were never that shiny, and his grin likely never that wide due to the aforementioned teeth) and a holographic projection of Cornelius&#39;s avatar decked out like Benjamin Franklin, complete with receding stringy hairline and overstuffed waistline. They appear to be engrossed in a debate over the framing of the Constitution.  A large bowl of assorted sweets is perched on the edge of Cornelius&#39;s projector.</p>

            <p>Of course, he peeked through his krogan costume, looking at the &quot;oddly&quot; dressed Rachel Calendar. However, his eyes immediately bugged out, rushing straight for Cornelius&#39; projection.<br><br>&quot;Sorsha! Saimy! Look!&quot; The little salarian excitedly rushed over, hopping up and down. &quot;It&#39;s an AI!&quot;<br><br>Saim, who before then had been nervous about really entering the RC, perked up at the mention of AI&#39;s, and then looked right at Cornelius&#39; projection. &quot;An AI?&quot; Saim asked with an enthusiasm that Anneli was <i>very</i> unused to seeing. &quot;Cool!&quot;<br><br>The quarian ran over immediately, leaving Sorsha to stand and sigh quietly as Anneli came in behind them.<br><br>&quot;Sorry about them,&quot; she said. She rubbed the back of her head. &quot;I <i>totally</i> didn&#39;t think two of &#39;em would run straight for the AI...&quot; She chuckled nervously, closing her eyes and giving her a sheepish smile.</p>

            <p>&quot;I totally would&#39;ve run for Cornelius if I was their age. AIs are pretty cool.

After a few barely suppressed snorts, she pulled herself back together. &quot;Ahem. Well then! Since our nation has no royalty, you must be a visiting diplomat! Welcome to you all!

            <p>...there came a yelp, followed by a series of thumps and the sound of laughter. While odd sounds are not unheard of on Halloween night, these lacked the polish one would expect from a playlist of spooky noises.<br><br>The door swung open. From out of the darkness of the RC stepped the figures of Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega -- or for those looking for the agent beneath the disguise, James Pittman and Laura Dukes. While James looked fairly close to the part (film purists would have pointed out his inaccurate facial hair), Laura seemed to have a bit of trouble channelling her inner John Travolta. Her hair was the right color and her expression was pretty spot-on, but her suit didn&#39;t seem to fit her frame all that well. Of course, Travolta didn&#39;t have to deal with things like a metal arm, an electronic eye, and an impressive set of bosoms.<br><br>Judging by the glares Laura was shooting her grinning partner, it&#39;d been she who yelped and he who laughed. Those with very acute senses (and a knowledge of video games) might surmise that their behavior might have something to do with the laptop sitting on a table behind them with the item screen from <i>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</i> on it.<br><br>James nodded to the two new arrivals. &quot;Evening y&#39;all,&quot; he said. &quot;Having a good Halloween, I hope?&quot;</p>

            <p>The Official HQ Trick or Treat had been announced by console post for the last week. The whole thing was being coordinated through the Nursery: everyone taking kids out—their own or as a chaperone—was to meet up there first and check in.<br><br>The reception area of the Nursery was currently festooned with an explosion of arts and crafts, most of it with a motif of pumpkin-orange, cat-black, and bone-white, but there was the occasional spot of zombie-green and hellfire-red. It was generally agreed that none of the things depicted with the Crayolas, popsicle sticks, and paper plates were actually scary, of course, but Halloween wasn&#39;t about fear. It was about dressing up and panhandling for sugar.<br><br>There were already a wide array of costumes milling about, waiting for the okay to start. One knot of people was comprised of a silver-haired Mother of Dragons with a little green dragon holding one hand, a little white dragon holding the other, and a little black dragon pinned to one shoulder. There was also a blue Andalite with them, but he wasn&#39;t in costume. He just figured he&#39;d fit in best as himself.<br><br>Four-year-old Henry Robinson had insisted on being the green one—it was one of his favorite colors, and furthermore, he was a <i>Pern</i> dragon. He even had a little cloth doll for his rider.<br><br>The white dragon was Ian Thomas Horowitz, a pale-haired, pale-eyed boy a little older than Henry whom Agent Ilraen had rescued during one of his missions. Ian hadn&#39;t been formally adopted by anyone yet, but Ilraen took it upon himself to check in on the boy whenever he came to visit Henry, so he became part of the group.<br><br>Jenni Robinson, of course, was Daenerys Targaryen. Her wig itched and she was pretty sure everyone was looking at the Sue-tracking anklet the DIA had slapped on her after her recent unauthorized trans-continuum jaunt had come to light, but she smiled anyway. The kids were just too cute, and heck, this was going to be fun. Almost time now.<br><br>(( Sorry I took so long to post this. I had a serious attack of writer&#39;s block. &gt;.<br> </p>

            <p>In the Nursery&#39;s reception area, several metres away from the door, a protoss and his Earth pony partner were having a heated argument as they waited for their adoptive sister to finish work. <br><br>&quot;<i>It is not a windsock. It is a hood,</i>&quot; said Taldaris telepathically as he fixed his shining blue eyes on his partner. &quot;<i>This is the God Tier outfit of a Heir of Mind. It is my disguise for the night and I will not have you constantly make snide comments about my hood. It falls under the same rules as the cloak. You have agreed to not make fun of my cloak, yes? Then please refrain from mocking my hood.</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hee hee! No, really, you should see yourself!&quot; giggled Fire Flash, adjusting her viking helmet so that she could stare up at her partner. &quot;Look, you&#39;ve even stuffed your ponytails in it!&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>These &#39;ponytails&#39; are my neural cords. Shall I explain--</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, spare me the biology lesson. Couldn&#39;t you have just used your DORKS to make yourself human to wear it? You would look less...DORK-y, maybe?&quot; the pony disguised as a viking promptly dissolved into laughter at her own joke.<br><br>&quot;<i>Sometimes I wonder why I have not applied for a new partner,</i>&quot; said Taldaris, rolling his eyes. <br><br>&quot;Aw, you don&#39;t mean that,&quot; said Fire Flash, wiping a tear of mirth from her eye. &quot;I know that you like my style. And speaking of style, make way for Cloudsweeper! So, did the supervisors give you the go-ahead?&quot; she asked her adoptive sister.<br><br>Cloudsweeper-- who was disguised as a MLP-verse changeling-- nodded. &quot;Yep! I&#39;m all set to go. So, what&#39;s the plan? Do we just go out and start knocking on doors or...?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, I was thinking...&quot; started Fire Flash before a [Bip.] interrupted her. She pulled a PDA from the utility pouch strapped to her foreleg and stared at the screen for a few seconds. &quot;Aw, for the love of Celestia. Okay, change of plans. Taldy will bring you trick-or-treating. Sorry kiddo, but I can&#39;t come with you: they need me back at the office. All right then. Don&#39;t come back too late, eh? Cloudsweeper, brush your teeth after eating candy. Taldaris, don&#39;t go on a taste-testing spree again. Leave some candy for me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course!&quot; said Cloudsweeper. &quot;We&#39;ll see you later!&quot;<br><br>As Fire Flash left the room, Cloudsweeper looked up at her guardian. &quot;Um... Taldy? What&#39;s with the big ol&#39; windsock on your costume?&quot;</p>

            <p>Eusabius looked at little Clara, adjusting the hat on her generic witch costume once again as he smiled reassuringly at her. &quot;There you go,&quot; he said calmingly. &quot;That seems to be a much better position for your hat, is it not?&quot;<br><br>Clara beamed in response, striking a pose and looking at Eusabius happily.<br><br>The DIC agent laughed. &quot;It gladdens me to see you agree,&quot; he said. He patted her shoulder, and then stood up himself, brushing a spot of dust off of his red-colored armor. He crossed his arms, and then glanced at Zerenze.<br><br>The Elite was of course still rubbing his fake green armor there. &quot;I don&#39;t know if this was a good idea, Eusabius,&quot; Zerenze said. &quot;I just... There are so many <i>plates</i>...&quot;<br><br>Eusabius chuckled, walking up to the Elite and placing his hand on the chestplate. He glanced down at the leg armor, briefly noting how it seemed to be completely strange-looking, and then he looked up at Zerenze.<br><br>&quot;Well, that is an unfortunate side effect of older armor,&quot; he said. &quot;For what it is worth, I think you look quite dashing in it.&quot;<br><br>Zerenze blushed. &quot;You sure?&quot; he asked. &quot;I just... I feel--&quot;<br><br>And then Eusabius&#39; hand dragged up the armor and cupped the the mandibles, the DIC agent&#39;s index finger rubbing that spot between the mandibles that always seemed to make Zerenze feel good no matter when he did it.<br><br>&quot;You look quite excellent,&quot; said Eusabius. &quot;I assure you of that.&quot; Eusabius dropped his hand. &quot;Now come. We are already quite late to the proceedings. Let us move on now, shall we?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sure,&quot; Zerenze replied, looking down at Clara. &quot;Come on, Clara. Let&#39;s go get you some candy.&quot;<br><br>The little girl beamed with pride, and followed the two men out of the Nursery.</p>

It came off looking more like Big Thunder Mountain, but since she could still see eyes she figured it would be harmless.<br><br>&quot;Right,&quot; she said. &quot;Let&#39;s hope we don&#39;t bump into a krogan, okay?&quot; She chuckled nervously, and then looked to Sorsha and Saim.

I guess...&quot; Saim said as he looked over at Sorsha. &quot;It was... It was Sorsha&#39;s idea, actually.

            <p>Luke Celinus, looking slightly sheepish, edged into the Nursery and tried not to step on anyone. The big man had decided not to mess about too much in the way of costume, instead going for a vaguely pirate-y flavour of his usual uniform (helped immensely by the fact he always wore an eyepatch anyway, having only one eye). Spotting what looked like the official gathering point, he headed over with a nod to Jenni. &quot;This&#39;s the Hallowe&#39;en meetup, the- oof!&quot; <br><br>He was cut off as a red and tan blur cannoned into him at about waist level with a squeal of &quot;DAD!&quot; and quickly resolved itself into a very excited seven-year-old boy dressed as a Jedi Padawan. &quot;Dad guess what we&#39;re going trickatreating and we&#39;re gonna go round HQ and get scared by people and they&#39;re gonna give us sweets!&quot;<br><br>Luke just chuckled and set about calming Owen down, wondering if Hallowe&#39;en had ever been such a big deal when he was a kid.<br><br>Nearby, a little group - consisting of another Jedi Padawan, Rohirric-warrior-disguised Eowyn, and a mad scientist - were hovering. Cara Fielding had dispensed with the helmet for her costume, but the rest was accurate enough for her taste (except for the sword, which was tin-foil over wood). She was currently working on her daughter&#39;s hair; Stephanie had insisted on a tiny section being redone to mimic the traditional Padawan&#39;s braid. William Marshall occasionally fiddled with the collar of the bloodstained white labcoat he&#39;d been talked into and looked around the room with interest at the other costumes on show.</p>

            <p>Jumper smiled as he walked into the Nursery. He had received a message over his RC about a week ago about this HQ Trick-or-Treat, and had thought it was a brilliant idea. Give the kiddies a day for them to be kids and have candy, give the agents some time away from missions to help the children and have candy. How better to spend the near complete-multiversaly celebrated holiday? Sadly, his partner disagreed, calling the whole thing &quot;silly sweet stupidity,&quot; meaning he was alone in the chaperoning of children. Fine by him. Less candy he had to split.<br><br>Jumper stood in the doorway for a second or two, enjoying watching the children of assorted ages and species run around and play, all wearing the cutest little costumes. He sighed, then continued his way inside. &quot;Hello there!&quot; he called out to the first Nursery Worker he saw. &quot;I&#39;m here to get me and a little guy some candy!&quot;<br><br>((Alright, dump a child onto Jumper for him to guide. I do not care who it is.))</p>

            <p>The child was dressed in the iron armor of Skyrim (made of felt, so the child could actually walk), running around the room shouting, &quot;Fus Ro Dah!&quot; Despite the kitten&#39;s conviction, the shout seemed not to do anything.

I have a quest for you. Through these halls, Agents horde candy within their rooms. We are to infiltrate their RC&#39;s, and acquire as much candy as possible!&quot;<br><br>The child drew his sword, waving it in the air. &quot;M&#39;sien accepts the quest! This One will acq...aqu..get all of the candy!&quot;<br><br>Jumper rose, taking M&#39;sien by the hand. &quot;Well then, little Dragonborn. Let us be off on our quest.

And what do you say after getting candy?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tank you!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Excellent. Then let us go mingle with the others.&quot;<br><br>Aiden was two steps ahead of Xericka, having already made a cheerful beeline for Daenerys and her dragons.

            <p>The Official HQ Trick or Treat had been announced by console post for the last week. The whole thing was being coordinated through the Nursery: everyone taking kids out—their own or as a chaperone—was to meet up there first and check in.<br><br>The reception area of the Nursery was currently festooned with an explosion of arts and crafts, most of it with a motif of pumpkin-orange, cat-black, and bone-white, but there was the occasional spot of zombie-green and hellfire-red. It was generally agreed that none of the things depicted with the Crayolas, popsicle sticks, and paper plates were actually scary, of course, but Halloween wasn&#39;t about fear. It was about dressing up and panhandling for sugar.<br><br>There were already a wide array of costumes milling about, waiting for the okay to start. One knot of people was comprised of a silver-haired Mother of Dragons with a little green dragon holding one hand, a little white dragon holding the other, and a little black dragon pinned to one shoulder. There was also a blue Andalite with them, but he wasn&#39;t in costume. He just figured he&#39;d fit in best as himself.<br><br>Four-year-old Henry Robinson had insisted on being the green one—it was one of his favorite colors, and furthermore, he was a <i>Pern</i> dragon. He even had a little cloth doll for his rider.<br><br>The white dragon was Ian Thomas Horowitz, a pale-haired, pale-eyed boy a little older than Henry whom Agent Ilraen had rescued during one of his missions. Ian hadn&#39;t been formally adopted by anyone yet, but Ilraen took it upon himself to check in on the boy whenever he came to visit Henry, so he became part of the group.<br><br>Jenni Robinson, of course, was Daenerys Targaryen. Her wig itched and she was pretty sure everyone was looking at the Sue-tracking anklet the DIA had slapped on her after her recent unauthorized trans-continuum jaunt had come to light, but she smiled anyway. The kids were just too cute, and heck, this was going to be fun. Almost time now.<br><br>(( Sorry I took so long to post this. I had a serious attack of writer&#39;s block. &gt;.&lt; ))</p>

            <p>The door is decorated with a magical orange and black wreath flashing lights and a small scorpion knocker. When the kids knock on the door Marco (Agent West) will open the door and Halloween music will be playing (Standard halloween fare &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t fear the Reaper&quot; etc.) He is wearing black and orange hogwarts robes and gloves with the American flag on the right and jack-o-lantern on the left. A Night-Guant mini (fatu&#39;gun) then flies up and deposits a bag of candy containing some Muggle candy and Chocolate Frogs and some every flavor jelly beans into each trick or treaters bag. Agent Jameson (The Marshal) gives a half hearted wave and goes back to working on a new D&amp;D adventure and will state so if asked what he is doing.</p>

            <p>I have been informed I was laying it on a bit thick with my last post, though, so I&#39;m sorry if I made you feel bad about your role-playing. I don&#39;t personally have an issue with the characters&#39; personalities. The characters are another story, and I was just trying to fit in a reaction and some dialogue for all of mine. Re. characters speaking in the same paragraph and such, I thought it would be more entertaining (or at least less serious-scolding-like) to have Jenni point it out in-character than for me to tell you OOC. IC, everyone&#39;s about ready to let their hackles down and make up now. Jenni can actually empathize with Marco, since her backstory is pretty similar. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So, as I said in a post to Herr just now, there&#39;s a bit of timeline you guys might want to incorporate into dealings with my characters, particularly Nume. February 2013 was Nume&#39;s ten-year anniversary as an agent, and there was a surprise (read: ambush) party for him in the Cafeteria, courtesy of the combined force for Making Nume Do Stuff that is Jenni and Ilraen. I just haven&#39;t completely written it up yet. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>If your agents were around in February of this year and you want to say they were there and know who my guys are because of it, please do!

            <p>Would Jumper be open to chaperoning a disguised(as much as that word can be used when everyone is wearing costumes) Agent, possibly in exchange for a share of the candy? I was planning an RC scene with two of my agents-to-be when I realized that it would be far more in-character for one of the two to venture out on his own to do some trick-or-treating in person(He <i>is</i> short enough to wear the larger child-sized costumes, for the record, so it&#39;s not going to be horribly out-of-place on him. Just mildly out-of-place.), and I think it would be, among other things, amusing to see how the other Agents might react.<br><br>If you don&#39;t want to go along with his harebrained scheme, there&#39;s a pegasus pony named Aurora Dawn(<a href="http://kittynoodles.dreamwidth.org/572.html">formerly of Rainbow Factory</a>) that no one&#39;s adopted yet. You could chaperone her, possibly along with the rescued-from-the-same-story Orion Solstice(though he&#39;s been adopted already by one of KittyNoodles&#39;s agents, so you might need her okay if you want to include him), and your knowledge of the MLP continuum can allow you to approximate their likely costume choices.</p>

            <p>So they only teleport peoples&#39; skeletons, or it&#39;s a type of teleportation that only works on skeletons, or something else based on a different word basis for &quot;skele&quot; or &quot;portation&quot;? If it&#39;s the first, that would be an incredibly effective attack against enemy wizards. They&#39;d be preparing for one of their spells, and then all of a sudden, BAM! Organs spilling around in the ribcage, legs collapsing into puddles of goo, and on the whole, completely incapacitated. Only an incredibly brutal-minded wizard would probably plan ahead to do that to a living being, though. It would more likely be a last thrashing-out in desperation.<br><br>Wow, only one sentence before a direct question turned into off-topic rambling. That&#39;s a new personal best.</p>

            <p>Before I say anything further, let me say good luck to those of you who are participating in NaNoWriMo.<br><br>Now on a slightly related topic, I have a series of writing-related questions. As all of us PPCers know (especially those with agents), description can be difficult. That is <i>especailly</i> so when dealing with an anime character, as anime is notorious for complex designs. So, I&#39;d like to ask your help in answering some questions. Lest I bore you with a wall of text, I&#39;ll put my questions as sub-posts.</p>

            <p>Here is my other question. As anyone who has watched Bakugan can tell you, <a href="http://bakugan.wikia.com/wiki/File:Bakugan_new_vestroia_episode_1_part1-Invasion_of_the_Vestals_0009.jpg">the Vexos</a> are very conspicuous when walking around Earth in their usual outfits. So I&#39;ll be having Volt put on some more normal-looking garb not too far into my fic.<br><br><a href="http://superwinx8.deviantart.com/art/Volt-Luster-the-AngelHedgehog-189671307">This drawing from DeviantArt</a> is a possible idea of what I might have him wear. (Yes, the character is a hedgehog. Ignore it; the clothes are my focus.)<br><br>How would you describe the upper-body clothing? (I&#39;m leaving everything below the belt unchanged from his Vexos uniform.)<br><br>Also, if anyone has any different suggestions, please let me hear it. However, note that I want to have Volt keep that white/gold/black color scheme that he has--just with more normal-looking clothes.<br><br>Thanks loads!</p>

            <p>As you should all know by now, I am working on a Bakugan/Pokemon crossover. Thus far, my main character is Volt Luster, a Bakugan canon.<br><a href="http://bakugan.wikia.com/wiki/Volt_Luster/Image_Gallery?file=2011-07-22_1206.png">Here</a> is a picture of him (he&#39;s the man standing with his arms crossed).<br>A different picture can be found <a href="http://images.wikia.com/bakugan/images/6/68/Volt_sent_to_doomdimension.JPG">here</a>.<br><br>Below is an excerpt of the part of my story where I describe him:<br><i> [Nurse Joy said], “Kaiser called ahead and said that ‘a peach-haired musclehead with weird clothin’ called “Volt Luster”’ would be coming here .... And you certainly fit that description.”<br><br>“Weird” certainly described Volt’s garb; it was by no means common to Kanto. Draped over Volt’s shoulders was a collared white cloak with orange highlights. Yellow fur lined the inside of the collar. Underneath the cloak was what seemed to be a black T-shirt with a neckline that started under the collarbone, with a gold zipper up the middle. The shirt extended past the waist, where there was a wide brown belt with a silver pentagon-shaped buckle. Extending under the shirt, and presumably held up by the belt, was a long piece of white cloth that wrapped behind Volt’s legs. The best description of the cloth that the woman could muster was an open-fronted kilt with no pleats. The same yellow-fur lining from the collar of Volt’s cloak lined the opening and the hem of the kilt as well. Had the woman not noticed that the cloak only extended towards the waist, she would have thought that the cloak and kilt were one long trenchcoat. Perhaps the illusion was deliberate; so similar were the two pieces of clothing in design. Underneath the kilt was a pair of black pants. On Volt’s feet were white boots, each with a zipper up the middle and two parallel yellow stripes running around the sides and back of the cuff.</i><br><br>Is that an adequate description of him? If it can/should be improved, how?<br><br>And please don&#39;t forget to check out the other post. Thanks!</p>

            <p>While it&#39;s certainly important to put a clear image in your readers&#39; heads, a fanfic isn&#39;t anime, so some of the visual details are going to be lost no matter what. I kinda feel like putting so much emphasis on the outfit will only slow down the story. If I&#39;m working on putting all the details together to figure out what his outfit looks like, I&#39;m not getting immersed in what&#39;s actually going on in the scene. Exactly what he&#39;s wearing isn&#39;t as important as the impression it gives off when combined with his body language.<br><br>Plus, would Nurse Joy really take the time to study him in that much detail right then? Staring is rude. Also, is he the type to stand still and let her, or is he a &quot;get to the point&quot; kinda guy? He looks like one in the pictures.<br><br>It makes sense that the eye would be drawn to something out of the ordinary, but it seems to me that the weirdest thing about his clothing is that he&#39;s not actually wearing a cloak or long coat, but a short cape and what I&#39;d call a butt-cape. If there&#39;s a better term, I don&#39;t know it; but it doesn&#39;t put me in mind of a kilt at all. It&#39;s too long, and pleats in back and a sporran in front are what make a kilt a kilt and not a skirt.<br><br>Anyway, since the two pieces together look so much like a heavy cloak/long coat, would Nurse Joy even notice that they aren&#39;t if he were just standing in front of her, or would she be more likely to pick up on that when he moves? You could give a basic sketch of the outfit when she first sees him, then add in the details as they become more apparent or actually important, whichever comes first. You don&#39;t have to put it in all at once.<br><br>That&#39;s kind of a ramble, but I hope it makes sense and helps some.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I did some work on the descriptions, and I think I got it better this time. Below is a longer excerpt from my manuscript, which includes the description sections. What do you think of it, Neshomeh?<br><br>--<br><br><i><br>When Volt arrived in Fuchsia City, he immediately started feeling like he was attracting too much attention. Passersby, noticing Volt’s unusual clothing, started muttering amongst themselves:<br><br>“Who is that man?”<br><br>“Maybe he’s an actor? But isn’t Schpielbunk in Virbank City this year?”<br><br>“Is he a Trainer for Koga’s Gym?”<br><br>“Impossible: that doesn’t look like a ninja outfit at all. Maybe he’s a Coordinator.”<br><br>“</i>That’s<i> what they call artsy nowadays?”<br><br>“Mommy, that man looks funny!”<br><br>“It’s not polite to point, honey.”<br><br>Fortunately for Volt, he did not have to add to his embarrassment by asking for directions, as after walking straight ahead for a few blocks, he saw the building Kaiser described, located right in the middle of the street. <br><br>Entering the Pokémon Center doors, Volt saw a reception desk, behind which stood a pink-haired woman wearing a pink dress under a white apron. On her head was a hat with a blue cross on the front. Standing beside her was a Chansey, which was wearing the same type of hat as the human it was accompanying.<br><br>“Good morning, ma’am,” Volt said. Looking around at the nearly-empty building, he asked, “Did, uh, someone come here looking for me?”<br><br>“Not that I remember, no,” the woman replied. “Are you supposed to be meeting someone here?”<br><br>“I was supposed to be meeting someone who works for Professor Oak.”<br><br>A look of realization came upon the woman’s face. “So you must be Volt Luster!”<br><br>“How did you know my name?” Volt asked.<br><br>She replied, “Kaiser called ahead and said that ‘a peach-haired musclehead with weird clothin’ called “Volt Luster”’ would be coming here to meet an aide of Professor Oak. And you certainly fit that description.”<br><br>“Weird” certainly described Volt’s garb; it was by no means common to Kanto. Draped over Volt’s shoulders was a collared white cape with orange highlights. Yellow fur lined the inside of the collar. When Volt walked in, the woman thought that he was wearing a long cloak, but given a closer look, she saw that the “cloak” was actually two capes, one draped around his shoulders, and another presumably extending from the waist. Underneath the upper cape was what seemed to be a black T-shirt with a neckline that started under the collarbone, with a gold zipper up the middle. The shirt extended past the waist, where there was a wide brown belt with a silver pentagon-shaped buckle.<br><br>“Well, since you know apparently know </i>my<i> name already, what is yours?” Volt asked.<br><br>“You can call me Nurse Joy; everyone does,” the woman replied. <br><br>Volt noticed a picture on the wall behind Nurse Joy. The picture showed a multitude of women, all wearing the same outfit, and all looking exactly like the nurse.<br><br>“What is that picture back there?” asked Volt.<br><br>“Oh, that?” Nurse Joy replied. “That’s just a picture from our latest family reunion. It was a pretty small one, though; only the Joys from Kanto showed up.”<br><br></i>What? There are identical copies of this same woman all over Kanto?<i> Volt thought. </i>Even <i>Vestal</i> doesn’t have cloning technology!<i><br><br>“It was not that we didn’t try to invite other Joys, you know. I remember sending out invites to my second cousin once removed in Nimbasa City and to my third cousin in Castelia City,” Nurse Joy continued. “They also look like me, by the way.”<br><br></i>What?!<i> “That’s quite an … interesting family you have there,” Volt said.<br><br></i>Okay, so we’re not dealing with clones. Either this family has some weird genetics or some pretty exacting aesthetic standards. Whatever it is, I don’t want to know, and I hopefully won’t be on this planet long enough to find out.<br><br>--<br><br>I moved the description of the rest of his garb to another part of the story, since it will remain unchanged when he changes into more Kanto-style clothing.</p>

            <p>First, I think you&#39;re missing out on a great opportunity to slip in some details with the bit leading up to Volt entering the Pokémon Center. You&#39;ve got people staring and making comments about his appearance already, so have a few of them get a little more specific.<br><br>&quot;Impossible. Ninjas don&#39;t wear X.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mommy, why is that man wearing a cape on his butt?&quot; (Yes, I&#39;m still hung up on that. No, I&#39;m not seriously advocating the use of this line. &gt;.&gt; )<br><br>As for the paragraph itself, I think it&#39;s definitely better this time, but it&#39;s a bit redundant in that you&#39;ve got the top cape described twice. Also, the rest of the passage is from Volt&#39;s POV, so it&#39;s a little jarring to suddenly be in Nurse Joy&#39;s head for the description. I&#39;d rewrite it like this:<br><br><i>“Weird” certainly described Volt’s garb; it was by no means common to Kanto. At first glance, he seemed to be wearing a long cloak, but the “cloak” was actually two capes, one draped around his shoulders, and another extending from the waist. Both parts were white with yellow fur lining, and the upper cape was collared and decorated with gold trim. Underneath he wore a black shirt with a low neckline and a gold zipper up the middle. The shirt extended past the waist, where there was a wide brown belt with a silver pentagon-shaped buckle.</i><br><br>I might even move this paragraph up to before the paragraph starting &quot;Fortunately for Volt, ...&quot;. That way it doesn&#39;t interrupt the dialogue between Volt and Joy.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>As I&#39;ve mentioned, this is my first fanfic, and I&#39;d appreciate all the help I can get. I see that I&#39;d have to cut down on the description or else move it elsewhere.<br><br>(Quick background: I originally had the description scene be from Tracey Sketchit&#39;s point of view.

You can tell that the implications are not something that I&#39;d want to wade into.)<br><br>Please don&#39;t forget the other questions: When you think of &quot;Volt Luster, Pokemon Trainer,&quot; what kind of outfit do you have in mind?</p>

            <p>&#39;Volt Luster, Pokemon Trainer&#39; is very clearly a Lt. Surge fangirl/boy. I&#39;m picturing cosplay and a very bad American accent.

            <p>When I think &quot;Pokémon Trainer&quot; I pretty much just think of Ash from the cartoon, and nobody likes him. I don&#39;t know much about the broader Pokémon universe, and nothing at all about the fashions of Kanto.<br><br>As for &quot;Volt Luster,&quot; I think of a lecherous and possibly shiny lightning bolt. I figure it can wear whatever it wants as long as it&#39;s not trying to chat me up. &gt;.<br>I will make an attempt to say something helpful, though. A normal kind of animal trainer can wear pretty much anything they want, I think, if the animal isn&#39;t dangerous. If you&#39;re dealing with something that has claws and teeth, though, maybe you want a thick leather jacket or something for protection. If it&#39;s a bird of prey, there&#39;s a glove for that. If it&#39;s poisonous, make sure it can&#39;t bite/sting/spray you. Et cetera.<br><br>~Neshomeh, of a practical bent.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure whether or not to give it to DMS or DAVD. DawnFire and I are thinking it lies more towards the DAVD side of the spectrum because it involves rape and what looks like domestic abuse, but I&#39;d like another opinion before we decide which agents to send into it.<br><br>Here, have a link: <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/1029171"><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/1029171">http://archiveofourown.org/works/1029171</a></a><br>(waring: NSFW, TW: rape, abuse, sexism)<br><br>The fic is called &quot;for the best&quot;, it&#39;s set in Star Trek AOS with female Jim getting raped when she&#39;s 15 by Spock and kidnapped back to Vulcan because Amanda Grayson brings him to Winona Kirk&#39;s house for the sole purpose of bonding his son to her daughter. Fem!Jim then spends her days on Vulcan being a perfect housewife while knitting and drawing abstract paintings and being hurt during sex with Spock, who by the way is attending the Vulcan Science Academy.<br>It ends with Jim running off with Dr McCoy after the kal-if-fee, since she has championed him. The violence isn&#39;t horrifically gory, but the rapes are told in detail, and condoned in the most disgusting way, and there&#39;s sexism everywhere and ugh.<br><br>Dawn and I want to burn this thing but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s awful enough for DAVD. I personally think it is, but yeah. I need another opinion.<br></p>

Going along with that, have you seen Buon San Valentino? It&#39;s an extra episode. (I&#39;m just scribing here, I have not seen it nor do I plan to.)<br><br>5.

<li>England, Prussia, Russia, France, America, Japan, Germany... anyone can be lusted after, practically everyone is. I&#39;m not entirely sure on the rankings; there&#39;s too many students to find a coherent one, haha.<br><br>2. England. Bias is showing, I know. Jennifer Chang is basically me, actually.<br><br>3. I ship Asakiku, which is England/Japan, and I ship a bit of FrUK and USUK too (it doesn&#39;t help that now that I&#39;m into Star Trek all I see is Spones, Gaila/McCoy, and McKirk in those ships and I&#39;m laughing). I think fans ship a lot because of international relations and alliances and treaties and stuff, and also because, say, if they&#39;re American and fancy British people, they&#39;ll be more likely to ship USUK.<br><br>4. I&#39;ve seen a bit of Buon San Valentino and I think GerIta is fairly canonical given that Chibitalia/HRE is canonical.<br><br>5. I&#39;ve done a bit of England, but two of my friends from high school are more into the cosplay thing than I am.</li>

            <p>basically Amanda Grayson&#39;s either possessed or replaced, Spock is definitely replaced, and Jim&#39;s a Sue. Which is why, if it&#39;s not going to DAVD, it&#39;d go to DMS instead.</p>

            <p>Not disagreeing about the general quality of the fic or the appropriateness of a PPC response, but I don&#39;t get &quot;Sue&quot; from Jamie there. I don&#39;t think the story is about putting her forward. I&#39;m not sure what it <i>is</i> about... just fulfilling the kink request in the ickiest way possible, I guess. *gag* But it&#39;s certainly not for Jamie&#39;s benefit. Also, she doesn&#39;t get that much characterization, but what there is is at least consistent, without the dissonance that comes from a narrative trying to tell us how awesome/important/sympathetic she is without backing it up with actions.<br><br>She could well be a replacement, though.

            <p>Hello everyone. I am Fasoula, hitherto known as Matthew72. As of the end of this month, I will have been involved in this community for approximately two years, if memory serves. But, save for a comfortably me-shaped hole worn into a lonely corner of the IRC, I have made very minimal contribution, or even interaction, with the community at large. Whether it be for fear of expressing my own opinions and thoughts (or more frighteningly, revealing a lack thereof and making a fool of myself) or simply shyness, I&#39;ve been mostly content with sitting back and watching the opportunities to do awesome things with the awesome people of this community slip by.<br><br>I decided that this, quite simply, has to stop. So, I am going to subdue my inhibitions for a moment and introduce myself again, to both the people who know (of) me and those who don&#39;t yet. I will also subdue them for many moments afterward so I do not make the same mistake again.<br><br>Hello, I&#39;m Fasoula! It&#39;s a pleasure to meet everyone! I am a casual-ish gamer who loves bullet hell, platformers, Pokemon and RPGs à la Kingdom Hearts or Mario and Luigi. I am also a freshman in community college, who recently gained immediate access to a library much larger than any library I&#39;ve ever had immediate access to, which, along with the <i>beautiful</i> amounts of free time between classes, suddenly reawakened a love for reading. This love is only exceeded by my ineptitude in finding things I actually want to read and therefore I would appreciate hearing about more books to keep an eye out for. So, please feel free to suggest any of your favorites to me! If it&#39;s any help, some of my favorite books are Duma Key and Skulduggery Pleasant (though, I&#39;ve only been able to get my hands on the first two installments). I am currently reading the Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy &quot;trilogy&quot;.<br><br>Anyways, this post has gone on for long enough, I think. So, I&#39;ll just wrap it up with this. I hope that I can get to know you all better than I have in the past, good luck to those participating in NaNoWriMo, and good night to all (except to those of you to whom it is not night, then good morning/afternoon/evening to you)!<br><br>~Fasoula, who could not think of a better subject to put this under.</p>

            <p>DawnFire and I have been talking about our hopefully-forthcoming SPN OFU, and we&#39;ve begun to think up ways to treat the &#39;Sues like monsters in the SPN verse. So far, we&#39;ve decided that lines from high literature can be fashioned into something similar to a Devil&#39;s Trap, and that quoting such at the &#39;Sues will &quot;burn&quot; them. However, one must be careful in choosing what to quote, for 50 Shades, Twilight, or any sort of &#39;Sue-ruled book will actually make a &#39;Sue stronger!<br><br>With that in mind, we thought we&#39;d ask the good people of the PPC for their suggestions. What sort of SPN-suitable weaknesses should we give &#39;Sues?</p>

            <p>Bad SuperWhoLock (aka the large majority) makes me want to bash my head against the nearest solid object, preferably multiple times. Or drink several bottles of Bleeprin. Or attack it with a flamethrower. All of the above works too. It takes a lot of finesse to do something that implausible (Sherlock Holmes explicitly does not exist in <i>Doctor Who</i>, for a start) well, and, as we all know, that sort of finesse in unfortunately rather rare, especially in fanwriters.<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>The logic thing actually could work but you run the risk of angering them. Though on that note it might actually anger them so much that it reveals their true nature and therefore make them killable by normal means. Also there is the old canon way of getting rid of ghosts use salt (this is actually linked to real world lore as salt is beilved to disrput the etheral plane spirts reside on sea salt or kosher salt is best.) I&#39;m also thinking maybe the radio from a &#39;69 impala blaring 80&#39;s rock might actually act as a ward since it isn&#39;t music you can do a songfic to or your basic suewriter would even listen to.

            <p>&#39;PPC emergency&#39; is an ill-defined term at best, since it basically depends on why it&#39;s being used. Pejoratively, &#39;emergency&#39; can mean anything up to &#39;I don&#39;t think you should do this so I&#39;ll say it&#39;s an emergency because moratorium&#39;. Originally (and I think the term was my fault), it meant &#39;anything I want to put on the Catastrophe Theory chart to prove that the PPC would explode in&#39;... I think it was 2012, actually. ;) So the &#39;Tangled Webs fiasco&#39; is on there (a large IC mission which the rest of the PPC ignored), as is the Assimilation Crisis (about a dozen agents involved in that one)... but so is the Crashing Down invasion.<br><br>If I was making the graph again, I&#39;d probably <i>include</i> the Great Genderbend, as well as the Door to the Future RP - because they&#39;re moderately big events, and because Dafydd and Constance would be very upset to hear the Genderbend was &#39;fun&#39;.<br><br>Basically, this answer boils down to: is Pluto a planet? If so, so is Ceres. Is the Genderbend an Emergency? If so, so is your idea.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: The thing about capital-E Emergencies is that they can be kind of cool - if they a) don&#39;t impact absolutely everyone (so people can opt out of it having happened to their agents) and b) don&#39;t make permanent changes to things anyone cares about (Hi, Makes-Things!). Oh, and c), <i>aren&#39;t all role-plays</i>.<br><br>My point here is, if (say) someone wants to write about, or even just mention in passing, the time the Department of Out-Of-Character Hobbits were possessed en-masse by robot ghosts and had to be forcibly restrained by a coalition of DAVD and DIAU agents before they could reach the DoDAEG and steal Tolkien&#39;s shoes (or whatever) - brilliant! That&#39;s clearly an Emergency (the shoes must be preserved!), but it also doesn&#39;t impact anyone who doesn&#39;t want it to.<br><br>But if that was made into an RP, you&#39;d have the inevitable person who takes their possessed DOOCH agent into the air shafts and drops a bomb into the cafeteria, and then someone would write an announcement by the SO that the department was shut down, and it would all be Big Seriousness, and everyone would have to acknowledge it or get out of sync with the rest of the PPC (which we all know is an awful crime which must be punished by public mockery) - and that would be the sort of thing we put a moratorium on.<br><br>... my post-script is longer than my script, isn&#39;t it? I don&#39;t even know where I was going with it any more...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It was an emergency (massive power, shields and portal failure,), but it didn&#39;t change anything in &quot;canon&quot; and everyone not interested in taking part can just ignore it (by either claiming that their Agents were on a mission during all the Blackout timespan or that they just decided to take advantage of the disruption to get some hours of good sleep. Or simply skipping it entirely in their spinoff)<br><br>In fact, my next big project, Blank Sprite, can be considered an emergency - however, it affects direcly very few characers (only my Agents PPC-wise) to the point that the whole PPC is pretty much unaware that such a thing ever happened.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think it would be an emergency.  It seems like the kind of thing one could easily opt out of.  One reason the Emergencies were so problematic was the fact that they were so very to ignore.  It would be a temporary thing, and probably would not threaten to destroy the PPC or Multiverse.  So, thinking about it more as a Genderbending incident seems about right, to me.<br><br>Some questions you will want to answer, for yourself, before/if this happens are:<br><br>1) What is the mechanism of the change?  (A Breaking Bad fic I saw recently used magical pot to turn a character into a child...I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.)<br><br>2) Why does it change them into the food they eat most often?  Why not a random food?  Why not cats?<br><br>3) Why would it affect Agents in other worlds (on missions, for example)?<br><br>Just some things to think about.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>For the last week, I have been reading (what may be the worst fanfic of all time) <i>My Immortal</i>. For any of you wondering why I wanted to kill a few billion brain cells, I have never read this badfic, and was wondering if it was truly as bad as people said it was. After a bit of research on TVTropes (where the insert of the badfic killed a couple million brain cells) I decided to hear a dramatic reading, because that is my preferred method in reading a badfic. (It makes it more understandable/interesting.) As I was hearing TehPogo&#39;s dramatic reading (text included) and listing to the (500th) clothing description, I came across the following sentence:<br>&quot;Meanwhile, I pot on a blak ledder mini, a blak corset with <b>urple</b> lace stuff all over it, an black gothic compact boots.&quot;<br>Now, I bet this is just a misspelling of &quot;purple.&quot; <del>The sues are relentless, I see.</del><br>Just food for thought.</p>

            <p>But as I recall (from what, I&#39;m not sure - possibly discussions here on the Board), the first few Sue colours - urple, wilver, and maybe blello - were created by actual typos found in stories, just like mini-Balrogs.<br><br>So when was <i>My Immortal</i> written?

            <p>That would be cool, and the part about Bilbo possibly not knowing what he was seeing actually makes logical sense for explaining how it could be so despite what the book says.<br><br>But no, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really the case in the books or the movies. If I remember correctly, Tolkien explains somewhere (<i>The Silmarillion</i>, <i>Unfinished Tales</i>, something like that) that Dwarf women number much fewer than Dwarf men and the reproduction rate is fairly low, so they typically don&#39;t venture out into the world because they&#39;re just too valuable to risk losing. I suppose you might occasionally see one traveling to find a husband she&#39;s not related to, but you&#39;d more likely just see the heavily armed troop of Dwarf men around her.<br><br>As for the movies, I seem to recall some shirtless shots of Fili and/or Kili at some point. Pretty sure they&#39;re dudes. I think PJ is more interested in marketing than promoting women in Middle-earth. If you&#39;re looking for a director who actually cares about strong female characters, you want Joss Whedon.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>They may not. If a woman works out enough, and I think it&#39;s safe to say Dwarf women would, her bosom tends to be not as obvious.

            <p>... then we really need to reevaluate our ideas about dwarvish biology.<br><br>Think about it: the guy&#39;s a blacksmith. The Valar were actually involved in biological creation (Arda was completely empty when they came down), but I don&#39;t think he was. So when Aule decided to make himself some kids - do we really think he would have thought to put in <i>hormones</i>? I mean, we know he never asked his wife for advice about it.<br><br>So: dwarves are made by a guy who mostly deals in rocks. Maybe they&#39;re basically <i>made</i> of stone. That explains the idea that they revert to stone when they die (not conclusively disproven). It may also explain their lust for gold and gems, if they actually need them as trace minerals - simple handling could let them be absorbed through the skin.<br><br>Now, dwarves do eat, which could be used to argue against this - but so do furnaces! Organic material goes in, energy, in the form of heat, comes out. With an efficient enough furnace - exactly the sort of thing Aule was good with - any &#39;food&#39; would be a viable fuel source. (And if you like the idea that they drink a lot - alcohol? Biofuel? Yes please!)<br><br>Then we have the encounters of the dwarves with dragons... in the Wars of the Jewels, the dwarves were the only ones able to stand up to Glaurung&#39;s fire. Is it the masks they made, or is it that they&#39;re simply heatproof? Yes, they keep being driven out of places by creatures of fire - Durin&#39;s Bane, Smaug - but we don&#39;t actually have proof that any were <i>killed</i> by those creatures. (Possible exception - the Durin who was bane&#39;d. But the Durins have always been a bit weird, with their possible-reincarnation thing)<br><br>What else, what else... well, obviously they can be harmed by weapons, we&#39;ve seen that over and over, but I never said they were made of <i>tough</i> rocks. I&#39;m thinking maybe sandstone, with a colloidal gold suspension (noted for its vivid red colour) as &#39;blood&#39;. That gold content goes back to the skin-absorption theory. It would be used mostly for heat transfer from the furnace, I imagine.<br><br>By this system, dwarf &#39;pregnancy&#39; may actually be an incredibly involved process - it could resemble the animal method only in appearance. That would explain why female dwarves don&#39;t get out much - they&#39;re busy spending ten years on internal baby construction!<br><br>... that&#39;s a terrible thought, actually.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Initial point to make: while the theory that Fili &amp; Kili are female obviously has no grounding in the canon text, there&#39;s no reason it can&#39;t be true in the movies. And so:<br><br>First rebuttal rebuttal: The fact that there are no known female characters in <i>The Hobbit</i> doesn&#39;t mean F&amp;K can&#39;t be women. Nor does it mean they are. This one&#39;s sort of a non-point either way. The only real argument is that Tolkien didn&#39;t really have many women in his stories at all, and those that do go adventuring... wait.<br><br>Those that do go adventuring tend to do it in disguise. We have Luthien (who dressed up as a vampire, and in a nightcloak), and, notably, we have Eowyn, who...<br><br>... wait for it...<br><br>... disguised herself as a man. ;) That&#39;s relevant, right here.<br><br>Second rebuttal rebuttal: The best way to look at &#39;sounds different&#39;, I think, is the vowels. Khuzdul <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/khuzdul.htm">is known</a> to use consonant-based roots, and to change the vowels around to inflect them. That means male and female names could very well just differ by their vowels.<br><br>Among the other eleven dwarves (Thorin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori, Nori, Ori, Balin, Dwalin, Oin, Gloin), we see:<br>-Two instances of &#39;a&#39;<br>-No(!!!) instances of &#39;e&#39;<br>-Nine instances of &#39;i&#39;<br>-Eight instances of &#39;o&#39;<br>-Three instance of &#39;u&#39;<br><br>Additionally, every &#39;i&#39; is paired with another vowel - often an &#39;o&#39; or &#39;u&#39;, but twice (Balin &amp; Dwalin) an &#39;a&#39;. Fili and Kili, of course, have only &#39;i&#39;s, which is definitely different (there are no other instances of the same vowel being used twice in a name).<br><br>Of course, all the dwarf names except Balin come from the same Norse source, so there&#39;s that.<br><br>(And on the flip side - the only attested Tolkien female dwarf is called &#39;Dis&#39; - not the &#39;i&#39; again)<br><br>Third rebuttal rebuttal: You&#39;re both wrong. ;) Fili and Kili are definitely younger than the rest of the Company - it&#39;s in the appendices - but that&#39;s irrelevant. By their age, dwarves have reached their adult appearance, and they basically don&#39;t change until they hit their mid-200s. So any &#39;younger-looking-ness&#39; - which I don&#39;t recall actually being mentioned in <i>The Hobbit</i> - would simply be how they look.<br><br>Fourth rebuttal rebuttal: This is a quirky little subject. Tolkien did (obliquely) state that female dwarves are bearded - it&#39;s in Appendix A, as &#39;They are in voice and appearance... so like to the dwarf-men that the eyes and ears of other peoples cannot tell them apart&#39; - but it&#39;s nowhere in the main stories. My suspicion is that D&amp;D and its ilk are responsible for this idea making it into the public mindset, which is where PTerry got it - and I suspect they probably didn&#39;t realise it was in Tolkien.<br><br>The beard-braiding you mention isn&#39;t mentioned anywhere in Tolkien, and is highly controversial in Pratchett - to the point where several books revolve around the question of whether female dwarves should outwardly portray themselves as female. Of course (countering your final point) all Discworld dwarfs (traditionally) are referred to as &#39;he&#39;...<br><br>In summary: there is no real justification for assuming that book!Fili&amp;Kili are female, though there are facts which could be used to at least claim it isn&#39;t utterly ridiculous. However, given the tweaking performed by Jackson, and his tendency to draw from D&amp;D-inspired stereotypes (such as drunken Gimli), there is no reason they <i>couldn&#39;t</i> be in the films - or a fanfic of them.<br><br>Oh, except one: there were a couple of female dwarves in the opening of the first film. I don&#39;t remember them having beards. ;)<br><br>hS<br><br>&quot;...no Man nor Elf has ever seen a beardless Dwarf - unless he were shaven in mockery, and would then be more like to die of shame... For the Naugrim have beards from the beginning of their lives, male and female alike...&quot; ~JRRT</p>

            <p>If there&#39;s an attractive male character in a movie, book, or any medium, there will be fangirls.  And in the movie, Thorin Oakenshield is attractive.  I am pretty sure that if they made any of the other Dwarves attractive, there would clouds of goofy teen-age and twenty-something women drooling over them.  <br><br></p>

            <p>I have to say, there was so little noticeable change between the original tracks and the nightcore remixes, I couldn&#39;t tell the difference until my second listen-through.  A more interesting idea might have been juxtaposing some of the songs or background music from the actual cartoon, then doing a badfic-inspired fan song that related to the original song&#39;s theme.  That would give a better impression of how the bleepfics twisted and perverted aspects of the original canon.<br><br>(In fact, anyone want to try that for other fandoms?  Or fandom in general?)</p>

            <p>A description of myself? Sure, I could make one.<br><br>Once upon a time, I was an ACMSES writer, and a rather iffy one at that. One day, I realized that my character was a hypocrite (a Sue waging war against its own kind) and decided to quit. A few years of soul-searching, practice and SCIENCE! later, I stumble to your side of the multiverse, and decided to start anew.<br><br>As for my fandoms I&#39;m more of an anime fanbrat with a thing for mecha, CARD GAMES (BIKES NOT NECESSARY) and mind screw, specifically: Code Geass, Gundam (Wing, Seed, 00) and YGO (GX and 5Ds), but my focus is more on the weird symbolisms and plot (or lack thereof) than the mecha fights/card games/what-have-you. I&#39;m also into Sherlock Holmes and Hetalia.<br><br>I&#39;m very picky with what I read, but I tend to ignore the pairings if the story is brilliant enough. My friend calls me Machiavellian in that regard. (See those fandoms above? They&#39;re <i>bad slash hell</i>. It&#39;s something I have to learn to survive back there.)<br><br>My more obscure obsessions: <br> - Kino&#39;s Journey<br> - Mushishi<br> - Isaac Asimov<br> - Arthur Clarke<br> - A buttload of SF writers<br> - Books in general<br> - Cake. Black Forest Cake. Mm...<br><br>...Was that too much? Thanks for the mech though. Twas awesome.<br></p>

            <p>Whenever we discuss fanfics, we usually talk about the awful. Occasionally, we praise the good. Once or twice, we comment on just mediocre fics. However, there is one type of fic we almost never discuss: the debated ones. The ones that the entire readership just cannot decide if this is one of the best fanfics ever written, or a trainwreck of a fanfic that is full of clichés and Mary Sues/Gary Stus. Half of the fandom praises it for its phenomenal characters, while the other half wants to see the main character on top of a spear. <br><br>Note that I am not talking about the traditional Mary Sue fics and their legions of Sue lovers: I speak of those fics that cause two people who have a relatively similar mindset about what makes a good or bad story find themselves in a <s>screaming match</s> heated debate over the quality of the fic. Seeing as this community is built around mocking what we have agreed to be badfic, as well as writing and analysis, why don&#39;t we try and settle it once and for all! <br><br>Here is what you are to do. To enter a fic in to be debated, respond to this post with the name of the fic to be debated, and a link to the story, nothing else. I will provide one to start with, though anybody can add fics to debate as they see fit. To start the debate/analysis, respond to the fic you wish to analyze and head it with something like, &quot;This is goodfic,&quot; or &quot;This is badfic.&quot; You may phrase it how you wish, though please make it clear which side you are on in the heading. From there, respond to each other, make counterpoints, agree, disagree, whatever.<br><br>Some rules:<br><b> 1. No insulting fellow boarders or authors.</b> This is part of Da Rules, and is good advice anyway, but I want to make it clear now.<br><br><b> 2. This is not to decide if the fic is bad enough to mission!</b> The point of this is to decide what is good and what is bad, and to have fun reviewing fics. We try to only mission near-universally-hated badfic. If there is enough contention in the fandom in the first place to make it debatable, it probably should not be missioned.<br><br><b> 3. Have depth to your arguments.</b> It does not help anyone to just say, &quot;This fic is good because I like it.&quot; It helps even less to say, &quot;This fic is bad because the main character is a Mary Sue.&quot; Why is the fic good? Why is the character a Mary Sue? We have to charge the Sues for a reason. Just explain yourself to the best of your ability, and we should have no problems.<br><br>Finally, have fun! Analysis and debate is entertaining (at least for me), so don&#39;t ruin it for everybody by taking it far too seriously. If you find yourself becoming mad, just step back, breath, and come back to it later.<br><br>Alright everybody! Get ready... Set... Debate!</p>

            <p>Some evil ponies try to resurrect Nightmare Moon independent of Luna, but the spell gets interrupted so instead she&#39;s reborn as a little filly. It&#39;s basically a story about how people shouldn&#39;t be held responsible for sins they themselves didn&#39;t commit, even if they&#39;re related to those sins in some way.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s really good, but I didn&#39;t think it was too bad either. Lot of wasted potential, but at least it reached for that potential and failed rather than just being the same old shipping stories and whatnot that get told time and time again.<br><br>Unfortunately it&#39;s been ages since I read it, so I can&#39;t contribute anything beyond vague memories to this thread. </p>

            <p>This fic is what inspired me to do this whole thing. It is one of the most beloved and hated fics in the entire brony fandom. <br><br>On one side, many readers see it as one of the most well crafted stories they have seen from fanfiction. The progression of Nyx&#39;s character arch (Nyx is filly Nightmare Moon) is deep, and one of the most detailed progressions not only in Fanfiction, but in literature. Also, Nyx is just too adorable in her widdle gwasses, and vest, and just LOOK AT HER:<br><br><img src="http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120128122624/mlpfanart/images/1/10/Disguised_Nyx_by_AibotNya.png" alt="Nyx" height='194"' width="194"><br><br>DAWW!<br><img src="http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120128122624/mlpfanart/images/3/3e/Undisguised_Nyx_by_AibotNya.png" alt="Nyx 2" height='194"' width="194"><br><br>DOUBLE DAWW!!<br><br>On the other side, many readers see Nyx as a Mary Sue. The fact that she is Nightmare Moon as a filly, that she has Twilight be her caretaker, that the only ponies who dislike her (as a filly) are Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon, and that she drives just about everypony OOC by her mere presence are just some of the usual accusations. Add to it that several characters carry the idiot ball for most of the fic, several SPaG errors, and a few plotholes, and you get one awful fic.<br><br>So, should you read it? I would say yes, at least partway. It is not as bad as the haters like to say (though they have a point), nor is it as good as the fans of it say (though they too have points). This is not my argument by the way, I will write that up after I give it a quick re-read. However, if you are into ponyfic, do give Pen Stroke&#39;s other works a shot. Is he the best writer in the fandom? Probably not, but he does have some talent. My favoites of his are <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/22535/better-living-through-science-and-ponies">Better Living through Science and Ponies</a>, A Potral X MLP crossover, and <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/22546/drop-of-moonshine"> A Drop of Moonshine</a>, where Celestia gets drunk. </p>

            <p>I have to say I&#39;m enjoying it so far. Writing-wise, it&#39;s not world-class literature or anything, but it&#39;s pretty good, and definitely leagues better than the average fanfic.<br><br>I think its worst sin character-wise is that it&#39;s a little too on the nose sometimes, like when Rainbow Dash compliments Scootaloo on her loyalty. Moments like that make me go bluh, but I&#39;d rather have it try too hard and be a little blunt about stuff than not try hard enough and get things plumb wrong.<br><br>Also, I think the story is set up pretty well, and (so far) Nyx hasn&#39;t totally dominated it. It&#39;s (again, so far) mostly focused on Twilight and the others reacting to her and, if they know what&#39;s going on, making up their minds how to deal with the situation. I think the struggle of &quot;could be Nightmare Moon reincarnated&quot; vs. &quot;definitely a cute, scared little filly right now&quot; is pretty believable.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure the complaint of only established bullies not liking Nyx is a very strong one in a universe built on the power of kindness, understanding, and friendship. Plus, it&#39;s not like Twilight and Rarity (the only two in the know yet) instantly fall in love at first sight. I believe Nyx actually wins them over by her actions, not just because the plot says so. If it goes on like that, I can&#39;t imagine I&#39;ll have a problem with it.<br><br>For all I know it&#39;ll go steeply downhill before the end, and since there are 22 chapters it&#39;s got plenty of time to disappoint me, but I&#39;d say it&#39;s worth a shot. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>
