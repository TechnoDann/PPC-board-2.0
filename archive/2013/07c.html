            <p>Hey guys, it&#39;s been a bit. I sort of got stranded in NW Arkansas playing opera pit with no internet for about a month and a half.

            <p>I&#39;m really glad to see this, because I&#39;ve been meaning to e-mail you for... probably about a month and a half, actually... to apologize for the massive amounts of procrastination I&#39;ve been doing. It&#39;s sort of a relief to know that it wouldn&#39;t have gotten through before now, even though it doesn&#39;t excuse me. I&#39;m actually on a really good doing-stuff kick right now (and I mean to keep it that way), so did you still want me to look over that mission?<br><br>Either way, welcome back!

            <p>What happened with the mission I helped beta a while back? I was looking forward to reading it in its official capacity, but it was never posted anywhere else. Are you just waiting until the interlude that introduces Florestan and Eusabius&#39;s new partner before showing his first missions?<br>I was just wondering.</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Let me try to weigh in here.<br><br>The first point, which I would like to be absolutely clear on, is that permission requests <i>need to be clear</i>. You may want permission, but no, it is not going to happen unless you submit a request that follows the guidelines, and <i>tell us that that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing</i>. Posting something &quot;just for feedback&quot; is not going to get you a &quot;Wow, you&#39;re awesome, do you want permission?&quot; Posting something that has a writing sample, AND a profile of your agents, AND what you&#39;re looking to tackle, AND specifically saying &quot;This is a permission request,&quot; that will get you a yes or a no.<br><br>Second, I know you socialize on the IRC, but it would help you greatly to also socialize on the &#39;Board if you&#39;re looking for permission. A lot of PGs just aren&#39;t on the IRC, for various reasons, and most people do a lot of hanging out on both. Both is good.<br><br>Third - I&#39;m going to be harsh here. But you need to just deal with the fact that sometimes people don&#39;t respond to you. Sometimes people don&#39;t give you feedback. Sometimes people don&#39;t have anything to say about your story. Sometimes people aren&#39;t interested. It happens. Sometimes people are too busy to get around to it. <i>It happens</i>. I&#39;ve seen you react like this on the IRC, too, and I have seen other people react badly when they don&#39;t get answers quickly. That&#39;s not behavior I would encourage. When you refuse to talk to anyone else on the &#39;Board, but get annoyed when others on the &#39;Board won&#39;t respond to you, you are sending the message that you think your topic is important, but theirs are not. That&#39;s <i>rude</i>. Don&#39;t do it.<br><br>This last bit is more of a minor concern, as PG - repeatedly putting up re-hashed versions of the same story, and asking for critique, is not something I&#39;d recommend either. It is far, far preferable, to ask if you can get a solid, steady beta or two to look over your story and help you edit it. Beta-by-crowdsourcing is unprofessional and kind of annoying, and also will not help you in the long run, if you&#39;re just taking in edits, changing the story, and moving on without really <i>thinking</i> or having a conversation about what you need to improve on. It also has the problem of over-editing, and, as Phobos pointed out, making the line between &quot;asking for feedback&quot; and &quot;this is a finished product&quot; very, very blurry. It&#39;s far preferable that you ask for a beta, write your story, send it to them, take their advice and edit it while <i>talking</i> to them about those edits, and then post the finished product as a &quot;Hey, I did this, what do you think?&quot; or a &quot;Hey, this is a writing sample, I&#39;m requesting permission!&quot;<br><br>I hope this was clear.</p>

            <p>1) The last time you posted this story is still on the front page.

            <p>I really enjoyed this story.  I think you struck a really nice balance between humor and drama.

            <p>First, if there are Boarders clicking on this post for some reason, I&#39;m going to be mentioning a lot of plot developments and such from the The Wrong Trousers story, so if you, unknown Boarders, plan to read that story, read it before reading this, because of spoilers. Okay? Good. On to questions, then.<br><br>Wait, so the Board of Flowers, despite knowing from a visit in their past that a group known as the Department of Efficiency was going to bring them down, decided to set up a group specifically to seek and correct inefficiencies and just didn&#39;t call it the same thing? And this happened after the loss of two of their Firstborn and the resurgence of a DIS-like group, but nobody takes the hint that something off was going on?<br>The PPC&#39;s more seasoned workers and Flowers are extremely genre savvy, as a rule. Giving a group that serves solely to increase efficiency control over HQ&#39;s system seems exactly like what formed the original problem in the first place, which seems like far much tempting of both fate and the Ironic Overpower to be a typical Flower response. Did the Sunflower Official&#39;s death just cause everyone to backpedal into fatalistic attachment to a timeline long separated?<br><br>And who is James Mansfield? The story implied that he was some sort of multi-universal resource manager, which is confusing in itself, but did he just show up in HQ one day, give them his card, and say &quot;Hiya, I&#39;m here to go through your entire system and change the way you&#39;ve been recruiting people for decades.&quot;? Because recruiting from the Word Worlds has been how it is for a reason, namely, that the PPC doesn&#39;t want to advertise its presence in the multiverse.<br>The whole &quot;Protectors&quot; bit in their name means they ensure that everything goes as written in the timelines of the various continua they encounter. They recruit bits from stories that have been destroyed, because the story that the bits came from will fade away anyway and have no effect on the canon of the world they&#39;re protecting. They kill Sues because the Sues destabilize events as written. It goes against their moral ground to enter into Word Worlds and grab random people from continua to join them, because those people were supposed to be in the continua playing out their roles in the canon. The PPC is terminally understaffed, yes, but that&#39;s just an out-of-universe hand wave for why they recruit so many sociopaths and maniacs and the like, and not something that would be dealt with in an official capacity, since doing so in a manner like the one here would involve breaking the intended secrecy the organization operates under.<br><br>What does the Department of Time, Order and Motion actually do? They were mentioned as being in charge of &quot;invigorating&quot; the DMS, creating stable time loops around HQ for some reason, and sending robots from an alternate dimension to roam the halls, but those three functions don&#39;t really fit together to say what the Department&#39;s function is.<br>They were obviously intended as a Department of Efficiency analogue, to the point that they are referred to as the Department of Efficiency multiple times, and don&#39;t get me wrong, I really like the idea of the Tick-Tock Men(though this may be in part because I&#39;ve got a clockwork agent-to-be myself), but the DTOM&#39;s functions seem kind of sporadic and unconnected. In particular, what are the time loops for? I can maybe understand going forward and backward <i>in</i> time to plan out how best to optimize the next few days, but why set up time loops in HQ? Are they using the looming threat of damage to the pre-set time loops to control people? I&#39;m just spitballing here, since there wasn&#39;t evidence of anything.<br><br>Why does the DTOM discourage keeping minis, and what do they do with the ones created by new badfics? Having minis around would keep the creatures out of both the continua, where they could potentially do damage, and HQ&#39;s main facilities, where there would be plenty of them and they would form a tax on the resources, which would go against their designs on an optimized PPC. Besides, the Agents keeping minis would be similar to keeping pets, and it would likely help in terms of morale, since the DTOM&#39;s actions would likely result in the rise of uncertainty in the workers.<br>And as I asked before, what are they doing with the minis? You said all minis were brought to &quot;a drab, soulless place&quot;, but what would the DTOM gain from doing that? There&#39;s no logical benefit in keeping the minis, who if I may remind you are fully sentient and sapient beings in their own right, in what amounts to a massive prison chamber, especially when you consider how likely they are to cause trouble when cooped up with other minis in a confined space. How do they keep the minis from busting out, running around doing damage, or teaming up to scheme on the downfall of their captors? Do they keep them all in stasis or something?<br><br>I don&#39;t have much to say about the bit in Skeet and Amelia&#39;s RC, other than that I liked the way it played out, especially with Skeet sounding like the reasonable one even though the people who side with a resistance are normally the designated good guys. Shame that story possibility sort of fell through in the next scene.<br><br>Why does the Ghost just decide to show up on their console after they kill the DTOM agents? It was made clear no one in the RC knew it, or posibly even of it, and it didn&#39;t really do anything other than show up, say that it would tell the resistance that the DTOM attacked some DMS agents, which shouldn&#39;t be news to the resistance at any rate, and then vanish from the story. Was it just floating around the network when Skeet killed three people through a door, and then just decided &quot;<i>oh look it is a prime opportunity to meddle i would be disappointing myself if i would not get involved in such a jewel of meddling history</i>&quot;?<br><br>The scene in the Cafeteria was great, I must say, one of the gems of the story. &quot;12:35 – shoot a Tick-Tock Man in the face&quot;. Classic. I can just imagine a flat, strident +++What+++ getting ready to emerge from its vocalizers before Skeet shoots it.<br><br>And what do you mean by the story being AU for everyone except your agents? What would this mean for anyone who co-writes with you, which would by default place their agents within the same world as yours? Or is this related to some spoilerrific future development that will result in the AU Skeet and Amelia merging with the main Skeet and Amelia or something of the sort?<br><br>Oh, also, I found comma splices. <i>“Hey, the DAC proposal got blocked by the Board, you don’t have anything to worry about.”</i> That second comma should be a period and the end of a sentence. <i>“Regulators, open up!”</i> The sentence as it is now is telling the Regulators to open their door, rather than the DMS agents. To get the message you more likely wanted, that comma should be a period or an exclamation point.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not going to answer all of your questions here, because doing so would give out some fairly massive spoilers. As for the stuff that I am willing to comment on...<br><br>Regarding DTOM, yes by the time of the story they have become equivalent to the original Department of Efficiency, but the idea wasn&#39;t presented to the Board in that way, and they didn&#39;t start out that way. The thing is, on the face of it, a Department of Efficiency is kind of a hard thing to argue against - surely improving the effectiveness of agents is a good thing? The Marquis even says that he agrees with the idea &#39;in principle&#39; in The Trousers of Time. The only reason that the DoE was prevented from forming was that the Board had specific foreknowledge that this would be a Bad Thing. They weren&#39;t objecting to the idea of the department, just what they knew it would eventually lead to. DTOM has completely different origins, so I don&#39;t think there would have been any reason to suspect that it would end up going down the same route as the DoE.<br><br>Mansfield is actually a character that I&#39;ve had in mind for a while now, although in the Prime PPC timeline he&#39;ll never go further than the DivAR. Actually, that was a note that I meant to put up when I posted the story - I&#39;ve put references to a couple of ideas that I&#39;m planning on including in my spin-off, because they would have happened by the time this story is set. And yeah, he is a interdimensional recruitment specialist because... well, why not? It seemed nicely random, and offers an alternative to the &#39;fell through a plothole&#39; or &#39;recruited during mission&#39; methods of new agents getting to HQ - there may well be plenty of potential recruits that come from stories that aren&#39;t bad enough to send Assassins in to, so DivAR opens up that potential resource. They will still just recruit minor or bit characters, so they won&#39;t be going against the ideals of the PPC, and there&#39;s no problem with secrecy either - after agents leave a story any uncanon memories tend to fade away. <br><br>DTOM discouraging people from keeping minis, and taking over the running of the Adoption Agency from Skeet and Amy, is just about cutting down on the distractions. As far as they are concerned, agents are supposed to be about completing missions, not playing with cats - they probably discourage other &#39;time wasting&#39; activities too, it&#39;s just that the thing with the minis hit Skeet and Amy the hardest. The original purpose of DTOM was to get the Assassins properly motivated again during the shock/mourning period (I imagine that the loss of the SO would leave the whole Department thoroughly dispirited) they did this in part by setting targets and goals for the agents, and turning it into a competition, see who could finish their missions the quickest, etc. similar to the stuff that DoE did. Basically, giving them a quick reason to fight again, which wasn&#39;t based on revenge (which could have resulted in them failing to follow procedure when it came to charging Sues).<br><br>As for Skeet being a &#39;Designated Good Guy&#39; - I&#39;m not so sure of that myself, after all, he did murder three people (and it&#39;s not as if he can claim self-defence on that). Personally I see him as being mostly neutral rather than specifically Good or Evil, although I am basing that on a lot of currently unpublished/unwritten material, so it may not be as clear to anyone else. <br><br>As far as I can see it, the Ghost does what it wants for reasons of its own. As an AI, it&#39;s presumably capable of monitoring just about anything in HQ, and it has got involved in major events before. <br><br>Hopefully that&#39;s covered enough, without actually giving too much away - if you do want any more details I could probably e-mail them to you or something.  <br></p>

            <p>So, Mansfield&#39;s presence here is out of the context you originally meant for him to be encountered in, and that&#39;s why he didn&#39;t make a lot of sense here. Fair enough.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t Skeet I was saying was the designated good guy. Maybe I phrased that a little poorly. What I meant was, normally &quot;the resistance&quot; is always the good guy in a story, and it was nice to see a protagonist have reasonable reactions to what&#39;s going on while still remaining protagonistic. The bit that I said fell through was the potential story idea where the two protagonists still trusted each other due to years of working with each other, but each had their own ideas about the resistance and whether or not joining it would work out for the better, but the plot moved in another direction that precludes that possibility.<br>I&#39;m not saying that the way it was executed here was bad, far from it, but it&#39;s just an idea that I thought I&#39;d see dealt with and it turned out that it wasn&#39;t actually going to happen.<br><br>Either way, the presence of the Ghost in the Machine in this story didn&#39;t really do much. I mean, the scene there was probably setting up its presence in this AU for future installments, but having it just show up, not affect anything, and then vanish makes me think that it might have just been better to have it show up for the first time whenever in the sequel it was about to do something, even if that doing something is just the meddling it usually gets up to. </p>

            <p>It was my impression, at least, that the time loops along with the fitness regimen was used to keep the agents younger and fitter than they would be naturally, thus increasing efficiency. Exiling the minis would, I guess, be an effort to eliminate &quot;distractions&quot; from missions caused by affection and general mischief, and their cruel treatment is probably to build dislike for the DTOM and solidify their status as heartless tyrants.<br>Okay, James Mansfield&#39;s inexplicable appearance and reforms were a little random. That didn&#39;t seem to have too much significance in the long run. I also agree that the messaging didn&#39;t exactly make sense, and the scene could have flowed even without it.<br>AU for all but those agents could just be a polite attempt to reassure others that they don&#39;t neccessarily have to conform to the future set out in this story, but that it is still a personality-developing point in Amy and Skeet&#39;s lives and will continue to impact those characters.<br>That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got, and I could be wrong, but I think you may be trying to read too much into things. :)<br><br>-- Len</p>

            <p>That&#39;s not really what time loops do. There are multiple definitions, since there are multiple time-travel models, but the two most common ones are that the area enclosed in a loop will reset to how it was when the loop was set up once a certain amount of time has passed, and that it&#39;s a function involving time travel to allow for an increased amount of time or increased perception of other periods in time without altering the timeline as a whole. Neither of those would increase fitness, and the second option would actually make everyone affected by it older.<br><br>So, the DTOM wanted the agents to think of them as heartless tyrants? That doesn&#39;t sound at all like something a group would actually strive for, unless that group was serving as a puppet for another group to act as a scapegoat for things going wrong. That, while a good story concept in itself, doesn&#39;t mesh with how the DTOM is presented, so it&#39;s unlikely.<br><br>I recognize what the &quot;AU for everyone else&quot; section was intended to mean, but I was wondering what impacts it would have in an in-universe perspective. If two people are born in the same timestream, and neither of them are time travelers, yet one of them winds up in a different future than the other one, what would have caused that?<br>It would be one thing if the Irish Samurai&#39;s PPC writing never crossed over with anyone else&#39;s, but it&#39;s crossed over with both Phobos&#39;s and Huinesoron&#39;s characters, and Huinesoron&#39;s characters link to at least half of the other PPC spin-offs, especially when considering the Alumia exorcism mission. Thus, the timeline as it stands means that Skeet and Amelia wind up in a different future from everyone else if this AU is intended as the personal futures of the non-AU Skeet and Amelia. I just wanted Irish Samurai to explain it, in case I overlooked something.</p>

            <p>...the DTOM wouldn&#39;t logically aim to present themselves as ruthless tyrants to the agents, but the author might aim to present them as ruthless tyrants to the readers, for plot&#39;s sake.

            <p>I am only going to address the &quot;AU for everyone else&quot; portion of this post.<br><br>The problem you seem to be having is that Irish Samurai has had my characters appear in one of his stories, but has now written a story that is labeled AU.  You want to know how that squares with my characters&#39; storylines (I know it is more complicatedthan that, but bear with me).<br><br>First thing to look at is when does this take place.  It is in the future.  So, it can&#39;t have any real bearing on Durotar and Kur&#39;nak&#39;s storylines because their official futures haven&#39;t been written by me, yet.  This is always the case with the future.<br><br>Second thing to look at, if the future thing wasn&#39;t in play, is what happens in an AU.  An AU does not mean that it has no connection to the Prime Timeline (if such a thing can be said to exist in the PPC), but rather that it is similar to, but divergent from, the Primeline.  It makes sense that Durotar and Kur&#39;nak would exist in an alternate timeline, since their recruitment would not have changed in this setting.  However, their existing in an AU does not affect their Primeline selves.  So, there is not any contradiction, here.  I can still write their futures as I see fit (spoiler alert, it probably involves delivering the mail for the rest of their natural lives, while the PPC continues work as usual).<br><br>A third point, you seem confused about how branching timelines work, in this instance.  Skeet and Amelia did not cease to exist in one timeline when they entered another, nor did everyone else end up in a different future.  They all exist in both timelines simultaneously.  So, this future, though it involves Skeet and Amelia, is not a part of their Primeline.  It is a divergent timeline that runs parallel to their Primeline.<br><br>So, all of that together means that Irish Samurai can have appearances by my characters (or hS&#39;s) and not screw up their timelines.<br><br>Does all of that make sense?  If not, I can try to find a better way to describe it.  I keep feeling like visual aides would help, though that is probably because I am a visual thinker.<br><br>-Phobos, Lord of Time</p>

            <p>If versions of Skeet and Amelia existed in both timelines simultaneously, with AU versions of themselves living in the AU timeline, and Primeline (I like that contraction) versions of themselves existing in the same timeline as the Primeline Durotar and Kur&#39;nak, there wouldn&#39;t be anything to question, because it would make sense that the natives of one timeline would stay within that timeline until a time machine or a rip in space-time or something of the sort brought them to a different timeline, and thus an alternate universe.<br><br>How it&#39;s presented in the story, on the other hand, it says that the events of the AU would be canon for the Skeet and Amelia in the Primeline. That&#39;s what I was confused about.<br>I understand that an AU would be similar to the Primeline of its canon(if we&#39;re calling the main PPC time stream a canon here), but it wouldn&#39;t contain the Primeline versions of the characters naturally. It would contain a similar being sharing traits with his/her/its Primeline counterpart, but I understand that the Primeline version wouldn&#39;t be leaving the Primeline to take up the slot.<br><br>If something is AU for one group, it would by extension be AU for everyone else who has ever interacted with them, barring time shenanigans or Rule of Funny that might have allowed some of the Primeline characters to glean events of the AU. But, since The Wrong Trousers was intended as AU for everyone <i>but</i> Skeet and Amelia, and the characters of Durotar and Kur&#39;nak have interacted with Skeet and Amelia, what would that mean for them? They count as part of &quot;everyone&quot;, right?<br><br>And what about the meeting between those two and Kayleigh Leonard? Kayleigh has interacted with Selene Windflower, and at one point, Selene went on a mission to exorcise the infamous Sue Alumia, an event which led to a few dozen PPC Agents getting involved, which places all of those agents in the same timeline as Kayleigh, and subsequently in the same timeline as Skeet and Amelia. What happens to those dozens of Agents? It just raised too many questions for me.<br><br>To summarize, it&#39;s not so much the fact that it&#39;s an AU. I get that. I know it&#39;s an alternate future, and thus isn&#39;t part of the main time stream everyone else uses, but the story had said that it was going to be the future for the Primeline Skeet and Amelia. I didn&#39;t know how that would work.<br>Would the Primeline Skeet and Amelia be thrown out of their original timeline somehow into the AU? Would someone take their place? Details like those seem like they would be important enough to mention in the story.<br><br>Of course, I could have misinterpreted you entirely, and you were saying that the versions of your characters that appeared in Irish Samurai&#39;s timeline so far were alternate versions of themselves, and that everything Skeet and Amelia ever did was always in an alternate timeline, but that raises even more questions and contradicts one of the other points you made, so probably not.</p>

            <p>I think the problem you are having is that you want all of the PPC to exist in a single, coherent timeline that everyone is writing in.  That is not the case and it never has been.  There is no PPC Primeline.  There is the Phobos Primeline, and the hS Primeline, and the Irish Samurai Primeline, and a hundred others.  Each of us is writing a separate AU.  We often adopt things from other timelines, but the only real canon for the PPC, as a whole, is the Original Series.  That is the only thing that happened in every one of our timelines.<br><br>So, it does not matter what Irish Samurai does.  He lacks the power to affect the timeline of anyone else&#39;s agents, unless they accept it.  Everyone else is free to adopt or ignore what he writes as they see fit.  Just like everyone is free to adopt or ignore the idea that the Flowers come from someplace called Origin, or that there is a mirror multiverse.  These things are all AU, even if they are widely believed, so you can ignore them, or write alternate versions, or whatever.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>To travel one way, when someone co-writes with someone else, or allows for their PPC characters to appear in someone else&#39;s work, it&#39;s consensual, right? So both authors are agreeing to accept the features of the others&#39; world as part of their world, or else the two groups of agents would never have met, right?. If someone adopts parts of another person&#39;s timeline, one is, by default, connecting to a larger world composed of everyone who has co-written with that person, everyone who has co-written with that person&#39;s co-writers, and so on. If the PPC didn&#39;t have a coherent world, then there wouldn&#39;t be any background to place a new character in. That&#39;s part of what makes the PPC fun; each new addition is building on a world that has been constructed by many writers through over a decade of work and creativity. Details can change, yes, and they often do, but the world remains the same, and by crossing over with other peoples&#39; spin-offs, one is, by default, accepting admittance into this larger world.<br>You said that some people might not accept parts of the PPC history or methods, and anyone is free to change anything that wasn&#39;t mentioned in the Original Series, but I&#39;m not exactly sure what shared parts of the PPC would be open for interpretation. If someone says &quot;Well, in <i>most</i> spin-offs, Hornbeam the Ironwood is in charge of DoSAT, but in <i>mine</i>, it&#39;s a lizard named Gerald who walks with a cane.&quot;, then people would say that whoever that was should not have been messing with the way the PPC works in that way, because Hornbeam is an established part of PPC canon and Gerald could easily have been rewritten as one of DoSAT&#39;s senior agents that we just happened to never meet up until this point.<br>You&#39;re right that the timeline shifts and changes, since every time someone inserts events into the past or writes a possible future, they&#39;re technically retconning things, but it&#39;s one thing to insert events into the past of an established character or to claim that an agent had been working in his current department since 2009 when the Boarder who writes him had only discovered the PPC in 2011, and quite another to go against other portions of the established, for lack of a better word, canon of the PPC, even if one is doing so inadvertently.<br><br>To travel the other way, it might all sort itself out in the end in this case, and either way, The Wrong Trousers was a good read with some interesting concepts behind it, so I&#39;m going to evoke the MST3K Mantra here and relax. The Irish Samurai said that there would be sequels to The Wrong Trousers, and since I don&#39;t know where the story&#39;s going to go from this point, for all I know, the &quot;AU for everyone else&quot; bit could be the core component for an excellent and unexpected plot development.</p>

            <p>I see what you are saying.  I have an alternate explanation.  Let&#39;s use D&amp;K showing up at Skeets RC to illustrate the two views.<br><br>Your explanation is that the crossing over of those two groups of characters means that they share the same PPC universe.  So, any character that appears with either group is also in the same universe.  Nume and Ilraen, for instance, since they were in the first Going Postal.<br><br>I can see the logic of that.  It is commonly used to link television shows, movies, comics, and other media.<br><br>My explanation is that the meeting of these two groups of agents does not mean that they share the same prime universe.  I believe, instead, that D&amp;K-prime are in one universe, while Skeet-prime is in a separate universe.  The fact that D&amp;K interact with Skeet can then mean one of two things.<br><br>1) Skeet-prime interacted with the D&amp;K of his universe, but D&amp;K-prime never had that contact with Skeet in their universe.  It is canon for Skeet-prime, but not for D&amp;K-prime<br><br>2) The interaction happened the exact same way in both universes.  That would make it canon for Skeet-prime and D&amp;K-prime, without them ever actually being in the same universe.<br><br>Often times we use the second option in the PPC, which makes many of the universes appear very similar.  In this case, Irish Samurai is, I believe, asking for us to use the first option.<br><br>I guess the difference between the two explanations comes down to this: Does accepting that another author&#39;s character exists in the same world that your character exists in, mean that you accept all of the details of that author&#39;s world?<br><br>Your answer seems to be &quot;Yes.&quot;  My answer is &quot;No, but you can if you want to.&quot;<br><br><br>Relaxing sounds nice, though.

I have to admit, when I first read the fic I was a bit wary of  the possibility of sun shining from every orifice, but I think it&#39;s well-written and dealt with well enough all in all.</p>

            <p>But Kirk is already multitalented in canon. I haven&#39;t read far, but if they touch on some of his flaws - disregarding authority and being reckless - it won&#39;t be Suvian at all.

            <p>... the only case in which, in a PPC context, it is possible to talk about &#39;a well-written Mary-Sue&#39;.<br><br>The reason for that is that the PPC defines a Mary-Sue first and foremost as a type of badly-written character. Someone pointed out long ago that we have a Department of <b>Bad</b> Slash, but not of <b>Bad</b> Mary-Sues. While other chunks of the internet may use different definitions, in a PPC context, (non-parody) &#39;Sue == badly-written.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Obviously, the same could be said for anything else we deal with. A parody of a bad slash-type &#39;fic could be a &#39;good bad slash&#39;. A parody of an implausible crossover could be &#39;a good implausible crossover&#39;. These are of course very different to &#39;good slash&#39; and &#39;plausible crossover&#39; - as &#39;good [parody] Sue&#39; is different to &#39;well-written character&#39;. ~hS</p>

            <p>As per usual, this is one angle on the idea, and others of us have other opinions. I know a lot of people consider a Mary Sue a certain character type, possible to be written well or poorly.<br><br>(Those people would consider the department of Mary Sues to actually <i>be</i> the Department of Bad Mary Sues, probably.

            <p>I&#39;ve been working on a re-write of the wiki article to make it less contradictory, because right now it really is, and that&#39;s not useful. This is the updated short-form definition I&#39;m working from:<br><br> A Mary Sue is an unintentionally flat fictional character recognizable by a marked disconnect between what the narrative <i>says</i> about it versus what the narrative <i>shows</i> about it. The Mary Sue character is almost always the central focus of its story, and the plot serves it rather than itself serving the plot. It achieves its goals with minimal effort, out of proportion to what the audience would expect given the setting(s), culture(s), and other natives of the universe it inhabits. 
<br>I think that better supports the current primary traits, which I believe do add up to &quot;poorly written&quot;; how can a character that acts unbelievably, gets unbelievable treatment from other characters, and is doted on by the narrative without doing anything to earn it be anything but?<br><br>Also, I think it&#39;s worth noting that in the PPC universe, a character isn&#39;t a Mary Sue (thus qualifying for assassination) unless there are sufficient charges against it, and the charges almost always have to do with bad writing (throwing characters OOC, creating minis, creating Designated Bastards/Love Interests/etc., mucking with timelines, causing events to eventuate for the sole benefit of the OC without regard for the plot, etc.). The deck is pretty stacked here.<br><br>That&#39;s not to say people aren&#39;t allowed to enjoy Sue stories—nobody here has the authority to tell anyone else what not to like—but <i>within the PPC universe</i>, &quot;good Mary Sues&quot; don&#39;t make much sense. And hopefully, this definition actually separates those enjoyable, well-written characters from the kind the PPC goes after anyway, which I think is the ultimate goal here: to refine our definition until it <i>only</i> encompasses the objectively bad stuff, thus eliminating any potential doubt about whether we&#39;re targeting stories that don&#39;t deserve it. Because we <i>shouldn&#39;t</i> be targeting stories that are anything but objectively badly written. That should be plain. I aim to make it more so.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... running my agents through a mission for the Department of WhatThe. One of the main characters has been determined to be a flagrant character replacement - but not a Mary-Sue, mostly due to her not actually <i>doing</i> very much. That means I&#39;m a) making sure I don&#39;t call her one, and b) thinking very hard about what to do with her once she&#39;s been charged.<br><br>It would have been very easy to just say &#39;main character, doing bad stuff to the story, therefore Mary-Sue&#39; - but I think it&#39;s more informative, and more worthwhile for me to write, if I <i>don&#39;t</i> do that.<br><br>On the flip side, my other ongoing mission includes several discussions on what exactly makes her a &#39;Sue... all of which comes together as a &#39;Thank you! Precise definitions are awesome&#39;.<br><br>hS<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Oh, right, comments on what was actually posted...<br><br>I think your short definition is a good one. In my quick read-through, it&#39;s hitting the following points:<br><br>-Gender-neutral - since the article really refers to both Sues and Stus<br><br>-&#39;unintentionally&#39; - Parody &#39;Sues are not real &#39;Sues (by which I mean, they aren&#39;t a problem)<br><br>-&#39;flat&#39;, &#39;marked disconnect&#39;, &#39;central focus&#39; - I think these three points come together to signify that they are badly-written. You can, obviously, have a flat character who doesn&#39;t ruin the story - if they&#39;re a minor character, or in some cases if they&#39;re a silent protagonist. But if they&#39;re the <i>focus</i> of the story, then yeah, they need to have depth; counterexamples (such as a lot of sci-fi stuff) generally shift the focus to the world, not the character. So the &#39;flat&#39; and &#39;central focus&#39; points already make a Mary-Sue a feature of mediocre writing at best. The &#39;disconnect&#39; shunts it over into bad. That said, I <i>would</i> still like to see &#39;poorly-written&#39; appear in the article, even if not in the short definition.<br><br>-&#39;the plot serves it&#39; - this is a very important point. Again, and I hope this point will be made, this isn&#39;t about being active or passive - it&#39;s about whether the character exists to improve the story, or whether they exist to showcase themselves, and use the story to that end. The standard &#39;is better at fighting than [canon warrior]&#39; charge is one of many, many examples of how this can be done (contrasted to &#39;is better at fighting than [canon warrior] due to [believable reason which is plot-relevant]&#39; - if a trait could be removed without the plot being affected, that&#39;s usually a bad sign).<br><br>I think most of your other points expand on either &#39;disconnect&#39; or &#39;the plot serves it&#39;.<br><br>And (I can&#39;t access the Wiki from here, so forgive me if it&#39;s already there) I think it needs to be clear that the secondary traits - sparkly hair, half-fairy, soulmate of Legolas, etc etc - do not only appear in Sues; they can be used as warning signs, as charges, and as things to comment on (and <i>how!</i>), but they aren&#39;t diagnostic. A character with every &#39;Sue Trait&#39; in the book still isn&#39;t a Mary-Sue... if she&#39;s well written, and her traits serve the plot, and so on. But that&#39;s not very likely...<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: Does anyone else get the urge to go through a Litmus Test and come up with a character and story which can hit every &#39;secondary trait&#39; on the list without being a Mary-Sue?)</p>

            <p>I ran into something like that with two of my favorite Star Trek characters, Data and Seven of Nine. Data, being an android, has many of the secondary characteristics - superhuman phsyical and mental abilities, being able to play multiple instruments and speak many languages with little effort, etc. He even has a tragic past, and positive personailty traits such as curiosity and kindness. But he&#39;s still a compelling character because he always gets challenged in his spotlight episodes. One has him dealing with how to convince a group of people to evacuate their home planet. He has no emotions, so convincing people to leave something they had an emotional connection to was very hard.<br><br>Seven is even worse - she has most of the knowledge of the Borg collective, superhuman stength, <i>and</i> is ridiculously gorgeous and can sing. But she deals with her Borg tragic past in a realistic way, sort of retaining Borg characteristics (a desire for efficiency and a belief that she is superior), but gaining human ones (loyalty to her friends). Her Borg nature alienates people, yet she does want to be human. She&#39;s interesting to watch because of that struggle.<br><br>I guess my point is, while these characters have a lot of secondary Suvian traits, they&#39;re examples of how to give a character these traits and do it well. And the key, I think, is to challenge the character. Mary Sues shape the plot to favor them. Good characters and the plot interact - the plot shapes the character&#39;s development, and the actions and choices the characters make because of that development shape the plot.<br></p>

            <p>The Element Lord of Cupcakes opened its single frosting-laced eye, glaring out at the world. It was laying on a table, in a blank gray room with a blank gray ceiling, but it could sense hundreds, if not thousands, of its brethren in the halls and levels of the structure-saturated land it now inhabited. <i>Yes,</i> it thought, deep within its sugary mind. <i>A new world. A world of flesh and bone, yet a world I myself can rule with a moist and succulent fist.</i><br><br>Its musings on world conquest were interrupted, however, by a massive creature behind it taking a massive bite from its anterior side. The Element Lord of Cupcakes howled in pain, thrashing out at its offender with a tendril of frosting, but its desperation caused it to miss by inches.<br><br>Its upper frosting distorted with glee as the hole in its front regrew, and the massive being of bone and flesh widened its primitive observation spheres, taking a single step back. Seizing the opportunity, the Element Lord of Cupcakes rose a  tendril dramatically.<br><br>Down the hall, the remnants of a birthday party were just being cleaned up. A sound from the table drew the attention of one of the cleanup staff, who stared in confusion as the remaining birthdays pastries suddenly floated into the air and hovered out the door three at a time. In the halls, they joined a slew of assorted other pastries, mostly cakes and cake-related products, all converging on a single room.<br><br>The flesh-and-bone had just regained its poise, and had begun to advance solidly toward the Element Lord of Cupcakes. It raised a hand to grab at its much smaller opponent, when suddenly a cloud of pastries flew in through the door, striking the flesh-and-bone as one. It grunted in pain and shock, flying across the room to be quickly buried by sugary food.<br><br>Leaping up and down in satisfaction, the Element Lord of Cupcakes instructed some of its new subjects to fly toward it. They obeyed, and upon reaching within three feet of their new master, they were merged and converted into a single oblong delicacy, sporting a noticeable dent in the top and a haphazard arrangement of frosting colors, sprinkles, and coconut topping.<br><br>The gleeful cupcake leapt to the top of its new creation, settling itself into the dent before driving the delicacy out the door, a vestige of the swarm of summoned food following in its wake.<br><br><i>Now,</i> it thought to itself, <i>I will see what else this strange and wondrous new world has to offer.</i></p>

            <p>One of the flavors of pizzas you can find in almost every pizzeria here in Italy is peppers and sausages or salami. (Which, on an unrelated note, is Italian too. Althought &quot;salami&quot; is plural. The singular is &quot;salame&quot;)<br><br>So, it was probably one of the first toppings imported in America, an Americans heard &quot;peperoni&quot; and liked the word.

            <p>Hi, I introduced myself a while ago and then promptly disappeared. I&#39;m back now *confetti rains down* Any who, I&#39;ve been doing some research on the OFUs. I know, the PPC is not directly affiliated with the OFUs, but if someone were to write one for Doctor Who(perhaps me?); are there any agents in this continuum willing to help out?<br>I know that you don&#39;t need to ask Permission for these sort of things, but I was a bit hesitant to start because PPC agents help out and well, I&#39;m pretty new.

            <p>Do you mean native to the continuum, or specialized in the continuum, or with Doctor Who as one of their fandoms, or what exactly?<br><br>Anyway, I remember seeing a Doctor Who OFU a while ago, but it fell to the OFU Curse and was never finished, so I figure it&#39;s about time someone else made one. If you want to write it, I&#39;m sure plenty of us here would read it.<br>What exactly do you want here?

I&#39;m not sure whether to be proud or ashamed of myself.<br><br>If you read the log, please let me know if you spot any broken HTML. I checked it over pretty thoroughly, but there&#39;s almost always something that slips through the cracks. Otherwise, enjoy!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>But then, it&#39;d be weird if I did, as I wasn&#39;t there for it :)<br><br>I did wonder if agents had ever done anything in memory of those lost in the big events, besides simply carving their names into the Tomb, so this was cool to see. A very enjoyable read, and the seperate sections you&#39;ve put it into make it much easier to follow the different storylines than the original RP. <br><br>Thanks for sharing this. <br><br>You also said that you&#39;d done a little light editing on the posts to correct minor SPaG issues etc., and I spotted a couple of bits that I think slipped through that:<br>- Part 2 has the line &#39;he whipped off his foggy glasses and cleaned them carefully on his shirt, taking the time to wipe <u>eyes eyes</u>&#39; - that should probably read &#39;his eyes&#39;. <br>- Part 5 has &#39;&quot;Known him practically since I joined up, and he&#39;s saved my life more times <u>tan</u> I can remember off the top of my head&#39; - that should probably be &#39;than&#39;, although some agents are slurring their words by this point, the speaker here doesn&#39;t seem to have made any other mistakes. </p>

            <p>RPs are never exactly bastions of great writing (though of course it&#39;s good to try). IMO, most of the fun is in getting caught up in the characters&#39; emotions, so if the prose runs a little bit toward melodrama in the midst of it, that&#39;s only to be expected. Plus, it was four years ago. All of a person&#39;s own writing from four years ago looks like bleh to them, whether it actually is or not. ^_~<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I enjoyed both stories. ^<em>^<br><br>I would have liked to see what happened at the party, but I guess it was just about how they made it happen at all, after Crashing Down. As such, it works well: everyone&#39;s reactions to the invitation are unique and say something about them as people. I did half-expect the whole thing to mushroom until half of HQ was invited, but I&#39;m also glad it didn&#39;t, since it would&#39;ve been the obvious thing.

            <p>I admit I didn&#39;t totally remember everyone from <i>Crashing Down</i> who appears in &quot;Winding Down,&quot; but I do remember how tense <i>Crashing Down</i> was, and all the suffering that happened.  So &quot;Winding Down&quot; was exactly what its title says: a moment of calm and a return to normalcy for the characters involved.  That made it feel good to read, even if I didn&#39;t specifically remember the history of each character.  One typo, in the scene where Constance invites Steve: &quot;There were more important things to thing about, though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hello, Hello!&quot; makes an excellent companion piece to &quot;Greetings and Hello.&quot;  I like how the Cilantro&#39;s &quot;identity&quot; is kept ambiguous, and also the fact that the two departments have such intriguingly similar circumstances occurring.  I want to hear Haar and Orinoco have a conversation together, now (assuming they aren&#39;t the same robot getting job duties mixed up, although the Cilantro&#39;s comment about Orinoco&#39;s recruitment makes that unlikely).  One typo: In the sentence where Orinoco first gives his(?) name, he refers to himself as &quot;Orinico&quot; at the end.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s get this rolling.<br><br>-Y&#39;know, if the OFUR ever returns to life, I half want to enroll as a mole. Nobody seems to like the digger folk, and Axtel Sturnclaw and Egburt are two of my favorite characters.<br><br>-How would Yorick be disguised in OFU&#39;s? He&#39;s an urple bloody skeletal champion sorcerer (yes, I finally decided on a class), but what would he turn into in, say, OFUR? <br><br>-On the subject of Yorick, what would the typical response of most agents be to seeing him? Besides, ya know, screaming. He&#39;s friendly enough, just blast-happy and lacking in self-preservation. Not that he needs that latter one. Bloody skeleton.<br><br>-So, I have a full set of ten near-godlike beings as original characters, though they stand outside the main conflict in their story of origin. All pf them violate some law of physics, whether a real-world one or an in-setting one. In addition, all but two of them are resurrected members of a certain in-setting race. How would one go about writing their interactions with the PPC? They are:<br><br>-- White, the Law of Life. The most powerful of the group, able to create souls (a true impossibility in the story)<br><br>-- Red, the Guardian of Power. He&#39;s a dragon, although his exact appearance constantly changes. His violation of physics is the ability to destroy matter. He&#39;s violently protective of Blue, but we&#39;ll get to that one later. He used to be one of the dragon people.<br><br>-- Orange is not fully defined, but my friend and I figure he does weird crap with gravity. He used to be a Librarian, a demonic-but-neutral keeper of universal knowledge.<br><br>-- Yellow, the Mentalist. A yellow humanoid with no arms, and no features on its head other than seven eyes. Its violation of science is an in-setting one, namely that it can completely bypass any opposing willpower for mind-reading. He used to be Kyouki-jin, an alien race of shapeshifters and bloody psychos, two of whom are central protagonists and one of which is the big bad.<br><br>-- Green, the Crafter of Plagues. A 300-foot centipede who is actually a very friendly and social person. It&#39;s just that he generates a disease that afflicts all life and kills in minutes, and thanks to Gray, he hasn&#39;t had a chance to learn to control it. He hates Gray. He used to be Karthenl, an alien race of arsenic-based insectoids.<br><br>-- Gray, the Renegade. He fancies himself a cop that goes about punishing criminals in the universe with his timehax and mind-rape cigars. The problem is that he typically considers anyone a criminal, and was soundly dealt with by White. The only evil one of the bunch, he can manipulate time (another in-setting impossibility) and he used to be human. Specifically, Al Capone.<br><br>-- Blue, the Generator. Like Orange, he isn&#39;t fully defined, but he&#39;s at least more defined than Orange. He&#39;s a childish entity, protected by Red and who can create energy of all kinds. He&#39;s very friendly, and likely more suited to the Nursery, but there you have it.<br><br>-- Indigo, the Living Mountain. Exactly what it says on the tin, except the tin doesn&#39;t say that it&#39;s COMPLETELY solid, and I mean completely. Yes, down to the subatomic level. Yes, it&#39;s a physical impossibility, but we&#39;ve established by this point that the Strange don&#39;t  care about such things. It&#39;s the last of the Ganda, a semi-sapient form of silicon-based life.<br><br>-- Violet, the Rampant. The largest and most monstrous of the strange, whose physical problem is being a living thing that moves faster than light without bending space. He/she/it/they used to be a member of an unnamed and mostly-extinct race of psychotic alien giants. It&#39;s bigger than most stars, so, uh, yeah, no PPC for this one.<br><br>-- Black, the Law of Death. Basically, the Grim Reaper, and it possesses the ability to destroy souls. It can speak, but you can only hear it if you&#39;re either Strange or if it really hates you and wants you afraid of it. Don&#39;t worry, he&#39;s mostly doing his job. He hates those that get off on making others suffer, though.</p>

            <p>1) That&#39;d be up to whoever runs it - Laburnum, IIRC.<br><br>2) Why would he be in an OFU? I mean, occasionally PPC Agents <i>visit</i> OFU, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a reason to enter one. If you wanted to have him visit, then he&#39;d be in his own form.<br><br>3) That depends entirely on the agent. They&#39;re used to seeing strange things, remember - most would probably demand that he put some clothing on, because ye gods the blindness. And yes, self-preservation would be a plus, considering that in the multiverse, there&#39;s a way to kill anything. An agent who literally cannot be killed or destroyed in any way would be a bit dull, don&#39;t you think? More fun to read about something when there&#39;s an actual risk involved.<br><br>4) Don&#39;t. Just... don&#39;t. I would not be a fan of a bunch of godlike, immense, physics-violating beings just... randomly tossed into the PPC. I am especially concerned with Green, who could apparently destroy all life, and Grey, because any character with the word &quot;rape&quot; or &quot;mind rape&quot; in their one line description sends up flashing alarm bells. The last time I remember seeing something this powerful and massive in the PPC was the Mysterious Somebody, and that was a long, multi-year story arc done by an experienced writer. <br><br>I am very, very wary of just tossing a bunch of massively overpowered godlike beings into the PPC just for the hell of it. Stick to agents. Normal, everyday, realistic agents with character depth. <i>Then</i>, when you know you can convincingly write characters in this setting, we can talk about the interesting things.</p>

            <p>What is their opinion on one giving up entirely? It just popped up in HFA while I was reading, but doesn&#39;t appear to go anywhere. What do the canons and coordinators think of students who just resign to a lack of skill and give up on writing entirely?<br><br>Something tells me that even OFUs wouldn&#39;t be cruel enough to encourage this course of action.

            <p>...and you&#39;d be surprised how cruel we can be. *evil laugh*<br><br>But seriously, a lot of canon characters would probably be pleased. Imagine if your life was a canon, and people wrote stories about you and your friends and enemies. Wouldn&#39;t you just be against the concept of fanfiction entirely? Well, maybe you wouldn&#39;t (I don&#39;t know you), but some people would be, and that&#39;s how the canons would react. Maybe the course coordinators or some of the minor characters who don&#39;t get touched in fanfic wouldn&#39;t want fanstudents to give up on writing, but a large portion of the staff might not mind.<br><br>However, out of universe, when the PPC and OFUs encounter badfic authors they try to encourage them to improve, not to give up. So an OFU will try to convey that. Although the exchange might go:<br><br>Canon character: A student in my class has decided to give up fanfic entirely! Yay! One less badfic writer to deal with!<br><br>Course coordinator: Yes, but we believe everyone has the potential to improve, and we&#39;re trying to help them do that. Try to teach them that, okay? I know it&#39;s hard, but then we&#39;ll have more goodfic writers in the long run.<br><br>Canon character: Well, okay. That doesn&#39;t mean I have to like it, though.<br><br>That&#39;s my experience, anyway...it really depends on what canon you&#39;re talking about. Me, I write for Star Trek, and that continuum was one of the first to get fanfiction and therefore the characters don&#39;t want to deal with the growing fanbase of writers, but those in an underappreciated fandom might value every writer they get.<br><br>I hope that makes sense...</p>

            <p>Recently I have seen Man of Steel, Pacific Rim, and the teaser trailer for How to Train Your Dragon 2, and I have something to say.<br><br>I perceive every single one of them to be a badfic magnet.<br><br>Having Pacific Rim, I can definitely say that far too many badfic authors will decide it is worth their time to try and cash into some of the mind-blowingly awesome fight scenes. Plus, someone had the gall to pair a Japanese lady with a 2500 ton robot.

            <p>I mean, historical fandoms, I understand. But it has been <i>very</i> solidly established that Sherlock Holmes <b> does not exist </b> in the Whoniverse.

            <p><i>Doctor Who</i> is way too easy to write bad crossover for. The TARDIS kind of lends itself to that, though I&#39;m sure she would object to the use Suethors make of her.</p>

            <p>Personally, I&#39;m apprehensive about some of the crossover action that is sure to be caused by Pacific Rim, judging by the Internet traffic. Everyone seems to want their pairing- whether a Sue is involved or not- to be drift compatible, and it will be far too easy to twist personalities and canon to suit their ideals.<br><br>A lot of the fic is sure to be great. Some of it, however, will almost definitively need surveillance.</p>

Aside from the obviously silly things—the name, having a prophecy about her, being a metamorphmagus on top of being a parselmouth (which actually makes sense if Voldemort is her father), liking bands and TV shows that don&#39;t exist yet, etc.—I think the setup makes enough sense to work as an AU and doesn&#39;t throw Voldemort too OOC, and the actual behavior of Cyretnizzy and Meagan strikes me as believable for their situation.<br><br>The biggest problem I&#39;m seeing is that we&#39;re being instructed to think that Cyret&#39;s mom is bad for not loving her and that Cyret is pure good, despite having hateful (but understandable!) feelings of wanting to hurt the mother who&#39;s been hurting her by withholding affection her whole life. Take out the silliness and the narrative force-feeding us what to think from the get-go, and there could really be a story here, with the theme of choice that&#39;s so important to the Potterverse. Will Cyret overcome her heritage and poor upbringing and choose forgiveness over bitterness and hate, or will her mother&#39;s fears be the real prophecy that comes true? That, my friends, is an interesting character dilemma.<br><br>Also, and perhaps most importantly, it looks like the author is open to concrit. Let&#39;s give her some, yes?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Agreed.  Having attempted to look past the name, I can see now that the &#39;fic itself is actually not that terrible.  I would concrit, but I think that someone who is better at recognizing the good and bad points and formatting concrit should probably do that.  I&#39;m not suggesting that multiple people shouldn&#39;t try to help, though.</p>

            <p>I apologize if I made it seem as though there was a concrete wall around the entire subject - we have a lot of PPCers who are Tropers, and I rather like the site in general myself. I have a habit of speaking very strongly about and in arguments, as if there was some kind of absolute answer to which I was privy, and that is obviously not the case. There&#39;s nothing wrong with bringing things up for discussion - for all I know, there&#39;s a lot of support for this idea, and the winds have shifted.<br><br>Really, all I&#39;m asking is that you wait for more community input before going ahead. And respond to people who disagree with you, not just people who agree with you. How can we have a discussion if people stick to &quot;agree&quot; or &quot;flee/ignore&quot; settings? Civil disagreement is possible and encouraged on this site, and always will be.</p>

            <p>I am choosing to remain Anonymous for this post, for which I hope I will be forgiven.  I don&#39;t wish my words here to poison my interactions with PPCers outside this thread, as this may be somewhat inflammatory.  Rest assured - I am not some random passing troll - I&#39;ve been here several years, and authored a number of Missions.  That said, I remain Anon.<br><br>From what I&#39;ve seen, serious issues here at the PPC tend to get either swept under the rug and Not Talked About (Which does nothing but spawn passive-aggressive pissing matches) or just slammed down by one or two people.  It seems like a small number of people come out and bang the hammer down, and everyone who disagrees gets shouted down.  I don&#39;t like that.  If this is truly a community of friends, there should <i>never</i> be an issue about which a civil conversation cannot be had.  <br><br>My problem, I guess, is that there is <i>no</i>body around here whose word is law.

This is not, and has never been, the case.<br><br>Sorry for the off-topic.

            <p>It seems to me that part of the problem was when Tawaki and Laburnum were the main PPCers that edited the TvTropes page. However, Laburnum has pretty much faded out of the PPC (unless I&#39;m missing something) and Tawaki, as far as I&#39;m aware, isn&#39;t an active PPC writer any more, so perchance a cleanup of the page is in order, whether someone writes a Characters page or not. That said, I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s a bad idea, aside from it stepping on some people&#39;s toes (I remember some people being vehemently opposed to Tropers being PPCers and vice versa, but that&#39;s in the past, I hope).</p>

            <p>The problem I am talking about was not Tawaki and Laburnum&#39;s entries on TVT.  Wanting to make the article a better reflection of the PPC, as a whole, was what started the event, but it wasn&#39;t the problem.  The problem was really the result of that cleanup.<br><br>What happened was that a fairly large group of PPCers (mainly from the chat, I believe) got together to make the page more representative of the PPC as a whole.  They added things, deleted things, and edited more things.  TV Tropes did not like this.  They reverted a lot of the edits and accused us of trying cover up our real image (the &quot;whitewashing&quot; in the article).  Words were exchanged, someone got banned from TV Tropes (I don&#39;t know who) and it really just left a bad taste in peoples&#39; mouths.<br><br>So, yes, a cleanup of the page is in order.  However, it would probably not be in order if TV Tropes admins had just allowed us to clean it up the last time.<br><br>-Phobos, who is not fond of TVT Admins, but doesn&#39;t mind Tropers in general.</p>

            <p>Whilst the PPC page on Tvtropes did initially spark my interest in the PPC I&#39;m probably one of those rare tropers who was already writing fanfcition by the time I found the page (and after I found it and the wiki I quickly started to tidy up my own writing which was on the edge of becoming badfic).<br><br>Ignoring that rambling my point is that whilst writing about those characters would be nice, it&#39;s considered polite and proper to ask those whom the characters belong to whether you can use their characters (unless you&#39;re using a disclaimer) and that&#39;s where I think you&#39;re more likely to run into a problem. </p>

            <p>Also (a good point for it) is that if the majority of the PPC page on Tvtropes hasn&#39;t been written with the original series or the more mainline characters in mind (and seeing as more people are using Tvtropes as a way into the PPC) then by doing a characters page with the more mainline PPC Agents in it would allow any Tropers looking at coming into the PPC a chance to see what the majority of Agents etc. are based upon rather than two of the more &#39;outsider&#39; Agents. <br>Also by adding more content to the page the admins of Tvtropes can hardly complain about it being &#39;whitewashed&#39; can they? Because whoever&#39;s adding the information in is doing exactly that, whilst keeping the Tvtropes Admins happy because the main page isn&#39;t being messed around with so much. </p>

            <p>I&#39;d like to point out that, although there&#39;s obviously not much anyone can do to <i>stop</i> you, this is something that bears more discussion before someone leaps in to do it. One of the major things that came out of the debacle that Phobos mentioned above was, IIRC, the idea that as a community, we should talk about things before one or two people grabs the bit in their teeth and runs off to just <i>do</i> them. I&#39;d really appreciate it if you could consider other viewpoints on this.<br><br>For example, there are Communal-ish characters, like the SO and the Marquis, or Makes-Things, who are up for people to drop into their stories without a lot of asking. But for the most part, PPC characters are held by their original authors, and used <i>only</i> with their original authors&#39; consent. So to make a real TvT &quot;PPC Characters&quot; page that <i>actually reflected the organisation</i>, you&#39;d have to do a whole lot of asking and discussing and explaining and a <i>whole lot</i> of reading, because if you&#39;re going to include a character, you&#39;d darn well better have read the spin-offs they inhabit. (All of them would be preferable.) And there are people who, quite simply, do not want their characters on TvTropes.<br><br>One person, anyway. I just plain don&#39;t want my team on there, and someone just tossing Jof on alone, because they can, would seriously irritate me. So unless you are prepared to go on a long, <i>long</i> campaign of tracking down authors and asking their specific permission to use the characters they&#39;ve come up with, I recommend you take a long moment to listen to the various voices of the people around. <i>All</i> of them, not just the ones agreeing with you.</p>

            <p>I agree with you in the fact that whoever does this, if it ever does actually happen would have to ask a lot of people for permission to include their characters (and everything else that would come with it), if that got the go ahead and everything, then it would be a very good idea to implement it. However as you&#39;ve said the amount of time to organize something like this would be huge and if something like this did happen it would be a big enough change that I think most of the community should/would have to agree to it before it went ahead.<br><br>My overall stance on this is if enough people can get behind the idea (this includes people with Agents and not just pure Boarders) then go for it, otherwise it&#39;d be a waste. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been avoiding writing this for <s>a day or so</s> a few weeks. But someone finally gave me a <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=246558;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">straight line</a>, and so I guess I can&#39;t put it off anymore.<br><br><i>Warning: this is going to be a Serious post, it is going to drone on for a long time, and it is about important, non-fictional stuff that I&#39;d like you all to read anyway</i>. The topics I&#39;d like to cover are, in no particular order:<br>-whether the Constitution needs to be updated or not.<br>-the fact that it is not okay to ignore the Constitution at one&#39;s convenience<br>-where the boundaries between the IRC and the &#39;Board are, where they should be, and how, exactly, we plan to deal with that as a community.<br><br>The first thing I&#39;d like to cover, actually, is the boundary (or boundaries) between the IRC and the &#39;Board, mainly because I&#39;d like to forestall replies to this post regarding that. The stuff involving the IRC can be found <a href="http://ppc-posting-board-2-proto.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. (There may be a small bit of a wait while the server warms up, not more than a minute.) (Edit the second: yeah, I haven&#39;t put that up yet. If somebody else wants to start it, I&#39;d be much obliged.)<br><br>Now... let&#39;s talk about the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">Constitution</a>. The reason we have it, in the language used thereon, is &quot;in order to form a more perfect Community, ensure domestic Tranquility, encourage the destruction of Badfic, promote Goodfic, and secure a certain level of wellbeing and (in)sanity for ourselves and those who will come after.&quot;<br><br>Let me clarify something, here. At the <i>very top of the &#39;Board</i>, there is a link to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">Constitution</a>, followed by the explanation: &quot;All your posts should conform to the Constitution. Read this first, and read it often.&quot; This, I think, is pretty self-evident. Follow the Constitution while posting here. There is ALSO a link to the Constitution located under the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_IRC_Rules">IRC Rules</a>, and IRC Rule 0 is to abide by the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">Constitution</a>. <i>By posting and chatting in this community, you implicitly agree to abide by that document</i>.<br><br>If you have a problem with that, please, please, <i>please</i> speak up. The reason why we have the version of the Constitution that we do now is that people <i>spoke up</i> about issues that needed to be resolved, and how they were uncomfortable with some actions that were allowed under the old version. This is <i>important</i>. It is not okay, it is <i>never</i> okay, for anyone to simply ignore the Constitution. It IS okay for them to say &quot;I feel that this clause/article isn&#39;t being upheld, can we do something about that?&quot; It IS okay for them to say, &quot;I think there&#39;s a loophole in the Constitution that allows a certain kind of bullying, can we do something about that?&quot;<br><br>See, here&#39;s the thing. The translation of that whole long phrase about &#39;forming a more perfect community, enusring domestic tranquility... and securing a certain level of wellbeing,&#39; that boils down to one very simple purpose. To <i>get along with each other</i>. To avoid hurting each other&#39;s feelings, stepping on each other&#39;s toes, allowing bullying to sneak under the radar, lashing out because of miscommunications, etc.<br><br>So with all of that in mind... it has come to my attention, recently, that some folks have felt like the Constitution does not fully protect them or help them, or that there are issues with it. Again, <i>the solution to this is not to ignore it</i>. I understand that sometimes, we all lose our tempers. Sometimes, we all feel hurt by the things our fellow community-members say. What I ask you all to remember, is  that <i>everyone has feelings</i>. You are not the only person who gets angry; I am not the only person who gets offended. So we&#39;re clear: <i>everyone&#39;s</i> feelings matter on this site and in this community. There are no exceptions to that rule. That is the reason why we have the Constitution - so that <i>everyone&#39;s</i> feelings are protected, rather than any group that happens to be a majority.<br><br>Now there&#39;s one final thing I&#39;d like to address. I&#39;ve seen a lot of examples of this in the past month or so, and it is <i>beginning</i> to bother me. You are allowed to dislike other people on this &#39;Board, and you are allowed to dislike the tone in which they normally write. Obviously, we are all welcome to our own thoughts! To imply otherwise would be absurd. What is <i>absolutely not okay</i>, is attacking other people because of their tone. If you have a problem with someone&#39;s tone, to the point where you are upset and offended, say something - something that <i>conforms to the rules of the Constitution</i>, and please, while conforming to the Constitution, explain exactly what it is that upset you.<br><br>If you have read through this entire post without glancing through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">Constitution</a>, I urge you to please do so now. If you have a problem with it, speak up. If you don&#39;t, but you do feel that you have something to add, speak up anyway.</p>

            <p>Specifically, that it takes both sides participating equally to resolve a problem. I hope I&#39;m not overstepping myself if I elaborate.<br><br>There&#39;s a tool we use in the UU young adult cons I attend. Basically, it boils down to this:<br><br><i>Person A accidentally says something that offends or hurts their friend, Person B.</i><br><br>1. Person B says, &quot;Hey, that thing you said hurt me.&quot;<br>2. Person A says, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to hurt you. I meant something else.&quot;<br>3. Person B says, &quot;I understand that you didn&#39;t mean it. I forgive you, but try not to say that again, okay?&quot;<br>4. Person A says, &quot;Okay, I promise.&quot;<br><br><i>The conflict is resolved, Persons A and B are still friends. (Optional hugs here.)</i><br><br>I realize this is extremely simplified, and that real life is more complicated; and this does presume that both parties are acting in good faith and desire to come to a mutually satisfactory understanding. Because assuming good faith is part of our Constitution, I think this process can be applied to us.<br><br>I&#39;ve seen too many conversation breakdowns happen at step 3. Specifically, Person B does not accept Person A&#39;s apology for whatever reason, and no forgiveness is offered. This makes it impossible for the conversation to move forward. Person B still feels hurt, Person A is unable to atone for it. No one is happy, and no one can fix it. This is a bad, unfair situation.<br><br>Conflict resolution takes two. Person A must be willing to accept responsibility and apologize for what they said, Person B must be willing to accept their apology and let everyone move on. Both parties must do their part for a mutually satisfactory resolution to be possible.<br><br>That&#39;s what I believe.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>*hugs*<br><br>I&#39;m not surprised that came from UUs. We make such an effort to have open-minded communication. And we&#39;re a community that has discussions about how to open-mindedly discuss things.<br><br>This reminds me of the reason I don&#39;t like Serious Business threads. I usually just lurk - I read through, sigh, and move on to the newest fun thread. <br><br>I joined the PPC because it felt nice. We have a constitution, we have rules governing the way we spork, all to ensure that we have a safe community and are promoting good ideas in our writing. While other people may not like the restrictions on what to spork, I like that we say that you can&#39;t insult the author, that you shouldn&#39;t spork slash if you don&#39;t like some of it, that you should only spork the worst of the worst, to remember YKINMK, etc. It&#39;s in line with my UU values, is what I&#39;m saying here. <br><br>And then whenever a Serious Business topic comes up, everybody gets all defensive and close-minded. People think of only their opinion and not of others. It bothers me to see that, since I joined because it seemed a fun, open-minded community dedicated to making good fanfiction out of bad.<br><br>And, I feel, the best way to do something about it is to not be a part of it - don&#39;t just try to check other people, try to check yourself. I think a lot of the time, people just post without thinking things through. (I&#39;m assuming good faith here.) Take some time to think about what you say, to fully form your opinions, to consider how it might affect people. If we all do that, we&#39;ll have the awesomest community ever.<br><br>I hope this makes sense. I try.<br></p>

            <p>Ableism is discrimination towards people who may be described as disabled - not &quot;able-bodied&quot;, essentially.

Every time something like this comes up, people get tense, edgy, and feel like they&#39;re being blamed, even if there&#39;s no blaming going on, or even if they&#39;re not actually involved with whatever the issue actually is. (*raises hand* Guilty as charged.) Someone will say something that sets everyone else off and there&#39;s a massive thread, maybe two, filled with fighting, and then people leave because they&#39;re feeling like they&#39;re being picked on, and everyone feels miserable because that wasn&#39;t what we were trying to achieve.<br><br>And this kind of thing generally makes me want to run and hide and not say anything until all the bad feelings everywhere go away and all the awesome people* stop being upset with each other.

            <p>Your behavior is one of the &quot;incidents&quot; about which I was talking. Being consistently rude to people is not &quot;tone,&quot; it&#39;s... being consistently rude to people. Which you were, on the IRC. You haven&#39;t done it as much on the &#39;Board, so people here may not be aware of it, but the number of times I saw you cut people off or tell them their opinions were stupid, is pretty high - and then there was the time you said something directly threatening to someone with whom you disagreed. Each time you were called out, you either got defensive or apologized - and, after a brief reprieve, came back and eventually did the same things.<br><br>You&#39;re not a non-person. You&#39;re a person who breaks the Constitution consistently, and one of the people I was addressing very nearly directly with &quot;You don&#39;t get to be a jerk to people just because you&#39;re feeling emotional.&quot; Or however I phrased it. I&#39;m tired of making general &quot;People be nice to each other&quot; announcements that get general nods from everyone... and then the people who actually need to change their behavior never do.<br><br>So, for the record, it&#39;s you I was addressing. And Tray, and mPoet, though I know neither of them are on here much anymore - because leaving the &#39;Board alone does not exempt anyone from the Constitution, just as being banned from the IRC does not exempt you from the Constitution here on the &#39;Board. All three of your behavior has fallen outside the rules of the Constitution which, just to reiterate, boil down to BE NICE TO EACH OTHER.<br><br>I supported your being banned from the IRC for a not-insignificant amount of time. Although I am glad you have reined in your behavior somewhat on this particular facet of the community, I remain unconvinced of your sincerity as concerns following the rules of this community, especially since to my knowledge, you have not at any point made an effort to apologize to the person you threatened.<br><br>(For the record, to anyone who feels like they&#39;ve been a jerk or broken the Constitution - apologizing is a <i>really good</i> first step towards not-breaking-the-Constitution, as well as generally having better community relations. The next step is following through on that apology and making a serious and continual effort to improve your behavior.)</p>

            <p>It is good that you are saying you want to apologize. But I admit I&#39;m a bit skeptical. It was months ago that you were kicked from the chat. You came back numerous times in efforts to skirt the ban, and sat in the chat for a few periods of time without saying anything - not saying &quot;Hi, I&#39;m just here to apologize,&quot; just a handful of one-line responses until you were kicked again. The times that you&#39;ve pm&#39;d folks from the chat, no one has reported that you were looking to apologize, more that you were expressing angst and grievances - including the time you talked to me. Which is, more or less, the same thing you&#39;ve been doing whenever you hit conflict for the past few years.<br><br>I finally looked up the record the DAs had of the incident that had you banned, and unfortunately, the person who you threatened is no longer around on the IRC, for different reasons. So I&#39;m honestly not sure how to proceed from here. If you honestly want to fix things, maybe you can. I don&#39;t know. I just know that I&#39;m skeptical of just saying &quot;Oh, you say you&#39;ll stop! Okay, let&#39;s lift the ban!&quot; Because this has happened before - it&#39;s why we set up so many temp bans, to give people more chances. You&#39;ve been temp-banned from the chat <i>multiple times</i> for your behavior. It&#39;s been a few months now, so maybe you really do want to change this time. I don&#39;t know.<br><br>What I do know is that we don&#39;t have framework for &quot;Maybe&quot; situations in this community. We have &quot;You have officially crossed the line we&#39;re okay with, and you are banned from the PPC&quot; messages, but we&#39;ve never really talked about &quot;You are banned, come back when you&#39;re ready to stop being a jerk and start participating&quot; messages. Maybe it&#39;s time we did that.</p>

            <p>Just thought I&#39;d say that I personally think that the Constitution is pretty clear on the whole &#39;getting along with each other&#39; thing.

            <p>Allow me to reiterate what are, to me, the most salient points of what VM just said.<br><br>We have a Constitution for a reason, kids, learn it, love it, live by it.  Or at least post by it.  In light of recent(ish) events, I point specifically to <br><br><b>5. All respectful opinions that do not attack, insult, or persecute others (see Article 1) are welcome. We encourage respectful, friendly debates here. Should a debate escalate into an argument for any reason, everyone involved should step back and calm down before continuing. If this cannot be done, it may be best to abandon the conversation entirely.<br><br>6. Everyone in the PPC Community should be respected as people, regardless of who they are. The opinions of a newbie are just as valid and wanted as those of someone here for four years. Everyone deserves respect until they show themselves to be unashamedly disrespectful themselves, which means people who show disrespect and discrimination as per Article 1 do not warrant respect based on those views. However, not warranting respect does not mean they do not warrant politeness. This means you are not allowed to descend into flaming and insulting them, but instead should follow Article 9.</b><br><br>Also, something I&#39;ve noticed is that people here seem to go from &#39;just fine&#39; to &#39;Full Flame Mode&#39; in a matter of 2-3 posts.  <i>This is unacceptable.</i> This is not a community for shouting, for name-calling, for any sort of flaming whatsoever, period, the end, no exceptions.  If someone posts something that offends you, you do <i>not</i> have <i>carte blanche</i> to respond in a way that offends <i>them</i>.  Especially if it offends everyone else in the process.  If you absolutely <i>MUST</i> speak your mind, do so via e-mail.  <br><br>Finally, I hate watching my friends fight.  And I do, rightly or wrongly, consider each and every one of you a friend.  But what I hate <i>worse</i> is watching friendships break down because, in the aftermath of a fight, people stop talking to each other.  There&#39;s no reconciliation, there&#39;s no discussion.  Most times, people simply stop speaking, and their friendship withers.  It kills me to watch that happen.  So please, don&#39;t do it, for your own sake, and everyone else&#39;s.  Talking helps.</p>

            <p>Hi all,<br>I&#39;m fairly new, and I&#39;m pretty sure that this is my first new thread. I know that Harry Poter is the most popular fandom on the Pit. Consequently, there are a whole lot of badfics. I was browsing and found a Hermione/Bellatrix LEMON. Ugh. But m point is that we make the most of it. If we all claim a Harry Potter badfic and get permission to spork it, we can hold a little competition and give out writing tips. Is this a good idea?</p>

            <p>Perhaps not for right now, but:<br><br>We have a game called <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Fill_the_Plothole">Fill the Plothole</a> wherein someone posts a selection of funny or odd fanfic summaries on the Board, and people write short stories based on any of the summaries that strike their fancy, &quot;filling the plothole&quot; of the summary in the process. Usually these end up being humorous, but they don&#39;t have to be. You can see examples from previous games <a href="http://ppc-plotholes.livejournal.com/">here</a>.<br><br>It&#39;s not a competition and agents aren&#39;t involved,* but you could definitely pick all summaries from Potterverse fics if you wanted to start a game sometime.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>* Usually. People *coughmecough* have used FtP as a platform to write mini faux-missions, but that&#39;s not the point of the game. At all.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s pretty much as simple as it sounds. Someone goes onto fanfic.net or wherever, looks through the categories for likely summaries, and copies &amp; pastes the most bizarre, entertaining, or otherwise intriguing of them into a post. Just the titles and summaries—the actual content of the fic doesn&#39;t matter. Then, the Boarders who want to play look at the summaries, pick one that gives them an idea (usually something that attempts to make the summary make sense, &quot;filling the plothole&quot;), and write a short story based on it, which they post in a reply to the original post. It&#39;s a good idea for them to include the title and summary they&#39;re using so we know what their prompt was. The rest of us read, react, and perhaps respond. People can respond to as many of the summary prompts as they want, and the person who starts the game can also participate, so it&#39;s truly all-inclusive. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>There are some merits to what you are proposing.  Encouraging people to write is always fun.  We&#39;ve had writing contests before, with varying degrees of success.  So the idea can definitely work.  I would just caution you on a couple of things.<br><br>First off, being as specific as which fandom to write in might turn people off of the idea.  Some people may not like Harry Potter, or they may want to do something else.  Widening the focus a little might not be a bad idea.<br><br>Secondly, your idea hinges on everyone getting permission, which is unrealistic.  There are going to be a few people who just are not ready for it.  So, I would again shift the focus to something that doesn&#39;t require permission.  This will allow everyone to participate.<br><br>Thirdly, while you may get some people to participate for writing tips (hS runs a writing challenge that runs on everyone involved giving concrit to at least one other participant), you might have better luck with some other type of incentive.<br><br>Really, all of that is logistical.  If you can find a way to make it work, then there is no reason not to give it a try.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>What do you mean by &quot;normal spork permission&quot;?  We only have one type of permission in the PPC.  You only need permission to write in the PPC&#39;s shared world, so writing an MST or any other kind of sporking doesn&#39;t need anyone to sign off.<br><br>As for incentives, offering to review a future story, draw a picture, or beta for people have all worked in the past.  The problem is that the best incentives tend to be time consuming.  Maybe you can come up with something that will interest people, that doesn&#39;t take forever to get done.<br><br>Just think about what people want, make sure it is something you can do, and find a way to give them that as a reward.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I hate you.<br><br>No, that&#39;s too harsh. It&#39;s true that there is bad fanfic on the &#39;net, and despite me disliking your methods, it does need to be dealt with by SOMEONE. In addition, I can&#39;t really go around saying I hate &#39;you&#39; - that&#39;s hating everyone in the PPC, despite never having met you. Besides, we ARE all fans, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t read fanfic and you wouldn&#39;t want to defend it. So it isn&#39;t apples and oranges as much as Protestants and Catholics...bad example, sorry. <br><br>I suppose a more accurate message would be:<br>I hate the PPC organisation.<br><br>I hate their methods, of making sarky comments rather than sitting down to review a work (Yes, I am well aware of MST, and hold the same opinion of it. Snarking is fine as part of a review, but when a work is laughed at simply because you can be snarky about it - well, you can do that with ANYTHING, irrespective of quality. The fact that iRiffs of the Dark Knight and The Avengers exist are proof enough of that - just being able to riff on something doesn&#39;t make it bad). <br><br>I despise their totally rigid view of canon, which refuses to consider any opinion other than the author&#39;s to be of any   worth. I&#39;m citing Death of the Author on this one, as well as Joss Whedon: &quot;All worthy work is open to interpretations the author did not intend. Art isn&#39;t your pet -- it&#39;s your kid. It grows up and talks back to you.&quot; The fact is that what you you and the author see in their story is never the same - you are your own person, with biases and quirks that affect your interpretation of stories as with all forms of art. If you thought that Snape was an abusive teacher who should have been in prison long ago (for example), and you can defend that adequately by referring to the source material, then you should have a right to believe that no matter what JKR says. Whereas your wiki sums up your position nicely - &#39;Even stupid canon must be defended&#39;. Yes, no matter how idiotic it may be, just happening to be the guy (or woman) who made it makes your opinion more valid than anyone else&#39;s. Hey, some advice - if you want your audience to believe something about your story, put it in the story.<br><br>And finally...you dun goofed. I don&#39;t know how long ago this was written without anyone catching it, but in a spork of a HP fic called I believe &#39;Shalt Not Suffer&#39; (I couldn&#39;t find it on FF, so the story may have been taken down, and there were too damn many HP sporkings for me to find it on your end), the writers totally misunderstood the fic and I believe persecuted it unfairly. I know that people make mistakes, but that sporking was written years ago and still stands uncorrected.<br><br>Also - dudes, you need a better messaging board.<br><br>...Sigh. Totally predictable response from posting this somewhere fans and writers of the PPC gather in 3...2...<br><br>Just know that I&#39;m not out to personally insult you - I just don&#39;t like what you stand for.</p>

            <p>As was wisely pointed out by Elcalion, the more recent thread &quot;If you can stomach the Inheritance Cycle...&quot; pertains pretty directly to this discussion, especially on the idea of rigidity. As you can see there, not everyone in the PPC shares the same opinions of badfic, and we aren&#39;t so &#39;rigid&#39; that we&#39;ll spork a fic that doesn&#39;t truly, truly, truly deserve it just because of canon breaks, SPaG errors, clichés, OOCness, and other elements that could be charges should a fic actually be sporked. In fact, as is also exhibited in that particular thread, we often go by how something makes us feel as opposed to strict, &#39;rigid&#39; analysis.<br>The PPC is fun, as many others have already said. It&#39;s not a real organization, and it&#39;s certainly not rigid- or if it is, it&#39;s not meant to be.<br><br>-- Len</p>

            <p>Hey. I see where you&#39;re coming from, I think. If I&#39;m understanding what you&#39;re saying, it&#39;s that you don&#39;t like that we snark at stories rather than just review them.<br><br>The thing is though... there really isn&#39;t a &quot;PPC Organization&quot;. We&#39;re a community of writers who enjoy reading fanfiction and writing fanfiction, and just being fans in general.<br><br>Bad fanfiction doesn&#39;t NEED to be dealt with; we do what we do because we care about the canons, we enjoy good stories, and we just like having fun. By writing missions, we basically combine writing a story and writing a review of a fic while doing it in a way that makes people laugh.<br><br>You say you despise &#39;their&#39; totally rigid view of canon. Who are you referring to? The PPC started in the early 2000s with two writers. Since then, there have been many many spinoffs, each with different writers behind them.<br><br>Yes, most of us consider the author of the work&#39;s word on their creation to be the final one. If it&#39;s up in the air, then we -or at least me, personally- take fanon and fan theories into consideration. Like, a character&#39;s motives, for example. If they aren&#39;t stated in canon, and it&#39;s just guessing on the fanon&#39;s part, then we take that into consideration. <br><br>Yes, people DO interpret stories differently. But we aren&#39;t telling people what to think. If that person thought that Snape was an abusive teacher, then fine. Good on them! But where we draw the line is when Snape stops acting in-character. In the books, Snape never physically attacked a student. If he&#39;s doing that in the fic, then we comment on it.<br><br>And yeah, we do need a better messaging board. I agree.<br><br>So, Polite Dissent, have our responses been what you thought they were going to be?<br><br>Finally, thanks for telling us what you think in a respectful manner like you have. To me, the PPC is about writing fun stories with friends and poking fun at bad fan fiction, while improving our own skills as writers.</p>

            <p>Our audience is, basically, us.  We write for our own fellow PPCers to read.<br><br>I know your very presence here is proving me wrong, but I very strongly doubt the majority of missions get seen by anyone outside the PPC community.  This is especially true in recent years, when posting PPC stories to fanfiction.net has fallen out of favor.  Most of our new members nowadays are folks who stumble across the TV Tropes article about us.<br><br>So when you say, &quot; . . . anyone who reads and likes the PPC will probably judge fanfiction they read according to your standards,&quot; I can only think, &quot;If they read and like a PPC mission, they probably already had similar standards and biases.&quot;  Just as you read some missions and didn&#39;t enjoy them, since they don&#39;t fit your view of proper reviews.<br><br>Also, if I may expand on the &quot;writing for our own community&quot; theme, part of the reason we write for and post within our own group is because <i>the PPC is its own canon.</i>  The creators are also the fans!  The fictional organization itself has a history, and individual spinoffs and agents have their own storylines.  I can&#39;t say this is true for every PPC writer, but many use missions as merely part of the setting for their characters to grow in and advance their plots.  All this becomes another stumbling block against non-PPC readers, as the unfamiliar details of the PPC canon would make any given story much harder to follow and understand for anyone outside the community.<br><br>To summarize, we&#39;re telling our own story to ourselves, and it&#39;s not really intended or designed to be easily digested by folks not familiarized with that story&#39;s content.</p>

            <p>Okay. Here is my polite dissent. I hope you don&#39;t mind.<br><br>You are taking the PPC too seriously. The PPC is not an academic organization. It is not a political, religious, or lobbying organization. It does not exist to provide any kind of serious critique or analysis. Your entire argument seems to consist of, &quot;I don&#39;t like that you&#39;re not serious reviewers, and I just don&#39;t like you.&quot; <br><br>And... what? What&#39;s the next step here? You don&#39;t like the PPC, but the PPC likes itself just fine. Since you dislike everything about the PPC, I can&#39;t see any suggestions you might have being terribly useful. Now that you&#39;ve got this off your chest, maybe you could create a website or blog to get your dissent out there? Otherwise I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re just wasting your time here. I still don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re trying to do, but good luck anyway!<br><br>p.s. Anyone who reads the PPC is going to pick up their biases? Like some kind of contagious disease? I know a lot of readers are young, but isn&#39;t critical thinking taught in high schools these days? Do you really absorb all the biases of the authors of the works you read? If so, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve got a very confusing life ahead of you!</p>

            <p>I think that what you&#39;re missing, as Lenore said below, is that not every AU and crossover are bad. Take <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7485060/1/Game-Theory">&quot;Game Theory&quot;</a> for example. It&#39;s an AU - there&#39;s no doubting that - but it&#39;s such a well-written, engrossing AU that I doubt that any of the resident <i>Nanoha</i> fans (me, Sergio Turbo and firemagic, IIRC) would ever dare to mission it. Or, for example, <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7376706/1/Faker-of-the-Rings">&quot;Faker of the Rings&quot;</a>, which is a <i>Fate/stay night</i> x <i>Lord of the Rings</i> crossover. It&#39;s crack, and it exaggerates the characters quite a lot, but, again, I doubt anyone would spork it, because it&#39;s well-written and funny.<br>That said, kudos for being reasonable and listening to what Nesh had to say.</p>

            <p>Having not written any missions myself, my feedback doesn&#39;t really hold a whole lot of weight experience-wise, but I can see why you&#39;d think that PPC methods are a little caustic. I&#39;ve thought it, too. The point of the snarky sporking missions, I believe, is simply to make elimination of badfic more entertaining than writing review after review that the author won&#39;t listen to nine times out of ten. And in fact I&#39;ve seen PPCers leave long, detailed, and cheerful critical reviews on stories, before or after sporking. We do that too.<br><br>You have a point about canon. The rigidity doesn&#39;t really allow for things like AUs, but then again, the PPC wouldn&#39;t spork a well-written AU. I think that breaking canon as a charge is used more to show that a Mary Sue (or similar offender) is disproportionately warping the plot, which is often what makes a character a Sue. (Since that didn&#39;t make much sense right there, I wrote an article explaining that theory. It&#39;s on my blog.)<br><br>So I suppose what I&#39;m saying here is that I can perfectly sympathize with you, and I&#39;m glad that you openly criticized the PPC if you had an issue with it. I think it was brave, and I admire you for being able to say &quot;I hate you.&quot; and then proceed to offer reprimand that was not a flame. But in general I think the reasoning on our side can be explained- if not by me, because I&#39;m not the best at explaining these things.<br><br>Yes, the methods are a little harsh. Maybe too harsh. That I can agree on, to an extent.<br><br>-- Len :D</p>

            <p>This is very strange. I did find what I thought was the fic that was sporked here on FF.net: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5176787/Thou-Shalt-Not-Suffer"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5176787/Thou-Shalt-Not-Suffer">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5176787/Thou-Shalt-Not-Suffer</a></a> .<br><br>However, the paragraphs that were misinterpreted are missing, suggesting that it was either edited afterwards, or I am thinking of a different fic. I&#39;ll describe what I remember anyway:<br><br>There is a Christian who gets her letter to Hogwarts. Obviously she is conflicted over this with the titular quote. Anyway, the important bit is that after she gets her books, her dad comes in to her room, and asks her not to read such things, which she agrees to. Later at Platform 9 3/4, she displays knowledge of the Wizarding World - I think the barrier. Her dad asks her how she knows what with her supposedly not reading the books, and -this is important- she replies &quot;Magic?&quot;, innocently. Key word there, innocently. The Agents went NUTS. They immediately and incorrectly assumed that she literally meant that magic reached out and put the knowledge into her head, screaming &quot;MAGIC DOESN&#39;T WORK THAT WAY!&quot;. I on the other hand got a totally different message - she read the books anyway and lied, hence the fic specifically noting the adjective &#39;innocently&#39;.<br><br>Anyway that&#39;s the fic I hold a grudge over, and it&#39;s why only now am I thinking of the PPC again. From what I recall, she went on to get a telling-off from McGonagall on diversity (pointing out that the Patil twins follow Hinduism, for example),and after agreeing that that was the best bit the agents tossed the protagonist into a volcano.</p>

            <p>And thanks to Storme Hawk, I did find the fic I was thinking of. And...MY GOD IS THIS FIC BAD - I had it confused for a better one. Still, there was a misinterpretation. Here is a quote from the sporking (<a href="http://www.keldale.f9.co.uk/tabularasa/mission2.htm"><a href="http://www.keldale.f9.co.uk/tabularasa/mission2.htm">http://www.keldale.f9.co.uk/tabularasa/mission2.htm</a></a>):<br><br>&quot;&quot;then how do you get to it?&quot; Stephen pressed.<br><br>&quot;The Barrier&quot; Ariana pointed to the barrier separating platforms nine and ten.<br><br>&quot;And just how do you know this, young lady?&quot; Patricia pressed, cocking an eyebrow at her Daughter.<br><br>&quot;Magic?&quot; Ariana Smiled innocently.<br><br>“Wrong, wrong, WRONG!” Foxglove hissed. “If it worked like that, why the hell did Harry have to ask Mrs Weasley? Did this author pay any attention at all?”<br><br>“If she had, she would know that Potterverse magic is a talent, not a religion, and therefore one cannot be converted out of it!” Laburnum growled through gritted teeth.&quot;<br><br>And here is the missing context (<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1485826/3/The-Christian-at-Hogwarts"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1485826/3/The-Christian-at-Hogwarts">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1485826/3/The-Christian-at-Hogwarts</a></a>):<br><br>&quot;Ariana sat in her bedroom, reading the extra books she&#39;d picked up. among the extras were &quot;Hogwarts, a History&quot;, &quot;a wizards guide to muggles&quot;, &quot;a muggleborns guide to wizardry&quot; and &quot;coming out of the closet to your muggle family&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ariana?&quot; Stephen knocked softly on the door as he walked in.<br><br>&quot;yeah dad?&quot; Ariana looked up from the third chapter of &quot;coming out of the closet to your muggle family&quot;: &#39;When mom refuses to accept.&#39;<br><br>&quot;Your Mother and I have been talking...about...School.&quot; he began slowly.<br><br>&quot;Yeah?&quot; Ariana asked, wanting him to get over whatever he was about to say so she could go back to her book.<br><br>&quot;we think it would be best if your wand, books and other...School Supplies are put away until term starts.<br><br>Cocking an eyebrow at her father, Ariana said nothing, but quietly put the books away.<br><br>&quot;Good Girl.&quot;&quot;<br><br>If you just see the sporking, you THINK that a huge canon break has being committed, when in reality it was an unexpected moment of subtlety. Badly spelt subtlety, but subtlety all the same.</p>

            <p>considering that the PPC tries to uphold canon.<br><br>I remember <br>- agents charging for “inventing tickets for the Hogwarts Express”. (Hagrid gave Harry his ticket in the first book.)<br>- agents saying that Hermione wasn’t fifteen years old at the Yule ball. (Her fifteenth birthday was in September of that year.)<br>- agents saying that there are four beds in a “standard-sized” dormitory at Hogwarts. (The only dormitory we have ever seen in canon had five beds, and we just don’t know whether there is a “standard size”.)<br><br>Nevertheless, I like the PPC, and I may join some day.

            <p>After a sleepless night, I just tried to check whether it was justified to blame &quot;agents&quot; for this one, and found it corrected. <br><br>From what I remembered, non-agent Phobos, who doesn’t need to know everything about a canon he was dropped into quite unexpectedly, might have been accountable, and &quot;Decima knew better, but didn’t comment on Phobos’ small mistake, because she was more concerned with the big offense of Ginny inexplicably getting a room on her own&quot; might have been a valid interpretation of your words. I would have spared me a lot of worry if I had looked it up before I posted.<br><br>Since we were talking about interpretations of authors’ words, may I point out that getting a room on her own isn’t really inexplicable in Ginny’s case? It was called &quot;<i>the sixth years girls dormitory</i>&quot;, not &quot;Ginny’s room&quot;, so the author may have expected all readers to understand that &quot;This is just a standard Hogwarts dormitory magically adapted to the number of Gryffindor girls in Ginny’s year,&quot; and this wouldn’t be a less valid interpretation of JKR’s words than &quot;There <b> are </b> other Gryffindor girls in Ginny’s year, we just didn’t ever see them,&quot; or &quot;Being the only Gryffindor girl in her year, Ginny was forced to share a dormitory with Hermione, Lavender and Parvati&quot;.  <br><br>Of course &quot;<i>Hermiones room</i>&quot; would be much harder to explain.<br></p>

            <p>OK, so I&#39;m new (relatively) and I may not speak for anyone else with what I&#39;m going to say but this is how I feel. <br><br>My main problem with your post (if problem is the right word) is your fourth paragraph (the one starting with &quot;I despise their totally rigid view of canon&quot;) As a RPer and a writer I use AU&#39;s and OC&#39;s on a daily basis, yet my stories haven&#39;t appeared on the PPC, nor have several of my favorite stories that are severely AU and breach Canon in way too many places to take count. Why? Because there are pieces of good fanfiction on the internet, stories that you can read and enjoy, stories that have a clear well defined plot, use Canon as enough of a basis to keep people happy and have decent SPaG. To be honest the majority of fanfiction breaches away from canon at some point or another, for whatever reason. You can&#39;t blame a fanfic for not complying with a canon Seventh Year and Epilogue for Harry Potter if it was written before the book came out can you? Nor can you really blame a writer if they want to explore a specific What If? question that could change all of Canon. <br><br>I personally think that as the Authors have finished each book they&#39;ve let us the readers play around with Canon as we want. But with this and posting your stories on the internet comes the responsibility to make sure that the stories are good enough for the internet, to be read as a whole. If it&#39;s good then that&#39;s fine, however it&#39;s only if it&#39;s quality is subpar that means the PPC get involved. I think you&#39;ve forgotten that, that the PPC does not restrict fanfictions from moving off of Canon in anyway, what it does is merely raises awareness of the bad fanfiction of the internet, and along with the OFU&#39;s gives those who have written the bad fanfics every chance to redeem themselves and tidy it up. OK so not everyone agrees and not everything will always work out, that&#39;s the way of life. <br>The other thing you&#39;ve got to remember is that the PPC Missions aren&#39;t deadly serious they&#39;re meant to be humourous parodies of the fanfiction, no matter how bad the fanfic is, take it with a pinch of salt and laugh if it&#39;s your sort of thing or turn away if it isn&#39;t.<br><br>I think I&#39;ve rambled on enough and possibly gone slightly off topic but anyway.<br>Two additional points.<br>1) Looked for &#39;Shalt Not Suffer&#39; on the wiki, couldn&#39;t find a fanfic with that name, but there was a Mission title with those words in it, it was for a fic named &#39;A Christian At Hogwarts&#39; didn&#39;t read the mission, but is that the one you were meaning?<br>2)I&#39;ve seen a lot worse discussion boards than this. Besides it does what it needs to do. I think the quote is &quot;If it ain&#39;t broke don&#39;t fix it&quot; which funnily enough pretty much sums up my base point (and makes the previous two paragraphs look silly in hindsight). The PPC isn&#39;t broken, people may not like it, but you&#39;re unlikely to find anything in the world that everyone likes. What matters is that something continues doing the job that the PPC is doing, so why change it?<br><br>As I said at the top, this is my opinion and whilst it may not be shared by anyone else it doesn&#39;t matter to me, because as has been repeated, everyone has their own opinion. If I do turn out to be a loner amongst Boarders then so be it, and if people want me off of here ASAP then fair enough. <br>Final point before I shut up (and everyone starts celebrating) I don&#39;t mean to offend anyone with my above post, if I have I&#39;m sorry and if alerted I won&#39;t do it again.<br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>(Wow, this reply took a while to write. If anybody else has said this, don&#39;t mind me.)<br><br>Um... Yeah, I think you&#39;ll forgive us if we don&#39;t take your assertion that this is &quot;polite dissent&quot; at your word, sir. Even if you meant the organization rather than the people in the PPC, it&#39;s still rude as hell to open an argument with &quot;I hate you&quot;.<br><br>Also, I&#39;m pretty sure that &quot;you dun goofed&quot; is only used in an ironically back-talking sense that is in no way meant to be polite.<br><br>Oh, and that &quot;expect the typical whiny response in 3, 2, 1&quot;? Also very rude, and almost kind of elitist in a way.<br><br>Oh, and the &quot;message board&quot; comment? Totally uncalled for. (By the way, we have had <i>many</i> debates about moving it. Many, many, <i>MANY</i> debates, some of which have caused blood to be shed and tears to be cried. Honestly, I don&#39;t care either way, as it&#39;s actually not a horrible message board.)<br><br>Yeah, you come in here saying you&#39;re &quot;polite dissent&quot; and then you go on to insult certain facets of the organization in a passive-aggresive manner. That&#39;s honestly not polite at all.<br><br>Just saying.<br><br>Of course, that has nothing to do with the argument you&#39;re postulating here, so we&#39;ll leave your wording choice at the door. So let&#39;s go down your points, shall we?<br><br>&quot;I hate their methods, of making sarky comments rather than sitting down to review a work. (...just being able to riff on something doesn&#39;t make it bad).&quot;<br><br>Roger Ebert would oftentimes review a bad movie by dealing snark at its general direction. You make the point of &quot;snark is independent from criticism&quot;, which is a valid point. <br><br>However, what you seem to miss in your point is an important distinction about quality: even when the work as a whole is good, there are sometimes still things about it that aren&#39;t really that great. You&#39;re arguing that making snarky comments about a work that is of <i>overall</i> high quality is the same as making snarky comments about a work that is of <i>overall</i> low quality.<br><br>To that end, let me ask you this: when some people make snark at something that&#39;s good, why is it that they generally go after the bits of the whole piece that don&#39;t work? Is making fun of the flaws of a good work fundamentally different from making fun of the flaws of a bad work? It&#39;s exactly your point, I know, but that&#39;s just the problem: when you snark at the flaws of a fundamentally bad work, there&#39;s much more to work with than there would be in something of higher quality.<br><br>I wonder what your opinion of stuff like the Nostalgia Critic and the Angry Video Game Nerd is. By the argument you present here, I get the feeling you don&#39;t like anything from those kinds of people.<br><br>&quot;I despise their totally rigid view of canon, which refuses to consider any opinion other than the author&#39;s to be of any worth.&quot;<br><br>This whole paragraph ignores one simple issue: while it is true that art does &quot;grow up and talk back to you&quot;, there <i>is</i> a limit to which you can stretch that quote. That point comes when the author produces information that points to a certain interpretation of anything relating to that canon. Hell, you even acknowledge this point when you say &quot;if you want your audience to believe something about your story, put it in the story&quot;. <br><br>The problem is that most authors of bad fanfiction choose to <i>ignore</i> when an author puts something into their story to steer an interpretation of a part of canon, whether it be conscious or not. That is the kind of interpretation we normally go after here at the PPC. Is it possible to come up with a fanfic that has good alternate interpretations of things found in the canon? Of course, and I have yet to see a fic that was sporked here in the negative because it just violated the canon. (Hell, we&#39;ve even had a mission that highlighted goodfic that involves an AU (and also MPreg) when the mission writers initially thought they found badfic. See here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K33i4NbxNThKEdfmacAA8pY04qPmENbAT0lBLaJoSXs/edit"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K33i4NbxNThKEdfmacAA8pY04qPmENbAT0lBLaJoSXs/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K33i4NbxNThKEdfmacAA8pY04qPmENbAT0lBLaJoSXs/edit</a></a> ) But that doesn&#39;t always happen with fanfiction, and it almost never happens in bad fanfiction.<br><br>Hence, our position of sticking mainly to what the author intended with that. Oftentimes, the fic authors will spend so little time justifying in-story decisions that contradict information the original author explicitly spelled out in the canon (that is, if they don&#39;t completely disrespect it entirely) that it will get to the point where the fic and the canon from which the fic derives inspiration don&#39;t seem to fit within the same universe. And when <i>that</i> happens, it&#39;s more like the kid that murders the parents rather than the kid who talks back to the parents.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know how long ago this was written without anyone catching it, but in a spork of a HP fic called I believe &#39;Shalt Not Suffer&#39; (I couldn&#39;t find it on FF, so the story may have been taken down, and there were too damn many HP sporkings for me to find it on your end), the writers totally misunderstood the fic and I believe persecuted it unfairly. I know that people make mistakes, but that sporking was written years ago and still stands uncorrected.&quot;<br><br>For that spork... I take it you&#39;re referring to this Foxglove and Laburnum mission, of which the full title is &quot;Thou Shalt Not Suffer A Sue To Live&quot;: <a href="http://www.keldale.f9.co.uk/tabularasa/mission2.htm"><a href="http://www.keldale.f9.co.uk/tabularasa/mission2.htm">http://www.keldale.f9.co.uk/tabularasa/mission2.htm</a></a> (The fic being sporked is actually still up on FF.net, by the way: you can find it here: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1485826/1/The-Christian-at-Hogwarts"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1485826/1/The-Christian-at-Hogwarts">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1485826/1/The-Christian-at-Hogwarts</a></a> The reason you couldn&#39;t find it is probably because it&#39;s hard to find Harry Potter fics that were published in 2003, so I won&#39;t dock you for that.) If this isn&#39;t actually the mission that you&#39;re referring to, you can skip this next part as it only applies to that. So to that end... cue the scene change things I use in my missions!<br><br>----**----<br><br>If you do say that the mission missed the point of the story, I can see why you might say that: the mission <i>does</i> show a scene later in the fic that actually isn&#39;t that bad. In fact, it involves something that could&#39;ve been interesting to explore: the identity crisis a Christian might undergo if sent to Hogwarts. I will admit, that is a very interesting concept to explore, and it could&#39;ve made for a <i>great</i> fanfic if handled right.<br><br>I say, &quot;if handled right&quot;. Unfortunately, the fic bungled the execution in a few critical ways. The mission mentions that the scene that brings up those ideas doesn&#39;t really make sense with anything that came before it. If McGonagall says that the students that fill the halls of Hogwarts are Christians, why did the Sorting Hat flip out about that when it was put on the head of the main Sue? If there are in fact other Christians in Hogwarts that the Sorting Hat would&#39;ve sorted by the time Ariana comes around, why did it single her out? If Ariana was having an identity crisis with herself, why would the Sorting Hat say that she had &quot;a thirst to impress&quot;? From what we read of the rest of the fic, there was inadequate and/or no actual build-up to that scene, not to mention that the scene itself goes against the implied logic that the story runs on. So that&#39;s a sign of bad storytelling in and of itself.<br><br>And that doesn&#39;t mention the other canon violations that occur that are explicitly spelled-out facts from JK Rowling. <br>Like, you know, Potterverse spells suddenly being incantable in German (they&#39;re only incanted in Latin). Or some girl from Portugal being able to go to a school in England, when it has been established by the canon that there are schools in other parts of the world and that there thus might be a school she could go to closer to home. And having a judgmental Gryffindor student. And having Ariana feel the location of Platform Nine and Three Quarters. And having Hagrid freak out about Muggle parents when he was fine with Hermoine&#39;s.<br><br>And let&#39;s not forget the inconsistencies within the story, such as Ariana suddenly becoming a pureblooded witch when she was formerly Muggle-born earlier in the story. And then there were all the grammatical errors involved.<br><br>So, to reiterate, the idea wasn&#39;t bad itself. It was just a badly-told story that did not meet up to the author&#39;s admittedly admirable intent.<br><br>----**----<br><br>Of course, if this isn&#39;t the mission or the fic you&#39;re referring to, feel free to disregard the above two paragraphs.<br><br>The PPC isn&#39;t about attacking stories that don&#39;t follow the canon with funny comments: it&#39;s about pointing out the flows in badly-told fanfiction. And I think that, at least on some level, you have missed the point of the PPC.</p>

            <p>Take a deep breath.<br><br>That <i>was</i> polite dissent. &quot;I disagree with the way you do things, and thought you should know, and here&#39;s why,&quot; is pretty danged polite, and definitely dissent. &quot;YOU&#39;RE ALL FLAMING IDIOTS JUST JEALOUS&quot; is <i>impolite</i> dissent.

            <p>...it doesn&#39;t change the fact that half of the post in question wasn&#39;t exactly the most polite thing in the world. The points themselves weren&#39;t delivered passive-aggressively (and I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t attack the points he made in the actual post I made; rather, I tried to engage him on &#39;em), but the fact that there were rude comments peppered in throughout needs to be addressed. As far as I&#39;m concerned, you can still be impolitely dissenting even <i>without</i> that whole &quot;YOUR ALL FRAMING IDOTS JUST GELOUS&quot; thing.<br><br>&quot;And if I stepped into a forum I believed to be hostile and told them I disagreed with what they did, I&#39;d expect typical &quot;HEY SHUT UP YOU&#39;RE THE JERK&quot; responses immediately.&quot;<br><br>Except that he didn&#39;t <i>really</i> have to say that he was expecting it in the manner that he did. Which is my whole point: for being &quot;polite&quot; dissent, at least half the post is needlessly worded in a mean-spirited way. The points themselves were worded fine: it was the stuff <i>around</i> those points that could&#39;ve used polit-ifying. Which isn&#39;t a word, but still.</p>

            <p>Let us not start shouting about the mote in the eye of our critics - need I bring up the multiple times we&#39;ve had to stop and remind ourselves and each other not to bash authors? We have had people say stuff that was outright deliberately <i>mean-spirited</i> about &#39;badfic authors,&#39; specific and general, no two ways about it. A critique of us that is written snarkily, rather than ingratiatingly, is not something I&#39;m going to be upset about.

Looking at this, you&#39;d almost forget that I stated -twice, no doubt- that I was attacking your positions on canon and Authorial authority rather than you. Just, in fact, as the PPC attacks fanfictions, not fanfiction writers.<br><br>&quot;Oh, and the &quot;message board&quot; comment? Totally uncalled for.

By the argument you present here, I get the feeling you don&#39;t like anything from those kinds of people.&quot;<br>I own Kickassia, Suburban Knights, To Boldly Flee, and NC Reloaded on DVD. The difference between Mr. Walker and the PPC is that his time isn&#39;t soley spent snarking - I know this bit is subjective, but I get sick of sarcasm if it takes up most of the humour, and the Critic mixes it with legitimate criticisms and more complex humour. If I want a more analytical (but still entertaining) review, I watch SF Debris. As for the Nerd...I have nothing against him, I just don&#39;t play (or haven&#39;t ever played) old video games or like his voice much.</p>

Looking at this, you&#39;d almost forget that I stated -twice, no doubt- that I was attacking your positions on canon and Authorial authority rather than you. Just, in fact, as the PPC attacks fanfictions, not fanfiction writers.&quot;<br><br>Well, let&#39;s look at what you actually said, shall we?<br><br>&quot;...Sigh. Totally predictable response from posting this somewhere fans and writers of the PPC gather in 3...2...&quot;<br><br>...<br><br>Yes. Yes, it <i>is</i> what you said. It <i>is</i> what you said, and I resent the fact that you think I am making a strawman out of you for making remarks that <i>are</i> passive-aggresive.<br><br>Aside from that, I&#39;m pretty sure I said something to the effect of &quot;it&#39;s not important to the point, so let&#39;s just leave it at the door&quot;. I felt that, apart from some passive-aggressive stuff you said, you actually didn&#39;t have a terrible argument. I think you&#39;re wrong on many counts, but it wasn&#39;t a <i>terrible</i> argument, and it was at least well-reasoned.<br><br>&quot;For one, it&#39;s making the parts I&#39;m quoting very difficult for readers to tell apart from my responses - usually, I&#39;d have BBCode [quote], [bold], and [italics] tags to work with. As it is, I have to work with quotations marks and ALL CAPS for emphasis.&quot;<br><br>Hm... For the italics/bold tags, it is essentially   and  and . Just omit the spaces, and you&#39;ve got that covered. Trust me, it takes us all a bit to figure that out. Hell, I didn&#39;t know for the longest time. As for the editing option... I hear it exists, but I&#39;ll concede your point there since I <i>still</i> have no idea where it is.<br><br>Still, you can reply to messages individually, and you can actually reply to messages within a certain message tree. (If what I&#39;m saying makes any sense.) It&#39;s actually really helpful to keep people from having eight conversations at once, so it&#39;s actually not as horrible as you might think.<br><br>&quot;Except that a bit doesn&#39;t have to be bad for snarking to work. You could take any line provided you remove enough context and snark at it. You need no knowledge of plot or anything else, just the line and delivery.&quot;<br>Except that the examples you cited on &quot;you can still snark things with higher quality&quot; <i>do</i> rely on the context in which the things are said. Same within your average PPC mission: those almost always operate within the context of the fic itself, and that you almost always provide context for things if you know what you&#39;re doing with the missions.<br><br>I say &quot;if you know what you&#39;re doing&quot;. I&#39;ll... get to that in a bit.<br><br>&quot;I own Kickassia, Suburban Knights, To Boldly Flee, and NC Reloaded on DVD.&quot;<br>Huh... Well, that&#39;s certainly more dedicated than I am, LOL. I have yet to see NC Reloaded, actually, and I don&#39;t have any of the anniversary specials on DVD.<br><br>&quot;The difference between Mr. Walker and the PPC is that his time isn&#39;t soley spent snarking - I know this bit is subjective, but I get sick of sarcasm if it takes up most of the humour, and the Critic mixes it with legitimate criticisms and more complex humour.&quot;<br>Hm... Out of curiosity, can I just ask you how many PPC spin-offs you&#39;ve read? &#39;Cause the PPC I know doesn&#39;t always operate within sarcasm (and only sarcasm). I&#39;ve seen plenty of PPC missions with absurdist humor, I&#39;ve seen some with gross-out humor, and I also know plenty of missions that take the time to do concritty stuff as well (as Nesh pointed out). It changes within each spin-off, sure, but if you have a more limited experience with spin-offs, it can skew your perspective a bit. You are also referring to Laburnum&#39;s spin-off, and within the PPC those spin-offs <i>are</i> considered on the fringe, so it&#39;s not totally representative of the whole PPC.<br><br>On a side note, I did read your post about the fic. Honestly... I can kind of see your point about the misrepresentation there.</p>

            <p>I think we&#39;d have to be pretty daft not to realize that not everyone is going to like us, but we should definitely be able to tolerate it said politely to our faces, too. {= )<br><br>In the spirit of constructive criticism, then, I&#39;d like to dispute some of the points you made.<br><br>First, it seems to me like one of your complaints is that we snark instead of reviewing.

Many of us, myself included, feel that concrit is important and make an effort to leave reviews in cases where it looks like they&#39;ll do some good.

Seriously.)<br><br>Also, it&#39;s true that it&#39;s possible to riff something irrespective of quality, but that doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s what we&#39;re about. I think you agree that there is such a thing as objectively bad writing, and PPC missions employ charge lists specifically to delineate those qualities that make the fic in question objectively bad. And besides, it&#39;s a lot easier to riff things that are terrible. I&#39;m not trying to say there haven&#39;t been errors in judgement in our history, or cases of passion carried too far, but as a group we really do try not to spork stuff just because of content. Objective quality is a very important determining factor.<br><br>Second, our view of canon. Here I&#39;d like to point out that we do believe in good fanfiction, which can indeed take a different interpretation of the canon and do it in an interesting way. That requires good writing, though.<br><br>Also, I at least actually feel the same way you do about putting what you want people to think about the story <i>in</i> the story. I believe the reverse is true, too, though: if it&#39;s <i>not</i> in the story, there&#39;s probably a reason for that, and if you&#39;re writing fanfic you have to work a lot harder to justify an interpretation that really does not appear anywhere in the source material.<br><br>To take your example, I believe you could write an interesting fanfic about what would happen to the Potterverse if Snape got tossed into Azkaban for being abusive. You&#39;d have to take into account his relationships with Dumbledore and Voldemort, both extremely powerful people who have an interest in keeping him free, but it could be done. His cruel nature is certainly supported in his treatment of Neville and Harry in the books.<br><br>You could also write an absolutely awful fic where Severus Snape gets tossed into Azkaban (which looks weirdly like an American prison for unexplained reasons), takes on the nickname &quot;Baybeshoes,&quot; and goes around alternatively beating up anyone who gets in his way and crying about his terrible fate when he&#39;s alone at night—but then he falls in love with Bellatrix Lestrange, and their love is so powerful that it confounds the Dementors and they make their escape and go have beautiful children together, and Sirius Black comes, too, because he&#39;s hott and then Baybe and Bella Snape can have a dog for their kids to play with.<br><br>I&#39;m not exaggerating the degree of illogic I&#39;ve seen in fanfic.

That said, if you spot other cases where you think someone got it wrong, I think it would be good if you told the person in question and explained why you think that.<br><br>I hope that made sense toward the end.

            <p>I&#39;ll respond to this point-by-point with lots of quoting- hope you can read it okay.<br><br>&quot;I think we&#39;d have to be pretty daft not to realize that not everyone is going to like us, but we should definitely be able to tolerate it said politely to our faces, too. {= )&quot;<br>Thank you very much - I expected worse, believe me.<br><br><br>&quot;In the spirit of constructive criticism, then, I&#39;d like to dispute some of the points you made.&quot;<br>Fire away.<br><br><br>&quot;First, it seems to me like one of your complaints is that we snark instead of reviewing.

(We could definitely do more concrit, though, fellow-Boarders. Seriously.)&quot;<br>&gt; Acknowledges that they don&#39;t do enough constructive critisism - okay, good start. But off-screen reviews don&#39;t count - they&#39;re not mentioned in the sporkings, as far as I know, so they&#39;re not part of the PPC universe. Anyone reading a PPC story would have no idea that these existed, so the the most common interpretation would be that they don&#39;t.<br><br>&quot;Also, it&#39;s true that it&#39;s possible to riff something irrespective of quality, but that doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s what we&#39;re about.

Objective quality is a very important determining factor.&quot;<br>Objective badness does exist, yes, but I think that calling every charge &#39;objective&#39; is a stretch to say the least. Objective badness is such that anyone looking at a fic would see the flaw - very basic stuff, such as spelling and grammar. Lacking descriptions, mischaracterisations, and the presence of overpowered characters are more abstract and I contend more subjective. And speaking of charge lists, I find it incredibly annoying when they, the part where an ultimate opinion is given of the fic, includes stuff like &quot;Made Agent X sick; made Agent X stick his/her/N/A head down a toilet; made Agent X drink ever-more Bleeprin, etc.&quot;.<br><br><br>&quot;Second, our view of canon. Here I&#39;d like to point out that we do believe in good fanfiction, which can indeed take a different interpretation of the canon and do it in an interesting way. That requires good writing, though.&quot;<br>So you reaffirm that you like AUs, as in the FAQ. Again, so far so good.<br><br>&quot;Also, I at least actually feel the same way you do about putting what you want people to think about the story in the story. I believe the reverse is true, too, though: if it&#39;s not in the story, there&#39;s probably a reason for that, and if you&#39;re writing fanfic you have to work a lot harder to justify an interpretation that really does not appear anywhere in the source material.<br><br>To take your example, I believe you could write an interesting fanfic about what would happen to the Potterverse if Snape got tossed into Azkaban for being abusive.

Well, yeah, you have to justify yourself with every fic - it&#39;s just that in close-to-canon works, the justification is &#39;built-in&#39; because you&#39;re using the same one canon does, so your letting JKR write it for you. Further away, it&#39;s a DIY job.<br><br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not exaggerating the degree of illogic I&#39;ve seen in fanfic. Did you know there&#39;s a fic where the Giant Squid sexually pleasures Hogwarts Castle? Pretty sure that&#39;s a big heaping helping of &quot;nope&quot; in the books.&quot;<br>Read and enjoyed. I&#39;m a sucker for crack fics and alien POVs.<br><br>&quot;... Anyway. My point, I think, is that if the writer of Baybeshoes has a right to believe what they believe and put it in a fanfic, I have a right to believe what I believe and put it in a PPC mission. It&#39;s certainly a point...&quot;<br>*shrugs* Not much I can say to this.<br><br>&quot;Just to clarify what we mean by &quot;even stupid canon must be defended&quot;—this is simply to say that we don&#39;t go around PPCing original fiction, published or otherwise, even if we dislike it. We only take issue if you&#39;re not playing nicely (i.e. with logic and good spelling, punctuation, and grammar) in someone else&#39;s backyard. Also, we don&#39;t force anyone to PPC in a continuum they don&#39;t like.&quot;<br>That may be what you MEAN, but it certainly isn&#39;t what you SAY. On reading, I (and I assume that this is the most common interpretation for anyone who doesn&#39;t ask about this, eg most of your audience who read but don&#39;t comment) see this:<br>&quot;Fanon can&#39;t contradict Canon. Ever. You can&#39;t get rid of Midi-Chlorians. You can&#39;t get rid of Tom Paris and his captain&#39;s salamander babies. The Ewoks are right out, and the Crystal Skull aliens? Pah, not a chance! If you try to correct ANY of that, you are going against the Official View and must be PUNISHED!&quot; A...slight exaggeration, maybe, but that&#39;s the rub of it.<br><br>&quot;Third... I don&#39;t know what you want us to do about that. If you can&#39;t find the mission or the story in question, there&#39;s no way for us to know what actually happened there or fix it at this time. That said, if you spot other cases where you think someone got it wrong, I think it would be good if you told the person in question and explained why you think that.&quot;<br>I&#39;ve made a separate post about that. It wasn&#39;t as bad as I remembered, but it was still a mistake.<br><br>In conclusion, thanks for replying. I&#39;d also like to reiterate (to you and anyone reading) that again, I hold nothing personal against you. I just don&#39;t like your views.</p>

Please clarify if that&#39;s not what you meant, because I don&#39;t understand where you&#39;re coming from with this at all.</b><br>Because <i>in universe</i> the reviews aren&#39;t given - anyone reading the PPC would think that you don&#39;t give reviews, because you don&#39;t say you do, so they aren&#39;t a part of the PPC &#39;canon&#39; (or meta-canon, I guess). And hey, I got tags working!<br><br><br><b>- Subjective charges<br><br>I think Storme Hawk covered this pretty well.

It&#39;s always nice to find that people are irritated by the same things that irritate you, right?</b><br>But those irritations are subjective - as I said, some people aren&#39;t bothered by a PPC author&#39;s pet peeves, so having the agents go on about how something is <i>SO</i> evil and sickness-inducing is plain annoying.<br><br><br><b>- &quot;Even stupid canon must be defended&quot;<br><br>I&#39;d be interested in clearing up that language, since your interpretation is indeed not what we mean. Where did you see it, exactly?</b><br>Okay, so maybe I exaggerated. A little. Maybe. But, well, it really is how I interpreted it, especially since it&#39;s on the Fanon page - a concept which is <i>all about</i> fixing canon mistakes by modifying it. In fact, I&#39;ll quote the entire paragraph for context:<br><br><b><i>&quot;In some cases of the canon being really stupid or terrible (...) there are times when some fanon can be said to be &#39;better&#39; than canon, or &#39;more canon than the new canon&#39;-- usually in the case of goodfic juxtaposed with a really terrible canon release or a brand-new Canon Sue. Unfortunately, it is the PPC&#39;s duty to protect ALL canon, even stupid canon, no matter the opinion of the agents in question.&quot;</i></b><br><br>So there you have it. No matter how well written fanon is and no matter how stupid, dim-witted, and asinine the canon is (again, I&#39;ll refer you to midi-chlorians and the Crystal Skull aliens), canon comes first, no matter what. If you see it in a fic, it&#39;s chargable.</p>

            <p>First, I&#39;d like to say, look up, try and identify where the surface is, realize just how big a hole you&#39;ve dug yourself. <br>Across this topic you&#39;ve gone back on your &#39;Polite Dissent&#39; it seems to me, and whilst by no means are you raging or flaming it certainly isn&#39;t as polite as it was at first.<br><br>Anyway...<br><br>&quot;Because in universe the reviews aren&#39;t given - anyone reading the PPC would think that you don&#39;t give reviews, because you don&#39;t say you do, so they aren&#39;t a part of the PPC &#39;canon&#39; (or meta-canon, I guess). And hey, I got tags working!&quot;<br><br>So what you want us to do is instead of writing missions write in-verse reviews? That makes about zero sense, plus you&#39;ve got to remember that the Agents are the characters of us, so for them to comment on the reviews we&#39;ve written would be like Harry Potter commenting on how bad JK Rowling made his relatives, it&#39;d be breaking the fourth wall and generally not making a good story (unless Deadpool&#39;s involved).<br><br>&quot;But those irritations are subjective - as I said, some people aren&#39;t bothered by a PPC author&#39;s pet peeves, so having the agents go on about how something is SO evil and sickness-inducing is plain annoying.&quot;<br>OK, let&#39;s take some examples from Canon. Do you hate Jim Butcher because he made Harry Dresden say &#39;Black wizards don&#39;t just grow up like toadstools, you know. Someone has to teach them complicated things like summoning demons, ritual magic, and clichéd villain dialogue.&#39; or do you hate Rick Riordan because as Typhon is marching on New York he makes Dionysus say &#39;The world will fall, the gods will die, and I will never get a perfect score on this stupid machine&#39; in reference to Pacman. Seriously, look through the Trope page I said about, here I&#39;ll even give you the link <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking</a></a> Look through it and see that what we do is done my so many others, yet do people hate those author&#39;s or script writers for putting it in? No, because in the end it&#39;s only what a line or two out of the whole story. If you don&#39;t get that sort of humour don&#39;t complain about it and try and get us to stop it, let us carry on with it and accept that we&#39;re not making missions tailor made to your standards.<br><br>&quot;Okay, so maybe I exaggerated. A little. Maybe. But, well, it really is how I interpreted it, especially since it&#39;s on the Fanon page - a concept which is all about fixing canon mistakes by modifying it. In fact, I&#39;ll quote the entire paragraph for context:<br><br>&quot;In some cases of the canon being really stupid or terrible (...) there are times when some fanon can be said to be &#39;better&#39; than canon, or &#39;more canon than the new canon&#39;-- usually in the case of goodfic juxtaposed with a really terrible canon release or a brand-new Canon Sue. Unfortunately, it is the PPC&#39;s duty to protect ALL canon, even stupid canon, no matter the opinion of the agents in question.&quot;<br><br>So there you have it. No matter how well written fanon is and no matter how stupid, dim-witted, and asinine the canon is (again, I&#39;ll refer you to midi-chlorians and the Crystal Skull aliens), canon comes first, no matter what. If you see it in a fic, it&#39;s chargable.&quot;<br><br>Either you exaggerated or you didn&#39;t, and I&#39;d go for the former. You&#39;re warping what&#39;s written on the Wiki to your own means. I can&#39;t deny that what you&#39;ve quoted is incorrect or taken out of context from your first paragraph, but it&#39;s that last bit that really annoys me. Yes whilst if it is in a fic it could be chargeable, it doesn&#39;t mean it automatically is. You&#39;re mixing up charging and sporking really, just because something could be charged doesn&#39;t mean it should be sporked. I&#39;ll take to one of the stories I like on FF.net, it&#39;s called the Dark in Peace, set after the Seventh Book of HP, it&#39;s not Epilogue Compliant, and I know there are a few SPaG mistakes in it, but overall it&#39;s a decent piece of fanfiction, it&#39;s got some charges in there sure, but would I put it up on here to be sporked? No. In fact if you really think about what you&#39;re saying, unless it completely fits in to a gap left by the author (say the 19 years between Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and it&#39;s epilogue) then every bit of fanfiction could be charged and thereby sporked because in some way or another it doesn&#39;t stick completely to Canon (if it did we&#39;d just be re-reading the books after all). One final thing I will point out (coming from your first paragraph of the quote above) is that Fanon isn&#39;t just about fixing Canon by modifying it, or rather it is partially fixing canon from the writers point of view, especially as you seem to have forgotten that quite a large amount of fanfiction starts on the simple concept of What If? I&#39;m currently planning a fanfiction based on that concept, it doesn&#39;t by any means fix canon from point of view, it merely means I enjoy opening up possibilities. <br><br>I&#39;m not trying to be insulting or to upset anyone, these are just my views after all.<br>Storme Hawk</p>

If...if I were to gather more, to put them in me...<br>Obi-Wan: [shakes head] You misunderstand, padawan. Midi-Chlorians are of the Force - they come to those who can best use them.

In which case the charge isn&#39;t a canon break, but a <i>badly written</i> canon break? Cause then the problem is the writing, not the canon break, and something I&#39;d be far more accepting of.<br><br>On the other hand, what I&#39;ve read of the PPC doesn&#39;t seem to support this. I&#39;ll take a different PPC fic this time with two different Agents, to try and avoid No True Scotsman. Namely, Cupcakes: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KmcAgo2JEbSFBr6ZFRHUSp3Ey4gXyi384U90HLipCnE/edit?hl=en_US"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KmcAgo2JEbSFBr6ZFRHUSp3Ey4gXyi384U90HLipCnE/edit?hl=en_US">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KmcAgo2JEbSFBr6ZFRHUSp3Ey4gXyi384U90HLipCnE/edit?hl=en_US</a></a><br>Yeah, yeah, the fic isn&#39;t great (though I don&#39;t mind it as a standalone horror fic), but one of the things that stuck with me from the sporking was the charge of creating &#39;a non-canon space&#39;, e.g. a place that wasn&#39;t there in canon. Well, for it to break canon this must be serious. A floating castle in the sky? A set of caves below the town that had never been mentioned before? No, it was...a basement. Yes, the existence of a basement below a cafe was <i>sooo</i> implausible that it needed epic amounts of justification for you to get away with it, and the agents were unimpressed with the idea of there just being a basement nobody mentioned before because...it&#39;s a basement. I don&#39;t know about you, but when I walk into a shop I don&#39;t demand to know whether there is a basement or not. Why would I? It&#39;s not like anything exciting goes on in there, so it&#39;s plausible either way. And there was stuff about the fic suddenly jumping there, but the main character <i>was</i> unconscious, so swapping locations between her fainting and waking up is perfectly justifiable.</p>

            <p>Chiming in with a couple of responses...<br><br>Other people have commented on the aspect of in-mission reviews before, and that Jay+Acacia did mention reviews in the Original Series.<br><br>Adding to that, there&#39;s a bit of context (which the FAQ <br>hopefully explains): the PPC does not spork fics just because they have one or two little mistakes - we take aim at fics that are undisputedly bad, with little or no hope of improvement. Paraphrasing the FAQ, we&#39;re not interested in (ever) working out the dividing line between spork-worthy and not-spork worthy. If you have doubts about whether a fic is bad-enough to be PPC&#39;ed, don&#39;t PPC it.<br><br>Re: the Fanon issue:<br>I think the distinction Neshomeh (and others) are trying to get at is that the manner in which the canon is ignored is important. <br>A story that arrogantly sets the &quot;stupid&quot; part of canon aside (&quot;Worst... plot device... ever&quot;) or insists that the JKR was wrong for ever writing Half-Blood Prince and aims to &quot;fix&quot; the canon would be PPC-worthy.<br>A story that tries to gently-question aspects of &quot;stupid&quot; canon, or just ignores it (where possible: you don&#39;t have to mention midichlorians at all in a Star Wars fic), or is a legitimate AU would not be PPC&#39;ed.<br><br>As an aside, did you know there are actually gay characters in the Star Wars EU? Only two, and referred-to very obliquely, though. Karen Traviss introduced a gay Mandalorian couple into the Legacy of the Force series (can&#39;t remember which book since it&#39;s been a few years since I&#39;ve read them). Other than that, Star Wars is very much a case of Bury your Gays...<br>It&#39;s weird, since there&#39;s so much inter-species romance throughout the EU.<br><br>Elcalion<br><br></p>

            <p>Listen. Despite the fact that things have been uncomfortable between us for some time, and we&#39;ve had a lot of differences, I do still care about you as a person. I know you lash out because of different reasons, and I have sympathy for that. And the last thing I want to do is start inter-community drama in a thread that involves Community Talking to Outsider.<br><br>But. That said...<br><br>You really, <i>really</i> need to stop Leaving The PPC Forever amid dramatic insulting of one or more people, telling us the entire organization needs an overhaul, and then showing up a month or two later as if nothing had happened. This is the second time, by my count. I have a thread lower down, which I believe you have seen, that discusses recent issues with threads and the Constitution. This thread sprang, almost directly, out of a recent confrontation which involved you. I would really appreciate it if you could respond down there, and we can maybe have a conversation about this <i>as</i> a community.<br><br>It is not my place to say things like &quot;If you apologize,&quot; or &quot;What you said is okay,&quot; or whatever, because I was not the one who was hurt by what you said, not directly. That&#39;s between you and Huinesoron, or you and Neshomeh. But dialogue about this <i>needs to happen</i>, if you are going to stick around. I know you are not a fan of talking directly about this kind of thing, but we can&#39;t let this keep happening. It&#39;s hurting people, and creating gaps, and if we don&#39;t have an honest conversation about it, we are going to wind up with a chasm down the middle of this community, and I will not stand for that.</p>

            <p>Hey, I can relate to that. Cheers!<br><br>Looks like other folks have beaten me to the punch with some pretty awesome points, so I&#39;m just responding with my own personal feelings here.<br><br>- <b>I have not, and never have, attacked you personally, the one writing those reviews. ... Unless you say otherwise, readers are going to assume that your author avatars are just that, because they won&#39;t go behind the scenes like I am to ask.</b><br><br>I don&#39;t feel I&#39;ve been attacked. I just feel that it would be a waste of my time and my readers&#39; to go out of my way to make sure that anyone who reads my fiction can make an accurate diagnosis of my personality and habits based on it. I&#39;m not out to write an exposé of myself, I&#39;m out to tell a funny story about people who hop through dimensions to suffer through really bad writing before they get to mop it up.<br><br>That said, I would genuinely love to hear what else you (or anyone) think you can tell about me based on my characters. I won&#39;t deny they&#39;re my avatars in that we share some opinions, likes, and dislikes when it comes to fandoms and writing, but beyond that... this could either hold an enlightening mirror up to my own mind and writing process, or turn out to be an incredibly amusing funhouse of warped images. Go on, I dare you, and anyone else who feels like playing this little game. No reading my wiki bio, either, that&#39;s cheating. *g*<br><br>- <b>Not much I can say to this one, except to ask if you&#39;re sure that what you find annoying is what the majority of your readership do.</b><br><br>Well, broadly, yes. Yes, I am. All of us here are pretty annoyed by bad writing generally and can relate to other people&#39;s individual experiences with it.<br><br>Do I think the majority of my readers share my pet peeves, though? No. Do I think they should? Nope! That&#39;s kinda what defines a pet peeve, after all—something that, for whatever reason, uniquely bugs me to a degree not shared by most other people.<br><br>However, I don&#39;t have to please everyone with every detail of my writing. I just have to please most people with most of the details. There are always going to be a few things that just plain don&#39;t work, since I&#39;m not perfect; and there are always going to be a few things that hit home with some people but not others. I think I can afford to toss a few breadcrumbs to the minority who do share my pet peeves every now and then.<br><br>- <b>In which case the charge isn&#39;t a canon break, but a badly written canon break?</b><br><br>Yup, that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m saying. In fact, I&#39;d say &quot;badly written canon break&quot; is redundant. It&#39;s a canon <i>break</i> because, like a bone break, it&#39;s sudden, sharp, painful, and may damage other systems with the jagged edges. It doesn&#39;t have to be one big clean <i>snap</i>, either, it can be a bunch of hairline fractures that weaken the bone so much it just can&#39;t support its own weight anymore. Either way, broken = structurally unsound = bad writing.<br><br>- <b>No, it was...a basement.</b><br><br>Come now, let&#39;s not mince words at this stage. I&#39;m pretty sure it was a torture parlor where Pinkie Pie drugged, maimed, and cannibalized her friends.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>You don’t need to go behind the scenes to ask. You just shouldn’t judge the whole organization by some stories written about it. (I admit that it may be impossible to read anything ever written about the PPC, but I’m still trying.)<br><br>In <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission07.html">Chapter Seven of The Original Series</a>, Agent Jay told Agent Acacia that she had reviewed the badfic. <br><br>In some other mission reports, <a href="http://uncommon-comma.livejournal.com/4333.html">like this one</a>, the agents are at least aware of the constructive critic given in reviews, so a natural conclusion would be: either these agents’ authors reviewed the badfic, or they didn’t because there wasn’t anything to add to what already had been said.<br><br>It would be stupid to repeat this in every story, but maybe it should be done more often.<br><br>Also, I may be wrong, but IMO a really good mission report doesn’t just mock the story (never the author), it is or should be concrit presented in a form more entertaining than a plain review, and it <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/architeuthis/mission03.html">can</a> occasionally <a href="http://www.keldale.f9.co.uk/tabularasa/mission3.htm">be done</a> to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K33i4NbxNThKEdfmacAA8pY04qPmENbAT0lBLaJoSXs/edit?pli=1">good</a> fan fiction, although agents normally wouldn’t be send into a goodfic. <br><br><b>Stupid canon:</b><br>Do I sense a misunderstanding here? Again a may be wrong, but I thought the PPC-Wiki is not about “How to write good fan fiction”, it is about “How to write good PPC fan fiction based on the canon defined by The Original Series and additions agreed upon by the Board”.<br><br>If I ever join the PPC, and get permission, and decide to send my agents into a specific badfic <b>for good reasons</b>, then I may write my agents feeling terrible and complaining bitterly, because at this point they agree with the badfic’s author, but either they have to charge for breaking stupid canon, or they have to get into trouble with the Flowers That Be for letting it slip.<br>Now I wonder whether the punishment could be less harsh if even the Flowers agreed that this canon is stupid. <br>Anyway, this doesn’t say that<br>-  My agents cannot agree with the fan fiction’s author.<br>-    I cannot agree with the fan fiction’s author to a certain extent.<br>-    A story preferring good fanon over stupid canon is <b>always</b> bad. <br>- Breaking stupid canon is a sufficiently <b>good reason</b> to send my agents into a story when nothing else is wrong with it.<br>-  I should send my agents into a story although I don’t want to do it. (I have a choice, they haven’t.) <br><br>Applying this to your example, my agents would probably charge for the badly written dialogue, because they don’t like to be punished. They probably wouldn’t charge for the well written dialogue, not because it is well written, but because they wouldn’t even be there in the first place. Or, if such a well written dialogue could exist in a badfic, and I were a Star Wars fan and knew what these Midi-somethings are, my agents might not charge and suffer the punishment, because they wanted to make a statement. <br><br>I don’t know the ponyverse, and I refuse to read more legendary badfic (I already had my deal), so I can not answer to your last paragraph. <br></p>

            <p>That varies by spinoff. I remember reading one where the agents got so angry at every little canon breach, and I literally couldn&#39;t finish it because I couldn&#39;t relate. The key is not to make sure your audience agrees with you (nigh impossible, given the diversity of opinions in the world), but to make sure it seems plausible for the agent to feel that way, and their pain is conveyed properly. An example would be that Agent X has a crush on canon character Y, because when Agent X went through a tough time, he/she could always think of canon character Y and feel better. Agent X goes through a fic where canon character Y is completely character replaced and loses all the characteristics that made Agent X love them and see them as a source of strength. Then, one of Agent X&#39;s subjective charges is &quot;making me drink lots of Bleepka&quot;, because the pain of seeing the character like that was so hard. Sure, it&#39;s not a charge that seems relatable to everyone, because not everyone cares about canon character Y, but you can understand why Agent X feels that way.<br><br>This sort of thing is achieved with varying degrees of success. We all try, but we&#39;re not perfect. Don&#39;t judge us on the ones that don&#39;t do as well. Also, bear in mind that some things are almost guarenteed to be universal, like bad spelling. &quot;Headache from bad spelling&quot; is subjective, but most people would agree upon reading the fic because most, if not all of us, value good spelling and grammar.<br><br>I also agree with Nesh in that you also shouldn&#39;t judge a writer or an agent for their pet peeves. As long as it&#39;s well-written. Always, as long as it&#39;s well-written.</p>

            <p>&quot;And speaking of charge lists, I find it incredibly annoying when they, the part where an ultimate opinion is given of the fic, includes stuff like &quot;Made Agent X sick; made Agent X stick his/her/N/A head down a toilet; made Agent X drink ever-more Bleeprin, etc.&quot;<br><br>I believe you&#39;ll find that this is mainly meant to be a comedic tool, you have all these serious charges and end with something that seems insignificant can get a laugh out of people.

            <p>I have written a trio of short PPC stories. Not quite interludes, since they&#39;re the first things I&#39;ve written about these agents, but a little more than agent introductions. They involve my Vulcan agent <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Sebak">Sebak</a> and his human partner.

            <p>Yes, I too have felt the urge to create a simply enormous villain for Redwall. <br><br>My final decision usually settled somewhere around &#39;Siberian Tiger,&#39; but I can&#39;t say I ever wrote the fic, as I decided that Siberian Tigers were WAY out there and probably shouldn&#39;t be brought into Redwall.<br><br>Especially since my earlier ideas involved using *elephants* to knock down Redwalls&#39; red walls.</p>

            <p>True, there is Gulo gulo luscus of North America, and Gulo gulo gulo of Europe, and Asia. However, due to the northern habitat of both species, and the ambiguity of how close to the north pole the landmass that makes up most of the Redwall world is, on could argue that their equivalent of Russia is in the uppermost northlands, making it at least semi-plausible that a wolverine could lead an army out of his natrual continent.

            <p>Which site would be best for posting fanfiction? To specify, I&#39;m looking for a website that doesn&#39;t require an email address. If anyone could lead me to something like that, I&#39;d be much obliged.</p>

            <p>Every site I&#39;ve ever been on, with very, very occasional exceptions (such as this one), require an email to have an account, and a registered account in order to post content. If you&#39;re just trying to avoid putting your own email address up, I recommend getting a Gmail account for the purpose of &quot;Signing Up For Things.&quot; It&#39;s what I did, a while back.<br><br>That said, my favorite site for posting and reading is <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/">AO3</a>, but the <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/">Pit of Voles</a> remains popular with a lot of folks.</p>
