            <p>We could get into a whole debate about the Sue-ishness of each Disney princess, but I rewatched a lot of them recently and the only one that <i>really</i> screamed &quot;Sue!&quot; to me was Cinderella.

            <p>Cinderella 3 blew my mind. It should have been horrible because it was a sequel to Cinderella, but it was actually pretty good. <br><br>Ah, good, now I know not to rewatch Cinderella 2. I don&#39;t remember liking it much as a kid anyway.</p>

            <p>Or, for those who cannot tell what the heck that was, Disney World for me. Let&#39;s see, <br><br>Marvin would have a blast just going around and seeing all the fun things. I cannot tell what his favorite park would be. I think he would enjoy all of it (except the little kiddies rides) and just generally have a blast. He is a big kid at heart, and having opportunity to let it all out would be exhilarating for him.<br><br>Printworthy would have fun at most of the parks, but would be more interested at the opportunity to study human culture and entertainment first hand. As such, his favorite park would probably be Epcot as well, but for different reasons. Seeing how an untamed planet works, without having to go into the Everfree Forest would be amazing for future works and his own curiosity. Then, going to all the human culture exhibits and seeing how different people act based off of location and history would be exiting. Besides that, the Animal Kingdom would be interesting to watch him go through, as he tries to communicate with all the hoofed animals and it does not work. It would be funny to read about at least.<br><br>Jumper would have fun, but would be constantly asking, &quot;Can we jump on over to Universal now? I want to see Hogwarts and Jurassic Park and all that stuff. Please?&quot;</p>

            <p>My frame of reference is Disney World, so let&#39;s go with that one.<br><br>Jenni is all for this idea, seeing as she has a young child who would be massively entertained by all the age-appropriate stuff (until he got tired). She and Henry might have to bail on Disney and go hit up Universal Orlando for the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, though.<br><br>Ilraen would get a kick out of pretty much everything, though if he&#39;s in human morph instead of a disguise (which would make the better story), he might have to be kept on a leashâ€”all that enticing theme park food, you know. He might have to avoid the more popular attractions, since being stuck in line for more than two hours would be a Very Bad Thing for him, but he&#39;d be pretty happy just gawking at everything. Really real reality is a bit of a novelty for him in and of itself.<br><br>Nume would not enjoy the large crowds and screaming children, and I can&#39;t imagine he&#39;s much for rides, but Disney World pretty much has an attraction for everyone. Epcot is more his speed. If they have adults-only days, that would be ace in his book. Realistically, though, he&#39;d probably get dragged around by Jenni and/or Ilraen and just have to suck it up.<br><br>Derik and Gall would most likely be confused and overwhelmed by everything, which is pretty dangerous in both their cases. Derik has some sense and can generally keep it together enough to stop Gall from doing anything stupid, but one bad mood swing and that&#39;s the end of that. I wouldn&#39;t trust them by themselves, personally.<br><br>If I didn&#39;t have a million other things to do, I might have to write this. {= D<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Doc would probably have the most fun finding and reading all the little bits about the history of Disneyland.  &quot;Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln&quot; would probably be his favorite thing of all.  Of course, he would also need to hit the shops for any interesting biographies about Walt (even he/I need to read a little nonfiction sometimes).<br><br>Vania would be riding the &quot;good&quot; rides over and over: Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean, Big Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones Adventure, Star Tours.  Over and over and over and over.  And over.  She would probably drive the guests around her nuts with singing along to any song that catches her ear.  Especially when she tries to join in with the Dapper Dans.  Any stages musicals would be right up her alley as well.  Vania would go shopping too, but for music rather than reading.<br><br>Although, if this is happening after my upcoming mission to <i>Epic Mickey</i>, they may have unsettling flashbacks to the Cartoon Wasteland&#39;s creepy, run-down versions of the rides . . .<br><br>So, any fun pictures or stories from your trip, Lily?</p>

            <p>I may or may not have gotten this idea from riding that Buzz Lightyear shooting ride thing, because I imagined this mass vacation day when the PPC just swamps the Happiest Place on Earth (many agents would have to be disguised as humans, so the park workers don&#39;t turf them out under the assumption that they&#39;re dressing up or something). And there&#39;d be agents trying to beat each other&#39;s highscores on the Buzz Lightyear ride and making snide comments at the droids on the Star Tours ride and singing &quot;It&#39;s A Small World&quot; incessantly.<br><br>Also, one of the agents will probably accidentally pull the sword out of the stone and become King of Britain. </p>

            <p>Disney World is the only incarnation I&#39;ve been to. So.....<br><br>Cass: Would probably show her whimsical side and end up *everywhere*, especially anywhere in the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom. I imagine she&#39;d enjoy the water parks, as well. and she&#39;d be keeping an autograph book too. She&#39;d enjoy everything, especially the cute and extreme rides. Also, I think she&#39;d like the cultural relevance of Epcot. She&#39;d also beg Sol to let her try out for &quot;The American Idol experience&quot;. She might also drag Sol to character breakfast. <br><br>Solstice: Probably wouldn&#39;t enjoy herself that much in Magic Kingdom. Would be dragged around by Cass on every cute ride there is, multiple times, and stand in line to get all character autographs, staring daggers at Cass every so often. She would probably hate Peter Pan, try to find the off switch for &quot;It&#39;s a Small World&quot; before being dragged away by Cass (but not before purchasing one of those &quot;I survived &#39;It&#39;s a Small World&#39;&quot; t-shirts). She&#39;d probably hide the fact that she likes the extreme rides, and would most likely enjoy Epcot. When Cass would ask to try out for AI, she would crack eventually. I think her favorite thing would be the rocket ride, but it might make Cass dizzy since it relies a lot on a screen. <br><br>I&#39;d imagine they&#39;d go camping. Both of them can be somewhat outdoorsy, so they&#39;d take the campground. </p>

            <p>Well, I have a pair of potential agents I&#39;ve been creating for if I ever apply for Permission (read: when I feel like my writing isn&#39;t terrible anymore), so I shall answer your question.<br><br>The girl from World One whose name may or may not become ZoÃ« would probably briefly look up from her book, find a bench or a quiet corner, and then go right back to reading. Seriin, the elf from one of my original worlds, Rhel, would probably look around, be overwhelmed, and then start talking and asking questions at ZoÃ« without breaking for breath, like she tends to do when she&#39;s excited. ZoÃ« would growl &quot;Shut up!&quot; and then pointedly ignore her partner. Seriin would wander off, get lost, realize that ZoÃ« has the RA, and curse the Narrative Laws of Comedy while trying to find her partner by navigating Disneyland as though it were HQ.<br><br>Meanwhile, ZoÃ« would look up from her book, realize that Seriin&#39;s not there anymore, and go chasing after her-- as well as she can while also holding her book open to the right page because she lacks a bookmark and doesn&#39;t want to bend the corners. When they finally find each other, they would be relieved for a small instant before getting annoyed at each other again, and then someone would spot the knife that ZoÃ« was fingering and call security while the Agents escape through a portal to their RC.<br><br>Sorry, was that too long? They don&#39;t even exist yet!<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>Hey, when you live five hours south of a theme park, what&#39;s your school to do for long field trips, y&#39;know?<br><br>Florestan: Well, Florestan would probably run straight for all the &quot;mountains&quot; that are all over the place. He is a fan of things that go fast, after all.<br><br>Eusabius: Definitely up for some Haunted Mansion fun times. I imagine he&#39;s also the kind of guy who would spend tons of time in Tomorrowland and Adventure Land as well.<br><br>Anneli: Fantasyland girl all the way.<br><br>Xanthus: Now Xanthus... Xanthus is much more of an EPCOT kind of guy, what with having a curiosity for Earth and all that. He might be disappointed to find that there&#39;s no dextro food, and that indeed there aren&#39;t that many rides, but I think he&#39;d appreciate it nonetheless. Besides, Test Track is a pretty awesome ride...<br><br>Cindy: Poor Cindy would probably be dragged around by Anneli. Not that she minds, but Cindy might start complaining after being on &quot;It&#39;s A Small World&quot; for the eighth time.<br><br>You know how it is. Have fun!</p>

            <p>Cindy could always use the excuse to break away from Anneli, LOL. Or maybe Anneli could start dragging Ilraen behind them as well.

            <p>I don&#39;t know that I can comment on the &quot;correctness&quot; of the piece, since everyone&#39;s definition of Mary Stu, canon, and where the two intersect, is different - but it is a helpful dialogue, and a useful one for writing. As far as PPC canon goes, I don&#39;t know that it could be made to conform with the PPC &#39;verse, but I don&#39;t think that makes it any less interesting, or important, or even correct - we&#39;re hardly the arbiters of everything right about fanfic.<br><br>(Having poked at their main site, I must say I also rather like it overall. Interesting stuff!)</p>

            <p>I laughed in a few spots. {= )<br><br>I think the main problem with it as far as meshing with the PPC definition goes is that we don&#39;t define Mary Sues as necessarily being author-inserts. Sure, they might be, but making the accusation means making assumptions about people we&#39;ve never met based on a piece of fiction, which is kind of not cool and also debases our claim that our problem is the writing, not the author. If we can&#39;t separate the Sue from its author, how do we expect the author to do so?<br><br>Also, not all author-inserts are necessarily Sues, which I think the article demonstrates without meaning to. A self-insert that keeps to herself and doesn&#39;t muck with the plot or characters, as seems to be the case with Ophidia, is not a Mary Sue by our definition. In fact, she seems like an interesting original character to me.<br><br>By the way, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen you around before. Are you new to the Board?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>First off, this particular writer is from a most reviled corner of the Internet, namely, the intersection of the brony and furry fandoms (or at least this author personally reviles said corner). Be warned: He has seen almost everything, and cannot accurately judge how squicky it is to the uninitiated.<br><br>Second, he has an odd tendency of third-person-personing himself, as if trying to evoke the feeling that in fact he is writing his own characterisation.<br><br>Third, he&#39;s fully capable of fan-dumb doublethink: Rabid in one direction, capable of absolutely detesting overzealous fans at the same time, all the while making fun of them as well as himself.<br><br><br>Well, that should have led to a few people closing the tabs, so it&#39;s time to drop any semblance of formalities.<br><br>I&#39;m here primarily for the purpose of learning to write a god-damn plot (which, so far, I do not believe I can even without divine damnation), and for the chance to spork (as mentioned above, humorously hypocritically) the odd badfic that manages to catch my eye.<br><br>Well, that&#39;s all for now.

            <p>Since you mention Cage, I&#39;ll go ahead and link you to a short piano piece of his. You might find it sounds very strange, though, for various reasons that you&#39;ll see here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUTXNxFvjDw"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUTXNxFvjDw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUTXNxFvjDw</a></a><br><br>One guy you don&#39;t sound like you&#39;re familiar with would probably be Edgard Varese, who was a French composer who came to America in the 20&#39;s. He&#39;s known particularly for stuff like Ionisation, but he wrote a ton of other things.

            <p>My thoughts and prayers go out to the families affected by both Sunday and Monday&#39;s storms. Fortunately (though I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t think so) there was only one casualty Sunday night,  and Monday&#39;s storm only claimed 24. I say only because Monday night the news was saying 51 with the possibility of more. Though so many more have lost their homes.<br><br>I also appreciate those thoughts and prayers, it looks like it may be a rough tornado season, and while we (I live in Stillwater (which is right between the path of both storms. One went just North and the other just South) and there is family in Carney (about 25 miles South of Stillwater and around 45 miles North of Monday&#39;s tornado) haven&#39;t been affected by these two storms, there are more to come I&#39;m sure. </p>

            <p>We had to shelter last night, but we weren&#39;t in the storm path. We had a warning, nothing happened. That actually happens a lot.

            <p>Is it possible to subvert a trajeck past (ex: becoming an orphan, grandparental abuse, running away from home and ending up in the worst possible situation on the streets yet still somehow removing oneself from there) in a way that leaves the result as halfway acceptable character?</p>

            <p>I think you&#39;ll find the trick in writing is <i>always</i> in the execution...<br><br>Anyway, the series of events you described is not impossible, or even implausible, really. It only becomes trajeck if it&#39;s written in such a way as to seem shoehorned in as a cheap means to make us sympathize with the character and otherwise has no bearing on their personality or behavior. Someone who went through all that is going to be deeply affected by it, so if they appear to be getting along just fine until the plot demands angst, it&#39;s not gonna work. However, if they&#39;re shown throughout the story to have (for example) trouble trusting people and forming close relationships, and tend to react to stressors like they&#39;re still on the street rather than &quot;normally,&quot; and have to do actual work to overcome these issues rather than magically getting over them when their LO appears, that&#39;s a real character.<br><br>Make sense?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The example I haven&#39;t pulled out of thin air; it is in fact the prototype backstory for one of my characters - his self-preservatory instincts command him to not recognise emotion in order to reveal no weakness:<br><br>First, any mistake he had made or confessed in his grandparents&#39; presence they had perceived as insult to the memory of their daughter - of which he is the only remaining sample, genetically - and as such punished with the harshness ultra-traditional grandparents are infamous for (at least if I remember my own Gramma, and that one friend of Gramps&#39;.)<br>Second, less emotionally, more rationally: Showing emotion may lead to showing weakness, not good if you&#39;re only sixteen, on the streets, cutting down free time (note: he has no concept of this, therefore will integrate well into the PPC) and sleep in order to both survive after the first break that caused him to run away from a psychologically awful, but materially sheltered life and somehow acquire enough of an education to join society as something other than underpaid worker (it was the military he&#39;d signed up with when he grew of age, and also made use of their education program in exchange for twelve years&#39; service.)<br><br><br>Combining this with my intended portrayal of him as someone who respects only usefulness in people, makes &quot;friends&quot; specifically to exploit them, consciously buries his issues and primarily focuses on survival, not living...I hope to have created a woobie of the Jerkass/Iron persuasion (that is, defying his own woobieism, lacking all moral integrity, but provoking maternal instincts in the unlikely case his backstory is discovered) who will allow you to hug him so long as you carry no pointy instruments and serve a certain purpose. In the literal case of hugging him: Meatshield.<br><br>I&#39;m having alignment troubles with him, though. Lawful Neutral seems logical, as it grants a certain level of freedom (in the good/evil direction) while still providing stability.<br><br><br>Teal Deer:<br>Harsh past, coped with it at one point using Anger (cf: Five Stages of Grief!), this ended poorly, so he overworked himself to make things better (Bargaining) and eventually ended up semi-subconsciously ignoring the issues altogether, realising that the situation was not, in fact, actually going to improve (somewhere between Denial and Acceptance, on the Denial side.) Ironically this helped him acquire the peace of mind necessary to not get slapped with his universe&#39;s equivalent of Section 8.</p>

            <p>I think that this back story, if well-written and continuously holding actual consequences for your character, would not be bad at all. The only part that catches my eye is the concept of grandparents who blame him for errors simply because his mother is deceased. This seems as though it could be either quirky and interesting or pointless and, quite honestly, Stu-ish. Generally the difference between tragic and pathetic is breached by the true repercussions for the character, which I think you have thought through nicely, and the whole &quot;It&#39;s not his fault...&quot; thing, which I think you could improve on. That bit rubs me the wrong way a tad. Hope this helped!</p>

            <p>This backstory I&#39;ve created I&#39;ve mostly tried to narrate from an entirely neutral point of view, the details as distorted by the perception of a character - him - I will only expand on if he is questioned in this direction in FicPsy.

            <p>Writing from personal experience brings up an entirely different point, then. I think that drawing from your own knowledge and emotions will do well to make your agent&#39;s backstory more convincing and less clichÃ©. At the same time, using him as an outlet for your feelings may evolve back into the sort of pity-party vibe that you want to avoid. Keep it classy, though, and it should work out fine.<br>My sympathies about your grandmother. Sounds rough.</p>

            <p>In that case, a couple additional points:<br><br>1. I repeat, agents need to be relatable. I don&#39;t see myself relating to an agent who goes through missions exploiting his partner and not having emotional reactions to stuff. That is creepy, psychopath, Do Not Want territory.<br><br>2. Missions need to be fun and funny. A very serious character trying to keep it together in the face of absurdity can be funny, but that&#39;s not the vibe I&#39;m getting here (see above). Maybe it&#39;s just your very formal writing style, but if so, that in itself will need work if you want to write PPC stories.<br><br>3. ... Wait, why are we even talking about this right now?

            <p>&quot;The term Section 8 refers to a category of discharge from the United States military when judged mentally unfit for service. It also came to mean any serviceperson given such a discharge or behaving as if deserving such a discharge, as in the expression, &quot;he&#39;s a Section 8&quot;. The term comes from Section VIII of the World War I-era United States Army Regulation 615-360, which provided for the discharge of those deemed unfit for military service.&quot;<br><br>Basically he pulled himself together to not get tossed out of whatever job he was going to find (by then it was already clear that he&#39;d join the Cornerian Navy) on the grounds of being batshit insane, quietly so.</p>

            <p>I doubt I have worded it the way I&#39;ve been quoted, but allow me to rephrase in any case:<br>As they saw in him the last living memory of their daughter as well as the reason for her death (reason: Born to a scientist father and terraforming mother on Fichina, before Climate Control was installed; a blizzard knocked out the energy systems and consequently also the medicals, he and his mother barely survived long enough for help to arrive - he was recovered, she didn&#39;t make it) they expected no less than perfection of him - a traumatising experience for a child.

            <p>So, it seems that it will now be possible for fanfiction authors (in a handful of canons) to submit their works to Amazon and possibly get them published. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1001197421"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1001197421">http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1001197421</a></a><br><br>So far, there&#39;s nothing at all about who will decide what to publish (The author? Someone from the publishing company of the original books? An underpaid intern?) or how they will decide. There are some very general guidelines, but I refuse to believe they will publish any 100.000 words Damon Salvatore/Mary Sue epic romance, that doesn&#39;t contain porn and have halfway decent SPaG. I simply refuse.<br><br>This, of course, raises two questions (and yes, I know it&#39;s way too early to say anything definite, but we can still theorize).<br>A) How canon are these new stories?<br>B) Are we allowed to spork them if we think they deserve it?<br><br>Thoughts?</p>

            <p>&quot;Very careful must we be.  Down a dark path this line of thinking may take us.&quot;<br><br>Well said, misquoted Yoda.  Applying the adjective &quot;licensed&quot; to one subset of fanfiction automatically categorizes the remainder as &quot;not licensed.&quot;  I worry that this might lead to a situation where the owners of intellectual properties wield more power over when and where fan works can be created/posted anywhere.  I prefer the ambiguously legal, homogeneous mass of fanfiction as it currently stands.<br><br>A. How canon?  Exactly as canon as the original creator says.  Note I said &quot;creator&quot; and not &quot;publisher.&quot;  The author/whatever is the one whose head found the story, and they (to me) are the only one(s) who should be able to declare canon or uncanon anything written by another author.<br><br>B. Are we allowed to spork?  Quite frankly, I&#39;m going to be optimistic and assume that, even if it is merely publishers and not the original author who makes the decision of what gets published, that they will still weed out anything bad enough to be sporked in a PPC mission.  Don&#39;t forget, folks: we spork the terrible of the bad, not just so-so stuff.  Just because a mediocre-fic gets published this way, just because it doesn&#39;t perfectly jive with canon, doesn&#39;t suddenly make it mission-worthy.<br><br>Let&#39;s maybe watch and see what gets published before we have big, divisive arguments over what we can do with that material, maybe, please, hm?  &gt;.&gt;</p>

Arguing over possibilities is going to bring us nowhere.<br><br>Sorry, Huinesoron, if yesterday&#39;s post sounded like I was willing to go fandom police. It&#39;s just...

            <p>And for the record: it&#39;s not that I consider these stories will be in any way canon. I don&#39;t think anyone is actually arguing that.

            <p>Fanfiction today really is &quot;not licensed&quot;, though. There really isn&#39;t that much ambiguity to it, and what ambiguity there is (read as: fair use) is unchanged by some works licensing with some venues.

            <p>This has been argued back and forth a lot (see: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=12a1TnYNeebzroINo1Ti9vILHC-jLNJZCtMBg_64Busc">The Battle of Goldberg</a>). My understanding - and back when we had a resident lawyer (Jocelyn), she gave this interpretation - is that since fanfiction is non-profit, and is presented in such a way that it is impossible to assume it&#39;s the work of the original author, it is not a breach of copyright. If one attempts to charge money for (unlicensed) fanfic - such as that girl who tried to sell her Star Wars novel <i>Another Hope</i> on Amazon - then you&#39;re into &#39;you&#39;re taking money which might otherwise go to the creator&#39; and &#39;people will think this reflects the creator&#39;s wishes&#39;. Those are copyright violations (more the former, I think - the latter may be more of a moral objection).<br><br>This has been, as I say, argued back and forth a lot. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a definitive legal ruling as yet - and to be honest, what that ruling turns out to be will probably depend on whether the copyright holders have heaps of money to throw at the case (since they will, presumably, be against fanfic - otherwise they wouldn&#39;t start the case in the first place!).<br><br>hS</p>

Now &quot;fanfiction&quot; and &quot;licensed&quot; are being used in the same sentence, and I&#39;m worried how potential court rulings might end up if the unlicensed fanfics start being scrutinized more closely by the copyright holders.</p>

            <p>In my mind, fanfic is fanfic and canon is canon. Altering one variable (in this case, formal publication vs. online display) should not change that.<br><br>As far as badfic, that&#39;s at the chooser&#39;s discretion, and the amount of badfic published relies solely on who that judge is and how they filter the stories. If each fanfiction is actually weighed for their merit, edited, proofread, and commented upon before publication, I don&#39;t imagine the PPC will have much to worry about. If every fic passes muster, then we&#39;ll have a lot on our plates.</p>

            <p>Well, it looks like stories will be moderated, so I guess that only decent enough stories will be published. Most of the worst charges are already forbidden, so I am hoping that we&#39;ll have decent stuff. <br><br>Of course, considering that the Inheritance Cycle, Twilight, and Fifty Shades of Gray got published, there might still be stuff deserving sporking.<br><br>About canonicity, I&#39;d say that we need Word of God here - we need to know what the authors of the original works actually think about the Worlds.<br>As a rule of thumb, though, every story is probably going to be a subcanon of its own.<br><br>In fact, this initiative kinda reminds me of Japanese doujin works - in Japan the copyright and royalties riles are more lax, and fanmade novels and mangas are actually allowed to be sold in limited amounts at fairs like Comiket as it is viewed as free publicity for the main franchise.<br><br><br><br>This doesn&#39;t mean that I think that the PPC is out of jurisdiction here, just like it isn&#39;t about doujin works. Unless the author of the original canon themselves say that the story is canon or a official subcanon, it will stay as fanfiction for me, published or not. And so I will feel entitled to mission it if is bad enough.<br><br>It isn&#39;t probably going to happen, though - not only I would have to buy the story from Amazon, and I never bought anything from there at all, but I kinda doubt that anime or video game canons (the ones I&#39;m active in PPC-wise) are going to be included in this initiative.<br><br><br>All in all, though, I think that Kindle Worlds is a good idea.</p>

            <p>That the Star Wars Expanded Universe and the video game novels are meant to be canon or sub-canon since the very beginning. Their authors are choosen or at least accepted by the owners of the rights.<br><br>(Some of those works, though, are apparently in dire need of a sporking - I heard that the Mass Effect novelization was a disaster. But for those there are other sporking means, such as MSTs.)<br><br>The &quot;problem&quot; with Kindle Worlds is in their status: &quot;published fanfiction&quot;<br><br>They are sold, but they&#39;re <i>fanfiction</i>. The work of a single fan, that goes unchecked until it is sent to Amazon for publishing.<br><br>Tell me, what would be the difference between this and FF.net if they actually enforced the latter&#39;s rules about quality?<br><br>That we pay for one, and not for the other.<br><br>Now, if Fanfiction.net started making the users pay to read the fanfics on it, would that mean that all of those instantly become &quot;published canons&quot;?<br><br>No. Because they&#39;re still <i>fanfiction</i>.<br><br>If an author decided to collect the best fanfictions about his work(obviously with their authors&#39; consent) and publish an anthology, would it be a &quot;published canon&quot;?<br><br>No, because it would be a published anthology of <i>fanfiction</i>.<br>That is, unless the original work&#39;s author specifies that he considers the plot of those canon or an existing alternate universe (sub-canon). Only then it would be out of PPC jurisdiction, IMHO.<br><br>The point I want to bring home is: publishing alone doesn&#39;t make a fanfiction into canon or a subcanon.<br><br><br>I can be missing some distinction somewhere, though, so feel free to point out any flaws in my reasoning.</p>

            <p>Is the fact that it still says fanfiction right there on the tin. Even Amazon calls it that. Actually they call it &#39;fan fiction&#39;, but same difference.<br><br>But I suppose there&#39;s no reason not to err on the side of considering it all licensed and thus harmless.<br>After all, IIRC the reason the PPC do not spork published derivative works, even if they are bad, is that they form their own separate canons and can longer hurt the original story; thus there&#39;s no reason to kill them.

Therefore, all the arguments in the world that this is different, you don&#39;t trust Amazon, it doesn&#39;t count, etc, are actually moot points, because PPC policy says &quot;We don&#39;t do that.&quot; Therefore... we don&#39;t do that. Absolutely, you and Sergio should feel free, as stated above, to do what you like under your own name, as is and should ever be your right. But the PPC is not in the business of mucking with published works. It is just that simple.</p>

            <p>Y&#39;see, the issue is that <i>the PPC does not mission works that have been published in a professional capacity</i>.  This is because, wellm there&#39;s a few reasons.<br><br>1) you&#39;d have to pay for them.  Half the fun of missions is reading the original badfic!  It&#39;s a bit difficult to do so if you have to pay to see it!<br><br>2) Whether it&#39;s explicitly canon or not, this has been published by people who have the rights to the original works.  I can&#39;t speak for anybody else, but that&#39;s far more of a grey area than I&#39;m willing to work with.<br><br>3) Since it&#39;s been published by those who have the ability to do so, I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s an optional canon.  If you don&#39;t want to accept it, that&#39;s fine, but there still might be those who&#39;d go &quot;Oh, yes, this works perfectly!&quot;  It would be a sort of semi-canon fanon, if that makes sense.<br><br>If you reply (or if anybody else has an issue with these!), it might be a bit easier if you label stuff as you address it, just to keep everything tidy.<br><br>Cheers!<br>-Tray</p>

            <p>Slorp&#39;s only shown up once in the PPC stories proper, so if he, or his progeny in that case, gets a sequel, it would just be an extension of that story, and it would probably still work in a narrative sense.<br><br>Then again, if everyone and their mini starts writing stories about finding Slorp or Slorp derivatives in everything, <i>then</i> it would get old really fast. Once or twice, and it&#39;s still a novelty. If it gets to ten or twelve times, people would have gotten tired of seeing it long ago.

            <p>Even if a prospective weaponsmith does manage to get a Slorp sample, which would involve a probably-unsanctioned form of timestream-crossing, throwing it onto a Sue or otherwise using it to destroy a Sue would just give the Slorpling more biomass.<br><br>Slorp is made of Sue-flesh. Slorp is capable of subsuming other creatures and gaining their abilities. Those two points, when combined, would make a Slorp-weapon a bigger danger to the continuum than the Sue would have been by herself.

            <p>Since my agent candidate has had a most tragic past (which I hope to never have to mention in depth and in story, as I believe it may lead to wangst or trajeck that promptly satirises itself in large doses, despite being quite logical in short bursts) it seems indeed logical to give him a certain cautionary instinct when dealing with other people - resulting in, yes, a lack of emotional display.<br><br>When occupied with his work, however, these restrictions should fall: Post-runaway (after recovering from the euphoric high brought about by being free of the parental-repression-from-hell that every teenager fears, which in his case was on crack, Pink Stuff and Deathsticks - snark) he focused all his attention on establishing his chances at a regulated life, becoming a survivor.<br><br>As he realised survival was going to hinge on successfully working a job he became a consummate professional, which became especially noticeable during his early military days where he would refuse to socialise with the rest of his unit and seemed most alive on missions - reserving, as some of his fellows sneered, more feelings for the enemy and the shots exchanged than them.<br><br>In his future at the Agency this will likely mean that unless FicPsy show themselves ready to take a good long look at him he will be a most boring RC-mate and a potentially overzealous mission partner.<br><br><br>I think it&#39;s becoming evident that while I can&#39;t wait to combat-spork some Sue I very much enjoy psychological banter.<br><br>Anyway, that was the second revision.

            <p>How would you suggest handling a PPC Agent with an origin as an Evangelion alternate-universe OC? Would I be better off not doing it?<br><br>If it helps, her reaction to trauma (like her reaction to most things) is usually to put up a cheerful front, so she shouldn&#39;t come off as excessively gritty or grimdark. In her original story she actually didn&#39;t do much of note except try and make friends/get the other pilots to get along. (Without much success in the second)<br><br>That probably sounds a bit Suish from the description, combined with some of her other character traits, but it&#39;d be more a case of her hiding her problems well (they started to stack up towards the end) and basically using cheer as a defense mechanism. Her being silly or bantering would make perfect sense given her personality.<br><br>Is that too grim or do you think that would work?</p>

            <p>I really do. Therefore I&#39;ll be coming up with something I haven&#39;t yet said. Or, eh, written.<br><br><br>As far as my reading of the original series has shown: PPC agents are anything but normal. They approach normal, they resemble normal, but they most definitely are not normal.<br>They are in sanity&#39;s uncanny valley, which creates their comedic capabilities - they act similarly to normal people, but have, for instance, far greater aggressive tendencies (and consequently, violence tolerance).<br><br>Next item on the list: I will be using the term FicPsy because my keyboard is about to fall apart and two characters are enormously significant to its continued existence.<br>This isn&#39;t true, but I&#39;m stubborn like that, so fire away.<br><br>I will also be sending my guy to FicPsy (ha!) in order to have him turned into an uncanny-normal person, his de-crazyfication will be executed in a comically serious manner in order to provide the spirit required.<br>Or he&#39;ll just waltz out of there with everything already fixed because things will be like just now and I&#39;m too tired to write up the necessary backstory.<br><br><br>For some reason I am under the impression removing his restraints actually may be <i>more</i> likely to turn him grim. I can&#39;t logically comprehend this, so I&#39;ll just ditch it and go to bed.<br><br><br>Anyway, don&#39;t you guys worry. For whatever way you&#39;ve found he could conflict with PPC canon I have a workaround that guaranteedly will leave someone unhappy!

Adding backstory later on works, but I&#39;m not sure about starting out 100% grim and making fun of his dire situations (since that can also be seen as trivialization).<br><br>Not to mention that I&#39;m not sure how FicPsych would &quot;de-crazify&quot; him or &quot;turn him into an uncanny-normal person.&quot; That sounds like brainwashing to me.<br><br>Also, I think I&#39;m going to call you Demonfriend. It&#39;s not how you spell it. My fingers just refuse to type it like any other way. This isn&#39;t true, but I&#39;m stubborn like that, so fire away (ha!).</p>

            <p>Notice that I don&#39;t say &quot;the month before.&quot; It&#39;s not actually a month; it&#39;s however long it takes for you to settle in with the community. Some people have waited multiple months or even years before asking for Permission.<br><br>What that time is for is to interact with us, to get to know us and let us get to know you so we can all see if we actually get along, to talk about whatever subjects interest you (surely you&#39;re interested in something besides your own characters?), and to learn our ways and established conventions.<br><br>That last bit is important. If you&#39;re going to ignore the advice of other members and throw our conventions out the window because you&#39;re &quot;just stubborn like that,&quot; you will not be on the road to Permission any time soon. I have a particular fondness for FicPsych, so if you specifically want to annoy <i>me</i>, by all means keep spelling it wrong, and make sure you go &quot;ha!&quot; every time so I know you&#39;re being deliberately disrespectful.<br><br>On the other hand, if you actually <i>do</i> want Permission at some point, you could try taking the good advice people like SeaTurtle and Ellipsis Flood are giving you, and you could own up to the mistakes you make instead of, for instance, blaming the forum in all-caps.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

What we&#39;re asking you is to get to know us, the authors of the (continuing) organisation, as a fellow-author and part of the group. And in that sense, you&#39;re not a non-acknowledged part, you are a functioning member.<br><br>We prefer functioning members of the group to react respectfully to fellow members, and talk about things <i>other than</i> their characters.

            <p>Perhaps the issue lies in a simple misunderstanding?<br><br>DemonFiren, the PPC board is not actually a part of the PPC universe. The agents are not aware of the board (mostly)* nor are the people who post here posting as their agents (again, mostly)**. Yes people post about their missions here, ask for betas and advice, you can seek permission here after a while and once you have permission (or are close probably, but I wouldn&#39;t swear to that) you can ask for help tweaking your agents. But mostly it&#39;s a place to socialize with other people who have similar fandoms and interests, much like most forums online, and a place to commiserate about bad fic with people who feel the same about it. <br><br>*There was that one (or couple) time(s) which kind of ended less than ideally for the agents involved. If you would like to read about what happened when they did find us, Huinesoron chronicled it <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/SwansEgg.htm">here</a><br><br>**Sometimes there will be an RP thread pop up and people RP as their agents, but not as their agents on the board, just as if it were happening in HQ.<br><br><i>After all I am not officially involved, it would cause a metafictional breach. Surely you will not be interested in yet another plothole in the form of, say, medicaton invented by no one at all.</i><br><br>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by this, but if it&#39;s because, as I was thinking you maybe weren&#39;t aware the board was not a part of the PPC universe, then have no fear, it&#39;s not! So as <br>As Neshomeh said hang around, <i>...interact with us, to get to know us and let us get to know you so we can all see if we actually get along, to talk about whatever subjects interest you, and to learn our ways and established conventions.</i> I&#39;ve hung around since February and I don&#39;t have agents yet, <s>unless you count the less than fleshed out one that will be based on a friend that was only named on the LiveJournal mini-Balrog adoptions because my friend who the agent will be based on wanted her agent to have a mini-Balrog.</s> Regardless, I&#39;ve been posting here and there since February and haven&#39;t got any agents, nor have I applied for permission yet due to the amount of posting I&#39;ve done, I feel I need to participate a while longer (or much more actively for a shorter period) before taking that step. And I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve created plotholes by existing. (Please someone tell me if I am, and therefore am doing something wrong!) The point is, you don&#39;t have to have an agent or more to hang around and talk to us, so relax, be active, get to know us and vice versa and maybe try bringing these things up again in a month or two. :)<br><br>I apologize if I&#39;m wrong and you already knew all this, just thought I&#39;d toss it out there in case. If you were already aware of this, I shall leave you to continue working it out as you see fit. :)</p>

            <p>Yes, I have two questions about minis:<br><br>1. What happens when a Suethor misspells the name of one of her OCs (that is not a Mary Sue)?<br><br>2. What is the mini of &#39;The Rise of The Guardians&#39; movie? I think it would either be mini-nightmares or mini-elves. (Mini-yetis, maybe?)<br><br>And yes, in case you&#39;re wondering, I am asking these questions because I found a really smelly badfic for &#39;The Rise of The Guardians&#39; that I plan to claim and kill ASAP.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve seen it happen two ways:<br>1) it creates a mini based on the minis for that continuum, but slightly different in some way. Example: In one of KittyNoodles&#39;s missions, a badfic OC organization was mis-capitalized and created a mini-monster(basically a toy car), that was a different color from the others.<br>2) Or, a mini based on the appearance of that OC appears. I <i>know</i> I read a mission with 2) sometime in the last week, but I can&#39;t find it right now. The mini-OC in that mission was a small humanoid with washed-out colors due to the OC being humanoid and the poor descriptive quality of his fic of origin, but the washed-out colors may not be universal for all smaller-OC-style mini-OCs. I&#39;d need to find another example to make sure.<br><br>Second question: a person who creates the first mission in a continuum comes up with the mini on their own. If there are no missions in that continuum, but there is an OFU, that OFU&#39;s minis are treated as the minis for the continuum unless that OFU&#39;s minis were transformed somehow to be better or more uniform guards, which actually happens considerably more often than I thought it did when I first found out that some OFUs did that.</p>

            <p>We&#39;re chugging along, for the most part. The latest excitement is the Blackout event that grew organically from an April Fool&#39;s prank into a fully fledged Thing That Happened, with several writers contributing their own takes on it.

            <p>The difference is, Emergencies are &quot;Hey guys, I just wrote a story that has something affecting all of the PPC whether you want it or not! You gotta <i>deal</i> with it!&quot; and Events are basically something notable happening, but without forcing everyone in HQ to do something about it.<br>It&#39;s still a big deal, but it&#39;s not mandatory to get involved, and if the Blackout is a prime example of an Event, it can be looked at in many different ways. That&#39;s what makes the Blackout interludes so much fun! We can have rampaging monsters, scheming overlords from canceled children&#39;s shows, a search-and-remove mission to Aperture Science, and I&#39;m almost certain there was another completed interlude I&#39;m forgetting about.</p>

            <p>Events and Emergencies are quite similar, and yes, we were trying to move away from them for a few years, because they got out of hand and were becoming problematic. If the Blackout had popped up four years ago, I rather doubt it would have received such a warm welcome.<br><br>But everyone seems to be enjoying this, and it&#39;s fun and has leeway, and those of us who aren&#39;t particularly interested (like myself - many apologies, but I like writing in the Cafeteria partly because it isn&#39;t prone to Big Things Happening) can just sort of... work around the whole thing. Which is nice, and quite considerate. But mainly, we&#39;re out of that awful cycle in which everyone was trying to out-emergency/event each other, and we had a new crisis every month. So the occasional Event is quite welcome.</p>

            <p>I sorta went &quot;...bwah?&quot; when I noticed what was going on, but it&#39;s not like I <i>own</i> the Cafeteria - as with all the PPC, it belongs to all of us! Aside from which, it&#39;s good to be taken out of one&#39;s comfort zone, and this gives me the opportunity to throw new and exciting variables at my team, which could be very good - I&#39;ll have to go through the archives and figure out how.<br><br>(And I imagine dealing with the aftermath - not least, including throwing prone Agents out of the kitchens on their ears - will be rather fun to write.

            <p>Actually, that I kind of do mind. The Cafeteria is not mine, and is, as all HQ, common property. But... my agents are my own creation, and it kind of upsets me that they were used without asking? I&#39;m usually pretty agreeable to Jof being used when people ask, as long as he stays in character (which is sorta my main-er beef - he&#39;s not, really, which is a bit frustrating*), but I would really, really, really prefer that people ask, in the future. I believe my email is available through the Wiki, and if not, it&#39;s just my username here at Gmail. So - please ask, in the future.<br><br>*Jof is agreeable, very quiet, and has a translator from DoSAT, which comes in handy, as he occasionally has about two or three words to spare when necessary. He tends to view his auto-cubing as more of a vague handicap than something that must be emulated.</p>

            <p>So, are those two Agents that you already created going to be removed, or transferred, just abandoned, or what? Actually, since the human appears to have no information about him and the Mandalorian doesn&#39;t seem that bad, maybe you could just rewrite the parts you disliked and feature them in other stories. That&#39;s a practice that&#39;s saved several characters I made.<br><br>What precisely did you dislike about them?<br><br>And like I said in the title, I would like to see some of your character ideas, though admittedly if you make any more based on Star Wars EU, I&#39;m not going to be as much help as I might otherwise.

Would you like e-mails from me and the other Boarders you plan to show ideas to, or would you just post the ideas in a topic somewhere?<br><br></p>

            <p>I suppose I didn&#39;t have clear characterizations in mind for either of them, so they may have come off as a bit bland. I have a rewrite of the Mandalorian and a different agent as works in progress.

            <p>I like the idea of a bubbly and forcibly optimistic Mandalorian. It goes against their Hat of &quot;graar, we are the warrior race&quot; without going so far to make it look like you&#39;re trying to force it. It&#39;s like a Klingon collecting stamps. There&#39;s potential for comedy there.<br><br>The PPC has a lot of deadpan snarker humans(which assumes that you&#39;re still talking about the human here, and that assumption may well be incorrect), but most of that is the result of 1) people like writing about human Agents more than any other species and 2) deadpan snarking is how their writers would like to react to living through a badfic. It could still work, conceivably, but it&#39;s been done a lot.<br><br>Odd couples are always good, though. They keep the banter between the agents interesting, and can help with development of both members.<br><br>If the second person was a different agent than the human, who is it? Not a name, necessarily, because I&#39;m not wanting to rush you if you don&#39;t have one, but species, brief history, and the like wouldn&#39;t hurt. I&#39;d just like to know what I&#39;m analyzing.<br><br>Where are the missions that you made for your two agents before you left? Maybe I could look them over and try to see what was good and bad about the characterization.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve only seen one episode of Firefly, but I&#39;ve seen enough of Joss Whedon&#39;s other work to know what you&#39;re talking about.

            <p>For those who have not stopped by the PPC Wiki in a while, Cyba Zero recently posted a Blackout interlude in the <i>Knightmare</i> continuum. The links are on the Wiki, of course.<br><br>For those of you not in the know (and I was of your number), Knightmare was a British TV series. Think of a cross between a tabletop RPG and a game show.<br><br>That said, I hope you&#39;re reading this, Cyba, because I have a question for you: What made you decide to write the interlude in the Knightmare continuum? Note that I&#39;m not saying that that was a bad thing, mind you: you&#39;ve gotten me interested in the series!</p>

            <p>Glad you like it!<br><br>Why did I decide to write an interlude in the Knightmare continuum? It was something I loved when I was little, and it is a shame it was discontinued. I also thought the spellcasting mechanic was too good to miss, especially given my agents being in the Department of Technical Errors. Knightmare would definitely fall under the rare fandom catagory - so rare, in fact, that I don&#39;t think there is any real badfic to spork. As such, an interlude was my only chance... and the Blackout was the perfect opportunity.<br><br>If you&#39;re interested in the series, this website has some information: <a href="http://www.knightmare.com/"><a href="http://www.knightmare.com/">http://www.knightmare.com/</a></a>.</p>

            <p>So what I got from this was that Mickey Smith had a really sick daughter and Sherlock Holmes offered to help him in return for him becoming a domestic terrorist, and the Enterprise (plus Lara Tyler, the beloved of the Tenth Doctor before he ran off with Merida) is sent after Sherlock in response to the terrorism?<br><br>...well, then.<br><br>Since I&#39;ve absolutely no actual knowledge of Star Trek I liked it well enough. I mean, I hear that the roles of Spock and Kirk were switched in regards to the warp drive scene and my friends and I all laughed at the &#39;KHAAAAAAN&#39; shouting (mostly because I have friends who will shout that anyway, out of the blue) and enjoyed the occasional lens flare, but yeah. I&#39;m pretty okay with the film despite it not passing the Bechdel test and stuff and I&#39;m not entirely sure where the Cumbershower scene was supposed to come in (He doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;s enjoying it very much).<br><br>So.<br><br>That being said, I&#39;m not sure how it played out in the Wrath of Khan but I feel like Benny!Khan was almost a parody Stu at times. Could&#39;ve been that line when he said he was better at everything, could&#39;ve been his special blood, could&#39;ve even been the Single Tear. But I get the feeling that if anyone wanted to write a Sue-villain in anything in the future, they could easily refer to Benny!Khan. </p>

            <p>I regret to inform you that probably none of the Original Series episodes passed the Bechdel Test, and I don&#39;t think any of the movies did either. So I suppose, as this movie is based on the Original Series, it is continuing in that...tradition.<br><br>I would be able to tolerate that, if I didn&#39;t know Star Trek could do better. Three of the other four Star Trek series - The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager - had two or more female regulars and probably passed the Bechdel Test more than half the time. Voyager probably passed it every episode, since it had a female captain and several other strong female characters. So the treatment of women in NuTrek is one of my main problems with it, because I feel like if you&#39;re going to make a reboot, then you should try to fix some things about the original that are outdated.<br><br>Such as always using sexy women for fanservice. I&#39;m sorry J.J., but Kirk shirtless for a couple seconds is not equal fanservice to a lingerie scene where she practically strikes a pose. Besides, it&#39;s Kirk. All the fangirls like Spock. Now, if they&#39;d kept the Cumbershower scene...<br><br>They should really know by now that females love Star Trek. In fact, Star Trek has <i>never</i> been the male-dominated fandom it&#39;s made out to be. The fan who organized the letter campaign that kept TOS on the air <i>in the Sixties</i> was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjo_Trimble">woman</a>.<br><br>So yeah, I agree that while I mostly liked the movie, it did have some flaws in that area.<br></p>

            <p>I really liked it. My only issue was that the pacing was bad. All the intensity was at the end. Kahn is a fantastic villain, but there wasn&#39;t enough set up for his evilness before he started helping them out. My mother thought they should have set up the guy with the sick daughter near the beginning a bit more, as it would emphasized the whole &quot;doing anything for your family&quot; theme. Plus a few of the characters were a bit underused.<br>Good things were much more plenty, however, and that sold it for me. Lots of jokes and nods to the prime universe kept me spurting random giggles throughout the film. I was kind of freaking out, because as soon as Kirk went thought that glass door, I was thinking &quot;Oh, goodness, it&#39;s going to be like Wrath of Kahn. Only with Kirk on the opposite side of the door.&quot; I almost yelled &quot;KAAAAAHHHHNNN!&quot; with Spock. But people in the theater would have gotten mad.<br>Anyway, now I want to go watch Wrath of Kahn again. *loads up Netflix*</p>

            <p>To start with something positive, as a complete and total Trekkie, I also enjoyed the references to various TOS things (I love me some tribbles). I also enjoyed just about everything in the movie until the big reveal. I think Benny Cucumberpatch did very well with what he was given. <br><br>Now on to my (what will probably become very long) opinionated review.<br><br>Honestly, this movie proves to me that I can&#39;t trust JJ Abrams to give us nice things. I loved the 2009 movie because it was completely original and started fresh with the TOS characters. Keenser and Scotty will forever skip off to a rainbow sunset while holding hands. Anyways, on to Into Darkness. I like that we got to see Kirk get some rather serious consequences for his actions. (And we can ignore the painfully bad science with regards to &#39;stopping&#39; the volcano.) I always enjoy seeing Pike because I love the original pilot (ignoring the ridiculous sexism, etc). His relationship with Kirk makes me go all fuzzy inside and his death really hit me. Go JJ for that one, I guess.  <br><br>I like the mystery surrounding John Harrison. Kirk does his usual hint-of-Wesley-Crusher for the movies by noticing random things during the meeting after Harrison blows up the Archives. People have pointed out that there were some women in that meeting, but JJ obviously didn&#39;t spend enough time pointing the camera at them for me to notice. This is one of my huge issues with these movies- the lack of women. We get Uhura, whose only purpose seems to be to whinge about Spock while having occasional awesome moments (such as her interaction with the Klingons and later when she helps recapture Harrison). Carol Marcus was only &#39;useful&#39; for an unnecessary scene in her underwear. I mean, they even wrote Bones hitting on her after she disarmed the torpedo. Way to undermine what she just did. I would have liked it if the writers put more thought into her character and let her have some interaction with Uhura (that isn&#39;t a conversation about men). I also grew fond of that one navigator who took over for Chekov. She seemed pretty cool for all her 30 seconds on screen.<br><br>Still on the topic of Carol Marcus, I knew that Khan was going to be involved because Marcus was only in The Wrath of Khan. I was hoping that it wouldn&#39;t be true, but of course it was. The writers could have used the opportunity of the AU to get really creative, but they decided to rehash an already great movie and whitewash it some more in the process. Look up some of John Cho&#39;s interviews where he takes every opportunity to slam JJ about the lack of PoC in the movie and you will see what I mean. Others have written about this issue, and probably even more eloquently, but I just about flipped when I heard Benny say he was Khan. Ricardo Montalban is Mexican, so of course in the sixties they did the all-the-brown-people-are-the-same crap, but at least Khan was an intelligent villain who happened to be a PoC. Many reviewers on the internet have commented about how intelligent villains are rarely PoC and you can probably find those on LJ among other places. <br><br>There isn&#39;t much to say about the plot because most of it was already done in Wrath of Khan. The random cameo of Nimoy!Spock really threw me out of the movie and didn&#39;t seem necessary. I suppose Admiral Marcus was an interesting villain. His death was gruesome and fitting to Khan&#39;s feelings about his betrayal. The contrast between a warmongering admiral and a largely peaceful Starfleet makes for interesting conflict and I think Marcus could have been the villain for a completely different story. I mean, this plot could have been done with many tweaks without Khan. One thing about Khan that is so interesting is his relationship with Kirk and how the events of Space Seed affected Khan and lead him to want to get revenge on a character that we actually care about. I think a problem with the movie is that I don&#39;t care about Marcus and there isn&#39;t really much between Kirk and Khan besides some manipulation. <br><br>What was up with the Klingon design, though? I mean they looked something freaky. <br><br>TLDR; the whitewashing, lack of women, and a thrown away opportunity to do a new story really make this movie a disappointment. They should have just repeated the deleted shower scene on a loop for two hours.</p>

            <p>I was also hugely disappointed by how tiny outer space felt in the movie. Khan bails out of a gunship by teleporting to <i>Qo&#39;nos</i>, for pete&#39;s sake. The Enterprise warps there, sends people down to the surface, and then warps back <i>in a single day</i>. It&#39;s against the basic premise that I expect from Trek, which is that Space is really, really big.<br><br>And they whitewashed Khan, which made me sad. Benny did an <i>amazing</i> job of selling the character, but it just wasn&#39;t the same.</p>

            <p>Because I loved it! I mean, seriously loved it. After it was done, I fell to my knees like a religious person after they&#39;d gotten a revelation from their God. (Yes, I just compared Star Trek to religion. It&#39;s not like the fandom is anything like a cult, right?) I nearly cried. You see, I had such high expectations: a Star Trek movie with Benedict Cumberbatch, supposedly an iconic TOS villain, and I had been so afraid that it wouldn&#39;t meet my expectations.<br><br>And it did! It was everything I hoped and wished, and...<br><br>I should probably stop gushing and actually say what I loved. It&#39;s just...it was a profound experience. <br><br>I too loved all the references to prime universe Trek. They helped me feel like this was Star Trek, the universe I was used to. Rewatching the first reboot after watching lots of prime universe Trek, it took until McCoy&#39;s &quot;Dammit man, I&#39;m a doctor, not a physicist!&quot; line to make me feel like it was Trek. This one, it was pretty early on when they mentioned the Prime Directive. And just catching all the references made me feel smart...let&#39;s see:<br><br>-Offhand reference to Gorn<br>-Tribble<br>-KHAN!!!<br>-Section 31<br>-An evil admiral<br>-Scotty&#39;s a miracle worker<br>-Sulu being captain<br>-Redshirt<br><br>I&#39;ll probably get more after I see it again tomorrow evening.<br><br>Also, I loved how the main moral of the movie was that Starfleet was exploration, not military. Most of the previews before it were apocalypse movies, and it was wonderful to see it affirming Star Trek&#39;s vision of a peaceful future. <br><br>And Benedict Cumberbatch, is, as usual, fabulous. The only thing I can say is that he doesn&#39;t look much like Ricardo Montalban, and most reboot characters look like their prime counterparts. But he acted well, as expected.<br><br>And speaking of acting, I think that the actors were getting closer to their TOS counterparts. Dare I say, Chris Pine plays Kirk better than Shatner - the same character, but with less...scenery chewing and...excessive hamminess. And random...pauses. But everyone was much closer to their original counterparts. My theory is that they tried to lure in new Trekkies with the first reboot, which was not as close to original Trek. Now, they know they&#39;ve converted people, so they&#39;re making this one closer. Or the actors have had more time to study up.<br><br>Also, TOS didn&#39;t develop characters other than Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, and this seems to be going towards developing them more. Special mention goes to Scotty and his heroism. I&#39;m much more of a Scotty fan than I was. <br><br>Sadly, no movie is perfect. There was one thing I didn&#39;t like, and didn&#39;t like about the first one: Spock/Uhura. It lacked development, which made it feel very strange. Like, a female character can&#39;t just be a well-rounded, interesting person. She has to be the love interest just because she&#39;s the one female main character?  Deanna Troi and Riker end their relationship because they&#39;re serving on the same ship. Wouldn&#39;t Spock see the same logic? Uhura as love interest is a step back for Star Trek. You go from B&#39;Elanna and Tom, whose relationship developed over several seasons of Voyager, to this. It makes me sad to think that there&#39;s still this prevalent idea in our society that male characters can stay single, but female characters must be the love interest. And don&#39;t get me started on Carol Marcus&#39;s blatant fanservice. You know, writers, Star Trek fans aren&#39;t all straight guys anymore.<br><br>But I hate to end on that note, so I&#39;ll end with how this is the first Star Trek movie where I&#39;ve really understood where the Spirk shippers are coming from. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s just my squicked out reaction to shipping anything with Shatner, combined with my dislike of Spock/Uhura, but for some reason the reverse scene to the one in Wrath of Khan felt much more slashy this time around. I really felt the depth of their feelings for each other much more than I did when I had to wade through Shatner-speak. That scene choked me up in the best possible way.<br><br>Overall, it was awesome, and I&#39;m looking forward to seeing it again tomorrow night. <br><br>And now anyone reading this is probably glad I&#39;m done rambling.<br></p>

            <p>When Khan was first introduced in the film, who else mentaly (or physically) shouted KHAAAAAAAAN!! Because I did, and then waited for Kirk to let one loose.

            <p>I personally thought that the scene in the Radiation Chamber was one of the worst done in the movie. It was basically taking dialogue from Wrath of Khan and altering it so that it would be mirrored. The reason that it worked in Khan was that Kirk and Spock had a 20 year long relationship, and Spock wasn&#39;t even the one showing emotions! To have Quinto&#39;s Spock explode emotionally over a man he had known for only a year... just was too OOC. Aside from that scene, I didn&#39;t have many problems with it.<br></p>

            <p>I meant that the scene felt more slashy, not that it was better than Wrath of Khan. I can see how you got that impression, since right after it I said I could feel the deep connection more. I was just referring to the movie overall. Bad communication on my part.<br><br> You&#39;re right about having Spock do the whole &quot;KHAN!!!&quot; thing. At the moment, I was too caught up in the reference, but looking back, it is kind of like they did it just for said reference. While new Spock is moreâ€¦how do I put itâ€¦breakable than old Spock, that was still excessive. The tears, since they were very restrained, worked better, and I did cry at that scene because Spock was crying. <br><br>Then again, I always cry when good guys die. Even if I know they&#39;re going to come back. Heck, even if I didn&#39;t like the character, I still cry if the other characters are sad. So it could just be me.</p>

            <p>I personally don&#39;t think much of Mary Sue litmus tests, as they&#39;re more a list of common symptoms than an actual assessment of Sue-ishness. But I can&#39;t help noticing that one of the major ways to rack up some Sue points is to write an OC relating to canon characters.<br>I&#39;m currently working on a fanfic for the Hobbit fandom, and my narrator Risa is, not very originally, the daughter of Thorin Oakenshield. I have tried very hard to keep her out of Sue territory, and she is deeply flawed in numerous ways, but I&#39;m concerned that even just by being related to a central canon and by breaking the canon, she&#39;s already beyond hope of salvation.<br>Does breaking canon and being the child of an existing character make an OC a Sue? How can I be sure that she doesn&#39;t become one- other than piling on the flaws, which I don&#39;t think is particularly effective?<br>Thanks in advance!<br>-- Len</p>

            <p><i>&quot;I have tried very hard to keep her out of Sue territory, and she is deeply flawed in numerous ways,&quot;</i><br><br>More often than not, unless the flaws in question actually effect the character beyond giving them a shield against critics in the form of &quot;Mary Sues are flawless, so my characters can&#39;t be Sues because they have flaws&quot;, it really only adds fuel to the Sue fire.<br><br>What works better is having the character discover these flaws as they go along. It&#39;s more realistic then, and gives a more human feel to the character - makes them relatable, if you will - and doesn&#39;t end up seeming like a preemptive defense against potential critics like the &quot;Oh yeah, and I have such and such things wrong with me&quot; approach does.<br><br>For my character Iris, terrible misfortune is her flaw, and it&#39;s because of one instance where she had the misfortune of running head-long into a dragon and all she had was a bow and a hunting knife. From there, it developed into the full symptom of not being able to do hardly anything without something bad happening to her, such as her boyfriend Drake chucking a pebble and knocking her out of a boat from the force of the throw.</p>

            <p>Okay, let me rephrase that bit. What I meant to say but apparently only telepathically typed (I do this sometimes when it&#39;s late.) was that I realize Sues have less to do with the number of flaws than with the consequences of those flaws and how the plot and other characters bend around them, and so even though she is flawed, I am still concerned because of the canon-breaking and genetics, and am wondering if anyone has tips on how to write an AU and significant canon relative without turning it into a Suefic.</p>

            <p>The main cast were directly, but indirectly (they were there but didn&#39;t do much) involved with the main plot, and were more for interaction with themselves, the main cast and other people.<br><br>I say this a good deal when I&#39;m writing new material - it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be a huge, overarching plot of good versus evil, that&#39;s just what sells for big bucks, and understandably so because people enjoy watching a moral smackdown. Good stories can also be written about simplistic things.<br><br>There was one I wrote, or tried to, a few years back that focused on a defecting soldier and his romance with an artist. The worst violence that ended up happening was the skirmish that he bolted from in the first chapter (but only because I ended up abandoning the story because I didn&#39;t know my materials all that well. I was twelve, keep in mind.)<br><br>I&#39;m just saying, if you need to write an AU relationship without the Sued-effects (see what I did there?), you could just craft the plot around that primarily, and everything else as just a side plot for the sake of keeping with a specific timeline.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve also worked on plots with a similar sort of idea.<br><br>That&#39;s not quite what I had in mind with this one (although the concept of more emphasis on the characters and less on the combat and salvation of the realm is the same basic mindset) but I definitely like the suggestion! At this point I think it would be easiest to swap out the setting and race, as the plot can probably stand just fine on its own without the quest.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, you can definitely place flaws on your character - goodness knows that Tolkien&#39;s characters are flawed, after all - just be sure to do it believably. Write the character as realistic to the setting as you can, don&#39;t just make her super great and then tack on downsides after the fact.<br><br>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Since I suspect your feeling this way may be my fault. &gt;.&gt;;<br><br>Talking about writing questions that involve stuff you are working on is not bad at all! As you can see, many of us are happy to discuss all manner of fanfic- and writing-related topics. What I recently took issue with was a newbie starting multiple threads seemingly for the sole purpose of discussing their potential agent and refusing to drop it when asked, i.e. obsessing over Permission before it&#39;s even remotely appropriate. That&#39;s totally different from what you&#39;re doing here. {= )<br><br>To address the actual topic, I would just ask one semi-rhetorical question: Why is it important that the character be Thorin&#39;s daughter? And its semi-rhetorical corollary: Why can&#39;t the story be told any other way?<br><br>I say semi-rhetorical because I don&#39;t necessarily need to know the answers, and there aren&#39;t any guaranteed right answers. It&#39;s more of a &quot;search your feelings: you know it to be Sue!&quot; (or not-Sue, but that doesn&#39;t fit the quote) sort of deal.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Before I noticed your reply, I addressed this with a post aimed at another user, who had said that Dwarves were immune to disease, which is an absolute roadblock to the storyline, as it calls for an outbreak of septicemic plague. Which got me thinking that I either had to re-outline the second half of the fic or switch races- and thus, setting and family. Which in turn inspired me to wonder why it was even important that she be a Durin, and while I&#39;m sure there was some reason those months ago when I dreamed up the idea... I can&#39;t for the life of me remember it.<br><br>So it&#39;s exactly what you said: I have no clue why it was important.<br><br>That clears up my issue, then, because by switching out her race for human, getting away from the canon relatives and the breaking of canon (by existing and by following the Company), I can now concentrate on the character herself. Focusing just on characterization should drastically decrease her chances of Suedom, and I won&#39;t have to fuss over the AU, since it won&#39;t be.<br><br>And the point of the story all along was the character development and the hardships each character has to go through, not the reclamation of Erebor, so changing the setting won&#39;t be a huge problem.</p>

            <p>Unlike virtually any other canon I&#39;ve read, there&#39;s just <i>so much stuff</i> - and all of it interconnected. For your idea, we know exactly how this character lived - how her home supported itself (trade with Mirkwood), what sort of perils they faced (mostly a certain dragon), the major trials (the Thorin Incident), and what ultimately happened to her (either died peacefully, or lived through/died in the Siege of Erebor during the War of the Ring).<br><br>And I love that... sense of world-out-there. The fact that, to take a random example, Shelob might once have spun her webs between Treebeard&#39;s herds - back when she was in Nan Dungortheb with the rest of Ungoliant&#39;s spawn, and he was:<br><br><i>To the pine-trees upon the highland of Dorthonion I climbed in the Winter.<br>Ah! the wind and the whiteness and the black branches of Winter on Orod-na-Thon!<br>My voice went up and sang in the sky...</i><br><br>It&#39;s just... connections all the way, back into the deeps of time (and where was Fangorn when Durin awoke for the first time in the forested heights of the Misty Mountains...?).

            <p>You are correct; Mary-Sue litmus tests tend to test for symptoms. This is because there is unfortunately no uniform definition for Mary-Sue across all of fandom, but we think we know it when we see it. However, I believe that if you can pass the PPC standard, you can pass anybody&#39;s standard (unless your critic is a purist who hates any OC, much less any female OC).<br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mary_Sue">The PPC Wiki page on Mary Sues</a> gives an adequate definition, but I highly prefer <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=239059;search_term=context+treatment">the one given by Neshomeh in a not-so-recent discussion</a>: a Mary Sue<br>&quot;A. does not behave like a believable-for-the-context person, B. does not get believable-for-the-context treatment from others, and C. is successful just because the plot says so.&quot;<br><br>That said, the mere existence of a relationship between your OC and Thorin Oakenshield is not, in and of itself, a sentence of Suedom. What is important is that the OC look like she <i>belongs</i> in Middle-earth. So, a few questions:<br><br>1) Did you explain how your OC could possibly be the daughter of Thorin Oakenshield? E.g., Does Thorin has so many children that your OC could presumably have been one of them (but was never centrally figured in the canon story), or are you just trying to shoehorn her into the Oakenshield family?<br><br>2) Does she act like a daughter of Thorin? Thorin being a dwarf king, does she act like a canonical Tolkien-verse dwarf princess would act? And if not, did you create a <i>plausible</i> reason why not?<br><br>The difference between a well-written OC and a Mary-Sue is not the mere presence or absence of  faults; a Sue is a Sue because she warps canon.</p>

            <p>A canon&#39;s-relative OC isn&#39;t necessarily doomed to become a Sue, but they would have a harsher start than most other OCs that just start out with tangential connections like being from the same clan or homeland as a canon character.<br>You&#39;d need to adequately explain the canon character&#39;s past history in a way that allows for the character&#39;s presence without distorting the sequence of their past life enormously(assuming you aren&#39;t going for a full-on AU here, because those have different standards for what does and does not constitute acceptable changes to history), and you&#39;d need to come up with a plausible reason why the OC would never have been mentioned by the canon in their journeys.<br><br>In Thorin&#39;s case, this would be especially tricky, since he&#39;s said to be among the last of his line of Dwarf Lords and there would probably be a big to-do about him having a child, but it&#39;s not impossible.<br><br>And it&#39;s not all about piling on flaws, even though giving a character flaws is a big part of making them seem realistic. It&#39;s about piling on what makes a character or circumstance interesting. Not what makes them &quot;good&quot;, because there&#39;s a distinct difference there. I&#39;d object to the term &quot;piling on&quot; as well, but I&#39;m not going to start dissecting word choice here.<br><br>See, one of a Sue&#39;s main problems is that she forces the canon characters to feel bad for her, or love her, or be interested in her, but the readers are not. If a character is interesting and well-formed enough, a canon&#39;s reaction to their situation should be something that would be a logical reaction based on their character and how well they know the OC.<br>While a Sue would cause someone to fall in love with her or sympathize with her immediately just because she&#39;s &quot;different&quot; or some such, a more well-rounded OC would cause such matters to happen gradually, or at least logically, based on the characters she&#39;s affecting and their personalities. People don&#39;t get suspicious with Mary Sue, they don&#39;t get angry at Mary Sue unless it&#39;s set up to make her look better, and they don&#39;t ever second-guess her or make her pull her own weight. A well-rounded OC, on the other hand, should be susceptible to the same problems that a canon character in their situation would undergo, and would thus possibly have to deal with all of those.<br>I&#39;d say the first of those three especially with a Thorin&#39;s-daughter OC. Where did she come from? the other dwarves would think. Why did Thorin never mention his past relationships? Does this mean he&#39;s got a lover somewhere? They&#39;d see the strange occurrence as what it was, and react accordingly, and this would probably make your OC uneasy, and she would react. That might actually place seeds for a character arc for someone there.<br><br>In addition to what I said before, you need to make the events plausible within the world you created or are using, you need to have setup and buildup, and everything needs to lead together. If something starts happening seemingly &quot;just because&quot;, you&#39;ve got a problem. If reactions become overblown or too unrealistically subdued, that&#39;s another problem, etcetera etcetera. As long as you keep in mind what you want to do with the story and what to stay away from getting there to keep the characters from getting Sue-d, there&#39;s nothing keeping a canon&#39;s-duaghter OC from becoming a decent and well-rounded member of a cast of characters.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the advice!<br>As it so happens, the story does evolve into total AU, which is part of what worries me. Far as background goes, there weren&#39;t any particularly strange occurences. I did my best to keep it plausible, although it&#39;s certainly a breach of canon anyway. Through an arranged marriage, Thorin and a fairly well-respected dwarf maiden bore three children- one son and two daughters. He and his wife had a cordial, ordinary relationship until the Smaug incident. After the dwarves were driven out of Erebor, Thorin&#39;s wife and youngest daughter died of illness and starvation. His eldest son was killed during the struggle at Moria, leaving only the autistic middle child, Ri, who is the MC.<br>From there the story follows the plot of the book and movie, with added character development and, of course, the additional character herself. (She has mild separation anxiety and tried to follow the Company to the Shire.) However, at the audience with the goblin king things go horribly awry and after that it is almost entirely AU.<br>Also, I think it&#39;s worth noting that I did not, in fact, choose her family just to write about FÃ­li and KÃ­li, although they are influential in the story. Honestly, I have a soft spot for Bofur.<br>I guess I&#39;m concerned about the clichÃ© elements of the exposition and the major breaks of canon. I have never written an AU before, so this is a new experience for me, so if anyone is more seasoned in the art, I&#39;d gladly listen to any suggestions.<br>This is quite the ramble. Apologies if it no longer makes sense.</p>

            <p>It says <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dwarf-women">here</a> that Dwarf women marry once and for life or not at all, either because of their work, their fancied one already being taken, or their simple lack of desire to marry. That can be interpreted to say they have free will in spousal choice, so an arranged marriage seems a bit out of place. Personally, I think that free will is a huge deal amongst the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, and with that comes the ability to marry for love (for life). <br><br>True, since Thorin is Dwarvish royalty he could have been pressured somewhat to continue the family line, but could he not have found an eligible Dwarf lady on his own?<br><br>I mean, I&#39;m not telling you to do anything, really; I&#39;m just voicing my disagreement with placing an arranged marriage into a culture where an arranged marriage might not necessarily make sense.</p>

            <p>(I have always found the <i>History of Middle-earth</i> to be invaluable in writing stories)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&quot;The Naugrim [Dwarves] were ever, as they still remain, short and squat in stature; they were deep-breasted, strong in the arm, and stout in the leg, and their beards were long. Indeed this strangeness they have that no Man or Elf has ever seen a beardless Dwarf - unless he were shaven in mockery, and would then be more like to die of shame than of many other hurts that to us would seem more deadly. For the Naugrim have beards from the beginning of their lives, male and female alike; nor indeed can their womenkind be discerned by those of other race, be it in feature or in gait or in voice, nor in any wise save this: that they go not to war, and seldom save at direst need issue from their deep bowers and halls. It is said, also, that their womenkind are few, and that save their kings and chieftains few Dwarves ever wed; wherefore their race multiplied slowly, and now is dwindling.&quot; (<i>HoME XI, The War of the Jewels</i>. These are described as being the words of Pengolod, an elf of Gondolin in the First Age. There&#39;s no indication that he&#39;d actually met any Dwarves)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&quot;In their own tongue the Dwarves name themselves KhazÃ¢d; and the Dark-elves called them the Naugrim, the stunted. Which name the exiled Noldor likewise took for them...&quot; (Same source)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>It should also be noted that the race of Dwarves descending from Durin are called the Longbeards, &#39;for their beards swept the floor before their feet&#39;. None of the other races of the Dwarves are known to be extant in western Middle-earth, but they do exist. More specifically, the Firebeards and Broadbeams may be extinct, having lived in the mountains of Beleriand before it sank. The Ironfists and Stiffbeards, Blacklocks and Stonefoots awakened much further east. (Summarised from <i>HoME XII: The Peoples of Middle-earth</i>)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&quot;Such dealings with their dead [burning the dead after the battle of Azanulbizar outside Moria] seemed grievous to the Dwarves, for it was against their use; but to make such tombs as they were accustomed to build (since they will lay their dead only in stone not in earth) would have taken many years. To fire therefore they turned, rather than leave their kin to beast or bird or carrion-orc. But those who fell in Azanulbizar were honoured in memory, and to this day a Dwarf will say proudly of one of his sires: &#39;he was a burned Dwarf&#39;, and that is enough.&quot; (<i>Lord of the Rings: Appendix A - Part III</i>. Irrelevant, but a nice bit of lore)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&quot;They [the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains, ie Thorin&#39;s people] had very few women-folk. DÃ­s ThrÃ¡in&#39;s daughter was there. She was he mother of FÃ­li and KÃ­li, who were born in the Ered Luin. Thorin had no wife.&quot; (Same source)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&quot;DÃ­s was the daughter of ThrÃ¡in II. She is the only dwarf-woman named in these histories. It was said by Gimli that there are few dwarf-women, probably no more than a third of their whole people. They seldom walk abroad except at great need. They are in voice and appearance, and in garb if they must go on a journey, so like to the dwarf-men that the eyes and ears of other peoples cannot tell them apart. This has given rise to the foolish opinion among Men that there are no dwarf-women, and that the Dwarves &#39;grow out of stone&#39;.<br><br>&quot;It is because of the fewness of women among them that the kind of the Dwarves increases slowly, and is in peril when they have no secure dwellings. For Dwarves take only one wife or husband each in their lives, and are jealous, as in all matters of their rights. The number of dwarf-men that marry is actually less than one-third. For not all the women take husbands; some desire one that they cannot get, and so will have no other. As for the men, very many also do not desire marriage, being engrossed in their crafts.&quot; (Same source again)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Also from Appendix A:III, the largest attested family size is three children: ThrÃ¡in II&#39;s two sons (Thorin II Oakenshield, Frerin) and one daughter (DÃ­s).<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&quot;They are a tough, thrawn race for the most part, secretive, laborious, retentive of the memory of injuries (and of benefits), lovers of stone, of gems, of things that take shape under the hands of craftsman rather than things that live by their own life. But they are not evil by nature, and few ever served the Enemy of free will, whatever the tales of Men may have alleged. For Men of old lusted after their wealth and the work of their hands, and there has been enmity between the races.&quot; (<i>LotR: Appendix F</i>)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&quot;Dwarves of different &#39;breeds&#39; vary in their longevity. Durin&#39;s race were originally long-lived (especially those named Durin), but like most other peoples they had become less so during the Third Age. Their average age (unless they met a violent death) was about 250 years, which they seldom fell far short of, but could occasionally far exceed (up to 300). A Dwarf of 300 was about as rare and aged as a Man of 100.<br><br>&quot;Dwarves remained young - e.g. regarded as too tender for really hard work or for fighting - until they were 30 or nearly that (DÃ¡in II was very young in 2799 (32) and his slaying of Azog was a great feat). After that they hardened and took on the appearance of age (by human standards) very quickly. By forty all Dwarves looked much alike in age, until they reached what they regarded as old age, about 240. They then began to age and wrinkle and go white quickly (baldness being unknown among them), unles they were going to be long-lived, in which case the process was delayed. Almost the only physical disorder they suffered from (they were singularly immune from diseases such as affected Men, and Halflings) was corpulence. If in prosperous circumstances, many grew very fat at or before 200, and could not do much (save eat) afterwards. Otherwise &#39;old age&#39; lasted not much more than ten years, and from say 40 or a little before to near 240 (two hundred years) the capacity for toil (and for fighting) of most Dwarves was equally great.&quot; (<i>HoME XII: The Peoples of Middle-earth - &#39;The Making of Appendix A&#39;</i>)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&quot;<i>It is then said that Dwarves marry late, seldom before they are ninety or more, they they have few children (so many as four being rare), and continues:</i><br><br>&quot;To these they are devoted, often rather fiercely: that is, they may treat them with apparent harshness (especially in the desire to ensure that they shall grow up tough, hardy, unyielding), but they defend them with all their power, and resent injuries to them even more than to themselves. The same is true of the attitude of children to parents. For an injury to the father a Dwarf may spend a life-time in achieving revenge. Since the &#39;kings&#39; or heads of lines are regarded as &#39;parents&#39; of the whole group, it will be understood how it was that the whole of Durin&#39;s Race gathered and marshalled itself to avenge ThrÃ³r.<br><br>&quot;<i>Finally there is a note on the absence of record concerning the women of the Dwarves:</i><br><br>&quot;They are seldom named in genealogies. They join their husbands&#39; families. But if a son is seen to be 110 or so years younger than his father, this usually indicates an elder daughter. Thorin&#39;s sister DÃ­s is named simply because of the gallant death of her sons Fili and Kili in defence of Thorin II. The sentiment of affection for sister&#39;s children was strong among all peoples of the Third Age, but less so among Dwarves than Men or Elves among whom it was strongest.&quot; (Same source.

            <p>&quot;Yet in secret (a secret which unlike the Elves, they did not willingly unlock, even to their friends) they used their own strange tongue, changed little by the years; for it had become a tongue of lore rather than a cradle-speech, and they tended it and guarded it as a treasure of the past. Few of other race have succeeded in learning it. In this history it appears only in such place-names as Gimli revealed to his companions; and in the battle-cry which he uttered in the siege of the Hornburg. That at least was not secret, and had been heard on many a field since the world was young. <i>Baruk KhazÃ¢d! KhazÃ¢d ai-mÃªnu!</i> &#39;Axes of the Dwarves!

            <p>Something I would like to see someone do - I may end up doing it myself - is writing a completely canon-friendly story of a Dwarven woman.

            <p>I imagine TOS characters to be particularly used to Sues, and therefore expert at dealing with them. What makes this particularly amusing, though, is that this is the segment of fic I was complaining about:<br><br><i>Two things were off about my appearance, my eyes were completely purple, everything expect my pupils was a bright purple, and my wildly curly black hair naturally had random streaks of brown, blue, green and bright red.</i><br><br>It&#39;s like you knew that she also had colorful hair.<br><br>You haven&#39;t seen Into Darkness yet?

            <p>So, I just finished <i>The Book Thief</i> by Markus Zusak, and I was wondering if anyone else here has read it?<br>If you haven&#39;t, you should.

            <p>I loved that book!<br><br>The kissing scene-- I have no words. :&#39;)<br><br>Although I must say, reading it taught me a valuable lesson in quality over quantity regarding metaphors. While there were plenty of gems in there- &#39;specially the colors- sometimes it seemed like a desperate grope for poetic devices, such as the cabinets that were the shape of grief. Almost (dare I say it?) urple phrases every now and then.<br><br>Apart from that nitpicky complaint, it was one of the best novels I&#39;ve read. <br><br>I found Death as the narrator beautiful, creative, amusing... and oddly frustrating.

            <p>Wow, I just read this a few months ago! I have no idea where it came from, but a friend of mine was reading it and it sounded intriguing so I stole it during the times she wasn&#39;t actively reading it. I knew that title looked familiar, when I first read it I thought for some crazy reason you were trying to refer to &quot;The Thief Lord&quot; by Cornelia Funke, but when I read the description, I realized what you were really talking about. ^^;<br><br>Such a great book! I little weird at first, but once you get used to it being Death narrating his observations on the character&#39;s lives, it&#39;s a great read, and an interesting view into Nazi Germany during the war.<br><br><br>Guess I&#39;ll do this too, just in case :D<br>---Spoilers!---<br><br>Oh I was sobbing when her dad died!

            <p>Hi, I guess.<br><br>I&#39;m a guy, I&#39;m 15, read and write almost exclusively anime stuff, am obsessed with Lucky Star for some reason, and I&#39;m probably nowhere near as good at writing as any of you guys. And I <em>basically</em> have no idea what I&#39;m doing. ._.<br><br>I think that there&#39;s too much yaoi/yuri out there, even though I&#39;ve written a little of it myself. I&#39;m guilty of not proofreading my fics, but I&#39;m too overconfident in my spelling/grammar ability for that &gt;<br>So I guess there isn&#39;t that much more for me to say about myself. If you have any questions (probably not since I don&#39;t really stand out), I guess, ask.</p>

            <p>You mentioned Lucky star, but do you have any other anime fandoms you can think of? Or books, movies, videogames, other cartoons, or live-action TV? A list of fandoms tends to be appreciated, especially since it can let people know what gifts to give you.<br><br>Oh, also. Wiki link.

            <p>As far as fandoms go... not actually a whole lot, usually when I watch an anime I watch it for a few episodes and then suddenly find something else. Things that I&#39;ve really gotten into would be Lucky Star, Initial D (oh yeah, I&#39;m a car nut as well), and Angel Beats. I&#39;ve been into Mirai Nikki a.k.a. Future Diary at one point, as well as Dog Days. I&#39;ve also finally started watching Sword Art Online, and I&#39;ve been meaning to start watching Baccano again (as Mirai Nikki distracted me from it less than two episodes in).<br><br>Ooh, a spiky-haired wig!

            <p>Well, right now I&#39;m kind of into the Black Death, since I&#39;m doing a research project on it for school. Did you know that, although people will tell you its &quot;proper&quot; name was the bubonic plague, that the Black Death IS its real name? And that the bubonic plague was only a third of the actual pestilence, which was made up of a septicemic, a pneumonic, and a bubonic plague integrated into the same pathogen? I didn&#39;t until recently, not being a very scientific person, but I thought it was a cool trivia nugget.</p>

            <p>Well, sort of. I&#39;m probably not obsessive, per se, but I do know a lot of random details and like to talk about them.<br><br>I should still remember a lot about Ancient Egypt, some bits about Greek and Roman mythology and history, Arthurian legends, a bit of Norse mythology (which I must improve, considering that I&#39;m co-writing the Avengers OFU), some Medieval stuff, Native American tales, and a whole lot of Jewish history, thanks to the efforts of most of the schools I&#39;ve been to.

            <p>I&#39;m the same way. As in- doing research at school and having to relate it all in story form to my best friend, whether she cares or not. I also tend to exhaggerate, so maybe &quot;very much intrigued and enjoying to rave about it&quot; would be more accurate than &quot;obsessed.&quot;<br><br>Well, out of those, Greece and Rome would be common ground. I&#39;ve learned bits and pieces of Jewish history, but not in much detail, and I know next to nothing about Arthurian legends and Native American mythology. They sound fascinating, though.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a genre of anime/games/what-have-you called Widget. Its name comes from WJT, <b>W</b>ierd <b>J</b>apanese <b>T</b>hing. Let&#39;s say that that weirdness had to come from somewhere. It contains such things as Japan being created from blended sea-foam, gods being born from drops of water dropping from another god&#39;s face when he ritually bathed in a river to cleanse himself (the story goes that, after he defeated the Three Ugly Women of Hell his sister Izanami sent after him, and since he&#39;s been to Hell, Izanagi needed to cleanse himself. He bathed in a river. Amaterasu-Omikami, the sun goddess, was created from a drop the fell from his right eye, Tsukuyomi, the moon god, was created from a drop that fell from his left eye, and Susa-no-o, the god of storms, was created from a drop the fell from his nose), gods thinking the best prank ever is to drop skinned foals through the roofs of other gods&#39; rooms, the sun hiding in a cave and only being lured out again via a combination of an erotic dance and a mirror, etc.<br>There are also eighty million gods. Not literally, but there <i>is</i> an astounding number of gods.</p>

            <p>All right, here&#39;s the abridged and unedited version for your reading pleasure. I&#39;m going off memory, so I don&#39;t guarantee perfection.<br><br>Basically, after the Punic Wars, Rome took Spain as a sort of victory prize and made it into a province. Spaniards were not well thought-of at the time. They had no rights, no status, and no respect from the Romans. It was into that situation that Trajan was born in 53 AD.<br>The emperor at the time, Domitian, was generally a poor ruler- arrogant, abusive of power, and an all around jerk. Despite this, he did initiate some reforms regarding provincials that allowed them to enjoy some citizen-only priveleges such as joining the army or participating in the local government. Trajan&#39;s father, a poor farmer, took advantage of the reforms and became a member of the province&#39;s council, but Trajan himself wanted no political power or personal glory, only to have contributed toward the glory of Rome and the wellbeing of his homeland. So he did the logical thing for a teenage guy and joined the army as a low-ranking legionary.<br>He served in the military for most of his life, from when he was about 12 to age 45. Trajan proved himself a talented and intelligent soldier, and after a short while was placed in the rear of the marching formation, with the most skilled fighters. The back were beasts. He slowly worked his way up the battle hierarchy, from a literally expendable footsoldier (the Spanish were exploited and used as decoys all the time in wars.) to a leader. Trajan&#39;s superiors began to take notice of him for his merit, unimpressive roots, and lack of concern for power. Being Romans, they appreciated a guy who wasn&#39;t constantly trying to stab distinguished gentlemen to death to get the throne. Soon Trajan found himself a tribune, which was a level of military command higher than a centurion and lower than a legatus, at the head of a maniple 160 men strong.<br>Following the Universal Laws of Comedy, just as things were working out nicely for Trajan, an esteemed commander in Germany named Saturninus openly revolted against Emperor Domitian, and more importantly, against Rome itself. Saturninus turned on the other legions stationed in Germany in a scandalous bloodbath just to spite the emperor.<br>The soldiers around the rest of the empire, including Trajan, were ordered to steer clear and let Saturninus run himself down. When he heard the number of casualties (I don&#39;t know them, but they must have been high.), Trajan broke ranks with his legion, driving his maniple north to stand up to Saturninus. Although almost comically outnumbered, Trajan and his men emerged victorious. As a reward for his bravery, Domitian promoted Trajan to the rank of commander, a pretty significant leap from tribune. In addition to the loyal soldiers who had fought under him against the rebela, hw was given an entire legion of elite soldiers. The legion soon became infamous, although few knew the name of its soft-spoken leader.<br>Trajan was chummy with his men. Kind, a bit shy, and a brilliant combatant and strategist, he knew each soldier by their nickname.<br>He employed creative strategies in warfare, and is known for having constructed an entire fake harbor at Ostia to fool enemies. But he never suspected that he&#39;d rule not just one legion, but the entire Roman world.<br>When Trajan was in his 30&#39;s, Domitian was spontaneously assassinated. Okay, it wasn&#39;t that spontaneous. Nobody liked him. But he was the last of his dynasty.<br>Moving back a bit, the last time a dynasty ended, it was with Nero&#39;s suicide, which had resulted in one of Rome&#39;s goriest civil wars. Fearing that the same would occur with Domitian&#39;s murder, the Senate hurriedly selected a new leader who no Roman could possibly harbor ill will toward... Nerva, an elderly and childless politician.<br>Nerva was neither a poor nor a particularly eminent emperor. Picture Dumbledoor, add a toga, and you have a good idea of what he was like. Nerva spoke so wisely and cryptically that the Senate declared him mentally unstable. (They didn&#39;t get it, so he must be insane. Roman logic.)<br>Their theory was proven true, at least to their thinking, when Nerva announced who exactly he planned to name his heir. When the emperor first stated that he planned on adopting a son to succeed him, the Senate was delighted. They bombarded him with lists of famous politicians, rich generals, and, of course, themselves. But Nerva waved them away. He would have Trajan, and only Trajan, on the throne after himself.<br>Outraged, the Senators berated him, saying that a shy, little-known commander who was not even a proper citizen of Rome was unfit to lead. This was the last straw for them. Nerva would be metaphorically committed to the old folk&#39;s home in the morning.<br>Still he insisted, claiming that since Trajan did not expect nor desire power, he would not abuse it. That this commander had a greater integrity than any in Rome, greater than Trajan himself knew.<br>When the Senators did not relent, he declared Trajan governor of Germany, so that he would have the political status required of a future emperor, then died shortly thereafter of unspecified causes. *cough Senate cough*<br>A messenger was sent to Trajan, who was engaged in battle with the Parthians near the Danube River at the time, informing him of his adoption, new status, and of Nerva&#39;s demise. Immediately, Trajan&#39;s men sank to their knees and hailed him as emperor, but Trajan smiled sadly and told them to stand in an epic Aragornish fashion. He quietly told the messenger that he did not see himself as a capable politician, and that Rome deserved better than he. He would not go to the capital, and the Senate should choose a more competent diplomat to lead.<br>He then mounted his horse and ordered his legion to move out. Dejected, the messenger returned to Rome and relayed Trajan&#39;s speech to a gleeful audience in the Senate.<br>Several years past, and Trajan had celebrated his 40th year before word at last reached him in the form of a desperate peasant that the Senate had taken over the government, and that corruption and violence an tyranny had seized the empire under their twisted rule. This was the convincing Trajan needed. Setting aside his own misgivings and his hesitance to leave the life he&#39;d led and loved for so long, he appointed a close friend the new head of the legion and rode hard for Rome, through several days and nights.<br>When he arrived, he was choked with terror. He had never seen a city so extensive, nor a throng so large. Yet he somehow mustered the courage to pass through the looming walls into the capital.<br>Unlike the emperors before and after him, Trajan&#39;s entrance into Rome had no parades or grandeur. He did not even flatter himself so much as to ride a horse, just walked, slowly and gracefully, down the crowded street with his head held high.<br>All the citizens of Rome gathered to watch his trek through the metropolis.<br>When Trajan reached the Senate building, he found the Senators waiting for him on the stairs with murder in their eyes. To their surprise, he knelt to the ground before them. His words, though they were never specifically recorded, were soft and respectful, and his disposition modest. Grudgingly, the Senate handed over the laurel crown, if only not to look bad in the eyes of the public.<br>I won&#39;t bore you with the specifics of his reign. Trajan is still known to be the greatest of all Roman emperors, the only one to survive his term with untarnished morals and a clean conscience. Through gentle words and the brilliant strategem only a military man could create, Trajan led the Senate back to the light and made a new empire out of Rome where trust and forgiveness took precedence over wealth and status. He connected the outer provinces to central Rome, expanded the territory to the fullest extent it would ever reach, and rebuilt the Forum, which had burned in the Great Fire during Nero&#39;s rule. Rome shone like a beacon in the Mediterranean.<br>And then things went wrong.<br>Trajan was 64 and terribly ill, and had been for years. No physician could diagnose him, but it was clear that the emperor&#39;s body was failing him, and that his time was running out. With their leader&#39;s guiding light flickering, the people grew wary and unsteady. The Parthians attacked once more, seeking vengeance for Trajan&#39;s earlier victories. Trajan himself rode out to meet them in Mesopotamia, and faught side-by-side with his old comrades even while his sword grew too cumbersome for him to lift any longer. During battle, he was stricken by a heart attack and had to be carried out of the fray on the shield of a fellow warrior. Those who saw this feared that the emperor was dead, and before anyone could deny it, the runor had spread like wildfire across the empire. In response, conquered areas stirred rebelliously. Trajan&#39;s homie, whom he had given command of the legion to, was killed in the New Parthian Wars defending his emperor and friend. Another plummet in health followed the news of the casualty, and Trajan was ordered to stay in bed. Soon he could not have done otherwise even if he had been of a defiant temperament.<br>This was the opportunity that the rising insurgency had been waiting for. A full-scale revolt erupted on the edges of the empire. Provinces burned. The Jews rebelled, first in Cyrene, then Alexandria, and then the entire enpire. Barbarians attacked, and the people of Rome were thrown into chaos without their beloved emperor to lead them.<br>Trajan knew the end was near. He confronted his half-cousin Hadrian, a younger politician, and named him his heir. He told Hadrian to inform the people that Trajan had left on a long journey from which he would likely not return. He said he would rather they Â cursed his name forever for abandoning them in a time of crisis than for them to be more divided by grief.<br>Trajan planned to steal away in the night and die quietly away from the eyes of the Romans. That night, he donned a peasant cloak and left the Senate building where he had been hospitalized. Halfway down the grand staircase, he crumpled to the hard marble of a fatal stroke.<br>A Roman woman filling a water pitcher at the nearby well saw him fall and carried him into her home, where he died shortly thereafter, only surfacing from his unconscious state long enough to say &quot;I am sorry.&quot; No one is sure to what he referred.<br>Trajan had feared that sorrow would divide the people.<br>But on August 8, 117 AD, all of Rome joined in mourning.<br><br>And that&#39;s what saw them through those days.<br><br>Now I need to find out what the heck happened to Hadrian afterward.</p>

            <p>If anyone&#39;s interested, although this is an older thread, Hadrian built some small temples and such, which is all lovely, and constructed his famous Wall, then surrendered most of the territory Rome had won, wandered around the empire trying to look busy, executed quite a few Senators, became an early supporter of the gay marriage movement, went insane, became a crazy evil tyrant, killed everyone, and died at the age of 60.<br>It&#39;s kind of sad.</p>

            <p>After slugging through the entire medieval torture ritual that was &quot;Leaves, Have But Only Two Sides&quot; (Even the title... sigh...), I have gathered a couple charges for whoever sporks it.<br>1.) The name Morwen, which was the name of a historical elven figure- when it is specifically stated that elves do not reuse names, and consider it blasphemous impersonation.<br>2.) Randomly crouching down and hissing at various canon and bit characters like Gollum with rabies for no apparent reason, and forcing poor abused Legolas to find that attractive.</p>

            <p>The reason a Sue takes over the dummy isn&#39;t due to its appearance being undescribed, and in fact, the first-person Sues can be more likely than the third-person Sues to stop all the action to talk about the way they dress.<br>It&#39;s the first/second person shift that causes the Sue to attempt to take over an observer, and the Crash Dummy is there to be the most susceptible observer in the room.<br><br>I remember one mission where a possessed Agent started slowly taking on the Sue&#39;s characteristics as she was described. That didn&#39;t expel her from his body, and in fact ended up making the situation worse. The first-person Sues want to drive something around.</p>

            <p>These have to be the most unbelievably cliched &#39;Sues I have ever heard of.  One&#39;s an evil Elf who falls for Legolas, the other is a typical Arwen&#39;s Sister!Sue.  Why this same pattern?  It&#39;s so ridiculous that it ends up being funny.   </p>

            <p>Because for most other fandoms, it&#39;s a character who&#39;s hot but also has many compelling personality traits. A character with problems they can fix, like a woobie or an aloof or dangerous character. I mean, think about it.<br><br>Most popular Lust Objects<br><br><i>Harry Potter</i>: Draco Malfoy, the bully who is somewhat pitiable. Also rather hot to some people.<br><br><i>Star Trek: TOS</i>: Spock, emotionally closed off, somewhat aloof and condescending at times. Attractive.<br><br><i>Star Trek: TNG</i>: Data, who combines woobie with emotionally detached. Not even that attractive, though &quot;fully functional&quot;. His personality is interesting enough.<br><br><i>Percy Jackson</i>: Nico di Angelo, son of Hades, something of an outcast and loner. Probably hot.<br><br>I feel like the Nostalgia Chick puts it better in her video about hot animated men: <a href="http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/team-nchick/nostalgia-chick/34233-top-ten-qhottestq-animated-guys"><a href="http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/team-nchick/nostalgia-chick/34233-top-ten-qhottestq-animated-guys">http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/team-nchick/nostalgia-chick/34233-top-ten-qhottestq-animated-guys</a></a><br><br>So yeah, Legolas actually seems like an anomaly to me.</p>

            <p>Because people like to feel needed.<br><br>Twoo Wuv shall change him, yes--and that will prove that he needs me, and loves me, and will never leave me. Deep, dark, and brooding? I&#39;m the only one who can bring him out of it, who can help him be more and feel better, which, again, means that he needs me, and loves me, and will never leave me because of all that. Yes, Batman&#39;s been through a lot of girls--but if you can manage to be The One...then that&#39;s it, you&#39;re set for life. You&#39;ll always be needed; more than that, you&#39;ll always be <i>wanted</i>. And for people who don&#39;t mind bending canon a little (or a lot), that&#39;s worth putting up with some brooding, or even changing the character so that he can come out of it a bit. Or a lot. I don&#39;t know how many people who write this stuff would be willing to put up with it in real life, though.<br><br>Part of the reason people write Mary-Sues is because they want to be admired and wanted and needed. It just...doesn&#39;t always translate well, for many reasons: messing with canon and thereby throwing people out of the story, not having a main character that other people can relate to (add to that &#39;overdoing it and making the character ridiculously powerful and unreasonable and flawless&#39;), showcasing the worst parts of modern society (women and men in the media, racism, sexism, etc)...I could go on. But a lot of Suethors are teenagers; they&#39;re going through a point in their lives where their bodies are changing, their minds are expanding, and they&#39;re often becoming very concerned with what their peers and society think of them. And most people want to be accepted, or admired, or loved, or wanted, or needed, or all of that, and sometimes the only way to be sure of getting that is to write yourself into your stories. I don&#39;t know to what extent I&#39;ve done that myself; my full-blown Sue knew everyone, defeated villains, and gave moderate-to-evil bad guys snarky talking-tos. I&#39;m no psychologist, but I think part of that was wanting to make the canon characters&#39; lives turn out better, part was wanting to tell a dramatic story, and part was that whole pesky wanting-to-be-admired bit sneaking in subconsciously. (She didn&#39;t date anyone, if you&#39;re curious).<br><br>The reason the PPC works is that we&#39;re here to point out flaws in writing. We&#39;re here to point out how to write better, we&#39;re here to analyse bad writing and explain how it could be good. We&#39;re not here to stomp on people&#39;s daydreams, just...bring them down to earth a little, and teach how to couch them in such a way that they&#39;re relateable, enjoyable to read, and (preferably) teach/perpetuate worthwhile values. We&#39;re here, in a way, to coach the next generation of writers...if they&#39;re prepared to listen to our critiques. And it works because we&#39;re writers ourselves, and we&#39;ve been through bad writing and Mary Sues and a lot of what goes into writing them--and because we understand why we could be better and how we could improve, and <i>we did it</i>. Some of us (a lot of us?) have even gone into Real World jobs that require writing skills or critiquing skills, and I&#39;d like to think we&#39;re doing well.<br><br>But now it&#39;s time for me to stop writing down my deeper thoughts and go to lunch :)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>I may do something with the second one; I can&#39;t make it through more than a few chapters of the first one, but the second...come on, you don&#39;t put angels in M-e. The closest thing to angels there are Maiar, who most certainly do not have &#39;angel wings&#39;, and what the-- &#39;i got to go i am about to be ambushed by Orcs&#39;? The heck? That&#39;s just sloppy. I mean, if she knows she&#39;s about to be ambushed, why&#39;s she writing about her backstory instead of preparing? And if she just plain has to go, she shouldn&#39;t know about the ambush--oh, I give up. Also, you have no idea how much I want a Supernatural-verse angel agent to send on this mission...especially as the whole &#39;angel-wings tattoo&#39; is practically a trope in SPN fanfic, and it can be done really well.<br><br>This whole angel thing really bothers me, can you tell?<br><br>...I can&#39;t tell if she&#39;s calling Elrond &#39;father&#39; in Hebrew, or thinks that he&#39;s the band ABBA. Either way, it&#39;s wrong, especially as she then calls him &#39;Ada&#39; in the next sentence.<br><br>ARGH, SCRIPTFIC!<br><br>And what&#39;s up with this whole &#39;prayed to the gods and to our ancestors&#39; and &#39;thank Gandolf and our ancestors&#39;? I know several World One cultures (and several other continua, too) that use the ancestors thing, but Middle-earth Elves don&#39;t use it and never would. They have the Valar...who I don&#39;t think they actually spend much time praying to. In fact, I&#39;m not sure there even *is* a prayer system in M-e.

            <p>I just...they&#39;re going to break my heart, I just know it. On the other hand, I&#39;m getting spoilers all over the place now, and I didn&#39;t actually want spoilers (you&#39;d think otherwise, since I went on Tumblr, but...)<br><br>At least I have a vague idea of what you&#39;re talking about.<br><br>The funny thing is, I actually have a potential candidate. I don&#39;t know if you remember the Suemione mission (&#39;Girl Out of Time&#39;) that Lily Winterwood did not so long ago, but there&#39;s this outtake I&#39;m writing (okay, supposed to be writing; it hasn&#39;t actually made it past the original notes and pieces of dialogue yet) that deals with the idiotic de-Horcruxing ritual that gets used in a later chapter. (It mentions Archangels. And gets Uriel&#39;s name wrong. And names Harry Potter as Raphael&#39;s vessel, which is ridiculous and will result in a lot of teasing from Gabriel, because hello, Trickster!) But my point is that, due to the insertion of Ariel rather than Uriel, I...well, I&#39;m bringing in the Little Mermaid, actually, but I was also thinking that Ariel the angel could show up too. Except most likely at a later point.<br><br>Although, lost SPN angel wandering the halls of HQ--er, another one who isn&#39;t Castiel, that is--well, it&#39;s pretty plausible, what with the shields being down. Also he/she&#39;d probably just get portalled back to canon if it was during the Blackout, right? Hm...<br><br>But anyway, the point is: Ariel, the sometimes lion-headed personification of Jerusalem, could easily have an SPN version that appeared in HQ. I would almost rather find one in a badfic, though; while I love Jerusalem, it&#39;s...well, it&#39;s a bit awkward (for me, anyway) to take an angel and make an SPN version of them who then becomes an agent. That is, I think I&#39;d like to recruit one from a badfic (although actually, this technically would be that.) On the other hand, if you know of a badfic with a, and I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this, bit character angel, well...send it over.<br><br>(In other words, I&#39;m not completely sure about recruiting Ariel, or if it would even work out so well. Although, I&#39;m really picturing this very serious-looking guy going around introducing himself and having people say, &#39;what, like the little mermaid?&#39; and him just giving them this look, because he&#39;s been pronouncing it as a Hebrew name but they&#39;ve just seen it on paper, or something, and they think they&#39;re going to be working with a mermaid. Could be hilarious. I guess we&#39;ll see how it works out...but if it does, or if I find a bit character to recruit, then I will send an angel agent after this fic. And will take s8 events into account, once I have a better understanding of what they are.)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Does that increase the chance of heartbreak?<br><br>It probably would, really--OH.

            <p>...so he&#39;d probably end up singing &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; or &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;. Although &quot;Waterloo&quot; actually sounds familiar; I should look it up.<br><br>Well...there&#39;s a distinction between what they can do on the show and what they commonly do in fanfic. On the show, they can Fall in several ways. One is just losing their Grace piece by piece until they&#39;re completely human, but have all their memories. The other is to rip out their Grace and fall to Earth along with it. The angel gets reborn as a human, while the Grace lands somewhere nearby and grows into a tree. The angel may later regain their memories with some help, and then go find the tree and touch it, which gives them back their Grace (and leaves the tree where it is, if you&#39;re wondering.)<br><br>However, in fanfic, there&#39;s a common plot where someone, generally Castiel, has fallen, or is disguised, or is in a human AU, and has angel wings (generally black) tattooed on his (or her, sometimes) back. Occasionally, someone else has them. This is generally just symbolic; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen the tattoos become the wings (except maybe once where he got his Grace back and the tattoos disappeared? I&#39;m not sure). But of course, this is just a fanfic trope. It happens to be used in a large enough number of goodfics that I like it and will protect it, even though it&#39;s not canon (although it&#39;s not too much of a stretch, I don&#39;t think). In canon, though, fallen angels don&#39;t have any tells, except for being able to hear the other angels talking if they&#39;re active on Earth at the time, and, if that&#39;s the case, remembering bits of information without knowing how they know. I&#39;m not sure how much of a tell that is, though, unless you were to comb through mental hospitals.<br><br>And yeah, fans tend to be good sources :) Either that, or they&#39;ll know which wiki articles to direct you to.<br><br>Well, yes, some did--such as the Balrogs--but there&#39;s no such word as &#39;angel&#39; in any language of Middle-earth. It just doesn&#39;t exist. The Maiar may be an angel equivalent of sorts, but they themselves are not angels, and should not be referred to as such.<br><br>Pff, Gandolf. Wow. And actually, Elrond has that line, and it&#39;s Elrond and Celebrian who pray to &#39;the gods and [their] ancestors&#39;, so...Gandolf&#39;s got Elves praying to him! Wowwww.<br><br>She keeps on calling him Abba and Ada. And there were some more things that I&#39;ve now forgotten, thankfully for my brain and sanity...<br><br>I wonder who I should send after this.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>So, does an angel in Supernatural becoming human when they fall relate to how the demons in Supernatural are once-human?<br>Furthermore, can a former angel, once he becomes human from the first method you mentioned, become a demon with all of the angel&#39;s memories?<br><br>Also, would an angel spawned through the second method, which apparently gives them some sort of angel-sensing power, be able to pass that power on to their offspring, or is it a characteristic of their soul or aura or some such and not actually their human body? Can they sense the other angels when they&#39;re babies or otherwise unable to know what an angel is, or is it conditional upon ability to recognize an angel?<br>Can they even detect the other angels if the reincarnated once-angel is part of a religion that doesn&#39;t believe in angels?<br><br>Does the tree carry the Grace, as in, it&#39;s inside the tree and is removed when the angel touches it, or is the tree itself a manifestation of the Grace?<br>What kind of tree is it? Old, young, tall, short, ash, birch, sequoia? Does it matter?<br>If two Grace trees pollinate each other, could an angel restore its status by touching the offspring of the two trees, or can an angel only be restored by a tree that was created at the same time that that angel turned human?<br>What if something happens to &quot;their&quot; tree, like it&#39;s cut down and used for firewood or made into paper? Would they need to rub the ashes/paper product on themselves to become angels again, or is the Grace connected to the tree lost permanently?<br><br>What causes angels to lose their Grace? Is it passive, caused gradually by doing things like spending too much time on Earth, or can Grace only be removed deliberately by another angel due to crimes or offense against the angelic hosts? I&#39;m assuming that a group of Supernatural angels is called a host, since I&#39;ve seen groups of angels called hosts before, but I&#39;m not certain in this case.<br><br><br>I know. I did say it was stupid to call Maia angels, so we&#39;re in agreement there.<br><br>Wow, Gandolf&#39;s got some Elves praying to him, he was in that syndicated comic strip doctorlit showed the Board a while back, and I don&#39;t even know what else. He is so important right now. I imagine the other Gandalf-based minis are so jealous.<br><br>Didn&#39;t you say Kozar was DMS? Send him! If he has experience with Scandinavian pop music, that&#39;s a bonus! If not, then his partner should probably have found about it beforehand, or they won&#39;t be able to understand why Elrond starts singing about dancing queens or being defeated by love. Of course, it would be hard to understand why an Elf would start singing World One music in the first place, but as long as there&#39;s enough understanding to let Kozar go &quot;What, what... what?&quot;, it&#39;s a success.</p>

            <p>Long reply! I love those. Let&#39;s see if I can manage to answer all your questions...<br><br>Er...not entirely. Actually, not at all, I shouldn&#39;t think, beyond the concept of humanity being the middle-ground. Demons in Supernatural were humans who sold their souls. Those souls were then taken to Hell and tortured until they became demons. A fallen angel loses their Grace, and, presumably, gains a soul (not sure if that works for an angel who doesn&#39;t rip out their Grace--actually, I don&#39;t think it does--but I&#39;m assuming that one that gets reborn as a human would, in fact, have a soul. It isn&#39;t mentioned, though), thereby becoming human. If there&#39;s any relation beyond humanity sort of being the step in between, I don&#39;t see it.<br><br>A former angel...wow. That&#39;s very interesting, and (I&#39;m going to say this several times, probably) it&#39;s a question I&#39;ve never considered. I would say yes, if the angel were to sell their newly gained soul (presumably) to a demon; however, I&#39;m not sure an angel would be stupid enough, seeing as they know pretty well what goes on in Hell, and that demons are real, and that they&#39;d become demons themselves if they were to make a deal. So technically, yes, a fallen angel could sell their soul (assuming they get one) and become a demon. The angel&#39;s memories would probably end up rather faded, though. However, again, I&#39;m not sure one would be stupid enough. Then again, humans do tend to do crazy things when they&#39;re desperate, so...who knows?<br><br>...and, apparently, Pretzel&#39;s already answered all of this :) That&#39;ll teach me to look for replies before replying myself...<br><br><br>Maiar do not equal angels. I will say that as often as I can for cathartic reasons, because seriously? Tolkien deliberately kept Christianity more or less out of Middle-earth. Therefore, putting angels in...it&#39;s just ridiculous. You could make a case for adding them into C S Lewis&#39; work (although you&#39;d have to make them into an allegory of sorts) but not Tolkien&#39;s. It just doesn&#39;t work.<br><br>Gandolf is probably lording it over them, and they&#39;re plotting to overthrow him. *shakes head* Minis, what can you do.<br><br>Kozar, unfortunately, ended up in the DIC. However, he was previously in the DMS...this could be a retroactive mission of sorts, from when he was still paired with Agent Dawn? That way we can have Dawn starting to dance and sing along, while Kozar goes &#39;Klingon music makes much more sense than this rubbish&#39; and charges for it. That could work...although, it would be nice if this fic was posted before March 2 of this year, because that&#39;s when Kozar was transferred.<br><br>*checks* Yesss, it was published in January! Awesome. So maybe Kozar and Dawn (and maybe trainee!Ariel as well) will take it on...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Answers to your questions, as far as I know, in order:<br><br>1.0) I don&#39;t think it really relates that way; angels in Supernatural were never human to begin with, so it&#39;s more like they&#39;re reverting to the form that they take-- their human vessels --when they manifest on Earth. Demons were once humans who had their souls marred and broken in some way, either through some sort of demonic crossroads deal or other acts of extreme violence. <br><br>1.5) We don&#39;t know; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s ever happened before.<br><br>2.0) Again, we don&#39;t know. The only angel we saw that ripped out her Grace and was reborn as a human was Anna (Anael), and she, as far as we know, never had kids. Then again, being stuck in an asylum probably didn&#39;t help that matter. <br><br>2.1) Unknown on the babies thing; Anna only started hearing &#39;angel radio&#39; (Aka, the grand celestial chatter of bored angels everywhere) when another angel, Castiel, rescued Dean Winchester from Hell and proclaimed that he was saved, opening her psychic ears to what was going on.<br><br>2.2) Supernatural and religion. Right. That&#39;s... ridiculously complicated, actually. I mean, yeah, they play off the Judeo-Christian mythologies quite a bit inside the show, but it&#39;s more like cherry picked bits and pieces here and there rather than following a straight up recognizable dogma. There&#39;s also the fact that they throw in bits and pieces of other religions and mythologies-- reference &#39;Hammer of the Gods&#39;, episode 5.19, if you want more of an idea --all the time, so that&#39;s not much help.<br><br>3.0) It&#39;s a little of both. The tree is a physical marker of the Grace, but it doesn&#39;t disappear once the Grace is retrieved by someone. <br><br>3.1) Anna&#39;s Grace was a very large tree, but we&#39;ve never seen anyone else&#39;s, so it&#39;s just a lone sample in canon. In fic, though, I&#39;ve read a story where an archangel&#39;s Grace (that story&#39;s canon followed the seven archangel theory rather than the show&#39;s canon four) was actually the cause of the Great Barrier Reef. Grace = life force, so it makes sense that someone more powerful than a &#39;normal&#39; angel would have a greater impact on nature.<br><br>3.2) Unknown.<br><br>3.3) Again, unknown, though I suspect the Grace itself would probably act as some sort of protective countermeasure; maybe its very presence would somehow influence people to leave said tree/organism alone?<br><br>4.0) Let&#39;s see... In canon, angels have lost their Grace due to the following:<br><br>a) Dying [which can be done only via another angel&#39;s sword or explosive means]<br><br>b) Angels abandoning Heaven due to the Judeo-Christian Apocalypse in an alternate timeline, leaving 2014!Castiel to slowly lose his powers<br><br>c) Forceful removal <br><br>d) A ritual closing off Heaven from angels (see the Season 8 season finale for more details)<br><br>4.1) Actually, we don&#39;t know much about the angelic hierarchy in the SPN &#39;verse, save for bits and pieces here and there. Obviously, the four archangels are the powerhouses of the whole thing (though that doesn&#39;t mean that they do a good job at it [those who are active in Heaven for any length of time, anyways]). We also know that most of the angels are arranged into garrisons, or groups of warriors. I say most, since I don&#39;t know about the cupids, or if the reapers can be classified as angels or just celestial beings. The garrisons are headed up by captains; Castiel was the captain of the garrison that broke into Hell and got Dean back.<br><br>Hope that helps!</p>

            <p>You mentioned human vessels for an angel to take. Is this like the Gnostic &quot;divine being channeled into a human body&quot; thing, or do angels manifest their bodies on Earth in a humanoid form most of the time?<br><br>You&#39;d said that the Grace-tree would be around until and after the Grace is removed by &quot;someone&quot;. Does this mean that any angel can use another angel&#39;s Grace-tree? If the latter, would it be possible for a human to become a pseudo-angel by absorbing a Grace, or is that not how a Grace works?<br><br>You&#39;d said that events in alternate timelines led to Castiel losing his powers. Does this mean that every universe that the angels exist in connects with each other, and whenever a Heaven somewhere is destroyed or abandoned, it reflects badly on all angels everywhere, or was that a doomed timeline or a &quot;something bad happened in the past/future and only the protagonists can fix it&quot; scenario, and it was just the same Heaven as before, but affected by What Went Wrong? Or neither?</p>

            <p>Does a human soul that gets turned into a Supernatural-verse demon retain the memories and habits of its former life? If so, does it retain it all (within reason, since they&#39;d been demonized and that would probably cause a shift in personality and related points in the once-human&#39;s psyche), or only certain parts?

            <p>1.) Okay, so. In the SPN &#39;Verse, each angel can take a vessel. This is usually the body of a willing human who, due to various bloodlines, is able to host said angel. The main protagonists of the show, Dean and Sam Winchester, are the True Vessels of Michael and Lucifer, respectively. Castiel&#39;s vessel&#39;s name is Jimmy Novak; on one episode, Castiel temporarily used Jimmy&#39;s young daughter, Claire, as a vessel. Now, the key thing about angels is that they have to receive permission to use someone as a vessel. Demons, on the other hand, can possess anyone they like regardless of permission.<br><br>2.) As far as I know, no, another angel cannot use someone else&#39;s Grace construct. Each Grace is unique to an angel. That doesn&#39;t mean that the Grace can&#39;t be harnessed by someone else to use in, say, a spell, but it /does/ mean that someone can&#39;t just become an angel willy-nilly. Think of it as being biometrically locked to one specific angel.<br><br>3.) That timeline is... complicated. Referred to as the &#39;End-Verse&#39;, it&#39;s a possible Alternate Universe (according to Word of God from the producers) that showed what might happen should Sam say yes to being Lucifer&#39;s vessel. The <a href="http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/index.php?title=5.04_The_End"> can explain it better than I can, to be honest.</a></p>

            <p>Was there a breeding program of some sort put into place by the angels to birth humans suitable to be their vessels, or is the ability to host angels just an hereditary quirk that shows up every once in a while, and an angel just takes advantage of it?<br><br>When an angel-turned-human reclaims its Grace, what happens to the human body?

            <p>1.) There are certain bloodlines that are... Well, I suppose you could say artificially encouraged to converge in order to create a vessel. That&#39;s what happened with Sam and Dean: their parents each came from a bloodline that carried the potentiality to produce the archangels&#39; true vessels, and, in a rare moment of actually working with one another rather than against, Heaven and Hell both did a bit of machination to ensure that John and Mary met, married, and had suitable kids. Otherwise, I think it&#39;s just best fit, to be honest.<br><br>2) Good question. For Anna, her human body <i>was</i> destroyed when she regained her Grace, but later a copy was made to act as her vessel.<br><br>3.)Correct. In the canon timeline, the angels weren&#39;t affected by what happened in the &#39;End verse. It was an alternate reality: what <i>might</i> happen should certain events occur.</p>

            <p>...if you haven&#39;t seen Tumblr, you should: there&#39;s a conspiracy theory of sorts floating around that the show&#39;s still heading towards the Endverse (because of Lucifer&#39;s line of &#39;whatever choices you make, whatever paths you take, we will always end up here&#39;, or something like that.) So basically, Sam gets a haircut? Oh no! We&#39;re heading towards the Endverse. Er...I can&#39;t remember the rest, actually. But it&#39;s quite the theory.<br><br>Also, a clarification in terms of angels who get reborn as humans: I believe in that case a vessel is sort of created for them, in a way; they don&#39;t actually seek out a fetus/about-to-be-born child and get permission. I&#39;m not sure it can even really be called a vessel, beyond it being a sort of human form of the angel without their Grace (and, generally, without their memories, too).<br><br>Also, a question for you, Pretzel: do you think fallen angels get souls? I mean, they&#39;ve become human, so...it might make sense. However, if they do, what happens to the soul when they regain their Grace?<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>After all, souls are energy-- or at least, given that Cas once tapped into Bobby&#39;s soul to help rejuvenate himself a little, as far as I can tell --so I think that the Grace would eventually dwindle down into an approximation of a soul, assuming you&#39;re talking about angels who&#39;re cut off from Heaven rather than ripping out their Grace. For example, we know Cas slowly but steadily lost a good chunk of his powers over the course of the time he was cut off from Heaven, both in the &#39;correct&#39; timeline and in the Endverse. However, even in the Endverse, he seemed to retain a few of his heavenly gifts-- being able to know instantly that past!Dean wasn&#39;t 2014!Dean, and so on --so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an equivalent exchange.<br><br>As for regaining Grace as a fallen angel who&#39;s ripped it out, we do know that Anna&#39;s human body was basically destroyed because of Grace-overload. I think it&#39;s rather like overloading a circuit: put too much power in and it blows. Perhaps that much Grace obliterated the soul, and then rushed in to fill the void. Alternatively, since Anna was able to hear &#39;angel radio&#39;, maybe a small amount of Grace remained within her, acting as a sort of pseudo-soul until she got her powers back.</p>

            <p>So I go home from watching the Great Gatsby (I don&#39;t know about you, but I liked it well; the modern music was a subtle prod at turning the entire film into a modern cautionary tale imo), and being Morbidly Curious, I looked up Gatsby on the Circle and I found at least two Sues.<br><br><a href="http://www.quotev.com/story/3137925/Heart-of-gold/1/">Heart of gold</a> <br>In which the Sue is a blatant slut shamer who shamelessly bashes and upstages Daisy. I mean, Daisy isn&#39;t exactly the greatest character ever but THIS SUE MAKES GATSBY FORGET DAISY INSTANTANEOUSLY. I DON&#39;T - WHAT IS THIS I DON&#39;T EVEN -<br>(Can we run her over with Gatsby&#39;s car? Please?)<br><br><a href="http://www.quotev.com/story/3217202/Million-Dollar-Man-A-Jay-Gatsby-Love-Story/">Million Dollar Man A Jay Gatsby Love Story</a><br>Okay, really, this one isn&#39;t as awful as the other but based on the title and the summary we&#39;ve got Gatsby forgetting Daisy... again. And we&#39;ve got, according to the end notes, the Sue messing around with Nick as well as Gatsby. And then we&#39;ve got more Daisy bashing.<br><br>Also, I note that the first fic can&#39;t spell Nick Carraway right. What the hell would a mini for Gatsby look like? Mini-Eckleburg eyes? <br><br><br></p>

            <p>Also, modern music? ...I hope it works well. The period music was my favorite part of the old movie, besides the dancing.<br><br>I don&#39;t like the first Sue. At all.<br><br>Also, for both of them:<br><br>THE FIRST RULE OF GREAT GATSBY FANFICTION IS ONE THAT SHALL NOT BE BROKEN SAVE ONLY IF IT BE FOR PARODY, AND IT IS THIS: THOU SHALT NOT CAUSE JAY GATSBY TO FORGET, IGNORE, OR OTHERWISE LEAVE DAISY BUCHANAN, ESPECIALLY NOT INSTANTANEOUSLY; AND, SHOULD YOU BE DETERMINED TO BREAK THIS RULE, FOR HEAVEN&#39;S SAKE GIVE IT A SLOW BUILD AND LOGIC AND DEAL PROPERLY AND IN GOOD TASTE WITH THE FACT THAT GATSBY IS IN LOVE WITH THE IDEA OF DAISY AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN. AND, FOR THE LOVE OF CANON, DO NOT MESS UP HISTORICAL DETAILS AND, I&#39;LL SAY IT AGAIN, DEAL PROPERLY WITH THE BREAKING OF GATSBY AND DAISY&#39;S ROMANCE. OR, BETTER YET, <b>JUST DON&#39;T DO IT</b>. THE ENTIRE PLOT HINGES ON HIM BEING IN LOVE WITH HER AND REFUSING TO GIVE HER UP.<br><br>Seriously. I&#39;ve read the book twice, both times for school, and saw the old movie, and while I didn&#39;t particularly love the book, breaking up Gatsby and Daisy without logic and plausibility and logic is just stomping on everything that F. Scott Fitzgerald was trying to show through that book (or at least a major part of it).<br><br>...why am I being protective of characters from a book I didn&#39;t actually enjoy reading all that much?<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>He made pop songs a part of a turn of the century drama/comedy piece set in a French brothel, and it worked.<br><br>I know some people thought it was jarring/hated it, but I personally thought it really underlined how much Gatsby&#39;s parties looked like Vegas nightclubs in the film, and it just lent more of a cautionary tale sorta feeling to the film.</p>

            <p>Of a Lost Odyssey fic that&#39;s 20,000 words and one chapter.<br><br>Or so you would think, until you read the story and discover that, aside from an Evil God!Stu, the whole cast dying in the first part of the story, one of I assume a few Mary Sue OCs and a pretty stupid plot, the whole story is written in a single page.<br><br>You know how ff.net has a separate page for each chapter that you can select from a drop-down menu, right?<br><br>The guy posted the whole story in a single document.

            <p>I can pull 2K in an hour if I can explain my story easily beforehand.

            <p>However, beware: it&#39;s one thing to expect your readers to pay attention and keep up, and another thing entirely to expect them to read your mind. Striking that balance of giving just enough information is tricky. There&#39;s always going to be someone who sees right through you and someone who just doesn&#39;t get it, so you sort of have to guess where the majority of your audience falls and write to them, all the while trying not to come off holier-than-thou on the one hand or condescending on the other.<br><br>I bring this up because I also expect people to keep up, and finding that balance has been a struggle for me, so I know what I&#39;m talking about. {= P My rule of thumb these days is that if I want people to know something, I have to tell them.

            <p>Not another Data luster. Not <i>another</i> one.<br><br>You see, when I first discovered I was a Data luster, I thought I was completely alone, that it was probably some incredibly strange fetish or something. Y&#39;know, he&#39;s an android. Not all that physically attractive or anything. Not a magnet for fangirls.<br><br>I went online, and found that that was completely <i>not</i> the case. And for a while, I was happy.<br><br>Until I saw <a href="http://ryolovesme.deviantart.com/art/Cave-In-Love-Ch-1-199650731">this</a>. It was the first Suefic I&#39;d ever read.<br><br>And I vowed death upon Mary Sues, and hatred for Data lusting Sues, because they make no effing sense. His attractive qualities are in his personality, so if you make him OOC or character replace him, you completely ignore his ENTIRE appeal. At least with OOC!Legolas he&#39;s still pretty. Data lusters, I just don&#39;t understand.<br><br>Although, in a way, I have to thank the Data/OC fics. I wouldn&#39;t have found the PPC if I hadn&#39;t developed my hatred of Sues that way, and I probably wouldn&#39;t have written as much fanfiction if I didn&#39;t see a dire need for non-Sue Data fanfiction. There was a point when you could filter through Data on FFN and you&#39;d either get Suefics or my fics. (Not anymore, it&#39;s all Data/Yar. As if that&#39;s any better.)<br><br>Long story short: I have seen this before, and it still depresses me.</p>

Kirk was born in 2233, and the Battle of Vulcan--which is when this fic starts, more or less--was in 2258.<br><br>2258-2233=25<br>Therefore, Jim Kirk is twenty-five years old in this fic.<br>Furthermore:<br>25-6=19<br>Therefore, Jim was nineteen years old when he adopted Jenifer.<br><br>Please explain to me why Jim Kirk would adopt a ten-year-old kid when he was nineteen. Then, please tell me who let him do it (specifically, which court of law). Genius-level repeat offender, remember? He&#39;s not responsible! No version of Jim Kirk at nineteen is particularly responsible! No, not even the TOS version! He&#39;s not responsible, and you can&#39;t have him adopt a ten-year-old kid at nineteen, because he would be proven unfit for guardianship pretty quickly, he still lives with his mom (presumably, and more or less, since she&#39;s probably off-planet), and I don&#39;t see why he&#39;d suddenly want to take responsibility for a ten-year-old (not that we&#39;re given a reason...)! This is <i>insane</i>.<br><br>(Why yes, I was able to do those calculations from memory. The only thing I didn&#39;t remember was the dates, but when I looked them up, it turned out I had him at the right age. Isn&#39;t memory wonderful?)<br><br>Also, Spock is ridiculously OOC after only a few lines (I may have yelled &#39;character rupture&#39; and face-Kindled when I read it. It&#39;s probably more along the lines of possession, though...probably). And Uhura would NOT say that the adoption, and I quote, &quot;makes total sense&quot;. Not EVER.<br><br>And, one thing more (which is actually kind of hilarious, if you can get past the utter stupidity):<br><br>HE&#39;S. NOT. A. CAPTAIN. YET. HE. IS. A. <b>CADET</b>!<br><br>Jim Kirk, that is. As in, someone calls him &#39;Captain Kirk&#39; in the scene where he&#39;s trying to warn Pike about the Romulan ambush. It&#39;s hilarious, it&#39;s painful, it&#39;s...well, it&#39;s wrong. And that&#39;s where I&#39;ll stop, before I start ranting.<br><br>Seriously, fic? Seriously? You expect me to believe that a nineteen-year-old Jim Kirk not only wanted to adopt a ten-year-old but was <i>allowed</i> to? You expect me to believe that Spock is suddenly showing all sorts of emotion and is overly fond of the Sue? You expect me to believe that Jenifer would quote Jim&#39;s lines to Uhura exactly, and that she wouldn&#39;t find this weird and start backing away? You expect me to believe that they let a sixteen-year-old who, by her own admission, is the complete opposite of her &#39;dad&#39;, which implies that she&#39;s nowhere near genius level?? And not only that, but she abandons her post? And goes to something called Junior Starfleet? <i>Seriously</i>?<br><br>As I seem to remember being said on Deleterius, FIRST!<br><br>~DF<br><br>(Wow, I really shouldn&#39;t let Agent Dawn at bad Star Trek fanfics. On the other hand, I probably really should. She&#39;ll go insane, but it&#39;ll probably be worth it, and, well, she&#39;s insane anyway, and bleeproducts will fix up the excess insanity. I hope.)</p>

            <p>Especially if you made some. I sorta got the impression that you like making minor characters in various departments. Of course, if you don&#39;t want to be solely responsible for the care and feeding of them, you can always make them free to use. {= )<br><br>I&#39;ll just go on record as being uncomfortable with agents getting it on with canon characters whatever the circumstances, but especially considering the dubiously consensual nature of pon farr.

I have to think that&#39;s at least partly why Vulcans try to arrange these things ahead of time, so everyone can properly agree to it. Yes, technically it would be saving his life, but it would be hard to justify that when the readers know the nature of the PPC allows for other options.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if the Harkness clone letting Spock beat him to death is much less unpleasant, even if he will come back afterwards. &gt;.<br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Studio Ghibli? Other people say I&#39;m childish for liking it, but I -like- being childish - when it doesn&#39;t hurt others. It reminds me of childhood, and some of its movies are like waking dreams to watch. :)<br><br>My favorites are Spirited Away and Howl&#39;s Moving Castle, and maybe Ponyo.</p>

            <p>So, first of all, thanks to Nesh and doctorlit for protecting the Mary Sue page and to VM for blocking the troll. <br><br>Secondly, it was recommended that a bit of discussion I started on the talk page for the FAQ: For Other People be moved to the Board. <br><br>So, there&#39;s a section on the FAQ that discusses the &quot;It&#39;s not my fault I write badly: I have a learning disability!&quot; excuse. While this is definitely something the FAQ should cover, I feel it was done poorly. It starts with a a section marked &quot;[This rant is courtesy of Tviokh.]&quot;, which...well, here&#39;s a quote from it: &quot;I really don&#39;t care if you have ADHD, your parents were killed in a fiery wreck, your dog bit off your right arm and a cat pissed in the still bleeding wound. Your. Story. Needs. Work.&quot; <br><br>...<br><br>I&#39;ll just let that speak for itself. Luckily, there&#39;s another &quot;rant&quot; courtesy of an Anonymous Fanfiction Writer, which makes good points like &quot;having a disability doesn&#39;t stop you from writing a good story. It means you have to put in more effort to overcome your weaknesses.&quot; To me, it&#39;s a simple matter of removing the...mean rant, and keeping the less rant-like rant.  <br><br>Another idea I had was some testimony from PPCers with learning disabilities, or, if no one felt comfortable, stories of famous authors who overcame learning disabilities.<br><br>Thoughts?</p>

            <p>that the Tviokh rant it does not put the PPC in a very good light. So, I suggest that the Tviokh rant be deleted (or at least pared down), as it seems that the only point of contention is whether to add a testimonial, and if so, whose.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m in favor of removing the Tviokh rant, though I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;m fond of it in a nostalgia-goggles sort of way. It definitely comes on too strong, but I never understood it to literally mean that we don&#39;t care if something horrible happened to a fanwriter. Rather, maybe you shouldn&#39;t expect to do your best work under those conditions, and neither should you expect us to think it is if you post it anyway.<br><br>... Actually, that&#39;s covered in a previous bit of the FAQ, so it doesn&#39;t belong in the learning disability section anyway. So, there you have it. {= )<br><br>As for testimonials, I like the idea, but have only the flimsiest basis for contributing myself (was on meds for depression/anxiety in high school and college; haven&#39;t needed them since).

            <p>Could we potentially have more than just learning disabilities in a testimonial section? Because while I can&#39;t attest to having a learning disability, I did have to learn English as a second language (along with many others on the Board).<br><br>In that same vein, I might also like to contribute to the age section in the FAQ, since, unless you of the oldbies haven&#39;t guessed already, I joined the PPC when I was thirteen, or just a couple months shy of it. Having written a good deal of good and bad fics and missions at that age, I can probably provide something for the badfic author at the same age that I had been when I first started taking writing seriously.</p>

            <p>If the point we want to make on our FAQ for other people to read is that we have zero consideration for bad writers&#39; feelings, someone like Tviokh is the person we ought to quote.<br><br>If we want to convey that we have zero tolerance for bad writing, then we will want more directed anger, such as saying &#39;No matter what your circumstances, by posting your story on the internet you have put it on display, and accepted the responsibility for its quality&#39;. This is essentially a rewording to get away from the specific targetting.<br><br>If, as a third option, we want to give the message that even writers with difficulties can write well - and that therefore, since you are posting on the internet, we assume you are willing to make the extra effort that might be required - then something like what h.o.v. suggested would work nicely, though I can&#39;t contribute anything specific to it.<br><br>And finally, if we want to tell people that having a learning disability or allied trade is a free pass to not do whatever it is you have trouble doing, we can simply say so.<br><br>Personally I think we ought to be aiming for 3, with a side-order of 2 (&#39;That aside, if your story is terrible, we /will/ tell you, and yes, we might still PPC it&#39;), and a hint of 4 (&#39;We are happy to offer constructive criticism to authors who actually want to improve their writing, and in many cases, members of the PPC will even offer to beta-read for you!&#39;).

            <p>The &quot;mean rant&quot; does sound poorly done. I don&#39;t have any stories of horror for you, but I do know that working on your story is the only way to make it good, whether you have a learning disability or not. People with learning disabilities or other such do have to work harder on their stories, but I&#39;d say that they deserve a little more leeway where SPaG is concerned.</p>

            <p>So, after going back and reading ny MST bit through, I realize that I&#39;ve made a whole bunch of references nobody but myself could understand.<br><br>This is because, well, those references coincide with stuff I&#39;m working on, and therefore only I know what I mean when I say them.<br><br>At one point, the comment is made about Keis being king of Estrelain. Estrelain is a made-up continent in the universe the OCs come from, known for rather bookish individuals and a massive cultural involvement.<br><br>Then, a bit later, Salem notes that the Sue looks like &quot;Kyn Redmane&quot;. A picture of Kyn can be found in my DA gallery, with included description of his character in the author&#39;s comments.<br><br>The &quot;Undying Sun&quot; is a name for the in-universe sun deity, Farenral. She is simply called &quot;God&quot; by the people she governs, and Elwe is one of her immortal angels sent to protect mankind from danger whilst hiding within the shadows.<br><br>The spirits, respectively, govern the core elements of water, fire, wind and earth.<br><br>The polyvore links that have smilies in them are due to the author not spacing her colons and letters, and DA assuming I was emoting as a result.<br><br>Hopefully, this clears up some confusion.</p>

            <p>Or maybe not so quick, depending on your perspective. <br><br>There was a post lately on agents that could be adopted for writing by someone else. What exactly classifies an agent as adoptable? <br><br>The reason for my question: lately, I&#39;ve been finding several pages on the Wiki for agents that are clearly no longer active, so I was just wondering. Are obviously-inactive agents adoptable, or must they be specifically offered up for adoption?</p>

            <p>I would at least try to get in touch with the original author first.

Just because there&#39;s nothing explicitly saying you can&#39;t doesn&#39;t mean you should, or that they would be okay with it.

            <p>Since I have a whole kettle full of adopted agents, I think I can partially answer this by referencing the types of agents I currently have.<br><br>1/ The ones I created. These include people like Dafydd, Narto and Lou, and a handful of others. Obviously there&#39;s no problems there.<br><br>2/ The ones I co-created. Most of the cast of <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/ReorgTitle.htm">The Reorganisation</a> were co-created by myself and Vemi. Again, I don&#39;t see any issues here.<br><br>3/ Agents who have specifically been given to me by their author. This is mainly for the Building Maintenance crew, who were passed on to me by JulyFlame when she left. Again, no problems.<br><br>4/ Agents who my agents have been on co-written missions with. This covers primarily Vemi and Constance. The latter is something of a special case halfway between this and 3. I only do this when their author has left, and there&#39;s something specific to do with them (Vemi&#39;s role in Crashing Down was planned before Vemi left, and Constance is of course married to Dafydd). Selene is also sort of in here, but she&#39;s also partly 2.<br><br>5/ Associates of those in 4. This is how I got Penny and Steve. I consider this reasonable, since they only really exist as appendages to the &#39;primary&#39; agents.<br><br>6/ Those whose authors I worked closely with. This is essentially the reason behind my adoption of Starwind and Estelnar; I worked a lot with Boarder!Starwind, on the Multiverse Monitor and some of my stories, and occasionally have roles which her agents fit very well in.<br><br>7/ Long-abandoned agents. By this I mean <i>really</i> long, and I lay no claims of exclusivity. This is more of an &#39;unauthorised borrowing&#39; style of thing, and lies behind my occasional use of Architeuthis, Black and Irvine, and very rarely Jay and Acacia. I justify this (to myself, at least!) by being very careful not to say only I can write them - and I know Archi has shown up recently in some DoI fics, so I apparently pulled it off. Basically, this is the &#39;rescuing and reintegrating into the PPC mythos&#39; category.<br><br>There is another type, which I think is what you remember seeing recently:<br><br>8/ When an author has stopped writing their agents but is still around. In this situation, if there&#39;s a reason you want that particular agent (such as, recently, Lily wanting to use two Time Lords of Tawaki&#39;s) you can just ask the author if you can adopt them. The worst they can do is say no!<br><br>Obviously, the foundation of some of my adoptions is distinctly shaky. I do my best to keep the agents in character, and use them only rarely (Starwind and Estelnar, for instance, have shown up only once, in a &#39;but it&#39;s simply perfect!&#39; moment). If their authors come back, I&#39;ll give them up without a fight - but at the moment, I think they&#39;re better off being used.<br><br>I wonder if that answered your question.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Out of sheer curiousity, which agents are you looking at?</p>

            <p><br>And my feelings are as follows:<br><br>Since I haven&#39;t been active for quite a while now, I don&#39;t mind if you borrow/adopt Crebaina, so long as you show me the results. She kind of got the short end of the character development stick, so it would do my heart good to see someone give her new opportunities. I can provide all her extra canon biography if need be. <br><br>However, Teek has come a long way since her published missions, through a lot of off-Board roleplaying, and I&#39;m pretty attached to her.<br><br>- Lycaenion</p>

            <p>First of all, welcome back to the Board - if you&#39;re staying. If not, I&#39;m glad you stopped by! <br><br>You see, I&#39;ve really enjoyed Teek and Crelmos&#39;s missions - in fact, they&#39;re some of my favorites. I think their interaction is interesting and played very well - Crelmos is creepy enough to infuriate Teek, but not creepy enough to make the story unfunny. I like how in their first mission, it&#39;s an incredibly boring, clichÃ©d Sue, which lets Teek and Crelmos shine.  I keep trying to imagine a Cardassian hobbit, and it cracks me up every time. However, I&#39;m especially fond of the mission with the horse goddess - the way you thoroughly deconstructed the stupidity of the original fic was wonderful, and I like Teek&#39;s speculations about a good story with a lust curse. It might be a plot bunny. And like I said, Crelmos is just the right amount of evil and creepy to make Teek angry, but not so much as to change the story&#39;s tone into anything other than humorous. And that is exemplified in the disguise generator trick he pulls on her. <br><br>I think the third mission&#39;s greatest strength is simply how mind-bogglingly stupid the original fic is, and how Teek and Crelmos are just trying to deal with it. If the results of Crelmos&#39;s &quot;experiment&quot; at the end, and Teek&#39;s reaction to said experiment is ever written, I will read it. <br><br>In fact, if you ever write any more missions involving Teek and Crelmos as partners, or with Crelmos, I will read them. I confess, I haven&#39;t read any more of Teek&#39;s missions because I read those when scouring the wiki for Star Trek stuff. <br><br>Long story short, you have a fan.</p>

            <p>Wow - that stuff is a(n embarrassingly) long time ago in terms of writing and  development of those characters for me. It&#39;s quite nice to hear that you enjoyed it.<br><br>Feel free to keep that plot bunny. :)<br><br>Hmm, let&#39;s see... Teek hasn&#39;t done any Star Trek missions yet, but she&#39;s now in the DMS and has a new partner, Kayla, of whom she is very protective (though Kayla really doesn&#39;t need it). They get along very well, though. As of this July, Teek will be 21. <br><br>Crelmos has stayed in Floaters and is currently partnerless, which he finds preferable. It was very difficult for him to recover from the damage living with Teek did to his mental stability, but he&#39;s getting there. However, missions don&#39;t interest him that much (he still dreams of someday getting back into Research) so he treats them very clinically; he tends to hide in his RC most of the time doing inter-universe scientific literature studies and working on new theories. <br><br>For the future with Trek-related stuff... well, I have a Romulan Agent who&#39;s very enjoyable to write about, along with his World One human partner. And I think Crelmos&#39;s Cardassian ex-girlfriend (she&#39;s not shown up in anything I&#39;ve published, but has had an eventful RP and non-/semi-canon career) could also do with some character revamping. <br><br>Anyway, enough of me rambling. Great to hear from you. :)</p>

            <p>but Boarders who have named Agents after themselves usually have those characters as modified self-inserts(see Trojie/Trojanhorse and Pads/Paddlebrains), and they would probably not like it if people went and used said self-inserts without definite permission on their part.<br><br>You&#39;d be better off trying to get the original writer&#39;s okay for character adoption before using the self-inserts as a large part of any story.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m more and more uncomfortable with the idea of adopting characters without permission (or at least knowing the author well enough to know it&#39;s okay). Definitely try to get in touch with those people first. I guarantee you can track most of them down if you try; they&#39;ll have LiveJournals or deviantART accounts or something. If you get permission, great. If not, I&#39;d strongly suggest letting it go.<br><br>Actually, speaking of permission, Aelin, do you have Permission to PPC yet?

            <p>I think a cameo is when an agent appears in one mission, then vanishes. Cf. the mass exorcism of Alumia. Adoption, OTOH, is permanent (until you go away, anyway) - you use that agent as your own.</p>

            <p>There are some cool little details about how Cafeteria teams work here, but I would love to learn more about how their missions tend to go.  The little you did reveal, you used to good effect, saving the explanation for the bizarre situation up to the end to drop a funny whammy on the reader.<br><br>I am pretty confused by the first coffee(less) scene, though.  I assume the shop lady&#39;s cut-off word was &quot;waiting,&quot; but I&#39;m not sure why she would be stalling, or why Jof Jumped them out of the store.  (Shouldn&#39;t the shop lady have been neuralyzed, or is that a normal occurrence in the Dresdenverse?)  All I can think of is that she had called the police because of Lin&#39;s behavior, but I&#39;m not sure said behavior was threatening enough to warrant that.<br><br>So, yeah.  More Cafeteria missions, please!</p>
