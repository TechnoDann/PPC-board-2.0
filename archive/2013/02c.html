            <p>We&#39;ve all heard about the occasional sneaky reference in a film - George Lucas famously put some version of THX-1138 (the title of his first(?) film) into most of his works, Spielberg put C3PO and R2D2 into Indiana Jones as hieroglyphs, and Pixar apparently <a href="http://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/965673/hidden-gems-in-disney-pixar-films">loves</a> to hide references in their films.<br><br>But what about books? It&#39;s not as easy to sneak something into the background there, where every word is, y&#39;know, a word.<br><br>But it happens anyway. And it&#39;s <i>awesome</i>. So let&#39;s share the ones we know of!<br><br>(I&#39;m not including - necessarily - things like Discworld books referencing other things. I suppose we <i>could</i> list every outside reference in, say, <i>Witches Abroad</i>, but... no. I&#39;m asking about the sneaky references you don&#39;t expect to be there, and half the time you miss. I&#39;m also not thinking of the &#39;might be a reference&#39; things - Harry Dresden says &#39;Stars and stones&#39;, which sounds like Gandalf&#39;s &#39;Seven stars/And seven stones/And one white tree&#39; - but more the bits that sneakily say &#39;Yeah, this totally exists in my universe - in one way or another&#39;)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>(I&#39;ll do my best to keep these spoiler free, of course)<br><br>Two from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Wizards">Young Wizards</a> first:<br><br>-In book 5, <i>The Wizard&#39;s Dilemma</i>, while travelling between universes:<br><br><b>In another [world] he stood on a long narrow spit of land pushing out into a turbulent sea, while the waves crashed all around him, and waited what seemed like nearly an hour for what he knew was coming: a fleet of huge-sailed ships that came riding up out of a terrible storm and with difficulty made landfall by that strange new shore. <br><br>As the last of the strangers came up out of the sea and into their new home, bearing their black banner with its single white tree, Kit glanced down...</b><br><br><a href="http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/a/atalante.html">Far, far away now is Atalantл</a><br><br>... because there&#39;s no way that isn&#39;t the White Tree of Numenor/Gondor, and there&#39;s only one place in the canon that scene could go...<br><br>-In book 3, <i>High Wizardry</i>, we run across this gentleman (large skips here for length &amp; spoilers):<br><br><b>He was built slight and strong, wearing a white shirt and sweater and a long fawn-colored jacket; a fair-haired young man with quick bright eyes and an intelligent face. &#39;Here now,&#39; he said, helping her straighten up. &#39;Careful!&#39; And he said in English.<br><br>[She] opened her mouth to beg for help, but before she could say a word, those wise, sharp eyes had flickered over her and away, taking everything in.<br><br>&#39;Who&#39;s after you?&#39; the man said, quiet-voiced but urgent, glancing back at [her].<br><br>[...] Alarm and quick thought leaped behind those brown eyes. &#39;Right. Here then, take these.&#39; The young man dug down in his jacket pocket, came up with a fistful of bizarrely shaped coins[......]<br><br>She never found out anything about the man who helped her. Nor did he ever find out anything more about her. Pausing by the door [...] after being released from station security some hours later, and being telepathically sensitive (as so many hominids are), he could sense only that some considerable power had been successfully exercised there. Satisfied with that, he smiled to himself and went on about his travels, just one more of the billions of hominids moving about the worlds.</b><br><br>And <i>we</i> never find out any more about him, either. Except that according to <a href="http://dduane.tumblr.com/post/33150854978/speaking-into-the-void-i-would-also-just-like-to-take">Word Of God</a>, he&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Doctor">the Fifth Doctor</a>. Which is awesome.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Another Numenor reference, rather more explicit, shows up in C.S. Lewis&#39; <i>That Hideous Strength</i>:<br><br><b>&#39;It may happen to seem to you the speech of barbarians,&#39; said Ransom, &#39;for it is long since it has been heard. Not even in Numinor was it heard in the streets.&#39;<br><br>The Stranger gave no start and his face remained as quiet as before, if it did not become quieter. But he spoke with a new interest.<br><br>&#39;Your Masters let you play with dangerous toys,&#39; he said. &#39;Tell me, slave, what is Numinor?&#39;<br><br>&#39;The true West,&#39; said Ransom.</b><br><br>(One of several references; the prologue states that &#39;Those who would like to learn further about Numinor and the True West must (alas!) await the publication of much that still exists only in the MSS. of my friend, Professor J.R.R. Tolkien.&#39;)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>This next one I don&#39;t have the book handy, but in Timothy Zahn&#39;s Star Wars novel <i>Allegiance</i>, we meet Stacy, a perky X-Wing pilot who flirts with Han Solo... and <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Stacy">is actually Pink Five from a fan film</a>.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>In Gregory Maguire&#39;s <i>Wicked</i> (based on The Wizard of Oz), Elphaba (aka The Wicked Witch of the West) sings:<br><br><b>Elphaba had an okay voice. [Boq] saw the imaginary place she conjoured up, a land where injustice and common cruelty and despotic rule and the beggaring fist of drought didn&#39;t work together to hold everyone by the neck. No, he wasn&#39;t giving her credit: Elphaba had a <i>good</i> voice. It was controlled and feeling and not histrionic. He listened through to the end, and the song faded into the hush of a respectful pub. Later, he thought: The melody faded like a rainbow after a storm, or like winds calming down at last; and what was left was calm, and possibility, and relief.<br><br>[...] &#39;Elphaba <i>says</i> she&#39;s not religious but see how feelingly she sings of the afterlife,&#39; said Nessarose, and for once no one was inclined to argue.</b><br><br>... and it only occurred to me yesterday which song she&#39;s clearly singing: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somewhere_Over_the_Rainbow">Soooooomewheeeere over the rainbow...</a><br><br><hr>
<br><br>A final pair from <i>Last Watch</i> by Sergei Lukyanenko - the fourth book in the Night Watch trilogy - Russian fantasy. The first book got made into a pair of horror-fantasy films... <i>before</i> the fourth book was written. So Lukyanenko dropped a pair of sneaky references to the films into the book - by casting their events as dreams...<br><br><b>&#39;Ah, what a wonderful dream I had last night,&#39; Semyon exclaimed as he drove into the parking lot. &#39;I&#39;m driving around Moscow in this battered old van, with one of our people sitting beside me... Then suddenly I see Zabulon standing in the middle of the road, dressed like a hobo for some reason. I step on the gas and try to knock him down! But he just waves his hand and puts up a barrier. We go flying up into the air, and somersault right over Zabulon. And we drive on.&#39;<br><br>&#39;So why didn&#39;t you turn back?&#39; I needled him.<br><br>&#39;We were in a hurry to get somewhere.&#39; Semyon sighed.<br><br>&#39;You should drink less, then you wouldn&#39;t be bothered by dreams like that.&#39;<br><br>&#39;They don&#39;t bother me at all,&#39; said Semyon, offended. &#39;On the contrary, I enjoyed it. Like a scene out of some parallel reality...&#39;</b><br><br>And, later on...<br><br><b>&#39;I was a bit angry,&#39; Egor admitted. &#39;But not too much. It wasn&#39;t really your fault. That&#39;s the way your job is... lousy. But I resented it, of course. I even dreamed once that you were really my father. And I was going to become a Dark Magician and work in the Day Watch in order to spite you.&#39;<br><br>[...] &#39;That&#39;s a funny dream,&#39; I said. &#39;They say some dreams are an alternative reality breaking through into our consciousness. Maybe somewhere, somehow, that&#39;s the way it was. You shouldn&#39;t have gone over to the Dark Ones, though...&#39;</b><br><br><hr>
<br><br>And that&#39;s just all I can think of at the moment! Surely if I&#39;ve noticed this many, you lot must have heaps more to share. So go on! Shaaaaare!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well, sort of the flip side... if these are the moments we see other worlds in a book (or game), then what about the moments we see <i>this</i> one?<br><br>I call these &#39;Welcome Back&#39; moments, probably after the line at the beginning of Tomb Raider... Three, I think? &#39;Welcome back to my humble abode. Feel free to take a look around...&#39;<br><br>I think of these not just as the point you realise you&#39;re back in a world you&#39;ve visited before, but the moment it feels like - well, like the canon&#39;s welcoming you back. I never had one for Portal, for instance, even though I dearly love Portal 2. There isn&#39;t one for me anywhere in Discworld, either.<br><br>Actually, I only have two I can think of - and they&#39;re both in films.<br><br>1/ Star Wars. Any of the films, or even the books - but that moment when the first words come up:<br><br><i>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...</i><br><br>That&#39;s when I know I&#39;m <i>back</i>.<br><br>2/ The Hobbit film. The moment about a minute and a half into the soundtrack where it first samples the Shire theme has this effect on me even on the CD. And seeing the Shire itself again... yeah.<br><br>These aren&#39;t just &#39;yup, here again&#39; moments - they&#39;re the moments where it feels like the canon is saying, &quot;Welcome back... we missed you, too, and I know things have changed, but... we&#39;re <i>still here</i>.<br><br>Does anyone else get this (or even understand what I&#39;m saying)? Any examples?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>DawnFire said the Star Trek: TOS titles, but while I love TOS, that&#39;s not the Star Trek that welcomes me in. The titles that welcome me into the Star Trek universe are the Star Trek: TNG ones. Something about that triumphant music and Captain Picard&#39;s rich voice just make me feel at home. Voyager may have the prettiest theme, in my opinion, but it&#39;s TNG that touches me. This probably goes back to a story my parents tell. They say that they would watch TNG when I was maybe one or two years old, and so I&#39;d sit on the floor playing with my toys for most of the episode. But when the opening sequence came on, I would look up and watch the screen intently. Then as soon as it finished I&#39;d go back to playing. So perhaps that opening sequence is ingrained in my subconscious as something wonderful. <br>And Star Trek: TNG is the only fandom that gives me such a strong welcome back feeling. <br>And what you said about the Hobbit movie reminded me of a sort-of related phenomenon: realizing that a new installment or new adaptation really is part of the fandom you know and love. The 2009 Star Trek movie was one of of the first &quot;Star Treks&quot; I saw, but after a while I&#39;d nearly forgotten it, being too immersed in TOS and TNG and eventually Voyager. Then I rewatched it, and it felt so different, so sleek and  &quot;modern&quot; in contrast to the &#39;60s TOS and even the &#39;90s TNG. At one point I even said &quot;This isn&#39;t my Star Trek&quot;. It didn&#39;t feel the same to me. Then the new Dr. McCoy said &quot;Dammit man, I&#39;m a doctor, not a physicist!&quot; - echoing the old McCoy&#39;s catchphrase of &quot;I&#39;m a doctor, not a _______!&quot; that was later used by the doctors on Deep Space Nine and Voyager and became a trademark of Star Trek doctors. It was something small, but it connected the 2009 movie with the rest of the franchise a a way that spoke to me and told me &quot;Yes, we may be shinier and sleeker, but we are still Star Trek.&quot;<br>I&#39;ll stop my Trekkie gushing now.</p>

            <p>The 2009 movie is actually the very first ST I ever saw (yup. Newbie. It&#39;s why I then went back and started at the very beginning). I can see where you&#39;re coming from with the sleek and modern bit, and also with Dr. McCoy&#39;s catchphrase.<br><br>Actually, in TNG, one of the first episodes I saw...well, I was thinking along much the same lines as you were with the 2009 film. I was going, &#39;this isn&#39;t my Star Trek. I want my TOS characters back. The Enterprise is too fancy&#39; (as you can tell, it hadn&#39;t come close to winning me over yet). Then, a rather aged Dr. McCoy came onscreen, and had a conversation with Data, which was, in a word, AWESOME. And it tied everything together, and made it better, and made me laugh. It also made me a little more willing to give TNG a chance, I think. (Since then, I&#39;ve become rather fonder of the TNG characters, but originally...they were just too unfamiliar, and in different uniforms and a fancy starship to boot).<br><br>As it is, I think the TOS titles will always be the ones to &#39;welcome me in&#39;, as we&#39;re calling it. Mainly because I have such fond memories of the series? Who knows. Maybe just because I first heard them nearly four years ago.)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Nearly four years ago? *counts on fingers* Yep, that&#39;s about when I got into Star Trek. The new movie was the first Trek I saw, then I started watching TOS episodes haphazardly and catching TNG reruns. Like I said, after a while I got so immersed in those that the new movie was jarring.<br><br>And that episode you saw? That was the pilot, so I bet they threw that in there to help fans adjust. I&#39;ve never had a problem adjusting to a new Star Trek series because I got into TOS and TNG pretty much simultaneously. Deep Space Nine and Voyager are set in a similar time frame to TNG and have a lot of connections, so that wasn&#39;t so hard either. TNG has become my favorite, but TOS is still awesome, and when you throw DS9 and Voyager into the mix, it&#39;s kind of like they&#39;re all tied for a close second. (Poor Enterprise. No one knows about it.)<br><br>So now that you like TNG, who&#39;s your favorite character? I&#39;m partial to Data myself, and you mentioning him prompted me to ask. Also, Kirk or Picard? (Either answer is acceptable.)</p>

            <p>Yeah, my friend announced, about an hour before I left to go to her house, that we were going to see an awesome movie, called Star Trek, and that I&#39;d love it--don&#39;t worry what it&#39;s about. She was right; it was awesome, and I loved it. I ended up going home with a new fandom, and then started on TOS. This is where our stories are different--I decided to watch TOS all the way through before starting on TNG and everything else. (I haven&#39;t completely stuck to that, but it does mean that my viewing of TNG episodes has been rather sporadic).<br><br>Ah, was it? That explains a lot. I&#39;m glad they threw that scene in! It was a great scene, and it sort of gave Dr. McCoy&#39;s mark of approval to the series. (It also helped introduce Data, and establish him as a great character).<br><br>As for Enterprise, I know about it--but not that much. I know it has Admiral Archer (I think?), and a Vulcan named...T&#39;pol, I believe, and--well, basically, I know a little bit. Haven&#39;t seen it, though. Then again, I haven&#39;t seen Voyager or DS9 yet, either.<br><br>I&#39;m actually still gettng into TNG (doubt I&#39;ve seen more than 10 episodes or so), but from what I&#39;ve seen so far...probably Picard and Data. Geordi LaForge as well, I think. Other than that, I don&#39;t really know the characters so well, or they haven&#39;t made enough of an impression on me yet. (I&#39;ve mainly been bouncing around, watching episodes that look interesting, such as the Moriarty ones and &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot;, which I actually want to rewatch soon.)<br><br>Honestly, I tend to be partial to pretty much any logical character, I think. It&#39;s a good thing, logic. It&#39;s also something I&#39;ve tried to partially adopt, so it&#39;s got some personal meaning for me.<br><br>Kirk or Picard? Kirk, sorry. Always. Picard is great, but...I&#39;ve got to go with Kirk. Probably always will. (Although, side point, have you seen Patrick Stewart in X-Men or Hamlet? He&#39;s pretty awesome in both. Definitely worth seeing. Especially Hamlet--now, that movie is one I can go on about for quite a while!)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Well, Archer is the name of the captain on Enterprise, and there was a reference to Admiral Archer&#39;s dog in the new movie, so fanon is that they are one and the same. Poor dog.<br><br>Only ten episodes? You have a lot of awesomeness ahead of you. :) If you&#39;re jumping around, here are my recommendations:<br>All the two part episodes (most especially &quot;Unification&quot; - it has Spock!)<br>&quot;Relics&quot; (brings back Scotty)<br>&quot;Data&#39;s Day&quot; (exactly what it sounds like)<br>&quot;The Inner Light&quot; (Picard lives an entire life in 15 minutes, really powerful)<br>&quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; (Starfleet tries to rule that Data is property, not a person)<br>&quot;The Offspring&quot; (Data tries to create a daughter)<br>&quot;Disaster&quot; (the title happens, and the crew are stranded in strange situations around the ship)<br>Pretty much any episode with Lt. Barclay<br>Time travel episodes (&quot;Time&#39;s Arrow&quot; is my favorite)<br>Holodeck episodes<br><br>Story arcs that should be viewed in order:<br>The Q episodes (Q is just...<i>made</i> of awesome)<br>The Lore episodes (Data&#39;s evil twin is a really interesting character)<br>Borg episodes (&quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; is quite possibly the best episode of the entire show)<br>The Klingon political episodes (if it&#39;s Worf-centric, it&#39;s probably this)<br><br>Though I&#39;m slightly biased. Most of my favorite episodes are Data-centric. He <i>is</i> my favorite character. <s>And my Lust Object for TNG</s>.(You didn&#39;t just see that.) <br><br>FYI, &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot; is DS9. It was the first episode of DS9 I watched. Tribbles! The way they kept making in-jokes back to the original episode - and the fact that I caught every one. Of course, I&#39;ve seen the original &quot;Trouble with Tribbles&quot; about ten times (I watch it whenever I&#39;m sick), so that&#39;s to be expected. :)<br><br>*finally succeeds in stemming the flow of Star Trek gushing*<br></p>

            <p>For me, it would have to be the Star Trek TOS titles. You know, you&#39;ve got the opening scene, and then you get 60s-era fake!space, with the music, and Captain Kirk starts talking, and the music swells...that always makes me grin and relax.<br><br>There&#39;s also every time I see the Shire, or hear the music for it, but that&#39;s a little different. Also, most descriptions of Elves or beautiful places in Tolkien&#39;s work.<br><br>Not to mention every single CAD reading in PPC stories ever (Yup. I&#39;m serious. It&#39;s one of my favorite things from the Original Series, and I love how there are so many different types now--but they all follow the same pattern, just with slightly different additions. My favorites are the ones that come just before the CAD dies--ie, [Elliswen Northstar. Non-canon. Mary-SuewhatisthiskillitnooooIwannalivebutit&#39;sonlyafleshwoundgetthecow! Cranberries!] and then it starts smoking--although the ones that offer opinions on OOC levels and courses of action are a close second. And it&#39;s always something familiar, that&#39;s never going to change so much that it&#39;ll be unrecognizable).<br><br>Also in PPC fiction, playing cards or listening to music on the job. Or an agent holding back a homicidal partner.<br><br>...I should probably stop there. I do have things that I&#39;m supposed to do today and, you know, they should get done. Mainly because they involve going to visit my cousins, the transport for which leaves in an hour...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>...unfortunately, I can only find video game examples again.<br><br>1) In every <i>Metroid</i> title, there&#39;s a little <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzFUL9dzmts&amp;list=PLF44182750EB9CD84&amp;index=10"> jingle</a> that plays once you step out of the save station at the start of the game. These six notes just evoke that &quot;welcome back&quot; feel.<br><br>2) Anytime you get your hands on the Master Sword in <i>Zelda</i>. It&#39;s the same sword that&#39;s been passed on from hero to hero, slain countless monsters, dueled against the Dark Lord time after time, and now it&#39;s <i>your</i> turn to hold it.<br><br>3) Nintendo gives you the most awesome blast to the past by having you visit the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5nfZbKJIpk"> Throwback Galaxy</a>, a remake of Thwomp&#39;s Fortress from <i>Super Mario 64</i>.

            <p>Well, you took the <i>Young Wizards</i> ones, so I&#39;ll have to stretch a bit. {; P<br><br>Let&#39;s see... well, in the second book in the Death Gate Cycle by Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman, there&#39;s a character called Zifnab who occasionally says things like this:<br><br><i>&quot;Great Gandalf&#39;s ghost!&quot; shouted Zifnab. &quot;If he had a ghost. I doubt it. He was such a snob . . . Where was I?&quot;</i><br><br>Also, he has a dragon, and they have this conversation:<br><br><i>&quot;My dragon? Save anybody?&quot; Zifnab shook his head sadly. &quot;You must have him confused with someone else—Smaug, perhaps? No? Ah, I&#39;ve got it! That lizard who gave Saint George such a nasty time of it! What was his name, now </i>there<i> was a dragon!&quot;<br><br>&quot;And you are implying that I&#39;m not?&quot; ... &quot;Smaug!&quot; the dragon thundered. &quot;That vain-glorious fop! And as for that sniveling worm who took on St. George—&quot; ... &quot;And to think I ended up with a worthless old faker like you!&quot; the dragon was shouting. &quot;I could have gone someplace where I would have been appreciated! Pern, for example!&quot;</i><br><br>So that&#39;s Middle-earth, England, and Pern implied to exist, all in one go! ... Not really that sneaky unless you don&#39;t know those names, though.<br><br>There&#39;s also a character named Fizban in the <i>Dragonlance</i> series by the same authors. They may or may not be, but probably are, the same person.<br><br><i>&quot;Ah, well. Let&#39;s see.&quot; The old man muttered to himself. &quot;Fiz—No, I can&#39;t use that. Furball. Doesn&#39;t seem quite dignified enough. I have it!&quot; he shouted, smiting Paithan on the arm. &quot;Zifnab!&quot;</i><br><br>So there&#39;s that, too, as a bonus. *g*<br><br>~Neshomeh, who recommends reading the Death Gate Cycle.</p>

            <p>IIRC, the <i>Death Gate Cycle</i>, is, to borrow a term from TvTropes, an After the End scenario of Earth. Fizban, OTOH, is Paladine, one of Krynn&#39;s deities.<br>They are very similar, though, and since DGC is After the End, it&#39;s probable, in my opinion, that Zifnab simply knows LotR, Pern, and his Christian mythology.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sure I remember it as being Fizban. But admittedly I didn&#39;t check it, since all my books are right now packed in neatly stacked cardboard boxes, with all authors starting with W somewhere in the bottom of the stack.<br>It sounds like you&#39;ve either read the books more recently than I or have a better memory, so you&#39;re probably right.<br>A great piece of dialogue no matter who said it.</p>

            <p>Yes, I have read the Inheritence Cycle, and no, I don&#39;t hate it. It&#39;s not the greatest work of literature I have ever read, but it&#39;s not the worst either. Anyway, that&#39;s beside the point, what you care about is the Doctor in Alagaлsia.<br><br>In Brisinger, Eragon and Aria are talking when Aria scribbles a poem in the dirt. While the entire thing has to do somewhat with the Doctor, the telling line is: &#39;the lonelly god with many faces, among the stars&#39;<br><br>In another section, Solembum the Werecat gives a little speach to Eregon about the things the cat has seen in his life that is potentialy full of Doctor Who references, though only one point is a clear reference.<br><br>&quot;There are many strange forces at work in Alagesia, Shadeslayer. I have seen things that defy belief: whirlwinds of light spinning in caverns deep below the ground, men who age backward, stones that speak, and shadows that creep. Rooms bigger on the inside than the outside... Galbatorix is not the only power in the world to be reckoned with, and he may not even be the strongest.&quot;<br><br>The clear reference here is the &quot;Rooms bigger on the inside than the outside...&quot; referencing the TARDIS. Other potential references are: The Weaping Angels with &quot;Stone that speaks,&quot; though that would more acurately be stone that moves. The Doctor could be thought of as a man who &quot;ages backward,&quot; though that sounds more like Benjamin Button. Finaly the Vashta Nerada with &quot;shaddows that creep.&quot;<br><br>And finaly, Angela the herbalist was knitting a hat with runes on it. When asked what the runes read, she said, &quot;Raxacori- Oh never mind. It wouldn&#39;t mean anything to you anyway.&quot; The word she was going to say was likely Raxacoricofallapatorius, which was a planet featured on Doctor Who.<br><br>There are probably other references in the seres to other works, but because the author acnolaged the amount of Doctor Who references in one of the afterwords (&quot;Also, for those who understood the reference to a &#39;lonely god&#39; when Eragon and Arya are sitting around the campfire, my only excuse is that the Doctor can travel everywhere, even alternate realities. Hey, I&#39;m a fan too!&quot;) I decided to share those particular references.</p>

Sticky, fattening - quite deadly. There I was, with only two quid and a Tube pass, beset by Jelly Babies, when...Ah, but never mind. When the Jelly Babies come for you...you will find out on your own.&quot;</b><br><br>So...Jelly Babies.<br><br>The first book of the Kane Chronicles, <i>The Red Pyramid</i>, references Percy Jackson.

Other gods.

I&#39;m also a member of the &#39;joined in the last 2 months&#39; club. Glad you decided to join us!). Sorry for the potentially late welcome--I was away from the internet for the holidays. Have a large bar of Swiss Bleepolate--it distracts you with sugary goodness while working to erase whatever horrific details you&#39;ve just been exposed to. Also, the pin from a LotR Sue&#39;s fake Lorien cloak (it looks and acts just like the real ones--except that it&#39;s much more sparkly, so it doesn&#39;t exactly camouflage well). Wear it/use it to distract people in good health!<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s take Eragon as an example of bad characterization. On one hand, he claims to be all fair-play and willing to accept his enemies&#39; surrender. On the other hand... remember when he decimated an entire patrol with Arya whilst on foot? The sole survivor of the squad threw down his weapons  but Eragon chased him down even as the man pleaded for his life, made it clear that <i>he was unarmed and was surrendering for God&#39;s sake</i>... and Eragon catches up to him and wrings his neck like a chicken. <br><br>Not cool. That&#39;s a war crime.<br><br>Paolini also has no grasp of nuclear physics whatsoever. Apparently, one Rider decided that he was going to turn himself into a nuke by saying something along the lines of &quot;herp derp, E=MC<sup>2</sup>&quot; (just how exactly did they discover the principles of nucleon-nucleon interaction with the technology they have now? You need to set up experiments involving electricity and charged particles to do that) and takes a chunk of Doru Araeba with him. He also leaves radioactive fallout behind too.<br><br>What.<br><br>Radioactivity is caused by the breakdown of instable isotopes. It affects living organisms by imparting energy into their flesh through particles given off by radioactive decay. Now, the book assumes that the person just becomes energy (I&#39;m going to guess thermal, sound, and light, it is an explosion after all) just like that. There <i>is</i> no radioactive decay involved, nor is the fission of refined U-235, which is the usual source of radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons.</p>

            <p>Not on the first point though, that was a bad moment in characterization. Of corse, we always have Galbatorix mind control to worry about, so perhaps he was not as bloodthirsty as it seemed. Still, I do see your point and took issue with Eragon as a character because of which.<br><br>However, on the nuclear physics problem, I do have to take issue. While I do not remember the passage you are referring to, I do know there is only one way this could be possible, and that&#39;s magic. This is a fantasy world of magic, and once you get magic into the fray, just about anything is possible. Is it a cheap excuse? Probably, however that is how it is. The elves have shown a clear understanding of several scientific principals because they were able to study it using magic, literally feeling how things worked. Add extra long life and a mind that can turn people insane by probing it, and you have a people who can know allot with very little technology.<br><br>Further, and this is a gripe about bad physics complainers in general, this is a brand new world. This is a completely different universe, with different rules, different systems. All of our science and physics, which are all theories for a reason might I add, are based off observations from our planet in our solar system in our galaxy, of which is one in billions at least. While fictional works set in other universes have the added bonus of having the possibility of completely different physics rules than our own, what is to say a different planet in a different solar system, perhaps in a whole other galaxy works in a way we currently think is impossible. <br><br>Now, this is not to say writers necessarily have a Get Out of Physics Free card, as they have to work with the rules of their world. I don&#39;t care if they have blatantly horrible science that make all scientists everywhere turn in their beds, as long as they stick to their world&#39;s rules. If your magic has a system to work with, then you break the rules later for &#39;cool factor&#39; or Dues ex Machina, I have an issue with that. Because what I care about is a good story, something that entertains me or gets me to think in some way. Dues ex Machina is not good storytelling, but science is not necessary for good storytelling. If it is, then clearly everybody who wants to write any form of novel needs to have studied all of the history and science that exists to make sure it is accurate, and all sorts of great fantasy stories would not be nearly as entertaining as they are.<br><br>There, my rant is finished. It&#39;s just been a problem of mine for a while, and I felt I had to share my feelings on it. </p>

            <p>They all have points: the theory thing is a pet peeve of mine too, and science is not limited to studying our solar system. There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s the gravitational constant of the <i>universe</i>.<br>But that&#39;s not your point, which is that science and magic don&#39;t play nice. As you said, &quot;once you get magic into the fray, just about anything is possible&quot;. Introducing magic or science to the continuum diminishes or contradicts the existence of the other. Star Trek makes an effort to disprove every bit of &quot;magic&quot; they see (the ones they don&#39;t technobabble away are implied, Q being a prime example. In a way, it cements his trickster status, since it riles the main characters up that they can&#39;t explain him. But I digress), and Percy Jackson-verse demigods can&#39;t use cell phones. So while I can&#39;t speak on the specific scene (it&#39;s been a while since I read Eragon), I can say that nuclear physics and science are <i>very</i> hard to make compatible.<br>And that you should follow the established rules of your universe. That is the true indicator of Canon Sue-ishness - for example, Wesley Crusher is a Canon Sue because Picard lets him drive the ship when a) there are qualified Starfleet officers who should have that job and b) Picard doesn&#39;t like children all that much.<br>Anyhow, good points. Glad someone spoke up on the other side. One sided discussions aren&#39;t discussions.</p>

            <p>Devil&#39;s Advocate means that you are arguing a position that is counter to the one you hold and that doing so will clarify your own position as well as the one you currently argue.

You&#39;ve shot your own argument in the foot, here.<br><br>I do completely agree with you that a fantasy universe should follow its own rules.  Scientists agree with that, in fact.  Scientists love fantasy novels as much as the next person, or so I have been led to believe by hS&#39;s continued love of the Lord of the Rings.  The problem in this instance is that Eragon doesn&#39;t follow the rules the author seems to have set up.</p>

            <p>...but then I got off onto a rant, forgot what I set the subject heading as, and sorta left it. Yeah, my bad.<br><br>As for the Hypocrisy in my statement, I see what you mean and desided to rephrase it. What I meant was that the elves use so much magic, they have begun to understand the way their world works on a deeper level then other beings, a form of science that is possable in their world that would require advanced technology to understand for our world. This was in responce to the question on how a rider could understand nuclear theory without the technology to support it. However, I worded it poorly (along with the rest of my statement aparently) and thus did not say what I wished to say in the best way posable.</p>

            <p>&quot;<i>[Our current scientific theories are based off of] observations from our planet in our solar system in our galaxy, of which it is one in billions[...].</i>&quot;<br><br>I think <i>A Brief History of Time</i> covers this, but I think I might be getting my sources mixed up here.<br><br>The problem with saying that the laws of physics don&#39;t apply to other areas of the universe is that that&#39;s implying there is another invisible force at work which modifies the behaviour of the aforementioned laws that we know.

            <p>(I just finished a 9-week astronomy course with Coursera, so...)<br><br>We observe from the cosmic microwave background ratiation (&quot;the background temperature of the universe&quot;) that the energy levels in our bit of space - barring minor fluctuations like galaxy clusters and such - are remarkably uniform. Not <i>completely</i> uniform - there&#39;s fluctuations in the CMBR, which correspond in size to the expansion of the universe since the moment space became transparent.<br><br>[Quick explanation of this: If we imagine a bit of space one light-year across, which suddenly begins emitting randomised light across itself while expanding - and that one year later it has reached <i>two</i> light-years across - the light moving around in there will not have had time to cross the whole distance. Therefore, while in a small area of this space the temperature/light energy will have averaged out, there is <i>no causal connection</i> between the two sides of our &#39;bit of space&#39; - they can&#39;t average with each other, so any imbalance when we set the light free remains present]<br><br>Unfortunately, the size of our observable universe (about 46 billion light-years, I think) is such that, were it to have been expanding steadily since the Big Bang, <i>at the time space became transparent</i> there wouldn&#39;t have been enough time for points on opposite sides of what we <i>now</i> see to have averaged out. Therefore, we ought to see wild imbalances in the CMBR, where very early fluctuations were preserved.<br><br>We don&#39;t. Therefore, it is hypothesised that <i>very</i> early in the universe&#39;s life, the whole thing expanded massively, meaning points which had already averaged out were suddenly too far away to have done so, were it not for this <b>inflation</b>.<br><br>But... it was proven last year that we (almost certainly) live in an infinite, flat universe. That means it was <i>always</i> infinite... just more compressed (that&#39;s how infinity works, I&#39;m afraid). Which means that <i>despite</i> inflation, there are still (sigh) infinite reaches of space which did <i>not</i> have time to average out... and thus could have quite, quite different energy levels.<br><br>Of course, we <i>do</i> know that they&#39;re far beyond what <i>we</i> can see... which is quite a lot, really.<br><br>hS, astronomy!</p>

Hence, the <i>theory</i> of gravity, or the <i>theory</i> of relativity.

            <p>Oh my, I am so sorry, I did not mean for it to seem like I disregarded science. I know what scientific theories are and how they are different from regular theories. The reason I said it like that was because science can, and does, change. That is one of it&#39;s greatest qualeties in my opinion! Because it can change to fit the new data that is found that was perviously unknown, it can adapt to fit the truth much beter than some blanket statement of &#39;it is this and nothing elce.&#39; So when I say &#39;It&#39;s just a theory,&#39; I say it with pride rather than dismissal. My point was that there are several peices of data that we do not have yet, and so when somebody says that it is scientificaly incorrect, I have to wonder if it tuely is. Just because our current science says it is impossable, because it is theory not fact, we are able to see if it is possable under different conditions then what we have seen so far. So that was what I meant to say, not to insinuate that I disregarded science and the scientific principal.</p>

            <p>THAT NUKE THERE IS A SPAH.<br><br>...but yes, Eragon survives a nuke in the face. That pretty much sums up how OP our protagonist is. Then again, he did cure cancer, so nukes are no biggie.<br><br>If ever there is a sequel to the Inheritance <s>trilogy</s> cycle, I am betting Eragon will invent necromancy or something and overrule the you-can&#39;t-mess-with-the-dead theme that was present in Brom&#39;s death.

            <p>Not even the mages in my Made&#39;s Travels series are quite that OP. (And trust me, sometimes I wonder where my head was in regards to Shepard Hallend.)<br><br>For that matter, not even the Immortal Eldraec (no, that is their title of address, they don&#39;t actually being to any specific race) aren&#39;t that bad. Sure, I might have had them be ridiculously powerful and able to withstand any instant-death method that Fate did not say would kill them (because that&#39;s the only canonical way they can die - Fate had to decide as such. The Eldraec are basically representatives of the gods, after all.), but at least there&#39;s some power st work that holds them to this guideline. Eragon is apparently flipping off whatever unexplained deities exist in his world. Which I guess is par for the course, considering he&#39;s an arrogant prick.<br><br>So, Eragon had outclassed my mages, and is dangerously close to outclassing my immortal demigods. Wonderful.</p>

            <p><i>In popular stories, people who don&#39;t like the character with a Chosen One archetype who learns magic and other stuff are apt to use Gary Stu as an insult.</i><br><br>Maybe this isn&#39;t what you mean, but that line seems to say that the <i>only</i> possible reason for people to think Eragon is a Gary Stu is that they just hate the whole Hero&#39;s Journey thing. This is problematic to me for a couple of reasons.<br><br>First, why did all of these people pick up the book in the first place if they hate the archetype so much? It&#39;s pretty obvious pretty quickly that Eragon is a Fated Hero with a Quest of Destiny, IMO.<br><br>Second, this is a very widely used archetype we&#39;re talking about, appearing in such monumental works as the original <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy, <i>The Matrix</i>, <i>Harry Potter</i>, and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Many of us here are fans of these things, and yet dislike Eragon. Are these people, personally, insulting a character for no good reason just because they dislike his whole character archetype, or is it possible that they have logical reasons backed up with facts about his particular characterization and story? Perhaps a sort of &quot;list of charges&quot; against him, if you will?<br><br>Now, it&#39;s entirely possible that <i>some</i> people have hurled insults at Eragon just to be trolls or hipsters or whatever and could never have enjoyed that type of story, let alone this one in particular, but you seem to have tarred <i>everyone</i> who thinks he&#39;s a Stu with one haterbrush. Just sayin&#39;, you might want to think that allegation over a little bit.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

That&#39;s fine - people are allowed to define words however they want.<br><br>However, the PPC definition <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mary_Sue">strongly implies</a> (although it doesn&#39;t appear to actually state) that a Mary-Sue - when the PPC-at-large talks about them - is first and foremost a <i>badly-written</i> character.<br><br><i>To avoid killing a real character, the assassination must be justified with charges. Some characters may only be borderline Sues, with the potential to become real people with a bit of outside help.</i><br><br>Thus, as a fact of definition, a Mary-Sue is badly written. While there is a comment to this effect on the linked Wiki page:<br><br><i>It is important to note that this does not automatically mean that a Mary Sue character can&#39;t be enjoyable to read about if written well, but there&#39;s the rub: it is extremely difficult to write about this character type in a way that creates an entertaining story.</i><br><br>... I understand this to mostly be discussing parodies of various stripes. The self-aware Sues, the ones the canons are aware of, the ones who get nitpicked or the ones who lose - these are fun to read about, because they&#39;re being written <i>as a Mary-Sue</i>, not as an attempt to make a wonderful character.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So, what I&#39;ve gotten from that is Eragon has &#39;Stu qualities, but having those qualities doesn&#39;t necessarily make him one because the story is well-written. Am I on the right track?</p>

            <p>In the linked Mary Sue page, there&#39;s a distinction made between characteristics <i>associated</i> with Sues (Secondary Traits) and characteristics that <i>make</i> a Sue (Primary Traits). IMO, Kippur demonstrates that Eragon possesses all three primary traits, therefore he is a Stu by our definition, regardless of the technical quality of the writing (which, as hS points out, is debatable).<br><br>That doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not allowed to enjoy the books, though. If it doesn&#39;t matter to you whether he&#39;s a Stu or not, and they give you joy, then who cares? {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The thing is, in some ways &#39;well-written&#39; is subjective. Obviously actual errors in grammar and elementary logic are one thing, but when it comes down to &#39;unbelievable&#39;, then... well, practically <i>all of fiction</i> is unbelievable. No, boys who have grown up on a farm don&#39;t go on to become Jedi super-pilots who can down giant war machines with a freak shot - they go on to become farmers, or at best, in times of extreme need, mediocre pilots after a whole heap of training.<br><br>So you draw the line in your own head. Doubtless there are people who think Luke Skywalker is a Gary-Stu - equally, for literally any character you can name, there are going to be people who think they&#39;re well-written and entertaining.<br><br>(However, all that said, I personally think Eragon <i>does</i> fail Basic Logic - both my wife and the Kippur sporkings note &#39;the Urgals sprang back, motionless&#39; in <i>the prologue</i>. It takes some doing to go wrong that fast...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Probably not a good idea to reply to the spambot - all xir posts will just be poofed anyway. I&#39;m not entirely sure if it creates more work for TNA, but in any case, stamping your IP on a reply to something spamming misspelled swears is <i>probably</i> not the best idea.

            <p>As in, Morgoth has invested most of his powers to Arda in order to control it. He failed to gain full control, but he&#39;s powerful enough at his height to make you sneeze outside of flu season, or spice shops. Or at least, that&#39;s what he said. I may need to tip off Aule to repair the Door of the Night. I don&#39;t want my village of orcs to stop knitting just because there is Dagor Dagorath looming. Which by the way, how I got my title Dark Lord.

            <p>...is that it made me think I had three replies and got all excited. Oh well.<br><br>[Ooh, so sarung is the plural of sarong? Didn&#39;t know that. I did know what a sarong is, though, but thanks for the clarification anyway]<br><br>I can give you hugs from six (6) mini-Balrogs, as well as several giant bars of Swiss Bleepolate. I unfortunately have yet to acquire a mini-Aragog (or a guide to caring for them), but I have copious amounts of glitter left from an exploding Sue in an RP. You can have as much of it as you like, as long as you&#39;re the one to get it off the walls and furniture. I can send an agent or two with the rest.<br><br>Do you do fireproof carpets? A couple of those would be useful, as would a couple of pairs of fireproof gloves. So would a mini-Balrog-resistant tablecloth. And a low-grade (or medium-grade, if supplies last) armor sarong would come in handy for any missions to Tamora Pierce&#39;s Tricksterverse...<br><br>(My brain is currently trying to run away with the idea of a crazy agent or two having a picnic with several minis. It&#39;s a very strange idea, at least the way it&#39;s going in my head. It&#39;ll probably end up happening.)<br><br>~DawnFire<br><br>PS: ...no wonder I have six mini-Balrogs. I was just asking for that, putting &#39;fire&#39; as part of my name.<br><br>PP<s>C</s>S: To that end, I have just now decided to give Agent Dawn a very embarrassing surname, which most likely deals with pyromania. Now what should it be...<br><br>PPPS: Hm. I seem to be making a habit of thinking up ways to embarrass Agent Dawn. This may be a bad thing for Agent Dawn.</p>

            <p>[The first one, sarung, is the word in Malay language, while the second, sarong, is the word in english language. In Malay, the plural for sarung is actually sarung-sarung. I sometimes revert to Malay if the word is borrowed from there, sorry.]<br><br>Sarung is just a large piece of cloth sewed into a cylinder. Human-made sarongs can&#39;t really made them into armour, but the orcs made some sarongs that are resistant against swords and arrows, thanks to those Children of Shelob. <br><br>Our cloth armour are more like gambesons, but a bit lighter.  Some of my orcs do work with chainmail, and we use 60% aluminum, 40% steel to reduce its weight. We may also add the sarong with a layer of metal plates, if you wish for added protection. My orcs are still receiving training on making armour trousers, so those have to wait. We also throw in sarong belts to hold up your sarong, especially for long fights or running. Can&#39;t have it slip off while fighting Sues, yes?<br><br><br>If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;ll have two of my orcs to clean the place. They are quite trained in cleaning stuffs, and can make the room smells of lemons too, if you want. Point my orcs to the location, and they&#39;ll do their best.<br><br>I&#39;ve prepared in my lair, a fire-resistant carpet, and a fire-resistant tablecloth, 3 pairs of fireproof gloves, four pairs of sarongs and their accompanying belts, two low and two medium grades, two pairs of our gambesons, a chainmail armour, the two orcs for cleanup, and copious amount of bacon and eggs, for the mini-Balrogs. I do hope the mini-Balrogs don&#39;t bite, the orc-kids have been pestering their parents for weeks, and I&#39;ve promised them something to entertain the kids. Even orcs need their rest, yes? It will be waiting for your portal to open, and don&#39;t forget to bring your mini-Balrogs and Swiss Bleepolates. <br><br>The mini-Aragogs can wait, but I&#39;d like an agent to supervise us on mini-Balrog safety. I know they like eggs and bacon, but they may still be dangerous, being a Flame of Udun and all that. I&#39;ve prepared some fire-resistant clothing for the kids, but better preparation can&#39;t hurt.<br><br>Anyways, feedback on our products are very much appreciated. Dark Lord Glitter Glamour, clothing orcs, men, and fashionable Sues since 1985.<br><br>[I&#39;m implying that I&#39;m not the first lord of these orcs, nor the first one to think of making a boutique using these orcs as labour. As for the picnic, let me know when you&#39;ve written it. It must be awesome. Sarong can be made with any type of clothing fibre, cotton, silk, nylon, you name it. If the scientists can produce commercially affordable spider-silk, it will also be used to make sarongs.]</p>

            <p>[Ah, I see. I&#39;m familiar with the English version, both from Tamora Pierce&#39;s books and from actually owning a green one. What &#39;verse is Malay from?]<br><br>Gambesons? *looks up a picture* Ooh, I like! :D Very nice.<br><br><i>We may also add the sarong with a layer of metal plates, if you wish for added protection.</i><br>Very useful, that sounds. Yoda, I <s>am</s> am not.<br><br><i>We also throw in sarong belts to hold up your sarong, especially for long fights or running. Can&#39;t have it slip off while fighting Sues, yes?</i><br>Definitely not. Can&#39;t have the Sue start taunting the agents about their clothes falling down. Also, can&#39;t have the agents saying, &#39;Oh, so sorry, would you mind waiting a moment while I put this back on? Thanks.&#39; Belts are mandatory.<br>(Oh dear. That&#39;s probably going to happen at some point--the sarong falling down, that is. I really am too fond of thinking up embarrassing things for my agents...)<br><br>Ooh! I will be quite glad to welcome your orcs. I don&#39;t suppose they can make the room smell of lavender, though? I prefer it to lemons. Tell them to come to my room at the Board...whatever-it-is. Alternatively, if they can&#39;t find it, try Agent Dawn&#39;s RC 18. The glitter may have moved there once it discovered that RC 18 is somewhat more tangible than my room at the Board.<br><br>That sounds <i>perfect</i>. Thanks very much--that was extremely prompt, too! In light of the size of the order, Agent Dawn will be bringing Agents Edgar and Brenda along with her. Please don&#39;t be alarmed by Dawn&#39;s craziness, Edgar&#39;s sobriety, or Brenda&#39;s...well, actually, she&#39;s probably the least unusual of the three, for a PPC agent. Just keep any and all bad writing away from her. But yes, don&#39;t be alarmed--they&#39;re more or less harmless, as long as they&#39;re not provoked and you&#39;re not a Sue. Dawn will talk your ear off, Edgar will ferry the orders back through the portal, and Brenda will supervise the minis. And don&#39;t worry, the minis are quite well-trained. Two belong to a former OFUM student, one is, unfortunately, somewhat depressed, one feels that it should be a mountain (and is somewhat exuberant), and the last two tend to be very calm and spend a lot of time safeguarding Agent Dawn/their RC. (The mini-Balrogs, in order, are Glorfinel and Ectheleon, Neinor, Caradharas, and Gladladriel and Kelaborn). The only one to really watch out for is Caradharas--its main appearance in canon (properly spelled, that is) contains a wicked temper and an avalanche. Let it near only the bounciest of orc-kids. The rest should be fine, but Agent Brenda will oversee them (with Agent Dawn supposedly helping) just in case. I&#39;m sure the minis will be glad to see some new people--just keep fanbrats away from them, if you have any. They&#39;re liable to be chased. (The bars of Swiss Bleepolate will be with Agent Dawn, by the way). Thanks very much for preparing food for the minis; they really do like to eat!<br><br>Feedback will most likely come in the form of mentions and usage in missions. I&#39;m sure everything will work out quite well :)<br><br>[Well, it is a very evil idea. It also keeps the orcs out of trouble, and prevents them from constant attack by residents of Middle-earth, where I assume the factory is--they&#39;re a fully legitimate business, and they make such useful things! No need to wipe them out. As to the picnic...*sigh* It looks  like it&#39;ll definitely be happening--it&#39;ll most likely be an interlude called &#39;Agent Dawn and the Mini-Balrog Picnic <s>of Doom</s>&#39;. I don&#39;t know where exactly it&#39;ll end up taking place--possibly on the grounds of OFUM, if that&#39;s allowed--but it will make quite a bit of use of the fireproof tablecloth, and will hopefully not contain too much terrorizing of innocent wildlife. (...it&#39;s going to end up with the minis chasing OFUM students, isn&#39;t it. Oh dear.) Thanks for mentioning fireproof tablecloths and thereby inspiring the idea (really, what else does one do with a fireproof tablecloth but have a picnic with mini-Balrogs? Or perform mad science experiments, I suppose...)]<br><br>~DF</p>

I wear fire-orange-coloured contacts when I need to impress someone, but my glasses are still required to see well. I&#39;m moderately near-sighted, making me useless with ranged weapons if my glasses are lost. Also, I&#39;m afraid to stick anything into my eyes, so I won&#39;t be using contacts often.<br><br>Agent Edgar can have as much coffee as we have. Our feast meals are quite spicy, except for the pizza, so we will provide a little milk for the tongue. But do bring your own, we may run short on those.<br><br>I think the portal&#39;s opening here. And right next to our stage too! I&#39;ll have the orcs standing now.<br><br>[Actually, I want to make Dark Lord Aakmal to be a human, an Easterling if you will, and he is the one managing and selling most of the stuff. Most orcs can pass for humans in bad need for makeup if they shave their whole body, but they&#39;ll shave your skin off if you dare force them. Highly embarrassing, they say. So the main point of me being there is to sell their products for them. My character didn&#39;t speak Orcish well yet, but he&#39;s still learning slowly. Also, sorry I didn&#39;t have actual fire-eyes.] <br><br>[Being that they are orcs, they had to wear ridiculous outfits to sell stuffs in the home region before I arrive. After that, I&#39;m the one mostly selling the stuffs. And since they often bicker over the money, I had to split them well, thus securing my closeness to the orc chieftain. Thus a few months after being an amateur-treasurer-cum-paramedic-cum-language-teacher-cum-jack-of-many-trades, the orc chieftain entrusts me with the position of Dark Lord, with the support of three other orc underground villages. I make them live together, since each village only has 200 orcs at the most. Now I&#39;m under control of 500 orcs, 200 of them battle-and-knitting-and-looming ready. The spiders of Shelob are more like pets, but some orc-kids do lost their lives when they play with them too roughly, thus the need for guide to caring for mini-Aragogs. I assume they will be quite similar.]<br><br>[I had to provide them with better food than they could manage, that is lichens, jungle plants, and a few stolen cows and rare hunted animals, as part of my oath as their Dark Lord. I managed some Maggi, rice, and later some vegetable and chicken for their harsh fur. All orcs except from one village can withstand sunlight, but gets sunburnt sometimes, as in cooked crisp, kind of way, so the orc farmers usually overdress when planting their vegetables. Rice is usually bought, too much trouble to be planted.]<br><br>[Lastly, take your time. Best wines are those that aged well.]</p>

            <p>[...are you from Malaysia, by the way? Or just using the location?]<br><br>[As to states...yeah. I mainly know Canada and America, and that&#39;s mostly because I&#39;ve lived in both.]<br><br>[Also, can I just mention how hilarious and wonderful it is that this conversation got long and detailed (and insane) so quickly? I love it.]<br><br>Ah, I see. Well, I wish you the best of luck with the education part of your campaign. Burning eyes aren&#39;t fun.<br><br>Oh, wow. Mistranslations for the win, huh? It&#39;s good press, at least. (I get the feeling that at least one agent is going to get confused and think that you actually do have fire-eyes, and then get very disappointed when they&#39;re only contacts. This is going to be Agent Dawn, isn&#39;t it...)<br><br>I&#39;m sure Agent Edgar will be overjoyed. Er, he probably won&#39;t show it too much--he tends to be rather serious. But he&#39;ll be quite pleased. He may even smile! And I&#39;ll instruct the agents to bring milk. Hopefully they can get their hands on some...<br><br>*drumroll* And now, entering through the portal...Agents Dawn, Brenda, and Edgaaaarrrr! *drumroll increases to a crescendo, and then stops. The three agents come to a halt, and exchange puzzled glances at the sudden lack of noise. Then, four mini-Balrogs bounce through the portal and send the agents tumbling to the ground*<br><br>Dawn: &quot;There&#39;s a reason I didn&#39;t go to OFUM...owie...&quot;<br><br>Anyway.<br><br>[Your wish is my command (when it comes to creating your character, that is.) The Dark Lord&#39;s lack of fluent Orcish will probably end up in the interlude, complete with some misunderstandings...probably with an agent trying to correct him/the orcs, since they&#39;ve got translators.]<br><br>[Thanks for all the details on the orc factory operation! I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll come in handy. I mean, I&#39;m not sure how much of it will make it in, but...actually, on second thought, you&#39;ve probably just provided me with the topics for most of the conversation with Agent Dawn. Cool.]<br><br>[True that. Actually, though, I can tell you exactly where I&#39;m planning on putting it: There&#39;s an introductory mission (completely fictional), #0, which may be posted out of order, so don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s just in here for accuracy. Then comes the first mission. After that are either two or three more--that is, it&#39;s supposed to be two, but a third may make it in there. Then comes the first interlude (the visit to the factory). After that come two missions (or possibly one, but I&#39;m leaning towards two), followed by the second interlude (Dawn&#39;s picnic with the minis). After that we&#39;re back to missions. Confused yet? I think I am, or at least, I would be if I didn&#39;t actually have an organized list. Basically, it goes 0, 1, 2a, 2b, [2c], Interlude: Factory, 3, 4, Interlude: Picnic, 5, 6, 7. Hm. I think I may have confused myself even more, but that&#39;s accurate...ANYWAY! The plan is to have several missions, then the first interlude, then several more missions, then the second interlude, and then more missions. Let&#39;s leave it at that. Wow.]<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>[Any questions, ask away. Any inconsistencies, point it out. I might do mistakes in the agent&#39;s character later, correct me too. Also, I completely understands how you&#39;ll arrange your fics and interludes. Rewriting on a piece of paper does wonders sometimes. So now we&#39;ll write in story mode, but I&#39;ll only mostly write my characters&#39; side of the story. You may fill in your charcters as you please. Is this OK? Also, I am a Malaysian. From the state of Sabah]<br><br>A few seconds later, the agents are already on their feet, brushing off the dust from their clothing. The mini-Balrogs quickly form ranks in front of the agents. The four of them puts up the cutest look on their faces. Two other mini-Balrogs quickly scurry forward, taking their places amongst their fellow friends.<br><br>An old orc bows before the guests. &quot;Greetings, guests. I am Doth Tarti, a manager and an orc chieftain of our establishment. And here,&quot; pointing at his fellow orcs lining up beside him,&quot; are my fellow colleagues, Gul Sharsi, Miri Sharpsi, and Ilti Sathri. Call us, Tarti, Sharsi, Sharpsi, and Sathri respectively.&quot;<br><br>Tarti then takes a few steps back, allowing a young human man with fire-red eyes, clad in a leafy-patterned gambeson and sarong, to pass through. &quot;And here is our Dark Lord, Dark Lord Aakmal.&quot; <br><br>He offers a handshake to the agents. &quot;Pleased to meet you, Agents Dawn, Brenda, and Edgar. Please, have a seat, there is a little speech to be had before the feast begins.&quot;<br><br>[-&gt;Add your agents&#39; reactions here<br>Agent Dawn calmly looks around as he is ushered to his seat, and Agent Brenda is creepily smiling, inexplicably already on her seat, while Agent Edgar purposefully walks to his seat, his ways befitting a nobleman of high rank. The mini-Balrogs quickly scurry to the agents, with a few orc maids placing them to children-sized chairs prepared for them, with fire-resistant chair coverings draped over it. An orc maid offers a pouting mini-Balrog, possibly Caradharas, a small ball of yarn, and it promptly squeezes and chews it.<br><br>The Orc chieftains returned to their seats, but didn&#39;t sit. Dark Lord Aakmal walks to the podium, checks the microphone by tapping on it, then gives the signal, that is by lifting both of his hands then gently moves them down. The Orcs in the gathering sighs in relief as they take their seats, the Orc chieftains included.<br><br>&quot;Welcome and good day to our honoured guests, Agents Dawn, Brenda and Edgar, mini-Balrogs Glorfinel, Ectheleon, Neinor, Caradharas, Gladladriel and Kelaborn, my ever-vigilant orc chieftains Doth Tarti, Gul Sharsi, Miri Sharpsi, and Ilti Sathri, and last but not least beloved orcis and orcas, as well as orcnagers and orckids. Welcome to our first ever company-slash-town yearly feast ever!&quot;<br><br>Thunderous claps by all the orcs ring through the underground hall. Dark Lord Aakmal takes a few seconds of deep breaths before continuing.<br><br>&quot;We have been working hard to improve our lot in life, knitting, looming, and even a few bits of farming here and there, with mushroom farming being our most successful food enterprise. But we hadn&#39;t had a holiday for a few years, and nerves do fry. Thus this is the efforts of your chieftains,  to offer you a bit of a day to relax from the daily stress of 8-5 jobs. So chow down, karaoke if you want, and let your kids get to see the Balrogs you&#39;ve been telling them was once real. And hug them too, if they want.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It is my sworn oath as a Dark Lord, to provide you with better living conditions, but humans have but short lifespans, and I may not be able to fulfill all your needs before I die. Hopefully, a Dark Lord from the ranks of our young orcs, with vision and fire in his or her eyes, are able to lead our future generations to greater heights of wealth, prosperity, and peace. Perhaps even a shot at living overground, free from having to shave your furs or donning ridiulous outfits.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Last but not least, let&#39;s enjoy this day, as it&#39;s the fruit of your hard work. P.S, I may make this event biannually, if this event ends without a hinch. Well, what are you waiting for?&quot;<br><br>All the orcs chuckle, as they take the plates and food from the serving table at the side of halls. The Orc chieftain respectfully points the agents to the VIP tables prepared for them, with Dark Lord Aakmal the last one to leave the stage. Before they are seated though, Dark Lord Aakmal reminds them of their tasks.<br><br>&quot;Agents, mind if you do your tasks first? The orders are in my office, Agent Edgar, I&#39;ll show you the way myself. Agent Dawn, I need yout o open a prtal to your glitter-filled room, so my orcs can work on it. Agent Brenda, you may eat first, but an orc maid will call you once the mini-Balrog hugging begins.&quot;<br><br>Meanwhile, another VIP table is filled with bacons and eggs, as the mini-Balrogs are seated there, chomping down on their food. <br><br>[I put up a bit of story to help you write. I&#39;m writing the event as how I often see the feasts and events are conducted in Malaysia; things missing are singing the national anthem and short prayer before the speech.]<br><br><br></p>

            <p>[Ok, first of all, two things. Well, probably three.]<br><br>[One: I love your description of Agent Edgar. It made me laugh. He&#39;d probably be pretty pleased about it.]<br><br>[Two: Agent Dawn, like myself, is female. Minor point, though. Well, relatively minor :)]<br><br>[Three: I love all of this, and am quite fascinated by both the detail and that this was inspired by feasts and events in Malaysia! I know pretty much nothing about Malaysia, so it&#39;s very interesting to learn.]<br><br>[Fourth (oh, look, it&#39;s four...I&#39;m turning into the Spanish Inquisition here, except that I didn&#39;t try to list them at the beginning!), do you mind if we sort of write the story back and forth and then, at the end, I&#39;ll sort of compile it and edit/rewrite bits until it&#39;s all completely coherent and awesome, and then send it to you for approval/advice/proofreading? Because this is really starting to look very, very cool. (By that--the stuff before the bit about it looking really cool--I mean that it should be cleaned up at the end, made to lack jarring shifts between our writing styles, and you make sure that Dark Lord Aakmal and the orcs are IC all the way through while I do the same for the mini-Balrogs and the agents. Bits of it could also be rewritten from different POVs, if it looks like it could work better. Basically, this would be the rough draft, and then be put together and cleaned up and added to and whatnot for the good copy.)]<br><br>[Fifth, whoops, I just checked the Permission article, and I&#39;m not actually allowed to write interludes yet (since I haven&#39;t got Permission yet)--unless you have Permission, in which case it counts as a co-write. So, unless you do have Permission, this may have to wait a bit. Bother. I forgot about this. Good thing I checked...]<br><br>[...I still can&#39;t get over that description of Agent Edgar! It&#39;s hilarious, and suits him perfectly! Also, Caradharas and the spider-silk ball...]<br><br>[...I would love to actually be at a feast where mini-Balrogs are guests of honor and have their own VIP table. That would be awesome. I mean, assuming I was used to minis, and not scared out of my wits by the fiery little demons...I suppose I should go with, I&#39;d love to see it as a movie.]<br><br>[And also, hi! Wow, there are PPCers from all over the world, aren&#39;t there? I hadn&#39;t quite realized. That&#39;s just awesome.]<br><br>[Also, I must say, I like these orcs. They&#39;re rather more civilized than I&#39;m used to, but quite fun.]<br><br>[And may I say, yet again, that I love how quickly this snowballed? Why, it seems just yesterday that I was asking you what your orcs knitted--oh, wait, that <i>was</i> yesterday.]<br><br>[Oh, and, nearly forgot: I wanted to ask, does Aakmal mean anything? If so, what? I&#39;m curious...]<br><br>[*goes back to frantically working on Permission Request, among other things*]<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>[They are more like tribal structures. What I make is they usually pick a human, dwarf, or even Bunian/elven if they are desperate, Dark Lord as their leader, since declaring on an Orcish Dark Lord, may cause scuffles, as they don&#39;t agree who is better to lead above the village chieftain level. The last time they tried an Orcish King, they had devastating wars amongst themselves a few centuries back, and funerals were still arranged for all the Orcs that died. Underground, of course.]<br><br>[Lack of Morgoth and Sauron mellowed these orcs, now they are more like Swiss peasants during the Renaissance, very tough, but prefer to keep to themselves. Also, willing to offer their sometimes-martial services for money. And Sabah has a way to make the entire population mellow out in time.]<br><br>[I did say I wasn&#39;t the First Dark Lord. There were others before me, my particular company/village&#39;s previous line of Dark Lords died heirless around 1990. So they begin to falter in self-sufficiency, especially since the last one hadn&#39;t taught the orcs how to use money well, nor planting crops. Even my character&#39;s ascension to Dark Lord isn&#39;t immediate. Had to butter up the whole village, then the orc chieftain calls his allies for support for me, once he deems me worthy. Agriculture is still a problem, but we subsist on poultry farming, mushroom cultivation, and trade, thus the knitting and looming industry.]<br><br>[As for the ceremony, it is usually used in formal situation. Since this is a company event, so it counts as semi-formal.]<br><br>[About journeys to Earendil, and playing with Morgoth, I may have to rethink about it, as it may be too Stuish for PPC&#39;s taste. Any ideas to unStu the fact may be appreciated.]<br><br>[My true name is Aakmal bin Mohd Yusop, making my character a self-insert, and Aakmal is also somewhat used, although not as regular as Muhammad (the Praiseworthy), Saifuddin (Sword of Faith), for guys, or Nur (Light), and Aisyah (Prosperous). I just hope this character will not turn into a Stu, and be as 3-D as we can make him.]</p>

            <p>...I kind of want to write an interlude (once I have Permission, of course) detailing Agents Dawn, Brenda, and Edgar going to pick up the large order discussed above. They portal into the scene you&#39;ve just described. Then, the fire-eyed man in armor spots them, and walks over, introducing himself as &#39;the Dark Lord&#39; (and getting twitches from any agents who have recently faced a particularly bad HP or LotR mission). Two orcs are then dispatched to remove (and bottle) the glitter from...Agent Dawn&#39;s RC, I suppose, having it be DawnFire&#39;s room at the Board is possibly a bit too meta. Agent Edgar, eager to get this task over with, starts ferrying packages through the portal. Agent Dawn starts talking very quickly about orcs and factories and every single possible reference that comes to her mind, while Agent Brenda pointedly ignores her and supervises the mini-Balrogs as they play with the orc-children. At some point, Edgar finishes with the packages and portals away to find some Bleeprin. Then, Caradharas the mini-Balrog gets a little too exuberant, and an orc-child starts crying. The orcs turn...not-so-friendly, and advance on the minis and Brenda, brandishing different bits of the contents of their belts in a threatening manner. Brenda decides to cut her losses, grabs the minis, and portals away. Some time later, Agent Dawn realizes that she&#39;s the only PPC agent left and reluctantly leaves, making plans for her picnic with the mini-Balrogs on their brand-new fireproof tablecloth as she goes...<br><br>Well, that&#39;s the general idea, anyway.<br><br>...yup, it&#39;ll probably happen at some point. It&#39;ll be the strangest interlude ever. I shall call it...&#39;A Visit to the Dark Lord&#39;s Factory&#39;. Or something along those lines.<br><br>(I&#39;m getting such weird ideas today. Well, more crazy than weird, I suppose. And they&#39;re fortunately less strange than the time my brain wanted there to be a romance between Agent Dawn and DawnFire the Boarder. That was a really weird one.)<br><br>I&#39;d say that I&#39;m now off to decrease my sugar intake, but I&#39;ve barely had any today...go figure.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Not an easy task. You have to entice their leader, through gifts and massages and promises. It can feel like running an election campaign, but the effort is worth it.

I made them boil their water before drinking it, made them take bathes with cheap soaps, show them a few videos on knitting, and a few years later, the chieftain begins to call me Dark Lord. They already knew knitting from their previous lord, by the way, just that they are able to make more variations, thanks to the videos I showed them.<br><br>On the colours, we choose randomly, but you can set your colours. We are running low on red, green and yellow dyes, so shipments of these are being called. Expect new ones by the next week. <br><br>Green and orange tartan?

            <p>Fable is a series of fantasy games with a very Monty Python-esque sense of humor that are equal parts actiony, suspenseful, dark and scary, and glitchy as all get-out (although to Fable 3&#39;s credit, I have yet to discover any game-breaking bugs like what I have in Fable 2.) <br><br>The series is about the Heroes of old (Heroes is capitalized because they were important figures of history and had their own guild), and how they are slowly being reborn in a somewhat hectic time for medieval/industrial Albion. Namely, the Crawler coming back to wrap the world in darkness.<br><br>As for the music box, my only explanation for how it works is that the Old Kingdom (which I assume to be the gods of the Fable-verse, as they&#39;re constantly made out that way) infused it with really powerful magic. It does, however, play a very hypnotic and somewhat creepy tune.<br><br>And that&#39;s about as far as I know about it.</p>

The Old Ones were all but wiped out in the ensuing conflict, leaving their child races to their own devices.  <br><br>The Eldar developed amazing power and technology, to the point where they could satisfy any need or desire with but a single thought.  However, they eventually fell into decadence, and debauched themselves so much that they created a new Chaos God - Slaanesh, the Prince of Excess - and tore a hole in the Materium through which energy from the Warp constantly flows.  This anomaly is known colloquially as the Eye of Terror.<br><br>The Orks, their psychic link to their progenitors severed, fell back on the activities programmed into their genes: fight and expand.  Orks are powerful Psykers, although few of them ever realize it.  Every Ork generates psychic energy independent of the Immaterium (Warp), usually called &#39;WAAAGH! Energy&#39; by members of the Ordo Xenos familiar with the aliens.  The Orks channel this energy into many things, usually without realizing it.  The more Orks are present, the more powerful the distortion of reality they cause, which can get alarmingly intense.  Give an Ork a piece of scrap metal and convince him it&#39;s a gun, and, if enough Orks are around, it WILL fire bullets.<br><br>For example: a Wartrukk with a mob of Orks in it sputters and dies. Da boyz hop out and have a look. One of da boyz examines the readouts and says to the Nob driver, &quot;Da bloody fing is outta gas!&quot; Said Nob hits the offending Ork in the face so hard that he falls unconscious. &quot;Look &#39;ere, I&#39;z da boss, and I sez I filled this fing up righ&#39; before we left!&quot; The rest of da boyz look at each other, halfway convinced. He is the biggest Ork among them, and he did just prove it. Maybe he did fill it up right before they left. That&#39;s the sort of thing one does when one&#39;s in charge. Da boyz begin to file back into the Wartrukk, and with a satisfied nod, the Nob gets in and cranks her up. Because da boyz believe that there is plenty of fuel in the truck, one drop does for ten, and the Wartrukk and da boyz arrive just in time for the next fight.<br><br>As you can see, it is the BELIEF that Ork technology functions that actually allows it to function.  This is also why Ork technology, when captured by the Imperium, invariably ceases to function (or outright explodes) when a non-Ork attempts to use it.  This perplexes members of the Adeptus Mechanicus not privy to the above information, as they believe that the Orks have simply browbeaten the Machine-Spirits of their devices into functioning.  That being the case, they reason, the devices should work far better when the Machine-Spirits are given the proper respect and veneration.  We have yet to observe an instance of this actually occurring.<br><br>                             ***<br><br>-]I[- The above information is to be regarded as <i>Classificatus Totalis</i>.

        <div class="post-body">
            <p><b>Summary</b><br><br>Since the tenth anniversary of this Board&#39;s launch is coming up, we are putting together a documentary about the history and nature of the PPC as a community. If you want to see this finished, <b>please keep reading</b> - there are <i>lots</i> of ways you can help out!<br><br><hr>
<br><br>The basic idea is to collect information from you, the people of the PPC, and collate it all into a chronological narrative. This will <b>not</b> feature any personal details about anyone - usernames only, and location mentioned only if you agree it&#39;s relevant - but will be a collection of people&#39;s thoughts, feelings and memories about this community.<br><br><u>Ways You Can Help 1: The Timeline</u><br><br>At the end of this post is a timeline of the PPC community - but it&#39;s incomplete! If you can think of anything else that ought to be on it, please, reply and tell me (or, indeed, anything that I&#39;ve got wrong, or that needs more information)! Obviously not <i>everything</i> goes on there, but as general guidance:<br><br>-If it affected the community as a whole in a new way,<br>-If a lot of people remember it (fondly or otherwise),<br>-If it&#39;s related to the <b>community</b>, not the fictional(?) world, or<br>-If it&#39;s really cool,<br><br>... then it should be on the list. For example, I&#39;ve included The Reorganisation, despite it being fiction, because it changed the way we see the history of the PPC, and is still reasonably popular. I <i>haven&#39;t</i> included me starting to write missions for DOGA, even though it was a new Department, because that&#39;s not a unique event. If we knew who the first spinoff was, <i>that</i> would go on the list, because again, it&#39;s a significant change.<br><br>And especially if you know anything <br><br><u>Ways You Can Help 2: Your Thoughts</u><br><br>My basic plan is to structure this as a series of interviews - but for that to work, I need interviewees! Therefore, you can provide:<br><br>-An interview or pseudo-interview with you about something on the timeline (you can even write your own questions, and I&#39;ll have Agent Dafydd &#39;ask&#39; you them - or, if you prefer, someone can come up with questions for you)<br>-A short piece of you talking about something on the timeline, in a format other than an interview. So if you have two minutes&#39; worth of memories of the IRC, you can just talk about them!<br><br>*Note: You do not have to have been present for the event at the date it is listed on the timeline. If you&#39;ve ever played Fill The Plothole (or seen it played), or ever used or contributed to the Wiki, you are perfectly eligable to talk about those subjects. If you want to discuss how the creation of the PPC City affected the way we see ourselves, or how the Gatherings separate us from other forums, this is also cool.<br><br>Obviously, we&#39;re aware that not everyone has access to a camera or microphone, and that not everyone wants to put their face or voice on the internet. Therefore, we&#39;ll take three levels of contribution - with the most preferred listed first, but all will be accepted.<br><br>1. A video of you saying your piece (preferably against either a PPC-appropriate or a neutral backdrop).<br>2. An audio file of you saying your piece, with an optional note on what you&#39;d like on-screen for it.<br>3. A written document of your piece, for someone else to read out.<br><br><u>Ways You Can Help 3: Behind The Scenes</u><br><br>As you might have guessed, this will need a fair amount of backstage work. I&#39;ll be doing all the editing and compiling and such, but there are literally <i>heaps</i> of ways you can contribute:<br><br>-Acting as an interviewer of people who provide interviews - that is, writing the questions for them to answer.<br>-Acting as a voice for other people&#39;s written contributions. Again, you can provide either video or audio, but we&#39;ll probably just use the audio track from any videos.<br>-Reading some piece of source material that you think needs reading out (as above, video or audio). As I recall, Cassie already volunteered to read a section of <i>Rambling Band</i>, but if you come up with something else relevant - a chatlog, or Board post? - feel free to volunteer it.<br>-Providing images for either visual aids, or people who want a drawing of themselves/their agents in place of their actual faces.<br>-... anything else! This is pretty much wide open. There will be music played, clips from videos used (maybe) - so if you think of something that would perfectly fit a certain timeline event, suggest it! Believe me, I&#39;m all ears (except literally).<br><br><b>Important Note</b><br><br>You are allowed to contribute in as many ways as you feel like it. If you want to double the length of the timeline, talk about half the items on it, interview everyone else and paint pictures to show everything - go ahead! That&#39;s awesome!<br><br>Oh, and whatever you want to do (and whatever questions you have), please mention them in this thread. It helps us keep track of everything. We&#39;ll sort out communications and file transfer once the planning is done.<br><br><hr>

            <p>I don&#39;t know if this would be helpful or not, but I know a lot about OFUs, being in the middle of writing one and having read many besides. It&#39;s the only part of the PPC-verse I&#39;m sure I know about, so yeah...I&#39;m volunteering. However, I have no recording equipment, so I could make a statement about OFUs that someone else (another OFU author, maybe) could read.

            <p>Impact? Not sure what you mean by that. I could definitely talk about the challenges of writing one and how it compares to a PPC mission, the morals (as in, they&#39;re a way to show how badfic writers can improve, rather than a way to vicariously torture Suethors), and the parodic tone and how you have to play it right (for example, you could argue that Sauron is OOC in OFUM, but Miss Cam makes it work). <br>I&#39;ll get writing.</p>

            <p>My current &#39;plan&#39; (a bit of a strong word, that) is to post again with a filled-out timeline, check if everyone&#39;s okay with what they&#39;re slotted in for, and sort out deadlines and emails then. At the moment there&#39;s some gaping gaps in the timeline, so I&#39;m still hoping for someone to turn up wanting to talk about them.

            <p>What file format would you like the audio or video to be in? Also, approximately, how &#39;loud&#39; do you want the audio to be? I know you can quiet down most audio, but it is hard to enhance sound well, and toning down too much can affect quality. Just a range around what you want would be nice.<br><br>As for the questions, do you want a specific list of the questions I am being &#39;asked,&#39; or would it be OK for me to just sort of ramble on with questions or topics as discussion starters? I am fine with drafting up some questions if you want, I just tend to ramble well, and you can usually get good sound bytes from my wild discussions with myself and the camera. I guess what I am asking is, how organized do you want me to be?<br><br>Also, I would be happy to voice act some role-plays, important posts, or just funny moments on the board. Heck, I&#39;ll even sing a few filks if you want! (you may not like what you hear though... I&#39;ll try and sing well, I swear!) <br>One post I was thinking of doing was this one: <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=235598"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=235598">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=235598</a></a><br>Why? No reason other than it&#39;s funny, and it deals with our lovely friends the spambots. To have it as a form of intro to the spambots, or more specifically the song inside the post being the intro, would be funny. Well, at least, that&#39;s my opinion. In the end, that&#39;s your decision.<br><br>If I come up with any other questions, I will make sure to ask them.</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t help much, as I don&#39;t really remember big turning points in the history of the PPC or anything like that. But I do remember when I joined the board, and that was the late summer of 2002. It was, I&#39;m 99% certain, this exact board. I can&#39;t remember exactly how I found it, but if OFUM launched in August of &#39;02 is was possibly through that, or through reviews I read on other people&#39;s fics on ff.net. I lurked for maybe a couple months before I started posting, but that was definitely no later than autumn of &#39;02. I don&#39;t remember anything about this relaunch of &#39;03. I think old age is catching up with me.</p>

            <p>You may be wrong, or you may very well be right. It&#39;s entirely possible there was some massive relaunch of the board while I was here, and I&#39;ve just completely forgotten about it. Like I said, I&#39;m 99% sure this is exactly the same board as the one I joined back in &#39;02, but that doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t relaunched at some point in the same style. I&#39;ll have to think harder, and see if I can&#39;t remember.<br><br>I was in the chatroom all the time at one point. I remember some delightful roleplays, particularly one involving Morgoth? There was one hilarious one with the sons of Elrond, Aragorn and Legolas that I printed out. If only I knew what I did with it! I would guess it took place in 2004.<br><br>I remember Fill The Plothole vaguely, but I don&#39;t remember actually participating in it - though of course that doesn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t remember the Shipfests at all until I thought for a minute, and NOW, yes, I remember. If it&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking it is. For example, I believe there was a very provocative story entitled something like &#39;Huinesoron&#39;s Very Odd Day&#39;?<br><br>If I was behind the first one, oh dear.

Flying glomps and general hyperness were what I had in mind under &quot;otherwise annoy&quot;, I never meant to imply you weren&#39;t nice. Brief hugs are fine, flying glomps are not. Except, possibly, if you&#39;re Elros or Elrond and the Feanorian in question is Maglor. It did say a great love grew between them, so glomps may be forgiveable :)</p>

            <p>Bit of a late response, but I&#39;m happy to do anything that involves writing--as in, I&#39;d rather not do audio or video, but I&#39;m happy to answer questions or write things down or whatever.<br><br>Actually, something I could do that could be interesting (I think) to see in a documentary like this--well, I&#39;ll explain.<br><br>I feel that I owe a lot to the PPC. This is something I&#39;ve said before, but it&#39;s true; I really do owe so much of what I know about writing interesting, relatable characters and plots to the PPC (and to OFUM and various MSTs, and Deleterius--basically, I owe a lot to the Canon Protection Initiative in general, and that&#39;s something I can talk about). I can also talk about what it&#39;s like to have found the PPC so long ago (ok, about 4 or 5 years ago, but I&#39;ve come a long way since then) and what it&#39;s like to see it still going so strong. Not sure if that&#39;s exactly what you want for this documentary, but it could be interesting to talk about the PPC&#39;s influence on young writers, and on people&#39;s lives in general.<br><br>And, of course, if that doesn&#39;t fit into this documentary&#39;s theme, I&#39;m happy to answer questions someone writes for me.<br><br>Side point: I have a question/clarification for you, hS, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve seen it. It&#39;s actually at the very bottom of the page right now, so I thought I&#39;d better draw your attention to it before it disappears to the previous page, since I really would like an answer.

            <p>It&#39;s absolutely fine for you to write something for someone else to read - I knew going in that there&#39;d be people unwilling/able to record anything. And someone to talk about the impact of the PPC/CPI on young writers would be fantastic - it seems like something that would go either at the beginning or the very end, since it doesn&#39;t have a neat slot in the timeline.<br><br>Probably the latter, in fact. I&#39;ve mentioned a couple of times the three questions I&#39;d like to ask everyone (How&#39;d you get here, why&#39;d you stay, and what&#39;s changed), and your suggestion would make a nice closer for that.<br><br>(And I... well, &#39;answered&#39; may be a little bit strong to describe what I did to your question)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...which was when it had two replies...yeah, it&#39;s a bit late :)<br><br>Oh, good. I mean, I like reading stuff aloud, I&#39;m just a little iffy about putting it out on the internet, and I also technically just have the microphone in my laptop for recording equipment, so it&#39;s doubtful that anything I recorded would be all that clear anyway.<br><br>Really? Cool :) And trust me, I can go on for a while. Or for a slightly shorter while, if that&#39;s what&#39;s necessary. But basically, I&#39;m pretty sure I found the PPC at a time when I was at the tail end of growing out of being a mild Suethor (I know, horrifying--you should see some of the chats I unearthed recently), and I really do think it helped me grow as a writer. And, of course, it entertained me immensely, so that was a bonus. I can also talk about what led me to actually say hello on the Board, and about what&#39;s changed between my initial encounters with the CPI/PPC and now--there was a year or two where the most contact I had with the CPI in general was using Mary-Sue Litmus Tests and reading the occasional related article. Whatever works; I like to talk, and I like to write, and in this case, they go together.<br><br>(Well, my brain has...er, responded is a bit too mild a word. Actually, I have written a response to your answer {which I was very pleased--and excited--to get}; it should be posted as soon as I get a chance to proofread it. I do hope you know what you&#39;ve started; my brain took the idea and ran away with it, cackling madly, and in the next hour I ended up with about 1,000 words worth of ideas. My ideas keep snowballing lately...Then again, for the most part, that&#39;s a good thing.)<br><br>(My planned interludes just get crazier and crazier...oh, well. Hopefully that means they&#39;ll be fun to read. If nothing else, they&#39;ll be fun to write.)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>At the moment it&#39;s looking like there&#39;ll be a handful of questions for everyone to answer (How did you find the PPC? Why did you decide to stay?

            <p>There&#39;s obviously a fair few things on there you have to have experienced (the Gatherings, the Badfic Contest), but there&#39;s also loads you can talk about even if you&#39;ve only run into them since.

            <p>You seem to be exited for this project, and seem to have really thought it out. I cannot provide much information for you, however, I would be happy to provide readings of either others questions/answers, and anything else that you could need read. I am interested in acting or voice acting as a potential career (though likely just a hobby), and am currently trying to expand my speaking range and quality, so I would be more than happy to assist in this department.<br><br>I can only think of a couple little things that could be added. One is a section on our little quirks, such as gift giving to new members and the random role plays we do. I know this is a &#39;personal&#39; story, but the PPC has so many little nuances to it, that there should be a specific time slot dedicated to it. <br><br>Another is having little interludes from the fictional world. When the person speaks, he/she could have their agents come in and say some things about their creator, only to be neralized of the fact they have a creator at the end. I just think having little moments that have to do with the in-univerce PPC would be nice, and funny of corse. Hey, how about have the Sunflower Official do the narration in-between moments from the community. I, being male, would be more than happy to provide the voice for our supreme overlo-I mean, generous Official.<br><br>I don&#39;t know what else to say, other than if you could get Jay and Acacia, Miss Cam, and other founding members to provide some of their thoughts, that would be awesome. Don&#39;t know how one would get in contact with them though...<br><br>Good luck with the documentary!</p>

            <p>1/ The little quirks: my original thoughts on this, though I managed to lose them somewhere in between, was that we could have a handful of people talking about how they found the PPC, what happened when they joined, etc, in the appropriate slot in the timeline. You could volunteer for that! The roleplays and other games are mostly mentioned by name on one of their early appearances (Fill the Plothole, Things I Am Not Allowed To Do, the Snowfight and Fifth Anniversary, the Mary-Sue Invasion...)<br><br>2/ Well, the narration is being done by Agent Dafydd, because <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmAwk1CkaMM">he&#39;s had practice</a>, and I&#39;m planning on trying to interview the team at <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Radio_Nutmeg">Radio Nutmeg</a> (which should be on the timeline for September 2008). And of course if anyone wants to do something tie-in-y in the film, they&#39;re more than welcome.<br><br>3/ I will be trying to hunt down a bunch of oldbies. First, though, I need to know there&#39;ll be enough to build on... hintsubtlehint...<br><br>hS</p>

After reading through the wiki page about six times, I believe I have all the required paperwork right here:<br><br>Agent Bios, department and links to the badfic that will be my first mission: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1POWHiBWoPvBN6etmqeyyZ-6sBvOKa8zH4fn_Mm3FCBY/edit?usp=sharing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1POWHiBWoPvBN6etmqeyyZ-6sBvOKa8zH4fn_Mm3FCBY/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1POWHiBWoPvBN6etmqeyyZ-6sBvOKa8zH4fn_Mm3FCBY/edit?usp=sharing</a></a><br><br>Permission Piece: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/190WxiVaZ5m3ONRzN3TQGff7KpUPeUWYl0Y87oH7Zqwk/edit?usp=sharing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/190WxiVaZ5m3ONRzN3TQGff7KpUPeUWYl0Y87oH7Zqwk/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/190WxiVaZ5m3ONRzN3TQGff7KpUPeUWYl0Y87oH7Zqwk/edit?usp=sharing</a></a><br><br>Hopefully everything is in order, and any questions or concerns the community may have are ready to be addressed.

            <p>First off, apologies for the inexcusably long wait - I&#39;ve been meaning to get back to you for a while, but life is sort of hectic at the moment.<br><br>You&#39;ve been around the &#39;Board for a while, contributed to discussions, not been a flaming jerk, generally been a literate and friendly person - that&#39;s a check. The agents are plausible and interesting, and you responded positively to concrit - check and check. Your badfic&#39;s been deleted, so I can&#39;t quite check that one off - definitely make sure you clear the &#39;fic you decide on with someone before you go ahead with the mission.<br><br>Your sample is a bit of a dilemma - not necessarily because it&#39;s bad, but because it doesn&#39;t really show off a sense of humor. We&#39;ve given people holds on Permission for overuse of Grimdark before, but this isn&#39;t that - it&#39;s just a very matter-of-fact piece, without a lot of character interaction or dialogue. I don&#39;t want to say no, because there&#39;s definitely nothing <i>wrong</i> with your piece, but I have trouble saying yes without seeing anything more dynamic than a myth. You said you&#39;d started your first mission - would you mind e-mailing me what you&#39;ve got so far? Even if it&#39;s not perfect, since you probably haven&#39;t beta&#39;d it yet - I&#39;d just like to go over it and see how you do humor and dialogue.<br><br>(Other PGs: does this sound alright? Am I overreacting, do you have comments/concerns/better ideas?)</p>

            <p>The piece is pretty well written, with no obvious SPG mistakes, and fits very nicely into the genre it was written for. I particularly liked the million years/day use and subversion at various points.<br><br>But... it doesn&#39;t really demonstrate how World-Jumper writes <i>outside</i> that genre. For instance, the list of weapons: that&#39;s fine for mythology (and has ancient precedent), but would be extremely bad writing if done in a mission, or indeed most other contexts.<br><br>The other thing, which is sort of the same thing, is the brief glimpses of the gods-as-people we see. They&#39;re pretty darn flat - War is pure violent evil, to take the most developed example. Which... again, is fine and actually the best thing for pseudo-mythology, but in a mission...<br><br>As I see it, a Permission Piece is asked for so we can check three things:<br><br>-Can you spell &amp; grammatise? Yes, you can.<br>-Can you describe things without being urple? While the description here is obviously tweaked to the genre, I think this is a yes too. Actually in some places it was <i>too normal</i> for the pseudomyth - &#39;an extremely muscular build&#39; snagged my brain as something from a story, not a myth (which are more of the &#39;strong enough to break an ox&#39; mould). But in general, yes.<br>-Can you write characters without them being Suvian? Well... I can&#39;t tell. Your bios don&#39;t scream &#39;Stu!&#39; - although I note we have another &#39;shy friendly type&#39;, which I&#39;ve never understood :P - and look as if you&#39;ve set up at least two sources of humourous conflict (shy/sociable, and fanboy/pony). But there&#39;s no <i>positive</i> evidence either.<br><br>Additionally, there is a fourth &#39;bonus point&#39;, which can often sit in for some of the others:<br>-Can you write well? This is about flow, style and so forth. And again... I can&#39;t tell. I can tell you can write <i>myth</i> well, which is brilliant if you decide to add to the <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/MythTitle.htm">Myths of the PPC</a>... but is that because you chose a subject that fits your only style, or because you tuned your style to fit your subject? I&#39;m assuming the latter - but it&#39;s honestly impossible to tell.<br><br>In conclusion: I think that once you show either VM-by-email or us-by-Board a sample of character-centred writing, you&#39;ll get a very quick decision. I&#39;m assuming it&#39;ll be a Yes - but I can&#39;t say for sure.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Sorry for the wait, but I had to get the pieces, then I had to go to school, then...<br><br>Anyway, I decided to upload them to G-Docs again, it is part of the permission piece link. Yes it is labeled myth on the doc. Who cares. It is the meeting of the agents in HQ. While I did have part of the mission done somewhere, I cannot seem to find it. Oh well.<br><br>As for your points, I completely understand, and that is why I am not truly upset. I&#39;m just a little disappointed, and honestly part of me is telling the rest of me &quot;I told you so!&quot; It is a funny feeling to rub the fact in my own face. I only write urple when the situation calls for it, such as the agents finding a powerful stu item. (I was going to use this in my first mission actually, which it turns out I might still be able to use. I&#39;ll tell you why later.) Otherwise, I prefer to describe actions and the important setting. <br><br>The reason for this is because I come from a storyteller&#39;s mindset, meaning my priorities when writing and others priorities may be different. That is why I do myths well, because I usually write what I would be willing to say if I were a storyteller of old, though I can write in other styles. The storyteller mindset does help cut down description without being bland though. <br><br>Anyway, do keep in mind this is not quite finished. It has gone though one round of editing, and might need more. This just shows, hopefully, that I can write for the PPC.</p>

            <p>Silly Hermione, you can&#39;t steal anything from Pinkie. She&#39;ll just come over with her property through the plotholes and the breaking of the fourth wall.

Though, I expected it to be made of wood, like a wooden board, though I guess this is a posting board, so perhaps it should be made out of Post Its! Hey, that sounds like fun!

I don&#39;t know if I can do the one I selected, you know, because it&#39;s deleted, but I have a list of other fics I can choose from. I think I have one I could use as a replacement, but I&#39;ll give it a few more days before I crank out the mission.

            <p>Interestingly, they tie in to my two unanswered points:<br><br>-<i>&quot;He had hoped he could reason with the oversized daisy, but it refused to listen to logic. ‘Just goes to show you’, he thought as he walked in the general direction of Bad Slash, ‘you can’t reason with a Flower’. Marvin wandered HQ, not paying much attention to anything, even his destination. If he wandered across HQ, what did he care?&quot;</i><br><br>That&#39;s two &#39;reason with&#39;s and two &#39;wandered [...] HQ&#39; in the same paragraph. There&#39;s another &#39;wandering&#39; a couple of paragraphs later, too. Obviously I&#39;m not suggesting wild thesaurus abuse, but a little variety goes a long way.<br><br>--Actually, as a note to the above: wandering HQ without caring where he was going would <i>probably</i> have taken him straight to his RC. It&#39;s not necessarily wrong (and you do throw out a &#39;perhaps it was HQ&#39;s strange architecture&#39;), but it raised at least part of an eyebrow.<br><br>-Printworthy seems a bit too accepting of... well, a fair few things. &#39;Oh, a human - I thought they were a myth. Cool&#39;. Um, if I ran into a centaur or something, I&#39;d be rather more flustered about it. Of course, this may be the sort of reaction you&#39;d expect - I&#39;unno the canon.<br><br>More key, I think, is that little conversation about plotholes:<br><br><i>&quot;Sounds to me like you fell through a plothole. They appear when something that should not be able to happen does, without any explanation. You must have stumbled across one and came here.” [This is fine. Fairly standard blase PPC reaction. &#39;Oh, yeah, she&#39;s your evil doppleganger and you&#39;re a character in a story. Surely this is obvious?&#39;]<br><br>“A plot hole? That’s a storytelling mishap, they’re not real.” [This is... okay. That &#39;they&#39;re not real&#39; feels a little too accepting to me. Printworthy appears to be assuming Marvin&#39;s made a silly mistake, rather than - more logically - that he&#39;s stark raving bonkers]<br><br>“Oh, don’t they? Plotholes, the Narrative Laws, and the Ironic Overpower all don’t exist?” [This line feels pretty stilted. Neither of the latter two had come up. I&#39;d probably have something like &quot;Oh, don&#39;t they? Seems to me like you just fell through a plothole because the Ironic Overpower decreed it, and landed on <i>me</i> of all people through the Laws of Narrative Comedy...&quot;, which slots back into the blase PPC approach, with a hint of irritation at not being believed, and still gets everything across. Obviously that&#39;s an Agent Dafydd line, not a Marvin line, but you get the point]<br><br>“Now hold on! You speak as if literary laws affect reality, and that ponies, or humans, are governed by them, like mere characters in a book!” [Which is actually a pretty good response - but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a response to the previous line. :P Still, it&#39;s the sort of reaction I&#39;d expect]</i><br><br>This overflows a little into the following section - one mention of badfic, and Printworthy instantly believes everything Marvin&#39;s saying.<br><br>But - and it&#39;s a big but - as you&#39;ve said, this isn&#39;t a finished piece. Those two are the sort of thing I&#39;d flag up if I were betaing your story (and would get extremely frustrated if you kept on doing the same thing story after story, just changing the specific examples I cited to my specific example alternatives... sorry, got distracted there, not talking about you. Remember, girls and boys, betas are there to help you improve, not to do your work for you). They&#39;re certainly something to watch out for, but if you <i>do</i> keep an eye on them (see what I did there, avoiding repeating &#39;watch out for&#39;?), they&#39;re not a problem.<br><br>As a general commentary: your description is good, and (usually) not stilted, you have some genuinely funny moments (yes, Marvin, drop a Star Wars reference on the innocent horsey-thing...), and with a few exceptions your dialogue works nicely. So unless VixenMage or someone else comes by with a powerful argument against, I&#39;m going to say Permission Granted. Here is your official nothing, keep it safe, we are not made of nothing.<br><br>hS writes too much</p>

            <p>I understand the points you have, I spotted a few of them upon a later review, and am currently working to fix up the problems you pointed out. Still, seeing as it is an early draft, it is understandable why it has some problems. I will be sure to break out the old thesaurus to add a little variety.<br><br>The thing about Marvin passing the RC; he actually did pass it. Five times at least. Remember, he did not care about where he was going so much, he decided to continue walking, despite arriving at his supposed destination. Hmmm, perhaps I could mention that fact somehow... Actually, I should have at some point an interlude with Marvin&#39;s original partner from Bad Slash finding him and giving him a piece of her mind. I don&#39;t know anything about her beyond her gender at the moment, but at some point...<br><br>Yes, Printworthy is a little accepting of everything, but I think I will work it out so that he is either really, really freaking out, or that he had seen so much weirdness in his time, he&#39;s just come to accept a lot of things. I&#39;m working on it, as I said.<br><br>He does not necessarily believe everything Marvin says once he says badfic is real, per-se, more he is intrigued with either how this new world works, or seeing how a human who has completely lost his marbles works. Eventually, when he meets his first Flower (which will probably never be seen, sadly) he will totally, completely believe. As I said before, and this time it will be the last, I am working on it.<br><br>Now that we are done with that... WOO HOO! Thank you for the permission, I will be sure to use it wisely. I won&#39;t let you down.</p>

Gah!<br><br>While I do have the stories saved (thank goodness), if it turns out he deleted them because he saw that they were bad, I think I&#39;ll find a different badfic. Not that that would be hard per-se, but... It was really bad, in a simple way that was PERFECT for a first mission. The Stus were not so mind-numbingly bad that they would drive the agents insane, yet still clearly Stus, it had terrible grammar, dumb dialogue, and it had a Stu item for the agents to loot. I even started writing the mission! I guess we will see what happens but... *sigh* Why did the author have to wise up NOW of all times?</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m most definitely not a PG, but I like it! Your writing sample was most absorbing, and full of interesting ideas (and did I catch a PTerry reference with Death&#39;s scythe?) I just want to point out two typos that I found:<br><br>In the agent bios, Marvin should get &#39;winded&#39; rather than &#39;wended&#39;. In the writing sample, there&#39;s this: <i>Chaos continued pulling itself through the small hole in the wall of the world. Slowly, yet <b>surly</b>, it would reach though, the beings inside unable to stop its arrival, unable to stop the destruction of their home.</i> &#39;Surly&#39; should be &#39;surely&#39;.<br><br>Other than that, it looks great! Well done! Hopefully we&#39;ll be seeing missions from you soon.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll fix them in just a moment. No, it was not a specific Discworld reference, as I wrote it before I even knew what Discworld was. Still, they are similar, and Irish Samurai pointed out the similarity as well. I&#39;m glad you like the piece, and I hope I get the permission.</p>

            <p>Fandoms, that is. Discworld and Artemis Fowl, to be precise. I did read Redwall, but it was a while ago, and I don&#39;t think I got very far into it. What I remember of it is good, though, and quite imaginative.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Thank you for the Atlantean sponge packets! This will go to good use. Also, I have a question. Does Sue glitter latch on to a host, and alter the hosts DNA, make the host phyically change with each cell division? Also, if my theory is correct, would the the acceleration of cell division nessecary to cause rapid biological change consume all the fat deposits in an attemp to sustain said change? This would explain the thinnes of Sues. (No, I do not have a sibling named Physics, that was my grandsire.)</p>

            <p>S&#39;not what I meant. What I mean is, I can&#39;t find any mission reports, or a mini-listing on the wiki&#39;s Mini page, or a mention of an OFU, so I can&#39;t figure out where the mini-Nick Furys came from.

            <p>Agony indeed. I&#39;d be completely happy about it if there hadn&#39;t been a parody I wanted to read posted there (and linked on the Board).<br><br>Another strange thing my browsers do (just Google Chrome for this one) is to display a page with the title &#39;Internal Server Error&#39;, sometimes with the number 500 attached, whenever I try to get to the part of the Board that shows all the threads. It never works! I&#39;ve tried clicking on &#39;Return to Messages&#39;, I&#39;ve tried putting in the url, I&#39;ve tried following a link from the wiki--no difference. Fortunately, Internet Explorer doesn&#39;t have that problem. And Google Chrome does show the messages themselves and the reply boxes, so that&#39;s all right.<br><br>Well, yes, I suppose he would. Although I am still getting used to people being minis--I&#39;m used to mini-Balrogs and mini-Aragogs. Although now I&#39;m picturing a miniature Nick Fury ordering around a group of mini-Balrogs...<br><br>Ok, now I kind of want to write that OFU. Well, almost. It would be extremely hectic, though. And I probably wouldn&#39;t be able to resist bringing Jim Kirk from the 2009 movie in for a visit, since I&#39;ve thought it would be hilarious to see how he fits in with the group for quite some time now.<br><br>I&#39;d probably need a co-writer, though--not sure I have enough time or attention span to keep it going on my own. I&#39;ve also seen a lot of the fanon version recently, so someone who has more of a handle on the actual characters would be helpful in catching mistakes.<br><br>(Add Loki to the mix, and we&#39;ve got students chasing illusions and running into walls and getting trapped in rooms. And can you imagine the stampeding? This isn&#39;t a fandom with just one or two attractive characters. No, this is a fandom where practically <i>everyone</i> is widely considered to be quite attractive. This could be disastrous.)<br><br>(...which would make it awesome. Oh no, I think I&#39;m roping myself into actually writing this...or at least, into thinking about it...)<br><br>But hold on a minute, I actually remember there being a PPC&#39;d fic! It dealt with Thor, Loki, and a half-frost-giant Sue. Now who did it, and why isn&#39;t it listed? I feel like Mittens and the RMC were involved...or not, apparently, it&#39;s not listed there. This is very strange. I can&#39;t find it anywhere, not even in my browsing history! Help? I remember it very clearly, but I don&#39;t remember the title or the agents...<br><br>Alright. I&#39;m setting myself a limit here, SC, and you&#39;re my witness: I am not going to write an OFU for the Avengersverse unless I have a cowriter. Possibly two co-writers. To do otherwise would be bad, because it wouldn&#39;t be fair to the OFU and it wouldn&#39;t be fair to every single other writing project I have, and the OFU would end up being abandoned, most likely. So no writing an OFU without a co-writer. (And now I suppose we sign it and seal it. Or, we would, if this wasn&#39;t on the internet. But seriously, someone has to make me keep this promise. Even if it&#39;s just me. So this is here as a reminder, because my brain is trying to think up ideas for the OFU, and the last time this happened I ended up with six agents and over 50 pages of notes, rambling, brainstorming, and backstory. So, you see, this is a promise that I have to keep, before the inklings of ideas snowball.)<br><br>Although, let&#39;s put it out there--if someone wants to co-write an Avengers OFU with me, I&#39;m game! (I think...)<br><br>And I really wish I could find that mission.<br><br>(Sorry for the rambling! I may have mentioned once, I&#39;m the Queen of Babbling. And if I didn&#39;t, I probably should have.)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Awesome! Should be full of craziness. I&#39;ll be sure to let you know! (Craziness indeed. After the first planning session...well, let&#39;s just say, we&#39;re planning for quite a lot of guest stars. And hilarity. It&#39;s wonderful.)<br><br>Avengers is, technically, just the movie. However, most of the individual characters--that is, the superheroes--have their own movies leading up to this one, which is where they all come together. It is possible to watch The Avengers without having seen these other movies--I did it, for example--but there are occasional references to their backstories, which are in these movies:<br>Iron Man<br>Iron Man 2<br>Thor<br>Captain America: The First Avenger<br>and, technically, The Incredible Hulk, but that&#39;s a different actor. It is briefly referenced, though.<br>Hawkeye and Black Widow unfortunately lack their own movies right now, but they do appear in Thor and Iron Man 2.<br><br>Of course, you don&#39;t <i>have</i> to watch these other movies; you can, I think, get quite a good sense of what&#39;s going on from The Avengers (and it&#39;s done by Joss Whedon, so it&#39;s pretty darn good). Of course, it may then inspire you to see the others...at least, that&#39;s what happened to me, although that tends to happen (see my experiences with: X-Men, Star Trek, probably Doctor Who as well...)<br><br>As for what to expect from The Avengers: It&#39;s an action film directed by Joss Whedon, so, uh...excitement and fighting and explosions. Quite showy, and very visually attractive (unless you hate fight scenes and/or explosions, of course). However, it&#39;s not only a movie about a team of superheroes fighting a villain to save the earth--it&#39;s also a movie about six people, some of them civilians, all of them with some sort of baggage, all trying to work together to save the world from a powerful and wily Asgardian with his own emotional baggage. In other words--character development. Quite a bit of it, actually. Also, uh, they don&#39;t really get along for a good deal of the movie. So expect tension and some funny jibes and--you guessed it--character development.<br><br>In other words, a pretty much perfect movie, in my opinion. Exciting, dramatic, and with actual, human (and not-so-human) characters who carry the movie with, well, their characters. Also, really great acting :) You may not know all the names, but the main six are Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johannson, and Mark Ruffalo, and the supporting cast includes Gwyneth Paltrow and Samuel Jackson (among many other amazing actors). So basically...you&#39;ll probably enjoy it, at the very least.<br><br>(And while all the movies together are the fandom, if you just want to get a general idea of what it&#39;s about, you can try just watching The Avengers. You just won&#39;t know a lot of backstory).<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>That sounds great!<br><br>And look, I didn&#39;t even have to make a separate post!<br><br>Gmail it is! I know Drive from when it was Docs, so unless it&#39;s changed a lot, we shouldn&#39;t have any problems.<br><br>A word of warning, though (warning? I suppose it&#39;s a warning. Hm): there are probably going to be times when I&#39;m extremely involved in other writing projects, or in schoolwork (although that one won&#39;t start up again until September). That&#39;s why I was thinking of advertising for two co-writers. So, if you don&#39;t mind dealing with my occasional absence/unavailability for more than a few minutes, that&#39;s awesome, and let&#39;s start writing! If you do mind, then we should probably find a third co-writer, and write the story so that my representative occasionally retreats into seclusion to write books and leaves the other two to pick up the slack (or something like that).<br><br>Alternatively, we can just start writing and see if it becomes an issue. If it does, we can get a third co-writer, and my in-fic representation can go into seclusion until I&#39;m available again, and then all three can be there. Or something.<br><br>Either way, I am insane (for taking on another project, but it&#39;s ok), and this is exciting. Also, nice to meet you! I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever really exchanged more than one or two words before. Were you the one who joined the PPC a while ago, and then recently returned, or have I got you confused with someone else? (The recent flood of newbies has unfortunately made it a little hard to keep track. On the other hand, yay newbies! I&#39;m one myself, sort of).<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Haha, Gmail it be! I did indeed join the PPC a while ago, fall  away, and recently return, for which I feel bad - about the falling away, not the returning, that&#39;s awesome.<br><br>So! OFU! Since you came up with the idea, I&#39;m going to assume you&#39;re in charge. I wouldn&#39;t mind writing right away - or at least, planning things right away, planning things out in advance is good - so why don&#39;t we start with that and see how getting a third writer goes? I&#39;ve got an OFU of my own going, but my beta&#39;s got a lot on her plate, so it hasn&#39;t updated in forever...&gt;.&gt;...and I&#39;d like to at least avoid the stumbles I&#39;ve had there, with a lack of communication resulting in me being unable to get any writing done because we&#39;ve been planning our chapters literally as we get to them. Do you want my personal gmail, or would you rather work via my secondary gmail, which is in my author insert name (the same name I&#39;m using for the &quot;Author&quot; box here, incidentally).<br><br>Also, nice to meet you too! ^_^ Cookie?</p>

            <p>The deal is struck! Er, that is--uh...<br><br>Gmail &#39;tis. Oh, good, I have your backstory recorded correctly in my memory--ok, can I start that sentence again? I think I&#39;ve been working on fleshing out agents too much recently. Oh, good, I have your story straight (that&#39;s not as bad...). And returning is definitely awesome :) My own story, if you&#39;re curious, is that I discovered the PPC (and the OFUs, and the MSTs, and the lj groups--ok, you get the idea) about 4 or 5 years ago, but was only ever really involved in Deleterius, and that was just commenting (and, once drawing attention to a Suefic. Which I&#39;m now planning on eventually PPCing. Funny how that goes...). Recently, in a fit of nostalgia, I looked up the Original Series and OFUM, reread them, and then noticed that the Board was still active, whereupon I gathered my courage and said hi, and it&#39;s snowballed from there.<br><br>I&#39;minchargeofanOFU--ok, deep breaths. Alright. I&#39;m in charge of an OFU. I can do that. I agree--we should probably start with planning things out (so that we have at least a general structure of who teaches what, what we&#39;re calling this OFU, where it is...that sort of thing), and start writing whenever something comes to mind. Or, alternatively, we can plan out chapters...or do both...well, we&#39;ll discuss this and figure out what works. But yes, let&#39;s start planning/writing and see if a) we end up feeling we need a third writer, and b) someone volunteers without us advertising.<br><br>Ooh, which OFU? This is good, you&#39;ve got experience! Me, I&#39;ve only read OFUs (and the wiki page on them). This is working out great! I&#39;m so glad you returned to the PPC :) (even if my brain <i>is</i> starting to sing &quot;Hello, Dolly&quot; in my head now). And in that light, yes, we probably should have a general chapter outline, so that if one of us gets busy with RL the other can at least write a few scenes and later send them for approval. As to which gmail account--well, considering I prefer not to give out my personal gmail account to people who I don&#39;t know in RL, it would be a bit hypocritical of me to ask you for yours (unless you&#39;re more comfortable with that, in which case, that&#39;s your decision). And on that note, I&#39;m <a href="mailto:dawnfire360@gmail.com">dawnfire360@gmail.com</a>, created just for this :D<br><br>Cookie! Yes, please. Wow, I like you already :) Swiss Bleepolate? Er, actually, Swiss chocolate? Unless you&#39;ve been reading badfics recently, in which case, the first option is still open...<br><br>(But really, what are we going to call this? The most workable idea I&#39;ve managed to come up with so far is OFUS--OFU of Superheroes, which is problematic when you consider how many other superheroes there are. Hm, NYOFU, maybe? Not sure. Any ideas?)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>I think we&#39;ll need them for the planning sessions to come XD<br><br>Let&#39;s start with the OFU I&#39;m running. It&#39;s the Official Fanfiction University of Avatar: The Last Airbender, or OFUA:TLA for short, and I will not include a link, because the earlier chapters are crap and I&#39;m working on rewriting them while my beta Caelum (a former PPCer) is busy. Maybe later. Or you might just google it and find it that way, eh.<br><br>Now, as for an OFU name, it&#39;s not a requirement that it have &quot;OFU&quot; in it. There&#39;s the International Academy of Hetalia Fanfiction, IAHF, for one example. If you really want my input, we could just have a long talk over gmail chat sometime soon-ish?<br><br>By the way, I&#39;ll take the Swiss Bleepolate. I&#39;ve been looking over the badfic I want to tackle for my first mission, and... *shivers*<br><br>As for actual planning, let&#39;s leave that for gmail, ne?<br><br>I shall email you post-haste!</p>

            <p>That was a good planning session, don&#39;tcha think? So many wonderful ideas, so many cookies eaten...Mellon-nin, I think this is the start of a hilarious partnership.<br><br>Ooh, fun. I can&#39;t say I know anything about A:TLA (beyond a name or two and a tiny bit of the general concept), but...it&#39;s possible I may google it anyway :)<br><br>True, true. And that&#39;s now been resolved, so no matter.<br><br>Oh, dear. *Hands over two large bars of Swiss Bleepolate* May the details soon be dulled from your memory. Also, my sympathies. I find it helps to note down charges and reactions while reading--it&#39;s somewhat cathartic, and also helps guage how mission-worthy the badfic is. (Unfortunately, there are one or two badfics where even that doesn&#39;t help--for me, there&#39;s a horrible Star Trek songfic. It has random crossovers, can&#39;t decide if it&#39;s AOS or TOS, and absolutely EVERYONE is painfully OOC. Especially Spock. In one chapter, well...there&#39;s a scene that would work perfectly <i>if</i> it was done on <i>Glee</i>. I swear, she wrote a scene with the Warblers and wrote in Star Trek names. There was even a bow-tie. Fortunately, I&#39;m pretty sure I have yet to spot any OCs, but they may be there...Anyway, that one&#39;s making me run away screaming for goodfic. *shudders* It&#39;s awful. I&#39;m also probably going to take it on at some point, because it actually works quite well to lead into something I want to do, and also because it really, really needs to be PPC&#39;d. And, unless I&#39;m much mistaken, it could make a pretty good mission--although, it would work better if the agents sent into it have been given it as a punishment. We&#39;ll see, I guess.)<br><br>Hurray for planning! I love what we have so far :) Can&#39;t wait to plan more!<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>o.O That Star Trek fic sounds horrendous. <br><br>Haha A:TLA is a really fun show.

            <p>It <i>is</i>. I hated it. And then it brought in random Star Wars crossovers and I can&#39;t even. And it takes plots from other places for songs from those other places sometimes--like, there&#39;s a song from The Lion King 2, which I happen to <i>like</i>, only it&#39;s Vulcans and Uhura instead of lions and...Kiara, I think her name is? Simba&#39;s daughter. And--and they do Les Mis, with a TOS character singing Eponine&#39;s part. And I can&#39;t even. It&#39;s awful. It needs to go down. And, fortunately, it can serve the double purpose of being a hilarious mission (for the readers) and of giving me the plot device to inroduce some characters that I want to bring in (from a Star Trek fic I&#39;m writing. Actually, from <i>the</i> Star Trek fic I&#39;m writing, there&#39;s only the one.). Should be fun.<br><br>And, of course, there&#39;s another horrendous fic, but I don&#39;t want to get into another rant (even though I just read through two more chapters of it), so I won&#39;t go into it beyond LotR/Narnia, Elf!Ranger!Sue, Stupid!Actinglikeamoderndayhumanteenager!Legolas, and the assumption that medieval times=Middle-earth when it comes to Elves (and Rangers). It&#39;s annoying, stupid, and doesn&#39;t do good things for my happiness, but will make a splendid and most cathartic mission, so I&#39;m willing to suffer through actually reading it.<br><br>One of the people who I follow on Tumblr once posted something about where each Bender&#39;s style of fighting was taken from. It was interesting. I can see why people like it (or at least, I can guess). Really? That&#39;s pretty cool! And I&#39;m sure you did well :) And even if you didn&#39;t do as well as you could have--well, I&#39;ll <s>quote</s> paraphrase Huinesoron (actually, Agent Lou) at you, and say, you can always write it better.<br><br>:D More planning is a good thing. I just want to relax and watch a movie for a bit right now, but...a bit later?<br><br>Also, could you do me a quick favor and take a look at my permission request? Only if you want to, of course. I just really, really want to be able to submit it already--I think I&#39;ve been working on it for...about three weeks now, if I&#39;ve calculated that correctly. Yeesh.

Mainly, I try to write down the atrocities, make jokes, and take it in relatively small doses (which I didn&#39;t really stick to last time).<br><br>Alright, I&#39;ll make a note of that *notes*. For the rest: cool! (And yes, I think I&#39;d like those links, especially the one about Shyamalan&#39;s explanation. Sounds like fun).<br><br>Thanks for looking into it and for the flattery :) It&#39;s much appreciated. I also ended up writing more on it this morning (about a page&#39;s worth). It&#39;s technically an outtake, but it&#39;s one I had the idea for quite a while ago. (What is it? Well, a pair of PPC agents come in and fix everything, and are confused by Teresa&#39;s presence there. That&#39;s the general idea. In practice, it seems to be Agents Dawn and Edgar going in and snarking at it, although they haven&#39;t actually gotten that far into it yet...) So thanks for that :)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>I was trawling around the LexicanUm inbetween exams today, and found something that actually made me speechless for a second.  <br><br>During an Ork attack on an Imperial Guard command post, the only people to stand against the Orks were a Sub-Overlord and his Ogryn bodyguard, Nork Deddog.  The Orks leading the attack were a squad of Meganobz (really big, really mean Orks in Orky power armor with huge-ass guns and Power Klaws) led by Warboss Uglurk Gitsmasha (Warbosses are UNGODLY.  They&#39;re routinely about 10-12 feet tall and can punt Space Marines around like soccer balls.  The Warboss of the WAAAGH! is the Warboss because he is THE biggest, meanest, &#39;ardest Orkin the entire sector.  These guys do NOT mess around).<br><br>So what do two squishy lil&#39; &#39;umies do against a Warboss and his retinue?  Usually, not much.  Since Nork doesn&#39;t know what &#39;usually&#39; means (being an Ogryn, he&#39;s not exactly a rocket scientist), he figured he&#39;d have a go anyway.<br><br>So he headbutted the Warboss to death.<br><br>Yes, you read that right.  He freaking headbutted a <i>Warboss</i>.  to <i>death</i>.<br><br>the rest of the Orks were so awestruck they actually <i>retreated</i> rather than face Nork.<br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen, the Imperial Guard: bringing the Emperor&#39;s Light to the darkest corners of the galaxy with nothing but glorified flashlights, paper-mache armor, and enough balls to make the Grey Knights lie down and cry like pansies.</p>

            <p>Apparently they were going for over-the-top there, as the bad guys this time were chasing poor Conan with a <i>freaking attack helicopter</i><br><br>Conan&#39;s answer? To use his super-elastic suspenders to bunjee-jump down the skyscraper he was pinned on, and then use them to launch a broken lamp towards the helicopter, crippling its controls.<br><br>Yes, a seventeen-years-old high school student in the body of a seven-years-old kid shot down an attack helicopter with what is basically a <i>glorified slingshot</i>.<br><br>We have another guy who never is to meet Nanoha or Homura here. Mainly because Conan&#39;s actually the smart and knowledgeable one (he&#39;s called the &quot;Sherlock Holmes of the 21st century&quot;)... so he&#39;s basically going to suggest them tactics to better use their already impressive arsenal.</p>

            <p>It seems that letting Conan meet Game Theory!Nanoha is a bad idea. In fact, letting Game Theory!Nanoha meet Homuhomu is a bad idea.</p>
