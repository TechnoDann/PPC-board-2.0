            <p>I was reviewing my agents today and realized that I should probably get a little help with one of them. Nalfein is from a forgotten realms fan fiction(<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2695514/1/Nym-s-Story"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2695514/1/Nym-s-Story">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2695514/1/Nym-s-Story</a></a>), one in which he died pretty young. Back when I was originally writing for the PPC, I got permission from his author to use him in my stories. But, I never really stopped to think about how he&#39;d adjust to: <br>a) living again and<br>b) life outside drow society and <br>c) life in the PPC<br><br>I&#39;ve given him some pretty severe allergies to surface pollen for starters. He has a lot of trouble with open areas, especially where he can see the sky. While he has been taught that the drow are superior to all races, he isn&#39;t so sure anymore--especially since he&#39;s been brought back to life by a non-drow organization. Nalfein has trouble with women, especially women in authority. He goes between being completely cowed to being a little jerk just because he can be one without fear of torture or death. <br><br>I&#39;m also not sure how he would react to his partner, a Generic Human Female who never really dealt with men before. Thoughts? Concerns? </p>

            <p><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mazarun_Zothyrr">Mazarun Zothyrr</a>, who was written by Rilwen Shadowflame, is similarly a male drow agent. I&#39;m not completely familiar with his stories, but giving them a look yourself probably couldn&#39;t hurt. You might also look to Agent Suicide&#39;s new and improved <a href="http://bronzeclockwork.livejournal.com/1728.html">backstory</a> for reference to resurrection.<br><br>I like the idea that he has agoraphobia and allergies to unfamiliar pollen, and I think it makes sense that he&#39;d swing back and forth in his reactions a bit until he learns where his new boundaries are. I will say, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FicPsych_Personnel">FicPsych</a> is your friend! Lots of strong yet compassionate women there to help him adjust. Also a Minbari and an a-gendered former Starfleet counselor-in-training. {= ) (Speaking of us possibly co-writing something...)<br><br>Hopefully his partner is able to learn along with him and not be completely messed up by having to deal with such an unstable person.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Nalfien wasn&#39;t fully grown by any means. He didn&#39;t even complete his first year of weapons training before death. So he&#39;s in the odd position of still needing guidance in the world. I imagine that he&#39;s also quite a bit weaker than Mazarun. So that could end up interesting. I&#39;d love to write his back story and some of his time in FicPsych with you. <br><br>I think he has an interesting case, and a suitable partner. Agent Rowen isn&#39;t a schemer by any means, and is rather naive for a PPC Agent in regards to out-of-job interaction. I was going to write Nalfein as struggling with new feelings such as compassion for his fellow Agents. Although, he&#39;d never admit to having such feelings. </p>

            <p>Not everybody in FicPsych is mine, but many of them are. If you&#39;d like to pick a nurse or two to bounce Nalfein off of, I can most likely oblige. I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know very much about the Forgotten Realms setting in general, but I at least read the beginning of a book about Drizzt once, before he escaped to the surface, and Nurse Jenni knew one from a Generic Medieval Fantasy RP‚Äîyour typical whiny, angsty Drizzt clone, was my impression. Nurse Elms has the best excuse for being more knowledgeable than I am, but she&#39;s also the least likely to be nurturing, as such, since her idea of therapy is to shove a beer into the other person&#39;s hand and play bartender. ^_^;<br><br>(BTW, you seem to be switching between spelling it &quot;Row<b>a</b>n&quot; and &quot;Row<b>e</b>n.&quot; It&#39;s &quot;Rowan&quot; in the WM co-write; are you changing it?)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s spelled &#39;Rowen&#39;. But, I keep misspelling it for some reason. It&#39;s driving me slightly crazy, to be honest. I&#39;d love to have Nalfein speak to just about anyone. Who do you think would be the most therapeutic? I imagine after Agent Suicide&#39;s resurrection, a stint in FicPsych would be required. <br><br>I had a hilarious idea just now. Rowen and Nalfein might be in FicPsych for Partners Counseling at some point. After all, Rowen has a mini Aragog and that might be causing some contention.<br><br>When do you think you&#39;ll be free to go through either of those?</p>

            <p>Rowen it is, then! I&#39;ll have to remember to go correct the spelling in that mission and on the wiki.<br><br>I kinda like the idea of using Nurse Parwill, actually, since that would put Nalfein in the position of having to deal with someone not noticeably male or female.

            <p>You could try getting in contact with Rilwen. She lurks a lot and doesn&#39;t really write much for the PPC these days, but she might well be very interested in a new drow agent - especially one in some need of guidance. Mazarun&#39;s been developed a lot off-screen, and I&#39;ve seen a lot of that - so he might be willing to help out a young man of his own people. (He&#39;s not the type to backstab Nalfein for the hell of it, either, as many drow would.)</p>

First, because it&#39;s an awesome story and this gave me an excuse to reread it. ;P<br><br>Secondly, it&#39;s been bothering me for a while that, internally to the PPC, there is absolutely nothing special about Jay and Acacia. They weren&#39;t the first agents (in-universe), or the first Assassins, or the longest-serving, or anything. But given how unique they are to <i>us</i> - and given how often that drifts over into <i>agents</i> revering them for reasons undefined - I feel like there ought to be something special about them, something that sets them apart (from an in-universe POV) from everyone else.<br><br>This review is my attempt to define that uniqueness.

            <p>This was just... so spot-on in terms of everything that makes Jay and Acacia stand out. It&#39;s definitely helpful to have an explanation in-universe for their importance, too. I&#39;ve sort of wondered about that before, because we see them mentioned in other missions as revered figures, but we never actually see why they&#39;re so important. So now we know!</p>

            <p>Hello. They call me A.R., for my username, you see, and I just came over here to see how this works. I found the FAQ: The Board article somewhat confusing, but that just may be me. My friend, Hannah, sent me here while we were writing a tale of twisted plot lines. She and I were soon drawn in to a discussion of Mary-Sue type traveling, and it went on from there. <br>This happened quite a time ago and I was trawling through my incredibly clogged-up inbox when I discovered the link once again. Hannah and I decided we would like to see how this site works, so here I am. Hello, beautiful, glorious- you know what, I&#39;m just going to be quiet and figure out how beautiful and glorious this place is. <br></p>

            <p>Meh, since I&#39;m too lazy to explain, here&#39;s the Urban Dictionary definition...<br><br>1.  A regift. A relatively trivial object that has repeatedly been given as a present. Strictly, a mathom is probably NOT an object with a tendency to decay (i.e. fruitcake), nor an object of obviously poor construction (i.e. a crooked handmade sweater or junk), nor a family heirloom or a useful &quot;hand-me-down&quot; article (i.e. toddler clothing), nor one which requires expensive upkeep (i.e. a large, exotic pet -- a proveribial white elephant). <br>Such objects most likely persist because they are slightly too valuable or unusual to dispose of outright or give to Goodwill, yet have such limited use or appeal that few wish to retain them. Modern-day candidates for mathomhood are commonly visible in catalogs for novelty electronics, pop art, junk jewelry, and sports memorabilia, as well as in roadside &quot;local&quot; gift stores.<br>&quot;It was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up; for which the custom of giving so many birthday-presents was largely responsible. Not, of course, that the birthday-presents were always new; there were one or two old mathoms of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district; but Bilbo had usually given new presents and kept those that he received.&quot; <br><br>-- J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring, p. 65.<br><br>2.    A term coined by JRR Tolkien, meaning an object given as a present to someone who does not want it. This person then gives it to someone else at an appropriate occasion. The object passes to the majority of people in the area over time, becoming a mathom.</p>

            <p>If you want the Sue Slayers to become a part of the PPC, that might be difficult, depending on writing styles and so on.<br><br>If, instead, you want the SS and PPC to exist in the same multiverse and talk occasionally (which in my view would be far more interesting), that&#39;s a lot easier.

            <p>Which is to say, what sort of creatures do you typically find, what&#39;s your working model of the multiverse, that sort of thing. From the looks of your name and your alleged &quot;being the same&quot; as the PPC, I suspect that at least a portion of the creatures you encounter are Mary Sues of some description, but aside from that, I&#39;m not sure what your organization <i>is</i>, so to speak. I found one story on fanfiction.net under the Sue Slayers title, but I don&#39;t know if it was connected to you, so I&#39;m treating it as apocryphal until I get a yes or no from you or one of your co-writers.<br><br>Now, to more questions. What&#39;s your mission statement? What sort of organizations, creature types, or miscellany commonly oppose your group? What are typical problems or complications encountered by your elite squad of canon protectors? What&#39;s the species range like for said squad?<br>Also, anything else you&#39;d think would be good to know. I tend to like details, and the presence of a new inter-dimensional organization is likely going to have a large number of them.large <br><br>Do you have a wiki? A wiki would help. Those tend to have as many terms as one would want, and would answer several of my previous questions.</p>

            <p>Well,we really don&#39;t have a wiki. There&#39;s only 11 people, and we all are writing a relly big fanfic at the moment, to try to kickstart our project. If you read in the Artemis Fowl fandom, that&#39;s good, you can read ot and get some answrs. Otherwis, I&#39;m doing another one in Harry Potter.<br><br>Our unofficial motto is &#39;Mary Sue? I shoot You.&#39; We go against Mary Sues, but our otjer concerns are fangirls. The Canon charactersca&#39;t see r hear them, ut if they accidenty touch them, the Cano can suddenlysee them and the fangirl squees, which is like glomphing. We have to o in and remove the Sues and Fangils.<br><br>We get people to wtite us in and ot of fanfics.<br><br>I hope this answrs some of your quesytins. And the reason theres so many spelling mistakes is... Im typing on a mobile device.  </p>

            <p>That is a loooot of weird word manglings. If that&#39;s what typing on a mobile phone looks like, I will never post to the Board from one. Your mobile phone wouldn&#39;t happen to be hosting a grammasite nest, would it?<br><br>I still have questions. A few are questions from before:<br>What are the species in your canon protection squad? For example, the PPC has a vast amount of species, including humans, elves, krogans, fairies, undead, living typos, ex-Jedi, etcetra, all led by telepathic plants.<br>What species do you have?<br><br>What&#39;s the working model of the multiverse you use? A trans-dimensional organization needs to have an idea of how each dimension operates. For example, in the PPC, the Agents enter into Word Worlds created by bad fanfiction that leech off of the central continuum, which contains the canon. Once in the offshoot, they destroy it by killing a Sue, untangling a crossover, exorcizing a Sue-wraith or slash demon, etcetera, to reassert the canon. It gets more complicated from there, but not all of the more complicated bits are commonly agreed upon, so they&#39;re just theories in-universe.<br>How does your organization treat the multiverse and the concept of a multiverse?<br><br>What type of creatures do you encounter in the assorted continua? For example, the PPC Agents can find Sues, minis, wraiths of varying description, Cute Animal Friends, entities called into being by misspellings or odd word placement, and more.<br>You mentioned that you encounter Sues and fangirls, but what other creatures do your canon protectors have to deal with?<br><br>Now, a few more questions:<br><br>How do the fangirls get in? Are they doing it on purpose, or is something dropping them there? If the former, how are they able to enter a canonical universe, and if the latter, why is whatever it is dropping random fangirls off-world?<br><br>How do these fangirls relate to the fangirls of quote-unquote Real Life? Sues in PPC missions are created by an instance of bad fanfiction written by a person in Real Life, often a fangirl or fanboy of some description.<br>However, fangirls or fanboys in Real Life do not have the power to turn invisible or emit mind-piercing squees (ear-piercing squees is another matter). So, why can this breed of fangirl do it? Were they modified by something? Is it a Narrative Error? Do the canon characters just stalwartly ignore the fangirls until said fangirls emit their squee?<br>Also, what does the squee do? Does it damage the canon characters in some way, or is it just annoying and serving to keep them from fulfilling their duties?<br><br>What supplies your organization with its advanced capabilities? In order to hop from world to world, there must be something extraordinary involved, such as magic, advanced technology, both, or another force altogether. Additionally, it&#39;s probable that there&#39;s some sort of specialized equipment to make it easier to handle the Sues, or to detect their presence, or something of the sort, to give the canon protectors the edge. If there is, what is it, and who created that?<br><br>One last question, a bit less important, but a curiosity: Who&#39;s in charge? Does someone lead your canon protectors, and if so, how did he/she/it get elevated to the position of leader?</p>

            <p>woooo. That&#39;s a lot of questions. Okay, first can I just say that we wanted to join up because youre so uch more organized than us.<br>To business.<br>We are all humans. Each of us has a separate job, for example, I coordinate it all. My friend, Kat, takes care of keeping track of the bad writers. And so on.<br>Our model of the FanFiction universe goes like this: There&#39;s tthe mnormal world, whee people write FanFiction and go about their lives. We call thes Area 52. Then there&#39;s the area weere we and related organizations work on. es and Fangirls probably live here, we dont knoow. This is the transdomain. Then there&#39;s Canon Verses, one forach bfandom. These are  the same as area 52 but they have the canon nd settings in them. The lat area is The Fanaaes. And this is where the fanfictions are.<br>Wr enter the canon/fanon verses when a specialist (Usually Jaxon) writes us in to a fanfiction. He noramall just adds a sentences (Then Kitty Eden appeared) but sometimes he goes evjil and adds a pegeg to us or something. <br>From there, we hake out the evils in the usual way: Tranquilizers for Fangirls, Sue Serum for sue related.<br><br>We have about 20 varieties of fangirls, includedng th superSonic Squeer an the rare Emo. Theres also plotholes that confuse evrtyting Round it (hermione is suddenly dumb). The Fangirls get inon purpose usually, by sneaking in after us or sues ar through fanomportals.  <br>The sues nd fangirls are created the same as ppc ones. <br>The ft that fangirls are invisible to canon is normal in our world.Also, squees do not form any permanant damage, but are really ad for your eardrium. Plus the ft that its annoying.<br><br>All of us just got letters in the mail insttuvting us to come to the same place at a time. And we ended up at SSHQ.

            <p>From the looks of it, it seems as though you&#39;re framing the fangirls as a different species, as though they&#39;re related to the usual sort of fangirls conceptually, but they have various special abilities, live in an alternate dimension, and can create &quot;fanomportals&quot;, which I&#39;m guessing are some variety of cross-continuum transit.<br>Are these normal fangirls that got trapped in the transdomain zones and turned into some sort of hyper-elevated beings because of it? Are they physical versions of common fangirl archetypes? What gave them their powers and distinctions?<br><br>Wait, so the fangirls don&#39;t have the ability to interact with people in the canon continua because... the canon characters weren&#39;t native to the same place the fangirls were? I need a little more information here. It sounds like you&#39;re saying &quot;characters from books can&#39;t see or hear their readers when they&#39;re playing out their story, so they would still be unable to see or hear them even when those readers were placed in the same room as those canon characters, yet the canon characters would still be able to interact with their readers by touch&quot;, which doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense.<br><br>Also, why are the fangirls considered a threat? Will they summon other fangirls if they&#39;re left alone for long enough? Do they attempt to remove canon characters from the continuum? I acknowledge that if they&#39;re allowed to run rampant around the continuum, they&#39;ll cause damage eventually, because they&#39;re fangirls, but what are the ones that cause trouble for your group normally capable of? I read some of one of your stories, and it looks like your canon protectors aren&#39;t averse to making canon characters aware of their presence or altering events in the story progression to reach their quarry, so the motivation for getting rid of the fangirls can&#39;t be removal of foreign elements for the sake of preserving the story as written.<br><br>You said your Specialists are capable of altering the Fanaaes, or fanfiction-created realities, to insert you into the badfic, but can they edit the badfic in any other way? I&#39;ll accept that they couldn&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t just edit the badfic to remove the Sue&#39;s influence, since that would be too easy, but can they, say, alter some descriptive text to turn the tables on the Sue during a fight, or to make temporal distortions less unbearable?<br><br>Saying &quot;the usual way&quot; implies that you expect that I&#39;d already know what Sue Serum is or how it works, but I don&#39;t. Is it made from Sues? Is it used against Sues to shut off their powers or turn their abilities against them? Do your canon protectors consume it to counteract Suvian abilities?</p>

            <p>The fangirls are jut normal humansthat have learnt how to squeal reallyloudly and have caught portals into the transcontinum. The reason that canon characters can&#39;t see them isthat they havent ben written into the story. The Canon cant feel them either, but if they accidently walk into the spot a fangirl isoccupying, the fangirl becomes visible and uually squees. The only way they could get in through a fanonportal is if a mary sue creates one.<br>Fangirls only uually hunt out their lust objects in ones or ts, but occasionally they form a group of 50 r more, which we call a squee.  They usually do this to grouply get their lust objects. Tanya and Kobey take care of this type of thing, but we sometimes all go in.<br>D like to point out that stories by EpitomeOfRandomness are not the same as what I describe ht share some characteristics, ut we are seperate<br><br>Sue serum is made from fangirl drool and some other ingredients uch as extract of bluehole. You load it into a tranquilizer dart andvhhoot it at the sue. They melt. theres a sepert srum for stus. Either serum is highly dngros to canoniharactrcal c</p>

            <p>... that the very nature of our (collective) job means that inconsistant or even wildly contradictory views of the fanfiction phenomenon aren&#39;t a problem. There&#39;s a fair amount of stuff in your version that wouldn&#39;t work in the PPC - but who cares? When you&#39;re in and out of fictional realms every day of the week, you tend to take a looser view of &#39;reality&#39;. Heck, what with differing Multiverse Theories and perpetual disagreements on where PPC HQ is and how it works, out agents can&#39;t even agree among <i>themselves</i>. I have an organisation (Ispace) who claim that writing stories is the only way to change reality - and it&#39;s true, for them.<br><br>I don&#39;t think you (or rather your characters) should or even could join the PPC, as in becoming Agents in a Department and living in HQ, at least not without massive changes. But then, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a need. As I hope I&#39;ve said earlier, liasons are good, and you and your friends (er, if your friends are real people - you&#39;ve blurred the border between the SS and yourself quite thoroughly) are more than welcome to come and hang out in the PPC community. We&#39;d love to see your story/stories when you finish them (if you take a look down this Board, you can see <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=245985;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">we post our own PPC stories</a> on here to share), and I&#39;m positive people would offer you helpful, constructive advice on your writing (which we&#39;re all after, by the way!).<br><br>And maybe at some point someone can write a joint mission with you. Eek - two wildly different Trans-Dimensional Organisations working together in the field, <i>that</i> sounds exciting...<br><br>hS<br><br>PS#1: I can&#39;t quite tell... do you have stories/a story up on the internet somewhere yet, or is it still in the works?<br><br>PS#2: Wow, your mobile device <i>really</i> doesn&#39;t like you. Have you had it checked for malevolent artificial intelligences recently?</p>

            <p>...the PPC is far from inactive. *Ahem!* What you see before you is only the posting board, a sort of slow-paced forum. The real gruntwork is done by members writing their missions and sporking badfic.

            <p>I&#39;m not sure if any of you remember me. Sadly, I&#39;ve been pretty inactive for a while. I&#39;ve been thinking of popping back in for a while, but my hand was stayed by a combination of procrastination and a bit of confusion as to how to subtly join in on posts after a long period of inactivity. However, I decided it was best to check in, much like when facing a doctor&#39;s appointment or job interview.<br>It&#39;s nice to see everyone again, so that makes it much more enticing than the doctor&#39;s office, at least! </p>

            <p>Can you stop the fang-panda from staring at me? It&#39;s weirding me out, like it&#39;s trying to steal my soul or something. I offered it eucalyptus, but I remembered too late that that&#39;s for koalas, and now the panda&#39;s not even moving. I think I made it mad, but I can&#39;t tell, and I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;ll charge when I try to back away. Do pandas charge people? This is rapidly becoming an important question.</p>

If Sousuke begins late, it may not be compatible with his skill as a soldier, as children don&#39;t build strength as well as teenagers, and Sousuke is quite strong. And being too stuck as a soldier will not to make him ignorant about wet dreams, as the first one is rather automatic. He must be weirded out and consult with any seniors, although in his own weird way.</p>

            <p>If he was practicing, we&#39;d have seen that. I&#39;ve watched the anime and read the manga, which goes on way longer than the anime. You can&#39;t be secular enough to not show any religious tendencies during all the spoilers that happen.<br><br>In general: Religious obligations just sound too impractical for someone like Sosuke, who sees everything as a potential combat situation. He doesn&#39;t get a lot of aspects of civilian life, due to his upbringing, and somehow I suspect religion to be one of these things. He seems to believe more in practical things and guidelines than in the concept of a god. He&#39;s following his own codex already.</p>

            <p>Yes, he is rather clueless over nonmilitary life. <br><br>[He seems to believe more in practical things and guidelines than in the concept of a god.] I think there is once a sect that follows this tenet, that is the Mu&#39;tazilahs. But the Sunnis had absorbed them in, forming the basis of Islamic jurispudence and the Four Imams. This also reminds me of Alawites,who are very lax in their interpretation of Islam. <br><br>I defer to your judgement, since you watched the manga and read the anime. What&#39;s the main sect of Helmajistanis? Are they mostly Sunnis, in which case I can drop the idea for my fanfic easily? Or other sects? Could sectarian difference be the reason why Helmajistan be at civil war, or is it just KGB&#39;s plans?<br><br>Or let&#39;s just put this discussion to rest by assuming Sousuke is nonreligious, just as he&#39;s not attaching himself to any nationality.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s part of his backstory, Sousuke Sagara was a Japanese stranded at Helmajistan, and was taught Islam by KGB and a faction that he was forced to join as a child soldier. So yeah, he will be considered a Muslim.<br><br>I want to explore him as a Muslim, since it will bring new challenges to the world. Sousuke is having feelings for Kaname, and if he thought that the Islamic Law applies to him now, he may have new problems to consider. How is he going to Salah when his charge is at risk? Can he fast and maintain energy? (there are pills for that, but I never tried it). Thus the requirement for late puberty.<br><br>Or it can go in other direction; Kaname discovers Sousuke is a Muslim, and when confronted Sousuke says &#39;yes&#39;, which doesn&#39;t fly with him willing to eat pork. Then a twist reveal is that Sousuke, and in extension Helmajistan, is a nation whose majority amount of Muslims are of a &#39;heretical&#39; branch. No, don&#39;t look at me like that, there are many &#39;heretical&#39; sects of Islam, with many weird interpretations.</p>

            <p>But from what you say the simplest solution is that he isn&#39;t a practising Muslim.

            <p>But it&#39;s not the best idea if I want to write a fanfic. I need a conflict, but if he&#39;s simpy not practising, it wouldn&#39;t be much. Unless I do a thoughtfic where he considers himself Japanese first. But this contradicts canon, where in Second Raid, if I remember, he considers himself not bound to any nationality. And his teetolary is just that he can&#39;t stand alcohol, to the level of that one Shinigami captain.<br><br>By the way, there are Muslims in Japan,but they are a lot less strict than Malaysia&#39;s.</p>

            <p>... but would it be plausible for something to happen that makes Sousuke <em>want</em> to become more observant?  I can&#39;t speak for Muslims, but I&#39;ve noticed that people who become more-observant Christian later in life tend to go overboard at first.  That would certainly give you some conflicts with other characters.</p>

            <p>Given that Sousuke have faced much in his childhood and teenage years, I doubt anything negative will spur him to Islam. Perhaps something positive, such as his realisation that he have a child with Kaname, whom he already married. That is too far to the future, unfortunately. Or even a fiery imam reading his sermon at the Friday Mosque, where Sousuke was commissioned to guard for some reason.<br><br>My initial idea is something neutral but almost implausible, that is he achieved, or realised that he is already, akil baligh (equivalent to Bar Mitzvah, only automatic, rather than officiated by a ritual). Thus the weight of Islamic Law falls upon him and he had to begin following the tenets.<br><br>I already explained what baligh is before, refer to my opening post.

            <p>I saw the other day on Pinterest a little homemade glitter recipe. It was salt and food coloring mixed and then spread the salt out and bake it to dry it back out from the food color. If you aren&#39;t opposed to food color (or if you used something natural like beet juice) then it is edible and could be used on food. <br><br>It might even be a neat trick that it is salty instead of sweet, as Sue&#39;s aren&#39;t really what they seem to be. <br><br>Of course the same trick would work with sugar if you wanted it to be sweet. The original was for something you&#39;d glitter and leave lying around and wouldn&#39;t want sugar to attract ants.</p>

            <p>And it&#39;s adapted from the official recipe in <i>The Dragonlover&#39;s Guide to Pern</i>, so it has that going for it, too. If you&#39;re curious, this is the original, which makes a big batch:<br><br> Mix together:<br><br>* 2 tablespoons sweet ground chocolate<br>* 1/2 cup dark cocoa<br>* 3/8 teaspoon cinnamon<br>* 1 teaspoon dark instant coffee crystals, ground to powder<br>* small pinch of nutmeg<br><br>Use two to four teaspoons of the mixture per cup of boiling water. Stir well. The klah should be thick, much like hot cocoa.<br></p>

<p><br>I personally found it too bitter to drink without dumping a lot of sugar and milk in it, being mostly cocoa powder and coffee, so I tinkered and fiddled and adjusted and scaled it down for one cup at a time in the process. I normally don&#39;t put coffee in things, either, but in the end it really works well to round out and enrichen the flavor. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve never tried to make anything from scratch (well, not since I knew what cookery actually meant), but I do remember making Dwarf Bread from <i>Nanny Ogg&#39;s Cookbook</i>.

            <p>I&#39;ll post a proper recipe later, but my version of ryshcate is something between a date loaf with delusions of grandeur and a fruit cake.<br><br>I use walnuts to substitute for vweilu nuts (my local grocer just <i>can&#39;t</i> seem to get vweilu nuts in stock). Other than that, my version is basically a fruit cake with dates, raisins, crystallised ginger, plus cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg and allspice; a bit of brown sugar for sweetening and then I mix in a glass of whisky into the cake mix to give it some fire (again, my local liquor store can&#39;t seem to stock Whyren&#39;s Reserve so I usually go for a lighter single malt that&#39;s been finished in a sherry cask for a bit of honey/spice flavour). <br><br>I&#39;ve made this version of ryshcate three or four times now and it works pretty well.<br><br>Elcalion, culinary</p>

            <p>It&#39;s essentially a repository for any non-mission-related stories I write about the families. It tends to be just the &#39;present&#39; I update, though.<br><br>As to Origins... okay: I&#39;ve just (as in yesterday) found a framing that allows me to tell the parts of the story I want to tell. I&#39;m working on my version of &#39;the complete Origins&#39; now.<br><br>However, I&#39;m deliberately leaving a lot of things vague, so as not to stop you writing yours. The Cascade and Civil War will be in there, but I won&#39;t be using any of the named characters you came up with - I&#39;ll just be leaving it, as I say, vague and undefined. And in general, the whole story will be suffering from &#39;unreliable (and occasionally outright lying) narrator syndrome&#39;.<br><br>There is definitely still a place for your version, and you are free to keep writing it, with two caveats:<br><br>1/ Since there will be a &#39;Huinesoron&#39;s <i>Origins</i>&#39;, it&#39;d be good if you could change the title of yours. Otherwise it could get confusing. I plan to at some point break up the Wiki article into three - &#39;Origin of the Plants&#39;, &#39;Origin of the PPC&#39;, and &#39;Origin (planet)&#39;.<br><br>2/ You&#39;ll need to find somewhere else to host it. For what I hope are obvious reasons, I prefer to put my own stories up on my site where possible.<br><br>The history of the PPC is not my personal playground. Anyone is allowed to write about it, and write anything they want. That point has been made recently about the future (both Phobos and the Irish Samurai have written &#39;future-AUs&#39; of late), but I don&#39;t think people have quite realised it about the past. The PPC, past, present and future, is an open book: anyone (with Permission) can write in it, whether they want to add to, update, or outright contradict what&#39;s already there.<br><br>hS</p>

However there are two points that I would like to raise (not with you specifically, just about this topic in general, and this seems like the best place to do it).<br><br>Firstly, you&#39;ll probably find that stuff set in the future is more obviously speculative, simply because it hasn&#39;t happened yet. Whereas stuff set in the past is possibly more likely to be considered the definitive article on what happened back then. Having some more stuff be set in the past, particularly if they offer alternative viewpoints/perspectives/interpretations/events, would probably help make the point that the past is just as much up for grabs as the future is.<br><br>Secondly, you&#39;ve said that &#39;The PPC, past, present and future, is an open book: anyone (with Permission) can write in it, whether they want to add to, update, <u>or outright contradict what&#39;s already there.</u>&#39; (emphasis added) - something I happen to agree with in principle (with the caveat that just because you <i>can</i> do something, doesn&#39;t mean that you necessarily <i>should</i>, regarding the contradicting). But, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies#There_are_so_many_rules_to_remember.21_Do_I_have_to_ask_permission_for_everything_I_do.3F">one of our FAQs</a> says &#39;Permission is given once, after which you&#39;re pretty much free to do what you like, <u>provided it doesn&#39;t actually contradict previous work</u> or isn&#39;t horribly overblown and self-serving.&#39; (again, emphasis added). <br><br>Now if what you&#39;ve said is true, and I believe that it is, then that wording in the FAQ isn&#39;t exactly the most helpful. I can certainly see that there are things that we wouldn&#39;t want contradicted - any works set in the same time period (and multiverse - we seem to be collecting extra ones) should all agree on who is in charge of which Department, etc. but if we&#39;re going to allow minor differences (something which would be helpful if we want to tell our own stories set in the past, rather than just rehashing the old ones) then maybe that could do with tweaking slightly. <br></p>

            <p>I&#39;d say it&#39;d be best to not contradict or attempt to overwrite other people&#39;s work when possible, even when you are dealing with events that took/will take place in the past/future.<br><br>The PPC is essentially built on large groups of people working on a shared world with each other, and if each person says that they want to make their own timeline that nobody else can go into, that&#39;s limiting where that world can go. If there are new stories that can be told within the past or the future, making them work within an already-established timeline will make the past/future bigger and more detailed, while splitting each past/future into a dozen separate timelines is going to make everything mutually exclusive and deprive current and future writers of the fun of bringing together old details for new stories.<br><br>That said, I agree with you on your first section: I would like to see more done with events from the past, and not just the huge histories and world-altering events that have been seen in past-set stories before. I&#39;m not saying doing so would be bad, and the stories dealing with world-altering past events I read have been quite good, but the small things can be just as interesting as the big things, or could themselves seem just as important as the big things, if set up in the right way.<br><br>People don&#39;t have to rehash old stories or retcon out details just to set something in the same time period or multiverse as other works. Yes, people should add new points to make their stories their own and not rely on pre-existing ones, but they don&#39;t need to do that to the extent that it makes it incompatible with anything or everything else that could be done with the setting by someone else. People shouldn&#39;t solve the problem of a setting in the PPC&#39;s space-time only being used by one person by creating a large amount of one-person-only-settings.</p>

            <p>Have you written any chapters in story form yet? The summary is nice, and it provides more information at least, but it would be nice to see more of it as a narrative. I&#39;ve been interested in the Origins project for a while now, partially because it has so much free space to tell its story in, even after the new summary described the basic sequence of events, and I&#39;d enjoy seeing more of it.</p>

            <p>Yes, I still live, and will likely be sending in a lot of ppc stories semi soon as well. However, this is not about me, this post is about you!<br><br> Now, normally I would hand over a Fandom Pinkie Pie Party and call it a post, but this just will not stand this time! During a mixture of plotholes, Star Treck transporters, Apeture Science technology, and Pinkie&#39;s fourth wall powers, I can give you a Fandom-Wide Pinkie Pie Party! Just tell Pinkie the fandoms you are part of, and she will organise a multiversal party, with all of your favorite characters! At the end, you will celebrate with all of the guests gathering around a giant statue of you holding a torch, and getting mass neutralized. After the event, all you will have to remember the wild party is a good feeling inside and this very post.<br><br>Hope it was fun!</p>

            <p>So, due to constant communion with the Internet, I have found a few intriguing bits and pieces, but the one of which I&#39;ll speak here is something that might cause a surge of fanfiction to appear in the videogames tag. <br><br>Namco High: A Dating Sim for video characters. That&#39;s right, players can date video game characters such as Mrs. Pacman. <br><br>The official press release is here: <a href="http://www.shiftylook.com/news/post/introducing-namco-high"><a href="http://www.shiftylook.com/news/post/introducing-namco-high">http://www.shiftylook.com/news/post/introducing-namco-high</a></a><br><br>Personally, I&#39;m kind of excited. It&#39;s a new and fun idea, and it seems interesting. However, an increase of certain types of fanfic involving NAMCO characters seems imminent. For now, I&#39;m just going to enjoy the thought of such a game and hope to enjoy it.<br><br><br></p>

            <p>So <i>this</i> is what he was planning to do after Homestuck was over. I have to say, I wasn&#39;t expecting this at all, but it&#39;s sort of his job to do things people don&#39;t expect him to do, so... Good move, Hussie.<br>Before I read the article, I was confused about the whole &quot;people make retro game characters date&quot; thing. Now I&#39;m interested to see what this ends up looking like. Also, I&#39;m looking forward to the inevitable shipping of Mappy and a Galaxian. Someone is going to do it eventually. This is the Internet, after all. Someone probably has, for that matter, but it&#39;ll be funnier in this context.<br><br>Also, the article featured one of those &quot;also on this site&quot; link boxes that led me to a Galaga comic written by Ryan North and illustrated by the guy from Dr. McNinja. I think I like this site.</p>

            <p>THe way each scene is staged in Tamora Pierce&#39;s work means that the movie would have to work hard to express how each setting  and set of characters had different codes regarding combat, interaction, and appropriate response. <br><br>Her books are great at showing how scenarios are appropriate in some situations but not others, and express why pretty well.

            <p>Consider how massive, and massively episodic, the Belgariad is... I&#39;m not sure you could actually fit it into five films and do it justice, and when was the last time anyone reached five in a series of films? The new Narnia adaptation appears to have stalled out at three.<br><br>But a TV series... yes, please. I think (if I were making it) I&#39;d probably start with the scene where Garion runs away from everyone in Arendia - it&#39;s a nice active start, pretty close to the beginning, without too many characters already introduced, <i>and</i> it lets the audience share his &#39;who are these scary people&#39; experience, rather than going &#39;Garion, what are you on?&#39;.<br><br>Then I&#39;d probably split the stuff before that up into a few chunks and give it as flashbacks, dream sequences and conversations where it seemed to fit. It would help fill out the impression that Garion&#39;s trying to figure out what he&#39;s gotten himself into...<br><br>Of course, if I <i>were</i> the obscenely rich person I&#39;d have to be to make it, I&#39;d make sure before we started that we could pull off three things:<br><br>-The corrupt decadence of Tolnedra<br>-The sheer mind-numbing terror of Maragor (and specifically the capital)<br>-The holiness of Ulgo<br><br>There&#39;s other things that I&#39;d look into (the Stronghold, for instance), but if we can&#39;t do those three, we wouldn&#39;t have a hope of doing the whole story.<br><br>hS<br><br>(All names from memory, sincere apologies if I got them mixed up)</p>

            <p>I wasn&#39;t sure whether or not to suggest TV series. That&#39;d definitely work.<br><br>If I can say, though, I&#39;d choose to have the Sparhawk books realised on screen. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the Garion books, but for some reason these days the Sparhawk ones appeal to me more. Maybe because it&#39;s slightly grittier and full of more cynical people while still delivering the timeless giggles that Eddings does so well. :P But I agree with Antigone as regards Aphrael - it would be kinda tricky with a six-year old, as the Child-Goddess usually appears. Unless they shot all of her scenes together and everyone else&#39;s around that.</p>

            <p>My main problem with Sparhawk is that I read <i>Tamuli</i> first - so I have some difficulty remembering what happens in <i>Elenium</i>.

            <p>The Sparhawk books would probably work better split up in the style of the LOTR trilogies - er, splitting-up-wise, not changing-lots-of-stuff-wise. The other main issue with Aphrael is the point in the Tamuli where she&#39;s both Danae and Flute in the same room, although I&#39;m fairly sure there are ways around that already. Twins maybe? That&#39;d help with the issue of how much filming has to be done to get all the scenes, too, if each one can shoulder half the load.<br><br>Can you tell this is something I really long to see? :P</p>

            <p>... IF they can find a child actress capable of playing Flute/Aphrael.  That would probably be the hardest part, because she&#39;s clearly described as a child, not a teenager.  Knowing Hollywood, they&#39;d probably cast some 30-year old as the Child-Goddess.<br><br>(I was thinking after last Costume Con that if I could scrounge up four males to wear them for the Fantasy/SF Masquerade, there&#39;s enough description in the Elenium to re-create the formal armor of the Church Knights.  Then I started looking at prices for Wondra and Wonderflex.  Ouch!)<br><br>I suspect it wouldn&#39;t be all that hard to do a movie/TV version of any of the Elemental Masters novels.  They&#39;re all set in the Victorian/Edwardian/very early WWI period, so the costumes are already sitting in theatrical warehouses.  Current CGI is definitely up for creating the elemental creatures and any visual effects of spellcasting.</p>

They&#39;re not quite as zippy as the one-man skycraft, but still very impressive.<br><br><img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lft89jqMqX1qfio47o1_500.jpg" alt="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lft89jqMqX1qfio47o1_500.jpg"></p>

            <p>And thirding, and fourth...ed...ing - or whatever.<br><br>And, having just finished re-reading <i>Midnight</i>, I agree with you that it&#39;d probably be the best one to start with. Although it would be nice if they expanded on the section where they&#39;re travelling through the Deepwoods by including some of the stuff from <i>Beyond the Deepwoods</i> - they kind of gloss over the danger and sheer variety of fantastic creatures in <i>Midnight</i>. </p>

            <p>I remember it now-- the sci-fi version of Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s story with the fancy spaceships, the solar hoverboards, the cyborgs, and... and... that scene with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMdr9J5Vfs">black hole</a>.

            <p>I could go off on a rant about everything that was wrong with that movie. And they&#39;re making a sequel. I can&#39;t even...<br><br>Well, I won&#39;t rant. I&#39;ll just say they could have made it close to the book and been a huge cash cow franchise like Harry Potter, and then we would have had Kane Chronicles movies, and Heroes of Olympus movies...I&#39;d love to see those.

            <p>But if I did, I&#39;d end up writing a five-page rant about everything that&#39;s wrong with the movie, which would probably end up going into the mythological errors in the books, which would trail off from there... so I won&#39;t. <br><br>The Sea of Monsters looks slightly better. At least this time they got Annabeth&#39;s hair color right. Somewhat of an achievement. Kane Chronicles movies would be awesome, too. Those remain my favorite Rick Riordan books, although that&#39;s possibly just because of my fascination with Egyptian mythology. <br><br>I&#39;d like to see the rest of the Narnia series, but I really, really disliked the first HDM movie, and I think I&#39;d be ambivalent about another one. <br><br>A Good Omens movie would be amazing, but the film would have to be done really, really well for it to come anywhere close to the book.  <br><br>Oh, and a Discworld TV show about the Ankh-Morpork City Watch is in the works.

            <p>There are not enough excited fist pumps and joyous jumping arounds available to me right now to properly express my excitement, so I&#39;ll go with a simplified text form: OH, YES!<br>I wonder what they&#39;d do to make Constable Dorfl happen. They&#39;ll probably just make a CGI golem, but CGI in television is either boring or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCIbHUgbGx4">really bad</a>, and besides, speculation is fun.<br><br>I wonder what the explanation in-story will be for how Annabeth&#39;s hair color changes in the Sea of Monsters movie. Though, they&#39;ll probably go New Dumbledore and act as though it was like that the whole time, creating yet another continuity error.<br><br>Ugh, the Lightning Thief movie. I was unfortunate enough to have watched it in theaters, and the amount of What Is This that was generated by five random security guards merging into a fire-breathing Lernean Hydra could have fed a small village. I&#39;m not sure what sort of villagers would eat that, though, but the point remains.<br>Also, that&#39;s the only scene I actually remember clearly, so it had the disadvantage of being forgettable as well. I think there was one part with Liam Neeson as Zeus, but that could have been the Clash of the Titans remake.<br>Though, for the Clash of the Titans remake, they strayed so far away from the original story and any mythological basis that any connection to previous works could just be abandoned, which I think actually worked out better for it, since it dropped any illusions I had that it was going to relate in any way to anything else, which is why I only blinked in confusion at the inexplicable inclusion of Arabic mythological elements into a Greek mythological story instead of fuming. It&#39;s quite unlike the Percy Jackson movie, which kept throwing in lines to the shore of the established canon even when it had gone completely off the rails, and caused no end of exasperated sighs from me.<br><br>This is very far from the original topic now, so I&#39;ll stop before I diverge further.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s still building off the first movie (Grover, the actors being too old, etc.). And I seem to recall a canon breach from the trailer to the effect of &quot;The Golden Fleece will stop Kronos&quot;. I am not hopeful.<br><br>I suppose I&#39;ll still see it, though.</p>

            <p>Well, I think I&#39;ve mostly fixed my spellcheck problem although there might be some errrorss. <br>On to my idea, which is this: We get a whole bunch of PPC agents from a variety of fandoms. We then make a big list of who&#39;s in which fandom, sorted by the ones which get updated more often. Then, we email all the agents a list saying which fandoms they are to monitor and check for badfic. Logically, the bigger fandoms will have more people watching. The group in one fandom will get all of the other group members emails so they can communicate. And we will be able to find all badfics methodically.<br>Speaking of which, I found a horrible HP fanfic. Becoming Female.<br><br>~Kitty</p>

            <p>As a hopeless dingbat of an INFP, I don&#39;t compute well with organization. Or &quot;statistics and hard logic.&quot; But who needs logic anyway? Point being, it&#39;s not my place to decide that sort of thing, but it sounds awfully formal, a little bit contradictory to the general hectic siliness of the PPC that makes it so endearing. Since it&#39;s hardly plausible that we&#39;ll be able to spork every badfic in the world- even every badfic in a popular fandom would be a feat of unfathomably epic proportions- couldn&#39;t everyone just patrol the fandoms they&#39;re interested when they feel like writing a mission? Report the rarer abominations that are so horribly eye-bleeding that they cannot go unchallenged? Wouldn&#39;t that just be simpler?<br>Maybe I&#39;m just not processing the more advanced thinking behind this, but that&#39;s my thoughts. Meh, it&#39;s an old thread anyway.<br><br>-- Len</p>

            <p>Just took a glance at the story (actually, at the chapter titles). Is this writer for real, because there is no way that any halfway-educated person can write that badly unless it&#39;s on purpose. Trollfic, maybe?</p>

            <p>But as it turns out, the writer updates her online persona in such a way and with an amount of effort that it&#39;s hard to believe a troll would go for.

            <p>HOW can someone write so badly?<br><br>Certain spelling errors, I can understand; a Suethor can be so in a hurry to publish that she just posts without spellchecking.

            <p>It still needs missioning at somepoint. The way I see it, there are three stages of reaction to a fic this bad: the horrified stage, the numb stage, and the stage of stunned pain just beyond both of them. Sounds like you just reached the numb stage, but I think I&#39;m at stage three. Unless there is a stage four, where you go more numb and slightly detached and amused?<br><br>*Gibbers incoherently before scrambling for the bleepolate.*</p>

            <p>The first one... Well, in the summary we are cheerily informed that &quot;Sophie&quot; was kind of short and teased because she had brown hair and an Irish accent.<br>Here&#39;s an excerpt: &quot;&quot;Hey, are you okay? And what is a human doing so near to the Shire?&quot; Weird memories of a world beyond the Grey Havens, and its destruction, came to her and made her feel momentarily offended. She brushed her dark brown hair out of her deep green eyes and her Irish accent became very noticeable.<br>&quot;I&#39;m not a human, my race has no name, and as I said before, I am lost.&quot; She told them. They nodded,<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; Kili spoke up, &quot;You can travel with us. We are heading for Hobbiton where we might be able to get you directions home.&quot;Sophie sighed.<br><br>&quot;My home shattered and burned. The Spire of Glass was collapsed, and the wooden homes burned to the ground.&quot; This information was provided by her Middle Earth memories, her Earth memories telling her that this was all fake, but she played along.&quot;<br><br><br>The second one is a good argument against slash, featuring a particularly mind-bending love triangle between Elrond, Bilbo, and Thorin. The writing is so machine gun paced that it makes my head spin. And the whole thing is one paragraph.<br>And another excerpt: &quot;Radagast and Gandalf start talking and then Radagast takes off on his rabbits. &quot;We need to go now!&quot; Gandalf says. &quot;We can&#39;t! We have no ponies, they bolted!&quot; Ori yells and we all freak out. &quot;We need to hurry. This way now!&quot; Gandalf says and starts running. We take off running and trying to stay out of the Warg&#39;s sight. We end up being surrounded and Gandalf pops up behind some boulders. &quot;This way, you fools!&quot; he shouts, and we all slide down the rocks&quot;</p>
