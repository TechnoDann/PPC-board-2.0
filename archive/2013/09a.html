        <div class="post-body">
            <p> I got into a discussion recently with a friend about the differences between magic and technology, in the context of why I researched <a href="http://admiralsakai.deviantart.com/art/Thinking-About-SF-0-The-Galactic-Era-329538739">Galactic Age</a> so thoroughly. Together, we made a couple of very interesting points, which I will summarize here.</p> <p> I was the first to point out that in a lot of the more well-thought-out fantasy universes (including my own aborted Thinking About Fantasy series), arcane magic is really just that universe's form of technology: mages <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticScience">study the natural laws of their universe</a>, which are <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">logically consistent</a> despite being radically different from our own, learn how they operate through experimentation and hypothesis (science), and then figure out how to exploit those predicable behaviors to bring the "forces of nature" under human control (engineering). So while the result is something that looks radically different from the real world's technology, it is <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic">fundamentally the same process</a>.</p> <p> Sam agreed, and mentioned that in a lot of "less-well-researched" science-fiction settings, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodScience">technology operates more like magic</a>: put a bunch of wires and glowy bits together, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReversePolarity">push some random buttons</a>, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Mohs/ScienceInGenreOnly">and presto</a>- it's a laser gun! <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalParticleAccelerator">Or maybe a microwave?</a> We don't know, and don't bother trying to understand how it works, you're either <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoWizard">a scientist who can make anything out of anything</a> with the proper application of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble">technobabble</a>, or you're just hopelessly out of luck.</p> <p> This was a major idea. But it doesn't tell the whole story. Yes, there's <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness">levels of logical consistency/intensity</a> that span multiple genres, but those genres themselves are also qualitatively distinct things- "magic" and "technology" are more than just levels of nitpicking. That's why I've created a <i>two</i>-dimensional classification system: logical sense and nonsense are referred to as "hardness" or "softness", respectively, and are separate from what we will be discussing as our main point today: features of the "magical" as opposed to the "technological."</p> <p><br></p> <ul>
<li>
<p><b>Basis:</b> Probably the aspect of magic/technology tied the closest to hardness and softness is that of which physical laws the setting obeys. In hard technological settings, the physical laws of the fictional world are the same as ours, and soft technological settings at least put on an attempt to seem that way as well. In hard magical settings, however, the laws are often very, very different from ones that we are familiar with (no chemical elements or subatomic particles, maybe even no Newtonian motion), and in soft magical settings they likely do not exist at all. Seeing a hard setting, with radically different physical laws, that still looks technological, is very rare. However, this isn't a reliable metric because it can break down entirely in soft settings.</p> </li>
<li>
<p><b>Objects Vs. People:</b> It's surprisingly consistent: technology relies on objects to function, whereas magic needs human intervention. In a technological setting, even though a person is often involved in the process of doing Cool Things, what they do is operate and control a <i>device</i><span> that actually manipulates the powers involved. In a magical setting, generally you actually need a mage to be there, casting the spells, and the "<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicWand">equipment</a>" that said mage uses is generally <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeOfNewt">minimal</a>. Occasionally in magic you will encounter constructs such as golems and enchanted objects that do Cool Things with little to no human intervention, but I </span><i>guarantee</i><span> you that said constructs will have been created by people, </span><i>without</i><span> the help of other devices.</span></p> </li>
<li>
<p><b><span>Corporeality:</span></b><span><span> Magic generally involves a great amount of incorporeal "glowy stuff": <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantRunes">instant runes</a>, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeometricMagic">summoning circles</a>, beams of light, apparitions and puffs of smoke, that sort of thing. Even when physical objects are used, they tend to generate at least one of the above when active. Technology, on the other hand, tends to rely much more on matter, or physical structure. There's <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerGlows">glowy stuff</a> there <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TronLines">as well</a>, but it's almost always <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolographicTerminal">emitted by</a>, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatrixRainingCode">contained within</a>, or <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeGraphicalRepresentation">attached to</a> a sizable chunk of hardware.</span></span></p> </li>
<li>
<p><b><span>Accessibility:</span></b><span><span> Tying into the corporeality and object/person dichotomies, technology can often be mass-produced to make it accessible to the everyday person. With magic, that is often not the case. Depending on the setting, magic may be vanishingly rare and disbelieved entirely by most people, but the </span></span><i><span>most</span></i><span><span> accessible it seems to get is to have some enchanted weapons, potions, etc. purchasable the general population, as well as occasional mages who are about as accessible as chip designers or other highly-educated professionals in a technological society. Any more than that, and the setting starts to seem like <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">a hybrid of magical and technological</a> rather than just more sophisticated magic.</span></span></p> </li>
<li>
<p><b><span>Structure: </span></b><span><span>In conjunction with the above, technology seems to generate new materials (especially metals) that fall into active use in the next generation of technology. Magical neomaterials are rare, and not often used for building.</span></span></p> </li>
<li>
<p><b><span>Shape:</span></b><span><span> One of the easiest ways to make something look magical or technological is the way it's shaped: technology tends to have either smooth lines or right angles with lots of geometric shapes, while magic is </span></span><i><span>generally</span></i><span><span> more squiggly. Except for circles. <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeometricMagic">Magic likes circles for some reason.</a></span></span></p> </li>
<li>
<p><b><span>Character Sets:</span></b><span><span> This one is actually kind of strange, but oddly persistent. Technology tends to be numerical- everything encountered has measurements associated with it ("Warp core power at 53% and rising!"), science is done with math and equations, and of course computers <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroesAndOnes?from=Main.OnesAndZeroes">spout nonsensical strings of binary</a> if you so much as look at them funny. Magic on the other hand, is much more literary-based. There are of course a bunch of spells and spellbooks involved, but the instant runes are also, well, runes, the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagiBabble">magibabble</a> is much more object-oriented, and the standard image of magical research involves the wizard browsing through hundreds of old tomes in some arcane library (as opposed to the chalkboard-of-equations setup in science).</span></span></p> </li>

            <p>I&#39;ve played around with the level of &#39;hardness&#39; in magic myself; my own preferred magic system has a limited number of spells, each of which is accessed by tactile sensation. In simple terms, if you (ie, anybody) feels the right pattern of ridges, you cast the spell.<br><br>That&#39;s a science, even if no-one knows how it works. For plot reasons, though, I&#39;ve had to shift it into something entirely magical: there are a limited number of spells, each of which is cast in an entirely random way, and only by people who are capable of casting magic. Of course, since the beings working with the magic still verge toward the science end of the spectrum, they find it incredibly frustrating that there&#39;s no pattern to how it works.<br><br>And another distinction... you mention &#39;Objects Vs. People&#39;, but there&#39;s also the matter of <b>belief</b>. A fair number of magic systems (not all, but lots) require the caster to <i>believe</i> the spell will work, or at least to put some indefined form of willpower into it. Technology, on the other hand, will work whether you think it will or not.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t mean to be a pedant (although I very much am), but technically what you&#39;ve done is make the magic &quot;softer&quot;, not more magical. This particular dissertation mentions hardness and softness, but doesn&#39;t really go into detail. A lot of people do confuse hard/soft with magic/tech, which is partially why I wrote it. Of course, I&#39;m demonstrating quite a bit of hubris by taking it onto myself to define what is magic and what is technology, but then all mathematics starts with arbitrarily defining something useful and then improving it over time.<br><br>Also, great point about the &quot;belief&quot; issue. It, and the idea of certain people having an inborn gift to use magic while other people are Muggles, do indeed seem to show up a lot more often in magical settings, probably because of the person-focused nature, and while it tends to show up in softer settings as opposed to harder ones, it is EXTREMELY rare in technology.</p>

            <p>I guess the point you&#39;re making is that you can treat either magic or technology as a science - it can still be &#39;magic&#39; if you follow a precise formula to achieve the same results every time, according to a known pattern, just as it can still be technology if you use a wishy-washy, &#39;you have to get a feel for it!&#39; approach.

            <p>Also, just to better bring your point home, I&#39;ll make an example of a continuum where magic and technology are deeply intertwined: Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha.<br><br>Here, magic is cast with the help of portable advanced computers (called Devices) and is no more and no less than a science, to the point that spells are cast through mathematic calculations and magical constructs are referred as &quot;programs&quot;. Mana is basically just a form of energy as any else.</p>

            <p>As you and KittyEden have pointed out, there&#39;s a load of examples of people mucking about with magic, often making it more technological. But what about the opposite? Can we take technology and make it act more like magic?<br><br>Well, actually, I guess the PPC has already done that. There is a <i>faint</i> technological basis to the portal generators (they take written plotholes and inject them into the Words), but they... well, actually, let&#39;s go through AdmiralSakai&#39;s list and see where PPC technology falls on the &#39;tech-magic&#39; scale.<br><br>-Basis: While the basic laws of physics are the same as ours, PPC tech is very much influenced by the Laws of Narrative Comedy. In the real world, excess punctuation does not fall as rain, and portals cannot be created by bad writing. <b>Magic</b><br><br>-Objects Vs. People: While a lot of the weird stuff that happens to PPCers just happens, all the &#39;technology&#39; - the things that give them special abilities - is object based. This even applies to things that originally <i>weren&#39;t</i>: the &#39;canon shields us from view&#39; has given way to an electronic SEP field. <b>Tech</b><br><br>-Corporeality: No contest here. Portals, CADs, all the good stuff - it&#39;s all either a hunk of metal, or (in the case of portals) emitted by one. <b>Tech</b><br><br>-Accessibility: I&#39;m not sure on this one. PPC technology is mass-produced - but it seems to be mass-produced by one person, or at least a small group (DoSAT). What distinction do you draw between freely-available magic swords, and freely-available personal computers? Sure, one&#39;s magic, one&#39;s technological, but they&#39;re both equally accessible.<br><br>-Structure: The PPC has a fair number of neomaterials - Generic Surface, Concrit - but they&#39;re not produced technologically. They come out of the altered laws of physics, I suppose.<br><br>-Shape: Yeah, all right, PPC tech is very angular. <b>Tech</b><br><br>-Character Set: Can I just say, this is one of the more interesting things you&#39;ve highlighted. I think again PPC tech is, well, technological - CADs give nice percentage readouts, for instance, and you have to punch in coordinates to get somewhere. <b>Tech</b><br><br>So apparently I&#39;m wrong: PPC technology is <i>not</i> very magical. It&#39;s straight technology - just in a world with different rules.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>We have a fair history of people using their willpower to manipulate the story while on the job. I guess if you limit your analysis to the technology itself - portal generators, CADs - then it&#39;s all technology... but that&#39;s a self-selecting criterion. I reckon if you pull in things like Agent Lou talking to her author, the DTE suffering from (and occasionally weaponising) punctuation rain, spontaneously-appearing minis, various ex-Sue agents who use their Sue abilities to warp the story, the Laws of Narrative Comedy, <i>manipulating</i> the Laws of Narrative Comedy, etc etc etc... then I think the setting swings more towards magic.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Oooh, I love the Artemis Fowl series!<br><br><br>Both of these examples, by the way, introduce a somewhat &quot;fuzzy&quot; concept to my neat two-dimensional grid, namely the mixing of magic and technology. This is more or less independent of hardness/softness, so I&#39;ll just ignore that element and note that there are two different ways to &quot;mix&quot; magic and technology, both of which can exist in the same setting.<br><br>The first is through magitech, where a single &quot;thing&quot; contains both magical and technological elements from the dichotomy categories above. A good example of this would be alchemy, which combines weird runes and archaic materials with laboratory glassware. While I&#39;m not familiar with the series, the Nyona example above seems like magitech. However, you can also have things that are clearly magical and things that are clearly technological coexisting in the same setting, as in Artemis Fowl (although if I recall, some Fairy technology can make use of magic).<br><br>Then you get into things like Clarke&#39;s third law and &quot;bamboo technology&quot;, and it becomes hard to tell what&#39;s magical and what&#39;s technological (although I prefer to think of both methods as ways to get magical-looking stuff into a technological setting without actually introducing magic itself or violating hardness with things that SEEM to break our laws of physics).</p>

            <p>Using the same spreadsheet technology as my occasional PPC Statistics posts, I thought it might be interesting to take a peek at what the PPC Board was doing on (approximately) this day in each year of its existence. It seems like it&#39;d be fun to revisit past insanity, and who knows? Maybe in amongst this kaleidoscope of unfamiliar (and familiar?) names, we&#39;ll learn something, too.<br><br>For each year, I&#39;m going to give a few figures, summarise the topics under discussion on the Front Page, and list everyone who posted on that page. I will <b>bold</b> anyone who is still active - which in practice, translates as &#39;who posted in July 2013&#39;. I may underline particularly significant names - but I&#39;ll avoid just underlining everyone I recognise. ;) (Oh, and I won&#39;t highlight anyone for this month - that would be silly)<br><br>Oh, and

            <p>I think the primary reason for longer conversations is two reasons. ;) Okay:<br><br>1/ The speed of new thread formation. In 2003 we got through the front page in <i>21 hours</i>. That means there was no chance of a long thread forming. Nowadays we tend to keep threads active until they&#39;re about halfway down the front page - in 2003, those same threads would have been five pages back already! Note that the <i>frequency</i> of posts is down by a factor of 4 from 2003 - we said a lot more then, we just had less time to say it in!<br><br>2/ We aggregate threads a lot more these days. 2002 shows this very clearly - they had 8 badfic threads, almost half the front page! Nowadays we clump those together.<br><br>3/ Did I say two?<br><br>4/ Newbies. The early years had one newbie per front page, more or less. This year, we had 5. Newbie threads often garner a lot of replies. This isn&#39;t, obviously, a bad thing - but it does skew the figures a bit.<br><br>That said, it is an interesting phenomenon. I wonder to what extent it would drop out if we applied some sort of standardisation to the dataset - perhaps classing all badfic posts under one &#39;thread&#39;, and removing all newbie posts from consideration. I might take a look at that - purely for giggles.<br><br>hS<br><br>(Also - you probably were around in &#39;09. Bear in mind, this is just the people who posted on one particular page - Kaitlyn doesn&#39;t appear in two of the three-ish years she was active, for example, because she simply didn&#39;t post at the right time)</p>

            <p>... or, actually: Can We <b>Start</b> Adapting Things?<br><br>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s escaped no-one&#39;s notice that the film world is obsessed with adaptations and sequels. I guess that&#39;s been true for a long time, but I think it&#39;s become much more prevalent lately. And, actually, that&#39;s great - seeing something you loved as a book turned into a film is brilliant, and if you watch the film first, then you have a book to look forward to. Okay, good.<br><br>But... well, it&#39;s great <i>in theory</i>. In practice, filmmakers seem to have a fanatical aversion to just <i>adapting</i> books: they always want to change them.<br><br>To use some <i>Lord of the Rings</i> examples: I&#39;m not talking about cuts and changes made for the sake of time. I would dearly love to see a 100% faithful filming of the entire book, but I accept that wouldn&#39;t be something you could sell. So yes, Tom Bombadil goes, a lot of the complexity gets stripped out - it&#39;s painful, but some things have to happen.<br><br>But then you have things they added. Things like Faramir trying to take Frodo and Sam to Minas Tirith, or Flaming Denethor, or Sam turning around outside Shelob&#39;s lair. Those aren&#39;t time-saving, or complexity-reduction - they&#39;re a simple case of the filmmaker saying &#39;I know better than the writer I&#39;m adapting&#39;.<br><br>And it&#39;s not just <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. When they filmed <i>The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</i>, they inexplicably made it into a film about a quest to collect seven magical swords and destroy a... sentient dark cloud, or whatever was going on there at the end. And for me, that ruined the film. <i>Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief</i> got turned into a multi-part quest too for some reason (specifically &#39;find the three magical pearls!&#39;, because... what, them being a gift was too complicated?), and that ignores the multiple other issues with it. <i>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</i> acquired a whole new villain out of nowhere, despite the fact that pretty much every chapter already <i>has</i> an antagonist. And I&#39;m sure there are other examples - these are just the ones on the tip of my brain.<br><br>So this is my question, I guess: not &#39;Can we stop making adaptations?&#39;, but, &#39;Why can&#39;t people START adapting books, rather than changing them?&#39;. Why can&#39;t they accept that, if they&#39;re filming a popular book, their job is (or should be) to come as close to the original as possible with the resources they have?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I mean, I liked the Harry Potter and LotR/Hobbit movies significantly more than the books. And these are book series I read multiple times as a child.<br><br>On the other hand, World War Z was awful.

            <p>First off, let me say that I agree with your major points.  Cutting for time, Peter Jackson being bad at this, etc.  All of your points are well made.  We could argue about the merits of some of the changes, but that is not what I want to talk about.<br><br>What I would like to point out is that there is an element missing in this discussion.  And that is Medium.  We see a fairly large number of Book to Movie adaptations, and those are usually the big names.  However, we also have Graphic Novels, Television shows, and the occasional Musical Theatre adaptation.  Each of these mediums have their strengths and their weaknesses.<br><br>Books:  You want information and detail?  Books have that in spades.  You want a story that you can experience in less than 4 hours?  Not so much.  A book can be as long as the author wants because you can put it down if you need to go to work or something.<br><br>Movies:  Want to experience an epic story in less than 4 hours?  Done and done.  Want to know what your characters are thinking?  Not so good for that.  Movies are great for a condensed story, and  for being allowing you to <i>see</i> the action.  However, they come with a time limit, so something is going to have to go.<br><br>TV Show:  Want a half-way point between movies at books?  This is the medium for you.  TV shows, whether full or mini series, can have greater length than movies, while still keeping many of the benefits.  They also allow for more detail, though not as much as books.<br><br>Graphic Novels:  Allow for the length that books enjoy, though somewhat less detail, while still allowing you to see what is going on.<br><br>Musicals:  I don&#39;t even know.<br><br><br><br>So, the big problem, I feel, is that people do not consider the medium when adapting a book.  If you go from a book to a movie, you are going from the least compressed medium to the most compressed.  The change is not likely to be smooth unless you really know what you are doing.  Book to TV, however, is going from the least compressed to a moderately compressed medium.  The transition is likely to be more forgiving.<br><br>If they decide to go straight from book to video, then some big changes might be called for.  For example, I have a friend who absolutely hated the recent adaptation of World War Z, because it was nothing like the book.  When I read the book, I couldn&#39;t understand her hatred.  It was unreasonable to expect that the movie would be a guy interviewing 30-ish people after the Zombie War.  There wasn&#39;t the time, and there wasn&#39;t any good way to do it.  An adaptation would have been terrible.  So they didn&#39;t make one.  They made a movie inspired by the book.  In order to make a true adaptation, they would have had to make it into a mini-series style mockumentary.<br><br>There is something to be said for just not making something, though.  I have several books/series that I think would make terrible movies.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>There are two sides to this, which I&#39;m not sure you&#39;re acknowledging (if you are, sorry for assuming).<br><br>The first side:<br><br>I agree with everything you said about Percy Jackson. I was so mad about that movie. Sea of Monsters was marginally better, but still pretty bad. I really think in this case, they let money dictate creative decisions and now it&#39;s screwing them, because they alienated all the fans. <br><br>And I have to say, the more I think about it, the more I don&#39;t like the Star Trek reboot. Too many lens flares, too sexist, too much action. Also, comparing it to DS9, which I&#39;m about halfway through at the moment, is no contest. And DS9&#39;s the one with less fans. *shakes head*<br><br>And sequels can be very bad, especially when the movie was meant as a stand alone. So I too am wary of them.<br><br>However...<br><br>The other side:<br><br>I think a lot of these examples are actually really good adaptations. LOTR changed things and added things, yes, but those things were (for the most part) good. Arwen gets character development. The Ring tempts everyone. The long hobbit birthday party gets trimmed down. People actually talk like people talk. I was annoyed at some of the overly long fight scenes in ROTK, though, and would have liked to see more Faramir/Eowyn and the &quot;hands of a king are the hands of a healer&quot; scene. But overall, I think they&#39;re quite good.<br><br><i>Voyage of the Dawn Treader</i> was a very episodic book. It would have worked better as perhaps a miniseries. To adapt it to a movie, they <i>had</i> to give it an overarching plotline. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen it, but I remember it working.<br><br><i>The Hobbit</i> - well, three parts is a bit much, but the book is, on the whole, unimpressive cinematically. I was rereading it in preparation for the movie and was actually craving eggs and bacon because Bilbo mentioned them so much. That&#39;s not the tone you want for a movie that&#39;s set in the same &#39;verse as LOTR. So I understand why they did a lot of what they did. They went a bit far (like I said, <i>three parts</i>), but they had to do <i>something</i>.<br><br>And also, some sequels are good. <i>The Wrath of Khan</i> is better that <i>The Motion Picture</i>. Everyone I&#39;ve talked to loves <i>Iron Man 3</i>. TNG, DS9, and Voyager are excellent series. <br><br>And we can all agree that the Harry Potter and Hunger Games adaptations are (at least so far with Hunger Games) really good? They have their flaws, but so do everything.<br><br><br>I guess what I&#39;m trying to say here is that I don&#39;t see a trend towards making bad adaptations and sequels. There are lots of bad sequels and adaptations, but there are also good ones, and I really can&#39;t say that there are more or less, or that the trend swings one way or another.</p>

            <p>To sit solely in my favourite example, LotR, you... actually, I&#39;m going to run through your examples one by one, because they hit some points I&#39;d like to/tried to make.<br><br>-Arwen gets character development. Well, her character certainly &#39;develops&#39;, but since that development is from &#39;fearless sword-girl&#39; to &#39;does everything Daddy says even when it&#39;s stupid&#39; to &#39;ODE MARRIAGE MAKES CHILDREN!?!?&#39;, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a positive... ;) But yes, she gets screentime, and given that the romance is a significant (if not major) part of the plot, I have no problem with that. My problem with the treatment of Arwen is that it was wildly <i>inconsistent</i> - and pretty darn illogical in places. (As I&#39;ve seen mentioned recently, the way she talks in her introduction, she knew Frodo was deathly ill - so why was it she decided to start out by playing &#39;Let&#39;s put a sword to the North&#39;s greatest fighter&#39;s throat and hope he doesn&#39;t kill me before he knows who I am&#39;?)<br><br>-The Ring tempts everyone. This seems to fall into two categories. On the one hand, we have scenes like Boromir picking it up on Caradhras, and various &#39;hey look it talks&#39; scenes. These, I have no problem with. On the other hand, you have Faramir. Who, apparently, they did the whole &#39;let&#39;s show my quality by kidnapping!&#39; thing to show that everyone is tempted by the Ring. Only... two things. No, three:<br><br>1) That is a perfect example of &#39;I know better than that &#39;Tolkien&#39; bloke&#39;. JRRT specifically wrote Faramir as <i>not</i> giving in to temptation. It&#39;s not like it never came up - the character faced exactly the same dilemma, and the canonical version did the opposite to the film version. To me, that feels very much like the scriptwriter thinking they can write stories better than the person they&#39;re adapting - which was a major part of what I was complaining about.<br><br>2) Faramir <i>didn&#39;t</i> give into temptation. We know what the Ring tempts people to do - take it, by force if necessary, and use it themselves. Not take it to their father.<br><br>3) Even ignoring the way they got there, Frodo and Sam being in Osgiliath opened up a slew of plotholes which never got closed. First, they ended up walking further after, without Faramir ever giving them the extra food they needed - and given that the <i>lembas</i> got chucked away later, the films should have ended with two Hobbits starving to death. But secondly, <i>a Nazgul saw the Ring was there</i>. Sauron launched an all-out assault on Gondor, ahead of schedule, because he <i>suspected</i> Aragorn had the Ring. Why didn&#39;t he throw everything he had at Osgiliath as soon as the Nazgul detected Frodo? For that matter, why didn&#39;t he connect the dots once he captured a short person in Cirith Ungol? The side-trip to Osgiliath, triggered by &#39;I can write Faramir better than Tolkien&#39;, was not well-written, and its consequences were ignored.<br><br>-The long hobbit birthday party gets trimmed down. And that&#39;s good! Or at least acceptable. Like I said, I understand that it&#39;s a different medium; things have to be cut, and tweaked around to make the cuts make sense. I&#39;m not actually sure it <i>was</i> cut that much: mostly the book just tells us what has already happened, and we did end up with long sequences involving Merry and Pippin. But yes, things were cut, and when they&#39;re not significant to the plot, or can be worked around, that&#39;s okay.<br><br>-People actually talk like people talk. And again, that&#39;s adaptation for you. What works on the page doesn&#39;t always work on the screen (and vice versa), so of course they had to tweak and change the lines. I don&#39;t object to that, or to other changes made to make the thing filmable! What I object to - strongly - is changes made for no good reason, which aren&#39;t well thought-out, and which serve only to promote the filmmaker&#39;s &#39;vision&#39; as more important than the author&#39;s.<br><br>(And to head off a potential point - yes, I&#39;m sure there <i>are</i> screenwriters who are better writers than the authors they&#39;re adapting. That&#39;s not the point. If you&#39;re <i>adapting</i> something, you try to make something close to the source - or you should)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I actually don&#39;t mind (too much) that they changed Annabeth&#39;s hair colour - it&#39;s entirely non-plot-relevant. Similarly, they cast the Norse god Heimdall as black in <i>Thor</i> - and he was really good.<br><br>Yes, I suppose that appearance should be looked into, although a lot of it can be changed by makeup (Legolas was played by Orlando Bloom who has entirely different hair and eye colour); that said, it usually won&#39;t spoil a movie if it&#39;s the only problem.<br><br>That also said, I have major problems with movie!Annabeth in general. We just saw <i>Sea of Monsters</i>, and, er... why did I come out of the cinema liking Clarisse-daughter-of-Ares about ten times more than Annabeth-the-other-main-character? Annabeth spent all her time glowering and not being wise (you know, which as a daughter of Athena is sort of her point), while Clarisse - who in that book is a vicious, ungrateful bully - was all smiles. I could see <i>her</i> as Annabeth, no problem.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>And in this case, that almost certainly <i>was</i> the reason. They couldn&#39;t be bothered to get Annabeth&#39;s hair right, so why should we have expected them to use a Greek depiction of Hades? It&#39;s so much less hassle to just make it into a fiery Hell instead, right? I mean, honestly, do those fans think we&#39;re out to <i>adapt the book</i> or something? Pfft, who does that &#39;Rich Riddorian&#39; person think he is, anyway?<br><br>Er, sorry, got distracted there. My point was... did I have a point?<br><br>Oh, yes. I think the &#39;couldn&#39;t even be bothered&#39; thing was the point of my original post, really - as in, if you&#39;re not going to bother doing it properly, why bother at all? But in the specific case of appearance... I don&#39;t think we&#39;d complain about Annabeth&#39;s hair <i>if</i> the rest of the film was good. It&#39;s one of those complaints, like Philosopher at Large writing an essay about how the Black Ships at Minas Tirith were <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090614045840/http://oddlots.digitalspace.net/arthedain/dromonds.html">Dromonds, Not Junks</a> - it&#39;s a good point, and it <i>is</i> irritating, but if the movie had been good otherwise, we wouldn&#39;t be too bothered about it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... That goes along the lines of &quot;If you wanted to watch an accurate adaption of a book, go read the book!&quot;.

            <p>(I&#39;ll try and cram these into some kind of structure, so be warned: Here Be Lists)<br><br>1/ Mary-Sues are of course not defined by their appearance. There are almost certainly millions of blonde/blue characters who aren&#39;t &#39;Sues - and equally many &#39;Sues who don&#39;t have blonde hair! For that matter, what self-respecting &#39;Sue would have an eye colour as boring as &#39;blue&#39;? Now, if &#39;Aryan&#39; meant &#39;and I mean like with these really vivid purple orbs only when she gets angry they glow red&#39;...<br><br>2/ I know you weren&#39;t, but let&#39;s be careful not to compare &#39;Sues - or, especially, Suethors - to Nazis.<br><br>3/ Hitler, of course, doesn&#39;t pre-date fanfiction. Fanfic is <i>ancient</i>. To pick a random (and if you can believe it, relatively modern) example, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid">Aeneid</a>, by Virgil, is fanfiction of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad">Iliad</a> - and is over two thousand years old! I&#39;ll leave it to someone who&#39;s read the thing to decide whether Aeneas is a Gary-Stu...<br><br>4/ Coming round eventually to your original idea... what if Mary-Sues existed before they were a common feature in fanfic? What if, indeed, a society on Earth (or a canon world) dedicated itself to breeding them?<br><br>A few thoughts:<br><br>-The League of Mary-Sue Factories, along with a number of other groups in the Multiverse (there&#39;s a city somewhere named Sparklee...), are doing just that: producing &#39;Sues, one way or another, and sending them into fanfic. The League have used them to attack the PPC on occasion. Sparklee, actually, goes even further - it&#39;s set up as a city-state populated entirely by &#39;Sues and &#39;Stus, pretty much exactly like you&#39;re thinking of.<br><br>-For that matter, the Mirror Multiverse Enforcers of the Plot Continuum (EPC) are doing much the same thing - building a society of &#39;Sues, and attempting to conquer everything else. They&#39;re a dictatorship with no regards for morality or ethics, so I&#39;m sure Nazi parallels have been drawn...<br><br>-What I&#39;m not sure anyone has written is a society of normal people which - by choice or by external/dictatorial force - <i>turns itself into</i> a nation of &#39;Sues. It could be an interesting story, indeed - but I wonder how hard it would be? After all, Mary-Sues, by occasional definition, aren&#39;t exactly well-rounded characters - and aren&#39;t (usually!) intentional villains. Writing a story about &#39;Sues taking over, while ensuring the &#39;Sues can keep their own worldview (how they are the best thing ever to happen to everything) intact... it would be a big challenge.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Sort of a Shrödinger&#39;s cat situation, except instead of existing as anything between two options and solidifying if it&#39;s observed, it can only be solidified if the move is used, and the boxes <i>themselves</i> exist in a state of flux between existence and non-existence, at least until removed from Delibird&#39;s pouch.<br>With the way it thumbs its nose at physics like that, I&#39;d almost say Delibird might be the proxy of some sort of chaos-loving extradimensional entity. I might say that, but then I would open up to whether Blastoise would be subject to a similar entity that allows it to store a nigh-infinite amount of Hydro Cannon water within a finite amount of body space, or whether the Miltank, Pikachu or what have you that learned Present from a Delibird father is also tied to a similar otherworldly being. It&#39;s probably best to just roll with the Pokémon universe&#39;s unusual treatment of the nature of matter. You&#39;ll be saner that way.</p>

            <p>Dear all,<br><br>Following the recent disappearence of former DOGA Agent Selene [...] Windflower from her padded room in FicPsych, we have naturally been keeping an eye out for her across the multiverse. Recently, one of DOGA&#39;s other agents claimed to have encountered her on a mission:<br><br>&quot;I almost tripped over her in the woods. She didn&#39;t look happy to see me. I mean, really unhappy - glowing red eyes and everything.&quot;<br><br>When questioned further as to how he was able to identify former agent Selene, the agent responded:<br><br>&quot;Well, I recognised her, you know? Like you do with people you... recognise?&quot;<br><br>This agent&#39;s lack of cooperation has been noted.<br><br>To aid in identification of this potentially distressed, possibly dangerous escapee, we have compiled an artist&#39;s impression from our informant&#39;s description.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/ArtistImpression.png"><br><br>~Agent Irvine<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Irvine,<br><br>You&#39;re just embarassing yourself further. Agent Huinesoron was drunk and spouting nonsense. Leave the report writing to me in future.<br><br>-Black<br><br>PS: And learn to draw.</p>

            <p>Oh no! Selene Windflower&#39;s insanity has advanced to such a state that her torso has been absorbed into her head! I didn&#39;t even know that was possible! I&#39;m glad that the sketch artist used such a simplified style, since either her limbs have migrated to the top of her head or her hair has grown to enormous lengths and migrated around the front of her face to rearrange itself into a spiky fan-like structure, either of which would be horrible to look at, but to different extents and for different reasons.<br><br>Fortunately, she can&#39;t have gotten far. Giant heads like that can normally only propel themselves by hopping around comically, which has an incredibly slow movement rate. Unless she&#39;s learned to levitate or she&#39;s somehow gotten a hold of one of M.O.D.O.K.&#39;s spare pod-suit transport things, we should be perfectly safe. Perfectly safe from the psychopathic Pyro who may still have the ability to absorb living matter into her giant horrifying cranial mass.<br>...<br>I&#39;m going to check and make sure all of those spare pod-suits are still where they were a few days ago.</p>

            <p>(I know - whoever thought you&#39;d see a title like that from me? But bear with me)<br><br>In case you missed it, <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9130619/1/The-Official-Fanfiction-University-of-Discworld">The Official Fanfiction University of Discworld</a> a) exists, and b) ended on July 4th this year. If you&#39;re worried about spoilers, I recommend you go and read it before continuing, because I&#39;m about to discuss the sequel. Go ahead - I&#39;ll wait.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Wait.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Wait.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Wait.jpg"><br><br>Okay, here&#39;s the deal. Following their assault on OFUDisc, the Interdimensional Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Elves (Ispace) is on the rampage. They are well-trained and well-equipped, and they are out to prevent cruelty to elves.<br><br>Any elves.<br><br>Their current target is the Canon Protection Initiative - the PPC and the OFUs. They will fight to protect Mary-Sues (if they happen to be elves), OFU students (if they happen to be elves)... but also canons (ditto), OFU staff (ditto) and even agents (ditto, again). In one incident, they are known to have saved a &#39;Sue from the PPC (since she was an elf), but then kill her themselves (since she was causing harm to several canonical elves).<br><br>There are rumours of this going round HQ, with the result that (at least some) agents are getting... let&#39;s say over-zealous about canon protection. They are, basically, getting a bit paranoid - anyone in the Word World who isn&#39;t in the Words is an object of extreme suspicion, because they might be an Ispace operative.<br><br>All this is backstory and prologue for <i>The Ispace Wars</i>, the upcoming sequel to OFUDisc. This is <i>not</i> a PPC Emergency - it&#39;s actually remarkably small-scale, and HQ will never be under direct threat. But it&#39;s still something I need help with - quite a lot of help. So, as I said, I have some questions about Elves - and some requests.<br><br>Question #1: Which OFUs have elves in them? That includes not only staff members, but also any students who might have signed up as &#39;elves&#39;. The definition of &#39;elf&#39; being used by Ispace is very generous - it includes everything actually called by the name (including, say, House Elves), and anything which is clearly based on the concept (such as the various types of Space Elf - Vulcans, for instance).<br><br>Request #1: If you run an OFU with elves in it - can I invade you? Two chapters of <i>The Ispace Wars</i> will be an attack on an OFU, seen from the Ispace and OFU sides, and I&#39;d really like to co-write or at least consult with the OFU&#39;s author. Dr Huinesoron will be on hand to help out with the repulsion, and unlike OFUDisc, I have no intention of <i>closing down</i> an OFU. But I would like it to be a co-write.<br><br>Question #2: What fandoms are there that have both elves and a wiki or something I can steal information from? I need to write five (yes, 5) Mary-Sue badfics with elvish &#39;Sues, and I can&#39;t come up with the canons. Partly this is because of...<br><br>Request #2: Who wants to write a mission into a specially-written Mary-Sue story? I need two of my five badfics to be written as missions, and while I&#39;ll write them myself if I have to, I&#39;d much rather have other people do it. The way I see it working is for you to select a fandom and one of my five &#39;Sues, I write the story, and then you write a normal mission for it. One of these two missions will also involve a confrontation with Ispace, so that will turn into a true cowrite.<br><br>Request #3: Do you have a Trans-Dimensional Organisation of your own, like Ispace, the PPC, the League of Mary-Sue Factories and so on? If so, would you like them to be involved in the Ispace Wars, and signitories to the Accords afterwards? If so, great! I&#39;d love to discuss that with you and see if I can slot them in.<br><br>Request #4: Who&#39;s willing to be publicly humiliated? ;) I have need for a pair of agents who a) don&#39;t know Dafydd Illian by sight, b) would be among those feeling paranoid and suspicious about the Ispace rumours, and c) are willing to be humiliated (but NOT harmed in any way) on a mission in Middle-earth. Oh, and they need to NOT be cyborgs or otherwise electronic. This one is less of a co-write, more of a &#39;put the names in the slots and tweak the scene to fit the characters&#39; job, but it is still an important part of the story.<br><br>Catchall Request #5: At some point I will be in need of large numbers of PPC agents and OFU staff (with no connection to elves necessary). These will mostly be cameos, unless something really good comes up, but I&#39;d love as many as I can get. If you want to volunteer your characters, please do. No harm will come to them (unless you want it to?).<br><br>I realise there&#39;s a lot to read up there, but I&#39;m hoping you can get through it - I really need the help on this one. Thank you for reading, and if you can help - please reply!<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: I doubt it needs saying, but... any agents need Permission, of course. ~hS</p>

            <p>The species counted so far all seem to fit the more-or-less-a-human-with-pointy-ears model of elf, even if they, like the Vulcans or the Hylians, aren&#39;t elves by name, but there are other species referred to as elves that don&#39;t look the same as the standard elf does and don&#39;t behave in the standard elven manner.<br><br>What about the not-so-human elves, like the ones in Discworld or Harry Potter? I know those were based on the folkloric fey and the brownie repectively, and not the Tolkien elves, but that might mean they&#39;re even closer to the root of elfdom, since the Tolkien elves were originally based on the Norse folkloric &quot;light elves&quot;, or the &quot;Ljósálfar&quot;, according to Wikipedia. I&#39;m just going to trust its spelling there.<br><br>As for the human-style elves, do they need to be follow the traditional fantasy elf body structure, or does Ispace cover any humanoid elf in their definition? Because if they do, there are still all of the elves in the Christmas specials of the world to be considered, some of which have been very, very abused and are in need of protection. I&#39;m looking at you, vampire elves from The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. Mrs. Claus had no right to turn you into her vampiric thralls.</p>

            <p>Basically, as explained by Liliac in OFUDisc:<br><br><i>&quot;[Without Elves] the whole of fiction would fall apart,&quot; she said. &quot;We know – we&#39;ve checked. There&#39;s a universe where the most popular subject for fanfic is, I kid you not, The Sound of Music – which has been remade six times. That&#39;s what happens without elves – and it still could. [...] Cruelty to elves is lessening people&#39;s respect for the fantastic. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s an original character torturing Legolas or the PPC killing a Mary-Sue – it turns the immortal into a joke. And if we let that happen, the human imagination will die.&quot;</i><br><br>It seems that they aren&#39;t defending any particular type of elf - more the notion of &#39;elf&#39; in the human consciousness. So they&#39;ll defend House Elves (because they&#39;re called elves), and Santa&#39;s Elfs (because they&#39;re called elves), and anything which is referred to as an elf. They&#39;re a bit fundamentalist about the whole thing.<br><br>And yes, the places where this idea falls apart are part of the storyline of <i>The Ispace Wars</i>. I will probably address the issue of whether a character can be &#39;more elven&#39; than another, too.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>This... Could be interesting.<br><br>For cannons that have elves in them, let me suggest the Elder Scrolls seres. Oh lord above, do they have elves. You have Altmer, the high elves, who think themselves greater then all other races. The Bosmer, who live in the forests of Tamriel, and are masters of archery and sneaking through the undergrowth undetected. The Dunmer, dark elves who live in the volcanic wastelands of Morrowind. They worship the Daedra and are masters of summoning and have a special resistance to fire. Then the Osmer, the orcs, strong and stout, they stand among the strongest races in Tamriel. Then there&#39;s the Falmer, the Snow Elves, oh I could go on and on. Here, just look at these articles from the Elder Scrolls wiki, and you will see why it is important the Ispace visit this world: <br><a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Mer"><a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Mer">http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Mer</a></a><br><a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Third_Aldmeri_Dominion"><a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Third_Aldmeri_Dominion">http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Third_Aldmeri_Dominion</a></a> - These guys are a group of elves that are trying to commit the genocide of all the races of man and beast, then later find a way to destroy the world so they can re-claim their supposed lost divinity. Yeah. Not good people.<br><br>Next, if there is a multi-dimentional group I have created that would be involved with these guys. The answer is... Not really, but I do have Jumper, my namesake and character that can travel to fictional universes. His section of the multiverse acts differently from the PPC&#39;s multiverse, so he would be really invested in keeping them out of his sector. He will be/is a PPC agent, and may well run across the Ispase on his travels outside of the PPC. I would be honored if he gets to participate in this semi-event. If you want me to write out what he does or further discuss what his role may be in this, I would be happy to do so. Just be warned, I have a rather tight school schedule right now, so I may not be able to get his bits done for a while. Just a heads up.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I was intending on sending Jumper there too, once I introduced him.

I think all of the atronachs are out, as they look too much like regular elementals. Nothing that really says, &quot;That&#39;s so Skyrim!&quot; if you see what I mean.

            <p>The reason I thought mini-Daedra was because it would be cool if the type spawned depended on the kind of misspelling. That would leave room for a lot of fun minis... you might even get a  mini of one of the princes if you misspelled something really important, like the continuum. Otherwise, whoever finds a mini gets to pick from all the varieties of Daedra, even rarer ones. There would be a whole range of choices, like the Winged Twilight or Spider Daedra, Clannfear, Ogrim, Xivilai, Dremora, Scamp, any of the Atronachs, Hunger, Dark Seducer, Golden Saint, etc. That way you can encompass a lot, which is nice in such a vast continuum.<br><br>I can certainly see Sheogorath and the PPC being a right mixture, given all the crazy agents...</p>

            <p>Yeah, that makes sense. So if I were to, say, misspell the Shivering Isles as Sivring Ises, I would get a mini-Dark Seducer or Golden Saint. But if I misspell Dovahkiin as Dovakin, I would get a mini-Scamp or Flame Atronach. I like that idea.<br><br>Now I kinda want to make an agent who is from the Shivering Isles. Probably from Dementia, though a Manic may be interesting. Seeing how many demented agents we already have, one more aint gonna make any difference. Perhaps an Argonian, or a Dunmer.

            <p>... so you could have both, if you wanted. I daresay a Manic and a Demented would squabble like anything, and could be a hilarious pairing. (Alternatively, you could always visit the village of Split.)<br><br>The problem about the Elder Scrolls with choosing any one type of Daedra for the mini is that some types do not appear in all the games - Skyrim seems to be especially lacking in Daedra, certainly all the more continuum-specific ones (except perhaps the Seekers in the Dragonborn expansion).<br><br>The wiki currently states mini-Cliffracers as the Elder Scrolls mini, but it was under debate given that there does not seem to be a mission or an OFU for the continuum - and while Cliffracers are VERY annoying in Morrowind, they are extinct come the later games, so are not very representative of the continuum as a whole. I cannot see Daedra going extinct, somehow...<br><br>Oh, and the Ayleids. How could I forget them? I agree, ISPACE trying to prevent the fall of the Ayleids would cause a right mess - preventing the rise of the Empire for one.</p>

            <p>Warcraft has no fewer than 3 types of Elves (Night, High, and Blood Elves); more if you count the mutations (Naga, Harpies, Satyrs, Darkfallen).

            <p>You&#39;ve posted them once before, and I&#39;m still baffled. Except for the Starfleet insignia with a heart.

And honestly, I&#39;m not sure how much writing I can do, because Real Life is going to be piling stuff on me.<br><br>So bottom line: I would love to, but that depends on whether I can write anything while Real Life is happening.</p>

            <p>Since Desdendelle replied first, I&#39;ll hold off accepting your offer to write one of the missions until I know if he wants to do so, but for the humiliation - brilliant!

            <p>Q1) Other than the obvious (OFUM), I dunno, so I&#39;m not much help on this one :)<br><br>Q2) Well, Warhammer 40,000 has Space Elves (in <a href="http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Eldar">Good</a> and <a href="http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Dark_eldar">Evil</a> flavours), and Warhammer Fantsay offers <a href="http://whfb.lexicanum.com/wiki/High_Elves">three</a> <a href="http://whfb.lexicanum.com/wiki/Wood_Elves">different</a> <a href="http://whfb.lexicanum.com/wiki/Dark_Elves">flavours</a>. I&#39;ve also seen the <a href="http://james-camerons-avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Na'vi">Navi</a> be referred to as Elves in Space!, presumably because they have pointy ears and that whole &#39;living in harmony with nature&#39; thing. I&#39;m sure I read/watch plenty of other stuff with elves of some kind in, but I&#39;m stuck at work at the minute, so can&#39;t check my bookshelves. I&#39;ll get back to you if I can think of any other particularly good ones. <br><br>R2) Yeah, I&#39;d be up for writing a mission in a specifically created badfic, if you think my agents will work for what you want to achieve. <br><br>R3) Yes I do have my own Trans-Dimensional Organisation (or rather, I have ideas for them - one of these days I&#39;ll actually have to get around to writing about them), but then you knew that already. I can send you more details on them if you need it. <br><br>R4) I don&#39;t think my agents quite fit the bill here - while they wouldn&#39;t recognise Dafydd, I can&#39;t see them getting too worked about the rumours. After all, there are rumours floating round about an HQ Pool, and that&#39;s clearly nonsense!<br><br>R5) Sure, Skeet and Amy volunteer.</p>

            <p>After all the betaing work we&#39;ve been throwing back and forth - not to mention Kayleigh&#39;s adoption of Aunt Sam, and your interpretation of the Sundering - I&#39;d actually really like Skeet and Amy to make an appearance in <i>The Ispace Wars</i>. If you&#39;re up for it, I&#39;d like them to take on the mission which leads to a (non-lethal!) confrontation with Ispace - which will end up being three chapters, one each from the perspective of the Sue (ie, the badfic), the PPCers, and the Ispace team. I have no plans in place for the outcome - the only requirement is that the PPCers get back to HQ and pass the word that Ispace is interfering with missions.<br><br>(Actually, Skeet and Amy would work really well - because the person coordinating the slapdash information gathering effort is Kayleigh)<br><br>If you&#39;re still interested, let me know and I&#39;ll throw you an email.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Question #1) From the top of my head, I know that OFU of Azeroth has elves, OFUM has Elves (but of course), and the Hogwarts Fanfiction Academy has the House Elves (as you&#39;ve mentioned).<br>Request #1) I don&#39;t run an OFU.<br>Question #2) I won&#39;t bother with the more common fandoms, but here are wikis for <a href="http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page"><i>Forgotten Realms</i></a> and <a href="http://dragonlance.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page"><i>Dragonlance</i></a>. <a href="http://www.wesnoth.org/"><i>The Battle for Wesnoth</i></a><a> has no (up-to-date) wiki per se, but its site and fora are more than enough.<br>Request #2) Um... not sure. More details would be welcome. (Though if I&#39;ll accept it might force me to get off my lazy ass and actually write something longer than a post in a play-by-post RP...)<br>Request #3) Nope, don&#39;t have one.<br>Request #4) I&#39;ll pass on this one. Neither Agent!Des nor Anebrin are particularly paranoid.<br>Request #5) They&#39;re more than up for a cameo, however.<br></a></p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to write five single-chapter elven Mary-Sue badfics. Since they&#39;ll be deliberately (but not parody) bad, I don&#39;t actually need to know the canon that well - just, for example, what I can pick up by skimming the <i>Forgotten Realms</i> wiki (maybe writer!me saw a picture of Drizzt and thinks he&#39;s hott ;)).<br><br>But because, in the context of the story, these are real badfics which exist in the multiverse, there&#39;s a decent chance the PPC will come across them. So for two of them, the Department of Intelligence will write up a report and assign an agent team.<br><br>On the practical side, because I&#39;m writing the badfics to order, you (or whoever ends up doing it) gets to chose which of my four Sues they want to take down (they have named like Celia Bloodgage and Ravonia Darkmoor...), and also what canon you want to go into. Then I grit my teeth and write a bad story - one chapter long - and send it over for you to spork. Just like a normal mission, basically, with as little or as much writing as you choose.<br><br>My plan is then to post the badfic and the mission both as chapters of <i>The Ispace Wars</i>. All copyright to the mission would of course remain with the writer, and I&#39;d have no problem with you posting it with your own stuff as well - or with you not.<br><br>Was that useful detail or just me rambling?

            <p>Hello, everyone! Not too long ago, I have completed the Fallout/Mass Effect crossover, with the help of fellow co-author 4Ferelden, a frequent user on various Wiki sites, specifically Mass Effect and a few of the PPC users here. I would like to give my thanks to TopHatOfDoom, Caddy, and Leareth, among a few others.<br><br>Set years after the events of Fallout: New Vegas, the Courier was transported to the Mass Effect universe when an attempt at improving the Transportalponder&#39;s efficiency has gone awry. Soon after, he met Dr. Liara T&#39;Soni and Feron as he has gotten involved in the hunt for Commander Shepard&#39;s body before it falls to the hands of the Collectors.

            <p>About a year ago, we ran across a fundamentally awesome website called <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>. This is a site where you can take university-level courses, absolutely free! And by &#39;university level&#39;, I mean actual university professors from actual universities (as opposed to, say, the University of Power Cable, Nebraska) record audio-visual lecture courses running about 8-12 weeks, with (usually) weekly quizzes, and often some form of assignments or end-of-unit tests.<br><br>The sign-ups for each course tend to run into the tens of thousands, and at least in my experience, they always have very active forums, with teaching assistants to act as moderators and answer questions. For most courses all you &#39;get&#39; at the end is a certificate of completion, but I believe some offer a &#39;Signature Track&#39; which means the university will verify that you actually took the course.<br><br>Of course, what you <i>actually</i> get from the course is a heap of knowledge - in whatever subject you choose, for whatever reason you choose. The second course I did was Analytical Chemistry: Instrumental Analysis from Rice University. It was directly relevant to my job (I&#39;m an analytical chemist), so that was actually helpful.<br><br>My other two courses were purely for fun. I did Introduction to Astronomy with Duke University, and Archaeology&#39;s Dirty Little Secrets with Brown - which, I have to say, was <i>incredibly</i> good. Sue Alcock, the professor, put a heck of a lot of work into the course, and had a massive team. The course did a brilliant job of merging the theoretical and practical sides of archaeology, and if (when!) she runs it again, I highly recommend this course.<br><br>But enough about me. ;) Has anyone else done anything on Coursera, or any similar site? How did you find it? I&#39;ve had universally good experiences - how has it worked out for you?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I did a Coursera course in fantastic litterature. It was a very good experience, although I ended up not completing it. The amount of text I had to read each week ended up being too much, what with me having a full time job and also wanting to sleep every now and then.<br>But it did teach me a lot about looking for underlying themes in litterature. The &#39;thesis&#39; that every work is putting forth and defending.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not interactive like what you&#39;ve described, but there are a whole bunch of MIT lectures (and possibly stuff from other places too, I dunno, I didn&#39;t really look any further than the MIT stuff) that you can watch online. <br><br>They&#39;ve got videos of the full lecture courses for a range of topics available. <br><br>I watched the courses on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvDePn41fPY">Vibrations and Waves </a>and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3omwHv3Cmog">Electricity and Magnetism</a> to help me understand electromagnetism well enough to do some electromagnetic simulation work for my previous company, despite my background being purely mechanical engineering.  </p>

            <p>I guess one of the advantages of that approach is that you don&#39;t have to wait for the course to come around, and can do it in your own time. Additionally, I don&#39;t think the really big names like MIT are using Coursera much.<br><br>The advantages of Coursera are that you get assignments which are graded, and also the chance to interact with both other students and the course staff.

            <p>But in a way its biggest strength is its greatest weakness.<br><br>The fact that they&#39;re all up there, ready to view at any time you choose, is really helpful. And unlike real lectures, if you don&#39;t quite get a bit you can just rewind and watch it again. <br><br>But because it just passive viewing, with no kind incentive other than your own interest, it&#39;s <i>very&gt; easy to procrastinate and then just kind of forget about.

            <p>This sounds pretty interesting. But I will admit to some skepticism, mostly on the basis that 1. The classes are free and 2. There is no such thing as a &quot;free hug.&quot;<br><br>What you&#39;ve said sounds awesome, don&#39;t get me wrong, and I am tempted to look into these classes.

The fact that you typically can&#39;t get recognition from the university that &quot;hosted&quot; the class is a drawback, but for someone who just wants to learn things, it isn&#39;t much of one. </p>

            <p>I guess what that question really means is &#39;What do the universities get out of it?&#39;, which is a decent question.

            <p>I&#39;ve finished two courses on Coursea -- one about contraception (very light and fluffy), one on human physiology (kicked my butt).  I&#39;m taking -- hold on, counting on my fingers -- three at the moment?<br><br>Two are very quick to race through every week, one&#39;s a bit more time-consuming (global health).  And actually the Vaccines course, which is supposed to be just a couple of hours a week, is taking a *lot* more time than that just to keep up with all the smallpox-eradication deniers in the discussion forums.  People are crazy in the most unexpected directions these days.<br><br>I&#39;m also taking a course from edX, which is similar to Coursera.

            <p>And it may well be something I&#39;ll look into if I&#39;m ever not massively consumed with things. It used to be that I didn&#39;t think I could make myself do an online course, but I manage to do my online job, so maybe it&#39;s a possibility. How involved were the assignments in the courses you took? Homework has always been my big stumbling block.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It really does depend on the course. From what I&#39;ve seen, every course has tests/quizzes, and a fair number have peer assessment assignments. To run through my three examples:<br><br>-IntroAstro had no peer review stuff, but was a physics course. The weekly tests were stuffed with maths, and so took a <i>lot</i> of time - I think about two hours per week, and I&#39;m good at maths.<br><br>-Instrumental Analysis had two levels of quizzes - the simple &#39;were you watching the lecture&#39; type, which took about ten minutes each (two per week), and the more in-depth ones. Again, it was a science course, but chemistry - particularly instrumental chemistry - is way less maths-heavy than astronomy. I&#39;d say maybe an hour at most for those tests, but less on some weeks. It also had three &#39;peer assessed&#39; assignments, spaced out over the length of the course. These were basically essay question quizzes (the standard quizzes are usually either numerical or multiple-choice); I don&#39;t think they took that long, maybe 3-4 hours. Then you&#39;re required to mark some (peer assessment, remember?), but there&#39;s usually a decent grading rubric. Say an hour, hour and a half total per assignment.<br><br>-Archaeology had a weekly quiz which was entirely multiple-choice - basically just to check if you&#39;d watched the videos and read the links. They never took me more than 10 minutes. It <i>also</i> had weekly peer-reviews, &#39;Archaeological Exercises&#39;. We actually got to choose from three options each week, and the choices ranged from &#39;Find out about an archaeologist and write about the tools they had available&#39; to &#39;Make a 3D model of something&#39; to &#39;Write your name in Cuneiform&#39;.<br><br>In that case, the assignments were great fun, but occasionally time-consuming. On the one hand, Week 1&#39;s applying archaeological terminology to my office took maybe half an hour. On the other hand, my <a href="http://www.screenr.com/ZcCH">video for Week 7</a> took about five hours, maybe more, to put it all together. In general, though, the expected time per assignment was 1-3 hours, and you only had to do one a week.<br><br>Then we were required to assess five other students&#39; work. The grading was literally a score of 0, 1, 2 or 3, and a little bit of constructive criticism, but it still ate up time. Let&#39;s say an hour all told for each week&#39;s peer reviewing. Of course, the assignments offered enough scope that it didn&#39;t get boring...<br><br>So, a summary:<br><br>-IntroAstro: Maybe 4-5 hours a week watching videos and taking notes, and 2 hours answering tests.<br><br>-Instrumental Analysis: Maybe 2-3 hours of videos/notes per week, an hour and a half of tests, and three times in the 8-week course, about 5-6 hours of assignment and peer review work.<br><br>-Archaeology: Maybe 2 hours of (incredibly awesome) videos per week, plus half an hour of reading, ten minutes on a quiz, and a total of around 3-4 hours assessment/peer review per week.<br><br>And it looks like the courses themselves back me up on this - they all seem to claim either 4-6 or 6-8 hours of work per week. That&#39;s only about an hour each night!<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Hi there, Toey!</p>

            <p>There&#39;s actually a whole bunch of people who watch the videos but don&#39;t do any of the assignments.

            <p>Um, hello!  I&#39;m Artemis, but I like to go by Arty, or pretty much anything anyone wants to call me.  I found this place from the fantastic sporking of the MLP fanfic &quot;Cupcakes&quot; that was mentioned on TVtropes.  I quickly fell in love, seeing as grammar, writing, and I are best friends.  And, I mean, you literally KILL Sues!  You dismember them and throw their bodies into pits of lava!  Heck to the yes!!<br><br>Contrary to what would be expected, I am not in the MLP fandom, though I&#39;ve got a pretty good working knowledge of it due to a friend of mine.  I am, however, a major Homestuck fan ((Homestuck High about did me in)), and Portal and Welcome to Nightvale reside among my rather large collection of &quot;Things That Arty Enjoys&quot;.  All three are not very big here, from what I can tell, but hopefully I can figure out something!<br><br>I have some basic character drafts set up, but I don&#39;t plan on requesting permission for a while while I get my bearings.  I&#39;ve still got a lot of learning to do, and truth be told, I am extremely excited for it.<br><br>Oh, and speaking of learning, please tell me if I mess something up.  This should go without saying, since I&#39;m here and all, but I am a big fan of logical criticism.<br><br>A few quick questions before I end my first journey into the eldritch horror known as &quot;The Board&quot;...<br><br>Roughly how many people are active here?  <br>What are the main fandoms?  <br>And, has anyone seen my pants?</p>

I loved how they approached it and how the story flowed.  I definitely think they were a large part of me deciding to look the PPC up, as opposed to the idea of it alone.</p>

            <p>Welcome aBoard! So you listen to Cecil, eh? What do you think of the latest developments between him and Carlos? <br><br>Then, to answer your questions:<br><br>1. No idea<br>2. We don&#39;t have any, we just all fool around. An argument could be made for LotR as our main fandom, since it was the founding fandom, but I think we can say with certainty we&#39;re all just putzing around the multiverse without focusing on any one fandom.<br>3.

            <p>Hi there! Nice to see that you&#39;ve started to get acquainted with the craziness that is the PPC. As has been said already, there are no &quot;main fandoms&quot; around here--though because the Original Series was based off of <i>Lord of the Rings</i> badfic, it&#39;s usually good to have a good LoTR background. (But, of course, it&#39;s by no means required--I, for one, am mainly a Pokemon fan, and I remember actually falling asleep when I last tried to read <i>The Two Towers</i>!)<br><br>Speaking of the Original Series, have you read it? <i>That</i> is pretty much required reading around here, since all else is based off of it.<br><br>Oh yeah, your newbie gift...<br>*rummages through bag of holding*<br>Aha!<br>From the <i>Jimmy Neutron</i> continuum, have a self-folding pair of pants!</p>

            <p>Hello there Artemis! Please accept my gift of a potato cannon and a sack of golden potatoes-great for dispatching Suvians.

Oh, and have an Official Fanfiction University of Doctor Who hoodie.<br><br>As for the amount of fandoms...well there are a lot of them. I don&#39;t think there are any main ones, but I suppose examples of various fandoms would be Lord of the Rings,  Star Trek, Doctor Who, Mass Effect, Sherlock...That&#39;s a sad list, but all I&#39;ve got so far.<br><br>As of the beginning of 2013 to about August 12th, there has been about 54 people active. Not including the people who join after that, of course.<br><br>As for your pants, I don&#39;t know where they are.  That&#39;s not my division.

            <p>I liked this when I beta&#39;d it, and I still like it now. I particularly like some of the lines which weren&#39;t there when I read it before - &#39;It was sort of like having a very nicely dressed falcon stare you down.&#39; And in general, it was fun to read - and it&#39;s fun to see the timeline folding and refolding itself.<br><br>The question is, if the PPC community still exists in the 2030s, will we be able to resolve these timelines? And how?<br><br>And if we don&#39;t, do I get to write another History dealing with the Sundering That Didn&#39;t Sunder, and explaining exactly how everything ended up going on as usual? 2030... yeah, that should be enough time for me to want to go through that again.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Because there&#39;s just not enough of that around HQ :P<br><br>I really like this piece, I think you&#39;ve got a very interesting concept for the storyline (and I&#39;m not just saying that because it&#39;s based on mine!). I look forward to seeing how things go for Gaspard with all his future knowledge. <br><br>I&#39;ve said it before, but I&#39;ll say it again - the interaction between Skeet and Amy was brilliant (particularly Skeet&#39;s line about the &#39;emergency flare&#39;). <br><br>Nicely done.</p>

            <p>Time lines, that is.  As I see it, you have the Paladin-line (which only occurs if the Paladins don&#39;t come back in time), the Tick-tock-line (started by the flowers vetoing the DoE) and now this new time line, which is new and different because of all the information that Gaspard has at his disposal.<br><br>I can&#39;t wait to see how it gets more complicated down the line.

            <p>Actually, I&#39;m not sure that I am - mostly because I have no idea what a Mobius Double Reach-around is, nor why it should be so inevitable. <br><br>It sounds complicated though, and this piece does kind of complicated things to the timeline, so maybe it&#39;s close enough. In fact, it&#39;s possible that anything of sufficiently advanced complexity is indistinguishable from an Inevitable Mobius Double Reach-around.<br><br>Anyway, this piece (probably/possibly) takes place prior to SeaTurtle&#39;s <i>Triple Prime</i>, and might even explain a little bit about just how my agents ended up in there:<br><br>~~~<br><br>Skeet and Amy stepped out of the portal and into the SO&#39;s office, the handheld chrono-tracker showing that they had made it to the right point in the timestream. <br><br>The SO wasn&#39;t there yet, which gave them time to hunt for the assassins. Suddenly, two (very familiar looking) human figures stood up from where they&#39;d been hiding behind the room&#39;s large desk.<br><br>“You?” Skeet said.<br><br>“You!? I mean, me? I mean... oh hell, I don’t know.” The other Skeet said.<br><br>The Skeet and Amy that had been hiding behind the desk looked identical to the other pair, except for the fact that these ones had obviously recently been in combat. Their clothing was torn and patched, their faces smudged with dirt – the other Skeet had a bandage on his upper arm, and his Amy had a cast on her wrist. <br><br>“What are you doing here?” Skeet asked his doppelganger.<br><br>“We&#39;re here to kill the SO, before he can trigger the Sundering and the End Times.” <br><br>Skeet and Amy shared a look. &quot;We&#39;re here to stop the SO from being killed, so that with his leadership the Board votes against the Department of Efficiency proposals, thereby avoiding the Sundering.&quot;<br><br>“Huh, well this awkward.” Injured!Skeet said.<br><br>“Yeah. Hey, wait a minute, why were you surprised to see me?”<br><br>“Because I wasn’t expecting you, dumbass.”<br><br>“Listen, smeghead, I wasn’t expecting you either. How does that work? We can’t have both got here before each other, can we? How would that work?”<br><br>The two Skeets began trying to work it out, using their fingers to represent different points in time and seeing if they could be moved into order, but then quickly fell back to insulting each other. It was left to their partners to try and sort it out. As the girls began to work things through, their partners moved on from insults, to arguments, to actual fighting. <br><br>“Er, guys?” Injured!Amy said. “We’re AUs of each other. This is our first meeting, from both sides.”<br><br>The Skeets looked up at her. Injured!Skeet had Skeet in a headlock, and had been trying to convince him of his superior reasoning powers via a series of blows to the head, while Skeet was preparing to make a cunning counter-argument by elbowing his opponent in the stomach. <br><br>“AUs? Radagast on a <i>bunny sled</i>, how much more complicated is this gonna get?”<br><br>“Quite a lot actually,” said a third Skeet, as he appeared out of a portal. This Skeet had short hair, was clean-shaven, and dressed mostly in white. A chatter of voices could be heard from the other side of his portal. “That’s why we formed the Council.”<br><br>“What Council?” asked Skeet.<br><br>“The Council of Us: all the Skeets, and all the Amys. We’re gonna sort this mess out.” He turned and walked back to his portal, calling over his shoulder, “Come on, you don’t want to be late.”<br><br>“Dude, we’re time-travellers-”<br><br>“Exactly, so think how embarrassing it would be for you if you were late.” Councillor!Skeet said, as he walked through the portal.<br><br>Four confused Assassins followed him. <br><br>They emerged in a large chamber, possibly one of HQ’s auditoriums. The grey walls seemed pristine when viewed from some angles, but were clearly battle-scarred from others. There were at least twenty different versions of Skeet and Amy in the room, several dressed in the identical simple black of a PPC agent, but some of them looked more distinctive. <br><br>As the last four arrived, a Skeet near the podium (this one wearing an eyepatch on his left eye) called for order.<br><br>“OK, now as I&#39;m sure some of you have noticed, our efforts to go back in time and prevent the Sundering haven’t exactly gone smoothly...”<br><br>This brought a round of chuckles from his audience.<br><br>“...which is why we’ve decided to try and bring some level of rationality to our efforts. Now, we’ve got some visitors from even further in the future,” he gestured to four hooded and cloaked figures behind him, “but their involvement is going to have to be strictly limited. They’re basically just here so we don’t waste our time, but they can’t just tell us what to do – we have to come up with the solution that they used ourselves.” <br><br>He paused for breath, and was about to continue when he was pre-empted by a beeping from his pocket. Seconds later, another beeping started up from with the crowd, and an Amy rushed forward to the podium. The two held a hurried, whispered, conversation.<br><br>“Shit, sorry about this.” Eyepatch!Skeet addressed the crowd. “I’ve got a thing.” <br><br>With that ‘explanation’ given, the two of them disappeared through a portal, leaving confused mutterings in their wake.<br><br>Another Skeet took to the stage and took off his fedora, revealing that he too wore an eyepatch. “Right, well, now that that’s been taken care of – and I can assure you, it was very important – we can get down to business.<br><br>“First things first: it’s going to be difficult enough telling us apart as it is, so if you haven’t already adopted some ridiculous affection,” here he nodded at a pair of partners in full pirate regalia, “to make your appearance more unique, then I suggest you do so now.<br><br>“Next up, let’s start by mapping out the distinct timelines we’ve identified so far, and look for points of commonality and divergence...”</p>

            <p>(Is this canon? Tell me this is canon)<br><br>I&#39;ve played with a similar idea before - various incarnations of Agent Lou have run into each other, and I have two stories stored away involving a dozen different versions of me (from different stories) meeting up - but I don&#39;t think my versions have ever <i>organised</i>. I can definitely see it of Skeet and Amy, though.<br><br>The story itself, I enjoyed - things like the two versions having opposite reasons for being there, and the &#39;We can’t have both got here before each other&#39; discussion.

            <p>Yeah, this story falls under the same category as &#39;Trousers&#39; did - it&#39;s canon for my agents, and anyone else that wants it to be.

I mean, judging by Skeet&#39;s dialogue, the two would have known at least at some point that their arrival into the past was the cause of the timelines differentiating each other, so it&#39;s not going to be an &quot;I did <i>what?</i>&quot; sort of reaction, but it&#39;s probably still going to be a huge emotional hit.<br><br>I wish you hadn&#39;t used the term &quot;fixed point in time&quot;, though. It may have been unintentional, but it&#39;s giving me unpleasant flashbacks to when I tried to puzzle out how Steven Moffat&#39;s time travel rules work. Uuggghh. Logic and Moffat do not combine.<br><br>By the way, before Skeet&#39;s watch beeps, there&#39;s a [SI3] in the text. What does that mean? Does it represent a sound?</p>

            <p>...though I don&#39;t quite exactly follow your temporal reasoning.

While I wasn&#39;t trying to make it into a Moffat-ism, I felt that it was a term a lot of people could recognize or understand quite easily. <br><br>Erp, the [SI3] was a leftover from my betas.

            <p>The Door From the Future RP occurs, in which people from Huinesoron&#39;s original Sundering time stream enter the &quot;prime&quot; or &quot;main&quot; PPC time stream.<br>Differentiation occurs with the arrival of the Skeet and Amy from either The Wrong Trousers&#39;s time stream or the future of the SeaTurtle&#39;s Sundering time stream(this detail was unclear, but doesn&#39;t affect event progression, and actually opens up some interesting questions by remaining ambiguous), and Amy neuralyzes most of the agents who witnessed the arrival of the future-people.<br>In addition, a separate differentiation occurs when Skeet leaves a psychic message from alternate-older-Gaspard. This doesn&#39;t create a new timeline, but simply further alters an existing one.<br><br>In the main timeline, the Flowers found out about the bad future from the agents that witnessed the future-people and took steps to prevent it, resulting in a timeline that, while not free of conflict and potential future power struggles, lacks a Sundering.<br><br>In the altered timeline, most of the &quot;present&quot; agents were neuralyzed, save Gaspard and a few others that weren&#39;t in the room when Amy and Skeet came in, such as Kayleigh Leonard. This caused future events to change, since there was less knowledge in the &quot;present&quot; about the DoE and Sundering than there was in the main time stream, setting off a chain of events that allowed the DTOM to form and rise to an level of power unseen since the Mysterious Somebody&#39;s day.<br>I admit, this is a bit of a leap, since as I said, it is currently unclear whether the Skeet and Amy were bringing a message from STS Gaspard&#39;s future self, or simply the future self of <i>a</i> Gaspard. If it was just the future self of <i>a</i> Gaspard, the future of the STS time stream may not have a DoE or a DTOM, may being the operative word due to the potential(in time travel, this is a distinctly different word than &quot;possible&quot;) synonymity of the STS timeline and The Wrong Trousers&#39;s timeline.<br><br>Regardless, events would have proceeded similarly to the main timeline if Amy hadn&#39;t neuralyzed the Agents.<br><br>Judging by General de Grasse&#39;s dialogue, if Gaspard were ever to reveal the information that he now knows about the future, events in STS Gaspard&#39;s native time stream would proceed similarly to those in The Wrong Trousers&#39;s time stream, or perhaps the two timelines would become synonymous, as I said before. I&#39;m not sure how much hyperbole was used in alternate-older Gaspard&#39;s statement there, but going by main-current-Gaspard&#39;s demeanor, I&#39;m guessing not much.<br><br>I figured that, with the &quot;Triple Prime&quot; chapter title, you had been referring to the three time streams: one in the STS story, one in The Wrong Trousers, and one original timeline that the two latter time streams differentiated from.<br><br>From what I can tell, my interpretation seems to at least be close to what you were trying to go for, save that bit at the end about some people having been on a &quot;third lap around the block&quot;. Does that mean there have been major characters in three separate timelines, or that the reader has seen iterations of the main characters in three separate time streams, or what exactly?<br>Perhaps my original reasoning being hard to follow was just due to me phrasing things poorly. It wouldn&#39;t be unlike me.<br><br>I know you weren&#39;t trying to invoke Moffat with that line about fixed points in time, especially since your take on the term as &quot;circumstantial simultaneity of events in several related but unconnected alternate universes&quot; is different than his less-suitable definition. I just inwardly flinched when I saw the term, is all. It&#39;s nothing against the way your story handled time.<br>In fact, I actually quite like your time travel model. Keeping details and possibilities in flux while still keeping a few elements of predestination would seem like trying to, to invoke a phrase, both having and eating one&#39;s cake, if it was handled in a less effective manner. As it is here, it opens some interesting mysteries and potential for dramatic tension, which is always a plus.</p>

            <p>I realized just after posting that one of my sentences is really confusingly structured.

            <p>(I meant to get this up a bit earlier in the day; on the other hand, I suppose it&#39;s not even noon in America yet, so it&#39;s okay)<br><br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=215096">For</a> <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=216383">the</a> <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=245778">fourth</a> time, I present the Monthlyish PPC Writing Challenge!<br><br><i>Here at the PPC we&#39;re very big on writing. We write missions, we rant about the bad writing in badfics, we even play games like Fill The Plothole, which consist of, yep, writing. But at no point do we all sit down and try to improve our writing together.<br><br>So. The objective of the Monthly PPC Writing Challenge is to write a short story to a set theme, and then give useful, constructive criticism to other participants.</i><br><br>Here are The Rules:<br><br>-Write a (reasonably short) story in response to the Theme below, and post it on this thread. You may use a beta if you wish, but it is not required.<br>-Give constructive criticism (at least one positive point, at least one negative with suggestions for improvement) to at least one other submission.<br>-You may rewrite your story based on concrit you receive and repost it, but this is not required.<br>-Obvious fact, but no flaming! This isn&#39;t like the Badfic Contest - the goal here is to write a good story and get feedback from the community.<br>-You do not require Permission to participate in the Challenge. Neither do your agents need to be approved for you to use them.<br>-However, nothing written for the Challenge is considered part of the PPC Canon unless you do have Permission, and explicitly claim it as canon.<br><br>I think that covers it. Remember that both the writing and the giving of concrit are part of the challenge. (And no, there&#39;s no time limit - but there&#39;s not usually much point posting on a thread that&#39;s left the front page)<br><br>And this month&#39;s Theme:<br><br><i>A character in the PPC returns something.</i><br><br>Deliberately short-but-sweet. I hope you can find something interesting to do with it. And remember... have fun!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Er, I wrote the first part of this on a rock in the middle of a river, before reading Phobos&#39; plug down-page. And now I&#39;m looking at the whole thing twice, but anyway. If you haven&#39;t read it yet, you should.<br><br>---<br><br>The sink gurgled as the drain swallowed the last of the suds. Mohan watched them disappear, ran the tap one more time to clear it, and glanced up quickly as the door closed. Lyn clicked the latch home and shook her head. He sighed and turned back to the counter, where several cubic metres of turnip stood.<br><br>&quot;I keep saying we should get some kind of a partition set up,&quot; Lyn said, behind him. He heard the clunk as she pulled the case down from the cabinet.<br><br>&quot;It wouldn&#39;t do any good,&quot; he told her, retrieving his own knife from the block. <br><br>He hefted the long blade once, swing it straight across for the whistle, and brought it down hard on the massive root vegetable. The counter shook slightly with the noise. He grinned nastily at the slice, pulled the knife out, and reached back up to swing again. The knives they used for these were long, and kept sharp. They&#39;d learned to be a bit more careful while chopping vegetables, these days.<br><br>Behind him, the chainsaw revved to life, and there was no conversation for a while as Lyn worked on the other half of the recipe.<br><br>&quot;I know,&quot; she said, as she killed the engine. &quot;But we&#39;ve got to do something! He won&#39;t wear gloves, and I don&#39;t blame him - Cafeteria bylaws have a lot of words about that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I still think somebody should have told them <i>why</i> gloves were such an important part of World One foodhandling tradition,&quot; Mohan said, bringing the knife down to take another two-inch slice of the turnip. &quot;You never know, it might not be the worst idea.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, the worst idea was importing ice wraiths for the walk-in freezers.&quot;<br><br>Mohan shook his head. &quot;What, and not that time someone decided what we really needed was a Durian Casserole?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay, that was--&quot;<br><br>&quot;--or when <i>someone</i> thought the best place to get carrots was in the middle of a Looney Tunes firefight?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Whoa, but that--&quot;<br><br>&quot;--or that time with the Wreck-it Ralph badfic--&quot;<br><br>&quot;--Okay! I get it!&quot; His partner glared at him from the other side of the kitchen. He did not bother to grant the glare the dignity of turning around; Lyn could glare holes in asbestos.<br><br>&quot;If we changed the bylaws specifically to allow gloves for hazards to workers, what would that do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Probably nothing,&quot; Lyn said, pushing the bowl of sawdust up on the counter. &quot;He wouldn&#39;t wear them anyway, and he&#39;d be upset if we tried to change the rules for him. Watch out, that&#39;s got to go here.&quot;<br><br>He stepped out of the way as she slid the stack of sliced turnips into the mixing bowl, and carried it over to the sink to blend.<br><br>&quot;How many batches are we making, anyway?&quot;<br><br>She shrugged. &quot;I figure we might as well use all of it. He should be back pretty soon. We&#39;ve just got to talk to DoSAT, or maybe Medical, about a way to fix all this.&quot;<br><br>Mohan nodded, and returned to cleaving the turnips. He&#39;d nearly finished the row when there was a knock on the door; he and Lyn nearly knocked each other over opening it.<br><br>Igor raised an eyebrow at them. &quot;He ith yourth, yeth?&quot;<br><br>Behind him was the tall, slightly sheepish figure of an Enderman in Cafeteria uniform. He disappeared from view immediately, leaving only a trail of purple sparks past the Igor and into the kitchen. Lyn followed him; Mohan sighed.<br><br>&quot;Yes, he is. Thank you, Igor. Is he alright?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He ith fine. The burnth will heal in a few dayth. He theemth quite eager to return, tho Doctor Fitthgerald athked me to ethcort him here.&quot;<br><br>The short medic reached into his lab pocket and pulled out a small box. &quot;He altho athked me to return thith to your Department.&quot;<br><br>Mohan frowned. &quot;Oh - thank you. He didn&#39;t say what it was...?&quot;<br><br>But the Igor had already disappeared. Mohan sighed, closed the door, and opened the box.<br><br>&quot;...Oh, damn it.&quot; He followed the trail of purple sparks through the kitchen, to where Lyn and Jof were lounging outside of the freezers, eating sandwiches. &quot;Jof, Igor brought this back, too.&quot; He handed the little device to his partner, who frowned.<br><br>&quot;Ah,&quot; he said, after a moment. &quot;That would explain it.&quot;<br><br>Mohan and Lyn waited a few minutes. Mohan sighed.<br><br>&quot;That would explain...?&quot;<br><br>The Enderman looked up. &quot;The hydrophobic device. I left it behind while visiting last week.&quot; He slid the thing into the front pocket of his uniform and took another bite out of his sandwich.<br><br>Lyn shrugged, took another bite out of her own sandwich, and grinned happily. Mohan thought of saying something like &quot;...and you didn&#39;t mention this?&quot; or &quot;...and you still decided to make chicken soup?&quot; or &quot;can we weld that to your neck?&quot; sighed, thought better of it, and sat down, snagging the remains of sandwich-making-supplies for himself.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t until that night at about two o&#39;clock in the morning (the Ironic Overpower Approved time for sudden revelations) when the image of an Igor and a hydrophobic device clicked in his head. He sat bolt upright.<br><br>&quot;Lyn?&quot;<br><br>&quot;nghwha?&quot;<br><br>&quot;How toxic to an Enderman do you think the waters of the Ankh would be?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was <i>asleep</i>, you--&quot; she stopped. &quot;I don&#39;t know, let&#39;s find out.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tomorrow.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>(I only realized partway that the whole &quot;stretching mashed turnips by mixing in sawdust&quot; thing might not be universal, in which case this probably looks random as hell. But yes, that is what they are doing, and no, I probably could not tell you exactly why, besides that my grandpa had some very interesting stories about his childhood.)<br><br>(And yes, I think I&#39;m going to say this <i>is</i> canon, and now I think there needs to be a story about what happens when the Cafeteria decides that they are now doing all their prep and cooking with either Ankh &quot;water&quot; or at least a mixture involving Ankh &quot;water&quot; in some ratio..)</p>

            <p><i>Note: The opinions expressed here are the opinions of the characters, not necessarily of the author. Also, I have no idea if this is any good.</i><br><br>Tish dropped the Lord of the Rings trilogy (plus <i>The Hobbit</i>) on Sebak&#39;s bunk. They bounced, and the top book skittered off the stack and bumped into Sebak&#39;s leg.  &quot;I&#39;m done!&quot; she said. &quot;Finally.&quot;<br><br>Sebak looked up and carefully restacked <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>. &quot;Did you enjoy them?&quot; <br><br>Tish nodded. &quot;Yeah. I liked <i>The Hobbit</i> the best because Bilbo&#39;s character development is cool. I think the riddles were a really creative way to deal with something scary. And I liked trying to guess the answers. It&#39;s so funny, too, Bilbo being all like &#39;I want my hobbit-hole&#39;!&quot;<br><br>The Vulcan tilted his head. &quot;I found that one the least enjoyable.&quot;<br><br>Tish nodded. &quot;You probably like <i>The Silmarillion</i> the best,&quot; she guessed.<br><br>&quot;Did you read it?&quot; Sebak asked, looking almost hopeful.<br><br>Tish snorted. &quot;I tried. But you didn&#39;t say it was required, and it&#39;s really boring! I&#39;d read it if it was told like a story, but ugh.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tolkien&#39;s prose is considered quite beautiful,&quot; Sebak said.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, it is,&quot; Tish said. &quot;And that&#39;s the problem. It&#39;s like &#39;hey look I&#39;m a linguistics professor!&#39; rather than &#39;hey I&#39;m going to tell you a cool story&#39;!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I thought you said you liked the series.&quot;<br><br>She sighed. &quot;First of all, they’re not as bad as <i>The Silmarillion</i>. And there&#39;s still a cool story there. But I kept stopping and starting because I kept losing interest. If I hadn&#39;t promised you, I probably wouldn&#39;t have finished them.&quot;<br><br>Sebak raised his eyebrows. &quot;Why did you read them for me? When you worked in the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> division you would have likely had a partner that would have tried to make you read them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, but she kept trying to convince me to like them and well, you won&#39;t. You&#39;re just like &#39;it&#39;s logical to read them because there is a lot of badfic for them&#39;. I like things to make sense.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Really.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tish said.<br><br>&quot;Hm. Considering what I have learned about you, that is most - &quot;<br><br>&quot;Fascinating, I know,&quot; Tish said, sighing. &quot;Could you <i>not</i> be stereotypical? Anyhow, I read them for you. Happy? Right, stupid question,&quot; she added as Sebak arched an eyebrow.<br><br>&quot;I am disappointed that you did not enjoy them,&quot; he replied. &quot;However, as you said, they are necessary.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, we can agree to disagree on that. Most fic is movieverse. And I didn&#39;t say I didn&#39;t like them!&quot;<br><br>&quot;You explained your problems with them quite thoroughly,&quot; Sebak pointed out.<br><br>She shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s just kind of overrated, that&#39;s all.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That is your opinion.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Right,&quot; she said.<br><br>Sebak nodded.<br><br>Tish grinned. &quot;So, will you read <i>Percy Jackson</i>?&quot;</p>

            <p>I&#39;m really growing to love your characters rather a lot with every bit of their lives that you share. I also think that you&#39;ve written a very IC Vulcan, which, well...well done :) And Tish explained her reasons and was an illogically logical (or possibly logically illogical) human about it all. It was quite fun, and the end--<i>Percy Jackson</i>--had me giggling, probably both because of the request and because I could picture Sebak&#39;s expression (okay, fine, his <i>inner</i> expression). Also because I then went on to picture Sebak&#39;s reaction to the books themselves and also probably because I just finished reading <i>The Mark of Athena</i> (er, I think I finished it...it&#39;s so recent I can&#39;t remember if I have a couple more pages or not, but I think I finished it.) Anyway, it was very fun to read, and I enjoyed it a great deal, and I&#39;m going to post this now before I really start repeating myself. Good night! :)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Honestly, it&#39;s not all that hard to write an IC Vulcan. At least for me. I basically learned how to write fanfiction writing Data, so I just add a bit more snark and use more contractions.<br><br>And I think it will be fun to see Sebak&#39;s reaction. I think the two series make a nice contrast - Tolkien being intellectual high fantasy, Percy Jackson being fantasy but more fun and snarky (though no less intelligent). I&#39;ll definitely be rereading the series again in preparation for House of Hades, maybe I&#39;ll write Sebak&#39;s reaction then.<br><br>Anyhow, I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it!</p>

            <p>Should be awesome :D If you ever feel doubtful that anyone wants to read it, drop me a line, and I&#39;ll flood you with encouragement and excited jumping up and down.<br><br>I think my praise of the IC-Vulcan-ness is partially because of a rather traumatic (certainly to the agents involved) Spock replacement, partially because of my own occasional difficulty in determining just how many emotion-based words my Vulcan character would use, and definitely out of admiration at seeing a well-written Vulcan character, one who really reads like a Vulcan.

            <p>As to writing Vulcans, you write them like other characters, but do what I call &quot;translation&quot;. Satisfied or pleased for happy, disappointed or displeased for unhappy, gratified for thankful, mildly irritated for pissed off. And skeptical and confused are good words to use. Use &quot;mildly&quot; and &quot;vaguely&quot; - mildly irritated, vaguely amused. Also, lots of eyebrow movements.<br><br>Though, honestly, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re doing fine. :) I look forward to reading said mission. <br><br>Also, while I&#39;m talking to you - how&#39;s the Avengers OFU going? It&#39;s just that I&#39;m working my way through the movies right now - seen everything except Hulk and Iron Man 3, and I want to watch the Avengers again now that I know everyone&#39;s backstory - and I&#39;d love to read it. And submit a fangirl. Because I&#39;ve kind of got myself to base her on.</p>

            <p>This definitely sounds like a real conversation between a pro-Tolkien and &quot;meh&quot;-Tolkien person. I&#39;ve heard just about all of these points from real people, and I think you&#39;ve got a fair representation of both sides here—except that I&#39;d personally be a whole lot more insistent than Sebak was about how freaking beautiful Tolkien&#39;s language is and nobody appreciates a well-turned sentence these days. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>Ahem. Anyway. As a piece of dialogue, this works pretty well. You&#39;ve set the scene well enough that I know what the conversation is about and why it&#39;s happening. It helps that I already know who these characters are, and I&#39;m not sure if it would be as enjoyable to someone who hasn&#39;t met them yet, but for the purpose of illustrating how some people really like Tolkien while others are indifferent, I think it&#39;s not terribly important.<br><br>There was one hitch for me:<br><br><i>&quot;Fascinating, I know,&quot; Tish said, sighing. &quot;Could you not be stereotypical? Anyhow, I read them for you. Happy? Right, stupid question,&quot; she added as Sebak arched an eyebrow.</i><br><br>At the end of this line, you&#39;ve got events happening out of order: Tish responds to Sebak raising his eyebrow before he&#39;s shown to do it. Worse, the word &quot;as&quot; means that she reacts to his action at the same time he performs it.* When the reader inevitably realizes that the eyebrow must have happened first and Tish&#39;s reaction comes second, they have to pause and reset their mental image, which is a distraction. A small one, yes, but still something to be avoided. I&#39;d rewrite the line like this:<br><br><i>&quot;Fascinating, I know,&quot; Tish said, sighing. &quot;Could you not be stereotypical? Anyhow, I read them for you. Happy?&quot;<br><br>Sebak arched an eyebrow.<br><br>&quot;Right, stupid question,&quot; she added.</i><br><br>This way, everyone is reacting to what came before in a linear progression of cause and effect. It is, you might say, logical. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>* Full disclosure: I was scarred for life by <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5873406/1/The_Girl_And_Her_Dragon">this fic</a> and learned to hate the word &quot;as&quot; with a fiery burning passion. I take a pretty firm stance on when it should and shouldn&#39;t be used. Looser stances may technically be acceptable. Now, if you&#39;ll please pardon me, I have to go wipe some bloody sputum off my chin...</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad it sounds real. I&#39;m on Tish&#39;s side for the most part, but I do want to write Sebak as being much more of a Tolkien fan. For future reference, what other arguments could I possibly use on his side? I didn&#39;t really show much of his side here because I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d get it right.<br><br>And I&#39;ll fix that error if I ever rework this into an opening for a mission.

            <p>I don&#39;t know how much use my arguments would be for Sebak, since most of them have to do with feelings invoked by the work. There are a couple academic things I can point to, though.<br><br>In a word, craftsmanship. Tolkien put a massive amount of work into Middle-earth, and it shows in the snippets of languages, poetry, and history that pop up throughout the tale. It&#39;s the kind of thing where you get out of it what you put into it. If you&#39;re only reading for the adventure story, that&#39;s all you&#39;ll get, and yeah, it&#39;s not your modern action-packed mile-a-minute romp. It&#39;s slow, it digresses, it rambles.<br><br>But if you take the time to study it, though, to learn who those people in the songs are, and why there are ruins on Weathertop, and where the Dunedain came from, and the real-life inspiration behind the Rohirrim—and let me just take a moment to say <i>alliterative verse</i>. My mind was blown all over again when I got to college and learned what alliterative verse is, and how he chooses to use it is just perfect, and . . . .<br><br>Ahem. Sorry.<br><br>Speaking to characters for a moment. Again, I think the issue that people have is that everything about them isn&#39;t necessarily right there on the page, so if you&#39;re not interested in their motifs, archetypes, symbolism, etc., there&#39;s not much there. We don&#39;t delve into their psyches a whole lot, and few of them are the type to spill everything they&#39;re thinking through their dialogue.<br><br>To appreciate Aragorn, for instance, you have to bear in mind that he&#39;s old, he&#39;s been living like an exile in the wild his entire adult life, and he&#39;s not even allowed to be with the woman he loves unless ultimate evil can be destroyed <i>and</i> he becomes king, redeeming the humongous screw-ups of his ancestors who could have prevented this whole mess in the first place if they&#39;d just <i>listened</i>. This quest, while having the highest fate-of-the-world stakes you can possibly get, is also seriously, brutally personal for him. Just because we never hear him complain about it doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t weigh on his mind and influence every single decision he makes. So, when he chooses to follow Merry and Pippin instead of Frodo and Sam, or to look into the <i>palantir</i>, or to take the Paths of the Dead, the risk he&#39;s taking is enormous, not just for Middle-earth, but for him personally. Every decision is agonizingly risky, but he chooses to take the harder path anyway, because it&#39;s just that goddamn crucial. <i>Meanwhile</i>, he still manages to find the time to say a few kind words to poor Eowyn, heal the stricken, and generally act like a compassionate and caring guy. Aragorn is freaking awesome.<br><br>What else...? Oh, I happen to love Tolkien&#39;s sense of humor. Yes, he has one. No, it does not involve dwarf-tossing and troll boogers. -_-; It mostly comes from the way joy and laughter can surprise you, I think, so naturally the hobbits are the chief source. You get moments like Gimli waxing poetic about the Glittering Caves in the aftermath of the Battle of Helm&#39;s Deep, or Merry and Pippin having a smoke atop the ruins of Isengard, or Sam going on about how their adventures would make a great story someday. It&#39;s like... wow, guys, this is what you choose to fixate on at a time like this? Really?<br><br>And the answer is &quot;Yeah, really,&quot; because otherwise life just wouldn&#39;t be worth the long, hard fight.<br><br>I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is, Tolkien is an academic&#39;s dream, but a casual reader&#39;s nightmare. Sebak, as an academic, can find all sorts of things to appreciate through study and contemplation of the background details, themes, mythology, inspirations, and broader contexts of the work, whereas Tish, who&#39;s looking for a fun, exciting ride, won&#39;t find it here. There&#39;s nothing wrong with either approach to reading in general, it&#39;s just that, when it comes to Tolkien, one will reward you forever and the other one won&#39;t.<br><br>I know that probably sounds elitist even though I don&#39;t mean it that way... I&#39;ll just add that it&#39;s really, really okay if you don&#39;t love Tolkien. People don&#39;t have to love all the same things equally. That would be stupid.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Not to go on to much of a tangent, but I truly find LoTR to be really good, but not fantastic. The kea problem for me is that I am not a wordsmith, but a storyteller. When I read a story, I expect flow in narrative, and the actions motivating the story. I have read books that others have blasted as horribly written, but enjoyed them, as I found value in the story that was being told. One of my good friends, however, was a wordsmith. He could write the most beautiful prose, with description that could blow you away. However, I was a constant critic of his stories, because like Tolkien, he let the construction of the words and the description the the world take precedence over the characters and story. The number of arguments we have had over literature... So yeah, I&#39;m with Tish here. Perhaps after I have finally finished the series I will write a paper on what, exactly, I find wrong with Mr. Tolkien&#39;s writing style.<br><br>As for the story you wrote Hermione, I found nothing wrong with it that Nesh has not already pointed out. I have not read anything with these two before, but what I gleamed about them is very interesting. Fascinating, you might say. I am very interested in seeing more from these two. Well done.</p>

            <p>(This may be a cursed thread... I meant to post <i>this</i> yesterday, but have been too busy/ill to do so until now...)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Tango Dioxide (né Dioxide - her culture didn&#39;t go in for changing surnames when you got married) jumped into the elevator as soon as it arrived. The doors slammed shut in flagrant disregard of health and safety regs, not to mention the Laws of Narrative Comedy - no-one should ever be able to easily escape a rampaging mob just by getting in a lift. <i>Someone at Legal&#39;s going to get in trouble for that one,</i> Tango thought, making the sign of the Legal Chao with one hand.<br><br>The ride up was accompanied by tinny music by a band that wouldn&#39;t have been allowed to exist if the Wrecked Music Department were anything more than a rumour, and then as the doors sprung apart Tango discovered exactly why Legal had been so lax:<br><br>Mobius lifts.<br><br>The one upside of her spatial loop of a journey was that the mob weren&#39;t expecting her to return. As they stared at her in confusion, Tango took the opportunity to bolt sideways - jumping over one particularly diminuative mobster... or mobette... or whatever the word was - and was off down a corridor. She hastily began to recite Treebeard&#39;s song in the original Entish, hoping that her &#39;unless you hadn&#39;t noticed&#39; would trump the mob&#39;s &#39;catch the blasphemer&#39;.<br><br>It didn&#39;t really work out. Gasping for breath, Tango threw a glance back over her shoulder to find her pursuers closer than ever. <i>I haven&#39;t kept in shape,</i> she lamented. <i>Eight years ago they wouldn&#39;t stand a cha-OOF!</i><br><br>The &#39;oof&#39; was the natural consequence of running headlong into a potted artificial plant, one of the hideous things Building Maintenance had decided to decorate the lobby with. Except this one wasn&#39;t in the lobby, it was in the middle of a corridor - and had a hand reaching out of it.<br><br>&quot;Come <i>on</i>,&quot; snapped a woman&#39;s voice. &quot;Do you want to be dismembered?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sure they wouldn&#39;t-&quot; Tango began, and then heard the distinctive snap-hiss of a dozen lightsabers igniting. &quot;Uh, never mind.&quot; She grabbed the hand and let it drag her through the branches, into-<br><br>-a sleek metallic room far larger than the pot plant, or even the corridor. She looked around in wonder, and then turned to the owner of the hand: a short woman with cropped black hair, waiting with her other hand on her hip.<br><br>&quot;A TARDIS,&quot; Tango breathed. &quot;I&#39;ve never actually been in one before.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s always nice to hear,&quot; the woman replied. &quot;Nowadays I usually get &#39;Oh, did you pick one up during the Macrovirus infection too?&#39;. Amateurs.&quot; She sniffed, then leant back and tapped something on the console. &quot;There, we&#39;re in flight. You&#39;re welcome, by the way.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um, thank you,&quot; Tango said hurriedly. &quot;But I don&#39;t understand. You&#39;re PPC - okay, DMS, I see the flashpatch, and it explains the shelf of potted cacti - but who are you? And, not that I&#39;m complaining, why did you help me?&quot;<br><br>The woman frowned at her. &quot;I&#39;m returning the favour,&quot; she pointed out. &quot;Remember? When my pack got stolen by goblins in that <i>Labyrinth</i> &#39;fic, you and Nyx came and rescued me. Well, I saw you were in trouble, and-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wait, wait.&quot; Tango held up a hand. &quot;I&#39;ve never even set foot in <i>Labyrinth</i> &#39;fic. I&#39;m sure I&#39;d remember.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmm.&quot; The woman turned and tapped a dial on her console, then shrugged. &quot;Must be on the blink again. So I guess I&#39;m returning the favour in advance. That would explain a few of the things you said...&quot;<br><br>Tango rubbed the bridge of her nose and leant on the nearest piece of furniture, which turned out to be a hatstand. &quot;So you&#39;re from the future?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Or you&#39;re from the past,&quot; the woman offered. &quot;Morgan. Nice to meet you - again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh, likewise.&quot; Tango shook her head slowly. &quot;So what happens now?&quot;<br><br>Morgan grinned and pulled a lever. A familiar rising and falling whine started up - the sound of a TARDIS dematerialising, made famous by the <i>Doctor Who</i> TV series. &quot;Now I drop you off at your RC, and you do your level best to avoid... what was it you did to get them after you, anyway?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nothing, really,&quot; Tango shrugged. &quot;I just mentioned that I thought <i>The Phantom Menace</i> was the best <i>Star Wars</i> film... what?&quot;<br><br>Morgan&#39;s grin had morphed into a frozen rictus, and she leant back against the console and closed her eyes. &quot;I wonder,&quot; she said to the room at large, &quot;if it&#39;s too late to put her back...?&quot;</p>

            <p>There was a very hesitant knock at the door to RC #583. No sound came from within, but the door opened anyway, revealing a darkened room lit only by a projection lamp that was currently displaying a pattern of stars. The person who had been knocking entered; it was a small, young woman with a mass of curly red hair and a very anxious expression.<br><br>&quot;Kelvin?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m busy, Lyra.&quot;<br><br>She sighed, peering at the tall figure sprawled on his bed at the far side of the room. &quot;No, you&#39;re not. I <i>can</i> see you, even with the light off.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m <i>thinking</i>, and not in the mood for an argument.&quot; The dark-haired elf&#39;s tone was brittle with anger and unhappiness.<br><br>Lyra Mackenzie rolled her eyes and switched the light on, giving her partner a stern look. &quot;At least <i>try</i> to be nice? I&#39;m not looking for an argument either, you know.&quot;<br><br>The only response was something that sounded like Sindarin, but the tone made it clear that the actual comment was rather vulgar; she knew bits of the language after four years of working with him, but she&#39;d never heard that phrase before, and her translator had clearly decided it wasn&#39;t about to help.<br><br>&quot;Sod you too,&quot; she said mildly. She knew <i>why</i> he was upset, after all, so she was doing her best not to be offended, even if it did mean controlling her temper much more tightly than usual. &quot;Look, I found -&quot;<br><br>He sat up and fixed her with a glare. &quot;I really do not want to talk right now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, tough, because I do.&quot; She pulled a little jewellery box out of her bag and offered it to him. &quot;Like I was saying, I found this at one of the jewellery shops.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...What is it?&quot; Now Kelvin was giving her a dubious look. It was wholly out of character for her to give him anything.<br><br>The small girl couldn&#39;t help a rather self-satisfied grin. &quot;Take a look and find out.&quot;<br><br>Rather hesitantly, he did as bidden... and for once, she had the satisfaction of seeing him look truly stunned as he held up the box&#39;s contents. &quot;Where did you <i>find</i> this? We thought it was lost for good!&quot;<br><br>&quot;At one of the jewellery shops, like I said. Someone came in and sold it to them, I don&#39;t think they knew what it was really worth -&quot;<br><br>She was cut off as Kelvin unexpectedly hugged her tightly, laughing with relief. &quot;Stars above, Lyra, thank you,&quot; he managed hoarsely after a moment. &quot;I never thought we&#39;d see it again, Cassie&#39;s going to be so glad...&quot;<br><br>She hugged back, a bit awkwardly, before escaping and smoothing down her trousers. It felt rather nice, she noted absently, to see him looking that happy. &quot;Well, just tell her to keep a better eye on it in future,&quot; she said, nodding to the necklace - an oval-cut blue-tinged diamond pendant set in truesilver - and shrugging a little. &quot;If she&#39;s going to keep a wedding present that valuable...&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know.&quot; He smiled broadly, his former mood quite vanished. &quot;I&#39;ll see if Mazarun has any ideas - a spell or something. But I&#39;d best go and give this to her now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...Okay.&quot; Lyra&#39;s smile dropped a little at the mention of the drow who&#39;d become Kelvin&#39;s closest friend; Mazarun had always creeped her out. &quot;See you later. Get cracking before the console goes off.&quot;<br><br>He chuckled, tucked the box into his tunic, and slipped out with another murmured thanks.</p>

            <p>I actually have a slight problem with your opening line. It switches between a POV inside and outside the RC. I&#39;ll try and clarify that by <b>bolding</b> the stuff that feels like we&#39;re inside, and <i>italicising</i> what feels like we&#39;re outside:<br><br><b>There was a very hesitant knock at the door to RC #583</b>. <i>No sound came from within,</i> <b>but the door opened anyway,</b> <i>revealing a darkened room lit only by a projection lamp that was currently displaying a pattern of stars</i>. <b>The person who had been knocking entered...</b><br><br>&#39;We&#39; don&#39;t know who&#39;s knocking, suggesting we&#39;re on the other side of the door to them. Then we&#39;re outside, listening to &#39;no sound&#39;. Then the door opens, presumably by way of the unseen knocker. Then we, from outside, see the room for the first time. Then, inside, we see the knocker come in...<br><br>But, that said, I can find nothing to complain about in the <i>rest</i> of the story (except the capital W in &#39;... What is it?&#39;). You do a good job of conveying the shifts in mood as the story progresses, and (in contrast to my last entry!) keep your characters physically present, rather than turning them into talking heads. And the pendant sounds quite pretty - is that truesilver as in mithril, or some other metal by the same name?<br><br>Oh, actually, one more thing! Lyra is a &#39;young woman&#39; when she comes in, but halfway down she&#39;s a &#39;small girl&#39;. Yes, technically that second description is accurate - but it feels like &#39;child&#39;, not &#39;tiny&#39;. In this context, either &#39;petite&#39; or simply &#39;short&#39; might work better. Or, if she <i>is</i> as young as it implies, turn her into a &#39;young&#39; or &#39;teenaged&#39; girl at her introduction.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I knew those first few sentences weren&#39;t quite right, but this is what happens when I don&#39;t get beta-readers in before I post something. :P<br><br>And yes, it&#39;s kind of difficult deciding what descriptions to use with Lyra - she&#39;s twenty, but her maturity level <i>isn&#39;t</i> level, really, she&#39;s had to forcibly grow up a bit whilst in HQ, but she arrived as a spoilt brat and regresses on occasion.

            <p>I remembered reading this in one of the &#39;how to write&#39; books I own, and looked it up again because I want to try and do something similar in a forthcoming mission. It&#39;s amazing how much a bit of punctuation can change the meaning of a sentence (well, I say that - I guess in many ways, that&#39;s actually what punctuation is there for).<br><br>Anyway, I thought this was brilliant, so figured I&#39;d share it. <br><br>Take the following examples. They both use identical wordings, but the sentiments expressed are... somewhat different. <br><br>Version the first:<br><br><i>Dear John,<br><br>I want a man who knows what love is all about. You are kind, generous, and thoughtful. People who are not like you admit to being useless and inferior. You have ruined me for other men. I yearn for you. I have no feelings whatsoever when we’re apart. I can be forever happy.<br><br>Will you let me be yours?<br><br>Gloria</i><br><br><br>Version the second:<br><br><i>Dear John,<br><br>I want a man who knows what love is. All about you are kind, generous and thoughtful people, who are not like you. Admit to being useless and inferior. You have ruined me. For other men, I yearn. For you, I have no feelings whatsoever. When we’re apart, I can be forever happy.<br><br>Will you let me be?<br><br>Yours,<br><br>Gloria</i><br><br><br>Anyone else got any examples of this kind of thing they want to share? I figure there must be <i>plenty</i> of times in badfic where the meaning of a sentence gets unintentionally changed. </p>

            <p>In case anyone&#39;s not aware, the Oxford comma (or serial comma) is the one that goes before the final &quot;and&quot; in a list, such as &quot;Spam, eggs, sausage<b><span style="color:red;">,</span> and</b> spam.&quot; It&#39;s preferred in most (though not all) American usage because it can prevent the kind of ambiguity under discussion in this thread. For instance, there&#39;s a huge difference in meaning between the following lines:<br><br>* This book is dedicated to my roommates, Nicole Kidman, and God.<br><br>* This book is dedicated to my roommates, Nicole Kidman and God.<br><br>Without the Oxford comma, it seems this author had some very interesting roommates!<br><br><br>Here&#39;s a <b>MILDLY NSFW</b> illustrated example I&#39;ve seen floating around:<br><br><br>[Save yourself if you&#39;re somewhere you could be embarrassed!]<br><br><br>[Are you sure you want to scroll down?]<br><br><br>[Really really sure?]<br><br><br>[Okay, go on then.]<br><br><br><img src="http://cdn.thegloss.com/files/2011/09/jfk.jpg" alt="http://cdn.thegloss.com/files/2011/09/jfk.jpg"><br><br>So basically, my feeling is this: if you&#39;re making a list, using the Oxford comma can&#39;t damage your meaning, but leaving it out <i>can</i>.

            <p>I&#39;ve never honestly understood why <i>anyone</i> argues against the Oxford comma. It&#39;s so useful! There&#39;s no reason I can see to get rid of it.<br><br>But, unfortunately...

The Oxford Comma is useful in the event of a list where the latter items look like they could be a description of the former - so &#39;I went to work for two ducks, Roderick and Clement&#39; is unclear as to whether those are the names of the ducks, whereas &#39;two ducks, Roderick, and Clement&#39; indicates clearly that your place of employment has a very strange management system. Of course, in this case, you could simply restructure the sentence - &#39;Roderick, Clement, and two ducks&#39; - which resolves the ambiguity just as well. It also works around the problem that if I discuss &#39;two ducks, Roderick and Clement&#39;, you don&#39;t know if I&#39;m simply failing to use the Oxford Comma, or actually discussing the named waterfowl. Abandoning the OC in favour of restructuring removes <i>that</i> ambiguity.<br><br>(Actually the best thing is to use either &#39;Roderick, Clement[,] and two ducks&#39; or &#39;two ducks named Roderick and Clement&#39; to remove all possible ambiguity)<br><br>There are other cases where the OC does absolutely nothing, because the ambiguity never existed. &#39;My parents were a hamster, an elderberry bush, and a giant wooden rabbit&#39; works either way, unless you assume that a hamster can be &#39;an elderberry bush and a giant wooden rabbit&#39;, in which case, head down to FicPsych immediately.<br><br>Then, as Wikipedia is telling me, there are cases where the OC <i>fails</i> to resolve ambiguity. &#39;In the lands far to the north dwell Noggin the Nog, a cormorant and a knave&#39;. Well, we know Noggin isn&#39;t a knave (he&#39;s a king), so let&#39;s put that Oxford Comma back! &#39;...Noggin the Nog, a cormorant, and a knave&#39;. Great! So, er, is Noggin a cormorant? (Answer: No, that&#39;s Graculus).<br><br>Again, in this case restructuring is the answer. We can&#39;t say &#39;a cormorant, Noggin the Nog, and a knave&#39;, because that could still imply poor Noggin is a bird. &#39;a cormorant, Noggin the Nog and a knave&#39; is actually <i>clearer</i> in this instance, because you&#39;d never use that structure to discuss the knavish cormorant Noggin. But in the end, the best structure is probably &#39;a cormorant, a knave, and Noggin the Nog&#39; - which works exactly the same with or without the OC.<br><br>(And the final variant, with two names and one possible descriptor - &#39;I rode into Chippenham with Count Dracula, Marie Curie and the King of England&#39;. Again, the OC is irrelevant - but put His Majesty anywhere else in that sentence, and you&#39;re making an... <i>interesting</i> political statement)<br><br>(And England doesn&#39;t have a king right now. Honestly, what are you like?)<br><br>hS<br><br><i>&quot;In the lands of the North, where the Black Rocks stand guard against the cold sea, in the dark night that is very long, the Men of the Northlands sit by their great log fires, and they tell a tale...&quot;</i><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Graculus.png"></p>

            <p>Also, this sort of thing doesn&#39;t really work if you don&#39;t provide the alternate punctuation yourself.

            <p>The only one I could figure out was &quot;Beware: teachers when parking.&quot; but that makes no sense. People don&#39;t just become teachers as they park. How would that change them from what they were before they became teachers? Would the people parking suddenly start coming up with lesson plans, and then forget about them as they get out of the car? Or will the teacher-effects become permanent, and they would suddenly get a job teaching a tenth-grade geometry class, apropos of nothing? That sounds like the plot for an episode of a particularly desperate sitcom more than something that would be printed on a sign, or wherever that sentence would be showing up.<br><br>I&#39;m not very good with word puzzles, though, so the answer will probably be obvious in retrospect. Then again, most things are.</p>

            <p>Thor, beyond a shadow of a doubt. However, I am getting way, <i>way</i> ahead of myself. Before we get too far into &#39;who would win in a death battle,&#39; we have to know what each one brings to the table as far as combat goes.<br><br>While I have seen Thor, I have not seen much of g1 Transformers (not even a full episode), so most of my Starscream knowledge has to come from somebody else. It just so happens that the information I am using comes from Death Battle, the episode where g1 Starscream fought against g4 Rainbow Dash, from My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic. <s>and got crushed like a tin can</s> He fought well, and provided the data I need for my argument. It also happens that Thor was also involved in a Death Battle, this time against Raiden from Mortal Combat. For the sake of being fair, I will use most of the points they raised in that battle for support, including his weaknesses, though most of my argument comes from the movies.<br><br>Let&#39;s start with Starscream, and run down his armor, weapons, and skill.<br>Starscream comes in two forms: F-15 Eagle fighter jet, and giant-frickin-robot. In his land based form, Starscream comes with an assortment of weapons, including: <br>Cluster bombs<br>Missiles <br>Machine guns <br>Some laser guns<br>Null-Ray: The Null-Ray focuses energy into a contained blast to shut down anything that runs on electricity. (How he did not manage to take over the Decepticons with this thing alone baffles me, but that&#39;s unimportant)<br>As a jet, his weaponry includes:<br>AIM homing missiles<br>-7F/M Sparrows<br>-120 AMRAAM Slammers<br>-9L/M Sidewinders<br>M61A1 Vulcan gatling gun<br>I have little idea of what these truly are, but from what I have gleamed, the three missiles are basically different ranges. In order as presented above: Mid-range, long-range, short-range. The gatling gun shoots really, really fast. It&#39;s rather good. Not much else to say on it.<br><br>Starscream can fly, either over short distances in his robot form, or long-ranges in his jet form. As a jet, he can fly at top speeds of Mach 2.5+ or 1,650+ mph.<br><br>Starscream likes to think of himself as a strategist, though several of his plans fail. Miserably. Despite this, he does have a way with words, and manages to be just competent enough to stay as one of the higher-ranking officials. He is fond of stabbing people in the back and utilizing the element of surprise. That said, he is also headstrong, so his idea of &#39;surprise&#39; is often &quot;charge in front of the enemy, fein damage and inhabitation, then shoot them when they least expect it.&quot; This makes his Null-Ray more effective, as it seems to work best at close distances. This may be because Starscream is a horrid shot. There is a reason his missiles are tracking. <br><br>Now let&#39;s cover Thor. <br>Thor is the Norse god of thunder, giving him mastery over storms and lightning. His weaponry includes:<br>Lightning bolts<br>Thunder blasts<br>Vortexes<br>Storms<br>Mjolnir<br><br>Mjolnir is Thor&#39;s signature weapon. This one handed hammer, forged by the dwarves as an ultimate gift, can perform a variety of attacks. When the dwarves gave the hammer to Thor, they described it as such: &quot;Thor might smite as hard as he desired, whatsoever might be before him, and the hammer would not fail; and if he threw it at anything, it would never miss, and never fly so far as not to return to his hand; and if be desired, he might keep it in his sark, it was so small; but indeed it was a flaw in the hammer that the fore-haft was somewhat short.&quot; Beyond these powers, it seems to be a conduit for Thor&#39;s energy. He can send lightning bolts out of the head, call forth his armor, and even fly after spinning the hammer in his hand really fast. It has also been known in the comics to control electro-magnetic fields, though this ability has not been shown in the movies yet.<br><br>Thor is a mountain of a man, as well as a god. His skin is neigh invulnerable, though he can be damaged if enough force is applied. Thor has had numerous fights with the Hulk, one of the strongest and hardest hitting things in the universe, and has escaped with only a few bruises. Even though his hammer carries most of his strength inside of it, Thor is no weakling himself. He among the strongest of the Asgardians, and as stated before, has traded blows with the Hulk, one of the few beings that can be stronger then him.<br><br>So, now it comes down to this. Who would win? As I said in the beginning, Thor would not only win, but annihilate Starscream. <br><br>Starscream&#39;s best weapon, the Null-Ray, is completely useless against organic beings, which Thor is. The rest of his arsenal, while it may be able to damage Thor if he concentrated almost all of his firepower onto the god at once, but even then it seems unlikely. Starscream&#39;s best chance is to grab Thor in a bear hug and transform into a jet as soon as he could, crushing Thor in the process. Of corse, that would probably only allow the god to rip him apart from the inside.<br><br>Thor on the other hand has a much greater offensive capability. All electrical systems can be overpowered, and several bolts of lightning should overcharge any robot, no matter how advanced their technology is. Should Starscream attempt to fly away, Thor could easily catch up to him, using his hammer to fly up to the jet. Once close enough to Starscream to hit, Mjolnir would be more then strong enough to tear right through him. In fact, Thor does not even need to be close to hit, as he has shown remarkable throwing capabilities with his hammer. Finaly, should Starscream manage to fly far enough away that Thor could not catch him, the god of thunder could call in a vortex to rip Starscream&#39;s body apart with lightning and extraordinarily heavy wind.<br><br>The winner is Thor.</p>

            <p>Ignore virtually everything about the two, and just consider the implications of Mjolnir. It&#39;s a hammer which <i>cannot be lifted by anything other than Thor</i>. That&#39;s been shown<sup><font color="blue">[Citation Needed]</font></sup> to include the Hulk.<br><br>The battle goes something like this:<br><br>-Thor, being smaller and thus more maneuverable, gets above Starscream.<br>-Thor drops Mjolnir on Starscream, pinning or pushing Starscream to the ground.<br>-Thor hits the grounded Starscream with lightning until he&#39;s dead.<br><br>The key point is that, unlike the people-sized things Thor usually fights, Starscream has large flat areas.

            <p>I&#39;m not terribly familiar with Thor lore (Norse or Marvel versions), but I sort of thought of &quot;cannot be lifted by anyone other than Thor&quot; as more a security &quot;device&quot; that prevents it from being picked up by people. Inanimate objects can support just fine, although it probably really is quite heavy. (Although what the hammer classifies as an inanimate object (like, I don&#39;t know, giant transforming robots) is an interesting discussion to have!).<br><br>Another possibility is that the hammer really <i>can</i> only be LIFTED by Thor. That is, only Thor can increase its altitude (technically, only Thor can increase the magnitude of its vector in the direction opposite that of the gravitational field at that point). Other objects or people can move it laterally, or control or stop its descent just fine, but they just can&#39;t make it RISE. Although, once again, it is probably still quite heavy regardless.<br><br><br>Both of these interpretations involve a lot of &quot;exact words&quot;ing, but given that the hammer&#39;s properties are pretty much magical in nature, this doesn&#39;t seem unreasonable. There has to be SOME limit on its liftability.... otherwise, if Thor ever dropped it, it would tunnel directly to the core of the planet!<br><br>As for the hammer being made of neutronium, I&#39;d say it&#39;s possible, but unlikely without magic. We don&#39;t really have very good models of what that kind of density would DO when brought into a terrestrial environment. </p>

            <p>Thor&#39;s hammer has an incantation of some sort on it that prevents it from being picked up by anyone save those who are deemed worthy or honorable enough to wield it, suggesting that the hammer has some capacity to scan minds and judge people by its near-unattainably high standards. In the comics, there have been a few others that have been seen by Mjolnir as worthy to bear it, and then those individuals can carry it around with one hand the way Thor does.<br><br>Mjolnir tends to blow a huge hole in the ground whenever Thor drops it while flying, though, so it is still crazy heavy, but someone with a Decepticon&#39;s level of strength should be able to move out from under it. Starscream couldn&#39;t grab the hammer and throw it off of him, since that would count as using the hammer, which might also preclude pushing it with his hands and feet, but he should be able to tilt himself so it slides off, or activate his jet thrusters and then flip over, causing the hammer to fall off of him and land on the ground below.<br><br>As for whether it was made of a neutron star(warning: this is probably going to come across as a huge nitpick to some people), the stars in Norse mythology were actually fragments of a planet-sized primordial giant named Ymir, set on fire with unending flame in a world composed almost entirely of lava and other high-temperature substances, and then hung on the inside of the night sky, a.k.a. Ymir&#39;s skull, which had recently been set over the world by the Aesir as part of their celebration for killing the world-giant.<br>A &quot;dying star&quot; in that context would still be very dense and strong, since it was made out of divine biomass, but it wouldn&#39;t be neutronium.</p>

I saw the Thor vs. Raiden &quot;Death Battle&quot; video yesterday, and I found out that according the Norse legends, Mjolnir was made from the remains of a dying star.

            <p>In the Avengers movie, Thor&#39;s lightning is show to be powerful enough to melt holes in Iron Man&#39;s armor. While the Iron Man suit is repeatedly torn to shreds in all it&#39;s appearances so far, it&#39;s made out of super-strong alloys and capable of withstanding a direct hit from a tank. Also, this is Tony Stark we&#39;re talking about here, who would likely include every defense against the elements he possibly could (including updated lightning protection).<br><br>Thus, Thor&#39;s lightning is far hotter than the explosion of a tank shell, and would likely do at least some damage. There you go.<br><br>Sorry for the run-on sentences.</p>

            <p>The Avengers movieverse version of Thor is different from the comics version of Thor, and the two Thors may not have the exact same capabilities and levels of power for the capabilities that they share.<br>I say it &quot;may not&quot; be the same Thor because a quick Google search told me that &quot;Thor: God of Thunder&quot;, the Thor incarnation that the first post said the fight was dealing with, was a MARVEL NOW! comic series, which would make it the comics&#39; Thor, or at least <i>a</i> comics&#39; Thor. Yet, the same title is also given to the Thor movie licensed video game, which would presumably use the same Thor or at least one with the same combat potential as the Marvel Cinematic Universe Thor, which would mean that your point would unequivocally apply.<br>Canon apocrypha can be difficult.<br><br>Basically, you&#39;ve got to have consistent universe framing for this sort of fight speculation. Starscream G1, Unicron Trilogy Starscream, and Transformers Animated Starscream have different abilities and levels of power, so treating them all as &quot;Starscream&quot; would keep the potentials from being objective, so it should be the same with &quot;Thor&quot;.<br>Transformers Animated Starscream might even be able to take certain versions of Thor on, since the Allspark fragment embedded in his head gives him enhanced powers (also, the head apparently becomes indestructible, but that&#39;s a minor detail) and blasts from his weapons are capable of ripping apart buildings, which makes him much more powerful than the G1 Starscream, who as World-Jumper said, really only had the Null-ray going for him aside from the traditional plane-caliber missiles that most Thors would probably just be knocked back a few meters by.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d guess no, but I&#39;m not sure. The train-and-volcanoes plan has the sort of hyperbole common in trollfics, but the rest of it is just pure insanity that&#39;s very hard to replicate- even the legendary Squirrelking was more comprehensible than this. You&#39;d think that if a troll came up with something as mindbendingly stupid as the drill plan, (s)he&#39;d at least want to make sure the reader knew what it <i>was</i>.</p>

            <p>Your subject hit it right on the money. Even skimming through the &quot;chapters,&quot; I can see that this fic needs a LOT of help. Can someone with some amount of patience send some concrit his way?

            <p>You are right in that case.

Kind of.<br><br>But, seriously, what is going on here? Apparently &quot;Danso Fowl Juillet&quot; is trying to stop a drill from going to the core of &quot;thyne earth&quot;(thine Earth?) because Julius Root doesn&#39;t like fairies any more for a reason that was never explained... and someone named Zito is involved and was somehow able to land a jet without being present, but only after filling it with his bodyguards, which would be pointless if he isn&#39;t going to be in the helicopter... but he was actually planning something the next floor down so the helicopter&#39;s entire presence is pointless... and his plan was that he wants to make the world&#39;s fastest train by cutting through the core of the planet with a laser, and also kill people with a volcano? And then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, Mulch Diggums and Holly Short are there, and do nothing of note before the story just stops.<br>I give up. I have no idea why anything is anywhere, and why anything is happening to anyone.<br><br>On another note, if I just drastically misread the plan-describing sentences, which is entirely possible, and Zito&#39;s actual end goal is to create trains that are powered by volcanic eruptions, and then run over all of his buisiness rivals with them, he may have created the most blindingly idiotic plan in the history of fanfiction.</p>

            <p>I <i>think</i> that Giovanni Zito*&#39;s plan is to drill into the core in order to spark volcanic eruptions that will destroy his enemies. The &quot;train tunnel through the center of the Earth&quot; thing is a cover story for that plan. How he plans to direct the volcanoes to his enemies, who his enemies <i>are</i>, and why he drills one big hole into the core instead of a bunch of little holes into the lithosphere are anyone&#39;s guess.<br><br>*In case you don&#39;t know, Zito is a famous philanthropist/environmentalist who showed up in AF canon. He was involved in an antagonist&#39;s plan to drill a hole into the fairy outpost in the Earth&#39;s core and expose it to humans, but was under fairy mind control the entire time. Once his free will was restored, he kind of dropped off the map, but one line later on mentioned that he and Artemis Fowl are on speaking terms.</p>

            <p>As some of you know, I have been working on my own future story for the PPC.

            <p>And you killed off Corolla.<br><br>Now, both Sergio and Nikki aren&#39;t in the PPC anymore by then, but I guess they would discover what happened anyway (If Sues didn&#39;t attack where they are, that is) but ooh, boy. They&#39;re gonna to be pissed off.<br><br>The fact is...<br><br>SPOILERS<br><br>Sergio is a Stu who more or less reformed on his own... and suffered the loss of several friends already. Suffering some more at the hands of Sues, especially after he retired... it&#39;s snapping time, especially if the Sues somehow manage to get Nikki too.<br><br>And if he snaps, it will be something along the lines to wear a black cloak, a Crysis-verse nanosuit and a Just Cause-verse grappling hook, dual wield a lightsaber and a Patriot from Metal Gear-verse, and allow a Sueness relapse... in order to fight the Sues with their very own methods. &#39;Cause by then he would be enough insane to make such a thing <i>work</i>.<br><br>&quot;If only a Sue is strong enough to kill another Sue...

            <p>That is a bad future.  It is, in fact, the worst that I thought I could get away with in the PPC.<br><br>I like your idea about Sergio purposefully relapsing to get revenge.  I think it fits in really well with the world I&#39;ve laid out here.  I honestly don&#39;t know where Sergio and Nikki are in this future.  They may be dead, or Sued.  Or, they may have gotten out before the initial invasion and subsequent occupation.  If that is the case, they very probably can&#39;t get back in.  They might fight the Sues in the Word Worlds looking for a way in, or just to do what damage they can.<br><br>That is up to your imagination.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Yep.  You caught me.  I stole it all from the Badfic Game.  I never expected anyone to look there.  But I&#39;ve been caught.  Whatever shall I do?<br><br>Nah, I was actually unaware that &#39;Patron PPC Demi-Goddess&#39; had written such a story.  If I&#39;d known, I definitely wouldn&#39;t have made mine so similar. Just look at these two sections:<br><br><b>From CT:</b>  The halls of HQ had seen better days. Walls were crumbling and covered in Suvian graffiti. Doors lay broken on the floor, if they were there at all. Piles of debris littered the hallways. Sparks shot intermittently from breaches in the Generic Surface. There were occasional stains on the floors and walls, in a variety of colors and levels of sparkle, that were best not to speculate about. <br><br><b>From TC:</b>  Things were looking bleak now. What once was had been reduced into a mockery of a head quarters. There wasn’t a place where you stepped that was not covered with something. Blood. Fertilizer. Debris and sliced wires, lost limbs and poured guts. Sparks were flying out every once in a while from the wires that were hanging loose from the ceiling. Broken glass and plaster crunched underfoot. <br><br><br>Really similar stuff.  Eerily similar, you might say.  I mean, did you notice the abbreviations?  CT and TC?  I smell a conspiracy.<br><br>Actually, I imagine they had some of the same inspirations that I did.  There&#39;s nothing inherent in the setting that is new and different, after all.  Pretty standard for a post-apocalyptic future.  The big difference is, I think, in the fact that they (GreyLadyBast, I assume?) were attempting to write Badfic (should I worry that my story is so similar to intentional badfic?  I&#39;m not sure).<br><br>Anyway, interesting find, hS.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>That&#39;s the only chapter of the only story she ever wrote, and I don&#39;t seem to have noted down her username in the source code like I tried to do. I would have assumed Bast - it was 2006, so I guess she was still around - but it could also have been whoever was behind the Dark Canine God Kit (my memory&#39;s saying Teena?), or simply someone coming up with a suitably Badficcy name. It doesn&#39;t read like Bast, at any rate.<br><br>But yeah, &#39;HQ is smashed and someone should go back in time to fix it&#39; isn&#39;t a particularly unique concept. ;) I think the reason CT feels like TC - and Triple Prime and Trousers didn&#39;t - is that you and PPDG both described the broken HQ. Part of the &#39;bad&#39; in this badfic is that it was written to be UltraDarkSerious, which we try to avoid in the PPC. Any section of an actual fic which takes a dark and serious approach to something is likely to spark off similarities with <i>something</i> on FfL.<br><br>hS</p>

You can probably at least extract character descriptions (we have a lovely badfic-y description of Cygna: &#39;Cygna lifted her eyes to the mirror. She looked at her wavy crimson tresses and saw a carrot-colored, frizzy horror; looked at her emerald orbs and saw pale green eyes; looked at the delicate spattering of freckles on her nose and saw a horrible disfigurement.&#39;), but obviously the plot is irrelevant.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>This was <i>good</i>. Really, really good. You set the tone very well - things just feel desperate, very nearly hopeless, in a realistic and not-overdone way. Even if the POV characters aren&#39;t quite at the end of their ropes, knowing how far down this is from the PPC &#39;present&#39; sets the reader in a very dark place. It&#39;s hard to fully express - the imagery and thought of HQ being so utterly destroyed, unsafe on a permanent level/timeframe is very, very unsettling. Somehow this managed to be more deeply devastating than Emergencies, or even the Crashing Down stories (though it might be that I haven&#39;t read those in too long). It&#39;s like having a dream of your childhood home (or some comparable safe space) eating you alive, or something. Especially the thing where - I don&#39;t quite know if this was intentional, though I assume it was - the hallways aren&#39;t the whimsical &quot;don&#39;t think about your destination&quot; sort of way they usually are. It&#39;s... bleak. And it does that job very, very well.<br><br>Less bleakly, I look forward to a continuation! If you&#39;re doing one? Which I assume you are. Hope you are, anyway.<br><br>I&#39;d also managed to completely forget that you were using Jof here, but I&#39;m glad he worked with the story, and thank you for the use and characterization and such.</p>

            <p>Super exciting!  I love seeing a super dark and deadly What-If; I especially love seeing one that can be prevented.  This will give Oopart some serious work to do back in the present timeline.  (Back in the present?  What?)<br><br>The thing that really makes the Department of Resistance feel unified and cohesive is the huge amount of cameos you threw in.  It really makes this story feel like a (possible future) culmination of the last few years&#39; worth of PPC writing.<br><br>Also, I need to take a moment to be disproportionately egotistical.  When I saw Doc&#39;s name in the list of dead, I was like, &quot;Yeah, he would get pwned pretty hard.&quot;  Then, when you mentioned the Sueified characters, I felt like Vania would wind up in that group, and figured that would be the end of my cameos.  AND THEN I got to the Council at the end and was like HOLY CRAP one of my dudes IS LIKE MAJOR and then I spent about two hours trying to imagine how Vania wound up there.<br><br>. . . Uh, so yeah.  Thank you for that!  It really made my day.  I think I&#39;d like to explore what happened to my agents in this timeline eventually, once you have your main parts finalized.  Lots to do in the present in the mean-time, though.</p>

            <p>I agree with you on the cameos.  I needed a quick and dirty way to show how many the PPC had lost, as well as how the survivors were doing, and cameos were the best way to make that happen.  It also allowed the story to connect on an emotional level that just saying &quot;we lost more than 3/4 of the PPC&quot; never would have.<br><br>I&#39;m glad I had you speculating about where Vania was.  That was the point of not telling anyone who&#39;s names were behind that curtain.  I wanted to give people&#39;s imaginations enough freedom to fill in the details.

            <p>I especially liked the building up of the setting. That&#39;s some masterfully paced dread-stuffs there. I certainly wouldn&#39;t want to be caught there, and the fact that there&#39;s a sense of ever-present danger helped a lot. Yeah, masterfully done dread-stuffs is always awesome.<br><br>I also like Oopard as a character: he&#39;s wracked by guilt, he&#39;s in a life of danger, and he&#39;s being selected for a mission that he doesn&#39;t really know even the half of. His lot is kind of sorry, and I do hope he succeeds in his mission since he seems like a nice enough guy. I&#39;d especially love to see his reaction to meeting agents he knows from the future well before he ever met them, but... y&#39;know.<br><br>Sorry, I&#39;m probably not saying anything particularly helpful about this writing, but I loved it! So... Yeah. It was great.<br><br>(P.S. I&#39;d be kind of interested to know how Eusabius got that scar, IMO.)</p>

            <p>&quot;Masterfully paced dread-stuffs&quot;?  I like it.<br><br>As to Oopart, I&#39;m glad the guilt came through.  That was kind of an important thing, for me.  Whether he succeeds or not is going to have to wait until Part 2, I&#39;m afraid.<br><br>Also, if you want to know how Eusabius got that scar, you might eventually get a chance to find out.  Just not from me, probably.  Once I have finished the story, I might open up the timeline to other interested people, with my permission and some additional information to keep things consistent.  It would all have to be set between the start of the invasion and the end of <i>The End Is Nigh!</i>, of course.  Some people will want to have a say in what happened to their agents, and this would be a chance to do that.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve read this several times now, and I think it&#39;s brilliant. <br><br>It was very interesting to read about a situation where the Sues actually <i>won</i>. The occupation of HQ would be a major triumph for them, even if they couldn&#39;t achieve total victory.

            <p>You are much better at writing a defeat/resistance scenario than I&#39;ve ever been (which is why I&#39;ve tried to avoid it in my own Histories on either side). You manage to evoke both fear and determination in Oopart&#39;s movements in the first part, and then follow it up with an extremely realistic (if I can use the term) portrayal of how the Department of Resistance might work. Jof&#39;s contribution is ingenious, and I was genuinely moved by the Tomb and the Lists.<br><br>I noticed a whole heap of both explicit references (&#39;Why we sing it we don&#39;t know/We can&#39;t make the words rhyme properly!&#39;) and what appear to be &#39;inspired by&#39; sections. Two in particular caught my eye. First, Oopart&#39;s reading of the List was similar to Vimes&#39; Disorganiser in <i>Jingo</i>, with its final list of &#39;death of [Name]... death of [Name]&#39;. Actually I think you missed a trick here - the impact of that list would have been greater if you put Lux&#39;s name right at the end, as a sort of climax (if you&#39;ll pardon the pun). I think if it ran as it does, but ended with &#39;Zim. Otik Horak. Luxury.&#39;, it would drive home the emotional point (that no-one is safe just by being a long-term character) even better. (I&#39;m not sure this actually <i>was</i> an &#39;inspired by&#39;, but it evokes the same feel)<br><br>The other reference I picked up on particularly was the Hippie Sequoia&#39;s sacrifice/defence. Okay, he quotes Gandalf, but that&#39;s not what I mean. I&#39;m thinking of the actions of Jedi Master <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ood_Bnar">Ood Bnar</a> during the fall of Ossus, in the Star Wars Expanded Universe. He, too, turns himself into a rooted tree with the knowledge that it will kill him, in order to save something of greater value to him than his life.<br><br>And... well, if you <i>are</i> referencing/inspired by that, it might be a good idea to note something of the sort in your disclaimer. We recently read the account of the Cassandra Claire Plagiarism Debacle, and not noting that she&#39;d taken whole heaps of quotes from other sources was one of the catalysts for that. Kaitlyn says that she had a whole file of Cassie Claire quotes saved - with no knowledge at the time that most of them weren&#39;t hers.<br><br>You&#39;re no Cassie Claire (thank the stars!), and the Sequoia&#39;s scene is very powerful in its own right, even without knowing the (possible) inspiration. But if you&#39;ve done a similar thing in other places, it would be nice to know about it.<br><br>Okay, enough twitchy!hS. I liked &#39;Don&#39;t like, don&#39;t eat&#39;! I also thought you did very well with the attack, but also with the little things: lines like &#39;She was not one of the lucky ones.&#39; are very powerful, because you&#39;re evoking the common idea that &#39;The ones who died were the lucky ones&#39; without actually saying it - because it doesn&#39;t need saying, because your audience already knows that.<br><br>And that ending... very well-paced, very suitably disastrous. Like I said - I&#39;m impressed! And the little details (such as the perpetual watermill) keep on coming, even when the plot speeds up. So all in all - well done, and I can&#39;t wait to see the next part.<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: Once <i>The Trousers of Time</i>, <i>Triple Prime</i> and <i>Catastrophe Theory</i> have more written about them, I think we definitely need a non-canonical collision of all the different time-travellers and their associates... ~hS)</p>

            <p>Part of the reason I went the way I did with this story is because we&#39;d never seen the PPC in defeat.  It had splintered, yes.  It had fought armies and itself.  But when it came down to it, they still got the job done when it was over.  So I felt there was an envelope worth pushing, there.  I&#39;m glad it worked as well as it did.<br><br>As to the references, I wish I had remembered the Disorganizer.  That&#39;s the reason <i>Jingo</i> is one of my favorite books in the series.  And I see your point about the list.  It is something I might fix later, since I need Nesh to actually do that.<br><br>The Hippie Sequoia scene did reference a couple of things, but the Star Wars EU was not among them, because I have no knowledge beyond the movies.  Before the Gandalf quote, the Sequoia actually combines two Star Trek quotes, which is fitting, given her job.<br><br>I&#39;m surprised, with your mention of <i>Jingo,</i> earlier, that you didn&#39;t mention the other oblique Discworld reference.  &quot;Operation Sweeper&quot; was, of course, named for a little man with a broom who mucks about with time, when it is absolutely necessary.<br><br>I am very glad that you enjoyed this.  It was, at times, both a joy to write and very difficult to write.  The dream sequence, in particular, still makes me choke up, and I wrote the thing.<br><br>The next part will likely be a little while, due to other irons in other fires.  But I might write a few more short stories to flesh out some details that were unimportant to the main story, but I think are pretty interesting.<br><br>-Phobos, destroyer of worlds</p>

            <p>Okay, that seems a little out of the blue... let me explain:<br><br>In the course of <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=247925;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">saying hello</a> to Artemis Mk. 2, I talked about the DIA, and specifically Black and Irvine, written by the original Artemis. Their missions used to be hosted on the Bad Roleplay Department website, which, alas, died with Geocities.<br><br>Not that I was going to let that stop me! I prowled the web looking for the various sites which had archived bits of Geocities, sure that at least one of them must have something. And finally, I found that <a href="http://www.oocities.org/">the Oocities site</a> has a unified search engine (in the top right corner) - one which will pull up results from <i>all</i> the salvaged Geocities archives!<br><br><i>Brilliant!</i> I thought. <i>I may not be able to find the BRD, but surely there&#39;ll be</i> something<i> of value in there!</i><br><br>(Yes, I am getting to the point)<br><br>Well... no. Or rather, yes, there is. Among the saved websites are Hellga&#39;s SIELU collection, the JAAKSONS, the missions of Dee and Milask, Suicide and Diocletian... whole heaps of pretty important stuff from the early days of the PPC!<br><br>And it&#39;s all entirely useless, because Neshomeh has saved every single thing I can find (with the exception of a handful of &#39;I made this page but never posted any missions or anything&#39; sites) to the <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/">Lost Tales</a>. So there&#39;s nothing left for me to do!<br><br>Seriously. I&#39;m very impressed. Well done, Nesh - and thanks!<br><br>hS</p>

Pretty much everything that used to be hosted on OddLots is <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/">on your site</a> now, right? Sure made my job a lot easier, especially when I set about archiving the Original Series. If you hadn&#39;t saved the OddLots main page, I never would&#39;ve figured out something was missing and found &quot;The Dark Elf.&quot; {= )<br><br>... Also, visiting that page again, I can now pin a date on the founding of SIELU, which will be handy for the timeline of the Department of Floaters I&#39;ve been working on in anticipation of sprucing up its wiki page. And there are several other dates recorded, too, which is awesome—we can know for certain when some of the last TOS missions were released, for instance. So, thanks for saving such valuable historical data!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>In light of there being so many people, myself included, who have just started or are about to start college/university, I thought it might be a good time for a thread about it. In light of that...what&#39;s the coolest thing about your college or uni? And what&#39;s your favorite part so far? I feel like this could be an interesting discussion...<br><br>My uni has a sort of pool...with a pair of geese in it. Or maybe they&#39;re ducks; I&#39;m not completely sure. But seriously...geese? Wow. Yay Canada! :D<br><br>I&#39;m still working on my favorite part, though. What can I say, I haven&#39;t even finished my first day yet.<br><br>People in middle-school (do we have any?), high school, and so on (work, grad school, etc, I expect) are also welcome to share answers to these questions!<br><br>And feel free to have some fun...I myself am working on writing a sort of OFUM-based first-day-of-school horror story which may never be posted as my classes are so far interesting enough for me not to tune out. Bother.<br><br>Anyone else? Share your experiences! Make us envy you for where you study! Write chilling tales of terror that will terrify us terrifically...okay, I think academia has started to affect me. But like I said, feel free to have some fun; I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be interesting!<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: Two people so far have asked me for directions. Do I look approachable? Comfortable? Like the second-year student I&#39;m not? Hm...<br>Ooh. That could go in the horror story...<br>~DF</p>

            <p>The air conditioning system was broken at my university today. There was a heat wave. It got up to about 95 degrees and with the humidex it felt like 115. The workers who would fix the AC system... are on strike. </p>

            <p>... well, somewhere. I can&#39;t actually place the memory - it may be as far back as school (which, good grief, makes it over ten years ago). Wherever it was, we had air conditioning, which was great! Except that there was a six month lag in when they turned the thing on. So it was entirely non-functional in summer, and on full-blast in winter. Yeah, I don&#39;t think we were very impressed.<br><br>Fortunately, nowadays I have access to the aircon remote... ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>And also the worst, at times. But mostly the best.<br><br>Phobos and I both went to a really small college in the middle of Michigan, so it wasn&#39;t exactly the most exciting territory, but the people more than made up for it.

            <p>I&#39;m liking my university so far, but the fifteen-minute walk across campus sounds nice right about now--my campus is so huge I can safely say I haven&#39;t ever even gone around it, and they don&#39;t even stop with residences--they have a <i>village</i>. It&#39;s kind of insane. It&#39;s a gorgeous campus, though, and they&#39;ve set up the insides of the buildings fairly well too, so I can&#39;t complain about that...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>It is indeed full of trees. Trees and fields in the lower peninsula, trees and more trees in the upper peninsula. There are also some really nice rivers, and of course the shoreline. There are some great beaches and some really awful ones. The further north you go, the more rocks there are, which is great if you&#39;re into rock-hunting. Michigan also boasts some pretty cool landforms such as the Sleeping Bear Dunes and the Pictured Rocks. Overall, it&#39;s very pretty.<br><br>Alas, the weather can be pretty terrible. It&#39;s... well, kind of a swamp, what with being low-lying and full of water, so it&#39;s humid a lot, and &quot;allergy season&quot; is basically all year. And then there&#39;s the economy, which was tanking even before the recession hit, not to mention the current government, which seems to be trying its damnedest to kill democracy, but I won&#39;t say any more about that. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>In conclusion, Michigan&#39;s a nice place to visit, but you wouldn&#39;t want to actually live there—not right now, anyway.<br><br>As for my cat, his name is Merlin, and I have a picture!<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v155/Neshomeh/merlin11-18.jpg" alt="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v155/Neshomeh/merlin11-18.jpg"><br><br>Also featuring my right knee and the edge of my lap desk.

            <p>At least there&#39;s already a pre-defined aesthetic. The mad scientist supervillain outfit just needs a few tweaks to make it truly one&#39;s own, but if he decided to stick to the classic model, it&#39;s hard to go wrong with lab coats and giant robots. Just imagine it: a Tolkien elf in a billowing lab coat and thick goggles, standing atop a three-story machine and laughing manaically while it launches acid into a nearby city. I admit it&#39;s a little expected, but if someone tries to call you out on it, giant robots excel at looming menacingly and swatting people across city blocks.<br><br>Wait, he&#39;d be chemistry-themed. You don&#39;t make robots with chemistry. You power them with chemistry, though. That might be enough of a stretch. Even if there isn&#39;t a robot, he&#39;d probably need some kind of device, because a science-themed villain often has very weak or indirect supernatural abilities and he&#39;s going to need something to fight off the helicopters they&#39;ll send after him once he robs the Science Symposium to get the last ingredients to build his superweapon or cloning ray or giant acid monster or what have you.<br>Hold on... would a cloning ray be biology, or would the necessary biochemical functions to maintain clones allow it to fall under chemistry? Planning for this sort of thing is more difficult than I thought it would be.</p>

Because that could be pretty awesome.<br><br>(I&#39;m quite tempted now to, in the tradition of the Jaycacia stories, have a scene of the real Agent hS reacting to the badfic. Not sure if it will go in, but, out of curiosity, would you be willing to write that scene? You obviously know him a good deal better than I do*...)<br><br>Also, a picture? Why? I mean, awesome, but who drew it? Why did they draw it? How mad of a mad scientist?<br><br>~DF<br><br>*Said lack of knowledge will probably result in even more badficcy badfic, so I&#39;ll do my best to just make a series of assumptions in order to write this...</p>

            <p>I actually started at this university in the Spring quarter, so I&#39;ve been cooling my heels here since the Summer quarter ended... and Fall quarter&#39;s at the end of the month. But my favorite thing about <i>campus</i> is the crows. They&#39;re <i>everywhere</i> and wicked smart and becoming quite friendly to me.<br><br>Really there are cool things all over though, and since I moved here from about 2800 miles East-Southeast, everything about the valley and town is new. Mostly the most awesome thing so far is the church, actually, which also hits &quot;workplace&quot; in a roundabout way - I started tentatively attending, then got informally adopted en masse by about 1/3 of the congregation, and then because I was having trouble finding a job and had nothing to do, I started working on the grounds.<br><br>And then, despite repeated warning to not work too hard/take it easy, I proceeded to get really intense about working the grounds, and started spending pretty much all day pulling weeds and wrestling bushes and fallen limbs. An awesome way to spend the summer... and also sort of an awesome way of eating all my time. Which is why I&#39;ve not been around here as often. Still reading! Just a lot less energy to respond.<br><br>My favorite part of the university, though, is the newspaper. It&#39;s awesome and the folks are awesome and even though I&#39;d rather be a reporter I&#39;m gonna be assistant news editor starting Fall. It&#39;s all very exciting!</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve started my first year of grad school a few weeks ago. My school is in a very large city that attracts a lot of famous people, so there&#39;s always a lot going on. I think there&#39;s an X Factor audition today because I heard some people talking about it. <br><br>Peter S Beagle stopped by my school during the tour for The Last Unicorn movie. I&#39;ve met him before and he is just the nicest person. If you like his work, definitely try to meet him if you can. He makes a lot of time for his fans and has some great stories!<br><br>Hmm. What else is interesting about my school?<br><br>There are a couple of bars on campus. I went to a small institution for my undergrad, so it&#39;s still amazing that this campus has so many food places. I spend most of my time in one building, so I don&#39;t really experience everything. <br><br>Does anyone else&#39;s school bookstores sell Hello Kitty plushes with your school&#39;s logo on a little shirt? I think they&#39;re adorable and I&#39;ve bought them from my undergrad and grad schools. XD</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a really crazy place, I&#39;ll just say that. It&#39;s not surrounded by much except a bigger university, but that just makes the area pretty nice and healthy by comparison, so I&#39;ll just leave that be.<br><br>As for my favorite part... I have two. The one is my current composition teacher (who&#39;s frickin&#39; amazing at what he does), and the other is the electronic music room (which has a bunch of synthesizers plus a computer, keyboard, and hard drive full of all these awesome virtual instruments).

            <p>My last Uni was in the home of Rugby League (you can guess which sport we specialized in), and we had the Sir Patrick Stewart (AKA Jean Luc Picard, Charles Xavier etc etc.) as our chancellor, even better? I got to speak to him once (I then joked with my friends &quot;Right that&#39;s it, that&#39;s all I came here for I&#39;m leaving&quot; and lo and behold I&#39;m not there anymore.) We also had our own Games Studio that released games onto the Xbox Arcade and have a Canal running right through our campus (complete with a lock and the occasional barge).<br><br>That&#39;s just about it for my University besides the notorious bad weather, but that&#39;s England for you.  </p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to be honest it wasn&#39;t planned or anything. It was after our last exam of term me and a couple of mates had finished early and were allowed out and we were waiting for the exam to end, so we&#39;re chatting outside the hall and suddenly we look up the steps to the main block and there he was walking down with some assistants or something like that. Spotting us hanging around he stopped said &quot;Hello&quot; to us, asked why we were hanging around there and then wished us good luck in our exam before moving on. <br><br>Best bit is that if you do Drama at the Uni in final year he can even comes in and teach a couple of the classes. </p>

            <p>I feel really childlike compared to y&#39;all. I&#39;m in High School.<br><br>Anything cool? Well, We celebrated our school&#39;s 50 year anniversary. Oh, and it&#39;s located in a forest. No joke, for track, we used to go running on the trails in the forest...that our school is located in. It&#39;s also next to a power station. And there&#39;s a graveyard nearby...I feel a bit scared because GRAVEYARD.<br>Oh and one year during our recess, we swung on vines. Like Tarzan. I&#39;m not kidding. We also got to explore the forest and trails for P.E and recess and fun. And we see deer a lot. <br>But I think the best part about my school is the teachers.I&#39;ve known them for a while due to going to a small private school and the fact that some of them taught me in middle school. They are really dedicated to their jobs and a lot of them have talents/hobbies/occupations/etc. we wouldn&#39;t expect;  my former Math teacher was a ballet dancer and choreographs the school&#39;s musicals, my Biology teacher was a Nurse and a Cheer leading coach. I had two teachers that loved Star Trek and many fandoms in general.<br>I guess that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got. Kinda plain, but I like it.</p>

(It&#39;s a small school; about 400 including the teachers.)<br><br>Also the location&#39;s really pretty; it&#39;s in the Presidio, a forest-park-thing right near the Bay (I live in San Francisco) and everyone&#39;s very nice, including the teachers. <br><br>Lastly, it seems like half the school, at least, knows what fandom is, so that made me happy.<br><br>I rather like it.<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>To expand on this: I have been out of college for four years (Aie-yai) and before that I was in college before I joined the PPC (though technically I never actually joined the PPC, more like adopted really) back in the fall of 2000.<br><br>You kids seriously make me feel old, but when I say that I&#39;ve been online (actively) for sixteen years, that says something in itself.<br><br>With that said, I loved College. It was there that I learned to drink cold coffee on a regular basis since we couldn&#39;t bring the drinks into the classroom due to all the pricey computers, and with hour long lectures at the beginning with the break after, coffee was then cold.<br><br>Though my program was a bit on the crazy side (three - five projects a week - due every two), it was fun and I probably would do it again in a heart beat. The friends definitely made it worth while. Even though it was four years ago, a group of us still get together regularly every few months to have coffee at Tim Horton&#39;s and catch up or just talk about stupid stuff like new movies and the like.<br><br>I also don&#39;t think I&#39;m entirely finished with college either.

I had a gap between high school (class of `03) and my first two years, then another gap between my first two and my second two and a half, wherein I transferred from community college to four-year college.<br><br>Still, there&#39;s a few of us &quot;real adults&quot; kicking around, though I think we tend to stretch the definition a little in our circles. I figure being a grown-up means you get to pursue whatever silly hobbies you like and no one can make you stop, so I say live it up! Y&#39;know, just as long as the bills get paid and no one is starving or naked. {; )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

I found out a year and a half later that I was not cut out for animation and then took a four year break to figure out what I wanted/need/could do.

            <p>Back in the 1880s, my university ran <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%C2%96Morley_experiment">an experiment</a> that became one of the foundations of relativity theory.

            <p>Dear Future PPC Community Members,<br><br>Hi! Am I still around? If so, HI, FUTURE ME! I hope you&#39;re as awesome as you should be and haven&#39;t turned (even more) crotchety! And if you&#39;re not the one reading this, I hope whoever is passes on my greeting. Wow, that would be kind of cool, wouldn&#39;t it? A personalised greeting from your past self?<br><br>... is the thought process that led to this message. Because recently I&#39;ve been looking over the Board&#39;s archives, and I thought it would be nice to leave something for <i>our</i> future.<br><br>So, hi! It&#39;s 2013. The PPC has been in existence for about eleven years, and the Board has been here for most of that. As I write, we&#39;re on our second (third?) PPC chat - this one is usually referred to as &#39;the IRC&#39;. We have our own Wiki, with about two and a half thousand articles. And our plans for world domination have reached Phase Nine-Point-Five.<br><br>... no, all right, I&#39;m kidding about that last one. We&#39;re only on Phase Six.<br><br>We have the usual population profile - lots of newbies, a whole bunch of Middlebies, and a small collection of Very Oldbies (like, say, me). A lot of our newbies these days come from a website called TVTropes, which has changed the demographics somewhat from the days when we were all refugees from Fanfiction.net. But hey, I assume your current source of influx is, like, a dating website or something. Times change, the Board remains.<br><br>Or does it?!?!?andotherpunctuation Certainly at the moment there seems to be no chance of the PPC giving up on the concept of a Board, but maybe things are different in the future. Hey, if you have time travel, could you... no, scratch that. I don&#39;t think I want to know what things are like. It might be depressingly bad - or depressingly good.<br><br>So where was I? We have a solid bunch of writers, working on missions, AUs, interludes - I&#39;ve just finally written <i>Origins</i>. We have an active community in the IRC (or so I&#39;m told - I don&#39;t visit). One thing we haven&#39;t had in a while is a UK Gathering, but we&#39;re hoping to pin one down sometime next year.<br><br>Anyway, I don&#39;t want to bore you, so I&#39;ll hang up now (that&#39;s a reference to telephones - the non-mobile kind - look, ask your parents, okay? Or, if you&#39;re a LONG way in the future, your grandparents). But I have a strong feeling (hint, hint!) that others in the community would like to leave you a message, too! So go for it, guys - I hope you can be funnier than me. ;)<br><br>Thank you for reading, Future!PPCers. I hope your world is as awesome as ours.<br><br>hS <br> </p>

            <p>(Although I will point out that &#39;Jay and Acacia started a series&#39; is where it all began; the stories begat the community, not the other way round!)<br><br>The PPC has always been a shared universe where things changed. New agents come in and out, and put their own spin on things. New concepts show up - like the recent advent of four separate &#39;fall of the future PPC&#39; timelines - and either work or get forgotten. New chunks of the community appear - I was here before the Wiki - and disappear - I remember the Livejournal agent journals. And occasionally something pops up like the city in New Caledonia that changes the whole shape of things.<br><br>But for all that, actually, a lot of things are static. Agents are still using the same technology that was established in the first few years of writing - the last <i>major</i> innovation was TARDISes back in 2008. The list of departments is largely static, having come to a stable state with (roughly) the Departments of Temporal Offenses, Angst, and WhatThe. The proceedure for carrying out a mission has been standardised (back in the day, Bad Slash didn&#39;t have charge lists!). While people keep coming up with new bleeproducts and Suvian colours, they don&#39;t actually get used all that much - the defaults are still bleeprin, bleepka, urple and wilver.<br><br>In fact, the PPC is <i>basically</i> the same now as it was five years ago. But five years before <i>that</i>, practically none of it existed (and Despatch was a major department!). So what&#39;ll happen in another five years?<br><br>No answers from me! But <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/CastList/CastTree.htm#Hyrax1">Tia Hyrax</a> will be 14 years old and in training to join the <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndSlope.htm">Department of Bad Slash</a> - back when I joined in 2003, she was still a year away from being born! Now that&#39;s what I call an achievement.<br><br>hS</p>

It&#39;s liable to shoot anything you put into it right back into your face. <br><br>I&#39;ve just started a new school year, so I haven&#39;t had much time to post, but I&#39;ll be back more now that things have settled down.

I&#39;ll paste it in for those having trouble with the docs:<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b>Degenerate Regenerate</b><br><br>“He’s dead, Jim - but not as we know it.”<br><br>The Supporter exchanged a blank look with the Archivist. “Um… who’s Jim?”<br><br>The Pathologist stared at the pair for a moment. “Er. Okay. It doesn’t matter.” She lowered her voice for a moment into a barely-audible mutter: “Primitives. What matters is that he’s dead… only not.”<br><br>“You’re going to have to explain that a bit better,” the Archivist suggested. “Because that wasn’t an explanation.”<br><br>“Right, right.” The Pathologist ran a hand through her hair. “Okay. You know Christmas?”<br><br>“With the eggs and things?” The Archivist frowned. “No, that’s the other one…”<br><br>“Trees,” the Supporter supplied. “And presents, and jolly red aliens coming down the chimney.”<br><br>“You wouldn’t be ‘jolly’ if you were that morbidly obese,” the Pathologist observed, “but I digress. It’s the trees I’m thinking about. They’re dead, yes?”<br><br>“They don’t have to be,” the Archivist pointed out. “That last planet we stopped over at, they grow all their plants in underground pots so they can be moved - I’ve got one back in my rooms-”<br><br>“They also killed one of our friends,” the Supporter reminded her, gesturing at the corpse under discussion.<br><br>“Oh, yes. And that’s bad. But he’ll get better, right?”<br><br>“That’s what I’m trying to <i>discuss</i>,” the Pathologist replied snippily. “A tree can be… no, look, forget the analogy. You remember his plan for getting past the Judoon and their genetic scanner?”<br><br>“I remember the Mechanic’s reaction,” the Archivist said with a slight smile. “‘You want to do what to my Chameleon Arch?’ Not that I don’t sympathise…”<br><br>“Right,” the Pathologist agreed. “So he partially altered his DNA to match the local inhabitants and fool the scanner.”<br><br>“It’s a shame it didn’t work,” the Supporter said, glancing at the body. “It was a really good plan.”<br><br>“Yes, except that DNA doesn’t work that way.” The Pathologist frowned. “Or it shouldn’t. But… okay, this next bit is going to sound painfully stupid.”<br><br>“Cool!” exclaimed the Archivist. “What? No, sorry, I mean - go ahead.”<br><br>The Pathologist took a deep breath. “When the Judoon shot him, the Time Lord part of him died as normal. But the Judoon had safeties on their guns to prevent them killing the locals even accidentally. The gun refused to kill the Arch-implanted part of his DNA - so he’s only half dead. And since regeneration relies on a Time Lord being <i>actually</i> dead, he’s stuck like this.”<br><br>“That’s awful!” The Supporter had to take a deep breath after her outburst before continuing. “How can we help him?”<br><br>“It should be fairly simple,” the Pathologist shrugged. “Once his Arch transformation is undone, he should be able to regenerate as normal. Only this partial transform didn’t take his memories, and didn’t create a capsule - so we need an intact Chameleon Arch to do it.”<br><br>“But the Mechanic took ours apart,” the Archivist pointed out. “Do we have enough time for him to reconstruct it?”<br><br>“We don’t need to!” the Supporter realised. “Archivist, you’ve got an Arch in your display room - I remember it!”<br><br>The Archivist twitched. “That’s not just a Chameleon Arch,” she pointed out. “That’s the original Arch - the one built by Rassilon himself to-”<br><br>“And it can save our friend,” the Pathologist cut her off. “Isn’t that more important?”<br><br>“No!” the Archivist wailed, but then sighed. “I suppose. Maybe.”<br><br>“Good.” The Pathologist looked at the Supporter. “Do you know where it is?”<br><br>“Absolutely,” the Supporter agreed, and dashed off. The small room was left in uncomfortable silence, the two Time Ladies not meeting each other’s gaze, until she returned.<br><br>The Archivist winced visibly as the Supporter ran back in, bouncing the Arch off the doorframe. “All right, but <i>I’m</i> setting it up,” she said, taking the device from the other woman. “It’s not that I don’t trust you, but…”<br><br>Soon enough, the Chameleon Arch was in place. The Pathologist took her place next to the machine and looked at her colleagues. “Ready?”<br><br>“Happy birthday,” the Archivist replied absently, still looking twitchy. The Pathologist shrugged and flicked the switch.<br><br>Nothing happened.<br><br>“Um…” the Supporter began.<br><br>“It’s fine,” the Pathologist assured her. “He’s just dying.”<br><br>“Oh, is that all?”<br><br>There was a sound from the body on the table - a sort of long sigh. Then, as the trio watched, his skin began to glow with rainbow light, growing more and more intense until they had to shield their eyes. There was a sudden, blinding pulse of light, and then it was over.<br><br>The Pathologist was the first to recover. Blinking away the afterimage of the light, she squinted at the newly-regenerated figure on the table. “Human,” she reported. “Apparently perfectly normal. Not sure about the hair, but at least he’s got all his teeth…” She leant forward. “Samurai? Can you hear me?”<br><br>“I say,” the Samurai replied, without opening his eyes or moving a muscle, “do you have to be so dashed loud? Some of us are trying to rest, you know.”<br><br>“He’s fine,” the Supporter surmised with a sigh of relief.<br><br>“I wouldn’t say so,” the Samurai retorted. “I’ve got the most terrible thirst.” He opened one eye, looking around furtively, and then sat jerkily upright. “Would there happen to be such a thing as a cup of tea around here?”<br><br><hr>
<br><br>As far as I can track, then, the only Time Lords without stories are the Acoustician, the Analyzer, and the Weirdo. And counting both Librarians, we have a TARDIS crew of fifteen...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Featuring, I think, everyone who&#39;s offered a name. I&#39;m not sure everyone has spoken lines, but we&#39;re all in there...<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&quot;Can we get some quiet in here?&quot;<br><br>The answer, apparently, was no. The multiple conversations went on, getting louder all the time. The Strategist scowled and looked at the Speaker, who shrugged.<br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t convince them if they can&#39;t hear me,&quot; he called over the racket. &quot;The Acoustician might be able to rig something up.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s too busy arguing with the Mechanic over whose responsibility the viewscreens are,&quot; the Strategist pointed out.<br><br>&quot;The Bluejay could probably shut them up - but again, only if they can hear her.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Precisely.&quot; The Strategist frowned around the console room. &quot;The Supporter... well, she&#39;d mean well, I&#39;m sure. Oh, now, I wonder...&quot;<br><br>The two Time Lords put their heads together. About a minute later, a new head dropped down from the gantry, fortunately attached to a body.<br><br>&quot;Hi!&quot; exclaimed the Weirdo. &quot;Anything good?&quot;<br><br>The Strategist did his best to hide a smile. &quot;Actually, yes. We wanted to talk to everyone, but they can&#39;t hear us...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s simple,&quot; the Weirdo beamed, and then yelled at the top of her lungs: &quot;Oy! You lot! Daleks!&quot;<br><br>The hubbub stopped instantly as the Time Lords looked around frantically. The Strategist nodded his gratitude to the Weirdo and hopped up onto one of the seats.<br><br>&quot;Get off that!&quot; the Mechanic yelled. &quot;Do you know how long it takes to build a safe TARDIS ejector seat?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t plan to break it,&quot; the Strategist assured him. &quot;But I need to get your attention, however many of you there are-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fifteen,&quot; four voices chorused from around the room, and the two Librarians, the Archivist, and the Analyzer exchanged satisfied looks.<br><br>&quot;Or fourteen,&quot; the Analyzer went on, &quot;if you subscribe to the belief that the Librarians are the same person.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fourteen or fifteen, a TARDIS has a crew of <i>six</i>,&quot; the Strategist pointed out. &quot;We have a severe excess of Time Lords.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, some of us aren&#39;t exactly permanent crew,&quot; the Pathologist pointed out. &quot;If you want me to take my TARDIS and go...&quot;<br><br>&quot;You can&#39;t!&quot; exclaimed the Alchemist. &quot;Who&#39;s going to patch up my burns if you go?&quot;<br><br>&quot;And that&#39;s a very significant point,&quot; the Analyzer put in. &quot;We <i>need</i> everyone in the crew.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Rubbish!&quot; the Weirdo shouted. &quot;The Artisan? The Acoustician? Four nearly-identical bookworms? The Weirdo?&quot; She blinked. &quot;Wait, that&#39;s me. Who needs me? What good am I?&quot; And she burst into tears.<br><br>&quot;Oh, don&#39;t cry!&quot; the Supporter exclaimed, running over to her. &quot;It&#39;s all right, we do need you, you&#39;re an invaluable part of the team...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Really? Brill!&quot; The Weirdo beamed at her.<br><br>Meanwhile, the First Librarian was tapping away at his tablet computer. He beckoned his possible later form over and pointed at something.<br><br>&quot;And I resent the implication that I&#39;m unnecessary,&quot; the Acoustician put in. &quot;I mean, if you <i>want</i> to go back to the days of never knowing what the away team is up to...&quot;<br><br>Now the Second Librarian, nodding in agreement with her counterpart, beckoned the Archivist over. Together they peered at the screen, and then the Archivist scurried off into the depths of the TARDIS.<br><br>&quot;Am I allowed to object too?&quot; the Artisan asked. &quot;I mean, yes, in a literal view of our mission statement, I&#39;m not &#39;necessary&#39;. But what good is helping people if you turn the universe into featureless cold metal along the way? We <i>must</i> be artists, not just soldiers. I might even say, more artists than soldiers.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, you probably would,&quot; the Samurai agreed amiably. &quot;But I must say, that would be jolly bad form. The fact that some of us are skilled with weapons rather than crafts hardly means you should belittle us.&quot;<br><br>The Archivist returned, carrying a thick book, and passed it to the Second Librarian. The latter flicked through the pages, hunting.<br><br>&quot;Personally I&#39;m amazed no-one&#39;s mentioned me yet,&quot; the Bluejay said, swinging her legs where she sat on the railing. &quot;Aren&#39;t I pretty much the definition of a tagalong?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t lay it on too thick,&quot; the Pathologist said dryly. &quot;Besides, even if you were, history - well, fiction - shows that quirky girls &#39;just along for the ride&#39; solve a significant number of major catastrophes.&quot;<br><br>The Second Librarian, having found her page, hurried over to the Analyzer and pointed at something. The latter woman frowned, then raised her eyebrow. The Librarian whispered something in her ear.<br><br>&quot;I think the real issue isn&#39;t &#39;useless in isolation&#39;,&quot; said the Mechanic. &quot;It&#39;s <i>redundancy</i>. We have - sorry, Acoustician - two engineers, four information junkies, two diplomats, three fighters... how many of each do we actually need?&quot;<br><br>&quot;As many as we can get,&quot; the Supporter said firmly. &quot;What&#39;s the alternative - telling people to pack their bags and get lost?&quot;<br><br>&quot;If necessary,&quot; the Mechanic shrugged. &quot;If a part is unnecessary, discard it.&quot;<br><br>The Analyzer, still frowning at the book, crossed the room to the Speaker. She ran her finger down the page, demonstrating something to him, then entered into a whispered conversation.<br><br>&quot;You can&#39;t talk about people as <i>parts</i>, though,&quot; the Bluejay said, uncharacteristically serious. &quot;They&#39;re - we&#39;re - people, with our own hopes and dreams, our own feelings and desires, our own-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; the First Librarian cut in. &quot;I think we can all be defined pretty quickly. As someone said, I&#39;m a bookworm, the Mechanic is an engineer, and you&#39;re a-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Manic Pixie Dream Girl?&quot; the Pathologist suggested. &quot;But she&#39;s right - even if you can define us in one word, that doesn&#39;t say <i>everything</i> about us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s a bit metaphysical for you, isn&#39;t it?&quot; the Artisan asked. &quot;I thought you were pretty down on all that &#39;messy emotional business&#39;.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Emotional?&quot; the Pathologist asked, bemused. &quot;I was talking about genetics.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Enough of this,&quot; the Strategist cut in, silencing the hubbub. &quot;The key point here is that- yes, what is it?&quot;<br><br>The Speaker had tapped his shoulder, and the Strategist leant down to listen. After a few moments he stood again, and shrugged.<br><br>&quot;Apparently,&quot; he said, &quot;a study by the United Universities of Raxacoricofallapatorius has conclusively demonstrated that, when it comes to starship crews, a larger, more varied team is always preferable. I&#39;m quite surprised, I will admit, but the Analyzer says the proof is undeniable.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, that settles it, then,&quot; the Alchemist said, grinning. &quot;You <i>have</i> to let me start up my trans-temporal replication experiments again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I said &#39;crew&#39;,&quot; the Strategist pointed out wearily, &quot;not &#39;hideous abominations that should be time-locked and forgotten&#39;.&quot;<br><br>&quot;True enough,&quot; the Alchemist mused, &quot;but on the other hand...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t even,&quot; the Pathologist cut in. &quot;Remember I know where the sedatives are...&quot;</p>

            <p>An excellent addition to the Time Lord chronicles. I know I am invested in these characters, at least somewhat, and an interested in seeing more from them. I think this weekend, if I have time, I will write out some of the Speaker&#39;s backstory, probably up to recruitment into the team in his second generation. No promises mind you...<br><br>As cool as this story was, I personally subscribe to the belief that all 15 are not present on the TARDIS at one time. The crew is more of a small community of Time Lords that will follow the Strategist whenever he needs something done, and act as resources when needed, but otherwise are left to their own devices. I see the Speaker mostly staying on the main TARDIS, as he has nothing else better to do, and the Strategist always needs a diplomat (or a charmer). As for the others, I cannot speak for them, but I would think the seven from the first story are pretty much the group that stays on the ship most of the time. However, fifteen Time Lords stuck together in a giant box is great potential for humor, as well as constantly having a ready expedition team... Whatever, it can be however anybody thinks it should be.</p>

            <p>This can only go amazing and hilarious places.<br><br>BTW, the characterization of the Archivist in &quot;Degenerate Regenerate&quot; is eerily spot-on for me. I spent a good minute giggling at &quot;Cool! ... What? No, sorry, I mean - go ahead.&quot; As Phobos will attest, I have a bad habit of making verbal responses even when I&#39;m not fully paying attention (lost in thought, trying to read something at the same time, etc.), which results in not-infrequent moments pretty much exactly like that one. Phobos has gotten me to accidentally agree to all sorts of things. ^_^;<br><br>Also, I think she would be all over delineating and possibly diagramming each person&#39;s exact role in the crew. Duty rosters and job descriptions and mission statements and otherwise making clear who is supposed to be doing what (and how, and why) at any given time is essential to the orderly and efficient operation of any sufficiently complex enterprise, and fifteen Time Lords and Ladies in a box together is about as complicated as it gets. Also, people might want to know that sort of thing in the future, so keeping records of it is good for posterity!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>...should be friends. They seem to have a similar way of looking at things - if I understand correctly, it&#39;s looking at all the small details to see how they make up the big picture.  And having lots of random trivia in their minds. And reading. And sometimes mixing up common responses. I swear I&#39;ve done &quot;Happy Birthday!&quot; &quot;You too!&quot; before. Though the Archivist seems much more about recording things, while the Analyzer likes studying the universe just because it&#39;s all so very interesting. <br><br>Oh, and as to the hair - it&#39;s the progression of hair throughout my life, the current incarnation being the closest to my current self.

            <p>I think I&#39;ll be the Analyzer. And doing regenerations sounds fun.<br><br>General Traits:<br>The thing that always stays the same about the Analyzer is her ability to think deeply about things. She tries to come at problems from new angles and enjoys exploring the complexities of the universe.<br><br>The First Analyzer:<br><img src="http://img854.imageshack.us/img854/8299/w5lh.png" alt="some_text"><br>This incarnation is very happy. She likes bright colors and smiles a lot (when not thinking). However, she&#39;s only happy as long as no one questions her thinking. She&#39;s convinced she&#39;s right about everything, and tends to disrespect authority. This alienates people, so she values the friends she makes and clings to them, not trying to make more. She died in an accident that claimed the lives of her only friends.<br><br>The Second Analyzer<br><img src="http://img826.imageshack.us/img826/2831/o0ai.png" alt="some_text"><br>This incarnation reaps the consequences from her last self&#39;s arrogance, and has difficulty making friends, retreating into her thoughts and reading most of the time. She&#39;s shy and reclusive, but still resents being ordered to do anything. She died in an accident involving an earthquake and poorly-constructed bookshelves.<br><br>The Third Analyzer (current regeneration)<br><img src="http://img.tektek.org/img/tek5234f71814a3a4.43456342.png" alt="some_text"><br>This incarnation is much more friendly than her last two, though she dislikes small talk and formalities and can come off a bit brusque at times. She&#39;s decided to apply her way of thinking to solving the problems of the universe, getting involved in multiple causes for equality. On multiple planets. She can get overwhelmed easily, but at the same time sees the universe in a very rich, detailed way. </p>

            <p>The Mechanic stuck his head out from behind a hatch and pushed his goggles up onto his forehead. &quot;All fixed,&quot; he said. &quot;Well, moderately fixed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re making me twitchy,&quot; the Librarian muttered, not glancing up from his book. &quot;Would it hurt you to at least <i>look</i> at the manual?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Where&#39;s the fun in that?&quot; the Mechanic sniffed. &quot;I mean, really - doing things by the book? That&#39;s so dull.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s right!&quot; the Artisan piped up, scrambling down a ladder from the upper gallery. &quot;Running a TARDIS is an <i>art</i>, not some complicated science! You have to <i>feel</i> your way through it. If you don&#39;t love your TARDIS, you-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, spare me.&quot; The Alchemist walked into the console room, white coat billowing behind him. &quot;All this &#39;art and science are totally separate&#39; business - the trick is to <i>synthesise</i> them. Logic and emotion aren&#39;t antithetical, no matter what Doctor Spock says.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s <i>Mister</i> Spock,&quot; the Librarian pointed out, &quot;or if you want to get technical, <i>Science Officer</i> Spock. At least until he became Ambassador Spock, and-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, yes.&quot; The Alchemist tapped a button on the console and peered at the screen. &quot;The stabilisers are still reading as down...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Really? Let me see.&quot; The Mechanic frowned at the data printout, then pulled a large rubber mallet from his toolbelt and tapped the screen sharply. &quot;That should do it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Great!&quot; exclaimed the Bluejay from where she perched on the railing. &quot;So are we ready to go?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not until the Betrayer gets here,&quot; the Librarian pointed out.<br><br>&quot;You really shouldn&#39;t call him that,&quot; the Speaker chided him, standing up at last from his position by the main doors. &quot;It&#39;s exceptionally rude to refuse to use the name someone has chosen in favour of an insulting epithet.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, if he didn&#39;t betray people all the time...&quot; the Artisan put in, but trailed off in the face of the Speaker&#39;s gaze.<br><br>&quot;I ask you,&quot; the Speaker went on, &quot;each of you - how would <i>you</i> feel if you were known by invented nicknames? If people kept calling you &#39;the Flighty&#39;,&quot; he nodded at the Bluejay, &quot;or &#39;the Erratic&#39;,&quot; to the Mechanic, &quot;or &#39;the Explosive&#39;,&quot; to the Alchemist.<br><br>&quot;Well, speaking for myself, I wouldn&#39;t mind-&quot; the Alchemist began. Then one of the doors swung open, and the Strategist strode in. He was, as usual, dressed all in black, and already scowling.<br><br>&quot;Well?&quot; he asked in the sudden silence. &quot;What are we waiting for?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A TARDIS requires a crew of six,&quot; the Librarian pointed out. &quot;You were absent.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was planning,&quot; the Strategist corrected, &quot;and you already have six crew members here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, I&#39;m just along for the ride,&quot; the Bluejay called chirpily. &quot;Don&#39;t mind me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hm.&quot; The Strategist crossed to the console and took his place in front of one of the six segments, standing next to the Alchemist and the Mechanic. &quot;But I am here <i>now</i>,&quot; he pointed out. &quot;So, I ask again - what are we waiting for?&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I&#39;ve tried to give everyone personalities suggested by their names. Actual accuracy to real life not guaranteed.<br><br>(Also, these characters are really fun to work with. If you don&#39;t believe me, try it yourself!)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><b>The First Alchemist</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Alch1.png"><br><br>This incarnation still used his given name. He spent his entire life on Gallifrey as a theoretical exotic chemist, basically achieving nothing of significance, before finally dying at the hands of Something Bad out of Gallifrey&#39;s past.<br><br><b>The Second Alchemist</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Alch2.png"><br><br>This is the &#39;darkest&#39; Alchemist. He devoted himself to studying the deep, dark history of Gallifrey and the universe, and adopted the use-name &#39;Alchemist&#39;, cutting off all ties with his former life. His studies led him into conflict with Time Lord society, and he eventually fled off-world to continue his investigations. He died in the heart of a cloud of toxic gas, which he had released in attempting to unlock an ancient sealed tomb.<br><br><b>The Third Alchemist</b> (The Chemist)<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Alch3.png"><br><br>This incarnation completely abandoned his former interests, even amending his name slightly to become &#39;the Chemist&#39;. He was a firm believer in rigorous experimentation and logic as the only ways to solve a problem. He spent his time travelling the universe, having adventures and righting wrongs, possibly - although he never admitted it - in an effort to atone for his prior self&#39;s darker deeds. This is the version who took Lise Meitner as a Companion. He eventually died at the hands of a mob on a wildly xenophobic world.<br><br><b>The Fourth Alchemist</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Alch4.png"><br><br>This incarnation is one of the shortest-lived Time Lord incarnations on record, and the only non-&#39;human&#39; regeneration of the Alchemist. He lived for about forty-eight hours, constantly on the run, before the authorities of the same world as his prior self died on caught him and had him put down.<br><br><b>The Fifth Alchemist</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Alch5.png"><br><br>This incarnation began her (yes, her) life in mortal danger from the same mob as Alchemists III and IV had been killed by. She re-adopted the Alchemist name almost instantly, and used her twelve hour &#39;invulnerability&#39; grace period after regenerating to build herself a working matter transmuter, then created a large quantity of explosives and blasted her way free. She was the &#39;mad scientist&#39; incarnation, frequently throwing caution to the wind in favour of improvising wildly with high technology and complex (and highly explosive) chemistry. She continued the &#39;righting wrongs&#39; theme of the Third Alchemist, but rarely took long-term Companions. Ultimately she died on an alternate, Steampunk Earth while attempting to thwart an army of clockwork men.<br><br><b>The Sixth Alchemist</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Alch6.png"><br><br>This is the current incarnation, and adopted the steampunk aesthetic of his &#39;birth&#39; world. Through coincidence or design, his appearence is very similar to his third self, though his methods rely more on intuition than careful analysis. He still invents things on the fly, like his Fifth incarnation, but they tend towards chemical concoctions rather than machines and explosives.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I would actually love to do this for all our Time Lords, but the appearances might be a bit tricky... ;)<br><br>hS</p>

He passed through the Time Lord Academy, and seemed content to live out his lives as a researcher into the Matrix - until, out of the blue, he went rogue, fleeing from Gallifrey and taking the name &#39;the Librarian&#39;. He is highly skilled with most computer systems, and capable of drawing out the most tenuous details with relative ease. Ultimately, it is suspected that he will die under the influence of a powerful anasthetic, leaving his second incarnation with no memory of him (although this, obviously, cannot be confirmed).<br><br><b>The Second Librarian</b><br><br>This incarnation - or, possibly, distinct individual - shares much of the First Librarian&#39;s skills. She tends to use books rather than computers, and has an almost eidetic memory - if it&#39;s in one of her books, she can find it for you. Her skills at synthesis are not as good, but working together, the two Librarians can tell you essentially anything you want to know.<br><br>(Desdendelle - thanks!

            <p>As long as I can use the Librarian for myself as well, of course. <br><br>Now have a Second Librarian and some more biographical details, aside from the biography she&#39;s already got.<br><br><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SDJaE_ysUCQ/UjTNnEjQnbI/AAAAAAAAAHY/zNn9wXH4Fws/s400/Librarian.jpg"><br><br>(Yes, she is overly fond of cats, and yes, that is a quill she&#39;s holding - more specifically a quantum quill, her equivalent of a sonic.) <br><br>The number of books she has read have led to her gaining a superb vocabulary and a vast repertoire of mostly useless facts, making her extremely annoying to play trivia games with. She can also be dreadfully sarcastic and is easily distracted by a favorite book or interesting object. This has led to any spaces empty of books being filled with piles of knickknacks ranging from a cheap kaleidoscope to a Raxacoricofallapatorian claw. Most of her time is spent bouncing around time and space, chronicling everything she experiences in a futile attempt to finish her magnum opus, The Narrative of Existence.<br><br></p>

            <p><b>The First Archivist</b><br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v155/Neshomeh/archivist1-1.png" alt="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v155/Neshomeh/archivist1-1.png"><br><br>The First Archivist was the requisite fashion-impaired one. She was more of a collector than anything else, and would pick up anything that happened to strike her fancy—books, pretty rocks, shells, cool words (such as &quot;archivist,&quot; for instance), hats, silver spoons, etc. Her focus changed frequently, and old collections, though neatly organized, would be abandoned to gather dust on their shelves. Still, throwing anything out would be unthinkable. You never know when you might want it! She met her end in an unfortunate accident involving ten thousand spoons, when all she needed to save herself was a knife.<br><br><b>The Second Archivist</b><br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v155/Neshomeh/archivist2.png" alt="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v155/Neshomeh/archivist2.png"><br><br>The Second Archivist was completely different from the first. Controlling, strict, and impatient, she had no use for anything that didn&#39;t directly contribute to the greater whole of her designs, including people, which she regarded purely as resources for the getting of more information. She would play the social game as long as she needed to keep herself in their good graces, but once she got what she wanted, it was over; they&#39;d never hear from her again. She died friendless and with a knife in her back, when she&#39;d finally spurned and offended the wrong people.<br><br><b>The Third Archivist</b><br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v155/Neshomeh/archivist1.png" alt="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v155/Neshomeh/archivist1.png"><br><br>The Third Archivist is the current one, and by far the most balanced. She&#39;s a dotty but harmless hermit who rarely emerges from her lair, which is filled with books, papers, various digital media storage, and tea. When she does appear, it&#39;s often to exclaim over a &quot;new&quot; discovery or an &quot;exciting&quot; system of organization she&#39;s come up with. Systems are what she does best, and unlike her previous regenerations, it&#39;s the intricate order and interconnectedness of things that interests her more than the actual nodes of information in any given system (though understanding the nodes is crucial to understanding the system as a whole). She&#39;s friendly enough, but often gets her social conventions and associated stock responses mixed up.<br><br>&quot;Happy Christmas, Archivist!&quot; - &quot;Oh, yes! Gesundheit!&quot;<br><br>(Feel free to change the backstories, hS. You can probably come up with something more fitting and Whovian than I can. ^_^ )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

He prefers to make all of his plans on the fly, and he is very good at it.  He is an energetic people person and a pacifist.  He met his end when his opponent forced him to choose between his companion and himself.  He sacrificed himself and regenerated.<br><br><b>The Strategist VI - The Betrayer</b><br><br><img src="http://i60.photobucket.com/albums/h27/diceanddagger/TheStrategistVI.png" alt="The Betrayer"><br><br>Gone are the bright colors and the warmth of the Fifth Strategist.  The Time Lord, who would go on to earn the name The Betrayer, favors stark black and white clothing and masquerade masks.  Unlike his his predecessor, he carries a weapon: a single-shot pistol.  He says, &quot;If I need more than one shot, I&#39;ve done something very wrong.&quot;  One thing he has in common with his previous incarnation is that he has charm in spades.  However, what he has in charm, he lacks in empathy.  He is not afraid to use those around him as pawns in his plans.  He was, possibly, the most ingenious of the regenerations.   His death was the result of his last, great betrayal.  He betrayed himself to his death and, like so many before him, he never saw it coming.<br><br><b>The Strategist VII</b><br><br><img src="http://i60.photobucket.com/albums/h27/diceanddagger/TheStrategist.png" alt="The Strategist VII photo TheStrategist.png"><br><br>The demise of The Betrayer resulted in his regeneration into a more sober individual, who is less personable and more prone to scowling.  He shares his previous self&#39;s penchant for black clothing, though he tends to look a bit like a vaudevillian magician.  He takes the long view of events, and his plans reflect those long sighted calculations.  He still carries the stigma of The Betrayer with him, but he no longer carries a weapon.</p>

            <p>Interesting. I like the idea that the Speaker was a bit of a con artist in his first incarnation, especially in contrast to his second incarnation. I imagine his theme song would be &quot;With a Flair&quot; from Bedknobs and Broomsticks.<br><br>Later, I think I will write a story in his first incarnation, detailing some of his personal life and why the Master killed him. I mean, other then the Master was bored and the Speaker was the closest one to zap. Perhaps he tried to scam the Master and it just about worked, but when the Master caught on...<br><br>One question I have, and this is for everyone: When and why did they all come together in a team? I personally think the Speaker joined in his second incarnation, the Strategist recruiting him for some plan of his. The Speaker knew he was part of some plan, but the cause was important enough to him. What that cause was, I have no idea, I&#39;ll leave that for the others to decide.</p>

            <p>I wish I could take part in the fun here, but whenever I try and come up with a Time Lord name, it comes up as something ridiculous and not really connected with my personality at all. I tried for a while, but I knew it wasn&#39;t going to work after I just went off into tangential aspects of my personality and started trying to match them with words that were fun to say out loud.<br><br>By the way, the First Speaker is described as an &quot;illisionist&quot;.

            <p>The first and second incarnations should work fine.  I especially like the games aspect of the second one.  Your third and fourth seem to actually be my sixth and seventh, just told from a slightly different angle.  There are definitely pieces of your fourth that I would incorporate into my seventh.  In fact, I think it would read like this:<br><br>The demise of The Betrayer resulted in his regeneration into a more sober individual, who is less personable and more prone to scowling. He shares his previous self&#39;s penchant for black clothing, though he tends to look a bit like a vaudevillian magician.  He is a gifted forward planner. Given enough time and information, he is capable of coming up with a plan to accomplish any goal you care to name. He works closely with the Speaker and the two Librarians to direct the team&#39;s actions. He is still willing to sacrifice his allies at need, and will mislead and manipulate them in order to accomplish this, but his detailed plans always include ways to rescue them or otherwise repair the damage.</p>

            <p>We both went for &#39;he did more betraying in his previous incarnation, but he&#39;s a bit better now&#39;. ;) I&#39;ve taken your &#39;Seven&#39; combined description, and I&#39;m cobbling together Six and Three into one now. It&#39;s coming out longer than a lot of the others, but that&#39;s mostly because you&#39;ve described the clothes, which I don&#39;t tend to do.<br><br>&#39;Gone are the bright colors and the warmth of the Fifth Strategist. The Time Lord, the only incarnation to embrace the nickname of ‘the Betrayer’, favors stark black and white clothing and masquerade masks. Unlike his his predecessor, he carries a weapon: a single-shot pistol. He says, &quot;If I need more than one shot, I&#39;ve done something very wrong.&quot; One thing he has in common with his previous incarnation is that he has charm in spades. However, what he has in charm, he lacks in empathy. This incarnation was a ruthless schemer, and possibly the most ingenious of the regenerations. He created loose plans, but was capable of altering and updating them on the fly. His goal in every situation was utter dominance - whatever group or individual he faced, he would not rest until they were either completely powerless or dead. He was willing to sacrifice everything to his goals, including friends, allies, and the space-time continuum - and, ultimately, his own life, in his last, great betrayal.&#39;<br><br>Like I say - long, but the first half is stuff I didn&#39;t cover in my versions.<br><br>Of course, this leaves Three and Four as mysteries...<br><br>hS<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think you&#39;ve done an excellent job integrating our two interpretations of the character.  Also, I believe (and I think you agree) it is important that he not be as bad as before.  Otherwise, no one in the crew would trust him (not that they all trust him now, his past being what it is).<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>The Mechanic stuck his head out from behind a hatch and pushed his goggles up onto his forehead. &quot;All fixed,&quot; he said. &quot;Well, moderately fixed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re making me twitchy,&quot; the Librarian muttered, not glancing up from his tablet computer. &quot;Would it hurt you to at least look at the manual?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I had to construct a whole new temporal transfer junction and bypass the entire neutron flow system to get her working again,&quot; the Mechanic pointed out. &quot;I&#39;m <i>writing</i> the manual. This isn&#39;t a repair job – by the time I&#39;m through, this TARDIS will be a whole new ship.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And where&#39;s the fun in reading the manual, anyway?&quot; the Artisan piped up, scrambling down a ladder from the upper gallery. &quot;Running a TARDIS is an <i>art</i>, not some complicated science! You have to feel your way through it. If you don&#39;t love your TARDIS, you-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, spare me.&quot; The Alchemist walked into the console room, white coat billowing behind him. &quot;All this &#39;art and science are totally separate&#39; business - the trick is to <i>synthesise</i> them. Logic and emotion aren&#39;t antithetical, no matter what Doctor Spock says.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s <i>Mister</i> Spock,&quot; the Librarian corrected, &quot;or if you want to get technical, Science Officer Spock. At least until he became Ambassador Spock, and-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, yes.&quot; The Alchemist tapped a button on the console and peered at the screen. &quot;The stabilisers are still reading as down...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Really? Let me see.&quot; The Mechanic frowned at the data printout, then pulled a large rubber mallet from his toolbelt and tapped the screen sharply. &quot;That should do it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Great!&quot; exclaimed the Bluejay from where she perched on the railing. &quot;So are we ready to go?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not until the Betrayer gets here,&quot; the Librarian informed her.<br><br>&quot;You really shouldn&#39;t call him that,&quot; the Speaker chided him, standing up at last from his position by the main doors. &quot;It&#39;s exceptionally rude to refuse to use the name someone has chosen in favour of an insulting epithet.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, not more preaching!&quot; the Bluejay protested. &quot;I thought you got over this when you regenerated!&quot;<br><br>&quot;This is important,&quot; the Speaker told her. &quot;I know what it&#39;s like to be forcibly given a nickname-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, they&#39;re accurate,&quot; the Artisan put in. &quot;You like to give presentations, he betrays people all the time…&quot; She trailed off in the face of the Speaker&#39;s glare.<br><br>&quot;I ask you,&quot; the Speaker said, looking around the console room, &quot;each of you - how would you feel if no-one would use your chosen name? If people kept calling you &#39;the Flighty&#39;,&quot; he nodded at the Bluejay, &quot;or &#39;the Oil-stained&#39;,&quot; to the Mechanic, &quot;or &#39;the Explosive&#39;,&quot; to the Alchemist.<br><br>&quot;Well, speaking for myself, I wouldn&#39;t mind-&quot; the Alchemist began. Then one of the doors swung open, and the Strategist strode in. He was, as usual, dressed all in black, and already scowling.<br><br>&quot;Well?&quot; he asked in the sudden silence. &quot;What are we waiting for?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A TARDIS requires a crew of six,&quot; the Librarian pointed out. &quot;You were absent.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was planning,&quot; the Strategist corrected, &quot;and you already have six crew members here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, I&#39;m just along for the ride,&quot; the Bluejay called chirpily. &quot;Don&#39;t mind me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hm.&quot; The Strategist crossed to the console and took his place in front of one of the six segments, standing next to the Alchemist and the Mechanic. &quot;But I am here <i>now</i>,&quot; he pointed out. &quot;So, I ask again - what are we waiting for?&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br><i>And later on…</i><br><br>The Librarian walked the corridors of the TARDIS, scowling at his computer, trying yet again to pin down the solution to the Riddle of the Osirians. So absorbed was he that he failed to notice the <i>other</i> person in the corridor until he walked into her. Books went flying everywhere, and the Time Lord was barely able to catch himself in time.<br><br>&quot;My books!&quot; exclaimed the women he had run into, scrambling to collect them all. She straightened up and glared at the Librarian. &quot;Why don&#39;t you look where you&#39;re going?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why don&#39;t <i>you</i>?&quot; the Librarian retorted. &quot;I&#39;m hardly the only one who can be held responsible here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, but you had the most choice,&quot; the woman said, flicking a hand at his computer (and nearly losing her stack of books again). &quot;I can barely see round this lot at all – you just had to stop working for half a minute until you got where you were headed!&quot;<br><br>&quot;… fair enough,&quot; the Librarian agreed. &quot;I apologise. The Librarian, by the way.&quot;<br><br>The woman looked puzzled. &quot;Yes? What of it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s me,&quot; the Librarian clarified.<br><br>The woman snorted. &quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous,&quot; she said. &quot;<i>I&#39;m</i> the Librarian. Now who are you really?&quot;<br><br>&quot;But <i>I&#39;m</i> the Librarian,&quot; the (male) Librarian protested. &quot;You can&#39;t steal my name!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m stealing <i>your</i> name?&quot; the (female) Librarian exclaimed. &quot;More like the other way round! Look at you – you&#39;re still on your first body!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Due to careful preservation of myself against danger, yes,&quot; the male said. Then he frowned, as a horrible thought began to dawn on him. &quot;You don&#39;t think…?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No.&quot; The female shook her head. &quot;No, that&#39;s ridiculous. Unthinkable.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Absurd,&quot; the male supplied. &quot;Inconceivable.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nonsensical,&quot; the female agreed. &quot;To think that I could regenerate from-&quot;<br><br>&quot;That I could regenerate into-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Someone like <i>you</i>!&quot; they finished together.<br><br>The male glared at the female, who returned the expression with equal distaste. &quot;But no,&quot; he said at last. &quot;Surely you&#39;d remember if you&#39;d ever been… well, me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Surely,&quot; she replied, but looked uncertain. &quot;Except… well, there was a bit of trouble with my regeneration, actually. I was dead for a bit too long, and my memories… aren&#39;t what they used to be.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s awful!&quot; the male Librarian exclaimed. &quot;Losing your <i>memories</i> - that&#39;s like… like…&quot;<br><br>&quot;Like the burning of the Library of Alexandria,&quot; the female supplied. &quot;I know. I&#39;ve been <i>trying</i> to get them back, but nothing seems to work.&quot;<br><br>The First Librarian frowned and peered at his tablet. &quot;You know,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;I&#39;ve been working on this riddle… the Riddle of the Osirians. And it seems to have something to do with memory…&quot;<br><br>The Second Librarian&#39;s eyebrows rose. &quot;The Osirians?&quot; she repeated. &quot;I have a book on them here somewhere – maybe it will help. Is there a table nearby…?&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Two notes:<br><br>-I&#39;m not making a statement that the two Librarians <i>are</i> the same person - but I&#39;m also not ruling it out. These characters are presumably not the same as any hypothetical PPC agents by the same names.<br><br>-I hope I&#39;ve got everyone&#39;s gender right! This applies across both stories, naturally.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You managed to give all the characters a decent amount of screentime, and I think you did a really good job of characterising them.

            <p>As for the accuracy, yeah, I am often the diplomat amongst my friends. While the Speaker seems to be a little more...how do I put this...professional (?) then I am usually, I could definitely see myself saying something along those lines. I say that because it seems like he is constantly in the middle of a speech whenever he opens his mouth. Nice for characterization, but not my own personality, per-se. However, hanging in the shadows by the door, rather then standing with the group, is definitely something I have/would do.<br><br>You know, I kinda want to see more from these guys. It seems like an interesting group, and following their adventures through the universe would be cool. I&#39;m not sure if I would write the next installment, but it would be nice. Perhaps the people who these Time Lords are based off of could be the beta readers for their next story, and insert little personality quirks that the other authors would not know about? Just a thought.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a couple of reasons the Speaker might not match you exactly in this scene:<br><br>-This could be one of his hangups. Perhaps people occasionally call him &#39;the Presenter&#39;, which he thinks sounds like some sort of tawdry entertainer, not an accomplished giver-of-presentations like him. So he&#39;s not <i>always</i> ready with a speech - just in this instance.<br><br>-Alternately, it could be a feature of this particular regeneration. Perhaps this version is rather preachy, while the previous iteration simply liked to lay things out in a clear spoken format before making a plan.<br><br>Actually, I think that version of the Speaker would get on well with the Strategist, since they both centre around careful planning. Maybe this version should regenerate soon...<br><br><hr>
<br><br>The problem with getting the people they&#39;re based on to beta is that, well, there&#39;s seven - no, eight, if we include Impossible - people involved so far, and could be more coming. I&#39;ve always been exceptionally lucky with betas, but that&#39;s pushing it a bit far.<br><br>On the other hand... I&#39;m quite capable of rewriting based on comments here for now. Actually, I&#39;ve just figured a way to tweak the Speaker to fit your comments... updated version coming soon.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You were pretty accurate. I&#39;m not always &quot;by the book&quot; so to speak. This is somewhat with my crocheting. I read the pattern to get an idea of the shape and then I do whatever I like. The results are usually nice, though there are some times where the end product looks terrible.<br><br>I like the way how you wrote the Artisan. The little &quot;Art&quot; verses &quot;Science&quot; spat was a lovely touch. I might try to write a short sketch. Good job.</p>

            <p>Since I&#39;ve been plotting my Permission request, I&#39;ve been thinking about a pair of Time Lord agents, and one of them was going to be named (yes, you guessed it) the Librarian. <br><br>On the same note, I wonder what the protocol is around Time Lord names - is it possible for two of them to have the same title?</p>

            <p>I like the balance that the characters have here.  There are natural alliances and rivalries between the various characters, which you&#39;ve used very well.  The Art vs Science alignments being the most clearly identifiable.<br><br>In the modified DnD Alignment system that I use (just replace &#39;Good vs Evil&#39; with &#39;Selfless vs Selfish&#39; and you&#39;re there), I see the characters breaking down like this:<br><br>Lawful Selfless: The Speaker<br>Lawful Neutral: The Librarian<br>Lawful Selfish: N/A<br>Neutral Selfless: The Bluejay<br>True Neutral: The Alchemist<br>Neutral Selfish: The Strategist<br>Chaotic Selfless: The Mechanic<br>Chaotic Neutral: The Artisan<br>Chaotic Selfish: N/A<br><br>So, the group skews toward the Selfless, overall, and is fairly balanced on the &#39;Law vs Chaos&#39; scale.  Not a bad group, in my opinion.  Plenty of room for differing points of view, and interpersonal conflict.  There is also room for both a Lawful Selfish villain as well as a Chaotic Selfish one.<br><br>-Phobos, over-analyzing things since 1986</p>

            <p>I kind of like the idea of a Time Lord who chooses to go by &#39;The Betrayer&#39;. Of course, the way to make that into a good story is for him to be a <i>good guy</i>. Yes, the Betrayer will make promises he has no intention of keeping, sell out people who think they&#39;re his friends, and invite alien species down onto helpless planets - but his lies are to manipulate people into doing what needs doing, he abandons his friends to protect them (even if that means they get captured - a prison cell is a pretty safe place!), and the aliens would have come anyway - this way, he can control the situation.<br><br>hS</p>
