            <p>Okay, I&#39;ve been using Twitter a lot (as @kittyeden1) and I thought of an idea.<br>Instead of flooding the Board with badfic reports, we could tweet them, and tag them specifically with a special tag. I&#39;m thinking #ppcalert .<br></p>

            <p>not everyone checks the Unclaimed Badfic page to see if new fics have been posted there. Also posting them here gives everyone a chance to see how bad the badfics really are (and in some cases, whether those &#39;fics actually qualify as badfics in the first place).</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t Tweet either, but Twitter could be used as a supplement to the Board and Unclaimed Badfic lists. That way the Board isn&#39;t quite so swamped with reports. Those who use Twitter can moderate the reports made through Twitter and those who prefer the Board can focus on those made on the Board.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a tool that can track when a tag is used. So if we used #PPCalert, a tweet might go like:<br><br><i>#PPCalert trollfic in Harry Potter, Becoming Female by venusgod</i> <br>And then include a link. <br><br>If we use a website called Twubs, <a href="http://www.twubs.com/PPCalert/">www.twubs.com/PPCalert/</a> will always have a list of badfics that we can then discuss via Private Tweets. <br><a href="http://www.twubs.com/PPCalert/embed/">www.twubs.com/PPCalert/embed/</a> can also embed the feed into a webpage, so we can put it on the Wiki and/or personal blog.</p>

            <p>Thanks to everyone who answered and helped me out, because of what was told to me I changed my Nuzlocke idea a little. <br>I’ll admit that as of now they are not THAT different but I think I changed them enough that I think that it can now work with in the PPC.  Even with these changes it still can’t work then I guess I’ll have to scrap the whole idea, fully this time, and just stick with having my poke girl have a pokemon training back story.<br>Changes:<br>1. I’m changing the Homestuck male, non-gt (god tier) cherub to a Homestuck male, gt human.<br><br>Reasons: well really it has to do with the fact that the PPC doesn’t hand out portal consoles like candy, so how would one fix this problem in the Nuzlocke I’m planning?  <br><br>Simple, after looking at some god tier descriptions and powers (and my own head-canons on how some would work) I got the idea to turn my cherub character into a human (the reason for that being, since the scope of this project is already as big as it is I decided that I should just stick to human characters).  <br><br>The boy in question is named Dean, and he is a Rogue of Space which means he is ‘one who steals from space for the benefit of his teammates’ so he steals velocity, density, and mass from objects as well as space itself.  <br><br>So I thought that the stealing from space part could work like this: while thinking of a place, he takes his hands and forms a green dot in the air; he then puts his hand into the dot and starts forming a portal with the image in his head on the other side (basically ‘stealing’ the space between the two spaces for his teammates).<br><br>Upsides: Don’t need portal consoles that often. (See downsides for why it’s “that often”)<br>     The portal will only close after he fully exits. (See downsides for another possible way) <br>      As long as he remembers/knows what the place looks like, he can portal there.<br><br>Downsides: The portal stays stable as long as he is concentrating on the portal, if his attention is diverted for at least minute the portal will instantly close.<br>          He needs to know what the location he is opening a portal too looks like first. (A decent description can work too; as long as he knows what continuum he is opening a portal too)<br>          Unlike the console portals, his can be easily noticed by others. (if there are other people on the other side of the portal they can see it and see the people coming out of it)<br><br>I’m not going to talk about my ideas anymore, until after I talk to my sis about everything that everyone has told me and after we talk I’ll post what we have decided to do.<br>Sorry if I look like I’m beating a dead horse but I really, really wanted to do this idea so I just wait to try and do everything I can to make this idea a reality and so I really don’t to give up early on it. :)<br></p>

            <p>Well, having looked at the homestuck wiki and having a bit more of an idea about than before. I&#39;m not sure about your first point. Mainly because as stated before you&#39;ve got to make sure that your Agents aren&#39;t too OP, or have too many Sueish traits, something that God Tier screams out to me as being. I&#39;m not really sure about you&#39;re choice of power either, it seems that it could be overused and overpowered. I can see it being used in the way you want it to be, however I&#39;m worried that it could be abused and that you&#39;re not looking at the whole picture. Yes it solves the problems of portaling between continuums but it does nothing for helping the PPC communicate with your agents in any way. I mean the only way that they could get missions would be for at least one of them to stay in the RC, which seems to negate your whole effort to keep them in their own worlds. <br><br>I hope that helps in some way<br><br>Storme Hawk<br>P.S if you want I&#39;m available if you want someone different to throw ideas at, my email I check most often is <a href="mailto:thestormehawk@gmail.com">thestormehawk@gmail.com</a><br></p>

            <p>We have new badfic threads all the time, and while it usually starts with one or two people posting individual atrocities, it often compounds into plenty of new badfics being introduced and at least one person claiming one or more of said badfics for a mission that may never actually be finished.

            <p>One of the primary things that bothered me about this mission is that it felt like you were overly focused on your own message. There&#39;s nothing wrong with using a story to convey a moral or lesson, but the way it was done here felt very obvious: &quot;A group of agents, one of them openly gay, is assigned a homophobic trainee right before they undertake a mission involving homophobia as a major plot point.&quot; It&#39;s a scenario that, at least to me, seems artificial. It took me out of the story in a way I don&#39;t like.<br><br>There was very little action taken by your agents throughout most of the story beyond dialogue. As doctorlit mentioned, a lot of what they did was just comment on fic quotes. This read like a fleshed-out MST in places, which is not what I want out of missions.<br><br>The presence of Wave Crest felt entirely unnecessary. He added nothing to the story apart from a few less-than-stellar jokes and a few bits where he yelled at de Chagny. What&#39;s more, I didn&#39;t really like him. What little I saw of his character I found to be unpleasant and grating.<br><br>I was also not a fan of the ending. Logically speaking, there&#39;s no way those final confrontations should have gone as they did. The agents identified the types of Sue-specters very specifically earlier on in the mission. This suggested to me that they knew what they were getting into, that they would be prepared to counter whatever tactics the specters would try. And yet, all four agents were mesmerized in very short order. It felt like a cheat intended to force a final confrontation between de Chagny and Eusabius.<br><br>There were some parts I liked, to be certain. I&#39;m very glad that you didn&#39;t take the easy way out with de Chagny&#39;s beliefs and have him completely abandon his preconceptions at the end. As doctorlit said, it&#39;s (sadly) realistic.<br><br>Finally, let me apologize if any of my comments seemed overly confrontational or harsh. My intention was not to insult or attack. I am just trying to relay my thoughts on your piece as best as I can.</p>

            <p>The big, major victory you&#39;ve pulled off here is using Myrin to show the proper way to portray a homophobic character getting his bigotry shoved back in his face.  It&#39;s reasonable for him to start out that way, being that he&#39;s kinda sorta from <i>Phantom of the Opera</i>&#39;s time period.  Then you use Eusabius as the counter-example against what Myrin believes about homosexual people, while possessed!replacement!Ike (sheesh) serves as a bit of a dark mirror for Myrin to see and dangerously far homophobia can be taken.  Also (sadly) realistic is that Myrin doesn&#39;t have a complete change of heart by the end, but still recognizes that he was being hurtful and rude, and that he had been wrong about <i>some</i> things, at the least.<br><br>The pacing did get slowed down significantly in this mission, and I think it&#39;s mainly because both Eusabius and Myrin have similar meticulous, conjunction-lacking speech patterns.  I realize <i>why</i> they both speak that way, but trying to read their dialogue in a realistic way makes some of the conversations stretch on forever, which gets especially annoying when they&#39;re doing little more than commenting on a fic quote you&#39;ve already shown us.<br><br>I like the situations with the three different wraiths at the end.  Each one had a distinct and recognizable attitude and effect on the PPCers, which makes them stand out immensely from the rest of the mission.  I imagine the one that had been possessing Ike is another unique type that&#39;s likely to show up again in other PPC spin-offs.<br><br>The way Wave Crest makes such ribald jokes is a little off-putting, considering the continuum he&#39;s from.  I know you set up his reading about human sexuality in &quot;Vals Azul,&quot; but as he talks now, he really feels more like a human character who happens to be a pony, rather than an actual <i>My Little Pony</i> character.  Specifically, he sounds so similar to Florestan half the time, that Wave Crest almost doesn&#39;t feel like he&#39;s there at all.<br><br>Finally, this exchange confuses me:<br><br><i>“It seems that way,” Wave Crest replied. He then looked up to the other two agents. “So this is what I’ve got to look forward to?”<br><br>“Not quite,” said Eusabius. “Missions rarely ever become so trying on a person’s soul. And most of our missions have been rather innocuous.”<br><br>“So I noticed,” Wave Crest replied. He then looked up. “I have to say, it’s interesting work. I’m glad they saw me fit to be an agent.”</i><br><br>What has Wave Crest noticed?  He&#39;s only been on one mission (a horrible one), so how has he noticed that &quot;most missions&quot; have been &quot;innocuous&quot; for this RC?</p>

            <p>Glad to see that my handling of Myrin was good. Honestly, writing a character with that kind of deliberate values dissonance was one of the hardest things I&#39;ve ever written for the PPC, and I broke my back trying to get that right. I&#39;m glad you found that part to be good, so even if everything else was all &quot;blah&quot; I&#39;m glad to have gotten that right.<br><br>The wraith that possessed Ike was originally going to be a unique type, as a matter of fact. But when we have slash dwimmerlaiks in the PPC already, I figured &quot;eh, this might be too much&quot;. But... If it appears in any more fics I find, I might go ahead and introduce it then. (And if you&#39;re wondering? It was originally going to be called &quot;Potentia Libidinis&quot;.)<br><br>I&#39;ll admit that I was less concerned about Wave Crest&#39;s voice and speech mannerisms in this mission: I was so focused on the dynamic between Eusabius and Myrin that, now that you mention it, I think Wave Crest&#39;s voice probably suffered as a result. Thank you for pointing that out; I&#39;ll be sure to work on that in future missions with him.<br><br>Huh... I think that might&#39;ve been a dialogue oversight. I&#39;ll go ahead and fix that line. Thanks for pointing that out!<br><br>So thanks for the feedback!</p>

            <p>I thought the Potentia Libidinis seemed distinctly separate from the slash demons/dwimmerlaiks when I was beta-reading, since the latter usually seem more like manifestations of random OOC activity like most of the other wraith subspecies, and the Potentia Libidinis&#39;s behavior once it was exorcised showed some amount of self-awareness, making it more like the other high-level entities, particularly the conflictus creatrix, than just some random-encounter wraith. The slash demons/dwimmerlaiks usually tend to react in an almost animalistic fashion, screeching complaints and/or trying to possess whatever is nearby in instinctive self-preservation, but this one seemed to have a predetermined plan and modus operandi, as well as unusual abilities that seemed akin to the Impetus Miserabilis&#39;s emotion-manipulating that even further supported its standing as a being in the aforementioned&#39;s family, or at least its caliber.<br><br>Oh, well. (sigh) If you decide it&#39;s not worth it to introduce a new species and this was just some uniquely capable slash demon instead of a high-level wraith, authorial intent trumps.</p>

            <p>but I couldn’t stop reading, although I don’t even know the various canons.

Since Myrin seems to be talking to Eusabius alone, he should use the singular <i>mon ami</i>, but I don’t expect Myrin to assume that Eusabius may have more than one &quot;significant other&quot;, so this may be Myrin asking about Eusabius and Wave Crest’s &quot;significant others&quot;, and referring to both of them as <i>mon amis</i>?<br><br><i>The <b>disguised wolf</b> glanced to the side, suddenly feeling a strange rush of emotion.

Perhaps the first sentence should just be dropped, and then one of the <i>replacement</i> could be replaced by <i>&quot;Ike&quot;</i>?<br><br>That&#39;s all I noticed.<br><br>The author of the badfic may not have been malicious, but well meant is often the opposite of what your mission is – well done.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Commenting as I read through. Looking good so far, but how exactly do Elites smile? There aren&#39;t many canonical sources that depict them in situations where they would, but IIRC the analogous facial expression involves all four mandibles pulling down and backwards.</p>

            <p><i>On a silent pool<br>The pond-skater pounces;<br>Jaws close on nothing</i><br><br>My name is Wobbles The Clown, or very occasionally CCC, colourcodedchaos, and other things. I have an idea for an agent who might be interesting to read about, though it does involve me actually getting permission, and I also have memories of the Fic That Shall Not Be Named (LOTR edition). I wasn&#39;t even particularly squicked, which is probably not a sign of a healthy mind; rather, I was just bored. Same with Forbiden Fruit, though there my sole memory is wondering why the author wanted to make sure that her fruit were received by the Vice-President of the United States. Oh, and the gay panda getting high in an enormous tree (a beech, to be precise).<br><br>I think in haiku a lot; I find it relaxing to pare my thoughts down into a very spartan style, and it makes me think about words and the connections between them. However, it also means that sometimes I converse in haiku without thinking. I apologise in advance if this annoys anyone.<br><br><i>Clowns need other clowns<br>To remind them of the times<br>When nobody laughs</i></p>

The legendary blade of Charlemagne, lord of all the Franks across Europe and founder of the Holy Roman Empire, was named the Sword Of Smiles, Joyeuse in their tongue. It ties into the concept of <i>katsujinken</i>, the life-giving sword, which is itself a part of the Japanese view of weaponry as an extension of the self.

            <p>...in Japanese, most words actually do have quite a lot of syllables in them, so the 5/7/5 rule for syllables in English really doesn&#39;t do much justice to the form (and it further doesn&#39;t allow for especially good English translations of traditional Japanese haiku). Generally, haiku is supposed to punctuate a feeling or a sensation in just a few words, and following the 5/7/5 rule in English can lead to incredibly clunky examples that say too much. So when writing haiku in English, most professional poets I&#39;ve known personally actually tend to play fast and loose with the 5/7/5 rule in the name of preserving the aphoristic quality.<br><br>If you really want to go overboard, that&#39;s what haibun is for. But for haiku, you want to go more for &quot;saying a lot by saying little&quot;.<br><br>Now that the side of me that was somewhat active in the Boston poetry scene has satisfied itself, I&#39;ll move on to the actual introduction...<br><br>Hi there!

            <p>I was aware of that; you&#39;ll note that the one at the start of my OP doesn&#39;t quite conform to the metre, and I&#39;m also aware that <i>kireji</i> are necessary for it to work as-intended. It&#39;s just that I&#39;m no good at writing haiku poetry, and mainly use it to streamline my thought processes. It&#39;s the very rigidity of the metre that makes it so well-suited to that purpose.<br><br>Anywho, thank you for the music. It&#39;s very beautiful, though I confess to preferring the self-important bombast of military marches; they appeal to my sense of the absurd, and they make me laugh.

            <p>I would recommend to you and anyone else out here to download play these two freeware gems, if you haven&#39;t already!<br><br>The first is Star Control II: the Ur-Quan Masters, which is available here (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sc2/files/UQM/0.7/uqm-0.7.0-1-installer.exe/download?use_mirror=ufpr&amp;download"><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sc2/files/UQM/0.7/uqm-0.7.0-1-installer.exe/download?use_mirror=ufpr&amp;download">http://sourceforge.net/projects/sc2/files/UQM/0.7/uqm-0.7.0-1-installer.exe/download?use_mirror=ufpr&amp;amp;download</a></a>=). Imagine if Mass Effect was made in 1992 and was about ship-to-ship fighting instead of on-foot combat, and that&#39;s this game in a nutshell. It is probably one of the very first games with proper dialogue trees, being much older than Fallout, yet providing you with similar freedom and some rather clever writing as well. The combat and RPG parts have aged somewhat (though the planet-scanning still beats either Mass Effect once you level up the lander), but it&#39;s still addictive and fun.<br><br>The other game is Iji, which can be gotten from its creator&#39;s website (<a href="http://www.remar.se/daniel/"><a href="http://www.remar.se/daniel/">http://www.remar.se/daniel/</a></a>). It is a freeware Metroidvania with surprisingly complex plot, no fourth wall (diaries left behind by aliens outright say which buttons are to be pressed to activate abilities, for instance), hacking minigames, weapon crafting (not to DS3 levels, of course, but still), ridiculously epic last and second-to-last boss fights (others aren&#39;t bad either) and the choice to walk through the game without killing anyone, which is reflected in the dialogue throughout the game. It&#39;s not without flaws (basic enemy AI could with improvements), but on the whole, I would say it&#39;s great.</p>

            <p>TBoI shares a layout with early Zelda dungeoneering, and very little else. As far as I know, the first Zelda game did not discuss at length (almost solely through the mechanics and items within the game) the dangers of becoming trapped in your own head. Indeed, in that respect it forms a trilogy with two of Edmund McMillen&#39;s other games, Time Fcuk and Aether.<br><br>Aether shows what happens when you leave the &quot;real&quot; world for a world of your own making, becoming so tied up in it that friends and family hold no meaning any more and your escape has become your prison. Time Fcuk shows that this prison can be escaped only through self-discovery and what Maslow called self-actualisation. The Binding of Isaac, on the other hand, shows why it is necessary to escape the prison and demonstrates the detrimental effects such a jail has on young people in particular.<br><br>Now, I&#39;d link you to an article discussing this in more detail, but it&#39;s probably just too dull for Christmas reading. Besides, I&#39;d have to actually find it, which&#39;d be more trouble than it&#39;d likely be worth. =]</p>

            <p>Can&#39;t give you the link now, but type &quot;twinfinite isaac&quot; in Google and it should be the first result you get. If you check out the comments, you can find a rather long, fan-wankey comment I wrote a while ago with my perspective. That said, Edmund himself prefers to say that while the Twinfinite theory explains the underlying symbolism, it&#39;s up to each player to decide what EXACTLY happens to the characters at the end. Plus, The Rebirth is going to add even more endings, so...<br><br>All in all, glad to see another Binding of Isaac fan here! I don&#39;t usually tend to say this, but few balancing niggles aside, this game is near-perfection, and can&#39;t wait as to what Rebirth has in store! </p>

            <p>I knew he had Formspring and followed him on there for a while before he quit his account :( . From there, I learned that Edmund plans to have about 100 new items, 100 new enemies and 20 bosses, as well as several new characters crammed into Rebirth! Some effects are going to be pretty unprecedented: he revealed an item that makes your tears orbit Isaac much like blue flies, for instance. Wonder if that&#39;ll stack with Ipecac...<br><br>Oh, and yes, that&#39;s me, breaking records for fanwank since 2013! Honestly, though, I find it quite astonishing that someone could create a roguelike with this much gameplay and story integration: literally every item/mechanic can be traced back to his real-world childhood or his current condition in the basement. I&#39;m a bit at loss about the bombs in the game, though: why exactly would he imagine this fairly specific item that&#39;s unlikely to have been in his house, unlike more everyday keys and coins? You could say that&#39;s because he played Zelda in his childhood of course, but I hope you have a more satisfying explanation! </p>

            <p>The way I see it is that bombs are found in video games, and we know that Isaac plays them; the Game Kid is the primary reference, but SMB Super Fan, Dr. Fetus, and the various Gishes knocking around (both as items and enemies) are also proof too. The clincher&#39;s the arcade, one of the few rooms in the game that will not deliberately hurt you; Isaac might think that getting an enemy in a treasure room isn&#39;t fair, but he definitely sees arcades as safe space.<br><br>See, it&#39;s my belief that Isaac had a fairly normal childhood up until the death of his sister (ending 12); after which, Isaac blamed himself for everything bad that happened. His father was utterly unable to cope and left the household, while his mother slowly got angrier and angrier with him. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s trying to kill him (although if you read Dave Pelzer&#39;s autobiographies, his mother does stab him with a kitchen knife; I can&#39;t help but wonder if that&#39;s where McMillen got the idea from); I think she&#39;s becoming stricter with him out of her own grief, which also made her turn to God as a source of comfort and salvation. The opening cutscene is more important than people think it is; we must remember to view them through the eyes of a child, who believes he is being punished unfairly for being grounded and having the odd toy confiscated.<br><br>Think about the order of the levels and what they represent. Isaac starts low and goes lower until the end of the Depths/Necropolis, wherein he fights his perception of his mother as an unknowable titan aiming to crush him. Then come the Womb/Utero levels; in these, Isaac is trying to analyse his own feelings of guilt, confronting his mother&#39;s own feelings on the matter in his head over and over again until he realises that they all stem from maternal feelings of protection and the fact that she thinks she failed her daughter, as shown by the transformation of Mom&#39;s Heart into It Lives. After that, the child has a choice; go down, or go up? Fall or rise? Sheol&#39;s levels are hard because Isaac is wallowing in his own perceived damnation, and the fight with Satan shows that nothing has changed - the similarities with the Mom fight are pronounced for precisely this reason. The music in the levels is muted and downbeat, demonstrating the depths of Isaac&#39;s misery, misery he feels is deserved. When he overcomes Satan, the ending demonstrates that nothing has changed for him; he is still in the box described by the Twinfinite article, resigned to his fate as a bad child.<br><br>However, should he choose to rise into the Cathedral, the rooms are hard for a different reason; Isaac, rather than accepting his fate, is trying to change it. The music is similar to Sheol, but more hopeful; angelic rather than demonic. He is trying to change his mind and get rid of the toxic beliefs he held. This is also why the rooms here are harder than the ones in Sheol; it&#39;s much more difficult to change your mind than it is to stay set in your beliefs. It&#39;s also felt in the change in final boss battle; the fight with Isaac is almost a bullet-hell boss, and there are no other boss battles like it earlier in the game. This is Isaac trying to change how he sees himself; and for Isaac, it&#39;s almost the hardest thing he can do.<br><br>If you have the Polaroid, however, the metaphor becomes slightly altered. Isaac can now go through the Chest upon breaking his self-image and rebuilding it into something stronger, represented by the four golden chests in the starting room. As long as he has the means to do so, Isaac is able to make himself stronger, and though the rooms are the hardest in the game by far (because Isaac is confronting  more and more uncomfortable truths about himself), there is more reward at the end of it. Finally, with the boss ???, he confronts the root of his problems; the corpse of a child, blue with rot. ??? represents his grief, from which stemmed the majority of his self-esteem and self-image issues portrayed by the fight with Isaac; the character model curled on the floor in the centre of the room is ??? rather than Isaac, the boss&#39;s first stage also produces flies, the symbolism is obvious. However, like the fight with Isaac, the body rises in a Jacob&#39;s Ladder, slowly but surely ascending to Heaven and granting Isaac salvation in the process. He believes God has forgiven him, and in believing so, forgives himself. It&#39;s about as triumphal as a game like this can get. All of this is explained by the final ending, which you only get by defeating the boss.<br><br>This, I believe, is why items change your image throughout the game. I think that TBoI is a game about the perception of the self, and the effects of the various passive items on Isaac&#39;s body are a discussion on how external stimuli affect the self-image of a vulnerable child. The more you progress through the game, the more you pick up, the more you change, the more you can grow. This is how I think it ties into the &quot;box&quot; theme touched on in the Twinfinite article; Aether showed what happens when you don&#39;t get out of the box, Time Fcuk showed you can get out of the box, and The Binding of Isaac says that it&#39;s difficult to do so but the most rewarding thing you can do.<br><br>By the end of the Chest, Isaac has achieved self-actualisation. He has overcome his fears, his doubts, his guilt, and his shame. He is at peace with himself and with his God. He has earned his happy ending, and through understanding how it is a happy ending, we are exhorted by the game to get that ending for ourselves, no matter how hard it might be. KBO, says Edmund McMillen. KBO.<br><br>Of course, Rebirth could throw this all out of the window in an instant, in which case I&#39;ll look ever-so-slightly ridiculous. =D</p>

            <p>If I may set out my responses in the order you gave (I&#39;m sorry if I sound brusque):-<br><br>1) Funnily enough, it was after I read C*l*b*i*n and was... bored by it. I started getting more into fanfic-snarking and stumbled upon this place by way of the Twilight Sucks forum.<br><br>2) Yes and yes.<br><br>3) It&#39;s a tricky one, this. I don&#39;t really go in for fandoms; if a story is non-canonical in some way, I will research the original text until I find out why. That said, while all books are equal, some are more equal than others; I grew up devouring the Harry Potter series and the Discworld, and there are some things I can&#39;t get on with, like Twilight or anything written by Victor Hugo. <i>Hugo, hélas</i> indeed...<br><br>4) I&#39;m sick to the back teeth of the only clowns in modern fiction being ironic in some way - and I&#39;m especially tired of Pennywise and The Joker being held up as exemplars of clownkind. Thus, I began to develop the character of Wobbles: an entertainer of Candide-like optimism (in a job not even Voltaire&#39;d inflict upon Candide...) who just wants people to be as happy as she is. She&#39;s not been to many possible worlds yet, but her life seems to inhabit the best one.<br><br>Also, just FYI: I identify as female, ta. There aren&#39;t that many female clowns. I wonder why that is...<br><br>Anyway, thank you for making me feel welcome and I shall befriend the Meditite forthwith. Expect to see both of us riding off into the sunset together, possibly on tiny unicycles. Don&#39;t worry about me leaving in a huff, either.<br><br><i>A clown does not shirk<br>From an opportunity<br>To make someone smile.</i><br><br>=D</p>

            <p>But it&#39;d definitely be worthwhile. Having read about the first 10 chapters of the fic (or tried to; the SPaG renders it incomprehensible at times), I think I can see what the author&#39;s trying to do, and while what I know about the minutiae of the Star Wars canon could be written on the back of a postage stamp in big letters, I think it&#39;s salvageable. It&#39;d take a lot of effort, sure, and the end product might be unrecognisable, but to my mind that just makes it all the more worth doing. Like I said, I&#39;m going down the Pangloss &amp; Candide route to optimism, so everything&#39;ll turn out okay somehow. =]</p>

            <p>Just the first episode makes the &#39;fic look like its author used a charge-list as a check-list. The Sue is half fire elemental. The first paragraph of the story is a description of the Sue. Her parents were murdered by Voldie. She&#39;s the last of her (half-)kind. She&#39;s a canon&#39;s uncanonical relative. There are in-text author&#39;s notes in parentheses. There are SPaG errors and minis. That&#39;s just... hilarious. I hope the author will respond well to the review I left them.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a bit moot, as the troll&#39;s not been writing for a while now. However, there has to be a point to trolling in order for it to be of any value, and these fics are utterly pointless. There is no reason for them to exist, their existence benefits nobody, and therefore I reckon they&#39;re fair game for us.</p>

            <p>Enthusiasm is good, but excess is bad, and quite frankly I and some other people (Sergio Turbo, for example) think that you&#39;ve bitten more than you can chew. Other words, you&#39;ve claimed way too many &#39;fics.<br>Look at me for an example. I&#39;ve been hanging around the PPC for a little more than two years. It took me a year to get Permission. In the following year, I wrote two interludes and four missions, two of which were co-writes. I have three &#39;fics claimed (two together with Firemagic) - of which one&#39;s mission is WiP, one&#39;s was scrapped (I should probably remove my claim for that one) and one&#39;s didn&#39;t quite even leave the drawing board yet. Aside from that WiP, I am also writing something for hS&#39;s <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=247741;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Ispace Wars</a>.<br>Even if you have the time, writing missions requires real effort, so be careful, OK?</p>

            <pre><code>Basically we (we being me and my sister) have decided that the characters (Linda-fifteen/nineteen, Dean-fifteen/nineteen, and Maya-fourteen/eighteen) are just normal Pokémon trainers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   They lived in the Pokémon continuum and went through three regions (Johto, Sinnoh, and Unova) with little knowledge of the PPC, sure they saw and even briefly met some Mary Sues that had materialized in their continuum but they were never really affected and mostly just ignored them and continued on their way, until in the middle of their journey in Kalos (before the third gym) where they were unlucky enough to find a Gary Stu molesting a…Gardevoir.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Needless to say the group was shocked and appalled, so what did they do?  Well obviously, they kicked the dude’s ass (not with Pokémon but with fits) this is when the PPC agents (who were stalking the Stu) intervened and took care of the Stu themselves.  Impressed that the group not only took on the Stu (they did do a pretty good job at beating him up without using their Pokémon) but were also able to overcome the Stu’s aura.  They asked the trio if they would like to join the PPC, they say yes, but learn that they can’t finish their journey if they joined now, so they ask if they can first finish the Kalos region and THEN join the PPC as their retirement form Pokémon training.  The Flowers say ok, and after the Kalos they join the PPC as full time agents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The time line for all this is Johto-2009 and Kalos-2013, so they join by at least 2014.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So there it is, in all its still needing work glory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As always if there is anything wrong with the idea, like “the Flowers would never let them continue, as soon as you discover the PPC you have to join it”, tell me because I will never know until someone dose.&lt;br&gt;

            <p>and now we feel the need to just ask, what can we do to make this background idea work?<br><br>What we would like to do is have three characters (two handled/owned by me and one handled/owned by her) having a Pokemon training back story (with them having gone though Johto, Sinnoh, Unova, and Kalos)and then meeting and joining the PPC as their retirement from Pokemon training.  I would also like to make a comic about their Pokemon adventures as something on the side.<br><br>If no one can find away that this can work then we will just give up the idea internally and start a new, thank you all for all of the help now and (hopefully) in the future. :)</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been messing around with a Pokemon Trainer backstory for a small while now (wanting to have one on my second pair of Agents). The best ways I&#39;ve come up with are either to have a random plothole appear and suck him (for you them) in or to have them as bit characters in a non-existent badfic (because I remember reading you can do that somewhere) that were recruited into the PPC that way. The second one seeming to fit in with your original plan more, although you&#39;d have to lessen their importance in it (for example they could be around whilst the Stu is killed, but can&#39;t do the killing. <br><br>I hope that helps, it&#39;s just the groundwork for a plan anyway.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br><br>P.S I think I&#39;m right in saying that your sister will need to be introduced onto the Board and get Permission alongside you for her agent. </p>

            <p>I knew I  could do something like what you described, especially the second part.  <br><br>I&#39;ll just have to have them just witness the act, have the agents come in and do what they do and then notice the group and ask them some questions.  I changed it to that they have finished the Kalos region, so they are at that point of asking themselves of what they should do now with their lives.  So now that the PPC has introduced itself to them, they see grand adventures, the likes of which no one in their world will ever see, and they aren&#39;t going to let the opportunity slip by them. <br><br>I hope this is better, I myself can&#39;t see whats wrong with this at all right now.  <br><br>P.S my sis just wants my idea to be workable in the PPC before she introduces herself.</p>

            <p>There are still some things that need to be sorted out with what is now their back-story. <br>1) They wouldn&#39;t have any knowledge of the PPC, the only people who aren&#39;t related to the PPC but know if it are well, listed here: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Canons_Who_Know_of_the_PPC"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Canons_Who_Know_of_the_PPC">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Canons_Who_Know_of_the_PPC</a></a> . <br>2) They wouldn&#39;t encounter Sues who materialized into their continuum. Or rather if they did they&#39;d likely be Generic Pokemon Trainers (or NPC&#39;s potentially) and so wouldn&#39;t react in such a way as you&#39;re having them do. (this leading nicely on to...)<br>3) I&#39;m not sure they&#39;d get recruited like that. I know that bit characters (and others) can be recruited into the PPC (I can&#39;t remember the exact reasons/pre-requisites).<br>4) Err how do they get to the PPC after they finish their training? It&#39;s not like they could of been left a portal generator or a RA to get there. Also, I think the flowers would be OOC to allow them to not join the PPC with their memories intact (remembering that standard procedure generally involves a neuralizer).<br><br>Also remember that the timelines don&#39;t need to match. <br><br>Storme Hawk <br>P.S If i&#39;m wrong on any of it, please correct me<br>P.P.S No offence meant in any of the post above</p>

            <p>Bit characters can be recruited into the PPC. Basically, it depends on this factoid: if the bit character had a charge list started but didn&#39;t get enough charges to be charged as a Mary Sue, they can either be released to the canon to integrate into it, or they can be recruited to the PPC. From there, it&#39;s up to writer preference whether the bit character is recruited or not.<br><br>Note, too, that if a Mary Sue is not overblown enough, they <i>can</i> be recruited to the PPC.

            <p>well how about they meet and join the PPC after they finish the Kalos region.  So after the elite four and such they perform the act that I state in the post (or something else, if you have any ideas please tell me)but instantly join after meeting the PPC.<br><br>Also if you&#39;re possibly wondering about the elite four and stuff, I see it as if they win they are aloud to stay as the champion or leave with just a hall of fame, stating that they have beaten the champion or do it Pokemon anime style and have them be in like, 8th or 4th place and such.<br><br>Also the continuum that they live in isn&#39;t THEIR continuum, I guess I didn&#39;t word that right.  In the continuum that they live in, they are basically bit characters (my idea now is having them there during some moments in the games story as background characters)<br><br>As always look, read, and check if this can work.</p>

Not only that, but I loved playing with my one in BW2&#39;s competitive RU scene; Eelektross&#39; vast movepool served it well.<br><br>I just pray it was served well by the Gen VI TMs and Egg Moves list. I don&#39;t know about you, but I want the old offensive pivot set to start really wrecking face again.

            <p>Of a rather more casual bent than most, though, alas. I only got back into it via Showdown, since I share your impatience for grinding and much prefer the setup used in Showdown&#39;s team builder. I have, however, a friend who&#39;s sending me a perfect-IVs Tynamo later today, so all shall be well in that regard.<br><br>You can use Eelektross in UU with the offensive pivot set I mentioned, but it takes a little getting used to.

Eelektross&#39;s base speed is atrocious, hence its relegation to the lower tiers. Seriously, a base speed of 50 in a speed-focused meta like Smogon just plain ol&#39; don&#39;t cut it. However, it can work very well, it just needs support. I like using Choice Band Hustle Durant as a physical wallbreaker and Druddigon and Qwilfish for rocks and <s>looking like a neon-pink novelty condom</s> <i>spikes</i> respectively. I ladder with it, but I can&#39;t wait for a proper Gen VI RU tier.<br><br>Gen V&#39;s RU: the tier for ladies and gentlemen of quality.</p>

            <p>Where Smogon was before Showdown was released. It uses slightly different tiers to Showdown (They&#39;re still OU, UU etc. just some of the Pokemon are in different tiers) the main difference tier-wise being that RU is called LU (lesser-used). Overall they&#39;re very similar although Showdown seems to have more serious gamers on it than PO.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s a complicated question, isn&#39;t it?<br>On one hand, it exists as a medium to express our displeasure at those who would corrupt our fandom with bad writing/spelling, bland OCs, Mary Sues, poor grammar, and to generally mock them as often as possible. Unlike the Official Fanfiction Academies, the PPC doesn&#39;t exist to teach writers to do better while delivering an amusing tale at the same time, it is there for the sole purpose of comedy.<br>On the offhand, it is capable of creating an entire world built around a simplistic concept, filled with characters that make us laugh, cry, and go &#39;Sweet bifurcated Darth Maul! That was awesome!&#39; The PPC is more than just a costume, it&#39;s a culture. A culture filled with half-mad assassins/exorcists/space-time cops/reformed villains armed with lethal weapons, but a culture nonetheless.<br>A tale from the PPC must be funny, entertaining, immersive, and most importantly, it must be written from the heart. It&#39;s an exercise in self-expression, and a way to inform writers that what they&#39;re posting is not the best they can manage, they can always do better. I&#39;ve seen so many stories with excellent premises, but are executed(both ways) so poorly it makes me cringe.<br><br>This gives me an idea. To all you agents out there, try finding a fic with a good idea at the center and nurturing that tiny breeze until it grows into a great wind that sweeps over the internet like a... like a great wind!<br><br>My time is coming.

            <p>Specifically, this line: <i>Unlike the Official Fanfiction Academies, the PPC doesn&#39;t exist to teach writers to do better while delivering an amusing tale at the same time, it is there for the sole purpose of comedy.</i><br><br>I think the PPC absolutely does exist to teach writers to do better. Perhaps not the individual fanwriters whose stories get sporked by us, but everyone who reads the missions, and indeed everyone who <i>writes</i> them, should be able to pick up a thing or two in the process. A mission is two things: a critique of a particular badfic and an independent narrative about the agents. If a mission doesn&#39;t adequately show why the badfic is bad, it has failed. Further, if a mission doesn&#39;t stand as an example of good storytelling in and of itself, it has failed. There&#39;s a reason we don&#39;t just let anyone write for the PPC, after all: we expect quality.<br><br>On top of that, it must also entertain, but that&#39;s almost a secondary concern; it&#39;ll have a hard time entertaining if it&#39;s riddled with spurious, unsupported accusations, poor mechanics, bland characters, and dull narrative. There also has to be a balance lest it turn into an essay with quotation marks thrown in (too much critique, not enough story/snark), an MST (too much snark, not enough story/critique), or something that might as well be original fiction (too much story, not enough critique/snark). Learning to strike that balance should teach writers to do better. Seeing how it&#39;s done should teach readers to do better. QED.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I ran it through the words I knew (pretty much just what&#39;s on the doors of Moria) and got several instances where it didn&#39;t translate. So it&#39;s got a very, very tiny dictionary, and therefore probably doesn&#39;t do grammar at all. (Programming translations is hard! It&#39;s even harder than doing them by hand, and I&#39;ve done enough Latin and Spanish by hand to know.)</p>

            <p>That&#39;s Grey Company Elvish to the rest of you ;). The big clue is that the word it gives for &#39;I&#39; is &#39;amin&#39;.<br><br>... on the other hand, it&#39;s not even Grelvish - it lacks the horrible double-vowelled &#39;to be&#39; verbs (though it does possess &#39;ier&#39; for &#39;are&#39;). Hrm. &#39;To be&#39; is difficult in Sindarin - but &#39;anim&#39; (not &#39;amin&#39;) is &#39;for myself&#39; in S., not &#39;I&#39;. It also gives the frankly bizarre &#39;kalina&#39; for &#39;light&#39; - which looks like a mangle of Quenya &#39;calima&#39;.<br><br>The dictionary it&#39;s working from is <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/empire2/angora5/dictionary.js">here</a>, and includes the term &#39;me&#39;urra kosta&#39; for &#39;lightning bolt&#39;. That phrase also appears in the <a href="http://www.grey-company.org/Language/Files/phrase.pdf">Grelvish phrasebook</a> - but is translated as &#39;lanta en’ kalale&#39;. Um...<br><br>Ah. It appears to be <i>outdated</i> Grelvish, specifically as outlined in <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/155531355/Elven-Language-Tolkien">this 2001 document</a>. Good grief. So it&#39;s... literally useless, even if for some reason you want to speak Grelvish.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Let me bring another example of a character that is extremely powerful but may not be a Marty Stu. One-Punch Man. Because he literally defeats numerous monsters with only one punch. No monsters can beat him. At all. I swear, by [deity]&#39;s name.<br><br>But One-Punch Man still has problems. In his world, he&#39;s considered a madman on speedos as he&#39;s not licensed into the central superhero organisation yet. After the examination, his &#39;student&#39; is far higher rank than he is, and far more popular. And his cute, weakling face does not help project power to people. So no one, NO ONE,  believes his achievements or power even when they see it in front of their eyes. And when people see it? They thought he&#39;s a scam, tagging along S-class heroes to raise his rank. Or using them so he gets the final &#39;experince&#39; points after they beat the monster almost to a pulp.<br><br>The guy&#39;s challenges include acceptance into a society that doesn&#39;t believe of his might, his boredom over the lack of enemies equal to his strength, and his baldness. He madehen judge for yourself whether he&#39;s a Marty-Stu or not.<br><br></p>

            <p>An interesting essay on Mary Sues (spreading like wildfire on tumblr) brought me to this wiki; to the Department of Mary Sues and eventually to the adventures (or should I say misadventures) of Acacia and Jay in The Original Series and...<br><br>Wow, here I thought I was the only one to take fanfiction writing a tad too seriously! Jokes aside, reading of their exploits has motivated me to joining the PPC with the intention of eventually creating my own agent, in order to tackle some of the badfics abundant in my own favorite series/fandom. <br><br>A little background on me--I&#39;ve been reading since I was ten, and have been writing twice as long. I grew up on anime/manga and have a taste for fantasy and Stephen King books. I&#39;ve been writing fanfiction since I was fourteen and original fiction since I was eight. I&#39;m here because I think the PPC and its intentions are freaking amazing. <br></p>

She also wrote for Redwall&#39;s OFU before its abrubt halt. I&#39;m not entirely familiar with her work, aside from the enjoyable OFUR, but she was apparently influential enough and well-thought-of enough to be named a Permission Giver, according to her user page on the wiki.</p>

If the reactions between the two are as severe as you say, I pray that all agents of the PPC are sober as judges, whether on duty or off; according to the NHS&#39;s page on the subject, one unit of alcohol takes an hour to break down completely, and I assume people who treat Bleeprin like Smarties are going to have similar self-control levels when it comes to alcohol.<br><br>Maybe it&#39;s just covered in Basic Training oh wait.</p>

            <p>Back when I was a shiny newbie, I remember that every badfic in a fandom I knew was something terribad to rage over and write anger-venting missions about (once I got Permission). Recently, however, I found that my reaction to most badfic I chance upon (whether by browsing ff.net or seeing it here on the Board) tends to be either laughter, rolling my eyes or jaded cynicism. I wonder, is it just me, or do PPCers generally get less excitable the longer they hang around?<br>(Also... around for two years. What.)</p>

            <p>I was never one to get frothing-at-the-mouth angry at badfic when I first joined, and still don&#39;t today. If anything, I&#39;ve calmed down even more over time. My reactions tend to be as you described alongside a healthy dollop of aggrieved sighs (although I suppose that might fall under &#39;jaded cynicism&#39;).<br><br>There are a few things that will get me keyed up, mind you: blatant sexism, blatant racism, trivialization of rape, and so forth. Then again, I don&#39;t actively look for possible mission starters that have those things. I feel that when I&#39;m angry, I don&#39;t write as well as I normally could. I prefer to look for something that inspires me to be funny, or to tell a good story.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t mean that as a slight against younger PPCers, hear me out. It&#39;s usually the younger and newer to fandom members who get really excited and melodramatic about badfic, the ones who, not to mince words, seem to treat its existence as if it&#39;s personal insult. That&#39;s something that one outgrows and gains perspective on as they get used to communities like ours - I don&#39;t think most anyone thinks it&#39;s that huge a deal out of continuity (obviously in-continuity it really is a threat that can tear reality asunder! :P) but it&#39;s still fun to poke at a particularly bad one, or at least one that can be the backdrop for a good story.<br><br>But I speak as a PPCer who stopped really caring about fanfic pretty quickly, so who knows, I could be an outlier.</p>

            <p>For me, I think it&#39;s a combination of becoming inured due to exposure and simply getting older, gaining perspective, and realizing that, in the grand scheme of things, badfic really isn&#39;t that big of a deal. There are still a few things that irritate me or even make me angry, but for the most part I don&#39;t find them to be worth my time. I prefer to write missions to fics that mostly make me laugh with their badness, with one or two really bad points upon which to build the mission&#39;s climax. It&#39;s no fun writing a mission when the subject matter is purely painful to deal with. I&#39;m not on a crusade here; this is a hobby. It <i>should</i> be fun. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Sometimes it troubles me sometimes how easily writing missions could shade into bullying the writer. I don&#39;t want to do that, and I don&#39;t think anyone else here wants to do that, either; we&#39;ve got nothing against beginners, and we&#39;ve all got our own past horrible writing and Mary Sues to keep us humble. Still--I worry a little.<br><br>Without criticism, writers wouldn&#39;t have accountability. Parody is a push to keep quality high. Writing parodies puts the most pressure of all on the people writing the parodies--we become more aware of what mistakes people make and how to avoid them.<br><br>In the PPCverse, if Mary Sues are such a threat to the continua, there has to be a reason why the Mary Sue is targeted, rather than the author. Obviously, in the real world, it&#39;s because we&#39;re not going to verbally beat up some innocent person who happens to have written a really bad fic. In-world, though--why don&#39;t agents just go to the writer&#39;s house in World One, confiscate their writing implements, or just neuralyze them and tell them that they never want to write again?<br><br>Seems to me that the PPC isn&#39;t just protecting the continua; they&#39;re protecting the writers, too. Fan writers are a good thing. Goodfic strengthens the continuum. But people who write goodfic don&#39;t get there without writing some badfic first. In order to protect the continuum, you have to eliminate the damage done by badfic without also eliminating the author&#39;s potential to write goodfic.<br><br>It&#39;s a handy metaphor for what we&#39;re trying to do IRL. We&#39;re saying, &quot;Hey, this is bad writing! Stoppit!&quot; without also saying, &quot;You suck; stop writing,&quot; because the only way to cure sucky writing is to *write more*.<br><br>I guess I just felt like I needed to remind people of that. Anyways, back to your regularly scheduled sporkings...</p>

            <p>Since the PPC and the OFUS are at least somewhat linked, maybe retraining the authors is officially the OFUs&#39; job, while eliminating the results of the early bad writing is the PPC&#39;s?  This would also partly explain why the Department of Author Correspondence was shut down: as more OFUs were founded (in-universe; I think they&#39;ve actually become less common since Miss Cam&#39;s heyday), the PPC&#39;s involvement in that side of the equation lessened until our assistance was no longer needed.<br><br>(I wonder what the OFUs think of the PPC in hS&#39; alternate future, where the Efficient take over and a Department of Author Correction appears?  Would the coordinators side with the Efficient and keep canon stable but unbolstered by goodfic, or side with the students and try to keep fan writing varied?)<br><br>Anyway, my missions so far seem to treat the &quot;Sue&quot; character more sympathetically the more like their author they (probably) are--not intentionally on my part, I&#39;ll admit; that&#39;s just the way the stories wrote themselves.<br><br>My first mission had an inexplicably fire-proof Sue who not only reaffirmed the viewpoint of <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>&#39;s villains, but also heavily trivialized orphanages.  My agents assassinated her.<br><br>My second mission had a group of friends aspiring to become musicians.  The lead singer falls through a portal (laziest plothole ever, perhaps) into 221B Baker Street, where she meets not-going-to-bother-finishing-this-sentence.  While I was initially writing her as Sue, in the end, I was treating her like an author from the modern day era of the Holmes canon.  (Obviously not true, but we&#39;re lookin in-universe here.)  The story actually mistreated her friends and family far worse than the canon characters, which mage throwing the Sue back into her correct time zone a more satisfying ending than assassination.  The benefit to doing that was that I could show her at the end readjusting to a more normal life, but with the band still aspiring to become professional.  I think (I hope) this jives with what you&#39;re saying bout the badfic authors eventually moving on to other, better things (though not a written thing, in this case).<br><br>My third mission has actually been done for quite some time, but important threads like this keep going up that I don&#39;t want to push down, so I wait a couple weeks, and another important thread comes up, and I wait more . . . Maybe I&#39;ll finally put it up this week.  Anyway, I don&#39;t want to spoil it much, but the main OCs again turned out to be somewhat equated with authorship by the end, and also do not get assassinated (the fic had mostly DTO-type problems anyway).<br><br>(My fourth mission will be a trollfic and I doubt anything uplifting is going to happen there.)</p>

            <p>...that this should show up in some of the missions, that is, in conversation. Maybe an agent needs to be reminded of this; maybe a new agent just doesn&#39;t get it, and demands to know *why* they can&#39;t go yell at the authors. Maybe someone gets hit with a Random Exposition Ray or something and this is one of the things that comes out. But however it&#39;s done, I think this should come out in a variety of missions--in different departments, by different authors--because it&#39;s very important, and I think that at least a few of us, if not most or all of us, could use this reminder from time to time. Honestly, I think this should go on the wiki somewhere; it&#39;s a very good explanation, and a well-worded reminder. Perhaps it could become part of the FAQs or Guides?<br><br>Either way, I think this is very important, and thank you for writing it out so clearly. At the very least, it&#39;s an interesting insight; at the most, it&#39;s, well, very important, as I&#39;ve already said.<br><br>~DF</p>
