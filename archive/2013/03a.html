            <p>Sorry I&#39;ve been gone for a while, and sorry I haven&#39;t said hi to the newcomers in that time. Exams suck hard.<br><br>So I was thinking that not all Mary Sues are horribly written. I mean, the main character in Daughter of Smoke and Bone was a definite Sue (naturally bright blue hair, extremely talented artist, gorgeous, all the guys want her), and the story and prose was still fairly enjoyable. So do you guys know any other well written Sues, and what do you have to say about the?</p>

            <p>Jumping in a bit behind the times here, but between this and the recent Eragon thread, I am getting the sense that y&#39;all might like to see some tweaks to the current wording of the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mary_Sue">Mary Sue wiki article</a>, since as it stands, there is the potential to create this kind of confusion. I think the emphasis needs to be that a Mary Sue story can be <i>enjoyable</i>, but the phrase &quot;if written well&quot; should be taken out in favor of something more clear, yes? Any other thoughts and suggestions are welcome.<br><br>Also, I think I&#39;d like to expand on the Canon Sue section, to explain what constitutes story-warping in their case (hS, I might borrow some of your language from this thread if that&#39;s okay). Plus, the main Canon Sue article is ugly-looking and needs some revision, IMO. Again, any suggestions are welcome.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who still exists; just got a little wrapped up in other stuff for a while.</p>

            <p>There seems to be a dualistic view - that Mary Sue is an archetype that can be written well or poorly, but is skewed towards poorly, or that a Mary Sue is, by definition, poorly written. We&#39;ve hashed this out multiple times, and it keeps coming up, and those of us who have taken firm stands have rarely, if ever, stepped down from them. I&#39;d be in favor of an explanation of the two definitions - since it is, after all, a key component of the organization.</p>

            <p>It seems to me that a character that A. does not behave like a believable-for-the-context person, B. does not get believable-for-the-context treatment from others, and C. is successful just because the plot says so, in fact, is not well written (presuming, of course, that the story was intended to be taken seriously). So, perhaps without notice, I think that question may have been settled as far as the &quot;official&quot; definition is concerned. And, if you consider the in-universe outlook on Sues, I think it&#39;s the only one that fits. I can&#39;t recall ever seeing an agent argue that Sues can be written well, even though Boarders have.<br><br>That said, I agree that some kind of explanation of the archetype definition wouldn&#39;t go amiss. I think I may have even made a case for it in the past...? I&#39;m not sure. But anyway, there&#39;s an explanation of the definition of Sues as author inserts already, so I don&#39;t see why another one couldn&#39;t go in. Maybe &quot;Alternative Definitions&quot; could be its own section under &quot;A Brief History.&quot;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think that the primary way a Mary-Sue story can be enjoyable is if it is to some degree self-aware - which of course slips it neatly over into parody, which makes it not a Mary-Sue.<br><br>The alternate version is a MS-esque character who is nevertheless a background component to a well-written story - which again, isn&#39;t a Mary-Sue story, in the same way that Lord of the Rings isn&#39;t a social study on Orc tribes, even though there&#39;s a bit of that in there.<br><br>The alternate-alternate version is an (over)powered character who nevertheless faces conflict - who isn&#39;t a Mary-Sue.<br><br>And the alternate-alternate-alternate version is enjoying a story <i>in spite of</i> the protagonist being a Mary-Sue, which I guess is what is being suggested here - so for instance worldbuilding that trumps the characters - which... I suppose is possible. But that doesn&#39;t make it well-written.

            <p>What I have in mind is mostly the alternate-alternate-alternate version (people sure seem to enjoy some Sues despite the fact that they are Sues), but also, I think there needs to be a distinction made between technical quality, meaning SPaG, and artistic(? is there a better word?) quality, meaning everything else. A Sue story can be <i>technically</i> well-written in that the SPaG passes muster, but the Sue itself is still not a well-crafted character by our current definition, is what I&#39;m aiming for.<br><br>I feel like a couple of distinctions need to be clarified, SPaG vs. Characterization/Worldbuilding/Etc. being the main one.

            <p>Yes, that makes perfect sense.<br><br>Please tell me if my summary is correct:<br><br>1) There is no such thing as a &quot;well-written Sue&quot; in the sense of a Sue that fits in with the story. By definition, it&#39;s impossible: to use your words, a Sue &quot;A. does not behave like a believable-for-the-context person, B. does not get believable-for-the-context treatment from others, and C. is successful just because the plot says so.&quot;<br><br>2) A &quot;well-written Sue&quot; in the sense that the story is free from technical (SPaG) errors can exist (and some of them have been sporked very well by Araeph in a certain series of posts for heave_ho).<br><br>3) A &quot;well-written Sue,&quot; in the sense that the story is free of technical errors, stylistic errors, and is entertaining <i>despite</i> the Sue, is theoretically doable. But if an author has the worldbuilding skills to do that, then he should try to fix the characterization problems that make the Sue a Sue in the first place.</p>

            <p>And, especially on the subject of stories that people enjoy despite their Sues, I&#39;m particularly thinking of canon Sues—some of us do, in fact, get something out of <i>Eragon</i> and <i>Twilight</i> despite their problems, and I&#39;m sure there are other examples.

            <p>It irks me when people leave glowing reviews on Suefics with nearly flawless SPaG, because to some people, Sues only exist in fics with a horrendous grasp of grammar.

            <p>Well, I&#39;ve seen Harry Potter referred to as a well-written Canon Stu, but...it depends on the definition, really.

            <p>In my opinion, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=238987;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">firemagic</a> and <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=238988;%22">hS</a> hit it on the head (and it seems that <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=239004;">you&#39;re getting it</a>): it&#39;s all in how you define Sue. Now I haven&#39;t read Daughter of Smoke and Bone, but according to what you said, she does not seem like a Sue, since the story does not revolve around her. And if the MC herself has to deal with actual conflict (as opposed to just breezing through everything with her sooper speshul powers because *everyone knows* that nothing should go wrong for the heroine) then that settles it: she&#39;s no Sue.<br><br>In short, I think that there is a difference (albeit a slight one) between an author loading her main character with so many powers that it breaks the suspension of disbelief <i>even given the continuum</i>, and a full-blown Mary Sue.<br><br>P.S.: At the risk of sounding pedantic, it seems that we Anglophones have a problem with pluralizing Deus ex Machina. If you are open to consulting the original Latin, consider <i>Dei ex Machinis</i>.</p>

            <p>... are all very well, but surely the gods are all coming from the same machine? In which case, <i>Dei ex Machina</i> would be more appropriate.<br><br>Okay, my actual reason for replying... it&#39;s not entirely about whether the character deals with conflict. There are many Mary-Sues who are captured and tortured (and then sexed back to health by Legolas, but I digress). The question is whether the <i>author</i> has to deal with conflict when it arises, or just gives the character everything.<br><br>To take two examples:<br><br><i>Marianna was walking through the woods when suddenly a pair of Orcs leapt out from behind a tree. &quot;Now we have you!&quot; one snarled, grabbing her by the arm. &quot;You will never escape!&quot;</i><br><br>Obviously Marianna is in a &#39;conflict&#39; situation - but the author isn&#39;t. She&#39;s handed her character a situation, without anyone having to work to get it. Essentially, this scene exists solely to move the characters to their next positions.<br><br><i>Marianna hadn&#39;t slept in three days. She had lost track of exactly which mountain she was on - she wasn&#39;t even entirely sure what range it was in! All she knew was that she had to keep running, keep moving away from-<br><br>She tripped, for the hundred thousandth time, shredding even more of her jeans and gaining new cuts on her hand. With a part of her mind - a part that remained calm despite the horrific danger - she wondered how many scratches it would take before she infected herself with something.<br><br>When she stood up, an Orc shoved her back down. &quot;Now we have you!&quot; it snarled. &quot;You will never escape!&quot;</i><br><br>That scene exists as a scene in its own right. The end result is exactly the same, but here Marianna hasn&#39;t twisted the story to get herself captured as fast as possible - she&#39;s done what any normal person would do, and bolted. What happens after she bolts? Well, (thinks a non-Mary-Sue author) they need to hunt her down...<br><br>hS</p>

On the other hand, If one is more loose in one&#39;s definition (e.g., all that makes a Sue is sooper speshul powers), then it is possible to have a well-written Sue.</p>

            <p>... then pretty much <i>any protagonist</i> can be called a Mary-Sue. Think about the unlikely luck given to characters like Frodo Baggins - or Oliver Twist - or Rincewind.

            <p>I think you&#39;re talking about the story being written well despite having a Sueish character. Well, Star Trek: The Next Generation had the famed Canon Sue Wesley Crusher, but the show was still excellent, and even the episodes with him weren&#39;t that bad, mostly because they worked on debunking his Sue-ish-ness (there&#39;s one where his genius-kid science experiment escapes and threatens the ship). They still weren&#39;t the high points of the show, though, and as I go down my lists of favorite episodes, I find that he doesn&#39;t play a big role in any of them.<br>In fanfiction, I&#39;ve found Suefics that have decent SPaG and keep everyone in character, yet are still blatant Suefics. I will be less likely to spork them, though, since there isn&#39;t as much to laugh at.</p>

            <p>I could plug my more sue-ish characters as being well written, but that of course is just ego stroking, and I generally try to tone down my characters&#39; benefits with equal or greater detriments anyhow, so they don&#39;t count.<br><br>I guess I could try and claim that Batman is a well-written Stu and see how that goes.</p>

            <p>Have you ever read any fantasy novels by Sara Douglass? It&#39;s been a long time since I read anything by her, but I remember that she always gave her main characters tons and tons of powers. I mean, like, entire categories of magical abilities. They were usually (if not always) special chosen ones from birth or before, often with angsty pasts, and they could do whatever the plot required. And everyone loved them. I think. I might be misremembering one or two.<br>But the stories themselves were very interesting and well written nonetheless.</p>

            <p>Than just about everyone featured was either a sue or an anti-sue. To be fair, most were either firstborns, gods, or had divine blood running through their veins. So that works.<br><br>Another well written canon!sue, in my opinion, would have to be Princes Cadence. She is the pink alicorn princess of love with a special name amongst ponies (though translated roughly from italian, her name is My Love Song, which does sound a little more like a pony name), who foalsat Twilight and is engaged to Twilights brother who is captain of the royal guard and we never heard of before. If I had found that character premise in a fanfiction, she would find herself impaled with a spork so fast. <br><br>Yet, I think, she works. Somehow, some way, the writers of the show made her work, and work really well. Not well enough for best princess role, but well enough that I would not kill her if I went absolutely insane and began killing of perceived canon Sues as well. I think the reason as the way she was introduced: we saw the villain cloaked as her first. Then, once Chrysalis was revealed to be a villain, and we see Cadence for the first time, her determination to protect her fiancee, Twilight, and the rest of pony kind, you start to like her. Then when you see that she truly cares for anyone who is willing to be loved, and will even sacrifice her own life to protect those she loves... You actually like her as a character. So there you go ladies and gentlemen, a well written Sue, who has no reasons she should be able to be well written.<br><br>However, I assume you mean well written Mary Sues from fanfiction. In that department... Nyx from Past Sins? I don&#39;t know, I have not found one other than her who even makes me hesitate. I don&#39;t think she is brilliantly well written, and personally am not a fan of hers, but when one character has the fandom split almost in two over whether she is a good character who deserves all of our love, or if she is a flaming Mary Sue who needs to die for the preservation of canon, she definitely gets some hesitation and a mention here. She lies on the absolute border of being a bad Mary Sue and a good Mary Sue, but her Mary Sueness is almost undeniable. <br><br>Actually, that said, has anyone else read Past Sins? If you have, what did you think about it and the character of Nyx? If you have not, here is the link to the fic: <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/41596/Past-Sins"><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/41596/Past-Sins">http://www.fimfiction.net/story/41596/Past-Sins</a></a><br>Pen Stroke is a good author, I think. I have read some of his other works and enjoyed them quite a bit. However, this fic, his most famous one, is the center of a huge amount of <s>gory fights to the death</s> debates, almost all of them about Nyx. As a Mary Sue killing group, it seems like a reasonable place to decide, definitively, whether Nyx is good or bad. Keep in mind, this is not about if the fic is good or bad, this is just about the character of Nyx. </p>

            <p>...Still not a fan. It felt to me like the problems of those episodes should have been solved by the Mane Six, not a new character we just met. Also, she was apparently an important part of Twilight&#39;s backstory, yet we never met her before. Same with Shining Armor - if Twilight loved him so much, why did she never mention him? Also, I hear that Cadance was added so that <i>there could be a pink princess pony for little girls</i> - well, that comes across as gender stereotyping to me. Just a bit. *sarcasm* So, shoved in, upstages main characters, and propagates gender stereotypes. Smells like Sue to me.<br>So yeah, not a Cadance fan. Hope I haven&#39;t sounded too rant-y.</p>

            <p>Remember, despite it&#39;s quality, the show is basically a 22 minute long commercial for the toys. In the chain of command, there are yhe animators, then the writers, then the directors,  but above them is Big Daddy Hasbro. Hasbro has full creative controll over the cartoon. They just decided to allow the artists to do -almost- whatever they want, but the controll is still there. That&#39;s why Celestia and Luna are called &#39;princesses&#39; and Cadence is an alicorn of love. She was going to be a normal unicorn who had a very loving personality, but hasbro wanted a new pink alicorn princess to sell, and thus Cadence became a Mary Sue. Is she the best? No, but she is the best with what the writers had.<br><br>Just my opinion. Apricot, since you currently have the computer, your thoughts?</p>

            <p>But they managed to work other concessions to Hasbro in a less obviously forced way. They needed to have a fashionable pony  so they could sell outfits, and Rarity happened. She&#39;s fashionable but that doesn&#39;t make her any less of a strong character. They needed to have princess ponies, and that was simply a matter of changing the title. The job is still queen. It also seems slightly justified in that two princesses rule. <br><br>Or, so that the plot of &quot;A Canterlot Wedding&quot; isn&#39;t completely screwed over, that the changelings did something to the Elements of Harmony that made them inactive, and Cadance and Shining Armor&#39;s love made them active so that the Mane Six could use them. It just seemed to me that a season finale should have involved the Mane Six using the Elements of Harmony, not just helping some new pony so she can douse Canterlot in saccharine love.<br><br>So they could have done better, but you&#39;re right, it&#39;s not as bad as it could have been. She could have been a main cast member and not just a recurring character. She could have completely upstaged them rather than partially.<br><br>Speaking of controversial things in MLP fandom, what is <i>your</i> opinion of Alicorn!Twilight? My feeling is that it was really sudden and the episode was incredibly rushed, but if they explain it next season, I&#39;ll be okay with it. They better show some pressures of being a princess, some alienation from society because of her new high status, some crashes as she learns to use her wings, etc. If they don&#39;t, then they took my favorite character and Sued her, and <s>there will be blood</s> I will be upset and pretend fourth season isn&#39;t canon.<br></p>

I don&#39;t know, perhaps Star Swirl the Bearded comes back and changes he into a powerful unicorn wizard pony, maybe Discord takes her wings away and Twilight prefers it because the stress of princesshood it too great, I don&#39;t know.

            <p>Especially if it were <s>Q</s> Discord. I had a plot bunny before I saw the Twiacorn episode which involved Discord switching around their species, kind of the way the cutie marks were swapped, only better, because they would <i>know</i> what was happening to them and be upset about it i.e. Dash hates being an Earth pony.

I was thinking Dash, Twilight, and Rarity as Earth ponies, Pinkie as a pegasus, Applejack as a unicorn, and Fluttershy left unchanged, because a. Fluttershy is Discord&#39;s friend and b. she would care if she became a unicorm or Earth pony. She&#39;s already sort of an Earth pony and she&#39;d just use her magic to help her animals.<br><br>It&#39;s funny that with how huge the brony fandom is the Hasbro doesn&#39;t realize making decisions like that isn&#39;t necessarily the best policy.  Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I also think if a little kid is watching MLP and then wants the toys, it&#39;s because she wants toys of her favorite characters, not because she wants a princess pony. That is such a gender stereotyped way of looking at things, I could just scream! (<sub>eeee…</sub>) So both kids and bronies will be fine with good stories and interesting characters, and if they want to sell more toys, they should just expand the cast of background ponies.</p>

            <p>The defining characteristic of a Sue - at least, in my opinion - is breaking rules of canon. For example, Wesley Crusher from Star Trek: The Next Generation breaks Star Trek canon because he pilots the Enterprise as a teenager (aren&#39;t there qualified personnel for that?) and is allowed to do so by Captain Picard despite Picard&#39;s dislike of children. Badly written means the writer breaking their own rules to make the character more speshul. In fanfiction, this is more common because you have to play by someone else&#39;s rules. But it can still happen in original fiction.</p>

            <p>I mean, the PPC definition kinda means that having an engaging plot doesn&#39;t really happen. Anyways, any character can seem Sueish broken down into parts. How did that MC act? If she had actual flaws and suffered consequences she&#39;s not really a Sue.</p>

            <p>She didn&#39;t really have flaws (almost everything she did was portrayed as good) and to be honest, the story was basically a paranormal romance :) I know, I know. <br><br>But there was really good world building, the prose was gorgeous, and I liked the secondary characters.

            <p>As with all fiction, everything you do has to make sense, somehow. If, using your example continuums, the main world is LotR and the characters are reading Harry Potter, that would probably not be a good idea, and would have to be a crossover to work at all. If it is the inverse on the other hand, as you said, then it should be fine, and could be interesting. It all depends on setting. But no, to answer your question, it is not a crossover. <br><br>Then again, if it is going to be posted somewhere like fanfiction.net, you might want to call it a crossover, or have the two continuum listed in the tags, so that people trying to read a fic purely about the main world are not confused. Just an idea.</p>

            <p>As one of my pet peeves is people not getting the timelines right (e.g. HP characters listening to Lady Gaga), there&#39;s nothing to worry about here. LotR is supposed to be pre-pre-history anyway, not to mention the different languages, so those characters reading modern books would not make any sense.

            <p>I concur it sounds interesting. :)<br><br>I&#39;ve not read the Sword of Truth books. (I&#39;ve been told maybe I shouldn&#39;t just because I don&#39;t do well with graphic descriptions.) But I really liked the Legend of the Seeker TV series that is based off those books.</p>

            <p>I watched a few episodes of that a couple of years ago. What bothered me about the series was that the plot was radically different from that of the book. For example, the bit where Richard was held captive by the Mord-Sith was reduced to a single episode near the middle (I think), whereas in the book it was much longer and near the end. Descriptive writing...yeah, there&#39;s a lot of that. &quot;Her eyebrows had the graceful arch of a raptor&#39;s wings in flight&quot; and other such stuff. In a situation where they&#39;re running for their lives. Bleargh. Quite a few things were utterly predictable, such as the identity of the wizard, but what made it bearable was stuff like the fact that Rahl wasn&#39;t acting just for the sake of TEH EBILNESS, but because he genuinely believed the world would be a better place under his rule. At least, that&#39;s how I understood it.</p>

            <p>Is it weird that Applebloom and Scootaloo&#39;s version of Sam and Frodo&#39;s speech on Orodruin/Mount Friendship gave me more feels than the version in the movie? I think it was Applebloom&#39;s adorable sad-accent that did it.<br>This was so well-casted, too. All of the LotR pony counterparts were perfect. The only thing I&#39;m disappointed about is that we never saw who played Saruman. It&#39;s the good kind of disappointed, though, the &quot;Now the fan-speculation lobe of my brain is going to be churning out possibilities for a week&quot; kind.</p>

            <p>Ha :D I don&#39;t even watch MLP, but this is pretty funny. &quot;No pony simply trots into Maredor&quot; is what broke me, honestly. Or possibly the end of the intro. Not sure.

            <p>You can find all the episodes online. It looks like a sparkly little kids&#39; show, but it is actually really good, for reasons I can&#39;t put into words. Just watch it with an open mind, and you&#39;ll be surprised.</p>

The fanfic for it is pretty weird, though. No &#39;Sues that I can remember (a couple good OCs, though), but oh is there ever so much slash. About three quarters of the stories involve at least one slash pairing. Not that I have a problem with that, in fact I ship Rosiel/Katan, if you remember who they are. My problem is with the PWP stuff, but then, I&#39;m the sort of person who reads romance novels for the plot (and is often sorely disappointed).</p>

            <p>The name&#39;s Dark Lord Aakmal. Have you read the Silmarillion? Haven&#39;t read LOTR, didn&#39;t have the money. As per tradition, I present to you this virtual mortar and pestle. Effective range up to 1.6 km, the pestle provided will spray the Sue with spices, preparing her enough for a meal with the orcs. The Sue being the main course, of course. Don&#39;t hit the pestle with the mortar though, you may be spiced instead. <br><br>As for the author requesting no fanfics until she finished with the series, I think that is a good idea. You know how often speculations fall short, rendering the fic uncanonical.</p>

            <p>The Silmarillion is my favorite Tolkien book! Many people think this is weird, because they think it&#39;s boring... I don&#39;t understand them. I probably should have listed Ardaverse as a whole in my favorites, instead of just LotR...<br>Free food for Orcs! Yay! Poor things, at least they can nom on some delicious(?) &#39;Sue now! And you can nom on these Bleep&#39;n&#39;ms!<br>Yeah, the no fanfic thing makes a lot of sense for the series in question, since the author jumps all over an internal time line of about 2000 years. He(!) also constantly redefines the magic system, because said magic is very much an individual thing for each user (e.g. one mage can read people&#39;s feelings while another has a hard time telling if someone is lying to him). These things could prove disastrous if Suethors and their ilk get their hands on them.</p>

            <p>Welcome, welcome. I see we share a fandom, and semi-share a couple of others. I love Lord of the Rings, and have liked all of the Discworld series I&#39;ve been able to read, but it&#39;s been a while for those. I&#39;m also a big fan of anime/manga though, love Naruto, (I even cosplay Haku!) and really liked what I&#39;ve read of Vampire Knight. Funds have prevented me from going further with both of them though.<br><br>I have a good friend who absolutely LOVES Angel Sanctuary so I&#39;ve seen a little of that too! I&#39;ve not had the chance to see Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, either though. *goes to look that up*<br><br>Welcome gifts! I almost forgot! XD I&#39;d like to present you with a set of my limited edition Atlantian sponge capsule sets. Just add water and you&#39;ll get a full sized sponge city with architectural design styles of your whim! And also a pair of radish earrings. :) </p>

            <p>Shame there isn&#39;t a full anime, though :( The OVA only covers the first arc (of six), and leaves out a lot of stuff as well. Naruto - there I have the luck that my mom reads and watches it, and tells me what happens. She got my dad hooked on it, too. (Yes, my parents are geeks. Yes, this is awesome.) Watch the Abridged Series (of Naruto), if you haven&#39;t already. It&#39;s very funny.<br>Thank you for the sponge city and the earrings, and have some Bleep&#39;n&#39;ms!</p>

            <p>She never got me far enough into the series to discover that. And maybe that was why, she knew there wasn&#39;t much of it, so she just showed me a couple episodes so I could see what it was all about! :D<br><br>That&#39;s awesome! My parents aren&#39;t into anime, but they love Spongebob XD I love Naruto, I&#39;ll have to check that out, although we did get pretty far in to Shippuden, so I don&#39;t know that it&#39;ll be new stuff XD <br><br>Mmmmm!

            <p>...unless you already knew that?<br>Sadly, there are only three episodes in the Angel Sanctuary OVA. They cover the first three and a quarter books...of twenty. Also, as I said, they left out a lot of stuff - probably about half the third book. You could try reading the manga on a scanlation site. Tell me when you&#39;re done :-)<br>I had a weird, but awesome, childhood. I started playing &quot;serious&quot; computer games when I was five, started watching Sailor Moon at six (other animes when they came out), read Harry Potter as soon as it came out, The Hobbit at nine or ten, LotR at eleven and the Silmarillion soon afterwards. Can&#39;t remember when I watched the original Star Wars, but I think I was about six or seven. Fun fact: I am now 22 and have yet to watch a single episode of Dr. Who. I do know the barest facts about it, though. (the Doctor is a Time Lord, the machine he uses is called a TARDIS, it looks like a police box, it&#39;s blue, Daleks go &quot;EXTERMINATE!&quot;)</p>

            <p>Welcome to the Board! I&#39;m DawnFire, as you can tell from the author tag...looks like we share three fandoms (HP, LotR, and Discworld), which is always a good thing. I&#39;ll kick off the gift-giving ceremony by presenting you with a large bar of Swiss Bleepolate, a necessity for badfic exploration. This Bleeproduct distracts the mind with sugar while working quickly to dull the horrific details it has just witnessed. May it serve you well.<br><br>Are you planning on writing missions?<br><br>And, another standard question (this one just to make sure): you&#39;ve read the Constitution and the Original Series, yes? From what you said, it seems likely, but we like to know :)<br><br>Once more, welcome! Glad you decided to say hi!<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Ok. *deep breath* After a lot of editing and idea development, I&#39;m finally ready to request Permission. <i>Finally</i>. Thank you to SeaTurtle and Karen for serving as beta-readers; your advice and encouragement has been very helpful. And, of course, thanks to World-Jumper for planting the idea to write missions at all in my head back in January. (At least, I think that&#39;s a thank-you. I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;ll let you know when I catch up to my brain. It&#39;s been interesting running after it, at any rate).<br><br>And so, I present my request to you, Permission Givers (and everyone else, of course). It can all be found <a href="http://dawnfire360.livejournal.com/574.html">here</a>, and should conform to both logic (inasmuch as it applies) and to the Permission article on the wiki. Happy reading!<br><br>*goes away to find shiny objects instead of biting nails in nervousness and anticipation*<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Thanks! I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it :) I&#39;ll do my best to have it up at some point. If it takes too long, you have my permission to badger me about it--seriously, just say something like, &#39;What happened to that awesome fic you used a chapter of for the writing sample? You said you&#39;d post more of it!&#39; And I&#39;ll go, &#39;oh, right!&#39; and pay attention to it again. :D<br><br>Actually, fun fact--one of the things that prompted me to say hello on the Board was that I was working on that particular fic and wanted to ask if it was ok to mention the PPC in it and to write an outtake where PPC agents came in and fixed everything. It...snowballed. And now I&#39;m writing missions. Heaven help us.<br><br>I have started writing that outtake, though. It&#39;s very fun. Also hilarious. Also, Teresa and the M-Ses (as I call it for short) is one of my favorite stories to work on, mainly because it&#39;s a Mary-Sue parody featuring both OOC and IC characters and a lot of craziness. So it&#39;s quite likely that I may have some of it up within the next few months...<br><br>Again, thanks for the encouragement :)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Heh :) The first planned mission is technically a LotR one, but I&#39;ll take a look around for a Hunger Games badfic...although, actually, I&#39;d be better off doing that as a cowrite, seeing as I never read the third book and don&#39;t remember the second at all. In other words, I&#39;m probably not the right person to do a Hunger Games mission (at least not on my own), unless I find one, read it through, and realize that I actually can find enough charges.<br><br>...then again, I--well, first of all, looks like you get the <s>blame</s>credit for asking me if I wanted to write missions back in January, because that&#39;s what started this. (All who-knows-how-many pages of it. I&#39;m not sure I even want to know anymore. Suffice it to say, I&#39;m probably pretty close to winning NaNoWriMo by now--or I would if it was currently going on). Anyway, I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m grateful :P<br><br>Anyway, as I was saying before I got sidetracked: I read your new writing sample, and it&#39;s absolutely hilarious (although you may want to fix the typo of &#39;Daisies&#39; in the title. On the other hand, that&#39;s the only typo I found). I very much enjoyed it, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be getting Permission too any day now. Any minute now, actually :) It&#39;s that good. You tell a great story, and your characters are quite vivid. In other words, I like it.<br><br>Now, what point was I trying to make with that? Hm...I may have been positing a co-write for a Hunger Games mission. No idea.<br><br>Well, good luck, and thanks for the congratulations! Join the celebrations, and may the odds be ever in your--what?<br><br>(Brenda stares)<br><br>No, really, what?<br><br>(more staring; now Charlie&#39;s joined in. She looks rather confused)<br><br>Oh, come on, Agent Dawn is based on me. Are you really that surprised?<br><br>Brenda: Who&#39;s Agent Dawn?<br><br>...oh, right. You haven&#39;t met her yet. Oops.<br><br>Charlie: Wait, is she the one taking care of my minis--?<br><br>Aand, on that note, time to end this! Actually, let&#39;s end it on this very exciting (to me, anyway) note:<br><br>I have Permission! Let the insanity begin! Mwahahaha--right. :D<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Oh, man, I forgot about that question. Turns out I did do something good to the community! :D I&#39;m glad my simple little question managed to kick you over into starting to write mission ideas and agents, because these look like interesting ones.<br><br>Aw man, a LotR badfic? Don&#39;t we have, like, 136 missions in that continuum already? Why has it not snapped under the pressure yet? Or, more importantly, why didn&#39;t the suethors give up on it once they realized it was so heavily defended by the PPC? Wasn&#39;t the point of the OFUM to make sure this stuff never happens again?<br>(Sheesh, Miss Cam must be slacking off hard down in the OFUM for this much badfic to still be produced.)<br>*The entirety of the PPC glares down on Jumper and, by extension, me*<br>...Oh my...<br>(...um. I&#39;m sorry?)<br><br>Nah, I kid, whatever you want to kill first is fine. LotR was what inspired this whole community, and so continuing to defend it is almost a requirement. At some point, I&#39;m going to have to find a bad LotR and MLP crossover fic for Marvin and Printworthy to &#39;fix,&#39; just to continue the tradition. Actually, after I wrap up a couple of missions with Marvin and Printworthy, I would be happy to do a co-write with you. Be it Hunger Games, Percy Jackson, whatever, I&#39;m game. I think Jumper will be game too.<br>(Wait... Does this mean...?)<br>Yes Jumper, soon, you too will become an agent.<br>(WOO HOO!)<br><br>So, you like the meeting of the agents? I&#39;m glad you like it, and I will be sure to fix the typo in just a moment. Thanks for catching those little errors, I appreciate it. Just because I am curious, what did you like the most about it? I like to make sure I know what I did right so I never do it again. Nah, I kid, it&#39;s because I like input on what people find enjoyable and/or funny.<br><s>(And because he has a massive ego.)</s><br><br>Now, where was I...

            <p>Wow, that&#39;s a nice compliment! Thanks :) Also, there are...three or four more agents who will join Brenda and Charlie (in being written about, anyway) after a few missions, unless they manage to sneak in cameos beforehand. Which is what I mean by saying that the original idea has snowballed <i>so much</i>. But yes, you got my brain to start wondering about possible agents, and then to start creating them, and then...well, it got complex. I started with Brenda and Charlie, only Charlie was out on her first mission with a DIC agent for a temporary partner, but then I started wondering who the Disentangler&#39;s partner was, and then somehow Agent Dawn got created...I don&#39;t even know. But it&#39;s been snowballing since January 13th. We&#39;ll go with thanks, and a hope that the agents and missions live up to looking interesting...<br><br>Well, yes, but it&#39;s a good continuum :) Also, as a Tolkien fan who would also like to pay tribute, in a sense, to the Original Series, I kind of have to write at least one LotR mission. Not to mention that it&#39;s (horrifically) easy to find mission-worthy badfic there. (Did you know, I went looking for Good Omens badfic on FFN and found out that all but about three of the fanfics on the first few pages were decidedly goodfic? It was quite fun, and heartening, but means that I&#39;m going to have to look elsewhere for a GO mission. Oh, well. I&#39;ll try AO3 next.) As for the Suethors, they probably haven&#39;t given up because the characters are so pretty and Tolkien put so much wonderful detail and depth into his world that it&#39;s hard not to want to be part of it, even if it does come out as a Suefic (and, remember, most people who write Suefics--accidentally, at least--either know about Sues but don&#39;t realize what they&#39;ve done, or just don&#39;t know enough about good writing yet and are still learning. Some don&#39;t care anyway. And yes, the first of those options is what happened to me in the HP continuum. Fortunately, I never posted the fic anywhere, and I&#39;ve only ever discovered the one. It&#39;ll be PPC&#39;d at some point).<br><br>That sounds like fun! Have you seen the video Hermione posted? Check it out if you haven&#39;t, you&#39;ll probably enjoy it. I don&#39;t even watch MLP, and I enjoyed it (although I&#39;m sure I missed half of the jokes). Ooh, co-write! Actually, I&#39;d also like to, well, to quote you, &#39;wrap up a few missions&#39; first. I&#39;m definitely game, for any fandom that I know even moderately well (so Hunger Games and Percy Jackson are both potential options). Yay, Jumper! Maybe we should do a co-write with Jumper and Dawn? It&#39;ll be insane, but...could be hilarious :) Ah well, we&#39;ll decide when the time comes.<br><br>Yes, I do! It was very funny. I did think a little of Printworthy&#39;s dialogue was a little stilted (if you want critique), but then again, I don&#39;t really know how ponies talk, so it might not be an issue. Also, you&#39;re welcome; I&#39;ve been editing for long enough that it tends to become a bit of a habit. Er, does that make sense? Anyway...let&#39;s see. What did I like the most about it? Probably Marvin&#39;s inner dialogue, Printworthy&#39;s outrage at the Glitter Dos and  his reaction to realizing he&#39;s a fictional character, Marvin and Printworthy&#39;s meeting, and Marvin&#39;s cunning plan to get assigned to the APD. Basically, pretty much everything, but those bits in particular. If you wanted me to quote my favorite parts, you&#39;d probably end up with about 3/4 of what you&#39;ve written being quoted. As they say, you&#39;re a shoe-in for Permission.<br><br>CONFETTI! IT&#39;S A<s>NOTHER</s> PARADE!<br><br>Sorry about that, but you&#39;re dealing with a Supernatural fan. I&#39;d probably be a Misha&#39;s Minion if I had Twitter, honestly. And if you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, don&#39;t worry, just know that Misha Collins is an actor who once, in an outtake, said the words, &quot;Confetti, it&#39;s a parade!&quot; and started a fandom quote.

            <p>So, today I realised something.  I&#39;ve rarely been an active part of a fandom (aside from a brief stint of writing Pokemon fanfic that will <i>never be mentioned again</i>)(seriously don&#39;t mention it).  I have, however, done a great deal of lurking.  One thing I&#39;ve noticed while lurking is that there often seems to be a trend towards certain things in a fandom.  So, what I&#39;m curious about is this:<br><br>What fandoms are you a part of that have (relatively) strict rules regarding various things?<br><br>And by various, I mean <i>anything</i>.  I&#39;m really curious about this.<br><br>For example, there is the (not so) unspoken rule with John Dies at the End that, no matter what, you <i>never</i> spoil the ending.  Ever.  Don&#39;t do it.<br><br>Another example is revealing Aikawa&#39;s sex in a Prunus Girl fic (something that&#39;s never outright said in the manga).  It&#39;s just not something that happens.<br><br>In short, what rules are there in your fandoms?  What elements of canon don&#39;t get touched at all?  What things (if any) are <i>always</i> different from canon?  Is there something that, while never actually mentioned in canon, is a constant in fanfic?</p>

            <p>It&#39;s such a huge fandom that anything you think is universal will have people against it. With five series and ten movies, odds are you&#39;ll find people who hate or love any number of them. Semi-universal, though:<br>-(The Original Series) Kirk and Spock. Whether you slash or not, you still probably believe that their friendship is sacred. To some extent, the friendship of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy is regarded the same way, but since there aren&#39;t as many people who support a threesome it doesn&#39;t have quite the support of Kirk and Spock.<br>- (Voyager) Janeway/Chakotay over canonical Chakotay/Seven. There re some C/7 shippers, but they are in the minority. <i>Very</i> much so.<br>- (Voyager) &quot;Threshold&quot; isn&#39;t canon. Even the writers say so. Can&#39;t blame them - what show wants an episode where two of the main characters superevolve into mutant lizards and have mutant alien lizard babies?<br>- (The Next Generation) **SPOILER ALERT** Much of the fanbase (not all but a significant enough portion to put here) believes that Data didn&#39;t die in Star Trek: Nemesis. To be fair, there are a lot of hints of his return, and maybe he would have if Nemesis hadn&#39;t been a box office flop and therefore closed the door on Star Trek movies until the 2009 reboot. (Strangely enough, Data&#39;s death may have caused the movie to flop, seeing as he&#39;s a fan favorite.) Fanfiction abounds explaining his return or simply ignoring the issue. I myself have written a fic doing the former.<br>- (Voyager) A vast majority of fans agree that the last episode of Voyager didn&#39;t resolve everything, or at least, that there is potential for stories after it, to the point where seeing fanfiction tagged &quot;Post Endgame&quot; is like finding a Suefic in the LOTR archive. <br><br>You probably didn&#39;t read much of that unless you know Trek, but yeah, that&#39;s what I can think of. I think the reason Voyager has so much is because while it was excellent, it was plothole-ish, leading the fans to fill the plotholes.<br><br>(end Trek gush)</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve never encountered things like that before, but then I try to distance myself from anyone who might screech about broken rules of fandom. There is a difference between politely asking for someone farther along in the story than you not to spoil the parts you don&#39;t know and shrieking &quot;DON&#39;T SPOIL ANYTHING THERE MIGHT BE PEOPLE WHO DON&#39;T KNOW ABOUT THIS YET&quot; every time others try to discuss something like civilized human beings, so I generally run with people of the same fandom who will stick a NORMAL spoiler warning (as opposed to !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERSOMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) on posts with spoilers, but leave it at that. The same rule applies with other fandom rules.<br><br>I dunno, I don&#39;t do well with people becoming rabid over fictional stories/video games/etc. It doesn&#39;t make much sense to me unless the canon in question is being mangled rather than speculated upon or added to in an affectionate manner - and even then, a whisper can go much farther than a banshee wail.<br><br>That said, there&#39;s a growing group of Wrathion/Anduin shippers in the World of Warcraft fandom, and with it is an equally growing group of &quot;EW OMG WHY&quot; anti-shippers. It&#39;s kind of amusing to watch the rampaging ship wars, but I&#39;m staying out of it.</p>

            <p>...Is that the suspense leading up to the ending is absolutely amazing, and it really takes a lot away from a person&#39;s enjoyment of the book if it&#39;s spoiled beforehand.  Plot details are fine to mention, but you never spoil the ending.  Heck, &quot;Whatever you do, don&#39;t spoil the ending!&quot; is the second-last line in the movie trailer.

            <p>Like it says in the subject line, I&#39;ve finally finished preparing my Permission Request, and would like someone to look it over for me. Anyone is welcome, although if someone who knows LotR/Silm could take a look at the writing sample, that would be great--just to make sure everyone&#39;s more or less IC, and so on.<br><br>Basically, for anyone wonderful enough to consent to beta, I&#39;d like you to read through the request and let me know if you spot anything that really doesn&#39;t work or isn&#39;t understandable (or any bad SPaG, which shouldn&#39;t be there. If I&#39;ve missed something, let me know, and it&#39;ll go away). For the writing sample, also please let me know if you can follow what&#39;s going on--it&#39;s one chapter from an ongoing story, and I need to know if the context-providing note works well enough :)<br><br>The request can be found <a href="http://dawnfire360.livejournal.com/574.html">here</a>.<br><br>And...that&#39;s it.

            <p>...I do want it to sounds logical. I didn&#39;t know about the DIA (I mean, I vaguely knew they existed, but I didn&#39;t really know anything more than that), so I managed to ignore something that other people know about and think should be there. I&#39;m honestly still catching up on the PPC of today; I think I&#39;ve done a pretty good job so far (read a LOT of wiki articles, and a similar number of spin-offs), but there are still some details that I don&#39;t know about. So, if you tell me that it seems strange that the DIA wasn&#39;t sent in instead of Brenda, then that&#39;s something I feel I should take into account, especially as I doubt you&#39;re the only one who&#39;s going to catch that.<br><br>Also, Brenda getting bored and impatient actually seems rather stronger to me. It suits her character perfectly. It just means I need to slightly adjust what actually happens when she gets inside the badfic, but that&#39;s not too hard to do. So thanks :) This is why I like (and use) betas; they tend to catch things that, when fixed or changed, actually make the story better.<br><br>And you were completely right about the spacing, by the way. It was squished and made the story harder to follow. I&#39;ve now changed it.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I think I&#39;ll just relate my experience to you, as I had it with a very similar situation that occurred to me.<br><br>I was actually going to spork a Mass Effect fanfic that had a Gary Stu and a REALLY bad Mary Sue (they had managed to impress Aria for doing nothing, a batarian took them in because the plot demanded it, and the Sue had a pair of holographic roller skates *shudder*). But she actually expressed interest in rewriting it, and when I went in to review it she actually took my criticisms to heart when she rewrote it. (And trust me, when she did rewrite it, the end result was <i>much</i> improved over the original version.)<br><br>So what I&#39;d do is this: I&#39;d review it, and then ask about that in a PM depending on how the author responds to the points you bring up in your review.<br><br>Those are my two cents on it, anyway.</p>

            <p>In PPC canon, a Sue who&#39;s too much of a Sue to recruit can only be saved by their author. The PPC agents can just kill the Sue, which removes her influence on the canon, but also removes any strengthening effect her fic might have had. If on the other hand the Author returns and fixes the problems, the fic can get flipped from bad to good, which is better than just killing the Sue. It&#39;s why fangirls get sent to OFUs and why so many PPC agents are OFU graduates. The power of writing new goodfic in a continuum is always more than just sporking the bad. (The missions strengthen the PPC home continuum, of course, but since it&#39;s semi-quarantined, that&#39;s not really very necessary.)</p>

            <p>That got posted too soon....<br><br>Anyway, as I was saying. You could get together with the author. You write your mission and the author re-writes the fic. Then somewhere near the end of your mission, you write the author&#39;s rewriting into your mission--the horribleness gets erased, the Sues and bits turn into real people, and the CADs stop screeching. Maybe the author appears in the fic itself as an author avatar physically destroying some crucial problem, or maybe s/he is just an unseen force that changes the landscape like you see at the ends of stories where the true king returns and the land becomes beautiful again.<br><br>It&#39;d be a unique approach. If the author is good with SPAG despite the Sueish nature of the fic, maybe you could even swap beta services. Goodness knows we can all use a second set of eyes to root out the typos.</p>

Well, since I haven&#39;t read those (or don&#39;t remember), my take on it ought to be different.<br><br>Well, my plan is to have the agents finish charging the Sue, and then the CAD beeps and, when they look, it registers her as an OC.

            <p>To ask for help, too. I&#39;ve <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BMQAfNskqC_f_v19MvX7o7pdr8vGLesEHCXGVLYdxQQ/edit">this</a> half-finished mission (which sporks a classic <i>Lord of the Rings</i> Sue) that I haven&#39;t touched for a month. I&#39;m thinking that I might have wrote copious amounts of nonsense there, so I&#39;d very much like people to go over it and tell me what they think.</p>

            <p>Actually, I started doing that yesterday and got sidetracked. Sorry about that.<br><br>From what I see, you&#39;ve got some great lines (such as the line about &#39;Glorfindel Golden-hair&#39;, and bit about the spears). It&#39;s a bit unclear what the mini-Balrog mentioned just after the first strike of ellipsis abuse came from, as its name isn&#39;t mentioned (unless it&#39;s &#39;elf&#39;?)<br><br>WHAT?! Yeah, I&#39;m with Anebrin on that one. Seriously? That&#39;s who the baby is? Yeesh. Charge for making him doubly an orphan?<br><br>Celery Girl :D I like it. Much better.<br><br>One thing--you&#39;ve written that Arwen &#39;lied down&#39;. I&#39;m pretty sure that should be &#39;lay down&#39;.<br><br>Lyrics. Argh. This is vaguely starting to remind me of &quot;A Kid in King Arthur&#39;s Court&quot;--or at least, the Nostalgia Critic&#39;s review of it. Ouch.<br><br>The <i>romance</i>. Gah. And the repeated use of eleven, too. Just...wow. Can&#39;t say I like the badfic at all, but you&#39;re doing a very good job of making fun of it, so well done. Quite enjoyable.<br><br>And if there&#39;s nonsense there, I don&#39;t think I saw it, although the comment about tossing a bucket of water on her is definitely a valid point.<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Also, giving advice yourself tells you if this author is going in the right direction. Also, you can ask for permission to spork it anyways. After all, they do realize the old version is bad.</p>

            <p>It just doesn&#39;t seem right to me to spork it if the author wants to improve it. There&#39;s a quote somewhere on the wiki which goes something like this: &quot;Writing fanfiction as good as canon or better is a bar which fanfiction writers will probably never reach. We don&#39;t look for fanfiction to mock near the bar. We look below that bar, and below that one, to the mat under the bar, and peel that back to boggle at the crud underneath it.&quot; (I&#39;m paraphrasing here) The point is, if they&#39;re trying, it seems heartless to kill it.<br>Then again, I have a lot of standards for fics I want to spork. I once found a fic where the Sue&#39;s eyes were described as &quot;like ice and fire melting together&quot;. But I&#39;m not sporking it because the author&#39;s grandmother is dying of cancer and writing this Suefic is helping the author get through this difficult time. Not quite the aame, but still. It doesn&#39;t feel right, and  can&#39;t give any more reason than that.</p>

            <p>Well, maybe you could make a mention of the author&#39;s (hopeful) turn towards goodfic in-mission? Maybe the canon stops being warped as much in places, and the agents can make a note of that?</p>
