            <p>Following in the footsteps of the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=215096">first</a> and <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=216383">second</a> iterations, this is the third Monthly<s>ish</s> PPC Writing Challenge. As I wrote for the first version:<br><br><i>Here at the PPC we&#39;re very big on writing. We write missions, we rant about the bad writing in badfics, we even play games like Fill The Plothole, which consist of, yep, writing. But at no point do we all sit down and try to improve our writing together.<br><br>So. The objective of the Monthly PPC Writing Challenge is to write a short story to a set theme, and then give useful, constructive criticism to other participants.</i><br><br>Here are The Rules:<br><br>-Write a (reasonably short) story in response to the Theme below, and post it on this thread. You may use a beta if you wish, but it is not required.<br>-Give constructive criticism (at least one positive point, at least one negative with suggestions for improvement) to at least one other submission.<br>-You may rewrite your story based on concrit you receive and repost it, but this is not required.<br>-Obvious fact, but no flaming! This isn&#39;t like the Badfic Contest - the goal here is to write a good story and get feedback from the community.<br>-You <b>do not</b> require Permission to participate in the Challenge. Neither do your agents need to be approved for you to use them.<br>-However, nothing written for the Challenge is considered part of the PPC Canon unless you do have Permission, and explicitly claim it as canon.<br><br>I think that covers it. Remember that both the writing and the giving of concrit are part of the challenge. (And no, there&#39;s no time limit - but there&#39;s not usually much point posting on a thread that&#39;s left the front page)<br><br>And this months Theme:<br><br><i>A character in the PPC hears a knock at their door. They have a visitor - but it&#39;s the last person they would have expected...</i><br><br>And remember... have fun!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hi.i dont know any ppc characters so im doing a self insert.<br>Kitty Edenwas at her desk, working. Her latest assignment was to sort out the Suvian Colors and find suitable real life matches. Not a pleasant job, especially at 2 in the morning. Well, it was her own fault for slacking off work. There was a rap at the foor. &quot;Come in,&quot; Kitty called, not bringing her eyes off her desk. It was probably just a Flower checking in on her. The door creaked open suprisingly dramatically, considering how run down it was. in swept the most handsome hunk of a boy kitty had ever seen. Kity opened her mouth to propose to the unofficial love of her life...<br>the boy slumped forwards with a delicate moan. Kitty covered her mouth in shock and horror. She rushed forwards to checkhis vitals. She recieved a slap in the face.<br>&quot;Thanks,&quot;she said, rubbing the slap mark. &quot;I needed that.&quot;<br>The agent who had slapped her sighed wearily. &quot;Yeah, one of the newbies went and got infected with Vambiolaria. Now we&#39;ve gotta go and exorcise him.&quot;<br>Kitty tried to stem her rapid heartbeat. &quot;I bet hes a real hunk when hes not like this.&quot;<br>The agent laughed sarcastically. &quot;He&#39;s the tp computer nerd for the unpopular group. And he has acne.&quot;<br>&quot;Typical.&quot;<br>Kitty sat down and started looking for the ever elusive &#39;Purite Bledangle&#39;. The othet agent hogtied the Marty-Stu an dragged him out of the room.<br>Just another day in the life of a PPC agent.<br>Dum de dum.</p>

            <p>...but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have time before this ends up on the next page. Are you planning to do another one, hS? Say...in 1-2 weeks or so? /hinthint/<br><br>Pfff, just thought of a dream sequence...which just stopped being a dream sequence. I think.<br><br>This is probably canon. It&#39;s set sometime after Charlie and Brenda figure out how to get along, assuming they ever do. The mission isn&#39;t a real fic, as far as I know.<br><br>--<br><br>Charlie Shoe sits alone in her RC. Suddenly, someone knocks on the door. She opens it, and, lo and behold...<br><br>&quot;Pippin!&quot; she gasps. The hobbit gives her an odd look; she takes it and hugs it to her happily. &quot;Wh-what are you doing here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not Pippin,&quot; the hobbit says. Now he&#39;s giving her a funny look, and Charlie tries to fight back giggles when she takes it. &quot;My name is Will. I work in the Cafeteria. Did you know the food there&#39;s disgusting? It&#39;s disgraceful! My friends and I are going to change that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You--you will?&quot; Charlie breathes. &quot;Oh, Pip--Will, you&#39;ll be the hero of the entire PPC!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course I will,&quot; says the hobbit, and suddenly becomes Will Turner, complete with a sudden puff of smoke. Charlie stares. &quot;Now all I need are some butterflies, an octopus, three jammy dodgers, and a squid...&quot;<br><br>And then he starts to become an elephant, and Charlie screams, and then--<br><br>&quot;Charlie! Charlie, wake up.&quot;<br><br>[BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!]<br><br>&quot;Shut up, you. Charlie, we&#39;ve got a mission. Wake up.&quot;<br><br>Charlie opens her eyes to the familiar ceiling of her RC, and turns her head to blink blearily over at Brenda Loringham. &quot;I just had the weirdest dream...&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s what happens when you nap between missions after eating Sue Souffle. Oh, yuck, this idiot thinks she&#39;s a unicorn. In PotC-verse. And she falls in love with...&quot; Brenda stops, blinking. &quot;What in the--the Black Pearl? This is a parody, right? Please tell me it&#39;s a parody.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Does she mess with Will?&quot; Charlie sits up, and tries to neaten her now-messy blonde hair.<br><br>Brenda hesitates. &quot;She...gores Elizabeth. Ouch. Does that count?&quot;<br><br>Charlie gets to her feet and starts reaching for weapons. &quot;She&#39;s dead.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, yeah, being gored by a unicorn generally--&quot;<br><br>&quot;So&#39;s the Sue.&quot;<br><br>Brenda grins. &quot;Now that&#39;s what I like to hear. I knew there was a reason I stopped complaining to the SO about you. And Charlie?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Put your shirt back on. And take the pink ribbons out of your hair.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes sir&#39;m,&quot; Charlie mumbles, and obeys.</p>

            <p>So, apologies if my criticims is wrong.<br><br>Negative: You did not expand on PPC world after the beep, and you did not explain some abbreviation. What&#39;s RC, anyway?. But I&#39;m nitpicking here, and since this is a short story, not very big complaints.<br><br>Positive: You manage to leave enough questions in your story to make me want to know more about the mission.<br><br>Well, I did my requirement, now to consider writing a new submission.</p>

            <p>&quot;Oh, a question, I guess I&#39;ll reply to that - but wait, then she&#39;ll expect me to concrit as well - I guess I <i>have</i> to now...&quot;<br><br>Anyway, yes, there will be another, although I&#39;m not sure when. Actually-monthly might be a bit of overload... we&#39;ll see.<br><br>~<br><br>Your dream sequence was, er, extremely surreal, which I imagine was the point. So you achieved that very well. Charlie&#39;s taking of looks was pretty amusing, too.<br><br>In the non-dream section, I think you&#39;ve got the agent-agent interaction pinned down: the &#39;Well, yeah, being gored by a unicorn generally--&#39; exchange worked particularly well, I think.<br><br>I&#39;m not sold on the third-person present tense. I think present tense works well for first and second person, and for &#39;pseudo-second person&#39; - ie, things like <a href="http://ofudisc.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/ofu-squared-welcome.html">this</a>, where there&#39;s an unspoken &#39;You sit down and watch the following&#39;. I think it also worked well for the dream section - it gave a sense of surreal immediacy to it. But I don&#39;t think it works all that well for the &#39;real&#39; portion. Not entirely sure why, though.<br><br>You also filled the dream section with the word &#39;will&#39;, and I&#39;m not sure how intentional it was.<br><br><i>&quot;My name is <b>Will</b>. [...]&quot;<br><br>&quot;You--you <b>will</b>?&quot; Charlie breathes. &quot;Oh, Pip--<b>Will</b>, you&#39;ll be the hero of the entire PPC!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course I <b>will</b>,&quot; says the hobbit, and suddenly becomes <b>Will</b> Turner...</i><br><br>That&#39;s five in three paragraphs. Now, I think that could be used to heighten the surrealism - &#39;Of course I will - I <i>am</i> Will&#39; - but it reads more like an accident here. I&#39;d actually be really interested to see you take it overboard and create a couple of paragraphs full of Will (the name), Will (Turner, the character), will (the future tense word), will (strength of mind), a will (the legal document), to will (to wish something into happening), to will (to leave something in a will), and any other meanings you can think of, woven into something that makes sense, and can be understood on a reasonably casual readthrough, but is still disorienting.<br><br><i>&quot;Of course I will,&quot; said Will. &quot;I will, because I will it so - and my will is strong, and I <i>will</i> will a will into existence - and in that will, I will will to Will the will to do this thing!&quot;</i><br><br>... I think I just made myself dizzy.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>[A character in the PPC hears a knock at their door. They have a visitor - but it&#39;s the last person they would have expected...]<br><br>&quot;Sir Sharpsi, a bit higher, yes, yes, perfect! Ushdag, the spider silk and the cotton should not be on the same shelf! Put them on different shelves! Astaghfirullah, Bilza, why haven&#39;t you finished folding? I knew I should have these done back at the factory!&quot;<br><br>Dark Lord Aakmal is looking rather undark with his anxiety and fear of possible embarassment at his first shop. He had always walked from door to door, trying to sell the silk to unsuspecting housewives and hooby tailors. But for the first time, he has his own, legal, unsuspicious shop. And oh my, it is in the PPC universe! Well, if the other universe is where his rezeki is, so be it. At least he didn&#39;t have to face questioning by the police for employing gorilla lookalikes.<br><br>Suddenly, they heard a knock in the door.<br><br>&quot;Have we installed the doorbell yet?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, My Lord, you did it yesterday.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I must&#39;ve connected them poorly. Let me see who&#39;s there.&quot;<br><br>Dark Lord Aakmal quickly runs to the door, unlocking the lines of locks and keypads the Orcs had installed. Aakmal makes a mental note to remove most of the locks later. And encase the holes left with cement. Or mithril, if he knows where to get some.<br><br>&quot;Oh, do they have so many precious things to hide here? I thought the cave&#39;s where all the preciouses go.&quot;<br><br>After fumbling at the door for a few minutes, Aakmal quickly opened the door, giving a most sincere smile to... and he lost the smile almost immediately.<br><br>&quot;Hello, I heard there&#39;s a new shop here. I hope to be the first to visit it. Are you Mr. Aakmal?&quot;<br><br>Agent Dafydd. Also known as Maglor, son of Feanor, the participant of The Oath, second in wrath and skill to Maedhros himself. Excellent singer too. Or so what his orcs told him.<br><br>&quot;Yes, yes, I am. A moment please, Sir.&quot;<br><br>Aakmal immediately locks as many locks on the door as fast as he can, walks away from the door, and then shouts as loud as he can.<br><br>&quot;ANAK FEANOR!!!&quot; Child of Feanor. <br><br>All orcs gets the cue, and hides themselves wherever they could. In the shelf, covered with silk, in the baskets, covering their bodies slightly, even a few that stood in artistic poses, covering themselves in cloth, to give the impression that they are exotic statues from somewhere.<br><br>After ensuring everyone is hidden, Aakmal unlocks and opens the door.<br><br>&quot;Come in. We, I mean, I, am honoured to receive you. Agent Dafydd, yes? I heard a lot about you.&quot; Aakmal says nervously as he extends his right hand to be shaked.<br><br>Agent Dafydd smiled as he extends his left hand. Aakmal quickly reaches with his left hand and they shake hands together.<br><br>&quot;You must have fever. The shop&#39;s cool, yet your hand is sweaty.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sorry, sir. Been nervous, first time open shop.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Watch your grammar, my good man. PPC doesn&#39;t take kindly to grammar mistakes. It causes much ruin, and are the Suethors&#39; greatest weapon.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you for the advice, sir.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can I look around?&quot;<br><br>Aakmal thought for a second, then nodded, &quot;Yes, sure.&quot;<br><br>Agent Dafydd looked into every cloth and apparel on sale at the shop. The gambesons, the silk shirts, the cotton, and even some cheap jeans Aakmal had brought from a cheap dealer.<br><br>&quot;Your silk, Mr. Aakmal, is quite soft, and nice to look at too. Can I rip a sample?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh yes, Let me bring it for you.&quot;<br><br>Aakmal quickly gets a small silk handkerchief. Ushdag&#39;s head is exposed by Aakmal&#39;s action. Aakmal quickly covered her head with another pile of unfolded clothes.<br><br>Agent Dafydd takes the handkercief, hold one side of the handkercief with his foot, and tries to rip it off with his hand. After a few seconds, he gives up.<br><br>&quot;Very strong. It must be Shelob&#39;s spawn that give you this.&quot;<br><br>Aakmal can feel his trousers being very wet. A few seconds later, it is. Agent Dafydd laughs.<br><br>&quot;Ahaha, Hah, HAHAHAHAHAH! Oh god, you peed in your pants! But no, I&#39;m not here to kill any orcs today. Why not call your workers out? I assure you, I mean them no harm.&quot;<br><br>Aakmal, looking rather stiff with fear, lifts his hand and motions all the orcs to come out. Everyone uncovered themselves, and slowly walked to Aakmal, then stands silently.<br><br>&quot;Thirty of you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We have others at our hiding place.&quot; Answered Gul Sharpsi. Aakmal is about to retort, but Gul Sharpsi holds Aakmal&#39;s shoulder, calming him.<br><br>&quot;Well, as I said, I mean no harm to all you, including you, Dark Lord Aakmal.&quot;<br><br>Aakmal shoots an alarmed look.<br><br>&quot;Oh come on, everyone talks about a new shop, opened by a Dark Lord. Of course I know you&#39;ll be the Dark Lord. Dark Lord Aakmal and Orcs&#39; Amateur Boutique and Armourer, all the pamphlets go. Seems like you put Orcs and Spawn of Ungoliant to good use. All Elves would be applauding you, for doing the impossible, at least.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Orcs learnt to be good themselves, I only act as their connection to the wider world, Agent Dafydd.&quot;<br><br>The rest of the Orcs nodded in unison.<br><br>&quot;Oh, drop the Agent title. It&#39;s Mr. Illian now. Well then, can I have a purchase?&quot;<br><br>Aakmal quickly snapped himself out of his own trance. He clapped his hands, and every Orc runs to their respective stations. Aakmal is about to go to the cashier, but Gul Sharpsi stopped him.<br><br>&quot;My Lord, perhaps it&#39;s well that you take a day off. Clean yourself off.  And Mr. Illian, come, let us see what you&#39;d like to buy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, I think I should.&quot; Aakmal walks to the toilet for a quick shower.<br><br>[Well, how does it go?]</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t remember doing that. Did I do that?<br><br><i>No, Dafydd. It&#39;s just a story. Remember? You </i>did<i> read the rules...</i><br><br>Rules? Rules are for the... er... yes, all right. So it didn&#39;t actually happen, even though it says it did?<br><br><i>That&#39;s right. I know it&#39;s one of the tricky ones, but try to get your head round it</i><br><br>... I&#39;d complain that you&#39;re embarassing me, Connie, but I sort of walked into it, didn&#39;t I?<br><br><i>Yes, dear, you did. Now, are you leaving a review, or what?</i><br><br>Oh. Right. That. Ahem:<br><br>I definitely liked the idea behind this story. Obviously in the real wo- sorry, in Arda, the idea of shopkeeping orcs is ludicrous, but this is the PPC; you can recruit anything you can find, and you can find anything in badfic. And it is a hilarious notion - as is the idea of Ungoliant&#39;s children acting as weavers.<br><br>(Although, as an aside, I don&#39;t think you should mention that to the Doriathrim. They tend to be very wary of spiders in general, and given the place weaving holds in their hearts...)<br><br><i>Dafydd. It&#39;s a story.</i><br><br>Sorry. (Also don&#39;t tell Vairл unless you&#39;re tired of life)<br><br><i>Get on with it, or when we get home I&#39;ll-</i><br><br>Um, anyway, so I also thought you had excellent pacing. My appearance at the door was well-written, and the general flow of the story was good. Things were revealed just when you planned them to be, but with subtle lead-up that made it work very well.<br><br>Ironically, given &#39;my&#39; comment on arriving in the shop, I do have to highlight your grammar. You slip between the past and present tenses at random, and your punctuation sometimes gets away from you - <i>...at our hiding place.&quot; Answered...</i> should be <i>...at our hiding place,&quot; answered...</i><br><br>Your overall word-choice is also somewhat strange; not exactly wrong most of the time, but you definitely remind me of one of those agents who hasn&#39;t quite learnt English. I suppose that may be inevitable with one who used to speak only the Black Speech, but it&#39;s-<br><br><i>Dafydd? It&#39;s a STORY. They don&#39;t have the Black Speech in the real world. He probably speaks Spanish or something.</i><br><br>Well, my point about the word choice still stands, even if my wife nitpicks everything I say.<br><br><i>Not everyth- oh, a pox on you.</i><br><br>The story in general reminded me of the short fiction we used to see on the network by the PPC General Story owner - Leto Haven, that was his name. So (yes, Connie, I <i>know</i> it&#39;s a story, but) it seems appropriate that it crops up again in another shopkeeper. Of course, someone once told me he was dyslexic, so it probably isn&#39;t the same issue, but in general terms.<br><br>That aside, I thought you had me characterised very well. You remembered about my hand (it&#39;s amazing how easy it is to forget), and most of my lines sound, well, pretty much like me. The one I object to is my explosive reaction to the Dark One&#39;s accident. I&#39;d be far more likely to greet the sight with a raised eyebrow and a smirk, but not actually comment on it. Still and all, though, for someone I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve met, a good job.<br><br><i>Of course you haven&#39;t met him, it&#39;s a story and he&#39;s not in the PPC, so... oh, I give up. See you at home, don&#39;t stay out too long.</i><br><br>As if I would. I&#39;m done here, anyway. Thank you, &#39;real&#39; writer person, for an entertaining read.<br><br>&gt;Dafydd Illian<br><br>Wait, does this mean I have to write a story now? It <i>is</i> in the rules...<br><br><i>Only if you desperately want to. But you can do it at home.</i><br><br>Yes, dear...</p>

            <p>&quot;Sir Sharpsi, a bit higher, yes, yes, perfect! Ushdag, the spider silk and the cotton should not be on the same shelf! Put them on different shelves! Astaghfirullah, Bilza, why haven&#39;t you finish folding yet? I know I should have these done back at the factory!&quot;<br><br>Dark Lord Aakmal is looking rather undark with his anxiety and fear of possible embarassment at his first shop. Once upon a time, he had always walked from door to door, trying to sell the silk to unsuspecting housewives and hobby tailors. But for the first time, he have his own, legal, unsuspicious shop. And oh my, it is in the PPC universe! Well, if the other universe is where his providence is, so be it. At least he don&#39;t have to face questioning by the police for employing gorilla lookalikes.<br><br>Suddenly, they hear a knock in the door.<br><br>&quot;Have we installed the doorbell yet?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, My Lord, you did it yesterday.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I must&#39;ve connected them wrongly. Let me see who&#39;s there.&quot;<br><br>Dark Lord Aakmal quickly runs to the door, unlocking the lines of locks and keypads the Orcs installed. Aakmal makes a mental note to remove most of the locks later. And encase the holes left with cement. Or mithril, if he knows where to get some.<br><br>&quot;Oh, do they have so many precious things to hide here? I thought the cave&#39;s where all the treasures go.&quot;<br><br>After fumbling at the door for a few minutes, Aakmal quickly opens the door, giving a most sincere smile to... and he lose the smile almost immediately.<br><br>&quot;Hello, I hear there&#39;s a new shop here. I hope to be the first to visit it. Are you Mr. Aakmal?&quot;<br><br>Agent Dafydd. Also known as Maglor, son of Feanor, the participant of The Oath, second in wrath and skill to Maedhros himself. Excellent singer too. Or so what his orcs had told him.<br><br>&quot;Yes, yes, I am. A moment please, Sir.&quot;<br><br>Aakmal immediately locks as many locks on the door as fast as he can, walks away from the door, and then shouts as loud as he can.<br><br>&quot;ANAK FEANOR!!!&quot; Child of Feanor. <br><br>All orcs gets the cue, and hides themselves wherever they could. In the shelf, covering themselves with piles of shirts, in the baskets, covering their bodies slightly, even a few that stands in artistic poses, covering themselves in cloth, to give the impression that they are exotic statues from somewhere.<br><br>After ensuring everyone is hiding, Aakmal unlocks and opens the door.<br><br>&quot;Come in. We, I mean, I, am honoured to receive you. Agent Dafydd, yes? I have heard a lot about you,&quot; Aakmal says nervously as he extends his right hand to be shaken in greeting.<br><br>Agent Dafydd smiled as he extends his left hand. Aakmal quickly reaches with his left hand and they shake hands together.<br><br>&quot;You must have a fever. The shop&#39;s cool, yet your hand is sweaty.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sorry, sir. Been nervous, first time open shop.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Watch your grammar, my good man. PPC doesn&#39;t take kindly to grammar mistakes. It causes much ruin, and are the Suethors&#39; greatest weapon.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you for the advice, sir.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can I look around?&quot;<br><br>Aakmal thinks for a second, then nodded, &quot;Yes, sure.&quot;<br><br>Agent Dafydd looked into every cloth and apparel on sale at the shop. The gambesons, the silk shirts, the cotton, and even some cheap jeans Aakmal have bought from a cheap dealer.<br><br>&quot;Your silk, Mr. Aakmal, is quite soft, and nice to look at too. Can I rip a sample?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh yes, Let me bring it for you.&quot;<br><br>Aakmal quickly gets a small silk handkerchief, exposing Ushdag&#39;s head. Aakmal quickly covers her head with another pile of unfolded clothes.<br><br>Agent Dafydd takes the handkercief, steps on one side of the handkercief with his foot, and tries to rip it off with his hand. After a few seconds, he gives up.<br><br>&quot;Very strong. It must be Shelob&#39;s spawn that give you this.&quot;<br><br>Aakmal can feel his trousers being very wet. A few seconds later, it is. Agent Dafydd smirks. He throws the handkerchief towards Aakmal, and he wipes off his urine on his trousers. Then he throws the handkerchief into the dustbin.<br><br>&quot;Mr. Aakmal, why are you peeing in your pants?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I, I,&quot; Aakmal is weighing whether he should tell him or not, then continues, &quot;Am afraid.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of what, Mr. Aakmal?&quot;, says Agent Dafydd as he continues to browse through the store.<br><br>&quot;Actually, I am the leader of a few orcs. We open this shop to sell our products.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, I see,<br><br>Aakmal gulps on air before pressing his question.<br><br>&quot;Are, are you going to kill us?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am here for a visit, not to kill any orcs. Why not call your workers out? I assure you, I mean them no harm.&quot;<br><br>Aakmal, looking rather stiff with fear, lifts his hand and motions all the orcs to come out. Everyone uncovers themselves, and slowly walks to Aakmal, then stands silently.<br><br>&quot;Thirty of you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We have others at our hiding place,&quot; answers Gul Sharpsi. Aakmal is about to retort, but Gul Sharpsi holds Aakmal&#39;s shoulder, calming him.<br><br>&quot;Well, as I said, I mean no harm to all you, including you, Dark Lord Aakmal.&quot;<br><br>Aakmal shoots an alarmed look.<br><br>&quot;Oh come on, everyone talks about a new shop, opened by a Dark Lord. Of course I know you&#39;ll be the Dark Lord. Dark Lord Aakmal and Orcs&#39; Amateur Boutique and Armourer, all the pamphlets go. Seems like you put Orcs and Spawn of Ungoliant to good use. All Elves wiil be applauding you, for doing the impossible, at least.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Orcs had learnt to be good themselves, I only act as their connection to the wider world, Agent Dafydd.&quot;<br><br>The rest of the Orcs nods in unison.<br><br>&quot;Oh, drop the Agent title. It&#39;s Mr. Illian now. Well then, can I have a purchase?&quot;<br><br>Aakmal quickly snapps himself out of his own trance. He claps his hands, and every Orc runs to their respective stations. Aakmal is about to go to the cashier, but Gul Sharpsi stops him.<br><br>&quot;My Lord, perhaps it&#39;s well that you take a day off. Clean yourself off. And Mr. Illian, come, let us see what you want like to buy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, I think I should.&quot; Aakmal walks to the toilet for a quick shower. <br></p>

            <p>Firstly, apologies for not notifying the world which Dark Lord Aakmal lives in. I, the narrator, places him in The-Real-World-As-The-Seventh-Age. It may be assumed as a subsidiary world I make of the Tolkienverse, where the ages had changed orcs, elves and other creatures. It may be considered separate, if only by time. There is also where my character gets his orcs, which are now in hiding, although in some places, they may go out and interact with humans safely.<br><br>If this world is risking Arda, I apologise beforehand.<br><br>And Ungoliant&#39;s spawn are not really the weavers. We just take the silk from their nets and cocoons. They are well-tamed by the orcs before I arrive. Also, the orcs already have their own weavery industry before they choose my character to be their Dark Lord.<br><br>Oh, I must speak about how orcs of the Seventh Age choose their own Dark Lords. Dark Lords of today are the far cry of the powerful Dark Lords of the First, Second, and Third Age. Dark Lords of the Seventh Age are merely humans serving as mediators between orc villages and to the wider world. <br><br>Orcs are most often in hiding, but they still need to eat. The best way to secure their livelihood is through trade, and my character&#39;s orcs have been weaving ever since time immemorial. As the Ages progresses, all non-human being have trouble to communicate with humans, thus the need to have a mediator for diplomacy and trade. Thus the requirement of a Dark Lord.<br><br>Dark Lords are recruited by allied orc village chieftains, who will find a young man or woman, who will be trained in the ways of the orcs. After the end of the training, the Dark Lord will swear an oath to care, represent, and help the orcs, while delaying the arrival of Morgoth Bauglir by his or her ability, then the orc chieftains will swear fealty to the Dark Lord. Thus, my character isn&#39;t the only Dark Lord. There are a few tens of other Dark Lords and Ladies in Sabah itself.<br><br>The Dark Lords have to sell the orcs&#39; produce and return the money earned to the treasury, where a committee will distribute the pay to each and every working orc family. The Dark Lord have no say in the distribution except as advisor, but the full power of the finance rests on the Orc chieftains themselves. Dark Lords also have to protect the secrecy of the orcs&#39; existence, while trying to establish connection with other Dark Ones. This is a hard task, especially as some orcs may be hostile to discovery.<br><br>And thanks for the grammar correction. I try to make my tense as consistent as possible, but I may slip off, especially when trying to refer to past events.<br><br>And English is my second language. I speak Malay firstly.</p>

            <p><i>This is canon, but won’t happen for a good while yet.  Thank you, hS, for picking a topic that allows me to be a tease.  Has not been beta’d.  Sorry, EF, more seriousness.</i><br><br>Vania jolted awake at a sudden sound, throwing her ponytail into her face as she lifted her head.<br><br>Through her obscuring hair and unfocused vision, she saw Sora floating face up with his eyes closed—the “Continue” screen of <i>Kingdom Hearts 3</i>.<br><br>Knocking again: the sound that had woken her up.  Two hard thuds.<br><br>Vania huffed a sigh and let her head her head fall back against the bleen-colored bean bag chair, flipping the ponytail back out of her face.<br><br>She addressed a muffled scuffling behind her.  “Doooooooc.  Would you please get the door when you’re already up?  I’m barely awake down here.”<br><br>The scuffling stopped.  The knock repeated.<br><br>“Doc?”  Vania tilted her head upwards to see the rest of RC251 upside-down.  She was completely alone—no partner and no minis.  “Uh.”<br><br>Maybe Doc was right about that bug problem.<br><br>A really noisy bug problem.<br><br>Another pair of firm thuds distracted Vania from her confusion.  “Coming!  I’m coming!”<br><br>“Me too!” shouted Luxury from somewhere nearby.<br><br>Vania wrestled her way out of the bean bag chair, spilling more stuffing out of the duct tape holding it together.  “If you’re a spam bot, you’re getting thwacked!” Vania warned as she stumbled to the door.  She opened it and started to say, “Can I help—” before stumbling back with open mouth and eyes.<br><br>“Hello, Vania Tolluk.”  The man wore a torn grey vest over a yellow t-shirt, and blue jeans dribbled with dark red splotches.  “I see you have a new partner, now.”<br><br>“Paul.”  Vania’s attention was drawn back to her former partner’s face, and the messy, slightly spiked bleach-white hair above it.  She remembered that Paul had done his hair that way to make it look more anime, and remembering that made her remember <i>everything how is he here what did I do get out GET OUT</i><br><br>“I see you remember, now.  No more excuses, no more avoidance.”<br><br>“Get out!” Vania yelled, her voice rising to a hysterical high pitch.  She tried to fling the door shut and back away.  The door, however, banged against think vines that were growing in the way, swinging back open, while Vania’s ankle caught on a tree root poking from the RC’s floor.  She landed on her back, staring up at Paul, blinking away the raindrops every time they fell too close to her eyes.<br><br><i>Eyes.</i>  Paul’s right eye was now all black pupil, while his left was an empty field of white.<br><br>“You’re not Paul!” Vania yelled.<br><br>“Paul is only a memory now,” said the something wearing Paul’s face.  “Thanks to you, Vania.”<br><br>“Noooo . . .” Vania moaned and spun around onto all fours, pulling herself away from “Paul,” clawing through video game cases and leaf litter that were wet from the increasingly heavy rain.  If she could just reach the console, beat the sound of footsteps following her, and make a portal . . . the console should have been this way, but all Vania could see was the storm-darkened jungle.<br><br>“What about Doc, Vania?”<br><br>“No!” she shouted, her voice scratchy from anger and screaming.  “Get out <i>get out GET OUT</i>!”  She flipped over and glared into “Paul’s” inhuman eyes with the animalistic fury in hers.  The blood drops were smearing down his jeans from the rain.  He leaned in close to her face, frowned, and asked, “Are you going to kill Doc, too?”<br><br>Vania gave one long shriek as answer, before closing her eyes tightly and pounding both fists against her forehead.  “GETOUTGETOUTGETOUTGETOUT—<br><br>“—Get out!” Vania yelled as she jolted awake.<br><br>Agent Doc froze with eyes wide at the RC door.  “Sorry, Vania.  I was trying to be quiet.”  He stepped in further and set a pile of books and pamphlets neatly on the floor in front of his bookshelf.  “I wanted to look up how to get rid of our bugs, but I used someone else’s RC so the portal wouldn’t wake you.”<br><br>Vania closed her eyes and listened to the minis begin to stir again after her outburst.  “No, you’re fine.  I just woke up from a bad dream.”<br><br>“Oh.  Well, I’m sorry about that.  Do you . . . want to talk about it?”<br><br>“Well,” Vania started, then furrowed her eyebrows.  She looked up at the ceiling for a few seconds, then shook her head hard.  “Apparently not.  I can’t remember it at all.”  She settled back into the bleen bean bag chair and looked at the TV screen.  She nudged the directional pad down twice, then selected, “Load Game.”</p>

            <p>That was... pretty scary, to understate things somewhat. The style reminds me somewhat of my own <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1ehKUPMIM23HraqZu8uV6kmdc5q4bKOAkuZXnHmHIASc">After Midnight</a> - the idea of a reasonably normal situation slowly dissolving into nightmare-madness. I don&#39;t know how well my version worked, but yours was <i>very</i> good. You hit the pacing very well, and I really liked the way you introduced the new elements. For instance:<br><br><i>She landed on her back, staring up at Paul, blinking away the raindrops every time they fell too close to her eyes.</i><br><br>You hadn&#39;t mentioned the raindrops before - but that&#39;s what makes it dreamlike. You have impossible things happen without anyone (ie, the narrator or Vania) commenting on them. It works particularly well here, because we don&#39;t (well, I don&#39;t) know anything about Paul - I just assumed vines was his thing, until it all got too surreal/scary even for that.<br><br>You also hit the description very well throughout - &#39;Paul&#39;s&#39; eyes in particular stood out to me.<br><br>There are a few things that bother me - but they are very minor things. You have a typo for the &#39;think vines&#39; (although that gives me delightful mental images), and I think you missed a great opportunity around &#39;bleen bag chair&#39;.<br><br>I&#39;m also a little puzzled by &#39;Vania tilted her head upwards to see the rest of RC251 upside-down&#39;. She was apparently looking at a TV(?) when she &#39;woke up&#39;, then leant back into the bleenbag chair... and then tilted her head upwards, and the RC was upside-down? I guess you&#39;re meaning for her to be practically horizontal on a bleenbag in the middle of the room, but that doesn&#39;t really come across.<br><br>I don&#39;t particularly the random Lux interjection. I know why you did it, and it&#39;s a moderately funny line - but it a) puts Lux into Vania&#39;s dream (now there&#39;s a terrifying thought), and b) breaks the flow completely. Also c) assumed audibility through walls, but that&#39;s neither here nor there.<br><br>I&#39;m also a little unsure what Vania&#39;s main emotion is during this scene. I mean, no, obviously it&#39;s terror - unless it&#39;s obviously guilt. I got that Vania (thinks she) killed Paul - but some things (<i>&#39;how is he here what did I do&#39;</i>) imply he was about as monstrous as this version, and therefore probably deserved it, while others (<i>&quot;Are you going to kill Doc, too?&quot;</i>) suggest she didn&#39;t mean to kill him.<br><br>Making my own story out of whole cloth, I&#39;d guess there was something about Vania which either caused her to go out of control and kill Paul, or caused <i>Paul</i> to go out of control and try to kill <i>her</i>, with her killing him in self-defence. Either of those would hit the &#39;terror&amp;guilt&#39; emotion. I&#39;m not sure she&#39;d hit quite that note if, for instance, Paul got possessed by an evil ghost and she had to kill him - because unless she&#39;s in the habit of meeting evil ghosts, that wouldn&#39;t make her worry about killing Doc.<br><br>On the other hand, given how much I&#39;ve just thought and written about it, I guess it&#39;s actually a <i>good</i> way of writing it. ;) You&#39;ve pulled off the &#39;tease&#39; thing, I think.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think, perhaps, I got carried away with posting this so early . . . it relies a bit too much on things that have yet to happen in my spin-off, so your confusion is entirely justified.  All the same, I&#39;m glad it at least worked as a standalone scare.<br><br>I will say that the thing in Vania&#39;s dream is very much <i>not</i> Paul, which I did try to state pretty clearly.  (<i>&quot;You&#39;re not Paul!&quot;  . . . the something wearing Paul’s face.</i>)  What it actually was will have to wait, but there are a couple of hints in here.<br><br>I intentionally kept Vania&#39;s emotion here ambiguous as well, because thanks to her missing memories, neither she nor the audience actually know what happened during the last Mary Sue invasion.  Of course, she obviously remembered for a moment here, but again--I&#39;m not telling yet.<br><br>&quot;Think vines.&quot;  Alas that I must edit them out.  They sound useful.  I actually thought &quot;bleen bag chair&quot; was too <i>easy</i> of a joke, and decided to not spell it out directly and let the reader fill it in.  (Which you did.  Yay!)  I know the Luxury line is kind of Family Guyish, but . . . I rather like it.  I think I&#39;ll keep it in for now.  (Who knows how sound and walls might interact in a dream?)<br><br>The looking backwards bit . . . might depend on how one typically uses bean bags?  It literally just occurred to me that most people might sit in a bean bag chair, as though it has &quot;chair&quot; in its name or something, whereas I&#39;ve always used them as a pillow while laying down.  Yeah, now I see how Vania tilting her head backwards to see the room upside down was unintentionally horrifying.  What if I try:<br><br>*adding to the first sentence: <i>Vania jolted awake at a sudden sound, throwing her ponytail into her face as she lifted her head out of the bleen bag chair.  She had fallen asleep lying on the floor, with the bean bag as a pillow.</i><br><br>* And at the scene itself: <i>“Doc?”  Vania used her feet to slide backwards into the bean bag, tilting her head upwards to see the rest of RC251 upside-down.</i><br><br>Would that read a bit more clearly?</p>

            <p>This one&#39;s canon.<br><br><hr>
<br>   Nathan frowned when he heard the knocking. Ellipsia was on an epic quest for a new keyboard, which would, considering the determination she had, take a rather long time, and the console had been silent, too. Ignoring the nagging feeling in his guts, Nathan pushed himself up from his bed and walked over to the door. &quot;Coming!&quot; He reached for the door handle and, very slowly, pushed it down.<br>  &quot;That took you, guy.&quot;<br>  Nathan froze dead in his tracks, leaving the person outside the door to open it and enter. &quot;Arthur,&quot; he muttered, hardly audible.<br>  &quot;Yes, me. C&#39;mon, please tell me you missed me.&quot;<br>  Nathan turned towards the man, who smiled at him in a way that was somehow off. Except for the sloppily shaven goatee and the just as sloppily cut hair, Arthur was just like he remembered him. &quot;What... where... how...&quot;<br>  Arthur shrugged. &quot;Here, there... anywhere and nowhere?&quot;<br>  &quot;But you were... I thought you were... You...&quot;<br>  &quot;Crazy? Off the deep end? Insane?&quot; Arthur closed the door and leant against it. &quot;Insanity is relative.&quot;<br>  &quot;You look better than, you know, back then.&quot; Nathan smiled slightly. &quot;Any urges to go on a rampage?&quot;<br>  Arthur merely shook his head.<br>  &quot;But where have you been? Wait, I asked that already. What were you doing?&quot;<br>  &quot;This, that...&quot;<br>  Nathan stepped closer. &quot;You&#39;re avoiding my questions. You are-&quot;<br>  &quot;Were.&quot;<br>  &quot;Were my partner. You can tell me.&quot;<br>  Arthur pushed himself away from the door. &quot;I did spend some time as a raving lunatic. But I was a raving lunatic with an RA.&quot;<br>  &quot;Somehow, that doesn&#39;t sound like it&#39;s a good thing.&quot;<br>  &quot;But it was. You know, it showed me that the world can be fixed. That&#39;s what the PPC does. It fixes things.&quot;<br>  Again, that didn&#39;t sound like it was a good thing, but somehow, Nathan felt that he shouldn&#39;t voice his concerns just now. &quot;That means you&#39;re coming back?&quot;<br>  &quot;Not really. I&#39;m doing my own thing now. Temporary insanity has been some kind of revelation for me.&quot; Arthur eyed the bottle of bleeprin on the shelf next to the door. &quot;How do you even get jars that big?&quot;<br>  Nathan shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s not really mine.&quot;<br>  &quot;Ah yeah. The path to madness. You know... it&#39;s actually the Flowers&#39; fault.&quot;<br>  &quot;Huh?&quot;<br>  &quot;All the rules. Collecting charges, making things hard for yourself, risking your life with every single Sue you fight. And for what?&quot; Arthur leant towards Nathan and stared right into his eyes. &quot;You know for what? For some weeds who think they know everything.&quot;<br>  Nathan inched back. &quot;Wait, wait, wait. You always said tha-&quot;<br>  &quot;And then reality collapsed on top of me. Which wouldn&#39;t have happened if we&#39;d thrown her off Dalaran sooner. She was a Sue, and one could tell that.&quot;<br>  &quot;What if we had killed her and she turned out to be a decent OC?&quot;<br>  Arthur shrugged. &quot;Happens. Remember that Spock line you used to quote?&quot;<br>  &quot;The needs of the many?&quot; Nathan shook his head. &quot;That&#39;s not how it works. We can&#39;t go around and kill anything that&#39;s not canon. That&#39;s not what we do.&quot;<br>  Arthur took another step forwards. &quot;When you joined the PPC, did you expect to see your first partner and mentor go batshit crazy? Because that is what we do. We go crazy for the Flowers.&quot;<br>  Nathan shrunk back some more and took a few deep breaths.<br>  &quot;Do you get it now?&quot;<br>  &quot;You know what I didn&#39;t expect either? Turning my hair permanently blue in a freak accident we swore to never speak of again. Having movie nights full of things I&#39;ll never get because they were just so plain weird. Or, you know, being dragged into Lord of the Rings and finding it okay.&quot;<br>  &quot;Wait. Are you trying to friendship speech me?&quot;<br>  Nathan stood back upright. &quot;Bad things happen, and your descent into madness was the worst one. That doesn&#39;t mean good things can&#39;t happen. And you know what? The PPC beats studying math.&quot;<br>  Arthur turned around and shook his head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I just wanted to get you out of here, but it looks like they got to you already.&quot; The man reached into one of his bottomless pockets and took out an RA. &quot;Are you going to hand me over now?&quot;<br>  Without a word, Nathan pounced. Arthur activated the RA and slipped through the portal just in time, leaving Nathan to land on the floor, cracking a handful of polystyrene balls. He scrambled back up, only to see the portal close in front of his eyes. He hadn&#39;t expected that visit, just like he hadn&#39;t expected how it would end. To Nathan, it was clear that something wasn&#39;t quite right about his former partner. One didn&#39;t just become sane again.<br>  With a sigh, Nathan walked back over to his bed and flopped into it face first.<br>  <br>  When the door opened the second time, it was Ellipsia who entered, with a halfway decent keyboard under her arm. &quot;Hey, Nathan. You wouln&#39;t believe what I had to do to get this thing!&quot;<br>  Nathan mumbled something into his pillow.<br>  &quot;Nathan?&quot; Ellipsia stalked over to him and poked him in the shoulder. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br>  &quot;I met Arthur.&quot;<br>  &quot;What?! Like, here?&quot;<br>  Nathan nodded into his pillow. &quot;Sit down and I&#39;ll tell you.&quot;<br>  Ellipsia did as he said, staring into the ceiling as her parnter told her about the unlikely visitor.

<br>As for the concrit...<br><br>Since San already said what bothered me about hS&#39; thing, I&#39;ll look at Phobos&#39;:<br>Wow. This thing just kept piling up WHAM!s. I&#39;m intrigued about this timeline, and what happened. Still, I feel teased a bit too hard. I&#39;m not sure if I know enough about this timeline to care about Operation Sweeper.<br>What I really did like was the potted fern itself. There was this whole &quot;end of innocence&quot; feeling about its actions and reactions to things. Also, these words: Potted Fern Official.</p>

            <p>This is a pretty cool set up for a new, antagonistic character.  You&#39;ve given us Arthur&#39;s world(s) view, and sent him running off, leaving our imaginations to fester over what kind of damage he could potentially do.  I&#39;m looking forward to seeing where his plot progresses, and how Nathan reacts to future behavior.<br><br>The set up to Arthur&#39;s intro is also good, though brief.  Bringing up Ellipsia&#39;s expected long absence, and the console&#39;s silence, are good ways to ready a PPC reader for something unusual to come.  I do think that first paragraph could have been stretched out a bit more, though, to draw out the reader&#39;s feeling of suspense.<br><br>Arthur&#39;s dialogue is also a bit inconsistent.  His first few responses to Nathan are evasive lists of nonsense (&quot;Here, there,&quot; &quot;this, that,&quot; etc.)  Then, Arthur switches to complete, detailed sentences.  It&#39;s maybe supposed to feel like Arthur is toying with Nathan in the beginning, but the sudden change is still a little jarring.  It might be worth it to look at the dialogue there and pace out the progression of Arthur&#39;s speech a bit more.</p>

            <p>First for your story.  I like the interplay between the two characters.  There is a very &quot;Darth Vader v Luke Skywalker&quot; thing going on here which works really well.  The building tension between them is wonderful.<br><br>Also, this, &quot;Wait. Are you trying to friendship speech me?&quot;  Awesome.<br><br>Something I thought needed work was Arthur&#39;s exit.  It doesn&#39;t quite work for me.  Nathan pounces.  Arthur portals.  Nathan ends up on the floor in front of the portal as it closes.  I just think, if he were going for a tackle (which seems evident from him ending up on the floor) that his momentum should have taken him past where Arthur was, and into the portal.  I know that is something you don&#39;t want to happen in this story, so there should be some reason he doesn&#39;t.  Maybe he tripped on the polystyrene balls, I don&#39;t know.<br><br>I think the reason that stands out is that this scene is rooted in the mental and emotional, so the one bit that is fairly physical needs to be strong to stand up with the rest.<br><br>Overall, well done.  I can tell that we haven&#39;t seen the last of Arthur, and I am looking forward to finding out what he&#39;s up to and unraveling his mystery.<br><br><br><br>Now to reply to your concrit for my story.  I&#39;m glad the potted fern comes across well.  The end of innocence is not something that I went in thinking about, but it is definitely there, now you mention it.  And I&#39;m glad those three words had the impact I was hoping for.  That section got rewritten at the last minute to put those words at the end of the paragraph, which I think made a big difference.<br><br>I apologize for teasing too hard.  I was aiming for mystery and I guess I overshot.  I am going to try to rewrite it to add in some more information about what all went wrong.  I want to keep some of the WHAM!s for the larger story, though.  So it&#39;s a balancing act.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I must say, I really enjoyed this - possibly because I&#39;m a sucker for a good catastrophe timeline.<br><br>I thought you did a very good job of portraying a Legal functionary - there haven&#39;t exactly been many of them (actually, are there any named anywhere besides <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1TBGU1xpjub1bM8lggLsL0f8inXLe321VpwXwfChTVpk">Chiaroscuro</a>?), but you&#39;ve pinned down what looks like the essence of Legal - unremarkable, but with the wicked sort of dry humour that can also be read as not understanding there&#39;s such a thing as humour. That &#39;I would be in violation&#39; line is perfect.<br><br>I also think you pulled off the Potted Fern&#39;s speech/thoughts very well. It&#39;s got the right mix of anger, resentment and, ah, resigned dedication. You also made excellent use of Flower-type idioms, which is always a plus.<br><br>My main concern... well, no, I have two. The first is your insistence on lowercasing the Potted Fern. As far as I&#39;m aware, every single Plant in the PPC&#39;s history has been referred to in capitals. One might occasionally see a lowercase used to describe the species of a named Flower - but even then, you&#39;d usually get &#39;Captain Dandy was, of course, a Dandelion&#39;. I think this derives ultimately from the Narnian habit of capitalising the species of talking animals - it shows up in the <i>Wicked</i> books, as well.<br><br>Of course, you&#39;ve also worked this into the narrative with the &#39;Potted Fern Official&#39; section - but I don&#39;t know that it really fits. I&#39;d be tempted to drop the whole minefield, capitalise it throughout, and tweak the two sentences that needs it from &#39;It wasn&#39;t long before the capital letters started sneaking in...&#39; to something more like &#39;It wasn&#39;t long before the additional title had started sneaking in when agents had addressed the lead Flower. The Potted Fern hadn&#39;t done anything to stop it, but it couldn&#39;t bring itself...&#39;. It&#39;s actually sort of a shame, since that section is well-written and works, but...<br><br>That was my &#39;parenthetical aside&#39; concern. The main concern is that I&#39;m left kind of in the mist as to what&#39;s going on in the backstory. The lines like &#39;that meant having a Plant running the show&#39; and &#39;So it had been chosen for the Council of Nine&#39; sound like the PFO is part of the leadership of the PPC, though possibly as a figurehead. The stuff about Operation Sweeper and the Department of Resistance sound like it&#39;s part of the (duh) resistance against the leadership of the PPC, which could fit with the figurehead idea. But near the end, the PFO is going to tell the Council about the visit... which means they&#39;re in on things... which means they can&#39;t be who&#39;s being rebelled against... which either means they&#39;re not running the PPC, even though the opening implied they were, or they are, and the PPC has effectively renamed itself the Department of Resistance under some occupying force. You mention &#39;the invasion&#39; in passing, but nothing clear.<br><br>Obviously, there&#39;s no need to spell out everything - it would be a very bad method of storytelling, actually. If, as I&#39;m coming to suspect after repeated readings, the PPC and Council of Nine are under occupation, but secretly working against the occupier - some mention of &#39;Them&#39; or some other non-specific term would make things a little clearer. Perhaps something as simple as, in the PFO&#39;s &#39;papers&#39; rant, adding <i>The invasion?  The hell we&#39;ve gone through under the Occupation?</i> would clear things up.<br><br>If, of course, there is an Occupation. The fact that I can&#39;t tell is the basic point of this long ramble.<br><br>But that is a very minor point, in the scheme of things. It was a fun story to read, and well written to boot.<br><br>And now, I&#39;m going to do some more chemistry (because work is, er, fun?), and then try to rework my own entry...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.  Now on to my comments.<br><br>It seems the characters really came through well, which is something I strive for.  Also, who doesn&#39;t love a good catastrophe timeline?<br><br>I&#39;m going to leave the capitalization issue alone for the most part, since you and Nesh are covering it so thoroughly already.  I will only say that I think both low self-esteem and issues with certain other pteridophyts may explain this case.<br><br>As to the larger issue, I will probably have to find some ways to make it more clear.  The other story, which I&#39;ve been working on for a while now, covers most of the backstory.  But I know that is no excuse.  This scene should stand on its own.  Your suggestion of using the word &#39;occupation&#39; is a good one.  That does get much closer to the target than invasion did, so I will likely use it in the eventual rewrite.<br><br>Also, I don&#39;t think your confusion in regards to the backstory is a minor point, as you&#39;ve suggested.  You are an intelligent guy and if it doesn&#39;t make sense to you, after multiple reads, then there is likely a problem on my end.  I know what the backstory is, which is why I need people like you to point out if I am not giving enough information.  I just have to find a way to strike a balance between giving enough information and not rehashing all the information that I put into the larger story, which really spells out what happened.<br><br>Still, for three day&#39;s work, this seems to have turned out pretty well.  Thanks for your concrit.  It has been most helpful.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p><i>Au contraire, mon ami!</i> The potted fern has actually never been capitalized (in all of the two stories and one RP log it appears in prior to this), and furthermore, I have noticed in my archiving work that Flower species never or rarely were in the beginning, either. In TOS, by and large, the Sunflower Official is a sunflower; the Marquis de Sod is a daisy; the Lichen is a lichen, etc. Even the first mention of &quot;sunflower official&quot; (in mission 5, &quot;What Might Have Been&quot;) is lowercased on Miss Cam&#39;s site; I changed it for The Lost Tales because it does get capitalized later on, so consistency.<br><br>As to the fern specifically, though, I figure it&#39;s lowercased because it&#39;s not a director or official or anything much at all, really. It just hangs around and occasionally carries messages, and it certainly isn&#39;t that other Fern, which does get a capital.<br><br>Or it might be that Nenya never gave it a title in the original story, where it&#39;s basically just &quot;that fern that ate my apple fritter,&quot; and I took that more literally than perhaps was necessary for the sake of consistency and honoring the original work. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>So... I&#39;m not necessarily disagreeing that perhaps it <i>should</i> be capitalized at this point. It&#39;s just not true that Flowers, and specifically this one, always have been.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who will likely not be able to participate, unfortunately, but will try if inspiration strikes.</p>

            <p>I do maintain that in general, most Flowers these days are capitalised - but that may be solely because that&#39;s what I do (and I know you&#39;ve had to call me on capitalising &#39;Agent&#39; everywhere, too, which I think I&#39;ve stopped doing). I also didn&#39;t know the pPotted fFern had appeared outside that original story (Yes, I did recognise it! That&#39;s also the first published appearance of Constance Sims, so I read it occasionally), so there&#39;s that. Which is the other story it&#39;s been in, out of interest?<br><br>My counterexample to the piece of sentient vegetation in question is the Daisy; the one who shows up in the Playscriptes, and was in the Fifth Anniversary RP. Despite having no, er, actual job (seriously, it just hangs around), it&#39;s the Daisy, and a Daisy, throughout. The Yellow Roses get the same treatment, and their job appears to be &#39;pretending the DOOCH is a real thing&#39;. The Weeds, as well, are referred to by their names, but also occasionally by species - we have a Tumbleweed in there somewhere (and a Wild Rose, I think?). All of those capitalise their species, and, er, at least one of them isn&#39;t my fault? Okay, the Daisy is mine, and the Weeds were mostly created by me, but I didn&#39;t come up with the Yellow Roses!<br><br>But inconclusive me-centred evidence aside, I think the thing that bothers me about lowercased Flowers is that their species is the closest thing they have to a name. It feels sort of like a Time Lord being lowercased - &#39;The Daleks fired their exterminator beams, but the apologist managed to duck behind a pillar. &quot;Morgan!&quot; he yelled. &quot;Any time now would be good!&quot;&#39;<br><br>... I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;ve just sidetracked myself with wanting to create a Time Lord called the Apologist. Um. Where was I?<br><br>Nope, lost it. I think I was just typing words because it&#39;s fun. Anyhow, in case I didn&#39;t mention it in my actual review, it was brilliant to see Legal doing their thing. I really want to write a story about Legal, but don&#39;t know if I can do it while maintaining their mystery...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>But no, I think you&#39;re right that the rest of them are capitalized these days, and they do function more or less like names. I do like Phobos&#39; idea of the potted fern simply not thinking of itself that way, though (and I actually know a guy who doesn&#39;t like to be called anything), so I dunno.

            <p>But they&#39;re also a Firstborn conceit - which, since they&#39;re the role models for all the other Flowers, means the entire, uh, whatever you say instead of &#39;species&#39; when it&#39;s a whole class of being, probably feels a (cultural) need to use them.

            <p>Steve Dimond frowned at the door. “Tango?” he called. “Is that you? You really don’t have to knock.”<br><br>“But I might if I’m not Tango,” a muffled voice pointed out, and Steve jerked upright, practically falling out of his chair. He <i>knew</i> that voice!<br><br>As the door swung open, bounced, half closed again, and hit Steve’s elbow before finally coming to a stop, Constance Illian-Sims watched with a huge grin, stroking the miniature golden dragon on her shoulder. Steve stared at her in bewilderment, unable to persuade his mouth to form any words.<br><br>“Well, hello to you, too.” Constance peered into the Response Centre. “Oh, I see you’ve redecorated. Tango’s influence?”<br><br>Steve looked around at the red-painted walls, the soft white carpet, the children’s paintings in their frames. “How could you tell?”<br><br>Constance snorted. “You haven’t changed a bit. Can I come in? Good.” She brushed past him and perched on the arm of the sofa. “Your son not around?”<br><br>“Sons,” Steve corrected, and smiled at Constance’s raised eyebrow. “Luden’s four now, and Jason’s two. And no, they’re in the Nursery. I think my sister’s taking care of them, actually.”<br><br>“Oh, yes, the blonde with the not-quite-dead thing going on.” Constance thought for a moment, then shrugged. “I guess I can’t really pick, considering… but I’m not here to gossip. This is serious.”<br><br>“I figured that,” Steve agreed. “Otherwise you’d have shown up <i>sooner</i> than three years after last time.”<br><br>“Well, I’ve been busy,” Constance pointed out. “Tanfin’s pretty self-sufficient by now, but Jasmine’s still incredibly needy, and as for Bella and Daphne – well, you know how babies are, I’m sure.” She touched her stomach, which Steve now noticed was slightly rounded. “I just hope this one’s better behaved than some of his sisters.”<br><br>Steve nodded seriously. “I can tell this is an incredibly important conversation,” he said. “It’s a good thing you’re not getting distracted by gossip.”<br><br>“Oh, hush, you. Don’t you know it’s mean to pick on pregnant women?”<br><br>“So I’ve been told. Then I think Ontic told Tango that was sexist, and Elanor - who’s also pregnant now – suggested that maybe it should be ‘never pick on someone who can probably cripple you for life’, and the conversation moved on to maiming.” Steve shrugged. “Life in the PPC, you know?”<br><br>“Well, I have a fire lizard, and I’m not afraid to use her, so you’d best be cautious either way.” Constance shook her head. “No, but really. Things out in the Multiverse have been getting… tense. Do you know anything about that?”<br><br>“Things are always tense,” Steve pointed out. “There’s an infinite host of Mary-Sues sweeping through the Word Worlds, remember?”<br><br>Constance scowled at him. “I meant tenser than normal. Agents have always left us alone before – you know who I mean, all the retirees living in the ‘Verse – but you’ve started stopping us, questioning us. It’s like you think we’re a threat of some sort.”<br><br>Steve frowned. “You personally? I mean, <i>I</i> know you’re a dangerous person, but…”<br><br>“Me, Dafydd, some of our friends – heck, Tanfin got interrogated a few days ago, and he’s only seven! It’s ridiculous.”<br><br>“Um. I think I might know what that’s about.” Steve ran a hand through his hair. “Do you remember Kayleigh Leonard? She’s in Bad Slash.”<br><br>“The really weird one?” Constance nodded. “I remember you sneaking off with her at Jay’s leaving do, at any rate.”<br><br>Steve blushed. “Yes, well. Um, she’s got some sort of theory about there being an organisation out in the Worlds trying to destroy canon – sort of an anti-PPC, I think. She’s been spreading rumours and making waves – you know how she is.”<br><br>“Well, I knew about the ‘spreading’ part,” Constance agreed, and Steve’s face grew even redder.<br><br>“Well, anyway, people have been getting a bit twitchy about strangers in the Worlds. That’s probably why they’re bothering you.”<br><br>“Hmm.” Constance drummed her fingers on the back of the sofa. “Any truth in the rumours?”<br><br>Steve shrugged. “I haven’t seen anything, and I haven’t heard of anyone who has. But Kayleigh usually has <i>some</i> foundation for her theories.”<br><br>“Hmmmm.” Constance’s gaze stayed defocussed in thought for a moment, and then she stood up abruptly. “Right. Thank you, Steve, you’ve been… well, <i>moderately</i> helpful. I’ll try not to leave it three years this time.” And off she strode out of the door.<br><br>Steve shook his head. She hadn’t changed a bit, apparently – same old Constance. She-<br><br>“One more thing!” Steve jumped as Constance’s head reappeared around the doorframe. “What did you say this anti-PPC was called?”<br><br>“Um, something about plates?” Steve offered. “No, peace… oh, that was it: Ispace.”<br><br>“Thank you! See you eventually!” And she was gone.<br><br><hr>

            <p>They&#39;re basically an organization dedicated to keeping elves safe across the multiverse, and failing that, anything they see as an elf, which can include elven Sues and elf-like humanoids.<br><br>They&#39;ve shown up most recently in his OFU, though they didn&#39;t really come across as an anti-PPC anywhere I saw. They had access to PPC technology, like the portals and the SEP Field, but they had never really tried to destroy a canon.<br>They didn&#39;t seem to care much about keeping to canon events when they were there, since one of Huinesoron&#39;s stories showed them helping Thranduil in the Battle of Five Armies and abducting Smaug from Middle-earth to resurrect him after his canonical death, but they didn&#39;t seem to want to actively <i>destroy</i> anything.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure how Ispace started or exactly what it does to defend the elves and pseudo-elves, so I&#39;m as in the dark about that as you are. You&#39;d think that the initial exposition or one of the Ispace characters would elaborate, but in the initial story they show up in, the start of the organization is told as essentially &quot;a version of one of Middle-earth&#39;s Glorfindels from an alternate universe had his horse stolen one day, and in retaliation, decided to set up an interdimensional organization&quot;. It seems like a pretty large overreaction, but what do I know? I&#39;m not an elf.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure they don&#39;t have access to PPC technology (unless they stole it). Of the two examples you listed, SEP Fields come from a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">different continuum entirely</a>, and if you read the description of the portal opening in chapter 9 of OFUDisc, it looks very different to the ones created by PPC portal generators. <br><br>As for them being an &#39;anti-PPC&#39;, that was just Kayleigh&#39;s opinion, and she&#39;s not always the most rational person around. They don&#39;t seem to be opposed to the PPC in the same way that the League of Mary Sue factories is, but they clearly have their own agenda, which could easily bring them into conflict with the PPC in certain circumstances - however, in others the goals of the two organisations might line up nicely. <br><br></p>

            <p>I knew about the SEP Fields being from H2G2, but I&#39;d forgotten that their portals in OFUDisc were red instead of blue until they opened, and caused the dimensional twist effect. Ispace&#39;s portals were blue in their first story, and behaved a lot like the PPC portals, but I suppose Ispace must have modified them over the years.<br>It&#39;s a sensible thing to do, considering that Ispace seems to use their portals to transport a large number of personnel over large dimensional distances, while the PPC tends to use their portals primarily to transport a small group of people to neighboring continua, or from an individual continuum to the null zone of HQ.<br><br>Now I want to see a story with multi-organization team-ups, where one side is trying to outpace the other, but the organizations composing each side would have differing goals and strained relationships. Ispace would team up with the PPC, and the League of Mary Sue Factories with... I think NASTY is still around. With NASTY, then. It&#39;d be interesting to see what they get up to, since they were never really elaborated on after their first appearance.<br>Of course, I have no idea what four distinctly separate multi-dimensional organizations would want to go after, but it&#39;s possible the Mirror Multiverse would be involved.</p>

I think my sister’s taking care of them, actually.”<br><br>“Oh, yes, the blonde with the not-quite-dead thing going on.” Constance thought for a moment, then shrugged. “I guess I can’t really pick, considering… but I’m not here to gossip. This is serious.”<br><br>“I figured that,” Steve agreed, closing the door and leaning back against the console. “Otherwise you’d have shown up <i>sooner</i> than three years after last time.”<br><br>“Well, I’ve been busy,” Constance pointed out. “Tanfin’s pretty self-sufficient by now, but Jasmine’s still incredibly needy, and as for Bella and Daphne – well, you know how babies are, I’m sure.” She touched her stomach, which Steve now noticed was slightly rounded. “I just hope this one’s better behaved than some of his sisters.”<br><br>Steve nodded seriously. “I can tell this is an incredibly important conversation,” he said. “It’s a good thing you’re not getting distracted by gossip.”<br><br>“Oh, hush, you. Don’t you know it’s mean to pick on pregnant women?”<br><br>“So I’ve been told. Then I think Ontic told Tango that was sexist, and Elanor - who’s also pregnant now – suggested that maybe it should be ‘never pick on someone who can probably cripple you for life’, and the conversation moved on to maiming.” Steve shrugged, waving an arm to indicate the console, the RC, the whole of HQ. “Life in the PPC, you know?”<br><br>“Well, I have a fire lizard, and I’m not afraid to use her, so you’d best be cautious either way.” The tiny dragon in question lifted her head and let out a noise halfway between a purr and a chirp. Constance laughed softly and reached up to stroke her pet’s chin. “No, you can stay put for now, Hera,” she said. “I think he’s learnt his lesson.”<br><br>“Definitely,” Steve assured her, trying surreptitiously to back away from his visitors. “I’m very good at learning lessons from Constance - I&#39;ve had lots of practice.” Hera chirped again with what sounded like amusement, and settled down to watch him.<br><br>Constance chuckled, still idly rubbing Hera’s chin, but her smile quickly faded. “No, but really. Things out in the Multiverse have been getting… tense. Do you know anything about that?”<br><br>“Things are always tense,” Steve pointed out. “There’s an infinite host of Mary-Sues sweeping through the Word Worlds, remember?”<br><br>Constance scowled at him, and even Hera gave him a distinct Look. “I meant tenser than normal. Agents have always left us alone before – you know who I mean, all the retirees living in the ‘Verse – but you’ve started stopping us, questioning us. It’s like you think we’re a threat of some sort.”<br><br>Steve frowned, leant forwards, then realised what he was doing and straightened up again. “You personally? I mean, <i>I</i> know you’re a dangerous person, but…”<br><br>“Me, Dafydd, some of our friends – heck, Tanfin got interrogated a few days ago, and he’s only seven! It’s ridiculous.”<br><br>“Um. I think I might know what that’s about.” Steve ran a hand through his sandy-brown hair, spent a second trying to work out a tangle and failing miserably. “Do you remember Kayleigh Leonard? She’s in Bad Slash.”<br><br>“The really weird one?” Constance nodded. “I remember you sneaking off with her at Jay’s leaving do, at any rate.”<br><br>Steve blushed. “Yes, well. Um, she’s got some sort of theory about there being an organisation out in the Worlds trying to destroy canon – sort of an anti-PPC, I think. She’s been spreading rumours and making waves – you know how she is.”<br><br>“Well, I knew about the ‘spreading’ part,” Constance agreed, and Steve’s face grew even redder.<br><br>“Well, anyway, people have been getting a bit twitchy about strangers in the Worlds. That’s probably why they’re bothering you.”<br><br>“Hmm.” Constance drummed her fingers on the back of the sofa. “Any truth in the rumours?”<br><br>Steve shrugged. “I haven’t seen anything, and I haven’t heard of anyone who has. “ He nodded backwards at the console. “Everything on the network seems to stem from Kayleigh... but on the other hand, she usually has <i>some</i> foundation for her theories.”<br><br>“Hmmmm.” Constance’s gaze stayed defocussed in thought for a moment, and then she stood up abruptly, almost dislodging Hera. “Right. Thank you, Steve, you’ve been… well, <i>moderately</i> helpful. I’ll try not to leave it three years this time.” She crossed the room in a few steps, pulled the door open, and strode off into HQ.<br><br>Steve shook his head. She hadn’t changed a bit, apparently – same old Constance. She-<br><br>“One more thing!” Steve jumped as Constance’s head reappeared around the doorframe. “What did you say this anti-PPC was called?”<br><br>“Um, something about plates?” Steve offered. “No, peace… oh, that was it: Ispace.”<br><br>“Thank you! See you eventually!” And she was gone.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Changes mostly revolve around making Steve a physical presence, not just a talking head, and ensuring Hera is actually there. Slightly expanded section of dialogue in the middle, but otherwise that&#39;s mostly unchanged.<br><br>And the epic saga of me not knowing Steve&#39;s hair colour continues: this time it&#39;s &#39;sandy-brown&#39;. It tends to wander between brown and blonde - probably to do with the lighting.<br><br>Any further comments are of course welcome.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Positive: I enjoy the flow of the dialogue. You do a good job making it seem like normal people talking in real time, which I personally find to be kind of tricky occasionally.<br><br>Negative: This could be just me, but I think you need a little more description.

            <p>I am (vaguely) planning to do a minor rewrite in line with your comment - the other piece of description I notice as totally lacking is Steve&#39;s movements. I think he just stood there holding the door for the whole story.

            <p>First off, I quite like Yorick&#39;s interactions with the Marquis. He has the right sort of flippant obedience down, which works well with his outfit.<br><br>I&#39;m not so keen on the way you have the Marquis talking... actually, no, that&#39;s not quite true. There&#39;s only two points that stick out to me:<br><br>-He&#39;s very inconsistent in how he refers to Valon. Given who he is - the Head of Personnel - I think he&#39;d be more likely to choose either &#39;Agent Valon&#39; or &#39;Agent Vance&#39; and stick with it. The former is slightly more common, I believe. He would certainly <i>never</i> use &#39;Mister Vance&#39;. Titles are there for a reason. :P<br><br>-This line: <i>Note, Agent Vance is red-green colorblind... And, what exactly is this skeleton for?</i><br>--The first clause feels like you trying to work that fact in, rather than something the Marquis would say. I&#39;d go with something more like, <i>&#39;Purplish&#39;. Hmm. Well, I suppose we should expect such understatements if we go about hiring colour-blind staff...</i>.<br>--The second clause... has already been answered, with the earlier &#39;So you made your own?&#39;. He <i>knows</i> Yorick is supposed to be Valon&#39;s partner. Actually, given Yorick&#39;s response, I&#39;d put something more like, <i>And you... undead bony thing. What do you have to say for yourself?</i>.<br><br>That said, I did enjoy most of his lines (<i>You would not be able to explain your existence. Agent Vance would.</i>). Although, two other notes:<br><br>-The last Marquis line in the first section isn&#39;t really a question.<br>-Hahaha, six hours downtime? Valon&#39;ll be lucky if he&#39;s allowed five minutes to explain to Yorick what a &#39;PiPiCee&#39; is, and another five to show him which end of a sword (or gun, or staff) to hold. The Flowers don&#39;t give people time off because it&#39;ll make things easier for them - they make them go and do the work anyway, because, as the Queen Anne&#39;s Lace once said, <i>If we don&#39;t keep them working, they might find the time to ask when they get paid... and no one wants that. Except them. And they don&#39;t count.</i><br><br>On to the actual narrative... which again, doesn&#39;t bother me most of the time. There&#39;s only a couple of lines that feel a bit, well, off:<br><br>-&#39;He was colorblind, and the skeleton was urple, the worst color&#39;. Um, that&#39;s a very strange description of urple. I&#39;d either cut the last three words altogether, or string it out a bit. If I were writing this sentence, I&#39;d go with something like: &#39;[to one glaring problem://]The skeleton was urple, that particular mix of purple and pink which makes canons quail, fangirls scream, and agents cover their eyes in horror... unless, like Vanon, they happened to be colour-blind.&#39;<br><br>-&#39;made this already strange pose even odder. Well, as odd as being a pinkish-purple skeleton made it, anyway.&#39; I assume the &#39;strange pose&#39; is the salute, which doesn&#39;t seem all that strange. I think you want something like &#39;strange sight/vision&#39;, since it <i>is</i> an odd mental picture. And the final sentence (&#39;Well, as odd... anyway&#39;), um... I don&#39;t know what you were trying to say, so it didn&#39;t work.<br><br>-Given that Valon had to check the book for &#39;Create Undead&#39;, I&#39;m not sure why he suddenly knows that a &#39;Wand of Prestidigitation&#39; (whatever that is) can change Yorick&#39;s colour. Urple is notoriously hard to get rid of anyway, and if you&#39;re using it, I&#39;d recommend reading <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/644826/1/The-Official-Fanfiction-University-of-Middleearth">OFUM</a>, since that&#39;s where it comes from. There&#39;s a line in Chapter 15 that &#39;the only stuff that got urple off was Wormtongue&#39;s Wonder Wash – although most were convinced it was because he had helped created urple in the first place&#39;, and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more. Also, it&#39;s fun to read. (And yes, the original description is &#39;the worst possible colour&#39;, I know - that doesn&#39;t make it the best description). Eitherhow, that line should probably be something more like &#39;Valon saluted as well, though much more lazily than Yorick. “I&#39;ll look into it, sir.”&#39; To which the Marquis would no doubt make a snarky comment.<br><br>But in general, I quite liked it. You&#39;ve given your agents personalities - somewhat different ones - and that&#39;s always a good sign.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>While the description of the spell (found in most editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons) does say it can change an object&#39;s color (and is more than a little vague on what the limits are), I would say that urple is a special case. Probably the best you could hope for is to get another suvian color. For example, if you tried to turn some thing from urple to white, you&#39;d probably just get wilver.</p>

            <p>Urple was established in its original appearance to be difficult to remove entirely,  but I doubt all Suvian colors show the same resilience. Eventually, after enough changes, the Suvian colors would likely mitigate to a state in which the resultant color would not cause adverse effects. It would still be pretty annoying to look at, like a bright neon yellow or something, but it wouldn&#39;t have the impossibility factor of urple or glose or the like. That many changes might exhaust the wand, though. Do Pathfinder magic wands do that?<br><br>Yep, because chroma-shifting magical energy is exactly like mixing food coloring. I&#39;m pretty sure I have very little idea what I&#39;m talking about, but it might be a decent enough hand wave.</p>

            <p>Valon&#39;s Wikia page says that he is from World One. If so, how did he cast a magic spell from an RPG-verse? Normally, you need to have levels in a character class to cast spells, and getting a first level in a character class isn&#39;t something that just happens. Was the scroll that he used a non-restrictive scroll of some kind that anyone could cast? And in that case, wouldn&#39;t it have been under heavier guard to keep some random schmo from walking in and using it, which is exactly what ended up happening?<br><br>Maybe Valon has a wizard, ranger, cleric, or a member of another magic-using class as a contact in or from the Pathfinder continuum, and that contact cast the spell for him, but that only raises more questions as to how the two met and why that character decided to cast the spell to bring a random impossibly-colored skeleton to life.<br><br>Basically, that could use some clarification.</p>

            <p>You could always just create a generic NPC, you know. Or perhaps you could ask someone on the IRC if they wouldn&#39;t mind having one of their Agents show up for a cameo, or you could stroll around the wiki and find an Agent who hasn&#39;t been in many stories but is not bound by a specific agreement IN LARGE LETTERS, or you could write a different ending, or several other courses of action. <br><br>This has probably been more trouble than you were expecting. Here, as a consolation, take Stromsong, the Stormsong mini-Agent I created accidentally by typing too quickly a few posts back.

            <p>My apologies for the double topic, but this is something that I&#39;d like to know.<br><br>How would you deal with having characters with high levels of power joining the PPC?<br><br>The main reason I ask is that someone suggested that I use a character I wrote for a story, rather than writing one specifically for the PPC. The problem is, every one of my characters operates on an absolutely massive level of power. One of the weakest characters, a four-foot-tall mantis man, is still insanely durable and capable of single-handedly hunting and killing kaiju-sized monsters.<br><br>Obviously, I lack the skill necessary to rope them down to the PPC&#39;s level. How would you guys, being better writers than myself, handle, say, an Exalted agent?</p>

            <p>Both of my Agents are pretty freaking powerful.  One is a Beta-level Ex-Inquisitor Psyker, and the other is Heroic Spirit Jeanne d&#39;Arc.  Honestly, either of them could solo a Mission easily.  But they don&#39;t, because it&#39;s not worth the risk, pain, and effort.  <br><br>You can have insanely high-powered Agents - the easy solution is to make it not worth it for them to use their powers.  My best example being Hell Sings, which is the only time Mike (Jeanne) ever cut loose.  She won the fight, hands down, but nearly died as a result.  You don&#39;t have to go that route, but it&#39;s one way of doing it.</p>

            <p>Is that those powers don&#39;t make the job too easy. If a character can vanquish a Sue with a snap of their fingers, the mission is no fun. Make sure the character has flaws and problems to balance out their abilities and strengths.</p>

            <p><a href="http://bonsaimallorn.webs.com/PuritanEssay.htm">As discussed by Terri</a>, my Agent Dafydd ended up pretty powerful: he had healing/soothing song magic (from being a Noldo of high rank, basically), and a magic ring probably capable of anything he wanted. He wore that ring constantly.<br><br>But was he overpowered? No - because he couldn&#39;t <i>control</i> the ring. Actually, it ended up killing him (he got better).<br><br>Another example of mine is Agent Mortic. He has undefined powers which basically include any boosts he wants to give himself - strength, sight, the ability to cling to ceilings. He&#39;s also immortal. But a) they involve incantations, which aren&#39;t always possible, and b) he just... doesn&#39;t use them (other than the immortality). I suspect they are actually quite draining after use, although it&#39;s never come up. So again, power is limited by what gives him that power.<br><br>And then there&#39;s various former Mary-Sues; I believe the Department of Misplaced Flora and Fauna had one. She (Mel? I can&#39;t access the Wiki here) had untold power - but would get into incredible amounts of trouble with the SO if she used it, because Mary-Sue powers are sort of what the PPC&#39;s there to <i>stop</i>.<br><br>So yah.

            <p>Actually, an Exalt&#39;s power comes from a secondary soul known as their Exaltation that attaches to their human soul, giving them their divine powers. If the Exalted is removed from its home universe, its Exaltation will remain attached to it.<br><br>The thing is, you shouldn&#39;t be removing Exaltations from the Exalted continuum in the first place. There are only a few hundred Solars, Lunars, Abyssals, and Sidereals, the exact number varying for some of those Exalt types based on the time period and how active the various factions of the Primordials have been lately, and the continuum sort of <i>needs</i> those to deal with the massive amounts of demons, Fair Folk, Neverborn, and other such nasties that fill the continuum, not to mention the chaos-spawned creatures coming in from the Bordermarches and Middlemarches every other day.<br>For those, you should destroy the bearer and return the Exaltation to wherever it&#39;s held in between hosts, though I suppose one could try to find a way to remove the Celestial Essence of the Exaltation if one <i>really</i> wanted to recruit a specific Exalt of the limited sort.<br>Preferably, you should also neuralyze the Exalted first before killing it/removing the Celestial Essence to ensure that the Exaltation doesn&#39;t pass on uncanonical memories to its next host, but if you don&#39;t, it&#39;s not the biggest of deals, since Lytek clears most of the memories out anyway, and would find Suvian impulses unsuited for the next Exalt down the line.<br><br>Infernals are even less in number than the previously mentioned four, and there&#39;s the whole &quot;over time they&#39;re going to turn into the next generation of the Yozi, a.k.a. the gigantic quasi-demonic creatures that tried to kill the world&quot; problem with the Infernal Exalted that says it would be a Very Bad Idea to let one run around HQ unchecked.<br><br>Alchemicals and Terrestrials can be created in any number, though, and though they are linked to an Exaltation of sorts, it&#39;s less powerful, and in the case of the Alchemicals, synthetic.<br><br>I&#39;d imagine that a Terrestrial Exalted as an Agent would be treated like any other Agent that comes from a species capable of using elemental powers, like the Benders from A:TLA or the Toa from Bionicle. They&#39;d have access to more raw power, and would thus be likely to be transferred to the sections of the PPC that deal with more raw power, such as the Special Operations Division or the Eclectic Subdivision of Advanced Species. They might also have places in the Security Departments, because their power levels would be very useful for keeping order and combatting threats.<br><br>An Alchemical, on the other hand, is a different matter, since they&#39;re scaled-down robot versions of the other Exalt types. They&#39;d still work well in the same places the Terrestrials would, but more specific postings would depend on their caste. The highly intelligent Orichalcum Alchemicals would be able to take up positions in research-based Departments like DMSEAR and DoSAT, the Jade Alchemicals might be suited to duty in FicPsych, Medical, or another place where their determination, high-spirited attitude, and still-capable level of power would be best put to work, so on and so forth.<br>These are generalizations, of course, since personality would still be in play. Maybe one of the Alchemicals is too impatient for a position that his fellow would take to gladly, or a particular eye for detail and mind for figures gets one Alchemical sent to Finance or Legal. It&#39;s really all about the individual in the end, but high levels of power mean that they should simply be put where those levels of power could do some good without showing everyone else up.</p>

            <p>Wow! I&#39;m glad someone familiar with the game was on this board. <br><br>Regardless of how it actually happens, I feel like the Exalted are too powerful for the PPC as Agents.

<li>Also feel free to share links to badfics you find, if you think they’re worth telling us about. Sometimes we need a good laugh, sometimes we want to offer constructive criticism, sometimes we need something to kill for a mission. Not all badfic needs to be mentioned by itself, though — you can just post it directly to the List of Unclaimed Badfic, or add it to an already existing badfic thread on the Board. (And if you’re replying to a badfic plug, or reviewing it, remember Rule 3!)<br><br>So, generally, the rule is &#39;stick it on the previous thread if it&#39;s still on the Front Page&#39;.<br><br>hS</li>

Okay, THIS one sticks in my mind for how bad it is.  I actually bothered to read through the majority of it out of a sort of bile facination, and you better believe I suffered for it.  From what I&#39;ve seen, the author&#39;s written fics of similar quality and content for a few other fandoms besides just the stuff on that particular ff.net account, including A:TLA and Harry Potter, but Star Wars was the first fandom I ever really got into and the other fic I&#39;m listing is a Clone Wars fic, so I&#39;m going with that one.<br><br>The first thing you notice is the horrible writing and grammar, but that&#39;s only the least of this fic&#39;s issues; we&#39;ve got incest in pretty much every possible heterosexual pairing involving members of the pre-NJO Skywalker and Solo families, R2-D2 has a secret porn stash involving the main characters of the CGI Clone Wars cartoon, everybody is an sex-starved exhibitionist, screwing unconscious people is treated as perfectly fine, fourteen-year-olds can legally have consensual sex, everyone who&#39;s supposed to be in a relationship is cheating with pretty much the entire rest of the cast...  To quote the Transformers Wiki- good god, I need a stiff drink.</p>

            <p>About your mongoose, is it a banded mongoose, yellow mongoose, bush tailed mongoose, dwarf mongoose, meerkat(same subfamily Mungotina), indian gray mongoose, or a gambian mongoose? I know my mongooses, mate. But its nice to have a pet that kills Sues, and venomous snakes. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind this is the PPC and we have a whole multiverse of species of mongeese* to play with. There&#39;s tartan-patterned mongeese running around the Shelter, so you&#39;re not just limited to Earth species. That said, should you want any particular type of mongoose, just let Kepler know. (Kepler is the sentient tub of peanut butter that runs the Shelter with the help of Agent Logan). <br><br>That said, all known species of Mongoose will attack snakes and the Shelter-bred examples also attack Sues, thanks to some handy genetic engineering. <br><br>Elcalion, dispensing small mammals<br>*Yes, I know technically the correct plural is mongooses cause the original word is a loan word from Hindi (mangus, I believe), but c&#39;mon.

            <p>I&#39;m thinking about getting back into writing missions and non-mission PPC fanfiction, but I need a partner for my agent. <br><br>Agent Avery is a former bit character who has a rather unfortunate ability. She can&#39;t die. She can be maimed, disabled, and very close to killed, but she doesn&#39;t die. She can regenerate by consuming extraneous Words. But, it&#39;s a rather painful process. <br><br>Otherwise, she&#39;s completely unremarkable. Avery isn&#39;t particularly athletic, smart, or pretty. In fact, there&#39;s no description for her hair color, so she just shaved all of her uncolored hair off. <br><br>Any takers? </p>

And will probably regret that, considering how much I&#39;m already writing, but still.<br><br>I&#39;ll admit to only having skimmed the discussion below (hence why I&#39;m not entirely sure if anyone else has replied as a taker), but she does sound fascinating. In fact, I may have a partner for her--Agent Ariel. He may be meant for ESAS, though, depending on how much his powers get diminished; I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s an issue or not. If it is, we could try Agent Dawn McKenna, but she&#39;s a) fairly insane, b) the PPC liaison for SBEI (the Avengers-verse OFU), and c) gets visits from her author, which could get awkward for Avery. On the other hand, it could stabilize Dawn a little, so...I don&#39;t know. Whatever you like.<br><br>Ariel is a former Supernatural-verse angel. He ended up in the PPC due to the collapse of a badfic, where he was accidentally invoked instead of Uriel, and then didn&#39;t get out in time--possibly because he&#39;s not mentioned in SPN canon, possibly because the Laws decided that the Little Mermaid would be more amusing to have onscreen. I&#39;m not really sure--his backstory&#39;s still being written. He does end up in the DMS, though, and then possibly in ESAS, depending on what conclusions I draw from the last few episodes of SPN, among other things. He&#39;s probably going to Fall rather a lot, though.<br><br>Dawn is based loosely on me. She quotes everything that comes into her head, and acts immaturely on missions if she&#39;s around people she trusts to hold her back. She wears crazy nail polish that&#39;s often sparkly, has a pet tribble and two mini-Balrogs, and often gets misfiled missions or is temporarily partnered with people from a different department. She also takes missions in a larger number of fandoms than Ariel, unless he spends several days reading and watching stuff. (In terms of fandoms, from what you listed we share HP and LotR. On the other hand, you wrote &#39;etc&#39;, so it&#39;s quite possible we share several more).<br><br>Also, what gave Avery that ability? And when she regenerates, does she change her appearance, or does it stay the same?<br><br>So...yes. I&#39;d like to offer Agent Ariel and Agent Dawn as potential partners for Agent Avery. Your move :)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I&#39;d love to have Avery work with either Ariel or Dawn, or both. Do you have a preference? <br><br>Avery was given that ability by virtue of being poorly written. &#39;There was a woman, too.

            <p>Wonderful! Uh, depending on when you want Agent Avery to have joined the PPC, she could actually start out working with Dawn, Ariel, and Dawn&#39;s partner (now former), Kozar (he&#39;s a Klingon). Alternatively...well, in the discussion below I saw it mentioned that Avery might do well with someone who isn&#39;t a World One human, so Ariel might be the best option, especially as Dawn seems to do fairly well partnerless and Ariel could really use a partner...so maybe we could try a mission where she&#39;s working with both Dawn and Ariel and then probably switch to just Ariel?

            <p>I didn&#39;t take Avery directly from someone else&#39;s fanfiction. I sort of have in my mind a typical fic that she would have come from. Things get kind of twisty and meta around there. I had an original fanfic for Rowen. But, I never found one for Avery. I just sort of made it up. I wonder if there are rules against that...</p>

            <p>And there aren&#39;t. There&#39;s an article on the wiki- it may be the permission one, or more likely the mission-writing one- that says you can make up where a former badfic character came from but you might get better results if you take them from an actual badfic. My Agent Agen____t comes from an Avengers badfic that I made up (and actually wrote a very short passage from).

            <p>That&#39;s right, because if there was something from an authentic badfic, you have sort-of backstory to draw on, as opposed to... just making it up, I guess. Which is what most people do with backstory for their characters. How is this worse again?<br><br>And oooh, Ariel&#39;s backstory. I was wanting to finish it, and then it got all bogged down with arc words and general messes and me trying to be dramatic and I had to look myself in the face (which is hard to do without a mirror, let me tell you) and say &quot;No, none of that right now! Except maybe the drama. And even that shouldn&#39;t be everywhere, or none of it&#39;s going to look significant!&quot;, and then there were a few weeks where I did absolutely nothing about it. I am ashamed of those weeks and their laziness.<br><br>Anyway, to wrap up, I am going to start writing that backstory again tomorrow afternoon. I have been on my hiatus for too long. Too long, I say!<br><br>Oh, hello, Cedarcopse. Nice to see you again. Yes, I am writing Ariel&#39;s backstory, even though he&#39;s technically DawnFire&#39;s character and was created as a byproduct of one of Lily Winterwood&#39;s missions. It&#39;s not as complicated as it sounds, so it&#39;ll hopefully all make sense in the end.<br>You can pre-read what I have already if you like, since Dawn seems to be edging toward letting you use Ariel as Avery&#39;s partner, and also to see if what I have already is good or not. I already know I&#39;m going to need substantial rewriting on the beginning scenes at least, on account of one OOC archangel and a second archangel acting out another&#39;s canon-typical behavior in said scenes, so if you want to see it, let the concrit fly.</p>

            <p>You co-write Avery and Dawn/Ariel&#39;s missions with Cedarcopse, or you co-write the rest of the backstory with me?<br>Because if it&#39;s the second one, I&#39;ve already almost got it done solo.

            <p>Forgive me if I seem a bit thick in asking this, but what sort of responses are you looking for this topic? Are you looking for someone who will co-write with you, some ideas for creating a partner to write alongside Avery, or for someone to give a character to you to work with, or possibly some combination of those? Just to clarify.<br><br>Also, a few questions of my own.<br><br>What is Avery? Species, continuum of origin, etcetera. The name sounds human, but non-humans can be known to use human names in certain continua, so I&#39;m not sure.<br><br>Her semi-immortality is likely a side effect of her bit character origins, but what exactly caused it? Being unable to die isn&#39;t exactly on the same level as growing a third arm or impromptu teleportation in terms of Word World errors. Was there a particularly dire typo, was she caught up in something, was there a Suvian experiment that went horribly wrong, some fourth thing?<br><br>What do you mean, &quot;consuming&quot; the Words? Does she snatch them out of the air and physically consume them? Is it a &quot;join me, be part of my power&quot; deal, and she fuses with them? Do they enter into her body through her skin? Does she drain the material of reality from a badfic? I&#39;m just trying to see mentally what this would look like.<br><br>What does this do to the Word World she&#39;s in when she saps Words from it? Since a story is held up by its Words, wouldn&#39;t consuming them distort it in some way?<br><br>What does the regeneration process do to her? Is her old body converted into a new body, do the Words build her a new body/rebuild her old one, or do the details just depend on the circumstances of the damage she&#39;s trying to regenerate from?</p>

            <p>Yes, I&#39;m looking for someone to co-write with. Or, if no one is interested, a character that needs a home. <br><br>Avery is technically human. She&#39;s the result of only being mentioned in two sentences: There was a woman, too. But, she didn&#39;t die, yet. <br><br>Avery can&#39;t consume just any World Words. She&#39;s not that powerful. She can only take things like extraneous commas, redundant adjectives, and words that aren&#39;t necessary to the sentence.<br><br>What happens depends on the kind of words that are used. If they come from description, she might temporarily gain detail to herself and a dress with rubies and diamonds sewn into the cloth might just turn into a dress with rubies in the cloth. Actions would alter her mood. Although, she&#39;s always grumpy after regeneration. The Words rebuild her old body, instead of giving her a new one. Basically, the details depend on the situation. </p>

            <p>When I imagine agent pairs, my mind jumps to some form of opposite in behavior or physical appearance. In this case, it seems that Avery is a form of blank slate, a Generic Female Human if you will. Therefore, I would craft a character that is very dynamic, perhaps of a fantastic race from another world. I cannot co-write with anyone at the moment, but I can come up with a character if you want. All I need to know is what department she is going to work in.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll be available if you change your mind.<br><br>I&#39;m interested in seeing where this ends up. An Agent that warps reality, even a Sue&#39;s reality, to feed and heal, changing in the process, would raise several interesting points, especially since Sues feed on reality in a similar way, but by creating flowery prose and pointless asides instead of destroying them. Since Avery shares some characteristics with her quarry, but opposes it in other ways, such as lack of description as opposed to over-description, she could effectively be a foil for the commoner sorts of Sue if taken in a particular way.</p>

            <p>So I&#39;m interested to see where it goes as well. Is it the powers that make Mary-Sues Mary-Sues, or is it more the attitude? I&#39;d like to explore that a lot, since one might say she&#39;s edging towards Suedome in her own way. Although, her litmus test comes back as a solid non-sue. </p>

            <p>She absorbs pieces of the world around her, changing and adapting based on what she consumes. Based only on that sentence, she sounds less like a human and more like a vorcha or some otherworldly horror from the plane that spawned Vom the Hungering. Or like <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2013/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyman_(DC">Everyman</a>. She actually sounds a lot more like Everyman than a vorcha. They can only adapt once.<br><br>As for the bit with whether the powers or the attitude make a Sue, my opinion would edge more toward the latter. You can have a character far more overpowered than Sues tend to be, and have them be non-Sues, just based on their persona. Sues have vast cosmic powers, and never use them like a person would. They use them to ingrain themselves in the lives of others, change their personalities so that the Sue can get her way, and act as though they always behaved that way.<br><br>Non-Sues with vast power behave like a person would behave with those powers, and act or react realistically regardless of the powers. Q and Doc Scratch are omnipotent, and they aren&#39;t Stuish by most standards, because they act the part.<br><br>Perhaps an even closer parallel is Spider, from Neil Gaiman&#39;s book Anansi Boys. He&#39;s got Aura of Smooth (though it&#39;s not called that in-story, for obvious reasons) of an absolutely ridiculous level, he can teleport, he has various unexplained empathic connections, and he&#39;s related to an ex-deity, but he realizes the problems inherent to his divine traits, faces problems that he can&#39;t handle using his abilities alone, and at some points is even guilty about using his Aura of Smooth to change people&#39;s personalities. He&#39;s not a Stu even though he has literal godly power, especially since when you read the sections from his point of view, he&#39;s actually a believable and somewhat likable character, though in a different way than most.<br><br>Sues don&#39;t behave believably, the reader is given no reason to care about them, they use their Aura of Smooth to warp reality and strip away everything about it they dislike, and in the process, make the canon they defile look less interesting. At that point, any other Suvian abilities are, to invoke a slang term, just gravy.<br><br>But that&#39;s my viewpoint, anyway. Others will have their own, and most likely not go on about Neil Gaiman&#39;s works quite as much while saying it.</p>

            <p>The idea that she&#39;s an otherworldly horror in the form of a generic human female is intriguing. I also like the idea that she has far reaching, horrible powers, but has no idea how to use them and wouldn&#39;t want to, anyway. In that way, she&#39;s similar to my other &#39;generic human female&#39; agent, Rowen--who was made to wait forever by a Mary-Sue. Literally. <br><br>I guess that makes them horrors created by &#39;Sues due to bad writing. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m reading American Gods right now, and intend to read Anansi Boys right after, though I might get distracted by Neverwhere, or rereading Sandman, or really anything else.

            <p>Oh, Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite authors, period. I&#39;ve always enjoyed, to quote an obscure character from an obscurer canon, places dark and places strange, and he creates such places so well. You should read his short story collections, too. I own Fragile Things, and it is awesome.<br><br>Okay, as to the relationship between the two... that&#39;s where the complication I mentioned comes in. See, nominally it&#39;s a sequel, but the only character that shows up in both is Mr. Nancy, and it may not even be the same Mr. Nancy. In the American Gods continuum, gods have multiple iterations for each new location their believers sacrificed to them or told stories about them or what have you in, and it&#39;s never exactly made clear whether the Mr. Nancy in Anansi Boys is the American Anansi from American Gods or the British Anansi. The Mr. Nancy in here lives in Florida, but since he&#39;s part of and about as powerful as the British iteration of the West African pantheon that shows up in later parts of the book, he could be either, and it&#39;s never really elaborated on.<br>He&#39;s described similarly in both books, but the Mr. Nancy of Anansi Boys acts a bit differently than he did in American Gods. As a counterpoint, Mr. Nancy in American Gods mentions a son, which could be Fat Charlie from the way he&#39;s described, but could just as easily be someone else.<br><br>Still, divine powers operate the same way, it&#39;s got a similar tone and structure, and the Backstage appears again with a new location, the Caves at the Beginning of the World that house the West African pantheon, so it&#39;s still the same continuum. The events of American Gods aren&#39;t mentioned by anyone, but that&#39;s probably because most of the story takes place in Britain, and Wednesday never went that far when he was recruiting the unworshipped gods.<br><br>And no, you weren&#39;t rambling. That last post was all of four sentences. It takes a lot more than that to be rambling about something.</p>

            <p>Come to think of it, when you start a sentence with an apostrophe, are you supposed to also capitalize the letter after it, or does the apostrophe count as a capitalized letter?

And confusing, but it makes a perfect amount of sense anyways. So: same continuum, but otherwise practically no contact?<br><br>And that&#39;s good.

            <p>In fact, the MMAA is probably going to become a non-mission oriented side spin-off, much like SeaTurtle has done with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1-DB404M-C1J_Qhtptg_HYAwfwajC7iLonVlBaxzZW8k">(Un)Intelligence</a>.<br><br>I still have my notes for Sigma&#39;s adoption, so that&#39;ll be coming your way at some point too.

            <p>And all from that one mission too - that was a <i>lot</i> of misspellings. <br><br>Yeah, I&#39;m working on the text for a mini-Mogget page, but it didn&#39;t really seem necessary until I&#39;d got this up. The mini page should be going up sometime this weekend. <br><br>Out of interest, does it still look like that space that you mentioned needs to be inserted? I went back to the original document to look at it, but my laptop and Google Docs frequently disagree on exactly where my cursor is, making small edits like that frustratingly difficult. Anyway, long story short, after deleting a couple of other characters by accident, I was able to get it back to what I think was actually its original state, and there is a space between the words. The gap does look a little small, but that&#39;s just a distortion from the italics. <br><br>I&#39;m glad you thought it was good.  </p>

            <p>I have ironically noticed the large amount of distortions of the original fae myths. The average member of Homo sapiens belive that if fairies were real, they&#39;de be like Tinkerbell, specificaly the recent CGI movies involving her. A lesser number recall that originaly, the fae were psychopaths, with no concept of empathy, and had to be appeased regularly to prevent them from wreaking havoc on your farm, and destroying your livelyhood for the fun of it. In many myths, if they weren&#39;t forcing you to dance until your legs were worn to stumps, or turning poor unfortunants to hedges, they would do whatever the heck they wanted to your barn animals. I find it refreshing when a canon depicts the Fae as they were originaly depicted. Utterly alien. Any feedback on this?</p>

            <p>Holly Black usually portrays the fae as bloody and amoral. The Poison Eaters is an anthology with a good amount of pretty nightmarish faeries, as is her trilogy Tithe, Valiant and Ironside. The Tithe trilogy (especially Ironside) is interesting because it shows the differences between the Seelie and Unseelie Courts without &#39;humanizing&#39; either side. Valiant can be read as a stand alone and has little to do with the plot of Tithe or Ironside, but Tithe should be read before Ironside. </p>

            <p>One is Magic: the Gathering. If you look up the creature type faerie, you&#39;ll end up with lots of cards that disrupt the flow of the game.

            <p>There needs to be a Fairy-type Pokйmon like this. I don&#39;t even care which type of classic fae, just at least one of them. I remember at least one species that came out of hiding in winter to freeze people solid because it thought it was fun. That would make a good Pokйmon. It would go well with the numerous Ghost-types and Psychic-types that steal or devour people&#39;s souls.</p>

            <p>That would be frostlass. It was based off of a Japanese ghost that would do just the same thing. They should make some legendaries based off the Seelie, and Unseelie court. Both fairy type, but one dark/fairy, the other pure fairy.</p>

            <p>(hands over the mini-Rayquaza frostlass)<br>From the looks of it, Froslass&#39;s mythological inspiration is more like an ice-based will-o-the-wisp, drawing people off their paths and making them lost so that they die of hypothermia, and then dragging off their frozen corpses. Still creepy, but not the same thing. It might be close enough to prevent a Pokйmon based on that particular fae, though, which makes me a bit disappointed.<br><br>What, one Pokйmon based on an entire fae organization? How would they pick which member best represents the entire group? Still, though, Dark/Fairy would make an interesting type combination. We&#39;ll have to wait until the reveal of what Fairy-type&#39;s weaknesses and resistances to see if it&#39;s any good or not.<br><br>When I looked for another good example of a folklore fae, I found that a lot of them tended to be water-based or associated with water, like Ondine or the selkie. If the mythological inspiration follows, there are going to be a lot of Water/Fairy-types, which makes retconning Marill into that type combination even more confusing than it already was.<br>Oh, a good Fire/Fairy could be Nain Rouge, a gnome-like creature resembling a horned monkey that shoots fire out of its eyes and delights in arson and getting back at people. I can see a very effective move set from that concept. Plus, Pokйmon&#39;s always needed a move that gives the user heat vision.<br><br>Wikipedia is a lot of fun, but now I&#39;ve got three tabs open on Celtic mythology, one on the races of giants in Dungeons and Dragons, and another on the Elder Gods of the Cthulhu Mythos. Knowing me, one of them is eventually going to be about some obscure comic book character or an East European country with a name that&#39;s fun to say out loud. Well, back to my Wiki Walk.</p>

            <p>Since you definitely <i>can&#39;t</i> do the 17th, and since I don&#39;t recall much interest in the 27th July, are people more favourably inclined towards August 10th, or August 31st? I seem to recall a general feel that later in the month would be better - the only problem we might have with that is that we&#39;ll probably be moving house around then, and might have to do something complicated to do with keys or something on that Saturday. So we might be more inclined towards August 10th.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Do to having previously found small roleplay threads on this very board, I shall attempt to create on as a parody of the race to the finish treasure hunts that occasionaly crop up in media.<br><br>On a nondescript, rather generic stock island in the pacific, on a latitude that should not exist, a hut made of generic surface rose out if white, quartz derived sand. It was in front of a coconut palm that had no relevance to this story other than as a peice of scenery. In the generic hut was a significantly more important collection of items. Mostly maps, and compasses. It also contained a floor show featuring scantily clad ladies, but they would be gone long before anything that could oogle at them would show up. In a room with faded brown walls, a conservativly dressed stereotypical englishman was wearing a somber suit, looking out through a crater in the wall at the surf. He was waiting for a motley crew of guests who had been summoned by a unknown force who knew the power of money. Somewhere on the island, in one of its predictable biomes that always seemed to crop up on generic tropical islands was a treasure beyond beliving. He was there to hand out maps, and watch various vehicles the visitors would use to reach the island. Through the crater in the wall, Reginald could see a plume of spray. He sighed, and then politely asked the author to refer to him as either &#39;him&#39;, or &#39;he&#39;. The author complied. The english man currently refered to as he opened a door that sprung into being for the purpose of letting in the guests. Said door was a generic gray slab, but its color was irrelevant, and the plot unfolded without it. Mr.He, as the englishman prefered to be called, opened the door loudly. This knocked a few commas from the rafters that didn&#39;t exist, and they slotted into place in the areas where said commas thought they ought to go. Oblivious to the intresting event, Mr.He propped said door open as the first of many walked, through the entrance into this minefield of a paragraph.</p>

            <p>As he finished the arrangements for the contestants&#39; arrival, Reginald He could hear a distant sound prefacing the first of those allegedly lucky few. With the door open, Mr. He could see that the vehicle was an ungainly-looking thing, with what he suspected were likely a few more propellers than it actually needed to get around. It landed, displacing a large quantity of the beach&#39;s looser sand as it did so, and several of the lights on the front part of the craft switched off with a click.<br><br>A rectangular hatch opened up in the bottom of the craft, releasing the sort of descent ramp that even the finest of alien-encounter movies hadn&#39;t been able to make look stylish, and a faint purplish light could be seen from the inside. This glow was quickly eclipsed by the contestant, who scuttled out of the craft with a speed and motivation familiar to those that have seen small children vacating a minivan at a roadside rest stop. The walkway retracted with a deep whooshing sound as the ship&#39;s former inhabitant moved toward the hut.<br><br>The contestant stretched its eight mechanical-armored legs for a few seconds before walking through the door, which Mr. He had kept patiently propped open throughout this entire sequence, despite the fact that doing so had probably let in at least a half-dozen of the island&#39;s prodigious population of flies. Mr. He knew very well how important it was to put across the impression of being an excellent host.<br><br>Now that the contestant had moved into good light, Mr. He could see that it was a roughly human-sized scorpionlike creature, either black in color or one of the variations of blue or purple that looks black at first glance. In place of the traditional arachnid exoskeleton, the contestant had been outfitted with mechanical parts, possibly because of the weight and oxygen exchange problems that a scorpion exoskeleton would have when scaled up.<br><br>The newcomer reached into one of the numerous small bags it had strapped to its body, pulling out a book entitled &quot;How to Speak to Humans: Volume II of VI&quot;. The cover featured an exuberant-looking sunglasses-wearing man set against an ugly green background and posed in a manner common to corporate mascots or the terminally confused. The scorpionlike being looked between its book and the host, turning a few pages with its enormous claws before it spoke.<br><br>&quot;<i>DUUUUDE!</i>&quot; it began, its voice treating the U sound as a low drone. It flipped to the next page with its claw as Mr. He blinked in confusion. &quot;Such a truly righteous avenue you set up for us, bro! I&#39;m totally psyched for the quest, and all the complete <i>rad action</i> that entails!&quot; It paused, looking up at Mr. He with off-white eyes narrowed slightly in thought.<br>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; it continued, its voice dropping from its previous excited shout to a quieter humming sound. &quot;But is there a human slang word for &#39;entails&#39;? It&#39;s not in the book, you see, but it really doesn&#39;t sound like something humans would <i>say</i>, if you catch my meaning. I suppose I could use &#39;goes with&#39;, but that isn&#39;t a complete sentence. Do humans speak in incomplete sentences on occasion? I&#39;m new at this, if you didn&#39;t notice.&quot;</p>

            <p>(( A couple of notes first:<br><br>1. Since this isn&#39;t specified in the rules [are there rules?], I&#39;m asking that no one else write my characters&#39; actions, dialogue, thoughts, etc. If TFM wants to open a pit under their feet or shoot poisoned darts at them or whatever for plot reasons, I promise I&#39;ll play fair with their reactions.

If one looked directly at it, it would appear to hover, unchanging, but if one looked away for a few minutes and then back again, it would become clear that it was getting bigger. It was making a bee-line for the island. Gradually, it resolved itself into a silhouette with wings, horns, and a tail. At last, a dark blue and purple dragon with two riders touched down on the shore, kicking up whirlwinds of sand with each downbeat of his wings.<br><br>The first rider, a short woman in reddish, light leather armor and a helmet with tall helical horns, immediately vaulted to the ground. A large spiked mace hung at her side. Under the helmet, her hair was dark red and pulled back into a fat braid, and her eyes were a piercing bright blue. She looked about her eagerly. &quot;Yup, this is it! Good work, Snerri!&quot; She gave the Monstrous Nightmare a pat on the neck.<br><br>Her companion took a moment to remove his heavy flight jacket before dismounting. Underneath, he wore a light blue shirt with loose sleeves and laces down the chest. He was much taller than she was, darker-skinned and black-haired. His most notable feature (besides a passing resemblance to Gerard Butler) was the lacy network of scars that covered the right side of his face, distorting his expression into a constant half-grimace. His right eye was blind and had a milky-blue color while the other was hazel. He appeared less than impressed with his current situation.<br><br>&quot;And you told me there was no way out of Headquarters,&quot; the woman said, grinning at him. &quot;Come on, old man! Adventure awaits!&quot; She started toward the hut.<br><br>&quot;I still think this is a bad idea,&quot; he replied, trudging after her. &quot;You never told me where you got the information about this &#39;treasure hunt&#39; and <i>what</i> in the land, sea, or sky is <i>that</i>?&quot; He had spotted the large arachnoid being through the rather singed-looking hole in the hut&#39;s wall. (What had impacted there to cause it, who knew?) He stopped short, and his hand went immediately to the sledgehammer that hung from his belt.<br><br>The Viking woman paused, sizing up the stranger, then shrugged and continued on her way. &quot;Competition, probably. Snerri can take it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I hope you&#39;re right,&quot; the man muttered, and followed her without taking his hand from his weapon.</p>

            <p>On the horizon, a large plume of spray appeared. Said plume was not being caused by, say, a propeller or anything. It was being made by a special spout who&#39;s sole purpose was to kick of a jaunty spray of blue water. The craft it was attached to was a large chinese junk, beautifuly crafted, and seemingly etheral. Less etheral was the large mongoose wearing a stained urple vest, as well as a bleen tricorn hat. He was currently belting out the lyrics to Billy Joel&#39;s song, Stiletto. This song was not meant to be sung in a rocky baritone at the top of one&#39;s lungs, and consequently did not sound good. The mongoose pirate knockoff seemed to remember that he was sailing in a boat which was starting to tilt. <br>Strapping a rather un-piratelike portable anti-G disc to his back, the mongoose dropped a match through the gaping hole in the junk&#39;s deck, and jumped fifteen feet in the air, aided by his anti-G disc. The explosion blew his the remaining distance to shore, and he let out an elated whoop. His anti-G disc fizzled, then popped before he hit the sand. A few feet of water broke his fall, and after he spit up a gallon of seawater, the mongoose pirate waded to shore, the swaggered up to the beach hut. Ignoring Mr.He, the mongoose leaped through the crater in the wall, wrung out his hat, and adressed all present. &quot;Are yew sorry bunch all that is gonna come? Then that treasure is already mine lads!&quot; He noticed the one female in the room, and bowed apologeticaly at her. &quot;And, lasses.&quot; The mongoose got down an all fours, and shook himself, sending water from his grey fur everywhere. He then sat down on a chair that had formed out of ambient moisture, and pointed out the floorshow that supposedly had already left.</p>

            <p>(( In my experience, if something happens to all the PCs, each player writes their own character(s)&#39;s response(s). Some characters might be able to jump out of the way, some might try to help another first, some just might not be so lucky that day. Since it&#39;s not polite for even the guy running the game to control people&#39;s characters without first telling them that&#39;s the kind of game it is, I&#39;m assuming that applies here.<br><br>Also, to avoid overlap and confusion in the future, it helps to keep an extra tab open and refresh right before you post to make sure nothing happened while you were typing. Also helps to be able to refer back to all the crazy shenanigans while formulating a reply, which I will be doing a lot, I can tell you. This is quite possibly the crackiest RP I&#39;ve ever been in. You picked a heck of a way to start!<br><br>And now to go play catch-up with all the IC events that happened while I was away doing RL stuff.<br><br>~Neshomeh ))</p>

Tumbleweeds usually do this in situations involving barren wastelands or sudden silences. Exactly why is unknown, though the frequency of these appearances suggests a sort of sentience among tumbleweedkind, or possibly even a connection to a lesser-known Narrative Law of the sort that causes crickets to chirp when someone in the room cracks an unfunny joke.<br><br>The tumbleweed that entered the room upon the forced expulsion of Mindless Goon #17, however, was not only sentient, but sapient, and not only a tumbleweed, but a Tumbleweed. Its name was Weed Thirty-Seven, and it was just about as confused as everyone else. Unlike the others, however, it did not mingle. It decided to get some answers.<br><br>You wouldn&#39;t think that a five-foot Tumbleweed would be able to move past a small crowd of people without raising some eyebrows, but of that crowd, several had seen mobile plants before and found the addition of another no big deal, a few hadn&#39;t been looking over at the singed hole in the wall when Weed Thirty-Seven came in, and the others were too focused on the fight to hear anything but the rustling of its dry stems as it moved along the floor.<br><br>Slipping behind the piratical mongoose, who had not moved since he he had last sat down and may have fallen asleep, the Tumbleweed moved into the adjoining room, finding Mr. He at a small pentagonal table organizing a large pile of overly browned and wrinkly-looking treasure maps into smaller and more manageable piles. The host of the treasure hunt looked up, acknowledged the new arrival with a nod, and went back to sorting.<br><br><i>What is this place?</i> Weed Thirty-Seven asked, moving closer to the table. Mr. He crossed his arms over the maps before answering, conveniently hiding their contents in the process.<br><br>&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter where we are or what we are,&quot; Mr. He replied. &quot;What matters is what we are doing, and the manner in which we choose to do it.&quot;<br><br><i>That did not answer my question.</i> Weed Thirty-Seven pointed out. Mr. He shrugged.<br><br>&quot;Sometimes if I&#39;m cryptic enough, people don&#39;t press further.&quot; He picked up one of the piles of maps, inspected it briefly, and placed it back in the table. &quot;The hunt will begin soon. You are among the last to arrive. I had intended for other contestants, but it appears that there will not be as many as I scheduled. I hope the absentees are all right.&quot; he intoned in a voice that implied that he did not much care one way or the other. &quot;Now, if you would be so kind as to go stand by the rest, all of your questions will be answered.&quot;<br><br><i>Will they really?</i> asked Weed Thirty-Seven.<br><br>&quot;Not really. In actuality, it&#39;s far more likely that your next few minutes will raise at least two new ones.&quot; Mr. He reached for the pile of maps closest to him, placing them in his briefcase with one hand as he stacked the remaining maps with the other. &quot;Either way, it&#39;s best we get started. We have dilly-dallied long enough.&quot;<br><br>((What can I say, I was inspired by your mention of a tumbleweed. Since the events of this RP are non-canon for Neshomeh&#39;s agents, they&#39;ll be non-canon for Thirty-Seven too, since that only makes sense. Weed Thirty-Seven <i>is</i> an established Flower, in case you were wondering, but it&#39;s an extremely minor one. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever even had a line before now.))</p>

            <p><i>What a very specific sort of wink that mongoose just made.</i> remarked Weed Thirty-Seven as it shuffled back into the main room. It settled into a place in the room near the swarm of punctuation marks, which were currently hunting down and devouring some of the large number of flies that had entered through the singed hole in the wall.<br><br>A small robot, which had materialized in the air holding a bowl of licorice gummy bears only to be shoved away by the pirate mongoose, emitted a series of sad beeps.

            <p>Mr. He was ready to explain everything, as the mongoose had picked himself up, and was holding him at swordpoint. He calmly said to the mongoose. &quot;*******.&quot; The symbols represent a short period of activity characterized by foul language, and heavy violence. After said episode was over, Mr. He was ready to talk, and would now have a lifelong phobia of angry mongooses. The scuffle had attracted the attention of everyone in the room, and those who had eyes were staring. Better save face. &quot;You have all been brought here to find a fantastic treasure. You will all notice that maps of the island have appeared in your manipulatory organs. The biomes of the island are arranged in this order: Beach. Rainforest, which will have many deadly unreal creatures, especialy snakes. Desert, which also has many unreal animals. Finaly, in the middle of the island is a enormus spire of obsidian. At the top is the treasure, gaurded by an unknow beast. You shall be in teams for this hunt, otherwise you forfeit. Rimwarst, you and the vikings will be one team. Oh, stop frowning you miserable mongoose! Generic person of high status, you are with Cllllick snerk ctink. Yes, that is the scorpion&#39;s name. Tumbleweed, you are with me, and my exploding duplicates. Let us begin!&quot;</p>

            <p>Mr. He sighed and shook his head as his duplicate made a right fool of himself. How the mongoose had managed to hold a cloud of particles at swordpoint long enough for it to reassemble itself was anyone&#39;s guess, but seeing as said mongoose had managed to make a chair out of ambient moisture earlier, this may have been due to his own manipulatory powers. Why did the duplicate choose to reform? Anyone&#39;s guess, though it may have been due to this copy&#39;s aggressiveness.<br><br>&quot;If you had bothered to read the lists, you would actually know their names, and not need to guess. Only one of the two who arrived on the dragon is a &quot;Viking&quot;, the scorpion&#39;s name is not a stereotypical insect name, and I will not be going on the hunt. I suppose a few of my duplicates may be showing up every once in a while, but they will not be your duplicates. We can&#39;t be going around having duplicates of duplicates. Then one of the duplicated duplicates would duplicate himself, and we would have a mess on our hands.&quot; Mr. He waved a hand, and the duplicate shattered.<br><br>&quot;Good riddance.&quot; Mr. He remarked, rubbing his hands together. He turned to the group, but not before pushing the podium back into the floor. &quot;What my duplicate told you about the island is true, though it may have been because it was most of what he was programmed to know. However, I will allow the teams he formed to stand. Weed Thirty-Seven, you can go with some of the Goons, because my double will not be joining you.&quot;<br><br>((temporal fax machine, you really shouldn&#39;t be naming my character without my consent, or doing other things of the sort. It&#39;s even worse than assuming its actions. Either way, it looks as though the hunt is on.))<br><br></p>

            <p>The one-eyed man was not expecting to be approached by a large bug-monster immediately upon setting foot in the hut. He stopped short as his partner continued blithely on her way around the room. He reflexively recoiled from the claw stuck out at him, turning his head slightly so that the creature was squarely in view of his left eye, and he loosened his hammer in its loop.<br><br>And then the thing talked.<br><br>He understood about half the words, and it took a moment for those to sink in. &quot;You want to know my name?&quot; he asked slowly, trying out the idea. It still made sense once he&#39;s said it aloud, and he figured any potential clawing and goring would have happened by now if it were going to, so he surrendered to the bizarre situation. &quot;All right. Derik, Agent Derik. Um.&quot; He tentatively took the thing&#39;s clawtip and shook.<br><br>And that was about when the first Mr. He got up on stage, shouted at them, and blew up, which was a conversation killer if ever there was one.<br><br>&quot;How rude,&quot; Derik remarked, slightly stunned.<br><br>Meanwhile, his partner had her own problems. Random explosions aside, she didn&#39;t take kindly to being shoved, much less being leered at shortly thereafter, by a walking fur coat. She narrowed her eyes at the creature, and suddenly, her mace was in her hands.<br><br>&quot;Hey, fuzzy! If you want out of this thing early, all you gotta do is say so. I will put you down right now.&quot; In the classic threatening gesture of low-lifes with bludgeoning weapons, she bounced the haft of the mace against the palm of one hand.</p>

            <p>The small cloud of particals buzzed annoyingly. &quot;Well, some named that was supposed to show up! You weren&#39;t the only robot scorpion on the list, and how was I supposed to know!&quot; It kept wheedling until it finaly fizzed out of existence. Frankly, the ruddy thing got what it deserved, mangleing all the rules. The cloud of commas decided that now would be a good time to further complicate things. They swarmed in, making dozens of half shaped Mr. He duplicates that shouted incoherently. Some of them started brawling, others were insulting guests, while quite a few were shouting random things like, &quot;Ba,nanna!&quot; Or, &quot;Pi,ckle!&quot; The resulting chaos was infuriating. The real Reginald He shouted above the din. &quot;Start your search! I&#39;ll be getting rid of these wretched comma duplicates!&quot; This hopefuly would spur the contestans into movement. Comma duplicates. Wretched little beasts.</p>

I deserve a little respect lass!&quot; He was fuming now, his face turning bright red under his fur, and said fur wasn&#39;t fuzzy. It was long, and coarse. The mongoose pirate yanked an enormus machine gun from hammerspace, and yanked a kantana out of its barrel, before discarding the gun. &quot;Aye, lass. Yew want ta go? To the &#39;alf death right &#39;ear!&quot; <br><br>The mongoose was not stupid. Stupid mongooses die swiftly, and therefore do not pollute the genepool with stupidity. But the mongoose pirate, or Rimwarst Dayonal Mastikill if you wanted to know his full name, was very quick to anger. At first, he wanted skewer the viking who had a horned helm, when real vikings did not. Then he turned to Mr. He for violence. Striding up, Rimwarst grabbed He by the neck, and shoved his kantana against his chest. &quot;Yew got seven minutes to sort out our maps, tell us what the &#39;ell is goin&#39; on, and send us off afore I gut ya!&quot; He was fully meaning to keep his threat. Familiarity breds bloody contempt, and he was sick of this gathering. </p>

            <p>Mindless Goon #17, having unbound himself from the stampeding horse, averted his attention from his less-than-furtive creep towards the pie pantry and gazed with mingled interest and confusion as the piratical mongoose somehow managed to pick a fight with the Viking impersonator, Mr. He, and his boss all at once. The GCMOHS staggered, rudderless, around the room, hefting weighty blows at contestants, comma duplicates, and scantily clad showgirls alike. The word &quot;varmint&quot; was tragically abused and slunk off into a corner to lick its wounds.<br>Outside, #10 exploded with a muffled &#39;poof&#39; and a twinkle of searing urple flame. Dimly #17 concluded that the goons must also be duplicates of some sort, and hoped that he would be the original goon and not one of the ones to unexpectedly detonate. Then again, being seventeenth out of twenty-one, statistics did not look promising for him.  That rhubarb pie, on the other hand, appeared very promising indeed.<br>His being partnered with a sentient (and sapien) Tumbleweed struck Mindless Goon #17 as a bit odd, but considering the company surrounding him, he supposed stranger things could have happened. And worse things as well, such as if that biomechanical scorpion thing had been on his team. He knew as well as any cowboy hero that scorpions were to be avoided at all costs, and he&#39;d always had something of a debilitating phobia of all things steampunk after the Incident.<br>&quot;So, uh, we goin&#39; to the big rock or what?&quot; drawled the minion finally, keeping the scorpion under marginally close surveillance out of the corner of his glazed brown eyes.</p>

            <p>The pirate mongoose knew when he&#39;d been beat. The fact that several punctuation marks had beaten him was not something he was trying to think about. He was attempting to drag the viking, and the non-viking out of the hut, before everyone got a head start. &quot;C&#39;mon yew! If we don&#39;t git outta &#39;ear, we&#39;ll lose!&quot; He then jumped through the crater in the wall, and swaggered out to the beach. &quot;Ha! Unreal beasties beatin&#39; me! Never, I say!&quot; He then heard a thud behind him, accompanied by a spray of sand. His smile was still the rougish grin of before, but very much fake. He continued swaggering, very cautiously while resisting the urge to turn around. However, a large crustacean leg alerted him to what was behind him.<br><br>He swiftly turned, hoping the giant leg was some sort of prank. A briney gargle told him it was not. Rather, behind him was a giagantic blue crab. It seemed like something out of a crab catchers nightmare, but the worst part was the dull malevolent intelligence in its ugly coal like eyes. In stead of wondering what biological processes could produce such a behemoth, he did some thing else. &quot;Aaaaaahhhhhhh!&quot; The mongoose yelled as he broke into a run not unlike Jack Sparrow. He latched onto his teamate&#39;s arms, and attempted to drag them into the jungle, while a giant crab chased after him. When he heard leviathan breaching, the mongoose tried very hard not to die. After he was forty feet into the jungle, Rimwarst the amazing piratic mongoose checked to see if his group was still with him.</p>

How he managed to accomplish both at once is yet another of life&#39;s strange mysteries, many of which had been brought to light in that little cottage. &quot;Yah!&quot; the GCMOHS barked, digging his heels into the flanks of a rather surprised looking rabid mare, who had Apparated into the room, and with that he bounded through the still-smoking hole and out onto the beach without waiting for the rest of his team. The Mindless Goons continued their appreciative nods and awestruck murmurs for an unreasonable length of time after he had vanished, until at last #8 piped up.<br>&quot;I think...

            <p>Zeltar walked up behind the dumbstruck Mindless Goons, shifting its feet in indecisiveness. Despite all its efforts, it couldn&#39;t find any description of humans in his book that matched them. They were close to four or five possible variations on humanity, but weren&#39;t close enough to any to pinpoint a definitive option. The scorpionlike being shrugged, deciding that it would switch back to human lingo if necessary, but for now, it would use its normal speaking voice.<br><br>&quot;Not quite yet, I&#39;m afraid!&quot; Zeltar piped up, causing a few of the Goons to turn and stare at it. &quot;Not every team is going in the same direction! It appears that each team has been given a similar but notably different map, judging chiefly from a few surreptitious looks I had over a few shoulders, and in one case, through quite a lot of what I&#39;m guessing was bramble. I dearly hope that I wasn&#39;t in violation of social cues in that last case, but that&#39;s outside the point, as you may have guessed.&quot;<br><br>Zeltar unfolded its map, pointing with a claw to a spot marked with a §. &quot;It appears that in our case, the treasure, or at least the path to said treasure, will be located in the rainforest dome.&quot;<br>It reached into one of its numerous packs, exchanging the map for what appeared to be a combination of a magnetometer and a pocket version of the board game Battleship.<br>&quot;It is possible that, provided he does not misplace himself along the way, your employer, if I may assume such a relationship between yourselves and the man who has so recently absconded with the teleporting equine, may meet up with us at some point, or one of us may serendipitously run into the other.&quot; It looked at several of the Mindless Goons at once in a sweeping gesture of its metal-encased eyes. &quot;Shall we go?&quot;</p>

            <p>Mindless Goon #17 chose that moment to conveniently choke on his pie, and #3 displayed an unexpected aptitude for performing CPR, although one might complain that he used a few more Band-Aids than was strictly necessary. When that unpleasant ordeal had been resolved, #17 grinned dopily and shoved a few extra pies into his ultra-flattering fanny pack.<br>&quot;Now,&quot; announced #14 in a melodramatic stage whisper, &quot;we ride.&quot;<br>No one moved for a long moment, until #19 and #20, in perfect unison, blew up.

The biomechanical scorpion raised an eyebrow, metaphorically speaking, and at long last the ragtag crew departed the now scorched and bloodied cottage, nickering and scuttling over the sand towards the distant emerald smudge of the jungle.</p>

            <p>((Which of the Goons are in this group, and how many are with Weed Thirty-Seven? On another question, how many of the Goons are left in their initial states, without having exploded, caught fire, or suffered from other casualties? I may need the number of people in the groups for later.))<br><br>As the group of what could largely only be called adventurers due to the lack of a better word grew closer to the jungle, a faint whirring sounded from somewhere in the skies above them. Zeltar looked up, scanning the skies in three different light patterns for potential threats, but the source of the strange noise had put into action the foolproof ages-old evasion technique of hiding behind things.<br>Zeltar made a mental note to check and see if he could install some sort of X-Ray vision enhancement to its ocular technology, and a second mental note to see if the X-Ray technology had any infuriating weaknesses first. There was nothing worse than installing a new modification only to find out later that it didn&#39;t work around a certain kind of metal or that the presence of the color purple would confuse and enrage it.<br><br>The Goons were loudly singing a song that Zeltar didn&#39;t recognize, which made it ever more difficult for it to determine what the likely cause of the sound was, which only subtracted processing power from the acts of analysis of the surroundings, possibilities of the treasure, potential threat assessments, and the like.<br>It was so wrapped up in its various thought processes, mental notes, and sub-protocols that it was completely surprised by the appearance of the wall of the rainforest dome in front of it. Though the jungle was still a ways in the distance, the designer of the treasure challenge had decided for unknown reasons to encase its entirety within a large barrier. If precedent was anything to go by, there would also be either a lava-based or ice-based dome elsewhere on the island, if not both, though neither of those were currently relevant and... Zeltar realized with a start that its pause had lasted longer than expected. Some of the Goons were looking at it in confusion, though one had a distant expression that suggested either drowsiness or concussion.<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; Zeltar said, somewhat unnecessarily, &quot;It appears that the initial phase of our quest has reached a conclusion, or at least the outward appearance of one.&quot;<br>It pounded on the wall of the dome with its stinger tail; the barrier shifted slightly, suggesting a less-than-rigid material used in its construction. Zeltar turned to the Goons. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose any of you would happen to have a blasting or cutting implement with you, would you? I could search my packs, but I doubt that what I have would be powerful enough to break through a dome of unknown tensile strength and likely structural resistance.&quot; It rummaged in one of the packs on its chest. &quot;Though I may have a grenade in here somewhere if I haven&#39;t left that container in the ship, as is always possible.&quot;</p>

            <p>((Okay, well 15/21 have thus far escaped explosion. Zeltar&#39;s group should, then, have seven. 1, 3, 8, 13, 14, 15, and 17, shall we say? That leaves 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 18, and 21 for the Tumbleweed, although due to a moment of inattentiveness on my part they seem to have just galloped off without the only member of their party with a fully funcional nervous system. That may be a problem.))<br>&quot;GRENADE!&quot; vociferated Mindless Goon #13, lumbering forward and pumelling the barrier with gorilla-like arms. &quot;BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!&quot; With a pitiful whine not unlike that of a punctured rubber chicken, the wall collapsed into a ring of ubiquitous polymer. #13 grinned and hammered his chest in a way that could be read as smug. #17 offered him a congratulatory slice of rhubarb pie, which #13 politely declined by smashing it into #15&#39;s pasty face and baying with laughter.<br>&quot;I think... I think we can go in now,&quot; said #8.<br>&quot;Now,&quot; said #14, &quot;we ride.&quot;<br>&quot;Does this dialogue sound redundant to you?&quot; said #1. Mindless Goon #3 shrugged and plastered a Band-Aid onto his earlobe. And so the group proceeded with the hunt and another round of &#39;American Pie,&#39; a tune that #17 took particular delight in.</p>

            <p>The whirring sound quickly increased in volume after #13&#39;s efforts sent the nearest of the dome&#39;s segments collapsing to the ground. Zeltar looked up just in time to see a small squad of creatures emerging from the forest ahead of them, the whirring sound from earlier growing even louder as they came closer, propelled through the air by a collection of limb-like structures that formed propellors at the uppermost point on each one&#39;s body.<br>The creatures seemed to largely consist of a massive triangle-shaped cephalothorax, similarv in appearance to a pyramid, but with only three sides rather than four. Each side held a single eye and a lipless mouth, and the majority of those lipless mouths were opened in cries of rage.<br><br>&quot;They broke the dome! The dome is broken now!&quot; shouted one of the creatures, which seemed to be on the verge of hysterics.<br><br>&quot;ERROR: a section of the dome wall has collapsed! Overall efficiency of dome for containment decreased by twelve to fifteen percent! CALCULATING EXACT DAMAGE.&quot; announced a second one of the triangular-headed creatures.<br><br>&quot;Trespassing entities! Cease motion and repair the destruction that you have caused!&quot; shouted a third, who unlike the others seemed to be less affected by the collapsing of the wall and more by the fact that it was done deliberately. It swooped toward them, followed by eight of its brethren. About a dozen more were still flying around the upper reaches of the trees, including the other two speakers, and a continued whirring in the trees suggested that more were coming.<br><br>Zeltar leapt into the air and snapped its claws at one of the attacking creatures. Its left claw gripped his aggressors&#39;s propellor, causing the creature to lose its balance, and with a yelp, it fell to the ground, carrying Zeltar with it. As they hit the ground, the impact knocked open one of the scorpionlike being&#39;s packs, sending assorted small gizmos and curiosities flying onto the grassy ground of the jungle dome.<br><br>Zeltar, taking advantage of the creature&#39;s brief moment of surprise, spread out his limbs and stuck them fast to the ground, attempting to pin the creature before it could get airborne again. Unfortunately, his opponent&#39;s unfamiliar body shape made it difficult for Zeltar to distribute his weight effectively, and the creature easily threw him off, hopping away on a set of previously folded-up pseudopods and glaring at Zeltar.<br><br>&quot;Approximately thirty percent flight efficiency lost as the result of aggressive action!&quot; it snapped. &quot;Launching countermeasures!&quot; Fully extending the psuedopods underneath it, the creature launched itself at Zeltar, positioning itself so that its propellor, which had begun to spin alomst as fast as it had when the creature was airborne, was aimed directly at Zeltar&#39;s head. The scorpionlike being tensed its porganic muscles, pulling up its stinger tail to allow for a quick counterattack once the creature got within range.<br><br>Nearby, four of the nine attacking creatures surrounded the Goons, whirring, hissing, and shouting at varying volumes. The four remaining from the attack party spread out around the eight trespassers, ready to swoop in and back up any one of their fellows that might need it. Two of the inner four, acting on small signals from the others in their party, dove straight for Goon #8.<br><br>((Bluh, sub-par fight scene writing is sub-par. You get the picture, though. Creatures attack! Number and placement of opponents! What do you do?))</p>

            <p>Rimwarst the amazing piratic mongoose had lost his group. He assumed that some sort of beach peril had killed them, meaning that he could still claim the treasure in their stead. He stopped to look at an dome incasing what seemed to be some sort of jungle. The sign attached to the dome read, &#39;Some sort of jungle.&#39; <br><br>That settled it! He was going to have to smash his way in, and by jove he would! He was just about to ram his sword into a small crack when the whole thing vanished. The lack of wall threw the mongoose&#39;s lunge off balance, so he rolled downhill until he hit his head on a banyan tree. Leaping up, the mongoose hit his head again on a overhanging branch. All around him, a stereotyped jungle grew. It was likely modeled after the Amazon rainforest, if the hoatzin was anything to go by. Some feline resmbling an ocelot was nuzzling him. Rimwarst knew that ocelots were just as capable of mauling him as a tiger was, but what the heck? He started petting it, and then it said in a distinctly feminine voice, &quot;Ooh, you are strong.&quot; Rimwarst dropped the ocelot like he&#39;d been bitten. &quot;Aaaaahhhh!&quot; He turned around to see a huge smilodon behind him, also talking. &quot;Whatchoo doin&#39; with my girl!&quot; The mongoose&#39;s response was this. &quot;Aaaaahhhhhh! Again!&quot;<br><br>He quickly ran out of the clearing on all fours, scurrying through the underbrush. He was more scared of the ocelot than the smilodon, but wasn&#39;t to keen on either. Rimwarst curled up under a bush to catch his breath for a while. Well, that was the plan anyways. He then fell into a deep sleep that was only interuppted when he ripped out the throats of various creatures trying to eat him as he slept. After an hour, Rimwarst woke up, and cursed loudly one he realized how long he&#39;d slept. Straiting his tricorn cap, the mongoose set out. He was now perched on a stone carving of a feathered snake head, one of many to jut from the square ruins of some Mayan derived civilization. He pulled out the map Mr. He had given him, and decided to check it. It showed an image of his head, in relation to Ђ, which never always doesn&#39;t mark the spot of treasure. He poked a claw at the ruins on the map, and to his suprise, Mr. He&#39;s voice began explaining the area. &quot;The temple of Featherboactaol. Inhabited by a race of savage beast men who worship the eldritch god Feather- , oh I already told you this! They fear the return of the ultimate evil, the demon Rimswarstical, who manifests as a mongoose with a vest, and hat in impossible colors. In other words, old chap, you are done for.&quot; The message ended in time for Rimwarst to realize he was surrounded by creatures that looked like a cross between man, boar, and bandicoot. They were wearing pelts, and holding obsidian spears. Oh poop. The mongoose looked down at the red clay of the temple, and then at the upper dome. &quot;Help!&quot;</p>

            <p><i> Oh, blast it all. We&#39;re lost, aren&#39;t we?</i> Weed Thirty-Seven asked of no one in particular. It had known that trusting Goons #5-#7 to handle the map had been a bad idea, but the Tumbleweed had always found it incredibly difficult to hold anything with bramble instead of fingers.<br>Subsequently, half of the map had caught fire when Goon #6 had caught fire for no apparent reason, as seemed to be commonplace for whatever species he was, and since Goon #18 had seen fit to put said fire out by shoving the map in his mouth, about one-half of the surviving half was now almost illegible. And, as any experienced treasure-hunter will tell you, one should never go looking for anything when one has only the far right one-fourth of a map.<br>The Goons seemed to be taking the nigh-on destruction of the map and the heavy burns on two of their compatriots rather well, since their spirits seemed high, high enough in Goon #11&#39;s case that he occasionally belted out half-forgotten snatches of songs based on what he had just heard. <br><br>&quot;Oh, we&#39;re lost! Yes, we&#39;re lost! And we can&#39;t feel our fingers! Cause weeee forgot out jackeeets and we&#39;re <i>lost</i>!&quot;<br><br><i>We&#39;re in a blooming jungle, you simpleton.</i> Weed Thirty-Seven muttered. <i>You can&#39;t get cold-induced numbness in a blooming jungle. You&#39;re using that song in an entirely different context than it was originally written for.</i><br><br>Of course, the Tumbleweed had long since given up trying to quiet down the Goons, and was now contenting itself with stating the varied and numerous things that irritated it about their company.<br><br>Suddenly, a loud cry for help from a far to the left briefly drowned out #11&#39;s song. If Weed Thirty-Seven had ears, it would have perked them, and if it ha eyes, they might have narrowed. However, since it had no face, it cut right to the chase and went to go see what was going on.<br><br>On a carving below the bluff that the group was standing on, a pirate mongoose that Weed Thirty-Seven recognized as the one who had assaulted Mr. He&#39;s duplicate at the starting hut was surrounded by marsupial-like humanoids with large wicked-looking facial tusks. For some reason, the creatures appeared to have shaped their weapons entirely out of some sort of vitreous igneous rock, despite the fact that the island had shown no sign of volcanic activity and the creatures didn&#39;t seem the type to go off the island to get it. Weed Thirty-Seven made a mental note to investigate the peculiarity later before turning in the direction of Goons #4 and #5.<br><br><i>We need a map.</i> it stated. <i>This one may </i>have<i> a map. However, it may not match up with </i>our<i> map. What do you say? Do we save him, or let the beast-men have at him and take the map when he&#39;s down? Either way, we get his map, but the first option means we&#39;d need to deal with him the rest of the trip, and the second option means the beast-men are probably going to end up murdering him or sacrificing him or otherwise being fatally unpleasant.</i><br><br>&quot;So...&quot; replied Goon #5, showing the quickness of thought that his people were known for. &quot;We voting?&quot;<br><br><i>Not really.</i> answered Weed Thirty-Seven. <i>I was just going over the options to myself. I honestly wouldn&#39;t trust any one of you to come to a well-thought-out conclusion.</i><br><br>&quot;I resent that remark!&quot; yelled Goon #7, raising his hand in the air. As Weed Thirty-Seven shifted in irritation, he rocked back on his heels and grinned &quot;And I don&#39;t even know what &#39;remark&#39; means. That&#39;s how much I resent it.&quot;<br><br><i>And that is precisely why.</i> Weed Thirty-Seven said, shuffling his stems in irritation.<br><br>With a low <i>whoomph</i>, Goon #6 once again burst into flames, and immediately began shouting and batting at his shirt. Seizing the opportunity, Weed Thirty-Seven nudged the Goon over the edge of the bluff, narrowly avoiding the areas on his body that were producing the oddly-colored flames.<br><br>The vaguely porcine beast-men down below, who had been advancing closer after the mongoose&#39;s shout for help, looked over with a start as the flaming Goon rolled toward them, boggling at the brightly glowing body right up until the moment it exploded. The bright flash of light created by the blast caused many of the beast-men to clutch at their eyes, and several of them stumbled into the undergrowth to escape the human bombs that their demon foe had sent down upon them. The few that remained stared up in the direction that the Goon-bomb had rolled from, and focused quickly on Weed Thirty-Seven. If the Tumbleweed had possessed a face, it would&#39;ve been smirking.<br><br><i>That was an accident.</i> it announced. <i>I saw an opportunity, and I took it.</i> Weed Thirty-Seven&#39;s stems bristled, and one creature uncertainly pointed its quite heavy rock spear at the Tumbleweed. <i>Would you like to see what I can do on purpose?</i></p>

            <p>&quot;I think...&quot; said Mindless Goon #8, as was his wont, while the strange geometric creatures converged on him. &quot;I think these thingies are hostile.&quot; The triangular prisms began to gouge at his exposed skin with surprisingly sharp barbed pseudopods, eliciting a high-pitched squeal of empathy from Goon #1. Under further examination, he was actually imitating a wild hog that had charged from the exotic undergrowth, although none present had the time for such observations. The wild hog, however, got their attention. The seemingly caffeinated creature snorted and careened into the beleagured #8, knocking him flat on his back and dispersing the buzzing cloud of &#39;thingies.&#39; Said &#39;thingies&#39; turned on their new foe with a monotone chorus of &quot;Foreign adversary identified. Mammal. Scientific name: Sus scrofa. Experiencing intense emotions of choler. Danger level: High.&quot;<br>#8 scrabbled in the pale sand, desperately straining to reach #3&#39;s first aid kit.<br>&quot;Get yer grubby paws off, varmint!&quot; cried the self-nominated medic, slapping his hand away. &quot;Dem Band-Aids is mine. Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t see de lust in yer eyes. Mine!&quot; #8 moaned, dejected.<br>Meanwhile, the boar snapped and kicked at the pullulating &#39;thingies.&#39; It struck some of the less idiotic members of the group- namely Zeltar- that such creatures were not usually native to the jungle. Then again, the pyramidal &#39;thingies&#39; could hardly be called common fauna. Mindless Goon #13 belted out a verse of &#39;Gagnam Style&#39; mangled beyond recognition as he bludgeoned pig and unidentified flying object with equal ardor, while #17 fearfully noshed on yet more pie, #3 lovingly caressed his Band-Aid box and murmured something disturbingly Gollum-esque, #8 lay sprawled on the ground with his tongue lolling, and the other Goons made a valiant effort to lodge bullets in their own noses. The scorpion telepathically wagged a claw at the GCMOHS for allowing the pitiful beings to play with revolvers and viciously delved his stinger into a &#39;thingy&#39; for twisted compensation. Or perhaps it was simply self defense.</p>

            <p>Rimwarst looked up at the buzzing pyramids. It wasn&#39;t his concern at the moment, and they only seemed interested in the other contestants, not him. However, the marsupial beast creatures were running away in fear. The mongoose knew this was known as a bad sign, and the things were probaly worse than anything else he&#39;d come across on the blasted island. He did not run as things as they swarmed him, but held his ground nobley. One flying pyramid looked at him with a bloodshot, yet somehow wilver eyeball disapprovingly. &quot;Subject is a adult Herpestese ichneumon. It is currently releasing stored waste.&quot; It zipped over to one of its comrades, and they conversed in a strange language that seemed to be composed of buzzing, and the word crumpet.<br><br>The strange geometric being spiraled over, then examined Rimwarst with each of its eyes in turn, and then sniffed him with its orifices located below the eyes. Rimwarst had decided that the creatures were computers for no particular reason, and was going to guess some command. &quot;Oy! Yew lot be&#39;er lissen up! I&#39;m initiatin&#39; plan zed dash crumpit disco disco!&quot; He smiled smugly before realizing how stupid his plan was. How on earth was a few words going to stop these things! The pyramidal creatures were massing in a huge swarm, extending barbed pseudopods to rain down on him in a swarm of death! Rimwarst closed his eyes, waiting for the end. He crouched over, curled in fear when the drone of the, thingies, for a lack of any other name reached his ears. &quot;Zed dash crumpit disco disco accepted. Prepare for jungle annihalation via fire.&quot; The mongoose uncurled to hear the first notes of Disco Inferno. He had to admit those things knew how to get the most out of a trombone. Then he remembered the whole jungle annihalation bit. &quot;Aaaaaahhhhhhh!&quot; He screamed as he ran inwards, towards the next dome. The lead singer of the Xoltaquiet band of eternal entrophy rotated to watch the fleeing figure dash through burning shrubbery. &quot;How rude.&quot; It buzzed, before resuming its lethal song.</p>
